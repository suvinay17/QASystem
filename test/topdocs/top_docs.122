COVER STORY: THEY SAID IT WOULD NEVER HAPPEN: CNN TURNS 10;

"WE HAVE TO REACH FOR THE STARS AND WHEN WE GET THERE, FIND OUT WHAT'S BEHIND

Before there were controversial reenactments of news stories, before there were
stand-up prime-time news shows and long before comedians moonlighted as weather
reporters and home video clips became commonplace on national newscasts,
somebody came up with a really bizarre idea for TV news.
</P>
<P>
A nonstop newscast. Seven days a week, 24 hours a day. To be broadcast around
the world.
</P>
<P>
When media magnate Ted Turner announced his ambitious Cable News Network 10
years ago, he was roundly laughed at. Not surprising, considering the
announcement came from a man whose WTB' "superstation" in Atlanta used to
fulfill its federal broadcasting requirements with a pie-throwing anchorman who
once invited a German shepherd to co-anchor his newscast.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the pending cable TV explosion had barely started to crackle.
Still, Turner forged ahead, his sights set on unsettling the Big Three
networks, which he compared to dinosaurs. "You know why they're not here
anymore?" he said in 1980. "Because the mammals ate their eggs. I'm a mammal."
</P>
<P>
CNN's beginnings were less than auspicious. During the Republican National
Convention in Detroit a decade ago, CNN's slipshod broadcasting booth was
located in the rafters above the band, so that every time the band played
"You're a Grand Old Flag," anchor Bernard Shaw was drowned out.
</P>
<P>
In time, however, Turner would sue the Reagan administration and the three
networks for CNN to be included in the White House press pool. The network's
paltry audience of 1.7 million U.S. households would swell to more than 50
million. Its broadcasts would reach-indeed span-the globe to about 90
countries. And CNN's continuous live coverage of breaking news events would
become a reliable trademark that no broadcast station could match.
</P>
<P>
The Times asked some CNN veterans to briefly reminisce about their early
experiences.
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner, president, CNN
</P>
<P>
"I came up with the idea for CNN back in 1975, when TBS first went up on
satellite. Home Box Office was already in existence. Since they had the new
movies and we had the old movies and non-network sports on TBS, I thought the
next channel that would be convenient would be an all-news channel. That's
where I got the idea. . . Even though I did not have the money and did not know
anything much about the news business, I just figured the concept was good
enough to go ahead and give it a shot.
</P>
<P>
"The networks pooh-poohed us a little bit at first. But I really cannot say
that I minded in retrospect."
</P>
<P>
Bernard Shaw, Washington anchor
</P>
<P>
"In 1980, I was dissatisfied with the new contract I was being offered at ABC
as senior Capitol Hill correspondent. I was tired of the network pool I had
been swimming in. (ABC News president) Roone Arledge spent an hour in his
office warning me it would be very bad for my career to go do something called
CNN. When I left, most people weren't even trying to conceal their derision,
their snickers. My attitude when I walked into CNN was the same attitude I had
at Marine Corps boot camp the first day. "I'm here. Let's get on with it."
</P>
<P>
"The moment I knew we were really onto something was when we carried Reagan's
speech before a labor group at the Washington Hilton Hotel. During a break, we
were monitoring the Secret Service radios. Suddenly someone said, "They're
shooting at the President.' We turned up the audio, and you could hear agents
running, screaming and cursing. I said, 'Let's get on the air,' and we didn't
get off until 10 hours later. We stayed with the story, no commercials. Our
coverage of the assassination attempt convinced me that we were onto something.
I wasn't making as much money as Dan, Peter or Tom-I still don't-but I knew I
was in the right place."
</P>
<P>
Ed Turner, executive vice president of news gathering
</P>
<P>
"We started out in half terror and half confidence. We all ran scared. Hell, we
still do. The conventional wisdom was that CNN was not going to make it. They
told us, 'First, there's no way you guys are going to get on the air. Second,
if you get on the air, there's no way you're going to stay there. Third, if by
some remote chance you do stay on the air, you'll bankrupt Ted (Turner).' Other
than that, it was a lot of encouragement."
</P>
<P>
Lou Dobbs, vice president of business news
</P>
<P>
"We didn't know what to expect competitively. My principal concern was not that
we couldn't pull it off. But I wanted to know would CBS emulate? Would ABC
duplicate? That was my fear. I knew that after we were on the air for six
months, we would be very vulnerable to the networks. Starting a 24-hour news
network required an investment by Ted Turner that could have bankrupted him,
but to the networks that kind of money is pocket change. The fact that a
successful imitator hasn't arisen astounds me to this day. The networks'
failure to react to the competitive threat of CNN was the answer to my
prayers."
</P>
<P>
Sandy Kenyon, senior entertainment correspondent
</P>
<P>
"When I first walked into the Washington bureau, it was like going backstage at
a Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland MGM musical. They were still building the bureau
about three weeks before air time. George Watson, a giant in journalism, was
testing a microphone. Producers were literally hammering the sign of the bureau
into place. And Daniel Schorr was walking around saying, 'This is just what CBS
was like after World War II.' As a young journalist, I felt like this big ship
was leaving, and I knew I had to be on it or get left behind.
</P>
<P>
"Ted (Turner's) master stroke was to install a satellite dish and put CNN in
the offices of Congress. The powerful people in the country turned to CNN the
day shots were fired at Reagan to find out what was happening. Bernie (Shaw)
was the hero of that one. He was the only network anchor not to declare Jim
Brady dead, which was extraordinary given the pressure to do so. The three
established networks had declared him dead, and Dan Rather held a moment of
silence for him. That's when I knew we were on our way."
</P>
<P>
Daniel Schorr, senior news analyst, National Public Radio.
</P>
<P>
(Schorr was a CBS News correspondent before being hired as CNN's first
employee. He left in 1985 over a dispute for editorial independence.)
</P>
<P>
"Ted Turner approached me a year before he started CNN. He asked me to join him
at the cable convention in Las Vegas, and then hired me 15 minutes before the
press conference to give legitimacy to what he was going to propose. I didn't
know anything about cable. But as he outlined CNN to me, I saw the vision
there, something inherently viable, a way to give people news 24 hours a day so
that they could turn it on and off like a water tap. I liked the idea of live
coverage as opposed to capsule coverage. I don't know where he got his
conceptions from, because I could tell he didn't know anything about news.
</P>
<P>
"I knew CNN would be a success. What I didn't anticipate was the extent of
CNN's success today. It would have been like asking me to foresee a revolution
in Eastern Europe, the tearing down of the Berlin Wall. I didn't foresee that
CNN would be seen in hotel rooms around the world. That CNN would be the pearl
in Ted's crown."
</P>
<P>
Cissy Baker, vice president and managing editor
</P>
<P>
"I thought CNN would be successful. I always believed it would be. It was
everybody else I had to convince. That became a second full-time job, really. I
wish I had a tape recorder in the beginning, when I was running the Washington
desk, trying to get an interview with a congressman or official. I would say,
'Hi, this is Cissy Baker. I'm calling from CNN, Cable News Network, Ted
Turner's all-news, 24-hour network, based in Atlanta, Ga., with a bureau here
in Washington. Do you get cable? Let me tell you about cable.' And then after a
while, I would get this, 'I'm sorry, could you repeat that please?' "
</P>
<P>
Mary Alice Williams, anchorwoman, NBC's "Sunday Today."
</P>
<P>
(Williams left for NBC last year after nine years as a CNN anchorwoman.)
</P>
<P>
"It never occurred to us we couldn't make this thing appen. In January of 1981,
when we welcomed the hostages back at West Point, we set up cameras all along
the bus route where they were arriving. But we didn't have a switcher to cut
between cameras. I was standing on top of this building in the freezing cold
with an engineer, and the buses were coming. I said, 'How do we do this? We
have to switch between cameras!' He said, 'No problem,' and he pulled some
wires out of this box and touched them together, and the pictures switched.
Nobody told me or him that it wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
"That was our mentality. The networks had a giant generator truck, and we were
manipulating wires by hand.
</P>
<P>
"In the industry, CNN was a quiet revolution. But the fact is there was nothing
quiet about it. On June 1, 1980, we went on the air at 6 p.m., Eastern time.
Our lead story was live. Vernon Jordan had been shot, and we showed President
Carter walking out of the hospital where Jordan was staying. At 6:30 p.m.
Eastern time, the broadcast networks went on with their evening newscasts, and
their lead story was Carter walking out of the hospital, and the footage said
'Courtesy of CNN' in the corner. That was our first night on the air."

<HL> CNN Plans Evening Newscast to Run Against Networks

   Cable News Network, the 24-hour all-news cable network, is preparing to launch an evening newscast next month, the first time it has scheduled a news program in competition with the three broadcast networks, according to people at CNN.

   And in an unorthodox move, the Turner Broadcasting System Inc. unit said it hired Catherine Crier, a state district judge from Dallas with no television or journalistic experience, to be a correspondent and anchor.
Although CNN didn't specify which program she would be assigned to, the CNN sources said she may co-anchor the new broadcast.

   CNN, which is expected to undergo some top management changes shortly, declined to comment on the new nightly news program.
But the CNN sources, who requested anonymity, said the newscast will be one hour long and has the working title "The World Today."
They said it is scheduled to premiere Oct. 16 at 6 p.m. EDT. Bernard Shaw, an anchor on CNN news programs, will be co-anchor, the sources said.

   CNN currently airs an entertainment news show, "Show Biz Today," at 6:30 p.m. when the three networks broadcast the first "feed" of their newscasts.
Each network said that a majority of their affiliates air the broadcasts at 6:30 p.m., instead of 7 p.m., when there is an updated second "feed."

   In the new tentative lineup, CNN would move its entertainment show to 5:30 p.m. and have a half-hour newscast, "Newswatch." at 5 p.m. CNN declined to comment on plans for "The World Today."

   A nightly news program that competes with the three broadcast networks is a departure from CNN's original strategy.
Turner officials said when the cable news channel made its debut in June 1980 that CNN didn't need a traditional evening newscast because it airs news around the clock.
The network started out in only 1.7 million households; today it is available in more than 51 million cable homes.
"We're equal in stature now to the networks, and we ought to go where the news viewing public is," said one CNN official.

   Bill Wheatley, executive producer of "NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw," said: "I'm intrigued by a one-hour newscast.
And as you have more competition, there is always the risk that some of your viewers may leave you.
But I want to wait to see what they do."
National Broadcasting Co. is a unit of General Electric Co.

   NBC is investing in news programming on cable through its new Consumer News and Business Channel, which it owns jointly with Cablevision Systems Corp.

   CNN's ratings are far lower than the networks'.
According to figures compiled by A.C. Nielsen Co., CNN has an average rating of 0.8.
In comparision, "ABC World News Tonight with Peter Jennings" last week had a 9.1 rating.
A ratings point represents 904,000 television households.

   CBS Inc. news officials declined to comment; officials of the ABC news unit of Capital Cities/ABC Inc. couldn't be reached for comment.

   CNN's latest moves come at a time when Turner Chairman R.E. "Ted" Turner is considering who will succeed 68-year-old Burt Reinhardt, who has served as president of CNN since 1982.
Mr. Reinhardt is said to have signed a three-year contract with Turner Broadcasting earlier this year with the understanding that a search for a successor would begin soon.

   Among the people being considered are Paul Amos, executive vice president for programming; Lou Dobbs, vice president and managing editor of CNN Business News; Jon Petrovich, executive vice president of Headline News; and Ed Turner (no relation to Ted Turner), executive vice president for news gathering.

   Meanwhile, CNN officials defended their decision to hire Ms. Crier.
"As a judge, trial lawyer and district attorney, Judge Crier has amply demonstrated the kind of critical thinking, knowledge and ability to express herself that are the very core of great journalism," said Mr. Reinhardt in a statement.
"We've never hired a judge before, and I don't know if any other TV news organization has either, but Judge Crier is a natural and is going to be a great news anchor for CNN."

   Ms. Crier, 34, was the youngest woman to be elected to the bench in Texas history in 1984, and was re-elected in 1988.
The Dallas judge resigned her elective post effective Sept. 30.

   "I've always done a lot of speeches," she said in an interview from her Dallas office, "and the agent who books my appearances recently began talking to me about pursuing this as a career.
I told him I was very interested and he brought my tape to CNN."

   When CNN continued its coverage of recorded
telephone conversations of Manuel Noriega while appealing a federal
judge's order in the case Thursday, a former judge read the story.
   Catherine Crier, a former Texas District Court judge, was one of
several anchors telling viewers that CNN continued to broadcast its
first report on the jailed Panamanian dictator because U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler's ruling would amount to
unconstitutional prior restraint.
   Hoeveler issued a temporary injunction in Miami barring CNN from
broadcasting parts of recordings of Noriega's conversations with
his lawyers that could infringe on attorney-client privilege.
   CNN used excerpts from the jailhouse tapes Thursday morning,
repeated that during the day and said it planned to televise
another installment Thursday evening.
   The Atlanta-based cable news operation said it would appeal
Hoeveler's ruling.
   Ms. Crier, the youngest woman elected to Texas District Court,
was among the anchors explaining that CNN continued to repeat the
morning segment ``because it believes it has the right to do so
under the First Amendment.''
   CNN said Ms. Crier had nothing to do with the decision to
broadcast the story, and was reading the same commentary as other
anchors.
   CNN declined to allow her to be interviewed about the story's
judicial ramifications.
   Ms. Crier created a stir when she was hired at the 24-hour news
network in 1989 with no journalistic experience. She has said she
left the judgeship because courtroom competition ``may have
surpassed the notion of serving clients, of seeking justice.''

A federal judge Wednesday lifted the ban against the broadcast of tape
recordings of Manuel A. Noriega's jailhouse phone conversations, effectively
ending a three-week legal battle over the rights of the press versus the right
to a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing seven tapes turned over by Cable News Network, U.S. District
Judge William M. Hoeveler determined that the only attorney-client conversation
on the tapes already had been broadcast by CNN, which had aired some of the
tapes before the judge ordered the network to stop.
</P>
<P>
"The tapes may be published as CNN wishes to publish them," Hoeveler said
during a hearing.
</P>
<P>
Frank Rubino, Noriega's chief defense counsel, said he had no objection to the
lifting of the ban. "The damage is done," he said. "A ban now is like shutting
the barn door after the horse escapes."
</P>
<P>
Rubino said he would pursue his motion to dismiss the case on the grounds of
government misconduct, along with a separate motion asking that the network be
found in contempt of court for airing more of Noriega's conversations after the
judge's Nov. 8 ban, and that CNN be fined $300,000 per broadcast.
</P>
<P>
CNN first broadcast two weeks ago portions of several tape recordings that were
made by officials of the federal prison south of here where Noriega has been
held on drug charges since he was seized during the U.S. invasion of Panama 11
months ago.
</P>
<P>
One of those conversations was between Noriega and a Spanish-speaking secretary
for Rubino who served as a translator.
</P>
<P>
After the first broadcast, Rubino asked Hoeveler to issue a ban, and he did.
CNN appealed that temporary order, and on Nov. 18 the Supreme Court refused to
lift it.
</P>
<P>
Steven Korn, an attorney for CNN's parent company, Turner Broadcasting Systems
Inc., reiterated the network position that prior restraint is never
appropriate. "It's fizzled," he said of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Rodney Smolla, a William and Mary law professor who heads the school's
Institute of Bill of Rights Law, told the Associated Press that it would have
been better had the issue returned to the high court for a final resolution.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Supreme Court let the ban stand "casts its shadow, and the
shadow is negative," he said. "Other lawyers will aggressively pursue these
sorts of strategies against news organizations. The battle isn't over yet."
</P>
<P>
CNN founder Ted Turner, who was attending the Western Cable Television
conference Wednesday in Anaheim, described the ruling as "a positive
development . . . . It doesn't really resolve the 1st Amendment issue
completely . . . (but) it's good for us."
</P>
<P>
CNN President Tom Johnson said the network can now pursue its story on the
government's taping of the ousted Panamanian leader's conversations.
</P>
<P>
"CNN's coverage of this possible misconduct was delayed by this judicial prior
restraint on press freedom," he said. "Despite the unfortunate delay, CNN's
reporting of government taping of Noriega phone conversations will continue."
</P>
<P>
The government has acknowledged routine taping of prisoners' phone calls at
federal prisons. Noriega signed a release acknowledging that his calls were
being monitored, but the defense said that release does not apply to
conversations with his attorneys.
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler on Wednesday ordered the Bureau of Prisons to cease sharing Noriega's
tapes with other government agencies unless he approves.
</P>
<P>
The case against Noriega, who is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 28, is plagued
now by only one "collateral issue," in Hoeveler's words, and that is money.
Rubino says he has been unpaid for the last 11 months because about $27 million
stashed by Noriega in overseas bank accounts has been frozen at the request of
the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hoeveler ordered the government to try again to make some of that
money available.

<HL> CNN Broadcasts From the Summit To U.S. in Spanish --- Continuing Program Is a Bid By the Network to Reach Large Hispanic Audience </HL>

   Among the less-noticed features of the Moscow summit are the Spanish-language broadcasts from there to the U.S. by Cable News Network.

   The broadcasts to a group of Spanish-language stations will continue after the Summit.
They represent the first salvo in the Atlanta-based network's effort to seize a piece of the fast-growing Hispanic television market.

   The entry of Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s CNN into Spanish-language television is the first by a major English-language television programmer.
It is yet another sign of the coming of age of the U.S. Hispanic market.

   For CNN, which already broadcasts to 58 countries in English, the new Spanish broadcasts are also a logical step toward penetrating Latin American markets.
"Three hundred million Spanish-speaking viewers are, for Ted Turner, a finger-licking, lip-smacking good audience," says CNN Vice President Paul Amos.
Already the company has agreements with 11 Latin American countries to carry the news program, Mr. Amos says.

   Cable News's half-hour newscast, called Noticiero Telemundo/CNN, will continue to be seen twice daily over the 18 Spanish-language stations owned by or affiliated with Telemundo Group Inc., a New York-based unit of Reliance Group Holdings Inc.
It replaced a news broadcast produced by Hispanic-American Broadcasting Corp. for which Telemundo paid between $3.5 million and $4 million last year, according to Telemundo's president and chief executive officer, Henry Silverman.

   "It's not an economic decision, it's one taken to improve the news," says Mr. Silverman.
According to the agreement, CNN will produce the news while Telemundo will sell advertising.
The two companies will split the advertising revenue.

   Hispanic broadcasting is a fast-growing albeit small media market in the U.S. Last year, advertisers spent about $222 million on Spanish-language television, a 21% increase from $184 million in 1986, according to Hispanic Business magazine.

   CNN's entry into the Hispanic market poses a challenge for Univision Holdings Inc., the Spanish-language broadcasting system owned by Hallmark Cards Inc. and a unit of First Chicago Corp., which has dominated the market for the past seven years and also broadcasts to about 10 Latin American countries.
"It's going to be competition but we are ready for it," says Guillermo Martinez, Univision's news director.

   Mr. Martinez says that notwithstanding CNN's recognized news gathering experience and its world-wide resources, the Atlanta-based television programmer has a lot of catching up to do when it comes to Spanish-language journalism.
"Their strength is their video, their weakness is that it's a translation of a newscast made for Americans," says Mr. Martinez.

   Mr. Amos grudgingly concedes part of that point -- but only for the moment.
"We are at a slight disadvantage moving into an area that is culturally unfamiliar to us," he says.
But, he adds, CNN has the news-gathering resources and commitment to Spanish-language broadcasting to win that audience.
"This is just the beginning," Mr. Amos vows.

<HEAD>Judge Asks U.S. Attorney to Prepare Contempt Charges Against CNN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   MIAMI (A) - A federal judge said today he has notified the U.S.
attorney's office to represent him in criminal contempt proceedings
against CNN for broadcasting Manuel Noriega's taped prison phone
calls.
   Legal scholars have said a contempt hearing could provide a
judicial test of whether the government can practice prior
restraint on the news media.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler eventually allowed Cable
News Network to broadcast the audio tapes after ruling they did not
violate Noriega's right to a fair trial.
   But he announced in a court hearing last week that he intended
to press contempt charges against the network if it were found to
have defied his initial order banning use of the tape.
   On Wednesday, he notified U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen to draw
up an order asking CNN to show cause why it should not be held in
contempt.
   The network will be allowed to respond in writing, Lehtinen's
spokeswoman Diane Cossin said today. A hearing will be set if
necessary.
   Because the order is against CNN and Turner Broadcasting System
Inc. as corporations, any penalties would take the form of fines,
not jail terms, Ms. Cossin added.
   Hoeveler said he decided to go forward with the criminal action
because the network defied his restraining order without waiting
first for the outcome of the legal process.
   In Atlanta, network spokesman Steve Haworth said: ``CNN is
confident that if and when a trial is held on the issue of
contempt, its actions will be vindicated.''
   The tape at issue involved a conversation between Noriega and an
investigator, with a defense attorney's secretary translating. The
network broadcast the tape for a day despite Hoeveler's order, but
withdrew it when the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta
backed the lower court judge. The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
involve itself in the matter.

   Cable News Network today handed over to a federal
judge tapes of Manuel Noriega talking on the telephone from his
prison cell.
   After receiving the tapes from a team of CNN lawyers, U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler gave them to federal Magistrate
William C. Turnoff.
   CNN unsuccessfully appealed Hoeveler's earlier temporary order
barring the network from airing the tapes. Some of the tapes were
broadcast before an appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld
the order.
   Hoeveler previously said he would give the tapes to the federal
magistrate so that Hoeveler, who will preside over Noriega's
drug-trafficking trial, is not ``tainted'' by any disclosures about
Noriega's defense strategy.
   Noriega's attorneys claim the tapes disclose defense maneuvers
and have damaged the deposed Panamanian dictator's chances for a
fair trial.
   Hoeveler said today the tapes would be transcribed and
translated from Spanish, then would be studied by Turnoff. Hoeveler
said he didn't know how long that would take.
   The tapes will be reviewed to decide whether they would damage
Noriega's right to a fair trial. If the judge then orders a
permanent ban on further broadcasts, CNN can again appeal,
eventually to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``We are confident that when Magistrate Turnoff reviews these
tapes and reports to the judge, CNN will be found not to have
violated the court order,'' said Steven Korn, lawyer for Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., CNN's owner.
   Korn said the conversations aired were not covered by the
judge's order against the broadcast of conversations protected by
attorney-client privilege.
   On Monday, a Noriega attorney, Jon May, also said he would ask
for an immediate contempt hearing aimed at forcing CNN to pay fines
of up to $300,000 for each violation of the judge's order. He said
he would ask the all-news network for a log of how many times it
aired the tapes.
   ``We're certainly going to suggest that might be one way of
solving a lot of problems, and I think an appropriate one,
considering the fact that General Noriega's defense was damaged by
CNN,'' May said of his proposal that fines against CNN be used for
Noriega's attorneys.
   CNN's attorney said the network doesn't expect to pay any fines.
He said that the conversations aired were not covered by the
judge's order against the broadcast of conversations protected by
attorney-client privilege.
   The fines could help solve another problem plaguing the defense
- a freeze on Noriega's bank accounts that has kept him from paying
his lawyers.
   The private attorneys have said they cannot stay on the case
without some money. Hoeveler said last week he would decide soon
whether to give Noriega government-paid counsel instead.
   The dispute over the tapes has raised questions about
attorney-client confidentiality, the right to a fair trial and the
First Amendment.
   Noriega has asked that the case be dismissed because of the
taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged government
misconduct.
   The fallen dictator is jailed outside of Miami on charges of
taking bribes to protect the cocaine trade. His trial isn't
expected to begin before the spring.

   Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s Cable News Network is in the late stages of negotiations to provide Telemundo Group Inc., a Spanish-language network, with a national nightly newscast in Spanish.

   If a final agreement is reached, CNN would be the first major English-language television programmer to provide such Spanish-language news programming.
The agreement also would open the door to the booming market for Hispanic programming to Turner Broadcasting.
A spokesman for that broadcasting concern confirmed the talks, but declined to comment further.

   The negotiations have drawn criticism, however, from the Hispanic broadcasters who currently provide New York-based Telemundo with its news programming.
They accuse Telemundo of trying to get cheaper news programming at the expense of developing Hispanic participation in broadcasting.

   Henry R. Silverman, Telemundo's president and chief executive officer, said: "If we go with CNN it would be because, in my opinion, it is the pre-eminent electronic news-gathering organization in the world."

   Mr. Silverman said CNN has proposed "piggybacking" its Spanish-language news production efforts on its 20 domestic and overseas news bureaus.
He said that it's not a question of reducing the $3.6 million Telemundo paid last year to Latino-owned Hispanic-American Broadcasting Corp. in Miami to produce the newscasts.
"We don't know if it will be cheaper.
We may spend the same amount of money and get something better."

   He added that Hispanic-American Broadcasting would be asked to provide what he described as "soft news" and entertainment features comparable to Entertainment Tonight or Solid Gold, a pop music variety show.

   For CNN, the talks hold the promise of a new programming outlet without a significant investment, an important consideration for cash-strapped Turner Broadcasting.
It would also fit with the aim for broad cross-cultural dissemination of CNN, which already is broadcast internationally.

   Hispanic broadcasting is a high-growth market with plenty of room for further growth.
Although about 8% of the population is of Hispanic descent, less than 1% of advertising dollars is spent on marketing directly to Hispanics, said Telemundo's Mr. Silverman.
Even so, combined advertising revenues last year rose 35% to 40% for the nation's two Spanish-language networks -- Telemundo and Univision, which is owned by Hallmark Cards Inc., Kansas City, Mo.

   Pedro Sevcec, news director for Hispanic-American Broadcasting, called the Telemundo-CNN negotiations part of a "shameful process," and questioned CNN's expertise in covering Latino and Latin American issues.
Telemundo "is changing from Hispanic newscasting to having the news read in Spanish.
There's a difference."

   Cable News Network is asking the Supreme Court
to let it broadcast tape recordings of deposed Panamanian leader
Manuel Noriega's telephone conversations with his lawyers from his
Florida jail cell.
   The justices today were awaiting responses from Noriega and the
Bush administration to the emergency CNN request and are unlikely
to act on the matter before next week.
   Meanwhile, the FBI said Thursday it had obtained CNN tapes in
Atlanta and was checking whether they were recordings of Noriega.
CNN protested that the tapes were obtained without a warrant and
demanded they be returned.
   The network said the material was taken from a room that been
occupied by one of its reporters at the Omni Hotel, part of a
complex that also houses CNN's offices. A security firm had
notified FBI agents about the box of materials, CNN said.
   CNN's lawyers on Thursday asked Justice Anthony M. Kennedy to
set aside a federal judge's order banning the broadcasts. Kennedy,
who handles such emergency matters from Florida, promptly referred
the case to the full court.
   Lawyers for Noriega and the administration were urged to reply
to the network's arguments by noon Saturday.
   The justices could act on the matter over the weekend but may
decide to take some more time to study it.
   ``CNN has been restrained indefinitely from telecasting news of
great importance to the public,'' lawyers for the network said.
``Balanced against this irreparable harm to the First Amendment,
CNN and the public are speculative threats to interests that can be
otherwise protected.''
   CNN is challenging an order issued by U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler in Miami on Nov. 8 that bars CNN from broadcasting
at least some portions of the seven tapes until Hoeveler can
determine whether the broadcasts would endanger Noriega's right to
a fair trial.
   CNN refused to hand over the tapes to Hoeveler but did agree not
to broadcast tapes of Noriega talking to his lawyers until
receiving some word from the Supreme Court.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender shortly after the U.S.
invasion of Panama last December.
   Federal prison officials say inmates' telephone conversations
routinely are monitored, except when the prisoners state that they
are talking to their lawyers.
   In addition to the emergency request, CNN's lawyers filed a
formal appeal with the full Supreme Court that seeks to have the
justices declare Hoeveler's order an unconstitutional prior
restraint on free speech.
   The network's lawyers said Noriega's rights to a fair trial have
been jeopardized by the government's taping of his conversations,
not by any CNN action.
   ``Gagging CNN will neither cure nor avoid any breach by the
prosecution,'' the lawyers said. ``It will serve only to punish a
news medium which has faithfully executed its constitutional role
by reporting on criminal proceedings and allegations of unlawful
government action.''
   A series of Supreme Court decisions has greatly limited judges'
power to issue such ``gag orders'' to safeguard fair trial rights.
   In a 1976 decision, the court unanimously struck down an order
issued against the news media by a judge presiding over a Nebraska
murder case.
   In that case, the court said such prior restraints may be used
only as a last resort and that judges always must first consider
less-drastic measures.

   Attorneys for Manuel Noriega and Cable News Network
agreed today to cool off their constitutional showdown, at least
until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on the issue of tape-recorded
conversations.
   Under the agreement, Noriega will not ask for contempt penalties
as long as CNN continues to refrain from broadcasting tapes between
the deposed Panamanian leader and his lawyers.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler endorsed the deal, but once
again warned CNN, noting that over the weekend the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta had backed his original gag
order.
   ``If you play any tapes in violation of my order, you are
violating not only my order, but also the appeals court order,''
Hoeveler said.
   CNN's attorney Terry Bienstock said the network accepted the
deal, but had the right to play other Noriega tapes as long as they
did not include conversations with his lawyers. The judge agreed.
   In Atlanta, where the network is based, CNN spokesman Steve
Haworth said that the network expects to file its appeal to the
Supreme Court later in the week.
   Constitutional law experts said the confrontation could become a
landmark case.
   CNN had defied an order Friday by Hoeveler by broadcasting an
excerpt in which the deposed Panamanian dictator spoke in Spanish
with a secretary for defense lawyer Frank Rubino.
   CNN decided for editorial reasons to stop broadcasting the
excerpt early Saturday, Haworth said. Later Saturday, the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta upheld Hoeveler's ruling.
   The appeals court also told CNN to give the seven tapes to the
Miami court so it could decide whether the broadcasts would
endanger Noriega's right to a fair trial on drug-trafficking
charges. That order was also stayed by today's agreement.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly
after the invasion of Panama in December.
   Rubino asked Hoeveler to find the Atlanta-based network in
direct civil contempt and fine the network $300,000 for each time
it televised the tapes and each time it shows them in the future.
   CNN accused Hoeveler of bias and asked him to disqualify himself
from the case.
   Floyd Abrams, a New York constitutional lawyer who served as
co-counsel for The New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case, said
the CNN case could set precedent because rules involving prior
restraint have been very clear through the years.
   ``We've almost totally banned prior restraint,'' Abrams said.
``If the Supreme Court were to uphold the prior restraint order on
CNN, this would be the first time in our country's history that any
such court order had been affirmed by the court.''
   In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case, the U.S. Supreme Court said
the government could not bar publication of classified documents
about U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The Times appealed rather than
defy a lower court order.
   George Rahdert, a lawyer at the Poynter Institute of Media
Studies, called the CNN case ``an astonishing illustration of
censorship,'' but said the network was ``playing with blasting
caps'' by defying the judge's order.
   ``It's rare in general that a news organization of any kind -
broadcast, cable or print - would do such a thing,'' said Rahdert,
who represents several newspapers. ``It really falls into the
category of civil disobedience.''
   CNN president Tom Johnson said the case is a classic
confrontation between the news media and the government they cover.
   He said the district court and appeals court construed the case
as a conflict between the Sixth Amendment, which provides a
defendant a right to a fair trial, and the First Amendment, which
provides for freedom of the press.
   ``There's a more fundamental issue here: reporting the news of
possible governmental misconduct,'' Johnson said. ``If CNN can be
restrained from airing news about the Noriega tapes, so can any
news organization.''

<HEAD>Scholar: Noriega Tapes Case Casts Shadow on Press Freedom</HEAD>

   The case of the Manuel Noriega tapes casts a shadow
over freedom of the press even though a federal judge lifted his
order blocking their broadcast, a constitutional scholar says.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler brought one legal battle
between Noriega and Cable News Network to a close Wednesday when he
lifted his 3-week-old order barring CNN from airing tapes of the
former dictator's jailhouse phone calls.
   Rodney Smolla, head of the Institute of Bill of Rights Law at
William and Mary College in Williamsburg, Va., said he was
disturbed that the U.S. Supreme Court refused to intervene earlier
to throw out the judge's order and that the high court will not get
another chance to review the order.
   ``It died with a whimper and I think it's unfortunate the case
ended this way,'' he said. ``It left on the books precedents that
cast some doubt on First Amendment protections that many people
thought were well settled.''
   Noriega's attorneys said they will still ask for contempt
penalties against CNN for broadcasting excerpts the day after
Hoeveler's ban.
   Defense attorney Frank Rubino also has requested that all
charges against Noriega be dropped on grounds the taping, a dispute
over Noriega's legal fees and other alleged government misconduct
ruined his chances of a fair trial.
   A decision on that request awaits, among other things, the
outcome of an FBI investigation into how the tapes were leaked.
   The judge lifted his order after he and attorneys reviewed
transcripts of seven tapes the network submitted last week.
   During Wednesday's hearing, Rubino withdrew his request to stop
the broadcasts, saying the only tape that appeared to violate
attorney-client privilege already had been broadcast. ``It does no
good to close the barn door after the horse is out,'' he said.
   Prosecutors also said they had no objection to lifting the ban,
again insisting Noriega's rights were never violated by the taping.
   Later Wednesday, CNN broadcast portions of the previously aired
tape. Spokesman Steve Haworth said the network had no immediate
plans to air the others.
   CNN President Tom Johnson said the judge's decision would allow
the network to pursue its story on the government's taping of
Noriega's conversations.
   ``CNN's coverage of this possible misconduct was delayed by this
judicial prior restraint on press freedom,'' he said.
   Scholars said the possible precedents from the case include
allowing prior restraint of news reporting, something most believed
to be strictly prohibited by the First Amendment.
   ``The fact that the Supreme Court has tolerated this gag order
for this length of time will unfortunately send a sign to judges
and lawyers around the country that a little prior restraint is
OK,'' said Jane Kirtley, head of the Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press.
   Rubino said the Drug Enforcement Administration or State
Department leaked the tapes to the government of Panama, which in
turn gave them to CNN. He said he wants the source of the leak
identified.
   ``We had to go along the road and put out fires - now we're
going after the pyromaniacs that started the fires,'' Rubino said.
   To head off more leaks, Hoeveler also ruled that the Bureau of
Prisons, which routinely records inmate conversations for security
reasons, cannot share any of Noriega's tapes with other agencies
without the judge's permission.
   The tape that touched off the dispute was of a conversation
between Noriega and one of Rubino's investigators, with the
lawyer's Spanish-speaking secretary serving as an interpreter. In
the conversation, Noriega is asked about two recently arrested
Panamanians and speculates that prosecutors intend to use them as
witnesses against him.
   Rubino on Nov. 8 got Hoeveler to order CNN to halt broadcasting
of any tapes that might interfere with attorney-client privilege.
The network aired a tape for a day but stopped when a federal
appeals court backed Hoeveler.
   The Supreme Court then refused to intervene on a 7-2 vote,
forcing CNN to submit the tapes to the judge for review.
   Noriega is in a federal jail outside Miami awaiting on charges
of taking $4.6 million in payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.

   A federal judge today lifted his ban against Cable
News Network's broadcast of Manuel Noriega's prison phone calls to
his legal team.
   The ban on CNN's use of the tape had sparked a fierce
constitutional debate, pitting the right of free speech against the
right to a fair trial.
   ``The tapes may be published as CNN wishes to publish them,''
said U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler during a morning hearing.
   Noriega's attorney Frank Rubino said he no longer had any
objection to CNN's use of the tapes. The only tape he challenged
was a conversation between Noriega and his defense team which had
already been broadcast by CNN.
   ``It does no good to close the barn door after the horse is
out,'' Rubino said today.
   The judge also ordered the federal Bureau of Prisons to stop its
practice of sharing tape-recorded conversations in the Noriega case
with other government agencies.
   Hoeveler last month temporarily barred CNN from using parts of
taped conversations between Noriega and his attorneys, who said
airing the tapes would destroy the ousted Panamanian dictator's
defense against drug charges.
   CNN broadcast some tapes, including a conversation between
Noriega and Rubino's secretary, who acted as a translator for
Rubino's investigator.
   An appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to lift the
order, and CNN last week turned over the tapes it had obtained to
Hoeveler for review.
   In Atlanta, CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said it was doubtful
that CNN would broadcast any of the tapes today.
   Rubino, after the hearing, said he still intended to ask for
contempt penalties against CNN for airing the tapes despite
Hoeveler's order.
   Steven Korn, attorney for CNN parent Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., said the network contended from the beginning that prior
restraint was wrong.
   ``It's fizzled. No prior restraint is ever appropriate,'' Korn
said outside the courtroom. He also said he considered the contempt
issue moot.
   Korn emphasized the judge's order to the Bureau of Prisons,
saying that was the correct approach to dealing with the taping of
Noriega's phone calls.
   Noreiga, who is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million
in payoffs to protect cocaine trade through Panama, is being held
in a federal prison near Miami. Federal prison authorities monitor
and tape record all inmates' telephone conversations except those
between inmates and their lawyers.
   The government has maintained that Noriega knew the calls were
being taped and that the calls were not protected by the
attorney-client privelege.
   Information from the Noriega tapes already is in the hands of at
least one additional party, the government of Panama, according to
an affidavit filed Tuesday by that nation's attorney in the United
States, Gregory Craig.
   The affidavit sought to persuade another judge hearing Panama's
$6.5 billion racketeering lawsuit against the deposed dictator to
freeze all Noriega's assets.
   Craig refused to disclose how he obtained information about the
taped conversations, but the affidavit appeared to include
information not broadcast by CNN.
   Noriega's attorneys have alleged that the U.S. government made
the tapes and supplied them to Panama, which in turn leaked them to
CNN, but Craig refused to comment.
   The affidavit said tapes of Noriega's calls show that ``while in
custody, he has been using the telephone for the purpose of moving
assets wrongfully obtained by him that are the property of the
republic of Panama.''
   Noriega spoke on the tapes to his daughter Sandra Noriega, his
mistress Vicki Amado, his mistress's mother and seven others,
including former pro-Noriega presidential candidate Carlos Duque,
the documents said.
   Noriega ``directed and continues to direct the movement of
assets'' from Hong Kong, Israel, Singapore, Australia and Brazil;
the funds were moved to banks in Europe as well as through Costa
Rica to Panama, Craig said.
   Craig would not say how much money was involved in the taped
conversations, but added, ``We've said from the beginning that we
think there is $300 million to $500 million of assets out there.''
   Noriega's attorney in the civil case, Stephen Zukoff, disputed
the legality of Craig's affidavit during hearing Tuesday before
U.S. District Judge Edward Davis, who is presiding over the civil
case. ``I don't know where he's getting his information from - he
certainly should have identified it,'' Zukoff said.
   He said he could not discuss whether the information was
accurate without examining it further.
   During the hearing, John Kester, another attorney for Panama,
noted the tapes appeared to show Noriega was moving money from one
account to another while telling Hoeveler he had no assets and
could not pay his attorneys.
   ``He can't have it both ways,'' Kester said.
   Hoeveler has said he will appoint government-paid defense
attorneys if the fee dispute is not settled soon.

   The Supreme Court is condoning at least brief
``gag orders'' against the news media by refusing to let Cable News
Network broadcast tape-recorded conversations of Panama's Gen.
Manuel Noriega, say free press advocates.
   They said the justices' action Sunday was extraordinary and
poses grave risks to unfettered reporting of court proceedings
nationwide.
   Attorney Floyd Abrams, who is representing CNN, said, ``The
court has left an opening through which defense lawyers and
prosecutors may try to muzzle news articles.''
   The high court's 7-2 rejection of CNN's emergency request ``does
seem to countenance brief prior restraints of a few days' duration
based on almost no showing of need at all,'' he said.
   The court's action Sunday effectively bars CNN from broadcasting
tape-recordings of conversations between Noriega and his lawyers.
   CNN had asked the justices to lift U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler's order forbidding the broadcasts until he could determine
what is on the tapes.
   The network said it will now turn over the tapes to Hoeveler's
court in Miami.
   Bruce Sanford, a lawyer who represents the Society of
Professional Journalists, said, ``The Supreme Court decision is a
grave disappointment that departs from existing Supreme Court
precedent. It is particularly troublesome because it seems
inconceivable that Noriega's counsel would ever be able to prove
that his right to a fair trial was in jeopardy because of the CNN
tapes.''
   Jane Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters' Committee for
Freedom of the Press, called the development a stunning departure
that ``signals a new era in First Amendment jurisprudence. It will
have a far-reaching impact in ... courts around the country.''
   However, Noriega defense attorney Jon May said, ``We think it's
a correct ruling. This was a major mistake by CNN, a big, big
mistake. This is a case of the messenger shooting itself. To
whatever extent the media may complain this is a significant
adverse decision, CNN has only itself to blame.''
   Only Justices Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day O'Connor sided
with CNN.
   Marshall, writing for both, said, ``I do not see how the prior
restraint imposed in this case can be reconciled'' with prior high
court rulings. He said Hoeveler's Nov. 8 order barring the CNN
broadcasts is based on the ``remarkable conclusion that publication
can be automatically restrained'' while courts study the basis for
such restraints.
   The seven justices who rejected CNN's application were silent,
leaving it unclear what they believe about the underlying
controversy.
   In the majority were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter.
   The high court order does not preclude the justices from some
day deciding that Hoeveler's order did violate CNN's free speech
rights protected by the First Amendment.
   The court could have refused to help CNN on some narrower
grounds and could review the issue at a later date if there is
still a live controversy.
   The Bush administration had joined with Noriega's lawyers in
opposing the CNN request.
   The Justice Department had said, ``The First Amendment is part
of the rule of law, not above it. A lasting prior restraint on
publication may be justified only in the most extraordinary
circumstances. But the rule of law requires permitting a court to
determine if those circumstances exist.''
   In addition to CNN's emergency request, the court also issued a
one-sentence order turning down a formal appeal filed by the cable
network.
   CNN President Tom Johnson called the court's decision ``a loss
of a battle in a continuing war against censorship.''
   He said he hopes Hoeveler will permit CNN to air the tapes after
reviewing them.
   The federal government lost a much-publicized battle over a
prior restraint in 1971 when the Supreme Court allowed The New York
Times and The Washington Post to publish the so-called Pentagon
papers detailing American involvement in Vietnam.
   But some observers noted that for several days the high court
itself had, in effect, blocked publication while it was reviewing
the dispute.
   The prior restraint then was based on the government's claim
that publication would hurt national security.
   In a key 1976 decision, the court unanimously struck down a gag
order issued against the news media by a judge presiding over a
Nebraska murder case. The court said then that such orders may be
used only as a last resort and that judges first must consider less
drastic measures.
   Noriega, who is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million
in payoffs to protect cocaine trade through Panama, is being held
in a federal prison near MIami. Federal prison authorities monitor
and tape-record all inmates' telephone conversations except those
between inmates and their defense teams.
   But the CNN tape recordings reportedly contain some
conversations between the deposed Panamanian leader and his
lawyers.
   Noriega's lawyers said broadcasting the tapes would create
unfair pretrial publicity, would compromise the confidentiality of
the attorney-client relationship and tip off prosecutors about
defense strategy.

   The FBI said Thursday it had obtained CNN tapes
and was checking whether they are related to the Manuel Noriega
recordings at the center of a court battle. The network protested
the tapes were obtained without a warrant.
   Cable News Network said the tapes were in a box of materials
related to the Noriega case that was removed from a hotel room that
had been occupied by one of its reporters. The room was in the Omni
Hotel, which is part of a complex that houses CNN's offices.
   It was not immediately clear whether the tapes taken were audio
recordings or videotapes. CNN President Tom Johnson and CNN chief
counsel Steve Korn said they didn't know the contents of the box.
FBI spokesman Scott Nelson confirmed that authorities obtained CNN
tapes without a subpoena, but he didn't know what kind of tapes
they were.
   ``We were made aware of the tapes and merely picked them up for
analysis,'' Nelson said.
   The network demanded that the materials be returned.
   CNN is seeking to overturn a federal judge's order blocking it
from airing taped jailhouse conversations between the deposed
Panamanian dictator Noriega and his lawyers.
   Turner Security, which provides security for the complex, had
notified FBI agents about the box of materials, the network said.
   The network said the FBI had no warrant and acted over the
objections of a CNN attorney who was present when the material was
taken by the agents. Korn said the attorney ``asked for a warrant
and was not given an answer, and certainly not given a warrant.''
   Johnson said he personally protested the FBI's action ``in the
strongest terms'' to agency officials in Washington.
   The network said a Turner Security official called the FBI
because agents had told him they were looking for ``stolen
government property.'' The network said the material was not
stolen.
   Hotel security officers, believing that CNN reporter Marlene
Fernandez had vacated the hotel room, removed the box Monday and
turned it over to Turner Security, CNN spokesman Steve Haworth
said.
   Turner Security returned the box to the hotel security office on
Thursday and then brought FBI agents to the office and gave them
the box, according to Haworth and hotel officials.
   The box contained some papers and at least one videotape, said
Omni General Manager Bill Thompson, who saw the box handed over to
the FBI.
   Johnson said ``it's in dispute'' whether the room was vacated by
Fernandez, who normally anchors CNN's Spanish-language telecasts in
Washington but had been working on the Noriega case.
   Haworth also said ``the people who needed to know did not know''
that Turner Security, another subsidiary of CNN's parent firm
Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc., had the box of materials in its
possession.
   The New York Times, citing a CNN source who spoke on condition
of anonymity, said the tapes taken were not the Noriega tapes.
``The FBI did not get the main course,'' he said.
   The tapes at the center of the court battle are recordings of
phone conversations between Noriega and his lawyers. On Nov. 8,
U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler in Miami barred CNN from
broadcasting at least some portions of the seven tapes it has until
Hoeveler can determine whether the broadcasts would endanger
Noriega's right to a fair trial by compromising privileged
attorney-client discussions.
   CNN has refused to hand over the tapes to Hoeveler. On Thursday,
the network asked a U.S. Supreme Court justice, Anthony M. Kennedy,
to let it broadcast the Noriega-lawyer tapes.
   Earlier this week, lawyers for CNN and Noriega struck an
agreement under which the network will not broadcast tapes of
Noriega talking to his lawyers until receiving some word from the
Supreme Court.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly
after the U.S. invasion of Panama in December.
   Federal prison officials say inmates' telephone conversations
routinely are monitored, except when the prisoners state they are
talking to their lawyers. But CNN said it has tapes that include
conversations between Noriega and his defense team.

   Cable News Network is demanding the FBI return a
box of recordings and papers related to the government's taping of
Manuel Noriega's jailhouse phone calls. The material was taken from
a hotel room where a CNN reporter stayed.
   Both an FBI official and CNN President Tom Johnson said today
they didn't know if the recordings were audio tapes or videotapes,
or if they were the phone calls between Noriega and his lawyers
that are at the center of a legal battle before the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   ``We just know that there were notes, work papers and tapes''
related to CNN's coverage of the Noriega story, Johnson said. ``But
in the process of working in an operation like this, you could have
all sorts of tapes, including (taped) air checks.''
   The box of material was given to the FBI on Thursday by security
guards at the hotel. CNN claimed the box was improperly removed
from the room of reporter Marlene Fernandez and that the FBI
obtained it without a warrant.
   CNN reported today that an FBI agent showed up at the CNN
Washington bureau looking for Fernandez and a producer, Kathy
Slobogan. Neither was present.
   Bureau officials told the agent that CNN would cooperate with
the FBI, but would not allow ``fishing expeditions'' through CNN
offices, the network said on a midday newscast.
   William Hinshaw, head of the FBI bureau in Atlanta, said today
that after a Thursday night meeting with CNN officials, he agreed
to seal the box and not take inventory of its contents until the
Justice Department orders him to do so.
   The FBI previously said agents would go through the box today.
   Hinshaw said he didn't know what materials were in the box. He
said he did see some cassettes in the box, but was uncertain if
they were audio or video cassettes, although he said ``one I saw
appeared to be a (audio) cassette.''
   The network has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a
federal judge's order, issued last week, barring it from airing
recordings of conversations between Noriega and the fallen
Panamanian dictator's legal team.
   In addition, a hearing was scheduled in Miami this afternoon to
determine whether Noriega, whose assets have been frozen by
prosecutors, should be declared indigent and appointed a government
defense attorney.
   Lead defense attorney Frank Rubino, saying it might be one of
his last acts in the Noriega case, today filed a motion to dismiss
the charges against Noriega, accusing the government of engaging in
a conspiracy to deny ``his right to a fair trial and the effective
assistance of counsel.''
   The motion accuses the government of misconduct by taping
Noriega's prison phone calls with his lawyers as well as illegally
freezing his funds. It also says an unidentified government witness
attempted to entrap the attorneys two months ago by soliciting a
bribe to change his testiony.
   Noriega is being held in a Miami jail, awaiting trial on charges
of taking $4.6 million in payoffs to protect the cocaine trade. The
FBI is investigating how CNN obtained seven tapes of his jail cell
phone conversations.
   FBI spokesman Scott Nelson in Washington said Thursday that
agents obtained the box without a warrant. ``We were made aware of
the tapes and merely picked them up for analysis,'' he said.
   Johnson said he protested the FBI's action ``in the strongest
terms'' to agency officials in Washington.
   CNN general counsel Steve Korn said today he'd written Joseph
Whitley, the U.S. attorney in Atlanta, ``demanding the return of
the tapes and that the materials in the box not be reviewed or
duplicated.''
   The New York Times today quoted an unidentified CNN official as
saying the actual Noriega recordings were not in the box.
   ``The FBI did not get the main course,'' the official said.
   The box was removed Monday from a room that had been occupied by
Fernandez, who has been working on the Noriega story.
   Her room was at the Omni Hotel, which is owned by CNN's parent
company, Turner Broadcasting, and is part of a complex that also
houses CNN's offices.
   Hotel manager Bill Thompson said hotel security officers thought
Fernandez had checked out when they removed a box containing papers
and at least one videotape.
   CNN's Johnson said today that Fernandez, who has been covering
the Noriega story, ``had not checked out of the room. But
apparently there was a mistake'' by the hotel that led to her room
being cleared out.
   After taking the box from the room, the hotel's security guards
saw that some of its contents were CNN property, he said. They
turned the material over to Turner security officers from whom the
FBI took the box, he said.
   He and Korn said it still unclear how the FBI was notified about
the box.
   ``I don't know who called who,'' Korn said.
   Turner Security, which provides security for the CNN Center
complex, ``had a discussion with the FBI inquiring about stolen
government property and Turner Security told them they had a box
that might fit that description,'' CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said
Thursday. CNN denied the material in the box was stolen.
   Haworth said Turner Security - a subsidiary of CNN's parent
company, Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. - did not tell
appropriate CNN officials it had the box.
   CNN said agents took the box over the objections of a network
attorney who was present. Korn said the attorney ``asked for a
warrant and was not given an answer, and certainly not given a
warrant.''
   Meanwhile, CNN lawyers on Thursday asked Supreme Court Justice
Anthony Kennedy to set aside a judge's order barring broadcast of
the phone conversations.
   Kennedy, who handles such emergency matters from Florida,
referred the case to the full court. There was no word on when it
might act.
   CNN is challenging an order issued by U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler in Miami on Nov. 8 that bars it from broadcasting
the tapes until Hoeveler can determine whether the broadcasts would
violate Noriega's rights.
   CNN refused to give up the tapes but agreed not to air any
attorney-client recordings until the Supreme Court decides the
matter. The network contends Hoeveler's order is an
unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech.
   Federal prison officials say inmates' phone calls routinely are
monitored, except when prisoners say they are talking to their
lawyers. But CNN said it has tapes that include conversations
between Noriega and his defense team.

   Catherine Crier, a former Texas judge with no
news experience, and Bernard Shaw, who has 25 years in broadcast
news, became TV's newest anchor team Monday with CNN's new ``The
World Today.''
   Crier, who never worked in news until she reported for work two
weeks ago at Cable News Network, made only three slight verbal
flubs and wasn't visibily nervous in her debut on camera and on the
one-hour weeknight series.
   Crier was in CNN headquarters in Atlanta, while Shaw, with CNN
since its creation in 1979, was in Washington.
   Their newscast, which CNN promotions say ``will change the face
of evening news,'' is CNN's first major push against the ``CBS
Evening News,'' ABC's ``World News Tonight,'' and the ``NBC Nightly
News.''
   However, only its second half-hour directly competes with those
broadcasts, and only in the Eastern and Central time zones. It
starts each night at 6 p.m. EDT and is nationally broadcast then,
with no taped repeats for the West Coast.
   West Coast affiliates of the major networks tape the networks'
nightly newscasts for broadcast three or 3{ hours after those
programs appear in the East.

<HEAD>Court's Ruling Against CNN Creates Loophole For GAg Orders Against
Press</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court's handling of the
CNN-Noriega free-press dispute creates a loophole for short-lived
``gag orders'' against the news media.
   Although the court 14 years ago told judges they almost never
may bar the reporting of information already in news media hands,
Sunday's 7-2 vote left intact such a restraint against Cable News
Network.
   The high court's action, however, was not unprecedented and may
not have set any lasting rule of law.
   CNN had asked the justices to lift an order by U.S. District
Judge William Hoeveler in Miami forbidding the broadcast of
conversations between Manuel Noriega, the imprisoned former
dictator of Panama, and his lawyers.
   FEderal prison authorities monitor and tape record all inmates'
telephone conversations except when told that inmates are talking
to their lawyers. But CNN reportedly has seven tapes containing
some conversations between Noriega and his defense team.
   When Noriega's lawyers rushed into court to prevent the tapes
from being broadcast, the judge ordered CNN to let him hear the
tapes so he could determine whether fair-trial rights would be
jeopardized. And the judge ruled that CNN could not broadcast the
tapes until his determination was made.
   The cable network, citing a series of Supreme Court decisions,
carried its fight to Washington rather than surrender the tapes.
Now, CNN will submit the tapes to Hoeveler and await his decision
on whether they may be broadcast.
   The ordered delay is itself a prior restraint on reporting -
something the Supreme Court in 1976 called ``the most serious and
least tolerable infringement'' of free-press rights.
   In a key 1976 ruling, the court unanimously struck down a gag
order barring the news media from publishing a Nebraska murder
defendant's confession after it was revealed in a public court
hearing.
   Two of the seven justices who voted against CNN Sunday said in
1976 they seriously doubted whether such prior restraints ever
could be valid.
   Writing for himself in the Nebraska case, Justice Byron R. White
said, ``There is grave doubt in my mind whether orders with respect
to the press such as were entered in this case would ever be
justified.''
   In the same case, Justice John Paul Stevens wrote he might rule
the press never can bE barred from reporting information it has
``no matter how shabby or illegal the means by which the
information is obtained, how serious an intrusion on privacy might
be involved, how demonstrably false the information might be, how
prejudicial it might be ... and how perverse the motivation for
publishing it.''
   Those views could indicate Sunday's vote centered on some issue
narrower than the constitutionality of Hoeveler's gag order.
   If the judge, after listening to the tapes, decides to continue
his ban, CNN could return to the high court. The justices would not
be precluded from ruling at that time that CNN's free-press rights
were violated.
   To some, such a scenario might seem contradictory. But similar
action was taken before the 1976 ruling - Justice HArry A. Blackmun
rejected an emergency request to lift the Nebraska judge's
restraining order pending the full court's decision.
   In 1971, the court ruled the government could not bar The New
York Times and The Washington Post from publishing stories based on
the so-called Pentagon papers detailing U.S. involvement in
Vietnam. But for five days the newspapers were barred by a high
court order from publishing such stories pending its decision.
   And in 1979 the justices rejected an emergency request by The
Progressive magazine, which was then under an order blocking
publication of an article the government said would help other
nations develop a hydrogen bomb.
   The high court refused to order a federal appeals court to speed
up its review of a restraining order issued by a trial judge. The
ban on publishing was in effect for more than seven months.
   Floyd Abrams, a First Amendment expert representing CNN, said
Sunday's action ``left an opening through which defense lawyers and
prosecutors may try to muzzle news articles.''
   But if such tactics are allowed by lower courts, Abrams said,
the Supreme Court might intervene.
   If CNN is not allowed to broadcast its tapes, such Supreme Court
intervention may not be far off.

A federal judge today lifted his ban against Cable News Network's broadcast of
Manuel Noriega's prison phone calls to his legal team.
</P>
<P>
The ban on CNN's use of the tape had sparked a fierce constitutional debate,
pitting the right of free speech against the right to a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
"The tapes may be published as CNN wishes to publish them," U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler said at a hearing.
</P>
<P>
Noriega's attorney, Frank Rubino, said he no longer had any objection to CNN's
use of the tapes. The only tape he challenged was a conversation between
Noriega and his defense team that had already been broadcast by CNN.
</P>
<P>
"It does no good to close the barn door after the horse is out," he said.
</P>
<P>
The judge also ordered the federal Bureau of Prisons to stop its practice of
sharing tape-recorded conversations in the Noriega case with other government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler last month temporarily barred CNN from using parts of taped
conversations between Noriega and his attorneys, who said airing the tapes
would destroy the ousted Panamanian dictator's defense against drug charges.
</P>
<P>
CNN broadcast some tapes, including a conversation between Noriega and Rubino's
secretary, who acted as a translator for Rubino's investigator.
</P>
<P>
An appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to lift the order, and CNN
last week turned over the tapes it had obtained to Hoeveler for review.

   The Supreme Court refused by a 7-2 vote Sunday
to give Cable News Network permission to broadcast tape recordings
of conversations between Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega and his
lawyers.
   The court rejected an emergency request by CNN that was aimed at
lifting a federal judge's order forbidding the broadcasts until he
could determine what the tapes disclose.
   The emergency request had called the Nov. 8 order by U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler in Miami an unconstitutional
``prior restraint'' of free speech. But only two justices -
Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day O'Connor - agreed with that
assessment.
   Voting against CNN were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter.
   The Justice Department had joined with Noriega's lawyers in
opposing the request.
   In addition to the emergency request, the court also turned down
a formal appeal filed by the cable network, in a one-sentence
order.
   CNN President Tom Johnson called the court's decision ``a loss
of a battle in a continuing war against censorship.''
   Johnson said the network would immediately turn the tapes in its
possession over to Judge Hoeveler. He said CNN is ``confident that
after he reviews them he will decide on the merits to deny the
prior restraint.''
   ``CNN is committed to establishing its full freedom to telecast
newsworthy information to the American people and it will pursue
this case vigorously in order to do so,'' Johnson said.
   Floyd Abrams, CNN's attorney in the case, said the court's
decison ``has left an opening through which defense lawyers and
prosecutors may try to muzzle news articles.''
   ``The refusal of the court to hear the case does seem to
countenance brief prior restraints of a few days duration based on
almost no showing of need at all by the courts,'' Abrams said.
   Noriega's defense attorney, Jon May, said CNN had opened a
``Pandora's box'' with its First Amendment challenge.
   ``We think its a correct ruling,'' May said. ``This is a case of
the messenger shooting itself. To whatever extent the media may
complain this is a significant adverse decision, CNN has only
itself to blame.''
   In a dissenting opinion for himself and O'Connor, Marshall said
``this case is of extraordinary consequence for freedom of the
press.''
   ``Our precedents make unmistakably clear that any prior
restraint of expression comes to this court bearing a heavy
presumption against its constitutional validity and that the
proponent of this drastic remedy carries a heavy burden of showing
justification for its imposition,'' Marshall said.
   ``I do not see how the prior restraint imposed in this case can
be reconciled with these teachings,'' Marshall said. ``Even more
fundamentally, if the lower courts in this case are correct in
their remarkable conclusion that publication can be automatically
restrained pending application of the demanding test established by
(a 1976 decision that severely limited the power of judges to
impose such restraints) then I think it is imperative that we
re-examine the premises and operation of (that decision).''
   Jane Kirtley, executive director Reporter's Committee for
Freedom of the Press, said she was ``stunned'' by the decision,
which she called ``truly unprecedented.''
   ``The fact that the court would be willing to tolerate a prior
restraint in these circumstances signals a new era in First
Amendment jurisprudence,'' Kirtley said. ``It will have a
far-reaching impact going beyond this case extending to many cases
in state and federal courts around the country.
   Bruce Sanford, an attorney for the Society of Professional
Journalists, said the court's decision is ``troublesome because it
seems inconceivable that Noriega's counsel would ever be able to
prove that his right to a fair trial was in jeopardy because of the
CNN tapes.''
   Walt Wurfel, a spokesman for the National Association of
Broadcasters, said his group was ``very disappointed'' with the
court's decision. ``We view the lower court's order as prior
restraint,'' he said.
   The Bush administration Saturday had urged the high court to
leave intact Hoeveler's order. Solicitor General Kenneth Starr, the
government's top-ranking courtroom lawyer, argued in written briefs
that the restraining order was justified to give the judge time to
determine whether seven tapes in CNN's possession might interfere
with Noriega's ability to receive a fair trial.
   Noriega, who is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million
in payoffs to protect cocaine trade through Panama, is being held
in a federal prison near Miami. Federal prison authorities monitor
and tape record all inmates' telephone conversations except those
between an inmates and their defense teams. But the CNN tape
recordings reportedly contain some conversations between the
deposed Panamanian leader and his defense lawyers.
   Sunday's high court order, issued without any explanatory
opinion, does not necessarily preclude the possibility that some
day the court will rule that Hoeveler's order did violate CNN's
free-speech rights.
   The court conceivably could have refused to help CNN because of
some procedural reason. The cable network might carry its legal
battle back to the court at some later date.
   But meanwhile, CNN is under court order not to broadcast those
portions of its tapes divulging Noriega's conversations with his
lawyers. If those conversations are broadcast, CNN could be cited
with contempt of court and fined heavily.
   The federal government lost a much-publicized battle over a
prior restraint in 1971 when the Supreme Court allowed The New York
Times and The Washington Post to publish the so-called Pentagon
papers detailing American involvement in Vietnam.
   In a key 1976 decision stemming from pretrial publicity in a
Nebraska murder case, the court ruled that forbidding the news
media from publishing or broadcasting information in its possession
almost never can be justified.
   The court in that decision called such prior restraints -
sometimes referred to as ``gag orders'' - the ``least tolerable''
measures of assuring fair trials.
   In seeking the prior restraint against CNN, Noriega's lawyers
argued that broadcasting the tapes would poison their client's
fair-trial rights in two ways: through pretrial publicity and by
compromising his relationship with his lawyers.

   A federal judge today weighed whether the
transcripts of Manuel Noriega's jailhouse phone calls are the
property of CNN or are part of the public record and should be
shared with other news organizations.
   Four news organizations went before U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler on Thursday seeking the court transcripts. Cable News
Network fought to keep them secret, accusing other media of trying
to scoop the network with its own story.
   Hoeveler said he would rule by Monday.
   Robert Bernius, representing Gannett Co. and its USA Today,
argued that in the wake of Hoeveler's decision on Wednesday to lift
his 3-week-old ban on airing the tapes, the transcripts were of
vital public importance.
   ``We ... want to know why a First Amendment crisis was
precipitated by these tapes,'' Bernius said.
   Gannett and USA Today joined The Miami Herald, The Associated
Press and the Miami-area Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV in the
effort to obtain the transcripts.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the transcripts should be
burned or returned to the network.
   ``This is not a clash of First Amendment rights, it is merely a
display of competitive jealousy,'' CNN said in court papers.
   Bienstock argued that giving them to other media organizations
would be like CNN demanding that the organizations give the network
their own reporters' notes. The transcripts include some tapes that
CNN has never broadcast, he said.
   ``This is again an intrusion into the news-gathering,
news-editing process,'' said Bienstock.
   Sanford Bohrer, another attorney for the four media
organizations, said, ``I think it's unfortunate that CNN feels it's
being put upon by others in the media. The real issue is the
public's right to look at anything it can get its hands on.''
   He noted that the transcripts were made by the court and the
originll tapes were made by the Bureau of Prisons, not CNN.
   Hoeveler interrupted Bienstock frequently and chided CNN for
fighting previously to broadcast the tapes, then opposing release
of the transcripts.
   ``The whole thrust of your case was that you wanted the world to
know what was on the tapes,'' Hoeveler said.
   Bienstock also cited a reporter's right to protect a
confidential source, saying scrutiny of the transcripts could help
reveal who gave the tapes to CNN.
   But the judge noted that the government, through the U.S.
attorney's office, had already seen the transcripts.
   ``In any event,'' he added, I have very little sympathy with
your source. Someone down the line has committed some grave
improprieties.''
   Bernius said those seeking the tapes had no interest in
identifying CNN's source, only in getting ``access to the factual
basis of a landmark judicial determination.''
   Three weeks ago, CNN revealed it had obtained seven tapes of
phone calls made from Noriega's prison cell near here. Federal
prison officials say they routinely tape phone conversations of
inmates unless the prisoner is calling his lawyers, and that all
inmates are made aware of this practice.
   Noriega's attorneys went into court Nov. 8 after learning about
the tapes and Hoeveler ordered CNN not to play any that might
interfere with attorney-client privilege. The network aired some
portions of the tapes for a day, but withdrew them when a federal
appeals court backed Hoeveler.
   The Supreme Court refused to intervene on a 7-2 vote, forcing
CNN to submit the tapes to the judge for review.
   The transcripts then were prepared by court officials in Miami
to aid Hoeveler and attorneys in the case in reviewing the contents
of the tapes.
   On Wednesday, Hoeveler decided to allow CNN to broadcast the
tapes and returned them to the network. CNN spokesman Steve Haworth
has said the network had no immediate plans to play the unaired
tapes in the next few days.
   While CNN won't say where it got the tapes, Noriega's attorneys
said the tapes were released to the government of Panama by the
State Department or the Drug Enforcement Administration and that
Panama gave them to CNN.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.
   One tape broadcast was a conversation between Noriega and his
defense team in which he speculated about whether two Panamanians
captured after the U.S. invasion would testify against him. On
another tape, Noriega appeared to be attempting to transfer $4
million with the help of his mistress' mother.

   A federal judge extended a ban against broadcast of
taped conversations between Manuel Noriega and his attorneys, but
Cable News Network defied the order Friday by playing another
recording.
   In the tape, Noriega discussed two potential government
witnesses with his defense team, and speculated on the prosecutors'
strategy.
   CNN President Tom Johnson defended the broadcast, calling the
judge's order ``unconstitutional prior restraint.''
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler told CNN's attorneys he
would hold the network in contempt of court if the tapes were
played, but did not act immediately.
   In an interview with a CNN producer broadcast later Friday,
Hoeveler said that whether or not he will find the network in
contempt ``remains to be seen.''
   Noriega's attorneys, meanwhile, accused the U.S. State
Department and the Panamanian government of President Guillermo
Endara of being the source of the tapes leaked to CNN.
   ``We believe the State Department had obtained copies of the
tapes, and gave them to the Endara government,'' said Noriega's
lead attorney Frank Rubino. ``A high-placed person in the Endara
government then provided them'' to CNN.
   A State Department spokesman said the agency was aware of
Rubino's comments, but had no immediate reaction.
   Noriega is charged in a February 1988 indictment with accepting
$4.6 million in bribes to turn Panama into a way station for the
Medellin cocaine cartel's U.S.-bound drug shipments. He has been
held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside of Miami since
shortly after he surrendered in the wake of the December 1989 U.S.
invasion of Panama.
   The tape played Friday by CNN was a conversation between Noriega
and Rubino's secretary, who acted as a translator for the two men.
She tells him two more people have been arrested in Panama, and
says he should review their names to determine ``whatever they can
know about you.''
   The men apparently referred to in the tape were an Alfredo
Sanchez and Felipe Camargo, a Noriega loyalist now imprisoned in
Panama who had been the general's top liaison with the Cubans and
is believed to be cooperating with the U.S. government.
   ``It is very interesting because it shows their strategy,''
Noriega says. ``It says they are trying to induce any of the two of
them to testify before the court against me.''
   Other tapes played Friday were conversations between Noriega and
allies, including a discussion with his mistress' mother about the
transfer of $4 million, CNN said.
   Earlier Friday, Hoeveler extended for 10 days his order banning
CNN from using any portion of the tape that could compromise the
former Panamanian dictator's attorney-client privilege.
   ``I cannot conceive that the law of prior restraint is so
sacrosanct and so encompassing'' it would allow broadcasting a
confidential attorney-client conversation no matter how damaging to
the defense, Hoeveler wrote in his order.
   The judge has also told CNN to turn over the tapes to a federal
magistrate, but suspended that requirement after the network
appealed the gag order to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta.
   Noriega attorney Jon May said he was preparing arguments to be
delivered in Atlanta Monday balancing the right of free speech
against the right to a fair trial.
   ``Right now we are on the cutting edge of the law in both the
First Amendment and the Sixth Amendment,'' May said Friday. ``This
could end up very quickly in front of the Supreme Court.''
   The U.S. Justice Department Friday was continuing its
investigation into whether the tapes were made by the Bureau of
Prisons and how they got into CNN's hands, said spokesman Doug
Tillett.
   The Justice Department said the Bureau of Prisons had the legal
right to tape such calls and does so routinely, but May said
Noriega's attorneys were assured their clients calls would not be
taped.
   ``If he asked the guard to call his lawyers, we had been led to
believe that those calls would not be recorded,'' May said. And he
noted that the prison knew when Noriega spoke to the attorneys,
because the guards, and not the prisoner, dialed the calls.
   Noriega's attorneys say they expect to ask for dismissal of the
charges against their client if they can prove misconduct in making
or handling of the tapes.
   The government of Panama, which in January had said its
shattered legal system could not properly try Noriega, says it is
now in a position to prosecute him if the U.S. case falls apart.
   ``In the case that the North Americans can't do it, we're going
to ask for him, and he will be judged in accord with Panamanian
law, because he committed many, many crimes,'' Endara said.
   Vice President Ricardo Arias said Noriega has ``very serious
charges against him'' in Panama.
   The Panamanian government has charged Noriega and at least seven
of his officers with looting the treasury.

<P>
A federal appeals court Saturday upheld an injunction barring Cable News
Network from airing taped jailhouse conversations between Manuel A. Noriega and
his defense team after the government claimed that the broadcasts will
jeopardize the deposed Panamanian dictator's right to a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta-based network said it will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The ruling by the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals came after the Justice
Department filed a brief arguing that the broadcasts could hinder selection of
an unbiased jury for Noriega's drug-trafficking trial.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the government argued that, because the tapes of Noriega's
telephone conversations could divulge details of his defense strategy, his
right to effective counsel could be compromised.
</P>
<P>
"The government cannot at this point be more specific with respect to the
possible harm that could flow from publication of the tapes because the
government, like the district court, does not know the contents of the
materials CNN has in its possession," the brief stated.
</P>
<P>
In Miami, meanwhile, CNN asked U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, who on
Thursday had banned the playing of the tapes, to disqualify himself from
hearing motions relating to the case.
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler told CNN's attorneys Friday that it would be in contempt of court if
it broadcast more tapes, but the network aired them anyway, arguing that
Hoeveler's order amounted to unconstitutional prior restraint.
</P>
<P>
The appeals panel in Atlanta called on the network to produce the tapes in
Hoeveler's courtroom.
</P>
<P>
"The 1st Amendment interests and public will best be served by immediate
production of the tapes . . . so that the district court can conduct the
difficult balancing of constitutional rights," the panel said.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's ruling heats up the battle between the network and the courts --
pitting CNN's concerns over its 1st Amendment rights against the Justice
Department's efforts to convict Noriega, who is being held at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center outside Miami. He has been there since shortly after he
surrendered to U.S. troops who invaded Panama last December.
</P>
<P>
"CNN has shackled the district court by refusing that court's reasonable
request to review the audiotapes it has in its possession," the appeals court
said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement after the ruling Saturday, Tom Johnson, CNN president, said that
network attorneys "are reviewing the decision" and that CNN "will pursue an
immediate appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court."
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Hoeveler convened a special Saturday afternoon session of the
district court to hear a motion by Noriega's attorney, Frank A. Rubino, that
CNN be held in contempt for airing the telephone tapes.
</P>
<P>
That hearing was quickly derailed, however, when CNN attorney Terry S.
Bienstock asked Hoeveler to disqualify himself from hearing any matters related
to CNN's broadcast of the Noriega tapes. He cited "personal bias and prejudice"
based on "extra-judicial statements" Hoeveler made to reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
On his way out of the courthouse parking lot Friday, Hoeveler had indicated to
a CNN reporter that he would find the network in contempt for airing more
Noriega tapes in defiance of his orders.
</P>
<P>
CNN's motion to dismiss Hoeveler from ruling on the tapes will be considered
today or Monday by presiding U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King.
</P>
<P>
The taped telephone conversations, in which Noriega and his defense team
discussed two potential government witnesses and speculated on prosecution
strategy, have fueled assertions that, although Noriega is jailed in America,
he still has power in Panama.
</P>
<P>
In Panama City, La Prensa, the city's largest newspaper, warned Saturday that
Noriega's ability to make telephone calls is a sign that he could be plotting
to overthrow the pro-American government of President Guillermo Endara.

<HEAD>U.S. Attorney Draws Up Contempt Charges Against CNN in Noriega
Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prosecutors worked on criminal contempt charges
Thursday against CNN for allegedly violating a judge's order
prohibiting the network from airing tapes of Manuel Noriega's
prison telephone calls.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler announced his intention
last week to press contempt charges against the network because it
apparently defied his initial order banning use of the audio tapes.
   Hoeveler eventually allowed Cable News Network to broadcast the
tapes, ruling they did not violate Noriega's right to a fair trial
on charges of providing safe passage for Colombia drug traffickers
through Panama.
   The contempt charges were expected to be ready in a few days,
said Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office.
   Because the order is against CNN and parent Turner Broadcasting
System Inc. as corporations, any penalties would take the form of
fines - not jail terms, Ms. Cossin said.
   ``CNN is confident that if and when a trial is held on the issue
of contempt, its actions will be vindicated,'' CNN spokesman Steve
Haworth said.

   Cable News Network today said CNN newsman
Bernard Shaw and a former Texas judge will be co-anchors of ``The
World Today,'' a new evening newscast that will go head to head
with the big three networks.
   The former judge, 34-year-old Catherine Crier, has no news
background. When hired last month by CNN, she resigned as a state
judge in Dallas. She was elected to that job in 1985.
   CNN's new one-hour newscast, which premieres Monday, will start
at 6 p.m. EDT. Its second half hour will compete directly with the
nightly newscats of CBS, NBC and ABC, but only in Eastern and
Central time zones.
   Those networks, which at 6:30 p.m. EDT give their affiliates the
first of two half-hour ``feeds'' of their nightly newscasts, tape
their newscasts for broadcast three hours later on the West Coast,
sometimes updating them with live reports. CNN's new show will be
fed live nationally.
   Crier will be co-anchor of ``The World Today'' from CNN
headquarters in Atlanta, and Shaw from CNN's headquarters in
Washington.

<P>
Call it the CNN paradox: At the hour of day when most TV viewers watch a
network news broadcast, the one network devoted solely to news has had no
newscast.
</P>
<P>
Now, as it approaches its 10th anniversary, CNN finally has a "flagship"
broadcast of its own. Starting tonight, CNN will broadcast "The World Today"
from 6 to 7 p.m. EDT weeknights and for the first time compete directly with
the nightly news seen on ABC, CBS and NBC (except on the West Coast, where "The
World Today" will be seen from 3 to 4 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
Until now, CNN's strategy has been to counter network news programming by
offering viewers something different -- most recently a show-business report
and financial news -- to compete in the East and Midwest against ABC's "World
News Tonight" with Peter Jennings, "The CBS Evening News With Dan Rather" and
"NBC Nightly News" with Tom Brokaw. But with 70% of network news viewers
catching the 6:30 p.m. Eastern broadcasts, it occurred to CNN executives that
their channel was missing an opportunity to attract people who were accustomed
to hard news at that hour.
</P>
<P>
"This is when people go shopping for their news," said Paul Amos, executive
vice president of news programming for CNN, "and we need to be on the shelf."
</P>
<P>
With its entry into the nightly news war, where star power is deemed a key
factor, CNN has teamed its most visible newscaster, veteran Bernard Shaw, who
will anchor from Washington, with newcomer Catherine Crier, who is as fresh a
face as there is in broadcast journalism -- she's never worked in TV news
before. Before landing at the anchor desk in CNN's Atlanta headquarters, based
on her audition for a proposed CNN talk show, Crier was an assistant district
attorney and then a state district court judge in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
For years, the three broadcast networks have talked about expanding their
half-hour evening newscasts, in part to ease time limitations on reporting as
well as to add a new dimension to a format that has remained virtually
unchanged for more than 20 years. But they've been blocked by their affiliated
stations, which don't want to relinquish even 15 minutes of what is their most
lucrative local programming time.
</P>
<P>
Now CNN has beaten them to it, creating considerable interest in "The World
Today" among TV journalists.
</P>
<P>
"It's another competitor," says William Wheatley, executive producer of "NBC
Nightly News." "And we are all curious about how they are going to do it,
because this would really be the first evening 'news hour.' All of us have
thoughts on how we would do an hour."
</P>
<P>
(He and other TV newsmen don't regard PBS' "The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" the
same way because, although it too is an hourlong nightly news show, it is
noncommercial and uses a different format from the traditional network
newscasts.)
</P>
<P>
"The World Today," as planned, will be divided into two half hours, the first
consisting of interviews and in-depth treatment of news and issues; some
reports might last up to 20 minutes, heretofore virtually unheard of in a
nightly newscast. The hour's second half will come closer to the traditional
nightly news format by presenting an overview of the day's important events.
</P>
<P>
Bill Kaczaraba, executive producer of "The World Today," described the program
as "a little more sophisticated" than CNN's usual broadcasts, which tend toward
straightforward, unadorned delivery of the news with stories repeated and
updated frequently. "The World Today" will have its own set and present a
package of freshly produced reports, which will be updated on subsequent
broadcasts, most notably "PrimeNews" (5 p.m. PDT) and "CNN Evening News" (7
p.m. PST).
</P>
<P>
CNN's decision to go head-to-head with the network newscasts is, by all
accounts, necessary for the network's growth as an influential news
organization.
</P>
<P>
"To truly come into their own, they do need a kind of signature broadcast,"
said Everette Dennis, director of the Gannett Center for Media Study at
Columbia University. The new broadcast, he said, is "a sign of maturation" for
CNN, which went on the air in June, 1980, as Ted Turner's upstart in the TV
news business. Today, CNN, which reaches 51 million cable subscribers, is
regarded as an equal alongside the three network news divisions.
</P>
<P>
"The World Today" isn't expected to have an immediate effect on the network
newscasts, each of which, despite a slight decline in audience during the last
few years, still attract an average of 8.5 million households nightly. In
contrast, about 500,000 households have been tuning in for CNN's early
"Newswatch" broadcast and the half-hour "Showbiz Today," which will move to
2:30 p.m. PDT starting today. "Moneyline" will continue to air at 4 p.m. PDT,
following "The World Today."
</P>
<P>
Even CNN executives say wooing viewers from the long-established network
newscasts will be a gradual process, because viewing habits are hard to break.
"We do not expect a tidal wave coming out of the blocks," says CNN's Amos. "One
thing we are cognizant of is that news programming takes a long time to build
an audience."

   A federal appeals court on Saturday upheld an
injunction barring Cable News Network from broadcasting tapes of
Manuel Noriega's telephone conversations with his lawyers.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also called on the
Atlanta-based network to produce the seven tapes in U.S. District
Court in Miami so the court could decide whether the broadcasts
would endanger Noriega's right to a fair trial on drug-trafficking
charges.
   The ruling came after CNN on Friday defied Judge William
Hoeveler in Miami, broadcasting excerpts from the tapes minutes
after the judge issued an order instructing the network not to do
so.
   CNN said it would appeal Saturday's ruling to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   ``We will be pursuing an immediate appeal,'' CNN spokesman Steve
Haworth said in a telephone interview. Haworth said he didn't know
yet if CNN would continue televising excerpts of the tapes.
   The appeals panel denied CNN's appeal of Hoeveler's 10-day
injunction against broadcasting excerpts of Noreiga's phone calls
from federal jail.
   It called on the network to produce the tapes in Hoeveler's
courtroom so that the trial judge can determine if Noriega's Sixth
Amendment rights to a fair trial have been violated by the U.S.
government and CNN.
   ``The First Amendment interests of the press and public will
best be served by immediate production of the tapes held by CNN so
that the district court can conduct the difficult balancing of
constititional rights,'' the appeals court said.
   ``CNN has shackled the district court by refusing that court's
reasonable request to review the audiotapes it has in its
possession,'' the court said.
   The Justice Department on Saturday morning filed a brief with
the appeals court, claiming the tapes could make it difficult to
select an unbiased jury for Noriega's trial.
   Noriega's right to a fair trial and effective counsel also could
be compromised if details of the defense strategy are revealed to
prosecutors, the brief said.
   ``The government cannot at this point be more specific with
respect to the possible harm that could flow from publication of
the tapes because the government, like the district court, does not
know the contents of the materials CNN has in its possession,'' the
brief states.
   On Friday, Hoeveler said he would hold CNN in contempt of court
if it disregarded his order. But in an unusual interview with CNN
outside the courtroom Friday night, the judge said he could not
rule on contempt without a prosecutors' motion.
   On Saturday afternoon, Noriega attorney Frank Rubino asked
Hoeveler to find CNN in direct civil contempt and fine the network
$300,000 for each time it had televised the tapes and each time it
shows them in future.
   Before Hoeveler could respond, CNN attorney Terry Beinstock
asked the judge to disqualify himself, accusing the judge of
revealing a personal bias against the network in the CNN interview
on Friday night.
   In the interview, a CNN reporter asked Hoeveler if he planned to
find CNN in contempt.
   ``That remains to be seen,'' the judge said. Asked why, the
judge replied, ``Well, somebody's going to have to move for that
and they (CNN) obviously are in contempt at the moment. The legal
proceedings will take place when somebody moves for sanctions.''
   In Miami, federal district Chief Judge James Lawrence King said
Saturday the motion seeking to disqualify Hoeveler from
consideration of the contempt issue ``will be handled in the
orderly manner prescribed for such situations.'' He would not
comment further.
   A tape CNN played Friday contained a brief conversation in
Spanish between Noriega and Rubino's secretary, said to be acting
as a translator for the English-speaking defense team.
   CNN provided an on-screen English translation and narration in
English that made it impossible to hear the actual exchange.
   CNN said the secretary told Noriega two people have been
arrested in Panama and says he should determine ``whatever they can
know about you.''
   Noriega says he knows only one of the people.
   ``It is very interesting because it shows their strategy,'' CNN
translated Noriega as saying. ``It says they are trying to induce
any of the two of them to testify before the court against me.''
   The men apparently referred to in the tape were Felipe Camargo,
a Noriega loyalist now imprisoned in Panama who had been the
general's top liaison with the Cubans, and Alfredo Sanchez, whom
The Miami Herald identified Saturday as a convicted drug smuggler
once employed by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency.
   Other tapes played Friday included conversations between Noriega
and his supporters, including a discussion with his mistress'
mother about the transfer of $4 million, CNN said.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel in exchange for letting drugs
move safely through Panama to the United States.
   He has been held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside
Miami since shortly after surrendering to U.S. soldiers who invaded
his country in December.

<TEXT>
   CNN attorneys on Tuesday handed a federal
magistrate a briefcase filled with tapes of Manuel Noriega's
telephone calls, saying they were confident the recordings would
show his rights were never violated.
   The network acted in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's
weekend refusal to lift the trial judge's order that CNN cease
broadcasting the tapes, and surrender them to determine if their
use invaded Noriega's attorney-client right to confidentiality.
   ``We hope and are confident that the court will conclude that
the prior restraint is not appropriate under these circumstances,''
said Steven Korn, chief counsel to CNN's parent company, Turner
Broadcasting System Inc. ``CNN believes ... that the conversations
that were telecast were not attorney-client privileged
conversations.''
   CNN surrendered the tapes to U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler in his chambers, but the judge said he did not want to
hear any potentially privileged conversations. He ordered them
given to U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff, who will make and study
transcripts and report his conclusions back to the Hoeveler, the
judge assigned to hear Noriega's drug-smuggling trial.
   No time limit was set, but Noriega's lead attorney Frank Rubino
said the judge guaranteed it would done ``with dispatch.'' It was
not known if the lawyers would be called in to consult with the
magistrate, or if a hearing would be held when his report was
issued, said Rubino.
   Korn refused to say how many tapes were handed over, or to
describe their contents or origins. He said the recordings
presented Tuesday were copies, not originals.
   He said CNN believes it never violated the judge's order because
the telecast conversations did not deal with privileged matters -
in part because Rubino tacitly agreed to broadcasting them when he
identified them on the air.
   But Rubino, who asked Hoeveler to set a contempt hearing against
CNN, strongly disagreed, although he acknowledged he does not know
the contents of most of the tapes.
   ``There are numerous conversations with the general wherein ...
defense strategies were discussed, witnesses were discussed, and
things of that nature,'' Rubino said. ``We assume that to be what's
on the tape.''
   Hoeveler refused to set an immediate contempt hearing against
CNN. He said he must await a decision by Chief U.S. District Judge
James Lawence King on a motion by CNN asking that the trial judge
be removed from the tapes case.
   Rubino has subpoenaed CNN to produce a log of how many times the
network and its affiliates telecast a tape between Noriega and his
defense team.
   Noriega is being held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional
Center. Prison officials routinely tape prisoners' phone
conversations for security reasons, unless the inmate indicates
beforehand that he is talking wiuth his attorney.
   The FBI is investigating how the tapes were leaked.
   Noriega co-counsel Jon May noted that the defense has asked for
contempt penalties of $300,000 per airing, and said one estimate of
damages was $12 million. That money should go to the cash-strapped
defense, he said.
   ``There is ample precedent for a court to direct a fine to one
of the parties,'' May said. ``And we are certainly, we believe, the
party most injured by CNN's actions, and ... would have the
greatest claim.''
   Hoeveler is considering whether to replace Rubino and May with
government-paid counsel. The judge had not announced a decision by
Tuesday.
   Noriega has asked that the case be dismissed because of the
taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged government
misconduct.
   The fallen Panamanian dictator is jailed outside of Miami on
charges of taking bribes to protect the cocaine trade. His trial
isn't expected to begin before the spring.

   CNN got the scoop on Manuel Noriega's taped phone
calls but no longer has an exclusive on the story.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler ruled Tuesday that
transcripts of the tapes will be made public Thursday unless CNN
appeals.
   He ruled in favor of four news organizations that had argued the
transcripts were part of the public record and that the public had
a right to know the facts behind a case that had tested the limits
of freedom of the press.
   CNN had sought to retain exclusive use of the tapes, accusing
the other news organizations of trying to steal their story.
   ``The content never was and never will be CNN's,'' said Sanford
Bohrer, an attorney for the four news organizations: The Miami
Herald, The Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of
Miami and Gannett Co. and its USA Today.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the network had not decided
whether to appeal.
   He said the judge broke new ground by deciding that material
used in closed court hearings could be made public.
   ``To the extent it benefits all media, CNN's pleased about
that,'' Bienstock said. ``But we still see this as a continued
breach of the news-gathering process, by allowing access to
information gathered under a promise of confidentiality.''
   CNN has broadcast some of the seven tapes and argued that the
recordings, and therefore the transcripts, were its property. The
network said the transcripts should be burned or returned to CNN.
   Hoeveler disagreed, saying CNN ``did not interview Noriega to
obtain the conversations, nor did it record the conversations.''
   The tapes contain conversations between the deposed Panamanian
dictator, who awaits trial on drug-trafficking charges, and his
defense team. His lawyers accuse the government of leaking the
recordings made by prison authorities.
   After CNN aired one of the tapes last month, Noriega attorney
Frank Rubino argued that the recordings violate Noriega's
attorney-client privilege, and Hoeveler on Nov. 8 barred the
network from further such broadcasts.
   But CNN aired a tape anyway the next day, saying the First
Amendment forbids prior restraint of the media.
   CNN stopped the telecasts after a federal appeals court upheld
the judge's ruling. The U.S. Supreme Court, on a 7-2 vote, refused
to intervene.
   CNN then submitted the tapes to Hoeveler, who had the
transcripts made. After all sides examined them in secret, the
judge found the tapes did not prejudice Noriega's defense and said
the network could air them.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.

   A federal judge barred the Cable News Network from
broadcasting Manuel Noriega's taped conversations with his lawyers,
saying the ousted Panama dictator's right to a fair trial on drug
charges is in jeopardy.
   Defense attorney Frank Rubino said he would demand that the case
against Noriega be dismissed.
   ``We are absolutely shocked and horrified that the United States
government would wiretap General Noriega and his lawyers engaging
in the most sensitive of communications,'' Rubino said.
   But Justice Department officials said the taping was routine,
and that Noriega had known his calls would be monitored. A federal
prison spokesman said it was up to Noriega to inform officials that
he was talking with his attorneys so they would stop the recording.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler on Thursday told CNN it
couldn't broadcast the tapes, made by prison officials, and
demanded an investigation into how the network got them. He also
ordered the taping stopped.
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, in Tampa on Thursday, said
U.S. officials want to find out how the tapes were leaked to CNN.
   ``It concerns us greatly that an apparent unauthorized use was
made of these tapes,'' he said.
   CNN accused the judge of exercising unconstitutional prior
restraint and demanded an immediate hearing on the issue from the
11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. No hearing was
immediately scheduled by the appeals court, but Hoeveler scheduled
another hearing in his court for late this afternoon.
   Meantime, he told the news station not to broadcast, at least
through today, any tapes that would interfere with attorney-client
privilege rights.
   ``Because of our belief the order is unconstitutional, we will
continue our coverage as we challenge this restraining order in the
courts,'' said CNN President Tom Johnson.
   Hoeveler said he had to weigh Noriega's right to a fair trial
against CNN's right to freedom of the press.
   ``It's becoming more and more difficult in this case to assure
that both parties get a fair trial,'' he said.
   U.S. Justice Department officials said the taping was routine
and produced a document in English and Spanish that Noriega signed
acknowledging that his phone conversations would be monitored.
   Rubino complained that the taping of Noriega's conversations
violated his client's right to private meetings with his attorneys
and jeopardized his case because the U.S. government now knows his
defense strategy.
   U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokesman Gregory L. Bogdan in Washington
said prisoners are supposed to inform guards when they are talking
to their attorneys so the monitoring can be stopped.
   Federal prosecutors told Hoeveler they haven't heard the tapes.
Rubino was skeptical.
   ``And I believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth
Fairy,'' he said.
   The taping flap is the latest threatening to delay or derail
Noriega's trial on charges he accepted $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel to protect their smuggling
operations through his country.
   The U.S. government has earmarked $6 million of $20 million in
frozen Noriega assets for payment of his attorneys, but last month
Panama filed a lawsuit accusing Noriega of looting its treasury and
said it would seek to have those assets frozen. Noriega's defense
teams says it needs the money to put together his defense before
the case can go to trial.
   The trial is scheduled to begin early next year, but both sides
agree it will probably be delayed.
   Panamanian President Guillermo Endara said Thursday that if the
United States does not go through with the trial, Panama wants
Noriega returned to face charges there.
   ``In the case that the North Americans can't do it, we're going
to ask for him, and he will be judged in accord with Panamanian
law, because he committed many, many crimes,'' he said.

   Manuel Noriega got his day in court, accusing the
U.S. government of railroading him by freezing his assets and
forcing out his attorneys. A federal judge assured him he will get
a fair trial.
   Meanwhile, at a press conference in Atlanta, Cable News Network
on Friday denied a reporter's box full of tapes and other items on
the Noriega case was made available to the FBI.
   But CNN could not clearly explain a sister company's alleged
role in getting the box to federal agents Thursday.
   Speaking extensively to U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler for
the first time since he surrendered in January to U.S. invasion
troops, Noriega tried Friday to stop him from replacing private
defense attorneys with government-paid lawyers.
   ``I am now at the mercy of a totally unfair and unjust system
that chooses my prosecutors and now chooses my defense lawyers,''
the deposed Panamanian dictator said, reading quietly but
forcefully in Spanish from a prepared statement.
   Led by Frank Rubino, Noriega's lawyers say they can no longer
work unless the Panamanian's assets are unfrozen to pay them, or
the judge raises the $75-an-hour fee cap on court-appointment
lawyers.
   Hoeveler said he would rule in the near future, but reminded the
attorneys that raising the caps for the Noriega case was rejected
previously.
   He also said he received communications from ``some exceedingly
fine criminal defense lawyers'' willing to take the case under the
low government fee schedule.
   ``I want the defendant to understand he is not being cast adrift
by the court and by the judicial system,'' Hoeveler said.
   Earlier Friday, the private defense team filed a broad motion
asking dismissal of all drug charges against their client. It
argued that freezing Noriega's assets and taping his prison phone
calls was government misconduct.
   Hoeveler did not immediately rule on the dismissal motion.
   In the CNN matter, the network claims the FBI contacted Turner
Security, a subsidiary of Turner Broadcasting Inc., which also
operates CNN. The network says agents told Turner Security they
were searching for a box fitting the description of one hotel
security officers removed earlier in the week from the room of a
reporter assigned to the Noriega case.
   The FBI maintained that agents learned of the box from Turner
Security. Joe Shirley, head of Turner Security, did not return
repeated phone calls Friday.
   William Hinshaw, agent in charge of the Atlanta FBI office, said
Shirley called an agent investigating how CNN got the Noriega tapes
and told the agent that a box labeled ``Noriega tapes'' had been
removed from a hotel room. The agent, Hinshaw said, earlier had
contacted Turner Security about interviewing a CNN employee.
   ``I think when (Shirley) called he ... was just trying to
fulfill his responsibility,'' Hinshaw said.
   CNN general counsel Steven Korn insisted the FBI, not Turner
Security, made the first phone call about the box. When asked
whether CNN made the box available to the FBI, Korn replied:
``Emphatically, no.''
   Asked why Turner Security didn't give the box to CNN, Korn said,
``That's a good question.''
   CNN has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Hoeveler's
order, issued last week, barring it from broadcasting recordings of
prison telephone conversations between Noriega and his defense
team.
   CNN President Tom Johnson said Friday he didn't know if the
recordings contained in the box were audio or video tapes, or if
they contained phone calls between Noriega and his legal team.
   Noriega is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
outside Miami on charges of accepting $4.6 million in bribes to
turn Panama into a way station for Colombia's Medellin cocaine
cartel.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects CNN Bid To Broadcast Noriega Tapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court has refused to give Cable
News Network permission to broadcast tape recordings of
conversations between Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega and his lawyers.
   CNN, meanwhile, is demanding the FBI return a box of recordings
and papers related to the case. The material was taken from an
Atlanta hotel room where a CNN reporter stayed.
   The Supreme Court on Nov. 18 rejected an emergency request by
CNN that was aimed at lifting a federal judge's order forbidding
the broadcasts until he could determine what the tapes disclose.
The vote was 7-2.
   The emergency request had called the Nov. 8 order by U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler in Miami an unconstitutional
``prior restraint'' of free speech. But only two justices -
Thurgood Marshall and Sandra Day O'Connor - agreed with that
assessment.
   Voting against CNN were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Byron R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens,
Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and David H. Souter.
   The Justice Department had joined Noriega's lawyers in opposing
the request.
   CNN President Tom Johnson called the court's decision ``a loss
of a battle in a continuing war against censorship.''
   Johnson said the network would immediately turn the tapes in its
possession over to Judge Hoeveler. He said CNN is ``confident that
after he reviews them he will decide on the merits to deny the
prior restraint.''
   Meanwhile, many questions remained about the network material in
the FBI's possession.
   CNN said the tapes and documents were taken by security officers
from an Omni Hotel room that had been used by reporter Marlene
Fernandez, who had been covering the Noriega story.
   Johnson said Fernandez had not checked out of the room, but the
hotel staff, apparently mistakenly, cleared out her room.
   After taking the box from the room, the hotel's security guards
saw that some of its contents were CNN property, he said. They
turned the material over to Turner security officers, from whom the
FBI took the box.
   Johnson said it was still unclear how the FBI was notified about
the box.
   Turner Security, which provides security for the CNN Center
complex, which contains both the hotel and the CNN offices, ``had a
discussion with the FBI inquiring about stolen government property,
and Turner Security told them they had a box that might fit that
description,'' CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said. CNN denied the
material in the box was stolen.
   Haworth said Turner Security - a subsidiary of CNN's parent
company, Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc. - did not tell
appropriate CNN officials it had the box.
   The New York Times quoted an unidentified CNN official as saying
the actual Noriega recordings were not in the box.
   ``The FBI did not get the main course,'' the official said.

<HEAD>Union Employees of UPI Accept Pay Cut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union employees of United Press International
on Nov. 16 accepted a proposed 35-percent pay cut for 90 days.
   Chris Dahl, secretary-treasurer of the Wire Service Guild, said
the pay cut was approved by 62 percent of those voting. The numbers
voting on each side were not released.
   Dahl spoke by telephone from the union's headquarters in New
York, where the ballots were counted.
   UPI vice president and spokesman Milt Capps said before the vote
that if employees accepted the pay cut, the company would be in a
financial condition to continue operating for 60 to 90 days while
it seeks a buyer.
   The financially troubled, 83-year-old news service already has
cut management salaries by the same percentage for 90 days.
   Capps had said if the pay cut were rejected, UPI might file for
protection under federal bankruptcy laws within days.
   Union officers had recommended rejection, saying the employees
could not afford the pay cut and it would not be enough to keep the
company afloat.
   Dahl said about 310 UPI employees are members of the guild. He
said the total work force covered by the union contract, counting
those who are not members, is close to 400.
   Capps said the company does not give out information on how many
bureaus or how many employees it has at home and abroad. UPI
announced in September that it was closing bureaus in New Mexico,
Wyoming, Montana, Michigan and North Dakota. It has since laid off
an unspecified number of employees.
   The top scale for a newsperson at UPI is approximately $690 a
week.
   The news service, founded in 1907 as United Press, became United
Press International when it merged with Hearst's International News
Service in 1958.
   In recent years, the company encountered financial difficulties
and changed hands three times.
   The original owner, the E.W. Scripps Co., sold it in 1982 to
Media News Corp. of Nashville, Tenn. It continued to lose money and
was sold in 1985 to Mario Vasquez-Rana, a wealthy Mexican newspaper
publisher.
   The present owner is Infotechnology Inc., parent firm to a
number of high-tech ventures.
   Infotechnology announced this month it has retained an
investment banking firm to negotiate the sale of its companies, and
hopes to sell them by the end of the year.

<HEAD>Canadian Network Cutting 1,100 Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said Dec. 5 it was
eliminating 1,100 jobs and cutting newscasts and other programming
to save $108 million.
   The shortfall is due to government funding cuts, inflation,
declining television advertising, and such other costs as new taxes
and pension funding, said CBC President Gerard Veilleux.
   The cuts represent just under 10 percent of CBC's $1.2 billion
annual budget. About $900 million of that comes from government and
the rest from ad revenue. CBC employs about 10,000 people, and the
layoffs are its worst ever.
   Veilleux said at a news conference that the cuts go into effect
April 1, but some effects will be felt immediately.
   ``These decisions have given me many sleepless nights,'' he told
CBC employees during a closed-circuit televised announcement. ``I
can only trust we're doing the right thing.''
   As part of the cuts, the CBC has decided it can no longer afford
the $20 million annual cost to run Radio Canada International, the
international shortwave radio service, or the $4.5-million cost of
the English and French parliamentary channels, which broadcast
House of Commons proceedings. CBC will ask the government to pick
up the tab for tese operations.
   In addition, English and French radio network budgets will be
cut by 1 percent. The following year, 2 percent will be trimmed
from their budgets.
   Newsworld, CBC's all-news cable channel, is not supposed to be
affected. However, many of its news items originate at regional
stations that will be closed.

<HEAD>Former Panamanian Diplomat Reportedly Focus of Tapes Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The FBI investigation into who leaked tapes of
Manuel Noriega's prison phone calls focuses on a political opponent
who might testify against the deposed Panamanian dictator,
newspapers reported.
   The FBI believes the source of the leak appears to be Jose
Blandon, once an intelligence officer in Panama for Noriega and the
country's former consul general in New York, The Miami Herald and
The Washington Post reported, quoting unidentified sources.
   Blandon denied leaking the government tapes. In an interview
published Dec. 9 in The Post, Blandon said someone in the U.S.
government who wants to sabotage the Noriega trial must have been
responsible.
   ``Somebody in the government was leaking them,'' Blandon said.
Drug enforcement agents were present whenever he had access to the
tapes, and he was allowed to make only written notes, Blandon said.
   The FBI is trying to determine who gave the tapes to Cable News
Network, which aired some of Noriega's conversations from prison
over the past month. The broadcasts were halted briefly while a
federal judge decided whether Noriega's right to a fair trial would
be jeopardized. After reviewing the tapes, the judge decided to let
CNN broadcast them.
   In a related matter, the Justice Department is refusing to
return documents belonging to a CNN reporter, saying they may be
evidence in an investigation of the leaked recordings.
   The Justice Department filed a brief Dec. 3 with the U.S.
District Court in Atlanta opposing a motion by CNN for return of
the documents.
   The materials were in a box taken from a hotel room that
reporter Marlene Fernandez had been staying in. The FBI confiscated
the box after hotel officials, apparently thinking Fernandez had
checked out, reported it as abandoned property.
   The Justice Department said it kept 15 documents and returned
all the other items in the box to CNN, including 52 documents and
five videotape cassettes labeled ``Noriega Tapes.''
   In another development, the network said Dec. 5 it was dropping
its fight to prevent the release of court transcripts of the
Noriega tapes.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, ruling in favor of four
news organizations that demanded access to the transcripts, had
said they would be released unless CNN appealed.
   ``CNN's main concern in opposing unsealing of the transcripts
has been to protect the integrity of agreements with sources,'' CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth said.
   But after reviewing the transcripts, network officials decided
there was little danger of compromising those sources, he said.
   The organizations seeking the transcripts were The Miami Herald,
The Associated Press, Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of Miami and
Gannett Co. Inc. and its USA Today. They argued that the public has
a right to examine the content of the tapes, which were at the
center of a freedom-of-the-press dispute.

<HEAD>Head of Japanese Public TV Wants Global News Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of Japan's public broadcasting system said
he wants to create a global news network to counter the spread of
Cable News Network to dozens of countries.
   ``I don't mean to bad-mouth Mr. Turner, but CNN is trying to
force U.S. news on the rest of the world,'' NHK Chairman Keiji
Shima said Dec. 3, referring to CNN head Ted Turner.
   Uder Shima's plan, broadcasters from Asia, Europe and North
America would be responsible for eight-hour daily segments focusing
on their own region.
   Shima said he believed Asians should cover issues about Asia,
but he did not give a detailed explanation why. He also said there
was not enough news about the region being broadcast to other parts
of the globe.
   Shima, in a speech to foreign reporters, acknowledged that the
British Broadcasting Corp. has shown little interest in his
proposal. But he said other major broadcasters have expressed
interest.
   He did not identify those broadcasters, however, and an NHK
spokeswoman said the names could not be released because
negotiations were under way.
   Shima provided no concrete details of his plan, but said he
hoped such a network could be set up in about six months.
   NHK has two channels on Japanese television, one with general
programming and the other featuring educational fare. It also has
two stations for satellite broadcasting. The programming on those
stations includes news broadcasts from several countries.

   When the news broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago, Sen. Christopher Dodd called the State Department for a briefing.
"They said, `follow CNN,'" he told reporters.

   That shows how far Ted Turner's Cable News Network has come since its birth nine years ago, when it was considered the laughingstock of television news.
It is bigger, faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks.
Its niche as the "network of record" during major crises draws elite audiences around the world.

   But for all its success, CNN has hit a plateau.
Although viewership soars when big news breaks, it ebbs during periods of calm.
CNN executives worry that the network's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and won't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives multiply for news and information on cable-TV.

   "Just the fact we're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin," says Ed Turner, CNN's executive vice president, news gathering (and no relation to Ted Turner).
"You can't live on that."

   So CNN, a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc., is trying to reposition itself as a primary channel, or what people in the television industry call a "top of mind" network.
Tonight, to kick off the effort, CNN will premiere its first prime-time newscast in years, an hourlong show at 6 p.m. Eastern time to air head-to-head against the network newscasts.
The show will be co-anchored by Bernard Shaw and Catherine Crier, a 34-year-old former Texas judge and campus beauty queen who has never held a job in television or journalism.

   The new show is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current format toward more full-length "signature" programming with recognizable stars.
To distinguish itself, CNN is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global-news program.
It is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- to lure and keep experienced staffers.
And it is embarking on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large investigative-reporting team.

   "The next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables," says Jon Petrovich, executive vice president of Headline News, CNN's sister network.

   But that won't be easy.
Networks, like other consumer products, develop images in peoples' minds that aren't easy to change.
It also takes money that CNN has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially to see.
And the cable-TV operators -- CNN's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way they are.

   The repositioning bid is aimed at CNN's unsteady viewership -- and what may happen to it as the cable-TV news market grows more competitive.
Already, CNN is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co.'s Consumer News and Business Channel, both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future.
In addition, many cable-TV systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations.

   CNN wants to change its viewers' habits.
Its watchers are, on the whole, a disloyal group of channel-zapping "grazers" and news junkies, who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching CNN, according to audience research.
That's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks.
The brief attention viewers give CNN could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data, and advertising, become more important to cable-TV channels.

   CNN's viewer habits have been molded by its format.
Its strategy in the past has been to serve as a TV wire service.
It focused on building up its news bureaus around the world, so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks.
It filled its daily schedule with newscasts called "Daybreak," "Daywatch," "Newsday," and "Newsnight," but the shows varied little in content, personality or look.

   Now, the push is on for more-distinctive shows.
"Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity," says Paul Amos, CNN executive vice president for programming.

   Accordingly, CNN is adding a world-affairs show in the morning because surveys show its global-news hour in the afternoon is among its most "differentiated" programs in viewers' minds, says Mr. Amos.
And it is exploring other original programs, similar to its "Larry King Live" and "Crossfire" talk shows, which executives hope will keep people tuned in.

   Then there's "The World Today," the prime-time newscast featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. Crier.
Until now, CNN has featured its Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period.
But 70% of the cable-television-equipped households that watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m., the network discovered, so CNN wants in.
Mr. Amos says the Shaw-Crier team will probably do two live interviews a day, with most of the program, at least for now, appearing similar to CNN's other newcasts.

   Some in the industry are skeptical.
"I find it hard to conceive of people switching over to CNN for what, at least in the public's mind, is the same news," says Reuven Frank, the former two-time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley-Brinkley Report.

   The evening news is also slated as CNN's stage for its big push into investigative journalism.
In August, the network hired award-winning producer Pamela Hill, the former head of news specials at ABC.
She's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who will produce weekly, in-depth segments, with an eye toward breaking big stories.
CNN executives hope the headlines created by such scoops will generate excitement for its "branded" programs, in the way "60 Minutes" did so well for CBS.

   That's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical CNN will follow through with its investigative commitment, especially after it sees the cost of producing in-depth pieces.
"They've never shown any inclination to spend money on production," says Michael Mosettig, a senior producer with MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, who notes that CNN is indispensable to his job.

   The network's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards, resulting in a less-experienced work force.
CNN recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15%, but they're still drastically underpaid compared with the networks.
Says Mr. Mosettig: "CNN is my wire service; they're on top of everything.
But to improve, they've really got to make the investment in people."

   In any case, cable-TV-system operators have reason to fear any tinkering with CNN's format.
They market cable-TV on the very grazing opportunities CNN seeks to discourage.
"We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general-interest, long-format programming," says Robert Stengel, senior vice president, programming, of Continental Cablevision Inc., which holds a 2% stake in Turner Broadcasting.

   When presidential candidate Michael Dukakis
addresses Hispanic voters in their own language, Cables News
Network can broadcast his words untranslated on its new
Spanish-language program.
   The language spoken by one-eighth of the U.S. population has
become part of the daily newsroom hum at the Headline News studios
in Atlanta, as CNN enters its fourth month of producing ``Noticiero
Telemundo-CNN.''
   ``It's a very ambitious undertaking for CNN to have gotten
into,'' said the program's executive producer, Marlene May. ``And
they're going full steam ahead. It's sort of like the sky's the
limit right now.''
   The twice-daily, half-hour newscast premiered in May with
on-scene coverage of the Moscow summit.
   It is the first time a major Enlish-language news organization
has entered the growing Spanish-language television market.
   But CNN's Spanish product is shown in this country on 18
Spanish-language stations owned by or affiliated with Telemundo
Group Inc., a Spanish network based in New York.
   CNN also sold the program in eight Latin American countries.
   Its main competitor is the newscast produced by Univision
Holdings Inc., a Spanish-language broadcast system that has been
around for some 25 years.
   The 25-member bilingual staff shares CNN's Headline News studio
in Atlanta and has access to the cable networks' English-language
news gathering resources worldwide.
   ``The resources of 1,600 CNN employees around the world are
available for them to use in Spanish if they choose,'' said Steve
Hayworth, spokesman for the Atlanta-based CNN.
   However, May stresses that the newscast is not just a
translation of CNN's English product.
   ``We've hired our own journalists _ everything from editors to
writers to anchors to reporters,'' she said. ``There's not a
translator on my staff.''
   Numbering more than 20 million, Hispanic Americans have become
the fastest growing minority market in the country. Among the half
who understand English, more than 50 percent still spend most of
their time watching Spanish-language television, according to a
survey cited in the trade journal Television-Radio Age.
   Advertisers spent $223 million on Spanish-language television
last year, up 23 percent from 1986 and nearly double the $118
million spent in 1984, the journal reported.
   ``There is obviously an important and large and affluent
marketplace of Spanish-speaking Americans,'' Hayworth said.
   Though CNN hasn't been on the air very long in Spanish, May said
she's pleased with the results of its first summer.
   ``We're ecstatic about the fact that we've kept up our audience
share and ratings in New York,'' she said, adding that the program
also has been doing well in Miami and Los Angeles, other cities
with large Hispanic populations.
   ``We try to do stories that we feel would really affect the
Hispanics ... most things related to health, children, education _
the dropout rate is a major problem among Hispanics,'' said May, a
native of Cuba.
   Jorge Gestoso, a co-anchor of the program, said it's important
for Hispanic journalists to see world events through the eyes of
their audience.
   ``When we covered the Republican National Convention, we tried
to focus on how what they were saying could affect the lives of
Hispanics,'' said Gestoso, who was born in Uruguay.
   ``It's vital, it's essential to have Spanish language news. The
audience is very different _ at least a portion of them speak only
Spanish or very little English,'' he said. ``There's a vital need
to let them understand what's going on in the world.''

cease-fire Monday, agreeing to postpone their constitutional
showdown over taped conversations until the U.S. Supreme Court
rules on the issue.
   Under the deal is worked out in federal court, CNN must refrain
from playing any tapes between the imprisoned former Panamanian
leader and his attorneys.
   In return, Noriega's defense delayed a request for contempt
penalties of up to $300,000 per broadcast against the network. U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler also delayed his order demanding
that CNN hand over seven disputed tapes to the court.
   ``Our concern is to keep General Noriega from being denied a
fair trial,'' defense attorney Jon May said. ``I'm not here to
squeeze blood out of CNN.''
   He said suspending the contempt proceedings will allow the
Supreme Court to focus on the broader constitutional question
balancing protections of the attorney-client privilege and freedom
of speech.
   Noriega's attorneys Saturday asked the judge to find CNN in
contempt after the network defied his court order and televised a
contested tape.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the network accepted the deal,
but had the right to play other Noriega tapes as long as they did
not include conversations with his attorneys. The judge agreed.
   The Atlanta-based network is expected to file its appeal to the
Supreme Court later in the week, a CNN spokesman said.
   ``We agreed that CNN would not air, pending Supreme Court
review, any attorney-client conversations that it has in its
possession,'' network attorney Terry Bienstock said. ``We just want
the issues to be narrowly and properly framed before the Supreme
Court.''
   Federal prosecutors have remained on the sidelines during the
CNN-Noriega dispute, but U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said Monday
he supports the gag order.
   ``These tapes should not be played under the fair-trial
concept,'' Lehtinen told the judge.
   May said Monday's deal stops the clock on the contempt
penalties, but does not prevent the defense from later asking for
fines against CNN.
   Although attention has focused on the media, May said there are
also other potential parties to the dispute.
   ``There's a whole bunch of people in the U.S. who may have these
tapes, including the State Department and the CIA,'' he said. Lead
Noriega attorney Frank Rubino has said the tapes were leaked to CNN
by a Panamanian official who received them from the State
Department.
   Rubino has said he expects to ask for dismissal of all charges
against Noriega based on government misconduct in recording the
calls made from the Metropolitan Correctional Center.
   Hoeveler endorsed the deal, but took note of CNN's one-day
defiance of his previous gag order. He emphasized that over the
weekend the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta backed
his original ban on broadcasting the conversations.
   ``If you play any tapes in violation of my order, you are
violating not only my order, but also the appeals court order,''
Hoeveler said.
   CNN had defied the order by broadcasting an excerpt Friday night
and Saturday in which the deposed Panamanian ruler spoke in Spanish
with a secretary for Rubino. On the tape, Noriega speculated that
the government would use as witnesses against him two men who
surrendered to U.S. troops in Panama.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held near Miami
since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly after the invasion of
Panama in December.

   A federal judge, frustrated by delays in paying
Manuel Noriega's attorneys, said today he will appoint two
government-paid defense attorneys if their fee problem is not
resolved by Friday.
   ``It is obvious that we simply may not be able to unfreeze any
money,'' U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said during a hearing
on the fees.
   In June, Hoeveler ordered prosecutors to unfreeze about $6
million in 27 Noriega-linked bank accounts for use by the Noriega's
private lawyers.
   But five months later, defense lawyers have not received a
penny, and today they asked Hoeveler to light a fire under the U.S.
government and banks in France, Switzerland and Austria, to release
the funds.
   But Justice Department attorney Drew Arena told the judge that
the foreign governments had frozen the accounts for their own
investigations and have so far refused to release them despite the
U.S. government's request.
   The problem is the United States had alleged the money was drug
proceeds, but was now reversing course by asking that it be given
to Noriega, Arena said.
   ``It's rather, your honor, like trying to `unring' a bell,''
Arena said.
   Lead defense attorney Frank Rubino accused the U.S. State
Department of undermining efforts to unfreeze the funds by
encouraging foreign governments to act on their own. Hoeveler,
however, said he was frustrated by the delays and wanted the case
to proceed as quickly as possible.
   The judge has agreed that the trial will not begin Jan. 28, but
said it will not be delayed by much.
   Under the law covering court-appointed counsel, the attorneys
could receive only a maximum of $60 an hour, far less than the $350
an hour Noriega's attorneys have said they needed.
   Meanwhile, Noriega and Cable News Network have agreed to let the
U.S. Supreme Court decide whether the deposed Panamanian dictator's
tape-recorded conversations with his lawyers can be broadcast.
   CNN aire excerpts of one tape over the weekend in defiance of
Hoeveler.
   The defense and the network agreed Monday to suspend their feud
until the U.S. Supreme Court decides whether CNN's free-press
rights outweigh Noriega's right to a fair trial. The network
planned to file the appeal this week.
   ``I will be interested in seeing what the Supreme Court will do
in this novel situation,'' Hoeveler said.
   The Atlanta-based network agreed not to play any of the disputed
tapes until the Supreme Court rules. In return, Noriega's defense
delayed a request for contempt penalties of up to $300,000 per
broadcast against the network, and Hoeveler stayed his order that
CNN hand over seven disputed tapes to the court.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said the network had the right to
play other Noriega tapes as long as they did not include
conversations with his attorneys. The judge agreed.
   CNN defied Hoeveler by broadcasting on Friday and Saturday an
excerpt of a tape in which Noriega spoke in Spanish with a defense
attorney's secretary, who translated for his defense team. On the
tape, Noriega speculated that the government would use as witnesses
against him two Panamanians in U.S. custody.
   Rubino has said he will seek dismissal of all charges against
Noriega, alleging government misconduct in recording the calls made
from the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside Miami.
   Noriega has been held there since his surrender to U.S. forces
shortly after the invasion of Panama in December. He is accused of
accepting $4.6 million in bribes to protect the cocaine trade.

Cable News Network today handed over to a federal judge tapes of Manuel Noriega
talking on the telephone from his prison cell.
</P>
<P>
After receiving the tapes from a team of CNN lawyers, U.S. District Judge
William Hoeveler gave them to federal Magistrate William C. Turnoff.
</P>
<P>
CNN unsuccessfully appealed Hoeveler's earlier temporary order barring the
network from airing the tapes. Some of the tapes were broadcast before an
appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the order.
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler previously said he would give the tapes to the federal magistrate so
that Hoeveler, who will preside over Noriega's drug-trafficking trial, is not
"tainted" by any disclosures about Noriega's defense strategy.
</P>
<P>
Noriega's attorneys claim that the tapes disclose defense maneuvers and have
damaged the deposed Panamanian dictator's chances for a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
Hoeveler said today the tapes would be transcribed and translated from Spanish,
then would be studied by Turnoff. Hoeveler said he did not know how long that
would take.
</P>
<P>
The tapes will be reviewed to decide whether they would damage Noriega's right
to a fair trial. If the judge then orders a permanent ban on further
broadcasts, CNN can again appeal, eventually to the U.S. Supreme Court.

CNN RULING MEANS PRESS HAS LESS FREEDOM
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Supreme Court, ignoring its own precedents, has let stand a federal judge's
gag order forbidding Cable News Network from broadcasting tapes of Manuel
Noriega's jailhouse telephone conversations. The court offered no explanation
for its stunning and potentially far-reaching decision. Its 7-2 vote, refusing
both CNN's emergency request to lift the stay and its appeal on the merits of
the gag order, means that for now at least the effort to deny CNN its right of
free speech remains in force.
</P>
<P>
Let there be no mistake about it. The ultimate loser in all this is the public,
for it is the people's essential liberties that the First Amendment is intended
to protect.
</P>
<P>
The highest judicial authority in the land has approved the notion that a court
can censor newspapers, magazines or broadcasters in advance of publication --
on a finding that the right to free speech may be outweighed by another claimed
right.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers call this form of censorship "prior restraint." The Supreme Court
specifically considered it in a 1976 Nebraska case. At that time the court
unanimously struck down a gag order issued by a Nebraska judge who sought to
bar pretrial publication of an alleged murderer's confession.
</P>
<P>
The judge thought publication might make a fair trial impossible. The Supreme
Court held that this possibility was insufficient to justify prior restraint.
The court said that gag orders may only be used as a last resort -- with judges
obligated first to consider less drastic measures.
</P>
<P>
Judge William M. Hoeveler ordered CNN to stop playing the Noriega jailhouse
tapes on the air due to the outside possibility that they might prejudice the
former Panamanian dictator's right to a fair trial. But there was virtually no
showing of need behind this order, or any apparent consideration that less
drastic measures might suffice.
</P>
<P>
Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for himself and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,
the other dissenter to Sunday's decision, went right to the heart of the
matter.
</P>
<P>
"Our precedents," said Marshall, "make unmistakably clear that any prior
restraint of expression comes to this court bearing a heavy presumption against
its constitutional validity and that the proponent of this drastic remedy
carries a heavy burden of showing justification for its imposition.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see how the prior restraint imposed in this case can be reconciled
with these teachings . . . ."
</P>
<P>
It's possible that Judge Hoeveler, after listening to the tapes in CNN's
possession, will lift his gag order. Even then, a dangerous precedent allowing
courts to temporarily silence the press will have been set, inviting judges to
invoke prior restraint on the most problematical of claims.
</P>
<P>
It's by no means inconceivable that "temporary" censorship could be used to
deny the public timely information about official misconduct, financial
manipulations, threats to public health and safety. Justice Marshall is right.
This is a case of "extraordinary consequences for freedom of the press," and,
by extension, for American liberties.

<HEAD>Judge Lifts Ban on Broadcast of Noriega Tapes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday lifted a ban on
broadcasting tapes of Manuel Noriega's prison telephone calls,
defusing a confrontation between the rights of the media and those
of a criminal defendant.
   While CNN hailed the decision as a victory over censorship,
Noriega's defense and constitutional specialists said the case
showed the U.S. Supreme Court was willing to accept at least
temporary restrictions on the press.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler's decision ended a
three-week legal battle between Noriega and the network, which
aired some of the tapes before the judge ordered CNN to stop.
   CNN President Tom Johnson said the decision would allow the
network to pursue its story on the government's taping of the
ousted Panamanian leader's conversations.
   ``CNN's coverage of this possible misconduct was delayed by this
judicial prior restraint on press freedom,'' he said. ``Despite the
unfortunate delay, CNN's reporting of government taping of Noriega
phone conversations will continue.''
   The judge ruled after he and the attorneys reviewed transcripts
of seven tapes the network submitted to the court last week
following the Supreme Court's refusal to overturn Hoeveler's
initial ban.
   At Wednesday's hearing, Noiega defense attorney Frank Rubino
told the judge he would withdraw his request to stop the
broadcasts. He said the only tape that appeared to violate
lawyer-client privilege already had been broadcast.
   ``The problem today is that the tape's out, it's been published
to the world,'' Rubino said.
   ``It does no good to close the barn door after the horse is
out.''
   Federal prosecutors said they had no objections to lifting the
ban, once again insisting that Noriega's rights were never violated
by the routine prison taping.
   Rubino said outside the courtroom that the case has already left
its mark in the balancing of First Amendment protections for
freedom of speech and Sixth Amendment guarantees of a fair trial.
   ``The Supreme Court has upheld prior restraint and ordered CNN
to turn the tapes over to the court, and CNN complied with the
court,'' Rubino said. ``Prior restraint is in full force and
effect.''
   Rodney Smolla, a William and Mary law professor who heads the
school's Institute of Bill of Rights Law, also said the case has
left a legacy, in part because the Supreme Court refused to halt
the ban.
   He said it would have been better had the issue returned to the
high court for a final resolution.
   ``It casts its shadow, and the shadow is negative,'' said
Smolla. ``Other lawyers will aggressively pursue these sorts of
strategies against news organization. The battle isn't over yet.''
   Jane Kirtley, head of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the
Press, said the ruling showed the gag order should never have been
issued in the first place, but she added she was worried about the
precedent set.
   ``The unfortunate effect of that is that a new organization has
been unconstitutionally constrained for several weeks from bringing
information lawfully obtained to the attention of the general
public,'' she said. ``That damage cannot be rectified.''
   CNN's legal problems haven't ended, Noriega's defense attorneys
contend. They want the judge to find CNN in contempt of court for
airing one of the tapes even after the judge's initial ban, and
fine the network $300,000 per violation. The judge has not said
whether he will schedule a contempt hearing.
   Such a hearing could reopen the issue of whether the prior
restraint was permissible, said William Greenhalgh a law professor
at Georgetown University.
   ``Now, it's much ado about nothing,'' he said. ``We've avoided
the constitutional issue - but if there is a contempt proceeding,
then we would really get into it.''
   The tape that touched off the dispute was between Noriega and
one of Rubino's investigators, with the lawyer's Spanish-speaking
secretary serving as an interpreter. In the conversation, Noriega
is asked about two recently arrested Panamanians, and speculates
that prosecutors intend to use them as witnesses against him.
   Rubino went into court Nov. 8 and Hoeveler ordered CNN not to
broadcast any tapes that interfere with attorney-client privilege.
The network aired the tape later that day, but withdrew it the
following day when the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals backed
Hoeveler.
   The Supreme Court then refused to intervene on a 7-2 vote,
forcing CNN to submit the tapes to the judge for review.
   The government has acknowledged routine taping of prisoners'
phone calls at federal prisons, including the Metropolitan
Correctional Center, where Noriega is being held on drug-smuggling
charges. Noriega signed a release acknowledging his calls were
being monitored, but the defense said that release does not apply
to conversations with his attorneys.
   Hoeveler on Wednesday ordered the Bureau of Prisons to cease
sharing Noriega's tapes with other government agencies unless he
approves.
   Following the hearing, the judge returned the tapes to CNN's
attorneys. The judge's clerk said the tape transcripts remained
sealed at the request of the network.
   Rubino has accused President Guillermo Endara's government in
Panama of giving the tapes to CNN after obtaining them from the
U.S. government, ridiculing an ongoing FBI probe of the leak.
   Gregory Craig, an attorney for Panama in that nation's $6.5
billion racketeering lawsuit against Noriega, submitted an
affidavit in that case Tuesday indicating he had received
``information'' from the tapes, including items never broadcast by
CNN.
   Craig strongly denied Wednesday that he had heard the actual
tapes, however, but refused to say whether his information came
from the Panamanian government.
   Noriega is charged with drug trafficking in a February 1988
indictment accusing him of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
the Medellin drug cartel to protect cocaine shipments to the United
States.

<HEAD>Justice Department Opposes Return of Some CNN Documents</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department argues that documents
Cable News Network wants returned may become evidence in the
investigation of the leak of Manuel Noriega's taped prison
telephone calls.
   The court filing by the department on Monday did not say how the
15 documents might be such evidence.
   The documents include a list of telephone numbers apparently
compiled by CNN reporter Marlene Fernandez, the Justice Department
said.
   CNN's Nov. 8 broadcast about Noriega's conversations with his
attorneys and others from a federal prison near Miami triggered a
legal dispute over the network's right to air the tapes.
   The Supreme Court last month upheld a federal judge's temporary
order barring CNN from airing any tapes of conversations between
the deposed Panamanian dictator and his lawyers pending a court
review of the material.
   Last week, the temporary ban was lifted by William M. Hoeveler,
the judge who is presiding over Noriega's drug conspiracy case in
Miami.
   CNN, which played a segment of one conversation in defiance of
Hoeveler's order, has so far not aired any other conversations.
   The Justice Department, meanwhile, is conducting a criminal
investigation into the theft of the tapes, which defense lawyers
say compromised Noriega's ability to get a fair trial.
   In its filing Monday in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, the
Justice Department opposed a motion by CNN for the return of the 15
documents that FBI agents kept following a search of a box
containing material used by Ms. Fernandez in preparing her
broadcasts.
   The box was found abandoned Nov. 12 in a room at the Omni Hotel
and turned over to the hotel's lost and found department.
   The Justice Department noted that it had returned all the other
items in the box to CNN, including 52 documents and five videotape
cassettes labeled ``Noriega Tapes.''
   Copies of the 15 documents the FBI agents kept have also been
furnished to CNN lawyers, the Justice Department said.
   ``All of these 15 documents relate to the FBI's investigation
into the theft of government property,'' the department said in its
brief.
   FBI agent Jeffrey B. Lang said in an affidavit attached to the
pleadings that ``it is entirely likely that in any subsequent
prosecution, the items may well be introduced into evidence.''
   Besides a piece of paper marked ``telephone numbers,'' the
seized material includes a ``Noriega Tapes'' script, several sets
of Noriega transcripts and descriptions of recordings.

   The ratings still begin with a decimal point, but
Cable News Network is standing by its fledgling dinner-time
newscast, ``The World Today.''
   CNN launched the one-hour program in October, starting it at 6
p.m. EST, a time slot in which its second half-hour competes
directly with the nightly newscasts of ABC, CBS and NBC in the
Eastern and Central time zones, where 75 percent of the nation's
viewers live.
   CNN's new show gained some immediate attention with the
selection of Catherine Crier, up until last year a Texas judge, to
join veteran newsman Bernard Shaw at the anchor desk _ Crier in
Atlanta, Shaw in Washington.
   The ratings show they aren't yet in the same league with ABC's
Peter Jennings, NBC's Tom Brokaw and CBS' Dan Rather. Far from it.
   Last week's Nielsens showed ABC's ``World News Tonight'' winning
its eighth consecutive victory with an 11.3 ratings average,
followed by the ``NBC Nightly News'' with a 10.1 average and the
``CBS Evening News'' with a 9.9.
   CNN says its ratings are averaging a .7, but the gap is even
bigger than it looks. In broadcasting, one rating point equals
921,000 homes. In cable, one point for CNN equals 547,820 homes,
the number CNN estimates it serves.
   But CNN says ratings for ``The World Today'' are growing every
month, and already are 16 percent better than the two programs
previously in the same time period.
   ``We're going to move ahead and stick to our game plan,'' said
Paul Amos, CNN's executive vice president of news programming.
``We're not going to abandon this in the short term. This is a very
long-term-oriented project.''
   Amos said the program has proved ``to be the right move ...
because we've managed to take a time period that was relatively
stagnant and improve on it.''
   Among other things, the program will be served _ although not
exclusively _by the new CNN investigative unit headed by Pamela
Hill, who for years was in charge of ABC News' now-defunct
``Closeup'' documentary unit.
   Hill's team, whose reports will start airing this month on CNN
broadcasts, includes former NBC political correspondent Ken Bode,
who signed on Friday as a contributing correspondent.
   Bode, who left NBC News last year to teach, will continue his
other job as a college professor, a CNN spokeswoman said.
   Bode is a print and broadcast news veteran. But not Crier. CNN
took perhaps one of its biggest chances when it hired her for ``The
World Today.''
   Her journalistic debut coincided with the program's, but Crier,
35, a civil judge for five years, said the parallels are
``tremendous'' between her old profession and her new one.
   As a trial lawyer, she said, she gathered facts by interviewing
witnesses and then delivered those facts clearly to a judge or
jury. As a judge, she said, she had to glean facts from piles of
evidence and draw objective conclusions.
   But while a judge might take weeks to weigh a case's evidence
before ruling, Crier said, TV reporting requires an enormous amount
of spontaneity because of its immediacy.
   Amos acknowledged that some at CNN were concerned about Crier's
inexperience.
   ``She was an unknown commodity,'' he said. ``And once she
started working at a computer terminal, Catherine Crier became
another staffer, and the rest of our journalists came to know her
and have warmed up to her.''
   CNN plans to publicize ``The World Today'' this spring with a
major advertising campaign.
   Many viewers have watched their evening news on the same network
for a generation, Amos said, adding, ``a 25-year-old ingrained
habit _ ... that's a tough habit to break.''
   ``It's going to take a long time to make the public aware that
we are here,'' he said. ``Less than 60 percent of the nation's
households have cable or access to the program.''
   __
   Elsewhere in television ...
   RATHER EXAMINES BURNOUT: Thursday's ``48 Hours,'' anchored by
Dan Rather, will examine the human cost of too fast a pace in life
and business in America. Among other things, the CBS show will
report on a California entrepreneur who CBS says ``has turned his
car into the office of the future _ and his life into a
round-the-clock rush hour.''

   A former Texas judge with no news background and
veteran newsman Bernard Shaw will co-anchor Cable News Network's
``The World Today'' when the weeknight news show premieres Monday.
   Catherine Crier, 34, was elected in 1985 as a state district
court judge assigned to Dallas. She resigned last month and became
a CNN staf member Oct. 1.
   The new anchor team was announced Tuesday by CNN, whose new
one-hour program will start at 6 p.m. EDT. The second half hour
will directly compete with the nightly newscasts of CBS, NBC and
ABC, but only in Eastern and Central time zones.
   Those networks, which at 6:30 p.m. EDT give their affiliates the
first of two ``feeds'' of their nightly 30-minute newscasts,
tape-delay those programs for broadcast three hours later on the
West Coast, sometimes updating them with live reports.
   In contrast, CNN's ``The World Today'' will air live nationally.
Crier will co-anchor the program from CNN headquarters in Atlanta,
with Shaw, who has 25 years in news, in Washington, D.C.

<HEAD>CNN To Appeal Noriega Tapes Order to Supreme Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CNN will ask the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a
ban on broadcasting tapes of Manuel Noriega's telephone
conversations with his legal team.
   Constitutional law experts said it could become a landmark case.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said Nov. 11 that the appeal was
being prepared, but he didn't know when it would be filed.
   CNN had defied an order Nov. 9 by U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler of Miami by broadcasting an excerpt in which the deposed
Panamanian dictator spoke in Spanish with a secretary for defense
lawyer Frank Rubino.
   CNN decided for editorial reasons to stop broadcasting the
excerpt early Nov. 10, Haworth said. Later that day, the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta upheld Hoeveler's ruling.
   The appeals court also told CNN to give the seven tapes to the
Miami court so it could decide whether the broadcasts would
endanger Noriega's right to a fair trial on drug-trafficking
charges.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel. He has been held at a federal
prison outside Miami since his surrender to U.S. forces shortly
after the invasion of Panama in December.
   Rubino asked Hoeveler to find CNN in direct civil contempt and
fine the network $300,000 for each time it televised the tapes and
each time it showed them in the future.
   CNN accused Hoeveler of bias and asked him to disqualify himself
from the case.
   Floyd Abrams, a New York constitutional lawyer who served as
co-counsel for The New York Times in the Pentagon Papers case, said
the CNN case could set precedent because rules involving prior
restraint have been very clear through the years.
   ``We've almost totally banned prior restraint,'' Abrams said.
``If the Supreme Court were to uphold the prior-restraint order on
CNN, this would be the first time in our country's history that any
such court order had been affirmed by the court.''
   In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case, the U.S. Supreme Court said
the government could not bar publication of classified documents
about U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The Times appealed rather than
defy a lower court order.
   George Rahdert, a lawyer at the Poynter Institute of Media
Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla., called the CNN case ``an
astonishing illustration of censorship,'' but said the network was
``playing with blasting caps'' by defying the judge's order.
   ``It's rare in general that a news organization of any kind -
broadcast, cable or print - would do such a thing,'' said Rahdert,
who represents several newspapers. ``It really falls into the
category of civil disobedience.''
   CNN President Tom Johnson said the case is a classic
confrontation between the news media and the government they cover.
   He said the district court and appeals court construed the case
as a conflict between the Sixth Amendment, which provides a
defendant a right to a fair trial, and the First Amendment, which
provides for freedom of the press.
   ``There's a more fundamental issue here: reporting the news of
possible governmental misconduct,'' Johnson said. ``If CNN can be
restrained from airing news about the Noriega tapes, so can any
news organization.''
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said U.S. officials wanted
to find out how the tapes were leaked to CNN.
   ``It concerns us greatly that an apparent unauthorized use was
made of these tapes,'' he said.
   Hoeveler said he had to weigh Noriega's right to a fair trial
against CNN's right to freedom of the press.
   ``It's becoming more and more difficult in this case to assure
that both parties get a fair trial,'' he said.
   CNN's broadcast marked the first time the tapes themselves had
been made public, but not the first time their contents were
reported.
   New York Newsday published a story last month based on summaries
of the tapes in which unidentified federal sources said it appeared
the former Panamanian leader was attempting to organize resistance
to the U.S.-supported government of President Guillermo Endara,
which replaced his regime.

<HEAD>Newspapers Ask Appeals Court To Publish Restraint Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCK HILL, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rock Hill Herald and The Charlotte
(N.C.) Observer want an appeals court to publish its opinion
overruling a federal judge's prior-restraint order so it can serve
as a legal precedent.
   ``The opinion in this case, if published, will provide
substantial guidance to lower courts in this circuit, in the event
they are requested, or otherwise inclined, to prohibit the news
media from publishing information properly obtained during open
court proceedings,'' papers filed by the newspapers' lawyers said.
   If the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals does publish its
opinion, it would mean the case could be cited as a precedent in
future prior-restraint cases, said David Robinson II, a lawyer for
The Herald.
   ``There's nothing published of recent vintage that deals with
open court statements and prior restraint,'' Robinson said Nov. 9.
``We think this would be helpful in the future.''
   Unpublished opinions made by the appeals court cannot be cited
in legal proceedings, Robinson said.
   The case began Oct. 31 when U.S. District Judge Charles E.
Simons Jr. inadvertently said in open court in Columbia, S.C., that
Rock Hill attorney Mitchell K. Byrd was a ``target'' of a drug
investigation.
   When Simons was told that reporters from The Herald and the
Observer were in the courtroom, he ordered them not to print his
remark.
   Both newspapers appealed the order and neither printed the name
the following morning.
   The Herald printed the judge's statement about Byrd on Nov. 2
and was later called to court to defend that action.
   On Nov. 6, the appeals court declared the judge's original order
invalid, and Simons dropped his case against The Herald and
canceled the ordered court appearance.
   John Buchan, a lawyer for the Observer, said federal trial
judges are bound by precedents in their circuits and therefore
would be required to follow this order, if published.
   ``Having such a precedent will resolve such issues before they
reach the appellate court, because the laws will be very clear,''
Buchan said.

JUSTICES REFUSE TO ALLOW AIRING OF NORIEGA TAPES;
</P>
<P>
MEDIA: THE ACTION AGAINST CABLE NEWS NETWORK MAY SIGNAL A NEW WILLINGNESS TO
LIMIT PRESS FREEDOM.

<P>
In a decision that may signal new willingness to limit press freedom, the
Supreme Court on Sunday refused to allow Cable News Network to broadcast
government-recorded phone calls between deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel A.
Noriega and his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
The high court on a 7-2 vote let stand an order by a judge in Miami requiring
CNN to turn over the tapes to him for his examination.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court has never formally upheld an order barring the publication or
broadcast of news and information.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's action by the high court is not a ruling on the issue, but rather a
refusal to lift a temporary ban issued Nov. 8 by Judge William M. Hoeveler.
After CNN complies with Hoeveler's order, the justices could later hear a
formal appeal and issue a written ruling.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the court's decision Sunday marked a sharp departure from how
"prior restraint" orders had been treated before. For nearly 60 years, the
court had characterized as "presumptively unconstitutional" any order blocking
a publication.
</P>
<P>
Press attorneys and CNN officials said they were "stunned" by the court's
action and said it amounted to "censorship" of a news organization.
</P>
<P>
In his order, Hoeveler said he was not imposing a "prior restraint" on CNN
because the broadcast ban was only temporary and intended only to give him a
chance to decide whether a permanent ban was needed. The Justice Department
took the same view in briefs filed Saturday, arguing that a "temporary" ban on
publication is not a "prior restraint."
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court issued only a brief order Sunday and did not explain the
reasons for its decision. However, if the justices now accept the view that a
"temporary" ban is not a "prior restraint," it could have a far-reaching impact
on the news media, television broadcasters and book publishers.
</P>
<P>
Under this view, the subject of an unfavorable news story, TV program or book
could seek a judge's order to block its publication or broadcast until the
contents were turned over to the court for examination.
</P>
<P>
Until now, it has been assumed by 1st Amendment lawyers that such court orders,
even if "temporary," are unconstitutional restrictions on the freedom of the
press.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the court would be willing to tolerate a prior restraint in
these circumstances signals a new era in 1st Amendment jurisprudence," said
Jane Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the
Press. "It will have a far-reaching impact going beyond this case extending to
many cases in state and federal courts around the country."
</P>
<P>
Justice Thurgood Marshall, who dissented Sunday along with Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, called the CNN case one of "extraordinary consequence for freedom of
the press." He called the ban that was left intact Sunday a "drastic remedy"
not justified by any potential harm from the broadcast of Noriega's phone calls
from prison.
</P>
<P>
"The issue raised by this petition," Marshall wrote, "is whether a trial court
may enjoin publication of information alleged to threaten a criminal
defendant's right to a fair trial without any threshold showing that the
information will indeed cause such harm and that suppression is the only means
of averting it."
</P>
<P>
Voting against CNN were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron
R. White, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony M.
Kennedy and David H. Souter, the court's newest member.
</P>
<P>
CNN President Tom Johnson called the court's decision "a loss of a battle in a
continuing war against censorship."
</P>
<P>
Johnson said in a statement that the network would immediately turn the tapes
in its possession over to Hoeveler. He said CNN is "confident that after he
reviews them he will decide on the merits to deny the prior restraint.
</P>
<P>
"CNN is committed to establishing its full freedom to telecast newsworthy
information to the American people and it will pursue this case vigorously in
order to do so," Johnson added.
</P>
<P>
Noriega, who is awaiting trial on drug-dealing and money-laundering charges, is
being held in a federal prison near Miami. Federal prison authorities monitor
and tape record all inmates' telephone conversations -- except those between
inmates and their attorneys.
</P>
<P>
But the CNN tape recordings reportedly contain some conversations between
Noriega and his defense lawyers. CNN began airing the tapes last weekend, but
the federal judge slapped an order on the network barring further broadcasts
until he had heard them.
</P>
<P>
The network refused to comply with Hoeveler's order and appealed the question
to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Noriega's defense attorney, Jon May, said Sunday that CNN had opened a
"Pandora's box. This is a case of the messenger shooting itself. To whatever
extent the media may complain this is a significant adverse decision, CNN has
only itself to blame."
</P>
<P>
Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr, who argued the government's case, said in
papers filed Saturday that while the press has a right to freely disseminate
news, the "rule of law" allows a judge in some rare instances to temporarily
preempt publication.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the 1st Amendment does not supersede other laws and did not in
this case provide sufficient cause for undermining the government's
high-visibility drug-trafficking case against Noriega.
</P>
<P>
Starr acknowledged that extended prior restraint may be justified "only in the
most extraordinary circumstances." But, he added, the rule of law demands that
a judge determine whether the current case meets those criteria.
</P>
<P>
"I think this means a fairly important change in the law, definitely a
retrenchment from what they said in the Pentagon Papers case," said Georgetown
University law professor Louis M. Seidman. "After all, the government in that
case was asking for more time to study what is in the papers. I think you'll
see more judges issuing gag orders now."
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the Supreme Court ruled 6 to 3 that the Richard M. Nixon
Administration could not block the New York Times and the Washington Post from
printing the Defense Department's secret history of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
University of Colorado Law Dean Gene Nichol, a 1st Amendment expert, noted that
Sunday's decision shows the loss of Justice William J. Brennan Jr., a staunch
free speech advocate who retired in July.
</P>
<P>
"The court that decided the Pentagon Papers case would not have done this,"
Nichol said.
</P>
<P>
Until now, prior restraints have been considered permissible only in the most
extreme cases, such as to preserve military security during wartime.
</P>
<P>
"Our precedents make unmistakably clear that any prior restraint of expression
comes to this court bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutional
validity and that the proponent of this drastic remedy carries a heavy burden
of showing justification of its imposition," Marshall wrote in his dissent,
quoting from earlier cases.
</P>
<P>
"I do not see how the prior restraint imposed in this case can be reconciled
with these teachings," he said.

   As communications between each of the three major U.S.
broadcast networks and their correspondents in Baghdad were
cut off within the first few minutes after war against Iraq
began last night, only the all-news Cable News Network was
somehow able to maintain contact with its three-member team.
   The extraordinary performance by the crew of Atlanta-based
Turner Broadcasting System Inc. was underscored when NBC News
anchor Tom Brokaw interviewed the CNN correspondents,
including a rival anchor, Bernard Shaw, and reporters Peter
Arnett and John Holliman.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At the conclusion of the brief interview, Mr. Brokaw asked
Mr. Shaw how it was that CNN had telephone contact, while the
other three networks lost touch almost immediately. After a
lengthy pause, Mr. Shaw said he would have to "pass" on
answering. "I'll explain it the next time I see you,
profusely," Mr. Shaw said.
   In Washington, when reporters asked Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney last night what was happening in Iraq, the secretary
replied with a smile that the best information he had about
Baghdad came from CNN.
   CNN is seen live in Baghdad. CNN officials couldn't be
reached to comment on how the network kept its telephone line
open. According to the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings service,
CNN's overnight ratings from 25 major cities jumped an
astounding 271% Tuesday evening, compared with the same night
a week earlier.
   The three major networks instantly switched to previously
announced plans to broadcast round-the-clock coverage of the
war in the Persian Gulf. Only the ABC network, a unit of New
York-based Capital Cities/ABC Inc., broke for commericals,
twice in the first two hours of the coverage.

   CNN's tapes of Manuel Noriega's jailhouse phone
calls to his legal team are in the hands of a federal magistrate
who will help determine whether the former dictator's right to a
fair trial has been jeopardized.
   The network handed over a briefcase full of tapes on Tuesday
after the U.S. Supreme Court refused over the weekend to lift U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler's temporary order barring CNN from
airing the recordings.
   U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff will make and study transcripts
and report to Hoeveler, who as the judge who will preside over
Noriega's trial on drug trafficking charges will weigh a defense
request to dismiss the case.
   Hoeveler assigned Turnoff to listen to the tapes to avoid being
``tainted'' by having learned details of Noriega's defense
strategy.
   No time limit for reviewing the tapes was set, but Noriega's
lead attorney, Frank Rubino, said the judge guaranteed it would
done ``with dispatch.''
   Rubino also asked Hoeveler to set a contempt hearing against CNN
for airing a conversation in alleged violation of the judge's
order. The judge did not immediately set a hearing, saying he must
await a decision by the chief judge of his judicial district on a
CNN request to remove him from the tapes case.
   CNN attorney Steven Korn wouldn't say how many tapes were turned
over. He would not discuss their contents or origins but said he
was confident that the judge will rescind his so-called prior
restraint on broadcast of the tapes.
   He said CNN believes it never violated the judge's order because
the telecast conversations did not deal with matters protected by
attorney-client confidentiality - in part because Rubino tacitly
agreed to broadcasting them when he identified them on the air.
   Noriega has asked that the case against him be dismissed because
of the taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged
government misconduct.
   The fallen dictator is jailed outside of Miami on charges of
taking bribes to protect the cocaine trade. His trial isn't
expected to begin before the spring.

   A federal judge ruled today that court transcripts
of tapes acquired by CNN containing prison conversations of Manuel
Noriega should be made public, but he didn't release them
immediately.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler issued the decision after
four media organizations asked for access to the court documents
last week, saying the public had a right to know the factual basis
of a case that tested the constitutional limits of prior restraint.
   The judge said he would not release the transcripts until
Thursday to allow CNN time to appeal to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Atlanta.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock said he did not immediately know
whether the network would appeal.
   Bienstock argued earlier that releasing the transcripts would be
an ``intrusion into the news-gathering and news-editing process.''
.
   In his 18-page decision, Hoeveler chided CNN for first fighting
to televise the tapes and then seeking to keep the transcripts from
being used by other news organizations.
   The judge said it ``comes as somewhat of a surprise to have CNN,
the forceful proponent of a free press operating without judicial
intervention, return to this court urging that the press and public
be denied a right of access to the very information which CNN has
argued is of immediate public interest.''
   Hoeveler dismissed CNN's contention that it owned the content of
the tapes, saying it was the U.S. government that monitored
Noriega's prison conversations and recorded them, not CNN.
   Karen Kammer, an attorney representing the four media
organizations said she was pleased with the ruling. The
organizations are The Miami Herald, The Associated Press,
Post-Newsweek station WPLG-TV of Miami and Gannett Co. Inc. and USA
Today, which Gannett owns.
   ``I think the court has recognized that the content of the tapes
does not belong to CNN, as we had argued,'' she said.
   Three weeks ago, CNN revealed it had obtained seven tapes of
phone calls made from Noriega's prison cell near here. Federal
prison officials say they routinely tape phone conversations of
inmates unless the prisoner is calling his lawyers, and that all
inmates are made aware of this practice.
   The fallen Panamanian dictator's attorneys went into court Nov.
8 after learning about the tapes and Hoeveler ordered CNN not to
play any that might interfere with attorney-client privilege. The
network played some portions of the tapes for a day, but withdrew
them when a federal appeals court backed Hoeveler.
   The Supreme Court refused to intervene on a 7-2 vote, forcing
CNN to submit the tapes to the judge for review. Transcripts then
were prepared by court officials in Miami to aid Hoeveler and
attorneys in the case in reviewing the contents of the tapes.
   Last week, Hoeveler decided to allow CNN to broadcast the tapes
and returned them to the network, but they were not immediately
aired.
   CNN has not said where it got the tapes, but Noriega's attorneys
said the tapes were released to the government of Panama by the
State Department or the Drug Enforcement Administration and that
Panama gave them to CNN.
   Noriega is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million in
payoffs to protect the cocaine trade.

   Contempt fines levied against CNN should be used to
pay for Manuel Noriega's defense against drug smuggling charges, an
attorney for the deposed Panamanian dictator said Monday.
   On Sunday, the U.S. Supreme Court left intact a federal judge's
temporary order that barred CNN from airing tapes of jailhouse
phone conversations between Noriega and his defense team.
contempt of court hearing against CNN in view of the U.S. Supreme
Court's 7-2 decision.
   The defense has asked for fines of $300,000 per airing of the
conversations, and May said it will ask that money be used for a
Noriega defense trust fund.
   ``We're certainly going to suggest that might be one way of
solving a lot of problems, and I think an appropriate one,
considering the fact that GEneral Noriega's defense was damaged by
CNN,'' May said.
   That could allow NOriega to keep his private defense team even
though his funds have been frozen by federal prosecutors and
foreign governments.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said last week he would
decide soon whether to replace Noriega's private attorneys with
government-paid counsel. The private attorneys have said they
cannot stay on the case without some money.
   STeven Korn, chief counsel for CNN's parent company Turner
Broadcasting System Inc., said the network had no position on how
any fines it might pay should be dispersed because it doesn't
Expect to pay any.
   He said the network never aired privileged conversations under
Hoeveler's order.
   ``I think that point has been lost in the hue and cry,'' Korn
said. He noted that lead Noriega attorney Frank Rubino had
identified and described the conversation on the air, and even
pushed the button on the tape recorder.
   Hoeveler, meanwhile, has set a hearing for Tuesday on how to
proceed with the prison tapes at the center of the CNN-Noriega
dispute.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said Monday the tapes were being
Blown out of proportion.
   ``This is not as grand an issue as it is described as being,''
Lehtinen said. ``I think the taping by the government will be found
to be quite correct. Privileged conversations ... are not
privileged when you get on a phone from a prison, and you know it
is being taped.''
   He said the judge may well rule the tapes are not prejudicial to
Noriega's case.
   May said that such a ruling would neither keep Hoeveler from
Finding CNN in contempt, nor end the gag order.
between attorneys and a client,'' May said.
   Noriega has asked that the case be dismissed because of the
taping, the freezing of his assets, and other alleged government
misconduct, but Hoeveler has not ruled on the issue.
   Noriega is jailed outside of MIami on a drug-trafficking
indictment accusing him of accepting bribes to turn Panama into a
way station for U.S.-bound cocaine shipments. He has been held more
than 10 months and his trial isn't expected to begin before next
spring.

   A federal judge broadened the constitutional issues
in the CNN-Manuel Noriega tapes case Monday, saying basic fairness
could allow him to block broadcast of the defendant's prison phone
conversations.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler cited fairness again in
warning prosecutors to either persuade foreign governments to free
$20 million in frozen Noriega-linked bank accounts to pay defense
lawyers, or appear before him for a hearing aimed at proving the
money was drug-tainted.
   ``I am deeply concerned about the image that this case seems to
be acquiring - that the defendant is not going to be able to get a
fair trial,'' Hoeveler said. ``There's an obvious need by all of us
in a case like this to show that our system, in fact, does work
from top to bottom.''
   On the tapes issue, the judge said transcripts of tapes handed
over by Cable News Network last week were expected to be completed
by late Monday, and will be discussed by all sides in a closed
hearing Wednesday morning.
   Hoeveler said he would rule by Thursday on whether to maintain
his order preventing the network from broadcasting the tapes made
of calls the former Panamanian leader made from his prison cell
outside Miami.
   The judge emphasized he would review all CNN's tapes, not just
those between Noriega and his lawyers. He said an 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals opinion upholding his original gag order allowed
him to consider ``broader questions'' than attorney-client
privilege.
   CNN attorney Terry Bienstock protested, saying the issue should
not include matters such as pretrial publicity because the defense
had not asked for such a ruling.
   Outside the court, he said he was alarmed by the judge's
comments.
   ``It's bad enough that the court's engaging in this process of
pre-publication review,'' he said. ``But it's more disturbing that
the court is going broader than even the litigants are seeking.''
   Noriega's lawyers were pleased with the handling of the tapes,
however.
   ``How the devil can he ever receive a fair trial ... if CNN's
going to play his innermost, private discussions with his lawyers
planning his defense strategy,'' said Frank Rubino, Noriega's lead
attorney.
   In the second part of Monday's hearing, the judge said he would
postpone appointment of government-paid lawyers to replace Rubino's
defense team to give the government another chance to unfreeze
Noriega's foreign bank accounts.
   Prosecutors agreed in June to free the money, but later said
foreign governments had stepped in by filing their own confiscation
orders against the 27 accounts.
   Hoeveler said he would order a hearing on the frozen accounts
within 10 days to determine if the money was illegally earned.
   Noriega is facing up to 145 years in prison on a February 1988
indictment accusing him of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to protect and facilitate their
U.S.-bound cocaine shipments. He is being held at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center outside Miami.

   Ted Turner stole the spotlight from athletes at his
Goodwill Games in Seattle yesterday, picking a new president
for his Cable News Network and conceding that the games
themselves will result in a significantly larger loss than
initially believed.
   W. Thomas Johnson Jr., vice chairman of Times Mirror Co.,
is expected to be formally named CNN's new president this
afternoon, succeeding Burt Reinhardt. The choice is viewed as
reflecting Mr. Turner's desire to recharge the 10-year-old
network and reposition it as a primary channel, or what
people in the television industry call a "top of mind"
network.

   For all its success, CNN has hit a plateau in the past
year. While the network's viewership soars when big new
events break, it ebbs during periods of calm. Moreover, CNN,
once unique in its ability to offer news 24 hours a day, now
faces considerable competition on cable TV.
   Several months ago, Mr. Turner, chairman and chief
executive officer of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., was close to naming Paul Amos, executive vice president
for programming at CNN, as the network's new president,
according to an executive close to the company. But Mr.
Turner decided instead to shake up CNN, retaining both an
executive recruiter and Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc. to study
the network's management and future direction. Mr. Turner has
said his primary concern for CNN has always been editorial
integrity. And Mr. Johnson, as a seasoned newspaper executive
with a major metropolitan daily, possesses strong
credentials.
   Mr. Johnson, a 48-year-old native of Macon, Ga., certainly
answers the call for change at CNN, having spent most of his
career in print journalism. A former White House fellow, he
first came to prominence in 1967, when he was named deputy
press secretary, and later became special assistant, to
President Lyndon B. Johnson. He served as executive vice
president and director of Texas Broadcasting Corp. in Austin
from 1970 to 1973. He started his newspaper career in 1973 as
executive editor and later became publisher of the Dallas
Times Herald, which was acquired by Los Angeles-based Times
Mirror. He was named president of the Los Angeles Times,
Times Mirror's flagship newspaper, in 1977, and became
publisher three years later.
   From Times Mirror's point of view, Mr. Johnson's departure
isn't a complete surprise. Last August, he was succeeded as
publisher and chief executive of the Los Angeles Times by
David Laventhol, Times Mirror's president. Newspaper industry
analysts said at the time that the shuffle seemed geared to
inject the Times with the benefit of Mr. Laventhol's deeper
editorial background and his experience with the recent
growth of Times Mirror's Newsday in New York. The move also
was viewed by some observers as increasing Mr. Laventhol's
chances of eventually succeeding Robert F. Erburu as Times
Mirror's chairman, a post for which Mr. Johnson had once been
viewed as a likely candidate.
   Mr. Johnson, meanwhile, became chairman of the Los Angeles
Times and chairman of Times Mirror's newspaper management
committee, a move that stripped away his day-to-day oversight
of the newspaper. Mr. Johnson said at the time that he was
assuming "broader responsibilities," which included
overseeing companywide marketing, acquisitions and newsprint
supply for Times Mirror's newspaper group.
   Mr. Reinhardt, 68 years old, president of CNN since 1982,
was said in early 1989 to have signed a three-year contract
with Turner Broadcasting, with the understanding that a
search for his successor would soon be started.
   Mr. Johnson's expected move to CNN dismayed several of the
network's executives, according to another executive close to
Turner Broadcasting. At least four CNN executives have been
mentioned as possible successors to Mr. Reinhardt. They are
Mr. Amos, the programming executive; Lou Dobbs, vice
president and managing editor of CNN Business News; Jon
Petrovich, executive vice president of Headline News; and Ed
Turner (no relation to Ted Turner), executive vice president,
newsgathering.
   Asked to comment on Mr. Johnson's selection, Ed Turner,
the executive vice president, said: "Whatever Ted wants. I'll
give Tom Johnson my enthusiastic support. I don't know what
his plans are, {but} it's a relief to get a guy with that
kind of reputation and someone who comes from one of
America's great newspapers." Mr. Dobbs of CNN Business News
said, "It's much too early to judge what the impact will be."
   Most of CNN's top executives are scheduled to meet with
Ted Turner and Mr. Johnson this morning in Seattle.
   Separately, at Turner Broadcasting's annual meeting in
Seattle yesterday, Mr. Turner said he expects the 1990
Goodwill Games loss to be "considerably more" than the $13
million that the company has already charged against earnings
for the event.
   Mr. Turner said losses from the games could climb into the
$26 million range, the amount of Turner Broadcasting's
deficit on the first Goodwill Games in Moscow four years ago.
Mr. Turner's comments marked the company's highest public
projection of Goodwill Games losses to date, and cast doubt
on whether Turner Broadcasting's board will support Mr.
Turner's goal of making the games a lasting, quadrennial
event.
   "The board will decide whether to go forward," Mr. Turner
said.
   Before the games opened here Friday, Turner Broadcasting
executives had said this year's games must show progress from
1986, both financially and in terms of their image as a
world-class sporting event. A strong field of athletes has
showed up to compete, but the Olympic Games knock-off has
evidently failed to arouse the requisite enthusiasm among
advertisers and television viewers to stem Turner
Broadcasting's losses.
   In other business at the annual meeting, Turner
Broadcasting's board declared a 2-for-1 split of its Class A
and Class B shares, payable Sept. 4 to stock of record Aug.
13. As of last month, Turner Broadcasting had approximately
49.6 million Class A common shares and about 26.8 million
Class B common shares outstanding.
   In another matter, a shareholder nominated the actress
Jane Fonda, a close companion of Mr. Turner's, for election
to the company's board. The nomination never came to a vote,
but it spawned an aside from Mr. Turner. "Miss Fonda has
enough influence," he said.

   Cable TV magnate Ted Turner on Tuesday named
former Los Angeles Times publisher Tom Johnson as the new president
of his Cable News Network, effective Aug. 1.
   Johnson called himself ``a strong champion of hard news'' who
will try to expand CNN's overseas bureaus. He will succeed Burt
Reinhardt, 70, CNN's president since 1982, who has been with the
network since its start ten years ago.
   Johnson, who joined the Times in 1977 and now is its chairman
and vice-chairman of the parent Times Mirror Co., said he'd first
spoken with Turner about the new job less than a month ago.
   Johnson, whom Turner said was introduced to him by a mutual
friend, said that during his first six weeks at work he'd just
listen and learn. He plans no sweeping changes at CNN, he added:
   ``I am not a believer in Saturday night massacres. I believe in
working with the people who are in place.''
   He and Turner, chairman of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting
System, spoke at a telephone news conference from Seattle, site of
the Goodwill Games sports festival that TBS is sponsoring at a
possible loss of $26 million.
   Turner said he made the change because Rheinhardt is 70 ``and
everybody's got to retire some time.''
   Turner emphasized that he has no plans to sell CNN, nor any
plans ``to merge or jointly gather news with any other U.S. news
organizations.''
   NBC several years ago proposed buying part of CNN, but backed
out when Turner refused to give up editorial control of the 24-hour
news organization.
   Johnson, a former White House fellow, was President Johnson's
special assistant in 1968. He was the Times' publisher for nine
years until succeeded last August by David Laventhol, president of
Times Mirror Co.
   Johnson said he's leaving the Times because ``quite frankly, it
was time for a change...I'm looking forward to getting back to
running a media organization.
   ``I feel much more comfortable in a quarterback role than I do a
coaching role,'' he said, alluding to his current jobs in Los
Angeles.
   Asked about his seeming lack of TV experience, Johnson noted
that others have made the transition from print to broadcasting,
including Walter Cronkite and Richard C. Wald, a senior ABC News
execuutive and former NBC News president.
   He also said that he has some experience in broadcasting, having
worked for two years as executive vice president of Texas
Broadcasting Corp., whose holdings included station KBTC-TV in
Austin.
   The company was owned by Lyndon Johnson's family until the
former president's death in 1973.
   CNN says it has 1,700 full and part-time staffers, is seen in 55
million U.S. homes, and has viewers in 90 countries.
   Reinhardt, who CNN says plans to retire later, will become vice
chairman of CNN and advise Johnson during a transition period.
   Johnson also will serve as Turner Broadcasting System's vice
president for news and as a member of TBS' executive committee. He
will report directly to Turner.
