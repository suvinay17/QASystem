Even before Miami knocked off top-ranked Notre Dame, 27-10, Saturday night, the
Hurricanes and Fighting Irish accepted bids to New Year's Day bowl games.
</P>
<P>
However, seventh-ranked Miami's victory over the Irish spoiled the Orange
Bowl's hoped-for showdown for the national championship between Notre Dame
(11-1) and second-ranked Colorado (11-0), which earned an automatic berth by
winning the Big Eight Conference championship outright for the first time since
1961.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Athletic Director Dick Rosenthal said the Irish accepted the Orange
Bowl bid because they haven't played in the New Year's Night game since 1975.
Rosenthal said the Fighting Irish also considered bids from the Sugar, Cotton,
Fiesta and Citrus Bowls.
</P>
<P>
Because the game is at night, the Orange Bowl could still get its showdown if
things break just right earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Colorado last played in the Orange Bowl in 1977, when it was Big Eight
co-champion. Nebraska or Oklahoma has been the conference representative at
Miami every year since.
</P>
<P>
Miami (10-1) accepted a bid to play the Southeastern Conference champion --
either No. 4 Alabama (10-0), No. 10 Auburn (8-2) or No. 8 Tennessee (9-1) -- in
the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
The SEC runner-up, or possibly an SEC co-champion that does not go to the Sugar
Bowl, will play in the Cotton Bowl against ninth-ranked Arkansas (9-2), the
Southwest Conference champion.
</P>
<P>
Third-ranked Michigan (10-1) joined No. 12 USC (8-2-1), the Pacific 10
Conference champion, in a rematch at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena by beating Ohio
State, 28-18, to clinch the Big Ten Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
Ohio State (8-3) will play the odd team out in the SEC on Jan. 1 in the Hall of
Fame Bowl at Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
Fifth-ranked Florida State (8-2), the only team to beat Miami, will play No. 6
Nebraska (10-1), which lost only to Colorado, in the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 1 at
Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
No. 15 Clemson (9-2) will play No. 17 West Virginia (9-2) Dec. 30th in the
Gator Bowl at Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
Big Ten runner-up and 11th-ranked Illinois (9-2) and Atlantic Coast Conference
co-champion Virginia (10-2), No. 16, accepted bids to play in the Florida
Citrus Bowl on New Year's Day. Illinois lost only to Michigan and Colorado.
Virginia lost only to Notre Dame and Clemson.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Bowl was hoping to invite Indiana and its All-American running back
Anthony Thompson, but the Hooisers were upset, 15-14, Saturday by Purdue. So
the game at Anaheim Stadium will have Florida (7-3) and Emmitt Smith against
Washington (7-4).
</P>
<P>
No. 22 Penn State (7-3-1) accepted an invitation to the Holiday Bowl Dec. 29
against BYU after beating No. 19 Pitt, 16-13.
</P>
<P>
'It won't be 16-13 (in the Holiday Bowl)," Paterno said. "Maybe (BYU Coach)
LaVell Edwards will take it easy because I'm his buddy. . . .
</P>
<P>
"Or maybe we'll throw and he'll run," added Paterno, drawing laughter because
the suggestion went contrary to the teams' offensive philosophies.
</P>
<P>
No. 21 BYU (10-2) clinched the Western Athletic Conference championship and the
automatic berth in the Holiday Bowl that goes with it by beating San Diego
State, 48-27, Saturday night at Jack Murphy Stadium in San Diego -- site of the
Holiday Bowl.
</P>
<P>
Despite its defeat, Pitt (6-3-1) will play No. 14 Texas A&amp;M (7-3) in the
John Hancock Bowl Dec. 16 at El Paso.
</P>
<P>
Georgia (6-4) will play Syracuse (6-4) in the Peach Bowl at Atlanta Stadium on
Dec. 30. Georgia and Syracuse each has one game remaining -- Georgia at
archrival Georgia Tech and Syracuse against Louisville in Tokyo. Both games are
next weekend.
</P>
<P>
No. 25 Michigan State (7-4), with losses to Miami, Notre Dame, Michigan and
Illinois, won its fifth consecutive game Saturday, 31-3, over Wisconsin, to
earn a spot in the Aloha Bowl on Christmas Day against No. 24 Hawaii (8-2) in
Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi (7-4) beat Mississippi State, 21-11, Saturday and accepted a bid to
the Liberty Bowl on Dec. 28 at Memphis, Tenn., against Air Force (8-3). The
Falcons were eliminated from the WAC race and Holiday Bowl consideration by
BYU's victory.
</P>
<P>
Arizona (6-4-1), by beating archrival Arizona State, 28-10, on Saturday, will
stay at home in Tucson to play North Carolina State (7-4) in the inaugural
Copper Bowl on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
In the Independence Bowl, Tulsa (6-5) will play Oregon (7-4) at Shreveport,
La., on Dec. 16
</P>
<P>
No. 18 Texas Tech (8-3), despite a 40-24 loss to 13-ranked Houston on Saturday,
will face No. 23 Duke (8-3) in the All-American Bowl on Dec. 28 at Birmingham,
Ala.
</P>
<P>
Houston (8-2) is on NCAA probation for recruiting violations and is ineligible
for post-season play.
</P>
<P>
Fresno State (9-2), champion of the Big West Conference, will play Ball State
(7-2-2), the Mid-American Conference titlist, in the California Raisin Bowl on
Dec. 9 at Fresno.

weekend's bowl negotiations  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  COLLEGE; FOOTBALL; CHAMPIONSHIP; GAME; ANALYSIS  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  The Pick 'Em Day that college football's bowls have given themselves to extend
invitations remains nearly a week away, but Notre Dame's upset loss to
Tennessee on Saturday has ended some of the suspense.;   Some, that is, but
not all. Early deals struck between schools and bowls in recent years ruined
the chance of concocting the best postseason match-ups. There also were a few
bowls burned by teams who, after being locked up, plummeted in the rankings.
That prompted the first-ever Pick 'Em Day next Sunday, which is when bowls are
allowed to open negotiations with the schools of their choice.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  FIRST COLLEGE BOWL 'PICK 'EM DAY' TAKES SHAPE,
THANKS TO IRISH'S LOSS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  College Football; See also related story on P. 11D of this section  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     That doesn't preclude the bowls from talking about their favorites,
however, which is why Notre Dame's loss clarifies what the possible big bowl
match-ups are.;   The benefactors of the Fighting Irish's demise included the
Orange Bowl and quite possibly Cal, which moved up one spot to No. 6 in the
latest Associated Press poll after the Bears' 27-14 win Saturday over Oregon
State.;   The Orange Bowl, with its enticing $4.2 million payoff, is almost
certain now to get the winner of Saturday's showdown between No. 1 Florida
State and No. 2 Miami. The Big Eight Conference champion, which will be No. 11
Nebraska or No. 16 Colorado, will have the dubious honor of filling the other
half of the bill.;   If the 'Canes lose, they could go to the Sugar, Cotton or
Fiesta. If the Seminoles fall, the Sugar is out because FSU already will have
played Florida, which has clinched at least a tie for the Southeastern
Conference title and the automatic Sugar Bowl berth that goes with it.;
Irish loss helps Orange Bowl; Had Notre Dame (8-2) been in position to finish
10-1, Fiesta Bowl officials hoped to match a top-five-ranked Irish team
against the No. 1 Seminoles. The loss to Tennessee dropped Notre Dame to
16th.;   "Now that Notre Dame has been beaten, I think very clearly that means
we'll get the No. 1 team," said Orange Bowl President Harper Davidson. "We
heard from certain sources that the players at Florida State said, 'We've got
to go play Notre Dame if they're in the Fiesta Bowl.' Maybe the administration
didn't feel that way, but you have to listen to the kids. Now that Notre Dame
lost, that's no longer an issue.";   Cal may cause time switch; Fiesta Bowl
officials did not return phone calls Sunday, but a bowl source said they were
meeting to discuss the possibility of exchanging television times with the
Hall of Fame Bowl. The only reason they would want to do that is to invite
Cal. The Pacific 10 Conference prohibits its teams from appearing on
television simultaneously; the Rose Bowl, which is between the Pac-10 and Big
Ten champions, airs on ABC at 2 p.m. (PST) on Jan. 1, while the Fiesta is
scheduled to kick off at 1:30 on NBC. NBC has the Hall of Fame scheduled for
10 a.m.;   Notre Dame still has options; Who might the Bears face? No. 8 Penn
State is supposedly the other part of the Fiesta's hastily re-hashed dream
match-up. As for Notre Dame, it says a lot about the program's drawing power
that the Irish should be able to choose between the Cotton and Sugar, even if
they lose this week to Penn State.;   "Notre Dame is not going to get left
out, even with an 8-3 record," Cotton Bowl President John Stuart said. "I
think they'd like to go where they recruit, which would either be the Sugar or
Cotton.";   Sugar may already have Irish; A rumor surfaced Sunday that Notre
Dame already had made an agreement to take the Sugar's payoff of $3.65 million
payoff over the Cotton's $3 million. The Cotton Bowl's next choice to face the
Southwest Conference champion -- which is likely to be Texas A&amp;M -- would be
No. 7 Alabama, Stuart said.;   Although Stuart did not discuss the rumor, he
did say teams have been trying to strike deals with bowls before Sunday's 2
p.m. time to start negotiations. The reason the bowls created the Nov. 17 date
-- with a penalty of $250,000 for anyone found jumping the gun -- was to
prevent themselves from doing the same thing. With the NCAA having lifted its
restrictions, however, schools are allowed to discuss their preferences with
bowl officials.;   Schools hold cards now; "I'm told," Stuart said, "that
several teams have told several bowls, 'We're not going to play in your game.'
It has to do with money, location and how high the opponent is ranked.";   If
that's true, then Pick 'Em Day has stopped bowls from pitching deals to
schools -- and prompted the schools to do the pitching instead.  </TEXT>

BOWL COMMITTEES PAY THE PRICE FOR ACTING TOO EARLY

The timing is just wonderful. The college football bowl system, already under
siege from those who lust after a national playoff (Four teams! Eight teams!
16! 64! Play until February!) has completely embarrassed itself this fall,
lowering its pursuit of attractive matchups to untold depths and, in the
process, leaving itself at the mercy of late-season upsets. Which it is
getting, by the fistful.
</P>
<P>
Is this a surprise? In a season that began with Miami of Florida losing to
Brigham Young and followed with Notre Dame falling to Stanford, Colorado losing
(should have, anyway) to Missouri, Virginia first reaching No. 1 and then
immediately falling from it . . . can we be shocked that after all the bowl
hands were shaken, Notre Dame should lose to Penn State at home and, less
dramatically, Virginia should be beaten by Maryland? Come now.
</P>
<P>
Still, the bowl folk went ahead and rolled their dice, sealing up all the
December and January arrangements two weeks before Nov. 24, the NCAA's official
invitation date. By last Sunday, it was known that Notre Dame will play
Colorado in the Orange Bowl, Virginia will play the Southeastern Conference
champion in the Sugar Bowl and Miami will meet the Southwest Conference winner
(probably Texas) in the Cotton Bowl -- along with 16 other matchups. And that
was that. Three weeks to go in the season and the bowls were set.
</P>
<P>
Then came Saturday. Notre Dame's 24-21 loss guaranteed that the Orange Bowl's
pure national championship scenario is dead. Colorado will be ranked No. 1, but
the Irish, 8-2 with a deadly late-season loss, will drop into the second five
and have no shot.
</P>
<P>
The Sugar Bowl gambled on Virginia, which had captured No. 1 and the country's
attention (great academics, lovely setting, Thomas Jefferson, all that) before
folding in the spotlight against Georgia Tech and being exposed Saturday at
home against Maryland. How many teams look better than the Cavaliers now?
Twenty? But the Sugar Bowl is stuck with them, probably against a Tennessee
team with four non-victories (two losses and two ties).
</P>
<P>
If the bowls had the courage to take control of a system they created, they
could play this silly autumn game from strength and not from desperation. What
the colleges have done is play the bowls' insecurity against them and squeeze
early invitations (and big per-team guarantees) out of them. Each of the bowls
that isn't tied to a conference lives in fear of being left without a viable
matchup.
</P>
<P>
without Notre Dame).
</P>
<P>
The NCAA has rescinded, effective next year, the bowl invitation date. That's a
good idea, because people paid it less attention than "Cop Rock." On the down
side, bowls will be able to line up games whenever they please, which means
that we can get Notre Dame and Miami committed to the Fiesta Bowl next October.
And then watch each lose twice in November.
</P>
<P>
The bowls can handle this if they wish to show just a touch of spine. They have
a useful system, which often has produced a lively debate and a defensible
national champion. It's better, if handled correctly, than a playoff that
extends a season that's already too long. If the bowls had not been so quick to
jump this fall, they might have matched No. 2 Miami with No. 1 Colorado in the
Orange Bowl, Texas with Notre Dame in the Cotton and Penn State with Tennessee
in the Sugar. Guys, do one thing next year: Wait.

VIRGINIA HAS SCHEDULE OF A CHAMPION

<P>
Of the remaining undefeated teams with a chance at the national championship
(sorry Fresno State), it appears that Virginia has the easiest path to an 11-0
season.
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are no sure thing, but compared to unbeaten Notre Dame, Florida
State, Nebraska, Tennessee and Auburn, they have the most accommodating
schedule. Incidentally, Houston, Oklahoma and Florida are not included in this
list of undefeated teams because they aren't eligible to compete in bowls this
season.
</P>
<P>
Now then, consider each team's most difficult remaining opponents:
</P>
<P>
NOTRE DAME -- Miami, Pittsburgh, Tennessee, Penn State and USC. Three of the
five games are on the road.
</P>
<P>
FLORIDA STATE -- Miami, Auburn, Louisiana State and Florida. The Miami and
Auburn games are on the road.
</P>
<P>
NEBRASKA -- The Cornhuskers still have to play Oklahoma at Norman, Okla., and
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
TENNESSEE -- Florida, Alabama and Notre Dame. All three games are at home, but
the Gators are tough; Alabama is Tennessee's fiercest rival, and Notre Dame is
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
AUBURN -- Florida State, Florida, Georgia and Alabama. If the Tigers can get
past Florida State, they still have the Gators, at Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
VIRGINIA -- North Carolina State, Georgia Tech and Maryland. Not exactly
murderer's row, is it? All three are home games, which doesn't make them
gimmes, but . . . Fast-improving Georgia Tech could be a problem.
</P>
<P>
Virginia's rise to No. 4 in the Associated Press poll is important to the
Cavaliers for two reasons:
</P>
<P>
 -- It's the highest football ranking in the school's history.
</P>
<P>
 -- It could change the entire bowl picture. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
When the Atlantic Coast Conference, of which Virginia is a member, signed a
four-year contract with the Florida Citrus Bowl in the summer of 1988, a
stipulation was included in the agreement. It read that in the first and third
years of the contract, the ACC champion was committed to the Citrus Bowl and
vice versa. In the second and fourth years, the Citrus Bowl has the option of
inviting the ACC champion or another team. This is year No. 3.
</P>
<P>
But -- and this is where it gets interesting -- a national championship
contingency exists. The Citrus Bowl can opt out of the agreement if it can
match the No. 1-ranked team against No. 2, 3 or 4. Likewise, the ACC champion
-- and let's say it's Virginia -- can opt out of the deal if its ranked no
lower than fourth and can play the No. 1 team for the national title.
</P>
<P>
One catch: The ACC champion can leave the Citrus only for the Sugar Bowl,
Cotton Bowl or Orange Bowl. That's because the Citrus has no chance at the
Southeastern Conference, Southwest Conference or Big Eight champions, all of
which are tied to the aforementioned three bowls.
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta Bowl is off-limits because the Citrus considers it direct
competition. The Fiesta has no conference tie-ins.
</P>
<P>
"If all the bowls would have a similar agreement, we'd have a national
championship game every year," said Chuck Rohe, executive director of the
Citrus Bowl.
</P>
<P>
Not so fast. The Citrus Bowl will pay a projected $1.35 million to $1.5 million
to its teams this year, which is considerably less than what a school could
expect to earn by playing in, say, the Sugar Bowl, Cotton Bowl or Orange Bowl.
According to Rohe, if the Citrus has a chance at keeping Virginia for a
national title contest, they would ask ABC, which is broadcasting the New
Year's Day game, to increase the rights fee. ABC isn't under any obligation to
do so, but you can bet it would if a championship game -- and championship
ratings -- were available.
</P>
<P>
No one really expected Florida to be able to strike a deal with the NCAA's
Committee on Infractions, did they? The Gators basically wanted to devise their
own punishment for past rules violations. Fat chance.
</P>
<P>
Recent NCAA sanctions against Florida, 4-0 this season, prohibit a bowl
appearance after the 1990 season. Outraged Gator officials wanted to trade 12
football scholarships for the chance to accept a bowl bid and bowl money. The
committee heard Florida's appeal last weekend, but wasn't swayed. "(A
university) can ask the Committee on Infractions whatever it wants to," the
NCAA's David Berst said.
</P>
<P>
Berst agreed the request was unusual. Not since 1952 has the NCAA removed an
announced penalty.
</P>
<P>
There is one solution to Florida's problem: Don't cheat.
</P>
<P>
How seriously do they take their football at Alabama? When the Crimson Tide
lost its first three games of the season, radio disc jockeys in Birmingham,
Ala., and Tuscaloosa, Ala., began giving air time to "Dig Him Up," an awful
ballad about retrieving the legendary Bear Bryant from his coffin.
</P>
<P>
Nobody, especially new and beleaguered Alabama Coach Gene Stallings, deserves
that sort of misguided abuse.
</P>
<P>
And those sightings of Danny Ford at Alabama can be disregarded. Stallings is
safe. Ford, a former Crimson Tide player who was forced out as Clemson's coach,
is a welcome visitor, said Alabama Athletic Director Hootie Ingram.
</P>
<P>
The coach who should be worrying is Mississippi State's Rocky Felker. Ford has
been mentioned as a possible replacement for that struggling program.
</P>
<P>
Pat Dye's decision to play for a tie against Tennessee continues to receive
mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Constitution columnist Steve Hummer listed a few of Dye's favorite
things. Favorite food: Thai. Favorite storm: typhoon. Favorite cowboy lyric:
"Yippie Tie Yie Yay." Favorite player: Ty Detmer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors agreed with the Auburn coach's move.
And for what it's worth, so did Virginia's George Welsh.
</P>
<P>
After Virginia Tech nearly upset No. 2-ranked Florida State at Tallahassee,
Fla., Hokie quarterback Will Furrer asked a Richmond Times-Dispatch reporter:
"Did we earn enough respect to get in the ACC?" Virginia Tech, which gained 411
yards against the Seminoles, desperately wants an ACC invitation. It shouldn't
hold its breath.
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech isn't the only school that wants to jump on the ACC bandwagon.
The Fiesta Bowl, Orange Bowl and newly approved Sunshine Bowl are all talking
to the conference about an agreement once the Citrus Bowl deal ends after the
1992 game.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the Citrus Bowl is pushing for an extension.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to published reports, the Orange Bowl will not automatically follow
Miami to whatever conference it might eventually join. "There's no commitment
like that," said Bob Roller, Orange Bowl communications director. "They're not
trailing Miami."
</P>
<P>
It can't, mainly because the bowl's contract with the Big Eight runs through
Jan. 1, 1995. The only way the agreement is voided is if any team leaves the
conference.

<HEADLINE>  BOWLS ANNOUNCE THEIR CHOICES
BUT, AS USUAL, EVERYONE KNEW WELL IN ADVANCE WHO
WOULD GO WHERE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Mercury News Staff Writer Ric Bucher contributed to this report.; Chart

<TEXT>     "To me, that was a farce," he said Sunday after the Hurricanes accepted a
bid from the Orange Bowl.;   "The bowl matchups were made I don't know how
long ago.";   Of course, nothing was supposed to be decided until noon PST
Sunday. Bowls are subject to a $250,000 fine for breaking the deadline, but no
fines have been announced.;   The bowl selections have left some schools
disappointed and frustrated.;   No. 17 Notre Dame, despite a two-game losing
streak, will play No. 5 Florida in the Sugar Bowl.;   After Saturday's 35-13
victory over Notre Dame, several Penn State players were bitter that the bowl
deadline was broken to their detriment.;   "We thought that we should have
gone to the Sugar Bowl," wide receiver O.J. McDuffie said. "But if it's the
Fiesta, we're happy. We wanted a New Year's Day bowl game and got one. We're
satisfied.";   Cal also felt squeezed out of the Sugar Bowl picture.;   "I
think the only thing that is being hurt by that is the Sugar Bowl," said Cal
senior tight end Brent Woodall.;   "They are taking a team with a lesser
record. If they wanted to have the best game possible, they would have taken
the team with the highest ranking, and that's us.";   Cotton Bowl president
John Stuart said, "There's no perfect system -- you've got to start with that.
It's going to take a while to work all the kinks out.;   "From the fans'
standpoint, I hope it's going to get better.";   Next year things will change
as the bowl alliance begins. The Orange, Cotton, Sugar, Fiesta and Citrus have
aligned with five conferences and Notre Dame to divide the spots. The Rose
Bowl, which has not produced an undisputed national champion since Southern
Cal in 1972, is tied to the Big Ten and the Pacific 10.;   Which of the
consortium's five bowls hosts the best game is determined by the rankings of
the champions of the Southwest, Southeastern and Big Eight Conferences. The
bowl connected with the highest-ranked champion -- the Sugar has the
Southeastern, the Cotton has the Southwest, and the Orange has the Big Eight
-- picks first from among the at-large teams. If the highest-ranked matchup is
among the at-large teams, then the Fiesta would host the premier game.;   But
even this solution won't solve all the problems.;   There would be nothing to
prevent the Sugar Bowl from selecting based on television ratings instead of
national rankings again, as it did this year by working out a deal with Notre
Dame instead of a higher-ranked team.;   "That's one of those items we'll just
have to feel out," Stuart said. "I think it happened this season for one
reason and one reason only -- they had to turn on TV sets. . . . I just see
the chances of stability as much greater."; BOWL GAMES AT A GLANCE; Bowl/

   Top-ranked Notre Dame defeated No. 3 West Virginia 34-21 in the
Fiesta Bowl to give the Fighting Irish their eighth national
championship in college football and the first since 1977.
   Notre Dame's Tony Rice, a junior, threw for two touchdowns and a
career-high 213 yards as the Irish finished the season undefeated at
12-0.
   In other bowl games Monday, No. 11 Michigan upset No. 5 Southern
California 22-14 in the Rose Bowl; No. 9 UCLA beat No. 8 Arkansas
17-3 in the Cotton Bowl; and No. 13 Clemson edged No. 10 Oklahoma
13-6 in the Citrus Bowl.
   Seventeenth-ranked Syracuse defeated No. 16 Louisiana State 23-10
in the Hall of Fame Bowl; No. 2 Miami defeated No. 6 Nebraska 23-3
in the Orange Bowl; and No. 4 Florida State defeated No. 7 Auburn
13-7 in the Sugar Bowl.
   Notre Dame's victory assured it of the top spot in the final
Associated Press poll.
   Rice completed seven of 11 passes, including a 29-yard scoring
strike to Raghib Ismail late in the second quarter and a 3-yard pass
to Frank Jacobs early in the fourth quarter.
   West Virginia, which finished 11-1, had to be satisified with the
first 11-victory season in its 96-year football history.

AUBURN'S WIN REDUCES FIELD OF CONTENDERS FOR NATIONAL CHAMP TITLE

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
And then there were four.
</P>
<P>
Auburn's 30-20 victory over previously unbeaten Alabama dropped the Crimson
Tide from No. 2 to No. 7 in the rankings and left only four teams in contention
for college football's national championship: Colorado, Miami, Michigan and
Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
Colorado remained on top for the second straight week in today's Associated
Press poll, and Miami rose two spots to second. Michigan remained No. 3 and
Notre Dame moved up one notch to No. 4.
</P>
<P>
Miami, Michigan and Notre Dame each finished the regular season with one loss;
Colorado is the only undefeated team in Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
Because of the New Year's bowl match-ups, those are the only teams with a
realistic chance to win the national title. Colorado plays Notre Dame in the
Orange, Alabama meets Miami in the Sugar and Michigan faces 12th-ranked USC in
the Rose.
</P>
<P>
Colorado can claim the championship by beating Notre Dame. If Notre Dame wins
and Miami and Michigan lose, however, the Fighting Irish would almost certainly
be voted No. 1.
</P>
<P>
Miami, which snapped Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak two weeks ago, needs a
win over Alabama and a Colorado loss to capture its third national championship
of the decade.
</P>
<P>
Although Michigan is ranked third, it will be very difficult for the Wolverines
to finish on top. They need an impressive win over USC, a Miami loss in the
Sugar Bowl and a close Notre Dame victory in the Orange Bowl to have any
chance. Even then, the Irish would probably get the nod because they would have
beaten the No. 1 team and because they defeated Michigan 24-19 at the start of
the season.
</P>
<P>
Colorado received 55 first-place votes and 1,492 of a possible 1,500 points
from a nationwide panel of sportswriters and broadcasters. Miami got four
first-place votes and 1,407 points, and Michigan received the other first-place
vote and 1,374 points. Notre Dame's point total was 1,323.
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the Top 10 are Florida State, Nebraska, Alabama, Tennessee, Auburn
and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Florida State, which has won nine straight since opening the season with two
losses, moved up one place to fifth after beating Florida 24-17 Saturday.
Nebraska, which was idle, went from No. 7 to No. 6, Tennessee stayed No. 8
after defeating Vanderbilt 17-10, Auburn jumped two places to No. 9 after its
victory over Alabama, and Arkansas fell one spot to No. 10 after a 38-24 win
over Southern Methodist.
</P>
<P>
Illinois is 11th, followed by USC, Houston, Clemson, Virginia, Texas A&amp;M,
West Virginia, Penn State, Brigham Young, Duke, Ohio State, Michigan State,
Hawaii, Pittsburgh and Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
Other than Illinois, which dropped one spot, all of those teams held the same
position as the previous week.

its first national championship in college football today.;    The Buffaloes,

<TEXT>     Colorado (11-1-1) and Georgia Tech (11-0-1) were ranked 1-2 going into the
bowls, and they remained that way after the bowls. The Yellow Jackets beat
Nebraska 45-21 in the Citrus and finished as the only major unbeaten team, but
they couldn't overtake a Colorado squad that finished the season with 10
straight wins.;    "What a tremendous moment it is for our school, our kids,
the state of Colorado and the city of Boulder," Colorado Coach Bill McCartney
said.;    Colorado received 39 first-place votes and 1,475 points, while Tech
got 20 first-place votes and 1,441 points. The 34-point margin was the
fifth-closest since AP went to a permanent postseason poll in 1968.;    Miami,
which demolished Texas 46-3 in the Cotton Bowl, rose from fourth to third with
one-first-place vote and 1,388 points. The Hurricanes (10-2) fell just short
of becoming the first team in college football history to finish first or
second for five consecutive seasons.;    Florida State (10-2) jumped from
sixth to fourth after beating Penn State 24-17 in the Blockbuster Bowl, and
Washington (10-2) climbed from eighth to fifth following a 46-34 victory over
Iowa in the Rose Bowl.;    Notre Dame (9-3) fell from fifth to sixth. Rounding
out the Top 10 were Michigan (9-3), Tennessee (9-2-2), Clemson (10-2) and
Houston (10-1).;    Penn State finished 11th, followed by Texas, Florida,
Louisville, Texas A&amp;M, Michigan State, Oklahoma, Iowa, Auburn, Southern
California, Mississippi, Brigham Young, Virginia, Nebraska and Illinois.;
Colorado is only the second team to win the national championship with a loss
and a tie since the AP started its poll in 1936. Alabama won the title after
the 1965 season with a 9-1-1 record. No team has been voted national champion
with two losses.;    The last time the only unbeaten team didn't win the
national title was 1982. Southern Methodist went 11-0-1 that season, but
finished second in the final poll behind 11-1 Penn State.;    The national
championship is the first for Colorado in any sport except skiing, where the
Buffaloes have collected 12 titles.;    When the Buffaloes got off to a 1-1-1
start, their chances of winning the title seemed remote. But they turned their
season around with consecutive wins over Texas and Washington and a
controversial fifth-down victory over Missouri. Those tough tests may have
helped prepare the Buffaloes for the Orange Bowl, where they overcame the loss
of starting quarterback Darian Hagan.  </TEXT>

So many bowls, so few great teams.
</P>
<P>
Consider:
</P>
<P>
 -- Not one undefeated and untied team will play in a bowl this season.
</P>
<P>
 -- Only Brigham Young, among the bowl candidates, can win 11 regular-season
games.
</P>
<P>
 -- Only seven others have a legitimate chance at 10 victories, and one of
those teams, Notre Dame, has to play Tennessee, Penn State and USC. Colorado
can win 10, but it will have played 12 games and also benefited from the
infamous fifth-down victory over Missouri.
</P>
<P>
 -- Only eight are likely to win nine games, and that might be a generous
estimate.
</P>
<P>
 -- Only seven will probably manage eight victories and only seven are likely
to win seven games.
</P>
<P>
 -- If projections hold true, nine other bowl candidates will have only six
victories.
</P>
<P>
There are 19 bowls and, at the moment, about 40 teams available to fill those
38 openings. Invitations are supposed to be presented on Nov. 24, but nobody
has ever accused bowl officials of paying attention to their calendars.
</P>
<P>
Presenting our best guesses . . .
</P>
<P>
The Big Five:
</P>
<P>
 -- Orange Bowl. Colorado vs. Notre Dame or Miami, but the Hurricanes will be
invited only if Notre Dame loses to Tennessee Saturday.
</P>
<P>
 -- Sugar Bowl. Southeastern Conference champion (probably Tennessee) vs.
Michigan, Notre Dame or Miami.
</P>
<P>
 -- Cotton Bowl. Southwest Conference champion (probably Texas, since
undefeated and untied Houston is ineligible) vs. Miami, Notre Dame or Michigan.
</P>
<P>
 -- Fiesta Bowl. Virginia vs. Penn State.
</P>
<P>
 -- Rose Bowl. Washington vs. Big Ten champion (probably Iowa).
</P>
<P>
The Medium Six: Citrus -- Georgia Tech vs. Nebraska; Gator -- Auburn vs. Ohio
State; Holiday -- Western Athletic Conference champion (probably Brigham Young)
vs. Texas A&amp;M; Hall of Fame -- Clemson vs. Illinois; Liberty -- Army vs.
Minnesota or Indiana; Blockbuster -- Florida State vs. Ohio State or
Louisville.
</P>
<P>
The Rest: Copper -- Wyoming vs. California; John Hancock -- Michigan State vs.
USC; Freedom -- Colorado State vs. Oregon; Peach -- North Carolina State or
Mississippi vs. Indiana or Minnesota; All-American -- Louisville vs. Alabama;
Aloha -- Syracuse vs. Arizona; California -- San Jose State or Fresno State vs.
Central Michigan; Independence -- Baylor vs. LSU or Southern Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
Teams on the bubble: Texas Christian and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
As usual, Notre Dame is the center of attention. A victory over Tennessee will
allow the Irish to delay a commitment and help the Sugar Bowl's chances of
landing Notre Dame. An Auburn or Mississippi vs. Notre Dame game remains a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
If Houston finishes the season undefeated and untied, Cougar fans are calling
for Associated Press voters to crown the team as national champion. Four
questions:
</P>
<P>
 -- Does a team on NCAA probation deserve to be eligible for a national title?
</P>
<P>
 -- Should a team be voted No. 1 without playing a bowl game?
</P>
<P>
 -- Should a team whose schedule includes Eastern Washington, Nevada Las Vegas,
Southern Methodist, Rice, Texas Tech, Arizona State, Arkansas -- who have a
combined record of 21-40 and only one of these seven, Eastern Washington (5-4),
has a winning record -- be seriously considered as national championship
material?
</P>
<P>
 -- Would the best team in the country allow Texas Christian's second-string
quarterback to throw for an NCAA-record 690 yards against it?
</P>
<P>
Answer: A No. 1 vote for Houston, undefeated and untied or not, is a vote
wasted.
</P>
<P>
One more Houston item: We don't have a Heisman Trophy ballot, but if we did, we
wouldn't penalize Houston quarterback David Klingler for directing a
run-and-shoot offense that produces outrageous point and yardage totals.
</P>
<P>
To do so would be the same as penalizing quarterback Ty Detmer for BYU's
intricate passing attack, or Darian Hagan and Eric Bieniemy for Colorado's
option offense, or Raghib Ismail for Notre Dame's plan to get him the ball --
by pass, handoff or special teams -- at least 20 times a game. Offensive
systems and philosophies are nice, but without the right players, they flop.
</P>
<P>
We also wouldn't dismiss Klingler as a leading candidate simply because former
Cougar Andre Ware won the Heisman last year. One doesn't average more than four
touchdown passes and 443 yards a game, as Klingler has this season, by
accident.
</P>
<P>
And for those critics who say the run-and-shoot is designed for short gains,
think again. Of Klingler's seven touchdown pass plays last week against TCU,
six of them traveled 35 yards or more -- 36, 42, 46, 59, 80 and 88.
</P>
<P>
Klingler should consider himself lucky. Heisman candidate Shawn Moore,
Virginia's multitalented quarterback, was scheduled to appear on NBC's "Today
Show" last Monday. But after the Cavaliers were upset by Georgia Tech, the
network called Sunday and canceled the request. Never mind that Moore accounted
for four Virginia touchdowns in the loss. Instead, Ismail and Klingler were
interviewed. All in all, a classless move by NBC to omit Moore.
</P>
<P>
Nothing against the Virginia sports information department, but it pushed the
wrong Moore for the Heisman. Herman, not Shawn, is the best Cavalier player
and, according to Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross, the best wide receiver in the
country. He caught nine passes for 234 yards and one touchdown Saturday. Moore
has at least one touchdown reception in his last 10 games and 15 of his last
16.
</P>
<P>
And for what it's worth, Kentucky Coach Bill Curry, whose son plays for
Virginia, said that Cavalier Coach George Welsh had no choice but to kick a
tying field goal against Georgia Tech with 2:34 remaining. The alternative: a
fourth-and-goal situation at the Yellow Jacket six-yard line.
</P>
<P>
"I would have done the same thing," said Curry, who attended the game. Of
course, Georgia Tech got the ball back, drove down the field and kicked a
game-winning field goal. As for Curry, he couldn't have been too upset. After
all, he's a Georgia Tech graduate and a former Georgia Tech head coach.
</P>
<P>
How tough was it to get a ticket to last Saturday's game at Charlottesville,
Va.? Well, as part of Virginia's annual basketball scrimmage, musician Bruce
Hornsby and actor Woody Harrelson of "Cheers" fame agreed to serve as honorary
coaches. Hornsby, who received no cash appearance fee, later said that one of
the reasons he accepted the coaching invitation was the promise of a
Virginia-Georgia Tech football ticket. He got one. . . . Alabama isn't going to
win the SEC, but it might win six games, which is an accomplishment considering
that the Crimson Tide lost their first three this season. The Tide hasn't
allowed a touchdown in 12 quarters. . . . Louisville is ranked in the AP poll
for the first time in 18 years.
</P>
<P>
After 21 years as a college coach, Notre Dame's Lou Holtz will take his No.
1-ranked team to Knoxville, Tenn., and 91,110-seat Neyland Stadium for the
first time Saturday. Already, Holtz has called several colleagues, including
former Alabama coach Ray Perkins, and asked how to deal with the deafening
crowd noise.
</P>
<P>
"I figure I'll call until I find someone who has something nice to say about
it," Holtz said. "Everybody says don't go unless you absolutely have to."
</P>
<P>
Holtz already has instructed team managers to play the song, "Rocky Top," a
Tennessee band favorite, during each of the Notre Dame practices this week. For
two hours, the song is played again and again. Notre Dame players leave the
workouts humming the tune. "I went to sleep last night and I could hear it,"
cornerback Todd Lyght said.
</P>
<P>
Said Holtz of Notre Dame's No. 1 ranking: "I have never worried about No. 1. We
have a chance to be No. 1. But there are 10-15 teams who have a better chance
to be No. 1."
</P>
<P>
Grace Tower is the tallest dormitory on the campus at South Bend, Ind. Whenever
the Irish are first in the polls, a No. 1 sign is placed atop the building.
Holtz suggested that the person in charge of hanging the sign might want to
keep his tools handy.
</P>
<P>
"That guy's upset," Holtz said. "He knows he might have to go up there in bad
weather and take it down."
</P>
<P>
Our top 10: (1) Notre Dame, (2) Colorado, (3) Washington, (4) Houston, (5) BYU,
(6) Miami, (7) Iowa, (8) Tennessee, (9) Texas, (10) Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
Our waiting list: Florida, Nebraska, Mississippi, Florida State and Virginia.

<P>
Notre Dame staked a claim to its 14th national football championship, and the
roses went to Michigan as the glut of college bowls wound up with an
extravaganza of seven games Monday.
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked Fighting Irish completed the first 12-0 season in their storied
football history with a 34-21 victory over third-ranked, previously undefeated
West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl at Tempe, Ariz., and the 11th-ranked
Wolverines rallied in the second half to beat fifth-ranked USC, 22-14, in the
75th Rose Bowl at Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
Ninth-ranked UCLA upheld the honor of the Pacific 10 Conference, winning a
record seventh straight bowl game by downing eighth-ranked Arkansas, 17-3, in
the Cotton Bowl at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Miami, Florida State Win
</P>
<P>
In night games, No. 2 Miami, which lost only to Notre Dame, routed No. 6
Nebraska, 23-3, in the Orange Bowl at Miami, and No. 4 Florida State held off
No. 7 Auburn, 13-7, in the Sugar Bowl at New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
In other games, No. 13 Clemson beat No. 10 Oklahoma, 13-6, in the Florida
Citrus Bowl at Orlando, Fla., and No. 17 Syracuse dominated No. 16 Louisiana
State, 23-10, in the Hall of Fame Bowl at Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame will likely receive its first national title since 1977 today when
the Associated Press' final poll of the media is released. Coach Lou Holtz will
join Irish coaches Frank Leahy, Ara Parseghian and Dan Devine in winning
national titles in their third seasons at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
Leahy won in 1943, 1946, 1947 and 1949, Parseghian in 1966 and 1973, and Devine
in 1977. Knute Rockne won six other national titles before the AP poll began in
1936.
</P>
<P>
Junior quarterback Tony Rice led the way for Notre Dame, passing for two
touchdowns and a career-high 213 yards. Rice also rushed for 75 yards.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame built a 23-6 half-time lead, and West Virginia (11-1) had to settle
for the first 11-victory season in its 96-year football history.
</P>
<P>
USC (10-2) had a 14-3 half-time lead but was overpowered by Michigan (9-2-1) in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Second Victory in Nine Trips
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler only his second victory in nine
trips to the Rose Bowl and marked the first time the Big Ten had won
consecutive Rose Bowls since the 1964-65 seasons.
</P>
<P>
Michigan State defeated USC, 20-17, last year.
</P>
<P>
Michigan fullback Leroy Hoard rushed for 142 yards and scored two
fourth-quarter touchdowns. Hoard put the Wolverines ahead, 15-14, with a 1-yard
touchdown run early in the final period, then locked up the victory with
another 1-yard scoring run with 1:52 left. He set up the last touchdown with a
61-yard gain to the Trojan 9.
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Rodney Peete, frustrated most of the game by the Michigan defense,
scored for USC on runs of 1 and 4 yards.
</P>
<P>
UCLA (10-2) used the efficiency of quarterback Troy Aikman and an overpowering
defense to become the first school ever to win bowl games in seven consecutive
seasons -- all with Terry Donahue as coach -- before a partisan Arkansas crowd
of 74,304.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Several Bowls Involved
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' victory streak also includes three Rose Bowls, a Fiesta Bowl, an
Aloha Bowl and a Freedom Bowl.
</P>
<P>
Aikman completed 19 of 27 passes for 172 yards and a touchdown, and converted
12 of 20 third-down situations into first downs. Freshman Shawn Wills gained
121 yards in 18 carries against the Razorbacks (10-2).
</P>
<P>
The Dallas Cowboys are expected to make Aikman the first player chosen in the
National Football League draft. Cowboy personnel director Gil Brandt
congratulated Aikman under the goal posts after the game.
</P>
<P>
However, it was the UCLA defense that carried the day, holding Arkansas to 42
yards of offense and four first downs.

ACC MAY GET SQUEEZED OUT OF CITRUS UNLESS N.C. ST. WINS TITLE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MARKUS, BALTIMORE SUN
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saturday's Virginia-North Carolina State game in Raleigh, N.C., could go a long
way toward determining this year's Atlantic Coast Conference champion.
</P>
<P>
But only a victory by the Wolfpack would realistically keep the ACC in the
running for a bid to the Florida Citrus Bowl in Orlando. The ACC is in the
second year of a four-year deal with the Citrus Bowl, a contract that
stipulates that in years Nos. 2 and 4, the bowl's selection committee can go
outside the league for a host school as long as it can get a higher-ranked
team.
</P>
<P>
As of this week, North Carolina State is only ranked 18th.
</P>
<P>
"If there's a significant difference in the rankings (between North Carolina
State and a non-ACC school), we'll lean toward the higher-ranked team," Chuck
Rohe, the Citrus Bowl's executive director, said this week. "It doesn't put the
ACC in a bind."
</P>
<P>
As part of the agreement, the Citrus Bowl will inform the ACC of its plans by
Nov. 15, which is 10 days before the bowl invitations can be announced. But
North Carolina State, which plays at Duke next week, appears to be the only
team from the conference to be a realistic contender. Clemson, which beat
Oklahoma in the Citrus Bowl last season, is ranked 21st.
</P>
<P>
ACC Commissioner Gene Corrigan said he gets a phone call every Monday morning
from Citrus Bowl officials to update him. Though he admits the ACC is in a
difficult situation, considering the number of strong teams in the Southeast
this season, he says the league contenders will continue to get serious
consideration from the Citrus Bowl.
</P>
<P>
"Unless all the teams fall apart," Corrigan said. "At this time of year,
everybody is looking way beyond what they're going to get. As you get closer to
the end, things become more realistic."
</P>
<P>
The jockeying for position is heating up. Consider some of these possibilities:
</P>
<P>
 -- Right now, the Orange and Sugar bowls appear to be the leading contenders
for the national championship game. Though it has generally been assumed since
Notre Dame beat Michigan back in September that the game would be played
between the Fighting Irish and the Big Eight champion in Miami, that no longer
seems to be certain.
</P>
<P>
"They will have played in the Orange Bowl (against Miami Nov. 25), and it's not
a pleasant thing for them," said Don Meyers, chairman of the Fiesta Bowl's
selection committee. "It's going to be nasty this year. If they win, that's
great, but they don't want to go back. If they lose, they certainly don't want
to go back."
</P>
<P>
 -- The one problem with Notre Dame accepting a Sugar Bowl invitation is
waiting to see if Alabama finishes unbeaten. The Crimson Tide won't end its
season until a Dec. 2 visit to Auburn.
</P>
<P>
"Let's say Notre Dame stays undefeated and Colorado stayed undefeated," Sugar
Bowl executive director Mickey Holmes says. "Then let's say Alabama gets
through its Southern Mississippi game (Nov. 18) undefeated. Then Notre Dame
would have a decision to make between us and the Orange Bowl. I think the idea
of playing Alabama would have a lot of appeal for Notre Dame."
</P>
<P>
Saturday's game between host second-ranked Colorado (8-0) and third-ranked
Nebraska (8-0) has an interesting quarterback duel. Both Damian Hagan of the
Buffaloes and the Cornhuskers' Gerry Gdowski have a chance to run for 1,000
yards and throw for 1,000 yards this season. It has been done three times: by
Bart Weiss of Air Force in 1985, Reggie Collier of Southern Mississippi in 1981
and Drake's Johnny Bright in 1950.
</P>
<P>
For last week's trip to Oklahoma, Colorado had a first-class airplane seat, a
spot at the training table and a locker kept empty in memory of its late
quarterback, Sal Aunese, who died of stomach cancer in September. Even more
eerie was the way Aunese's number (8) figured into the story line. The victory
gave Colorado an 8-0 record. It was head coach Bill McCartney's 88th game in
his eighth year at Colorado and the school's 888th game overall.
</P>
<P>
In last week's 20-3 victory over Oklahoma, the Buffalos were penalized when
injured Colorado running back Eric Bieniemy ran onto the field to celebrate
with his teammates after one of the touchdowns. Bieniemy, who is sidelined with
a broken fibula, is listed as questionable for this week's showdown.
</P>
<P>
McCartney said, "We're not going to play him if he's limping. He wants to play.
I'm going to have to chain him to the bench if I don't let him play."
</P>
<P>
Iowa State coach Jim Walden has opinions on nearly everything, so it wasn't
surprising for him to make his own prediction about the Colorado-Nebraska game.
"Nebraska's got to throw the ball and they're not going to want to," Walden
said. "If you don't throw the ball on Colorado, they're going to beat you into
submission."
</P>
<P>
The eating habits of some other Big Eight coaches came into question this week.
When asked about the difference between being a head coach and an assistant,
Kansas State's Bill Snyder said, "Eating. I don't eat lunch or dinner when I'm
at work. I don't eat breakfast. I eat one meal when I go home."
</P>
<P>
That might be one meal more than Kansas' Glen Mason is going to get at home for
a while. When told of Snyder's comments, Mason said, "I don't go home to eat.
If you ate my wife's cooking, you wouldn't go home to eat, either."
</P>
<P>
Forget about eating. Mason might be living in his office after those remarks.
</P>
<P>
One week after Minnesota's Fred Foggie ran back a blocked field goal 98 yards
against Indiana, Illinois strong safety Quintin Parker broke the short-lived
Big 10 record. Parker's 100-yard runback of a blocked extra point in last
week's 32-9 victory over Wisconsin, which was worth two points (a defensive
point after touchdown), also set the National Collegiate Athletic Association
record.
</P>
<P>
It took three years, but Ohio State quarterback Greg Frey finally got back at
an old high school rival. Seems that when both he and Minnesota's Scott
Schaffner were high school seniors in Cincinnati, Frey threw for 487 yards for
St. Xavier in a game against Schaffner's Moeller team. Moeller won, 56-42.
</P>
<P>
In last week's 41-37 victory for the Buckeyes, a game in which they came back
from a 31-0 second-quarter deficit, Frey threw for 327 yards, three touchdowns
and a pair of two-point conversions. Ohio State equaled an NCAA record for the
largest comeback, set by Maryland in a 1984 win over Miami.
</P>
<P>
"I've been in some pretty wild ones, especially that one against Moeller," Frey
said. "I'm glad I played the way I did. I had something to make up for."
</P>
<P>
Quote of the Week: "They really are good on defense." Georgia Coach Ray Goff on
Temple, which is 0-8 and giving up 41 points and 393 yards a game.

<TEXT>  Television/radio: CH3 CH4 CH8/KNBR (680).; Records: Colorado is 10-1-1. Notre
Dame is 9-2.; Rankings: Colorado is No. 1; Notre Dame No. 5.; Colorado report:
A win today would give the Buffaloes the national title. Last season, a 21-6
loss to Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl spoiled Colorado's bid for a national
title. This season, the Buffaloes say they aren't awed by the Irish mystique.
"I think maybe we were satisfied just getting here last year, and we let it
slip through our fingers," All-America G Joe Garten said. . . . WR Mike
Pritchard is expected to play despite a broken left hand. All-America LB
Alfred Williams has been slowed by bronchitis.; Notre Dame report: The Irish
have an outside shot at the national title but will need help. If Notre Dame
beats Colorado, No. 2 Georgia Tech loses to Nebraska and No. 3 Texas falls to
No. 4 Miami, it probably would come down to another close vote between the
Irish and the Hurricanes. NT Chris Zorich, this season's Lombardi Award
winner, might see limited action after suffering a dislocated kneecap late in
the season.; Players to watch: Colorado -- RB Eric Bieniemy (1,628 yards
rushing, 5.7 average); QB Darian Hagan (1,538 yards passing, 442 rushing).

Winners and losers in this year's bowl sweeps:
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
From New Year's Day giant to scapegoat. Organizers came very close to canceling
the game because of the polarization caused by the defeated Martin Luthur King
Jr. holiday referendum. They even considered a move to Jack Murphy Stadium in
San Diego, but that was shot down by the NCAA. Just as well: It would have been
a public relations and logistics catastrophe. Making matters worse, the Fiesta
wanted Notre Dame; it got Louisville. A banner week, it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: Copper Bowl.
</P>
<P>
See Fiesta Bowl. The NAACP already has condemned California for accepting an
invitation to play in the Tucson-based bowl. Not exactly the sort of publicity
the Copper Bowl folks were hoping for.
</P>
<P>
 -- Winner: Virginia.
</P>
<P>
When Iowa and Illinois were beaten last Saturday, thus giving every team in the
Big Ten at least two losses, the idea of inviting the conference runner-up
became less appealing to the Sugar Bowl selection committee. Enter the
Cavaliers, who solved all sorts of problems -- theirs and the Sugar Bowl's --
by accepting the bid to travel to New Orleans. Virginia, which previously had
been considering the Fiesta Bowl, earns about $700,000 more by playing in the
Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
 -- Winner: Southern Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
The 25th-ranked Golden Eagles, previously destined for the Independence Bowl
and a fun-filled stay in, uh, Shreveport, La., upgraded to the All-American
Bowl. The payout -- $600,000 -- is the same, but Southern Mississippi gets ESPN
instead of Mizlou and a Dec. 28 playing date rather than Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
Beware of purple bandwagons.
</P>
<P>
 -- Winner: Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
The Cornhuskers panicked and committed themselves to the Citrus Bowl long
before they needed to. Turns out to be a great move, especially now that
Georgia Tech, ranked No. 4, is the only undefeated team.
</P>
<P>
 -- Loser: Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
The Rebels, ranked 15th, have a good team but little television appeal. Nor are
they known for bringing lots of fans to bowls. Then again, Ole Miss has been to
only four bowl games in the last 20 years. The Sugar Bowl is praying the Rebels
don't win the Southeastern Conference title and receive the automatic bid to
New Orleans. The Fiesta Bowl has its choice of the non-SEC winner and, given
its druthers, would take Auburn, Alabama or Tennessee before inviting Ole Miss.
Too bad. The Rebels are worth watching.
</P>
<P>
 -- Winners: Notre Dame, Colorado, Louisville and Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame and Colorado get a national championship rematch.
</P>
<P>
Louisville gets a $2.5-million Fiesta Bowl paycheck, compared to the $600,000
payout it would have received from the All-American Bowl. The Cardinals' first
bowl game since 1977 is a New Year's Day game. Their first television
appearance since 1983 is on a major network. Of course, there might be a price
to be paid for the decision to venture to Arizona. We'll see.
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech gets a chance to win a national title if several things happen,
including another regular-season loss by Notre Dame, followed by an Irish
victory over Colorado in the Orange Bowl. Georgia Tech would then need to
wallop Nebraska in the Citrus Bowl. Hey, a similar scenario worked for Miami
last year.
</P>
<P>
The SEC considered pulling its teams out of Fiesta Bowl contention -- but not
for long. Two reasons: The decision to play was one for the university
presidents to determine; and the SEC office saw nothing morally wrong with
accepting a Fiesta Bowl bid.
</P>
<P>
"The general consensus of a lot of people in our conference is that it's
preposterous to hold the Fiesta Bowl accountable for the actions of the
voters," said Brad Davis, SEC assistant commissioner. "Those of us here in the
South are used to the broad swath of indicting everyone for the actions of some
people. You've got to cut through the grandstanding of the situation and really
look at the facts.
</P>
<P>
"I mean, where do you stop?" Davis said. "Does an institution not play a bowl
in California because (the state) might have a very liberal abortion law? Is
the SEC office in Birmingham held accountable because the state capitol in
Montgomery flies a rebel flag?"
</P>
<P>
Davis said he expects the SEC to be criticized for participating in the Fiesta
Bowl. "We're going to take some hits on it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wave goodby to the NCAA rule requiring bowl selection committees to wait until
Nov. 24 to extend official invitations. Dick Schultz, NCAA executive director,
said he expects the deadline to be abolished at the organization's convention
in January.
</P>
<P>
"It's a ridiculous rule," Schultz said.
</P>
<P>
Bowls can be penalized by the NCAA for ignoring the current rule, but it never
happens. By never formally inviting a team until Nov. 24, the selection
committees avoid punishment.
</P>
<P>
If the NCAA has its way, the bowl people themselves will determine their own
date, if any, for extending bids. And as usual, the bowl people, as they do now
under the current format, will disregard the guidelines and arrange
"unofficial" matchups.
</P>
<P>
"The bowl association will try to come up with some sort of self-regulation
that would hopefully attempt to keep some sense of order to the selection
process, not that there's much now," said John Reid, executive director of the
Holiday Bowl.
</P>
<P>
"The most likely to be injured are the schools that come on strongly at the end
of the season."
</P>
<P>
One other thing to remember about next season: As a safeguard of sorts, a team
must beat at least six Division I-A opponents to be eligible for a bowl. That
means the minute a team such as Notre Dame wins that sixth game, bowl scouts
will be there with pens poised.
</P>
<P>
For those clamoring for a Division I-A football playoff system, take heart.
Schultz said one is on its way.
</P>
<P>
"It's just my own personal feeling, but I think that we'll have one before the
decade is over," he said. "But I think it will be later in the decade, rather
than earlier in the decade."
</P>
<P>
Schultz said he envisioned a playoff that would, at first, include only two or
four teams.
</P>
<P>
When listing the nation's best running backs, don't forget to include Army's
Mike Mayweather among the candidates. Colorado's Eric Bieniemy, Notre Dame's
Raghib Ismail and Washington's Greg Lewis get most of the publicity, but
Mayweather deserves mention, too. He rushed for 129 yards against Air Force
last Saturday, which gives him eight 100-yard games this season and 21 in his
career. . . . Virginia receiver Herman Moore isn't expected to return for his
final year of eligibility. Moore, who has caught touchdown passes in an
NCAA-record nine consecutive games, hasn't revealed his decision, but all
indications point to first-round status in the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
Our top 10: (1) Notre Dame, (2) Colorado, (3) Georgia Tech, (4) BYU, (5) Miami,
(6) Texas, (7) Florida, (8) Virginia, (9) Washington, (10) Florida State.
</P>
<P>
Our waiting list: Ohio State, Louisville, Penn State, Mississippi, Houston.

Hurricanes' 202 yards in penalties fresh on his mind.;    By halftime of their
46-3 rout of Texas, the Hurricanes had already set a Cotton Bowl record for
yards penalized, with 132. Athletic Director Sam Jankovich, who is leaving to
take control of the NFL New England Patriots, sent a message to Erickson in

<LEADPARA>  Colorado was voted the No. 1 college football team in the land Wednesday by
the Associated Press in the poll that counts most widely.;    But when various
other polls were taken into account, the Buffaloes and Georgia Tech split the
vote for the national championship, renewing calls for an NCAA playoff system.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  COLORADO WINS A SPLIT DECISION
AP PICKS BUFFS, BUT UPI DOESN'T  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     After nipping Notre Dame 10-9 in the Orange Bowl on Tuesday night, Colorado
(11-1-1) won the final Associated Press poll handily, beating Georgia Tech
(11-0-1) in first-place votes 39-20.;    But the Yellow Jackets, who defeated
Nebraska 45-21 in the Citrus Bowl on Tuesday, edged Colorado 847-846 in the
final United Press International coaches' poll announced six hours later.
Georgia Tech received 30 first-place votes and Colorado 27 in the UPI list.
Neither school had finished No. 1 in a major poll.;    The next four teams
were identical in both polls -- Miami third, Florida State fourth, Washington
fifth and Notre Dame sixth.;    It's the first time the two major wire-service
polls have disagreed on the national champion since 1978, when the AP picked
Alabama and UPI picked Southern Cal. Sixty sportswriters and broadcasters vote
in the AP poll, which is printed by more newspapers and other media outlets,
including the Mercury News, and is considered by most as the primary source
for rankings. The UPI poll has an air of authenticity, however, because its
teams are selected by 59 Division I-A coaches. In the 41 years the polls have
co-existed, they have picked different champions eight times at season's end.;
   Colorado Coach Bill McCartney and Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross, along with
their players, said they hoped a playoff would be available to decide future
seasons.;    "I'm just like the rest of you. When I see that NCAA basketball
tournament bracket with 64 teams, I can't wait to see them play it all off,"
said McCartney, whose team won its second Big Eight Conference title in a row
this season. "I love the Final Four and all of that, and I think something
like that would be great for college football. When you put something like
this up to a vote, there's no way it can satisfy everybody. You just can't
satisfy everybody without a playoff.";    Ross, whose team was Atlantic Coast
Conference champion, said: "A playoff system would be good. I've been a
supporter of that from day one. But I'd like to see it devised through the
bowl system, because they have been so good to us.";    Georgia Tech
cornerback Willie Clay said, "I wish the system was better. It's hard when
someone else controls your fate. . . . We were just upset because we never had
a chance to play Colorado one-on-one.";    Although McCartney and Ross were
willing to share the pie, neither was completely satisfied. (Each voted for
his own team in the UPI poll; Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz said he had voted
Colorado No. 1.);    "We played the most difficult schedule in Division I-A,"
McCartney said. "We came into the Orange Bowl ranked No. 1, and we won. The
margin of victory is not the issue. The issue is who wins or loses. Just
beating Notre Dame is enough to hang your hat on for the national
championship.";    Countered Ross: "I'm disappointed that we weren't named No.
1 in the AP poll." The coach then outlined why his squad should have won that
vote, too.;    "One, we are the only undefeated team in the country, and that
should say something," Ross said. "Two, 10 of the 12 teams we played this
season had winning records. Three, there has been a lot of criticism regarding
the strength of the ACC. I think the conference was vindicated, however, by
the teams' performance in bowl games. They did very well (3-1-1) in those
games. Four, I felt that we played Nebraska in a comparable way to that of
Colorado (the Buffaloes won 27-12 at Nebraska). On that basis, our undefeated
record should atone for any difference.";    In most seasons, the lone
unbeaten team in the field has more or less inherited the national
championship. The last time the only unbeaten team didn't sweep the
national-title wire polls was in 1982, when an 11-0-1 Southern Methodist team
finished second in both major polls behind 11-1 Penn State.;    Miami, a 46-3
winner over Texas in the Cotton Bowl, can take some solace from the fact that
the New York Times' computer picked Miami No. 1, Georgia Tech No. 2 and
Colorado No. 3. It arrives at its ranking by figuring in scheduling strength,
locations and recency of games. It is purposely skewed more toward
end-of-the-season results. But the Times' computer does not boast nearly the
weight of the AP and UPI votes.;    In the other minor polls besides the
Times', Colorado was named to the top spot by USA Today/CNN, the National
sports daily and the National Football Foundation.;    Colorado's loss (23-22
to Illinois) and a tie (31-31 with Tennessee), made the Buffaloes' record
among the worst for a national champion, and a controversial fifth-down
victory over Missouri also won't add to the team's historical legacy.;
Colorado, which ended its season with 10 straight victories, became only the
second team to win the AP title with both a loss and a tie since the AP
started its poll in 1936. Alabama took the 1965 title with a 9-1-1 record. No
team has been voted national champ with two losses. Georgia Tech's only
blemish was a 13-13 tie with North Carolina in Chapel Hill, N.C.;  THE FINAL

NOTRE DAME: SENIORS STEP FORWARD IN BEATING TENNESSEE. SMITH'S INTERCEPTION
NEAR GOAL LINE THWARTS COMEBACK.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Neyland Stadium scoreboard flashed the obvious: No. 1-ranked Notre Dame 34,
No. 9-rated Tennessee 29.
</P>
<P>
But those are numbers, not reasons. What the lights couldn't do was detail the
moments -- all significant, some not obviously so -- that preceded the Irish
victory.
</P>
<P>
Take last week. Little-used cornerback Rod Smith, exiled to the bench after the
season opener against Michigan, noticed Coach Lou Holtz watching a hand-held
television as the team bus left Giants Stadium after the Irish's lackluster win
over Navy.
</P>
<P>
"Any scores, Coach?" Smith said.
</P>
<P>
Holtz turned around and quickly forgot about the postgame shows.
</P>
<P>
"Rod Smith -- just the man I wanted to see," Holtz said.
</P>
<P>
Holtz told Smith that another week's worth of good practice sessions would earn
him a starting assignment against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, sir," answered Smith, who floated back to his seat.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Smith intercepted a last-minute pass at the Irish two-yard line
that sealed Notre Dame's victory.
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't really supposed to be in that position," he said.
</P>
<P>
As if Holtz cared.
</P>
<P>
And what about tailback Ricky Watters, seemingly banished after fumbling balls
away to Stanford and Miami?
</P>
<P>
So low was Watters that flanker/tailback Raghib (Rocket) Ismail offered a pep
talk. "Things will come around," Ismail said that day. "It will come back to
you."
</P>
<P>
Little moments.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, Holtz had told his seniors that they alone would determine the fate
of this team. Watters, a fourth-year guy, didn't know if that meant a return to
the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
Now he does, as do the Volunteers and a sellout audience of 97,123, who saw
Watters leave cleat marks on undersized defenders. He ran for 174 yards,
including a 66-yard dash that saw the field littered with three would-be
Tennessee tacklers. In all, Notre Dame gained 316 rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
"Earlier in the season, I was trying too hard," Watters said. "Thing was, I was
hurting this team. (Today) I just said, 'I'm not going to stop.' "
</P>
<P>
Evidence? Watters averaged 10.2 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
Then there is nose tackle Chris Zorich, who limped around the Notre Dame campus
last week. A partially dislocated right kneecap was to blame.
</P>
<P>
Zorich, a senior and captain, was sidelined against Navy, but he had no
intention of missing the game against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
First he had to convince Holtz, who granted Zorich's wish to play after
watching him in pregame warmups. Zorich, who played every other series,
recorded only one tackle. But it was the thought that mattered.
</P>
<P>
"Every time I put my right foot down I was in pain," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked to measure his playing capacity, Zorich didn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
"About 5%," he said.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame's much-maligned defense played better when Zorich was on the field.
And Zorich, along with linebacker Michael Stonebreaker, administered the
sideline fire-and-brimstone lecture to his teammates when there were hints of a
premature celebration.
</P>
<P>
"We were very upset," said Zorich. "This was for everything. But everybody was
unbuckling their chinstraps."
</P>
<P>
Not for long, they weren't. Shortly after Ismail's 44-yard touchdown run put
Notre Dame ahead, 34-23, with 3:33 remaining, Tennessee staged a frenzied
comeback.
</P>
<P>
It started with a 10-play drive that began at the Volunteer 32-yard line and
ended with quarterback Andy Kelly finding wingback Alvin Harper open in the end
zone. The defender? Rod Smith.
</P>
<P>
"He got fooled a couple of times," Stonebreaker said.
</P>
<P>
Kelly, who completed 35 of 60 passes for 399 yards, a Tennessee record, then
tried for the two-point conversion. His pass to Vince Moore failed.
</P>
<P>
An onside kick came next. Notre Dame sent out its "hands" team, made up mostly
of receivers and defensive backs. Tennessee hoped for a minor miracle.
</P>
<P>
It got one when the ball took a hard, unpredictable bounce and was recovered by
Tennessee's Carl Pickens at the Volunteer 46.
</P>
<P>
Five plays later, with about 50 seconds left to play, Tennessee had first and
10 at the Notre Dame 20. Kelly dropped back, looked for Harper, who already had
caught two touchdown passes, and threw. Harper was open -- or so it appeared.
But the ball was slightly underthrown, Smith intercepting.
</P>
<P>
"If I had gotten the ball a little higher, (Harper) would have scored," Kelly
said. "But there's no question that the defensive man made a good play breaking
on the ball."
</P>
<P>
After the game, Orange Bowl officials scurried to the Notre Dame locker room
and extended yet another unofficial invitation. Colorado, which will probably
be ranked second after this week's poll, awaits.
</P>
<P>
The Irish (8-1) said they would need to sleep on it.
</P>
<P>
"It's up to them to say yes or no," said Arthur H. Hertz, Orange Bowl
president. "But when you're No. 1 and driving the bus, you can drive it any way
you want."
</P>
<P>
Which is bowl-speak for: Notre Dame still might be considering a trip to the
Sugar or Cotton Bowl. Doubtful, but slightly possible. Also, the Fiesta
beckons.
</P>
<P>
Tennessee dropped to 5-2-2 but remained in the chase for the Southeastern
Conference championship and a Sugar or Fiesta Bowl appearance. Compared to the
national championship that the Irish pursue, it isn't much consolation.

NOTRE DAME REPLACES MIAMI AS NO. 1
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brigham Young's upset of top-ranked Miami shook up the Associated Press college
football poll Monday. Notre Dame became No. 1, BYU No. 5 and Miami No. 10.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, which opens its season Saturday against Michigan, received 37
first-place votes and 1,451 points from a nationwide panel of sportswriters and
broadcasters. The Fighting Irish were No. 2 last week.
</P>
<P>
Auburn, tied at No. 3 with Florida State last week, rose to No. 2 after beating
Cal State Fullerton, 38-17. Florida State remained in third after beating East
Carolina, 45-24. Idle Michigan moved up one spot to No. 4.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the top 10: No. 6 USC, No. 7 Tennessee, No. 8 Nebraska and No. 9
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
Only two weeks into the college football season, injuries have sidelined
several standout players.
</P>
<P>
 -- Houston wide receiver Manny Hazard, who had an NCAA-record 142 catches last
season, will be out for three weeks because of a dislocated elbow suffered in
the Cougars' 37-9 victory over Nevada Las Vegas on Saturday. Houston is ranked
18th.
</P>
<P>
 -- Alabama running back Siran Stacy, the team's leading rusher, underwent
surgery on his right knee and is out for the season. Stacy's top backup,
Derrick Lassic, also was injured Saturday.
</P>
<P>
 -- Tennessee's Chuck Webb, who rushed for 1,236 yards last season, suffered
torn knee ligaments during a 55-7 rout of Pacific Sept. 1 and will be sidelined
for the season.
</P>
<P>
The Orange Bowl Committee rejected an offer to move to Joe Robbie Stadium and
decided to keep the New Year's night game in its namesake home of 55 years.
</P>
<P>
Some committee members argued that the rundown condition of the Orange Bowl
made necessary a switch to three-year-old Joe Robbie Stadium, located north of
the city limits but still in Dade County. Other members said moving out of the
Orange Bowl, near Miami's downtown, would cost the city money and harm its
image.
</P>
<P>
Greg Jones, starting quarterback for West Virginia, has been cleared for
practice after suffering a concussion against Maryland, Coach Don Nehlen said.
Jones, a fifth-year senior from Miami, Fla., backed up Steve Walsh and Vinny
Testaverde at Miami before transferring to West Virginia after the 1986 season.
He had backed up Major Harris the past two seasons.

IF IRISH DEFEAT BUFFALOES, THEY COULD RATE A SHOT AT NO. 1
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Colorado could simplify the voting process in the final Associated Press and
United Press International college football polls by beating Notre Dame Monday
night in the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
The Buffaloes, the current No. 1-ranked team, would remain unbeaten, and who
really cares which teams finish second through fourth in the balloting.
</P>
<P>
All remaining contenders -- Miami, Michigan and Notre Dame -- would have at
least one loss.
</P>
<P>
However, if Notre Dame beats Colorado, Miami beats Alabama in the Sugar Bowl
and Michigan beats USC in the Rose Bowl, the voting could become more
subjective.
</P>
<P>
In that event, it would seem logical to elevate Miami, now ranked No. 2, to the
top spot, considering that it already had beaten Notre Dame, which had disposed
of the current No. 1 team, Colorado.
</P>
<P>
However, Notre Dame, now No. 4, which has a strong national following, may get
some support from reporters (Associated Press) and coaches (United Press
International) for the No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
There also could be voting backlash against Miami for reasons that have nothing
to do with results. The Hurricanes, with their swaggering and finger-pointing
on the field and previous "convict" image, may be a distasteful choice for the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
Voters might be looking for any excuse not to promote Miami to No. 1.
</P>
<P>
An indication of Notre Dame's popularity was evident in a recent USA Today
phone-in poll. Answering the question of who is the nation's No. 1 team, 1,063
voted for Notre Dame, 611 for Michigan, 498 for Miami and only 443 for
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler says it's "a shot in the dark" for his team to
get the No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
However, considering that Schembechler is retiring after the Rose Bowl game and
that he has never won a national championship in his 21 years as the
Wolverines' coach despite an impressive record, he and his Michigan team could
be a sentimental choice to jump from No. 3 to No. 1.
</P>
<P>
That seems unlikely, though, because Notre Dame beat Michigan in a
season-opening game.
</P>
<P>
In tiebreakers for conference championships, head-to-head results are the
determining factor.
</P>
<P>
That is not necessarily a guideline for the voting in the wire service polls.
</P>
<P>
Take 1978, for example. USC beat Alabama, 24-14, in the third game of the
season and then later lost to Arizona State. Alabama didn't lose another game,
and neither did USC.
</P>
<P>
Since USC beat Alabama, there was an obvious tiebreaker in the voting for No.
1. However, the AP poll selected Alabama as national champion. The UPI poll
tabbed USC as No. 1.
</P>
<P>
There's also the possibility that there could be split national champions again
this season.
</P>
<P>
Since 1974, the UPI poll has not recognized teams that are on NCAA probation.
The AP poll doesn't make such a distinction.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, USC was designated national champion by UPI at the end of the season.
Oklahoma, which was on probation, was AP's national champion.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, it isn't a perfect system but one that could be settled by playoffs
such as in college basketball. Although a playoff system has been discussed,
and some coaches favor it, nothing has been resolved.
</P>
<P>
The major bowls are opposed to a playoff formula, figuring that it might damage
their prestige if, say, the Rose Bowl or the Orange Bowl were designated as
semifinal NCAA playoff games, rather than the championship game.
</P>
<P>
One final thought: What if there are some tie games in the strategic bowl
games? That's another problem for the electorate.
</P>
<P>
Gamesmanship in the Orange Bowl began Dec. 22 when Colorado Coach Bill
McCartney brought his team to Miami. Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, whose team
didn't arrive until Monday night, has said that preparation is difficult at a
bowl site because of bowl-related activities and distractions.
</P>
<P>
"All you try to do is control damage," Holtz said. "You don't even know if the
ball is blown up or stuffed."
</P>
<P>
McCartney interpreted Holtz's comments as second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
"Coach Holtz questions our strategy in coming down here early and spending time
with the beautiful people of Miami," McCartney said. "I don't understand that.
(Former Oklahoma coach) Barry Switzer said he always came down early and felt
like it was the ideal way to prepare his squad.
</P>
<P>
"I think Switzer is the guy I want to listen to."
</P>
<P>
McCartney said the Buffaloes came to Miami early because cold weather and snow
in Colorado made it difficult for them to practice at home.
</P>
<P>
The players seem to be enjoying the change in climate.
</P>
<P>
"It's a chance for us to come down here and get used to the weather," wide
receiver Jeff Campbell said. "We're coming from a place where there isn't any
oxygen to a place where there's a lot of oxygen. So we have to get used to
stuff like that."
</P>
<P>
Said quarterback Darian Hagan, a Los Angeles native: "This is good weather to
practice in. We're living it up right now."
</P>
<P>
Said McCartney: "I'm not in any way concerned about being down here too long."
</P>
<P>
Your move, Lou.
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: What is the name of the only bowl game ever played in Havana, and
which teams participated? (Answer below.)
</P>
<P>
Monday's Rose Bowl game will be played on the 50th anniversary of the 1940 game
between USC and Tennessee. The game was unique in that it marked the second
consecutive year that USC defeated Rose Bowl opponents who came into the game
unbeaten, untied and unscored upon.
</P>
<P>
USC beat Duke, 7-3, in the 1939 game on Doyle Nave's last-minute touchdown pass
to Al Krueger.
</P>
<P>
The Trojans then spoiled Tennessee's perfect record, 14-0, behind the running
and passing of tailback Ambrose Schindler.
</P>
<P>
USC's victory prompted Henry McLemore of United Press to write:
</P>
<P>
"They raise them rugged out here. Perhaps nature sees that they do in order
that they will be able to withstand earthquakes, unusual weather and the water
that comes out of the taps.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lesson to be learned from the Rose Bowl game. There is no sense in
betting on a team that buys its clothes in the boys' department to beat a team
that has to shave twice a day and is fitted for suits in the adult or grown-up
section."
</P>
<P>
It was the last Rose Bowl game for USC Coach Howard Jones. He died in 1941,
leaving a legacy of five Rose bowl victories without a defeat.
</P>
<P>
If Miami wins the national championship, Dennis Erickson will become the first
coach in 41 years to get the title in his first year at a school. Michigan's
Bennie Oosterbaan was the last coach to do it, in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The Bacardi Bowl on Jan. 1, 1937, when Auburn and Villanova
played to a 7-7 tie.

State-Miami game today figures to be one of the better ones.;   Their match

<HEADLINE>  IT'S GAME OF THE YEAR, IF NOT CENTURY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     If the top-ranked Seminoles win the 9 a.m. game in Tallahassee, Fla.,
they'll still have two more huge games to play -- on Nov. 30, against
fifth-ranked Florida, and the Orange Bowl, probably against Nebraska. If the
Hurricanes win, they'll play Boston College and San Diego State before heading
to the Orange Bowl. If Florida State loses, it's going to the Cotton Bowl. If
Miami loses, it'll play in the Blockbuster Bowl.;   But the latest Game of the
Century isn't the only game of the day. A look at the schedule:;   (check) No.
2 Miami (8-0) at No. 1 Florida State (10-0). TV: CH7CH11CH13, 9 a.m.;
(check) No. 12 Notre Dame (8-2) at No. 8 Penn State (8-2): It's a good game,
though little is on the line. The Irish are Sugar Bowl-bound, win or lose, and
the Nittany Lions will play in the Fiesta Bowl.;   (check) No. 4 Michigan
(8-1) at No. 25 Illinois (6-3): The Rose Bowl becomes the national title game
if Florida State wins today but loses to Florida. But first, the Wolverines
have to get by the Illini today. And, technically, third-rated Washington
(9-0) must beat Oregon State (0-9). The superstitious Huskies, 43 1/2-point
favorites, are asking Rose Bowl representatives to stay home today. Last
season, with Rose Bowl reps around, an upset loss to UCLA spoiled their chance
to go undefeated and win a national title.;   (check) Arizona State (5-4) at
No. 6 Cal (8-1): With a Citrus Bowl bid nearly in hand for Cal, Russell White
tries to become the first Bears player to rush for 1,000 yards twice in his
career. Radio: KGO (810), 1 p.m.;   (check) No. 22 Stanford (6-3) at
Washington State (4-5): The Cardinal must win today to be assured an
invitation to the Aloha Bowl. Otherwise, it'll have to win the Big Game, which
traditionally knocks teams out of bowl contention. Radio: KCBS (740), 1 p.m.;
 (check) No. 23 Brigham Young (7-3) at San Diego State (8-2): The Western
Athletic Conference title is decided today. Winner goes to the Holiday Bowl,
loser to the Freedom Bowl. TV: ESPN, 7:30 p.m.  </TEXT>

TELEVISION: A HARD DAY'S NIGHT OF FOOTBALL
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, there can be too much football.
</P>
<P>
There was some good football on New Year's Day -- particularly for USC, Notre
Dame and Miami fans -- but seven games in one day is about four too many.
</P>
<P>
The NFL presents a nice, neat postseason tournament, culminating with Super
Bowl Sunday. What the colleges present is a mess.
</P>
<P>
Watching seven games within an 11-hour span is enough to make your head spin
more than a New Year's Day hangover.
</P>
<P>
The first game Monday was the Hall of Fame Bowl, which began shortly after 10
a.m. The last one, the Sugar Bowl, didn't end until 9:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
ABC made the most of its late sign-off and asked viewers to call in their votes
for the No. 1 team in the nation.
</P>
<P>
At last count, Notre Dame had a pretty healthy lead over Miami, 55% to 26%,
after 50,000 calls.
</P>
<P>
NBC and ABC each televised three games and CBS one.
</P>
<P>
NBC got a head start on ABC with the Hall of Fame Bowl starting a half-hour
earlier than the Citrus Bowl.
</P>
<P>
NBC had to cut away from its coverage of the Rose Parade a little early, but at
least it didn't run into the overlapping problems later in the day that ABC
did.
</P>
<P>
NBC's Hall of Fame Bowl ended at 1:27 p.m. and the network wasted little time
switching to the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
It was a far better switch than ABC's from the Citrus Bowl to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
ABC planned to be on the air from Pasadena at 1:45 p.m., and the kickoff was
scheduled for shortly after 2.
</P>
<P>
But, as things turned out, the kickoff was delayed until 2:21.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the delay was that the Citrus Bowl didn't end until 2:03.
Then, making matters worse, ABC took its time making the switch, to say the
least.
</P>
<P>
After the Citrus Bowl was over, ABC showed a promotional spot for the upcoming
Rose Bowl. Thanks, but we knew it was coming.
</P>
<P>
Then came a promo for ABC Sports, then a "thank you" promotional spot to an
airline that provides free air travel.
</P>
<P>
There were two promos for ABC shows, followed by a news brief.
</P>
<P>
It was almost 2:10.
</P>
<P>
What next? Three consecutive commercials and a Channel 7 promo for Todd
Donoho's "New Year's Live" postgame show.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Donoho's show wasn't bad. He played it pretty straight, and his
look-a-likes segment was interesting. John Robinson and Duke Snider was one of
his best.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, ABC was still a long way from the Rose Bowl kickoff.
</P>
<P>
After some ABC Sports graphics, there was a Big Ten promo, then more graphics
and finally a glimpse of the Rose Bowl, where the crowd was completing the
national anthem.
</P>
<P>
Then came an intro from announcer Keith Jackson and another taped piece on
Schembechler, this one showing a 1971 pep talk.
</P>
<P>
Next was another commercial, then a Pacific 10 promo followed by one more
commercial.
</P>
<P>
At 2:16, the teams took the field, and Jackson and commentator Bob Griese
offered a little pregame analysis.
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl kickoff came 18 minutes after the end of the Citrus Bowl.
</P>
<P>
ABC had met with Rose Bowl officials at about 1 p.m. and asked for a later
kickoff, so the teams knew what was coming.
</P>
<P>
But it was unnerving to viewers at home and fans at the game, making them wait
and wait.
</P>
<P>
The 18-minute break wouldn't have been so bad had ABC not crammed in all those
commercials and promos.
</P>
<P>
There were 20 minutes between the Fiesta Bowl and Orange Bowl on NBC, but that
network used the time mostly for analysis and features.
</P>
<P>
It used the time for only a few commercials and promos.
</P>
<P>
ABC producer Bob Goodrich, who was in charge of the Rose Bowl coverage, had
plenty of material planned for his pregame show, but someone higher up at ABC
decided against using it.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Goodrich, director Larry Kamm, announcers Jackson and Griese and the
rest of the ABC crew put out an excellent Rose Bowl telecast -- once it got
going.
</P>
<P>
ABC got some definitive shots the holding call on Michigan's fake punt in the
fourth quarter, but the most conclusive shot wasn't shown until halftime of the
Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
It showed that Michigan's Bobby Abrams held, but it was far away from the play
and the flag was late.
</P>
<P>
Usually sideline reporters offer little, but NBC's O.J. Simpson came up with
some good information during the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
Simpson, working the Colorado sideline while Ralph Wiley handled the Notre Dame
bench, explained why the entire teams of both schools went on the field before
the kickoff.
</P>
<P>
Simpson said when the Colorado players saw the whole Notre Dame team coming
out, they did the same thing.
</P>
<P>
Simpson also explained what went wrong on Colorado's fake field goal try early
in the game, pointing out that the key receiver forgot to run a pattern.
</P>
<P>
In the Orange Bowl booth, Dick Enberg and Bill Walsh had one of their best
games. It was refreshing to hear how excited Walsh was.
</P>
<P>
He even apologized for a profanity. Actually, all he said was 'that was a
helluva play."
</P>
<P>
Viewers of the Hall of Fame Bowl saw one of the all-time hits when Ohio State's
Zack Dumas leveled Auburn's Stacy Danley.
</P>
<P>
Announcer Don Criqui first said: "That's got to be the hardest hit of the
'89-90 bowl season."
</P>
<P>
Then, after viewing a replay, Criqui said: "It's the hardest hit I've seen in
football in years."
</P>
<P>
Criqui at one point forgot he was at the Hall of Fame Bowl. Talking about
Auburn's Shayne Wasden's punt returns of 30 and 34 yards, he said they broke
the Orange Bowl record.
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe you can't blame Criqui for being confused. He worked the last eight
Orange Bowl games.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of flubs, Simpson, during halftime of the Hall of Fame Bowl, referred
to Notre Dame's George Gipp as George Kemp. However, Simpson did catch the
mistake and corrected it.
</P>
<P>
In referring to Gipp's death, comparing it to the death of Colorado quarterback
Sal Aunese, Simpson said it occurred a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
Colleague Bob Costas, fearing Simpson's attempt at sarcasm was probably lost on
most viewers, added: "It was more than a few years ago. It was so long ago that
a young Ronald Reagan could play Gipp (in the 1940 movie, 'Knute Rockne -- All
American')."
</P>
<P>
During halftime of the Fiesta Bowl, Gayle Gardner -- yes, she still works for
NBC -- had an excellent feature on the once-troubled Colorado football program
and the death of Aunese last September.
</P>
<P>
CBS deserves kudos for the halftime piece it showed during the Cotton Bowl. It
chronicled the highlights of college football during the 1980s, including
California's 1982 kickoff against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
NBC broke a story Monday afternoon that Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry
Alvarez would be leaving the school to become head coach at Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
The network had Wiley interview Alvarez later in the day, but because of
technical problems, had to cut away from it earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
On this day and night of football, the coverage and the announcing, overall,
was fine.
</P>
<P>
It's just that something needs to be done about the logjam. The way things are
now, it's impossible to see everything.
</P>
<P>
And that's depriving viewers. You don't see the NFL scheduling seven games on
Super Bowl Sunday.

<TEXT>
<P>
A campaign began, a dream ended Monday night as Notre Dame defeated Colorado,
21-6, in an Orange Bowl game that sent shivers down the national rankings.
</P>
<P>
Colorado began the night as No. 1, but didn't end it there. Notre Dame, ranked
fourth -- for now -- saw to that as it granted the Buffaloes three first-half
scoring wishes and survived to tell about it.
</P>
<P>
After that, the Irish unleashed Raghib (The Rocket) Ismail, their little
speedburner of a tailback, who left powder burns on a stunned CU defense and
caused a packed house of 81,191 to shake their heads in admiration. His 110
rushing yards, 83 of them in the second half, helped break open a game that was
0-0 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Ismail was presented with the most valuable player award and
a miniature Orange Bowl trophy, which he carried as easily as he toted the
Irish offense Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Ismail scored once in the third quarter, on a 35-yard reverse, and fullback
Anthony Johnson added two other short touchdown runs to give Notre Dame a
victory in a place that has haunted them for years. At last, the Irish left
this aging stadium with a win, their first in their last six tries.
</P>
<P>
And if you can believe Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz, the Irish also left with
another national championship, which would be their second in as many seasons.
According to Holtz, Notre Dame's convincing victory over Colorado negated
anything that happened between Miami and Alabama at the Sugar Bowl. To make his
point, Holtz delivered a stern sermon to the assembled press, some of whom will
cast ballots for the Associated Press final poll.
</P>
<P>
"I can honestly say right now that we got the best record and the toughest
schedule," Holtz said. "And I don't know how you can decide on anyone else
being No. 1. Now that's my personal opinion. Unless you want to say, 'Who was
the best team on Nov. 25?' (the night Notre Dame lost to Miami and lost its No.
1 ranking). We did not play well, we came off an emotional victory at Penn
State.
</P>
<P>
"But we played the toughest schedule and had the best record and we were No. 1
for 11 weeks. The one week we're out of No. 1, we come back and beat No. 1 by
15 points."
</P>
<P>
Holtz's voice took on a frosty edge, as if he wanted all to know precisely how
he felt about the poll war that will be waged between Notre Dame and Miami
until the rankings are made public today.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to campaign or anything like that, but I just believe in my
heart that if you have the best record against the toughest schedule . . . case
rest."
</P>
<P>
As if Holtz wasn't forceful enough, quarterback Tony Rice offered his postgame
assessment of the voting process.
</P>
<P>
"We have played 13 games and won 12 of them," he said. "We beat the undefeated,
No. 1 team. We deserve to be No. 1. We better be No. 1!"
</P>
<P>
It is a situation filled with ironies. In a way, Notre Dame, playing in the
stadium used by the Hurricanes, might have helped Miami's cause more than its
own. Maybe that's why Miami offered the Irish use of its practice facilities
and locker room.
</P>
<P>
Should Notre Dame squeeze past Miami in the final rankings, it can thank the
Irish defense for confounding a Buffalo offense used to scoring early and
often. Colorado quarterback Darian Hagan completed just four of 13 passes,
which tended to diminish the importance of his 116 rushing yards and one
scoring run.
</P>
<P>
"We felt very confident in the huddle, but unfortunately, we'd get it down
close and couldn't punch it in," Hagan said. "It wasn't frustrating at first,
but in the second half we didn't play with as much intensity. They went up,
14-0, and we wanted to show we weren't going to lie down. But we didn't come up
with enough points."
</P>
<P>
It's not as if they didn't have their chances. The Buffaloes will forever
remember the first half and what might have been. And if they don't, someone
ought to remind them.
</P>
<P>
A pair of quarters came and went and with it, at least three Colorado scoring
opportunities, maybe four if you count Notre Dame's Tony Rice nearly being
tackled for a safety.
</P>
<P>
Colorado's offense wasn't choosy with its mistakes. It fumbled away a sure
touchdown, missed a chip-shot field goal, failed three times from the Notre
Dame one-yard line and then botched a questionable fake field goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
Three times inside the Notre Dame 20. Zero points.
</P>
<P>
The Colorado offensive line couldn't be faulted. So wide were the running lanes
in the first half that Ralphie, the buffalo mascot, could have dashed through
untouched. Instead, tailback Eric Bieniemy, back in the lineup after missing
half of the season with a broken leg, and Hagan did the honors on the
Buffaloes' first failed scoring drive.
</P>
<P>
Down the field Colorado went until, with a second-and-five from the Irish 35,
Bieniemy burst through the line on what appeared to be a clear path to the end
zone. About halfway there, Bieniemy tried switching the ball from his left to
right hand . . . and dropped it. Notre Dame recovered.
</P>
<P>
One possession later, after using 11 plays to move to the Notre Dame five-yard
line, Colorado kicker Ken Culbertson jogged onto the field for a 23-yard field
goal attempt. Moments later, his skulled attempt barely cleared the line before
swerving far left of the upright.
</P>
<P>
Gone were three more points.
</P>
<P>
The frustration didn't end with Culbertson's shank. Colorado got the ball back,
promptly drove to the Irish one-yard line, where the Buffaloes failed three
consecutive times to squirm into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
On fourth-and-three, Culbertson returned for a 20-yard attempt. Ram Coach John
Robinson can empathize with what happened next.
</P>
<P>
Rather than let Culbertson kick away, the Buffaloes had holder Jeff Campbell
try for a touchdown. Campbell took the snap, looked for a receiver and then
dashed for the right corner of the end zone. It would have been a fine play had
Notre Dame defensive tackle Troy Ridgely not been waiting for him at the two.
</P>
<P>
Poof went another three points, six if Colorado had been able to punch it in
from the one.
</P>
<P>
So what could have been perhaps a 17-point halftime lead, became a series of
calamities that ultimately took their toll on the Buffaloes.
</P>
<P>
"Coming away from the first half without any points, after controlling the game
for a while, was too much to overcome," Colorado Coach Bill McCartney said.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame had only one scoring opportunity in the first half and also blew it.
After a series of timeouts, Bill Hackett's 27-yard field goal was blocked,
ending two quarters of frustration.

<LEADPARA>  A college football bowls alliance, designed to make a national championship

<TEXT>     Also included are the Big East and Atlantic Coast conferences, which last
year added to their fold perennial national title contenders Miami and Florida
State, respectively. The Big Eight Conference will continue to send its
champion to the Orange Bowl. Southwest Conference-Cotton Bowl and Southeastern
Conference-Sugar Bowl affiliations also will continue.;    The agreement still
must be put into writing.;    Under the plan, scheduled to take effect in the
1992 season, the lineups for the four bowls would be decided by a prearranged
system.;    After the Big Eight, SWC and SEC champions are determined, the
other slots for the four bowl games would be filled by a five-team pool, which
would include Notre Dame, the champions of the Big East and ACC, and two other
highly ranked at-large teams. The at-large teams could be independents or
conference members.;    The highest-ranked team in the pool would go to the
bowl that offers the highest-ranked opponent.;    The coalition plans to wait
until after the final regular-season poll in early December to determine its
bowl pairings.;    The Fiesta Bowl -- which has no conference affiliation --
would play host to the national championship game if the five-team pool
includes the teams ranked No. 1 and No. 2.;    Notre Dame and the champions of
the ACC and Big East have the option of declining one bowl's invitation to
play in another bowl within the alliance.;    The deal doesn't ensure that the
two top-ranked teams will meet each Jan. 1. For example, the No. 1 team might
come from the Big Eight and the No. 2 team from the SEC, and under that
scenario, the alliance has no provision for putting the teams into the same
bowl.;    The Rose Bowl, which extends automatic berths to the Pacific 10 and
Big Ten champions, might also eclipse the new alliance's top matchup.;    Rose
Bowl officials held no discussions with the alliance.; PRO FOOTBALL: New
Orleans defensive lineman Frank Warren, who served a one-year drug suspension,
has been cleared to return to the league, Saints President Jim Finks said. . .
. Cornerback Dwayne Woodruff, 34, the last active member of a Pittsburgh Super
Bowl champion, retired.; PRO BASKETBALL: The Milwaukee Bucks signed center
Moses Malone, 36, to a two-year contract. Malone, an unrestricted free agent,
played for Atlanta last season.; MISCELLANY: The University of Arizona took
the recommendation of a hearing board and exonerated basketball player Khalid
Reeves concerning allegations that he sexually assaulted a female student. . .
. U.S. sprinter Michael Johnson ran the season's fastest 400 meters in 44.17
seconds in Lausanne, Switzerland. Merlene Ottey ran the fastest women's 100 in
the world this year with a 10.84 clocking. . . . In Santiago, Chile, Gabriel
Batistuta scored with nine minutes remaining to give Argentina a 1-0 victory
over Chile in the America Cup, the South American soccer championship. In the
day's first game, Paraguay beat Venezuela 5-0.  </TEXT>

END-OF-YEAR PLAYOFF FOR COLLEGE FOOTBALL IS A SURE-FIRE LOSER
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN EISENABERG, THE BALTIMORE SUN
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that Miami has stopped Notre Dame's 13-month run at the top of the college
football rankings -- and what a beating that was, incidentally -- this season
could have the most uproarious finish in years.
</P>
<P>
There is the possibility of sheer madness, that no team will be unbeaten and
that seven will have one loss when the bowls are over. (I would pay to see the
coaches argue it out in a locked room.) There also is a chance that two teams,
Colorado and Alabama, will finish unbeaten, untied and understandably
possessive of the national championship.
</P>
<P>
The call for a championship tournament will go up again, as it always does when
opinion, not football, determines the No. 1 team. But you will not hear my
voice in the chorus. The idea of a playoff is not without merit, but it is
flawed and would damage the fabric of the sport. The cons outweigh the pros.
</P>
<P>
The aspect of a playoff that appeals to so many is, of course, the spotless
finish, the clean lines to No. 1. There would be no debate about who played a
tougher non-conference schedule or an easier bowl opponent. No complaining
about regionalism or the whims of poll voters. The championship would be
decided on the field.
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, it would be interesting this year to put eight teams in a bracket
and see who survived. Certainly, a Final Four of Miami, Michigan, Colorado and
Notre Dame would result in terrific games. (Sorry, Alabama. You're a
first-round loser.)
</P>
<P>
But there still are better reasons not to put on a tournament. It is an
emotional play, mostly. College football is professional enough already. A
playoff would exact a great toll on the sport's original, vibrant nature.
</P>
<P>
You can start with what would happen to the bowls. Even if they were
incorporated into the tournament as game sites, the New Year's Day bowls would
be stripped of their importance, one-upped as a forum for determining No. 1.
That would be unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
The bowls may be a sprawling, eccentric brotherhood, but they have served the
sport well, providing a strong tradition, dozens of memorable games and fodder
for an endless supply of speculative gossip.
</P>
<P>
The bowls also have proved adept at determining a champion. That is the best
rebuttal to any pro-playoff argument: Hey, the current system works fine. In 10
of the last 13 years, a clear No. 1 has emerged from the bowls with either a
perfect record or, at least, the best record in the land.
</P>
<P>
You can look it up. Only three times since 1976 has there been debate after the
last touchdown of the season. (Four times if you include the year Brigham Young
beat a lousy Michigan team in the Holiday Bowl and finished No. 1, to loud
hooting.)
</P>
<P>
And, anyway, is it so awful to confront a little gray area occasionally? With
the pursuit of No. 1 so often grim and relentless in sports these days, college
football, with its system of polls, partiality and debate, is like a funny,
quirky uncle who doesn't quite conform to the family. He is different, and, for
that reason, interesting.
</P>
<P>
The point is that arguing, and differences of opinion, are part of the sport's
basic, chaotic appeal. A playoff not only would wipe out the dialogue, but also
probably affect changes reaching the very core of the game.
</P>
<P>
For instance, no longer would Big Ten players spend all fall striving to play
in the Rose Bowl, as they have since World War II. Now the Rose Bowl wouldn't
be that important. The players would strive to make the tournament (the Sony
College Football Championship?) and probably get sent to Orlando to play their
big game. How's that for romance?
</P>
<P>
It is even possible, if the bowls were used as playoff sites, that the Big Ten
champions wouldn't go to the Rose Bowl. Few conference champions would wind up
at their traditional bowls. Take the Southeastern Conference out of the Sugar
Bowl? Southwest out of the Cotton? It isn't right.
</P>
<P>
Call me sentimental, but it is wrong to wipe out the whole of a sport's
tradition in one giant, made-for-TV swoop, especially to make room for a
sterile tournament that probably would send teams all over the country
throughout Christmas break for a series of games at neutral sites, far away
from fans and students. One such game, a bowl, is fine. But no more than that.
Hasn't the sport already been sufficiently disenfranchised from college life?
</P>
<P>
Some will say this year's potential poll madness drives home the need for a
playoff. To me, it only drives home the need to keep things as they are. The
plot is as convoluted as a soap opera, almost a football whodunit, or
who-won-it. Pay close attention:
</P>
<P>
Colorado will be No. 1 if it beats Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl, although if
Alabama beats Auburn Saturday and also Miami in the Sugar Bowl, the Crimson
Tide will scream about its candidacy. If Notre Dame wins the Orange Bowl and
Miami wins the Sugar Bowl, Miami probably will get the most votes of the many
one-loss teams, although Michigan will scream if it wins the Rose Bowl. And
psst: Notre Dame could slip back in if Miami and Michigan lose.
</P>
<P>
It is all messy, loud and hysterical, and college football would be sadly
diminished without it.
</P>
<P>
There is an apt analogy in architecture. The championship tournament would be a
chrome-and-glass skyscraper, modern, cooly efficient, huge. The current
arrangement is a rambling, old mansion: big, a little imperfect, full of life.
Give me the latter any day.

<P>
The Miami Hurricanes have been ordered not to taunt, and Notre Dame has been
warned not to brawl. So, Saturday night's action at the Orange Bowl may be
limited to tackles and touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
Few complaints are likely, since the showdown between the top-ranked Fighting
Irish (11-0) and seventh-ranked Miami (9-1) is one of the year's biggest games.
The Hurricanes view it as a rematch; they lost at South Bend, Ind., last year,
31-30, and that was the margin by which Notre Dame won the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
The rivalry is heated, partly because the teams have contrasting reputations.
</P>
<P>
"It's the Miami Vice image against the Pope image," Hurricanes tackle Mike
Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
"Convicts versus Catholics," Miami safety Charles Pharms said. "Pure, wholesome
young men against these vile, nasty boys that should be in prison. I dislike
that. But that's part of the thing that keeps us fired up for this game."
</P>
<P>
The teams fought in a stadium tunnel before last year's game.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, eventual Heisman Trophy winner Tim Brown of Notre Dame complained
about the Hurricanes' taunting after they won 24-0. In 1985, the Irish accused
Miami of running up the score after a 58-7 loss.
</P>
<P>
Last spring, the head coaches and athletic directors from both schools met to
soothe resentment.
</P>
<P>
"When you get two great teams together, sometimes tempers flare," Miami
first-year Coach Dennis Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was concerned about what happened, but that's over and done with.
What's important is playing the game itself. I don't think there'll be a
confrontation."
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz agreed.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not the least bit concerned," Holtz said. "I don't think we have any
bitter feelings toward Miami. . . . This is the rivalry right now that kind of
excites us, because we've had some degree of success, and Miami has had
tremendous success."
</P>
<P>
After Notre Dame engaged in another tunnel fight before this fall's game at
home against Southern Cal, Holtz said he'll resign if it happens again.
</P>
<P>
Erickson, meanwhile, has issued orders against taunting and gloating. Such
behavior has been as much a part of Miami football as great quarterbacks, and
Notre Dame guard Tim Grunhard expects it to continue.
</P>
<P>
"Miami will try to intimidate; that's the way they play football," he said. "If
they're pointing fingers and that kind of thing, I'll look them in the eyeand
say, 'Hey, I'll see you next play.'
</P>
<P>
"Notre Dame isn't going to be intimidated. We've won 23 games in a row. We're a
powerhouse now."
</P>
<P>
And the Fighting Irish respect Miami as a powerhouse, too, Grunhard said.

<P>
"I don't think the players see the game as good versus evil. I think we see it
as the two powers in this part of the decade clashing."
</P>
<P>
That it is. While Notre Dame has the nation's longest winning streak, the
Hurricanes have won 32 of their past 34 games, and 31 in a row at home.
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish have Heisman Trophy contender Tony Rice at quarterback;
Miami has the nation's top defense. The Hurricanes, bound for a Sugar Bowl date
where they'll likely play unbeaten Alabama, remain in contention to finish No.
1. Notre Dame, bound for an Orange Bowl berth against No. 2 Colorado, is the
front-runner in the national championship race.
</P>
<P>
"We're like being in the Final Four in basketball," Holtz said. "We've come
down to the last two games. We've come a long way, but we've got a long way to
go."

<HEADLINE>  QUESTIONS BEFORE KICKOFF
THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL SEASON BEGINS TONIGHT WITH
GEORGIA TECH PLAYING PENN STATE IN THE KICKOFF
CLASSIC. TO HELP PREPARE YOU, HERE ARE 10 OF THE
SEASON'S INTRIGUING TOPICS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  College Football; Mercury News Staff Writer Annette John-Hall contributed to
this report.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Based on talent, the answer might be yes. In light of FSU's schedule, it's
no -- which is too bad, because the Seminoles will forsake independence to
enter the ACC in '92. Based on the success independents have had procuring
national titles -- Penn State, Miami and Notre Dame are examples -- it could
be said the more control a team has over its schedule, the better.;   The
'Noles are rated No. 1 so far, but they open Thursday night at Anaheim Stadium
against BYU, which knocked off the '90 preseason No. 1, Miami, in the
Hurricanes' opener.;   But the Seminoles return 35 of the top 44 players from
a 10-2 team in '90. And should FSU be undefeated after playing the Cougars,
Michigan, LSU, Louisville, South Carolina, Miami and Florida, it'll be hard
not to give them the title.; 2. Is David Klingler a lock for the Heisman?;
Right now, yes. Ty Detmer of BYU is back, but he threw four interceptions in a
59-28 loss to Hawaii hours after winning the Heisman last year, then followed
up with an equally stinking Holiday Bowl defeat to Texas A&amp;M. Klingler had 352
yards against A&amp;M and rallied his team to victory. Klingler's team will be
more successful this year, too. The Cougars' defense returns all but one
starter and boasts the best linebackers in the Southwest Conference. Klingler
-- who waited his turn behind Houston's Andre Ware two years ago, and last
season put up record-breaking numbers for a program headed nowhere because of
probation -- will have a coming-out party on national TV against Miami on
Sept. 12. If that's a success, the race will be over before it's run. Heisman
voters view Klingler as long-suffering. They're itching to reward him.;
store the Bay Area to prominence. They'll need to do well this season and be
followed by guys just like them in each of the next three or four seasons.; 3.
What will be the impact of narrower goalposts?;   The idea of reducing the
goalposts from 23 feet four inches wide to 18-6 is to induce coaches to go for
the first down or the end zone instead of the uprights.;   What effect will it
have on strategy? Not much on schools with great kickers, said the University
of Houston's stellar senior, Roman Anderson.;   But field-goal attempts inside
the 15 from the hash marks will force kickers to chip balls at an acute angle.
Similarly, there will be less room for a ball to curve on long kicks. For
teams with average kickers, the rule could persuade a coach not to bother.;
"What I still haven't figured out is why they keep picking on the kickers,"
Anderson said. "The next thing you know, they'll want us to wear heavier
shoes."; 4. Can Will Clark replace the Rocket?;   Clark, not to be confused
with the scowling first baseman, is a Notre Dame sophomore from Wheatfield,
Calif., who also won't be confused with Raghib (Rocket) Ismail. Still, Coach
Lou Holtz is optimistic that Clark, a tailback who was switched from defensive
back just this spring, will have a semblance of Ismail's explosiveness.;   ND
coaches have timed Clark at 4.29 seconds in the 40, which compares nicely with
Ismail's 4.28. "Will Clark is legitimately a game-breaker," Holtz said. "We
really need a game-breaker after losing Rocket."; 5. Will Russell White and
Glyn Milburn restore glamour to Bay Area college football?;   The Bay heyday
of the late 1970s and early '80s produced a string of glamour boys -- Steve
Dils in '78, Turk Schonert in '79, Darrin Nelson in '81 and John Elway in '82.
Cal even contributed a Chuck Muncie, who finished second in the Heisman voting
in '75.;   Milburn and White, then, will need help to restore the Bay Area to
prominence. They'll need to do well this season and be followed by guys just
like them in each of the next three or four seasons.; 6. Will Washington waltz
through the Pac-10?;   Let's put it this way -- the Huskies would be the first
Pac-10 team outside of Trojanville to do so. USC is the only Pac-10 team to go
undefeated in league play since UCLA in 1965.;   There are several other
would-be tacklers standing between the Huskies and the conference title,
beginning with a season opener at Stanford, the departure of running back Greg
Lewis and the loss of quarterback Mark Brunell to a knee injury in spring
practice.;   It remains to be seen if their heirs, sophomore QB Billy Joe
Hobert and running back Beno Bryant, are more than candidates for the All-Name
Team.; 7. Does the University of Miami have another great quarterback?;
Good, maybe not great. The recent tradition began with Jim Kelly in 1979, who
was followed without interruption by four more outstanding QBs: Bernie Kosar
(national title for 1983 season), Vinny Testaverde (Heisman Trophy, 1986),
Steve Walsh (national title for 1987 season) and Craig Erickson (national
title for 1989 season). The star of the moment is Gino Torretta of Pinole, a
junior who has subbed very effectively for Erickson and already owns the
school's single-game record for passing yardage (468 against San Jose State in
1989).; 8. Can Michigan beat Notre Dame and keep alive its hopes for a title?;
  The two goals are not mutually exclusive. The Wolverines lost to Notre Dame
in their season opener last year and four weeks later still wound up No. 1,
with one-point losses to Michigan State and Iowa toppling them again.;   But
Michigan starts the season six feet under. That's how far the field in
Michigan Stadium was lowered to install a new synthetic turf.;   The
Wolverines have three first-time starters among their four defensive backs and
their schedule is brutal, with Notre Dame visiting Sept. 14 and FSU on Sept.
28.; 9. Will Colorado repeat, and can they do it fair and square?;   The Buffs
are still touchy about the fifth down that let them beat Missouri. The fact
is, the Colorado offense may need an extra down every game this season, having
lost eight starters, including running back Eric Bieniemy.;   The Buffs' hopes
ride on quarterback Darian Hagan's left knee, which he injured in last
season's 10-9 win over Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl.;   10. How about the new
system to crown a national champion?;   What new system? Jim Brock, executive
vice president of the Cotton Bowl, said there's only a 10 percent chance that
the Cotton-Fiesta-Orange-Sugar coalition will have a system worked out for
this season.;   "We've agreed to agree and that's about it," he said.;   The
tentative plan works this way: If the conference champion aligned with one of
those four bowls is ranked No. 1 or 2 in the nation, the next highest-ranked
team available will be matched against it.;   What if Oklahoma is champion of
the Big Eight, which is aligned with the Orange Bowl, and ranked No. 1, and
Houston is the Cotton Bowl-bound SWC champion and ranked No. 2? Or what if one
of the Pac-10 schools is No. 1 or 2 -- what happens with the Rose Bowl?;
There are more questions than answers right now -- but then that's the case
with college football at this time every year.  </TEXT>

TELEVISION / LARRY STEWART: BOWL GAME LINEUP: TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yes, there is such a thing as too much football.
</P>
<P>
Seven bowl games on New Year's Day is about four too many.
</P>
<P>
While the NFL presents a nice, neat postseason tournament, what the colleges
present is a mess.
</P>
<P>
Try watching seven games within an 11-hour span. It's enough to make your head
spin worse than any New Year's Day hangover.
</P>
<P>
The first game Monday was the Hall of Fame Bowl game. NBC had to cut away from
its coverage of the Rose Parade, but at least it didn't run into the
overlapping problems that ABC did.
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame Bowl game ended, NBC wasted little time switching to the
Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
It was nice and clean, far better than ABC's switch from the Florida Citrus
Bowl game to the Rose Bowl game.
</P>
<P>
ABC took its time making the switch. ABC started off by showing a promotional
spot for the upcoming Rose Bowl game. Thanks, but we knew it was coming.
</P>
<P>
Then came a promo for ABC Sports, then a 'thank-you" promo to an airline that
provides it with free travel. Then there were two promos for ABC shows,
followed by a news brief.
</P>
<P>
What next? Three consecutive commercials.
</P>
<P>
Finally, an introduction for the Rose Bowl game, followed by a taped interview
with Bo Schembechler.
</P>
<P>
Then came more ABC Sports graphics and two more commercials.
</P>
<P>
Oh, by the way, the Cotton Bowl on CBS was still going on. Arkansas scored on a
long pass play and after a failed two-point conversion attempt, the Razorbacks
trailed Tennessee, 31-27, with 1:29 left.
</P>
<P>
OK, we were finally going to see the Rose Bowl game kickoff, right? Nah.
</P>
<P>
First there was a Big Ten promo, more ABC graphics and then finally a glimpse
of the Rose Bowl, where the crowd was finishing singing the National Anthem.
</P>
<P>
Then came an introduction from announcer Keith Jackson, and another taped piece
on Schembechler, this one showing a 1971 pep talk.
</P>
<P>
Next was another commercial, then a Pacific 10 promo followed by one more
commercial.
</P>
<P>
The teams finally took the field, and Jackson and commentator Bob Griese then
offered a little pregame analysis, as if there already hadn't been enough.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in the Fiesta Bowl game, Florida State missed a field-goal attempt
and trailed Nebraska, 7-0.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the Rose Bowl game kickoff came, 18 minutes after the end of the
Citrus Bowl game.
</P>
<P>
One play after the kickoff at the Rose Bowl game, Florida State recovered a
fumble to set up its first touchdown to tie the score on the way to a rout of
the Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
At least we were down to only two games, the Cotton Bowl game having ended.
</P>
<P>
It was quite a task trying to watch the Hall of Fame, the Citrus and the Cotton
Bowl games all at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The Cotton Bowl game was the last of the three early games to start.
</P>
<P>
The Citrus Bowl game began shortly after ABC went from Pasadena to Orlando,
Fla.But it didn't take long to realize there was going to be a time squeeze
later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Certainly Citrus Bowl game announcer Gary Bender sensed it. As officials
discussed a first-quarter penalty, Bender said: "Come on, fellas, we've got a
lot of football to play today."
</P>
<P>
If you happened to be watching the Hall of Fame Bowl game you saw Ohio State's
Zack Dumas level Auburn's Stacy Danley.
</P>
<P>
Announcer Don Criqui first said: "That's got to be the hardest hit of the
'89-90 bowl season."
</P>
<P>
Then, after viewing a replay, Criqui said: "It's the hardest hit I've seen in
football in years."
</P>
<P>
Indeed it was.
</P>
<P>
A little later in the game, Criqui, talking about Auburn's Shayne Wasden's punt
returns of 30 and 34 yards, said they broke the Orange Bowl game record.
</P>
<P>
Maybe you can't blame Criqui for being confused. He worked the last eight
Orange Bowl games.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of flubs, O.J. Simpson, during halftime of the Hall of Fame Bowl game,
referred to Notre Dame's George Gipp as George Kemp, or something like that.
However, Simpson did catch the mistake and corrected himself.
</P>
<P>
In referring to Gipp's death, comparing it to the death of Colorado quarterback
Sal Aunese, Simpson said it occurred a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
NBC colleague Bob Costas, fearing Simpson's attempt at sarcasm was probably
lost on most viewers, added: "It was more than a few years ago. It was so long
ago that a young Ronald Reagan could play Gipp (in the 1940 movie, 'The Knute
Rockne All-American')."
</P>
<P>
During halftime of the Hall of Fame Bowl game, Gayle Gardner -- yes, she still
works for NBC -- did a nice taped interview with Miami Coach Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
And Gardner, during halftime of the Fiesta Bowl game, offered an excellent
feature on the once-troubled Colorado football program and the death of Aunese
this past September.
</P>
<P>
CBS, meanwhile, deserves kudos for a halftime segment it showed during the
Cotton Bowl. It chronicled the highlights of college football during the 1980s,
including California's 1982 kickoff return against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
NBC broke a story that Notre Dame defensive coordinator Barry Alvarez would
become coach at Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
The network had Ralph Wiley interview Alvarez later in the day, but because of
technical problems, had to cut away from it earlier than planned.
</P>
<P>
On this long day and night of football, the overall coverage and the announcing
was fine.
</P>
<P>
But something needs to be done about the logjam. The way things are now, it's
impossible to see everything.
</P>
<P>
Just trying is a real job -- and no fun.

bowl bids can formally be extended -- Saturday's games took care of delivering

<TEXT>     No. 11 Nebraska apparently needs only to beat Oklahoma on Nov. 29 to earn
the other Orange Bowl berth. The Cornhuskers and No. 16 Colorado are tied for
the conference lead, but Orange Bowl officials said they would take the higher
ranked team.;   "If we beat Oklahoma, we have Miami in Miami," Nebraska Coach
Tom Osborne said after his team's 38-13 victory over Iowa State. "It would be
a little better to have Florida State in Miami, but you take what's handed to
you.";   Osborne said it was his understanding that there is a deal in the
works to send the Big Eight runner-up to the Blockbuster Bowl and third-place
team to the Gator Bowl.;   If Nebraska beats Oklahoma and Colorado wins its
season finale against Iowa State, the 16th-ranked Buffaloes would face No. 7
Alabama in the Blockbuster Bowl. Oklahoma then would head for the Gator Bowl
against Virginia.;   The consolation prize for Florida State is a trip to the
Cotton Bowl to play the Southwest Conference champion on New Year's Day. Texas
A&amp;M needs one victory in its final two games to clinch the host spot.;
Nothing happened Saturday to disturb the Rose Bowl pairing of No. 3 Washington
and No. 4 Michigan, who clinched the Big Ten Conference title.;   Four other
Big Ten schools also are expected to receive bowl invitations.;   No. 9 Iowa
clinched second place in the Big Ten and earned a ticket to the Holiday Bowl
against the Western Athletic Conference champion. Despite Saturday's 20-0 loss
to Michigan, No. 25 Illinois is expected to go to the Sun Bowl against UCLA.;
 No. 18 Ohio State, which faces Michigan next weekend, will play No. 17
Syracuse in the Hall of Fame Bowl, and Indiana is expected to face Baylor in
the Copper Bowl.  </TEXT>

FIESTA BOWL DEFEATS ROSE BOWL IN TV RATINGS RACE, 17.0 TO 10.8

<P>
NBC's telecast of the Fiesta Bowl football game between national champion Notre
Dame and West Virginia on Jan. 2 drew a 17.0 national rating, the highest of
any bowl game this year, the network said.
</P>
<P>
Playing opposite the Fiesta Bowl, ABC's Rose Bowl had a 10.8 rating, lowest in
the television history of the game, NBC said.
</P>
<P>
The rating means an average of 17% of all U.S. TV households were tuned into
the Fiesta Bowl, or about 15.4 million households.
</P>
<P>
"The Fiesta Bowl, of course, was for the national championship, and it was the
highest-rated of the year, facing what traditionally is the highest-rated bowl
game," NBC research specialist Gray Seamans said. "And we beat it handily -- by
57%."
</P>
<P>
CBS' Cotton Bowl, in which UCLA defeated Arkansas, drew a 9.8 rating, lowest in
its history, and the Hall of Fame Bowl on NBC had an 8.1. The Citrus Bowl, on
ABC, had a 7.2 rating.
</P>
<P>
National ratings were announced earlier for NBC's Orange Bowl, 12.8, and ABC's
Sugar Bowl, 8.1, which were shown against one another in prime time.
</P>
<P>
Seamans said the highest-rated bowl game ever was the Orange Bowl's national
championship showdown 2 years ago, which had a 25.1 rating.

<TEXT>     "That certainly would be a possibility," Warren Goodrich, a Fiesta Bowl
representative, said Saturday after Tennessee upset Notre Dame 35-34 in South
Bend, Ind.;   "That would be a tremendous matchup.";   Next Sunday is the
first day bowl officials can officially extend bids to teams, and the Notre
Dame-Penn State and Miami-Florida State showdowns next Saturday could force
last-minute decisions.;   Goodrich said Notre Dame's loss expanded the matchup
possibilities.;   Sugar Bowl secretary Chuck Zatarain said Penn State, Cal,
Miami and Notre Dame are on his short list of teams being considered to play
soon-to-be Southeastern Conference champion Florida. But Penn State and Notre
Dame have two losses apiece.;   "Cal and Florida at 10-1 would be an excellent
Sugar Bowl," Zatarain said.;   The 20-member Sugar Bowl Committee will meet
Monday morning to determine "what direction" to take, Zatarain said.;   It
will consider the strength of schedules, fan support and attendance.;
Florida Citrus Bowl scout Elmer Cook said Penn State and Cal are on his short
list. He added that fan attendance is no longer an issue now that Clemson is a
virtual lock to sew up the Atlantic Coast Conference title and an automatic
berth in his bowl.;   One of the major issues still undecided is whether the
Fiesta Bowl would switch its starting time with the Hall of Fame Bowl. Both
are televised by NBC, and the Pacific 10 and Big Ten conferences prohibit
their teams from playing in bowls that conflict with the Rose Bowl on ABC.;
"We hope to get this resolved soon," Goodrich said.;   Cal Athletic Director
Bob Bockrath said he was hopeful that decision would come as early as today.;
 "We deserve to be in a Jan. 1 bowl, and the Sugar Bowl appeals with the money
($3.5 million payout to each team last season)," Bockrath said. "The Fiesta
and Florida Citrus bowls are excellent. . . . We couldn't go wrong."  </TEXT>

<P>
One by one, teams that were expected to contend for the Pacific 10 championship
have fallen by the wayside.
</P>
<P>
UCLA is out of it. So are Oregon and Washington. USC, the preseason favorite,
is 4-0 in the conference, and Arizona (4-1) is the only remaining challenger
unless Oregon State (3-1-1) upsets the Trojans Saturday at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
If USC wins and Arizona beats California at Berkeley Saturday, the probable
championship showdown would be Nov. 11 in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
Arizona is the only Pac-10 school that hasn't played in the Rose Bowl, and it
hasn't been a contender this late in the season. In fact, the Wildcats' 4-1
conference record is their best at this point of the season since the school
joined the Pac-10 in 1978.
</P>
<P>
One would assume, considering the stakes, that Arizona would be looking ahead
and have difficulty focusing on its game with Cal, 2-6 overall and 0-5 in the
Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
But Arizona Coach Dick Tomey said it won't be a problem.
</P>
<P>
"We won't have any trouble focusing on California," he said. "We remember very
vividly that they beat us last year. The Cal game is a key to everything.
</P>
<P>
"We've never played for first place this late in the year. We've never been
4-1. We're trying to get to a new level so we can control our own destiny."
</P>
<P>
Arizona gained some stature by beating Oklahoma, 6-3, earlier in the season.
Then the Wildcats routed UCLA, 42-7, on Oct. 14.
</P>
<P>
It was theorized at the time that Arizona surprised UCLA with a power-I
formation, an offensive diversion from its standard wishbone formation.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that big of a deal," said Tomey, who had dispatched two of his
assistant coaches to Boulder, Colo., the previous week to study the power-I
option offense that has been so effective for Colorado.
</P>
<P>
"The I-formation is so conventional. Everyone sees it all the time. So it
wasn't a radical thing. We added only one new play and blocked for it the same
as we do (in) the wishbone."
</P>
<P>
In any event, the Wildcats gained 480 yards rushing on the Bruins, the most
UCLA has yielded on the ground since its inaugural game with USC in 1929, when
the Trojans gained 753 yards rushing, still a conference record.
</P>
<P>
Tomey has made another late-season adjustment -- replacing starting quarterback
Ronald Veal with redshirt freshmen George Malauulu, formerly of Carson High
School.
</P>
<P>
"We have confidence in both quarterbacks," Tomey said. "We feel fortunate that
we have two guys here who can do the job."
</P>
<P>
And if Arizona does the job against Cal, it will reach an unfamiliar level.
</P>
<P>
The Big Eight has been referred to as the Big Two because the conference has
usually been dominated by Oklahoma and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
Now Colorado has an opportunity to change the power structure when it plays
Nebraska Saturday at Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
The conference's other coaches slightly favor No. 2-ranked Colorado over No.
3-ranked Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
Some opinions:
</P>
<P>
 -- Iowa State's Jim Walden: "Nebraska has to throw the ball and they're not
going to want to. They're a better throwing team than Oklahoma, but if you
don't throw the ball on Colorado, they're going to beat you into submission
because they've got as good a front seven as any team in the United States."
</P>
<P>
 -- Oklahoma State's Pat Jones: "My gut feeling is Colorado will win. We
haven't played them yet, but I've seen them on film. I think they have the most
talented team in the league, with height, weight and speed. It's not vintage
Nebraska, but Nebraska knows how to win."
</P>
<P>
 -- Missouri's Bob Stull: "They've both got good sets of running backs. I'd say
Colorado's are faster and Nebraska's are a little stronger, more balanced. The
striking thing about Colorado is team speed. They're very similar on defense.
</P>
<P>
Nebraska is led by fifth-year senior Gerry Gdowski, while Colorado quarterback
Darian Hagan is a good option runner who is also an accurate long passer.
</P>
<P>
Said Jones: "They're totally different types of athletes. Hagan is a quick guy,
very explosive, who can make things happen. Gdowski is not that kind of
quarterback, although he makes few mistakes and does a great job of taking
advantage of the people around him.
</P>
<P>
"I think if Nebraska can contain Hagan, make him have a subpar game, then
Nebraska will have a real chance to win."
</P>
<P>
"Stagg Fears Purdue" was a famous headline in a Chicago newspaper many years
ago when Amos Alonzo Stagg was coaching at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Update that headline to "Bo Fears Purdue."
</P>
<P>
That's right, Michigan Coach Bo Schembechler, whose team has a 6-1 record and
is 4-0 in the Big Ten, said he's nervous about a team that has lost six
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
"I figure if I get nervous, the kids will do the same things," said
Schembechler, noting that Purdue scored 21 points against Michigan State in the
last 6 1/2 minutes while losing, 28-21.
</P>
<P>
"An underdog will come in and let it all out. But it is how we think that will
determine if we win the game."
</P>
<P>
Michigan is a 35-point favorite.
</P>
<P>
If top-ranked Notre Dame remains unbeaten, it will probably play the winner of
the Colorado-Nebraska game in the Orange Bowl Jan. 1 with the national
championship possibly at stake.
</P>
<P>
"That's the logical thing right now if we remain unbeaten," said John Heisler,
Notre Dame's sports information director.
</P>
<P>
However, if you believe Lou Holtz, the Irish might not even accept a bowl bid
because the scheduling of final exams would make it difficult to prepare his
team for a New Year's Day game.
</P>
<P>
Sure, Lou. Notre Dame will pass up a possible $4.1-million payday and the
opportunity of repeating as national champion.
</P>
<P>
The Fiesta Bowl, which has been the site of two national championship games in
the past three years, hasn't despaired of a matchup involving Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
Nor has the Sugar Bowl, suggesting a matchup of the Irish and fifth-ranked
Alabama before a large Catholic population in the New Orleans area.
</P>
<P>
If Oregon State upsets USC, it will be the first time that the Beavers have
beaten the four California schools in the same year.
</P>
<P>
The Beavers haven't defeated the Trojans at the Coliseum since 1960, John
McKay's first game as USC's coach.
</P>
<P>
Florida State has rebounded from an 0-2 start to win six consecutive games, and
Coach Bobby Bowden said his Seminoles may be as good as any team in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Bowden said of his team's 24-10 win over previously No. 2-ranked Miami last
Saturday: "Them and us might be as good as anybody. We'll find out when Miami
plays Notre Dame (on Nov. 25)."

ON JAN. 1, IT WILL EITHER BE COLORADO NO.1 -- OR CHOAS
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
This was the college football season in which Colorado grieved, Notre Dame
misbehaved, Miami arrived late and Michigan lost early. Dennis Erickson took
over the Hurricanes, Bo Schembechler opted to quit coaching and Lou Holtz
babbled nonsense. Their various private sentiments and public posturing were
diverting. Now comes the purpose in all of this: which team will be No. 1?
</P>
<P>
Raised at a dinner table, it's a query that can make glasses jump with the
force of an argumentative fist. Perfectly respectable citizens are suddenly
struck by paroxysms of feeling that turn their faces the shades of school
colors. The national champion will be determined by the major bowl games on
Jan. 1, and there are a good handful of teams with equally justifiable claims,
all feeling the weight of a ring or seeing the outline of a trophy.
</P>
<P>
"It's out in front of you. That ring is closer," Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
Matters may be particularly contentious this New Year's Day. In an uncommon
mess of a year, only No. 1 Colorado went undefeated. The Buffaloes (11-0) will
meet defending national champion No. 4 Notre Dame (11-1) in the Orange Bowl,
and a Colorado victory would make everything simple. But a loss would let in
No. 2 Miami (10-1), which will go against Alabama in the Sugar Bowl, and also
No. 3 Michigan, which makes its case against Southern California in the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
The right circumstances could occasion the first split news-agency polls since
1978, when Alabama won No. 1 in the Associated Press but USC took the United
Press International coaches' vote on the basis of an earlier defeat of the
Crimson Tide. The similar possibilities this year raise a secondary argument,
between those who favor a playoff system and those who enjoy the intriguing
ambiguities of polls and bowls.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that spells instant national championship is if Colorado wins,"
Michigan defensive back Tripp Welborne said. "So to me, whatever comes, comes.
That's why it's mythical, that's what makes it interesting."
</P>
<P>
Each team has merits and drawbacks. Michigan was the pre-season No. 1, only to
lose its opener to Notre Dame, which took over the top place for 11 weeks.
Miami lost in midseason to archrival Florida State, and the team of the 1980s
had a confidence crisis. Then the Hurricanes upset the Fighting Irish in the
last game of the season, breaking their winning streak at 23 games.
</P>
<P>
All the while, Colorado's record grew steadily. The Buffaloes played on
swelling emotion, dedicating the year to late quarterback Sal Aunese, who died
of cancer this fall. But their season has to be viewed with some incredulity,
accomplished under such strange circumstances, and in the weak Big Eight as
Oklahoma was injury-prone and scandal-troubled and Nebraska was rebuilding. The
Buffaloes are No. 1 for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't really earn number one," offensive lineman Joe Garten said. "We
earned number two. Notre Dame was number one and they just gave it to us."
</P>
<P>
The ranking could be merely on loan. The Buffaloes have never played for a
national championship, and their sense of purpose may fail them, replaced by
nerves. The last time they were unbeaten was 1923. This is only their second
outright Big Eight title, and their first appearance in the Orange since Jan.
1, 1977. Their school's 11 championships all came in something more appropriate
for the locale, skiing.
</P>
<P>
"We realize it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," Coach Bill McCartney said.
"We couldn't expect to have this good fortune again. It wasn't realistic."
</P>
<P>
And yet they set 43 school records. Sophomore quarterback Darian Hagan operated
their option offense with aplomb, only the sixth player in NCAA history to gain
1,000 yards both passing (1,002) and rushing (1,004). They dashed off 83 plays
for 20 yards or more. For every easy rout over a lowly team, they pulled off a
convincing victory against the likes of Texas (27-6), Illinois (38-7) and
Washington (45-28).
</P>
<P>
Some observers wonder if the memorializing of Aunese wasn't a bit much: His
locker was glassed in and places reserved for him at team meals. Nebraska
players intimated they were milking his death. Garten called the suggestion
"disgusting," and it may have only redoubled the Buffaloes' determination.
There is little question they play with genuine conviction, which Notre Dame's
Holtz considers their scariest quality.
</P>
<P>
"A sense of purpose takes you to a higher level," Holtz said. "I don't question
that. It's impressive to an outsider."
</P>
<P>
If Colorado has the most emotion, Miami has the best timing. The Hurricanes
lost their purpose for a while under first-year coach Erickson and his
first-year starter at quarterback, Craig Erickson. The loss to Florida State,
with Erickson sidelined by a broken thumb, turned them temporarily into a
fractious team. On his return Erickson made a public scene of yelling at his
receivers, who criticized him equally. When they weren't arguing, they were
questioning the new staff or their self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
"We walked around like zombies," offensive lineman Mike Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
But the Hurricanes have played for the national championship in one form or
another every year since 1986. Dennis Erickson promised them they would have a
say in the '89 title race, appealing to their bedrock of confidence. One
victory re-established them, the climactic 27-10 defeat of the Irish.
</P>
<P>
"You could see it was still workable," defensive back Charles Pharms said.
</P>
<P>
They received considerable assistance in the rankings when they soared from No.
7 to No. 2, helped also when then-unbeaten and No. 2 Alabama fell to Auburn in
its last regular-season game. It put them in the best position a team with one
loss could ask for, and their Sugar Bowl game against Alabama is arguably an
easier task than Colorado faces in Notre Dame. They have ironed out problems
with Dennis Erickson's new one-back offense, and Craig Erickson has regained
his composure, although he has been persistently troubled by interceptions
(13).
</P>
<P>
Their season may be summed up by one remark. "Everything that needed to happen
did," Sullivan said. "Luck factors into any national championship. Someone gave
us a hell of a nice gift. I'd like to think it's an omen."
</P>
<P>
No team got more assistance in the polls than Michigan (10-1), inexplicably
ranked ahead of Notre Dame despite its 24-19 loss to the Irish Sept. 16. That
means the Wolverines could win their first national championship ever under
Schembechler, who will retire immediately after the Rose Bowl game and be
full-time athletic director. It would take the following: Miami must lose to
Alabama and Colorado to Notre Dame, but not by much. The Wolverines must
demolish the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
Those events, plus sentiment for Schembechler, could swing votes their way. But
the route is too circuitous for Schembechler to place much emphasis on it.
Their first priority must be to defeat USC, no mean feat in light of their
dreadful 2-7 history in the Rose under Schembechler. He publicly insists he is
content with a Big Ten title.
</P>
<P>
"We've already won a championship; this is icing," he said. "This is not a
crusade."
</P>
<P>
The Wolverines are not without solid arguments in their favor, however. The
loss to the Irish came on two flukish kickoff returns for touchdowns by Raghib
"Rocket" Ismail of 89 and 92 yards. They were forced to go with freshman
quarterback Elvis Grbac when starter Michael Taylor was injured early. Since
then they have won 10 straight games, which no other team but Colorado has been
able to do.
</P>
<P>
"It would be fitting and nice, but it's not necessary for us to feel
accomplished," Welborne said. "Things don't turn out sometimes. But this could,
easily."
</P>
<P>
While Miami and Michigan benefited from a fortunate convergence of
circumstances, Notre Dame couldn't have lost at a worse time. Nothing drops a
team so heavily as a late-season defeat. When the Hurricanes simply crushed the
Irish, their self-conviction was severely undermined. How will they grapple
with a loss for the first time in two years, and particularly the notion that
the title could be beyond their grasp? Even if they defeat the Buffaloes, No. 1
could swing to the Hurricanes, and Holtz has told them plainly their prospects
are not good.
</P>
<P>
"We know we must have help along the way," linebacker Donn Grimm said.
</P>
<P>
The loss to Miami may have been inevitable when viewed in the context of an
absolute trial of a season. Perhaps no colossus of a team could have survived
the Notre Dame schedule of eight bowl teams and the numerous controversies.
They lost players to disciplinary actions and were criticized for an unsightly
pre-game brawl with USC.
</P>
<P>
Holtz acknowledged, "I don't believe we'll get a lot of sentimental votes."
</P>
<P>
Against Miami they were uninspired. The offense led by option-oriented Tony
Rice, normally so machine-like, did not score a touchdown. A single play was
particularly emblematic: On third and 42 from his 7-yard line, Erickson
completed a bomb for a first down that resulted in a demoralizing scoring
drive.
</P>
<P>
"It took time to set in," Grimm said. "We were not accustomed at all to losing.
Not until we saw the consequence of it, dropping in the polls, did we accept
it. It was like a nightmare. You hoped you'd wake up and it hadn't happened."
</P>
<P>
But Notre Dame is not a team that yields easily. The Irish have the added
advantage that the burden of proof is on Colorado. "I don't believe we've got a
very good chance for the national championship," Holtz said, but then added
with typical obfuscation: "If we lose."

Notre Dame was proclaimed national collegiate football champion on all fronts
Tuesday, less than 24 hours after beating previously undefeated West Virginia,
34-21, in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
The Fighting Irish (12-0), ranked No. 1 for the final 6 weeks of the regular
season, received 58 1/2 first-place votes and 1,198 1/2 of a possible 1,200
points from a nationwide panel of 60 sportswriters and sportscasters in the
Associated Press poll.
</P>
<P>
Miami (11-1), the 1987 national champion whose only loss was at Notre Dame,
31-30, in October, finished second with 1 1/2 first-place votes and 1,141 1/2
points, followed by Florida State (11-1), Michigan (9-2-1) and West Virginia
(11-1).
</P>
<P>
UCLA (10-2) wound up sixth after downing Arkansas, 17-3, in the Cotton Bowl,
while USC (10-2) was seventh after losing to Michigan, 22-14, in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
The annual Kickoff game, staged in late August or early September at Giants
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., would like to match Notre Dame with UCLA, but
both schools have had lukewarm responses.
</P>
<P>
The Irish also were the unanimous choice of the National Football Foundation
and Hall of Fame's 12-man committee as winner of the MacArthur Bowl, emblematic
of the national championship.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Notre Dame won the Football Writers Assn. of America's Grantland
Rice National Championship Trophy. The Irish were the unanimous choice of a
5-man committee.
</P>
<P>
"Winning the national championship was never in my thoughts," Holtz said.
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, you dream about it. But I never really thought that it would happen to
me. I never thought I would coach a national championship team. It still hasn't
sunk in on me yet."
</P>
<P>
Holtz was unhappy with only one aspect of Notre Dame's Fiesta Bowl victory --
the penalties the Irish received for unsportsmanlike conduct.
</P>
<P>
When Holtz came on the field to calm his players late in the game, he was also
hit with a penalty.
</P>
<P>
"I think late in the game we got away from some of the things we believe in,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame, which finished 17th a year ago, was No. 13 in the preseason AP
poll. The Irish jumped to No. 8 by opening with a 19-17 victory over Michigan.
</P>
<P>
The Irish climbed to second before taking over the No. 1 spot after top-ranked
UCLA lost to Washington State on Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the AP Top 10 are Auburn, Clemson and Nebraska. The Second 10
consists of Oklahoma State, Arkansas, Syracuse, Oklahoma, Georgia, Washington
State, Alabama, Houston, LSU and Indiana.

COLLEGE GAME IS FEELING THE EFFECTS OF A
FULL SCHEDULE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  College Football

<TEXT>     It should be pointed out that Neinas considers himself "an above-average
football fan," which qualifies as a huge understatement. Neinas, the executive
director of the College Football Association, wants to keep up with all the
action.;    But it's not possible. His eyes don't move quickly enough, and
even the fastest remote control in the West would be woefully lacking.;
"Eight games," Neinas says. "It's too much. It's not fair to the fans.";
Especially for those fans with only one television set.;    Just when you
thought they couldn't stuff any more games into that overstuffed bag that is
New Year's Day, the bowls went ahead and did it. Starting at 8:30 a.m. with
the Gator Bowl and ending around 9 p.m. with the Sugar Bowl, there will be
eight games today, a football hater's worst nightmare.;    Eight is enough;
And it's hardly a dream for the bowls, either. For them, eight is more than
enough. In fact, eight is ridiculous. Furthermore, eight is one of the reasons
some of critics suggest the bowl system could be in trouble in the 1990s.;
The glut of games on Jan. 1 has the bowls extremely nervous. So do falling TV
ratings and the ever-expanding NFL season, which could squeeze several bowls
out of business. Then there's the threat that proceeds from corporate sponsors
might be subject to taxation, along with flaws in the selection process, which
has many in the college establishment fuming and screaming for a playoff.;
Indeed, this is not the best of times for the folks who run the bowl kingdom.;
   "We're not dead yet," said the Orange Bowl's Steve Hatchell, the head of
the College Bowl Association.;    But there are signs that the castle walls
are cracking. Nowhere is it more evident than the erosion of television
ratings, a lifeblood for the bowls, on New Year's Day.;    In a former life .
. .;    For years, Jan. 1 was the domain of the Rose, Sugar, Cotton and Orange
bowls, and they enjoyed the spoils. In 1981, the four bowls averaged an
impressive 19.9 ranking. The 1979 Rose Bowl had a 29.2 rating.;    However, in
1982, the Fiesta Bowl moved to Jan. 1. Last year, there were seven games on
that day.;    The glut's fallout could be inevitable. With ratings down,
rights fees from the networks might be reduced. And with exposure diminished,
corporate sponsors, which pay a significant portion of the bowls' ticket,
might think twice about writing the next check.;    "There's little question
the television marketplace is flattening out in the 1990s," said Big Ten
Commissioner Jim Delany, whose conference has a lucrative tie-in to the Rose
Bowl. "Sure, there's a concern.";    "How far can the television dollar go?"
Hatchell said. "Overexposure in an undistinguished market could be
detrimental.";    The obvious solution would be for the bowls to work together
to find remedies to their problems. But the bowls appear to be their own worst
enemies.;    The urgency to work together, though, might be greater than it's
ever been. Besides the ratings difficulties, the expansion of the NFL regular
season -- which goes to the last weekend in December -- significantly reduces
time slots available to the bowls, at least as far as television is
concerned.;    There's also the threat from the Internal Revenue Service.
Currently, the majority of the bowls take in large sums of money from
corporate sponsors. Because bowls are considered non-profit organizations,
those funds haven't been taxed. But the IRS is doing audits to see whether it
should change its policy.;    Hatchell and former Fiesta Bowl head Bruce
Skinner maintain the situation isn't as bleak as it seems. Revenues have gone
up, and payouts continue to grow every year.;    They maintain the system is
healthy, even if others disagree.;    "It's not in as bad a state as some
people have portrayed it," said the Orange Bowl's Hatchell. "There are a lot
of games with incredible interest. There's a lot of good football being
played.;    "Sure, we need some fine-tuning. That doesn't hurt in any
industry.";    But if the problems continue to mount, the bowls could go from
some fine-tuning to a complete overhaul. Even then, the day might come when

<HEAD>Miami Edges Notre Dame in Final AP Football Poll</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS lead to CLARIFY that poll that began 21 years ago was
postseason. A longer version moved on sports wires.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The University of Miami was voted national champion Tuesday in
the second narrowest voting since The Associated Press began its
postseason college football poll 21 years ago.
   Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz, whose team finished second, was one
of those who had a better choice in mind.
   ``You can justify why Miami won it. What you can't justify is
why we didn't,'' Holtz said a day after the Fighting Irish defeated
previously unbeaten and top-ranked Colorado 21-6 in the Orange Bowl.
   ``We played the toughest schedule, we had the best record ...
and we beat the No. 1 team quite decisively,'' Holtz said in an
emotional statement likely to renew debate over a playoff system.
   Miami won its third national championship in the last six years
by beating Alabama 33-25 in the Sugar Bowl on Monday night.
   The Hurricanes and Notre Dame each finished with one loss, but
Miami beat the Irish 27-10 on Nov. 25.
   ``There is no doubt in my mind that we're the best team in the
country,'' Miami coach Dennis Erickson said. ``It just happens that
it came down to two teams with one loss, and we beat them.''
   Miami (11-1) received 39 first-place votes and 1,474 points,
with Notre Dame (12-1) getting 19 first-place votes and 1,452
points. The 22-point margin was the second closest since the AP
began its postseason poll of sports writers and broadcasters in
1968.
   The other two first-place votes went to No. 3 Florida State, the
only team to beat Miami this season. Colorado fell to No. 4.
   Miami also was chosen No. 1 in United Press International's
coaches' poll, and by USA Today-CNN.
   Erickson said the close vote will increase calls for a playoff
in college football.
   ``The debate is going to go on until there is one. I really
believe down the road there will be a playoff system,'' he said.

BUFFALOES' VICTORY LIKELY TO CLINCH TITLE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  College Football
Orange Bowl
Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>   For the past three months, Charles S. Johnson has been haunted by a lasting
image. It was Johnson who directed Colorado's controversial fifth-down score
that beat Missouri on Oct. 6, evoking considerable outrage and inspiring
various jokes.;    "It's always that one play, that fifth down," Johnson said
after a recent practice, when the subject arose again. "I'm always going to be
remembered for that one play, not the game, and that's what bothers me about
this whole thing.";    Johnson can relax now. He came off the bench in the
second half Tuesday night, when starting quarterback Darian Hagan suffered a
knee injury, and quickly directed a legal touchdown drive to give Colorado a
10-9 Orange Bowl victory over Notre Dame and an almost certain national
championship.;    The Buffaloes (11-1-1), who came into the game ranked No. 1,
were denied their first national title by the Irish at last year's Orange
Bowl. They should take some solace in the fact that no team in NCAA history
that has gone into a bowl ranked No. 1 and has won its game has been passed
over for the championship.;    "Historically, when you're ranked No. 1 and you
go in and play a team as worthy as Notre Dame and beat them in a game like
this, then you should hold your ranking," Colorado Coach Bill McCartney said.
"Comparative scores mean nothing. We deserve to maintain our ranking. . . .
When you hold a team like Notre Dame to nine points, that's a significant
thing.";    There are sure to be people in Atlanta and points beyond who argue
that a precedent should come now. Some critics have pointed to the fifth-down
controversy at Missouri, saying Colorado should not have been here in the
first place. No. 2 Georgia Tech beat Nebraska decisively Tuesday and finished
unbeaten.;    Colorado, however, seems almost a lock to be named the champion
today. The Buffaloes played the most difficult schedule of any Division I team
this season, facing six top-20 teams. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch recently
polled 47 of 60 media members who vote for the national championship. Of those
respondents, 33 said the five downs would not affect their thinking. Seven
said they would refuse to vote for Colorado, and seven said they were
undecided.;    "I certainly hope they wind up with the national championship,"
Irish Coach Lou Holtz said. "But that's not in my control.";    Despite
Johnson's heroics, there was one final bit of fodder thrown to the voters as
the game neared its end. With 43 seconds remaining, Notre Dame junior Raghib
"Rocket" Ismail returned a punt 91 yards for an apparent touchdown. Halfway
through his incredible run, teammate Greg Davis was flagged for clipping Tim
James. The score was nullified.;    Davis said, "I don't think I clipped him."
Although James said he "thought I had a play on it," it may have been as big a
break for Colorado as the one Oct. 6.;    "The return by Rocket Ismail was one
of the greatest individual efforts I've seen," Holtz said. "I don't know if
the clip had anything to do with the return, but I certainly hope it did.";
It was one of many costly mistakes for the Irish. In the first half, an
extra-point try was blocked and they missed two field-goal attempts. They
committed three turnovers in a four-play span early in the second half, after
Johnson led the Buffaloes to their go-ahead score.;    That was Notre Dame's
biggest mistake: not capitalizing on the departure of Hagan. He was sandwiched
between two Irish tacklers and suffered a ruptured tendon in his left knee
with a minute remaining in the first half. The junior will undergo surgery
today in Colorado.;    Johnson started the second half for the Buffs, and a
third-quarter field goal by Craig Hentrich gave Notre Dame a 9-3 lead. Notre
Dame had blown open last year's game at the start of the second half, but
Johnson helped avoid a repeat of that.;    Colorado had to punt on his first
series of downs, but the Irish fumbled their subsequent play and the Buffaloes
took over at Notre Dame's 40. Johnson led them to a first-and-goal at the 4,
and Eric Bieniemy scored from a yard out on third down. Jim Harper's
point-after made it 10-9.;    "My stomach hasn't settled down yet," Johnson
said immediately after the game. "Hagan told me he had a vision during
practice earlier in the week that I would have to come in. That was strange.";
   One could not help but watch the sideline down marker closely during the
decisive drive. Because of a referee's error, Colorado was allowed five downs
in the game at Missouri. On the fifth down, Johnson scored a TD to give
Colorado a 33-31 victory on the game's final play.;    It cannot be assumed
that Colorado would have lost under proper conditions, because Johnson would
not have spiked the ball on what was believed to be third down (and actually
fourth). Still, it has been an issue that has lingered for months.;    "We
said then, no more partying," said Colorado tackle Mark Vander Poel. "It was
time to play together as a team. It was time to stop playing as individuals.";

<LEADPARA>  Cal fans probably will have to travel to Florida to watch their Bears in a
bowl game.;   And there's a chance the Bears might not play on Jan. 1 despite
their 8-1 record and No. 6 ranking.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A MAJOR LETDOWN FOR CAL
SUGAR, FIESTA BOWL HOPES NOT PANNING OUT FOR BEARS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  See also related story on P. 1E of this section  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Official announcements won't be made until Sunday. But Athletic Director
Bob Bockrath said Monday that the Bears' likely options have been narrowed to
the Florida Citrus Bowl in Orlando on Jan. 1 and the Blockbuster Bowl in Miami
on Dec. 28.;   Those choices became apparent after Bockrath received bad news
from Fiesta and Sugar bowl representatives.;   The Fiesta Bowl told Bockrath
on Sunday morning that it was unable to move its starting time to avoid a
conflict with the 2 p.m. Rose Bowl, thus blocking Cal's chance to accept a
bid. The Pacific 10 Conference won't permit its teams to appear in a game that
conflicts with the Rose, where unbeaten Washington seems to be headed, and NBC
wouldn't swap the Fiesta's starting time with that of the Hall of Fame Bowl.;
 Bockrath said he was informed Monday by Sugar Bowl executive director Mickey
Holmes that "the odds-on-favorite is still Notre Dame" to play the
Southeastern Conference champion, probably Florida.;   "My concern is that we
don't have a long tradition of bowl history to draw from," said Bockrath,
whose Golden Bears are 3-6-1 in bowls in the past 70 years. "Some bowls aren't
willing to take a chance on us. If it was all based on records, it would be
simpler.";   No. 8 Penn State and No. 12 Notre Dame, who have two losses each
and play each other Saturday, have more lucrative options than Cal, the
Pac-10's second-place team. Even if Penn State loses Saturday, it is likely to
play Tennessee in the Fiesta. And even if the Irish lose Saturday, they are
likely to play the Gators in the Sugar Bowl.;   Cal's best bet might be to
play the Atlantic Coast Conference champion, probably No. 15 Clemson (6-1-1),
in the Florida Citrus on Jan 1. In addition to its New Year's Day date, the
Florida Citrus is attractive to teams because Orlando is a tourism city and
the home of Disney World. The Citrus last year paid $1.35 million each to
Nebraska and Georgia Tech.;   Although the Blockbuster Bowl isn't played on
Jan. 1, Bockrath said the Dec. 28 game interests him because of its $1.8
million per-team payout, its lack of competition from other bowls and
prime-time television exposure (CBS).;   The Blockbuster also is interested in
the Florida State-Miami loser.;   Bockrath received a box of chilies from
executive director Cricket Musch of the Dec. 31 Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas,
but Bockrath said, "They're third, and they know that.";   Meanwhile, Sun Bowl
officials were trying to work a deal with the Pac-10, Big Eight and Big Ten to
attract two of their third-place teams.;   Stanford and UCLA are tied for
third in the Pac-10. The Sun Bowl guarantees $1 million for each participant,
$400,000 more than the Dec. 30 Freedom Bowl, the Anaheim-based game that also
is pursuing Stanford.  </TEXT>

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
Rating the five best New Year's Day bowl games:
</P>
<P>
1. Orange Bowl. Colorado can clinch the national championship, and should,
against a Notre Dame team that usually stinks out the joint in Miami. The Irish
will be in big trouble against the quicker Buffaloes if Rocket Ismail is slowed
by a shoulder injury. . . . 2. Rose Bowl. Bo Schembechler's retirement makes
this special. The Wolverines used to lose in Pasadena because they couldn't
pass. Now they are well-balanced (2,380 yards running, 1,818 passing). But the
key is the young USC quarterback, Todd Marinovich, who must regain his form
after an off day against UCLA. . . .
</P>
<P>
3. Fiesta Bowl. Florida State is playing better than anyone in the nation after
losing its first two games. Coming off a rare win over Oklahoma, Nebraska will
keep it close, high-scoring and entertaining. . . .
</P>
<P>
4. Sugar Bowl. Kickoff will be about a half-hour after the Orange Bowl starts,
and by the fourth quarter, Miami could be shooting for a national title. An
upset might silence Bill Curry's critics at Alabama -- at least for a month or
two. . . .
</P>
<P>
5. Cotton Bowl. In Arkansas and Tennessee they care very much about this
neighborhood brawl, but it will draw a yawn from the rest of the country. . . .
</P>
<P>
The best musical show will be in Pasadena, where the always powerful Michigan
band is matched against colorful USC. . . .
</P>
<P>
Trojan wide receiver John Jackson has completed the grand slam of athletic and
academic honors. A 3.30 GPA graduate in business who is working on his master's
degree, Jackson has won an NCAA postgraduate scholarship, been named to the
NCAA Top Six and been selected as a National Football Foundation
scholar-athlete, Woody Hayes scholar-athlete and first-team GTE academic
All-American. . . .
</P>
<P>
The rising star at NBC, Joel Meyers, will announce the Freedom Bowl on TV
Saturday and the Rose Bowl on radio Monday. . . .
</P>
<P>
Florida running back Emmitt Smith will be the center of attention in the
Freedom, but Washington center Bern Brostek is projected to be a first-round
draft choice. . . .
</P>
<P>
The AFC and NFC wild-card games each would receive more attention if they were
played on different days, but TV ratings are better on Sunday than on Saturday.
. . .
</P>
<P>
By now, we've gotten used to playoffs without the Raiders, Dolphins and
Cowboys. But no Bears, either? . . .
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for a couple of sleepers to make it to the Super Bowl, try
the Rams and Browns. . . .
</P>
<P>
Three of the top four offensive teams in the AFC didn't get into the playoffs
-- and neither did three of the top five defensive teams. . . .
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda says the first time he met Billy Martin was on the diamond. But the
sport was boxing. "I was pitching for Kansas City against the Yankees in 1956,"
the Dodger manager recalled. "I threw at him. A fight broke out. It wasn't long
after, though, that we became friends. You just had to be in the same room with
the guy for an hour to love him." . . .
</P>
<P>
Lasorda on Martin, the manager: "He knew how to motivate people. That made him
a winner." . . .
</P>
<P>
Regardless of his numbers, Brett Hull isn't half the hockey player his father
Bobby was. . . .
</P>
<P>
The change in the style of play in the NHL is reflected in the statistics of
Doug Harvey, the Hall of Fame defenseman who died Tuesday at 65. The most goals
he scored in a single season was nine. . . .
</P>
<P>
Robb Stauber, the goaltender out of the University of Minnesota who made Mark
Fitzpatrick expendable, still hasn't played for the Kings' New Haven farm club
because of groin and back injuries. . . .
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Jerry Burns and Burgess Meredith. . . .
</P>
<P>
The more thoroughbred racing there is, the less predictable it gets. . . .
</P>
<P>
What a pleasure it is to hear Trevor Denman call the races at Santa Anita
again. . . .
</P>
<P>
Their last 0.2-second defeat to the Celtics was just another step in the
learning process for the young Clippers. What they learned is that it helps to
be part of the NBA Establishment when crucial calls are made by officials. . .
.
</P>
<P>
Who else but Larry Bird and Magic Johnson did you expect to decide the outcomes
of two games in the same city the same night with free throws? . . .
</P>
<P>
NFL take note: The Clipper-Celtic game was long by NBA standards. It lasted 2
hours 15 minutes. . . .
</P>
<P>
It's easy to rap the Boston hierarchy for not keeping up with the Lakers, but
this would be a much different club if not for the Len Bias tragedy and the
defection of Brian Shaw to Italy. . . .
</P>
<P>
No team with Akeem Olajuwon in the lineup should have a losing record. . . .
</P>
<P>
Michigan will be the sentimental favorite on the moon Monday. Three Apollo 15
crew members who are graduates of the university left a UM flag there.

KTLA GARNERS MOST VIEWERS FOR COVERAGE OF ROSE PARADE
</P>

<P>
While the usual mob of early-rising revelers lined the streets of Pasadena, the
101st Tournament of Roses Parade was also being watched on television in more
than 2 million Southern California homes.
</P>
<P>
Between 8 and 10:30 a.m., 83% of all the TV sets that were in use in the Los
Angeles market were tuned to one of the five stations that aired this year's
assortment of floats, flowers, celebrities and marching bands.
</P>
<P>
As in the past, KTLA Channel 5, with its team of Bob Eubanks and Stephanie
Edwards and its promise of never leaving the parade for commercials, grabbed
the bulk of the viewing audience. KTLA had 1.1 million households -- more than
the other four stations combined.
</P>
<P>
KTTV Channel 11 was a distant second with about 419,000 homes. The three
network-owned stations, which broadcast the parade with repeated commercial
breaks to the entire nation, were far behind in the local race. KCBS Channel 2
attracted about 192,000 homes, while KNBC Channel 4 and KABC Channel 7 drew
about 143,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
On the football front, with USC shooting for its first bowl win in five years,
the Rose Bowl on KABC was far and away the most watched game of the day in Los
Angeles. The Trojans' 17-10 victory over the University of Michigan garnered a
23.1 local rating, meaning it was seen in more than 1.1 million homes.
</P>
<P>
Other New Year's Day local Bowl ratings (with each point representing 49,315
homes):
</P>
<P>
* Orange Bowl: Notre Dame vs. Colorado, KNBC: 18.3.
</P>
<P>
* Sugar Bowl: Miami vs. Alabama, KABC: 8.9.
</P>
<P>
* Hall of Fame: Auburn vs. Ohio St., KNBC: 8.
</P>
<P>
* Cotton Bowl: Tennessee vs. Arkansas, KCBS: 6.
</P>
<P>
* Fiesta Bowl: Florida St. vs. Nebraska, KNBC: 4.5.
</P>
<P>
* Citrus Bowl: Illinois vs. Virginia, KABC: 4.3.

MIAMI ONCE AGAIN MAY TAKE SPOILER'S ROLE AS BOWDEN SEEKS HIS 200TH VICTORY

<P>
The plot calls for one of football's most respected coaches to earn his 200th
career victory by beating a school that has twice denied him the national
championship.
</P>
<P>
Reviews are mixed.
</P>
<P>
Thumbs up, said Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden, who will try for No. 200
Saturday against Miami.
</P>
<P>
Thumbs down, Hurricanes Coach Dennis Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
"If he doesn't get it this game, I'm sure he'll get it some other game,"
Erickson said. "I'd prefer he wait a week or two."
</P>
<P>
The game didn't need the anticipation of a Bowden milestone to sell out the
Orange Bowl. With Florida State (4-0) ranked second and Miami (2-1) ranked
ninth, the hype would have been high anyway.
</P>
<P>
But the Seminoles say the chance to give Bowden No. 200 against his chief
tormentor is tantalizing.
</P>
<P>
Bowden, 60, is 6-10 against Miami; he's 193-62-3 against all other teams.
Losses to the Hurricanes cost him a No. 1 finish in 1987 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
The odds of reaching 200 against anybody are long. Ten major college coaches
have done it, and only one is active -- Penn State's Joe Paterno, who has 221
wins.
</P>
<P>
The odds of beating the Hurricanes are long, too. They have won 33 in a row in
the Orange Bowl. They haven't lost two games in one season since 1985.
</P>
<P>
"My biggest concern is stopping them," Bowden said. "They can get 50 points as
easily as they can get 25. It's a game of inches when you play them -- you miss
one inch, and they put it in the end zone."
</P>
<P>
A Florida State victory would strengthen its bid for a national title and move
the Seminoles into first place should top-ranked Notre Dame slip at home
against Stanford. The Cardinal gave the Irish (3-0) a tough game last year
before losing 27-17 and played 12th-ranked Colorado tough in its season-opener,
losing 21-17.
</P>
<P>
A loss probably would drop Florida State several spots in the rankings. No. 3
Michigan figures to have little trouble at Wisconsin and No. 4 Auburn should
roll at home against Louisiana Tech. No 5 Virginia and No. 6 Tennessee are
idle.
</P>
<P>
Other games involving Top Ten teams have No. 7 Oklahoma at Oklahoma State, No.
8 Nebraska at Kansas State and No. 10 Florida at home against Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
"It gets you hyped up," Stacey Satterwhite, an Oklahoma State defensive tackle,
said of the game against the Cowboys' arch-rival, Oklahoma.

   Who Cares Who's No. 1?

<LP>
   Pasadena, Calif. -- Washington beat Michigan in the Rose
Bowl here Wednesday, and a few hours later Miami beat
Nebraska in the Orange Bowl in Miami. The two winners thus
ended their seasons with 12 wins and no losses, making
certain that the burning question of "Who's No. 1?" in
collegiate football for the 1991 season will be inconclusive,
whatever the polls say. This will delight people who thrive
on ambiguity, controversy, argument and similar good stuff.
It will enrage those who would turn an interestingly complex
situation into a 2+2 equation with an exhausting post-season
tournament in the bruising sport.
   But New Year's Day could have turned out a lot better for
those of us who enjoy lots of pepper in our conversational
stew. If Michigan (10-1 going in) had beaten 11-0 Washington,
Nebraska (9-1-1) had beaten Miami (11-0) at Miami, Texas A&amp;M
(10-1) had beaten Florida State in the Cotton Bowl, and
Florida (10-1) hadn't been upset by Notre Dame in the Sugar
Bowl, five teams would have stood at 11-1 with the campaign
over, and one at 10-1-1. That would have made six -- count
em, six] -- teams with a legitimate claim to the Poll Bowl
national title. It might have boosted sales of beer, pretzels
and bandages enough to boot the economy out of its funk.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The outcome we did have, of course, is quite enough to
louden the cries of the post-season-tournament advocates, or,
at least, prompt them to push harder for the so-called Bowl
Alliance solution. That arrangement, cooked up last fall,
would give the Orange, Cotton, Sugar and Fiesta bowls an
improved shot at securing a No. 1 vs. No. 2 New Year's Day
match to decide the national crown.
   But a new bidder -- the Blockbuster Bowl, sponsored by the
video-store chain -- threw the deal into doubt by waiving a
few extra dollars before the noses of our institutions of
higher learning, and squabbles over who'll take the
second-place finishers of some of the Alliance's conference
customers have further roiled the waters. Suffice it to say
that things again look good on the healthy-chaos front.
   Just who will top the polls remained to be seen at this
writing yesterday, but off Wednesday's performance before a
capacity crowd of 103,000 in the ancient oval a terrific case
can be made for Washington. Coach Don James's Huskies didn't
just beat their 12 foes this term, they stomped them in true
No. 1 fashion by a 495-115 scoring margin. And they didn't
just beat Michigan, they routed, clouted and outsmarted the
champions of the Middle West. The score was 34-14, and the
final margin could have been wider.
   The first Michigan touchdown, in the second quarter,
followed a weird play in which the Wolverines got the ball on
the Husky 44-yard line after Washington was penalized for
interfering with a fair catch on a botched, bloop kickoff
(yes, you can fair-catch a kickoff). The second came in the
last period, against the Husky scrubeenies, after Washington
had taken a commanding, 34-7, lead.
   Washington outgained Michigan almost 2 to 1, 404 yards to
205, and about half of Michigan's output came after the game
had been decided. Led by Steve Emtman, a 6-foot-4, 295-pound
slab of a tackle, the quicker, stronger Husky defense
recorded six quarterback sacks and seven more tackles for
losses, and Michigan was able to make good on just two of 15
third-down plays. "Their defense just beats you around. It
may be the best I've seen," Michigan coach Gary Moeller said
later.
   The outsmarted part was carried out mainly by Billy Joe
Hobert, Washington's sophomore quarterback. He scored the
game's first touchdown, on the first play of the second
quarter, by stacking his blockers to the right side of a
formation and then darting alone through the left side for
two yards into the end zone. He kept another TD drive going
in quarter three when he sent out five wide receivers on a
fourth-down-and-one situation, then quarterback-sneaked
through a spread-out Wolverine defense. At other times, he
completed 18 of 34 passes for 192 yards, and shared the
game's most valuable player award with Emtman.
   The unkindest cut of all was supplied by Mario Bailey, the
Huskies' 168-pound jack rabbit of a senior wide receiver.
This young man had been overshadowed in the pre-game hype --
and in the season as a whole -- by his Michigan counterpart,
Desmond Howard.
   Howard is an admirable athlete who was lucky enough to
have captured the nation's psyche with a diving TD catch to
win a nationally televised game against Notre Dame on Sept.
14. Bailey, by contrast, has an identity problem even on his
own team, where he must share uniform No. 5 with cornerback
Dana Hall on a squad with 100-plus members, and his last name
with two other Baileys.
   But Bailey entered the game with more catches than Howard
this term (62 to 61), and more yards (1,037-950), and on
Wednesday he widened that margin by snaring six for 126 to
the closely guarded Howard's one for 35. And after his
showiest catch, for a 38-yard last-period touchdown, he stuck
out an arm and raised a knee in the pose of the player on the
Heisman Trophy. Howard, you may recall, had done the same
after a punt-return TD against Ohio State on Nov. 23 had
solidified his election to that august award.
   "I never practiced that {the pose} except in my dreams.
But, then, the whole game was kind of a dream game for us,"
Bailey grinned.
   James, the professorial-looking Washington coach, wouldn't
go that far, but he did lobby a bit for his team's election
as No. 1 afterward by wearing a shirt with the words "1991
National Champs" embroidered over a pocket. "This has been my
best team. I can't believe anybody's a whole lot better than
us," said the man who has won more games than any coach in
PAC-10 conference history in his 17 seasons at Seattle.
   And with lots of starters slated to return, James can look
forward to a prosperous 1992. He's so well stocked, in fact,
that he'll have two QBs from which to choose next season --
Rose Bowl-hero Hobert and Mark Brunell, whose pre-season
injury gave Hobert his chance to shine.
   But, hey, quarterback controversies are fun, too.

MIAMI TRIES HARDER, BUT STILL NO. 2 AFTER DEFEATING NEBRASKA
</P>

MIAMI
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The outcome is as certain as a show of hands in the Politburo, but the
University of Miami tried stuffing college football's ballot box one last time
Monday night, and the Hurricanes used an obliging Nebraska to do it.
</P>
<P>
Miami's 23-3 squeeze of the Cornhuskers in the Orange Bowl may have done
nothing to enhance its national championship aspirations, but it made the No. 2
Hurricanes early contenders in the running for sore winners of 1989.
</P>
<P>
If there was another game played for No. 1 Monday, Miami was slow to
acknowledge it. Notre Dame-West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl? At least one
Hurricane chose to tune out.
</P>
<P>
"It was such a boring game," Miami quarterback Steve Walsh said. "I watched
about a quarter of it."
</P>
<P>
Not that the Orange Bowl set new standards for excitement, or was worth
watching for much longer. It was 20-0 at halftime, and only a 50-yard field
goal by Nebraska kicker Gregg Barrios in the third quarter kept the Cornhuskers
from being shut out for the first time in 185 games -- since a 27-0 loss to
Oklahoma in 1973.
</P>
<P>
This was Nebraska's worst bowl defeat since 1967 -- a 34-7 loss to Alabama --
and it was the fewest points ever scored by the Cornhuskers in 27 bowl
appearances.
</P>
<P>
" More than anything else," Miami Coach Jimmy Johnson said, "that's what we
wanted to prove tonight and to the country -- that we were the very best. We
might not be No. 1, but at this time, we are the best football team in the
country."
</P>
<P>
At another time, back in October, the Hurricanes lost to Notre Dame, 31-30,
when a 2-point conversion failed.
</P>
<P>
"I told my team that we probably gave Notre Dame the ranking of No. 1 by not
kicking the extra point," Johnson said. "We're not normally that generous."
</P>
<P>
To Nebraska, Miami showed no quarter, especially a Hurricane defense that
sacked Cornhusker quarterback Steve Taylor 6 times, intercepted 2 Taylor
passes, held him to minus-2 yards passing in the first half, and 12 yards
rushing on 17 carries in the game.
</P>
<P>
The Cornhuskers, remember, entered the game as the nation's No. 1 team in
rushing offense, averaging 382 yards and more than 5 touchdowns a game.
</P>
<P>
But not on this surface, where Miami is unbeaten in its last 26 games.
</P>
<P>
This is how Nebraska's eight possessions went in the first half: punt, punt,
punt, punt, interception (by Maurice Crum), punt, blocked punt (by Bubba
McDowell, the 10th of his career), interception (by Rod Carter, fittingly on
the last play of the half).
</P>
<P>
"The big thing about Taylor tonight," said Miami defensive end Bill Hawkins,
who was in on 5 tackles and one of Miami's 6 sacks, "was that on the second
play of the game he tried to run a sprint around Greg (Mark, the defensive end
on the other side), and he contained him. After that, we just lowered the boom
on him.
</P>
<P>
"He definitely took some hits tonight. I got him a couple of times, Greg sacked
him twice, and everybody hit him at least a few times.
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you. He's a tough kid. After the game, I congratulated him and told
him he was a tough guy. A lot of guys would have just tried to lay on the
ground, because we really laid him out."
</P>
<P>
As relentless as the Miami defense was, there were those -- including Bob
Trumpy in the NBC broadcast booth -- who suggested that Johnson may have been
overzealous in proving the unprovable, that the Hurricanes were No. 1.
</P>
<P>
When Johnson was shown on the sidelines raging at the officials despite a
20-point lead, Trumpy said that although Johnson was a great guy and all, he
was leaving some people with the impression that he was "a used-car salesman."
</P>
<P>
When Walsh's backup, Craig Erickson, was throwing passes into the end zone with
29 seconds left, Trumpy was even more pointed in his criticism of the Miami
coach.
</P>
<P>
"This is unhealthy, this is not right, this is not good," Trumpy said. "This
offends a lot of people, and there's no reason for Jimmy Johnson to offend
them."
</P>
<P>
Just guess who was offended when Trumpy's remarks were relayed to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
"If they (the Cornhuskers) line up in a blitz, we're going to audible to a
pass," Johnson bristled, in explaining Erickson's attempted touchdown fling.
"We're not going to let anyone knock us on our backs, we haven't all year."
</P>
<P>
As for being characterized as a used-car salesman, Johnson snapped: "We play
the game with intensity, I coach with intensity. Some people should do their
jobs as well."
</P>
<P>
Though Walsh, a junior All-American, was named the game's most valuable player
and set Orange Bowl records for completions (21) and attempts (44) Monday
night, he didn't quite do the dazzling job expected.
</P>
<P>
He had 3 passes intercepted (2 by Nebraska cornerback Charles Fryar), was
sacked twice and spent most of the night dumping the ball off to his backs.
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Leonard Conley caught 2 passes for touchdowns -- one a 22-yarder when
he was wide open over the middle at the 7-minute mark of the first quarter, the
other a 42-yarder in which he turned a little flip toss into a sprint down the
left sideline, abetted by some terrific downfield blocking by Miami's wide
receivers.
</P>
<P>
Besides catching 4 passes for 94 yards, Conley also rushed 10 times for 40
yards, keeping Miami's first touchdown drive alive with an 8-yard run on a
third-and-7 play. Conley, as Walsh readily acknowledged, was at least as
deserving to be MVP.
</P>
<P>
"It was a frustrating game," said Walsh, who threw for 277 yards, more than
double Nebraska's total net yardage.
</P>
<P>
"We put 23 points on the board, but we really couldn't get any rhythm. They did
a good job of blitzing and moving guys around. When a team blitzes that much,
you have to take the short stuff."
</P>
<P>
It didn't help, either, that Walsh's best receiver, Andre Brown, had been
suspended a couple of weeks ago for unspecified disciplinary reasons.
</P>
<P>
But as much heat as Nebraska applied on Walsh, it couldn't compare to the
firestorm faced by Taylor, who finally was lifted by Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne
after one final, futile scramble in the game's closing moments.
</P>
<P>
"We knew Nebraska has trouble picking up the blitz," Miami defender Hawkins
said. "We watched film of the Missouri game, and they had trouble with
Missouri's blitz -- Missouri almost beat them."
</P>
<P>
And Missouri has nowhere near the speed, the quickness, the depth, the
coaching, the sheer skill of the Hurricanes, who just may be who they think
they are.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, they're the best football team we've faced this
season," said Osborne, who sought out Johnson to shake his hand after the game,
dispelling the suggestion that he would take public offense at the notion that
Johnson was trying to run up the score.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure that Notre Dame will be No. 1," Osborne said, "but I don't think
there are many teams that would come into the Orange Bowl and be favored to
beat Miami."
</P>
<P>
Walsh wasn't planning to stay up and watch any election returns in the future,
either.
</P>
<P>
"I sort of assumed Notre Dame was going to win," Walsh said of the Fiesta
showdown. "We really wanted to go out and show everybody we're the best team in
the country.
</P>
<P>
"And I fully believe that."

THE DEBATE CONTINUES: IS MIAMI, NOTRE DAME OR SAN DIEGO ST. NO. 1?
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What was Mike Downey smoking the day Notre Dame played Miami?
</P>
<P>
He obviously wasn't watching his "No. 1" team get kicked.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the Irish should be "fighting mad," but not because they were outvoted
in the polls -- rather, because they were duped into believing they were even
playing for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
Downey blames a second-rate selection system when the fault lies in some
third-rate bowl game matchups: How the loser of the Notre Dame-Miami game ends
up playing the No. 1 team in the Orange Bowl; the loser of the Alabama-Auburn
game ends up playing No. 2 team in the Sugar Bowl; and the country's hottest
team (Florida State) doesn't even get a shot at Notre Dame, Auburn or Miami is
a mystery.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sunday night football finally has arrived. . . .
</P>
<P>
And Willie (Flipper) Anderson forever will be remembered for the night in New
Orleans when he replaced Henry Ellard in the Los Angeles Ram game plan and
Stephone Paige in the NFL record book. . . .
</P>
<P>
Last year, Anderson caught 11 passes for 319 yards. Sunday night, he caught 15
passes for 336 yards. . . .
</P>
<P>
The Flipper File: He is 6-0, weighs 172 pounds, was born and raised in
Paulsboro, N.J., led UCLA in receiving his senior year, was drafted on the
second round in 1988, and was nicknamed as a baby by his grandmother Pearl, who
thought he sounded like a dolphin when he cried. . . . Maybe Al Davis should
consult with Art Shell before moving the Raiders to Northern California. Shell
is unbeaten and untied in four games as a head coach at the Coliseum. . . .
</P>
<P>
Shell never would have been able to celebrate a happy 43rd birthday Sunday
without the aid of the Raider chapter of the Penn State Alumni Club. Wide
receiver Mike Alexander caught a touchdown pass, fullback Steve Smith ran for a
touchdown and guard Steve Wisniewski recovered Smith's fumble on the New
England nine-yard-line to keep the winning field goal drive alive. . . .
</P>
<P>
NFL coaches on the hot seat: Seattle's Chuck Knox, Atlanta's Marion Campbell,
New England's Ray Berry, Indianapolis' Ron Meyer, Houston's Jerry Glanville and
the Jets' Joe Walton. . . .
</P>
<P>
Bounty or no, the Eagles took a cheap shot at Cowboy kicker Luis Zendejas on
Thanksgiving Day and Coach Buddy Ryan should be disciplined by the league. . .
.
</P>
<P>
Ranting and raving Mike Ditka looks as though he's a candidate for another
heart attack. . . .
</P>
<P>
What a fascinating, wide-open year this would be for a national football
championship tournament. . . .
</P>
<P>
Any of eight teams -- Colorado, Michigan, Florida State, Miami, Notre Dame,
Alabama, Nebraska or USC -- would be capable of winning it. . . .
</P>
<P>
How far should Notre Dame be dropped in the rankings after its only defeat in
the last two years? . . .
</P>
<P>
Last week, former Miami Coach Howard Schnellenberger said the Fighting Irish
weren't in the same league with the Hurricanes. I guess he didn't just mean
that both are independents. . . .
</P>
<P>
It was difficult even for the most avid Notre Dame haters to root for
swaggering, strutting, finger-pointing Miami. . . .
</P>
<P>
For the first time all season, Notre Dame looked a step slow. Or maybe it's
that Miami is a step faster than anybody outside Tallahassee, Fla., and
Boulder, Colo. . . .
</P>
<P>
Lou Holtz didn't give Rocket Ismail enough to do Saturday in the Orange Bowl. .
. .
</P>
<P>
The Notre Dame fumble that was ruled a non-fumble is another reason why the
NCAA should go to instant replay. . . .
</P>
<P>
Houston quarterback Andre Ware now is being projected as a comfortable winner
in the Heisman Trophy balloting. . . .
</P>
<P>
The many comparative scores of the Rose Bowl rivals: Michigan 28, Ohio State
18. USC 42, Ohio State 3. Michigan 24, Illinois 10. Illinois 14, USC 13.
Michigan 24, UCLA 23. USC 10, UCLA 10. Notre Dame 24, Michigan 19. Notre Dame
28, USC 24. . . .
</P>
<P>
Decisions, decisions: ABC reporter Jack Arute asked an Illinois fan at the
Northwestern game Saturday if he would rather have his team go to the Rose Bowl
or the Citrus. . . .
</P>
<P>
Most unusual Nov. 25 matchup was Boston College at Georgia Tech. . . .
</P>
<P>
The Coliseum scoreboard doesn't give enough out-of-town scores. . . .
</P>
<P>
Commentator Bill Walsh claims that this is the best San Francisco team ever.
Wonder if he would be saying the same thing if he were still coaching the
49ers. . . .
</P>
<P>
There are more championships and fewer boxers around to fight for them than
ever before. Tonight in Paris, 36-year-old Dwight Muhammad Qawi gets a shot at
the vacant WBA junior heavyweight title against the famed Robert Daniels. . . .
</P>
<P>
Tex From Texas, a 2-year-old colt stabled at Hollywood Park, was bred in
California. . . .
</P>
<P>
Dave Johnson screamed, "And down the stretch they come!" when he called a
steeplechase race on ESPN. . . .
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, Easy Goer is favored over Sunday Silence in next year's Breeders'
Cup Classic at the Sands Hotel future book in Las Vegas. . . .
</P>
<P>
I broke into a sweat watching the Maui college basketball tournament being
played in a gym where the temperature was 90 degrees. . . .
</P>
<P>
Golden State is talking to Dallas about a trade for Roy Tarpley, who is
suspended and most likely will not play another game for the Mavericks. The
Clippers, who have future draft choices to spare, also are interested in
Tarpley.

<LEADPARA>  YOU can understand why Chuck Rohe is feeling just a lit-tle bit sensitive
these days. He is the executive director of the Florida Citrus Bowl in
Orlando, which is known around here as the Second Choice Bowl.;   A nice
second choice, to be sure. But still a second choice. When the Cal football
team accepts a Citrus Bowl bid today to meet Clemson on New Year's Day -- it's
a done deal, trust us -- Rohe knows that those Cal alums in funny blue caps
will continue to believe their Golden Bears deserve to be playing in the Sugar
Bowl instead.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  FLORIDA TRIP CAN BE SWEET  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     You know, the Sugar Bowl. New Orleans. More prestige, more tradition, more
saxophones, more staggering drunks.;   "The only thing I'll say about that,"
Rohe said Saturday, "is that in four of the last six years, our Citrus Bowl
television ratings have beat out the Sugar Bowl. Now, one reason is that they
were going up against the Orange Bowl most of the time, but it's still a valid
ratings number.;   "As far as tradition goes," Rohe continued, "we've been
sold out 11 years in a row. And last year, we had the national champion come
out of our game.";   Well, to be totally accurate, it was only half a national
champion: Georgia Tech, which shared the title with Colorado when each one
finished No. 1 in separate wire-service polls. And the only reason Georgia
Tech played in Orlando was that as the Atlantic Coast Conference champion, the
school was contractually obligated to appear there, as Clemson is this
season.;   But hey, you can't blame Rohe for trying to put a good spin on the
Citrus Bowl picture. That is his job. Will the Cal fans and players buy it? He
hopes so.;   After Saturday's 25-6 victory over Arizona State, the Bears have
a 9-1 record and will hold onto their No. 6 national ranking. Yet the Sugar
Bowl people passed over Cal and selected Notre Dame -- which was ranked No. 12
last week and will fall even farther after Saturday's loss to Penn State. That
gave the Irish an 8-3 record and gave Cal much cause to gloat.;   "How'd Notre
Dame do today?" Cal Coach Bruce Snyder asked mischievously in the locker
room.;   "Lost by 22 points," someone told him.;   "Jeez, too bad," said
Snyder, shaking his head in mock sympathy.;   Mike Pawlawski, the blunt Cal
quarterback, was even more blunt.;   "Notre Dame lost, huh?" Pawlawski asked.
"I love it. Sugar Bowl heroes, huh? I'm going to Disney World . . . You know,
I don't understand how people, writers or fans or whoever, can talk about a
'bad bowl game.' To me, they're all good.";   Technically, of course, no bowl
can make any "selection" until today. But despite an alleged rule that
prevents games from making early picks, every bowl committee cut a deal of
some sort last week. That is why Rohe and another Citrus Bowl scout, Elmer
Cook, were standing outside the Cal locker room Saturday, handing out lapel
stickers. No scouts from any other bowls were even at the stadium.;   So you
can expect the obvious today: The Berkeley Bears are headed for the Country
Bear Jamboree at the Magic Kingdom. Not to mention the gauntlet of other
Orlando theme parks. There are many worse ways to spend a holiday break.;   "I
think the team will be thrilled to get the (Citrus) bid," Snyder said. "If
somebody had told me a few years ago we were going to be playing on a New
Year's Day with a team that had nine wins . . .";   That's a point worth
stressing over and over again, to all hands involved. The Cal football team
has come a long way in two seasons, and deserves to bask in whatever limelight
it can, but let's face facts. Bowls love teams that draw huge television
ratings and/or send planeloads of alumni who come to town and spend money by
the barrel.;   Cal is not yet in that class. Those who wonder why only had to
stop by Memorial Stadium on Saturday afternoon. The place was only two-thirds
full, even though this is the best Cal team in 30 years -- and the last home
game for the senior class that made it so. Major bowl teams draw capacity
crowds to their home games, not 46,000 people in a 76,000-seat stadium.;
Rohe and his Citrus Bowl, however, are still delighted to have Cal. It gives
the game a top 10 team to brag about, plus it should help pick up a few TV
ratings points for ABC on the West Coast. The Citrus people don't have to
worry about selling tickets to Cal fans. Clemson's campus is less than a day's
drive away from Orlando, and Clemson maniacs should snarf up whatever's left
of the 11,000 seats that will be allocated to Cal.;   "I hope we'll sell all
of them to Cal fans," Rohe said. "If not, I know the Clemson people will buy
them. But I just don't think that when all is said and done, the Cal people
will regret coming to our game.";   Even if, instead of Bourbon Street and
jazz, the Bears will now get Donald Duck and the great squeeze-off.;   That's
right, the great squeeze-off. Cal fans, make sure to set your VCRs for this
one.;   "We do that at Disney World when the two participating teams go
there," Rohe explained. "Each of the teams picks three players. One guy slices
up oranges, one guy squeezes them, and one guy pours the juice into a pitcher.
They race against each other for five minutes and see who squeezes the most
juice. It gets pretty sloppy.";   They can ship the dregs by Federal Express
to Notre Dame.  </TEXT>
