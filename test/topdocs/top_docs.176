<P>
Rick Vaive has always been a high scorer in his 10 seasons in the National 
Hockey League, but always for a team struggling to get out of the second 
division. 
</P>
<P>
A month ago, the lowly Chicago Blackhawkstraded him to the Buffalo Sabres, 
another struggling team. 
</P>
<P>
But with Vaive leading the way, the Sabres are no longer struggling. They are 
the hottest team in hockey. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at Buffalo, Vaive scored his 12th goal in 14 games since joining 
the Sabres to lead them to a 4-2 victory over the best team in the National 
Hockey League, the Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres extended their unbeaten string to 9 games (7-0-2) and took over 
second place in the Adams Division. They trail the Canadiens by 20 points and 
will play them at Montreal tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Vaive, who scored more than 50 goals three times for weak Toronto teams, has 15 
points in his last 10 games. On Friday, he assisted on Scott Arniel's goal, 
which gave the Sabres a 2-0 lead before the game was 5 minutes old. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 8, New Jersey 6 -- Ron Francis had a hat trick and Kevin Dineen scored 
twice at East Rutherford, N.J., as the Whalers extended their unbeaten streak 
to 5 games (4-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers overcame a 3-goal deficit to hand the Devils their sixth loss in 
the last 9 games. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 8, Toronto 1 -- Steve Yzerman had a goal and 2 assists at Detroit to 
become the first player in Red Wing history to score 100 points twice in his 
career. Yzerman has 45 goals and 56 assists for 101 points. Last season, he had 
50 goals and 52 assists for 102 points. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings, who extended their lead in the Norris Division to 12 points over 
St. Louis and Minnesota, fired 53 shots at Toronto goalie Ken Wregget. DAN

Pierre Turgeon scored a goal and had three assists to help the Buffalo Sabres 
wipe out a 3-0 deficit with five goals in a row and beat the Montreal 
Canadiens, 5-3, Friday night at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Turgeon tied the score with his 27th goal of the season 1:16 into the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo's Dave Andreychuk, who had missed seven games because of a knee injury, 
returned to the lineup and had a goal and an assist. 
</P>
<P>
Sabre Coach Rick Dudley said having the 6-foot-3 Andreychuk in the lineup makes 
"a huge difference." 
</P>
<P>
"He makes it a little easier on Pierre because they have to concentrate on both 
of them," Dudley said. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens looked strong in building a 3-0 lead on goals by Guy Carbonneau, 
Mike McPhee and Mathieu Schneider before Buffalo exploited an inexperienced 
defense that was playing without last year's Norris Trophy winner, Chris 
Chelios. 
</P>
<P>
Chelios was sidelined because of a knee injury and without him in the lineup, 
the Sabres were able to force giveaways by the Montreal defense and camp in 
front of Canadiens' goalie Patrick Roy for easy tap-ins. 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of the first Buffalo goal by Doug Bodger, the Sabres scored 
from in close. 
</P>
<P>
Turgeon's game-tying goal early in the third period was the longest shot of the 
bunch -- it came from about 15 feet out. Goals by Andreychuk, Dave Snuggerud 
and Benoit Hogue all came from barely outside the crease. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres ended a two-game losing streak, took a four-point lead over 
third-place Montreal in the Adams Division and won the season series against 
the Canadiens, 4-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
N.Y. Rangers 2, New Jersey 1 -- Bernie Nicholls set up power-play goals by Ulf 
Dahlen and John Ogrodnick and goalie John Vanbiesbrouck made 29 saves as the 
Rangers won at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The victory was the only Rangers' second in their last five games, but it 
stretched their overall streak to 9-4-3, moving them back into second place in 
the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey is 1-5-3 in its last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 3, Winnipeg 3 -- Mark Recchi's second goal of the game in the third 
period pulled the Penguins into a tie at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 9, Philadelphia 6 -- Steve Yzerman scored two goals and added four 
assists at Detroit as the Red Wings extended their unbeaten streak to four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 2, Edmonton 2 -- Doug Lidster scored early in the third period at 
Vancouver as the Canucks overcame a two-goal deficit to tie the Oilers.

LATE GOAL GIVES CANADIENS A 2-2 TIE WITH THE SABRES

<P>
In recent years the Buffalo Sabres have looked great on paper, but not too 
sharp on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
However, under first-year Coach Rick Dudley, they are beginning to look good on 
the ice, too. 
</P>
<P>
Although they haven't played in many important games for sometime, they 
responded willingly in a showdown with Montreal Friday night at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
But they allowed Shayne Corson to get free and he scored with just two seconds 
left in regulation to get the Canadiens a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens had pulled goaltender Brian Hayward for an extra attacker when 
the Sabres iced the puck with five seconds remaining. The puck just missed 
going into the open net. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens won the ensuing faceoff and defenseman Chris Chelios found Corson 
open near the side of the net. Corson scored his 14th goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres, with Pierre Turgeon scoring his 18th goal, then setting up Rick 
Vaive for his 14th, dominated the early play. 
</P>
<P>
With a 22-9-5 record, the Sabres are nearing the midway point of the season 
with a four-point lead in the Adams Division over the Canadiens. Buffalo has 
the best record in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to leave the message that we're still around," Canadien Coach 
Pat Burns said. "The Sabres are the hot team." 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 5, Philadelphia 4 -- Kirk Muller scored at 1:18 of overtime at 
Philadelphia to lift the surprising Devils. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils, now 2-0-1 this season at the Spectrum, moved within one point of 
the first-place Flyers and New York Rangers in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
The loss was the third straight for the Flyers, who dropped to 16-16-4 in their 
last home game until Jan. 11. They begin a seven-game road trip tonight in 
Montreal. New Jersey also got back to the .500 mark with a 16-16-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
"A win like this can give us a big lift," Coach John Cunniff said. "It would be 
a nice Christmas present if we could win tomorrow night and move into first 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, Chicago 3 -- Tom Fergus and Ed Olczyk scored 18 seconds apart in the 
third period at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leafs had just killed off a four-minute power-play when Fergus took a 
pass from Daniel Marois, when around Dave Manson and beat Jacques Cloutier with 
a 20-foot wrist shot at 5:34. 
</P>
<P>
Olczyk, a former Blackhawk, then beat Cloutier from the left circle for a 4-2 
lead. The loss ended Cloutier's eight-game winning streak at Chicago Stadium.

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Mogilny, the first member of the
Soviet National Team to defect to the West, arrived Friday night in
Buffalo, where he hopes to continue his hockey career with the
NHL's Buffalo Sabres.
   Sabres General Manager Gerry Meehan accompanied Mogilny from
Stockholm, Sweden, after the budding Soviet star decided to defect
following the World Hockey Championships, which ended earlier this
week.
   Mogilny, regarded as one of the Soviets' future stars, was
supposed to appear at a news conference called by the Sabres, but
Meehan said the 20-year-old winger was tired from the trip and
interviews with immigration officials.
   ``His day has been so tiring, we didn't want to put him through
another exhausting round of exposure,'' said Meehan, who declined
to say where Mogilny was staying.
   Meehan also denied an accusation by the official Soviet news
agency Tass that the Sabres were guilty of ``piracy'' in bringing
Mogilny to the United States.
   ``The Buffalo Sabres were totally open and above-board'' in
dealing with Mogilny, he said. The Sabres began talks with Mogilny
``at the specific request of the player,'' Meehan said. ``It was a
voluntary departure.''
   Meehan would not say whether Mogilny had signed a contract and
also declined comment on published reports that indicated a
romantic relationship with an American woman may have been involved
in the defection.
   Meehan admitted there are potential problems with international
ice hockey officials, the NHL and American immigration officials
that could keep Mogilny from playing for Buffalo.
   ``I wouldn't say they (his chances of playing with Buffalo) are
pretty good or pretty bad,'' he said ``There are hurdles that have
to be resolved.''
   Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov said the defection cast a shadow
over attempts by other Soviet players to sign with NHL teams.
   Soviet coach Viktor Tikhonov said he was disgusted by the
defection and said it cast a shadow over attempts by other Soviet
hockey players to sign with NHL teams.
   Vyacheslav Koloskov, head of the soccer and hockey department of
the State Sports Committee, said in an interview published Friday
in the government daily Izvestia he expected no serious
repercussions in Soviet-NHL relations.
   Mogilny was accompanied on the flight from Stockholm by Meehan
and Don Luce, the Sabres' director of amateur development.
   Upon his arrival, Mogilny, who was a member of the Central Red
Army team, was interviewed at the airport by the FBI. ``They do
that with all defectors,'' said Tom Middlemiss, of the Port
Authority of New York &amp; New Jersey.
   Meehan said Mogilny first contacted the Sabres by phone on
Tuesday, then met with Meehan and Luce in Sweden the following day.
   ``I had no idea he wanted to come on Tuesday. It happened very
fortuitively,'' he said. He said the Sabres did not contact the NHL
before meeting with Mogilny.
   Meehan said many details, including presumbly Mogilny's status
as a Soviet defector, had to be worked out, but he said there was
plenty of time, since the start of the next NHL season is five
months away.
   ``We hope he'll be able to play next year,''he said.
   Meehan refused to discuss any details about a contract or
Mogilny's status with immigration or whether he had been granted
asylum.
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Mogilny, who helped the Soviet
Union to its 21st world hockey title last week, was granted a U.S.
visa on Thursday.
   Mogilny was in his third year with the Red Army team and played
11 international matches with the Soviet national team before this
season. He was voted the world's best junior player by NHL scouts
in a poll organized by The Hockey News.
   But the right wing had his troubles with Soviet hockey
authorities. He was suspended for 10 days before the world
championships after a fight in a Soviet league game.
   A Swedish newspaper reported last week that Mogilny had a
month's salary withdrawn and lost his ``Master of Sports'' order.
   He was also quoted by Aftonbladet newspaper as saying he was not
interested in a military career. ``I want to do something else with
my life,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Mogilny's role as a junior lieutenant in the Soviet Army added a
further diplomatic complication. Soviet authorities could view the
incident as desertion.

BOSTON BRUINS STILL BUFFALOED BY SABRES AFTER LOSING FIRST GAME, 6-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Buffalo Sabres struggled to edge the Hartford Whalers for third place in 
the Adams Division. The Sabres needed to finish third to play the one team they 
dominated during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
It was only because they played the tough Boston Bruins eight times that the 
Sabres finished above .500. They were 5-0-3 over the Bruins in the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The mastery continued in the opening game of the playoffs Wednesday night at 
Boston. The Sabres, with four power-play goals in the first two periods and 
outstanding goaltending from Jacques Cloutier, romped to a 6-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres dominated from the start and Cloutier had few really tough moments. 
He stopped 29 shots and registered his first playoff shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Cloutier, the backup goalie, replaced injured Clint Malarchuk, who suffered a 
deep slash in his neck, and was 4-1 in the last five games. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his club's poor showing against Buffalo during the regular season, 
Bruin Coach Terry O'Reilly was confident there would be a change in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to slight Buffalo's goaltending," O'Reilly said. "But I feel real 
confident with our goalies. 
</P>
<P>
He selected Reggie Lemelin, who gave up six goals on 19 shots, the Sabres 
getting three goals in their first six shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins will get another chance to beat the Sabres for the first time this 
season tonight, again at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 4, Calgary 3 -- The Flames were expected to blow away the Canucks in 
four. Instead, the Flames find themselves down, 1-0, after a former Flame, 
defenseman Paul Reinhart, scored at 2:47 of overtime at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Halfway through the third period, Petri Skriko brought the Canucks even with 
the first playoff goal of his career. 
</P>
<P>
Thwarted after moving in front, 3-1, in the second minute of the second period, 
the Flames fired six shots at goalie Kirk McLean in 2 1/2 minutes of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The teams play again tonight at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 3, New York Rangers 1 -- Two-time scoring champion Mario Lemieux was 
a little shaky in his first playoff appearance, but fortunately, in Paul 
Coffey, the Penguins had a playoff-tested star. 
</P>
<P>
The offensive-minded defenseman scored two power-play goals at Pittsburgh to 
give the Penguins a 1-0 lead in the best-of-seven series. 
</P>
<P>
Lemieux had an assist, but most of the night he seemed to be bothered by the 
close-checking Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
Goalie Tom Barrasso, also a veteran of Stanley Cup play, gave a solid 
performance, stopping 26 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 6, Hartford 2 -- As expected, the Canadiens breezed in their opening 
game at Montreal. A short-handed goal by Ryan Walter early in the second period 
gave the Canadiens a 3-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
They broke it open with three scores in the last period. It was a costly win. 
Veteran forward Bob Gainey, just back after missing six games with a sprained 
left knee, reinjured the knee in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 3, Philadelphia 2 -- For the first half of the game at Landover, 
Md., the Flyers played tough defense and held a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But within 95 seconds shortly after the middle of the second period, the Flyers 
lost it. 
</P>
<P>
First, Rick Tocchet lost control of the puck at center ice, Kevin Hatcher got 
the puck and set up Michal Pivonka for the tying goal. The Capitals quickly 
went in front when Dale Hunter knocked Gord Murphy of the Flyers off the puck 
and Lou Franceschetti grabbed it, went behind the net and his wraparound shot 
hit goaltender Ron Hextall's stick into the net for the decisive goal. 
</P>
<P>
Goals by Brian Propp and Tim Kerr in the first 12 minutes gave the Flyers a 2-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 3, Chicago 2 -- Dave Barr scored two goals, and the Red Wings' tight 
defense led the way at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit goalie Greg Stefan faced only 23 shots, but the Blackhawks scored 
twice. However, Alain Chevrier, who had a 3-0 record against Detroit this 
season, couldn't handle Barr. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 4, Minnesota 3 -- It was only fitting that Brett Hull, who led the 
Blues in scoring during the regular season, would get the winning goal at St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Hull, who had 41 goals, scored at 11:55 of overtime. Bob Brooke, who had not 
scored since March 7, scored the three North Star goals. His last, with 2:35 
left in regulation, sent it into overtime. DAN HAFNER

<LEADPARA>  The Sharks didn't see Pat LaFontaine when they visited the Buffalo Sabres on
Oct. 25, and they would have been happy if LaFontaine had been someplace other
than the Cow Palace on Tuesday night.;   LaFontaine, obtained by the Sabres in
a seven-player trade with the New York Islanders on the day the Sharks visited
Buffalo, scored his eighth career hat trick to lead the Sabres to a 7-1
victory over the Sharks before another Cow Palace sellout of 10,888.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  LAFONTAINE LEADS SABRES TO EASY WIN OVER SHARKS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "We gave him a lot of opportunities, and he gave an indication of why he's
one of the best players in the league," Sharks Coach George Kingston said.
"When you're facing a player like that, you have to make sure that you're
concentrating on playing good defense.";   LaFontaine didn't arrive in Buffalo
in time to face the Sharks in the first meeting between the teams, which the
Sabres won 3-1. But his presence in the rematch helped make life easy for
Sabres goalie Tom Draper, who was pressed into duty when Daren Puppa suffered
a broken bone in his left forearm during the Buffalo's morning practice
session.;   Draper, who was making his first start of the season and ninth
career NHL appearance, stopped 41 of the 42 shots he faced to hand the Sharks
(3-16) their first loss in three games. The 42 shots by the Sharks were a
season high.;   The Sabres received two goals from Donald Audette and single
scores from Doug Bodger and Randy Wood. Alexander Mogilny had three assists
for the Sabres. Pat Falloon scored a power-play goal off assists from David
Bruce and David Williams for the Sharks.;   After scoring once in the first
period and once in the second, LaFontaine completed his hat trick by scoring
on a breakaway after only 39 seconds had expired in the third period. The
goal, LaFontaine's fifth of the season, gave the Sabres a 5-0 lead.;   "I knew
it was just a matter of time before good things started happening," LaFontaine
said. "It's exciting to make that kind of contribution.";   Goalie Arturs Irbe
made his third consecutive start for the Sharks but was removed after giving
up three goals in the first period. Irbe, who won his first two NHL starts
last week, was replaced by Jeff Hackett at the start of the second period.;  
"We were trying to get the team to wake up and get into the game," Kingston
said when asked why he made the goalie switch. "When you make a change like
that, you're just trying to send a signal to the team that you're trying to
give them a new start.";   The Sabres (6-9-1) got off to a good start by
scoring on three of their first eight shots.;   "It was important for us to

Tim Sweeney, playing in his first regular-season National Hockey League game, 
scored at 1:07 of overtime Thursday night to give the Calgary Flames a 3-2 
victory over the Vancouver Canucks in their season opener at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames' Al MacInnis broke a 1-1 deadlock at 8:15 of the third period, only 
to have the Canucks' Rob Murphy tie it again, forcing overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Sergei Makarov scored the other goal for the Flames, and Jim Sandlak had one 
for the Canucks -- both in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary's Mike Vernon, who faced 26 shots, had an acrobatic night, making 
several saves in the second period to prevent Vancouver from taking the lead. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Philadelphia 1 -- Andy Moog's goaltending and first-period goals by 
Dave Poulin and Cam Neely carried the Bruins past the Flyers at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins are 5-0-1 in their last six openers. 
</P>
<P>
Moog lost his bid for his 10th shutout with 4:09 left when Rick Tocchet knocked 
in a rebound from the slot. 
</P>
<P>
Craig Janney made it 3-0 with 7:44 left and Boston's Ray Bourque closed out the 
scoring into an empty-net with 57 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, N.Y. Rangers 3 -- Dirk Graham scored two goals, and Ed Belfour 
stopped 27 shots as the Blackhawks defeated the Rangers at Chicago to win their 
first opener since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Chelios, acquired from Montreal during the off-season, scored a 
third-period goal on a 45-foot slapshot at the 41-second mark and assisted on 
both of Graham's goals. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Rangers' first loss to the Blackhawks in Chicago since Feb. 19, 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago had a 4-1 lead, but the Rangers made the game exciting when Bernie 
Nicholls scored his second goal of the night at 19:14 of the final period and 
Ray Sheppard scored with six seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 3, Hartford 3 -- Guy Lafleur, Joe Sakic and Mats Sundin scored in a 
5-minute 36-second span of the second period, but the Nordiques had to settle 
for a tie at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
After the Whalers took a 2-0 lead in the first period on goals by Kevin Dineen 
and Pat Verbeek, the Nordiques tied it in the first 2:11 of the second period 
on power-play goals by the 39-year-old Lafleur and Sakic. 
</P>
<P>
Sundin, No. 1 pick in the 1989 draft, scored his first NHL goal to break the 
tie at 5:36 of the second period, but Todd Krygier got the Whalers even later 
in the period. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers had a man advantage for the final 1:37 of overtime, but Ron Francis 
hit the right post at 2:02, and Quebec goalie John Tanner stopped a shot by 
Kevin Dineen with 21 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 3, New Jersey 3 -- Brendan Shanahan scored with 15 seconds left in 
regulation to give the Devils a tie with the Red Wings at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey trailed, 3-1, but rallied in Bryan Murray's debut as Red Wing coach 
and general manager. Claude Lemieux started the Devils' comeback by scoring his 
second goal with 8:20 left. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Fedyk and Sergei Fedorov put the Red Wings ahead, 3-1, with goals in the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
Marc Habscheid gave Detroit a 1-0 lead 3:55 into the game with a short-handed 
goal, but Lemieux tied it about six minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 3, Buffalo 3 -- Stephane Richer scored with 3:43 left to give the 
Canadiens a tie with the Sabres at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo took a 3-2 lead when Dale Hawerchuk fired a short shot past goalie 
Patrick Roy at 6:32 of the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Mogilny and Dave Andreychuk scored for the Sabres, while Russ 
Courtnall and Brian Skrudland scored for Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg 7, Toronto 1 -- Dave Ellett had two goals and an assist as the Jets 
routed the Maple Leafs at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
Jet rookie goalie Stephane Beauregard had 25 saves. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Reid opened the scoring for Toronto, tipping a shot past Beauregard 1:48 
into the first period, but Paul MacDermid evened the score 31 seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
Dave McLlwain and Moe Mantha scored before the first period ended, Ellett 
scored twice in the second period and the rout was on. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 3, Minnesota 2 -- Brett Hull, who led the NHL with 72 goals last 
season, scored twice, and the Blues downed the North Stars at Minnesota to 
spoil the debut of Coach Bob Gainey. 
</P>
<P>
The score was tied, 1-1, but Hull scored with 3:37 left in the second period 
and made it 3-1 with an unassisted goal in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Gagner's power-play goal gave Minnesota a 1-0 lead in the first period.

MAKAROV GETS A GOAL, 2 ASSISTS IN CALGARY WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Soviet star Sergei Makarov got a goal in his National Hockey League debut, and 
Jiri Hrdina and Joe Nieuwendyk each scored twice as the Calgary Flames opened 
the season with a 10-7 victory over the Detroit Red Wings Thursday night at 
Calgary, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Makarov, part of the first influx of Soviet players into the NHL, also had two 
assists for the Flames, who won the Stanley Cup last spring. 
</P>
<P>
Nieuwendyk, Gary Roberts and rookie Paul Ranheim scored in a 3:12 span midway 
through the first period as the Flames jumped out to a 3-0 lead before rookie 
Dean Morton scored for Detroit. Makarov got his first NHL point when he set up 
Roberts' goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings closed within 7-6 and 8-7 of the Flames in the third period, but 
goals by Al MacInnis and Joel Otto kept Calgary ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, Quebec 3 -- Left wing Mike Hartman scored twice at Buffalo, and the 
Sabres spoiled Guy Lafleur's debut as a Nordique. 
</P>
<P>
The game also marked the NHL debut of Soviet defector Alexander Mogilny, who 
scored the Sabres' first goal off a pass from rookie Dave Snuggerud 20 seconds 
into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Lafleur scored seven minutes later, after a poor clearing pass by Sabre goalie 
Daren Puppa. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 5, Pittsburgh 4 -- Cam Neely scored two goals as the Bruins held off the 
Penguins at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins outshot the Penguins, 43-25, and capitalized on five of nine 
manpower advantages. Peter Douris, Ray Bourque and Bob Sweeney all scored 
power-play goals for the Bruins, who are 10-4-1 in their last 15 season 
openers, all at Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Lemieux, the NHL scoring scoring champion the last two years, managed two 
assists on his 24th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 4, Hartford 1 -- Goaltender Patrick Roy stopped 30 of 31 shots as the 
Canadiens won their opener at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Skrudland, Guy Carbonneau, Stephane Richer and Bobby Smith scored for 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 6, Philadelphia 2 -- Sylvain Turgeon scored three goals at 
Philadelphia in his first game with the Devils, and goaltender Chris Terreri 
got his first victory. 
</P>
<P>
Terreri, playing because starter Sean Burke is still slowed by knee surgery, 
made 38 saves for his first win in nine NHL decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Turgeon, acquired from Hartford during the off-season, was credited with New 
Jersey's first goal when Viacheslav Fetisov's slap shot bounced off his 
midsection and past goalie Ken Wregget on a power play at 1:09 of the first 
period. 
</P>
<P>
The assist was the only point for either of the Devils' two Soviet players. 
Both Fetisov and Sergei Starikov took minor penalties in their first NHL game. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 6, New York Islanders 5 -- Brian Bellows scored twice and assisted on 
two goals at Bloomington, Minn., as the North Stars recovered from a 1-8-1 
exhibition sason to win their first opener in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
David Chyzowski, who signed a four-year, $800,000 contract with the Islanders 
earlier in theday, assisted on a Doug Crossman goal. 
</P>
<P>
Chyzowski, an 18-year-old left wing and the second overall pick in the 1989 
draft, is the league's youngest player. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 8, Chicago 3 -- Brett Hull scored twice, and goalie Greg Millen 
continued to dominate the Blackhawks at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Millen, 6-1-1 against Chicago last season, stopped 21 shots in the first two 
periods. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 4, Vancouver 1 -- Jimmy Carson, Kelly Buchberger, Glenn Anderson and 
Mark Messier scored for the Oilers to put a damper on the debut of three Soviet 
stars for the Canucks at Vancouver, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, despite the first-time appearances of Igor Larionov and Vladimir 
Krutov, blanked the Canucks on eight power-play attempts.

SABRES SECURE HOLD ON THIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jeff Parker scored twice Tuesday night at Buffalo to lead the Sabres to a 4-2 
victory over Hartford and strengthen the Sabres' hold on third place in the 
Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
Both the Whalers and Sabres have three games remaining, but the Sabres have a 
four-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
The significance of finishing third is that the team doesn't have to meet the 
powerful Montreal Canadiens in the opening round of the Stanley Cup 
competition. Instead the team will play Boston. 
</P>
<P>
The way the Sabres played in the first period, they didn't appear to be ready 
to increase their lead. They had only one shot on goal in the first period and 
trailed, 1-0, near the middle of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
But goals by Ray Sheppard and Parker put the Sabres ahead and from then on they 
dominated play. 
</P>
<P>
Parker's second goal early in the third period made it a two-goal lead and the 
Sabres were in charge. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo plays at Montreal and at Quebec before returning home to play the New 
York Islanders Sunday. The Whalers play Pittsburgh and Boston at home and 
Chicago on the road. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 5, Washington 4 -- One advantage of being knocked out of the 
playoffs is the chance to give experience to rookies. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders have found several good ones. The newest, Mike Walsh, scored two 
goals, including the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals, in their first game since clinching the Patrick Division, didn't 
seem to have their hearts in the game against the team with the worst record.

DEFECTING SOVIET HOCKEY PLAYER IN U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
MEMBER OF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM SEEKS CAREER IN NHL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alexander Mogilny, on the verge of stardom with the Soviet world championship 
team, flew to the United States today for what he hoped would be a career in 
the National Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after his arrival from Stockholm, the Soviet athlete was interviewed at 
John F. Kennedy Airport by the FBI, according to an airport spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
"They do that with all defectors," said Tom Middlemiss of the Port Authority. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sabres Own Rights 
</P>
<P>
Middlemiss said Mogilny was accompanied on the flight by officials of the 
Buffalo Sabres, adding that he did not know which ones. The Sabres own NHL 
rights to the player. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Embassy spokesman said Mogilny, who helped the Soviet Union to its 21st 
world hockey title last week, was granted a U.S. visa Thursday. He reportedly 
planned to fly to Buffalo, N.Y., after clearing customs. 
</P>
<P>
The NHL was getting ready for Mogilny, but a spokesman said he had no 
information "at this present moment" whether the Sabres had offered the Soviet 
player a contract. 
</P>
<P>
"We are collecting all the facts regarding Mogilny leaving his team and also 
awaiting advice from United States State Department and the Canadian Department 
of External Affairs as to what effect, if any, his military position places on 
the situation, vis-a-vis his ability to settle in either country and travel 
back and forth," said Gary Meagher, the NHL's director of media relations, in 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Mogilny is a junior lieutenant in the Soviet Army. That adds a further 
diplomatic complication: Soviet authorities could view the incident as 
desertion. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INS Comment Declined 
</P>
<P>
The regional director of the Immigration of Naturalization Service in Buffalo, 
Benedict Ferro, said his office is aware of the situation, but he declined 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably it would be through the immigration service in Buffalo that efforts 
would be made to grant Mogilny permission to live in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The defection, the first by a Soviet national hockey player, cast a shadow on 
U.S.-Soviet hockey relations and gave an ironic twist to the latest Soviet 
championship.

<LEADPARA>  You know you're in trouble if you're counting on defenseman Bob McGill to be
your primary offensive weapon.;   McGill averages one goal every 42 games. So
with him accounting for all the offense for the Sharks on Friday night, it was
no surprise that they were beaten 3-1 by the Buffalo Sabres before 16,325
spectators at the Aud.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  SHARKS LOSE 8TH STRAIGHT
OFFENSE STRUGGLES IN LOSS TO SABRES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The Sabres got goals from Donald Audette, Brad May and Dave Andreychuk in
becoming the eighth consecutive team to beat the Sharks, who have scored only
four goals in their past four games.;   "One goal isn't going to win many
hockey games," Sharks captain Doug Wilson said. "We're trying to make too many
perfect plays instead of just shooting the puck.";   McGill's goal, which came
with 1 minute, 45 seconds elapsed in the third period, was only the 14th of
his NHL career, which has consisted of 590 games since he joined the league in
1981. And it ended a scoreless drought of 127 minutes, 18 seconds for the
Sharks, who hadn't scored since the second period of a 4-1 loss to the Boston
Bruins last Saturday.;   "I don't think we were thinking about that," said
McGill, who scored from the slot on the rebound of Brian Lawton shot that was
stopped by Sabres goalie Clint Malarchuk. "We just figured that if we could
get a goal, Buffalo might tighten up a little bit. And then if we'd had any
luck, we might have gotten one or two more and maybe won the game.";   It
almost turned out that way. The Sharks (1-10) trailed only 2-1 after McGill
scored, and Dean Evason nearly got them even less than a minute later, when he
was robbed from close range by Malarchuk.;   The save was one of 31 made by
Malarchuk, who was the third consecutive goalie to hold the Sharks to one goal
or less.;   "Apparently, we're making the goaltenders look hot," Sharks Coach
George Kingston said. "If we're going to play with the big boys, we have to
start digging in and attacking the net.";   Although the Sabres (3-5-1) were
playing with a depleted lineup because of a seven-player trade that was
completed with the New York Islanders earlier in the day -- high-scoring
center Pierre Turgeon was part of the deal, and Pat LaFontaine, the key player
the Sabres received in return, was unable to get to Buffalo in time for the
game -- they held a 2-0 lead at the first intermission on the strength of
goals by Audette and May.;   Audette scored just as a penalty to Sharks winger
Paul Fenton expired at 4:10 of the first period, and the Sharks were never
able to catch up.;   "We're doing enough things to win hockey games, but it's
really tough to play from behind on the road," Kingston said. "We're getting
closer and closer, but we're just not quite there yet.";   McGill's goal gave
the Sharks a spark, but Andreychuk answered by beating Sharks goalie Jarmo
Myllys from the center of the left-wing faceoff circle at 4:43 of the third
period.;   Myllys played well enough to deserve a better result, making 35
saves to prevent the Sabres from running up the score.;   "He kept us in the
game," Wilson said. "We just have to start scoring some goals. And the law of
averages says we're due.";   With the exception of McGill, that is.; San Jose

<P>
Mike McPhee, one of the key players for the Montreal Canadiens for several 
seasons, has battled injuries this season. 
</P>
<P>
He returned just in time to lead the Canadiens to a 5-3 victory over the Boston 
Bruins Saturday night at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
McPhee, playing in only his fifth game of the season, scored his first two 
goals to help end the Bruins' unbeaten string at nine games. It also kept the 
Canadiens in a tie with Buffalo for first place in the tight Adams Division 
race. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have not won at the Forum since Dec. 13, 1986. During that period 
the Canadiens are 11-0-1 against them. 
</P>
<P>
Goals by McPhee, who has been nursing a strained abdominal muscle, and Stephane 
Richer in the first three minutes gave the Canadiens a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
But Cam Neely scored his 16th and 17th goals to get the Bruins even. 
</P>
<P>
McPhee put the Canadiens ahead to stay at 4:01 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 4, Pittsburgh 1 -- Back-to-back victories against a good team are 
difficult. Even though they came home after beating Washington at Landover, 
Md., Friday night, the Penguins had little chance. 
</P>
<P>
Washington goaltender Don Beaupre, sent to an early shower after giving up six 
goals in barely half the game Friday night, came back to play brilliantly in 
Pittsburgh. He stopped 15 shots, losing a shutout with less than 12 minutes 
remaining when Mario Lemieux scored a short-handed goal. 
</P>
<P>
Beaupre was hurt on the play in which Lemieux scored and had to leave a few 
minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
Geoff Courtnall set up three goals as the Capitals dominated from start to 
finish. 
</P>
<P>
With 17 seconds remaining, the teams engaged in a free-for-all involving all 
the players on the ice except the goaltenders. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 3, Calgary 3 -- The Flames led, 3-1, with five minutes to play at St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
But Adams Oates scored on a deflection at 15:02, and Rony Hrkac tied it with 
1:45 left in regulation. The tie gave Calgary's Stanley Cup champions an 0-5-4 
record in the last nine games. 
</P>
<P>
Edmonton 7, New York Islanders 2 -- Normand Lacombe, benched for 12 games after 
going scoreless in eight in a row, was ready when he was reinstated for the 
game at Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Lacombe scored his first three goals and had an assist to lead the Oilers to an 
easy victory over the Islanders, who fell to 5-17-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers are 4-1-0 in their last five. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 3, Quebec 2 -- Pierre Turgeon scored with just 16 seconds remaining in 
regulation at Quebec to keep the Sabres in a tie for first place in the Adams 
Division with Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Turgeon took a pass from Dave Andreychuk and beat goalie Ron Tugnutt for his 
11th goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres built a 2-0 lead but couldn't hold it. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 5, Philadelphia 2 -- Ron Francis and Scott Young scored power-play 
goals less than five minutes apart in the second period at Hartford, Conn., to 
break open a close game. 
</P>
<P>
Goaltender Mike Liut stopped 18 shots, lowered his goals-against average to 
2.31 and ended the Whalers' three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 7, New York Rangers 4 -- Gary Leeman scored twice at Toronto to help 
the Maple Leafs end a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers lead the Patrick Division by five points. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring four times in the first two periods against Bob Froese, the Maple 
Leafs scored three times off John Vanbiesbrouck in the final 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 3, Winnipeg 1 -- John MacLean and Sylvain Turgeon scored 
first-period goals and the Devils held on to win at Winnipeg and move into a 
tie for second place in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
A late onslaught enabled the Jets to outshoot the Devils, but goalie Chris 
Terreri was superb, stopping 38 shots, 18 of them in the last period. DAN

CRAVEN LEADS SPIRITED FLYERS PAST CANADIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
One of the big stories in the NHL this season is the play of the Philadelphia 
Flyers, despite injuries to key players and the suspension of standout 
goaltender Ron Hextall. 
</P>
<P>
Hextall, suspended for the first 12 games, has missed all but two others 
because of injuries. Tim Kerr, their top scorer, and Brian Propp, their top 
playmaker, have recently undergone surgery. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers haven't lost their spirit, however. Murray Craven had two goals and 
two assists Wednesday night at Philadelphia as the Flyers defeated the Montreal 
Canadiens, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers welcomed back right wing Scott Mellanby, who played his first game 
after undergoing surgery on his left forearm, which he severely damaged in a 
barroom fight during the off-season. Mellanby had an assist. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers started fast. They outshot the Canadiens, 9-2, in the first period, 
and built a 2-0 lead on goals by Rick Tocchet and Craven. 
</P>
<P>
Backup goaltender Ken Wregget made the lead stand up, although he faced seven 
shots in the first six minutes of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
"Craven has been our most consistent forward all season," Flyer Coach Paul 
Holmgren said. "He sucked it up a lot when we lost Tocchet and (Ron) Sutter. 
Now that they are back, the line is flying." 
</P>
<P>
Montreal Coach Pat Burns was so disturbed by the Canadiens' poor performance, 
he never emerged from the dressing room to answer reporters' questions. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, New York 1 -- The Sabres scored three times before the game was 13 
minutes old to remain the only team in the NHL unbeaten at home. 
</P>
<P>
Christian Ruuttu, Pierre Turgeon and Scott Arniel had early goals and Daren 
Puppa made 27 saves to run the Sabres' record to 9-0-1 on their home ice. 
</P>
<P>
Puppa improved his record to 9-2-4. He lost his shutout early in the third 
period when rookie Darren Turcotte scored his 13th goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres (13-5-4) moved into a tie for first place in the Adams Division with 
Montreal, which has played four more games. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 5, New York Islanders 3 -- In the first quarter of the season, the 
Capitals played pretty well but had trouble scoring. 
</P>
<P>
With Mike Ridley and Dino Ciccarelli leading the way at Landover, Md., the 
Capitals ended a four-game winless streak and displayed an offense. 
</P>
<P>
Ridley had two goals, and Ciccarelli, not known as a playmaker, assisted on 
three goals. The Capitals outshot the Islanders, 16-4, in the first period and 
built a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 6, Pittsburgh 3 -- Bruce Driver set up four goals to lead the Devils 
to victory at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils, in ending a four-game winless streak, stopped the Penguins' 
three-game win streak. In the last three games, Driver has a goal and eight 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Lemieux assisted on all three Pittsburgh goals to extend his scoring 
streak to 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 4, Hartford 2 -- The Whalers know they have a problem on home ice when 
they can't beat the struggling Nordiques. 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Jeff Brown broke a 2-2 tie with a 55-foot shot on a power play with 
4:42 left to give the Nordiques just their sixth win in 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers have lost four in a row at Hartford and are 4-8-1 at home this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 6, Toronto 3 -- After going scoreless for the first 21 minutes at 
Bloomington, Minn., the North Stars got offensive. 
</P>
<P>
They scored all six of their goals in the next 26 minutes. Mike Gartner scored 
two and has 14 this season. 
</P>
<P>
The North Stars took 54 shots at Toronto goalie Mark LaForest, who stopped the 
first 27. DAN HAFNER

CARPENTER, BURRIDGE LEAD BRUINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bobby Carpenter and Randy Burridge have been linemates for only three games, 
but it looks like a good match. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter scored two goals and an assist, and Burridge had a goal and two 
assists Friday night in Landover, Md., as the Boston Bruins extended their 
unbeaten streak to four games with a 5-3 victory over the Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
"Three games, and we've played three great games," Carpenter said of the line 
that also includes Bob Sweeney. ". . . We play well together. We complement 
each other. I think there's a real good work ethic there." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, 3-0-1 in their last four games, scored on three of their first 
seven shots as they built a 3-0 lead in the opening 13:17 of the game. By the 
time they reached the third period, they were just trying to hang on. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the Bruins were outshot, 13-4, in the final period, they ended 
Washington's four-game unbeaten streak as the Capitals fell to 3-3-2 at home. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Ridley's third-period goal pulled Washington within 4-3, but Boston 
defenseman Garry Galley put the game away with a goal with 3:31 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Carpenter has four goals in his last four games. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, Vancouver 2 -- The Sabres, last in the NHL on the power play, scored 
three goals with the man advantage at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo scored on three of four power-play opportunities to remain unbeaten at 
home this season (7-0-1). The Sabres are unbeaten in their last seven games, 
with six wins and a tie. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Andreychuk, Alexander Mogilny, Pierre Turgeon and Scott Arniel scored for 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
With the teams tied, 1-1, Mogilny turned in an outstanding individual effort to 
give Buffalo the lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet rookie took a pass from Doug Bodger near the Vancouver blue line, 
skated around two defenders and lifted a backhand past McLean for his third 
goal of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Dave Tippett made his first goal of the season a 
game-winner for the Whalers at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
Tippett picked up a rebound off the end boards and beat Jet goaltender Daniel 
Berthiaume with just 2:39 left in the third period to snap a 2-2 tie. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tomlak added an empty-net goal with 43 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Young and Kevin Dineen also scored for the Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
Dale Hawerchuk broke out of a six-game pointless streak with two goals for 
Winnipeg. The third period was filled with fights, with Dan Marovelli handing 
out 33 minutes in penalties, including a high-sticking major and game 
misconduct to Pat Verbeek.

FLAME ROOKIE FLEURY CONTINUES HOT START WITH 2 GOALS IN WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rookie Theoren Fleury, whose reckless style of play has won the hearts of 
Calgary fans, appears to be making the Flames a better team. 
</P>
<P>
Fleury, 20, who was called up from the minors earlier this week and was playing 
in only his second National Hockey League game, scored 2 goals Saturday night 
as the Flames beat the Edmonton Oilers, 7-2, at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, it was a really big thrill for me," he said of his first NHL goal. "It's 
right up there with my experience in Moscow in the world junior championships 
(last season). Maybe I'm finally getting my chance." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Gilmour also scored 2 goals for the Flames, who moved 10 points ahead of 
the second-place Kings and 12 ahead of the Oilers in the Smythe Division race. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary Coach Terry Crisp said Saturday's performance by Fleury was a perfect 
example of why he has become a crowd favorite. 
</P>
<P>
"The little water bug, he was just scooting out there, and the fans love that 
excitement," Crisp said. "He's colorful, talented and isn't afraid to hit. It's 
nice for everyone on our club when someone comes up to the NHL and does what 
he's doing." 
</P>
<P>
Fleury had 3 assists in his NHL debut on Thursday in an 8-6 home victory over 
the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the Flames opened a 7-0 lead before Craig Redmond ended goaltender 
Rick Wamsley's shutout bid at 15:39 of the third period. Former King Jimmy 
Carson scored the Oilers' other goal at 18:34. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 3, Boston 1 -- Brian Skrudland scored a goal and set up another to 
help the Canadiens stretch their winning streak to 9 games with a victory over 
the Bruins at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Chelios and Peter Svoboda also scored for the Canadiens, who are 5-0-1 
against the Bruins this season. Montreal, which is 21 points ahead of 
second-place Boston in the Adams Division, has outscored the Bruins, 18-7. 
</P>
<P>
Boston peppered goaltender Patrick Roy with 21 of its 27 shots during the final 
40 minutes but was unable to catch the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
More than half the game was played with only linesmen Ron Finn and Mike Cvik 
officiating. Referee Terry Gregson fractured his left collarbone and suffered a 
slight concussion after colliding with Montreal's Stephane Richer midway 
through the second period. He had to be taken off the ice on a stretcher. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 6, Chicago 3 -- Mike Ridley had a team-record 6 assists, including 
one on Kevin Hatcher's tiebreaking goal 4:01 into the third period, as the 
Capitals beat the Blackhawks at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the Capitals a share of first place in the Patrick Division 
with the New York Rangers, 1 point ahead of the Pittsburgh Penguins. The 
Capitals are 8-0-2 in their last 10 home games, and Chicago has lost 11 
straight on the road. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 5, Detroit 2 -- Sean Burke returned to the lineup and stopped 26 
shots and Aaron Broten set up a goal that sparked a 3-goal second period as the 
Devils beat the Red Wings at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Burke, who had missed the past 4 games with a groin injury, was spectacular in 
the net, allowing only third-period goals by Steve Yzerman and Joey Kocur. By 
that time, New Jersey had opened a 5-0 lead en route to its second home victory 
in as many nights. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 7, Pittsburgh 5 -- Tony Tanti scored 3 goals in a 6:46 span of the 
second period, and the Canucks tied a team record with 25 first-period shots as 
they beat the Penguins at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks, playing their third road game in four nights, ended a 0-2-1 slide 
and knocked the Penguins into second place in the Patrick Division, a point 
behind the New York Rangers and Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 5, New York Islanders 1 -- Recently acquired Carey Wilson 
continued his strong play with a second-period goal as the Rangers extended 
their unbeaten streak to 7 games with the victory at Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who has 11 points in 6 games since the Rangers acquired him in a Dec. 
26 trade with the Hartford Whalers, scored his fourth goal as a Ranger and 15th 
of the season. With Wilson in the lineup, the Rangers are 5-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 6, Toronto 1 -- Rick Vaive scored 2 goals as the Sabres ended a 4-game 
losing streak by beating the Maple Leafs at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Vaive, who started his NHL career with the Maple Leafs, has 5 goals in 6 games 
as a Sabre since being acquired from Chicago for Adam Creighton on Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 7, Philadelphia 4 -- Ex-Flyer Peter Zezel scored twice, including the 
go-ahead goal late in the second period, as the Blues beat the Flyers at St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
Zezel, obtained by St. Louis from the Flyers on Nov. 29 for Mike Bullard, 
directed a centering pass from Bernie Federko past goalie Ron Hextall for his 
11th goal of the season at 14:40 of the second period, giving St. Louis a 5-4 
lead.

 Mikhail Tatarinov and Mike Ridley scored for the Capitals in a game where the
sellout crowd of 20,132, assured of victory, emptied the stands halfway
through the third period.;    Washington goaltender Mike Liut was pulled at 8
minutes, 4 seconds of the second period in favor of Don Beaupre after allowing

recorded a goal and two assists as New York defeated visiting Hartford.;   
Mike Richter made 26 saves for the Rangers, who won for the fourth time in
five games and extended their Patrick Division lead to eight points.;   
Hartford, which had been 4-1-1 in February and 9-3-1 against Patrick teams
this season, dropped into a third-place tie with the Buffalo Sabres in the
Adams Division.;    The Rangers were in need of the pick-me-up that Miller, a
converted winger, gave the team's depleted corps of centers. Kelly Kisio
reinjured his groin in the second period. He and Darren Turcotte, who has a
contusion of the right leg, are day-to-day. Next week, Bernie Nicholls will
begin serving a three-game suspension for high-sticking.;    "I've played a
little at center, so I'm starting to feel more comfortable there," said
Miller, who recorded the second two-goal game of his career. "I don't mind the
responsibility, since a lot of people probably thought I'd be in the minors
now. The more the team needs me to do, the more I welcome the challenge."; 
SABRES 2, CANADIENS 2: Rookie Darrin Shannon's second-period goal gave Buffalo
its NHL-high 14th tie of the season as the Sabres and Montreal skated to a
draw in Buffalo, N.Y.;    For the fourth home game in a row, the Sabres went
into overtime. Their record during that time is 0-1-3.;    The Sabres haven't
won at home since a 6-4 victory over Boston on Jan. 22, a seven-game streak in
which Buffalo is 0-4-3. Buffalo is undefeated in its last five games with one
win and four ties.  </TEXT>

HULL JOINS 70-GOAL CLUB, BUT BLUES FALL TO OILERS, 8-6 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brett Hull would have enjoyed it more if his 70th goal had given the St. Louis 
Blues a victory in their bid to win the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
When he became the sixth player in NHL history to score 70 goals in a season, 
it merely kept the Blues close Wednesday night at Edmonton. The Oilers, 
battling to hold second place in the Smythe Division, prevailed, 8-6. 
</P>
<P>
Hull, son of Hall of Famer Bobby Hull, joins the select group of Wayne Gretzky, 
Mario Lemieux, Phil Esposito, Jari Kurri and Bernie Nichols who have scored 70. 
</P>
<P>
Hull scored on a quick wrist shot at 17:17 of the second period to cut the 
Oiler lead to 6-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues lead Chicago in the tight division race by one point. The Blackhawks 
have six games to play, the Blues only four. 
</P>
<P>
Hull has broken six club records this season, including most goals and most 
points. 
</P>
<P>
He needs two goals to break Kurri's record for right wings. 
</P>
<P>
Kurri didn't have a goal, but he assisted on three for the Oilers. Mark Messier 
scored his 44th goal for the Oilers, who had 34 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 5, Calgary 4 -- The Sabres took a firm grip on second place in the 
Adams Division when Clint Malarchuk stopped 40 shots in the victory at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
With Montreal losing, the Sabres pulled three points ahead and both teams have 
just five games left. Boston leads the division by three points over the 
surging Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Priestlay scored the game-winner on a disputed goal early in the final 
period. Joe Mullen had the puck in his own end of the ice and Buffalo's Darrin 
Shannon appeared to hook him. Priestlay picked up the puck and put it in the 
net. The Flames argued heatedly that Shannon should have been penalized. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg 3, Montreal 2 -- The Jets still think they have a chance to finish 
second in the Smythe Division. Pat Elynuik scored twice at Winnipeg, and the 
Jets ended the Canadiens' six-game unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets trail second-place Edmonton by four points. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 5, Toronto 5 -- Daniel Marois scored his 37th goal with eight 
seconds left in regulation at Toronto to get the Maple Leafs the tie. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the two points that would have almost clinched the Patrick Division 
title, the Rangers had to be content with one. They lead New Jersey by nine 
points. Three more points will clinch it. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto is four points out of second place in the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, Quebec 1 -- Pat Verbeek scored two goals at Hartford, Conn., and 
the Whalers romped past the Nordiques, who have won only 12 of 74 games. 
</P>
<P>
Verbeek has 42 goals this season. DAN HAFNER

SINKING SABRES DEAL FOLIGNO TO MAPLE LEAFS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The struggling Buffalo Sabres traded their captain, forward Mike Foligno, to 
the Toronto Maple Leafs today for two veteran players, Lou Franceschetti and 
Brian Curran. 
</P>
<P>
Trade rumors had surrounded Foligno, 31, for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
He played in all but one of the Sabres' 32 games so far this season, but seldom 
started and scored just four goals with five assists as the Sabres got off to a 
disappointing 10-15-7 start. 
</P>
<P>
Foligno, who was acquired from Detroit in 1981, has played in 663 games during 
his career at Buffalo, scoring 247 goals and 263 assists for 510 points. 
</P>
<P>
He holds Buffalo's all-time record for penalty minutes, with 1,450, including 
42 this season, and ranks in the team's all-time top 10 in most other major 
categories. He had been the Sabres' captain since Feb. 15, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Franceschetti, 32, a right wing, has appeared in only 16 games after sitting 
out part of the season with a broken foot. He has scored one goal and one 
assist this season. 
</P>
<P>
Curran, 27, has not played since being recalled on Dec. 13 from the Leafs' farm 
team at Newmarket, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
All players are expected to report to their new teams by Tuesday, when the 
Leafs will visit the New York Islanders and Buffalo will play at Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
Boston defenseman Ray Bourque, who had seven points in three games, was named 
NHL Player of the Week. 
</P>
<P>
Bourque had a goal and six assists in two victories over Hartford and a 1-1 tie 
with the New Jersey Devils, giving him 28 points in 29 games this season.

NHL ROUNDUP;

MALARCHUK STOPS RANGERS IN FIRST START FOR SABRES, 2-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three of the division titles in the National Hockey League have just about been 
decided. But nobody seems to want to win the Patrick Division, as four teams 
have held the lead during the season. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does the first-place team get extra money for winning, it also assures 
itself of home-ice advantage in the first two rounds of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
New York, the current leader, missed an opportunity to increase their lead to 
four points when they couldn't solve Buffalo goaltender Clint Malarchuk 
Wednesday night. Malarchuk, in his first start for the Sabres, stopped 32 shots 
during a 2-0 victory over the Rangers in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Andreychuk and Christian Ruttu scored the second-period goals. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres picked up Malarchuk in a last-minute trade with Washington. He was 
put to the test in the first period, when the puck was in the Sabres' end 
almost the entire 20 minutes. Malarchuk stopped 10 shots, while the Sabres were 
getting just two. They had only 14 all night. 
</P>
<P>
With Washington losing, the Rangers lead the Capitals by two points, Pittsburgh 
by three and Philadelphia by nine. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 7, Edmonton 3 -- There was a power outage after about 15 minutes of 
the game at Hartford, Conn., and when the electricity came back on, it was soon 
lights out for the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
It became too dark to see properly with 4:41 left in the first period, and the 
time was added to the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Before the first period was completed, the Whalers scored twice. Then, Kevin 
Dineen got two goals in the second period to help build a 4-0 lead. The loss 
ended a seven-game Oiler unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 3, Washington 2 -- Mats Naslund's fluke goal halfway through the third 
period gave the Canadiens the victory in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
Naslund banged a rebound off the skate of Washington defenseman Rod Langway 
into the net for his 28th goal. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 7, Chicago 5 -- Aaron Broten had five points, including the 
game-winning goal, at Chicago to keep the Devils' slim playoff hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils, who are 9-3-2 against Norris Division teams, are seven points 
behind Philadelphia in the fight for fourth place in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 3, Winnipeg 0 -- Goaltender Kirk McLean stopped 26 shots for his 
third shutout as the Canucks blanked the Jets at Vancouver, Canada. The win 
also gave the Canucks a stranglehold on the final playoff spot in the Smythe 
Division. They lead the Jets by 12 points, and Winnipeg has only 13 games left.

BRUINS ELIMINATE SABRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the Buffalo Sabres trounced the Boston Bruins, 6-0, at Boston in the first 
game of their playoff series, it looked as if a sweep was in the making. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who were 0-5-3 against the Sabres during the regular season, looked 
pitiful in the playoff opener. 
</P>
<P>
But Boston regrouped behind Cam Neely as the resurgent Bruins won four in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night at Boston, Randy Burridge scored a short-handed goal in the 
second period, but it was Neely who applied the clincher in a 4-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Neely's fifth goal, with 6:56 remaining in the second period, gave the Bruins a 
3-0 lead. With Andy Moog playing his third consecutive solid game in the nets, 
it was all over. Twice earlier in the series, Neely scored the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
"My question to the players (after the opener) was, if it's important to you, 
you have to play like you want it," Coach Terry O'Reilly said. "They did." 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, who finished second in the Adams Division, will meet the Montreal 
Canadiens, the division winner, in the next best-of-seven series. It will not 
begin until Monday. Last year the Bruins knocked out the Canadiens in the 
second round and made it to the Stanley Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
The Sabres began to lose some of their offensive thrust when Christian Ruttu 
suffered a shoulder injury in the second period of Game 2 and never returned. 
</P>
<P>
"We shut down their offense pretty well in the last three games," Reilly said. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 8, Washington 5 -- In helping his Flyers take a 3-2 lead in the 
series, Ron Hextall made history when he became the first goaltender to score a 
goal in Stanley Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
Two late goals by Pelle Eklund had given the Flyers a 7-5 lead at Landover, Md. 
But the desperate Capitals were working on a power play and pulled goalie Pete 
Peeters. 
</P>
<P>
Hextall stopped the puck behind the net, skated to the goal line and fired the 
puck at the empty net. Nobody touched it and into the net it went. 
</P>
<P>
Hextall, who has made a career of handling the puck well up the ice, was the 
first goalie in NHL regular season to score a goal, too. He did it, in similar 
fashion against Boston, Dec. 8, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth game will be played at Philadelphia Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 6, Minnesota 1 -- The Blues also moved into the second round of 
Stanley Cup competition by whipping the North Stars, four games to one. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Zezel made this one at St. Louis the easiest win of all. He scored three 
goals and had two assists. Two of the goals and an assist came in a four-goal 
outburst in the second period. He completed the hat trick in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues won the first two games at home in overtime, then scored a 5-3 
victory at Minnesota before losing Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 4, Vancouver 0 -- Goaltender Mike Vernon decided to take matters into 
his own hands as this series returned to Calgary. On home ice, he was flawless, 
stopping 18 shots. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in this series, the Flames resembled the team that posted 
the best record in the league during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
They outplayed the Canucks from the start to take a 3-2 series lead. They can 
clinch it with a win at Vancouver Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Nieuwendyk, with his third playoff goal, gave Vernon all the help he really 
needed before the game was six minutes old. But the Flames never took the 
pressure off. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Mullen, Mark Hunter and Hakan Loob, who assisted on the first goal, added 
goals and kept making it a little easier for Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 6, Chicago 4 -- Petr Klima and John Chabot scored 59 seconds apart in 
the third period at Detroit to keep the Red Wings' playoff hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks, who led, 4-3, before Klima scored at 7:23, lead the series, 
3-2, and can wrap it up Thursday night at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings are trying to become only the sixth team in Stanley Cup history 
to win a series after trailing, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
The Wings beat goaltender Alain Chevrier, who had a 3-0 record against them 
after the Blackhawks acquired him from Winnipeg late in the season. DAN HAFNER

Wednesday night gave the visiting St. Louis Blues a 5-4 victory over the

<TEXT>     The Blues rallied from 2-0 and 3-2 deficits. Defenseman Jeff Brown forced
the overtime when Puppa misplayed his high shot from outside the blue line at
8 minutes, 4 seconds of the third period.;    The Sabres suffered their sixth
consecutive loss.;  BLACKHAWKS 8, CANADIENS 3: Steve Thomas and Michel Goulet
each scored twice as Chicago regained sole possession of first place in the
overall NHL standings by routing host Montreal.;    Thomas scored on Chicago's
first shot on goalie Andre Racicot and got his other goal against Frederic
Chabot in the second period.;    Chicago moved two points ahead of the Boston
Bruins for the overall league lead. The Blackhawks have a game in hand over
the Bruins and play their next game Saturday in Boston.;    The game was to
have featured the homecoming of Chicago defenseman Chris Chelios, traded by
Montreal to the Blackhawks last June for Denis Savard. Instead, it featured a
contrast in rookie goaltenders. Racicot allowed five goals on 11 shots before
he was replaced at 6:31 of the second period. At the other end, Chicago's Ed
Belfour was exceptional in stopping 31 shots.;  RANGERS 5, ISLANDERS 2: Mike
Gartner, John Ogrodnick and Ray Sheppard scored during a five-minute power
play late in the first period as the New York Rangers downed the visiting New
York Islanders.;    The momentum swung to the Rangers when the Islanders' Brad
Lauer took a five-minute penalty and a game misconduct for high-sticking Tie
Domi at 15:09.;    Domi learned shortly after the game that his father had
died in Toronto.;  WHALERS 5, OILERS 1: Ron Francis' power-play goal triggered
a four-goal third period as host Hartford beat Edmonton.;    Francis' goal,
his 800th career point, broke a 1-1 tie 6:53 into the third period.;    The
Whalers had scored only seven goals in the previous 14 periods. Their
third-period outburst came at the expense of Oilers goaltender Pokey Reddick,
who had been called up from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, of the American Hockey
League earlier in the day.;  JETS 5, MAPLE LEAFS 5: Scott Arniel's fluke goal
with less than four minutes remaining in the third period gave Winnipeg a tie
with visiting Toronto.;    Arniel's pass from behind the Leafs' net hit
Toronto defenseman Todd Gill and deflected into the net at 16:08.  </TEXT>

RANGERS INCH CLOSER TO PATRICK DIVISION CROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five or six teams in the NHL will probably have a better record this season, 
but frankly, the New York Rangers don't care. 
</P>
<P>
They are on the verge of winning their first division title since before most 
of their fans were born. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Janssens set up two of the three first-period goals that sent the Rangers 
on their way to a 5-2 victory over the Vancouver Canucks Sunday night at New 
York. The Rangers, with just six games to play, lead the Patrick Division by 
eight points. 
</P>
<P>
It has been 57 years since the Rangers won a division. In the 1932-33 season, 
when there were eight teams in the NHL, the Rangers won the American Division. 
They also won the Stanley Cup that season. 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers are 8-3-1 in their last 12 games. In a division in which no other 
team is above .500, that is really a hot streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks, eliminated from the playoffs, have won only two of the last 21 
games they have played in Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the way we came back after the poor performance yesterday," Coach 
Roger Neilson said. "But we're not ready to claim anything. Don't forget, the 
Devils (second-place New Jersey) have two more games to play than we do. 
</P>
<P>
"I do feel that if we play in the rest of the games the way we did tonight, we 
can win the division." 
</P>
<P>
The Rangers outshot the Canucks, 41-24, and dominated the game except for a 
brief time in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, Winnipeg 3 -- Defenseman Phil Housley's second goal of the game and 
his 20th of the season came at 2:03 of overtime at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
The hard-earned victory enabled the Sabres to become the second team in the 
league to win 40 games this season. Unfortunately, the first, Boston, is in the 
same division and is five points ahead of the Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 2, New York Islanders 2 -- Both of these teams needed the victory in 
bids to reach the playoffs, but a point in this game at Uniondale, N.Y., wasn't 
too bad for the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
Since Mario Lemieux was lost for the season, the Penguins have not won on the 
road. They are 0-8-2 without him. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins pulled even on defenseman Paul Coffey's goal before the fourth 
minute of the second period and kept the pressure on the rest of the game, but 
couldn't break the tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins are third in the Patrick Division with 70 points. Washington has 
69, the Islanders 68 and Philadelphia 65. Two teams in the division will not 
make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 8, Quebec 3 -- Russ Courtnall scored twice in a six-goal first period 
at Montreal that enabled the Canadiens to stretch their best streak of the 
season to six unbeaten games. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens still have hopes of finishing second in the Adams Division, which 
would give them home ice in the first round of the playoffs. They trail 
second-place Buffalo by only a point. 
</P>
<P>
The hapless Nordiques are 12-54-7. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 3, Edmonton 1 -- Dean Evason came out of the penalty box just in time 
to skate to the net and bang in the tie-breaking goal in the third period at 
Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
Goaltender Bill Ranford stopped Dave Tippett's shot, but the rebound came right 
back to Evason and he fired the puck between the goalie's legs at 6:25. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 4, Minnesota 3 -- Dino Ciccarelli had a goal and two assists at 
Bloomington, Minn., and the Capitals held off a late rally. 
</P>
<P>
The victory enabled the Capitals to slip into fourth place in the tight battle 
for playoff spots in the Patrick Division. DAN HAFNER

CANUCKS EDGE SABRES, END FOUR-GAME LOSING STREAK

<TEXT>
<P>
Tony Tanti had a goal and two assists as the Vancouver Canucks ended a 
four-game losing streak with a 5-4 victory over the Buffalo Sabres Friday at 
Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The win moved the fourth-place Canucks four points ahead of the last-place 
Winnipeg Jets in the Smythe Division. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Reinhart, Jim Benning, Trevor Linden and David Bruce also scored for 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
For the Sabres, who have lost four in a row, Rick Vaive had a goal and two 
assists. Pierre Turgeon, Phil Housley and Jeff Parker added the other Buffalo 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing 1-0 in the first period, Vancouver scored a pair of power-play goals. 
Reinhart tipped in Petri Skriko's shot at 5:45, then had his shot tipped in by 
Tanti at 7:27. 
</P>
<P>
After Turgeon scored his 24th goal of the season on a power play at 15:49, 
Vancouver regained the lead when Benning scored on a 50-foot floater that 
eluded goaltender Darcy Wakaluk at 17:25. 
</P>
<P>
In the second period, Vaive tied the game again when he beat Steve Weeks from 
the top of the right circle at 1:09. 
</P>
<P>
But Linden scored his 25th goal of the season on a rebound at 5:58, putting 
Vancouver ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 3, New York Islanders 1 -- Goaltender Alain Chevrier stopped 27 shots 
as the Blackhawks defeated the Islanders at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Chevrier, who was traded to Chicago from Winnipeg on Jan. 19, has started all 
10 games since his arrival. The Blackhawks are 7-3 in those games. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks took a 1-0 lead on Steve Larmer's 32nd goal of the season in the 
first period, and Everett Sanipass made it 2-0 at 7:32 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
The Islanders scored their only goal on Tomas Jonsson's 25-foot slap shot at 
12:27 of the third period. They pulled Kelly Hrudey in the final minute, but 
Troy Murray scored into an empty net with 29 seconds left.

MOGILNY MAKES WAY INTO NHL AT TENDER AGE OF 20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ALAN GREENBERG, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alexander Mogilny is a pale-faced, 20-year-old manwith acne on his cheek and an 
ache in his heart. He is lonely and a long way from home. 
</P>
<P>
He misses his parents. He misses his friends. He wonders what happens to some 
of the packages he sends. He wonders if the secret police are listening when he 
calls home. He wonders what will happen to his loved ones. He wonders what will 
happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
"KGB is everywhere," he said of the Soviet secret police and intelligence 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
He is living and traveling in a strange new culture, struggling to speak a 
strange new language his awkwardness with which often shames him into silence. 
</P>
<P>
More than anything else in the world, Alexander Mogilny wishes his parents 
could see him play. For that, he knows, he may have to wait many years. 
</P>
<P>
For that, he may have to wait forever. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of printers ink has been spilled celebrating the nine Soviet hockey 
players who have joined the National Hockey League this season, many of them 
superstars from the Soviet national team here to ply their trade in the spirit 
of glasnost, and in the spirit of the Soviet government receiving hundreds of 
thousands of U.S. dollars in exchange for their services. 
</P>
<P>
They have won Olympic gold medals and world championships and much glory for 
Mother Russia. At or past their playing prime, they come to the National Hockey 
League as a reward, with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's blessing. 
</P>
<P>
Except for one. Except for Alexander Mogilny. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Mogilny is a defector. Six months ago, the Soviets billed him as 
their brightest young hockey star, the youngest-ever member of the national 
team, the youngest Soviet athlete to be awarded the prized Order of Merit. 
Today, they remember him as the first member of the Soviet national hockey team 
to defect. Like the others, he was expected to bring glory to Mother Russia. 
Instead, he has brought shame. 
</P>
<P>
Like his eight countrymen, like all the Europeans who have flooded the NHL in 
recent years, Mogilny comes here to play hockey. Like all of them, he comes 
here facing loneliness and culture shock and the chance that he might fail and 
wish to go home. 
</P>
<P>
But unlike them, he is very young. 
</P>
<P>
And unlike them, Alexander Mogilny cannot go home. 
</P>
<P>
That, he says, is the hardest thing of all. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he had seen "Moscow On The Hudson" several times -- in which Robin 
Williams' character defects in Bloomingdale's -- but no, that is not where he 
got the idea. Life does not imitate art to that extent. 
</P>
<P>
Mogilny defected the first week of May, when he left the Soviet national team 
at the world championships in Stockholm, Sweden. Mogilny declines to discuss 
specifics, but people who know Mogilny's story say his decision probably 
resulted from an an accumulation of things. 
</P>
<P>
Mogilny resented being drafted into the Soviet army just so he could play 
hockey for Central Red Army, the best team in the Soviet Union and the team 
that supplies the nucleus of the Soviet national team. Central Red Army is 
based in Moscow. Mogilny is from Khabrovsk, a city of 600,000 located just 
north of Manchuria, along the Pacific coast of Siberia. Given the incredible 
land mass of the Soviet Union -- it has 11 time zones and the continental 
United States has five -- Khabarovsk is virtually as close to Los Angeles as it 
is to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Far from home, Mogilny chafed under the Central Red Army regimen -- it plays an 
11-month season -- and its dictatorial coach, Viktor Tikhonov, who also coaches 
the national team. A private in the Army -- most veteran Soviet stars are 
officers -- Mogilny was reportedly ticked off when he was unable to get a nice 
apartment in Moscow, an important perk available to many Soviet sports stars. 
</P>
<P>
An astonishing skater with great natural skills and loose regard for the 
strictures of team play, Mogilny was generally regarded as a hot dog and a 
hothead. When he got into a fight in a game -- most un-Soviet-like -- he was 
stripped of his Order of Merit. 
</P>
<P>
Using a pick they had acquired in a trade with former General Manager Phil 
Esposito and the New York Rangers, the Buffalo Sabres had made Mogilny their 
second choice of the fifth round in the June 1988 draft -- the 89th player 
selected overall. 
</P>
<P>
Given Mogilny's stubbornness and independent streak, the Soviets knew that if 
they had a potential defector, it was he. When Central Red Army was set to tour 
the United States -- with a stop in Buffalo, N.Y., Mogilny was demoted to the 
Soviet junior team, which played in the world junior championships in 
Anchorage, Alaska. The Soviets did not want Mogilny in Buffalo or on the U.S. 
mainland. They did not want him to get any ideas. 
</P>
<P>
Mogilny was miffed. Sabres General Manager Gerry Meehan and Don Luce, the 
club's director of amateur player development, flew to Anchorage to meet 
Mogilny and to tell him they had drafted him. One year later, when the Soviets 
were in Stockholm for the world championships, Mogilny's friend, Sergei 
Fomichev, called the Sabres and said Mogilny was interested. 
</P>
<P>
Meehan and Luce flew to Stockholm. Mogilny, having ducked out on his teammates, 
flew home with them, but not before calling his parents from Sweden to tell 
them what he was about to do. His mother cried and begged him to come home. 
</P>
<P>
But Alexander Mogilny did what he felt he had to do. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI interviewed Mogilny when he landed in New York, as it does all 
defectors. Tass, the official Soviet news agency, accused the Sabres of 
"piracy." As a soldier in the Soviet army, Mogilny was granted political 
asylum. On Oct. 4, the eve of the NHL season, he received a visa, so he could 
travel freely between the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very proud of his visa," said Rip Simonick, the Sabres trainer for 20 
years. "Once he had it, he showed it to everyone. It meant something to him, 
like a birth certificate. A birth certificate to the Free World." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to play here," Mogilny said after the Sabres' Wednesday morning skate 
before their game with the Hartford Whalers. "NHL best league in the world. 
Make money. Make my life. Russian system, I didn't see a future in my life. 
U.S., this is good life. People are very friendly." 
</P>
<P>
It was a hockey move, not a political move. A move that could only have been 
made by a fiercely independent, confident guy with a self-assurance well beyond 
his years. 
</P>
<P>
How self-assured? When the Sabres took the bus to Toronto -- it is 100 miles 
from Buffalo -- for their first road game of the season, Mogilny went to the 
wrong hotel and missed the bus. Although he had never driven into Canada on his 
own, he got into his beige Jeep Laredo and began the journey. A friend of 
Sabres teammate Christian Ruuttu who was going to the game spotted Mogilny's 
vehicle on the bridge that connects Buffalo with Canada and drove him the rest 
of the way. He was not even late. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a guy that will take care of himself," says Ruuttu, a Finn, Mogilny's 
linemate and next-door neighbor. "He will rise to the occasion. Otherwise, he 
would never be here today." 
</P>
<P>
But that doesn't make the adjustment any easier. Mogilny rents a townhouse that 
he shares, temporarily, with Sergei and Sergei's Swedish-born, Soviet-educated 
wife, Lena. They are his confidantes, his "family," but they are here on 
visitors' visas. They will be going home soon, leaving Mogilny to fend for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to shopping for clothes, he fends pretty well. Thoroughly modern 
Mogilny reads Gentleman's Quarterly and loves Armani fashions. In New York, he 
bought a $400 shirt. No ill-fitting Soviet issue for him. Strictly chic Western 
European clothes. 
</P>
<P>
"I like clothes," he said, "but not American clothes." 
</P>
<P>
This is no rube who just got off the Trans-Siberian Railroad. As a budding 
Soviet star, Mogilny had been to Montreal and New York by the time he was 16; 
he has been to Los Angeles and Disney World. He was tossing down Pepsi Cola and 
pepperoni pizza and watching HBO with the zest of any 1980s capitalist kid. 
</P>
<P>
It is the size and variety of North American supermarkets that overwhelms him. 
</P>
<P>
But when Mogilny puts on the skates, he does the overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not even trying and he skates faster than these guys," Simonick said. 
</P>
<P>
First-year Sabres Coach Rick Dudley compares Mogilny's speed and grace to that 
of a young Gilbert Perrault, and says of his new wing, "he hasn't even begun to 
use the speed he's got. Nobody's seen him turn it on. When he does, it's 
awesome." 
</P>
<P>
You could also compare Mogilny's grasp of English to the young Perrault's. 
Thanks to a six-week, six-hours-a-day summer school course at the University of 
Buffalo, Mogilny's English is probably better than the French-Canadian star's 
was when he was breaking in. 
</P>
<P>
"I've seen more confused French-Canadians than Alex Mogilny is," Simonick said. 
</P>
<P>
But Perreault had other French-Canadians to hang out with. And he could still 
go home. 
</P>
<P>
"In this team, people don't understand me," Mogilny said. "They don't 
understand my play, my style. Central Red Army, offensive. This team, 
defensive. I got little problem. I'm nervous." 
</P>
<P>
That did not keep him from scoring 20 seconds into his first NHL game, his and 
the Sabres' first shot of the season. That did not keep him from making several 
plays in an exhibition game against the Chicago Blackhawks that left Sabres 
brass drooling at what is to come. 
</P>
<P>
Sabres fans love him, roaring every time he touches the puck. When he scored 
his first goal of the exhibition season, they gave him a standing ovation. 
Except for a few isolated shouts of "Dirty Commie" in Detroit, road crowds have 
been kind. Only the hardest heart in America would not soften at what Alexander 
Mogilny has done, and the adjustment he must make. 
</P>
<P>
Very shy off the ice because of his broken English, he is hardly shy on it. 
With his end-to-end dashes and devastating speed and puck-handling, Mogilny is 
a born showman. 
</P>
<P>
"They all know who I am," he told the Buffalo Evening News. "They expect much." 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Mogilny intends to give it to them. Bet that he will. For men like 
him, men who dare to do what he did, there is no such thing as a half-hearted 
effort.

FUHR IS STILL SHARP DESPITE LAYOFF 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Grant Fuhr was well-rested and eager to begin his season Sunday night at 
Montreal, but his Edmonton teammates were very weary. 
</P>
<P>
Although Fuhr showed early in his first game that he is still an outstanding 
goaltender, the Oilers squandered a 2-0 lead and were beaten by the Canadiens, 
5-4. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth game in eight nights for the Oilers and they finished the trip 
at 1-2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Fuhr, who announced his retirement before the season, then changed his mind, 
underwent an appendectomy just before the season began and missed the first 11 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens didn't waste any time putting the 27-year-old Fuhr, a key figure 
in the Oilers' four Stanley Cup championships, to the test. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the opening faceoff, Sylvain Lefebvre went in alone, but Fuhr 
made a fine glove save. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Martin Gelinas and Jari Kurri scored to give Fuhr a 2-0 lead. The 
Canadiens scored twice in the last two minutes of the first period to get even. 
</P>
<P>
It was 3-3 before Russ Courtnall scored on a power play at 8:23 of the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, Boston 3 -- Clint Malarchuk is making the two goaltender system work 
for the Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
Malarchuk stepped in Friday night after No. 1 goalie Daren Puppa gave up four 
goals in eight minutes and played brilliantly. 
</P>
<P>
He came back in this game at Buffalo to play brilliantly for 55 minutes. The 
Bruins scored twice in the last five minutes to make it close, but the Sabres 
held on for their fourth victory in the last five games. 
</P>
<P>
Boston scored first, but the Sabres scored four quick goals in the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
Malarchuk had 38 saves, including two difficult ones after the Bruins pulled to 
within a goal. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 1, Washington 0 -- The Capitals are playing excellent defensive hockey, 
but they suddenly have no offense. 
</P>
<P>
Trent Yawney scored in the first period at Chicago and the Capitals, 0-5-1 in 
the last six games, lost their second consecutive 1-0 game. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks regained first place in the Norris Division. DAN HAFNER

<TEXT>     The Islanders also made a major deal with the Chicago Blackhawks, sending
center Brent Sutter (the team's captain) and left wing Brad Lauer to Chicago
for left wing Steve Thomas and center Adam Creighton, players who combined for
41 goals and 64 assists for the Blackhawks last season.;   But the key figures
in all the trading activity were Turgeon and LaFontaine.;   Turgeon, the first
player selected in the 1987 NHL entry draft, had 32 goals and 47 assists for
the Sabres last season and had eight points (two goals, six assists) in his
first eight games this season. But the Sabres believe they obtained one of the
top five players in the league in LaFontaine, who has scored 287 NHL goals
since joining the Islanders late in the 1983-84 season after being the third
overall choice in the 1983 entry draft.;   "I'm sure this was a shock for
Pierre," said John Muckler, the director of hockey operations for the Sabres.
"But when you have a chance to get a player of Pat LaFontaine's caliber, you
have to make the deal.";   LaFontaine, a 54-goal scorer during the 1989-90
season, had 41 goals and 44 assists for the Islanders last season, but became
unhappy when the team refused to renegotiate his $425,000 contract. When the
season ended, he said he would not return to the Islanders unless the team was
sold, and he reportedly rejected an offer worth $6 million over four years.;  
LaFontaine was not in uniform for the Sabres when they met the Sharks on
Friday night, but he is expected to join the Sabres in time for a game Sunday
against the Hartford Whalers.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Alexander Mogilny, regarded as one of
the best young hockey players in the world, defected to the West to
play in the National Hockey League, according to Soviet and Swedish
news reports.
   Mogilny, 20, failed to show up Thursday at Stockholm's airport
to join the Soviet National Team on its return to Moscow.
   The national news agency, TT, reported that Mogilny left this
morning on a Scandinavian Airlines System plane to New York.
   Spokesmen for the NHL and the Buffalo Sabres, who hold Mogilny's
rights, said they knew nothing of the defection. Sabres spokesman
Budd Bailey said Thursday night that general manager Gerry Meehan
left town Wednesday and did not leave word where he could be
reached.
   But a Gerry Meehan was registered Thursday at the Sergel Plaza
Hotel in Stockholm, where the Soviets won the World Hockey
Championships earlier this week. Meehan could not be immediately
reached for comment.
   Soviet sources indicated in an interview with FLT, a Swedish
news agency, that he was heading to the United States to join an
NHL team.
   Soviet athletes are playing in the West in increasing numbers,
with one of Moligny's former teammates, Sergei Priakin, joining the
Calgary Flames of the NHL in March, and deals in the works to bring
other top hockey players, basketball players and boxers to the
United States.
   It was unclear what effect the defection might have on relations
between the NHL and the Soviets. Four Soviet teams are scheduled to
tour the NHL next season, and the Calgary Flames and Washington
Capitals are to visit the Soviet Union in September.
   ``I can't answer for the Soviets. They have been known in the
past to do things the way they choose,'' Flames general manager
Cliff Fletcher said in Calgary. ``I hope our relationship is
stronger than one hockey player.''
   Fletcher said he did not anticipate any demand for the return of
Priakin.
   ``We have a contract with them for the next two years. I believe
the Soviets have a reputation of being solid businessmen and will
stick to their agreement,'' he said.
   Fletcher described Mogilny as ``the best young player in the
Soviet Union.'' He was voted the world's best junior player by NHL
scouts in a poll organized by The Hockey News.
   Viktor Tikhonov, the coach of the National Team, criticized
Mogilny.
   ``This incident soured our joyful homecoming after winning the
championships,'' Tikhonov told the Soviet news agency Tass. He said
he believed Mogilny was lured by the promise of a big NHL contract.
   However, he described relations between the Soviet Sports
Committee and the NHL as stable.
   Tass said Soviet sports authorities had planned to discuss
allowing other Soviet players to sign with NHL clubs after the team
returned from the world championships.
   In reporting the defection, Soviet television said National Team
officials and the Soviet federation asked the Soviet Embassy to
tell U.S. and Canadian embassies the ``consequences of this
situation for the NHL would be most serious.''
   The owner of the Stockholm hotel where the Soviet team stayed
during the world championships contacted team officials by phone at
the airport and said he had received an anonymous phone call
informing him of the defection.
   Mogilny, a member of the Soviet Central Red Army team, served a
10-game suspension earlier this season after a fight in a Soviet
league game against Spartak Moscow. A Swedish newspaper reported
last week that he also was penalized a month's salary.
   Mogilny, a junior army lieutenant, told the Aftonbladet
newspaper that he was not interested in a military career. ``I want
to do something else with my life,'' the newspaper quoted him as
saying.

<P>
Denis Savard scored the go-ahead goal, then shared the credit. 
</P>
<P>
Savard's 27th goal with 4:39 remaining lifted Chicago to a 3-2 victory over the 
Detroit Red Wings Sunday at Chicago and gave the Blackhawks a three-point lead 
in the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
"(Steve) Larmer knocked (Bernie) Federko off the puck after going behind the 
net, and got it to (Michel) Goulet," Savard said. "It shows how much teamwork 
pays off, especially down the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
Goulet took the puck away from Mike O'Connell and passed to Savard for the 
game-winner, giving the Blackhawks 84 points to 81 for the idle St. Louis 
Blues. 
</P>
<P>
Playing in only his third game since being released from the federal medical 
center at Rochester, Minn., Bob Probert tied the score, 2-2, at 2:06 of the 
final period. 
</P>
<P>
It was Probert's third goal in three games. His status is day-to-day, 
determined on an individual game basis by his probation officer.

Detroit's Steve Yzerman scored his 60th goal. 
</P>
<P>
N.Y. Rangers 7, Philadelphia 3 -- Kelly Kisio and Mike Gartner each scored two 
goals as the Rangers moved to within two points of their first division title 
in 48 years by beating the Flyers at New York. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the Rangers 83 points, their highest total since 1983-84, and 
left them seven points ahead of the New Jersey Devils. The Rangers can clinch 
their first division title since 1941-42 Tuesday night with a victory in 
Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
The loss kept the Flyers tied for fifth place in the Patrick Division with the 
New York Islanders, two points out of a playoff spot. It was Philadelphia's 
38th defeat this season, tying a team mark set in 1971-72, the last time the 
Flyers failed to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
New York led, 2-1, after one period before putting the game away on 
second-period goals by Kisio, Gartner and Troy Mallette. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 4, Buffalo 3 -- John MacLean scored his 40th goal of the season and 
Peter Stastny had two assists as the Devils clinched a playoff berth by downing 
the Sabres at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat snapped a two-game winning streak for the Sabres, who remained five 
points behind first-place Boston and one point ahead of third-place Montreal in 
the Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey, which retained its three-point lead over third-place Washington in 
the Patrick Division, had a 4-1 lead and held on after Dave Snuggerud and Dave 
Andreychuk scored 4:17 apart midway through the final period. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 4, Calgary 1 -- Alan May scored the go-ahead goal in the third 
period on a pass from Geoff Courtnall, who also had two goals as the Capitals 
beat the Flames at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Washington opened a four-point gap on Philadelphia and the New York Islanders 
for the final Patrick Division playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary's Al MacInnis scored at 5:19 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 3, Winnipeg 3 -- Petri Skriko and Paul Reinhart scored third-period 
shorthanded goals within a 23-second span and Brian Bradley tied the score with 
1:26 left in regulation as the Canucks rallied to tie the Jets at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets built their 3-0 lead on first-period goals by Moe Mantha and Brent 
Ashton, plus a second-period score from Paul Fenton. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg moved to within four points of second-place Edmonton in the Smythe 
Division, with three games left for each team. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, Pittsburgh 2 -- Mike Tomlak scored the game-winning goal at 14:11 
of the second period and Pat Verbeek added his 44th of the season as the 
Whalers beat the Penguins at Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh remained in fourth place in the Patrick Division despite a 1-7-2 
slide since March 6. The Penguins lead Philadelphia and the New York Islanders 
by two points for the final playoff spot.

VUKOTA'S SPREE LEADS ISLANDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mick Vukota is getting a chance to play because he gives the New York Islanders 
considerable toughness up front. He is 6 feet 2 inches and weighs 195. 
</P>
<P>
The drawback is that the 21-year-old right wing has not been proficient at 
putting the puck into the net. In his first 71 games for the Islanders, Vukota 
accumulated 345 penalty minutes, but only four goals. 
</P>
<P>
For a time in the first period Friday night at Landover, Md., the Washington 
Capitals must have thought Vukota was Mario Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
Vukota scored a hat trick in five minutes to lead the Islanders to a 5-3 
victory in a fight-marred game. 
</P>
<P>
For a brief span, Vukota was a sharpshooter. At 10:08, he took a pass at the 
left side of the net and, with a quick flick of the wrist, made it 1-0 
Islanders. A little later, he knocked in a rebound. He completed his first hat 
trick since junior hockey when he slipped the puck behind goalie Don Beaupre at 
15:08 to give New York a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
After his offensive burst, Vukota reverted to his routine in the second period, 
picking up a major penalty for fighting. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 3, New Jersey 2 -- Rich Sutter, one of seven brothers to play in the 
NHL, provided the goals for the Canucks at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Sutter scored in each period for his first hat trick. The 25-year-old wing is 
probably the least known of the brothers, four of whom are still playing. 
</P>
<P>
Rich's twin brother, Ron, plays with Philadelphia, Brent with the New York 
Islanders and Duane with the Chicago Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 6, Montreal 2 -- Veteran center Dave Andreychuk had two goals and an 
assist at Buffalo to lead the Sabres to victory. 
</P>
<P>
Andreychuk's second goal, his sixth of the season, tied the score, 2-2, in the 
second period. 
</P>
<P>
He triggered a four-goal third-period burst when he set up Pierre Turgeon for 
the tie-breaking score at 4:21. Christian Ruttu assisted on the next three 
goals as the Sabres turned the game into a romp. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 3, Edmonton 0 -- It was an enjoyable return to Edmonton for Bruins' 
goaltender Andy Moog. 
</P>
<P>
Moog, who helped the Oilers win a Stanley Cup a few years ago, stopped shots to 
produce a shutout. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Dirk Graham's short-handed goal in the third period 
thwarted the Jets' comeback at Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Smail scored early in the final period to cut the Blackhawk lead to 3-2. 
When Wayne Presley went off for hooking, the Jets made a bid to tie. But when 
defenseman Fredrik Olausson fanned on a pass, Graham grabbed the puck and 
scored quickly. DAN HAFNER

AS USUAL, CANADIENS' ROY HOLDS OFF JETS, 5-1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Goaltender Patrick Roy of the Montreal Canadiens is usually the calmest man on 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
But when the Winnipeg Jets show up, Roy gets excited. 
</P>
<P>
Roy stopped 25 shots Wednesday night at Montreal and led the Canadiens to a 5-1 
victory over the Jets that enabled Montreal to tie the Buffalo Sabres for first 
place in the Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
Roy, 8-0 against the Jets, had his toughest test in the first period, when he 
made 13 saves. He held the Jets scoreless for 47 minutes while the Canadiens 
were building a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Roy, 9-5-0 this season, lost his shutout when Pat Elynuik scored with less than 
13 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal broke the game open in the second period when it scored three goals 
while outshooting the Jets, 14-4. 
</P>
<P>
Shayne Corson and Stephane Richer each scored his ninth goal for the Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
Richer is becoming the key offensive player. 
</P>
<P>
"I just show up every night," he said. "The way I've been playing just gives me 
more and more confidence." 
</P>
<P>
Boston 5, Hartford 2 -- Although his record against the Whalers isn't perfect, 
the Bruins' Andy Moog is at his best when he faces them. 
</P>
<P>
In a game at Hartford, Conn., Moog stopped 24 shots to improve his record 
against the Whalers to 11-3-1 and extend the Bruins' unbeaten streak to five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins' Bob Joyce, who had not scored in 13 games, had his first goal and 
an assist to lead the offense. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 2, New Jersey 1 -- Clark Donatelli scored on a breakaway 95 seconds 
into overtime at East Rutherford, N.J., to give the North Stars their fourth 
victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Goaltender Jon Caajsey stopped 30 shots to become a 10-game winner and put 
Minnesota just four points out of first place in the Norris Division. 
</P>
<P>
Kirk Muller scored for New Jersey at 2:50 of the second period, and Dave Gagner 
tied the game at 14:35 with his 10th goal. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey failed to score on six power-play opportunities. The North Stars, in 
the last 28 situations in which they were a man short, have given up only two 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 5, St. Louis 2 -- The Maple Leafs trailed, 2-0, late in the first 
period at Toronto, then scored five times in a row to turn the game around. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Osborne's goal at 14:35 of the second period put Toronto, 10-10-0, in 
front to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The second goal for the Blues was the 18th of the season for Brett Hull. DAN

MAPLE LEAFS KEEP HOPES ALIVE, 6-5 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
There was jubilation in Toronto Saturday night as the Maple Leafs rallied for 
four goals in the last 10 minutes to beat the Detroit Red Wings, 6-5, and keep 
their National Hockey League playoff hopes alive. 
</P>
<P>
With Ed Olczyk scoring two of his three goals in the late rush, the Maple Leafs 
moved within two points of the fourth-place Chicago Blackhawks in the Norris 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leafs have three games remaining, the Blackhawks four. The teams meet 
in the final game of the season April 2. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the loss, the Red Wings moved closer to clinching the Norris title. 
With St. Louis losing, the Red Wings need only one more point to win the 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 1, Montreal 1 -- Former King defenseman Larry Murphy scored on a 
power play with 1:57 left in regulation at Montreal to give the North Stars a 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy's 10th goal put the North Stars just two points behind St. Louis in the 
race for second place in the Norris Division. The team that finishes second 
gets home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The tie gave Montreal a 110-109 lead over the Calgary Flames in the bid for the 
best overall record. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia 6, New York Rangers 1 -- In the last two nights, the Flyers have 
virtually assured the Washington Capitals the title in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night, the Flyers played poorly and lost to the Capitals. But they 
returned home to play one of their best games in a long time. Dave Poulin 
scored twice for the Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
With only five games to play, the Capitals lead the Rangers by six points. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 6, Chicago 3 -- Ken Linseman scored the tiebreaking goal with 7:17 left 
at Boston as the Bruins moved within a point of clinching second place in the 
Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins weren't assured of the win until Ray Bourque scored into an empty 
net with 28 seconds left. Chris Janney completed the scoring with his second 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, St. Louis 0 -- Rookie goaltender Peter Sidorkiewicz stopped 29 
shots at Hartford, Conn., for his fourth shutout to keep the Whalers in the 
battle for third place in the Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers trail the third-place Buffalo Sabres by only two points and have 
four games left. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 5, New Jersey 4 -- Mario Lemieux had a hat trick as the Penguins 
bounced back from a 3-0 deficit. Lemieux's final goal, his 77th of the season, 
came with just five seconds remaining at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 4, Buffalo 1 -- Goaltender Ron Tugnutt stopped 30 shots at Quebec, and 
the Nordiques built a 4-0 second-period lead. DAN HAFNER

PROBERT'S FIRST GOAL IS A WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Detroit's Bob Probert picked a good time for his first goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
He scored 4:08 into overtime and capped a three-goal rally as the Red Wings 
defeated the Calgary Flames, 6-5, at Detroit Wednesday night for their first 
win under new Coach Bryan Murray. 
</P>
<P>
Shawn Burr had tied the game with 58 seconds left in regulation, and Probert 
flipped a 10-footer over Rick Wamsley's glove on Detroit's only shot in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The Flames, 3-1-0 under new coach Doug Risebrough, led, 5-3, until Lee Norwood 
beat Wamsley with a long slap shot with 2:39 remaining. The Red Wings pulled 
goaltender Tim Chevaldae with 1:08 to play and Burr tied the game 10 seconds 
later, deflecting Steve Chiasson's shot from the right circle behind Wamsley. 
</P>
<P>
Chevaldae preserved the tie with four saves in the overtime as the Red Wings 
killed the final 1:54 of a penalty to Chiasson. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings were 0-2-1 in their first three games under Murray, who was hired 
as coach and general manager after Detroit missed the playoffs last spring. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 4, Washington 2 -- Darren Turcotte had two goals and an 
assist, including the tiebreaking short-handed goal at 10:47 of the third 
period, and Mike Richter made 40 saves in the Rangers' win over the Capitals at 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Turcotte added an assist on John Ogrodnick's insurance goal 3 1/2 minutes 
later. 
</P>
<P>
The Capitals outshot the Rangers, 11-0, in the first five minutes and 42-17 for 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 4, Winnipeg 2 -- Dave Poulin scored the tiebreaking goal in the second 
period to lead the Bruins over the Jets at Winnipeg. It was the fourth 
consecutive win for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Christian, Peter Douris and Wes Walz also scored for the Bruins, who 
outshot the Jets, 33-30. Pat Elynuik and Danton Cole had goals for Winnipeg, 
1-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, Buffalo 3 -- Kevin Dineen's goal with 7:42 left to play was the 
difference in the Whalers' victory over the Sabres at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
The Whalers, trailing, 3-2, entering the third period, tied the score on Ulf 
Samuelsson's goal at 6:16, then won it when Dineen, assisted by Ray Ferraro 
from behind the net, connected on a quick wrist shot near the left post. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Holik, Czechoslovakian rookie forward, and Randy Cunneyworth also scored 
for the Whalers (2-1-1). Christian Ruuttu, Alexander Mogilny and Rick Vaive 
scored for the Sabres, 0-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 8, Toronto 5 -- Tony McKegney and Joe Sakic each scored two goals to 
lead the Nordiques over the Maple Leafs at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Mats Sundin, Brian Fogarty, Mike Hough and Guy Lafleur also scored in Quebec's 
first win after two defeats and a tie to begin the new season. 
</P>
<P>
Vince Damphousse had two goals and Wendel Clark, Rob Ramage and Dave Hannan one 
each for the Leafs, who have struggled with four defeats to open the season.

BRUINS WIN TO ASSURE BEST RECORD

<TEXT>
<P>
Nobody, not even the Boston Bruins themselves, thought they had a team capable 
of winning more regular-season games than anyone else in the NHL this season. 
</P>
<P>
But Thursday night at Boston, in a well-played preview of a first-round playoff 
series, the Bruins wrapped up their first Adams Division title since 1984 and 
clinched the NHL's best record with a 3-2 victory over the Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're overachievers," Bruin goalie Reggie Lemelin said. "I don't think anybody 
felt we could do it." 
</P>
<P>
Craig Janney won the game when he lifted the puck into the upper left side of 
the net with 3:09 left after Brian Propp missed a 50-foot shot that Whaler 
goalie Peter Sidorkiewicz saved before poking the puck away. 
</P>
<P>
Boston has 99 points. Calgary, with 95, can match that, but Boston would win a 
tiebreaker because it would have more wins. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 4, Toronto 2 -- Doug Wilson and Jocelyn Lemieux scored early goals as 
the Blackhawks clinched the Norris Division title at Chicago -- their first 
division championship since 1985-86. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 6, New York Rangers 4 -- Soviet defenseman Viacheslav Fetisov scored 
a goal and set up four others, tying a club single-game record for points by a 
defenseman, as the Devils clinched second place in the Patrick Division at East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The victory assured the Devils of their best regular-season finish since moving 
to New Jersey from Colorado in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 2, Philadelphia 2 -- Geoff Courtnall's goal late in the second 
period at Philadelphia allowed the Capitals to clinch a Patrick Division 
playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 5, Quebec 2 -- Russ Courtnall scored a goal and added three assists at 
Quebec as the Canadiens kept alive their chances of finishing second in the 
Adams Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadiens trail second-place Buffalo by three points. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 4, Minnesota 2 -- Scott Arniel tipped in a shot from the point to break 
a tie with 5:51 remaining in regulation at Buffalo, N.Y., as the Sabres ended 
the North Stars' four-game winning streak.

CHICAGO, ST. LOUIS KEEP ON ROLLING

<TEXT>
<P>
As recently as last season, the Norris Division was considered the weakest 
division in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
It is no longer true. In fact, two of the teams, Chicago and St. Louis, 
apparently are as good as any. Both are on winning streaks. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Thomas had a hat trick in the second period at Quebec Saturday night and 
the Blackhawks, leading the division, handed the Nordiques their 13th 
consecutive defeat, 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago is on a 5-0-2 surge and leads the Blues, who have won six in a row, by 
three points. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks had a 1-0 lead before Thomas broke the game open with his three 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis 3, Minnesota 2 -- A brilliant performance by goalie Curtis Joseph at 
Bloomington, Minn., compensated for the failure of Brett Hull to get a point. 
</P>
<P>
Hull, who has 19 goals, had an 11-game scoring streak snapped. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph stopped 34 shots and the Blues had goals from Paul Cavallini and Bob 
Bassen less than two minutes apart in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
Hartford 4, Washington 2 -- Doug Crossman and Kevin Dineen scored 25 seconds 
apart in the first period at Hartford, Conn., to lead the Whalers to their 
fourth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, the Capitals were flying high, but now they have lost five in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 1, Montreal 1 -- After being blanked by Andy Moog for 105 minutes this 
season, the Canadiens finally solved him and earned a tie at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Pederson's goal got Montreal even at 5:27 of the third period after John 
Carter scored for the Bruins in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 3, Philadelphia 2 -- Although Flyer goalie Pete Peeters protested, 
referee Kerry Fraser ruled that Bruce Driver's shot on a power play crossed the 
goal line for the winning score in the third period at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 8, Toronto 4 -- Steve Yzerman had a hat trick in the first 12 minutes 
at Toronto, then assisted on two other goals to lead the Red Wings' romp. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 3, Calgary 3 -- Mikko Makela scored with a little more than five 
minutes left in regulation at Calgary to get the Sabres the tie. DAN HAFNER

<MEMO>  NHL PLAYOFFS AT A GLANCE;   Mercury News wire services contributed to this
report.;  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 4/4/91, pg. 2D);  Because of an
editor's error, an NHL player was misidentified in a caption as Mario Lemieux
in Wednesday's editions.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  PITTSBURGH VS. NEW JERSEY; Division: Patrick.; Records: The Pittsburgh
Penguins (41-33-6) finished first. New Jersey (32-33-15) was fourth.;
Pittsburgh update: Mario Lemieux has returned from his back problems, and the
Penguins have benefited from a late-season trade that brought center Ron
Francis and defenseman Ulf Samuelsson from Hartford. Leading scorer Mark
Recchi (113 points) is nursing a knee injury but is expected to play.; New
Jersey update: No Devils placed among the league's top 25 in scoring, but John
MacLean ranked fifth in power-play goals with 19. The Devils appeared to play
with more enthusiasm after Tom McVie replaced John Cunniff as coach March 4.;
Key to the series -- Home ice. Neither team won in the other's building this
season. And the Penguins, 13-1-2 in their last 16 home games, have the
home-ice advantage.; N.Y. RANGERS VS. WASHINGTON; Division: Patrick.; Records:
The Rangers (36-31-13) placed second. The Capitals (37-36-7) were third.; New
York update: After battling for first much of the season, the Rangers
collapsed at the finish. College prospects Tony Amonte of Boston University
and Doug Weight of Lake Superior State signed with the Rangers on Tuesday.;
Washington update: Goalie Don Beaupre had a 2.64 goals-against average to rank
second in the league, but the Capitals didn't have a 25-goal scorer.
Defenseman Al Iafrate did not accompany the team to New York for tonight's
game, citing "personal and emotional reasons."; Key to the series: Special
teams. The Capitals allowed more than one power-play goal only seven times
this season, but three of those games were against the Rangers.; BOSTON VS.
HARTFORD; Division: Adams.; Records: The Bruins (44-24-12) finished first. The
Whalers (31-38-11) were fourth.; Boston update: The Bruins revolve around
defenseman Ray Bourque (94 points), right wing Cam Neely (51 goals), center
Craig Janney (92 points) and goalie Andy Moog (25-13-9, 2.87 goals- against
average).; Hartford update: The Whalers have struggled since trading Francis
and Samuelsson to Pittsburgh. Pat Verbeek had 43 goals and 39 assists this
season, but the offense drops off after that.; Key to the series: Defense and
goaltending. The Bruins, who needed seven games to beat the Whalers in the
first round last season, win on both counts.; MONTREAL VS. BUFFALO; Division:
Adams.; Records: The Canadiens (39-30-11) finished second. The Sabres
(31-30-19) were third.; Montreal update: Goalie Patrick Roy has been injured
twice this season but still went 25-15-6 with a goals-against average of 2.71,
third in the league. The Canadiens are counting on Russ Courtnall, Stephane
Richer and Denis Savard to supply offense and a young defense that limited
opponents to 249 goals (second-least in the league). Injuries have sidelined
forwards Sylvain Turgeon (broken kneecap) and Todd Ewen (hand surgery).;
Buffalo update: The Sabres have been a major disappointment. The pressure is
on goalie Daren Puppa because backup Clint Malarchuk has an 0-6 playoff
record. The Sabres will begin the series without defenseman Doug Bodger, who
is nursing a shoulder injury. Left wing Darrin Shannon (knee) is day-to-day.;
Key to the series: Roy. If he's healthy, he's good enough to give the
Canadiens a big advantage.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     The Canadiens (14-6-2) have a win, a tie and three losses since their
nine-game winning streak ended Nov. 8.;   Montreal tied the score when Paul
DiPietro scored his first NHL goal 27 seconds into the third period.;  
Pederson broke the tie by scoring on a wrist shot with 5 minutes, 9 seconds
left. Acton added an empty-net goal with 13 seconds remaining.;   "It's great
getting the two points and it's great beating Montreal in their own building,
especially since they traded me last year," said Pederson, whom Montreal dealt
to the Flyers last March 5 for a draft choice. "It's my first game back here
since the trade and it was a great feeling coming in here today and a better
feeling going out."; SABRES 5, FLAMES 4: Donald Audette's second goal of the
night with just 59 seconds remaining lifted Buffalo over host Calgary.;  
Audette's winning goal came during a five-minute high-sticking penalty to
Calgary's Jamie Macoun. Macoun's stick caught Buffalo center Pat LaFontaine in
the mouth. LaFontaine, who suffered a broken jaw, will be out indefinitely.;  
"It was a cheap shot and it's disturbing," said Sabres Coach Rick Dudley, who
called on the league to suspend Macoun. "The only satisfaction at all you can
draw from it is the fact that it cost them the game."; RED WINGS 5, KINGS 3:
In Inglewood, Steve Yzerman scored two goals in the third period as Detroit
ran its unbeaten streak to six games by defeating Los Angeles.;   Yzerman
broke a 2-2 tie with 13:36 to play when he scored his seventh goal of the
season. With 11:05 remaining, Yzerman's short-handed goal made it 4-2.;   The
Detroit center had scored only one goal in the previous 11 games.;   The Red
Wings are 5-0-1 in their last six games. The Kings are 0-4-2.; BRUINS 5,
WHALERS 4: Ray Bourque scored a power-play goal 1:39 into overtime as Boston
beat host Hartford.;   The goal came 48 seconds after Pat Verbeek was called
for slashing. The Bruins converted 3 of 9 power-play chances.;   Murray
Craven, acquired from Philadelphia on Wednesday, scored a third-period goal
that capped Hartford's comeback from a 4-1 deficit.; OILERS 6, NORDIQUES 2:
Kelly Buchberger had two goals and an assist as Edmonton broke a four-game
road winless streak by beating Quebec.;   Buchberger's second goal broke a 1-1
tie at 14:16 of the second period. Craig Simpson scored 80 seconds later as
the Oilers took control of the game.; ISLANDERS 4, RANGERS 2: The New York
Islanders, playing before their first sellout crowd at home this season, got
two goals from Benoit Hogue and beat the New York Rangers in Uniondale, N.Y.;
BLUES 5, NORTH STARS 3: Curtis Joseph stopped 27 shots and host St. Louis
scored three power-play goals to beat Minnesota.;   St. Louis scored twice
after Minnesota goalie Jon Casey came out of the crease to clear a loose puck,
leaving the net unprotected.; JETS 1, DEVILS 0: Ed Olczyk scored at 7:13 of
the third period and Bob Essensa stopped 40 shots as Winnipeg defeated New
Jersey in East Rutherford, N.J.; MAPLE LEAFS 2, BLACKHAWKS 2: Glenn Anderson
scored with 4:07 left in the third period to give host Toronto a tie with

<P>
The St. Louis Blues looked to be cruising Wednesday night, when they built a 
three-goal lead after one period against the Chicago Blackhawks. 
</P>
<P>
But it took a goal by Jeff Brown with 4 minutes 43 seconds left in regulation 
for the Blues to salvage a 6-6 tie at Chicago in a game between the NHL's top 
two teams. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks, who trailed, 3-0, after one period and 5-3 after two, went 
ahead, 6-5, with 8:06 remaining, when Adam Creighton and Wayne Presley scored 
seven seconds apart. Steve Larmer had cut the deficit to, 5-4, by beating 
Vincent Riendeau with a short wrist shot at 6:08 for his 25th goal of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Brown tied it when he picked up a loose puck and beat Ed Belfour with a slap 
shot from the top of the left circle. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks, who were shut out by the Blues last Saturday, 5-0, had a power 
play in the overtime, but Doug Wilson's shot from point-blank range hit the 
post. 
</P>
<P>
The Blues trail the Blackhawks, 53-48, in the Norris Division and the overall 
NHL standings, but St. Louis has four games in hand. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull, the NHL's top goal-scorer, got his 37th in 36 games and 12th 
power-play goal, when he beat Belfour with a 25-foot wrist shot for a 4-1 lead. 
Hull has goals in five of his last six games. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh 7, Washington 3 -- Paul Coffey scored twice in 39 seconds during a 
five-goal first period at Landover, Md., to help extend the Capitals' winless 
streak to a season-high six games. 
</P>
<P>
Coffey's 15th and 16th goals began a spree in which the Penguins scored four 
times in a span of 2:16. Bryan Trottier got the third goal, the 1,369th of his 
16-year career, to move into a sixth-place tie with John Bucyk on the NHL's 
all-time scoring list. 
</P>
<P>
The Penguins, who scored on four of their first five shots against Mike Liut, 
improved to 7-1 in their last eight games. 
</P>
<P>

tie at Buffalo, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Sabre goalie Clint Malarchuk preserved the tie with 7:40 remaining in 
regulation, when he got a toe on Dave Poulin's breakaway shot. The shot hit 
both posts before the net was dislodged. 
</P>
<P>
Bruin goaltender Andy Moog extended his unbeaten streak to eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Winnipeg 6, Minnesota 4 -- Ed Olczyk had two goals and an assist at

<DESCRIPT>  PROFESSIONAL; HOCKEY; ORGANIZATION; HISTORY; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WHEN THE NHL last had a franchise with a Bay Area address, Gerald Ford was
running the country, Guy Lafleur was unstoppable and the Montreal Canadiens
seemed unbeatable.;   It was the 1975-76 season, and the California Golden
Seals were ending a miserable nine-season run at the Oakland Coliseum Arena.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Special Section  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  CATCHING UP ON THE LEAGUE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  HOCKEY '91. NHL BASICS  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Times have changed, and so has the NHL.;   Sharks have replaced Seals as
the sea animal of choice for Bay Area hockey fans, Wayne Gretzky is the game's
most dominant player and the Pittsburgh Penguins own the Stanley Cup.;   Even
in a league bound by tradition, there is room for change.;   When the Seals
played their final season in Oakland, the NHL was made up of 18 teams. But the
Sharks are team No. 22, and the league is scheduled to grow to 24 teams next
season, when the Tampa Bay Lightning and Ottawa Senators begin competition.;
The teams; The 22 teams in the NHL this season are divided into two
conferences and four divisions:; CLARENCE CAMPBELL CONFERENCE; Smythe Division
      Norris Division; San Jose Sharks       Chicago Blackhawks; Calgary
Flames         Detroit Red Wings; Edmonton Oilers        Minnesota North
Stars; Los Angeles Kings     St. Louis Blues; Vancouver Canucks     Toronto
Maple Leafs; Winnipeg Jets; Prince of Wales Conference; Patrick Division     
Adams Division; New Jersey Devils     Boston Bruins; New York Islanders   
Buffalo Sabres; New York Rangers      Hartford Whalers; Philadelphia Flyers  
Montreal Canadiens; Pittsburgh Penguins   Quebec Nordiques; Washington
Capitals; THE BUILDINGS; The Forum in Montreal is regarded as the sport's holy
land. It's the home of the Canadiens, who have won the Stanley Cup
championship 23 times. It also has been home to such great players as Lafleur,
Jean Beliveau, Henri Richard and Ken Dryden.;      Other famous buildings in
the league include Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, Madison Square Garden in New
York, Chicago Stadium and the Boston Garden.;      The Sharks will call the
Cow Palace in Daly City home for two seasons while a downtown arena is
constructed in San Jose.; THE WINNERS AND LOSERS; The teams with the longest
and richest traditions in the NHL are Montreal, Toronto, Chicago, Detroit,
Boston and the Rangers -- the six teams that made up the league before six
expansion teams were added for the 1967-68 season.;      Of the newer teams,
the Islanders, Flyers and Oilers have been the most successful, winning at
least two Stanley Cup championships apiece.;      Hard times have hit the
Maple Leafs, Islanders and Flyers; none qualified for the playoffs last
season. But those teams haven't suffered as much in recent years as the
Nordiques, who have owned the league's worst record for three consecutive
seasons.; THE TOUGH GUYS; Not all players in the NHL are there because they
can score. Some are there because they can intimidate opponents and
occasionally beat them up.;      Dave "Tiger" Williams, who played in 962
games during 14 seasons with five NHL teams, is the leader in career penalty
minutes with 3,966. Other all-time penalty leaders include Chris Nilan (2,883
minutes in 12 seasons with three teams), Willi Plett (2,572 minutes in 12
seasons with four teams), Dale Hunter (2,471 minutes in 10 seasons with two
teams) and Dave Schultz (2,294 minutes in nine seasons with four teams).;     
Nilan and Hunter still are active, with Boston and Washington, respectively.
Other heavyweights in the league today include Detroit's Bob Probert and Troy
Crowder, Buffalo's Rob Ray, Chicago's Mike Peluso and Stu Grimson and Los
Angeles' Marty McSorley and Jay Miller.; TODAY'S GREATS; Gretzky, the
superstar center of the Kings, is the NHL's all-time leader in scoring, with
2,142 points. But he isn't the only player in the league worth watching.;     
Pittsburgh center Mario Lemieux was the league's most valuable player during
the 1987-88 season, center Mark Messier of Edmonton was the MVP during the
1989-90 season and right wing Brett Hull of St. Louis won the award last
season, when he scored 86 goals.;      Lemieux, Messier and Hull are the only
players besides Gretzky to be MVP since the 1979-80 season. The top 10 scorers
in the league last season were Gretzky, Hull, Adam Oates of St. Louis,
Pittsburgh's Mark Recchi, Hartford's John Cullen, Quebec's Joe Sakic,
Detroit's Steve Yzerman, Calgary's Theo Fleury and Al MacInnis and Chicago's
Steve Larmer. Each had at least 100 points last season.;   The list of players
to watch also includes Boston defenseman Ray Bourque (voted the league's best
defenseman four times in the past five seasons), L.A. left wing Luc Robitaille
(a 40-goal scorer in each of his five NHL seasons) and Chicago goalie Ed
Belfour (last season's Vezina Trophy winner as the No. 1 goalie in the league
and Calder Trophy winner as the rookie of the year).;      A dream-team lineup
of active NHL players might have Gretzky at center, Hull at right wing,
Robitaille at left wing, Bourque and MacInnis on defense and Belfour or
Patrick Roy of Montreal (a two-time Vezina Trophy winner) in goal.;
YESTERDAY'S HEROES; When Gretzky became the league's all-time leading scorer,
he broke a long-standing record held by Gordie Howe, who scored 1,850 points
in 26 seasons in the NHL, mostly with Detroit.;      A dream-team lineup of
former players might have Howe at right wing with Beliveau (507 goals in 20
seasons with Montreal) at center and Bobby Hull (1,170 points in 16 NHL
seasons, mostly with Chicago) at left wing. The defensemen might be Bobby Orr
(generally regarded as the best defenseman in NHL history after a brilliant
12-season career that he spent mostly with Boston) and Doug Harvey (a
seven-time winner of the Norris trophy during a 20-season career with
Montreal, the New York Rangers, Detroit and St. Louis). The goalie could be
Jacques Plante, a seven-time Vezina Trophy winner during an 18-season career.;
     Behind Gretzky and Howe in the top five on the league's all-time scoring
list are Marcel Dionne (1,771 points in 18 seasons with Detroit, L.A. and the
Rangers), Phil Esposito (1,590 points in 18 seasons, mostly with Boston) and
Stan Mikita (1,467 points in 22 seasons with Chicago).  </TEXT>

HULL GETS 14TH GOAL AND BLUES WIN, 3-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until he scored 72 goals last season, Brett Hull was best known merely as the 
son of former NHL star Bobby Hull. 
</P>
<P>
The day may come when Bobby Hull will be better known as the father of Brett 
Hull. 
</P>
<P>
Brett Hull scored his 14th goal, his seventh in the past three games, Saturday 
at St. Louis to lead the Blues to a 3-0 victory over the Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
Vincent Riendeau stopped 27 shots for his second career shutout in the first 
Blue victory at home against the Canadiens in almost three years. The Blues 
moved into a tie with the Detroit Red Wings for first place in the Norris 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Many believe that Wayne Gretzky's record of 92 goals during the 1981-82 season 
will never be broken. But with 14 goals in 11 games, Hull is on a pace that 
would break it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't even think about that record," Hull said. "All I'm doing is trying to 
help us win a Stanley Cup. That would be something special." 
</P>
<P>
Defenseman Glen Featherstone scored the last goal for St. Louis. It was his 
first in 87 NHL games. 
</P>
<P>
Boston 5, Chicago 4 -- Jacques Cloutier and the Blackhawks were rolling after 
two periods at Boston. Cloutier had faced only nine shots and Chicago led, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackhawks made the score 3-0 when Michel Goulet scored two minutes into 
the final period. But with Randy Burridge and Cam Neely leading the way, the 
Bruins scored five times to pull out the victory. 
</P>
<P>
Burridge scored twice, including the inner with 1:49 left. Neely had a goal and 
an assist. 
</P>
<P>
With two seconds to play, Dirk Graham scored an apparent tying goal, but 
referee Andy Van Hellemond ruled the net was dislodged before the puck went 
into the net. 
</P>
<P>
Calgary 9, Washington 4 -- Joe Nieuwendyk was due to break loose and the 
Capitals were the victims at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
Nieuwendyk, scoreless in the previous seven games, had two goals and three 
assists as the Flames swept into first place, ahead of the Kings, in the Smythe 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Tippett scored twice for the Capitals, who are 0-3-2 in their past five 
games at Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
New York Rangers 4, Quebec 1 -- Defenseman James Patrick broke a tie with a 
power-play goal 15 seconds into the third period at Quebec and the Rangers went 
on to their ninth victory in the past 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
The Nordiques, who lost their third in a row, took a 1-0 lead on Joe Sakic's 
eighth goal early in the second period. Shortly thereafter, the Rangers (9-3-0) 
started putting the pressure on and the Nordiques wilted. 
</P>
<P>
New Jersey 7, Pittsburgh 5 -- Laurie Boschman and John MacLean scored 31 
seconds apart in the third period and the Devils extended their home ice record 
to 7-0-1. 
</P>
<P>
With the score 4-4 after two periods, the Penguins replaced goalie Tom Barrasso 
with Wendell Young. 
</P>
<P>
Young couldn't handle Boschman's long shot at 3:06, the puck hitting his skate 
and bouncing into the net. Young then let MacLean's shot slide across the 
crease into the far corner. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver 4, Hartford 2 -- The Whalers are learning the hard way that it isn't 
the number of shots, it's the quality that wins hockey games. 
</P>
<P>
In this game at Hartford, Conn., the Whalers outshot their opponent for the 
third game in a row -- and lost. 
</P>
<P>
Trevor Linden scored twice and rookie Troy Gamble blocked 40 shots to lead the 
Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 5, Philadelphia 2 -- Pat LaFontaine, recently back from an 
injury, had a hat trick at Uniondale, N.Y., and the Islanders ended a four-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers lost more than their third in a row. Goalie Ron Hextall, sidelined 
because of a groin injury for two weeks, had to leave before the middle of the 
second period after suffering a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 3, Toronto 1 -- Firing Coach Doug Carpenter apparently wasn't the 
answer for the Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
Pierre Turgeon and Dale Hawerchuk scored third-period goals at Toronto to lead 
the Sabres. The Maple Leafs are 1-10-1. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit 2, Minnesota 2 -- Jimmy Carson scored his seventh goal with 7:10 left 
in regulation at Bloomington, Minn., to get the Red Wings a tie. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Wings trailed, 2-0, and had only 10 shots on goal in the first 40 
minutes. DAN HAFNER

<LEADPARA>  Buffalo Sabres center Pat LaFontaine, obtained in a trade last month with the
New York Islanders, is expected to be out for two months because of a broken
jaw.;   LaFontaine was struck by the stick of Jamie Macoun during a game

facial artery severed in the incident, requiring doctors to stitch the artery,
insert a plate in LaFontaine's mouth and wire the jaw shut.  </LEADPARA>

kid," but added LaFontaine remains in a lot of pain. "Obviously, if your jaw
is shattered, it doesn't feel too good," Meehan said.;   The Sabres have
petitioned the NHL to take additional action against Macoun, who received a
major penalty and game misconduct.;   "There's no question that this is the
kind of thing the NHL wants to do something about," Meehan said.; CANADIENS 1,
OILERS 0: Stephan Lebeau scored on a power-play goal nine minutes into the
second period, and Montreal limited Edmonton to 12 shots on goal in skating to
a home-ice victory.;   Goaltender Patrick Roy posted his third shutout of the
season, dropping the Canadiens' goals-against average to 1.65.;   The Oilers'
12 shots came within one of the record for fewest shots against Montreal. That
was set by the Toronto Maple Leafs on Jan. 19, 1956.; PENGUINS 7, NORDIQUES 3:
Mark Recchi had three goals and three assists as Pittsburgh beat host Quebec
in Pierre Page's first game as coach of the Nordiques.;   Kevin Stevens also
scored three goals for the Penguins.;   Quebec, which fired Coach Dave
Chambers on Sunday, suffered its sixth straight loss.  </TEXT>

<P>
All the Calgary Flames needed to break out of their scoring slump was a team 
with a slumping defense like the Boston Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
The Bruins, coming off an 8-1 beating in Edmonton on Friday night, were drubbed 
by the same score in Calgary on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
It was a fitting ending to a nightmarish road trip for Boston. The Bruins ended 
a seven-game, two-week road swing with five out of a possible 14 points 
(2-4-1). 
</P>
<P>
The Flames, lukewarm for the first seven games this season, scored five 
first-period goals. Defenseman Al MacInnis had two goals and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Robert Reichel scored his first NHL goal for the Flames. Calgary's Mark 
Hunter pleased a sellout crowd with a power-play goal and an assist. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Ranheim and Brian MacLellan got Calgary rolling in the first period with 
goals eight seconds apart, Ranheim's coming on a power play. Stephane Matteau 
and MacInnis also scored in the first, ending goaltender Andy Moog's 
nightmarish game. He was replaced by Rejean Lemelin. 
</P>
<P>
The victory improved Calgary's Smythe Division record to 5-3-0 for 10 points, 
three behind the first-place Kings. The Bruins are 4-4-1. 
</P>
<P>
Quebec 5, Detroit 3 -- Joe Sakic had two goals and an assist and rookie 
goaltender John Tanner beat the Red Wings at Quebec for his first NHL victory. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Hough, Michel Petit and Lucien DeBlois also scored for the Nordiques 
(3-3-3). Shawn Burr, Brent Fedyk and Dave Barr scored for the Red Wings 
(4-3-2). 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo 3, New York Islanders 1 -- Rick Vaive and Donald Audette scored 
power-play goals 31 seconds apart in the second period as the Sabres beat the 
Islanders at Uniondale, N.Y., for their first victory of the year.
