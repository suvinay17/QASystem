   Cigarette-vending machines will be snuffed out in this St. Paul suburb in 90 days under an ordinance passed by the city council. 
One health expert calls the move the first of its kind in the nation. 

   The measure calls for the removal of the 19 cigarette-vending machines in bars, gas stations, convenience stores and apartment and office buildings in this town of 24,000. 

   Supporters of the law include the city Fire Department, several University of Minnesota researchers, and business leaders. 

   "We believe White Bear Lake is the first city in the country to ban cigarette-vending machines," said Jean Forster, assistant professor of public health at the University of Minnesota. 

   Bill Bennis, who was the sole dissenter among the five council members voting on the matter, said eliminating the vending machines isn't "attacking the real problem. 
If merchants are sincere about this, they'd take cigarettes out of their place of business." 

   A local group claims that most young smokers get their cigarettes from machines. 

   Nationally, an estimated 3.5 million young people aged 12 to 17 consume $1 billion of tobacco products a year. 
Studies indicate that half of all smokers begin at age 13.

   The first state to ban indoor smoking except
for designated areas is now taking the lead nationally in trying to
snuff out cigarette machines _ or at least keep them out of
youngsters' reach.
   Since the St. Paul suburb of White Bear Lake passed the state's
first ban on cigarette vending machines in October, at least 20
other Minnesota cities have prohibited or restricted the machines.
   The restrictions are part of a grass-roots movement for a
smoke-free society, said Jean Forster, assistant professor in the
University of Minnesota's School of Public Health.
   ``It's captured the imagination of local communities,'' she
said. ``It's something they can do at their level. There are a lot
of places watching what's happening in Minnesota.''
   A measure pending in Congress, sponsored by Rep. Thomas Luken,
D-Ohio, would ban cigarette machines in any location accessible to
people under 18.
   Testimony at a hearing last year cited a National Automatic
Merchandising Association report that only 2.5 percent of teen-age
smokers buy their cigarettes from machines.
   But advocates of cigarette machine bans say any percentage is
significant.
   ``It may not stop kids from smoking, but it puts another
roadblock in the way,'' said White Bear Lake Mayor Jerry Briggs.
   A few other states and communities outside Minnesota have
instituted or are considering cigarette machine bans. But Angela
Mickel, director of the Tobacco-Free America Legislative
Clearinghouse in Washington, D.C., said the local campaigns in
Minnesota are the most widespread she's seen.
   ``Minnesota is looked at as a leader in health advocacy,'' she
said.
   In 1975, the state passed the nation's first Clean Indoor Air
Act. The law restricting indoor smoking was a model for laws across
the country.
   White Bear Lake and Bloomington are among at least eight
Minnesota cities banning cigarette machines altogether.
   Others have enacted softer restrictions. Redwood Falls bans the
machines from ``public places.'' Preston restricts them to places
licensed to sell liquor. Excelsior requires that machines be under
constant supervision by employees.
   The local measures were almost nullified last month when
Minnesota lawmakers considered a proposal that would have
overridden local restrictions for the sake of consistent statewide
regulation.
   The bill that passed instead preserves local governments' power
to ban the machines while tightening restrictions statewide.
   That measure, which awaits Gov. Rudy Perpich's signature,
requires electronic locks on machines that a business's employees
can activate and requires that the machines be kept where workers
can monitor their use.
   Walker Merryman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute, a
Washington trade association for cigarette manufacturers, said the
tobacco industry has taken no position on the matter. ``It's an
issue that pertains to the vendors,'' he said.
   But he added that the bans are no surprise. ``Minnesota has a
certain history of being receptive to any anti-smoking
initiative,'' Merryman said.
   The vending machine industry argued unsuccessfully before state
lawmakers that minors can be protected without a ban.
   ``We're looking for uniformity,'' said Tom Briant, lawyer for
the Minnesota Coalition for Responsible Vending Sales. ``We think
it would be in the public interest to regulate it on a statewide
basis.''
   Briant said about 275 people could lose their jobs by allowing
bans throughout the state. But anti-smoking activists say bans are
the only way to keep minors from buying cigarettes from vending
machines.
   Jordan Cushing, a 16-year-old Minneapolis sophomore, said she
knows many teen-agers whose addiction began by purchasing
cigarettes from machines.
   ``It's really, really easy,'' said Cushing, who has worked with
anti-smoking groups. ``If the machines are taken away, it would
make a big difference.''
   She said any potential loss of jobs is outweighed by health
concerns. ``Their main argument is money, but these are lives,
lives that haven't really even had the chance to get started,'' she
said.

   Cigarette vending machines will be
snuffed out in this St. Paul suburb in 90 days by an ordinance

   The measure, passed 4-1 Tuesday, calls for the removal of the 19
cigarette vending machines in bars, gas stations, convenience
stores and apartment and office buildings in this town of 24,000.
   The law was backed by the city Fire Department, several

Board and a coalition of business leaders.
   ``We believe White Bear Lake is the first city in the country to

   Council member Bill Bennis, in casting his dissent, said,
``Machines are not attacking the real problem. If merchants are

   A local group called the Tobacco Free Youth Project, whose
members have interviewed juvenile smokers, maintains that 93
percent get their cigarettes from machines.
   Nationally, an estimated 3.5 million youngsters ages 12 to 17
consume $1 billion in tobacco a year. Past studies have indicated
that half of all smokers begin at age 13.
   Eighteen months ago, White Bear Lake police started arresting
juveniles caught smoking in public. So far, 155 teen-agers have
been arrested and ordered to attend a two-night lecture and
discussion session at the White Bear Lake Community Counseling
Center.
   Of that group, just a handful were caught a second time and sent
back for another dose of counseling, authorities said. About two
dozen youths who failed to report for counseling were fined $25 to
$100 in juvenile court.

<HEAD>University to Dispense Condoms From Snack Machines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A student-led initiative aimed at safer sex
will allow University of Minnesota students this fall to buy condoms
from the same dormitory vending machines offering chocolate bars and
pretzels.
   ``I'd rather not see anyone die,'' said Joe Westrup, a university
senior and dormitory resident who helped propose the initiative.
``That's the main thing. Sex is a pretty scary thing now.''
   The university plans to stock and sell the condoms in packages of
three for a dollar in snack machines in campus residence halls and
student unions here.
   Some students say the idea will be difficult to get used to.
   ``I think AIDS is a big problem that has to be stopped, but to
sell condoms in vending machines, I think is going too far,'' said
junior Choua Vang. ``I think they should be sold in drug stores.''
   Getting condoms to students outside the walls of the campus
health service is a goal many institutions are tackling:
   _The state of Maryland distributes condoms free to University of
Maryland students and others through a ``Three For Free'' program.
   _Ohio State University is selling condoms in cigarette machines
and at bookstores. In January, it plans to phase out cigarette sales
and will switch the condom supplies to candy machines.
   _The University of Virginia sells condoms in public areas.
   ``As much as anything, I think they're a symbol that the
university cares about the students' health,'' said Jim Mitchell,
associate director of student health at the University of Virginia.
``Students make their own choices. We're saying, if you're going to
be sexually active, use condoms.''
   Mitchell said administrators expected student controversy over
the wider condom distribution on campus, but have not discovered any.
   Kathleen Matthews, director of health education at Minnesota's
Boynton Health Service, said new evidence suggests the AIDS virus is
becoming more prevalent on college campuses.
   A random national sampling of college students released last
spring showed 30 college students out of 16,861 tested positive for
the AIDS virus.
   The 0.2 percent rate alarmed researchers, said Wally Brewer,
project associate with the college health association, which
conducted the survey with the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease
Control.
   ``The incidence was cause for concern; it was higher than we
expected,'' Brewer said.
   Dormitory leaders at the University of Minnesota came up with
their proposal during the 1987-88 school year. They approached eight
university residence halls for approval before presenting the plan
to administrators.
   Westrup said students complained that it is difficult to find a
pharmacy that is conveniently located or open late at night for
impromptu condom purchases.
   Matthews said the condom vending packs also will contain
informational brochures.
   Linda Ellinger, acting vice president for student development,
said the university supports the program.
   ``We felt strongly that it was a student initiative, our students
wanted it, and there is enough evidence of the seriousness of AIDS
and its spread to warrant it,'' Ellinger said.

WEISMAN PROMISES $3 MILLION TO U. OF MINNESOTA ART MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles art collector Frederick R. Weisman has pledged $3 million to the 
University of Minnesota in the hopes that his alma mater's art museum will 
finally get a home of its own to be designed by Santa Monica-based architect 
Frank Gehry. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the University of Minnesota and I was born in Minneapolis, so 
there's a lot of strong ties there," Weisman said. "Minnesota means a great 
deal to me, and the city of Minneapolis is important to me." 
</P>
<P>
Although he said that he was "very excited" about plans for the new museum, 
Weisman stressed that the donation through his Frederick R. Weisman Foundation 
of Los Angeles must still be approved by the university's board of regents, 
which he is scheduled to meet on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by the board of regents, the $8-million structure will occupy a 
conspicuous site at the east end of the Washington Avenue Bridge. Gehry's firm 
was selected in November after a two-year search. Gehry was in New York on 
business and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
"My feet haven't touched the ground since I heard about (Weisman's gift)," said 
Lyndel King, director of the university art museum. "This means that we will be 
able to build a new museum here at the University of Minnesota, and that has 
been a dream of mine for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
Weisman's $3-million gift would qualify for a matching grant from the 
University of Minnesota Foundation. The foundation has already matched $1 
million previously raised. With the Weisman grant and match, the museum would 
have the $8 million estimated cost for the building. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to presume that this is something that's really going to happen 
until they approve it," said Weisman, whose foundation holds workshops on art 
and architecture-related topics, presents traveling exhibitions and loans works 
to American embassies overseas. "But they're talking about starting work on the 
building later this year, and they're talking about it taking about three years 
to finish the museum completely." 
</P>
<P>
Weisman hinted that his relationship with the University of Minnesota and 
museum officials, might continue. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to assist them with building this museum, then we're going to 
be awfully sure that they have art to show in there," said Weisman, whose 
foundation has sizable holdings in post-World War II art. The name of the 
building would be determined by the Weisman Foundation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1934, the museum has spent its entire existence in the university's 
Northrop Auditorium, where it is hampered by inadequate office and exhibition 
space, insufficient security and lack of climate control for displayed artwork. 
Its collection, which over the years has grown to some 12,000 objects, is 
stored in four scattered locations, according to reports.

   Thinking Machines Corp. said it sold to the University of
Minnesota a new model of a supercomputer that it expects to
become the world's fastest.
   The privately owned computer company, with headquarters in
Cambridge, Mass., provided few details about the machine,
which it plans to introduce formally in a few months. E.F.
Infante, dean of the University of Minnesota's institute of
technology, said the machine would cost more than $10 million
and run at a speed greater than 25 gigaflops. A gigaflop
represents a billion floating-point operations per second, a
measure of scientic computing speed. That would make the
machine several times faster than current machines by
Thinking Machines or Intel Corp.

<TEXT>
   Supercomputer analysts expect both companies to have
machines in the 100-gigaflop range by the end of the year.
   The University of Minnesota said the U.S. Army will
finance the purchase of the supercomputer as part of the Army
High Performance Computing Research Center, located at the
university. The center conducts unclassified research in
supercomputer hardware and software.

   Major universities are warning the Pentagon
that a military policy barring homosexuals from service is
generating pressure to oust ROTC from campuses.
   ``The contradiction between the university's principle of
non-discrimination against individuals on the basis of sexual
orientation, and the presence of an ROTC that does discriminate,
cannot exist on the campuses indefinitely,'' John M. Deutch,
provost of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said in a
letter to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   ``Many universities will withdraw from the ROTC program,''
Deutch wrote.
   The Department of Defense has declined to comment on the campus
pressure.
   Maj. Doug Hart said that because the policy is being challenged
in court the department has limited responses to a written
statement outlining the reasons for barring homosexuals.
   The military contends that homosexuality is incompatible with
military service because of the close quarters in which people of
the same sex must live and because of the security risk posed by
the possibility of a homosexual officer being blackmailed.
   Top administrators, faculty groups and students from MIT, the
University of Wisconsin, University of Minnesota, Northwestern
University and others have actively campaigned against the Reserve
Officer Training Corps policy.
   No ROTC program has been removed from a campus as a result of
the opposition.
   The ROTC, in the past year, has denied several gay cadets their
officer's commission and sought repayment of thousands of dollars
in scholarship money.
   Until recently, gay men and lesbians have been on their own in
fighting the Pentagon policy.
   One such student, Robert Bettiker, was one semester from
graduation at MIT when he old his superior that he was gay.
Bettiker was denied his commission and asked to repay $38,612 in
scholarship money.
   The growing concern among university officials confronts the
Department of Defense for the first time with institutional
opposition to the policy.
   In many instances, the opposition stems from explicit
anti-discriminatory provisions in university charters. Wisconsin
has a state law barring discrimination against homosexuals.
   The University of Wisconsin faculty senate voted in December to
expel ROTC from campus because of its policy on homosexuals. The
university regents refused to accept that proposal but told
President Kenneth Shaw to lobby the state congressional delegation,
which includes House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, a
Democrat.
   ``We want to see the law changed,'' Shaw said in a telephone
interview. ``We're not interested in getting out of ROTC.''
   Shaw said that Aspin was ``supportive but not optimistic'' that
Congress could pass a law overriding the Pentagon policy.
   At Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., an ad hoc student
group called for the removal of the campus ROTC program and the
student government organization voted to ban the program from using
university facilities and funds. Neither recommendation was
accepted by the administration.
   A faculty group at the University of Minnesota urged
administrators to lobby Washington lawmakers to change the policy.
   ``We really shouldn't be standing for discrimination at any
level,'' said Dick Caldecott, the university's liaison for federal
relations.
   At Washington University in St. Louis, where gay ROTC cadet
James Holobaugh is being asked to repay his scholarship, a student
referendum to remove ROTC was defeated. However, the provost has
written ROTC officials complaining about the policy.
   The concern by MIT is particularly significant because of the
institute's longstanding relationship with the Pentagon. MIT
receives substantial research grants from the government for
projects with military applications.
   ``One unfortunate consequence of this policy is to increase
hostility to the DOD on university campuses,'' Deutch said in his
letter to Cheney.
   The ROTC includes 86,000 students at 529 campus locations. About
21,700 students receive ROTC scholarships, which pay for tuition,
books and fees, Hart said.

<TEXT>
   New York City's health and consumer chiefs urged
lawmakers to ban cigarette machines.
   Health Commissioner Woodrow A. Myers Jr. and Consumer Affairs
Commissioner Mark Green spoke at a City Council committee hearing
Thursday on two bills designed to keep children away from tobacco.
   One bill would prohibit free distribution of cigarettes in the
city; the second would ban cigarette machines from places where
minors might have easy access to them.
   Melinda Sidak of the Tobacco Institute told the hearing her
trade association considers smoking ``an adult practice.''
   But she opposed the bills, saying 80 percent of vending machines
are already in places inaccessible to children, such as industrial
plants, bars and cocktail lounges.
   She said the industry opposes giving free cigarettes to people
under 21, but noted that the bill would prohibit free samples to
adults as well.
   Since October, at least 20 Minnesota cities have prohibited or
restricted the machines. And a measure pending in Congress would
ban them in any location accessible to people under 18.

   An ordinance banning cigarette
vending machines has met with total compliance since it went into
effect in January, a city official said Thursday.
   ``We've had a tremendous amount of success with our ordinance
here,'' said City Manager Mark Sather. ``When the ordinance took
effect, we had 100 percent compliance and little or no opposition.''
   On Thursday, federal Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan proposed model federal legislation to help states outlaw
cigarette vending machines, as well as place other restrictions on
young people's access to cigarettes.
   ``You can't buy beer from a vending machine,'' he said in
testimony prepared for the Senate Finance Committee. ``Why should
you be able to purchase cigarettes there?''
   White Bear Lake already took such a step last October, when the
Twin Cities suburb of around 25,000 approved an ordinance to remove
the 19 machines in local bars, gas stations, convenience stores and
apartment and office buildings.
   It was the first city in Minnesota to enact such a ban, but at
least 20 other Minnesota cities have prohibited or limited such
sales since White Bear Lake's action.
   ``We've had well over 200 communities from coast to coast call
and ask for copies of our ordinance and so it's gained quite a bit
of notoriety,'' Sather said.
   The vending machine industry has argued that children can be
protected without a total ban using techniques such as employee
supervision of machines and electronic locking devices that must be
activated by an employee.
   But anti-smoking activists contend that youngsters would find
ways to buy cigarettes as long as the machines were in use.
   ``Obviously, we're encouraged by it for the same reasons the
local ordinance was adopted here,''
   Sather said he found the administration's proposal a good idea
``for the same reasons the local ordinance was adopted here.''
   ``The advantage of trying to prevent or avoid juveniles trying
to smoke is the primary purpose behind our ordinance, to make it
difficult for them to gain access to cigarettes. We think it sends
a message that we don't condone it.''

<LEADPARA>  IN 1885, a group of New York journalists came upon St. Paul in the dead of
winter. Shocked by the bitter weather and the snow and ice, the reporters
returned home and wrote about the Minnesota capital as "another Siberia, unfit
for human habitation.";    Well, New York journalists can't be right about
everything. The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have grown from a
Midwestern Siberia into a metropolitan area of 2 million residents. But it
still is Siberia in one sense: Nobody else seems to know where it is, or even
that one can go there to have a good time, especially in the heart of winter.  </LEADPARA>

WINTER ACTIVITIES ABOUND DESPITE SUB-ZERO

Additional information attached to the end of this article.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Californians group it with that nebulous mass that lies between the West
Coast and New York.;    But Minneapolis-St. Paul, located at the conflux of
the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers and about an eight hours' drive northwest
of Chicago, is a gem waiting to be unearthed.;    When I recently returned to
this place where I grew up, the temperature seldom rose above zero, and wind
chills made it feel as cold as 50 below.;    When the previously mentioned New
York journalists dubbed the area uninhabitable, St. Paul residents responded
in kind by starting a Winter Carnival, as if to mock those who believed winter
should be avoided.;    In 1886, the city built an ice palace, had sporting
events and six toboggan slides. Since then, the carnival has grown into the
quintessential -- and oldest -- celebration of winter in the country. Last
year, the carnival was host to 1.5 million people.;    St. Paul's Winter
Carnival gears up during the statistically coldest weeks of the year for the
Twin Cities -- in mid- to late January. This year's carnival featured parades,
ice sculptures and fireworks. The most remarkable event of the carnival is
always the annual Torchlight Parade.;    After the last rays of the sun dip
below the horizon, thousands line the streets to watch the parade, a
celebration of the forces of summer over the dwindling power of winter.;   
Growing up in St. Paul, I went to the Torchlight Parade a number of times, and
all I remember is trying to survive the cold.;    But before I could get too
miserable, the marching bands came by, blowing horns and high-stepping. Clowns
created havoc running through the crowd. Then the royal court and the parade
marshal proceeded before us, and suddenly I didn't care about the weather. The
frosty breath of those around us was the only reminder of a temperature
registering 10 below zero.;    Twin Cities residents take an almost perverse
pride in the chilling winters they endure. While in Minnesota recently, during
an extended cold snap, I was surprised to see people outside jogging and, even
in one instance, cycling on the snow-covered paths along the Mississippi
River.;    Outdoor activity is a staple of the Twin Cities' winter experience.
Cross-country skiing is a favorite, perhaps because of the Scandinavian
heritage that pervades this part of the country. While downhill skiing offers
more intense thrills, cross-country skiing offers more peaceful sport.;    At
William O'Brien State Park, one hour's drive northeast of St. Paul on the St.
Croix River, it is not difficult to find oneself alone for a few moments in
the stark and beautiful landscape. With the birds and ducks gone south for the
winter and many animals hibernating, the forest is still and silent. A little
snow on the lips tastes good.;    Cross-country skis are available for rental,
and trails are open at the Minnesota Zoo in Apple Valley, a 20-minute drive
south of downtown Minneapolis. The trails, though more populated than those in
the state parks, are well groomed and wind through the zoo's Nordic Trek,
which takes the skier past Siberian tigers, moose, elk, caribou and other
animals roaming large, fenced-in tracts of land.;    If cross-country skiing
is not your fancy, a number of downhill resorts are in the metro area. For
those not inclined to ski at all, the Twin Cities have countless skating
rinks, many of them indoors. Other outdoor activities include sledding,
snowmobiling, ice-sailing and snow-tubing. Instead of floating down a river in
an inner tube, snow-tubing offers a quick trip down a steep hill. Rope tows
bring tubers back to the top, and enthusiasts often form tube chains for fast
and furious rides.;    Another winter passion in the Twin Cities is ice
fishing, done in huts on the local lakes.;    A group of folks will put up a
hut, cut a hole in the thick lake ice and drop in a line with a lure or a
piece of corn waiting for a nibble from the plentiful perch, crappies and
sunfish. Occasionally a hungry northern pike or an unwary walleye will take
the bait. Unlike in summertime, there isn't much else to do on the lake in
winter, so the huts are stocked with several amenities.;    One group I saw
had a cooler (to keep the beer from freezing), , a generator with a Coleman
stove and a television set. Roughing it.;    Head to either White Bear Lake in
St. Paul or Lake Minnetonka just west of Minneapolis for this pastime.;   
While ice fishing and other outdoor activities take advantage of the Minnesota
winters, Twin Cities residents also enjoy winter indoors. Both cities have
miles of second-floor skyways connecting downtown buildings. These encased,
heated walkways create a second-floor city for shoppers and the business set.;
   The metropolitan area also boasts a rich assortment of fine arts. The
Guthrie Theater, Minnesota Orchestra, St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, the Ordway
Theater and the Walker Art Center provide the staples for the traveling
culture connoisseur.;    And for sports fans, the National Basketball
Association's Timberwolves, the National Hockey League's North Stars and the
University of Minnesota's Golden Gophers basketball team are all in action.

<TEXT>
   A scientist involved in research based on
Nazi experiments that deliberately froze to death concentration
camp prisoners has resigned from the University of Minnesota.
   Dr. Robert Pozos said Thursday that he plans to continue the
hypothermia studies at his new post at the University of
Washington. He said his resignation was not prompted by the
criticism surrounding the research.
   ``I'm just changing where I'm doing my research. The work will
continue,'' said Pozos, 45, director of the hypothermia research
laboratory at the University of Minnesota, Duluth.
   Pozos, whose resignation takes effect Oct. 25, said he will
become vice president of minority affairs at the University of
Washington. He also will teach as a professor of physiology and
biophysics at the Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.
   ``Seattle is a very nice part of the world to live in ... but
I'm going to regret leaving northeastern Minnesota,'' said Pozos,
who's been at the University of Minnesota for 18 years.
   Earlier this year, Pozos sparked debate over how science should
approach data obtained during the Holocaust. He said he planned to
use Nazi studies of World War II concentration camp prisoners
imprisoned at Dachau.
   The plan was criticized by some scientists and Jewish leaders,
but some medical ethicists contend the study of Nazi research could
save lives.
   Pozos and Dr. Arthur Caplan, a University of Minnesota medical
ethicist, plan to address a conference in Minneapolis next May on
the ethical questions raised by using the Nazi studies, Pozos said.
   ``Caplan and I are using what happened in Nazi Germany more so
as a model to discuss and to show what can happen with a society
when it feels that it needs to get data to protect itself,'' Pozos
said.
   ``We're not saying it's good or bad. This is what happened,'' he
added.
   Earlier this year, Pozos said he plans to analyze and republish
a little-known World War II text, ``The Treatment of Shock from
Prolonged Exposure to Cold.''
   The study, conducted by doctors at Dachau, includes observations
and physiological measurements of human subjects placed in vats of
freezing liquid, often to the point of death, according to those
familiar with the study.
   ``You had some of the world's experts doing research in these
areas,'' Pozos said. ``It doesn't make them correct in terms of
ethics.''
   Pozos will continue to consult the University of Minnesota,
Duluth on research projects he helped start. Those projects came
from $1 million in grants from government and corporate sources.

<TEXT>
   New York City has taken another step to curb
cigarette smoking. The City Council voted overwhelmingly to ban the
sale of cigarette vending machines in most public places to keep
minors from buying smokes.
   Mayor David Dinkins, a former two-pack-a-day smoker, is expected
to sign the bill into law. The council passed it 33-1 on Thursday.
   The move makes New York the largest city in the country to
restrict cigarette vending machines, Councilman Sal Albanese said.
Salt Lake City and Minneapolis have enacted similar bans.
   The city already prohibits the distribution of free cigarettes
on the street and plans to phase out cigarette advertising on
city-owned billboards, on taxis, at baseball stadiums and in the
subways, said Councilman Joseph Lisa.
   Tobacco industry officials decried the latest ban.
   ``The tobacco industry agrees with the goal of keeping
cigarettes out of the hands of kids, but it is a misguided notion
to think that by banning cigarette vending machines that's what
you're going to accomplish,'' said Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman
for the Washington-based Tobacco Institute.
   She said 30 percent of cigarette machines are located in bars,
where children are not supposed to be anyway.
   A spokesman for cigarette maker Philip Morris Inc., Les Zuke,
called the legislation ``unnecessary'' and ``an overreaction.'' He
said vending machines account for only 3 percent of cigarette
sales.
   The bill allows machines in taverns and bars in hotels and
motels as long as they are within sight of the owner or operator,
who is supposed to stop minors from buying. State law bans the sale
of cigarettes to those under age 18.
   The bill would ban machines from such places as restaurants,
bowling alleys and theaters. Violations could result in fines
ranging from not more than $300 for the first offense to $1,000 for
the third. Any subsequent violations could result in suspension of
cigarette licenses for up to one year.
   Councilman Jerome O'Donovan, the lone dissenter, said he doubted
the law would be enforceable and that youngsters still could get
cigarettes by buying them across-the-counter.
   The Music, Cigarette &amp; Amusement Association, Inc., representing
over 150 small businesses in the vending machine industry, said in
October the proposed ban would result in the loss of jobs for 2,000
unskilled and semi-skilled workers in the city.
   Also on Thursday, Patrick Halpin, the executive of Suffolk
County on New York's Long Island, vetoed legislation meant to
restrict access to cigarette vending machines because it was not
strong enough.

   The last-second basketball victory over
neighboring Big Ten rival Wisconsin in 1986 was a proud moment for
the University of Minnesota to savor. As it turned out, it was the
last proud moment for quite a while.
   On the morning after the 67-65 victory of Jan. 23, 1986, three
members of the Golden Gophers basketball team were accused of rape
in an incident in a Madison, Wis., hotel room.
   The three later were acquitted in a trial filled with sordid
testimony. But the notoriety was only beginning for Minnesota,
which is among the nation's largest universities.
   With 44,293 undergraduate and graduate students and 18,000
extension students, the Minnesota campus sprawls over both banks of
the Mississippi River near downtown Minneapolis.
   The misdeeds, improprieties and embarrassments over the next 31
months were dizzying:
   _The men's basketball team was placed on probation by the
National Collegiate Athletic Association for numerous infractions,
mostly over its recruiting of student athletes.
   _University President Ken Keller resigned in a scandal over
hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on his official residence.
   _Keller's interim replacement, Richard Sauer, admitted
plagiarizing part of a magazine article while applying for a job
elsewhere.
   _A former university official was indicted on charges of
swindling money and giving it to athletes; the school's popular
athletic director, Paul Giel, was fired.
   The troubles may be unprecedented among major universities.
   Robert L. Gale, president of the Association of Governing Boards
of Universities and Colleges, recalls discussing Minnesota's skid
with colleagues. ``They would say, `Those poor devils. Everything
has happened to them at once.'''
   The long-term effect isn't clear.
   ``It is going to be more difficult for the university to
function in an autonomous fashion because the Legislature is going
to be looking over their shoulder a lot more than it has in the
past,'' said Gale.
   After the 1986 rape charges, many people began looking over the
university's shoulder.
   A Big Ten report later that year said the men's athletic
department had the conference's lowest rate of graduation from 1978
through 1983.
   While the school was still reeling from that report, NCAA
investigators arrived to investigate recruiting.
   In March, the NCAA announced 40 rules violations, most of them
in the basketball program under Coach Jim Dutcher, who resigned
after the rape trial.
   In the same month, Keller resigned after a six-week controversy
over university financial management. It was sparked by his $1.5
million renovation of the official residence at more than twice the
budgeted amount.
   Keller also approved a $200,000 remodeling of his offices,
including a $15,822 mahogany desk and credenza.
   Students picketed the mansion, and a local radio station's ditty
referred to Keller as the ``Renovation Man.'' His ``Commitment to
Focus'' plan to upgrade some programs, cut others and reduce
enrollment by 8,000, was mockingly referred to as ``Commitment to
Furniture.''
   A widening probe turned up a $221 million reserve fund. Critics
called it a slush fund, and it rankled professors whose programs
had been targeted for elimination and angered some contributors and
alumni, who quit giving.
   When Sauer took over the president's duties, he remained in his
own home, accepted a used desk and set out to mend fences.
   Then the plagiarism scandal hit him while he was applying for
the presidency of North Dakota State University.
   After he apologized to the University of Minnesota regents, they
gave him a unmanimous vote of confidence. North Dakota State since
has asked him to renew his application for the presidency.
   Sauer's troubles were followed by the athletic department coming
under further investigation. Luther Darville, former acting
director of the school's Office of Minority and Special Student
Affairs, was indicted in May on three counts of felony theft by
swindle.
   Darville has fled to his native Bahamas and authorities have
started extradition proceedings.
   University officials acknowledge that the turnover among top
personnel has caused problems, but they say the school is running
more smoothly than might be expected.
   ``I think the fact is that the university is being well-governed
by the interim people,'' said David Lebedoff, chairman of the
University of Minnesota Board of Regents.
   George Robb, the university's associate vice president for
external relations, said the school's reputation among the public
is less important than its image among potential students and
faculty.
   ``The graduate student or faculty member who might be thinking
about coming here in physics is much more concerned about the
physics department than the athletic department,'' he said. ``We've
got more than 100 new endowed chairs that have resulted from the
fund-raising campaign that just finished. That's almost an
unheard-of number of endowed chairs.''
   David Merkowitz, spokesman for the American Council on
Education, said he couldn't recall any other university having so
many problems recently.
   Still, Merkowitz said, ``I am absolutely sure a university like
Minnesota with 45,000 students is going to survive these things.''

<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When CBS-TV correspondent Harry Reasoner
gives the commencement speech for the University of Minnesota's
College of Liberal Arts, he will receive the journalism degree that
eluded him for almost 40 years.
   Reasoner, 66, who grew up in Minneapolis, attended Stanford and
Minnesota but never earned enough credits to receive a degree.
   But during the last few years, he received the credits he needed
by submitting about a half-dozen classes worth of independent study
to Minnesota's School of Journalism. His grades were not disclosed.
   ``The oldest B.A. in the history of the University of
Minnesota,'' Reasoner, who will receive his degree June 11, said by
telephone from New York.
   ``About 20 years ago, the Board of Regents gave me a
distinguished alumni award, which was slightly bigger than the
Congressional Medal of Honor, and I said, `Why don't you just give
me my bachelor's degree?'
   ``They said, `Why don't you take Reporting and Public Affairs
101?' I let it pass.''
   A few years ago, Reasoner met Professor Irving Fang.
   ``He sort of took me under his wing and talked to a couple of
other journalism professors and found out what it would take to
satisfy the requirements. We did it,'' Reasoner said.
   ``Honorary degrees are one thing. This is a real one. I'm proud
of it.''
   The lack of a degree hasn't hindered Reasoner, who has had a
35-year career in network news, including 13 years as co-editor of
``60 Minutes,'' the popular CBS News magazine program.
   Now, like most college graduates, Reasoner hopes his degree will
help him land a good job.
   ``I assume if I want to retire and teach journalism, now I would
qualify,'' he said.

   The University of Minnesota Hospital is
investigating its chief heart-lung surgeon for allegedly ordering
an associate to perform a bypass operation on a patient considered
dead before surgery began, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Hospital officials also are looking into an allegation that
Stuart Jamieson or one of his assistants left a pair of surgical
forceps in another heart patient's chest, then failed to inform the
patient, the patient's family or operating room personnel when the
instrument was removed during a second operation, the Minneapolis
Star Tribune said in a copyright story.
   Jamieson, chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the University of
Minnesota Hospital and director of its Heart-Lung Institute,
declined to comment, but spokeswoman Sue Swenson said Jamieson has
denied all the accusations in interviews with hospital officials.
   ``What you have are rumors that are the product of professional
jealousy,'' Ms. Swenson said. ``Dr. Jamieson has decided not to
dignify them with a response.''
   Jamieson, a former director of Stanford University Medical
Center's heart-lung transplant program, was hired by the university
in March 1986 to develop a similar program, the first in the
Midwest.
   The newspaper quoted sources who said that Jamieson overruled a
heart surgeon in his department on May 5 and ordered her to perform
a coronary artery bypass on a 43-year-old woman. Minutes earlier,
the surgeon had canceled the operation because she believed the
patient was dead.
   However, about 10 minutes after the operation was canceled, the
surgeon notified operating room nurses the bypass would be
performed after all, on orders from Jamieson. After the operation,
the patient remained attached to a mechanical heart pump but never
regained consciousness, the newspaper said.
   A hospital pathologist who performed an autopsy concluded the
surgery had been unnecessary since the woman either was clinically
dead at the time or had no chance of surviving the bypass operation.
   The woman's medical insurance carrier was billed more than
$22,000 for that operation and for a second, exploratory operation
hours later in which doctors attempted to stop internal bleeding.
   Jamieson also is under investigation for allegedly failing to
disclose that a pair of forceps had been left in the chest cavity
of a 78-year-old man who underwent a coronary artery bypass April
15, the newspaper said.
   The forceps were discovered in a routine chest X-ray, but the
three X-rays showing the location of the forceps have been missing
from the patient's medical records since shortly after the second
operation was performed, the newspaper said.
   The patient's insurance company was billed about $19,000 for the
two operations, the newspaper said.
   Jamieson has told hospital officials that no forceps were found
in the patient's chest.

<HEAD>Researchers Moving Toward Vaccine For Lyme Disease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vaccine to protect against Lyme disease could
be available in five years, said the inventor of a vaccine that has
protected laboratory animals against infection.
   Russell Johnson, a microbiologist at the University of Minnesota
in Minneapolis, said negotiations with makers of human vaccines
should conclude within a month, allowing research to apply the
animal vaccine to humans.
   The vaccine was patented by the University of Minnesota, and its
use has been licensed to Molecular Genetics of Minneapolis, Johnson
said. The company is now negotiating with vaccine makers, he said.
   The vaccine, developed in 1986, protects hamsters from infection
with Lyme disease, which is spread by ticks, said Russell Johnson,
a microbiologist at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.
   A vaccine to protect dogs and other animals against Lyme disease
could be ready for use in a year, said Johnson. Development of a
human vaccine takes longer because of the higher standards such a
vaccine must meet, he said.
   Johnson said he and his colleagues showed in 1986 that injecting
dead Lyme disease bacteria into hamsters would protect them against
infection.
   Last month, researchers at the University of Wisconsin used a
slightly different technique to protect hamsters against Lyme
disease. They first produced antibodies against Lyme disease
bacteria by injecting the bacteria into a group of hamsters, said
Ronald Schell, director of the research.
   They then extracted the antibodies and used them to protect
another group of hamsters, which had been irradiated so that they
would lose their normal immune systems and would therefore show the
symptoms of Lyme disease.
   When hamsters were given the antibodies before being infected,
they developed no sign of disease, said Ronald Schell, director of
the research. The finding was announced by the university in
December and a report appears in the January issue of Infection and
Immunity.
   Schell criticized the federal government for not providing more
financial support for research on Lyme disease.
   ``The state of research for Lyme disease is being hampered
because of the lack of federal support,'' he said. ``We want to get
rid of the disease, and it seems now it might be easier than we
thought.''
   Lyme disease, which is spread by ticks found on deer, mice and
other mammals, usually begins with a characteristic bull's-eye
rash, a red ring around a clear center. It causes arthritis-like
inflammation of the joints and can cause damage to the nervous
system. It can usually be treated with antibiotics.
   Between 1980 and 1988 some 14,000 cases were reported in the
United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
The actual numbers may be several times that, doctors say.
   More than one-third of the cases, or about 5,000, occurred in
1988. Most cases have been confined to the Northeast, Wisconsin and
Minnesota.

<TEXT>     "Everyone knows the cigarette industry is losing customers by the thousands
every day, and that they target young people to get them hooked," said
Councilman Robert Garfinkle, who brought the idea up before the council last
month after reading an article on another California city that was considering
a ban on the machines.;    This month, Rancho Mirage, a desert community east
of Los Angeles, became the first city in the state to prohibit the vending
machines.;    The California cities of Duarte, Manteca and San Marcos limit
cigarette vending machines to bars.;    Across the country, New York City has
banned the sale of cigarette vending machines in most public places. Salt Lake
City and Minneapolis have enacted similar bans.;    Most states, including
California, ban the sale of cigarettes to minors. However, Garfinkle said
vending machines are rarely supervised, which allows minors free access to
them.;    "A vending machine doesn't know the difference between a kid and an
adult," he said. "I think we should just ban them altogether.";    A million
teen-agers start smoking every year, according to government estimates, and 90
percent of the nation's 50 million smokers started as teen-agers. Answering
criticism that it profits from teen-age smoking, the tobacco industry last
month announced it would begin a campaign to discourage smoking by youths
under 18.;    The Tobacco Institute, the trade group for the nation's
cigarette companies, said one focus of its campaign would be to support a
national legal smoking age of at least 18.;    The institute will also urge
restricting minors' access to cigarette vending machines, banning or limiting
marketing practices like billboard advertisements near schools, and providing
support materials to parents and stores that sell tobacco products.; IF YOU'RE

A delegation from Minnesota is trying to persuade the NCAA to move the 1993 
College World Series from Omaha, the event's home the last 42 years, to the 
Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
A seven-man delegation representing the University of Minnesota, the Metrodome 
and the Minnesota Twins made the presentation earlier this week in Kansas City, 
Mo. 
</P>
<P>
"No bid was submitted, nor was one requested. It was just a discussion to see 
what's available and a good opportunity to visit," said Dennis Poppe, NCAA 
director of championships. 
</P>
<P>
University of Minnesota men's Athletic Director Rick Bay, who led the 
delegation, said he is sensitive to the College World Series' close ties to 
Omaha, where 186,000 people attended the event last June. "It's a great 
environment, almost a 'Field of Dreams' atmosphere," Bay said. "We aren't 
trying to convince the NCAA to move it out of Omaha, but if it is moved, it 
only makes sense to go to a higher level." 
</P>
<P>
The College World Series is committed to Omaha until 1992.

<HEAD>Surgeon Steps Aside Temporarily Over Newspaper Report</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The University of Minnesota's chief
heart-lung surgeon has temporarily stepped down from his leadership
posts amid controversy generated by an article a newspaper now
regrets publishing.
   The Star Tribune today said running the story was a ``serious
lapse in journalistic judgment.''
   The newspaper reported Tuesday that Dr. Stuart Jamieson was
being investigated by the university for allegedly ordering an
associate to perform bypass surgery on a patient considered dead
before the operation began.
   The University of Minnesota issued a statement Wednesday saying
Jamieson was stepping aside temporarily from his positions as head
of cardiovascular surgery and director of the university's Heart
and Lung Institute.
   Jamieson and University Hospital's chief of staff and general
director have ``discussed a set of expectations regarding
compliance with hospital policy and procedure and medical staff
standards,'' the university said.
   In a front-page statement today, Star Tribune executive editor
Joel Kramer said the account of the surgery should not have been
published ``because it was based on sources who did not have
firsthand information to support the account.''
   ``The surgeon who performed the operation, Dr. Jolene Kriett,
has since denied that Dr. Jamieson knew anything about the surgery
until several hours after it was performed,'' Kramer said. ``The
Star Tribune's efforts to reach Dr. Kriett before publication of
the first story were unsuccessful, and Dr. Jamieson had refused to
comment.
   ``Publishing the account of the events, when we had not
confirmed it with anyone having firsthand knowledge of the facts,
was a serious lapse in journalistic judgment, which we regret,'' he
said.
   Jamieson, 40, who came to the university two years ago from
Stanford University, will continue in his academic position as
surgery professor and will continue as a member of the medical
staff of the University of Minnesota Hospital and Clinic, the
university statement said.
   Jamieson could not be reached for comment because he left on a
two-week vacation Wednesday. The statement said hospital
authorities had no further comment.
   However, the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch quoted sources as
saying Jamieson was asked to step down from the leadership roles.
The newspaper said there has been a sharp dispute over his
personality and aggressive management style.
   Kriett told the Star Tribune and the Pioneer Press Dispatch
Tuesday night that she did not consult with Jamieson before
deciding to operate on a 43-year-old woman whose heart had stopped
beating five times before surgery began.
   ``It sure didn't happen as it was reported in the paper,'' the
Pioneer Press Dispatch quoted Kriett as saying. ``I was the one on
call and it was my own decision.''
   Dr. Neal Vanselow, university vice president for health
sciences, said Wednesday that the university is ``looking into some
allegations against Jamieson, and the Kriett surgery is one of
them.''
   Kriett said she canceled the surgery after the patient's heart
stopped beating but decided a few minutes later to proceed with the
operation in a final attempt to save the woman's life.

   One of the most widely used psychological
tests in the world has undergone a personality change after about
50 years.
   The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, administered
millions of times a year to job applicants and others, has been
updated to reflect 1980s attitudes and ailments.
   For instance, it no longer asks test subjects if they enjoyed
reading ``Alice in Wonderland.'' The test has also done away with
male pronouns in questions pertaining to both sexes, no longer
assuming, for example, that political candidates are male in a
question about voting habits.
   Among questions removed were those about religion, sexual
preference and bodily functions such as excretion. Several
references that researchers thought were anachronisms were deleted,
such as one to the children's game ``Drop the Handkerchief.''
   ``Some of the questions were objectionable and some were out of
date,'' said James Butcher, a psychology professor at the
University of Minnesota who helped revise the test. ``My
conclusions were that it was basically a very sound instrument, but
it could be improved.''
   About 100 items have been added, designed to pinpoint such
modern problems as ``Type A'' achievement-oriented behavior, drug
abuse and attitudes about mental health treatment. Researchers
turned to alcohol treatment centers, mental health programs and
personnel settings to get a read on contemporary issues.
   The original test of 556 true-false statements was questioned by
critics because it used as a basis for normal personality the
answers from a sample group of about 700 rural Minnesotans,
averaging 35 years old with eighth-grade educations.
   Butcher last week said the revised sample is four times that
size and covers various ethnic, economic and geographic groups from
seven regions around the country.
   ``We've tried to make the test more applicable to today's
problems,'' he said. The revision is designed to be ``more user
friendly and of similar validity as the original test.''
   The test was developed at the University of Minnesota in the
1930s and 1940s by psychologist Starke R. Hathaway and psychiatrist
J. Charnley McKinley.
   They compared a sample group with a group of patients diagnosed
with problems including paranoia, schizophrenia, depression and
obsessive-compulsive tendencies. Results were intended to reveal
social and personal maladjustment.
   The test is used in more than 100 countries in scores of
translations, Butcher said. Originally used primarily in clinical
settings, it has spread to personnel, military and research
applications.
   Sample true-false questions include: ``I do not tire quickly,''
``I am worried about sex'' and ``I believe I am being plotted
against.''
   The seven-year revision was completed by Butcher and psychology
professors Auke Tellegen, also of the University of Minnesota, John
R. Graham of Kent State University and W. Grant Dahlstrom of the
University of North Carolina.
   The revised test is similar to the original, with test subjects
answering 567 questions on their feelings, symptoms, attitudes and
beliefs.
   Only licensed psychologists are authorized to buy the test,
whose rights are owned by the University of Minnesota Press.
   ``Anybody who can count can score it, but it takes expertise to
interpret it,'' Butcher said.

<TEXT>
   The University of Minnesota's president has
resigned, citing controversy over the $1.5 million renovation of
his official residence, Eastcliff, and the $200,000 remodeling of
his campus office suite.
   ``Over the past few weeks, you and I have lived with stories
about Eastcliff renovations and repairs,'' Kenneth Keller,
president for three years, told a news conference Sunday night at
the 55,000-student Big 10 school.
   ``The stories have not been good ones,'' he said. ``I bear a key
responsibility for it. ... I am profoundly embarrassed and
profoundly sorry for it.''
   After repeated assertions recently that he planned to stay in
office, Keller, 53, said he now believes he cannot overcome the
controversy. He said he was informing the university's Board of
Regents he would step aside as soon as they arrange for an interim
replacement.
   The regents never gave formal approval for the mansion
renovation, which was orginally supposed to cost $400,000, a recent
report by the legislative auditor's office said.
   The report said the involvement of Keller and his wife,
university attorney Bonita Sindelir, in the renovation led to some
of the additional costs.
   Among the most embarrassing expenditures were those for a
mahogany desk and credenza for Keller's office that the legislative
auditor said cost $17,445. Keller has offered to pay for the office
furniture.
   ``I have said recently that I thought I could learn from the
mistakes of Eastcliff, improve the management of the university
where it's needed, and get on with the important job of completing
`Commitment to Focus,''' Keller told the news conference Sunday
night.
   ``Commitment to Focus'' is Keller's controversial $35.2 million
plan to improve the quality of the university while reducing
undergraduate enrollment.
   ``I have also said that if I felt my presence would hurt more
than help in accomplishing that task I would step aside,'' he said,
adding, ``As painful as it is for me to say, I now believe that to
be the case.''
   After he read a brief statement, Keller left without responding
to questions.
   Regent Chairman David Lebedoff and Gov. Rudy Perpich were
expected to comment on Keller's announcement today, spokesmen said
Sunday night.
   The St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch, quoting sources it did not
name in today's editions, said Perpich and Keller met privately
Sunday for about 90 minutes and that Perpich had indicated before
the meeting that he was prepared to ask Keller to step down.
   Perpich spokeswoman Patrice Vick would confirm only that a
meeting occurred.
   According to the newspaper's sources, Perpich was highly
irritated when he learned last week that the university had amassed
a reserve fund of more than $50 million.
   Keller's critics in the Legislature called it a ``slush fund.''
   Legislative auditors who revealed the existence of the $50
million fund said it was under the control of Keller and other top
university officials and that some of the money was used on the
house renovation without approval of the Board of Regents.
   Spending on the mansion was revealed in news media reports in
early February. Keller then went to Hawaii on a vacation, angering
lawmakers who thought he should have stayed available to answer
questions about the remodeling.
   Keller, a New York City native, came to the university in 1964
as an assistant professor in chemical engineering and materials
science, and became a department head in 1979.

A $3-million gift from a Los Angeles art collector and philanthropist appears 
to mean the University of Minnesota art museum will finally get a home of its 
own, designed by one of America's most prominent architects. 
</P>
<P>
The new building has been made possible by a gift from Frederick Weisman, whose 
$3-million gift qualifies for a matching grant from the University of Minnesota 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
The museum will be designed by Santa Monica architect Frank Gehry. Gehry has an 
international reputation for designing buildings that are themselves considered 
works of art. 
</P>
<P>
The $6 million generated by Weisman's gift, plus $1 million previously raised 
and matched by the foundation, means that the museum needs only the approval of 
the university Board of Regents. Weisman is expected to attend the Jan. 12 
meeting of the board, where they will discuss the new $8-million structure. 
</P>
<P>
Weisman, who was born and raised in Minneapolis, will decide whether the museum 
will bear his name or that of his parents, William and Mary Weisman.

   Cigarette vending machines will be banned
from gas stations, some restaurants and other areas open to the
public in a measure intended to curb sales of cigarettes to minors.
   The City Council first considered banning cigarette vending
machines from all places open to the public, but that effort
failed. The revised measure, passed unanimously, includes three
exceptions to the ban.
   The machines will be allowed in factories and workplaces, in
restaurants with liquor licenses and in hotels.
   But machines at the hotels and sanctioned restaurants must be in
view of a clerk, according to the ordinance. And in the case of
hotels, the machines must be equipped with remote-control shut-off
systems.
   Minneapolis joins four other Minnesota communities that have
banned or restricted unsupervised cigarette vending machines.
   In Indiana Friday, a similar measure, which would have ordered
removal of cigarette vending machines from family restaurants,
shopping malls and other places accessible to children, failed to
clear a state Senate committee.

   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan urged the
states today to ban cigarette vending machines, license tobacco
retailers and take other steps to stop young people from buying
tobacco.
   In testimony submitted to the Senate Finance Committee, Sullivan
said strengthening enforcement of laws that prohibit the sale of
cigarettes to children is ``the single most important reform''
states could make to keep teenagers from taking up the habit.
   Sullivan proposed model legislation that he urged the states to
enact, including a ban on vending machines that dispense cigarettes.
   ``You can't buy beer from a vending machine. Why should you be
able to purchase cigarettes there?'' Sullivan asked.
   The package also includes a provision that would create a
licensing system for tobacco retailers similar to the system used
to control the sale of alcoholic beverages.
   Another provision would institute penalties, including fines and
license suspensions, for retailers who sell cigarettes to minors.
   ``The model law attempts to create workable procedures which
will provide retail outlets the incentives and tools to refuse to
sell tobacco to minors, as already required by law in 44 states''
and the District of Columbia, he said.
   Sullivan said adult smokers would not be affected by the
proposed law.
   A spokesman for the Tobacco Institute, Walker Merryman, said
Sullivan's proposal was ``an easy shot at the people who own and
operate vending machines,'' but would not be effective at keeping
tobacco away from children.
   ``I don't think that this is going to do anything to affect the
number of young people who buy cigarettes,'' Merryman said. ``We
know from a variety of surveys that a very small percentage of
minors who buy cigarettes buy them from vending machines.''
   Ahron Leichtman, president of Citizens Against Tobacco Smoke,
praised Sullivan's ideas, which he said could ``become the
centerpiece of America's war against drugs. The momentum is
building for an all-out battle against tobacco.''
   After his testimony, Sullivan was asked by reporters why he was
proposing a state-by-state solution rather than a uniform federal
law. He said that ``by encouraging the states to enforce their
laws...(we) would use the system that's already in place.''
   He said the states could phase in such a ban on vending machines
by first restricting their locations to places such as nightclubs
and bars where children are not permitted.
   ``Problems don't always have to be solved with a broad swath
from the federal government,'' he said.
   Sullivan also said that he supported the intent of anti-smoking
legislation that was passed by a Senate committee last week, but he
said the administration does not support the legislation because it
would create another federal bureaucracy.
   Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen said he was interested
in Sullivan's approach and said the proposed model state
legislation ``is a good step forward.''
   Anti-smoking legislation approved last week by the Senate Labor
and Human Resources Committee would spend $110 million on a program
to encourage states to enforce laws against the sale of cigarettes
to minors, including restrictions on vending machines.
   The Bush administration in February said many provisions of the
legislation were unnecessary.
   An article in this week's issue of the Journal of the American
Medical Association said 3 million Americans under age 18 consume
947 million packs of cigarettes and 26 million containers of snuff
and chewing tobacco annually.
   Nearly 19 percent of high school seniors smoke daily _ 11
percent of them more than a half pack per day _ according to an
annual survey of high school seniors by the National Institute on
Drug Abuse's annual survey of high school seniors.
   Sullivan has said that 80 percent to 90 percent of adults who
smoke started before they were 18 years old.
   About 16 percent of illegal cigarette sales to minors come from
vending machines, according to a report by the inspector general of
the Department of Health and Human Services requested by Sullivan.
   ``The younger the children are, the more likely they are to
purchase from a machine,'' said the report released today.
   ``Enforcement experts agree that effective youth access
legislation should deal with vending machines,'' the report said.
   The report said half the states have no policy on access to
cigarette vending machines by minors, and a third require a warning
sign be posted on the machine saying sales to minors are prohibited.
   A few states limit placement of vending machines to places that
do not allow children, and Utah had limited success in an
experiment using locking devices that required an employee to
activate the machine, the report said.
   Sixteen communities in Minnesota have banned cigarette vending
machines entirely and ``these bans have generally been well
received and are expected to lead to stricter enforcement of
over-the-counter sales.''
   Sullivan has made anti-smoking issues one of his top priorities
at the Department of Health and Human Services.
   In January, he took on R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. for planning to
test market a cigarette aimed primarily at blacks, saying the
company was promoting ``a culture of cancer.'' The next day,
Reynolds canceled its plans.
   Then he called on professional athletes to turn away the ``blood
money'' from cigarette companies that sponsor sporting events.
   More recently, lawmakers were wondering whether Sullivan had
changed his views on smoking when his assistant secretary for
health, James Mason, canceled his appearance at a congressional
hearing on cigarette exports.
   But Sullivan said that was a trade issue and best addressed by
trade officials. He said one of his top priorities remains ``to
eliminate the use of the only legal substance that when used as
intended causes death.''
   Cigarettes, health officials say, cause about 390,000 premature
deaths annually from lung cancer, heart disease and other
cardiovascular disorders.

   An unusually arid spring has kicked up what
meteorologists are calling the worst blowing dust in at least a
decade, damaging crops and creating hazardous driving conditions in
Minnesota, South and North Dakota.
   Light rain that fell in parts of northern Minnesota and North
Dakota today will help somewhat, said Sam Standfield of the
National Weather Service in Minneapolis.
   ``It will help at least keep the dust down for a while, but
we're going to need more rain than this to end the drought
problem,'' Standfield said.
   In northern Minnesota, the dry spring has caused the worst
conditions of blowing dust in a decade, said William Larson, head
of the University of Minnesota's soil science department.
   The dust has been even worse in North Dakota, says state
climatologist John Enz. ``Over most of the state, we've had the
driest September-through-April since the 1930s,'' he said.
   Conditions are poor in the northeast and northcentral sections
of South Dakota, where officials have declared an agricultural
disaster in 13 counties, said state climatologist Bill Lytle.
   ``There have been a lot of calls from farmers reporting crop
damage,'' said Wally Nelson, superintendent of the Southwest
Experiment Station of the University of Minnesota at Lamberton.
   Blowing dust around Aberdeen, S.D., has filled ditches along
roads, and police closed roads in that area around two weeks ago
when a heavy storm made visibility dangerously low and began
causing accidents.

   The Minnesota Supercomputer Center said
Tuesday it will install International Business Machine Corp.'s most
powerful computer as part of a $55 million partnership expected to
influence design of the next generation of IBM supercomputers.
   Using an IBM 3090 supercomputer with 12 interconnected
processing units and with a memory capacity of more than five
billion characters of information, the supercomputer center will
explore new ways to connect even more advanced supercomputers, the
center and IBM said in a joint statement.
   IBM is funding about half the cost of the project, according to
the statement.
   ``Our partnership with IBM brings us the new capacity and
challenge we need to maintain MSC as a world-class facility,'' said
John M. Sell, chief operating officer and president of the
Minnesota Supercomputer Center.
   Under the agreement, the supercomputer center will join IBM as a
development partner and will use IBM supercomputing equipment in
projects the center manages for its scientific and engineering
customers. Sell said engineers at the center will be devising
software with applications for all sorts of industries.
   Also, the center will join the IBM Information Network and will
provide AIX services to IBM customers who use the network,
according to the statement.
   AIX is an operating system designed to make supercomputers,
advanced workstations and other data processing equipment operate
in an environment that can handle numbers of users who want to
perform many computing tasks simultaneously.
   The Minnesota Supercomputer Center is a private corporation
owned jointly by the University of Minnesota and the University of
Minnesota Foundation.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ After two years of scientific barhopping, a
University of Minnesota anthropologist has discovered that
country-and-western music can be hazardous to one's sobriety. That
jazz tends to leave folks in their cups. That small dance floors,
dim lights and live bands all make people drink faster. When it
comes to boozing, Jim Schaefer's an expert. He once spent his
weekends drinking Jim Beam out of a toilet plunger.

   Jim Schaefer is taking all the fun out of
drinking. In fact, he's got it down to a science.
   ``Check out the bar: Is it linear? Rectangular?
Horseshoe-shaped?'' Schaefer zeroes in on the serving counter of
yet another Minneapolis watering hole. ``Do you have an opportunity
to be face-to-face? How do people clump when it's crowded? Let's
look at the lamps: how many foot-candles of light? Is it noisy? A
decibel-meter would be nice...''
   Welcome to the Wild Kingdom of barroom anthropology.
   There are 656 bars in the Twin Cities, and Jim Schaefer has
bellied up to a big share of them. Of course, he didn't do all that
barhopping for fun.
   Well, not entirely.
   As director of the University of Minnesota's Office of Alcohol
and Other Drug Abuse Prevention, the lanky anthropologist wanted to
find out how lights, music and other environmental cues influence
the way people drink.
   Two years and five dozen bars later, Schaefer has discovered
that country-and-western music can be hazardous to one's sobriety.
That jazz tends to leave folks in their cups. That small dance
floors, dim lights and live bands all make people drink faster.
   Turn up the volume, throw in lots of seats, hang some action
photos on the walls, and there you have it: Jim Schaefer's
prescription for hangovers by the dozen, aspirins by the score.
   But there's no use crying in your beer. Just take off that
neckerchief and put on a tie. Dress codes help people stay sober.
So do upscale settings. ``Drunks violate the decorum,'' Schaefer
says.
   Add a jukebox, but keep the volume low, so people can talk.
Clear lines of vision help too, as do frosted beer mugs, an equal
ratio of men and women, and for some reason, landscape paintings.
   ``She's Acting Single (I'm Drinkin' Doubles).''
   ``I'm Gonna Hire a Wino to Decorate Our Home.''
   ``What Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made a Loser Out of Me).''
   Country classics, all. But prior to hitting the honky-tonks,
Schaefer had always assumed that fast drinking and fast music went
hand-in-hand. ``The fact is, in moody, emotional settings, people
drink more,'' he says.
   ``Jazz is hot and melancholy. Country has very rich,
core-value-based lyrics. It reflects real-life dilemmas: `Your
Cheatin' Heart.' `Lucille.' `Blue Eyes Cryin' in the Rain.' We'd
hear these 20 or 30 times a night.''
   To gauge the effects of all that lyin' and cryin', graduate
students carried tape recorders into cowboy bars in Montana, where
Schaefer began his teaching career. The students staked out tables
near the jukebox. While Willie and Waylon wailed away in the
background, the young scientists tapped the table each time a
customer took a swig.
   At the University of Minnesota where Schaefer now works, he
corroborated his findings, teaming up with sociologist Richard
Sykes for the most comprehensive academic study of barroom behavior
ever done. For two years, students observed 4,500 people in 65
bars; along with drinking rates, they noted arrivals, departures,
prices and decor.
   The results: People slowed their drinking when the tempo reached
85 beats per minute. When it dipped below 60, they sped up.
   The moral: Mamas, don't let your babies grow up to be cowboys!
At the least, make sure they have a safe ride home after those long
beery nights with the mechanical bulls.
   For their next study, Schaefer and Sykes will zero in on people
guzzling in groups. Schaefer also hopes to check out the connection
between drinking and gambling, and between drinking and games such
as billiards or darts.

<HEAD>Supercomputer May Reduce Guesswork in Economic Forecasting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Minneapolis area will soon be at the
center of an attempt to use one of the world's fastest
supercomputers to dramatically reduce guesswork in economic
forecasting.
   If successful, the three-year project using a Cray Research Inc.
supercomputer could make businesses, consumers and workers less
vulnerable to blunders caused by faulty assumptions about the
nation's economy.
   In recent years, supercomputers have produced revolutionary
solutions to complex problems in engineering, chemistry, physics,
biology, meteorology and other disciplines.
   Computers have been less successful in economic forecasting, and
some economists argue that the problems are so complex that they
cannot simply through faster ``number crunching.''
   Arthur Rolnick, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank
of Minneapolis, said: ``In the long run, the supercomputer research
should mean a smoother-running economy with fewer government
mistakes. That's the objective. That's the hope.''
   The supercomputer project, to be conducted at the University of
Minnesota's Institute for Empirical Macroeconomics, will make
Minnesota a magnet for top economic thinkers from around the world.
   The institute already has applications from as far away as
England and Australia from scholars seeking one of several resident
fellowships to work with supercomputers, said David Runkle, the
institute's associate director.
   Ten to 15 economic researchers from the Minneapolis Fed and the
University of Minnesota will take part in the supercomputer
research, a study that will begin sometime this year.
   ``This is path-breaking work,'' said Daniel Newlon, economics
program director at the National Science Foundation, which is
reviewing an application to finance a large share of the
supercomputer research. The balance of the tab would be picked up
by the Minneapolis Fed.
   The Minneapolis-based Cray is donating free access to a
supercomputer.
   Newlon said the project promises to bring together public and
private economic forecasters, who make their living predicting the
future, with researchers who are on the frontier of using
supercomputers to expand economic thinking.
   ``What could emerge from this is a new generation of policy,
analytical and forecasting tools that will dramatically improve our
ability to understand and forecast the way the economy performs,''
he said.
   In computerized economic forecasting, a computer sifts through
millions of pieces of information about the behavior of thousands
of businesses and millions of consumers. In this process, the
computer tries to simulate changes in the economy in the face of
changing circumstances.
   Christopher Sims, director of the macroeconomics institute, said
the mammoth memory and rapid pace of a supercomputer will vastly
increase the number of pieces of information that a computer
simulation of the economy could store and manipulate.
   If all goes well, Cray and other supercomputer makers could find
a whole new market among economists and other social scientists.

   A flamboyant Saudi Arabian who promised to
donate $1 million for animal rights shelters in Minnesota was being
sought Tuesday by federal officials who say he entered the country
on a bogus visa.
   ``We're still looking for him,'' Thomas Schiltgen, acting
district director at the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service in St. Paul, said of Mohammad al-Fassi.
   Schiltgen declined further comment for fear of jeopardizing the
investigation.
   Mark Cangemi, assistant district director of investigations at
the INS office, said al-Fassi, the son of a sheik, arrived in Miami
in September 1989 claiming to represent the Saudi government on
official business.
   ``And that's not correct. He doesn't, he hasn't and he won't,''
Cangemi said.
   An arrest warrant has been issued for al-Fassi who, if caught,
will face deportation proceedings, Cangemi said.
   But it may be too late. Cangemi said al-Fassi has not been seen
in Minnesota since the middle of last week, and authorities say he
may have left the country.
   Following negotiations through his lawyer with the INS, al-Fassi
failed to turn himself in for questioning by April 13 as he had
agreed.
   An al-Fassi aide at the Radisson Hotel in Minneapolis, where
al-Fassi had been staying, refused comment Monday.
   Al-Fassi, 33, is the son of Sheik Shamsuddin al-Fassi, a Saudi
Arabian religious leader who underwent a kidney transplant at the
University of Minnesota Hospital last month. His entourage,
including his son, has been in Minneapolis for weeks.
   Last week, aides for the younger al-Fassi gave Minnesota animal
rights activist Lori Peterson a symbolic check for $1 million for
shelters. Peterson, a University of Minnesota law student, had
contacted al-Fassi after hearing that he loved animals.
   But last Wednesday, al-Fassi was charged in Florida's Dade
County with cruelty to animals, according to Joe Torregrosa, an
inspector with the Greater Miami Humane Society.
   The previous day, Torregrosa said, the society had found 32
cats, many sick and dehydrated, at al-Fassi's Miami Beach mansion.
   Peterson said Sunday that an aide to al-Fassi had given her
$1,000 in cash for adoption fees she paid at the Minneapolis Animal
Control pound on Saturday. In a cover story in People magazine in
May 1983, former aides to the al-Fassi family chronicled the
marriage and expensive divorce of the younger al-Fassi and his
lavish lifestyle in Europe, the Middle East, Florida and Los
Angeles.
   When al-Fassi was a teen-ager, his older sister was a mistress
of Prince Turki bin Abdul Aziz, brother of future Saudi King Fahd,
the story said. Al-Fassi became the royal prince's accountant.
   The press attache at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Washington,
D.C., did not return a call regarding al-Fassi. ``He is a private
citizen and we don't give out information on private citizens,''
said the attache's secretary.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Science scrutinises the brain
in action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Scientists have known for many years that specific parts of the human brain
are used for performing different types of thinking, but pin-pointing and
mapping these areas has proved difficult.
Now a team of researchers from AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and the University of
Minnesota Medical School has developed a new non-invasive technique which
enables them to safely and accurately 'see' the human brain working in a
normal conscious person.
The scanning technique, called Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (Bold) imaging,
detects increases in oxygenated blood flow to active areas of the brain.
Unlike the standard images of different types of brain tissue produced by
conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, the new method provides colour
images showing the precise locations of increased neuron activity.
'Our method adds an entirely new dimension to MRI images of the brain,
allowing us not just to see the brain, but to see it working,' said Bell
Laboratories biophysicist Seiji Ogawa. 'By imaging the brain in this way, we
can map the specific sites of certain mental activity.'

LEADING HEART SURGEON TO JOIN STAFF AT UCSD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Internationally acclaimed heart surgeon Stuart W. Jamieson will join the staff 
at UC San Diego Medical Center, a move that promises to vault the Hillcrest 
hospital to the forefront of heart and lung transplant research and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson, 42, has accepted the position of professor of surgery and chief of 
the division of cardiothoracic surgery at the UCSD, Dr. Gerard N. Burrow, the 
dean of UCSD's medical school, announced Thursday. Final academic committee 
approval of Jamieson's appointment is expected within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson has performed about 500 heart transplants and more than 50 heart-lung 
transplants -- a relatively new procedure first attempted only eight years ago. 
Jamieson, who trained with renowned heart surgeon Dr. Norman Shumway, claims a 
higher-than-average survival rate among his patients. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Jamieson is without question one of the leading cardiothoracic surgeons 
practicing today," Burrow said. "Under (his) leadership, the UCSD School of 
</P>
<P>
Medicine's division of cardiothoracic surgery will become one of the premier 
teaching and research programs in the country, and San Diego will become a 
national center for these specialized surgical procedures." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Michael Stringer, director of UCSD's Medical Center, said the recruitment 
of Jamieson "sends one more signal that this region is a biomedical center of 
national importance." 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson, who is now at the University of Minnesota, plans to move to San Diego 
with his team of transplant surgeons and nurses by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Becoming a Magnet 
</P>
<P>
In addition, two agencies closely connected to the developing body of research 
in heart-lung transplants will relocate to San Diego to follow the 
accomplishments of Jamieson and his team. The International Registry for Heart 
Transplantation, which keeps records on heart and heart-lung transplants 
throughout the world, and the editorial offices of the bimonthly Journal of 
Heart Transplantation will move their offices here, according to officials at 
UCSD Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
For all of Jamieson's rave reviews, he has known controversy. A UCSD 
spokeswoman said he recently resigned after two years as the head of the 
University of Minnesota's highly successful cardiothoracic surgery program 
after several months of turmoil over administrative and personnel matters. He 
remained on the medical school faculty.

UCSD Medical Center officials, however, do not seem to be worried about 
Jamieson's past problems, which were apparently the product of personality 
conflicts with some of the staff at the University of Minnesota, according to 
UCSD Medical Center spokeswoman Leslie Franz. "At no point was there a question 
over his capabilities as a surgeon or the success of his program," Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
There was "a great deal of discussion" among the administrators at UCSD Medical 
Center re 
</P>
<P>
garding Jamieson's turmoil-filled tenure at the University of Minnesota, Franz 
said, but no objections were raised to extending an invitation to Jamieson to 
come west. 
</P>
<P>
"The administration felt very comfortable that these were all very 
institutionally specific kinds of agreements and would not really have any 
impact on Dr. Jamieson's ability to do the job here," Franz said. 
</P>
<P>
"All surgeons somehow are controversial figures . . . and I think Dr. Jamieson 
is no exception," Burrow said. The academic program for heart surgery in 
Minnesota was "virtually nonexistent" at the time of Jamieson's arrival, he 
said. "Jamieson built the program from nothing, and he did it very quickly. 
It's hard to do that and not step on some people's toes, and I think that he 
simply stepped on too many toes, and I think he's aware of that. 
</P>
<P>
"We looked into this very carefully, and everyone we talked to has said he 
really is a brilliant surgeon." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looked at Jamieson 3 Months Ago 
</P>
<P>
Burrow said the administration decided within the past year to establish a 
major cardiovascular disease program and began specifically looking at the 
possibility of recruiting Jamieson about three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD Medical Center now operates the only kidney transplant center in San Diego 
County and plans to develop a pancreatic transplant program. 
</P>
<P>
"One of our key missions here is teaching and training, and in order to do it 
to our full capability, it's important that our department of surgery have a 
comprehensive transplant program," Franz said. "It's important to not only have 
a program like this so that young surgeons can be trained to do these 
procedures, but also a program where research is being done and the procedures 
can be perfected." 
</P>
<P>
Jamieson, born in Rhodesia and educated in London, took a fellowship at 
Stanford University in 1978 and helped develop the fledgling field of 
heart-lung transplantation along with pre-eminent heart surgeon Norman Shumway. 
In 1982, he was appointed director of Stanford's Heart-Lung Transplantation 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Jamieson took over as head of the University of Minnesota's heart 
surgery program, which quadrupled its surgical activity during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
UCSD's heart surgery program has been directed for the past few years by Dr. 
Pat Daily, who is also head of the heart surgery program at Sharp Memorial 
Hospital. Daily will continue to work for Sharp Memorial Hospital and will 
remain on the clinical faculty at UCSD. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp Memorial is the only hospital in San Diego where heart transplants are 
performed. No lung transplants have ever been performed in San Diego County.

<TEXT>     A three-year investigation, which already has cost the university $462,000
and will amount to about $600,000 before all bills are paid, unearthed the
violations.;    The probe was initiated only one month after the school
received three years' probation in March 1988 for basketball and football
violations that occurred primarily from 1982-86.;    Minnesota could have been
penalized more severely, but the NCAA was lenient because the school
cooperated and launched its own investigation.;    Minnesota could have lost
more scholarships, received postseason bans in all three sports and been kept
off television. Coaches could have been suspended or fired, and,
theoretically, the dreaded "death penalty" for repeat offenders could have
been imposed.;    The committee found that Holtz, who left Minnesota for Notre
Dame in November 1985, had given $250 cash to an athlete to pay for a course
that allowed the athlete to remain eligible for competition and that he gave
between $25 and $40 to Roselle Richardson to reimburse the former quarterback
for the loss of a wallet.;    "I made two errors of judgment," Holtz said in
South Bend, Ind. He said the payments were made for humanitarian reasons and
not to gain a competitive advantage.;    Minnesota's investigation alleged
that Holtz also gave $500 to former academic adviser LeRoy Gardner to give to
former receiver Jerry Keeble. Holtz denied that and the infractions committee
removed it from the list of violations.;    Most major infractions involved
Darville, former acting director of the university's Office of Minority and
Special Student Affairs.;    He was found to have given about $3,700 to
athletes from the OMSSA's special loan account, about $6,700 in benefits to 10
athletes through the manipulation of journal voucher payments and at least
$9,000 in other loans and payments to other athletes.;    The committee said
23 athletes from 1983-88 were involved with Darville, who subsequently was
convicted of three counts of theft by swindle and served prison time.;   
University officials have argued that they were unaware of Darville's
activities and the NCAA agreed. But the committee added that "the university's
failure to supervise and control the activities of (Darville) . . .
demonstrates a failure of institutional control.";    The school is expected
to accept the punishment without appeal.;    Basketball coach Clem Haskins was
censured mostly for violating recruiting and extra-benefits rules in the case
of Terrell Jackson, who transferred from Cincinnati in 1986 but later left
Minnesota.;    Haskins also was penalized for allowing a recruiting prospect
to be entertained in the university's Metrodome luxury suite during a football
game.;    Wrestling coach J Robinson was cited for exceeding the scholarship
limit in 1988-89 and for supervising informal off-season workouts between his
team and the wrestling club.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A heart-lung transplant surgeon at the
University of Minnesota filed a defamation lawsuit against a
newspaper's unidentified sources who said he ordered an operation on
a patient already considered dead.
   The suit, filed Tuesday in Hennepin County District Court,
centers on a story that appeared in the Star Tribune Aug. 2. The
story said the university was investigating an allegation that Dr.
Stuart Jamieson ordered an associate to perform a bypass operation
on a patient who was considered dead before the surgery began.
   Two days later, in a front page note to readers, the newspaper
said it regretted having published the account because the sources
for it did not have firsthand information.
   The suit is designed to enable Jamieson's attorneys to serve
subpoenas and take sworn statements from people at the University of
Minnesota Hospital who may be the sources or know who they are.
   The surgeon on the case, Dr. Jolene Kriett, has said the Aug. 2
report was wrong. She said Jamieson had not ordered the operation,
that it was not bypass surgery but the installation of a left
ventricular assist device to help the patient's failing heart and
that the patient was alive when she operated.
   Thomas Forsythe, a spokesman for Jamieson's lawyer Terence Fruth,
said Tuesday that if attorneys learn the identity of the sources
they would be named publicly as defendants in the suit.
   The suit alleges that the sources ``have and continue to cause
great damage'' to Jamieson's reputation. It asks that a court award
him unspecified damages.
   Jamieson was suspended as chief of cardiovascular surgery and
director of the university's Minnesota Heart and Lung Institute on
Aug. 3, and stripped of the two titles Sept. 19. Dr. David Brown,
dean of the medical school, said the decisions were based on
``interpersonal management'' failures. Jamieson still is authorized
to perform surgery.
   According to correspondence released with the suit, the newspaper
has turned down Fruth's request for the identity of the sources and
the university has declined to join Jamieson in asking the newspaper
to release the names.
   Joel Kramer, executive editor of the Star Tribune, said Tuesday
that the paper has no intention of revealing its sources, as a
matter of policy. Breaking a promise of confidentiality made to
sources could shut off future sources of information, he said.

<HL> Choose-a-School: Parents in Minnesota Are Getting to Send Kids Where They Like --- Some Institutions May Die Because the State's Money Goes Where Children Do --- Opportunity for Blacks, Too? </HL>

<TEXT>
   Until recently, Minnesota's schools were like those everywhere else -- virtually a monopoly. 
So you hated the education your child was getting? 
Too bad. 
There was nothing you could do about it, short of paying for a private school or moving. 

   Now, Minnesota wants to bust the public-school cartel. 
Many parents who don't like their children's schools have the opportunity to send them to another public school -- across town, in a neighboring suburb, or anywhere in the state. 
By 1991, the option will be open to all parents in the state. 

   It may sound innocent, but the choose-a-school movement is the most radical approach yet for improving the nation's public schools. 
Schools are bad, some critics say, because they have no incentive to improve. 
Force them to compete, and good schools will thrive. 

   In Minnesota, bad schools must either get better or wither, and possibly die. 
That's because competition carries a wicked sting for the losers. 
State aid of up to $3,600 follows each student to the new school, and the spurned school district loses the money. 

   Competition "is one of the powerful things going on in school reform," says Charles L. Glenn, a top official of the Massachusetts Department of Education. 
"The exciting potential of Minnesota is that it can break down not only racial barriers but also barriers between the affluent and non-affluent, city and town." 

   "We're just delighted," says Joyce Smeby, one of the first parents to take advantage of the option. 
She switched her son, Clayton James, to a school in suburban Robbinsdale from Minneapolis. 
Not only have his grades improved, she says, but he is captain of his high-school wrestling team. 
"C.J. just began to shine," Mrs. Smeby says. 

   Many states are watching the Minnesota experiment. 
Several, including Arizona, California, Colorado and New Jersey, have enacted or are considering similar choose-a-school laws. 

   But the idea also has stirred controversy. 
Some black leaders say the open-enrollment plan will drain kids -- and money -- from already struggling inner-city schools. 
Critics say that in the past, urban schools that lost kids (typically to suburban schools) just continued to decline. 
In Boston, where white students fled the public schools after desegregation was ordered, dropout rates among the remaining students, most of them black, soared. 
Average test scores for many grades remained below average. 

   The Minnesota Federation of Teachers has sued the state; its members fear job instability and seesawing school budgets. 
The Minnesota School Boards Association also has lobbied hard against the plan, urged on by small rural districts that fear oblivion if they lose too many kids to bigger districts with more resources. 

   "If kids transfer out of one school district to another, the kids left behind are worse off," says Yusef Mgeni, a director of the Northwest Area Foundation, a private philanthropic group in St. Paul. 
Adds Kwame MacDonald, head of the Inner City Youth League in St. Paul: "I don't think enough black kids will take advantage of it, and those that do will be the cream." 

   Critics also smell something in the air redolent of "vouchers," a controversial idea advocated to little avail by the Reagan administration. 
Under a voucher system, parents could choose not only among public schools, but also private and religious ones. 
States would have to pick up at least part of the tuition tab. 
Many educators fear vouchers would lead to racial segregation and destroy many public schools. 

   Supporters of Minnesota's program say its benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. 
Moves that would upset quotas in desegregation plans aren't allowed. 
More important, backers argue, there are early signs of success. 
Parents whose children have switched to other schools tend to be more satisfied with their education, state government surveys show. 
Some schools, meanwhile, are doing exactly what proponents of open enrollment predicted: adding courses and innovative programs to keep kids. 

   "The market forces are at work already," says Gov. Rudy Perpich, who calls the open-enrollment law he signed a week ago his most significant legislative feat. 
"You have better programs, and more districts cooperating to offer better programs." 

   The new law expands a pilot program that has been available since 1985. 
This year, 5,600 of the state's 700,000 public school students switched schools. 
Anywhere from 7,000 to 50,000 a year are expected to do so as the option is extended. 

   One of the program's most unusual features is that 11th and 12th graders can opt to take courses at college -- at the state's expense. 
Thus, high schools are forced to compete not only with other high schools, but also with colleges and other post-secondary schools, including those with religious affiliations. 

   That, in fact, is one of the complaints in the lawsuit filed by the Minnesota Federation of Teachers. 
It alleges that the option to enroll in private and religious colleges violates the constitutional separation of church and state. 
The U.S. district court in Minneapolis has ruled that the union is not entitled to bring such a complaint; the union is appealing that decision. 

   Still, the freedom to take college courses is popular with high-school students. 
About 4,000 of them took advantage of it this year. 
In fact, many carry a full load of college courses. 
Minneapolis's South High School alone has 200 students attending the University of Minnesota. 

   South is an inner-city school with strong academic traditions but not enough opportunity for 17-year-old Dimitri Russell. 
Mr. Russell played on the school's football team, but he got only mediocre grades. 
Also, he says, he was troubled by the sight of all the black students who were "having babies, dropping out and not making it." 
He says he needed a change. 

   So last year, he says, he quit football, drinking and smoking marijuana to take classes full time at the University of Minnesota. 
"I have this higher ideal of what I want to be," says Mr. Russell, who dreams of being an investment banker. 
"I don't want to be another black youth who's thrown his life away." 

   Under the state's program, Mr. Russell's credits count both toward his high school and college graduation. 
And the Minneapolis public school system pays his college tuition, which he says his parents otherwise couldn't afford. 

   High schools are fighting not to lose ambitious students and the state funding they attract. 
More are offering classes that allow students to earn college credits. 
St. Paul's Johnson High School offers such classes. 
There, one morning last week, 23 students circled their desks and plumbed themes of racism and reconciliation in Toni Morrison's novel "Sula." 

   Sheila Garland, an 18-year-old senior, already takes classes at the University of Minnesota. 
She says she would have taken a literature course there too if it weren't for the one at Johnson, for which she gets college credit. 
"This is my ideal of college," she says. 

   David A. Bennett, St. Paul's school superintendent, says city schools are improving because of the competitive environment. 
"If you don't have good powerful programs, you're going to lose the good students," he says. 

   School districts are also in danger of losing troubled kids unless officials tailor programs to keep them. 
A number of districts have lost students to the Area Learning Center, 90 miles northeast of Minneapolis in St. Cloud. 

   Some 70 students from outside the district attend a unique school here that lets them devise their own schedules and attend classes when they choose, within guidelines. 
The student body includes dropouts, teenage mothers, former drug users and those who had fallen behind in class. 

   Karie Conrad, 17, missed too many days at a high school in a nearby district and came to St. Cloud last fall. 
Miss Conrad, who says she had a drinking problem and often ran away from home, says she couldn't stand her old school. 
"I was in trouble in English, computers and history," she says. 
"I hated every one of my teachers." 

   "This place gets me to work harder because I know I'm on my own," she adds. 
The work is hard, but she's determined to graduate next year. 
"I get to go to the prom next year, and walk down the aisle to get my diploma -- that sounds real great." 

   Other schools are experimenting with similar programs. 
Nearby Elk River, which used to send some of its troubled students to Area Learning Center in St. Cloud, started its own alternative program this fall. 

   A number of schools are resisting the choose-a-school program, though. 
Some in the largely white suburbs of Minneapolis-St. Paul have refused to admit out-of-district students, blocking inner-city youths from attending. 
Under the open enrollment law, schools are free to elect not to accept students, though they can't discriminate among students. 
That's a sore point with critics. 
All schools are required to give bright students the opportunity to take college classes and troubled students the option to attend schools like Area Learning Center. 

   This year, 95 of the state's 435 school districts are allowing all their students to pick their schools. 
For next year, 153 districts, responsible for educating half the students in the state, have volunteered. 

   Joe Nathan, a consultant who advises Gov. Perpich on education, predicts nonparticipating districts will cave in eventually, in part because of the pressure of publicity. 
He and some others also believe the program could increase integration. 
Minnesota's largest cities already have desegregation programs. 
But white students typically attend suburban schools; minorities are stuck in struggling inner-city schools. 

   Sources close to Gov. Perpich say he is banking on the open enrollment plan to help head off any possible lawsuits seeking to force a broader desegregation program. 

   So far, Gov. Perpich says he is pleased with the program. 
"When I came to the legislature for my second term as a state representative {from upstate Hibbing}, I got into this school district -- it was St. Paul -- where the classes were like review courses for my kids," says Mr. Perpich. 
"I tried to get them out, and they said no way. . . . 
The following year, I had to move to the suburbs. 
It wasn't right." 

   That was 20 years ago. 
Mr. Perpich, his friends say, has a long memory.

   Skyscrapers will provide the backdrop instead
of cornstalks when Mikhail S. Gorbachev follows the footsteps of an
earlier Soviet leader into America's heartland.
   Gorbachev's six-hour stop in Minneapolis on Sunday to meet with
captains of industry and agriculture promises to bear little
resemblance to Nikita Khrushchev's 1959 visit to an Iowa farm.
   ``If you want to go to a place in the Midwest that is different
than New York, and you want to go to a place that is not a Rust
Belt center but a place on the cutting edge, it could be that
Minnesota is the place,'' said Thomas Noonan, a Russian studies
professor at the University of Minnesota.
   Fourteen Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the Twin
Cities area, more than in all but three other U.S. cities.
   One of those companies, Control Data Corp., has been such a
loyal trading partner with the Soviets that it once accepted
shotguns and rare books as payment for mainframe computers, said
Control Data spokesman Rick Berglund.
   Minnesota also is the base of one of the Soviet Union's biggest
trading partners in grain, giant Cargill Inc.
   As the home of many world-famous artists, composers,
playwrights, authors and musicians, plus two orchestras, two
museums and two theaters with international reputations, Minnesota
also has long cultivated its cultural image. The Twin Cities area
alone has more than 200 theater companies.
   ``Minnesota does represent an ideal American condition in so
many ways _ a hard-working and civic conscious population, high
standards of excellence in all endeavors, an openness to new ideas,
a sense of leadership,'' said Martin Friedman, director of the
Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.
   ``Minnesota is a national leader in the arts, a public
accustomed to quality _ open-minded, tolerant _ a public that
encourages invention,'' he said.
   Envelope magnate and best-selling author Harvey Mackay said
Gorbachev should find in Minnesota ``a sense of our good ol' work
ethic, strong individualism, that this is not just a visit to do
business with the Soviet Union to feather our nests.''
   ``You can't X-ray a person's bankbook here by looking at the cut
of their suit or the grille on their car,'' Mackay said.
   Much of what Minnesota is may not come as a surprise to Soviet
visitors because the state has been a leader in U.S.-Soviet
exchanges, said Liza Malott, program officer for the President's
U.S.-Soviet Exchange Initiative with the U.S. Information Agency.
   Exchange visits have involved Minnesota and Soviet artists,
actors, students, bicyclists, scuba divers and mushers.
   Minnesota and Soviet chemical dependency counselors discussed
cooperation on alcoholism rehabilitation research; the
International Diabetes Center in suburban Minneapolis is involved
in a cooperative venture to build a diabetes center in Moscow;
children's theater companies from Moscow and Minneapolis traded
performances; and a Minnesota-Soviet bicycle team is in the midst
of a Twin Cities-Soviet Union trek.
   Minneapolis-St. Paul has a sister-city relationship with
Novosibirsk, and Duluth is a sister city to Petrozavodsk.
   To stimulate more trade, Minnesota will open trade offices in
Moscow and Budapest this summer, said Richard Bohr, executive
director of the Minnesota Trade Office.
   William C. Norris, founder and chairman emeritus of Control
Data, said several Minnesota companies enjoy favored status in the
Soviet Union because they have demonstrated loyalty during rocky
political times.
   When the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in 1979, for
example, Norris lobbied against the trade embargo imposed by former
President Carter.
   ``It was a mistake,'' Norris said of the embargo. ``We have so
much to gain by tapping into their economy.''
   Karin Berkholtz, a Latvian member of the Governor's Commission
on Eastern Europe, said there are up to 12,350 Ukrainians,
Latvians, Estonians and Lithuanians living in Minnesota, some of
whom plan to demonstrate while Gorbachev is in town.
   Others in the state, however, may be oblivious to the Soviet
leader's visit. In southwestern Minnesota, for example, farmers may
be preoccupied with the grasshopper plague. The insects devoured
whole fields last year and are expected to be worse this year.
   But dairy farmer Tom Hirsch of rural Sleepy Eye is enthusiastic
about the upcoming visit.
   ``It's a great idea,'' Hirsch said. ``We've got the wholesome
rural life, and I think he's interested in that. I think he's
really a headsy person to come to Minnesota.''
   Hirsch said Gorbachev's visit should help Minnesota farmers sell
their crops to the Soviets. ``I think it will have some positive
(effects) on the trade negotiations,'' he said.
   One of the few similarities in the Soviet visits to Iowa and
Minnesota will be the hype.
   In Iowa, armed guards and an unruly press corps of 300 shadowed
Khrushchev. In Minnesota, Gov. Rudy Perpich has proclaimed the
Gorbachev visit ``bigger than the Super Bowl,'' which the Twin
Cities will host in 1992.
   ``No one really knows yet how this will develop,'' said Peter
Zidek, a supercomputer consultant from Apple Valley. ``But it's big
and it will open a lot of eyes to the Twin Cities.''

<TEXT>
   An American naturalist said today he was
``very lucky'' to survive an attack by a rhinoceros that charged
and badly wounded him while he was working in the jungle with his
5-year-old son.
   David Smith, 46, of St. Paul, Minn., was attacked Saturday while
on a research outing with his son Alex and local hunters.
   He told The Associated Press he hoped to return to his work soon
in southern Nepal. ``I was very lucky ... it (the rhinoceros) did
not open my abdominal cavity,'' he said. ``I hope to be out of the
hospital in a couple of weeks' time.''
   The University of Minnesota researcher was taken to the hospital
in Patan, south of Katmandu, by army helicopter.
   His wife, Francie Cuthbert-Smith, a bird specialist at the
University of Minnesota, said of her husband plans to return to
work: ``He is always happiest when he works in the Chitwan
jungles.''
   Smith set up camp at Sauraha village, near the Royal Chitwan
National Park, 75 miles southwest of Katmandu, early last month.
His wife and two sons _ Alex, 5; and a month-old baby _ joined him
March 28.
   The rhinoceros attacked while Smith was working in the jungle
about 160 feet from their living quarters. Smith said his party was
setting traps to catch small animals for research when the
rhinoceros appeared.
   ``We did not hear the sounds of any animal on that morning,''
Smith said. ``But all of sudden, I saw a rhino rushing towards (me)
... charging from a distance of about 15 feet.
   ``I turned around and started to run. But I realized that I
could not escape, so I used my hands ... pushing to keep the animal
away.
   ``It gored my chest,'' he said. ``The animal hit me about 12
times. Sometimes I was able to roll. I did (this so) ... the animal
would miss me.''
   Smith received four major wounds to his head, chest, leg and
buttocks.
   His wife said the main danger of such an attack comes from the
animal's razor-sharp lower teeth, not from its huge horn.
   ``He was extremely brave,'' said Dr. Hemanta Mishra of the King
Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation in Katmandu. ``He handled it
very coolly.''
   Mishra told the St. Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press Dispatch by
telephone that the rhinoceros had charged Smith's son. There was no
time to get the boy out of the way, so the father charged the rhino
to draw it away from his son, Mishra told the newspaper.
   Others put the boy into a tree, then threw stones and sticks at
the rhinoceros to drive it off, Mishra was quoted as saying.
   Smith was in the park conducting a small-mammal survey sponsored
by his university, the Smithsonian Institution and the nature
trust, Mishra said.
   The animal that attacked Smith was an extremely rare Great
Indian one-horned rhinoceros, which is found in sizable numbers
only in Chitwan Park and an animal preserve in India, said Peter
Jordan, an associate professor in the University of Minnesota's
Fisheries and Wildlife Department.

   Demonstration organizers say their efforts will be peaceful
during Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's visits to
Minneapolis-St. Paul and San Francisco, but city, state and federal
agencies are beefing up security anyway.
   Protest groups and police shared one problem: Gorbachev's
changing schedule.
   ``The bad part is it doesn't give us much time to plan how to
protect him,'' said Richard McDrew, agent in charge of the Secret
Service in San Francisco. ``The good part is it doesn't give a
potential assassin time to plan, either. If we don't know exactly
what he is going to do, neither does anyone else.''
   The flags of the Baltic republics will fly Sunday in Minneapolis
to show Gorbachev that emigrants in Minnesota support the push for
independence by the Soviet republics of Lithuania, Latvia and
Estonia.
   ``We will be demonstrating for Baltic independence, not against
Gorbachev coming here,'' said Karin Berkholtz, a Latvian-American
member of the Governor's Commission on Eastern Europe.
   ``Our ultimate goal is to show Gorbachev that `Everywhere you go
there will be people who feel the same way that they do back in
Eastern Europe,''' Berkholtz said.
   Between 500 and 1,000 people of Eastern European descent are
expected to participate in non-disruptive demonstrations during the
six hours the Soviet president is in Minnesota.
   After Minnesota, Gorbachev will go on to San Francisco, and then
leave the United States on Monday.
   The planned Minnesota demonstrations ``are not meant to offend
anyone,'' said Walter Anastas, the Ukrainian representative on the
Governor's Commission on Eastern Europe. ``We want to express to
Gorbachev and to our fellow Minnesotans that we have concerns about
the human right of national self-determination.''
   ``We're planning a peaceful demonstration, in keeping with the
peaceful revolution in the Baltics,'' said Joe Sidas, spokesman for
the Baltic Alliance in San Francisco.
   Security will be tight.
   Sharpshooters will be posted on buildings at every location the
Gorbachevs will visit in California. Dozens of Highway Patrol cars
will line the 35 miles between San Francisco and Stanford
University during their drive Monday to the campus.
   McDrew said the Secret Service will have hundreds of agents in
San Francisco from around the country leading a security operation
that will involve thousands of officers.
   The San Francisco Police Department will have 1,775 officers and
the Stanford University police will have 30 officers, bolstered by
Santa Clara County sheriff's deputies, to deal with demonstrations
planned by Armenians, Estonians, Lithuanians, Latvians, Soviet Jews
and Eritreans from Ethiopia.
   Minnesota State Patrol Chief Kevin Kittridge said tentative
plans are for 150 to 200 state troopers from around the state to be
brought into St. Paul for Sunday's visit. ``We've canceled
everyone's day off,'' he said.
   But in Minneapolis, police Sgt. Keith Oldfather said there's
been no blanket prohibition on officers taking a scheduled day off
Sunday and that he doesn't expect one, although he said plans are
not firm because Gorbachev's itinerary is not set.
   ``It's very likely we won't know until the last minute or last
day exactly what we are going to do, in which case all our planning
and worrying was for nothing,'' said Minneapolis police Lt. Jim
Heimerl.
   If Gorbachev ventures into crowds to talk with protesters, as he
has in the past, it will present a risk, said McDrew, but one that
the Secret Service is preparing to handle.
   ``Extemporaneous visits and unplanned movements are things we've
handled before,'' he said. ``It's pretty difficult sometimes. John
F. Kennedy didn't want a bulletproof top on his car in Dallas. We'd
like to have the best security at all times, but we have to adapt
to the circumstances.''

<HEAD>University Heart Transplant Surgeon Ousted As Division Head</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A world-renowned heart and lung transplant
surgeon has been ousted from his position as head of the division
of cardiovascular surgery at the University of Minnesota Hospital.
   Dr. Stuart Jamieson was relieved temporarily in early August
during an investigation into assorted allegations, among them a
never-proven claim that he or one of his assistants left a forceps
inside a patient's chest and then did not inform the patient of the
fact.
   In a brief news release offering no explanations, the hospital
said Friday that ``after considerable thought and external
consultation, a decision has now been made not to reinstate Dr.
Jamieson'' to his leadership post. It said he continues as a
professor of surgery and a member of the hospital staff.
   The August announcement came after the Star Tribune reported
that the university was investigating Jamieson in connection with
two operations. The newspaper later said its account of one of the
operations should not have been published because it was based on
sources who lacked firsthand knowledge.
   The St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch last month quoted sources as
saying the move for Jamieson, 40, to temporarily step aside was
partly the result of a sharp dispute over the surgeon's personality
and aggressive management style.
   The announcement Friday of surgery department chairman Dr. John
Najarian's decision not to reinstate Jamieson capped weeks of
tension at the hospital over the matter.
   Hospital spokeswoman Sally Howard said that because the decision
involves confidential personnel matters, the reasons for Jamieson's
ouster ``probably will never be discussed in a public forum.''
   There was no comment from Jamieson and Najarian; both have
failed to return repeated phone calls from reporters since the Aug.
2 announcement.
   Jamieson was hired by Najarian in January 1986 from Stanford
University Medical Center in Palo Alto, Calif., where he was a
protege of famed heart surgeon and University of Minnesota alumni
Dr. Norman Shumway. Shumway's daughter, a newly trained heart
surgeon, recently joined Jamieson's staff.
   ``I thought he was the best cardiac surgeon available in the
United States. He was our No. 1 choice,'' Najarian said in May
1986, soon after Jamieson's arrival.
   At the time, Jamieson was president-elect of the International
Society for Heart Transplantation. He is among a handful of
surgeons in the world trained in combined heart-lung transplants,
and has performed seven heart-lung transplants at Minnesota.
   There are two other heart transplant surgeons among the five
cardiac surgeons on the university staff, but Jamieson is the most
experienced and the only one who has done heart-lung and single-and
double-lung transplants.
   Dr. Edward Humphrey, chief of heart surgery at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center at Fort Snelling, will serve as
interim head of cardiovascular and thoracic surgery until a
permanent head is appointed, the statement said.
   University Vice President for Health Sciences Dr. Neal Vanselow
said he reviewed Najarian's action and supports it.
   ``These are tough and gray areas where anyone could make a
mistake, but I feel reasonably comfortable about this one,''
Vanselow said.

   Sometimes I tease animals. 

   Also, I feel useless at times, and I occasionally feel that I'm about to go to pieces. 
Once in a while, I feel like smashing things. 
Is that weird? 

   Only the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory can say for sure. 
The MMPI, the world's most widely used psychological assessment test, sorts through responses to 567 such statements and determines, among other things, just how paranoid, depressed, manic or anxious a person really is. 
The MMPI even thinks it can tell if you're lying: Only a flaming liar would respond "true" to the statement "I never tell a lie." 

   Despite the test's reputation as an uncannily accurate device for detecting people's peculiarities, however, users thought the MMPI had some quirks of its own. 
So in 1982, the University of Minnesota Press, publisher of the test, appointed four psychologists to examine its baby. 
Their diagnosis: MMPI was dated, sexist and excessively preoccupied with sexual adjustment, bodily functions and religiosity. 

   Last month, an updated and supposedly gender-neutral version of MMPI was released, with more than 250 true/false statements added, deleted or changed. 
Some of the alterations are simply linguistic, omitting, for example, the word "his" as it is used to apply to both sexes. 
But the latest edition also includes new items intended to sniff out such aberrant behavior as drug abuse, eating disorders and Type A personality, which weren't in vogue when the test was first published in 1942. 

   People whom the original MMPI showed to have personality problems, however, won't find themselves ignored (and certainly not cured) by MMPI-2. 
The 10 clinical scales by which MMPI measures a personality are essentially unchanged by the new statements. 

   But now instead of saying, "A person should try to understand his dreams and be guided by or take warning from them," the statement seeking a response reads, "People should try to understand their dreams . . ." 
Sexism in language, farewell. 
The statement "I used to like drop-the-handkerchief" has been removed, too. 
Anachronisms, bye-bye. 
New statements to which test subjects are asked to respond include: "Others tell me I eat too fast." 
"I work very long hours even though my job doesn't require this." 
And, "Once a week or more I get high or drunk." 
Welcome to the 1980s. 

   With statements that seem so transparent, disguising one's true personality might appear to be a breeze for the would-be test-thwarter. 
But a given response doesn't necessarily mean what it seems to mean. 
And the dishonest test-taker tends to be tripped up by the lie scale. 
Actually, MMPI contains three validity scales, intended to measure whether subjects are trying to appear superior or pathetic or if they're responding carelessly. 

   MMPI is widely used by psychologists and psychiatrists in clinical settings, but it has become increasingly popular as a job-screening tool, too, especially in high-risk, high-stress occupations like firefighting, commercial flying and operating nuclear reactors. 
"The folks you don't want freaking out during an emergency," says Val Arnold, a vice president of Personnel Decisions Inc., an industrial-organizational psychology consulting firm in Minneapolis. 
The brilliant thing about the test, Mr. Arnold says, is that it not only detects abnormality, but it also suggests "which way a person is going to crack." 

   As MMPI over the years came to be used more and more in employment, academia and the military, its publishers got a bit squeamish about items on such delicate matters as excreta and sexual preference. 
"People resented their being asked about bowel and bladder functions in job screening," says Beverly Kaemmer, MMPI manager at the University of Minnesota Press. 
"And the scales functioned well without those items." 

   Furthermore, "the test overidentified conservative Christians as having mental problems," Mr. Arnold says. 
"If you believe in God and you believe in miracles, there's nothing particularly crazy about that. 
But if it's not part of your religious faith, you might be suffering delusions." 

   The original MMPI was developed during the 1930s and 1940s by a psychologist and a psychiatrist looking for an efficient way to diagnose mental problems. 
But because their research was begun during the Depression, the developers had a limited budget for assembling the so-called normative population, against which deviant behavior would be measured. 
They eventually used 700 rural Minnesotans, most of them recruited while visiting sick friends or relatives at the University of Minnesota hospital. 
The typical test subject was a 35-year-old with an eighth-grade education; most of the women were housewives, the men were skilled or semiskilled laborers. 

   The new normative population is larger -- about 2,600 people -- and encompasses a wider range of socioeconomic groups from seven communities across the nation. 
Their responses are then compared with those of addicts, alcoholics, people in chronic pain and other troubled types. 

   "Here's a group that rapes, murders and steals," says Mr. Arnold. 
"And here's a group that goes to church. 
You start to see that there are very definite differences in the way they answer questions like, 'I like tall women,' or 'I like a shower rather than a bath.' But I think it's a mystery to the people who developed it why it works." 
In other words, if pyromaniacs as a group prefer showers and tall women, among other things, and you do too, maybe, just maybe, you ought not to work for the fire department. 

   MMPI's publishers say the test shouldn't be used alone to diagnose psychological problems or in hiring; it should be given in conjunction with other tests. 
But if a job candidate does poorly on MMPI, that will at the very least provide good grist for a job interview. 
"The test might say you're a raving lunatic and then we'd interview you to see if it's true," says Mr. Arnold. 

   Legal challenges from hapless job seekers who find discrimination and privacy-invasion in the test haven't succeeded in court either, according to James Butcher, a professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota and one of the psychologists who oversaw the recent sprucing up of MMPI. Firefighters in Jersey City, N.J., lost a suit opposing MMPI because, the judge said, a municipality should be able to use whatever means it has at its disposal to ensure the mental stability of workers in high-stress jobs. 

   Mr. Butcher thinks the judge has a point. 
"The test does sort people out," he says. 
"Every time I'm flying in the back of a 747, I'm happy to know that the guy in front isn't planning to dive the plane into the sea."

   An educator withdrew his name from
consideration for president of North Dakota State University on
Friday night after admitting he lifted part of a presentation for
the job from a magazine article.
   Richard Sauer, acting president of the University of Minnesota,
conceded he failed to credit the article in the speech given at
NDSU in Fargo, N.D., on Monday but said he had not been trying to
claim authorship.
   He called William C. Nelson, chairman of the NDSU presidential
search committee, to say he was withdrawing from consideration,
Nelson said.
   ``I think he felt the controversy had gotten to the point that
it would make it difficult for him to be an effective president at
NDSU,'' Nelson said. ``I urged him to stay, to keep his name in for
the running for the presidency. But I was unsuccessful in changing
his mind.''
   The 48-year-old Sauer, vice president of agriculture, forestry
and home economics at University of Minnesota before becoming
interim president in March, did not immediately return a telephone
call Friday night.
   At issue was a speech to several hundred professors, faculty and
students at an open forum for the NDSU presidential candidate.
   NDSU history professor Larry R. Peterson said he recognized part
of the speech as being nearly identical to points made by Cornell
University President Frank Rhodes in a guest column in the May 22,
1985, edition of the Chronicle of Higher Education. He said he had
saved a copy because he was impressed with Rhodes' list of what
graduates should get out of a college education.
   ``At first, I just couldn't believe it,'' Peterson said. ``It's
insulting, I guess. It's like here's someone trying to put
something over on us.''
   He said he forwarded the information to the presidential search
committee.
   But the committee on Thursday recommended Sauer and three other
to the North Dakota Board of Higher Education after accepting
Sauer's explanation that he accidentally omitted the credit in
trying to shorten his speech, Nelson said.
   ``There wasn't any question that he did use a small portion of
that (speech),'' Nelson said. ``But the other factor is the intent.
The majority of the committee felt there was no intent on his
behalf.''
   ``I don't normally make citations in oral presentations of that
nature because they interrupt the flow of the talk. But I wasn't
trying to claim any credit for authorship,'' Sauer said earlier in
explaining the speech.
   ``It was probably very close to verbatim,'' he said.
   University of Minnesota regents chairman David Lebedoff said
Friday night he could not comment because he knew nothing about the
situation. Sauer became acting president after Kenneth Keller
resigned in a controversy over spending.
   Nelson said the North Dakota Board of Higher Education plans to
meet May 22-23 to make its decision. The school's former president,
Laurel Loftsgard, died last year.

   The uneducated and poor still face the greatest
threat from heart disease, although people of all social classes
have reduced their risk equally in recent years, a study suggests.
   University of Minnesota epidemiologist Wayne Rosamond, who
co-authored the study, presented the findings Thursday during the
American Heart Association's annual conference on heart disease
epidemiology, the study of disease among population groups.
   The results indicate lower socioeconomic classes ``obviously
have not caught up with the relative advantages of being more
educated and more affluent,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor, a
University of California, San Diego, researcher and chairwoman of
the association's epidemiology council.
   The Minnesota researchers examined heart disease risk factors
and socioeconomic status _ as reflected by education and family
income levels _ of 3,816 randomly selected adults in the
Minneapolis-St. Paul area in 1980-82, and of another 4,641 in
1985-87.
   Although people got slightly fatter during the study period,
those in each socioeconomic group also made statistically
equivalent reductions in blood cholesterol, blood pressure and
cigarette smoking _ major factors in heart disease.
   ``But the difference between the highly educated and less
educated is not narrowing at all,'' said Dr. Russell Luepker, chief
author of the study and a professor of epidemiology and medicine at
Minnesota.
   Lower socioeconomic groups still have the highest levels of
blood pressure, blood cholesterol, cigarette smoking and obesity,
he said.
   ``If we're going to continue to make progress, we have to target
those groups who have been least affected by improvements in
society,'' he said ``Those with lower income have higher risk and
also are the least educated. They are not making the higher level
of progress you would hope for.''
   The study found, for example, that the proportion of men who
smoked fell from 44 percent to 41 percent among those who didn't
finish high school, dropped from 40 percent to 33 percent among
those with some college, and declined from 25 percent to 21 percent
among men who graduated college.
   Another example: The proportion of women with at least one risk
factor for heart disease fell from 65 percent to 54 percent among
those who didn't finish high school, declined from 57 percent to 46
percent among those with some college, and dropped from 43 percent
to 34 percent among those who got a college degree.
   While the study found an increased risk of heart disease was
related to both low education and low family income, the link with
low education was stronger, Rosamond said.
   ``More educated people are taking better care of themselves and
have less risk because of it,'' Luepker said. ``They're the people
who are exercising, quitting smoking and eating healthier diets.''
   The only exception to the link between disease risk and social
status was that men in higher classes tended to have higher
cholesterol levels that men in lower classes, Rosamond said.

   Walter A. O'Meara, chief of planning for the
Office of Strategic Services during World War II and media director
for Adlai Stevenson's 1952 presidential campaign, has died at age
92.
   O'Meara died Friday in Cohasset, Mass., said his daughter, Ellen
Woolf.
   Born in Minneapolis, O'Meara left an advertising career in 1950
to write novels and non-fiction.
   His best-known books include ``Grand Portage,'' a novel based on
the life of fur trader Daniel Harmon, and ``Minnesota Gothic,'' a
mystery novel about a family living in an old Victorian house.
   O' Meara first book, ``The Trees Went Forth,'' told the story of

the University of Wisconsin at Madison with a journalism degree in
1920.
   During World War II, he oversaw planning for the OSS, the
predecessor of the CIA, and was head of the information department
for the Office of Price Administration. He handled press relations
for Adlai Stevenson's losing 1952 presidential campaign.
   After working at the Duluth News Tribune for several years,
O'Meara joined the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency in

   Lung Cancer
   Risk Linked

   Scientists said they are on the trail of a gene that
increases the risk of developing lung cancer, particularly
for smokers.
   If the gene can be found, tests could be developed that
could tell which smokers are likely to die of lung cancer
early in life and which might resist the disease until late
in life or never contract it.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Two newly published research reports are the firmest proof
yet that a susceptibility to lung cancer can be passed from
generation to generation, and may explain why lung cancer is
relatively common in some families.
   "Cigarette smoking is unequivocally the most important
reason why most Americans are struck with this disease," said
Neil E. Caporaso, a researcher at the National Cancer
Institute in Bethesda, Md. and lead investigator of one of
the studies. "Yet, scientists have puzzled over why some
smokers get cancer and others don't, why only one in eight
smokers gets the disease. Genetic factors may explain why."
   The researchers haven't identified the culprit gene, nor
do they expect to find it immediately. But their reports
shine a bright light as to where other scientists should
look, and are expected to trigger a race among molecular
biologists to find a lung-cancer susceptibility gene as part
of the world-wide effort to map the human genome, the
collection of all human genes.
   Lawyers on both sides of the tobacco liability issue
predicted that the new research on the origins of cancer
could have an impact on tobacco liability suits. But both
sides said that the new findings could help their arguments.
   Tobacco manufacturers have routinely argued that
scientists have failed to prove a direct biological
connection between smoking and lung cancer. Some attorneys
who represent tobacco companies suggested that new evidence
that some people are genetically predisposed to developing
cancer will further bolster their case by casting further
doubt on the origins of disease.
   But Marc Edell, a New Jersey attorney who represents
plaintiffs in tobacco liability suits, said the findings
won't be damaging to plaintiffs. If anything, Mr. Edell said,
the notion that some consumers might be more vulnerable to
disease could mean that manufacturers would be required to
add tougher labels to packages and advertising. "This would
make it more important than ever for manufacturers to warn
consumers specifically about the risks they face," he said.
   NCI officials are concerned that the findings may lead
some to believe it may be safe for people without the gene to
smoke. They note cigarette smoking also causes heart disease
and emphysema.
   "It's our belief that everyone who smokes has some risk of
cancer," says Curt Harris, chief of the NCI's laboratory of
human carcinogenesis. "We think the gene research will point
out who has a higher, perhaps even much higher, risk than
normal."
   The new research appears in the most recent issue of the
Journal of the National Cancer Institute. In one report,
scientists at Louisiana State University Medical Center in
New Orleans and at Albert Einstein College in New York say
that by studying the occurrence of lung cancer in over 300
southern Louisiana families, they found that the disease
struck within the families as if due to a single inheritable
gene.
   The researchers, led by Thomas A. Sellers, compared the
disease pattern in three generations of these families with
the random rate of lung cancer in a similar number of
Louisiana families. The cancer families had been gathered
between 1976 and 1979, and in 1981, Mr. Sellers, a graduate
student, began analyzing the disease using new computer
programs.
   The analysis strongly suggests that inheriting a
particular gene sharply raises the likelihood of getting lung
cancer for smokers and nonsmokers. The study found that a
person who inherits two copies of the culprit gene -- one
from each parent -- and doesn't smoke has a 14% chance of
getting the cancer by age 50. That risk jumps to 27% by age
50 if the person was a heavy smoker.
   Inheriting just one copy of the gene, a more likely
occurrence for most people, raises the risk of cancer, but
mostly for cigarette smokers. At age 50, a nonsmoker with one
copy of the gene has practically no risk at all. But for a
heavy smoker that risk rises to 5% by age 50, to 16% by age
60, and to 25% by age 70. By age 60 a heavy smoker with one
copy of the gene is 6.5 times more likely to get lung cancer
than a heavy smoker without the gene.
   George E. Bonney, a geneticist at Howard University in
Washington and an expert in analyzing gene patterns in
families, writes in an accompanying article in the NCI
journal that the sample size of the study is "so large" that
findings are "unlikely to be false." Mr. Sellers, now at
University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, says researchers are
collecting blood from family members in an effort to locate
the offending gene in the families' DNA, or genetic material.
   In a second report in the same issue of the journal,
scientists at the cancer institute point to a particular gene
as the possible culprit. In a study led by Mr. Caporaso,
researchers say they found that some people inherit a genetic
trait that makes them more likely to activate cancer-causing
chemicals contained in cigarette smoke.
   The scientists found that people who quickly metabolize,
or process, a blood pressure drug called debrisoquine seem to
have a six times higher risk of lung cancer than people who
process the drug slowly. In 1984, some scientists suggested
that the drug might provide a clue to inheriting a
susceptibility to cancer when they found that certain people
who took the drug passed out, meaning large amounts of
processed drug reached the brain. By studying numerous
families, the researchers found that the "fast metabolizing"
characteristic occurred as if due to a single inherited gene.
   The NCI scientists compared the occurrence of this
metabolizing trait in lung cancer patients with its
occurrence in a random sample of smokers. Their analysis
showed a strong link between the trait, lung cancer and
smoking. Scientists already know that a particular enzyme is
responsible for processing the drug, and that the enzyme is
produced in cells by a gene located on chromosome 22. There
are 23 matched pairs of chromosomes in every cell.
   "What we think is either this gene or a gene located near
it on chromosome 22 also processes one of the many
carcinogens contained in cigarette smoke," Mr. Caporaso says.
   Mr. Harris of the NCI says that scientists in Switzerland
are working on a test that could detect the presence of the
enzyme gene in people's blood. "A smoker who has this gene
might want to take periodic chest X-rays," he says. "Lung
cancer is treatable if caught early."
   Mr. Harris says the latest gene finding suggests that as
many as five or 10 genes are involved in the development of
lung cancer. Some of the genes may be inherited, and some may
be damaged, perhaps by chemicals in cigarette smoke.

   Businesses looking to expand in congested
cities like New York, Chicago and San Francisco usually turn to
skyscrapers or the suburbs, but a group of engineers and architects
says a better solution lies just below the surface.
   Building underground has the potential to provide millions of
square feet of clean, energy-efficient space in the nation's major
cities, according to the American Underground-Space Association.
   ``Underground has the benefit of allowing greater density in
urban areas and mitigating the need for sprawl,'' Susan Nelson, the
group's executive director, said in a recent interview. ``You save
land doing that, you save energy and transportation, and you just
create a more vital city center.''
   Getting that message across, however, has proven to be difficult
for the Minneapolis-based, non-profit organization.
   ``Visibility really is a major problem with underground
construction,'' Nelson acknowledges. ``I think you'll find that many
architects aren't interested in it because they like to make a
statement. It's hard to make a statement underground.''
   Since it was founded in 1976, the association has been touting
the benefits of underground facilities to business and government
leaders and helping exchange information among professionals
interested in the idea. The group now has 400 members in 39 states
and 25 countries.
   Subterranean buildings are ideal for researchers and
industrialists who need clean work environments because few airborne
pollutants can invade the underground, Nelson said.
   They also save energy because the ground offers protection from
cold winter winds and the hot summer sun, but energy concerns have
waned along with the price of oil in recent years.
   ``I think there was more activity in the late '70s when we were
more concerned about energy,'' Nelson said. ``I think it's a matter
of not being presented with the idea.''
   To help remedy that, the association recently published a book
titled ``Groundworks'' featuring 15 underground projects built in
North America during the 1980s.
   They include the Law Library Addition at the University of
Michigan in Ann Arbor, all three stories of which are below ground;
the Smithsonian Institution Museum Complex in Washington, D.C.,
which is 96 percent below ground and extends 60 feet below the
surface; and the Civil and Mineral Engineering Building at the
University of Minnesota, which is 95 percent below ground and goes
down 110 feet.
   Also featured is the Minnesota Correctional Facility, a
maximum-security prison in suburban Oak Park Heights.
   The five-story prison's exterior walls are almost completely
earth-covered, minimizing its visibility and providing another
barrier to escape, said Assistant Warden James Crawford.
   Crawford said he has heard no complaints from prisoners or
employees at the 7-year-old facility.
   ``They have access to the outside,'' he said of the 400 inmates.
``Of course, all of their cells have windows'' facing a central
courtyard.
   Not surprisingly, Nelson's own office is located in a so-called
earth-bermed building near downtown Minneapolis. The four-story
building's first floor is built below ground, and earth has been
built up to cover the second and third floors on two sides of the
building.
   Misconceptions are holding back more widespread use of
underground space, Nelson contends.
   ``There is the myth out there that it is very expensive,'' she
said. Cost depends on the difficulty of digging in a particular
spot, and in some places it's inexpensive, she said.
   ``There's also a psychological aspect,'' Nelson said. ``I think
they feel they will be claustrophobic. They don't like the idea of
no windows. But you can work in a skyscraper and never walk past a
window during the day.
   ``I think the expectation of being underground is quite different
from the reality. People who work underground generally like it.''

<HEAD>Scientist: Place Data From Holocaust Experiments Off Limits</HEAD>

   Nazi experiments on concentration camp
prisoners were so unethical that scientists should ignore the
results, a professor from West Germany argued Thursday at an
international conference.
   ``One should not touch the scientific data from these people,''
Dr. Benno Muller-Hill of the University of Cologne's Institute of
Genetics told the conference on the meaning of the Holocaust for
bioethics.
   ``The notion of taboo is very, very important. To set up a taboo
is not a scientific decision. This is a value decision. I would
strongly advise setting up a taboo not to use any of this data,''
Muller-Hill said.
   While scientists should be asked their opinions on what should
be made taboo in research, Muller-Hill said ultimately the decision
should be made by the public.
   George Annas of Boston University School of Law and Public
Health, also on the panel at the University of Minnesota
conference, agreed that the data should not be used. He cautioned
about similarities between Nazi research and research now being
conducted in the United States without prior consideration of
ethical arguments.
   ``The only time we take medical ethics seriously in the United
States is when it doesn't matter, when the scientists can do their
research anyway,'' Annas maintained. ``The main view in science is
to do the research first and worry about the ethics later.''
   Annas predicted that within a decade scientists will have the
capability of testing an embryo and determining all of its genetic
defects as people decide whether to continue pregnancies.
   Not only will tests be able to determine what diseases a person
will be born with, but also what diseases a person may develop
later in life, he said.
   ``Once we're able to do genetic manipulation at the embryo
level, we'll literally be able to manufacture the children we
want,'' Annas said.
   Such capabilities must not be pursued in an ethical vacuum, he
stressed.
   ``I'd like to suggest that America's last frontier is morality,
ethics. We have to decide what direction we're going. Our goal
seems to be an antiseptic world in which we'll all live to be
100,'' Annas said.
   ``We are tarred by the Nazis. We can't get out of it until we
confront it. That really is our challenge,'' he added. ``I hope
this conference will provide impetus to some scientists to take
values seriously.''
   But Richard King, a professor with the University of Minnesota's
Institute of Human Genetics, drew a distinction between Nazi
research and what is being done in the United States.
   ``Many of the processes that went on in Germany are similar to
what we consider ethical medical practice in the United States,''
King said. ``The major difference is that all of the genetic
community deals with genetics from an individual standpoint. We try
to use our information to educate individuals so they can make
decisions. We do not deal with genetics on a population scale.''
   King said he believes current research should include a very
strong ethical component but not that ethical decisions should be
made before the research is done.
   Arthur Caplan, director of the University of Minnesota Center
for Biomedical Ethics, said Wednesday that renowned scientists
enabled the Third Reich to exterminate millions of people in World
War II by helping develop gas chambers and by propounding racist
theories.
   Scientists, he said, ``were not dragged kicking and screaming
and protesting'' into Nazism.
