The eerie lights go up, the spooky stage smoke clears and what looks like a 
seven-foot-tall ghost of Marley appears wearing stunning fluorescent ghoul 
makeup and cobwebby grave clothes. It's clear that this "Christmas Carol" is 
going to be an exciting blend of spectacle, special effects and surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Local director Tim Glasby has mounted an ambitious version of the Charles 
Dickens classic in the intimate 100-seat Center Stage Theater. The 21-member 
cast, who play 40 characters, is headed by Equity actors John Fink as Marley 
and Richard Stretchberry as Ebenezer Scrooge. 
</P>
<P>
The massive set, based on four rotating wagons, features a curved bridge large 
enough to hold a phalanx of carolers in Victorian dress who sing between 
scenes. We sympathize with the poor Cratchit family, root for Tiny Tim and 
follow the metamorphosis of that archetypal miser Scrooge, who stomps and 
humbugs his way through rapidly shifting scenes -- from Christmas Past, 
Christmas Present and Christmas Future. 
</P>
<P>
The first scenes reveal that Ebenezer was a solitary, neglected child who grew 
up to be a lonely, isolated man, insulated from all human feeling. When 
Christmas Future reveals his unmourned death, Scrooge suffers profound anguish 
over his miserly years and feels a genuine need to make something of what is 
left of his life. 
</P>
<P>
The test of an actor is here. Scrooge must change in one moment from curmudgeon 
to jovial gift-bringer. Stretchberry is up to it. He builds the change slowly 
with superb control. When we finally see him hopping and singing with joy on 
Christmas morning, we can believe this. And we believe that Scrooge is a symbol 
of Everyman and that every man harbors a streak of Scrooge. 
</P>
<P>
This is a good holiday show for the whole family. The children will love the 
special effects. One little girl at the performance I attended turned to her 
friend afterward and said, "It was perfect."

FT  22 DEC 92 / Arts: A Christmas Carol - American theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
At his public readings in America, during his Christmas tour of 1867,
Charles Dickens read A Christmas Carol to sell-out audiences (Longfellow
heard him in Boston). By then Dickens was using the story as a sentimental
warm-up for grimmer excerpts that followed.
Knowing this makes all the more commendable a remarkable presentation on
Broadway by the British actor Patrick Stewart, who is packing the house not
with a reading but a performance of Christmas Carol.
A veteran of the Royal Shakespeare Company, Stewart has become an American
pop hero as the starship captain (played like a Shakespearian king) in
television's Star Trek: The Next Generation. But when he enters he is simply
dressed in a nondescript brown suit, making no attempt to be like Dickens or
even of the period.
He snatches up the red-bound volume like a storyteller's trophy and begins
with 'Marley was dead' standing at a lectern. The only other props, all
painted brown, are a high desk and stool, a Windsor chair and a table that
also serves as a four-poster bed. No sooner has the listener's imagination
soared to fogbound City courtyards than, in a flash, the actor is across the
stage to Scrooge's counting-house.
This is when the magic begins. In a series of apparitions as life-like as
Scrooge's Spirits, Stewart proceeds to portray, in voice and manner, all 40
characters in a sort of one-man Nicholas Nickleby. There is nothing easy in
Scrooge's gradual transformation from 'Bah] Humbug]' to a man frightened to
the core by recognition of himself. Nor are there any minor characters, for
each in turn gives weight to the whole.
Stewart has a facility for portraying women, in voice and gesture - the
bustle of Mrs Cratchit at dinner or the capacious Mrs Fezziwig and her three
daughters entering the ball. This event, a tour de force of whirling hands
over hands and steps in stately formations, creates the dizzying effect of
20 couples.
With no sets, lighting designer Fred Allen, expands and contracts space. By
giving a sense of architecture to an empty stage, he uses light to convey
cold city streets or country lanes and, in an instant, returns the action to
Scrooge's cramped upstairs bedroom. The Ghost of Christmas Present arrives
offstage with a warm glow of blazing firelight first emanating from the
adjoining room and then filling the stage as Scrooge appears to enter it.
The image of this Spirit seated atop the table, torch held on high,
indicates some indebtedness to the first-edition illustrations by John
Leech. (This illustration and Dickens' original 1843 manuscript of Christmas
Carol are on view until January 10 at the Pierpont Morgan Library.)
It is hard to convince an audience when everyone knows what is coming, but
at this reading a sigh of relief could be heard when the last Spirit
dissolved into the bedpost.
More people than Ebenezer Scrooge are being transformed by this Christmas
experience. Stewart returns to the lectern briefly to conclude the tale,
before stepping away again to rear stage to return slowly towards the
audience, himself again, arms opened generously in a balletic gesture with a
simple 'And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God Bless Us, Every One]'
Instant standing ovation.
At the Broadhurst Theater, New York until January 3

   Even the ghost of Jack Benny couldn't save
Ebenezer Scrooge on Wednesday when a judge refused to clear the
name of the miserly main character of ``A Christmas Carol.''
   The tongue-in-cheek ruling by Municipal Judge George Choppelas
came at the Court of Historical Review and Appeals, a mock court
that met to decide if the name of the character created by Charles
Dickens should continue to be synonymous with greed and avarice.
   In the past, the court has ruled on such weighty questions as
the existence of Santa Claus or if chicken soup deserved to be
considered Jewish penicillin. Yes on both, the court found.
   The puns during the court's 65th session moved fast with
``little Dickens'' and ``you've been Scrooged'' bringing moans from
100 or so spectators.
   Scrooge, dressed in black and wearing a top hat, pleaded his
case, saying he had been ``sorely hurt by an early, early love.''
   Scrooge, portrayed by retired drama teacher E. Wyman Spalding,
claimed his mentor, Jacob Marley, should be blamed.
   ``It was Marley, Marley,'' he told the judge. ``Marley was the
real Scrooge.''
   The miser was defended by Frank Winston, who said the world
actually owed a debt to ``Eb,'' insisting that comedian Jack
Benny's tightwad image was inspired by the Scrooge character.
   Even the names were familiar, the lawyer said. BENny and
eBENezer. Get it?
   ``Eb was always a grand guy,'' Winston said.
   The references to Benny led Choppelas to try an impression of
the late comedian.
   ``I'm thinking, I'm thinking,'' he said at one point, a slight
Benny tone in his voice.
   Prosecutor Angela Alioto said Scrooge deserved his bad name
despite his change of heart at the end of the novel turned into a
popular Christmas movie.
   ``Those nightmares would scare the hell out of anybody,'' she
said. ``You can't change with a four-hour period of being nice.''
   Scrooge also drew the fire of Noah Griffin, a San Francisco
Examiner columnist who wrote a poem for the event. One stanza read:
   ``But tears from Scrooge were mean and vile
   Befitting but the crocodile.
   His so-called heartfelt transformation
   Was nothing but media manipulation.''

<LEADPARA>  EVERY COUPLE of years, someone in Hollywood decides to remake Charles Dickens'
"A Christmas Carol." Despite the various versions -- comedies, musicals,
television miniseries and cartoons -- the story has lost none of its power. In
fact, the fable of how four ghosts redeem a wayward skinflint may be even more
relevant today than it was to its 19th century audience.;   This Christmas
season, I've decided to offer my own version of the classic story, featuring:  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Commentary; Edwin Feulner is president of the Heritage Foundation, a public
policy research institute. He wrote this article for Scripps Howard News
Service.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The American middle class as Bob Cratchit. Overworked and underpaid,
Cratchit can barely make ends meet. Like many of today's overtaxed Americans,
Cratchit has to rent a home because he can't afford the down payment on a
house, has no savings account, has no idea how he will finance his kids'
education and this year can't afford to give his children the kind of
Christmas they deserve.;   President Bush as Scrooge. A basically good man,
Scrooge was led astray by his "friend" and partner, Marley, who convinced him
that money is the key to happiness. Similarly, Bush was convinced last year by
his "friends" in Congress -- and in his own administration -- that more taxes
and more government pork would help the economy.;   Supporters of the 1990 tax
hike as the Ghost of Marley. Shackled by chains, Marley returns from the dead
to warn Scrooge to reform before he, too, becomes the victim of his own greed.
Like Marley, many of the supporters of the 1990 Budget Boondoggle now are
worried about the damage they caused by raising taxes, and are calling for tax
cuts to help revive the economy.;   Ronald Reagan as the Ghost of Christmas
Past. In the Dickens version, the ghost shows Scrooge how good things were
before he was corrupted. In my version, Christmas Past reminds Scrooge of the
economic growth and prosperity created by the 1991 Kemp-Roth tax cuts: 20
million new jobs, 6 million new businesses and a 32 percent increase in real
gross national product.;   Free-market conservatives as the Ghost of Christmas
Present. In the Dickens tale, this ghost opens Scrooge's eyes to the damage
his uncaring greed has caused. The free-market version points out that the
average American -- who pays more than 40 percent of his income in federal,
state and local taxes -- is in need of tax relief.;   And any liberal as the
Ghost of Christmas Future. The last ghost to visit Scrooge shows him how he
will be rewarded if he continues his greedy ways: with an early, unmourned
death. Similarly, the ghostly liberal shows Scrooge/Bush the "rewards" of
higher taxes, runaway government spending and increased regulation: a
depressed economy, millions of Americans out of work and a liberal victory in
the 1992 elections.;   The end of "A Christmas Carol" is a happy one. Scrooge
-- after his ghostly vision thing -- awakens a changed man and immediately
runs out to spread the message of "peace on earth and goodwill to men.";   The
Washington version also could have a happy ending. All our modern Scrooge
needs to do is come up with a vision for putting the economy back on track.;  
For starters, he might want to give taxpayers a Christmas present by
guaranteeing that reductions in the defense budget will be returned to them in
the form of a tax cut, rather than squandered on congressional pork.;   Let's
make this the merriest of Christmases, and put the humbugs behind us.  </TEXT>

Cypress College's "A Christmas Carol: Scrooge and Marley" seems designed 
primarily for a youthful audience. Director Mark Majarian has brought in a 
bagful of special effects. Bells gong loudly, shrieks and yelps echo; there are 
demons with incandescent peepers, and spirits enshrouded in stage fog. 
</P>
<P>
Along these lines, Gil Morales' set has the perspective of a children's 
nightmare: The large cut-out scenery is cartoon-like and eerie, all flinty 
grays and drained-out colors. 
</P>
<P>
Even the use of Marley as a narrator -- the major innovation in this Israel 
Horovitz adaptation of Dickens' venerable tale -- appears intended to guide 
children through the story. 
</P>
<P>
Because of these touches, this "Christmas Carol" may succeed at holding some 
young kids, but their parents and older siblings are likely to fidget. Despite 
all the gee-whiz moments, the production simply doesn't involve as well as it 
should. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few central problems. The first revolves around Majarian's decision 
to use all of the Campus Theatre's large stage. This makes some sense during 
the big crowd scenes. But the more intimate passages, when we're supposed to 
grasp Scrooge's personality, are all but lost, swallowed by the expanse. Even 
on the big stage, Majarian might have blocked the actors and sets nearer to the 
audience. As it is now, though, the action is removed several feet from the 
front row. 
</P>
<P>
Another glitch: From where I sat, a gap in the scenery, toward the side, 
allowed a distracting view of the cast preparing backstage. 
</P>
<P>
A bigger problem: Too many scenes are allowed to lag. The actors move about 
doing this and that, but they don't push the action along. A prime example is 
when Scrooge all but cleans house in the long moments before Marley's first 
midnight visitation. We grow impatient; let those Christmas ghosts get on with 
it! 
</P>
<P>
Timothy D. French's Scrooge looks too young, even with makeup and gray powder 
dusted in his hair. A Cypress College student, French does try to lend the 
character age and severity through a hobbled gait and biting manner, but it 
doesn't always work. It's an impression of Scrooge, not an embodiment. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways, Ernest Jackson has the tougher role as Marley. The character 
hovers between a ghostly presence out to frighten (Jackson comes up with a lot 
of those maniacal laughs) and a hopeful moralist commenting on Scrooge's 
soulful journey. It puts Jackson at a disadvantage, as he has trouble combining 
the two.

South Coast Repertory has transformed the time-encrusted mythology of "A 
Christmas Carol" into a sprightly, well-turned comedy with an Ebenezer Scrooge 
who doesn't have a mean bone in his body. 
</P>
<P>
Scrooge is a penny-pinching grumbler, of course. And virtually everybody on 
stage either says he's a meanie or treats him like one. But we don't believe it 
for a minute. We're not meant to. Not in this version of Charles Dickens' 
Christmas tale. 
</P>
<P>
For no matter how bony Scrooge's face, how chilly his words, how miserly his 
deeds, Scrooge is a comic. This news should come as no surprise to regular 
SCR-goers. Hal Landon Jr. has played him this way every year since 1980, and 
John-David Keller has directed the show for as many silly laughs as it can get. 
</P>
<P>
The result happens to be highly entertaining, especially for a family audience. 
But it is not Dickens. It misses both the pathos of the story and the emotional 
impact. Furthermore, while Jerry Patch's adaptation manages to convey the basic 
message that kindness and charity are to be valued, the moral of the story is 
dangerously oversimplified. 
</P>
<P>
Every kid in the audience, and probably some parents, well may be persuaded 
that the inverse of the moral is true: By play's end, Scrooge discovers that 
money is the root of all good, as long as he gives it away. Money buys love. 
Money buys happiness. Money, more than generosity, remains his form of 
salvation. 
</P>
<P>
However, there can be no faulting the production for its liveliness, freshness 
and technical polish. It moves swiftly, yet without sacrificing too much 
detail. The acting is crisp and particular. Party scenes are radiant, with 
minor roles filled out beautifully. The music is warm, the costumes authentic. 
And the special effects, while vivid, are not overplayed. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, this "Christmas Carol" has the great virtue of not being boring, 
which cannot be said for many cultural rites of passage. It certainly works as 
a first taste of theater and may even whet a child's appetite for the real 
Dickens. 
</P>
<P>
Landon's star turn as Scrooge seems at all times a cross between slapstick and 
caricature, regardless of whether he's playing nasty (in his black suit and 
stovepipe hat) or playing scared (in his red nightcap and white sleeping gown). 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, his performance has been designed for kids. It prizes all sorts of 
amusing goofiness, including baby talk and an acrobatic hat trick. One thing it 
does not include is anything remotely British -- in keeping with most of the 
other performances -- though not for lack of trying. (Landon affects a peculiar 
accent that sounds vaguely Southern.) 
</P>
<P>
Back from previous years in fine form are Ron Michaelson as the Spirit of 
Christmas Present, Art Koustik and Martha McFarland as Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig 
(both doubling in minor roles), Don Took as Marley (also doubling), John 
Ellington as Bob Cratchit and Howard Shangraw as Scrooge's nephew. 
</P>
<P>
Two admirable newcomers to the production, Jarion Monroe and Devon Raymond, are 
outstanding additions. Monroe, who replaces Richard Doyle as the Spirit of 
Christmas Past, brings a precise elegance to the role (as deft in its way as 
the smarmy flair he lent to "A Chorus of Disapproval" earlier this season). And 
Raymond, as Belle, not only fits her character's name but has a quiet, 
authoritative presence that is very appealing, and talent to match.

   When Charles Dickens wrote ``A Christmas Carol''
in 1843, he had no way of knowing that his simple truths would
provide creative fodder for filmmakers, animators, lyricists and
playwrights for generations to come.
   Many holiday-themed movies take their cue from Dickens'
wonderful story of Ebenezer Scrooge and his change of heart.
   Here is an alphabetical list of some, but certainly not all, of
some holiday-spiced videos for the Thanksgiving-Christmas-New Year
season. Many are versions of ``A Christmas Carol'':
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   - ``Alice's Restaurant'' (1969): It's the Thanksgiving Dinner
that couldn't be beat, and the generation that just said ``no'' to
the draft. From Arlo Guthrie's song.
   - ``Auntie Mame'' (1958): Christmas despair leads to Christmas
joy and a new marriage for Auntie Mame in this delightful romp.
   - ``Babes in Toyland'' (1961): A terrible Disney version (if
there is such a thing) of the Victor Herbert operetta, starring
Annette Funicello, Tommy Sands and Ray Bolger.
   - ``The Bear Who Slept Through Christmas'' (1983): Animated
story about a bear who skips hibernation to find out what Christmas
is all about. Not bad, but certainly not great.
   - ``Caspar's First Christmas'' (1987): Any parent who inflicts
this dud on a kid should be arrested for child abuse. Horrible
animation and terrible Caspar voice (it's not the one in the
original Caspar the Friendly Ghost cartoons) help make it
unbearable.
   - ``A Charlie Brown Christmas'' (1965): If you ever wondered
what CHristmas was all about, wonder no more. A magical treat from
the Peanuts characters.
   - ``A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving'' (1973): Linus explains the
true meaning of Thanksgiving. Another Peanuts gem.
   - ``A Child's Christmas in Wales'' (1987): Dylan Thomas'
wonderful story, somewhat lamely done.
   - ``A Christmas CArol'' (1938): A compassionate look at Scrooge,
starring Reginald Owen and GEne Lockhart.
   - ``A Christmas Carol'' (1951): The better version, with often
scary sequences. Stars Alastair Sim as a more broken and evil
Scrooge, whose transformation is all the more poignant.
   - ``Christmas in Connecticut'' (1945): A phony family for an
advice columnist. FAst-paced fun, starring Barbara Stanwyck and
Sydney Greenstreet.

Award-winning movie that starred Sidney Poitier. This one is rather
Lame, but has its heart in the right place. Stars Billy Dee

of Christmas in the 1940s and the ultimate gift, a regulation Red

cartoon master himself, Chuck JOnes.

California to start a new church. A slice of American pie, but not
as tasty. Stars Hari Rhodes and BEah Richards.

down-home obnoxious TV pitchman, helps Santa. You have to be a true
Ernest fan for this one.
   - ``Happy New Year, Charlie Brown'' (1985): That old gang again.
And great as always.
   - ``Holiday Inn'' (1942): With music by Irving Berlin, and
memorable performances by Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby, who could

white marvel, starring JAmes Stewart as the man who made the wrong
wish and was saved from it.

feature starring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, who save the land of
Old King Cole from the horrible boogeymen.
   - ``Meet Me in St. Louis'' (1944): Family entertainment from

Finney and Alec Guiness.
   - ``Scrooged'' (1988): One of the more disastrous versions of
the Dickens story. Saved by CArol Kane as the ghost of Christmas
Present. Stars Bill Murray doing his usual.
hilarious, as is the entire movie. Co-stars Eddie Murphy, Ralph
Bellamy, Don AMeche and Jamie Lee Curtis.
   - ``A Tree Grows in Brooklyn'' (1945): A sentimental portrait of
a working class family - in Brooklyn.
   - ``White Christmas'' (1954): AN inferior redo of ``Holiday
Inn,'' but it makes good use of the title song. Stars Bing Crosby
again.

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Repertory Theatre has produced a bold, challenging, beautifully 
wrought version of "A Christmas Carol" on its Lyceum Stage that will not be to 
everyone's taste. 
</P>
<P>
To bring home Dickens' message about the poor of his day in the show's 15th 
annual year here, directors Walter Schoen and Tavis Ross have contemporized the 
setting so that we can see Charles Dickens' story as it might be discovered by 
the poor of our day. 
</P>
<P>
Dickens himself, a passionate advocate for the overworked and underfed, would 
probably love it. But post-show complaints mixed with praise from an audience 
that seemed divided about having their old-fashioned "Christmas Carol" tampered 
with. 
</P>
<P>
Without changing the words in the faithful adaptation by Douglas Jacobs, the 
company's artistic director, the story begins in a contemporary urban setting, 
not unlike the streets surrounding the theater itself. The actors are dressed 
like our own homeless, crowding around barrels of burning paper for warmth. And 
their varying ethnic backgrounds -- African-American, Anglo, Latino -- hold up 
a mirror to our own multicultural society. 
</P>
<P>
Into this mix, a little boy, played by the adorably precocious 10-year-old Kory 
Abosada, brings a copy of "A Christmas Carol" home to read to his mother. Just 
as he gets started, the police sirens start shrieking and the people run to 
hide. The little boy returns with his book before the others do and encounters 
an old man (Leon Singer) checking the place out. The boy approaches the man, 
and the man slaps him -- hard. The other homeless return and surround the old 
man menacingly. 
</P>
<P>
The old man's punishment as mimed by the company? He has to act out "A 
Christmas Carol" with them, playing the part of Ebenezer Scrooge. The boy plays 
the parts of both Tiny Tim and the youngest of the Ebenezers that Scrooge meets 
in his subsequent journey with the Ghost of Christmas Past. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the story ends, with the cast pulling props from their environment 
and singing haunting Christmas melodies that come out of their variety of 
heritages, the old man who plays Scrooge has had a change of heart. This time 
when the sirens come, he puts his arm around the little boy protectively. Like 
Scrooge, he has learned a lesson about keeping Christmas in his heart. 
</P>
<P>
This year's production is an extension of the contemporary setting explored by 
Schoen as solo director last year. But while the idea seemed unfinished a year 
ago, this time the added pantomimed prologue brings the message home. 
</P>
<P>
One certainly cannot imagine any improvement on the performances. 
</P>
<P>
Singer, an actor who hails originally from Mexico, is a memorable Scrooge -- so 
crusty and cynical that it is all the more moving when he melts. Lance E. 
Nichols is stalwart as Scrooge's good clerk, Bob Cratchit, Richard Ortega 
utterly charming as Scrooge's good-hearted nephew, Fred. Tavis Ross suggests 
pain even as he inspires fear as the ghost of Scrooge's old partner in 
parsimony, Jacob Marley. Osayande Baruti brings charismatic life to the 
high-stepping Fezziwig, the good master Scrooge had as a young apprentice. And 
Cristina Soria lends fine support in her double role as Fezziwig's and 
Cratchit's wives. 
</P>
<P>
Narrators Dana Pere and Alyce Smith-Cooper keep the story flowing as they pass 
the story from hand to hand. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Nelson, who plays the oldest of the young Ebenezers, provides the 
spirited choreography that is such a delight in the Fezziwig scene. Musical 
director Linda Vickerman does such a fine job with the arrangements and 
compositions sung by this terrific array of voices, that one wishes more music 
could have been included. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Buderwitz's sets, nicely lit by John B. Forbes, are as they were last year 
-- intelligently evocative of a modern street scene, with props designed to 
look as if they came naturally from such a place. The costumes by Mary Larson 
also seem reminiscent of those from last year, but again cleverly so. The best 
of the pleasing bunch has got to be the Ghost of Christmas Present costume 
which makes the big, hearty-voiced Richard Allen look like a human Christmas 
tree, with tinsel and name brand packaging hanging from his arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
But the true completion of the contemporizing concept here is the San Diego 
Rep's Magic Christmas program. Each patron is requested to bring an unwrapped 
present for disadvantaged children and/or their families from the Hillcrest 
Receiving Home, St. Vincent de Paul, Casa de Amaro, Hidden Valley House, 
Southeast Emergency Quarters, Project Safehouse and Casa de Paz. The presents 
will be placed under a tree in the Lyceum lobby and on Dec. 19, the actor 
playing Scrooge will give out the presents after a benefit performance for 
children and families from these shelters. 
</P>
<P>
For that audience, this setting should certainly bring the Dickens' story home. 
</P>

<LEADPARA>  'A CHRISTMAS Carol" is the holiday tradition I look forward to most, and
American Conservatory Theater does it better than anyone else.;   The original
1843 novella is more than a Christmas ornament, which is why it continues to
move people to tears, year after year. Charles Dickens wrote it as Christian
social protest: a lesson to England's comfortable middle classes, insulated
behind diamond-paned windows from the grime and despair of the Industrial
Revolution.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ACT'S 'CHRISTMAS CAROL' IS STILL THE BEST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Today, after the money-grubbing '80s, as we face recession and unemployment
and pay taxes to support our own post-Victorian workhouses, its powerful
message of responsibility and compassion still rings strong and true.;   ACT's
annual production of this parable is by now a classic, but the company isn't
resting on its laurels (or should we say its green bay and holly?) in its
silver anniversary season. It assigned the show to David Maier, co-founder of
its alumni Encore Theater Company, and he has freshened it wonderfully.;  
Maier has encouraged the actors to revisit the familiar text and add a wealth
of detail, as, for instance, the way Marley's ghost strains against his
fetters -- they're anchored somewhere in the netherworld -- to gain time so he
can warn Ebenezer Scrooge about the consequences of his miserly life. Or the
way a child in the Christmas Past episode puts his hand confidingly in
Scrooge's, causing that "covetous old sinner" to look down with surprise at
this human and loving gesture.;   William Paterson is Scrooge in 13 of the 25
performances, with Ken Ruta in the other 12. Both are past masters of the
role, able to snarl "Bah, humbug!" with panache.;   There are genial
performances from Michael Scott Ryan as the ironic narrator, Richard
Butterfield and Judith Moreland as Bob and Mrs. Cratchit, Kelvin Han Yee as
Marley's ghost, Mark Silence as nephew Fred. Laurie McDermott turns the sweet
integrity of Belle, young Scrooge's lost love, into purest silver, which also
describes the voice of the caroler, Danielle Vinje.;   The production does
tend to run long, by about 10 minutes. That's fixable.;   The whole takes
place on Robert Blackman's enchanting unit set, an Advent calendar with
candelabra, toys, street lamps, door knockers, clock faces and inkwells carved
into its veneer. If you look closely, you can see that it has cash boxes for
steps and piled-up account ledgers for bedposts.;   I was struck, this time
through, to recognize the beautiful recurring song by Lee Hoiby as a true
carol: that is, a strophic song. The story itself is strophic -- Dickens
called its divisions "staves," not chapters -- and each section represents one
stanza in the carol of Ebenezer Scrooge, the grinch stolen by Christmas.;   --

<TEXT>
To see Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol onstage is to know again, with a
frisson of joy, how theatrical its author's instincts were.
What, I wonder, would he have made of the coup de theatre with which the
Royal Shakespeare Company's new version of A Christmas Carol opens? The
panoramic view of London in dark silhouette, dominated by the dome of St
Paul's, lifts yards into the sky - and, from the blackness beneath, there
emerge people, also in black: in Bible black, indeed, for Marley's funeral.
I hope Dickens would have marvelled at all this, and at much that follows in
Ian Judge's staging of John Mortimer's new adaptation.
This Christmas Carol, following the haunting RSC precedent of Trevor Nunn's
Nicholas Nickleby, proceeds on three main levels: as a series of stage
pictures, as a stage elucidation of Dickens's text, and as a collage of
Victorian Christmas music. Sometimes the three come thrillingly together: as
when Scrooge snuffs out the Spirit of Christmas Past. We see the conical
snuffing-cap pushing the Spirit down into (and through) the ground; we
follow Scrooge's exhausting travail much as Dickens described it; and
meanwhile the scene is watched by a chorus of Victorians in black, who sing
'Hark the herald angels sing' with warning fierceness. The melodramatic
excitement, the psychological intensity, the sense of Christmas as a
jubilantly lyrical experience that is being threatened by Scrooge - all
these are there together.
Visually, the production is consistently excellent - thanks in particular to
John Gunter's set, Deirdre Clancy's costumes, and Nigel Levings's lighting.
Verbally, Mortimer's text is first-rate; he is plainly in love with Dickens
as both sound and sense. And so are most of Judge's RSC actors, most of them
playing several roles each. A pity that he lets them make too little of some
lines (Scrooge 'carried his own low temperature always about with him') and
some episodes (Belle breaking off her engagement to a younger Scrooge). But
where the production is more frequently flawed is with Nigel Hess's music.
Most of the onstage singing is weak, but the taped music and orchestrations
are worse. The difference a few live instruments - - and less amplification
 -would make] As an arranger, he could have struck more gold from his
material; but since his material is mainly the classic Christmas carols we
all know, the perfect Dickensian fusion of generosity and sentiment is
achieved now and then.
Clive Francis is a first-rate Scrooge, an antique crustacean who manages to
glow friskily once he learns to drop his shell. Paul Greenwood and Polly
James do good work as the tender Cratchit parents, as do Philip Quast and
Sara Weymouth as Scrooge's laughing nephew and his wife, Cherry Morris and
Peter Warnock as the bubbling old Fezziwigs. The Spirit of Christmas Present
(John Kane) is too bombastic, and Christmas past (Stephen Jean) too mild;
they should be Virgil to Scrooge's Dante. Marley's ghost - so plainly
modelled on Hamlet's papa - is over-miked and under-chained.
But the 18-foot Christmas Yet To Come, hooded and cloaked like a Grim Reaper
with only two skeletal claws visible, is splendid. The party scenes are all
infectious. And the finale, with snow falling through the hovering Christmas
trees and rooftops onto the cast, whose black attire is now illumined by
scarlet winter scarves, is ideal.

LAMB'S SWEETENED 'CAROL' GOES WITH DINNER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The least memorable part of "Dickens, Dining &amp; Song," the newest Lamb's 
Players Theatre Christmas offering, is, alas, the Dickens. 
</P>
<P>
In part, that criticism is a tribute to the dining and song -- both of which 
are very fine indeed, thanks to an impressive chef, Paul Vida, and the six 
spirited and sweet-voiced madrigal singers who serenade the diners throughout 
the three-hour event. 
</P>
<P>
But it also reflects the skimpy 50-minute adaptation of "A Christmas Carol," 
which is thrown in like a dessert after a 90-minute dinner of awesome roast 
beef and turkey in the Great Hall of St. Paul's Cathedral at 5th and Nutmeg. 
</P>
<P>
Lamb's resident playwright, Kerry Meads, originally adapted the timeless story 
for four actors to tour schools and churches. The result is more impressive for 
its cleverness in condensing the story than it is for sending home the heart of 
Dickens' tale about a man desperately in need of reclamation and how the 
characters in the poverty-stricken world around him may live or die on the 
basis of the changes he does or does not make. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Maley plays Ebenezer Scrooge and Sharon Maley (Maley's real-life wife), 
Eric Briner and Lori Merril play the other roles. But many of the most 
emotionally wrenching parts are left to the imagination: the Ghosts of 
Christmas Past, Present and Future who come to haunt Ebenezer; Jacob Marley, 
come back from the dead to warn his old friend of the doom that awaits him if 
he doesn't change his stingy ways; frail, innocent Tiny Tim perched on the 
shoulders of his father, Ebenezer's poor clerk, Bob Cratchit. 
</P>
<P>
This has the unmistakable sense of a show played more for children than adults. 
Not only are the frightening ghosts gone, but the iciness at the heart of old 
Scrooge is softened into eccentric grumpiness. Bob Cratchit and his family 
don't really seem to be starving. This is a comfortable looking company that 
tells the story with fine, dramatic expression, but they don't make you feel 
the want, the pain and, most importantly, the stakes involved in the 
alterations Scrooge needs to make in himself and in his world. 
</P>
<P>
Dickens' message has been sweetened and simplified. Instead of the story 
Dickens wrote to rail against hard-hearted businessmen going about their 
business in the wake of general misery, this becomes a story about a man who 
would get along with others better if he would just loosen up and smile. 
</P>
<P>
But the story goes down easily with dinner and all the trimmings: hearty 
stuffing, mashed potatoes, carrots, Yorkshire pudding, served by beautifully 
costumed food servers and passed around the tables family-style. And the dinner 
and dessert buffet (after the play) goes down well in the beautifully decorated 
Great Hall, with twinkling lights in the trees on either side of the stage and 
in the green boughs wrapped around the wooden beams. 
</P>
<P>
What Lamb's has attempted and largely succeeded in doing is to create a 
prosperous, idealized version of a 19th-Century Victorian feast and 
celebration. Norman Rockwell might have sketched a picture much like this. 
</P>
<P>
The madrigals are lovely, and the music curls seductively around the hall, 
almost palpably softening the expressions on the faces of the 250 people seated 
at the handsomely set and decorated tables. The message is to enjoy, to relax. 
If you want a challenging "Carol," check out the San Diego Repertory Theatre 
production. 
</P>
<P>
But if you want to sit back and meet some pleasant table mates in an atmosphere 
that exudes comfort and goodwill, this is the place.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As Ebenezer Scrooge plunges headlong with the rest of us into an apparently 
nasty decade filled with omens of war and hard times, his redemption through 
generosity and kindness would seem to have a special significance. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, Hal Landon Jr. has turned serious as Charles Dickens' 
notorious miser. He brings a far more provocative dimension to his perennial 
starring role in South Coast Repertory's adaptation of "A Christmas Carol" than 
the caricature he gave us last year. 
</P>
<P>
Landon remakes Scrooge into a tragic figure of sorts, who manages to avoid the 
usual fate of tragic figures. He also has eliminated last year's giddy baby 
talk in a climactic second-act scene, which clearly was intended to entertain 
the 6-year-olds in the audience but which trivialized the meaning of the play. 
</P>
<P>
Landon's deepened performance, however, is not matched by the rest of the 
company, which is nowhere near as crisp as it was last year. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the casting of a handful of minority actors in major supporting roles 
-- a commendable, politically correct effort -- the production is measurably 
diminished by the loss of such top-notch SCR veterans as Anni Long, Jarion 
Monroe and Don Took as well as Devon Raymond, one of the brightest newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the romantic byplay -- or even a spark of attraction -- between 
young Ebenezer and Belle is totally lost. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, with Dante di Loreto and Raymond in the roles, it made for one of 
the play's more appealing digressions. But Richard Soto gives a wooden and 
uninviting performance as young Ebenezer, no better here than he was this 
summer as Claudio in the Grove Shakespeare Festival's "Much Ado About Nothing." 
Lucy Rodriguez not only lacks delicacy as Belle but manages the seemingly 
impossible feat of swallowing her words while delivering them with a stentorian 
flourish. Their parting scene as would-be lovers has the flavor of community 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Butler, also a newcomer, fares better in the roles of Marley's Ghost and 
the Spirit of Christmas Yet-To-Come, both heavily disguised by makeup and 
costuming. 
</P>
<P>
SCR veteran Richard Doyle, replacing Art Koustik (who is recovering from a 
motorcycle accident), brings the requisite joviality to the role of Mr. 
Fezziwig and gives us a baudier, less feral portrait of the Fagan-like Joe. And 
while Ron Boussom's depiction of the Ghost of Christmas Past is comically 
effete, it pales by comparison with Monroe's precise elegance in last year's 
production. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the party scenes as a whole have lost some of their radiance, 
although director John-David Keller's staging is full of lively details and 
Dwight Richard Odle's costumes are colorful and authentic. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the show's overall technical pizazz is all there, including special 
effects that elicited shrieks from the audience. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the supporting cast will improve with more performances. Getting 
accustomed to the chatter from the kids in the seats may help as well. 
</P>
<P>
As a cultural rite of passage, "A Christmas Carol" plays to many kids. The 
veteran actors in this annual holiday show have come to expect interruptions. 
On opening night Wednesday during the second act, however, one young child kept 
up such a long, loud, running conversation with himself, his parents and nobody 
in particular that it would have been hard for Olivier himself to have cast a 
spell.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Arts: A Christmas Carol - Theatre

Patrick Stewart, and Charles Dickens, plainly have a dedicated following. At
the end of his one-man performance of A Christmas Carol at the Old Vic,
Stewart received an immediate standing ovation. And in the last 20 minutes
of his two-hour show one can see why: as the reformed, beneficent Scrooge,
Stewart is totally in command of his material and his audience.
Not that there were lapses before; the technique is always there. Any
reservations are about how far it is possible to reduce the Dickens novel to
a solo show.
When people were reputed to have known A Christmas Carol by heart, perhaps
they would have picked up every nuance and minor character and gone along
quite happily with the sequence of the ghosts of Christmas. A lot of people
still do. Never having developed a taste for Dickens, I shall defer to them,
save to say that much of it seems maudlin and repetitious and that unless
you know the story by heart, you may find a one-man version confusing and
irritating.
My only other criticism could be a compliment. Stewart's opening Scrooge -
the hard man - does not seem such a bad old stick. When someone wishes him
'Merry Christmas', he replies 'humbug': not an uncommon sentiment. Possibly
this a deliberate interpretation. Underneath the mean old Scrooge, there was
always a generous soul waiting to break out. The simpler explanation,
however, is that Stewart is much better playing Scrooge, good or bad, rather
than all the other characters as well.
The Old Vic is a biggish theatre with a large stage. On the first night it
was packed. Despite the seasonal coughing, Stewart held the audience
throughout. He knew his performance was working because after going through
an hysterical burst of laughter, he suddenly ad-libbed: 'For a man who has
been out of practice so long, that was a brilliant laugh.' Applause all
round.
For the last six years or so Stewart has given his talents to Hollywood and
television. Here is a welcome re-appearance. As an actor he has a lean and
hungry look. One hopes that the Royal Shakespeare Company, of which he is
still an honorary member, can tempt him back to greater parts.
Old Vic until January 8. (071) 928 7616

FT  21 DEC 94 / Recruitment: Christmas Carol with a different tune -
Ebenezer Scrooge has survived until the late 20th-century and no longer
needs Bob Cratchit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the lasting themes in A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens is the
pursuit of wealth for its own sake without social responsibility. Scrooge
sits in his counting house, oblivious to his own material needs and those of
his employee, Bob Cratchit.
The relationship between manager and employee has rarely been more pertinent
than it is today. Suppose, instead of focusing on the human condition,
Dickens had looked at the job itself. Suppose the spirits who visit Scrooge
after he has seen the apparition of his late partner, Marley, are
concentrating on something other than his personal history and prospects.
Imagine, for instance, he is visited by the spirits of jobs, past present
and future. What would they have beheld?
A condensed version of the story might have started thus:
The job was dead to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. Dead
as a doornail. Scrooge knew it was dead. Scrooge was the employer and
Scrooge needed no more jobs, not in the ordinary course of events.
Hard and sharp as flint - a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,
clutching, covetous old sinner - Scrooge sat in his counting house on a cold
bleak, foggy Christmas Eve. 'You'll not be in tomorrow, I suppose,' he said
to his solitary clerk.
'If quite convenient, sir.'
'It's not convenient,' said Scrooge, 'and it's not fair. Expecting the
employer to shoulder every social responsibility. If it's not holidays, it's
maternity leave, sick pay and pensions. Bah. Humbug,' said Scrooge. 'You'll
be downsized, soon enough. Downsized or outsourced.'
Scrooge stepped out into the cold, misty City streets and wound his way
through the throngs of last minute shoppers until he came to the chambers he
had once shared with his former partner, Marley. Was that Marley's face upon
the knocker. 'Nonsense]' said Scrooge to himself, twitching his eyes.
Settling himself in his nightgown, a bowl of gruel on his lap, he tried to
rid himself of Marley's image. But the face was everywhere about the room. A
noise of dragging chains and footsteps, at first faint, now clearer, could
be heard beyond the bedroom door.
The apparition as it passed through the door was visible at once as Marley,
dragging his heavy chain fixed to cash boxes, keys, padlocks, ledgers and
deeds.
'Who are you?' asked Scrooge.
'Ask me who I was. This chain, these boxes, these trappings of the job. I
wear the chain I forged in life.' The spirit looked Scrooge in the face. 'I
am here to warn you. You may yet escape my fate, Ebenezer. You will be
visited by three spirits on successive nights.' The fading apparition
swirled throughout the open window out into the night. Scrooge tried hard to
say 'humbug' but could not and dragged himself back to sleep. It was already
dark when he awoke to hear the clock striking the hour that Marley had
foretold.
A light flashed inside the room and a hand drew aside the curtain of his
bed. It was a familiar figure, dressed in a boiler suit, holding a spanner
in the other hand and wearing a flat cap. 'I am the ghost of employment
past,' it said.
Holding Scrooge by the hand, he guided him out into the high street. Here
was the bank with its tall marble pillars, crafted plasterwork and long
counters staffed by clerks stamping passbooks, counting change and banking
the contents of weekly wage packets. Managers sat behind oak desks in
private offices, sipping tea brought by their secretaries. Outside town in
the car factory, the workers had their precise jobs defined and their unions
ensured that demarcation lines were maintained. The staff, their
nomenclature dictated by their white collars, had their desks and telephones
and adding machines and reporting structures.
One of the boiler-suited figures was complaining to the bank clerk. The wage
negotiations had been going badly. 'They can't make the five-per cent limit
stick,' he said. 'We took the vote on a show of hands. We're out tomorrow.'
No sooner had the image faded than Scrooge beheld another figure before him.
A pin-striped woman? Scrooge blinked. She was so young.
'I am the ghost of employment present,' said the spirit. It was Christmas
morning now and Scrooge found himself standing in the City streets, scored
by freshly dug trenches awaiting plastic cables for the information
super-highway.
There was Scrooge's clerk, Bob Cratchit, struggling to get away from the
traffic lights in his company Vauxhall Cavalier, still brand new. There was
Tiny Tim, sitting up in his Nuffield bed, paid for using Bob's Bupa
membership. Bob had made the most of his flexible benefit: extra holidays,
private medical insurance, company car. It helped subdue the fears arising
from the negative equity in the mock Georgian 'executive' home he had bought
at the height of the property boom.
The spirit pulled Scrooge by the hand, moving through the night, across the
land, to a former council house in Nottingham where a miner, not long
redundant was feasting his family. 'It's not going to last but the
re-training might work if there's a job at the end of it,' he said.
They passed students, drinking away the future with their talk of travelling
the world and working for nothing. They saw worried faces on redundant
middle managers, wondering how long their temporary work and casual
opportunities could stave off house repossession, and they saw the homeless,
long since deserted by hope. They passed a director, pondering the financial
pages, working out the best time to take his share options, knowing that in
a downsized, delayered workplace his own options were running out. Time to
telephone the headhunter.
As the spirit disappeared, Scrooge prepared himself for the final phantom as
it emerged from the gloom. 'Ghost of employment future. I fear you more than
any spectre I have yet seen,' said Scrooge.
The ghost said nothing but pointed to an empty office block. A middle aged
man, was it Cratchit? stood on the pavement looking bewildered. He was
speaking to Tiny Tim held in his arms: 'No one told me about this Tim. I
thought I had a job for life and it's gone. That old skinflint Scrooge said
he wanted a leaner organisation. He could get my job done more cheaply
outside. The outplacement was helpful. I have a short-term contract now but
frankly its not as good as before.
'Never mind, Tim. Something will come up.'
The mist descended and when it lifted they were back in Scrooge's chambers.
Time had passed. Scrooge himself was nowhere to be seen. A computer terminal
sat on a desk. In came Bob Cratchit, wearing jeans, with Tiny Tim bouncing
after him, now not so tiny. 'Once we've removed this, Tim, that will be the
end of it. He never realised. Who needs a counting house when you have
software systems? Who needs an office when you can work from home? Those
computer games you played in hospital served you well. We can live on the
royalties from your Sonic Scrooge game for the rest of our lives.'
The spirit showed Scrooge one last image - a gravestone on which he could
just make out the inscription. It said: The job.
'So it's true,' said Scrooge who emerged from the haunting a wiser man.
Renaming his business Scrooge Management Consultancy, he passed on the
accounting work to Cratchit Systems Inc, took time out, wrote a book, became
a guru, joined the lecture circuit and lunched on other people's expense
accounts. 'Work?' he said. 'This is what I call work.'

HOME TECH: OFFBEAT FILMS OFFER PLENTY OF SEASONAL CHEER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Offbeat, fairly obscure Christmas movies can provide the warm, seasonal cheer 
you're looking for in a holiday-oriented film -- as much as you'll find in 
chestnuts such as "Holiday Inn" and "White Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
But when you're confronted with shelves full of holiday movies at your local 
video store, it's hard to figure out which ones will provide heavy doses of 
cheer and which won't. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a guide that may help you make your selections: 
</P>
<P>
* "Holiday Affair" (Turner Entertainment, 1949). In the late '40s, there were 
many movies about the plight of war widows. This small movie, one of the good 
ones in that genre, works as heart-warming holiday entertainment. Janet Leigh 
plays an impoverished widow with a young son who's anxious to get a set of 
trains for Christmas. Meanwhile, his mother is being courted by two handsome 
suitors (Robert Mitchum and Wendell Corey). Predictable, not too sentimental 
and basically well-made. 
</P>
<P>
* "One Magic Christmas" (Disney, 1985). If you can buy gruff Harry Dean Stanton 
as a guardian angel, you'll like this tale of a mother (Mary Steenburgen) who's 
weighed down by so many problems she can't generate any Christmas spirit. But 
the angel and her 6-year-old daughter figure out a way to pump her full of 
holiday cheer. In the meantime, you'll be infused with a healthy dose of cheer 
too. Good, often overlooked holiday movie. 
</P>
<P>
* "Christmas in Connecticut" (MGM/UA, 1945). This one belongs with the best in 
the Christmas-movie genre. It's a merry romantic comedy concerning a magazine 
columnist (Barbara Stanwyck) who writes about food, farm life and family, 
though blithely ignorant of all three. To salvage her job, she has to 
orchestrate a homey Christmas in Connecticut for her boss (Sydney Greenstreet) 
and a war veteran (Dennis Morgan). You'll be flooded with seasonal cheer as you 
watch the columnist and the veteran warm up to each other. 
</P>
<P>
* "Christmas Lilies of the Field" (MPI, 1979). In this sequel, Billy Dee 
Williams plays amiable drifter Homer Smith -- a role made famous by Sidney 
Poitier in the 1963 original. In the original, nuns coaxed Homer into building 
a chapel in the Arizona desert. This time, the nuns need an orphanage and a 
kindergarten. Homer, naturally, drifts in at the right time. This one is so 
full of sentiment and holiday spirit, you may OD on both. 
</P>
<P>
* "The Christmas Wife" (HBO, 1988). Jason Roberts plays a lonely widower who 
goes to an agency to hire a woman to be his Christmas companion in a mountain 
retreat. He hooks up with shy Iris (Julie Harris), who has an interesting 
secret. Watching this low-key character study, which was made-for-cable, you'll 
marvel at the skills of the stars. This is as good and touching as anything in 
the Christmas-movie genre. 
</P>
<P>
* "Dot and Santa Claus" (CBS-Fox, 1979). A mixture of animation and live 
action, this is the fast-moving tale of a little girl who goes globe-trotting 
with Santa in search of her lost baby kangaroo. Mostly for youngsters, but 
adults will find it charming and loaded with holiday cheer. 
</P>
<P>
* "Ernest Saves Christmas"(Touchstone, 1988). If you're over 10, you may not be 
able to stomach Ernest P. Worrell (Jim Varney), the good-hearted goof who seems 
to have the mind of a 10-year-old. But it's easy to see what kids see in him. 
He's the grown-up who's also on their level. This time our child-like hero 
comes to the rescue when Santa runs into a series of problems that keep him 
from doing his duty. If you can somehow keep Ernest from getting on your 
nerves, you'll come away from this one with nice holiday glow. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" -- the heart-warming tale of the 
transformation of a nasty old grump into a warm, charitable guy during the 
holidays -- is as much a part of this season as Christmas trees and turkey. But 
there are so many versions available on video that choosing one isn't easy. 
Here's a guide to the most prominent ones: 
</P>
<P>
* "A Christmas Carol" (United Home Video, 1951). If you're really fussy about 
Dickens and you want a version reasonably faithful to the original, this should 
be your choice. Scrooge is usually portrayed as a one-dimensional old miser, a 
flat, cardboard cutout who's mean for the fun of it. But Alistair Sims manages 
to flesh out the character. You get some hints about why he's such an unsavory 
human being. An excellent drama, but a bit on the dark, moody side. 
</P>
<P>
* "A Christmas Carol" (MGM/UA, 1938). If you can't find the version starring 
Alistair Sim, this one will do. Reginald Owen's Scrooge isn't as multilayered 
as Sim's, but as heart-warming holiday entertainment, the 1938 version is 
superior to the 1951 film. 
</P>
<P>
* "Scrooged" (1988, Paramount). In this hip, somewhat dark-toned contemporary 
version, smirking Bill Murray stars as the nasty TV executive who shapes up 
after the three ghosts force him to see what a louse he's become. Fairly funny 
but not particularly full of holiday cheer. 
</P>
<P>
* "Scrooge" (CBS-Fox, 1970). "A Christmas Carol" as a musical, with Albert 
Finney amiably over-acting in the title role. The Leslie Bricusse score isn't 
memorable, but Alec Guiness is as Marley's ghost. A solid holiday 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
* "Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol" (Paramount, 1962). An animated musical version 
-- catchy score by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill -- of Dickens' tale with 
near-sighted Mr. Magoo (the voice of Jim Backus) as Scrooge. This one is also 
strangely dark-toned, with Magoo playing an actor who's starring in a 
theatrical production of Scrooge. More serious than you'd expect but ultimately 
good fun. 
</P>
<P>
If you're in a humbug mood, here are some movies that will snap you out of it: 
</P>
<P>
* "Silent Night, Deadly Night" (IVE, 1984). In this slash-and-splatter flick, 
Santa is an ax-murderer. This movie is gleefully perverse -- and very gory. 
</P>
<P>
* "Black Christmas" (Warner, 1975). Starring John Saxon and Margot Kidder, this 
is a bone-chilling tale about a maniac who's holed up in the attic of a college 
sorority house during Christmas vacation, killing off the co-eds. 
</P>
<P>
After watching these two, you'll be so down that you'll want to recuperate by 
immersing yourself in Christmas cheer.

AN UP-TO-DATE 'CHRISTMAS CAROL' AT THE REP

<P>
Cheers to the San Diego Repertory Theatre for putting the true Christmas spirit 
into its 14th edition of "A Christmas Carol" on the Lyceum Stage. 
</P>
<P>
The theater could have trotted out the same wonderful, heartwarming sure-fire 
success that "A Christmas Carol" has always been for them -- and goodness 
knows, at the end of a tough, controversial season like this past one, they 
could have used something safe. 
</P>
<P>
They could have cut costs by dusting off old sets, freshening up old costumes 
and pulling out old props. Instead, director Walter Schoen looked at an 
oft-overlooked side of Charles Dickens -- his role as a crusader against the 
social injustices of his time -- and decided to address the sadnesses of our 
own. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of focusing on the poor of Victorian England, Schoen set this year's 
"Carol" on a San Diego street where the homeless congregate. The prologue is 
simple and brief: Some of the homeless, to keep warm, are burning books. One of 
the books, pulled from the fire by a little boy who wants to hear a story, is 
"A Christmas Carol." As the boy's mother reads the story, the homeless 
community acts it out, using props from the street: a wastebasket with planks 
of wood for Bob Cratchit's desk, a shopping cart with a coin changer for a 
store. 
</P>
<P>
Once the mother, played with rousing spirit by Sylvia M'Lafi Thompson, begins 
reading the story, the script is the same sturdy, satisfying adaptation by 
Douglas Jacobs that the Rep has always used. 
</P>
<P>
One of the pluses of the contemporary opening is that it gives the show welcome 
room to play with a range of retrospective styles. The dances, smartly 
choreographed by Bruce Nelson, range from old English steps to break dancing by 
the agile Nelson as Mr. Fezziwig. And the music -- beautifully orchestrated by 
Linda Vickerman for one of the Rep's most able singing casts -- moves 
effortlessly from gospel singing to old carols to modern pop. 
</P>
<P>
Still, while the Rep's daring deserves praise, Schoen would have been more 
successful if he had pushed his concept further. 
</P>
<P>
The director seems to be after a "Man of La Mancha" effect, in which Dickens' 
book, like Cervantes' manuscript in "Man of La Mancha," needs to justify its 
existence if it is to survive. But he doesn't put enough force behind the idea. 
</P>
<P>
When the boy saves the book from the fire, the man tending the fire just shrugs 
instead of scolding him. There is an issue here for the man to raise; when 
people are cold, isn't concrete warmth more important than storytelling ? 
</P>
<P>
What needs to be pointed out more forcefully -- obvious as it may be to some -- 
is that this book is needed to warm these people's hearts even more than it is 
needed to warm their hands. 
</P>
<P>
Also, to elicit more sympathy for the homeless who act out the play, one needs 
to establish characters -- even briefly -- who can show themselves to be 
personally affected by the story in the end. 
</P>
<P>
Why not have someone -- perhaps the small boy's mother -- beseech the vagrant 
who is to play Scrooge for an extra piece of bread for her boy who is ailing? 
Why not have her plead for the sake of the Christmas spirit, only to be turned 
down by the fellow who -- in the true spirit of Scrooge -- doesn't see why 
Christmas should be used as an excuse to take away a starving man's last crust? 
</P>
<P>
Why not show the small boy, who does in fact play Tiny Tim, as being sick or 
handicapped in some way? And when the story is over, might the man not help him 
by offering him something to eat and an arm to help him walk? 
</P>
<P>
Still, what does come through overwhelmingly is that this is a story with its 
heart in the right place. The talented cast is a joy, from W. Francis Walters 
as a crusty bourgeois Scrooge to Kory Abosada as both Tiny Tim and the youngest 
Ebeneezer (a clever touch to help Scrooge identify with Tiny Tim), to Richard 
Soto as Scrooge's ebullient nephew, Fred. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson injects a welcome toughness to Mrs. Cratchit as well as to the part of 
first narrator (several people narrate as the book is passed from hand to 
hand), Damon Bryant lends weighty pain to Scrooge's dead partner, Jacob Marley, 
and Maggie Stewart suggests an ethereal, musty air as the gentle Ghost of 
Christmas Past. 
</P>
<P>
The contemporary squalor of the sets by Thomas Buderwitz are clever in a 
bittersweet way -- the vagrants' imagination of a feast is all wrapped up in 
buckets of Kentucky Fried Chicken and Cheez-Its, with empty soda cans 
decorating the holiday wreaths. The costumes by Catherine Meachum find common 
threads, literally, between contemporary layering of faded cloth and Victorian 
layering of the same. 
</P>
<P>
The lighting by John B. Forbes is excellent, and Schoen's direction is inspired 
except for the curious beginning in which it is not clear when the play 
actually starts. 
</P>
<P>
The play's awkward opening is redeemed by an effective ending in which it 
becomes clear that this story about Christmas does not end at the theater 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
As the theater crowds exit through a glittering, bedecked Horton Plaza, with 
the homeless stretched out not far from the pretty and upscale stores, this 
"Christmas Carol" becomes a powerful reminder of how urgently the ordinary 
person, like Mr. Scrooge, needs to learn how to keep Christmas in his heart if 
anything is to change. 
</P>
<P>
Dickens would have liked this show.

SOUTH COAST REP'S SCROOGE IS MORE GENEROUS THIS YEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
As Ebenezer Scrooge plunges headlong with the rest of us into an apparently 
nasty decade filled with omens of war and hard times, his redemption through 
generosity and kindness would seem to have a special significance. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, Hal Landon Jr. has turned serious as Charles Dickens' 
notorious miser. 
</P>
<P>
He brings a far more provocative dimension to his perennial starring role in 
South Coast Repertory's adaptation of "A Christmas Carol" than the caricature 
depicted last year.

Landon remakes Scrooge into a tragic figure of sorts, eliminating last year's 
giddy baby talk in a climactic second-act scene that trivialized the meaning of 
the play. But his deepened performance is not matched by the company. 
</P>
<P>
The romantic by-play between young Ebenezer and Belle -- one of last year's 
more appealing digressions -- is totally lost. Richard Soto is wooden as young 
Ebenezer. Lucy Rodriguez not only lacks delicacy as Belle, but manages the 
seemingly impossible feat of swallowing her words while delivering them with 
stentorian flourish. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Doyle brings the requisite joviality to the role of Fezziwig and gives 
us a bawdy, less feral portrait of the Faganesque Joe. 
</P>
<P>
The party scenes have lost some radiance, though John-David Keller's staging is 
lively and Dwight Richard Odle's costumes colorfully authentic. The technical 
pizazz is there, including special effects that elicit audience shrieks.

   The Munificent Ebenezer Scrooge

   Each Christmas season brings a new reading of Charles
Dickens's "A Christmas Carol." It would be hard to find
another plot so admired, so sympathized with and so silly in
its premise as the tale of the moral regeneration of Ebenezer
Scrooge.
   It is easy to believe that the unreformed Scrooge was a
cruel man. After all he refused to give anything to charity,
and he is represented as being abusive to his employee Bob
Cratchit. (Although in fact Scrooge treated Cratchit quite
well: Cratchit was able to live in a house, rare for the
time, and his salary supported a large family. Altogether,
Cratchit was doing well for a member of the early 19th
century lower-middle-class.)
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Dickens may have been right that Scrooge the unsaved would
have been an unhappy man. But he was very wrong to suggest
that the Scrooge who scrimped and saved before his visitation
by the Ghosts of Christmas was failing to serve society. In
fact, in the context of the 1830s, the apparent setting of
the story, Scrooge's decision not to give to charity and to
keep his capital working instead was the best contribution he
could make to the welfare of the poor.
   It is difficult to appreciate just how powerful capital
was in the early Industrial Revolution. Before
industrialization, wire for fences, package binding, nails
and other uses was made laboriously by a blacksmith. He would
first heat and pound a bar of metal to a reasonable starting
shape, maybe a half inch in diameter. Then he physically
pulled it through successfully smaller dies until the metal
was the right size. It would then be one-eighth the original
diameter and 64 times the original length.
   A large man working this way might be able to generate
about 1/20 horsepower. Now give the blacksmith a cheap and
simple five-horsepower steam engine hooked up to a
wire-drawing device. With that new power source, the
blacksmith would be able to produce roughly 100 times more
wire than an unassisted man. One or two pounds sterling
invested in an engine could thus easily produce 10 to 100
times that amount in usable goods the year after. Then the
capital so generated could be reinvested to produce thousands
the next year and so on.
   This is why dividends of 100% on speculative capital were
not uncommon in the early Industrial Revolution. And this is
why England's small initial stock of capital could so quickly
produce a vast quantity of goods.
   But the flip-side of the enormous productivity of capital
in the early Industrial Revolution was that each shilling
given to ease the celebration of Christmas by the poor meant
a pound or more that would not be available for consumption
the year after.
   So was Scrooge so very wrong to hesitate, for instance, to
provide medical help for Tiny Tim? The medicine available in
the 1830s was generally useless or worse. To quote the
historian Thomas McKeown, ". . . with the notable exception
of vaccination against smallpox {the medical cures of the
time} had no significant influence on mortality." Doctors had
only behavioral knowledge handed down from previous
generations. They knew only whether to keep lots of liquids
going into a patient, or if he should be kept extra warm or
cool, or should sweat. That, except they were good at hacking
off limbs, was about all they could do. It is ludicrous to
suggest that with money from Scrooge the Cratchits would have
been able to buy Tim a cure for multiple sclerosis or
whatever it was he suffered from.
   But by the end of the century medical care in Britain was
improving dramatically. It improved by virtue of the research
funded with capital generated by Scrooge and his ilk. It
improved because the wealth heaped up by capitalist
accumulation had built hospitals where they were needed. Not
incidentally, the roads and railroads built by other Scrooges
allowed more people to get to the medical centers. The alms
that Scrooge's nicer colleagues gave didn't help much at all.
   England was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution
from which all of us alive today benefit. The wealth
generated by that revolution finances our contemporary
welfare states. But we should remember that the Industrial
Revolution was not the product only of scientists and
engineers. The hard-headed businessmen like Ebenezer Scrooge
who took this year's output and directed it to generating
more the year after deserve no less credit.

It's easy to make this a video holiday season. Christmas videos for children 
can be inexpensive and the great majority are animated. 
</P>
<P>
Many are put together poorly with lazy animation and silly songs. There are, 
however, some grand exceptions: 
</P>
<P>
Mickey's Christmas Carol (Disney tape and disc) has become a perennial 
favorite. It is a clever adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic retelling 
the story of Ebenezer Scrooge in amusing Disney terms: Scrooge McDuck (who 
else?) is the repentant miser; Mickey Mouse is Bob Cratchit; Goofy is Marley's 
Ghost; Black Pete is the Spirit of Christmas Future. 
</P>
<P>
You can't go wrong making it a Disney video Christmas. Very Merry Christmas 
Songs (Disney tape) is a genuine crowd pleaser with Mickey and the gang singing 
12 holiday favorites including "Deck the Halls" and "The 12 Days of Christmas." 
Other Disney releases include A Disney Christmas Gift, a collection of Yuletide 
scenes from a variety of Disney's animated classics; Jiminy Cricket's 
Christmas, a celebration with Pinocchio's pint-sized conscience and his friends 
(including Mickey, Peter Pan and Snow White), and A Walt Disney Christmas, six 
vintage Disney cartoons including "The Night Before Christmas" and "Pluto's 
Christmas Tree." 
</P>
<P>
After Disney's classic animation, everything seems to go downhill, although 
some may prefer the bite of Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas, a 
faithful adaptation of the children's classic (MGM/UA tape). 
</P>
<P>
There's also a collection of seven classic cartoons from the 1930s and '40s 
called Christmas Comes but Once a Year (Shokus tape, less than $13), including 
"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer." A vintage 1952 "Howdy Doody" TV program, in 
which Howdy and Clarabell rescue Santa Claus on Christmas Eve, is an added 
bonus. 
</P>
<P>
Don't dismiss other feature-length cartoons because the animation seems 
amateurish next to the Disney product. Some are worth your children's time: 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol (Paramount tape) is an unexpectedly superior 
adaptation of the Dickens tale with an original musical score by Jule Styne. 
This animated special should keep you and your children satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
George and the Christmas Star (Paramount tape) is an amusing story about a 
lonely man who wants to get a star out of the sky for his Christmas tree and 
comes back with a lot more than that, including the gift of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
A Charlie Brown Christmas (HiTops tape) is one of the popular TV productions 
based on Charles Schulz's cartoon strip. Poor Charlie Brown will make any child 
feel good about being him or herself. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas on Sesame Street (Random House tape) Big Bird, Bert, Ernie and the 
rest of the gang offer intelligent commentary, and there is a surprisingly 
moving adaptation of O'Henry's classic Christmas story "The Gift of the Magi." 
</P>
<P>
You're on your own with many animated specials featuring familiar cartoon 
characters (listed below). Only choose them if your children are particular 
fans of the character. Forget any of the others. 
</P>
<P>
"Casper's First Christmas" (Worldvision tape) has the friendly ghost joined by 
Yogi Bear, Boo Boo and Huckleberry Hound; "The Berenstein Bears' Christmas 
Tree" (Nelson tape) is typical stuff with Papa Bear trying to find the perfect 
tree; "Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Great Santa Claus Caper" (MPI tape); 
"B.C.-A Special Christmas" (Nelson tape) lives up to the cartoon strip's 
potential; "Glo Friends Save Christmas" (Vestron tape) is pretty routine stuff 
only for those who bought the toys featured in the made-for-TV special; 
"Christmas Comes to Pac-Land" (Goodtimes) has Pac-Man helping Santa Claus; 
"Rudolph's and Frosty's Christmas in July," "Frosty's Winter Wonderland and the 
Leprechaun's Gold" and "Rudolph's Shiny New Year" (Lightning Vestron tape) 
feature the Red-Nosed Reindeer and the Snowman in pretty silly stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Other animated videos: "Silent Night" and "The Night Before Christmas" with the 
voices of the Obendorf Boys Choir (Media tape); "Pinocchio's Christmas" 
(Vestron tape) features the voice of Alan King; "Christmastime for Teddy 
Bears," a read-along video musical; "A Star for Jeremy" (Lorimar tape) explains 
why there is a star at the top of Christmas trees; "Snow White Christmas" 
(Prism tape) brings back a poorly animated Snow White who battles a poorly 
animated Evil -ueen so the kingdom can have a Merry Christmas; Calvin, Santa's 
elf, stars in "Santa's Christmas Elf" (United Entertainment tape); "A Christmas 
Tree" and "Puss-'n'-Boots" (Prism tape) and "Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny" 
(United Entertainment tape) are more of the same. 
</P>
<P>
If you are looking for the perfect Christmas present, one that reaffirms the 
closeness of family in the best holiday tradition, then there is really only 
one to choose: A Child's Christmas in Wales (Vestron tape). This is a 
sensitive, intelligent rendering of the Dylan Thomas memoir of a Christmas Eve 
spent with parents and grandfather. Denholm Elliott is a perfect guide, and the 
cast captures Thomas' words and memories with special grace and tender ness. 
It's a home video present for the entire family to view during the holidays 
because it affirms values of family, love and the spirit of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Another live-action Christmas video is Shari's Christmas Concert (Fries tape). 
This is a one-woman tour de force by ventriloquist Shari Lewis (with an 
important assist from puppet Lamb Chop). If adults sometimes believe that Lewis 
seems at times to suffer from a terminal case of cuteness, children still adore 
her. JOE SALTZMAN

South Coast Repertory has transformed the time-encrusted mythology of "A 
Christmas Carol" into a sprightly, well-turned comedy with an Ebenezer Scrooge 
who doesn't have a mean bone in his body. 
</P>
<P>
Scrooge is a penny-pinching grumbler, of course. And virtually everybody on 
stage either says he's a meanie or treats him like one. But we don't believe it 
for a minute. We're not meant to. Not in this version. For no matter how bony 
Scrooge's face, how chilly his words, how miserly his deeds, Scrooge is a 
comic. This news should come as no surprise to SCR regulars. Hal Landon Jr. has 
played him this way every year since 1980, and John-David Keller has directed 
the show for as many silly laughs as it can get. 
</P>
<P>
The result happens to be highly entertaining, especially for a family audience. 
But it is not Dickens. It misses the pathos of the story and its emotional 
impact. Furthermore, while Jerry Patch's adaptation conveys the basic message 
that kindness and charity are to be valued, the moral of the story is 
dangerously oversimplified. 
</P>
<P>
Every kid in the audience, and probably some parents, may well be persuaded 
that the inverse of the moral is true. By play's end, Scrooge discovers that 
money is the root of all good, as long as he gives it away. Money buys love. 
Money buys happiness. Money, more than generosity, remains his form of 
salvation. 
</P>
<P>
However, there can be no faulting the production for its liveliness, freshness 
and technical polish. It moves swiftly, yet without sacrificing too much 
detail. The acting is crisp and particular. Party scenes are radiant, with 
minor roles filled out beautifully. The music is warm, the costumes authentic. 
And the special effects, while vivid, are not overplayed. 
</P>
<P>
Above all, this "Christmas Carol" has the great virtue of not being boring, 
which cannot be said for many cultural rites of passage. It certainly works as 
a first taste of theater and may whet a child's appetite for the real Dickens. 
</P>

<MEMO>  Also ran in EX4/1  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In an age when the spirit of Christmas can get lost in hectic shopping
trips, made-for-television specials and a bombardment of commercials,
Northside Theatre Company director Richard Orlando sees himself as a purist.; 
 This year's production of the classic "A Christmas Carol" aims for the
essence of Dickens. "It's pure," says Orlando. "We treat the play as a
Christmas ghost story.";   One of the main reasons for preserving the original
intent of the play is to educate the public about the world of Dickens.;   In
other words, this is no cheery song-and-dance Christmas pageant. It's the
story of 19th-century London complete with plague and poverty, Orlando said.
And there's enough fog, eerie music, trap door entrances, ghosts and
graveyards to scare the Dickens out of you.;   Dockworkers and common folk on
the waterfront tell the story of the miser who gets a lesson in giving. "It's
never been told that way before from the community," Orlando says. In the
sparse, wood scaffolding of the dock set, barrels become desks, the dock
becomes Scrooge's bedroom.;   The 19-member cast -- through a series of quick
changes -- handles the play's 50 roles. Many cast members are returning from
last year's production.;   This will be the eighth season that the Northside
company has performed "A Christmas Carol." Orlando said the play has survived
because it is as applicable to London of long ago, as it is to 20th- century
San Jose. "We get caught up in the commercial aspects of Christmas, going to
the mall, buying presents. In the play it talks about giving time, listening,"
Orlando says.;   It is also a play about community.;   "Scrooge is alone, he
is isolated from the first," Orlando said. "It is all about being involved in
where you live and being involved in your community.;   "We have so much
diversity in this community but everybody has their own pigeon hole," he said.
"('A Christmas Carol') says get out and do it. Have some fun and be
involved.";   Back at rehearsal, Christensen huddled over a tombstone and
continued with Scrooge's pleas. While specters spring up from behind Scrooge's
grave and haunting music swirls in the background Scrooge cries out: "Oh, tell
me that I may sponge away the writing from this stone.";   Of course, we know
the stone comes clean and Scrooge gets a second chance to keep the spirit of
Christmas alive in his heart all year -- or at least until next Christmas
season.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The play runs Thursdays through Sundays from
Dec. 5 through 29 at the Olinder Theater, 848 E. William St. Tickets can be
ordered by calling (408) 288-7820.  </TEXT>

Patrick Stewart cautions his public in the program: Don't expect ornamentation. 
No Christmas fog, no visible ghosts of Christmases Past, Present or Future. 
</P>
<P>
No Tiny Tim, no warm Christmas fires. 
</P>
<P>
This perennial one-man reading of "A Christmas Carol" is furnished strictly by 
the vigor of Charles Dickens' words, the distinctive characterizations 
delivered by Stewart's reading of them -- and by the tricks they play on our 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart, who is a Royal Shakespeare Company stalwart (now known to larger 
audiences as Captain Jean-Luc Picard on TV's "Star Trek: The Next Generation") 
expertly calibrates his reading. 
</P>
<P>
In black suit and white shirt, he creates a world with a desk and a chair -- 
slicing the air with the pages of his script, grousing as the diffident 
Scrooge, snarling as the furtive one, bursting into wrenching sobs as Bob 
Cratchit, breaking our hearts as Tiny Tim and chuckling with uncontrollable 
glee as the rehabilitated old miser. 
</P>
<P>
It all works. The bleakness of Dickens' rigorous imagery and suspense, in 
collusion with the actor's virtuosity, even in as familiar a story as this, 
keeps us surprisingly close to the edge of our seats.

FT  12 NOV 92 / Arts: A Christmas Carol - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christopher Gable has, with considerable acumen, studied the balletic
market, and identified an audience need. That need is for lively drama,
well-known themes, dance as an undemanding aspect of entertainment, and a
denial of the supposedly forbidding aspects of ballet. And this is what he
has very astutely set his company, Northern Ballet Theatre, to provide.
There is no call for critical sniffiness when faced with such populist
tactics. Mr and Mrs Smith enjoy Eldorado, Richard Clayderman, Jeffrey
Archer's writings and the umpteenth revival of Sound of Music, and their
lives are made happier thereby. Why not, then, ballets whose appeal is as
immediate? That, in the process, an art can be reduced to its lowest common
denominators is no news.
Comment is necessary when, as with last week's Swan Lake, a major work is
transmogrified for the unlikely cause of 'poetic truth', and a critic is
entitled to carp. But what Gable offers with the Christmas Carol receiving
its London premiere this week, is solid, jolly entertainment. I may deplore
Massimo Moricone's deadly choreography for A Christmas Carol, as for NBT's
Romeo, yet Gable's company works with enthusiasm, touches its public's
heart, and the staging is expertly done.
A Christmas Carol boasts a cast-iron title, sentiment, and the best of
plots. Its theme invites - and, by Heaven, it gets - a score from Carl Davis
replete with carols everyone knows - and would probably like to hum-along
with. The cast sing them, and there can't be a dry eye in the house when
Tiny Tim gives us 'How far is it to Bethlehem'. To the staging's great
credit, the narrative is everywhere responsive to the original. And it
boasts, in Lez Brotherstone's design, a dazzling and imaginative re-creation
of Scrooge's world. The stage picture is on two levels - an upper walk
offering something like High Holborn, with a distant foggy prospect of St.
Paul's. Below, scenery opens out to show us Scrooge's counting house, the
Cratchit home, and every locale specified by Dickens. Costuming is no less
apt. On these terms alone, the production is a huge success, and
Brotherstone's work notably fine.
What Gable has done is no less remarkable. The story is surely told, vivid,
and aimed straight at the heart - as Dickens alone knew how. (Ah, the tiny
abandoned crutch on the stair; and Ho-ho, the Cratchit family preparing to
feast upon a well-developed starling). The dance is mere chit-chat of steps,
and at moments - a solo for Christmas Past; a duet for the Young Scrooge and
his lost love - numbingly awkward. Carl Davis' score, when it departs from
traditional tunes, is brash, to say the least. To say the most, it is
efficient. But A Christmas Carol does not pretend to be a ballet - in the
sense that another populist work, David Bintley's Hobson's Choice, relies
upon choreographic means alone for its attraction and its dramatic effects.
Gable proposes a form of music-theatre for dancers, of ingratiating and
unrelenting emotionalism, in which song, dance, mimetic drama all have a
part. The piece's flaw is that Scrooge (well taken by Jeremy Kerridge) is
not interesting enough as a peg on which to hang the staging. Christmas
itself is the hero, pervasive in Dickens, but unfocussed as an excuse for
dance-drama. Of course, A Christmas Carol may worry purists - though Lez
Brotherstone's triumphant designs should be seen by anyone interested in the
theatre. But Mr and Mrs Smith will love it.

   The film world has long been fascinated with
the yuletide season.
   Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol,'' the time-worn tale of
Scrooge and Tiny Tim, may well be the most recurrent of the
Christmas movies. It appeared in several versions during the silent
era, then MGM made a 1938 ``A Christmas Carol'' with Reginald Owen
as Scrooge. In 1951, the English did their own version with
Alistair Sims as the legendary penny-pincher (the British had done
an undistinguished ``Scrooge'' in 1935).
   Albert Finney was unrecognizable in the title role of the 1970
``Scrooge,'' and a recent version starring George C. Scott has
become a television perennial. A couple of years ago, the Walt
Disney company enlisted all of its cartoon stars for a featurette
``Mickey's Christmas Carol.''
   The song ``White Christmas,'' sung by Bing Crosby in the 1942
film, ``Holiday Inn,'' became Irving Berlin's greatest hit and
resulted in the 1954 movie, ``White Christmas.''
   Frank Capra's unabashed sentiment often resulted in Christmas
scenes, notably in ``Meet John Doe'' and ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
The latter shows up regularly on holiday television.
   Oddly, most films with ``Christmas'' in the title have fared
poorly at the box office.
   ``The Christmas Tree,'' starring William Holden and Virna Lisi,
was a 1969 bomb.
   In 1944, Universal cast its biggest star, Deanna Durbin, in a
grim melodrama with Gene Kelly, ``Christmas Holiday.'' Audiences
voted overwhelmingly for Deanna to return to musicals.
   Other misfires: ``Christmas Eve,'' three wayward sons (George
Raft, Randolph Scott, George Brent) return to their mother (Ann
Harding) for the holiday (1944); ``Christmas in July,'' a tame
satire of the advertising industry by Preston Sturges (1940);
``Christmas in July,'' a soap opera with Barbara Stanwyck and
Dennis Morgan (1945).
   Disney had little luck with ``One Magic Christmas,'' a
Capra-esque fantasy starring Mary Steenburgen and Harry Dean
Stanton.
   The producers of ``Superman'' thought they would have another
box-office bonanza with a big-budget ``Santa Claus: The Movie,''
starring David Huddleston in the title role and Dudley Moore as
chief elf. They thought wrong. The film was the turkey of 1985.
   The most successful film about Christmas has been George
Seaton's ``Miracle on 34th Street,'' starring Edmund Gwenn as a
department store Santa Claus who claims to be the real thing. The
film, which also starred Maureen O'Hara, John Payne and a young
Natalie Wood, has become a television perennial and has now been
colorized _ much to the distress of purists.
   Some other films featuring Christmas: ``The Holly and the Ivy''
(1952), ``The Inn of the Sixth Happiness'' (1958), ``The Bells of
St. Mary's'' (1945), ``The Man Who Came to Dinner'' (1941), ``Young
at Heart'' (1954), ``The Apartment'' (1960), ``The Glenn Miller
Story'' (1954), Not to mention ``Santa Claus Conquers the
Martians'' (1980).

   Scrooges in Chautauqua County are about to
be visited by a modern day recreation of Charles Dickens' Spirit of
Christmas.
   Charles Ferraro, county commissioner of social services, has
compiled the names of 1,000 people who owe a total of $5.7 million
in overdue payments for child and family support.
   Ferraro's ``SCROOGE'' list _ Support Children, Remember
Obligations, Or Get Embarrassed _ will appear Dec. 20 in full page
advertisements in the county's two daily newspapers.
   ``It just made so much sense when you think about the story of
Scrooge and how in the end, he realized what he was doing and turned
out to be the good guy,'' Ferraro said. ``We are hoping that will
happen to a lot of these people.'' The penny-pinching Ebenezer
Scrooge finally got the Christmas spirit in ``A Christmas Carol''
and helped Tiny Tim and his family.
   Reaction from some of the delinquent parents, who have been
warned in a series of letters, ranged from anger to threats of
lawsuits, Ferraro said.
   ``Its rather amazing to me that a man who can't pay his child
support can afford to hire a lawyer to sue me,'' he said.
   The pay or publicity tactic has social service commissioners in
other counties waiting expectantly, he said. ``We've had many
inquires from other commissioners, and some of them have already
committed themselves to doing the same thing next year.''
   Judy Lamb, head of the Western New York Coalition of Women for
Child Support, said the idea was ``terrific.''
   ``It can take years to get a non-custodial parent to make support
payments, and if a woman decides to resort to a request for
incarceration for the delinquent father, it can take two to three
years before a hearing officer will even make a recommendation for
incarceration,'' Ms. Lamb said.
   Ferraro said the plan was conceived a year ago after he noticed
that overdue payments were increasing each year.
   The idea to print the names was an offshoot of the county's
practice of publishing names of delinquent property taxpayers and
the idea of SCROOGE popped up with a Christmas target date, he said.

   ``My last crime was a Christmas crime,'' arch thief Flambeau
confesses to G.K. Chesterton's Father Brown, ``a cheery, cosy,
English middle-class crime, a crime of Charles Dickens. I did it in
a good old middle-class house near Putney, a house with a crescent
of a carriage drive, a house with a stable by the side of it, a
house with a name on the two outer gates...Enough, you know the
species.''
   The eager Christmas reading public certainly knew the species.
They had been conditioned to it by decades of ghosts haunting the
pages of the Christmas annuals and special gift books, often
sponsored by royalty, that were a matter of pride and profit to
authors and publishers from Victorian times down to the end of World
War II when TV became the main medium, so to speak, for encounters
of the spectral kind.
   These expensively bound and strikingly illustrated volumes had
names like Yule Logs, Christmas Blossoms, Winter's Wreath, Queen
Mary's Gift Book, Christmas Box, Princess Alexandra's Gift Book,
Beeton's Christmas Annual, the Snowflake, Longmans' Annual and St.
Nicholas, which its Boston publishers avowed was ``a Christmas and
New Year's gift made expressly under the direction of St. Nicholas
for all good little girls and boys.''
   In 1834, almost a decade before Scrooge pronounced Christmas a
humbug, there were 63 competing annuals on sale in London, some
running to 450 pages.
   ``These sold at an upscale, enhanced price, so the writers'
market definitely improved at Christmas,'' said Charles Benson,
curator of rare books at Dublin's Trinity College Library. In his
cubicle of an office looking down on the vaulted reading room where
Lord Dunsany and Elizabeth Bowen conjured up their Christmas ghosts
and where the 8th century Book of Kells is on display, Benson spread
out several editions of Beeton's and Longmans' annuals dating back
to l870s.
   ``The enormous demand for these gift books coincided with the
rapid rise in literacy throughout Europe,'' the curator went on.
``Prominently placed on the living room table, they proclaimed both
the giver and the recipient to be people of some culture.''
   Sherlock Holmes made his first appearance in ``A Study in
Scarlet'' in Beeton's 1887 Christmas annual. Author A. Conan Doyle
said the title recognized ``the scarlet thread of murder running
through the colorless skein of life.''
   Edgar Allen Poe and Mary Shelley, creator of Frankenstein,
frequently contributed to gift books. Hawthorne raised his earliest
Puritan phantoms in the pages of The Token and Goodrich's Annual.
   Ghosts ``began to disappear when electricity came in,'' lamented
librarian Benson. ``You seldom get a dark countryside now, those
lonely stretches of road lined with skeletal trees, with mist rising
from the bogs and the fields shrouded in snow, all so essential for
contacting the beyond. Christmas then was a time for ghosts because
as the days grew shorter, the peasants and the landed gentry had
more leisure to swap tales around their fires. Life was short and
precarious. People were much closer to death and the spirit world.''
   Ghost stories are for telling aloud as well as reading, as
Dickens soon discovered to his pleasure and profit. A consummate
actor, he took Scrooge on the road. An overflow crowd of 4,000
turned up at Bradford's Mechanics Institute for his three-hour
stage-cut reading of ``A Christmas Carol,'' and 2,000 jammed into
Birmingham's town hall. A new career and a new tradition were
launched.
   On the night before Christmas at Hyde Park, Franklin D. Roosevelt
always read ``A Christmas Carol'' aloud to the family, acting out
all the parts. Banker J.P. Morgan bought the original Dickens
manuscript and like the born-again Scrooge, ``merry as a
schoolboy,'' had his secretary read it to him each Christmas Eve.
   Cambridge don M.R. James, a learned antiquary and translator of
New Testament apocrypha, read aloud his devilishly clever ghost
stories to friends at King's College every Christmas Eve for more
than three decades, beginning in 1894. As provost of Eton College,
he concocted many of his holiday horrors for the small boys in his
charge and wrote ``The Haunted Dolls House'' specifically ``for the
library of Her Majesty the Queen's Dolls' House.''
   American novelist and global railway chronicler Paul Theroux, who
lives in London, has kept alive this haunting holiday tradition.
Every year when his boys Marcel and Louis were growing up, he wrote
and read to them over three nights a ghost story, ``leaving the
hammer stroke for Christmas Eve.''
   Like Dickens' urchins peeking through the frosted panes of the
bakery, the audience of two was allowed to window-shop for the
ingredients. Their requirements: a scary ghost, lots of snow, a
London setting, a happy ending and, ``Oh yes, please put a cat in.''
   At Hardscribble House in rural Connecticut, where this is being
hand-crafted at a wobbly Victorian stand-up writing desk, we refuse
to let old spooks lie. Ghost stories are always told over a flagon
of smoking bishop or hot purl, the lady of the house being from
Ireland where spectral visitors outnumber poor relations around the
fireside at Christmas. And our guest room is seasonally haunted by
the mournful whistle and dull headlight glow of a long vanished
Lionel model train set endlessly circling beneath the bed on rusty
rails.
   Or could it be the rats from the graveyard across the road
scratching out winter quarters beneath the floorboards and
occasionally venturing out to search for food with those baleful
eyes?

<TEXT>
   ``Scrooged,'' the retelling of the Charles
Dickens Christmas classic starring comedian Bill Murray, opened to
huge box-office business in the first big week of holiday movie
going.
   According to preliminary figures released Monday by Exhibitor
Relations Co., ``Scrooged'' collected $13 million during the
weekend, easily topping second-place finisher ``The Land Before
Time.''
   ``Scrooged,'' based on Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol,'' was
greeted coolly by critics, but set a record for the best five-day
Thanksgiving opening ($18.5 million) for a non-sequel movie. All
box-office proceeds, in fact, were significantly higher than last
weekend, thanks to the holiday and a flurry of new releases.
   ``The Land Before Time,'' which a week ago enjoyed the best
opening ever for an animated film, collected $8.1 million. The film
tells the story of a baby brontosaurus' dangerous journey through a
prehistoric world.
   Another animated movie, ``Oliver and Co.,'' finished third, up a
notch from last week. ``Oliver and Co.,'' employing a variety of
celebrity voices for the tale of a homeless kitten, grossed $6.3
million. The story was inspired by another Dickens tale, ``Oliver
Twist.''
   Debuting at No. 4 was the sequel ``Cocoon: The Return,'' an
updated look at a group of senior citizens enjoying everlasting
youth, with revenues of $5.6 million. It was followed by ``Ernest
Saves Christmas,'' in which an oddball cab driver (Jim Varney) saves
the holidays by driving Santa's sleigh. The movie had sales of $5.2
million.
   The horror movie ``Child's Play,'' featuring a homicidal doll on
the rampage, finished sixth with $4.6 million in sales. ``High
Spirits,'' starring Peter O'Toole as the proprietor of a
ghost-infested Irish castle, ended up seventh with receipts of $2
million.
   In eighth place was ``The Accused,'' starring Jodie Foster and
Kelly McGillis, with sales of $1.6 million. Rounding out the Top 10
were ``Fresh Horses,'' with Molly Ringwald, collecting $1.55 million
in ninth and ``Iron Eagle II,'' starring Louis Gossett, with a
reported gross of $1.35 million in 10th.
   The holiday film season continues to expand this week, with ``The
Naked Gun'' and ``Tequila Sunrise'' opening on Friday.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen for the weekend, total gross and number
of weeks in release. Total grosses include all days of release from
last Wednesday.
   1. ``Scrooged,'' Paramount, $13 million, 1,262 screens, $10,323
per screen, $18.5 million, one week.
   2. ``The Land Before Time,'' Universal, $8.1 million, 1,410
screens, $5,755 per screen, $18.5 million, two weeks.
   3. ``Oliver and Co.,'' Disney, $6.3 million, 952 screens, $6,658
per screen, $12 million, two weeks.
   4. ``Cocoon: The Return,'' 20th Century Fox, $5.6 million, 986
screens, $5,647 per screen, $7.7 million, one week.
   5. ``Ernest Saves Christmas,'' Disney, $5.2 million, 1,640
screens, $3,181 per screen, $6.4 million, three weeks.
   6. ``Child's Play,'' United Artists, $4.6 million, 1,490 screens,
$3,106 per screen, $22 million, three weeks.
   7. ``High Spirits,'' Tri-Star, $2 million, 826 screens, $2,446
per screen, $6.3 million, two weeks.
   8. ``The Accused,'' Paramount, $1.6 million, 851 screens, $1,880
per screen, $26.6 million, seven weeks.
   9. ``Fresh Horses,'' Weintraub, $1.55 million, 1,276 screens,
$2,446 per screen, $5.7 million, two weeks.
   10. ``Iron Eagle II,'' Tri-Star, $1.35 million, 877 screens,

<LEADPARA>  MY DEAR Miss Fezziwig,;   How delightful to hear from you! Uncle Ebenezer is
still grateful for your appearance at the sanity hearing after the publication
of Mr. Dickens' rather sensational report. I know that the testimony of one my
uncle knew in his youth helped sway the jury, although I agree that Mr.
Dershowitz's putting young Timothy Cratchit on the stand was the masterstroke.
I only wish that the shareholders in Scrooge &amp; Marley had been more forgiving,
but I must admit that the firm is doing splendidly under the leadership of Bob
Cratchit. (I suppose we must now call him "Sir Robert.")  </LEADPARA>

COULD LIKE

<TEXT>     To respond to your inquiry: I know that Uncle Ebenezer would be grateful
for anything you might wish to send him this Christmas, but your suggestion of
a book seems most appropriate. My uncle's library is quite small. During the
years in which he was involved with Scrooge &amp; Marley, he accumulated very few
volumes. He recently donated a well-thumbed copy of "Trump: The Art of the
Deal" to the jumble sale held by the Widows and Orphans Fund. I fear that
neither it nor the portrait of Mrs. Thatcher he also donated found a taker,
and I discovered afterward that he had consigned them both to the dustbin.;  
As you know, Uncle Ebenezer has become a friend to humankind, so I should
think that the handsome new volume The Circle of Life: Rituals From the Human
Family Album (HarperSanFrancisco, 240 pp., $39.95) would be of great interest
to him. It documents the rituals of birth and childhood, initiation and
adolescence, marriage and adulthood, death and remembrance in cultures around
the world. This is one of those books in which photographs loom larger than
text, although the text is impressive: The introduction is by Gabriel Garcia
Marquez, the afterword by Peter Matthiessen.;   As Uncle Ebenezer has gone
about in the world more, his circle of friends has widened. (Sometimes, I
fear, to his detriment: I'm sure you know that there was never any truth in
the report in the National Enquirer about the relationship between my uncle
and Mrs. Helmsley. They met when Mr. Dershowitz introduced them, and perhaps
my uncle's sincere concern that the lady see that amiability is preferable to
meanness was misinterpreted by observers.) Be that as it may, I think my uncle
might well like one of the two anthologies on the subject of friendship that
appeared this year.;   The Oxford Book of Friendship (Oxford, 364 pp., $24.95)
contains readings on the topic from many sources -- letters, essays, journals,
fiction, poetry and drama, the Bible and the Epic of Gilgamesh -- and many
authors, from Aristotle to Cole Porter. However, the selections are quite
brief, making it a book perhaps more suitable for after-dinner speakers and
authors in search of the apt quotation than for the general reader.;   The
Norton Book of Friendship  (Norton, 608 pp., $25) is a book more likely to be
read by the fireside and shared with a companion. Its editors, Eudora Welty
and Ronald A. Sharp, prefer not to excerpt but to reprint entire texts, so
they don't include passages from novels. The volume begins with a section of
"Invitations" (primarily to dine, including a charming passage about Colette's
mother and a spider who loved chocolate), proceeds to essays (such as Cicero's
"On Friendship," the bane of Latin students), letters (wonderful ones by
Keats), poems, legends and folktales, and concludes with "Farewells"
(appropriately, Robert Burns' "Auld Lang Syne" is the last entry).;   You
inquired if Uncle Ebenezer still clings to the notion that his remarkable
change in character was effected by supernatural agentry. Alas, I fear that it
is so. But it will do no harm to provide him with a few volumes on the
subject. Perhaps the improbable tales of others might convince him that his
experiences were indeed the result of "an undigested bit of beef.";   I am
certain, then, that he would enjoy Victorian Ghost Stories: An Oxford
Anthology  (Oxford University Press, 497 pp., $24.95). It contains tales by
Henry James, Wilkie Collins, Robert Louis Stevenson, Rudyard Kipling and
others (including the ubiquitous Mr. Dickens -- though not, one may be
grateful, his story about my uncle).;   There is apparently no end to the
vogue for such tales. Witness The Literary Ghost: Great Contemporary Ghost
Stories  (Atlantic Monthly Press, 369 pp., $22.95), by such writers as M.F.K.
Fisher, Joyce Carol Oates, Graham Greene, Nadine Gordimer and Isaac Bashevis
Singer. Although these are a cut above the works of Stephen King, they are
rather more likely to bring a blush to the maiden cheek than the ones by the
Victorians. However, Uncle Ebenezer is not squeamish (especially after having
been transported to the site of his own grave!).;   My uncle also delights in
narrating his experiences to the Cratchit children, so perhaps he would
appreciate The Random House Book of Ghost Stories  (Random House, 223 pp.,
$18.95), which is designed for children. The ghosts in these stories are
rather more benign than those in the other volumes. I was particularly struck
by the tale "Laughter in the Dark," by Leon Garfield, which tells of how a
ghost thwarted the aims of a miserly old man. One wonders if ghosts have been
at work of late on Wall Street.;    As you knew Uncle Ebenezer in his school
days, you know how he delighted in Don Quixote, Gulliver's Travels, Tom Jones
and Tristram Shandy as a youth. No doubt he would like some of these volumes
in the hardcover editions that have lately been issued by Alfred A. Knopf in
its Everyman's Library series and by Random House as Modern Library editions.
I myself owned many volumes of the Everyman's Library and the Modern Library
in my youth -- they are far more durable than the paperback editions one
accumulates today, and I am delighted to see the series being revived.
(However, I seem to recall paying much less for such books in my youth than
the $15 to $20 that these cost.) The Everyman's titles range from John Donne's
poems to Pasternak's "Dr. Zhivago." The Modern Library, as its name suggests,
is still more modern, including Borges and Jerzy Kosinski and Philip Roth
among the works of Aristotle and Plato and Plutarch.;   My uncle's well-known
love of the Christmas season makes A New Christmas Treasury  (Viking, 532 pp.,
$25) a most suitable book for him. It contains many of the most familiar works
associated with Christmas -- O. Henry's "Gifts of the Magi," Clement C.
Moore's "A Visit From St. Nicholas," the letter assuring Virginia O'Hanlon
that, yes, there is a Santa Claus -- as well as works by Hans Christian
Andersen, J.M. Barrie, Willa Cather, Robert Louis Stevenson, James Thurber and
Laura Ingalls Wilder, among many others. There are also selections by people
one certainly doesn't associate with Christmas: Truman Capote, John Cheever,
Thomas Hardy, James Joyce, H. L. Mencken and even Feodor Dostoevski. But I
fear that the volume's editor, Mr. Jack Newcombe, is under the misapprehension
that, as he writes, "Dickens . . . seemed to embody the very spirit of the
season." Humbug! say I. It is otherwise a most satisfactory volume.;   The
Clement C. Moore poem included in Mr. Newcombe's treasury is the subject of an
entire volume, The Annotated Night Before Christmas,  edited by Martin Gardner
(Summit Books, 253 pp., $20). Mr. Gardner has previously given us his glosses
on the text of Lewis Carroll's works in "The Annotated Alice" and "The
Annotated Snark." There is in fact little to explicate in the Moore poem,
although presumably very young Americans do not know what sugarplums are, so
Mr. Gardner explains that they are not really plums. Most of the book is given
over to some of the countless parodies of the Moore poem. Thus, one finds "A
Visit From Jack Nicklaus," "A Visit From St. Nicholson" (Jack, that is), "A
Visit From Sid Vicious" and even "A Visit From Saint Woz" (Steve Wozniak,
whose name Mr. Gardner misspells). There are parodies from Mad magazine and
from the New York magazine competition, and some dialect parodies that are
just barely on the safe side of political correctness. A very amusing book if
taken in small doses.;   And finally, I might suggest The Frugal Gourmet
Celebrates Christmas,  by Jeff Smith (Morrow, 297 pp., $25). Uncle Ebenezer is
frugal only in his personal expenditures these days. His generosity was sorely
taxed by the requests for aid that followed the "60 Minutes" profile and the
article in People. The volume of requests was so great that he accepted my
offer to process them. I forwarded most of them to Mr. Percy Ross. The Frugal
Gourmet's cookery book is filled with Christmas and Hanukkah feasting lore --
indeed the photographs alone are a feast in themselves. And it will enable
Uncle Ebenezer to prepare a roast goose dinner -- described, alas, as worthy
of Dickens! -- that will spare his purse for more charitable uses.;   I hope
that this has been of some use to you, dear Miss Fezziwig. A very merry
Christmas to you, and God Bless Us, Every One!; Affectionately,; Fred  </TEXT>

<P>
From "Pee-Wee's Playhouse" in New York to "Scrooge" in Yorba Linda? 
</P>
<P>
Some might see that as a leap from the extraordinary to the prosaic, but not 
Jeff Raum. He sees the Yorba Linda Civic Light Opera's production of "Scrooge," 
which opens Tuesday, as an opportunity to tap into two sides of his creativity 
at once. The artist who helped develop the surreal environs of television's 
"Playhouse" will perform the title role in the musical production and will 
create the character's distinctive look. 
</P>
<P>
Raum, 30, has done makeup and theatrical design, mostly in New York, for 
several years. Besides transforming a studio into Pee-Wee's playhouse, he 
helped devise much of the elaborate makeup for two major Broadway shows, "I'm 
Not Rappaport" and "Into the Woods." 
</P>
<P>
The Van Nuys resident manages a company that executes murals, trompe l'oeil and 
other faux finishes for homes and businesses. But he still does occasional 
stage projects. "I just thought ("Scrooge") would be a lot of fun, getting the 
chance to be both a visual artist and a performing artist," he said. "It has 
been great, but a lot of work, too." 
</P>
<P>
Raum spends as much as two hours turning himself from a nice young guy into one 
of the world's sturdiest symbols of mendacity. It takes time to get the 
prosthetic nose just right, then there's the wig to deal with. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The makeup requires a patient hand and attention to detail. "At one point, I go 
out into the audience, so it has to look authentic and hold up to close 
scrutiny. The demands are there," he said. "You can't take it casually." 
</P>
<P>
But the payoff, he continued, is not only a convincing appearance but a 
resonance that the makeup helps bring to his performance. "I really feel my 
personality changing . . . it really clicks when I get the makeup and clothes 
on and feel the character coming through. People have said I'm different during 
dress rehearsals, more real and vivid." 
</P>
<P>
This isn't Raum's first acting role. Although he started feeling early on that 
his talents are more on the technical side, he has acted since high school in 
Cockeysville, a suburb of Baltimore, in professional as well as amateur 
productions of "The Dresser," "A Man for All Seasons," "Twelfth Night" and "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream." 
</P>
<P>
His approach to "Scrooge" is straightforward. "I play him pretty traditionally, 
much the way Dickens' describes him. People go to the show not expecting to see 
something new; they go to see an old friend, so I don't deviate too much from 
what the audience expects." 
</P>
<P>
After graduating from the University of Dayton in 1983 with an art degree, Raum 
worked briefly for an advertising firm in Washington, D.C., before moving to 
New York City to join Broadcast Arts, which developed animated television 
commercials and "Pee-Wee's Playhouse." 
</P>
<P>
Though he didn't get a chance to work with Pee-Wee himself, Raum found the 
"Playhouse" job to be a real hoot. "I designed some of the characters, like the 
dinosaur family, the magic screen, Globey and a few others. . . . I enjoyed it 
because it was so off the wall, there was a lot of freedom in the approach." 
</P>
<P>
Raum described his work on "Into the Woods" and "I'm Not Rappaport" as exciting 
and demanding. For "Woods," he applied the makeup for the witch, Rapunzel, the 
wolf and several other key characters; for "Rappaport" he helped age actor Hal 
Linden by about 20 years.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Everybody knows the ghost of Christmas past in
Charles Dickens' ``A Christmas Carol,'' but less celebrated spooks
have haunted the season for a long time. Here's an account of their
ectoplasmic activities.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>

<BYLINE>By HUGH A. MULLIGAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Long before and long after Jacob Marley rattled his rosary of
cash boxes, keys and padlocks at Ebenezer Scrooge, a Christmas
ghost, more surely than Santa, would appear at the fireside of many
a stately home and country inn.
   Holiday guests overstuffed with roast goose and mulled port were
less likely to be dreaming of a white Christmas than having
nightmares about graveyard rats gnawing at the tree ornaments or
goblins kidnapping a church sexton.
   That matter of the vanishing verger was Charles Dickens's first
published Christmas ghost story, inspired by a bedtime tale told by
Mary Weller, the Dickens family nursemaid. She filled his
imagination with the phantoms of evil innkeepers making sausage pies
out of complaining guests and hapless travelers terribly tortured by
rats _ phantoms that reappeared in his annual tales to trim the tree
by.
   Mary herself reappeared in ``The Holly Tree,'' that snowbound inn
on the Yorkshire moors where the storyteller at the fireside reaches
back to the nursery and finds himself ``at the knee of a sallow
woman with a fishy eye, an aquiline nose, and a green gown, whose
specialty was a dismal narrative of a landlord whose visitors
unaccountably disappeared...''
   Your genial host at this early variant of the Bates Motel stole
into the guest rooms by a secret passage, slit their throats then
dispatched the bodies down a trap door to copper cauldrons bubbling
below.
   The pie maker was undone, as Dickens respun the cobwebs of his
childhood, when overheard muttering ``too much pepper!'' in his
troubled sleep.
   Ghosts at Christmas? Why not? A child is born, but the year is
dying: 'Tis the season to be mindful of our mortality.
   All the way back to Bethlehem, when the ox and ass knelt with the
shepherds at the manger and the Magi, magicians or wise men from the
East, came calling, Christmas has been a time of mystery and magic.
   The Christmas ghost is older in tradition than the fir tree
trimmed with lights or stockings hung by the chimney with care. The
horror has always gone with the holly, as the Wise Men knew when
they offered the new-born babe the gift myrrh, a burial spice, from
their camel bags.
   In Victorian times, a ghost for Christmas was as common as a
goose.
   With the publication of ``A Christmas Carol'' in 1843, Charles
Dickens became the acknowledged master of the seasonal spooky story,
which he did not invent but refined into an annual event. Even under
pressure of unfinished novels long past the publisher's deadline, a
grim Dickensian word, he would not give up the Christmas ghost. ``I
am loath to lose the money,'' he admitted, ``and still more so to
leave any gap at Christmas firesides which I ought to fill.''
   Christmas ghosts hovered over the writing desks of Sir Walter
Scott, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Wilkie Collins, William Thackeray,
Charles Reade, Rudyard Kipling, Elizabeth Bowen, L.P. Hartley and
Lord Dunsany, to name but a few.
   English, French, Scandinavian and American literature abound with
Christmas ghouls, trolls and goblins.
   Such merry merchants of the macabre as Algernon Blackwood, H.P.
Lovecraft, Sheridan LeFanu, Saki and W.W. Jacobs of ``The Monkey's
Paw'' fame observed Christmas with a grisly gothic gift to their
readers.
   As the last line hauntingly confirms, James Joyce's ``The Dead''
is a classic Christmas ghost story: ``His soul swooned slowly as he
heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly
falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and
the dead.''
   In a holiday tale of malicious merriment, English humorist Jerome
K. Jerome warns guests against spending the night in ``The Blue
Chamber'' of his uncle's country manor. The room is haunted every
Christmas Eve ``by the ghost of a most sinful man who once killed a
Christmas carol singer with a lump of coal'' for singing off key.
   The spirit of this sensitive music lover ``did not like to appear
to be boasting'' but he also dispatched seven street musicians
``counting trombones,'' an ``Italian lad who came to town with a
barrel organ that played nothing but Scotch airs'' and an entire
German oompah band.
   A half-century later in a Christmas issue of the New Yorker,
cartoonist Charles Addams struck another blow for Noel noise
abatement. His fiendish friends are seen up on the roof of their
haunted town house pouring down boiling oil on the carolers gathered
on the front stoop.
   ``What is it that makes human beings at Christmas request a very
carnival of crime?'' asked Ambrose Bierce, lexicographer of ``The
Devil's Dictionary.''
   Sisters in crime Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers always
could be relied upon to contribute a holiday homicide to the
carnival.
   In ``Maigret's Christmas,'' Georges Simenon's Gallic gumshoe
investigates the case of an orphan girl visited by a white bearded
Father Christmas who gives her a large doll, then quickly tears up a
few floorboards. ``You come to me on Christmas day, when you know
that I am alone in my house,'' the junk dealer chuckles to Markheim,
his murderer, in Robert Louis Stevenson's splendid descent into the
seasonal spirit world.

   Kenneth W. Cowans's Dec. 24 editorial-page article, "The
Munificent Ebenezer Scrooge," reads as if it might have been
written by the old miser himself. Mr. Cowans states that
"Scrooge's decision not to give to charity and to keep his
capital working instead was the best contribution he could
make to the welfare of the poor." Where were the poor to go
while waiting for this 1830s' "trickle-down" theory to bear
fruit? Scrooge's own words come to mind: "Are there no
prisons? And the workhouses, are they still in operation?"
   Mr. Cowans praises "the hard-headed businessmen like
Ebenezer Scrooge" who reinvested their full year's earnings
without deducting anything for charitable contributions. Such
a practice was at the time, and is still today, not so much
hard-headed as cold-hearted. Whether in the inner cities of
today or in the London of Charles Dickens, acts of kindness
and charity convey life, joy and hope to those in need.

<TEXT>
   Perhaps Mr. Cowans needs a nocturnal visit from the same
spirits that visited Scrooge.
   Mark Feighery
   Centerville, Ohio
   ---
   Mr. Cowans may or may not have been serious in praising
Dickens's most notorious skinflint. Even so, he obviously
equates Ebenezer's dour philosophy with that of Ronald Reagan
-- that is to say, the "trickle-down" theory of reinvestment.
But, I do not recall that Dickens indicated that Scrooge ever
did any significant spending or invested his heavy wealth
anyplace but in his own vaults, at least not until after his
somewhat bizarre reborning. However, while he and Mr. Reagan
seemed to have had a number of traits in common, there was at
least one outstanding difference. Mr. Scrooge displayed his
disdain for his fellow countrymen with a scowl; Mr. Reagan,
ever mindful of television, did it with a smile.

STAGE WEEK: A FLIGHT FROM 'STAR TREK' TO SCROOGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you know him as Capt. Jean-Luc Picard on "Star Trek: The Next Generation," 
get ready for Patrick Stewart as Ebenezer Scrooge. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, the British actor is taking his one-man rendition of Charles 
Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" to the campus of UC Santa Barbara -- followed by a 
single show Saturday at UCLA's Wadsworth Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed to taste a live audience again," he said of the stage detour. "For 
the longest time, I've been doing film and television, and I was starting to 
suffer withdrawal. A solo piece seemed to be the simplest solution." 
</P>
<P>
The former Royal Shakespeare Company member hooked into Dickens' novel a few 
years ago while on location for the film "Lady Jane." It was a part of his 
"survival kit" for the long stretches off-camera. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of those things I thought I knew, but I'd never read," he 
confessed. "I didn't expect to get very far, but I devoured it in a sitting. 
It's a mini-masterpiece, really, so much more than the sleigh bell and fur 
images. In 1985, I performed it with my old church in the north of England, and 
it really got under my skin." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to last year's performance of "A Christmas Carol" at Wadsworth, 
Stewart has developed a collection of programs that he tours throughout 
Southern California. "Some are lectures, some are recitals," he said. "One is a 
lecture and investigation of the character of Shylock in 'Merchant of Venice.' 
Another is called 'Uneasy Lies Ahead,' based on the multiplicity of kings, 
bosses and party leaders -- everyone from King David to Lenin -- I've played." 
</P>
<P>
Why do casting directors always associate him with those starchy roles? "It 
must be the sweetness of my nature," he said, laughing. "Actually, my career 
has gone in blocks of typecasting. At one time, I was the Royal Shakespeare 
Company's first choice for low comic." 
</P>
<P>
THE GIRLS FROM THE BEACH: It's a circus motif for Diane Driscoll and Angie 
Ventresca's "Life and Other Death-Defying Acts" (on Tuesday night only at the 
Zephyr in Hollywood), the brainchild of a group of "China Beach" assistants. 
</P>
<P>
"We have five actors and two musicians -- and clowns, magicians, knife throwers 
and a stiltwalker," said Capri Darling, who'll play four different characters 
in the quartet of scenes. Originally intended as a showcase, the piece has 
developed into a full production -- courtesy of their "China Beach" bosses: 
"The producers are backing us, giving us notes, letting us use their prop 
department and lending us costumes from the studio." 
</P>
<P>
But don't look for any Vietnam-era subject matter. "Our show has nothing to do 
with 'China Beach.' " 
</P>
<P>
THEATER BUZZ: Patti D'Arbanville and Nick Mancuso will star in the Jan. 11 
premiere of Daniel Faraldo's "How Does it Feel?" at the Gnu Theatre in North 
Hollywood . . . The Dec. 11 "Because We Care" AIDS holiday benefit at the Taper 
features 15 cast members from "The Phantom of the Opera" in "A Tribute to the 
Music of Leonard Bernstein," plus Brian Kerwin's reading of Lanford Wilson's "A 
Poster of the Cosmos." 
</P>
<P>
Dana Elcar has announced the upcoming season at his Santa Paula Theatre Center. 
Garson Kanin's "Born Yesterday" bows Feb. 9, followed by John Patrick Shanley's 
"Italian American Reconciliation" (which, coincidentally, Patti D'Arbanville 
played at the Gnu a couple of years back), Victorian Sardou and Emile de 
Nagac's 17th-century farce, "Let's Get a Divorce," a new Tina Howe play, and 
the musical "The Apple Tree," with stories by Mark Twain and Jules Feiffer. 
</P>
<P>
CRITICAL CROSSFIRE: Scottish playwright Sharman Macdonald's mother-daughter 
drama, "When I Was a Girl, I Used to Scream and Shout," recently had its 
American premiere at South Coast Repertory. Simon Stokes directs Elizabeth 
McGovern and Dana Ivey. 
</P>
<P>
Said The Times' Dan Sullivan: "If this were a Beth Henley play, there would be 
recriminations all over the lot, and a final family embrace. But (central 
characters) Morag and Fiona prefer to sit on their anger . . . This is 
realistic, and probably very Scottish, but it's also frustrating for the viewer 
who likes people in plays to make breakthroughs." 
</P>
<P>
In the Orange County Register, Thomas O'Connor applauded "a remarkable first 
effort -- apparently an autobiographical one. Macdonald's memories shiver with 
chilling, tactile vividness; she writes in a lyric shorthand that draws 
resonant music from the clipped burrs of Scottish idiom." 
</P>
<P>
From Clifford Gallo in the Los Angeles Reader: "While the play's themes of 
independence and maternal conflict are familiar, Macdonald handles them with 
authenticity and quirky charm, revealing subtleties a less astute playwright 
would have neglected."

<DESCRIPT>  CALIFORNIA; BUDGET; WELFARE; DECREASE; CONTROVERSY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Likening Gov. Pete Wilson to Ebenezer Scrooge, a coalition of churches and
advocates for the poor Thursday launched a campaign to defeat the governor's
proposed welfare cuts.;   Members of the "Campaign for a Fair Share" said they
also would seek legislation to restore previous welfare cuts and eliminate tax
loopholes for the wealthy.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  California News  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  PROPOSED WELFARE CUTS CALLED 'SCROOGE APPROACH'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "If the truth be known, Gov. Wilson's proposal is a thinly disguised
Scrooge approach to poor people's lives," said Patricia Whitney-Wise of the
California Council of Churches.;   On Monday, the Republican governor proposed
an initiative for the November 1992 ballot that would cut basic payments under
the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program by 10 percent and by
another 15 percent after able-bodied recipients' first six months on the
welfare rolls.;   The proposal would also limit welfare payments for newcomers
to California and prevent grants from increasing when women on welfare have
additional children. Other provisions would increase food stamp payments by
$20 a month and boost welfare payments to teen-age parents who stay in
school.;   Wilson said the changes were necessary to get more welfare
recipients into the workforce and to help solve the state's budget crisis.;  
The cuts would be on top of a 4.4 percent reduction in AFDC payments that
California imposed in September.;   On Thursday, the opposition campaign held
a Capitol news conference with a cardboard cutout of Wilson dressed in
Victorian clothing and with cartoon bubble containing the words, "Bah
Humbug.";   "We may look like a bunch of carolers, but we find it difficult to
celebrate when the governor has launched a campaign against children,
unemployed mothers, seniors, the disabled and other low-income people in our
state," said Callie Hutchison of the California Homeless and Housing
Coalition.;   Whitney-Wise read a selection from Charles Dickens' "A Christmas
Carol," in which a miserly Scrooge refuses to give money to two men collecting
donations for the poor.;   "We in the council have already seen the increase
of families living on the streets and coming to our doors as the result of the
1991 budget cuts," Whitney-Wise said. "The governor's latest proposal will
force more families into homelessness and some of them will die.";   The
Western Center on Law and Poverty released a study that disputes Wilson's
claims that the size of California's welfare grants encourages people to move
to the state, have more children and shirk work.;   The report, titled "Easy
Targets," says the typical welfare family is a 30-year-old mother and two
children who have received AFDC payments for less than two years.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  It was as if Patty Fisher was playing the part of the Spirit of Christmas
Future from "A Christmas Carol" for the public schools and teachers in "Long
limping, schools finally fall" (Commentary, Dec. 22).;   Let us not forget
that in "A Christmas Carol," Scrooge is visited by three spirits. It is the
Spirit of Christmas Past who enlightens Scrooge about the financial decisions
he made earlier in his life, which cost him much in emotional happiness and
set him on a path of isolation and selfishness. Teachers might do well to
consider how well the decision to unionize has served them and what it truly
has cost them.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  The Letters Page  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SCROOGE CHANGED HIS WAYS; MAYBE SCHOOLS CAN, TOO  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The Letters Page  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The Spirit of Christmas Present allows Scrooge to see what his life had
become and exactly what people thought of him behind his back. (The public has
grown weary of the public schools' lack of performance and teachers' academic
elitism, isolationism and unionism. More and more of the public no longer
wishes to support what it perceives as a non-productive, non-responsive,
self-serving bureaucracy. Many are seeking ways to rid themselves of these
ills (especially teachers who don't teach and can't be fired). Ergo the rise
of the voucher system.;   In "A Christmas Carol," Scrooge asks the Spirit of
Christmas Future if what he had been shown were shadows of what would be or
shadows of what might be? Having seen the error of his ways, Scrooge also
realized that his future was yet to be, and he did indeed have a chance to
change it. Therefore he set about changing his ways, and goodwill and
happiness returned to his life. Thus ends the story of "A Christmas Carol.";  
The question is, what spirits have the public schools and schoolteachers seen
this Christmas? I believe it is within their power to summon all the public
goodwill and support they will need to subdue any problems presented them in
the future. If -- and this is a big if -- they, like Scrooge, understand what
part they played in making the present, and if they seek to change the errors
(the isms) of their past, they can do this. They will lead us into a new and
enlightened era of public education for the benefit of all.;   But on the
other hand, if they choose to excuse themselves from, and to blame others for
what has brought them to this time and place, the future may very well be like
that foretold by Patty Fisher, "the Spirit of Christmas Future.";   -- Robert

A CATALOGUE OF FILM CLASSICS FROM CHRISTMASES PAST

<P>
For many of us, some of the happiest Christmas memories happened at the movies. 
Video makes it possible to relive those golden moments: Bing Crosby singing 
"White Christmas," Edmund Gwenn showing us there really is a Santa Claus, Jimmy 
Stewart standing by a tree discovering the gift of life, Jean Shepherd 
reminding us what it was like to be young the night before Christmas, Dickens' 
Scrooge come to life. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby introduced "White Christmas" in one of the best holiday musicals ever 
created on film: Holiday Inn (MCA tape and laser Encore Edition video disc). 
Irving Berlin crowded the 1942 black-and-white film with one song after 
another, each memorializing a holiday. Crosby and Fred Astaire (or both) sing 
(or dance to) them and it's a sure-fire way to start the holidays right. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby sang the Yuletide classic again in White Christmas, a 1954 Berlin 
songfest with Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen (Paramount tape and 
disc). A tiresome plot almost swamps the typically merry Berlin score-the 
patter-song "Sisters," still another version of "Blue Skies" and the 
indestructible title song. 
</P>
<P>
Miracle on 34th Street (Playhouse Home Video tape and disc) is the 1947 classic 
featuring Gwenn as Kris Kringle, a department store Santa who just may be the 
real thing. The way he goes about convincing everyone (especially the little 
girl who steals the film, Natalie Wood) that he's the great Mr. Claus is great 
fun. Skip the colorized version; everyone looks anemic, like early Polaroid 
snapshots left out in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
For most of us, even a colorized Gwenn is Santa, not the imposter in Santa 
Claus: The Movie (Media Entertainment tape; Image Entertainment laser video 
disc). Not that David Huddleston doesn't look the part (his first sleigh ride 
at the beginning is impressive). But even Dudley Moore as a fallen elf and John 
Lithgow, as an unscrupulous toy manufacturer, can't save the picture. 
</P>
<P>
A Christmas Story (MGM/UA tape and disc) is one of the funniest films ever 
made. Humorist Jean Shepherd's reminiscences about growing up in the late 1940s 
revolves around young Shepherd's gift of his dreams for Christmas: A Red Ryder 
Carbine Action 2OO-Shot Lightning Loader Range Model Air Rifle (a BB gun). 
Peter Billingsley plays Shepherd as a boy and Shepherd himself narrates. Pure 
joy. 
</P>
<P>
Many memorable films have special Christmas celebrations. Few film endings will 
match the emotion of the Christmas ending in Frank Capra's 1946 heartwarmer 
It's a Wonderful Life (Be careful. The tape is in the public domain and many of 
the video prints are terrible. Recommended: Republic tape and disc, or the 
special edition on Criterion laser disc). Stewart is the small-town businessman 
facing ruin on Christmas Eve. The ending is pure movie magic. Skip the Hal 
Roach Studio's "colorized" print. It makes everyone look embalmed on a series 
of tinted postcards. 
</P>
<P>
The Christmas sequence in Meet Me in St. Louis (MGM/UA tape and disc) is the 
highlight of this lovely family musical. When Judy Garland sings "Have Yourself 
a Merry Little Christmas" to Margaret O'Brien, there isn't a dry eye in the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Rosalind Russell storms through an unforgettable Christmas celebration in 
Auntie Mame (Warner tape and dasc), and the musical featuring Lucille Ball 
(Mame, Warner tape and disc) has Jerry Herman's underrated song "We Need a 
Little Christmas," a neat populist summary of why everyone loves the season. 
</P>

When it comes to Christmas stories, none will ever match Dickens' A Christmas 
Carol and you can now own two of the best versions ever on film. The 1951 
black-and-white film starring Alastair Sim as Scrooge is the 86-minute British 
version that sets the standard (United). Surprisingly good is the 1938 
production featuring Reginald Owen as Scrooge (MGM/UA tape and disc). 
</P>
<P>
Scrooge, a happy musical adaptation, was made in 1970 with an all-star cast 
including Albert Finney out- rageously good in the title role and no less than 
Alec Guinness as Marley's Ghost (CBS/Fox tape and disc). 
</P>
<P>
Other films with a Yuletide theme: 
</P>
<P>
Christmas Lilies of the Field (MPI Home Video tape), a made-for-television 
sequel to the original "Lilies of the Field," featuring Billy Dee Williams in 
Sidney Poitier's Academy Award-winning role. 
</P>
<P>
A Christmas to Remember (Vestron tape) is another made-for-TV movie with a 
superior cast including Jason Robards, Eva Marie Saint and Joanne Woodward. 
It's the story of a city boy who joins his grandparents in the country for the 
holiday and learns the real meaning of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
For TV fans, there's Christmas Television Classics (Shokus tape). This video 
compilation features four 30-minute, black-and-white TV shows from the 1950s, 
including "The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet" (Rick sings "Christmas Song") 
and "Make Room for Daddy" (Danny Thomas is stranded out of town on Christmas 
Eve). 
</P>
<P>
If you're tired of Hollywood's interpretation of the Christmas message, you 
might try The Christmas Collection (Vanguard Video, two hours) of five films, 
including "Glory in the Highest," a drama about the birth of Christ, and "God's 
Christmas Gift" in which a girl finds the true meaning of Christmas.

Christmas, it often seems, means Dickens. You can see why. There is Scrooge,
of course, and the Spirits of Christmas Past, Present and To Come; there are
the affecting snow scenes in several other novels. And there is the love of
family and friends to which he so often returns.
Since Dickens has always prompted British character actors to their most
acute performances (there have been at least three new British stagings of
Great Expectations since early September), it is no wonder that several new
Dickens stagings occur this Christmas in London.
A Christmas Carol comes to the Barbican, in the world premiere of a new
adaptation by John Mortimer, directed by Ian Judge, with Clive Francis as
Scrooge, opening on December 6. (Meanwhile in Manchester Scrooge runs for
two months at the Palace Theatre.)
Oliver, the Lionel Bart musical version of Oliver Twist, comes to the
Palladium in an important new production by Sam Mendes, starring Jonathan
Pryce as Fagin (also starring Ruthie Henshall, Sally Dexter), opening on
December 8. At the Battersea Arts cafe, Sketches by Boz, adapted by critic
Robert Butler, with music by Stephen Lade and directed by Graham Sinclair,
opens on November 29. And a new version of A Tale of Two Cities by Matthew
Francis opens at Greenwich Theatre on December 19.
But Christmas can also mean novelty; and a surprising number of new or
modern plays comes to the West End in this period. One of the Royal Court's
most acclaimed novelties this year, My Night with Reg, by Kevin Elyot and
directed by Roger Michell, is opening at the Criterion Theatre in late
November. Pinter's supreme (and very short) one-act play Landscape comes to
the Cottesloe Theatre, in the staging (by Pinter himself) which was the
highlight of this May's superb Pinter festival at the Gate Theatre, Dublin,
and very nearly of all 1994; Penelope Wilton and Ian Holm star.
On November 29, Richard Nelson's New England has its world premiere with the
RSC at the Pit; Peter Gill directs, and the cast includes Angela Thorne.
Described as 'humorous and ironic', it deals with the feelings of English
exiles in America. The Theatre de Complicite opens its latest production,
Out of a House walked a man . . ., at the Lyttelton Theatre on December 1;
directed by Simon McBurney with a cohort of Complicite stars (Kathryn
Hunter, Toby Jones, Marcello Magni, Toby Sedgwick). And on December 13,
Slavs, the latest play by Tony Kushner (he of Angels in America) opens at
the Hampstead Theatre, with an illustrious cast including Annette Badland,
Ron Cook, Imelda Staunton, Paul Jesson, and Aisling O'Sullivan; Matthew
Lloyd directs. The subtitle is Thinking about the Longstanding Problems of
Virtue and Happiness.
Meanwhile, at the Bush Theatre, the excellent Dominic Dromgoole directs an
'epic' production of Raising Fires (opening on November 25), a prize-winning
new play by Jenny McLeod: desire, revenge, and arson in 16th xentury Essex
around Tilda, the town's first black woman. And, on December 1 in
Scarborough, Alan Ayckbourn presents, and directs, his third new play this
year: The Musical Jigsaw Play.
Christmas also means children's stories - by Kenneth Grahame, Hans Christian
Andersen, the Brothers Grimm, et al - several of which reach our stages this
year. The 1990 Alan Bennett version of A Wind in the Willows returns to the
Olivier Theatre on December 15, for what is said to be its final revival. At
the Young Vic (opening on December 7), the poet Carol Ann Duffy adapts Grimm
Tales (eight of them), directed by Tim Supple. At the Lyric Hammersmith
(opening December 12), Neil Bartlett adapts and directs Andersen's The
Little Match Girl; the effects, by Forkbeard Fantasy, include nine-foot
teddy-bears, dancing Christmas dinners, live satellite links to heaven, and
disreputable angels.
In BAC Studio One (Battersea, opening on December 7), Tom Smith directs
Peter Pan, an Edwardian Fantasy. And, straight after Christmas, the
unclassifiable Music Theatre London brings to the Queen Elizabeth Hall its
1992 hit version of Rossini's Cinderella (Cinderella's father is Essex man;
her step-sisters are played by men; Prince Charming is played by a woman).
Christmas, since it involves carols, also just means, for many people,
musicals. New British musical productions include Out of the Blue (opening
later this month at the Shaftesbury), two versions of Calamity Jane (one
opening at the Leicester Haymarket on November 22, one at the BAC,
Battersea, on December 9), and Phyllida Lloyd's staging of The Threepenny
Opera at the Donmar Warehouse (opening on December 14).

<TEXT>
   ``The Naked Gun,'' a spoof of television police
shows, and ``Scrooged,'' a slapstick update of a classic Christmas
story, touched the hearts and wallets of the nation's moviegoers
last weekend.
   ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,'' which stars
Leslie Nielsen as a hardboiled detective who stumbles on a murder
plot, rated first place at the box office, earning $9.3 million in
its first weekend of release.
   ``Scrooged,'' featuring Bill Murray as a modern day Scrooge in
the retelling of ``A Christmas Carol,'' was second with $7.5
million, according to figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations
Co.
   Making its debut in third place with $6.3 million was ``Tequila
Sunrise,'' a steamy thriller starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Mel Gibson
and Kurt Russell.
   Animated films followed in a close race. ``The Land Before Time''
was No. 4 with $3.5 million and ``Oliver and Co.,'' followed with
$3.1 million.
   ``The Land Before Time,'' about a baby brontosaurus making a
dangerous journey through a prehistoric land, had the best-ever
opening for an animated film three weeks ago.
   ``Oliver and Co.'' recounts Dickens' ``Oliver Twist'' tale, using
the voices of Lily Tomlin, Cheech Marin and Billy Joel, among others.
   Another Christmas theme movie _ ``Ernest Saves Christmas'' placed
sixth with $2.3 million.

VIDEO DISCOVERIES: HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS MARATHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT MARSH, Robert Marsh is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the advent of video, my friends and I have gathered in an annual 
endurance test of holiday cheer. We have thrown Christmas Movie Marathons. 
</P>
<P>
After raiding a video store or two, we sit back for 24 hours or so, basking in 
the season. Some people may want to split their viewing over several weeknights 
or even a few weekends, but those who manage to sit straight through everything 
will find it a wonderful sensation. As the films flicker by, the marathoner may 
feel his or her heart grow to two or three times its normal size. 
</P>
<P>
First, there are the television specials (yeah, I know I said movie marathon 
but Christmas just wouldn't be Christmas without a few of these TV classics now 
available on video. Try shuffling them up and watching them between the real 
movies). 
</P>
<P>
This year, several specials directed by the inimitable team of Arthur Rankin 
Jr. and Jules Bass have been released for sale and rental. "The Little Drummer 
Boy" is a charming little piece that may remind one of the sometimes forgotten 
role played at Christmas by the baby Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
And what would the holidays be without "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"? This 
Rankin and Bass tale is narrated by a Burl Ives snowman and features many 
holiday tunes. Such fun characters as prospecting Yukon Cornelius and a 
bouncing Abominable Snowman highlight this tale of misfits in search of 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
Rankin and Bass' "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town" finds Fred Astaire narrating 
the story of Santa, letting us know just who he is and how he came to be. More 
toe-tapping tunes and endearing characters lace this favorite. (Incidentally, 
if Hollywood is listening, "The Year Without a Santa Claus," the 
rarely-televised story about the year when Santa couldn't deliver toys because 
of the worst blizzard in history, should be released on video. The singing and 
dancing Heat Miser is sorely missed.) 
</P>
<P>
"A Very Merry Cricket" is a wonderful animated special written and directed by 
Chuck Jones of Looney Tunes fame. It tells the tale of a cricket who brings 
Times Square to a halt with his Christmas caroling. Jones' best-known 
directorial effort is the quintessential Christmas TV special, "How the Grinch 
Stole Christmas," written by Dr. Suess and narrated by Boris Karloff. My group 
continually promises to save this one for the end of the marathon, as sort of 
its crowning glory, but none of us can ever wait that long to see it. 
</P>
<P>
And, just as we need to see the Grinch carve the roast beast, we need to hear 
Linus' soulful telling of the Christmas Story, and to watch Charlie Brown 
rescue a forgotten little Christmas tree, and to hear the Peanuts' gang's 
rendition of "Hark the Herald Angels Sing" in "A Charlie Brown Christmas." If 
you've only got one hour for Christmas viewing, Charlie Brown and the Grinch 
can fill it with decades worth of Christmas memories and cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Onto the movies! John Hughes' "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" is a good 
starting point even though it is a Thanksgiving film. Steve Martin is trying to 
get home to spend the holiday with his family. The hazards of the road and John 
Candy get in his way, and make for an exceptional film loaded with laughs and 
laced with a human warmth that should bring a lump to the heartiest throat. 
</P>
<P>
A good follow-up is "Miracle on 34th Street," the version that stars Edmund 
Gwenn as the bearded gent who must convince a very young Natalie Wood -- and a 
courtroom -- that he truly is the real Santa. (Again, you should only invite 
people to your marathon who will not mind displays of emotion. Both movies 
listed so far, and most that follow, are guaranto teed tear-wellers). 
</P>
<P>
For a change of a pace, you might want to add "The Nutcracker," especially the 
lavish American Ballet Theatre production that features Mikhail Baryshnikov as 
both star and choreographer. The National Philharmonic's spirited rendition of 
Tchaikovsky's score rounds out this excellent choice. 
</P>
<P>
If you wish to delve further down the fantasy path, try "March of the Wooden 
Soldiers." This 1934 film with Laurel and Hardy is the original "Babes in 
Toyland" and is far superior to the Disney remake (with Annette Funicello and 
Tommy Sands) that most people rent unwittingly. Although this film includes 
some tunes that are far from exciting, Laurel and Hardy are great fun as the 
toy maker's assistants who must save the storybook town. 
</P>
<P>
"A Christmas Carol" is a must, but which version? I recommend the 1951 
black-and-white one with Alastair Sim as Scrooge. It is well written and the 
acting is superb, on top of which you don't have to listen to Albert Finney 
sing. And Dickens' bleak world plays best in black and white, as a place of 
shadow and light. (You may want to consider before renting that this film is 
for sale at just slightly more than the rental fee. It makes an excellent 
addition to a home library and even comes in a specially priced gift package 
with the next film in our marathon: "It's a Wonderful Life." 
</P>
<P>
For many people, this classic is at the top of the Christmas film list. If you 
have not yet enjoyed the tale of Jimmy Stewart taking a peek at what the world 
would have been like had he never been born, what are you waiting for?!? There 
is a colorized version, but avoid it like the plague. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the black-and-white vein, "The Bishop's Wife" stars Cary Grant as an 
angel who attempts to reconcile David Niven's stagnating marriage by making 
moves on Niven's wife. Both funny and touching, it'll leave you smiling. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bells of Saint Mary's" is the exceptional sequel to the Academy 
Award-winning "Going My Way." Bing Crosby, returning to his role as a 
modern-minded priest, finds himself at a parochial school butting heads with 
Ingrid Bergman's Mother Superior. It's a delightful film with many warm 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
"Holiday Inn" finds Crosby and Fred Astaire singing, dancing and fighting over 
women. It also marks the first appearance of Irving Berlin's classic "White 
Christmas" (later reprised in a film named after the song and again featuring 
Crosby, this time with sidekick Danny Kaye). If you're a Bing fan, "Holiday 
Inn" is a must. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas in Connecticut" is a screwball comedy starring Barbara Stanwyck as a 
newspaper columnist whom people turn to for advice in family matters. The 
problem is that she's not the Susie Homemaker type she pretends to be; she's 
really tough and streetwise. For the sake of publicity (and her job), she has 
to find house and husband for the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
Out of the '40s and into the '80s with "Ernest Saves Christmas." Yes, an Ernest 
film. I admit to being a fan, but even non-Ernest fans might love this one, a 
very funny story about Ernest's efforts to help an old Santa pass on his 
gift-giving skills to an overweight children's show host. Even though you may 
not entirely buy the borderline, maudlin runaway-girl subplot, this is still a 
film that should make you say, "Hey! It's Christmas . . . and I like it!" 
</P>
<P>
There's more Christmas comedy from John Hughes in "National Lampoon's Christmas 
Vacation" as Chevy Chase returns as Clark Griswald, the consummate family man 
trying to have a real family Christmas. Naturally, nothing goes right. From his 
harpy in-laws to the unexpected arrival of rural cousin Randy Quaid, Chevy's 
Christmas takes one downward slide after another. 
</P>
<P>
A true gem is "A Christmas Story," with Peter Billingsley (better known as 
Messy Marvin) as a boy who wants a Red Ryder air gun for Christmas. He schemes 
diligently to get one, only to hear from everyone -- including a department 
store Santa -- that he'll shoot his eye out. It's a charming, nostalgic look at 
youth and a bygone era. Darren McGavin plays the boy's father with a 
delightfully silly quality. If you haven't saved the Grinch or "It's a 
Wonderful Life" for last, you might want to consider "A Christmas Story" as the 
crown of your marathon. 
</P>
<P>
A very funny version of the "Christmas Carol" tale is Richard Donner's 
"Scrooged," with Bill Murray as a practically soulless television executive who 
receives the ghostly visitations of Christmas Past, Present and Future. How can 
you not like a movie that proposes a television special entitled "The Night the 
Reindeer Died" complete with explosions and Lee Majors? 
</P>
<P>
Finally, there'll be a new addition to my group's marathon this year: "Die 
Hard." Yes, the Bruce Willis action flick about a lone New York cop up against 
a gang of ruthless, bloodthirsty burglars. Aside from the bullets and blood, 
you see, it's a film about a man trying to win his family back. He's come to 
Los Angeles to spend Christmas with them. Some people will argue for "Lethal 
Weapon" on the same grounds: It, too, takes place in the holiday season. Mel 
Gibson must learn to overcome the death of his wife, people get shot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
One last note: for the truly warped, there is a film called "Silent Night, 
Deadly Night," which finds Santa running around chopping people up with an ax. 
This one has the distinction of having had its ads pulled from television 
because they were scaring little children and it most likely will not be in my 
group's marathon.

"It's a hard-boiled detective serial -- except all the roles are reversed," 
said Anita Merzell, whose radio spoof "The Case of the Purloined Sterling" 
(opening Wednesday at Actors Alley in Sherman Oaks) boasts a tough-talking 
female private eye. "All the he-man behavior is performed by Shayna Goldberg, 
and the fainting characters are the men she leaves behind, in her pursuit of 
peace, justice and the American way." 
</P>
<P>
In the spirit of "The Maltese Falcon," Shayna is also in pursuit of valuable 
booty: in this case, the Flaming Tahitian Sunset silverware passed down from 
her grandmother to her mother. 
</P>
<P>
"Shayna's no-good boyfriend, Bernie, steals the silverware, which sets her on a 
quest from New Jersey to Peekskill to Sing-Sing, on a train to San Francisco 
and a boat to Cairo," Merzell said. "Along the way, she meets some bizarre 
characters who both help and hinder her: her mentor-bookie Mad Rabbi Mordechai, 
the mysterious Dr. Chu and his sex slave Rod Todd, whom the silverware falls 
to. So Shayna follows him to the tomb of a long-dead Jewish princess in the 
Valley of the Kings. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Four actors and one singer play the 20-odd characters. As with old-time 
broadcasts, the sound effects are provided by an on-stage collection of 
creative noisemakers. "We have traditional effects, like a pumpkin being 
dropped for a dead body," Merzell noted. "We also have untraditional ones, like 
a basketball -- also dropped for a dead body -- bouncing a few times. And the 
actors will have their scripts in hand, making costume changes as the scene 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
The writer-actress (who's also playing Shayna) won't reveal her age, but 
emphasizes that she doesn't personally remember radio drama. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the information we get in our generation has been from film and TV," 
she pointed out. "I started thinking about what it would be like to get it from 
the radio -- or sit in the audience during one of these broadcasts. So when I 
was in San Francisco developing this, I did a lot of research, listened to old 
radio shows. We've also written some funny commercials and used old news 
broadcasts to give people a flavor for the era -- then turned it on its ear. 
It's looking with an affectionate, funny eye at where we were, and where we are 
now."

Admission is free.

December is the month for Christmas plays, Hanukkah plays, holiday satires . . 
. and a couple of nondenominational pursuits. The small but eclectic roster of 
December theater openings includes the following. 
</P>
<P>
"Sophie and Willa," Katharine R. Sloan's story of the friendship between an 
elderly Jewish New Yorker and her single, pregnant black neighbor premieres 
Friday at the Tiffany in Hollywood. Jill Andre directs Louise Fitch, Francesca 
Roberts, Lucy Lee Flippin, Richard Reicheg and Shavar Ross. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary Forsyth stars as a harried single mom in "Happytime Xmas" (opening 
Dec. 10 at the Cast Theatre in Hollywood), a spoof of kinder, gentler holidays 
past. It's written and directed by Justin Tanner, whose "Zombie Attack!" is 
also playing at the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"Hanukkah Lights," an original musical theater retelling of the story of 
Hanukkah by the four-person group, the Shpielers, begins Dec. 10 at the Gindi 
Auditorium at the University of Judaism in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Stewart -- a.k.a. Capt. Jean-Luc Picard of TV's "Star Trek: the Next 
Generation" -- dons his classical hat for a one-man, one-performance show of 
Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" (Scrooge, Marley, Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim, et al), 
playing Saturday at UCLA's Wadsworth Theater in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
In a more lavish rendition, the 32-member Nebraska Theatre Caravan brings its 
version of "A Christmas Carol" to Pepperdine's Smothers Theatre in Malibu for 
two performances Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
In Santa Monica, Highways' latest Car Pool performance series revs up from Dec. 
14 to Dec. 17 with a quartet of solo works: Eric Gutierrez's "La Llorona," 
Angela Yokoe's "Where Do I Stand?," Rick Ohara's "Nuke-Age Trilogy" and Carol 
McDowell's "Madame Lazare." 
</P>
<P>
"The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber: a Concert" (show tunes from "Jesus Christ 
Superstar," "Evita," "Cats," "Starlight Express" and "Phantom of the Opera" and 
others) opens Dec. 26 at the Shubert Theatre in Century City. Webber's wife, 
soprano Sarah Brightman, does the honors. 
</P>
<P>
Kwanzaa, the so-called "black Christmas," is celebrated at Highways Performance 
Space with Akilah Nayo Oliver's "Dissectations: Anatomy of Rage," a collection 
of stories, chants and confessions, playing Dec. 28, 29 and 30. Keith Antar 
Mason directs Oliver, Michelle T. Clinton, Adele Renault, Kokuma Desiree Rugley 
and Veronica Wilson.

FT  17 DEC 92 / Arts: You gotta have a hero you can like - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CHAPLIN (12) Richard Attenborough
MALCOLM X Spike Lee
THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL (U) Brian Henson
MO' MONEY (15) Peter MacDonald
COOL WORLD (12) Ralph Bakshi
Charlie C and Malcolm X. Only through the world-shrinking,
history-scrambling quirks of movie production could the two have ever come
together.
Films about real people are called 'bio-pics': partly, one suspects, because
they are grown with the fertiliser of artistic presumption. Take a famous
fellow - Chaplin, Emile Zola, Napoleon, Gandhi, Malcolm X - and water him
with a few drops of liquid feed compounded from (equal parts) wild surmise,
canonisation and a democratising Everymanness.
Then watch your hero grow from someone real, measurable and idiomatic into
someone bland and generic enough to command a two or three-hour movie. Sir
Richard Attenborough's Chaplin is all about a handsome chap with curly hair
and quirky accent (it starts Elephant and Castle cockney, it ends Belgravia
posh) who floated through Hollywood between 1914 and 1952. Much of the time
this chap appears bewildered: partly because his life has been scripted by
four different people - Bryan Forbes, William Boyd, William Goldman and
(uncredited) Tom Stoppard - and partly because he is impersonated by a
fifth, Robert Downey Jr, who is brilliant when allowed to clown, comatose
when not.
Yet Chaplin, for all its faults, is a gust of pleasure compared with Malcolm
X. This, coming to British screens shortly, was witnessed by me a week ago
in Los Angeles. In the bio-pic cosmos Spike Lee's film is Yang to
Attenborough's Yin. Where Chaplin is a victim of innocence, stumbling into
aesthetic voids in the course of a well-meaning search for the Little Chap's
tragicomic essence, Lee's film is a disingenuous bland-out. Hustling its
hero through recent political history, it dodges controversial issues like a
soldier serpentining between bullets on a battlefield.
In both films the real-life subject is replaced by an expanded
glamorisation. But where Attenborough falls hapless victim to the
ineluctability of commercial movie tradition - gotta have a hero you can
like and understand rather than someone too prickly or protean (like Chaplin
himself) - Spike Lee uses that hagiographic trend as a propagandist tool.
In the role of race-war hate prophet Malcolm X he has cast Denzel
Washington, black cinema's Mr Nice Guy, best known for sweetening Steven
Biko in (Attenborough's) Cry Freedom. As a result, there is no sense of the
acrid aggressiveness with which the real Malcolm X played to black crowds
but which might, of course, have sent white audiences hurtling from the
cinema.
Malcolm X the movie, like Chaplin, pretends to portray a switchbacking life.
The civil rights leader did recant his own hate arias in late career,
converted to a gentler propagandism shortly before his own assassination.
But the conversion is meaningless - or impactless - in a movie where we
scarcely sense those hate arias to begin with. Even Malcolm X's notoriously
approving response to Kennedy's killing - 'The chickens have come home to
roost' - is camouflaged in a montage sequence where sounds and images are
pixillated to distract us from their content.
Chaplin owes its switchbacking structure to a different conversion: the
hero's change from silent-era supercomic to showbiz celebrity mugged by
history. This was not just movie history - the dooming effect of the sound
era on a performer whose work was grounded in mime - but political history.
Chaplin the man fell foul of the postwar American epidemic of anti-Communism
and Chaplin the movie suggests that even some of his troubles with women -
notably a litigious paternity suit - were the dark work of the FBI.
Could be true. But then almost anything in Chaplin could be true. Framing
the story with Swiss-set scenes of a white-haired Charlie discussing his
memoirs with his publisher (Anthony Hopkins), Attenborough and his scribes
make the film a giant flashback as if to say to the audience, 'Dispute what
you like. This is an old man's recall, not holy writ.'
Yet having taken this licence, they fail to use it interestingly. Charlie
recalls, it seems, only in cliches. His Ma (Geraldine Chaplin) is a
draggle-clothed cockney with a Monty Python line in penurious household
budgeting ('Sorry, it's only fish-'eads again, me darlins'.) The great
swashbuckler Doug Fairbanks (Kevin Kline) is introduced - yes - swinging
from a chandelier. And silent director Mack Sennett (Dan Aykroyd) is a
photo-fit assemblage of bullhorn, barking command and work mottoes designed
to tickle modern audiences' hindsight laughter ('I never make more than two
pictures a week').
The cartoonish approach might have earned its passage, if sustained and
intensified. But as Chaplin himself ages, so does the film's style. With the
comic practitioner pushed aside by the serial husband and suspected commie,
all the initially animated Robert Downey can do is to stand centre-screen,
arteries stiffening as he is assailed by a sirocco of subplots. Allowing
Chaplin to be his own first-person narrator - which may have seemed an
inspired idea at first - ends up playing straight into the hands of Bad
Bio-pic Practice. The hero freezes into a bland reactive icon, surrounded by
a cast of compensatingly exaggerated movers and shakers.
Throughout both Chaplin and Malcolm X we long for glimpses - and
occasionally get them - of the real man behind the movie surrogate. Each
time the real comedian or activist crackles forth from some old newsreel,
high-diving into a slapstick pond or haranguing from a fiery podium, we
suddenly see or hear what we have been missing. Danger. Surprise.
Attraction. Revulsion. Hilarity. Outrage. All those uneven, vivid,
corrugated emotions that are crushed smooth by the genuflecting gestures of
the bio-pic.
Meanwhile, Christmas draws on apace. And what more seasonal than The Muppet
Christmas Carol, directed by Brian Henson, son of the late great Jim? This
has Michael Caine's Scrooge adrift in a Victorian London packed with rats,
frogs, pigs, bears and creatures beyond description. Most of these animals
are gifted with the power of speech: not least the Great Gonzo as one
'Charles Dickens.'
This is very enjoyable and absurd for about 30 minutes, after which drama
and sentiment take over. Jerry Juhl's script becomes too obsequious to the
original, leaving the Muppets to mug frantically in the few seconds they get
between the Scrooge-and-ghost set pieces. Kermit gulps away prettily as Bob
Cratchit. Fozzie Bear shines for a millisecond as factory-owner 'Fozziwig.'
But Miss Piggy, wasted as Emma Cratchit, practises a porcine sneer in
preparation for better roles.
Mo' Money is a cops-and-robbers comedy scripted by black star Damon Wayans
(The Last Boy Scout). Wayans and real-life brother Marlon play two
knockabout con persons who, between scams, help the police expose big
business corruption. Fearlessly democratic in its offensiveness, the film
lampoons lawmakers and lawbreakers alike: not to mention cripples, junkies,
mental patients, paranoiacs, para-feminists, whole-earthists, half-earthists
and Uncle Tomism and all. It is so ill-behaved it is almost charming. Or am
I just suffering from pre-Christmas concussion?
Cool World may have contributed to that state if I am. Imagine a cartoon
dimension where migrated humans (Brad Pitt, Gabriel Byrne) turn into painted
likenesses of themselves and where painted nymphets long to depart so they
can turn into real earthy beauties. One such nymphet departs to become Kim
Basinger. But the strain proves too much and she returns to cartoondom.
Ralph Bakshi (Fritz The Cat, Lord Of The Rings) designed and directed this
live-action/animation folly, which is every bit as whimsical, circular and
one-idea as it sounds.

FT  06 DEC 94 / Arts: Sketches by Boz - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARAH HEMMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year offers a bumper selection pack of Dickens in London. Over the next
fortnight Oliver] opens in the West End, A Christmas Carol at the RSC, A
Tale of Two Cities at Greenwich and The Oxford Stage Company brings its
adaptation of Great Expectations to Richmond. With Martin Chuzzlewit still
rolling along on BBC2 and Hard Times scheduled for Christmas Day, there is
no escape from his gallery of rogues.
The enterprising Battersea Arts Centre has come up with a little hors
d'oeuvre to whet your appetite for the meatier Dickens to follow in the
shape of Sketches by Boz, an evening of newspaper articles by the young
novelist. The evening is conceived as an old-fashioned 'entertainment'
mounted, cabaret-style, in the cafe, where candles on the tables and food
and drink on offer create a convivial atmosphere.
On stage a cast of five work their way through half a dozen sketches adapted
for stage by Robert Butler and spliced together in Fair Play Theatre
Company's production with sardonic little ditties of the time. A
Dickens-like master of ceremonies at a lectern links the scenes and
occasionally stoops, with marvellous disdain, to speak the words of some
unsavoury character or other. The only other props are a piano, a table and
a couple of chairs, and round these the company presents a parade of
grotesques and unfortunates.
You can certainly see the young Dickens sharpening his satirical pencil for
the characters that were to people his novels. There is the gauche, gaunt Mr
Watkins Tottle, whose faint heart is trampled on by an unscrupulous 'friend'
and an insensitive young woman; there is the Scrooge-like killjoy who
delights in ruining his godson's Christening party; there is an artful
dodger deported by a judge who never looks up from his paperwork, and a trip
to the pawnbrokers reveals a cauldron of miserable souls.
The show gradually spirals downhill until the last sketch brings us to the
cell of a condemned prisoner in Newgate, Dickens writing with all his might
to convey to his readers the terror and misery of a man in such
circumstances.
These are clearly the work of an angry young man, who writes with more heart
than head in places - 'The Black Veil' is particularly melodramatic. But
this evening of miniatures, performed by a spry, witty company, is an
illuminating introduction to the young writer who was to become such a
household name - and seasonal companion.

   Christmas packages are arriving early at the
nation's theaters as movie companies try to lure holiday trade with
ghosts, hip dogs, baby dinosaurs and Bill Murray romping about in
yet another version of Charles Dickens' seasonal favorite, ``A
Christmas Carol.''
   Industry sources estimate that the holiday season will bring $300
million dollars worth of films. Why so many expensive films at
year's end?
   ``Because the six weeks from Thanksgiving through New Years Day
is the second biggest period of theater attendance, exceeded only by
summer,'' said Art Murphy, Daily Variety's financial expert. ``Those
six weeks amount to l4 percent of the year's business.
   ``It's unusual because the period includes a `chasm,' the second
week in December. That's the worst week of the year because children
are finishing school and others are Christmas shopping.''
   `Tis the season to be jolly, and the studios are responding with
a host of comedies. In ``High Spirits,'' Peter O'Toole attempts to
pass off his rundown hotel as a haunted castle, and ghosts,
including Daryl Hannah, actually appear.
   Dan Aykroyd in ``My Stepmother Is an Alien'' is a widowed
scientist who falls in love with spaceling Kim Basinger. Cybil
Shepherd discovers in ``Chances Are'' that her daughter's boyfriend,
Robert Downey Jr., is the reincarnation of her late husband.
   Also in the comedy grabbag is another treatment of the Dickens'
classic, ``A Christmas Carol.'' In Warner Bros. ``Scrooged'' Bill
Murray plays a crass TV executive who tries to exploit the Christmas
spirit but gets caught up in his own scheme.
   There's also ``The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!,''
with Leslie Nielsen and Ricardo Montalban as opponents in a
reworking of the memorable but brief 1982 TV series ``Police Squad.''
   Michael Caine and Steve Martin team as con men on the French
Riviera in ``Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.''
   Ivan Reitman (``Ghost Busters'') would have us believe in
``Twins'' that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito actually are.
   Parents will be pleased to learn that two new animated features
will appear during the holidays. ``Oliver and Company,'' a new twist
on ``Oliver Twist,'' with such voices as Bette Midler and Billy
Joel, bears the Disney imprint. It's about a bunch of rather hip
dogs and a cute little kitten who tangle with a loan shark and learn
what friendship is all about.
   Steven Spielberg and George Lucas acted as executive producers on
the dinosaur epic, ``The Land Before Time,'' produced by Disney
defector Don Bluth.
   The holidays are also a time for drama since the studios bring
forth their Academy Award hopefuls before the December 31 deadline
for qualification. Here are some of the most promising:
   ``Rain Man,'' with Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise as brothers on a
trip across the United States.
   ``Beaches,'' with Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey as long-time
friends striving to survive marriages and careers.
   ``Mississippi Burning,'' with Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe as
FBI agents investigating the murder of three civil rights workers in
the 1964 South. Based on an actual case.
   ``Talk Radio,'' Oliver Stone's (``Platoon'') version of the Eric
Bogosian play about an abrasive radio talk show host. Bogosian stars.
   ``Torch Song Trilogy,'' with Harvey Fierstein, Anne Bancroft and
Matthew Broderick in Fierstein's play about gay life in New York.
   ``Working Girl,'' with Harrison Ford, Sigourney Weaver and
Melanie Griffith in a drama-comedy about corporate life and love.
   The other attractions include: ``Cocoon II: The Return,'' with
most of the cast returning; and ``Tequila Sunrise'' with Mel Gibson
as a drug dealer who wants out of the business and Kurt Russell as a
narcotics cop who's his friend.
   No matter how these films fare with audiences, Daily Variety's
Murphy predicts another record year for the movie business.
   ``Grosses are already $130 million ahead of last year, and so
1988 is certain to pass the 1987 record of $4.25 billion.''

   An oil painting featuring Walt Disney
characters Donald Duck and Uncle Scrooge has been sold for $75,000,
it was announced Wednesday.
   Real estate developer Robert E. Hall of Harrisburg, Pa., bought
the painting by former Disney artist Carl Barks from Another
Rainbow, a Disney licensee.
   The painting, featuring Scrooge, Donald and siblings Huey, Dewey
and Louie, is named ``Makings of a Fish Story'' and was painted
earlier this year.
   Barks, who lives in Oregon, wrote and drew more than 500 Duck
family comic book stories from the 1940s to the mid-1960s. His most
famous original creation was the wealthy old miser, Scrooge.
   Another Rainbow publisher Bruce Hamilton said at least eight of
Barks' oil paintings have sold for more than $70,000.
   Hall said he sold stock to raise cash for the painting because
``I think it's a better investment for me at this time. Besides,
it's a lot more fun.''

ANN CONWAY: SCR WARMS UP FOR A CHRISTMAS TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Audience members laughed, cried and applauded until their hands ached at South 
Coast Repertory on Sunday. The occasion was the dress rehearsal of the 
theater's 11th annual production of "A Christmas Carol," Charles Dickens' tale 
about the transformation of the miser's miser (Hal Landon Jr.) into a grateful 
and giving sort of chap. 
</P>
<P>
"I cry every year," said SCR's director of development, Louise Cummings, after 
the show. "I sit there with tears streaming down my face the minute I think 
Tiny Tim might die." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Michaelson, who portrays the Spirit of Christmas Present, said playing his 
part is the perfect prelude to Christmas. "Nothing puts me in the spirit more," 
said the jolly fellow who sweeps around the stage in evergreen-velvet robes and 
a wreath of holly in his hair. 
</P>
<P>
But if those in Sunday night's audience -- composed of SCR staff, technicians 
and board of trustees -- thought they were moved by the play, they should see 
it again closer to Christmas, said Howard Shangraw (who plays Scrooge's nephew 
in the production). "The closer you get to the Big Day, the hotter the whole 
scene gets. It's magic." 
</P>
<P>
Among guests were Wendy and Dan Wheeler, vice president of Security Pacific -- 
underwriters and honorary producers of this season's production. The play will 
run from Thursday to Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Talk about getting into the spirit: Tickets are still available for what is 
certain to be the most touching concert of Orange County's holiday season. The 
Boys Choir of Harlem will perform at the Orange County Performing Arts Center's 
17th annual Christmas Candlelight Concert at the Hyatt Regency Irvine on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Choir director Walter Turnbull promises one hour of Christmas carols, 
spirituals, Mozart, and, are you ready? Duke Ellington! 
</P>
<P>
"I want to give an overall view of the kind of music we perform," said 
Turnbull, who founded the choir in 1968. Selections will range from Mozart's 
"Magnificat" to Ellington's "It Don't Mean a Thing (If You Ain't Got That 
Swing)." 
</P>
<P>
"The songs we perform are all in the spirit of education," said Turnbull, 
speaking of his choirboys and his audiences. "I try to help kids, who might not 
have had the opportunity, to experience music and understand their own 
heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the 150 choir members (30 will sing on Sunday) are from 
single-parent homes, Turnbull said. "They are from very poor families. In fact, 
if they weren't doing this they could very well be doing nothing -- be on the 
streets. This opportunity saves their lives -- keeps them busy and gives them a 
goal." Ciel Woodman is event chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
Catholic Charities: Bishops Norman McFarland and Michael Driscoll were among 
guests at an underwriting party at Deeann and Al Baldwin's Emerald Bay home on 
Sunday. Their goal? Helping to inspire guests to ante up underwriting funds to 
stage the Feb. 8 Mardi Gras ball sponsored by Catholic Charities of Orange 
County. Guests, who included arts activists Janice and Roger Johnson, enjoyed a 
wine reception and a video about the efforts of Catholic Charities before 
settling down to dinner catered by Pennington (the crepes Grand Marnier were so 
delicious that Al Baldwin went back for seconds). Among the programs supported 
by Catholic Charities are assistance for the elderly, lodging for the homeless, 
respite care for families with developmentally disabled children and helping 
the unemployed find work. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwins will be crowned king and queen at the fourth annual affair. (Past 
monarchs were Mary and Peter Muth, Art and Gaye Birtcher, and Gordon and Gale 
Lee.) 
</P>
<P>
"This is an opportunity to aid an agency that reaches beyond the Catholic 
community," Driscoll said. Helen Hawkins, a member of the Catholic Charities 
board, is gala chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas at the Ritz: Some (heavenly) things never change. Elegant holiday 
decor dripped from the walls and ceiling of the fashionable Ritz restaurant in 
Newport Beach on Saturday (the way it always does when the Fashionables, 
supporters of Chapman College in Orange, stage their holiday brunch). The 
chairwoman and Fashionables president -- Sandra Beigel and Mary Lou Hornsby, 
respectively -- stood with Christmas carolers outside the posh restaurant, 
greeting guests (the way they always do). And the mouthwatering menu -- soup en 
croute, poached Norwegian salmon and raspberry creme brulee -- was to die for 
(the way it always is). Why change a good thing? "Sometimes we think we might," 
said Hornsby, sitting at a table with her husband, Scott, and Chapman President 
Allen Koenig. "Then we don't." Nora and Charles Hester were honorary chairmen. 
Also on the scene: Ritz owner Hans Prager and his wife, Charlene. 
</P>
<P>
Don't miss: Don't miss the elegant exhibit of Tiffany &amp; Co. silver on 
display at the Decorative Arts Study Center in San Juan Capistrano. Word's out 
that it's tres divine. (Tiffany will also create the decor at Sunday's 
Christmas Candlelight Concert). . . . Feel like being someone's best buddy 
during the holidays? Then zip on down to Zeppa at Newport Center Fashion Island 
on Sunday at 6 p.m. for the Art of Friendship gala cocktail party benefiting 
Best Buddies of America, a nationwide volunteer program that pairs college 
students with handicapped people. The organization was founded in 1986 by 
Anthony Shriver. Mark Zigner is chairman.

   More and more Americans seem to be choosing to celebrate the
holiday season away from home.
   The American Automobile Association estimates that 25 million
Americans will hit the road during this Christmas holiday.
   For those who plan such a trip, there is now a second edition of
Patricia Carpenter's ``Away for the Holiday,'' a soft-cover
directory of domestic and foreign places to stay, holiday tours and
cruises, and a section on holiday traditions around the world.
   And, if you tend to associate the holidays with libations, there
is a list of toasts in foreign languages.

   New York City always has been a prime travel location during the
holiday shopping season.
   With the new publication of ``The Landmarks of New York,'' a
hefty $45 book by Barbaralee Diamondstein, visitors are guided
through designated historic landmarks from the Empire State
Building, Grand Central Terminal, Rockefeller Center, and
Tiffany's, to the manors and farms of the 18th century.
   All of the city's 800 designated landmarks and 52 historic
districts are featured.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Bill Murray Remains Off the Wall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the history of American entertainment in
the 1970s and '80s is written, a hefty chapter will be required for
``Saturday Night Live.''
   NBC's off-the-wall comedy series has produced almost as many
stars as did vaudeville in an earlier era, including: John Belushi,
Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, Bill Murray, Gilda Radner, Jane Curtin,
Albert Brooks, Laraine Newman, Joe Piscopo, Eddie Murphy, Brad Hall,
Jim Belushi, Billy Crystal, Christopher Guest, Rich Hall and Martin
Short.
   Murray has warm memories of his service (1977-80) with the Not
Ready for Prime Time Players:
   ``The most fun we had was when it was just us. After 6 o'clock on
Friday night, everyone would leave the building (RCA in Rockefeller
Plaza, New York). We wouldn't have hangers-on or guests or visitors.
It would just be the actors and the crew.
   ``That was fun that nobody else could have,'' he said. ``We're
the only ones who know what it was really like. From 6 o'clock to 11
o'clock, it was just work, execution and learning something. It was
one of the greatest schools anyone could ever have. Anyone who had
that job for more than six months can do anything. It was incredible
training.
   ``We all got goofy, but everybody gets goofy. We were in the
business of making funny television, hopefully. When you did it
right, that was more satisfying that getting drunk or throwing
bottles out of windows or whatever anyone says we may have done.''
   Many of the tricks Murray learned on ``Saturday Night Live'' can
be viewed in ``Scrooged,'' new from Paramount Pictures. It's an
update of ``A Christmas Carol'' with Murray as a TV network boss who
would make Scrooge seem like Mother Teresa. Most of the critics
didn't enjoy the movie, but the public did. The first weekend take
was a massive $13 million on 1,262 screens.
   Why another version of Dickens' oft-told tale?
   ``The incentive was to make a funny version of `A Christmas
Carol,' to give it a modern look and a 1980s social conscience,''
Murray said. ``Besides I wanted to work. I like to work. I'm a
better person when I work. It was better that I get a job; I was
deteriorating rapidly.''
   Of course, one never knows how seriously to take Murray's
remarks. It is true that he took a long breather after the megahit
``Ghostbusters'' and his dramatic mishap, ``The Razor's Edge.''
   What did he do on his vacation?
   ``Well, I was over in Paris for a while,'' he said. ``I studied a
little bit at the Sorbonne. I learned how to eat with a fork and
knife. They're really very good with a fork and knife over there in
France. They can eat anything with a knife and fork. They prefer to
eat yogurt with a knife and fork.
   ``They're much better than the English or the Dutch with
silverware. Every American should go to France to learn how to use
silverware. They've got something going there. I don't think even
the French know what they've got.
   ``The silverware thing is pretty much it for my vacation,'' he
quipped. ``There weren't any good scripts. They were all pretty
scary. You get lazy. Your momentum drops and you get so you can
barely leave the house.
   ``You get lazier and lazier. When I did `Scrooged,' it took me
weeks to get back into it. I wasn't really sharp at all. Usually,
just before lunch there's a big shot, and they like to get it. For
two or three weeks, I blew the take just before lunch and they said,
`That's OK, Bill, let's go eat; maybe that will help.' I wasn't
amusing anybody for a weeks.''
   Murray grew up in a funny family in Wilmette, Ill., near Chicago.
He was the middle of nine children who, according to family legend,
vied for the attention of their father, a lumber salesman with a
rare sense of humor. He continued trying to make his fellow students
laugh while attending a Jesuit school. After a brief stint at a
pre-med school in Denver, he drifted back to Chicago.
   His older brother, Brian, had joined Second City, the
improvisational comedy troupe that included John Belushi and Harold
Ramis. Murray studied at the company's workshop, then replaced
Belushi who moved on to New York. The Murray brothers and Ramis
followed soon afterward. Then came the explosion of ``Saturday Night
Live.''
   Murray's fresh, laid-back comedic style attracted movie interest,
and his first starring role was in Ivan Reitman's summer-camp
comedy, ``Meatballs.'' He bombed in ``Where the Buffalo Roam,'' a
mistaken attempt to capture gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson in a
movie. Then came another Reitman romp, ``Stripes,'' followed by
``Ghostbusters.''
   In 1989, the ``Ghostbuster'' gang returns for the long-awaited
sequel.
   ```Ghostbusters' was the most fun we ever had making a movie,''
said Murray. ``It was just funny people doing a funny movie. Even
though there was a lot of waiting because of the special effects, we
really had a lot of fun. I've known these guys (Aykroyd, Ramis,
Reitman) for a long time. We laughed a lot.''

bellowing laughs of jolly men in bright red suits. But one December night 
brings the mysterious rhythms of drums and rattles played by winter night 
spirits dressed in black and white.

Santa Barbara residents have gathered to celebrate the summer solstice, the 
longest day of the year, for the past 14 years. But 6 to 8 p.m. Friday marks 
only the second annual winter solstice festival, celebrating the longest night 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
And although both summer and winter solstice dates are important spiritual 
markers for many cultures, present and past, "the spirits which inspire winter 
solstice are quite different from the spirits which inspire summer solstice," 
said Michelle Bernes, coordinator of the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
So although the highlight of summer solstice is a lighthearted, colorful 
parade, winter solstice offers a mysterious, magical processional. This year's 
theme is magic of the night, and a masked sorceress and sorcerer will conjure 
magical feats, Bernes said. 
</P>
<P>
Revelers are asked to dress in black and white, as they believe a "winter night 
spirit" looks. They should also bring drums and rattles and meet at the gardens 
of the Santa Barbara Courthouse at 6 p.m. Musician Jim De Fazio will lead the 
group in a musical candlelight procession to De La Guerra Plaza, followed by 
celebratory dancing. 
</P>

Like its summer counterpart, winter solstice is a non-commercial event and 
participants' costumes cannot display any slogans, words or recognizable 
symbols. No animals or motorized vehicles are allowed. Call 964-3727.
