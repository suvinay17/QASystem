   Talk about odd couples: one is calm, Jewish
and deaf, the other is excitable, black and blind.
   That's the basis for the new comedy-adventure, ``See No Evil,
Hear No Evil.'' Wally, the deaf one, is played by Gene Wilder.
Dave, who is blind, is Richard Pryor. It's the third pairing of the
two disparate stars, whose careers and personal lives have had a
bumpy ride in recent times.
   Wilder, born Jerry Silberman in Milwaukee 53 years ago, won an
Academy nomination for Mel Brooks' ``The Producers,'' starred in
``Blazing Saddles'' and ``Young Frankenstein,'' directed himself in
``The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother'' and ``The
World's Greatest Lover.'' His film appearances have been few in
recent times, largely because of the illness of his wife, the
comedian Gilda Radner, who has been treated for ovarian cancer.
Pryor, 48, who grew up in his grandmother's Peoria, Ill., brothel,
has starred in headlines almost as much as movies. His marriages,
divorces, paternity suit, near-death and recovery from burns while
freebasing have made lively reading. He wrote and directed the
autobiographical ``Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling.'' His recent
films have been overshadowed by the new kid on the block, Eddie
Murphy.
   Wilder and Pryor co-starred successfully in ``Silver Streak''
and ``Stir Crazy.'' Before the opening of ``See No Evil, Hear No
Evil,'' they sat down for a joint interview. Here are highlights of
that conversation:
   Q. Both of you have directed your own films. Was there ever a
time during this movie when you wanted to say, ``Hey, let's do it
this way''?
   Pryor: Arthur Hiller directed this picture. To me, it was just
amazing how he kept the geometry of the picture in his head. He
always knew something that nobody else knew.
   Wilder: The only thing I wanted to say was, ``Thank you, thank
you, thank you, for staying for the rushes until 9:30, for eating
your dinner at 11, and getting to the set before anyone else, and
answering all those questions about the props and the lights and
costumes. Thank you for letting me go off when shooting is over,
take my time, take a little stroll.''
   Q. But you both will direct again, yes?
   Pryor: Unfortunately, yes. That's something you don't get over.
It's great fun.
   Wilder: Yes, I'll direct again. If I write something and I say,
``This I will have to direct,'' I will. If it's personal enough, it
might get lost somewhere. Otherwise, I'll let someone else direct.
   Q. What is that magic chemistry that seems to work between you
two?
   Wilder: We've talked about it, believe me. But we've said,
``Let's shut up, because we don't know the answer.'' We might get
in trouble if we tried to intellectualize it.
   Pryor: I'm just glad it works.
   Wilder: It's there, it works: cold fusion. I don't know how or
why.
   Q. Don't you ever get a little bit exasperated with each other
and say, ``Hold it, we can do this better''?
   Wilder: It's not an exasperation with each other. It's like,
we've done (a scene) 10 times and everyone's anxious to get on to
the next setup and Richard has a sad face. I know it wasn't right
all the way, but I see that sad face, and I say, ``What's the
matter?'' ``I don't think it was so good.'' ``I don't think so,
either. Arthur, oh Arthur.'' He doesn't question that we don't
think it was there yet.
   Q. Gene, how would you analyze Richard's comedy?
   Wilder: I don't know if he should hear this. He came up in
comedy from a different road, and we seemed to have met somewhere
at a similar point, but from very different backgrounds. I don't
think it matters much what the path was. I laugh at him, and I make
him laugh. Together we're very funny. That's the only thing that
counts.
   Q. Richard, can you analyze Gene's comedy?
   Pryor: I want to listen to him, I know that. I listen to what
he's saying, and it triggers something in me. That's one element:
listening to him. It's a pleasure.
   Wilder: When most actors do a scene 14 times, it will be pretty
much the same each time; it's not the nature of the art, but it's
the nature of the beast.... If we did a scene 14 times, it's going
to be different 14 times. Not only do you have to pay attention,
you're compelled to pay attention.
   Q. There are a lot of laughs in ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,''
making comic use of deafness and blindness. Are you worried that
some people might say you're poking fun at infirmities, just as
they criticized ``A Fish Called Wanda'' for making fun of
stuttering.
   Wilder: We don't think so. We took great pains for months before
the first day of shooting to make sure there would be no fun made,
to make sure ... that people with seeing and hearing disabilities
would be laughing.
   Pryor: Gene did a lot of research here at the Braille Institute
and went through the script to eliminate anything that might be
offensive. He was very aware of it, and so was I. Arthur Hiller,
too.
   Q. You did some research of your own, Richard?
   Pryor: Yes, I went to the Braille Institute and studied to find
out what it would be like if you were blind after being sighted
most of your life. I wanted to find out what not to do, and the one
thing I was told was: ``Don't tap your cane.'' Little things like
that were very helpful.
   Q. You've had personal trials, Gene, with Gilda's illness.
What's the situation now?
   Wilder: Gilda's got a book coming out in June called ``It's
Always Something.'' Everything you want to know is in the book. ...
I didn't work for 2{ years or three years. When I started working
on this picture, it was a great relief. I was back home where I
belong.
   Q. And you, Richard? You haven't been in the public prints
lately.
   Pryor: Good! Today I'm a very happy man. I'm thrilled about the
work we've done in this film. I was delighted with the work Gene
did on the script (he shares credit with four other writers). I
liked working with an excellent director and very good actors. We
worked hard to make it look like we were not working hard. I'm
happy.
   Q. What about future projects?
   Pryor: I'm working in a film now, ``Harlem Nights,'' with Eddie
Murphy.
   Wilder: I'm writing. I want to write something that's right for
Richard and me.

PRYOR, WILDER TEAM UP FOR MORE FUNNY BUSINESS

"See No Evil, Hear No Evil" (citywide) is an apt title for this brisk,
ingenious and funny comedy that happily reunites Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder.
Pryor's Wally is blind, and he is as proudly stubborn about acknowledging his
disability as Wilder's Dave is about admitting that he is totally deaf. They
skirmish mightily upon meeting each other, but Dave recognizes enough of
himself in Wally to hire him as an assistant at his Manhattan lobby newsstand.
</P>
<P>
Wally doesn't even have a chance to start work before he and his new boss are
swept up in non-stop adventure.
</P>
<P>
A spectacular brunette (Joan Severance) coolly leaves a bullet-riddled corpse
in front of the newsstand. Wally and Dave are the prime suspects. Director
Arthur Hiller, who first teamed the duo in the 1976 "Silver Streak," and a raft
of writers (Wilder among them) not only never let up with a steady stream of
comic catastrophes but also manage to have fun with Wally and Dave in a way
that makes them seem like heroes, full-fledged participants in the human comedy
that engages us all. The crazy gags and predicaments are never at their
expense; the film deftly shows how the two men need to accept their limitations
before being able to triumph over them. Part of this process is their
realization of their need for each other's friendship.
</P>
<P>
All of these sentiments, be assured, are left to subtext as the film careens
merrily along. Pryor has a wonderful comic moment when necessity dictates that
he pass himself off as a Swedish authority on geriatric sex, complete with
yumpin' yimminy accent. This is just the broad mainstream comedy that both
stars need in the wake of recent less-than-terrific pictures. They play off
each other better than ever, and the good-looking "See No Evil, Hear No Evil"
(rated R for raunchy language, some nudity) leaves us hoping we haven't seen
the last of Wally and Dave. Maybe next time around there will be time for them
to find girlfriends.KEVIN THOMAS

The posters promoting Paramount Pictures' "Funny About Love" show Gene Wilder
in a wacky pose with an alarm clock and baby perched on top of his red-blond
Brillo hair. The image is typical of how audiences have come to perceive the
actor, best known for an endearingly guileless slapstick schtick that has
defined his on-screen persona from 1968's "The Producers" through his last
film, 1989's "See No Evil, Hear No Evil."
</P>
<P>
However, those actually seeing the movie, which opened Friday, will find a far
different Wilder than they have encountered before. In "Funny About Love," he
plays a romantic leading man, and, really going against the comedy grain, the
character is not always particularly likable.
</P>
<P>
Duffy Bergman (Wilder) is a cartoonist, engulfed by adulation and awards, but
lonely for love. When finally found in the character of Meg (Christine Lahti),
Duffy's frantic desire for a baby drives first an emotional, and then a
physical wedge between them.
</P>
<P>
"The character is different than anything I have done before," said Wilder, who
has begun reassessing his career since the death last year of his wife, Gilda
Radner. "In many of my past scripts, we just got to the humor as fast as
possible. With Duffy, I could work more to create a whole character."
</P>
<P>
Wilder says that he began rethinking his career during the making of "See No
Evil, Hear No Evil" while Radner was battling ovarian cancer. "I had a lot to
do with the writing of ("See No Evil, Hear No Evil")," Wilder said, "not the
plot, but some of the scenes with Richard (Pryor), when we were talking as
human beings and not being chased by cars. It was gratifying to say I was
talking from my center and not from some loony-tunes cardboard character.
</P>
<P>
"I was in the middle of a lot of things as far as my heart's desire for work
was concerned. I thought if I did work I wanted to be more of a human being."
</P>
<P>
Wilder said that he was surprised that Leonard Nimoy, who directed "Funny About
Love," saw this need in him too.
</P>
<P>
"I had never met him before," Wilder said, "and I don't know how he knew . . .
'Blazing Saddles' and 'Young Frankenstein' and 'Stir Crazy' and 'Silver Streak'
. . . How would he know to put me in this?"
</P>
<P>
Nimoy, who met Wilder at his Connecticut house to offer him the part, said, "I
have seen a lot of his work. I see a very gifted person. I see an extremely
intelligent person. I see a person capable of great comedy and great
sensitivity. The role is that of a funny, turbulent and troubled guy, and I
thought he could handle it. I think the tremendous depth he is capable of will
surprise people. . . . He is capable of bringing great comedy out of a
wellspring of deep emotion like (Charlie) Chaplin."
</P>
<P>
Wilder said that when he met Nimoy, he asked, "Why me?," and the director
answered, "Because I want the audience to forgive Duffy, and they might not
forgive someone else."
</P>
<P>
Making the film fulfilled many of Wilder's hopes for such a project.
</P>
<P>
"The day-to-day work on the film was a constant surprise for me," he recalled.
"Surprises about myself and the emotion that would fill a scene. I wouldn't
have a clue what was going to happen sometimes and then, when it hit, it was so
big that I was shocked afterward."
</P>
<P>
Wilder continues: "I'm an all right actor. A fairly good actor. But I'm a great
reactor . . . and I had something to react to all the time. I felt at this
point in my life and in my career my task in this film should be 'don't act.'
Just go with what was happening at the moment, and don't try to work out clever
things."
</P>
<P>
If Wilder feels so comfortable with the change in his screen persona, part of
his ease derives from his training as a classical actor.
</P>
<P>
Born in Milwaukee 55 years ago, Wilder began acting at 8, doing comic skits to
divert his ill mother. At 13, he started private dramatic training and while in
his late teens appeared in summer stock productions of Tennessee Williams and
Arthur Miller plays. He continued with drama at the University of Iowa and
later studied the physical aspects of acting -- gymnastics, fencing (he became
a champion fencer) and movement -- at London's Old Vic theater school before
returning to New York and embarking on a stage career.
</P>
<P>
His first play was Arnold Wesker's "Roots," quickly followed by his Broadway
debut as the comic valet in Graham Greene's "The Complaisant Lover."
</P>
<P>
Wilder's first film role was that of the terrified undertaker in 1967's "Bonnie
and Clyde." "Instead of being conventionally frightened, I put on an act of
trying not to be afraid which was, I guess, amusing," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was a year earlier, while acting with Anne Bancroft in Brecht's "Mother
Courage," that Wilder met her husband Mel Brooks and eventually began a
collaboration that put his career on the comedic track that made him a star. It
also resulted in a number of outrageously satirical films, beginning with "The
Producers," in which he co-starred with Brooks and the late Zero Mostel.
</P>
<P>
"If it weren't for Mel," Wilder said with a laugh, "I'd still be doing
temporary typing for a living, and selling toys at F.A.O. Schwarz for $1.40 an
hour. I played with the trains all day."
</P>
<P>
Does Wilder believe his wife's death propelled his career in its new, more
serious direction?
</P>
<P>
"Yes -- but I wouldn't be foolish enough to deny what the nature of my talent
is. I don't want to do 'Hamlet.' I don't want to do Robert Redford roles or Mel
Gibson roles or Kevin Costner roles because I'm not going to be good at them. I
don't want to do a tragic clown (either). I want to do what I can lend my
talents to, but I want it to be as a human being and not as a two-dimensional
character."
</P>
<P>
Wilder said of the sad times before and after his wife's death: "I thought for
a while that I wouldn't be working anymore, and then I thought even if I wanted
to, no one would ask me. Then, I found to my amazement, I suppose because of
VCRs and cable, no one thought of me as gone because they saw me last week.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't done overlapping films like this, starting one before the other has
opened, in a long time," he said of his new project,
</P>
<P>
Wilder is now at work on Peter Bogdanovich's "Another You," filming in New York
and co-starring (again) Richard Pryor. The film, about a con-man (Pryor) and a
pathological liar (Wilder) will continue the evolution of his persona.
Bogdanovich said of Wilder's part in the new film, "He's really playing a
character part in this, kind of a sad sack who is also very funny."
</P>
<P>
Beyond this point? "I've come to a point now where I like not to plan, I won't
say more than a day ahead, but more than a week at a time," Wilder said
quietly.
</P>
<P>
"You never know what is going to happen. Once I say I'm going to do a movie, I
do it -- I'm very professional that way, but, otherwise, I don't like to think
ahead.I have no plans for films after this. I trust if your life is right, the
right things will happen at the right time. If the chords are in harmony
inside, I think other things will happen in the same way. That sounded
highfalutin to me once, but I believe it now."

<P>
The Sunday evening movie lineup is one of the strongest in memory, commencing
at 6 p.m. on Channel 5 with Mel Brooks' hilarious 1974 horror picture spoof,
Young Frankenstein, with Gene Wilder heading a terrific cast.
</P>
<P>
Chariots of Fire (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.), the 1981 multi-Oscar winner,
traces the parallel lives of two very different athletes who became part of the
remarkable British track and field team at the 1924 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Silent Victory: The Kitty O'Neil Story (Channel 9 Sunday at 7 p.m.) is an
exceptionally well-made 1979 TV movie with Stockard Channing starring in this
real-life story about a deaf woman who became one of Hollywood's top stunt
women.
</P>
<P>
If anything, Mel Brooks' 1968 debut film The Producers (Channel 5 Sunday at 8
p.m.) is even funnier than "Young Frankenstein." It's a zany farce in which
Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder come up with a cockamamie scheme to profit from
staging a terrible play.
</P>
<P>
The 1972 Frenzy (Channel 13 Sunday at 8 p.m.) is the finest of Alfred
Hitchcock's last films, a thriller set in his native London and dealing with a
man (Jon Finch) wrongly accused of being a serial killer.
</P>
<P>
The Karen Carpenter Story (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) stars Cynthia Gibb in the
title role of this new TV movie about the popular singer who died at 32 from
the affects of anorexia nervosa. Mitchell Anderson plays Carpenter's brother
and singing partner Richard.
</P>
<P>
The 1984 Gremlins (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful
Life" turned inside out, upside down and pickled in brine, a sweet-and-sour
comedy featuring an invasion of a small Middle American town by a horde of
fast-multiplying, deceptively cute, furry creatures.
</P>
<P>
The 14th James Bond adventure A View to a Kill (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a
so-so affair, with Roger Moore beginning to look a little weary as 007 (Timothy
Dalton would replace him in the next Bond, the 1987 "Living Daylights"). This
time the villain is Christopher Walken, intent on destroying Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
Watching Terry Gilliam's 1985 Brazil (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), an
exploding cigar in the face of the future, is like watching Gilliam's head
erupt in public. Everything that has ever made an impact on the film maker
seems to be whirling by in this brilliant, exhausting, savagely funny
post-Orwellian satire, set in the gray confines of the Ministry of Information
where his shiningly innocent hero (Jonathan Pryce) toils in his cherished
anonymity. Gilliam's targets are the usual Monty Python concerns: modern
technology and the men who run it, terrorists, repairmen, bureaucrats, the
plastic surgery industry, the ad game and sticklers for detail, wherever they
are.
</P>
<P>
Terror on Highway 91 (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, stars Ricky
Schroder in the true story of a young man who exposes police corruption in a
small southern town. George Dzundza and Matt Clark co-star.
</P>
<P>
Blake Edwards' 1979 10 (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 10
p.m.), a modern comedy classic, stars Dudley Moore as a popular composer who,
in the clutch of middle age, pursues a beautiful young bride (Bo Derek) all the
way to Mexico, where she is honeymooning. This is a superbly constructed film
which makes shrewd observations of the American obsession with sex and youth,
California-style.
</P>
<P>
The Man in the Brown Suit (CBS Wednesday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie updating
Agatha Christie's 1924 mystery novel about a young American woman (Stephanie
Zimbalist) traveling through Egypt in search of adventure. Rue McClanahan, Tony
Randall and Edward Woodward star.
</P>
<P>
Rob Reiner's 1984 This Is Spinal Tap (Channel 28 Friday at 11:30 p.m.) is one
of the funniest movies of the decade, a delicious sendup on the making of a
rock documentary in which Reiner casts himself as a film maker trying to make a
record of a seedy English group on tour. The line between parody and reality
becomes exceedingly and riotously thin.
</P>
<P>
The dreadful 1986 comedy Armed and Dangerous (CBS Saturday at 8 p.m.) plays
like a third-generation dupe print of "Police Academy," with frantic splices
from "Beverly Hills Cop." John Candy and Eugene Levy star as a pair of goofy
misfits adrift in a Los Angeles populated entirely by bozos, nitwits, boobs and
cads.
</P>
<P>
Brian De Palma's 1983 remake of Howard Hawks' 1932 gangster classic Scarface
(ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.) moves the action from Chicago in the '20s to Miami's
Cuban community of the present, but for all its operatic razzle-dazzle, it
becomes a lurid exercise in wretched excess. Al Pacino has the title role as a
doomed drug kingpin.

In Superman (Channel 13 Sunday at 6 p.m.), that romantic and thoroughly
entertaining 1978 fantasy, we're introduced to the comic-book hero who comes
from the planet Krypton -- Marlon Brando, no less, is his father -- to save
Metropolis. Christopher Reeve is as perfect as shy, awkward, myopic Clark Kent
as he is as Superman, embodiment of the invincible hero.
</P>
<P>
Perry Mason: The Case of the All-Star Assassin (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a new
TV movie in which an injured hockey star (Jason Beghe) is accused of murdering
a sports mogul (Pernell Roberts). Raymond Burr stars as Mason.
</P>
<P>
Outrageous Fortune (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is an often hilarious female-bonding
movie that allows Shelley Long's upper-class aspiring actress and Bette
Midler's earthy waitress-cum-actress to be sensational together and as
individual presences. Under Arthur Hiller's direction, this 1987
comedy-adventure has a smart, raucous drive.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday at 6 p.m.) is a
disappointing Tom Hanks comedy that finds him cast as the most arrogant rich
boy in Yale's class of '62, who wings off to the jungles of Thailand with the
Peace Corps. Instead of satirizing the incipient activism of the New Frontier,
it's essentially just another mean-spirited yuppie comedy. John Candy co-stars.
</P>
<P>
Paul Brickman's Risky Business (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is a genuinely
funny comedy-fantasy about a young man (Tom Cruise) who, under the sway of
seductive young hooker Rebecca De Mornay, turns his handsome suburban Chicago
home into a brothel while his parents are away.
</P>
<P>
Connie Sellecca and Wendy Kilbourne star in the new TV movie Turn Back the
Clock (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) in which a woman who kills her husband at midnight
on New Year's Eve gets a chance to prevent this from happening.
</P>
<P>
In the swift-moving 1986 series pilot Popeye Doyle (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8
p.m.), Ed O'Neill of "Married . . . With Children" has the title role as the
rough-and-tumble New York City detective first played by Gene Hackman in "The
French Connection."
</P>
<P>
In A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.),
the morbid tone of the original has given way to horror comedy set off by quite
spectacular and imaginative fantasy sequences. This installment is no less
grisly than its predecessors, but at least it invites you to laugh at it.
Robert Englund is back as the hideously disfigured child murderer Freddy
Krueger.
</P>
<P>
Once Bitten (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a modest, enjoyable 1985 comedy
in which Lauren Hutton, undoubtedly the world's most beautiful vampire, is
finding it harder and harder to locate male virgins whose blood is essential to
preserving her eternal youth.
</P>
<P>
Slick and scarcely subtle but undeniably potent, Steven Spielberg's Jaws
(Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) builds single-mindedly to its big, scary
climax involving that awesome shark. Roy Scheider, Robert Shaw and Richard
Dreyfuss star.
</P>
<P>
Animal House (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) was the first in a long line of
movies about the outrageous pranks of college kids obsessed with booze, bad
language and nubile women. John Belushi stars as the worst slob on the campus,
circa 1962. For all its exaggerations the film's roots are firmly established
in the reality of the Greek system at the time.
</P>
<P>
In the delightful Superman II (CBS Thursday at 8:30 p.m.) our hero (Christopher
Reeve) must at last confront his invincibility, choosing between the woman he
loves, Lois Lane (Margot Kidder), and the world he has vowed to protect.
</P>
<P>
The Man in the Santa Claus Suit (Channel 2 Saturday at 8 p.m.), a 1978 TV
movie, stars Fred Astaire (playing seven different characters) in a frothy
Yuletide fantasy about how the proprietor of a costume shop changes the lives
of many people.
</P>
<P>
Directed by Arthur Hiller, Silver Streak (Channel 5 Saturday at 8 p.m.) is
pleasant and amusing, even if takes a tad too long to arrive at its literally
smashing finish. Gene Wilder and Jill Clayburgh become entangled in adventure
and romance aboard a train bound from L.A. to Chicago. Richard Pryor, as an
amiable crook, steals the picture.
</P>
<P>
The Freshman (Channel 28 Saturday at 10 p.m.), a 1925 Harold Lloyd classic,
finds Lloyd in the title role as a wet-behind-the-ears frosh desperate to be
liked.

<BYLINE>By RIC LEYVA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gilda Radner, a star in the early ``Saturday
Night Live'' comedy show who died at age 42 after a lengthy battle
with cancer, talked about confronting ``the Big C'' in her
forthcoming autobiography.
   ``I got a little cocky,'' she writes in ``It's Always
Something,'' due out in June. ``I always had a twinkle in my eye as
though I'd touched the face of God ... I was plenty full of myself.
   ``What I've learned the hard way is that there's always
something you can do. In some cases, death seems more desirable.
But there is always something you can do.''
   The creator of such memorable television characters as New
York-street smart reporter Roseanne Roseannadana, speech-impeded
talk show host Baba Wawa and out-of-sync editorialist Emily Litella
died of ovarian cancer Saturday with husband Gene Wilder at her
side.
   Miss Radner, who was diagnosed with the cancer in 1986, died in
her sleep at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said hospital spokesman
Ron Wise.
   She had radiation therapy and other treatments, including
surgery, as recently as February. She re-entered the hospital
Wednesday, Wise said.
   The comedian told a Life magazine interviewer in 1988 that
``cancer is about the most unfunny thing in the world.''
   In her book, Miss Radner writes that she did not see cancer in a
humorous light at all times, but there were moments.
   ``The next thing you know, I'm kind of running down the street
with my arms spread out in this raincoat yelling in a Captain
Midnight voice, `Cancer Woman,' look at her go!''
   In recent years Miss Radner appeared in several movies, but was
best known for roles in sketches on NBC's ``Saturday Night Live,''
with such stars as Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase, Jane Curtin, Laraine
Newman, Garrett Morris, Bill Murray and the late John Belushi.
   The show brought her an Emmy Award for outstanding performance
by an actress in a variety series.
   On Saturday's show, host Steve Martin _ visibly choked with
emotion _introduced a 1978 clip in which he and Miss Radner did a
comic dance. ``You know, when I look at that tape I can't help but
think how great she was and how young I look,'' Martin said.
``Gilda, we miss you.''
   ``I loved her like a sister,'' Aykroyd said through a
spokeswoman. ``My thoughts are with Gene and her family.''
   Miss Radner had a ``very natural effervescence that seemed to
come out of her during those five years,'' Morris said. ``It was
just an electric thing that would even help you get through a
performance if you were down.''
   A Detroit native, Miss Radner attended the University of
Michigan and began her entertainment career in the Toronto Company
of ``Godspell,'' then became a member of the ``Second City''
improvisational group.
   She was chosen for the original cast of ``Saturday Night Live''
in 1975, and stayed with the show until 1980.
   She met Wilder in 1981 on the set of the movie ``Hanky Panky''
and the romance blossomed three years later while making ``The
Woman in Red,'' which was written and directed by Wilder.
   A return to television as a special guest on ``It's Garry
Shandling's Show'' earned her an Emmy nomination for comedy
performance in 1988.

   Comedian Gilda Radner, who created Roseanne
Roseannadanna, Emily Litella and a brace of other goofy characters
as part of the original cast of ``Saturday Night Live,'' died early
today of cancer, a hospital official said. She was 42.
   Miss Radner, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer about 2{
years ago, died in her sleep about 6:20 a.m. at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, said hospital spokesman Ron Wise. Her husband of
five years, actor-filmmaker Gene Wilder, was at her side.
   On ``Saturday Night Live,'' which premiered on NBC in 1975, Miss
Radner gave life to such characters as the scatterbrained
broadcaster Ms. Roseannadanna, whose catch phrase, ``It's always
something,'' became the title of a book she wrote detailing her
fight with cancer.
   ``I loved her like a sister,'' grieving fellow ``Saturday
Night'' star Dan Aykroyd said in comments relayed by spokeswoman
Susan Patricola. ``My thoughts are with Gene and her family.''
   Besides the nasal-voiced TV news commentator, she also created
the Baba Wawa character, a spoof of news interviewer Barbara
Walters, as well as the nerdy teen-ager Lisa Lubner and the dowdy
Ms. Litella, who delivered misguided opinion pieces on such things
as ``violins on television,'' backing off a sweet ``Never
mi-i-i-i-ind'' when her error was pointed out.
   Miss Radner was rewarded with an Emmy Award for outstanding
performance by an actress in a variety series.
   Born in Detroit, Miss Radner began her professional career in
the Toronto Company of ``Godspell,'' then became a member of the
Toronto company of ``Second City,'' the improvisational group that
also gave Aykroyd his start.
   She was a writer and performer for the New York-based ``National
Lampoon Radio Hour'' and its stage counterpart, the ``National
Lampoon Show,'' in the early 1970s and in 1975 was selected for the
original cast of ``Saturday Night Live.''
   While working on ``Saturday Night Live,'' she also showed her
comic abilities on Broadway in 1979 with ``Gilda Live.'' It was
later produced as a movie and then an album, ``Live From New York
Gilda Radner.''
   After ``Saturday Night Live'' she appeared in several films,
including ``First Family,'' ``The Woman in Red,'' a 1984 hit
written and directed by her co-star, Wilder; as well as ``Haunted
Honeymoon,'' ``Hanky Panky'' and ``It Came From Hollywood.''
   She also starred in the Broadway play ``Lunch Hour'' with Sam
Waterson, in 1980.
   As an author she wrote a book of humor, ``Roseanne
Roseannadana's `Hey, Get Back to Work' Book.'' An autobiographical
account of her battle with cancer, ``It's Always Something,'' was
due to be published next month.
   Miss Radner entered Cedars-Sinai on Wednesday, hospital
spokesman Wise said.
   She had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1986 and underwent
nine months of chemotherapy. She also had radiation therapy and
other treatments, including surgery as recently as February.
   The treatments sent the disease into temporary remission and the
comedian told a Life magazine interviewer in 1988 that ``cancer is
about the most unfunny thing in the world. But it doesn't mean you
have to die.''
   ``In fact,'' she told the magazine with a defiant edge to her
voice, ``I think I've never been as healthy and as well as I am
now.''
   Wise said funeral services will be private.

'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' STAR GILDA RADNER DIES AT 42
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN KENDALL, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Comedian Gilda Radner, who made millions laugh with the zany characters she
created as a member of the original cast of television's "Saturday Night Live,"
died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after a long struggle with ovarian
cancer.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old performer had fought the disease for 2 1/2 years and had
recently written a book about her struggle. She died in her sleep, with her
husband, actor Gene Wilder, at her side, friends said.
</P>
<P>
Radner entered Cedars-Sinai on Wednesday for treatment of side effects from
earlier treatments, according to a hospital spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"She fought hard," said associate Rachel McCallister. "She was a very brave and
courageous lady, and she didn't give up easily."
</P>
<P>
As a gawky, squawky-voiced satirist, with a frizzy tangle of hair, Radner
created such characters as Roseanne Roseannadana, a gross, lisping newscaster;
Emily Litella, a dithery, confused editorialist; Candy Slice, a masochistic
punk rock star, and co-ed Rhonda Weiss, a gum-chewing Jewish "princess" from
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
Her characterizations brought her an Emmy in 1978 for outstanding performance
as an actress on "Saturday Night Live," where she was a member of the Not Ready
for Prime Time Players with Chevy Chase, John Belushi, Bill Murray and Dan
Aykroyd, who all went on to stardom.
</P>
<P>
The actress fought cancer with anger, hope and humor, according to an account
of her struggle detailed in her book, "It's Always Something," which will soon
be in stores.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Most Unfunny Thing'
</P>
<P>
In excerpts in the June issue of Redbook, Radner wrote: "Cancer is probably the
most unfunny thing in the world, but I'm a comedienne, and even cancer wasn't
going to stop me from seeing the humor in what I was going through. The last
thing that I wanted was to be tragic."
</P>
<P>
Born in Michigan, Radner sometimes referred to herself as "this Jewish girl
from Detroit." She studied drama at the University of Michigan, leaving to join
a Canadian production of "Godspell," the religious rock musical, staged in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
She moved on to become a member of Toronto's "Second City" improvisational
comedy troupe, an offshoot of the famed Chicago company. Her fellow performers
included Aykroyd and Murray, who would be with Radner again when "Saturday
Night Live" premiered on NBC in October, 1975.
</P>
<P>
While still on the show, Radner appeared in 1979 in a short-lived, one-woman
Broadway show called "Gilda Live," which was produced as a movie a year later
and as an album, "Live From New York Gilda Radner."
</P>
<P>
She left "Saturday Night Live" in 1980, making five films and appearing in a
Broadway play in the next six years. The movies included "The Woman in Red" and
"Haunted Honeymoon," both written and directed by Wilder, whom she met on the
set of the film "Hanky Panky" in 1981 and married three years later in southern
France. They had homes in Southern California and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Not Quite Grown Up
</P>
<P>
"I'm at the edge of growing up," Radner said in a July, 1986, interview. "I
don't miss 'Saturday Night Live.' I feel less of a need for the fulfillment
that performance used to give. . . . I don't have to do everything right away.
As long as I can walk and jump, I'll still perform, but I no longer feel such a
compulsion."
</P>
<P>
Radner did not know then that her greatest challenge lay ahead. She learned
that about two months later when doctors told her she had ovarian cancer and
discovered during hysterectomy surgery that the malignancy had spread to her
liver and bowel.
</P>
<P>
"The three weeks I spent at the hospital recovering from surgery, I amused
myself by making the nurses laugh and racing up and down the halls with my IV
stand while Gene chased me," she wrote in her book. "How could I be happy under
the circumstances? I don't really know -- except that I discovered that I have
a strong spirit and a powerful will to survive."
</P>
<P>
Still, she said, it was impossible for her not to feel sorry for herself when
she became ill and her hair fell out because of chemotherapy treatment, and she
started to introduce herself by saying, "I used to be Gilda Radner. Because
that was how I felt -- that now I was someone else."
</P>
<P>
Radner credited a "sprinkling of angels," including Wilder, and doctors, nurses
and fellow cancer patients for helping her fight the disease. "Gene never gave
up," she said. "He believed in me and never treated me like my days were
numbered."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Joined Self-Help Group
</P>
<P>
Prompted by a psychotherapist, she joined the Wellness Community, a cancer
self-help group in Santa Monica whose members were all fighting different
stages of the disease.
</P>
<P>
"I was learning that death is part of life," Radner wrote. "It seems to me now
that as long as we have the gift of life, the only tragedy is to allow part of
ourselves -- our spirit, our creativity, our glorious uniqueness -- to die."
</P>
<P>
Radner's friends were stunned by news of her death. Aykroyd said in a
statement, "I loved her like a sister. My thoughts are with Gene and her
family." The current "Saturday Night Live" cast planned an immediate tribute to
her.
</P>
<P>
Friends who attended the all-girls Liggett school with Radner in Detroit said
the actress missed a 25th class reunion two weeks ago. "We really missed her,
and we didn't know she was as bad as she was," said classmate Betty Irwin.
</P>
<P>
Besides Wilder, Radner leaves her mother, Henrietta, and a brother, Michael.
Memorial services will be private. The family requested that in lieu of flowers
donations be sent to the Wellness Community.

to fame as a lovable lush in the movie ``Arthur,'' has married
aspiring actress Brogan Lane, a week after his Valentine's Day
proposal, his agent said.
   Moore, 52, and Miss Lane, 28, were married Sunday by a justice
of the peace at The Little Church of the West Chapel, said agent
Lou Pitt.
   Moore met Miss Lane six years ago on the set of the film ``Six
Weeks,'' according to publicist Paul Bloch. They were re-introduced
three years ago at a restaurant and have been together since.
   Moore's marriages to actresses Suzy Kendall and Tuesday Weld
ended in divorce. It was Miss Lane's second marriage. Each has a
son.
   ``The two hope to star in a film together in the future and are
looking for projects,'' said Bloch.

   Pianist Van Cliburn says he stopped
playing in public in 1978 because he needed a short rest.
   Cliburn broke his long silence with a White House performance
during December's summit meeting between President Reagan and
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``To be honest, I never thought the `intermission' would go on
for 10 years,'' Cliburn said in an interview published in Sunday's
Dallas Morning News. ``I guess it went on so long because I felt
relaxed and was having such a good time simply living.''
   Since the White House performance, he has had numerous offers
but has so far accepted only one _ conductor Zubin Mehta's
invitation to accompany the New York Philharmonic on its first tour
of the Soviet Union in 15 years.
   Cliburn will appear as soloist with the orchestra in concerts in
Leningrad and Moscow during May and June, 30 years after he won the
Tchaikovsky International Competition.
   He said he would perform in his home state of Texas next season.

   Deaf actress Marlee Matlin is working with a
speech pathologist to improve her speaking skills, according to
People magazine.
   Miss Matlin, who won an Oscar for best actress for her portrayal
of a deaf-mute in ``Children of a Lesser God,'' will be presenting
this year's best actor award. She plans to say, ``The envelope,
please,'' rather than use sign language, the magazine says in this
week's edition.
   She also has a speaking role in the planned CBS movie with Anne
Bancroft, ``The Bridge to Silence.''
   ``She needed a lot of work,'' said her speech pathologist, Dr.
Lillian Glass. ``Her voice was flat, monotone, and she talked too
fast.''

   Filmmaker John Waters says there are
similarities between his first PG-rated movie and his 1972 midnight
classic ``Pink Flamingos,'' which is still outraging audiences.
   ``Hairspray,'' a comedy about an overweight girl who becomes a
star on a local television dance show, makes its debut this week.
Divine, the 300-pound transvestite star of ``Pink Flamingos'' plays
the mother of the heroine of ``Hairspray.''
   ``I knew this was one of the few obsessions I ever had that
would be palatable to (general) movie executives,'' the 41-year-old
Waters said of ``Hairspray'' in an interview published Sunday in
The New York Times.
   ``The sensibility and sense of humor in `Hairspray' is the same
of `Pink Flamingos.' The difference is that I don't have the rage
at 41. I'd be a jerk.''

   In her ``Saturday Night Live'' heyday, Gilda
Radner poked fun at people and just about everything else, but when
she learned 17 months ago that she had cancer she found life was
not as funny.
   ``Cancer is about the most unfunny thing in the world,'' Radner
said in an interview in March's Life magazine. ``But it doesn't
have to mean you die.''
   Although Radner had lost much weight and hair during her
chemotherapy, she has a new attitude today.
   ``Radner needs little provocation to yank up her sweater and
show off her newly `fat' stomach, and after eight months of
baldness, her unruly brown hair (with a bit of gray at the temples)
has grown back in a thick thatch,'' according to the magazine.
   She has also stopped smoking and eats more wholesome food.
   Twenty years ago, the average life expectancy of a patient with
ovarian cancer was between six and seven months. It is still the
most lethal of pelvic cancers, with less than a 30 percent recovery
rate.
   Although Radner, 41, will not be considered well unless her
remission continues for at least 1{ years, she said ``I think I've
never been as healthy and as well as I am now.''
   She credits her turnaround to her excruciating medical
treatment, which included surgery, nine months of chemotherapy
injections and 30 radiation sessions.
   Her 52-year-old husband, actor Gene Wilder, said: ``Each time
Gilda had to go through one more treatment, and she'd be vomiting
and writhing in pain, I'd ask myself, `How much can a human being
take?'''
   Had Wilder not been around, Radner is certain she could not have
taken so much, the magazine said. Wilder has not worked since she
was diagnosed.
   Radner also credits meetings she's attending with the ``Wellness
Community,'' a cancer self-help group.
   And she's working three hours a day on a book about cancer.
   ``That's what one of my favorite visualizations is about,'' she
said. ``Every day ... I imagine myself sitting in Doubleday's, with
people lined up to have me sign my book. I'm well. And I'm
adorable.''

   Patrick Swayze says he is ``attracted to the
dark side of things,'' and wants his acting to convey the ``wild
man'' in him.
   ``It's that instinctual, innate part of you, your power, that,
if used constructively, can be an incredibly productive force. But
off-kilter the least bit, it'll kill you,'' Swayze said in an
interview in May 29's US magazine.
   ``I'm real intrigued by that edge. It can create an
unpredictable, dangerous performance.''
   In his latest film ``Road House,'' which opens this weekend,
Swayze has a sexy love scene with co-star Kelly Lynch. He said he
sought advice from his wife, actress Lisa Niemi, on how to do the
scene.
   ``I pictured Lisa in my mind,'' Swayze said. ``I'm pretty much
in love with her. She's still the most beautiful woman I've ever
seen.''

   He's already played the biggest stage of the

   Atwater was the keynote speaker at Saturday's 1989 State
Republican Convention in Columbia. Afterward, he showed off his
guitar-playing prowess at his wife's Union High School Class of
1969 reunion.
   The crack campaign strategist said he was attending a meeting in
New York recently when he was asked if he would like to appear at
Carnegie Hall in a gala with the New York Pops orchestra.
   ``I told them I would see if I could be available. A little
later, I took the band to lunch at the White House, and one of them
remarked that they had now `done it all but play at Carnegie Hall,'
and I called the people in New York, and they said I could bring my
band with me. So a week from Monday night (May 22) will be the
highlight of my musical career, playing Carnegie Hall,'' he said.

   Comic actor Gene Wilder, back on the big screen
after a three-year break to help wife, Gilda Radner, overcome
ovarian cancer, says the struggle has made him appreciate life much
more.
   ``Life is very short,'' he said. ``You hear it, you know to say
it. Everyone says, `I know, I know,' but ... if they knew they'd
stop doing what's unimportant and do what is important. There's no
time for anything else. And it's too sad to learn it when it's too
late.''
   Wilder is busy promoting his new movie, ``See No Evil, Hear No
Evil,'' in which he again teams up with Richard Pryor. He said he
is ``more instinctively attuned to'' Pryor than any other actor.
   ``I don't know why it is,'' Wilder said in an interview in May
29's US magazine. ``I find that it's more sexual than it is
artistic, and when I say sexual, I mean the response is emotional:
pleasing, caring for each other.''
   Wilder said Radner's bout with cancer nearly drove him crazy.
   ``Only when I did the movie did my sanity start to come back,''
he said.

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher says
she's determined to fight for her beliefs, even if some people find
her toughness unladylike.
   ``I'm driven to be confrontational,'' she said in an interview
in June's Vanity Fair. ``I have had to learn to be combative to get
it across. Of course, when you're a woman and you're combative they
say you're an iron lady. Let me tell you, if you hadn't got a spine
which was strong and firm, and a will which was strong and firm, we
would never have got through.''
   The daughter of a small-town grocer, Thatcher married and had
twins while studying to become a lawyer. When her children were 6,
she was elected to parliament for the first time and went on to
lead the Conservative Party.
   She's now in her third term as prime minister. And although she
has been compared to Elizabeth I, Queen Victoria and Winston
Churchill, Thatcher says her historical counterpart is actually an
American.
   ``You go back to the person who really had to fight for what he
believed in and _ I couldn't begin to compare myself with him _ it
was Abraham Lincoln.''

   ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' and
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' were a winning combination in
the weekend box office sweepstakes, claiming first and second place
in ticket sales.
   The Star Trek movie grossed $17.4 million at the nation's
theaters and Indiana Jones attracted another $16 million in its
third week, according to figures released Monday by Exhibitor
Relations Co.
   Paramount's ``Star Trek V,'' directed by and starring William
Shatner, enjoyed the best opening weekend of any of the previous
``Star Trek'' movie adaptations.
   The studio's latest installment of Steven Spielberg's ``Indiana
Jones,'' surpassed the $100 million mark, making the Harrison Ford
comedy-adventure the fastest movie to pass the threshold.
   The summer movie season will enter full swing within the next
three weeks: ``Ghostbusters II'' opens on Friday, ``Batman'' arrives
on June 23 and ``Great Balls of Fire,'' ``Do the Right Thing'' and
``Karate Kid III'' will debut on June 30.
   In its first week of wide release, Robin Williams' ``Dead Poets
Society'' sold $7.5 million of tickets to finish in third place. In
fourth place was the Richard Pryor-Gene Wilder crime comedy ``See No
Evil, Hear No Evil,'' with receipts of $3.4 million.
   The Kevin Costner baseball film ``Field of Dreams'' landed in
fifth on grosses of $3.1 million. It was followed by the Hulk Hogan
wrestling film ``No Holds Barred'' falling to sixth place with a
gate of $2.9 million. ``Road House,'' with Patrick Swayze as a bar
bouncer, was seventh with $2.2 million.
   ``Renegades,'' a police movie starring Kiefer Sutherland and Lou
Diamond Phillips, finished in eighth with grosses of $1.6 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Pet Sematary'' in ninth with $1.5
million and ``K-9'' in 10th with $1.4 million. Clint Eastwood's
clunker ``Pink Cadillac'' dropped out of the Top 10, as did ``Major
League.''
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,'' Paramount, $17.4 million,
2,202 screens, $7,890 per screen, $17.4 million, one week.

"Harlem Nights" is the first movie to co-star Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor.
Watching the sorry, unfunny mess that has resulted is like witnessing a highly
touted heavyweight title bout that inexplicably turns into a pat-a-cake session
between cruiserweights. Even those of us who have just about given up on Murphy
hoped the pairing with Pryor would snap him to attention. But it's been a long
stretch since either Murphy or Pryor has thrilled audiences with anything more
than their star power.
</P>
<P>
There was a time -- say, seven or eight years ago -- when such a confab would
have raised the rafters. Murphy began his four-year stint at "Saturday Night
Live" during the 1980-81 season, and his appearances on that show, with his
impersonations of pimps, jailbirds, Gumby, Buckwheat and Bill Cosby, are still
his comic high point. He could create characters that had the whole country
talking about them the next day. Pryor, of course, had a thriving if uneven
movie career in the early '80s. His glory, however, was his stand-up comedy
films, particularly the 1978 "Richard Pryor Live in Concert" and the 1982
"Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip." They were the movies in which Richard
Pryor could be Richard Pryor.
</P>
<P>
In the intervening years, Murphy has become a major movie star largely at the
expense of what made him a TV star. He has moved away from the quicksilver,
revue-sketch humor and the edgy playfulness of his "SNL" days and turned
himself into a commodity. His comic facetiousness has turned stone-cold.
Whereas he once professed his idol to be Richard Pryor, his movies suggest
another deity: Sylvester Stallone.
</P>
<P>
Murphy is a movie star because his films make fortunes, but is there anything
stellar about his work as a '30s nightclub dandy in "Harlem Nights," a movie in
which his character's homicidal streak is played for cheap laughs? Is there
anything anointed about his work in such films as "The Golden Child," "Coming
to America" or "Beverly Hills Cop II"? His reprehensible 1987 stand-up comedy
film "Raw" begins when, leather-suited, he strides on stage amid hoopla not
inappropriate to the Second Coming. The film was a real potpourri of hatred. In
it, his free-floating hostilities descend on women, gays, whites, blacks --
take your pick. To review it was to leave the domain of criticism for
psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
Stardom can sometimes enlarge an actor's possibilities and bring out what was
nascent, and best, in his talents. The reverse seems to have happened to
Murphy. In "SNL," he was part of an ensemble; he was challenged by the other
performers. In his movies, starting with his first (and still best) film, "48
HRS," where he co-starred with Nick Nolte, Murphy has essentially been
performing solo. He works with such crackerjack precision that sometimes he
doesn't need anybody else around; he can be his own most appreciative audience.
</P>
<P>
But Murphy desperately needs to be challenged in the movies. Yet, given the
fact that he controls them so completely -- he is writer, director and
executive producer of "Harlem Nights" -- how will that ever happen? His clout
has allowed his worst instincts to come through.
</P>
<P>
Richard Pryor is playing his surrogate father in his new film, but there's an
element of condescension in the casting. Pryor is positioned as Murphy's wise
and cautious mentor, an elder statesman. It's the kind of "tribute" that's
indistinguishable from neutering.
</P>
<P>
If Eddie Murphy's star power has allowed him all too successfully to tincture
his films with the poison of his stand-up-comedy attitudes, then Richard Pryor
has the opposite problem. His box-office clout has allowed him the opportunity
to make a series of marginal movies with virtually no connection to his great
stand-up persona. In films ranging from "The Toy" to "Bustin' Loose" to
"Brewster's Millions," Pryor has opted for the cushiony comforts of family
entertainment. With his pick of writers, directors and co-stars, he has
nevertheless willingly led himself into creative oblivion.
</P>
<P>
It's never been easy for a volatile talent to score in the movies; the
commercial demands of the business are invariably at odds with true
subversiveness. But Pryor has the kind of control that might have preserved his
rawness on film, not only in his concert movies, but in his dramatic films too.
The cuddliness of his screen image is a sick joke. It might seem like a put-on
if only Pryor showed some sign that he was in on the con. But he is resignedly
bland in his movies; anything malign or threatening has been bleached out.
</P>
<P>
With an artist as troubled and complicated as Pryor, it's difficult to assign
motivation. Does a film like "Bustin' Loose," where he plays a good-natured
grump to a busload of kids, represent what Pryor thinks the movies deserve?
Does he think such movies represent what he deserves? Obscenity has always been
the fuel of Pryor's art, and these roles can't accommodate it.
</P>
<P>
He has never quite given up entirely, though. Bad as it was, his 1986
autobiographical film "Jo Jo Dancer, Your Life Is Calling," which he also
directed, was at least an attempt to scour the treacle from his image. In films
like the 1972 "Lady Sings the Blues," playing Piano Man to Diana Ross' Billie
Holiday, the 1978 "Blue Collar," where he played a Detroit auto worker, and the
1981 "Some Kind of Hero," where he played a POW returning from Vietnam, he gave
indications of wanting to do more as an actor than just make nice. For years
there was talk that he was preparing a biography of Charlie Parker.
</P>
<P>
The problem may be that Pryor believes that, in order to quell his demons, he
can't draw on anything in his life that means anything to him. In "Live on the
Sunset Strip," talking about his recuperation after his free-basing accident,
he says, "Maybe I ain't funny anymore. Maybe I ain't hungry at nothing for real
in my heart." But the triumph of that film was that Pryor demonstrated he could
be an artist without working up a fount of rage. Pryor has been funnier than he
was in that film, but he was never as mysteriously moving, or as fragile.
</P>
<P>
Actually, Pryor has always been mischaracterized as a riotous comic. He was
never really a social-activist crusader; his stand-up riffs exposed racism, but
his humor was deeply personal, screwed up, aloof. The Get Whitey agenda of the
early '70s never quite played for Pryor as it did for the other black comics
and actors because Pryor was after private demons, not white demons.
</P>
<P>
Regarding whites, he went beyond rage and into stupefaction. (That's what made
the scene in "Silver Streak" where he attempts to teach Gene Wilder how to be
black such a howl.) His landscape was ultimately interior. He could split
himself into an entire gallery of characters: winos, junkies, hustlers, movie
executives, ex-wives. He could animate inanimate objects, like, most memorably,
his cocaine pipe in "Live on the Sunset Strip." The only thing Pryor can't play
is normal, and that, ironically, is what he's set out to be in movie after
movie.
</P>
<P>
The history of black performers in the movie business is such a trail of waste
and despair that the ascension of Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor has symbolic
value out of all proportion to their actual achievement. With few exceptions,
black actors have only been accepted as stars when they are comics.
</P>
<P>
This must explain some of Eddie Murphy's rage. Deprived in his early movies of
any love interest with his white female co-stars, straitened into situations
where he played the black sidekick joker to white actors, he has
overcompensated by shunting his creative energies into a makeover that probably
means a lot more to him than it does to audiences. His attempts to promote
himself as a stud action-hero with a curdling cruel humor must function as a
kind of retribution for him. For some of us, it's a punishment.

Home Fires Burning (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), a new "Hallmark Hall of Fame"
presentation, depicts the impact of World War II upon a small Southern town.
Barnard Hughes stars as the editor of the local paper who is the conscience of
the community.
</P>
<P>
She Knows Too Much (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), another new TV movie, tells of a
federal agent working with a cat burglar who is the key to the solution of a
high-level murder in Washington. Meredith Baxter Birney and Robert Urich star.
</P>
<P>
Ghostbusters (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is the 1984 mega-hit comedy starring Bill
Murray, Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis as three whimsical chaps in pursuit of
things that go bump in the night; their leading lady is Sigourney Weaver.
</P>
<P>
Oh, God! Book II (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is not so much a sequel as an
alternate version of George Burns trying to set his Earthly house in order with
a little help from his friends. As before, the script does a clever tap dance
around the pitfalls of blasphemy and sentimentality, but the novelty has worn
off. Nonetheless, thanks to Burns, it's a cheerful enough family entertainment.
</P>
<P>
In Blake Edwards' 1986 That's Life! (CBS Monday at 9 p.m.), one of the masters
of movie comedy takes on some grim subjects: familial strife, decay and
mortality -- and turns them into one of the funniest, most-life embracing films
he has ever made. Edwards imagines a married couple in the throes of an almost
unbearable weekend, one in which the husband (Jack Lemmon) is feeling sorry for
himself with the advent of his 60th birthday while his wife (Julie Andrews) is,
unknown to him, waiting out the results of a biopsy.
</P>
<P>
Runaway Train (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.), Andrei Konchalovsky's lurid 1985 film
based on Akira Kurosawa's nightmare tale of imprisonment, sadism, revenge and
liberation, finds a dark train hurtling through a wintry wasteland with its
brakes burned off and three passengers aboard: Jon Voight's escaped killer, his
nervous, adoring pal Eric Roberts and a thin, pigtailed railway employee
(Rebecca De Mornay). It may be existential, but it's also ultra-violent; too
bad Kurosawa never got to do the film himself.
</P>
<P>
One of the most famous movies of all time, Alfred Hitchcock's classic Psycho is
back (on Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), and its 1986 sequel Psycho III airs on
Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.

The 1983 Going Berserk (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is episodic, graceless,
often outrageous and sometimes crassly funny. John Candy stars as a nerdish
part-time limousine driver and aspiring drummer whose fiancee (Alley Mills) is
kidnaped by a religious aerobics cult leader (Richard Libertini) for his own
crazed purposes.
</P>
<P>
Dream Breakers (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie, takes a look at
corruption in big business through a Chicago building contractor (Robert
Loggia) and his two very different sons, one eager to get ahead no matter what
(D.W. Moffett), the other a dedicated priest (Kyle MacLachlan).

Gene Wilder's 1986 Haunted Honeymoon (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is an
amusing, bouncy horror comedy that has fun not only with the old-dark-house
genre but also those corny but beloved scare shows of the Golden Age of Radio.
It may be slight but it does put a smile on your face and keep it there. In the
film, it's 1939 and radio mystery stars Wilder and Gilda Radner are to be
married in his great-aunt's Charles Addams-style estate.
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 Poltergeist: The Other Side (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) the
Freeling family (JoBeth Williams, Craig T. Nelson, Heather O'Rourke and Oliver
Robins) are suffering from something far worse than supernatural terrors: the
Inevitable Sequel. They're put through pretty much the same scary paces but
without the hardness or urgency of the original.

Mellow, beautiful, rich and brimming with love, Woody Allen's 1986 Hannah and
Her Sisters (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is perfection itself. It's Allen's
best yet, revealing greater emotional complexity, more understanding of the
foibles of others, and less edgy about his own. Smart, funny and touching, the
film is set deep in the lives of a vibrant family whom we follow from
Thanksgiving to Thanksgiving over a two-year period. At its heart are three
sisters: the sustaining Mia Farrow, the stunning Barbara Hershey and the
fragile, skittish Dianne Wiest.

Directed by Billy Woodberry and written and photographed by Charles Burnett,
the 1984 Bless Their Little Hearts (Channel 28 Friday at 11 p.m.) is a deeply
compassionate yet unrelenting study of a black family man (Nate Hardman) caught
up in a losing struggle to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
The Last Picture Show (Channel 28 Saturday at 10 p.m.) is the fine 1971 film by
director Peter Bogdanovich about the lives of people in a small town in Texas
during the 1950s and how they begin to change when the only movie theater in
town prepares to close. Featured are compelling performances by Cloris
Leachman, Ellen Burstyn and Ben Johnson.

<HEAD>Pryor Moved From Intensive Care, May Resume Fishing Trip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRISBANE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors took Richard Pryor out of
intensive care Saturday, four days after the actor-comedian
suffered a mild heart attack, hospital officials said.
   Pryor's agent said Pryor may resume his fishing vacation after
he is released from the hospital.
   Pryor, 49, was admitted to Wesley Hospital after suffering a
heart attack Tuesday. He was listed in stable condition Saturday.
The hospital administrator, Douglas Killer, said Pryor probably
would be discharged by Tuesday.
   ``He's fine and progressing well,'' the hospital official said.
``We're very pleased with him. It's given him quite a fright but
he's in good spirits.''
   Killer said the comedian was watching video cassettes in his
room.
   Pryor, star of ``Harlem Nights,'' ``Stir Crazy,'' and many other
films, collapsed while vacationing on the Gold Coast strip in
northeastern Australia. He was admitted to hospital with chest
pain, later diagnosed as a minor heart attack.
   His agent, Guy McElwaine, said Pryor was in Australia to fish on
the Great Barrier Reef for marlin ``and then planned to go to New
Zealand to fish for trout. He may still do that, depending on how
he's feeling.''
   The comedian was burned severely and nearly killed in 1980 while
freebasing cocaine, which involves heating the drug over an open
flame.
   He recounted that experience and other hardships in his life in
the films ``Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip'' and ``Jo Jo
Dancer, Your Life is Calling.''
   Other film credits include ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,''
``Brewster's Millions,'' ``Critical Condition,'' ``Richard Pryor
Here and Now,'' ``Richard Pryor Live in Concert'' and ``Richard
Pryor Is Back Live in Concert.''
   Pryor is due to start filming ``My Silent Partner'' with Gene
Wilder in May.

   ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' featuring the
comic adventures of a blind Richard Pryor and a deaf Gene Wilder,
was the No. 1 movie at the box office last weekend, taking in $6.1
million.
   ``Road House,'' with ``Dirty Dancing'' star Patrick Swayze as a
nightclub bouncer, debuted at No. 2 with close to $6 million in
weekend receipts as compiled by Exhibitor Relations Co.
   ``Field of Dreams,'' the Kevin Costner baseball fantasy that
brings big leaguers to a Midwest cornfield, moved down a notch to
third place with a gate of $5.1 million.
   ``K-9,'' a movie about a loveable police dog and his police pal
Jim Belushi, dropped a place to No. 4 with a $3.3 million draw,
followed in fifth by the Stephen King's thriller ``Pet Sematary.''

``Miss Firecracker'' with Holly Hunter as a last-minute beauty
contestant, came in at No. 10 with $787,266.
   ``Miss Firecracker'' may have placed 10th in total take, but the

<LEADPARA>  IF the summer lineup tells us anything, it's that comedy is still king. Almost
half the movies due from now to Labor Day are either romantic comedies or
shaggy-dog lampoons. These range from "Mystery Date" and "Love Potion  9" to
such genre sendups as "Hot Shots: An Important Movie!" (Charlie Sheen in a
goof on "Top Gun") and "Suburban Commando" (Hulk Hogan's galactic warrior
subbing for you know who).;    Among the more keenly awaited rib-ticklers:

   Blacks have been appearing in mainstream movies
ever since Erich von Stroheim first employed black actors in 1928
in ``The Wedding March.'' Until then, black characters were played
by whites in blackface.
   But the black characters Hollywood wrote into scripts were
always servants, buffoons or evil rapists who could barely speak
English.
   As a reaction to this racial discrimination, blacks from the
very earliest days of the motion picture were producers and
directors and owned their own film companies.
   Some treasures of early black cinema are now featured on a
one-hour cassette from VCI Home Video. The compilation of rare and
historic footage comes from the Black Cinema Collection of the
Southwest Film-Video Archieves in Tyler, Texas.
   The collection of 22 all-black movies from the 1930s and '40s
was discovered in a warehouse in 1983. The 35mm nitrate prints were
deteriorating in most cases, but were the last copies of the
movies, which depicted the reality of black life as opposed to the
Hollywood stereotypes.
   In the earliest days of the motion picture, black characters
were portrayed in Hollywood movies as emblems of depravity,
especially in terms of sexuality. With talkies, blacks became the
quintessence of song and dance, cast primarily as preachers,
servants or clowns. In more modern times _ and even today _ many
white filmmakers continue to see blacks in those ways.
   Independent black filmmakers emerged in the 1920s, and showed
features that reflected black life: the middle and upper-middle
class, black entrepreneurs, scientists, gangsters, entertainers,
educators, scholars, lawyers, beauty queens, cohesive families.
   More than 100 black film companies made low-budget, primarily
B-movies for black theaters. The most notable filmmakers of this
time included Noble and George Johnson, and Oscar Micheaux who made
Paul Robeson's first movie, ``Body and Soul,'' in 1924.
   Scenes from ``Body and Soul'' are featured on the video, as are
``Boogie Woogie Dream,'' Lena Horne's first movie short; ``Rufus
Jones for President,'' in which an 8-year-old Sammy Davis Jr.
dances; and ``St. Louis Blues,'' with Bessie Smith.
   ``That's Black Entertainment'' will be available on VHS for sale
or rental beginning Jan. 30. The suggested retail price is $29.95.

   ``How to Get Ahead in Advertising'' (Virgin Vision. VHS-Beta,
$89.95. Rated R)

   Imagine a pimple growing into a head. But not just any head _ a
replica of your own head. Only it has a mind of its own, and a lust
for power.
   Dennis Bagley (Richard E. Grant), one of the ad world's leading
stars, finally meets his waterloo when he's given a pimple cream
account. He just can't seem to master it _ he can't come up with an
idea or campaign. That's when his zit appears.
   Soon, it winks at him. Then it turns into a talking head. Bagley
blames the evil advertising world on his problem and resolves to
divest himself of all commercialism and tell the world about how
advertising dupes the public.
   The pimple, though, will have none of that do-goodism and
honesty; it wants to fill every home with products and items that
no one really needs or wants.
   The battle of the heads in ``How to Get Ahead in Advertising''
is curious, bizarre and at times distasteful. The plot becomes
almost existential, but the ending is a cop-out.
   Rachel Ward co-stars as Bagley's wife, Julia. The director is
Bruce Robinson (``Withnail and I''), who was nominated for an
Academy Award for his screenplay for ``The Killing Fields.''

   ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil'' (RCA-Columbia Home Video.
VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)

   Two men witness a murder and are accused of doing it. One is
blind and one is deaf. Go figure.
   But the result is a riot of fun with Richard Pryor as the blind
guy and Gene Wilder as the deaf guy.
   ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil'' is a pure delight, and Pryor and
Wilder, who have paired together before in ``Silver Streak'' and
``Stir Crazy,'' are truly the Abbott and Costello of the 1980s. The
chemistry between the two comic manias is wonderful.
   In proving their innocence, the two handicapped lads have a
merry romp that includes a car chase (the blind Pryor drives),
posing as famous doctors and courting death with the real killers.
   Kirsten Childs is the perfect balance as Pryor's sister, and
Kevin Spacey is campy as one of the killers. Joan Severance, his
counterpart, doesn't hold up as well.
   ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil'' is the perfect prescription for a
gloomy day.

   Hollywood is betting that summer audiences will go for
Kevin Costner with a crossbow, firemen as the new action
heroes and Arnold Schwarzenegger as the $100 million man.
   Undeterred by a spate of high-cost flops over the last
year, studios are pouring an unusually high number of movies
-- many with bloated budgets -- into an extremely competitive
market. "You have about 50 movies this summer, compared to
about 35 last year, and 17 of them are due out before July
4," says Arthur Cohen, who heads marketing at Paramount
Pictures Corp. "There are some weekends with four or five
movies coming out at once."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The increase stems in part from the resurgence of such
studios as Columbia, Tri-Star and Fox, which have stepped up
production under new management. Even troubled Orion Pictures
and MGM/Pathe Entertainment Inc. continue to turn out movies.
"The studios have all increased their release schedules,"
says Philip Garfinkle, executive vice president of
Entertainment Data Inc.
   The studios could use a boost this summer; according to
data compiled by the show business trade paper Variety,
ticket sales, at $1.44 billion for the first four months, are
slightly ahead of last year's $1.39 billion. But in April,
ticket sales skidded 19%.
   Some high-profile movies originally scheduled for summer
release, like Columbia's "Radio Flyer" and Disney's "Billy
Bathgate," have been pushed back to later dates, in some
cases to avoid the crush and in others because the
productions are running behind schedule. Studios continue to
shuffle release dates, and some other movies may drop out of
the lineup before the crush begins. With so many films vying
for audiences, marketing budgets are spiraling upward, too,
and studios are looking for unique ways to promote their
films.
   Making even its most profligate rivals seem like pikers is
Carolco Pictures Inc. Through its distribution arrangement
with Tri-Star Pictures Inc., it is releasing "Terminator 2,"
the sequel to the violent futuristic action film starring Mr.
Schwarzenegger. Although Carolco declines to disclose the
budget, it is said to be between $85 million and $100
million, making it the most expensive movie in recent
history.
   But Carolco is sanguine about its prospects. Roger Smith,
executive vice president, acknowledges that "the budget
started out at a huge number and went slightly above that."
But he insists that the company has covered all of its costs
through its usual pattern of overseas advances and
guarantees. Moreover, he says, the movie's special effects
are the most spectacular on film, and there are few other
action movies in the competition this summer.
   The first "Terminator," released in 1984, was only a
modest hit at the box office, selling about $38 million of
tickets. But the movie was a cult hit in video and overseas,
and Mr. Schwarzenegger has since gone on to become a
mega-star. "Total Recall," his movie last summer under the
Carolco/Tri-Star banner, sold $182 million of tickets at the
U.S. box office and has taken in a healthy sum so far
overseas, Mr. Smith notes.
   The opening dates of other big budget films in the violent
action and adventure category are far enough away from
"Terminator 2" to avoid direct competition. Tri-Star, a unit
of Sony Corp.'s Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc., is
releasing its own "Hudson Hawk," starring Bruce Willis as a
reformed cat burglar who has to commit one more theft, on May
24. Tri-Star executives dispute reports that the film's
budget is creeping up into the $60 million range, saying the
budget is closer to $45 million.
   Theater owners are particularly high on more romantic
action films, including "Backdraft" and "Robin Hood: The
Prince of Thieves." The latter is yet another remake of the
classic tale being jointly produced by independent Morgan
Creek and Time Warner Inc.'s Warner Bros. unit. With a
reported budget of about $50 million, the film is a gamble.
But with Mr. Costner as the star, theater owners are betting
male and female audiences will flock to the film after his
triumphant "Dances with Wolves," which swept the Oscars this
year and has earned more than $165 million at the box office.
   Theater owners also expect "Backdraft" to appeal to both
men and women, with its theme of firefighters as both heroes
and heartthrobs. Premiere magazine calls it "an '80s action
film with a '90s conscience. Every boy wants to be one. Every
girl wants to hug one (or be one too)." The film, which
includes footage of real fires, cost about $35 million, was
produced by Imagine Films Inc. and will be distributed
through Universal Studios, a unit of Matsushita Electric
Industrial's Co.'s MCA Inc.
   Other movies on the big-budget risk list include Walt
Disney Co.'s "The Rocketeer," an unusal movie based on a cult
comic strip of the 1980s. Set in the Los Angeles aviation
community in 1938, it focuses on the adventures of pilot
Cliff Secord, who finds an experimental rocket pack that
allows him to fly but must protect the device from bad guys
who want it. Disney bills the movie as "a classic story of
good vs. evil in the tradition of such heroes as Indiana
Jones and Luke Skywalker."
   Disney also has a relatively expensive comedy -- "What
About Bob?" -- that stars Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfuss.
But Disney executives maintain that their film slate is
primarily more modestly budgeted films that reflect the
studio's new determination to control costs. Among those
movies: "Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken," about a young stunt
rider who comes back from a crippling accident, and
"Warshawski," starring Kathleen Turner as a tough private
investigator. Then, of course, there is "101 Dalmations," an
animated classic that will cost Disney virtually nothing to
reissue and should bring in lots of money.
   Other studios, too, maintain that they are avoiding the
big-budget trap. Executives at Fox, a unit of News Corp.,
boast that their entire movie schedule for the summer will
cost less than some of their competitors have spent on one
movie. The Fox slate currently includes eight or nine films
whose budgets range from about $7 million for a comedy, "Love
Potion No. 9," to $25 million for an action comedy about a
band of misfit Navy pilots called "Hot Shots."
   Paramount, a unit of Paramount Communications Inc., has
been among the hardest hit recently by disappointing results
from high-cost movies. Though the studio isn't releasing any
of its costly trademark sequels, it does have one sequel that
many theater owners are betting could be the summer's comedy
hit: "Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear." The spoof, like
the original, is based on the goofy "Police Squad" TV series.
   Paramount also has high hopes for a number of more
modestly budgeted films developed during the regime of
recently departed Chairman Frank Mancuso. Among them is
another comedy, "Soapdish," a spoof of soap operas starring
Sally Field and Whoopi Goldberg, and "Regarding Henry," which
stars Harrison Ford as a tough lawyer who undergoes a
personality change for the better after surviving a shot in
the head.
   As usual, studios are counting heavily on comedies.
Columbia Pictures is releasing "City Slickers," starring
Billy Crystal as one of several New Yorkers who go on a
modern-day cattle drive, while Universal has a sequel,
"Problem Child II," and Tri-Star teams Gene Wilder and
Richard Pryor in "Another You." Orion's sequel to "Bill and
Ted's Excellent Adventure" and "Mystery Date" are both
comedies.
   With the crowded field, studios are trying some unusual
marketing efforts to get their films noticed. Orion, which is
getting a jump on the summer rush by opening a sequel, "F/X
2," this Friday, conducted a direct mail campaign to 43
million homes that Executive Vice President David Forbes says
was a "huge success." The mailing promoted a special
interactive 900 telephone number that enabled callers to win
prizes, including a Pontiac and a video recorder. And Warner
is planning a network special on the making of "Robin Hood."
   Tri-Star, which is handling the marketing for "Terminator
2," has been promoting the movie heavily through science
fiction conventions nationwide. It plans a special "T2
Science Fiction Convention" in Los Angeles prior to the
movie's opening in July. The studio is also doing a major
in-store promotion with the Subway sandwich chain, including
posters, banners and "T2" cups.
   Even little movies are getting special promotions:
Tri-Star is taking the canine star of "Bingo," about a dog's
search for his boy, around to shopping malls and country
fairs.

SOME SEE NO HUMOR IN 'SEE NO EVIL'

<P>
I am debating whether to see the new movie comedy smash, "See No Evil, Hear No
Evil" or wait for the sequel, which is sure to be on the drawing boards.
</P>
<P>
Can you imagine what the stars, Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder (who play a blind
man and a deaf man, respectively) and producer Marvin Worth and director Arthur
Hiller could do with epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease?
Wouldn't those be blockbusters?
</P>
<P>
And kudos to such eminent critics as Kevin Thomas (May 12 review) for
possessing a sense of humor that I obviously lack.

Is there no decency left in a society in search of the dollar?

NATIONAL FILM TREASURES RUN THE GAMUT
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The list of 25 films cited as national treasures by the Library of Congress
Tuesday seems to have been careful not to favor particular genres or directors.
John Ford, Billy Wilder and Victor Fleming had two films each on the list,
while James Stewart and Humphrey Bogart were the only actors to have more than
one film on the list. Seventeen of the movies were filmed in black-and-white,

colorized with a disclaimer by Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
Citizen Kane, 1941. Orson Welles' thinly veiled biography of publishing magnate

about a Dust Bowl family's migration west during the Great Depression.

epics -- used four related stories to reveal man's inhumanity to man.

own coming of age and coming to grips with racism as a black growing up in
Kansas.
</P>

Hammett's novel about San Francisco detective Sam Spade, launched a decade of
film noir and made Humphrey Bogart a star.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, 1939. Frank Capra's other great movie (his "It's
a Wonderful Life" did not make the list) starred James Stewart as an idealist
who takes on corruption in the nation's capital.

<P>
Modern Times, 1936. Charlie Chaplin's classic satire of the Machine Age was
his, and Hollywood's, last great silent film.
</P>
<P>

Eskimo life.
</P>
<P>
On the Waterfront, 1954. Director Elia Kazan and writer Budd Schulberg's expose
of stevedore racketeers, with Marlon Brando as the pug who turns against the
mob.
</P>
<P>
The Searchers, 1956. A relentless John Wayne seeks his kidnaped niece (Natalie
Wood), taken by Indians, in what is regarded by critics as the best of John
Ford's Westerns.

Stanley Donen's musical parody of the movies' transition from silents to sound.

and the only animated film to make the list.
</P>
<P>
Some Like It Hot, 1959. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are Chicago musicians on
the lam and in drag who join Marilyn Monroe in an all-girl band in
writer-director Billy Wilder and co-screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond's
black-and-white comedy.
</P>
<P>
Star Wars, 1977. George Lucas transformed a movie genre -- and the film
industry as well -- with this sequel-spawning Space Age Western starring
Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, the voice of James Earl Jones and
two lovable robots.
</P>
<P>
Sunrise, 1927. Janet Gaynor stars as a young wife whose life is threatened by
her husband in F. W. Murnau's silent film.
</P>
<P>

is corrupted by an aging, lovelorn star (Gloria Swanson).
</P>
<P>

retired cop (James Stewart) with a fear of heights.
</P>
<P>

Man, and a horse of a different color. The perennial family classic.

<LEADPARA>  ALL-PURPOSE scenario No. 7: Nice guy runs afoul of the Mob and must don
ridiculous disguise to give Mr. Big's thugs the slip. Everyone from Damon
Runyon to Billy Wilder (in "Some Like It Hot") has used this set-up to mine
belly laughs. And it remains a serviceable plot device -- provided you have a
decent farceur and a director who understands the mechanics of classic
slapstick.;    In director Charles Lane (the Chaplinesque "Sidewalk Stories")
and British TV star Lenny Henry, Disney has two of the most energetic and
resourceful comedy talents around. These guys have taken a plot that fairly
creaks from overuse and turned it into a sparkling comedy of errors called
"True Identity" (opening today). It's not a great movie on the order of, say,
"Tootsie," but it is lively and entertaining and scores as a refreshing
reversal on the well-meant but bogus "Black Like Me" and "Soul Man."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Better yet, it introduces us to impressionist Henry, whose devilish charm
brings to mind Harpo Marx and Richard Pryor. Henry's underworld nemesis is
played to the hilt by Frank Langella, a past master at slick villainy.;
Langella's Frank Luchino fakes his own assassination and re-emerges, with the
help of plastic surgery, as celebrated New York arts benefactor Leland Carver.
On a plane that appears fated to fall from the sky, Luchino/Carver makes a
clean breast of it to the young man in the next seat, a struggling black actor
named Miles Pope (Henry).;    Guess what? The plane doesn't crash, and a
red-faced Luchino has blown his elaborate cover. What to do? Rub out the
nobody actor, of course.;    Thank goodness Miles' best friend, Duane (Lane),
is a makeup-effects whiz. Duane not only rearranges Miles' features
(highercheekbones, less pronounced lips and nose), he changes his pigment.
Enter the new Miles, a refugee from Bensonhurst who now finds he can hail the
same midtown cab that speeds by other blacks.;    Ah, you nod -- a hip new
variation on "The Prince and the Pauper." Not quite. Though Miles eventually
finds himself ensconced in a ritzy hotel suite, he's not happy with the
surface perks his latex paint job brings.;    Shock! Surprise! We haven't
landed in another Gene Wilder-Richard Pryor "I be baaaad" comedy caper that
reinforces white myths about black inferiority.;    "I wanted to look like
Prince," Miles protests from the makeup chair. "You made me look like Wayne
Newton.";    After more twists -- and a brilliant spoof of Hitchcock's lineup
in "The Wrong Man" -- Miles is taken for his own hit man, an Italian-American
"whack" specialist imported from the West Coast.;    Now the question becomes:
Will Miles, with the help of Duane and a newfound ally (Anne-Marie Johnson),
be able to expose Luchino to the skeptical feds before Luchino and his inept
bodyguard (Andreas Katsulas) expose, and then eradicate, Miles?;    And so the
scene is set for a succession of mix-ups, masquerades and a theater climax
modeled after Hitchcock's Albert Hall sequence in "The Man Who Knew Too Much."
At various junctures, Miles appears as James Brown's younger brother Darryl, a
real estate agent, Othello and (if possible) a caricature of a Scorsese wise
guy.;    For his part, Langella fumes and swears a lot. In other hands,
Luchino would have been a stock mobster. Langella makes the guy seem both
peevish and dangerous. We share his frustration as things escalate and delight
in his inevitable unmasking.;    As he has demonstrated with his university
shorts and the silent feature "Sidewalk Stories," Lane is that rarity among
film makers: an amiable satirist who empathizes with all his characters. Lane
is closer in temperament to Scotland's Bill Forsyth than fellow New Yorker
Spike Lee, whose strength remains his anger. Lee's New York is colorful and
ominous; Lane's is buoyant and nurturing, a place where Audrey Hepburn could
feel perfectly at home.;    Lane spikes his first studio venture with a number
of "in" jokes and surprises -- Luchino whistles "Zip a Dee Doo Dah" from
Disney's "Song of the South"; Anthony's henchman warms up to the white Miles
and reacts to the truth like a spurned lover; James Earl Jones does a
flamboyant walk-on as theater legend James Earl Jones; veteran film maker
Melvin van Peebles appears as a cabby who lectures Miles on black power as his
fare slowly disappears under white makeup.;    Van Peebles' presence is
especially apt. In 1970, he directed "Watermelon Man," the model for this
venture. The late Godfrey Cambridge played a bigoted white businessman who
eventually learns what Miles always knows and white studio bosses will never
suspect: Black is not only beautiful but preferred.;  True Identity;

. . . Will Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder do it again? We're told that there are
discussions at Tri-Star about a fourth Pryor-Wilder comedy teaming, titled
"Another You," and that Peter Bogdanovich is a possibility to direct. The
actors teamed for last year's "See No Evil, Hear No Evil," as well as "Stir
Crazy" (1980) and "Silver Streak" (1976).

. . . Ever wonder who would win a battle between the monster from "Alien" and

with the skulls of his human and inhuman victims, including one that's
unmistakably that of the Alien.

   Hulk Hogan may be unbeatable in the wrestling
ring, but he's clearly no match for Indiana Jones.
   Hogan's new movie ``No Holds Barred'' was body slammed by
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' which continued to break
box-office records by collecting another $21.2 million at the
nation's theaters over the weekend.
   According to figures released Monday by Exhibitor Relations Co.,
``No Holds Barred'' gathered $5 million in its first weekend of
release.
   ``The Last Crusade,'' which set four major box-office marks in
its first week of release, broke two more records in its second
week and took in as much as the next six most popular movies
combined.
   The film, in which Harrison Ford as the dauntless archaeologist
joins his father (Sean Connery) to save the Holy Grail from the
Nazis, set new records for the best 12 days and best second weekend
in movie history. It could pass the $100 million mark next weekend
and shatter yet another record.
   ``No Holds Barred,'' a new action-adventure film featuring
wrestler Hogan, debuted in second place. ``See No Evil, Hear No
Evil,'' a crime comedy with Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor, landed
in third on ticket sales of $4.1 million.
   In fourth was the Kevin Costner baseball movie ``Field of
Dreams'' on gross of $3.7 million. It was followed by
``Renegades,'' starring Kiefer Sutherland and Lou Diamond Phillips,
opening in fifth with $3.1 million. ``Road House,'' featuring
Patrick Swayze as a bar bouncer, placed sixth with $3 million.
   Continuing its sluggish pace, Clint Eastwood's ``Pink Cadillac''
collected only $2.5 million to land in seventh place. ``K-9,''
starring Jim Belushi and a dog as a police team, finished in eighth
with $1.8 million.
   Rounding out the Top 10 were ``Pet Sematary,'' in ninth on gross
of $1.7 million, and ``Major League,'' in 10th with $963,636.
``Rain Man,'' a Top 10 movie for all of 1989, finally fell off the
leader board.
   Robin Williams' ``Dead Poets Society,'' playing on only eight
screens, collected a lively $340,456. Its per screen average _
$42,557 _ was the third best in the history of limited releases, in
which a movie opens in just a handful of theaters.
   The only films to surpass ``Dead Poets Society'' in a limited
release opening were ``Good Morning, Vietnam'' and ``The Last
Temptation of Christ.''
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.
   1. ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' Paramount, $21.2
million, 2,327 screens, $9,123 per screen, $77.1 million, two weeks.
   2. ``No Holds Barred,'' New Line, $5 million, 1,318 screens,
$3,761 per screen, $5 million, one week.
   3. ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' Tri-Star, $4.1 million, 1,680
screens, $2,415 per screen, $28.9 million, four weeks.
   4. ``Field of Dreams,'' Universal, $3.7 million, 1,100 screens,
$3,400 per screen, $35.6 million, seven weeks.
   5. ``Renegades,'' Universal, $3.1 million, 1,627 screens, $1,890
per screen, $3.1 million, one week.
   6. ``Road House,'' MGM-UA, $3 million, 1,880 screens, $1,599 per
screen, $17.5 million, three weeks.
   7. ``Pink Cadillac,'' Warner Bros., $2.5 million, 1,993 screens,
$1,250 per screen, $7.8 million, two weeks.
   8. ``K-9,'' Universal, $1.8 million, 1,307 screens, $1,410 per
screen, $33 million, six weeks.
   9. ``Pet Sematary,'' Paramount, $1.7 million, 1,248 screens,
$1,370 per screen, $48.4 million, seven weeks.
   10. ``Major League,'' Paramount, $963,636 million, 960 screens,
$1,003 per screen, $45 million, nine weeks.

<LEADPARA>  'YOU can never plan the future by the past," said Edmund Burke, the

WHAT WILL WE BE RENTING IN '92?
THE GREATEST MOVIE HITS OF 1991  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  FRONT LINES; D. Scott Apel is a San Jose free-lance writer.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Because the past of theatrical films is the future of video, it's even
possible to plan our prospective video rentals with some precision. While we
can't even hope to mention the hundreds of minor titles and made-for-video
tapes that will be released during the next few months, we can cover the Top
10-type titles most of us will compete to rent.;   And so, armed with nothing
more than a crystal ball (and a handful of press releases), we offer, in the
traditional Gypsy fashion, some fantastically accurate predictions about what
you'll be watching on video in the months to come.;   The crystal ball is
clearing . . . January is coming into focus . . .;   JANUARY;   "You will take
a long journey . . . ";   This is certainly true if your names are "Thelma &amp;
Louise," which will be the first major movie to hit video stores in 1992. On
Jan. 8, the two "women with weapons" begin their thought-provoking and
controversial journey to independence in this superbly written, acted and
photographed film. The following day (Jan. 9), Julia Roberts helps Campbell
Scott begin the Ultimate Journey in the romantic tragedy "Dying Young." And on
the 30th, a family of nine attempts an illegal voyage from Turkey to
Switzerland in "Journey of Hope," the 1991 Oscar winner for best
foreign-language film.;   "You will meet a tall, dark stranger . . . ";   But,
dude, it's Death himself! At least that's the sinister scene-stealer who
escorts Bill and Ted to heaven and hell in "Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey," due
on video Jan. 9. And a stranger of another kind (Wesley Snipes) awaits
Annabella Sciorra in Spike Lee's "Jungle Fever," an exploration of interracial
relationships due on video the 16th.;   "You will soon have a change in
fortune . . . ";   A true enough prediction for the incorrigible con men in
"Another You," due Jan. 8; unfortunately, this weak comedy did nothing to
change the faded cinematic fortunes of either Richard Pryor or Gene Wilder.
Ditto for Mel Brooks, playing a millionaire who loses everything in "Life
Stinks," a failed comedy about homelessness due the 29th. But the film
fortunes of teen idols Christian Slater, Richard Grieco and Patrick Dempsey
are sure to rise when their crime drama "Mobsters" hits stores on the 30th.;
"You are about to embark on an exciting adventure . . . ";   Reckless
adrenaline junkie Patrick Swayze helps undercover FBI agent Keanu Reeves
fulfill this prophecy in the action-oriented "Point Break," due Jan. 16. And
the flip-side of this dead-serious film is the no-jokes-barred slapstick
action of "Hot Shots!," a "Top Gun" parody from one of the writers of
"Airplane!," due the 30th.;   "I see the letter 'W' . . . ";   You'll also see
the letters "R" and "NC-17" connected with director Ken Russell's latest film,
"Whore," a gritty, realistic look at the oldest profession, starring Theresa
Russell and due Jan. 22. But there is a "G"-rated "W" on its way as well:
"Wild Hearts Can't Be Broken," a Disney film based on the life of a woman who
rode high-diving horses in the 1920s.;   FEBRUARY;   "An unexpected event will
change your life . . . ";   The accidental discovery of Howard Hughes'
prototype jet backpack surely changes the life of a barnstorming pilot in
Disney's high-flying period adventure "Rocketeer," due on video Feb. 5. On the
more earthbound side, Harrison Ford plays an arrogant lawyer who must re-learn
life from the beginning after he's shot during a robbery in the Mike Nichols
drama "Regarding Henry," due the 6th. And Barbara Hershey finds herself
"Defenseless" on the 26th as a lawyer in trouble, in this thriller which
co-stars Sam Shepard.;   "You will find romance -- but it is fraught with
danger . . . ";   The danger in the romantic comedy "Mystery Date," due Feb.
27, lies in the sinister figures following a nervous nerd on a date with a
beauty queen; they mistake him for his criminal older brother, and their
misdirected evil intentions cause comic complications. In a similar vein,
Martin Short is a human self-destructoid in the comedy "Pure Luck," due the
13th, an accident-prone idiot teamed up with detective Danny Glover to search
for an industrialist's missing daughter. And danger of a different brand --
the possibility of rescue and return to civilization -- plagues the innocent
teens who "Return to the Blue Lagoon" on the 5th.;   "A man of great physical
strength will take up your cause . . . ";   Jean-Claude Van Damme is up to
this challenge twice over, playing identical feet-and-fist-flailing twins out
to avenge their parents' murders in the action flick "Double Impact," due Feb.
12. And speaking of dynamic action duos, how about Mickey Rourke and Don
Johnson as outlaw bikers fighting corruption in the futuristic flick "Harley
Davidson and the Marlboro Man," due the 19th? On the comic side, Hulk Hogan
stars (with Christopher Lloyd) as a good-natured brute from outer space who
adopts a typical American family in "Suburban Commando," due Feb. 26.;   "I
sense a death in the family . . . ";   But Christina Applegate will make the
best of it -- and even learn some bittersweet lessons about life -- in the
teen comedy "Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead," due Feb. 19. On the
sinister side, there's "Body Parts," due the 20th, in which a criminal's arm,
grafted onto an upstanding citizen, continues to commit heinous crimes.;
SPRING '92;   "The images are getting hazy . . . ";   Confirmed release dates
are getting hazy, anyway. But by using the loose rule that about six months
elapses between a film's theatrical premiere and its video release, we can
predict when titles should be arriving in video stores.;   March, for
instance, ought to see the release of such dramatic entries as "Boyz N the
Hood," the critically acclaimed film about gang members, and "The Doctor," in
which arrogant surgeon William Hurt gets a taste of his own medicine when he
becomes an unwilling patient. We also should see the psychological thrillers
"Dead Again," Kenneth Branagh's Hitchcock homage; Goldie Hawn's "Deceived";
and "Shattered" with Tom Berenger and Greta Scacchi.;   And look forward to
comedies wild (the football flick "Necessary Roughness"), mild (the romantic
fantasy "Late for Dinner") and totally bizarre (the Coen brothers'
Hollywood-is-Hell allegory "Barton Fink," due March 5). Also on tap for March:
"Rambling Rose," a coming-of-age story with Laura Dern and Robert Duvall, and
"Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare.";   April "oughta-bes" include an excess
of execrable comedies, including John Hughes' insipid "Curly Sue";
Oscar-winning actor Joe Pesci's superfluous and superficial "The Super"; the
aptly-titled "Ernest Scared Stupid"; "Other People's Money," Danny DeVito's
disappointing comedy-drama; and -- just in time for Easter -- the coal-lump
"All I Want for Christmas." Genre titles should include Wes Craven's
tongue-in-cheek horror flick "The People Under the Stairs," and Sean Connery,
who should know better, in the sci-fi sequel "Highlander 2: The Quickening.";
 Any one of these could appear much sooner, however, following the corollary
to the "six-month" rule; namely, the worse the movie, the quicker it hits
video.;   The good news for "April maybes" is the potential video release of a
number of flawed but entertaining films, including director Terry Gilliam's
allegory "The Fisher King," with Robin Williams, Jeff Bridges and Mercedes
Ruehl; Denzel Washington and John Lithgow in the suspense thriller "Ricochet";
Don Johnson and real-life wife Melanie Griffith as a couple who learn to
communicate in the tender "Paradise"; and "House Party 2," an energetic
musical comedy.;   May might well bring us Michelle Pfeiffer and Al Pacino in
the romantic "Frankie and Johnny"; "Little Man Tate," Jodie Foster's
directorial debut; Dustin Hoffman in the gangster epic "Billy Bathgate"; and
Demi Moore in the romantic fantasy "The Butcher's Wife.";   SURPRISES;   One
more thing we can definitely predict: the release dates of small, exceptional
films are definitely unpredictable. About the best we can do is offer a
reminder to keep an eye out for such worthwhile little films as "21," in which
Patsy Kensit tells us stories of sex and seduction; "Slacker," a uniquely
structured visit with a number of engaging loonies; "Truly, Madly, Deeply," a
more adult and emotionally satisfying version of "Ghost"; Lily Tomlin's
one-woman show, "The Search for Signs of Intelligent Life in the Universe;"
the magical, musical Irish import "The Commitments"; and two art films from
director Peter Greenaway: "Drowning by the Numbers," a bizarre and comic look
at death, and "Prospero's Books," a visually stunning adaptation of
Shakespeare's "The Tempest.";   . . . AND BEYOND;   Beyond this, the crystal
ball gets cloudy. But -- lucky seers, we -- the video releases we can expect
in the summer months of 1992 just about parallel what's currently playing in
theaters. In order to divine what we'll be watching at home six months from
now, we really don't need a crystal ball at all. All we need are the movie
listings in eye-- and an eye to the future.  </TEXT>

   In her final interview before she died of
cancer, comedian Gilda Radner praised her husband, Gene Wilder, as
a man who cared about ``who I am, rather than if I have hair.''
   Wilder ``always treated me normally. If he was mad at me, he was
mad at me. I don't think I could have stood it if anybody had
treated me as fragile or as though I had a limited time on earth,''
Radner said.
   The interview, published in the June issue of Glamour magazine,
was conducted March 31. Rachel McAllister, Radner's publicist,
confirmed that it was the comedian's last interview.
   Radner, a star in the early ``Saturday Night Live'' comedy show,
died Saturday of ovarian cancer at age 42; a book about her
illness, ``It's Always Something,'' will soon be published.
   She said she told Wilder, ``You have handled this about the best
that anyone could. After I finish this every woman in the world
will be after you. The trouble is, they're all gonna have some
major illness.''
   She said Wilder always made her feel loved.
   ``I'm lucky I'm with a man who isn't superficial,'' she said.
``I think he was really put to the test. But he loves and cares
about what's inside me _ who I am, rather than if I have hair.
   ``He's never broken down and cried,'' she said. ``He's always
had this total confidence that I would be well. I've never seen any
fear in his eyes. And I would be the first one to pick up on it.
Now he says back in the early days that he did feel fear. You know
what? He may just be a great actor!''

<DESCRIPT>  RAILROAD; MOVIE; REVIEW; BRIEF  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Ever since the Wright brothers first launched their unpatented flying machine
from the dunes of Kitty Hawk in 1902, public interest in train travel and
trains seems to have declined considerably.;    And yet, even as an antiquated
method of moving people from one location to another since it burst upon the
travel scene with a piercing steam whistle as early as 1712, the train is
still with us.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Peninsula Extra  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  TAKE FANTASY TRIP RIDING KINKY RAILS OF CELLULOID
EXPRESS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Sure, a plane, car or bus might get you to your destination much quicker
than that old train, but with much less excitement, mystique and without a
certain amount of savoir faire.;    Our fascination with trains (and
subsequently with films in which trains play a major role) has not diminished
through the latter part of the 20th century. So grab your grip, watch out for
that blast of hot steam and mind your step as you climb aboard the Celluloid
Express.;    (check) Once Upon A Time In The West (1969) -- This sprawling
western, often and unfairly confused with Sergio Leone's other cinematic epic
"Once Upon A Time In America," effectively uses the train and the construction
of the transcontinental railroad as a Wild West symbol.;    The train and its
expansion across the United States portray the greed, lust, hate, love, death
and the fulfillment of dreams.;    The film's plot focuses on widow Claudia
Cardinale who is being harassed by railroad thugs into selling her late
husband's land to make way for the new rail line.;    Riddled with symbolism,
dubbed voice-overs and Ennio Morricone's thematic music, the 165-minute movie
has gathered quite a cult following over the years.;    The stellar cast
includes Charles Bronson, Jason Robards and Henry Fonda (in a marvelous
performance as one of the meanest, tobacco-spitting villains to ever grace the
cross hairs of a spaghetti western).;    (check) Runaway Train (1985) --
Although wildly uneven, this surreal cinematic train ride serves as a great
star vehicle for Jon Voight, who pulls out all the stops as a fearless escaped
convict who has the misfortune to hitch a ride on a careening, out-of-control
train.;    Many critics will point to the film as a metaphor for society's
runaway technology. Skeptics and nitpickers will point out ways Voight,
co-convict Eric Roberts and stowaway Rebecca DeMornay might have stopped the
train.;    But who cares? Train lovers, action buffs and cynics should just
sit back and enjoy the breakneck ride.;    (check) The Narrow Margin (1952) --
Forget the anemic 1990 remake of this fine, B-movie directed by the vastly
underrated Richard Fleischer.;    Tough-as-nails actor Charles McGraw stars as
the cynical detective who has the unenviable task of protecting a seemingly
ungrateful female witness on a lengthy train ride.;    Director Fleischer
makes the most of the claustrophobic interior of the train to heighten
suspenseful moments and create its own little world of film noir.;    Although
the stark action sequences are kept to a minimum, the performances are as
gritty as the stones between railroad ties and the dialogue is as sharp as a
train's whistle.;    (check)  Strangers On A Train (1951) -- Robert Walker is
a chillingly convincing psychopath in Alfred Hitchcock's classic film about
two strangers who meet quite by accident aboard a passenger train, at which
time Walker suggests they switch murders to eliminate a motive ("crisscross,
crisscross!").;    But the train in this thriller also plays an important
role. Its bass drum whistle can be heard in the background every time Walker
menaces victim Farley Granger aboard the train.;    With Hitchcock's usual
aplomb, the plot has more switchovers than the 5:15 commuter train as it comes
into Grand Central Station.;    (check)  From Russia With Love (1963) --
Although only half an hour of this two-hour James Bond film takes place on a
train, it is one of the most unforgettable and suspenseful 30 minutes of
cinema.;    Don't pay too much attention to the silly plot about British and
Russian agents trying to get their hands on a top-secret decoding machine. The
film's highlight is the incredibly brutal fight scene between good guy Bond
(Sean Connery) and villain Grant (Robert Shaw) on a train traveling between
Istanbul and the Yugoslavian border.;    (check)  The Great Train Robbery
(1979) -- Speaking of Sean Connery, he returns in Michael Crichton's terribly
polite film about the planning and execution of the theft of a gold shipment
from a moving train in 1855.;    For the most part, Crichton succeeds in
capturing the flavor of the period, aided and abetted by lavish sets and a
whimsical score.;    Joining Connery in his good-natured heist are Donald
Sutherland and Lesley-Anne Down, turning in fine performances. Director and
writer Crichton adds a nice twist at the end.;    (check)  Silver Streak
(1976) -- Much to the credit of writer Colin Higgins and director Arthur
Hiller, the story of a mild-mannered train passenger (Gene Wilder) never quite
sinks to the level of mindless violence that could have ensued.;    Indeed,
Wilder is fairly reserved as a book editor who unwittingly witnesses the
tossing of a corpse off the roof of the Silver Streak. The seductive Jill
Clayburgh is along for the ride and good-natured thief Richard Pryor turns up
to lend some timely comedy relief.  </TEXT>

   Still glowing from a hot though non-record
summer, the movie business enters the fall season with something a
little different from the high-budget, body-count films that
dominated the past three months.
   The warm-weather box office produced some big numbers, with
``Die Hard 2,'' ``Total Recall,'' ``Dick Tracy'' and ``Ghost''
passing the $100 million mark. Daily Variety's Art Murphy
calculates the 1990 summer is only 6 percent short of last year's
sizzler, which amassed a record $719 million.
   The surprises this year were a pair of romantic fantasies,
``Pretty Woman'' ($170 million) and ``Ghost'' (climbing to $100
million in only five weeks). Hollywood is hoping for more offbeat
hits in the fall product, which leans heavily on comedy and drama
and less on violence.
   There are a few promising films among the fall harvest:
   _ ``Postcards From the Edge,'' Meryl Streep and Shirley MacLaine
as mother and daughter in Carrie Fisher's novel, directed by Mike
Nichols.
   _ ``Awakenings,'' Penny Marshall (``Big'') directing Robert De
Niro and Robin Williams as amnesia victim and doctor.
   _ ``Goodfellas,'' a Mafia yarn based on the book ``Wise Guy,''
Robert De Niro and Ray Liota directed by Martin Scorsese.
   _ ``White Hunter, Black Heart,'' Clint Eastwood directs himself
in a script based on John Huston's adventures during the filming of
``The African Queen.''
   _ ``Pacific Heights,'' a thriller with Michael Keaton as a
presumably friendly neighbor to a couple, Melanie Griffith and
Matthew Modine.
   _ ``The Rescuers Down Under,'' a new Disney animated feature and
the first sequel; Bob Newhart and Eva Gabor repeat their voicing of
special mouse agents Bernard and Miss Bianca.
   _ ``Dances With Wolves,'' Kevin Costner starring and directing
an epic of Western America.
   _ ``Rocky V: The Final Bell,'' with Rocky Balboa managing
another fighter this time.
   If the fall season seems a bit serious, that's because the
studios trot out the dramas that might get lost in the summer and,
not coincidentally, that might contain potentials for Academy
Awards.
   Some of the more prestigious offerings include:
   _ ``Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,'' an interpretation of the great
director's dreams with a mostly Japanese cast and Scorsese as
Vincent van Gogh.
   _ ``Desperate Hours,'' a remake of the Humphrey Bogart-Fredric
March thriller with Mickey Rourke and Anthony Hopkins directed by
Michael Cimino (``The Deer Hunter,'' ``Heaven's Gate'').
   _ ``Reversal of Fortune,'' the Claus von Bulow story starring
Glenn Close, Jeremy Irons and Ron Silver.
   _ ``Avalon,'' Barry Levinson (``Rain Man'') continues his
trilogy of Baltimore life that includes ``Diner'' and ``Tin Men.''
   _ ``Texasville,'' Peter Bogdanovich's return to ``The Last
Picture Show'' with most of the original cast.
   _ ``White Palace,'' Susan Sarandon and James Spader involved in
a mismatched sexual adventure.
   _ ``State of Grace,'' Sean Penn returns to his childhood haunts
in New York's Hell's Kitchen.
   _ ``Miller's Crossing,'' the offbeat Coen brothers (``Raising
Arizona'') return with a mob-oriented drama starring Gabriel Byrne
and Albert Finney.
   Comedies will also play a major role in the fall season.
   ``Alice'' is Woody Allen's return to comedy, with a cast
including Mia Farrow, William Hurt, Cybill Shepherd and Alec
Baldwin.
   ``Sibling Rivalry'' stars Kirstie Alley, Bill Pullman and Carrie
Fisher in a family comedy directed by Carl Reiner.
   Leonard Nimoy directs Gene Wilder and Christine Lahti in an
ironic love story in ``Funny About Love.''
   Action-adventure isn't being neglected, though the offerings
lack the $50 million-plus budgets and high-tech gimmickry of summer
films.
   A sampling:
   _ ``Marked for Death,'' Steven Seagal fights the drug lords.
   _ ``Quigley Down Under,'' Tom Selleck in Australia.
   _ ``Memphis Belle,'' Mathew Modine and John Lithgow in the World
War II air war.
   _ ``Narrow Margin,'' Gene Hackman and Anne Archer fleeing by
train from mob hitmen.
   _ ``Steven King's Graveyard Shift,'' another offering from the
fright king.
   _ ``Misery,'' Rob Reiner directs James Caan in King's story of a
best-selling author captured by a fan.
   _ ``Night of the Living Dead,'' an update of George A. Romero's
1968 ``classic.''
   _ ``Child's Play II,'' the psychopathic killer doll Chucky
returns.
   If none of the above catch fire, theater owners can look forward
to one of the most promising holiday season in years. The potential
gems include ``The Godfather III,'' ``Three Men and a Little
Lady,'' ``Bonfire of the Vanities,'' ``Edward Scissorhands,''
``Come See the Paradise'' and ``Look Who's Talking Too.''
   The standout could well be ``Scenes From a Mall,'' the first
film since 1976's ``The Front'' in which Woody Allen has acted but
not directed. The movie, co-written and directed by Paul Mazursky
(``Enemies: A Love Story''), co-stars Bette Midler.

<HEAD>American Comedian Discharged From Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRISBANE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hospital today discharged actor and
comedian Richard Pryor, who it had treated for a mild heart heart
attack, doctors said.
   They said he would be returning to his home in Los Angeles.
   Pryor, 49, was readmitted to the Wesley Hospital on Monday after
being discharged a day earlier. He suffered a heart attack while on
a fishing vacation in northeastern Australia last week.
   American heart specialist John Perry flew from Los Angeles
earlier this week to treat him. Dr. Perry said he recommended a
discharge after Pryor passed cardiac tests.
   Pryor was first admitted a week ago for tests after experiencing
chest pains while staying at the Sanctuary Cove resort on
Australia's Gold Coast.
   Pryor is best-known for several movies based on his stand-up
comedy performances and the comedies ``Silver Streak,'' ``See No
Evil, Hear No Evil,'' ``Critical Condition'' and ``Harlem Nights.''
   In 1980, he was burned severely and nearly died while
free-basing cocaine, which involves heating the drug over an open
flame.
   He recounted that experience and other hardships in his life in
the films ``Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip'' and ``Jo Jo
Dancer, Your Life is Calling.''
   Pryor is due to start filming ``My Silent Partner'' with Gene
Wilder in May.

was filled with frustration.";    A simple blood test might have detected
Radner's cancer 10 months earlier and possibly saved her life, Wilder said.;
 "I think Gilda would have been most happy to lend her name to this," Wilder
said.  </TEXT>

<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Mel Brooks plays a pompous billionaire in 'Life Stinks'  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  HUMOR; MOVIE; CELEBRITY; INTERVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IN 20 years of movie making, Mel Brooks has given us "Blazing Saddles," "Young
Frankenstein" and the toe-tapping, goose-stepping Nazis of "The Producers.";
 He's also given us "To Be or Not To Be" and "Spaceballs." And lately he's
seen his fertile field of movie parodies taken over by the "Airplane!" and
"Naked Gun" crowd.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DOES LIFE STINK? ARE YOU KIDDING?
THERE'S COMEDY EVERYWHERE, AND MEL BROOKS
PLANS TO FIND IT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  SAY ANYTHING  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But Mel Brooks is back, with a new movie -- "Life Stinks" -- and an old
mission to make people laugh. By any means necessary.; Q Where have you been
for the last four years?; A Yeah, it's been too long between movies. I mean,
we're not talking about building a children's hospital here. This is a movie,
and if you take too much time you're wasting your time. I spent 2 1/2 years on
my little tragic comedy, writing it, working on it. I'm not going to do that
again. Next time I'm going to make two movies in that kind of time.;    Q It
was a risk calling this "Life Stinks," wasn't it?;    A Yes, because then
you're tempting the critics. " 'Life Stinks' and so does this movie, now
playing." But we just got a very good review in New York so I'm walking on air
today. And time is on my side. When "Blazing Saddles" came out, the critics
said it was vulgar, it was disgusting, that bean scene, forget it. Now it's a
classic. I talked to Roger Ebert the other day, he was raving about "The
Twelve Chairs." I said you saw that?; Q In "The Producers" and "To Be or Not
To Be" there are jokes about Nazis. "Life Stinks" is a comedy about the
homeless. Isn't there anything that's off-limits?; A It depends on the
comedian. Homelessness is a terrible, terrible problem. It's a national
disgrace. The water pump on my car broke, which is tragic enough that I have
to get that fixed, but you get off the highway in Southern California and
you're in Calcutta. It's horrible.;    Now the beggars, I love the beggars.
The beggars are with it. They're politically aware, cause they just want your
money. But the drifters are very sad. Talking to themselves.;    The best way
you can bring a social ill, like homelessness, to the screen is make a
rip-roaring crazy comedy about an arrogant billionaire who thinks he can
survive down there. And when he meets the reality we get our laughs. And maybe
some of it reaches our consciousness.;    You know, when we finished the film
we had a special screening for the homeless who helped us make the movie. They
weren't active because of the union, but they helped . . . So 5,100 people got
hot dogs and orange juice and a piece of apple pie and watched "Life Stinks."
And let me tell you, they really did enjoy it. They cheered, they laughed, it
was great.; Q You have a fantasy musical number in "Life Stinks" . . .; A
Yeah, there are two salutes in it. My homages des films, which I can't do
without. One is to those great MGM musicals. And the other is to Godzilla and
Rodan.; Q Is there some part of you deep inside who really wishes he were Gene
Kelly?; A Every little Jewish boy that ever grew up in Williamsburg, Brooklyn,
dreamt that he could grow up to be Gene Kelly. And I loved the scene. It was
easy because Lesley Ann Warren is beautiful, she's a beautiful person, she
moves beautifully, she has a beautiful long waist and great long legs and she
knows how to use them. . . . It's a great number. It blows the dust off your
soul. You just forget about everything for three minutes and get lost in the
greatest song ever written by Cole Porter, "You'd Be So Easy To Love.". . .;
 That jump in the dance? Gene Kelly taught me how to do that. I met him at
O'Hare Airport in Chicago years ago and I said, "How do you do that jump?" And
he took a half hour out of his life to teach me how to do it. And I learned
it! He was amazed at how good I was.;    Q What makes you laugh?; A I find
comedy in life. But I can go to an old Marx Brothers movie and they have to
carry me out on a stretcher. Some people think comedy is surprise, and it can
be, but I love it when someone brilliantly plans it.; Q Who do you think is
funny?; A Rick Moranis. Physically, I love John Candy. He's in the great
tradition of Gleason, Oliver Hardy -- a great physical comedian. When talented
people are on their game, like Whoopi Goldberg, it's great stuff, it's
thrilling. You can really sit back, relax and watch them go.;    Sometimes I'm
good. I was on a salute to Carl Reiner, a comedy awards show, and I let my
anger take over and I was outrageously funny. I screamed to the producers on
the air, "You don't want to give this award to Carl Reiner. He doesn't deserve
it. You're giving it to him because he has friends like Mel Brooks and Steve
Martin. You want us here. You want celebrities." And people went crazy. . . .
And to top it all I said, "I'm sick of being this 2,000-year-old man. I'm fed
up with it. He's made me this Jew that I'm not." And I pulled off this fake
nose and I said "See, this isn't my nose. My name is Jim Richardson and ah'm
from Waco, Texas. And goddamn it's good to talk like a Texan once again and
not that little Jewboy.";    The place was hysterical. You have to seize the
moment and tell the truth. Because the truth was Carl was using me, and he
knew it. But instead of getting mad at him I used my rage. Did you see me the
other night on the Carson show?;    Q No. Sorry.; A Oh God. All right. Well I
don't want to brag, but ask anybody who saw it. Say, "Was Mel Brooks any funny
or is he just tooting his own horn?" It was a great night. When Carson can't
talk and he's spitting and his eyes are red with tears, that's when you've got
him. It's a great feeling. I think it has to do with power, making an audience
laugh. I mean, for a little funny-looking guy it's the only power you're going
to get.; Q How old is the 2,000-year-old man now?; A He's about 2,021. And he
spends most of his days in a hammock listening to the early "2,000" records
and saying, "That guy's good. That little Jew, he's cute." We may do another
record so we can issue a collection in CD.; Q How do you get along with your
star, Mel Brooks? He seems like a very difficult actor to work with.; A I
don't get along with him. We have big fights. I'm very patient as a director.
But he's an arrogant, egotistical maniac. And thank God I was the producer.
Because as the producer I sent the star flowers, and that softened him up.; Q
What's a great joke you've just heard?; A This man's in his late 70s and his
wife dies. All the relatives are coming to sit at the wake. And one cousin,
Cousin Murray, who was stuck in Seattle, finally makes it to New York. But
it's a day late and the sitting is over. So he gets there and he's looking for
his cousin, and he can't find him, and finally he goes into the bedroom and
there he is, in bed, with the beautiful Puerto Rican maid. And they're at it,
you know. And Murray says, "What are you doing? Your wife just died! What are
you doing?!" And the man says, "In my grief, do I know what I'm doing?"; Q
Does life stink?; A Life is wonderful. I didn't want to steal Frank Capra's
title "It's a Wonderful Life" so I took the other side of the coin: "Life
Stinks." But it really doesn't.  </TEXT>

<P>
With Witness (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) Australian director Peter Weir made an
exceptionally potent American debut in this intelligent 1985 romantic thriller,
which found Harrison Ford's Philadelphia cop taking refuge in an Amish
community, where he and a beautiful young Amish woman (Kelly McGillis) find
themselves mutually attracted.
</P>
<P>
The Trial of the Incredible Hulk (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) brings back Bill Bixby
and Lou Ferrigno in a new TV movie reprise of their series. This time out
Bixby's research scientist, Dr. David Banner, is thrown in jail for a crime he
didn't commit.
</P>
<P>
Top Gun (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) is that wildly popular 1986 picture, a male
bonding adventure that's both mind-boggling and vacuous. Allegedly based on the
Navy's crack fighter pilot program at San Diego's Miramar Naval Base, it sucks
us into a high-tech world of multimillion-dollar aircraft and hell-for-leather
fliers. Tom Cruise is Maverick, an egotistical hotshot pilot; others involved
are Kelly McGillis, Val Kilmer and Anthony Edwards.
</P>
<P>
In the dreadful 1981 comedy, Modern Problems (Channel 5 Tuesday at 8 p.m.),
that air traffic controller Chevy Chase develops telekinetic powers through
contact with nuclear waste is so grim as to be awe-inspiring in its sheer
inappropriateness as a source of humor.
</P>
<P>
The 1982 Fast Times at Ridgemont High (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) seems an
ambitious movie struggling against the formula dictum that teen-agers must
never have anything on their minds but sex. Even so there are many believable
young people in the film, and they are played by then-such terrific newcomers
as Jennifer Jason Leigh, Sean Penn and Judge Reinhold.
</P>
<P>
The new TV movie Murder by Moonlight (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a futuristic
outer space thriller, stars Brigitte Nielsen, Julian Sands and Gerald McRaney.
</P>
<P>
In The Money Pit (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), New Yorkers Tom Hanks and
Shelley Long succumb to the temptation of grabbing a million-dollar Long Island
fixer-upper for a mere $200,000. The stars of this 1986 comedy shine, but it
might have been funnier had the catastrophes of remodeling not been laid on
quite so thickly.
</P>
<P>
Blame It on Rio (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is a misfired 1984 remake of
the French film "One Wild Moment" in which Michael Caine, who for once cannot
transcend his material, plays a middle-aged vacationer who winds up in an
affair with the teen-age daughter (Michelle Johnson) of his best friend (Joseph
Bologna).
</P>
<P>
Three Amigos (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), a very broad spoof of silent
movie making, requires a total ignorance of the era for the humor of this 1986
film to have a hope of seeming funny. The trio of inept 1916 stars -- Steve
Martin, Chevy Chase and Martin Short -- not surprisingly turn real-life heroes.
</P>
<P>
That multi-Oscar winner One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest returns on Channel 5
Thursday at 8 p.m., and The Heavenly Kid (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a
highly derivative and unfunny 1985 teen fantasy comedy that is entirely
skippable.
</P>
<P>
Amityville: The Evil Escapes (NBC Friday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie starring
Patty Duke as a mother confronted with a mysterious evil force threatening to
destroy her family.
</P>
<P>
Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart (Channel 28 Friday at 11:30 p.m.) evokes with
tenderness and humor the plight of a young Chinese-American woman (Laureen
Chew) trying to leave her mother (Kim Chew) in order to make a life of her own.
An endearing gem of a film.
</P>
<P>
Saturday evening offers a lineup of familiar fare: 9 to 5 (Channel 5 at 6
p.m.), On Golden Pond (Channel 5 at 8 p.m.), A Fistful of Dollars (Channel 13
at 10 p.m.) and Hitchcock's Sabotage (Channel 28 at 10 p.m.).

collaborate again.  </CAPTION>
<LEADPARA>  'IT'S a strange irony to be making a comedy and listening to the war between
shots," says Gene Wilder, on L.A. street location with "Another You.";    He
and Richard Pryor have been making the Tri-Star picture since Sept. 4, and
Wilder also considers it an irony that the project's turning out so well after
such a bad start.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  PRYOR AND WILDER HAVE THE LAST LAUGH  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The Grapevine  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "Another You" is the feature on which Peter Bogdanovich was replaced as
director by Maurice Phillips after weeks of shooting. And to Wilder, the turn
of events "was like kismet -- going through such an evolution to become one of
the best things I've ever done.";    Principal production is scheduled to be
completed Jan. 29 -- after a grueling shoot that necessitated redoing four
weeks of work that had been done under the direction of Bogdanovich.;    At
this point, says Wilder, both he and Pryor are "ready to collapse." They're
talking about re-teaming -- but not for a while.;    The only definite thing
on Wilder's agenda is "to get back to my home in Connecticut and return to my
watercolor painting.";     HISTORICALLY SPEAKING: The cast of ABC's "Young
Riders" will be spending this evening at Tucson's Arizona Theater Company --
presenting "A Tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights
Movement." The program, put together by "Riders" co-star Anthony Zerbe and
theater company director Gary Gisselman, will have Don Franklin reading
excerpts from King's oratory, Stephen Baldwin reading Patrick Henry, Josh
Brolin reading Henry David Thoreau, Gregg Rainwater reading Chief Seattle --
and more. The idea, says Zerbe, is to present King in the context of "great
thinkers and speakers of history.";    Zerbe reports he and his series cohorts
expect to rush from outdoor location shooting to the theater with just a bare
hour to prepare for their 8 p.m. curtain. The idea of the tribute came up less
than three weeks ago (in the midst of much controversy over Arizona's refusal
to join the states that have made Martin Luther King's birthday a holiday).
"We knew it would be a rush, but we decided to go for it," says the actor.
They squeezed rehearsals into their off-hours.;    Zerbe insists, "This is not
a negative gesture. It's not about the state of Arizona. It's a positive
tribute to a great man.";    VIDEOLAND VIEW: Richard Dreyfuss takes on the
role of the anti-Semitic French aristocrat Lt. Col Picquart -- a key figure in
France's Alfred Dreyfus political scandal -- in HBO's "Prisoner of Honor." The
telefilm project, scheduled to go before the cameras Feb. 25, is set to be
directed by Ken Russell.;    WHAT A DIFFERENCE A YEAR MAKES: Eva Marie Saint,
who narrates and hosts the "Primary Colors . . . Story of Corita" documentary
film that's debuting this month on PBS, is saddened over how timely the
program has turned out to be. "Primary Colors" details the story of the late
Corita Kent, the nun who quit her order amid inner-church conflict over
anti-war activism in the 1960s -- and went on to gain recognition as the
pacifist artist responsible for creating such works as the "Love" stamp
design.;    The documentary was a labor of love project for Saint's husband,
Jeffrey Hayden, for more than three years. "When we finished it last year, the
cold war was over and the world situation looked bright," she says. "We'd
watch the film, see the footage of the Vietnam war protests, and think, 'How
could we have lived through all that? Look how far we've come since those
days.' Who would have ever guessed that the same kinds of scenes would be
taking place again by the time the film made it to television?" Who indeed.;
 STAR ATTRACTION: Andy Hirsch, who plays the youngest brother in NBC's "The
Fanelli Boys," says he's finally getting recognition from being on the series
-- sort of. "I recently went in for a checkup with my doctor," recalls Hirsch.
"And the nurse looked down at her chart, then up at me and said 'Do you know
you have the same name as that guy on 'The Fanelli Boys'?" Well, it's a start.  </TEXT>

   Paramount Pictures and the Disney Co. are
running neck and neck as the two giant film companies continue
their battle for box office supremacy.
   For the past two years, Paramount has been the unqualified
leader among major distributors, scoring with such blockbusters as
``Top Gun,'' ``Crocodile Dundee'' and ``Beverly Hills Cop II.''
   Paramount's share of the domestic film market was 20 percent in
1987, according to Daily Variety financial expert Art Murphy.
Runners-up were Buena Vista, the Disney distributing company, with
14 percent, and Warner Bros. with 13.
   In the first two weeks of 1988, Buena Vista took the lead on the
strength of the smash hits ``Three Men and a Baby'' and ``Good
Morning Vietnam'' _ 26 percent to Paramount's 17. It was a happy
triumph for Disney chairman Michael Eisner and Jeff Katzenberg,
Disney's film production chief; both had previously worked for
Paramount.
   But no matter who takes the box-office crown, everybody wins in
1988.
   ``Movie booms last at least 2{ years; the longest has been 3{,''
Murphy said. ``This boom has lasted a year and a half, and I see no
slowdown.''
   The year has opened strongly, with a record take of $100 million
in January. The period from Jan. 1 to Memorial Day is traditionally
the slowest period of the movie year, contributing 20 percent of
annual ticket stales, compared to 40 percent for the three summer
months.
   What wonders will theaters offer in the first five months of
1988? The mixture, as before, has a heavy accent on comedy.
   John Hughes invades the yuppie world with ``She's Having a
Baby,'' starring Kevin Bacon and Elizabeth McGovern. Ann-Margret
falls for her daughter's boyfriend, C. Thomas Howell, in ``A
Tiger's Tale.'' Joe Piscopo and Treat Williams play it for laughs
as cops in ``Dead Heat.''
   Neil Simon returns with the second of his autobiographical
trilogy, ``Biloxi Blues,'' with Matthew Broderick and directed by
Mike Nichols. George Roy Hill (``The Sting'') is back with ``Funny
Farm,'' in which New Yorkers Chevy Chase and Madolyn Smith try the
rural life. Richard Pryor as an engineer moves his family from New
Jersey to Idaho in ``Moving.''
   The ageless George Burns changes brains with his grandson in
``18 Again,'' which might bring to mind ``Like Father Like Son.''
   ``The Gods Must Be Crazy II'' follow the adventures of the
engaging African bushman, N!Xau. Richard Dreyfuss continues his
roll as an actor who impersonates a Central American dictator in
``Moon Over Parador.''
   ``Front Page'' is replayed in TV land with Kathleen Turner, Burt
Reynolds and Christopher Reeve in ``Switching Channels.'' Sally
Field and Tom Hanks star as a pair of stand-up comics in
``Punchline.''
   Those raucous rookies return in ``Police Academy 5: Assignment
Miami Beach,'' this time without Steve Gutenberg.
   Distributors always release a heavy load of dramas in the early
part of the year, when competition for the youth market is at a
minimum. The most anticipated film is ``The Unbearable Lightness of
Being,'' based on the modern classic novel by Milan Kundera. It is
the first movie by Philip Kaufman since ``The Right Stuff.''
   Also long-awaited is Robert Redford's first film as a director
since ``Ordinary People'' _ ``The Milangro Beanfield War,'' about a
New Mexico native who fights developers.
   After sinking with ``Pirates,'' Roman Polanski goes back to the
mystery-adventure genre with ``Frantic,'' starring Harrison Ford as
a surgeon whose wife disappears. Kelly McGillis and Jeff Daniels
appear in a postwar drama about the smuggling of Nazi criminals
into the United States, ``House on Carroll Street.'' Edward James
Olmos (``Miami Vice'') and Lou Diamond Phillips (``La Bamba'')
appear in ``Stand and Deliver,'' about a dedicated teacher in East
L.A.
   Roger Vadim has modernized his 1957 film ``And God Created
Women'' with Rebecca DeMornay in the role that helped make Brigitte
Bardot famous. Blake Edwards presents an imaginary teaming of Tom
Mix (Bruce Willis) and Wyatt Earp (James Garner) to solve a murder
mystery in ``Sunset.''
   Sidney Poitier returns to the screen as an FBI agent in a pair
of films: ``Shoot to Kill,'' a crime chase with Tom Beringer; and
``Little Nikita,'' with River Phoenix as son of Soviet spies.
   Alan Alda breaks his absence from films as director-writer-star
with Ann-Margret in ``A New Life,'' about a divorced pair seeking
new lives.
   In ``Bright Lights, Big City,'' Michael J. Fox abandons his
sunshiny image to play a cocaine-sniffing yuppie in the Manhattan
fast lane. Kelly McGillis and John Shea are pioneering Israelis in
``Dreamers.'' Don Johnson takes a shot at the big screen in ``Sweet
Hearts Dance,'' a romantic drama co-starring Susan Sarandon.
   The new year will bring plenty of action, too. Comic Jay Leno
makes his film debut as a Detroit cop teaming with a Tokyo
detective (Pat Morita) in ``Collision Course.'' Gene Hackman is a
pilot downed in Vietnam and Danny Glover is his rescuer in ``Bat
21.'' The Vietnam trend continues with ``Off Limits,'' in which
Willem Dafoe and Gregory Hines investigate murders of Vietnamese
prostitues.
   Academy Award winners William Hurt and Timothy Hutton combine
for a World War II thriller, ``Destiny.'' Sean Penn appears in two
films: ``Judgment in Berlin,'' as one of three East Berliners
escaping in an airplane; and in ``Colors'' as a police partner with
Robert Duvall battling Los Angeles gangs.
   The macho men are also back: Charles Bronson investigates Mormon
cult murders in ``Messenger of Death''; Scott Glenn is a cop who
becomes an Al Capone henchman in ``Verne Miller.''
   There's an ample supply of horror and teen films, as well as
some that are hard to classify: ``Eat the Rich,'' ``Killer Klowns
(from Outer Space),'' ``Hazing in Hell'' and ``Zombie Cop.''

<DESCRIPT>  MOVIE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  GENE Wilder's jack-o'-lantern grin and Richard Pryor's glare of hair-raising
terror have done wonders to lift many otherwise scattershot comedies above the
doldrums.;    But bright as they are, their gifts do little to elevate
"Another You," a frantically incoherent comedy.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  'ANOTHER YOU' IS ANOTHER LOSER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Movie Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In their fourth film together, Wilder plays a pathological liar named
George Washington who is discharged from a mental hospital after three years
and is given an Abe Lincoln top hat as a parting gift to commemorate his
hard-won honesty.;    Pryor is Eddie, a con man sentenced to do community
service and whose first assignment is to help George make the transition from
hospital to civilian life. Within minutes, they are sucked into an elaborate
scam in which George is mistaken for another Abe, named Fielding, a missing
billionaire beer manufacturer.;    George quickly finds himself the master of
a baronial Beverly Hills mansion with a hostile Great Dane and a sulky wife
(Mercedes Ruehl), who accuses him of adultery. Relapsing briefly to his old
ways, he convinces her to let Eddie live with them by claiming he is the
heavyweight boxer Joe Frazier 40 pounds lighter after a bout with malaria.
Pryor, who does not look well, virtually walks through his role.;    Comedies
have been known to float on even more slender and improbable premises than
"Another You," if they have enough good jokes. But Ziggy Steinberg's
screenplay jabbers along in ways that even Wilder, who carries the brunt of
the dialogue, can't make amusing. Pryor's role is paltry and his dialogue
scant.;    "Another You," which was directed by Maurice Phillips and edited by
Dennis M. Hill, is so choppily put together that it has no internal momentum.
Even the final scenes in which Wilder is almost turned into a beer ingredient
lack punch.  </TEXT>

JOAN BENNETT, MOVIE, STAGE, TV STAR, DIES
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Actress Joan Bennett, whose 50-year career included more than 75 film roles
ranging from sweet, young blondes to sinister and vampy schemers, has died at
her home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 80.
</P>
<P>
Bennett's daughter, Shelley Wanger, said the actress died of a heart attack
while having dinner. She was declared dead on arrival at White Plains Hospital
Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
A star of film, stage and television, her acting career began in 1928 and
spanned some of Hollywood's most glamorous years. Her film credits include the
1933 classic "Little Women," in which she played one of the sisters of actress
Katharine Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
In 1950, she also played a nurturing mother in Vincente Minnelli's comedy,
"Father of the Bride." Bennett starred opposite Elizabeth Taylor and Spencer
Tracy in Minnelli's 1951 comedy "Father's Little Dividend."
</P>
<P>
"I loved working with Spence and Liz," Bennett once told an interviewer. But
she frequently dismissed her celebrity status and said her family was her
life's most fulfilling role.
</P>
<P>
Bennett, who married her first of four husbands at age 16, once said of her
children: "When they were still little, it was in my movie contract that I had
to be home from work in time to bathe and feed and put them to bed."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think much of most of the films I made," she said in 1986. "But being
a movie star was something I liked very much."
</P>
<P>
Bennett was born to an acting family in Palisades, N.J., as the daughter of
Richard Bennett, one of the nation's top stage performers during the first
three decades of the century. Joan Bennett's acting debut was with her father
in a 1928 Broadway play called "Jarnegan." She was 16.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the play she was signed for films, following her two older sisters
to Hollywood. Bennett was 18 when she was chosen by representatives of Samuel
Goldwyn to play her first movie role in "Bulldog Drummond" opposite actor
Ronald Coleman.
</P>
<P>
She was later to work on stage with one of her four daughters, Melinda, in the
play "Susan and God."
</P>
<P>
Bennett's early roles tended to be bland, blonde innocent characters until
1939, when the script for "Trade Winds" required her to wear a brunette wig.
After the change in hair color she was soon portraying a new type of character,
like the Cockney tart in "Man Hunt," an artist's model in "Woman in the Window"
and a scheming woman in "Scarlet Street."
</P>
<P>
Her sinister and sometimes vampy characters led one critic to refer to her as a
"noir priestess."
</P>
<P>
Bennett's marriages and home life were frequently the fodder for Hollywood
gossip sheets. She never liked such attention and once sent Hollywood columnist
Hedda Hopper a live, de-scented skunk.
</P>
<P>
But in 1951, Bennett's third marriage made headlines when her husband, film
producer Walter Wanger, shot Bennett's Hollywood agent twice in the groin.
Bennett witnessed the afternoon shooting in a Los Angeles parking lot.
</P>
<P>
Wanger later told police, "I shot him because I thought he was breaking up my
home." But Bennett said Wanger was distraught over finances and denied any
romantic relationship with the agent, Jennings Lang.
</P>
<P>
Wanger, father of two of Bennett's daughters, served a four-month prison
sentence for the shooting.
</P>
<P>
Bennett's first husband was John Marion Fox, scion of a wealthy Seattle family.
They were married when she was 16 and had one child before they divorced three
years later. In 1932 she married Gene Markey, a writer. They also had one child
and were divorced in 1937. Wanger and Bennett were married in 1940.
</P>
<P>
From 1966 to 1971, Bennett starred in the television soap opera, "Dark
Shadows." She also authored two books, "The Bennett Playbill" and, in the
1950s, "How to Be Attractive."
</P>
<P>
Bennett's film credits also include "For Heaven's Sake," "Desire in the Dust,"
"Mississippi Gambler," "Moby Dick," "She Wanted a Millionaire," "The Texans,
"The Man in The Iron Mask," "Girl Trouble," "We're No Angels," "Navy Wife" and
"House of Dark Shadows."
</P>
<P>
Bennett appeared on stage in "Stage Door," "Pleasure of His Company," "Fallen
Angels" and "Butterflies Are Free."
</P>
<P>
In 1978, she acted in the TV movie "Suddenly Love," followed by "A House
Possessed" in 1980 and "Divorce Wars" in 1981.
</P>
<P>
The actress is survived by her husband, David Wilde, and four daughters, Diana
Anderson of Los Angeles; Melinda Bena of Chappaqua, N.Y.; Stephanie Guest of
Manhattan, and Shelley Wanger of New York.
</P>
<P>
She will be cremated and buried in Old Lyme, Conn. No date has been set, Wilde
said.

   Lights! Camera! Action-adventure! That seems
to be the movie ticket for the winter and spring as the film
industry moves into 1990 with hopes of another record-breaking year.
   Comedy is king this summer, and drama plays a strong role in the
Oscar-conscious fall and holiday season. The first five months of
the year (Memorial Day is the official opening of the summer
season) brings a host of action-adventure from the major studios.
   There will be cop movies galore, and the streets of Los Angeles
will again be littered with cars demolished in high-speed chases.
Among this season's officers: Jamie Lee Curtis, Brian Dennehy,
Steven Seagal, Tom Berenger, Lou Diamond Phillips, Gene Hackman and
Dan Aykroyd.
   ``White Hunter, Black Heart'' is also likely to draw attention.
It is based on Peter Viertel's novel about an adventurous film
director (obviously John Huston) on location in Africa. It's an
offbeat role for Clint Eastwood, who also directed.
   The most eagerly awaited adventure is ``The Hunt for Red
October,'' the first of Tom Clancy's novels to be filmed. Sean
Connery stars as the Russian sub commander and Alec Baldwin is the
CIA analyst probing why the sub is approaching the eastern U.S.
seaboard.
   The police sagas include: ``Loose Cannons,'' Hackman as a
hard-boiled cop and Aykroyd as his partner, who switches
personalities under stress; ``Hard to Kill,'' Steve Seagal as a
detective who seeks revenge after seven years in a coma; ``The Last
of the Finest,'' Brian Dennehy as a suspended cop who uncovers drug
millions; ``Love at Large,'' Tom Berenger and Elizabeth Perkins as
two detectives who fall in love; ``The First Power,'' Lou Diamond
Phillips in pursuit of a serial killer; and ``Blue Steel'' with
Jamie Lee Curtis also in pursuit of a serial killer.
   Adventure of a more exotic sort will be offered with ``Mountains
of the Moon,'' about the search for the origins of the Nile by two
19th-century explorers.
   Want to be scared? Paramount Pictures is presenting ``Tales From
the Darkside: The Movie,'' with stories by Stephen King, Arthur
Canon Doyle and others. ``Roger Corman's Frankenstein Unbound''
marks Corman's first direction in 20 years. William Friedkin (``The
Exorcist'') returns to horror with ``The Guardian.''
   Robert De Niro is back in the Mafia scene in ``Good Fellas.''
Arnold Schwarznegger finds action in the year 2075 in ``Total
Recall,'' directed by Paul Verhoeven (``Robocop'').
   Among the comedies, ``I Love You to Death'' holds promise with
stars Kevin Kline, Tracey Ullman, William Hurt and River Phoenix.
The latest ``Saturday Night Live'' comic to join the movies is Dana
Carvey, the Church Lady, who plays his own gender in ``Opportunity
Knocks.'' SNL alumnus Bill Murray co-directs himself and Geena
Davis in ``Quick Change.''
   Marlon Brando resumes with the Mafia in ``The Freshman,'' as a
mobster who befriends student Matthew Broderick. Dudley Moore stars
with Daryl Hannah in ``Crazy People,'' a comedy about the ad world.
There is Southern Gothic humor in ``Daddy's Dyin' (Who's Got the
Will?)'' with Tess Harper, Beverly D`Angelo and Beau Bridges. Tom
Hanks and Meg Ryan star in a romantic comedy with the unlikely
title of ``Joe Versus the Volcano.''
   Two added attractions are ``Ernest Goes to Jail'' and ``The Gods
Must Be Crazy II.''
   The long-delayed ``The Two Jakes'' will certainly draw attention
among the dramas. It's Jack Nicholson's followup to ``Chinatown,''
also starring Harvey Keitel and Meg Tilly.
   Bette Midler revives the old Barbara Stanwyck tearjerker
``Stella Dallas'' in ``Stella.'' Hot star Kevin Costner courts
trouble in ``Revenge'' when he falls in love with the wife of a
powerful Mexican (Anthony Quinn). In ``Texasville,'' Peter
Bogdonavich traces the later history of ``The Last Picture Show''
people.
   Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro fall in love when she teaches him
to read in ``Stanley and Iris.'' Jessica Lange learns to cope with
widowhood in the big city in ``Men Don't Leave.'' Nick Nolte and
Debra Winger get involved in murder and corruption in ``Everybody
Wins.''
   More drama: Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in ``Pretty Woman'';
Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney in ``Miller's Crossing''; a young
cast in a new version of ``Lord of the Flies.''
   The season seems to offer films for every taste; there's even a
movie about volleyball, ``Side Out.'' Except for ``The Hunt for Red
October'' and ``The Two Jakes,'' none of the films seems to have
the smell of a sure winner. But then, neither did ``Dead Poets
Society,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and ``Look Who's Talking,''
the unlikely hits of 1989.

<LEADPARA>  Gene Wilder, the widower of the late comedian Gilda Radner, urged Congress to
increase spending for testing and research on ovarian cancer, the disease that
killed his wife. Radner would have lived longer if doctors had had her family
history to help them diagnose the cancer earlier, Wilder said Thursday before
the House Appropriations subcommittee dealing with health issues. Ovarian
cancer kills some 12,400 women a year. Radner died in 1989 at age 42.  </LEADPARA>

   Comedian Gilda Radner said in an interview weeks
before her death that husband Gene Wilder always believed she would
be well and never displayed fear of the ovarian cancer that killed
her.
   ``I'm lucky I'm with a man who isn't superficial,'' she said in
the interview in June's Glamour magazine.
   ``I think he was really put to the test. But he loves and cares
about what's inside me _ who I am, rather than if I have hair.''
   She said in the March 31 interview she told Wilder, ``You have
handled this about the best that anyone could. After I finish this
every woman in the world will be after you. The trouble is, they're
all gonna have some major illness.''
   She said Wilder never broke down and cried or seemed afraid that
she might not recover.
   ``He's always had this total confidence that I would be well.
I've never seen any fear in his eyes. And I would be the first one
to pick up on it. Now he says back in the early days that he did
feel fear. You know what? He may just be a great actor!''
   Wilder ``always treated me normally. If he was mad at me, he was
mad at me. I don't think I could have stood it if anybody had
treated me as fragile or as though I had a limited time on earth,''
Radner said.
   Radner died Saturday.
   A book about her illness, ``It's Always Something,'' will soon
be published.

<HEAD>`Ghostbusters Sequel Hot at Box Office</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Ghostbusters II'' zapped through a record by
collecting $29.4 million in its first three days as the summer of
'89 kept going like gangbusters at the nation's box offices.
   The Columbia Studios' film's $8.3 million on Sunday was the
biggest non-holiday Sunday ever, according to Exhibitor Relations
Inc., which tallies box-offce receipts.
   ``We are thrilled with the opening weekend's record breaking
results and we anticipate that `Ghostbusters II' will play very
strongly in the coming weeks,'' said Columbia's new chief, Dawn
Steel.
   The previous three-day record was set earlier this month by
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' which earned $21.2 million
in its second week.
   It also easily topped Columbia's previous three-day record of
$13.6 million for ``Ghostbusters'' in June 1984.
   Since the debut of Bill Murray's and Dan Aykroyd's paranormal
investigators, Columbia has been spooked by several cinematic
clunkers, most recently ``True Believer,'' ``The Adventures of Baron
Munchausen'' and ``Physical Evidence.''
   The company's only hit in recent years was 1987's ``La Bamba.''
   The true test for `Ghostbusters II'' comes Friday, when it will
compete with the much-hyped ``Batman.''
   Steven Spielberg's ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' kept up
its charge, selling $11.7 million in tickets last weekend to claim
second place on the box-office charts. In just four weeks, it has
grossed more than $122 million.
   ``Dead Poets Society,'' the bittersweet prep school drama, earned
$9.1 million to pass ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier'' and move
into third place.
   ``Star Trek V,'' the first film directed by star William Shatner,
slipped badly from first to fourth place on sales of $7.1 million.
   In fifth was ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' with Richard Pryor
and Gene Wilder, with $2.5 million. The baseball movie ``Field of
Dreams,'' starring Kevin Costner, finished in sixth with $2.4
million. In seventh was the wrestling film ``No Holds Barred,'' with
$1.7 million.
   Rounding out the top 10 were ``Road House,'' with $1.5 million,
``Pet Sematary'' with $1.2 million and ``K-9'' with $1 million.
   Since Memorial Day weekend, weekend box office revenues have
grossed $247.3 million, compared with $220 million for the period
last year, an increase of 11 percent, said John Krier of Exhibitor
Relations Inc., which tallies the box-office receipts.
   ``The gross isn't distributed quite the same,'' he said. ``Last
year there were more pictures playing and the gross was more evenly
distributed. This year the grosses are concentrated in the top two
or three movies.''
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of screens,
average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in release.
   1. ``Ghostbusters II,'' Columbia, $29.4 million, 2,327 screens,
$12,229 per screen, $29.4 million, one week.
   2. ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' Paramount, $11.7
million, 2,327 screens, $5,039 per screen, $122.3 million, four
weeks.
   3. ``Dead Poets Society,'' Disney, $9.1 million, 1,091 screens,
$8,343 per screen, $22.4 million, three weeks.
   4. ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,'' Paramount, $7.1 million,
2,202 screens, $3,247 per screen, $31.2 million, two weeks.
   5. ``See No Evil, Hear No Evil,'' Tri-Star, $2.5 million, 1686
screens, $1512 per screen, $38 million, six weeks.
   6. ``Field of Dreams,'' Universal, $2.4 million, 1,077 screens,
$2,265 per screen, $44.2 million, nine weeks.
   7. ``No Holds Barred,'' New Line, $1.6 million, 1,327 screens,
$1,339 per screen, $12 million, three weeks.
   8. ``Road House,'' MGM-UA, $1.5 million, 1,435 screens, $1,069
per screen, $23.8 million, five weeks.
   9. ``Pet Sematary,'' Paramount, $1.2 million, 923 screens, $1,365
per screen, $52.7 million, nine weeks.
   10. ``K-9,'' Universal, $1 million, 970 screens, $1,055 per
screen, $36.7 million, eight weeks.

Romancing the Stone (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is the delightful 1984 comedy in
which a dowdy author of best-selling romances is plunged into adventures beyond
her wildest imaginings -- with Michael Douglas as her breezy, rugged leading
man. Director Robert Zemeckis and writer Diane Thomas have pulled off an
amusing reworking of genre conventions.

The Goodbye Girl (Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.) is quintessential Neil Simon:
slick, sentimental, well turned out and entertaining. In this diverting 1977
comedy directed by Herbert Ross, Marsha Mason plays a Broadway dancer whose
male friends have a chronic tendency to bid her farewell -- until her latest ex
sublets his portion to struggling actor Richard Dreyfuss (who won an Oscar for
his comic portrayal), with whom she immediately clashes. You can take it from
there.
</P>
<P>
Resurrection (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is a captivating, unjustly
neglected 1980 film dealing with the possibility of healing by love, which is
not precisely the same thing as healing by faith. Ellen Burstyn plays a woman
who recovers from a near-fatal auto accident and is transformed by strange new
powers, including the power to heal. Written by Lewis John Carlino and directed
by Daniel Petrie, the film also features Sam Shepard and Eva Le Galliene, who
are as impressive as Burstyn.
</P>
<P>
Whoopi Goldberg stars as a pool-hustling mother in the romantic comedy Kiss
Shot (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.), a new TV movie that co-stars Dorian Harewood,
Dennis Franz and Tasha Scott.
</P>
<P>
Hardbodies (Channel 5 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), whose title refers to the "scores
of sexy girls" who hang out at the local beaches, is a crass, hard-boiled,
voyeuristic 1984 movie ostensibly geared to the teen market. Sorrells Pickard,
Gary Wood and Michael Rapport star as three middle-aged men who rent a beach
house to surf, sun and score; the result is a muddled and infantile male
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
The Return of the Shaggy Dog, Part 1 (ABC Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a 1987 TV
movie sequel to the 1959 Disney hit. This time villains steal a magic ring
which has the power to turn a young attorney into a big dog. The film concludes
next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Alamo (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is the ponderous 1960 Western epic in
which John Wayne directed as well as starred. The attack on the fortress is
impressive but it takes a long while to get to it.
</P>
<P>
The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) is a
tragicomic meditation on the Baker Street duo, in which Billy Wilder shrewdly
fills in the spots that Conan Doyle left blank: Holmes' failures, his sex life
and the motives for his cocaine habit. Robert Stephens is Sherlock, Colin
Blakely is Watson, and the movie is one of Wilder's least cynical and most
romantic, a sadly elegant celebration of gaslit sleuthery. All this comes
through even though the 1970 film, a prime candidate for restoration, was cut
from its roadshow length prior to release.
</P>
<P>
Edgar Ulmer's 1945 film noir classic Detour (Channel 28 Friday at 11:30 p.m.)
is a perfect late-night show, one of the most relentlessly intense
psychological thrillers ever filmed. Tom Neal and Ann Savage star.
</P>
<P>
Not to be missed: Kevin Brownlow and David Gill's "The Unknown Chaplin"
(Channel 28 Saturday at 9 p.m.), a three-hour study which allows us to see how
the master painstakingly developed his gags.
</P>
<P>
Tarzan in Manhattan (CBS Saturday at 9 p.m.) is a new TV movie in which the
Edgar Rice Burroughs character searches New York for hunters who kidnaped
Cheetah.

DAVID LYNCH'S 'WILD AT HEART' WOWS CANNES;
</P>
<P>
FILM: THE DIRECTOR INTENDS TO CUT HIS VIOLENT, PROFANE AND EROTIC MOVIE TO GET
AN R RATING.

David Lynch's "Wild at Heart," his first feature film since the controversial
"Blue Velvet," was met with wild enthusiasm at its world premiere at the Cannes
Film Festival Saturday, but it's a version of the film that may be seen only by
a handful of Americans at home.
</P>
<P>
That handful is made up of members of the Motion Picture Assn. of America's
Sherman Oaks-based ratings board, a group that Lynch is certain will demand
changes in the film to get an R rating.
</P>
<P>
"This is the version that will be shown in Europe, but we're going to have a
few problems in the U.S. for sure," Lynch said, during a post-screening press
conference. "I don't know why it is, but (the ratings board) has been getting
very conservative lately. . . . There will be some changes we have to make."
</P>
<P>
Lynch and the film's producers acknowledged at the press conference that he is
contractually obligated to work his film into shape for an R rating. The
question is how much cutting and editing that will require.
</P>
<P>
"Wild at Heart" is a rural nightmare about a pair of young lovers who hit the
road to escape the girl's domineering and dotty mother, and end up being
pursued by professional -- and very weird -- assassins. The film is as violent
as "Blue Velvet" and vastly more erotic, meaning that it may provoke the
industry censors to slap it with an X rating on two counts -- for sex and
violence.
</P>
<P>
Make that three counts; the movie is also chockablock with profanity.
</P>
<P>
The leavening factor of "Wild at Heart" is that it is also Lynch's funniest
film. Those few people who can pat themselves on the back for "getting" Lynch's
offbeat sense of humor in the cult films "Eraserhead" and "Blue Velvet" have
been joined by millions of TV viewers who have rallied around Lynch's series
"Twin Peaks." And if "Wild at Heart" survives the ratings process without
serious damage, his growing army of fans have a treat coming.
</P>
<P>
Laura Dern, who plays a hipper version of the small-town optimist that she
played in "Blue Velvet," isolates the theme of "Wild at Heart" when she tells
her parolee boyfriend Sailor (Nicolas Cage) that "The world is wild at heart
and weird on top." In David Lynch's world, of course, it is pretty weird all
the way through.
</P>
<P>
But the same tone of absurdity that made "Blue Velvet" a jolt and "Twin Peaks"
a joy are turned up to full volume in "Wild at Heart," which is scheduled for
release in the United States by the Samuel Goldwyn Co. Lynch calls the film a
"violent comedy," and he's got it right. The audience at its maiden screening
here (or was it just the Americans?) were howling.
</P>
<P>
Cage, one of the most daring actors of his generation, has created a character
here as interestingly offbeat as his other parolee in "Raising Arizona" and the
faux vampire in last year's "Vampire's Kiss." Cage plays a good-hearted but
short-tempered petty thief who wears a snakeskin jacket, talks and sings like
Elvis Presley, and wears his heart on his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
The story was adapted by Lynch from an unpublished novel by Barry Gifford. The
novel follows Sailor's cross-country flight, but it was Lynch who turned the
whole thing into a comically dark version of "The Wizard of Oz."
</P>
<P>
We're not making assumptions; the film is laced with references to "The Wizard
of Oz," the yellow brick road, and it even includes ghostly appearances by the
good and bad witches from that tale.
</P>
<P>
As with "Blue Velvet," Lynch used music from the 1950s to evoke a mood that
seems to separate good and evil and bury evil just beneath the surface. The
films lure you into a false sense of well-being, then ambush you with
unpredictable -- sometimes unspeakable -- acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
Does the ratings board take into consideration the context and tone of films
before affixing them with the dreaded X? Lately, as Lynch said, it's been hard
to tell.
</P>
<P>
Lynch made it clear Saturday that he will not get caught up in a fight with the
ratings board. "This is not going to be a breakthrough movie," he said, when
asked if he thought a debate over his film might prompt changes that critics
and others have been calling for in the ratings system.
</P>
<P>
So far, the MPAA has resisted adding an adult-only rating between the R
(children under 17 not admitted without a parent or guardian) and the X, which
has become associated with pornography. (MPAA President Jack Valenti debates
the ratings with TV film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel on CBS tonight at
10. See Morning Report, Page 2.)
</P>
<P>
"We're upset about (having to cut scenes to get an R rating)," he said. "But
there's not a whole lot we can do about it."

   With spring comes baseball. And what better way to celebrate
America's favorite sport than by taking home a few videos.
   Hollywood once considered baseball movies box-office poison
because movie moguls thought women, who constitute a large part of
film-goers, wouldn't want to see them and foreign audiences simply
didn't understand the mechanics.
   Before the late 1980s, studio heads may have had a point. Some
of the all-time baseball classics, though warmly embraced by fans,
did lousy box office. Such movies as 1942's ``The Pride of the
Yankees,'' starring Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig were big
disappointments.
   However, ``The Natural,'' Robert Redford's allegorical movie in
1984 about a gifted player, and ``Bull Durham'' (1988), an amusing
and lusty tale of the minor leagues starring Kevin Costner and
Susan Sarandon, helped turn things around.
   The biggest grossing baseball movie of all time is last year's
``Field of Dreams,'' which had taken in $53.3 million by August.
``Bull Durham'' was second with $50.3 million. And the comedy
smash, ``Major League'' (1989), ran third with $48.5 million. All
three are on video.
   There are other baseball movies hard-core fans might want to
watch that will even be enjoyed by those who've never downed a hot
dog at the park.
   Here's a list of other baseball movies that are available on
video:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``College'' (1927): Buster Keaton as the unwitting jock who
tries to woe the love of his life through sports.

   ``Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' (1949): Gene Kelly, Esther
Williams and Frank Sinatra in a lackluster musical directed by
Busby Berkeley.
   ``The Jackie Robinson Story'' (1950): A poignant and hard look
at baseball's ugly history: racism. One of best biographical
baseball movies ever made, starring Jackie Robinson as himself.
   ``Damn Yankees'' (1958): Lola gets whatever Lola wants. Stars
Gwen Verdon, Ray Walston and Tab Hunter.

   ``Bang the Drum Slowly'' (1973): Excellent performances by
Michael Moriarity and Robert de Niro as two baseball buddies who
together face tragedy. ``The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars and
Motor Kings'' (1976): A delightful romp of a group of black
baseball players touring rural America in the 1930s. Nice touches
by James Earl Jones, Billy Dee Williams and Richard Pryor.
   ``The Bad News Bears'' (1976): The first of a string of kiddie
baseball flicks. But the first is definitely the best and the
funniest. Stars Tatum O'Neal and Walter Matthau.
   ``The Bad News Bears Go to Japan'' (1978): O'Neal and Matthau
wisely dropped out.
   ``The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training'' (1977): Bad news.
   ``It's My Turn'' (1980): A limp love story starring Jill
Clayburgh and Michael Douglas.
   ``Eight Men Out'' (1988): John Sayles tough look at the 1919
Black Sox scandal with a wonderful ensemble cast.
   ``Stealing Home'' (1988): A rambling study about a talented
baseball player whose life takes a turn when he learns about the
suicide of a young woman from his past.

CITY SLICKERS 2 (12) Paul Weiland
ABRAHAM VALLEY (PG) Manoel De Oliveira
GETTYSBURG (PG) Roland F. Maxwell
FAUST (15) Jan Svankmajer
The curse of movie sequels is the tyranny of plot. Part one of a cine-saga
is enriched by the process of introducing characters and developing their
foibles and interplay. In part two that groundwork is done - so the
film-makers must throw down their spades and take up their scaffolding
tools. Build that narrative adventure-playground] Make the characters Do
Something] The higher the climbing-frame the better; and never mind how
silly the design, so long as there are enough 'What next?' rungs to grab the
attention.
City Slickers was a comedy about a band of urban males surrendering to
Nature on a dude cowboy holiday. No plot in particular: just a funny tale of
culture shock in cactusland. CS2 has a different feel from the start. The
humanist honeymoon is over; the Hollywood hokum is about to begin. We
imagine the opening salvoes at the story conference. 'Guys, we gotta have a
story this time round]' And then, 'Guys, we gotta bring Jack Palance back
into this pic even though he died in the first one. He won us an Oscar]'
Well, there are only two ways to bring a dead character back: as a ghost or
a twin. Slickers 2 opts for the second. Grizzled Jack plays his fraternal
double while star/screenwriter Billy Crystal re-plays Mr Menopausal of
Manhattan, whom wild horses would not drag back into the wilderness but whom
a Compelling Plot Device just might. 'Try buried treasure,' an excited
executive must have said. So they do.
Off to wildest Utah go Mitch (Crystal), Phil (Daniel Stern) and a token new
character in Mitch's brother (John Lovitz). And soon Palance is pouncing off
a rock at them. He is after the treasure as well, since it is his Pop's. He
growls; he hisses through that gargoyle mail-slit of a mouth; he generally
behaves like a great character actor required to ham it up.
Not all is lost, even though Palance is squandered. Crystal can still
deliver a mean one-liner, whether discussing brotherhood with Phil - 'I
can't believe you two are from the same gene pool,' says Phil; 'He's from
the shallow end' answers Mitch.
But mostly everyone seems dazed by the piling on of plot and of irrelevant
action sequences, including a silly stampede. Director Paul Weiland, out of
British TV commercials by one disastrous previous feature outing (Leonard
Part VI), brings little flair to the visuals and not much more to the jokes.
For true comedy you should try Abraham Valley. This purports to be a film by
Portuguese director Manoel De Oliveira, maker of those magisterial lost-love
epics Francesca and Amor Di Perdicao. But we wonder at times if it is not a
lost episode of Monty Python.
To escape the life of deranged formality she has been born into - the
sun-lanced salons, the starched dinners - our heroine Ema leads the life of
a woman inspired, as the film and the novel it is drawn from (by Agustina
Bessa-Luis) make clear, by her Flaubertian namesake.
Bovaryish, she marries a medico: 'a clever doctor, expert in phlegm' says
the voice-over narrator. Bovaryish, she has affairs, reads a lot and gets
bored amid the lovely, yawning scenery. The press-show audience gave a
sympathetic chortle when the narrator told us, after two hours of this
near-catatonic three-hour tragedy/social satire/romance, 'Ema was intent on
stepping up the pace of her life, in any way she could think of'.
Yes indeed. If only. Instead, 60 minutes later, she steps on the rotten
plank of a boat jetty and drowns in what appears to be all of three feet of
water.
Like any seraphically bad film, Abraham Valley has its seraphically good
moments. Oliveira can place a human profile against a painterly blur of
autumn colours and make it an image of searing, hieratic beauty. And he can
freeze the film for moments of meditation, when a poised landscape or
character-grouping define not just a moment but a milieu, even an epoch.
But then the film reverts to its crazed story of passion - this woman causes
cars to crash merely by standing on a terrace - and to its Loony Tunes
one-liners from the narrator. 'Ema put on a boiler suit to go mad in a motor
boat,' he intones at one point; and we are almost too dazed to savour the
line's battiness. But how else to bombard a little life into a woman who is
not so much a human being, more a carbon copy of literary heroines past: a
Flaubert parrot, shall we say, mimicking the cries of a superior creation.
Gettysburg is four and a half hours of the magnificent in hand-to-hand
combat with the mundane. It was made for American TV, so we have no big
stars: just big beards and big battles. Tom Berenger and Martin Sheen sport
the devouring face-fungus as Confederate Generals Longstreet and Lee and
Jeff Daniels is concealed under a walrus moustache as Colonel Chamberlain.
He held the yankees' flank in round one of the Civil War's bloodiest battle,
leading the bayonet charge from the hill known as Little Round Top.
Daniels shows how it should be done. Not impaling Southerners, we mean, but
holding the high acting ground. He delivers the speeches about democracy
with fearless passion; he delivers the tears as comrades die. Daniels'
piercing simplicity as an actor ends up 'holding the line' for the entire
film.
Nothing matches him. Writer-director Ronald F. Maxwell spends the first half
rooting for the North, the second hobnobbing in the Southern camp as Sheen,
Berenger and company get ready for the suicidal assault known as Pickett's
March. Hundreds of extras; serial cannons spitting smoke; and an aerial
camera weaving like a conductor's baton to Randy Edelmann's remorselessly
'stirring' music.
We are stirred. But should we not also have been shaken? The deaths are lost
in the grim abundance of clutched stomachs, unhorsed cavalrymen and
blast-catapulted bodies. We tell ourselves to be appalled. But we wait,
vainly, for the one true moment of felt and intimate horror.
Jan Svankmajer's Faust treads the city of Prague like a lost tourist in
Kafkaland. The film begins with live action, as our clerkish, woebegone hero
(Petr Cepek) threads the city's alleys and labyrinths as if they were the
mazes of his own minds. Then on dance menacing puppets, the writhing clay
creatures, the bald, hog-toothed Mephistopheles and the giant wooden mask
that disgorges mini-marionettes like Gulliver throwing up Lilliputians.
Kafka? Make that Kafka with a dash of Swift, Spitting Image and Hieronymous
Bosch. Much of Faust is appallingly funny; most of it is inspirationally
surreal; and some of it is a touch laborious, as we would expect when a
short-film genius goes to feature length. Wit and vision, though, are rare
enough in the movie world: we are not about to send them back even when they
are thinly spread.

   A Cincinnati Zoo cheetah which often is taken
to visit school classes or to meet with VIPs is meeting this weekend
with Britain's Prince Charles in Florida.
   Angel, an 8-year-old cheetah escorted on a leash by zoo handler
Cathryn Hilker, is to meet the prince during a weekend of events
including benefits to raise funds for Friends of Conservation to
save endangered animas in east Africa.
   Also to be introduced from the Cincinnati Zoo is Fiera the
ocelot, a spotted wild cat from South America, accompanied by zoo
staffer Cathy Tompson.
   ``The ocelot has become endangered because of the pet craze,''
Ms. Hilker said. ``When trappers find baby ocelots, they kill the
mother to take the babies for pet stores.''
   Socializing with celebrities isn't new for Angel. The cheetah has
already met actor Jimmy Stewart, former U.S. Interior Secretary
Donald Hodel, and Manuel Esquivel, prime minister of the Central
American country of Belize.
   ``Angel is bored by everybody,'' her trainer said. ``It's as if
she's saying, `Oh, gosh, here they come again.'''

   Surgeons inserted a pin in the
shoulder of actor James Caan, and he should be released from St.
Johns Hospital and Medical Center in a week, his publicist said
Thursday.
   Caan, who broke four ribs and suffered a separated shoulder when
he crashed his motorcycle Sunday, was in good spirits, said Paul
Bloch.
   ``He had a screw put in his left shoulder,'' said Bloch. ``They
expect another week of hospitalization.''
   Caan, 48, was headed to lunch in Santa Monica with three
motorcycle buddies when a car swerved in their path, said Bloch.
Caan grabbed too hard on the brakes and was tossed over the
handlebars, he said.

   Comedian Gilda Radner should be out of the
hospital next week after surgery to correct complications of cancer
treatment, a hospital spokesman said.
   Miss Radner, 42, was in fair condition after the surgery
Wednesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said the spokesman, Ron
Wise. Her comic-actor husband Gene Wilder, 53, was with her, Wise
said.
   Wise called the surgery routine and said it corrected
complications stemming from cancer treatment Miss Radner had last
year. He declined to give precise information.
   Miss Radner, an original ``Saturday Night Live'' cast member, had
successfully battled ovarian cancer, diagnosed in 1986.
   ``The surgery definitely wasn't related to any malignancies,''
Wise said. ``Her physicians wanted her to wait until she was feeling
good and was strong enough. She's planning a book tour soon, so she
decided to have it done before the tour.''
   The actress was expected to launch her book, ``It's Always
Something,'' after her recovery.
