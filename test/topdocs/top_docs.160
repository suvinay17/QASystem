   Jacobs listed exact amounts and items for which no reporting is
required, such as his home, equity in his pension plan,
automobiles, and home and office furnishings. The $111,358 he
reported as ``gifts'' was an estimate of the value of his defense
without fee by the Washington law firm of Arnet, Fox, Kintner,
Plotkin &amp; Kahn in a libel case brought by evangelist Pat Robertson.
Jacobs won the case, but still had to pay $14,000 for other
expenses.
   This was the case that revolved around Jacobs' tip to reporters
that Robertson had bragged that his father, a U.S. senator, had
pulled strings to keep Robertson out of combat in Korea. Robertson
later dropped a similar action against McCloskey.
   Jacobs counted himself extraordinarily wealthy, since he claimed
his dog, a Great Dane named Friend, as a ``priceless'' asset.

   House Speaker Jim Wright, under fire for
allegedly using his position for personal gain, climbed out of debt
last year, according to a financial disclosure statement released
today.
   The forms showed that the Texas Democrat paid off debts of
between $105,000 and $200,000 and now has no liabilities, but his
assets also declined. He listed 1988 assets of $31,005 to $100,000
_ compared with between $155,000 and $435,000 the year before.
   Those figures do not fully reflect holdings placed in a blind
trust established by Wright in 1987.
   House members and senators must annually report their outside
income, including speaking fees _ known as honoraria _ gifts,
assets and liabilities. The reports of most of the 435 House
members were released today; the Senate's were released last Friday.
   The forms included those of two members of the House who had
previous careers in television comedies and a former baseball
player.
   Former actor Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, reported $20,021 in residual
income from the ``The Love Boat,'' a long-running series in which
he played Gopher, a skirt-chasing officer on a cruise ship.
   Ben Jones, D-Ga., reported only $11,212 in residuals. Jones
appeared on the ``Dukes of Hazzard.''
   Republican Jim Bunning of Kentucky, a former pitcher, got a $350
royalty check from the Major League Baseball Players Alumni
Association.
   Hank Brown, R-Colo., listed not only his own income but that of
his wife and three teen-age children. Christy Brown, 19, made
$1,600 working in another congressman's office and $295 for
babysitting and yard work. Her sister Lori, 17, worked in a movie
theater for $1,547 and earned $367 for babysitting and 19-year-old
Harry got $370 for yard work.
   Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., earned $5,000 for his jewelry
designs.
   Claude Pepper, D-Fla., the chief spokesman in Congress for the
elderly, and currently a patient at Walter Reed Army Medical
Center, drew $14,916 in Social Security benefits.
   Speaker Wright has been charged with violating House ethics
rules for activities that include getting abnormally high royalties
from bulk sales of a book and for his financial relationship with
Fort Worth developer George Mallick.
   Wright reported no more book earnings last year, but he paid off
a note worth between $50,000 and $100,000 from Mallightco, Inc.,
the partnership he formed with Mallick.
   He listed owning less than $5,000 worth of stock in Jewell
Enterprises, a nursing home operation that also has drawn the
attention of the House ethics committee.
   Investments and $30,000 in speaking fees brought Wright's income
up to a range of $188,183 to $203,579, nearly doubling his
speaker's salary of $115,000. He reported receiving no gifts.
   Each member of Congress, except for the speaker and two leaders,
is paid $89,500 a year. House members are limited to earning an
additional 30 percent _ or $26,850 _ in honoraria. Many lawmakers
go over the limit, but donate any excess to charity.
   The amounts in the financial disclosure forms list only ranges.
For example, properties worth $52,000 and $98,000, respectively,
both would be listed in the ``D'' or $50,001-to-$100,000 range. An
asset worth millions would be listed simply as over $250,000.
   This tends to hide the true wealth of the individual, but it
represents a guide to sources of outside income, investments and
the like.
   Wright's chief vote-counter, House Majority Whip Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., doubled his salary with $90,100 from 53 paid speeches. To
get under the House ceiling in honoraria, he gave $63,575 to
charity in 177 separate contributions.
   The House Republican leader, Rep. Bob Michel of Illinois,
reported income of $165,865 to $180,864 and assets of $165,000 to
$400,000. He earned twice as much as Wright in speaking fees but
gave $30,900 out of the total $60,500 to charity to get under the
limit.
   Michel, an avid golfer, also managed to outfit himself for his
game by taking part in charity tournaments.
   His forms showed he received $250 in golf clothing and
accessories from the Bob Hope Desert Classic; $316 worth of
``carry-all, glasses, atlas, frame, calendar, golf clothing, and
golf balls'' from the Kemper Open; $250 in clothing and accessories
from the Jerry Ford Invitational; and $150 in golf-related gifts
from the Danny Thompson Memorial Golf Tournament, named for a
baseball player who died of cancer.
   Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the House Republican whip whose complaint
launched the ethics probe of Wright, accepted $28,550 in honoraria
and gave $1,750 to charity.
   A complaint is pending before the ethics committee against
Gingrich, charging that he violated House rules with a partnership
he formed in 1984 to promote his book ``Window of Opportunity.'' He
didn't report earning any royalties from the book last year.
   Gingrich was reimbursed for 11 trips on which he made speeches
to various groups. GOPAC, a political action committee chaired by
Gingrich that promotes Republican candidates, paid the expenses on
14 trips by Gingrich and three by his wife.
   House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., reported income
of $134,250 to $138,250. Most of the excess over his $99,500
leadership salary came from making speeches. Foley listed nearly
two dozen stock transactions, but it appeared from the numbers that
he did little better than breaking even.
   Foley also accepted several trips, including one with his wife
to Hong Kong and Tokyo for a conference, with his plane fare and
his hotel accommodations paid for by the Japan Society in New York.
   Other members of Congress also took some exotic trips in 1988.
   Democrat J. Roy Rowland, D-Ga., took a 13-day journey with his
wife to Australia and New Zealand with their expenses paid by
Qantas Airways and farm groups from the two countries.
   Elizabeth Patterson, D-S.C., received all expenses in connection
with a trip to Taiwan from the Chinese Culture University.
   Alex McMillan, R-N.C., diligently recorded gifts received in
five double-spaced pages.
   He included a 1988 season's pass to Grandfather Mountain, $4.95
in Irish Cream Mints from tobacco distributors, two green bagels
from a fellow congressman, three pairs of over-the-calf socks
valued at $13.50 and a copy of the book, ``Honest Graft,'' by
Brooks Jackson, which details Democratic campaign fundraising.
   Some House members were given extensions for filing their
disclosure forms and 21 were not available today.

   Hundreds of House members boosted their income
last year with speaking fees, investments and money from such other
sources as jewelry making and TV residuals, disclosure forms showed
Monday. House Speaker Jim Wright paid off at least $105,000 in debt
but may have had to dig into personal assets to do it.
   The most common addition to congressional pay was in fat fees
from interest groups in exchange for giving speeches.
   Almost all House members have outside investments, some
substantial.
   Some earn money from previous careers _ including pensions.
   Some moonlight.
   For example, Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., a Northern
Cheyenne Indian, earned $5,000 last year for his jewelry designs.
   Rep. Tom McMillen, D-Md., a former National Basketball
Association player, received deferred income totaling $45,000 from
the Washington Bullets and Atlanta Hawks. He also reported $10,000
in income for renting space and equipment to his re-election
campaign.
   The disclosure forms filed annually by all 535 members of the
House and Senate provide a look at Congress' outside income and the
wealth _ or lack thereof _ of each member. Each form lists a
member's money received, his assets and liabilities.
   The Senate reports were released last Friday.
   House members are limited to earning an additional 30 percent _
or $26,850 _ in honoraria for appearances. Most lawmakers donate
anything over that to charity.
   The forms do not provide precise data on congressional income,
listing only ranges. For example, properties worth $52,000 and
$98,000, respectively, both would be listed in the
$50,001-to-$100,000 range. An asset worth millions could be listed
simply as more than $250,000 unless a member chose to spell it out.
   This often shrouds the true wealth of an individual member but
does provide a guide to where that lawmaker derives investment and
other income.
   Wright, who has been under investigation for allegations that he
used his leadership position for financial gain, got out of debt in
1988, according to his disclosure statement.
   His debt: Somewhere between $105,000 and $200,000 was paid off,
leaving Wright with no financial liabilities.
   His assets: Somewhere between $31,005 to $100,000, compared with
a range of $155,000 to $435,000 in 1987. But the current accounting
does not include holdings in the blind trust he established in 1987.
   House members' homes also needn't be listed.
   The financial disclosure statements show that honoraria _
generally fees for outside speeches _ were an important part of the
incomes of many of the 435 House members, supplementing a federal
salary which in most cases comes to $89,500.
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., the third-ranking
House Democrat, doubled his salary last year with $90,100 from 53
paid speeches. To get under the House ceiling in honoraria, he gave
$63,575 to charity in 177 separate donations.
   House Republican leader Bob Michel of Illinois reported income
of $165,865 to $180,864 and assets of $165,000 to $400,000. He
earned twice the $30,000 Wright earned in speaking fees, giving
$30,900 out of the total $60,500 to charity.
   Michel listed some of the side benefits of taking part in
charity golf tournaments: $966 worth of golf clothing and
paraphernalia from the Bob Hope Desert Classic, the Kemper Open,
the Jerry Ford Invitational and others.
   House Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., reported income
of $134,250 to $138,250. Most of the excess over his $99,500
leadership salary came from fees for speeches.
   Foley was among many House members who accepted trips. The Japan
Society in New York picked up the air fare and hotel tab for travel
to Hong Kong and Tokyo to attend a conference.
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who said his
assets are no more than $45,000, did not list any royalties in 1988
from his book, ``Window of Opportunity.''
   A complaint is pending before the House ethics committee in
connection with a limited partnership formed in 1984 to promote the
book.
   Gingrich's expenses were reimbursed on 11 trips for speeches to
various groups. GOPAC, a political action committee chaired by
Gingrich which promotes Republican candidates, paid the expenses on
14 trips by Gingrich and three by his wife.
   Here is how some lawmakers _ including two former actors and a
major league pitcher _ added to their congressional incomes in 1988:
   _ Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, reported $20,021 in residual income from
the ``The Love Boat,'' the long-running series in which he played
Gopher.
   _ Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., reported $11,212 in residuals. Jones
appeared on the ``Dukes of Hazzard.''
   _ Rep. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., a former pitcher, got a $350 royalty
check from the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association.
   _ Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally, D-Calif., was reimbursed by a variety
of groups last year for two sweeps across Africa and trips to
Israel, Japan, Korea, Puerto Rico, Brazil and Saudi Arabia.
Expenses also were paid for seven trips inside the United States.
   While 1988 was a story of income enhanced for many House
members, some did less well.
   Rep. Barton Jennings Gordon, D-Tenn., lost nearly $68,000 when
his investment in a trust fell from 118,355 to $50,461. ``A
partnership trust that he was in went bankrupt,'' said spokesman
Harrison Wadsworth.
   The disclosure forms call for listing gifts valued at $100 or
more.
   Rep. Andrew Jacobs, D-Ind., listed as gifts ``zero things and
zero money.''
   Among Jacobs' assets: A Great Dane, ``Friend,'' housebroken and
listed as priceless and a cocker spaniel, ``Annie,'' not completely
housebroken and listed as a current liability.

   The honoraria system that narrowly avoided
extinction earlier this year cranked out nearly $5.9 million in
1988 for House members who wrote articles and gave speeches to
special-interest groups.
   The honoraria figures, compiled by the public interest group
Common Cause, came from the annual House financial disclosure
statements that were released Monday.
   The final honoraria figures for the year could surpass the 1987
total of $6.7 million once financial disclosure forms are received
from an additional 20 lawmakers who were granted extensions of up
to 30 days in which to file their reports. The reports not yet
available included that of House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., the 1987 honoraria leader with $245,000.
   The annual disclosure forms filed by all 535 members of Congress
provide a look at members' wealth and outside income. Each form
lists a member's money received, assets and liabilities. The Senate
reports were released last Friday.
   Rank-and-file House members were allowed to keep $26,850 in
honoraria in 1988 _ leaders slightly more. The amount over the
limit, more than $1 million, was donated to charity while nearly
$4.8 million was kept for personal use.
   Most lawmakers also supplemented their $89,500 salaries with
investments, while others made money in more unorthodox ways.
   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., a Northern Cheyenne
Indian, earned $5,000 last year for his jewelry designs.
   Rep. Tom McMillen, D-Md., a former National Basketball
Association player, received deferred income totaling $45,000 from
the Washington Bullets and Atlanta Hawks.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, facing House ethics committee charges
of 69 rules violations, reported income between $188,183 and
$203,579 and assets ranging from $31,005-$100,000. These figures do
not include holdings in a blind trust established by Wright in
1987. Those assets and the income they produced were not available
Monday.
   The speaker earned $30,000 in honoraria, a figure eclipsed by 45
other House members who filed on Monday.
   Wright paid off debts totaling between $105,000 and $220,000,
including money he owed to his former investment partnership,
Mallightco, and a bank.
   The special counsel to the ethics committee said Wright
satisfied these notes with money he made from his share of an oil
and gas investment that is still under investigation by the panel.
   Not everything was revealed by House members.
   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., noted that the ethics committee
waived the reporting of wedding gifts in a letter dated Dec. 16,
1988. Spence, a widower, got married last July 3 in a hospital room
while recovering from a double lug transplant.
   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who said his
assets are no more than $45,000, did not list any royalties in 1988
from his book, ``Window of Opportunity.''
   A complaint is pending before the House ethics committee in
connection with a limited partnership formed in 1984 to promote the
book.
   The honoraria system was in jeopardy early this year, when House
leaders were ready to abolish it and institute other reforms in
return for a 51 percent pay raise. The effort collapsed when a
furious public let lawmakers know they opposed the increase.
   The fees of $2,000 a speech are controversial because
invitations usually come from special-interest groups courting
lawmakers, and because often the events are held at resorts where
members and their spouses can enjoy free vacations.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, earned the most honoraria of those who filed,
$114,376. Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., chairman of the House Democratic
Caucus, was second with $110,788. House Majority Whip Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., was third with $90,100.
   The disclosure statements showed members like to travel.
Gingrich's expenses were reimbursed on 11 trips for speeches to
various groups. GOPAC, a political action committee chaired by
Gingrich which promotes Republican candidates, paid the expenses on
14 trips by Gingrich and three by his wife.
   House Republican leader Bob Michel of Illinois listed some of
the side benefits of taking part in charity golf tournaments: $966
worth of golf clothing and paraphernalia from the Bob Hope Desert
Classic, the Kemper Open, the Jerry Ford Invitational and others.
   Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, reported $20,021 in residual income
from ``The Love Boat,'' the long-running television series in which
he played Gopher.
   Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., reported $11,212 in residuals for his
appearances on the ``Dukes of Hazzard.''
   Although some members do provide specific figures, the forms do
not require such precise data. Generally, wealth can be listed
according to broad ranges.
   For example, properties worth $52,000 and $98,000 could both be
listed in the $50,001-to-$100,000 range. An asset worth millions
could be listed simply as more than $250,000 unless a member chose
to spell it out.

   The Iran-Contra book that Majority Leader
George J. Mitchell wrote with a fellow senator brought him $22,500
in royalties last year, but he remained one of the Senate's least
wealthy members.
   Mitchells annual financial disclosure form, among the 100 filed
by all senators and released today, showed that making speeches was
more lucrative than helping write a book. Mitchell, D-Maine, earned
$42,500 in speeches, above the limit, but gave $8,000 of that to
charity, which brought him into compliance.
   His co-author on the book ``Men of Zeal'' _ fellow Maine senator
William Cohen, a Republican _ reported that he received $25,763,
and that included royalties from a a spy novel he co-wrote years
ago with former Sen. Gary Hart, D-Colo.
   The annual disclosure forms of income in 1988, showed that in
many cases the chief providers of speaking fees and free trips were
the groups interested in legislation before the committees on which
the senator sits.
   For instance, Wyche Fowler of Georgia, a Democrat on the
Agriculture Committee, earned $28,000 for speeches and $16,000 came
from agriculture, food, beverage and tobacco interests. Bennett
Johnson of Louisiana received $10,000 from energy groups. He sits
on the Energy Committee.
   But speaking fees weren't the only pluses for being a senator.
Trips figure largely in many senators' lives. Among many that
Johnston listed was one to Alaska, paid for in part by Alaskan Oil
and Gas and Conoco.
   Both Oregon senators, Republicans Bob Packwood and Mark
Hatfield, accepted free trips to the Far East with their wives,
from different sources. Thomas Daschle, D-S.C., took four
expense-paid trips with his wife that included Puerto Rico and the
Kentucky Derby.
   Albert Gore of Tennessee, a presidential candidate in 1988,
received a round trip for himself and his wife to Acapulco, Mexico,
paid for by the Lomas Financial Group of Dallas. Gore listed
$26,800 in honoraria; $16,000 of that came from food, beverage and
tobacco groups.
   Even the richest among the senators accepted speaking fees. In
the case of John Heinz of Pennsyvlania, a Republican whose pickle
and ketchup fortune is between $11.3 million to $13.6 million and
more, all $10,000 in honoraria went to food banks.
   Some surprising facts came to light with the disclosure forms.
Slade Gorton of Washington, a Republican restored to the Senate
after a two-year absence, owned stock in the Exxon Corp. He has
been an outspoken critic of the oil giant's handling of the Alaska
oil spill.
   The Mitchell-Cohen book, subtitled ``A Candid Inside Story of
the Iran-Contra Hearings,'' focuses on the joint House-Senate
committee hearings that played to a television audience of millions
in the summer of 1987.
   In a Senate noted for its millionaire members, Mitchell is one
of the paupers. He lists assets of less than $16,000.
   The disclosure forms list assets and liabilities only in ranges.
   Mitchell's counterpart, Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas,
earned $116,090 to $132,272, of which $99,500 was his Senate
salary. He made $36,000 for speeches but he gave $31,750 of that to
charity.
   The two Senate leaders earn $10,000 a year more in salary than
the other senators but they, too, may keep honoraria equaling only
40 percent of salary. That amount is $35,800 in the case of all but
Robert Byrd, D-Va., who was last year's majority leader, and Dole.
   Each senator must list the source of honoraria. Dole's breakdown
showed $6,000 from groups interested in finance, $10,000 from
health groups, $4,000 from transportation groups. He reported his
assets between $292,295 and $691,277 and no liabilities.
   Dole said he received gifts worth nearly $5,000, including a set
of lithographs portraying the heritage and history of Armenian life
and a crystal magnolia for his wife, Elizabeth, who is now
President Bush's labor secretary.
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sam Nunn of
Georgia, reported receiving $46,950 from speech-making and he gave
$11,686 to charity, to get under the limit. Of the honoraria,
$10,000 was from the defense industry, with which his committee
deals.
   The disclosure form shows Nunn, a Democrat, is probably a
millionaire. He lists his assets in the range of $942,015 to
$1,195,000 plus.
   The usual list of the richest senators got a new member in 1989,
Sen. Herbert Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat. Kohl, who owns the
Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association, listed
assets in the range of $19.4 million to $27.7 million or more.
   After his election last November, his investments were
transferred to a blind trust.
   The other senators with big bucks include those with the
best-known names, John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., an heir to the
vast oil fortune; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Heinz.
   John C. Danforth, R-Mo., grandson of the man who founded the
Ralston-Purina company, listed assets of $7.8 million to $13
million or more and returned to the list, as did William Armstrong,
R-Colo., and Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill. Not returning is Lowell Weicker,
R-Conn., who was defeated for re-election.
   The disclosure rules ask each senator to declare assets,
liabilities, earned and unearned income; amounts given to charity
and money received for speeches and articles _ called honoraria.
Contributions to charity usually represent money the senator has to
give away because of limits.
   Assets include anything of value such as real estate, stocks,
bonds, and trust _ but not the senator's home or property owned
solely by the senator's spouse and children.

   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley received $32,000
in speaking fees last year, according to House financial disclosure
forms made public today.
   Foley, D-Wash., donated $5,000 of the honoraria to charity. In
1988, when he was House majority leader, Foley accepted $34,750 in
speaking fees.
   Foley also got a healthy boost in salary when he was elected
House speaker to succeed Rep. Jim Wright, D-Texas, a year ago after
Wright was forced to resign. Foley's salary _ half a year as
majority leader and half as speaker _ was $107,034. He also
reported receiving $26,462 on the sale of various stocks managed by
a blind trust.
   All House members were required to submit the financial
disclosure forms, which listed assets and liabilities as well as
income from salaries and outside sources and gifts. Senate
financial disclosure forms will be made public Wednesday.
   The House Democratic leadership last year underwent a traumatic
shift as a result of the resignations of Wright and Rep. Tony
Coelho, D-Calif., both of whom were caught up in allegations of
financial irregularities.
   But the scandals that brought about the leadership changes
prompted no differences in attitudes toward accepting speaking fees
from various groups.
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, catapulted into the majority
leader's post last year, accepted $34,500 in honoraria and donated
$7,500 to charity.
   But the speaking fees accepted by Foley and Gephardt were
dwarfed by their leadership colleague, Rep. William H. Gray III of
Pennsylvania, the assistant majority leader. Gray received $164,098
in speaking fees and gave $139,098 to charity.
   House members are allowed to keep honoraria totalling up to 30
percent of their congressional salaries. The base salary for House
members was $89,500.
   Not all benefits that went to House members came from their
speaking ability.
   Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., received $14,000 in
income from designing jewelry, most of it for people in Colorado.
   Rep. Les Aspin. D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, can see all the baseball games he wants. He received an
American League baseball pass from Bud Selig, owner of the
Milwaukee Brewers and a National League pass from the late A.
Bartlett Giamatti, who was National League commissioner at the time.
   Among Republican leaders, Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the
assistant minority leader, saw his speaking rise sharply from a
total of $28,550 in 1988, to $67,491 last year.
   Gingrich, who came under criticism last year for the royalty
arrangement on a book he wrote, gave $40,704 of his honoraria to
charity _ $29,304 of that to the Atlanta Zoo.
   Minority leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., received $49,300 in speaking
fees and donated $21,540 to charity.
   As usual, Michel, an avid golfer, listed items received from his
participation in various charity tournaments, including shoes, golf
balls, jackets and shirts.
   The categories for assets and liabilities were in ranges that
made it impossible to precisely calculate the wealth of some
members.
   For example, Amory Houghton Jr., a New York Republican who is an
heir to the Corning Glass Works fortune, listed his assets as a
range from at least $5,046,937 to more than $7,460,000. But there
was no way of estimating how much more than the second figure
Houghton was worth.
   Rep. Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of the House Ethics
Committee, included the income and holdings of his wife, Betty, in
his form.
   Mrs. Dixon's dividend income was listed as exceeding $100,000 in
1989. It came from her interest in Mir Kanon@Peideau, an airport
stores partnership. And the value of her stock was listed as
exceeding $250,000.
   According to previous financial disclosure forms, Dixon's wife
invested between $5,000 and $15,000 in the partnership in 1986.
Last year, Dixon listed the value of his wife's investment in the
partnership at between $100,000 and $250,000.
   As usual, Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., was one of the
leaders in speaking fees.
   Schroeder reported accepting honoraria on 72 occasions in 1989
for speeches, writings and television appearances. She reported
keeping $26,313 of her total honoraria, $500 less than the maximum
allowed.

   Sen. David Durenberger, already the subject of
an ethics probe, said Wednesday he failed to report an earlier gift
and loan, while Senate colleagues disclosed they talked, wrote,
invested and even fiddled to raise their incomes last year.
   Durenberger, R-Minn., amended his financial reports for five
years to acknowledge a friend's gift of 35 days of lodging in
Florida and a $484,000 loan to buy a house. He is being
investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee because of a $100,000
book-promotion deal that was not listed on past disclosure reports.
   The figures on income, speaking fees and gifts for senators were
included in financial disclosure reports that were made public on
Wednesday.
   Although there is growing concern about the practice of
accepting fees for speaking to special interests, a compilation by
the Common Cause lobbying organization showed 74 senators spoke for
pay last year. By next year, the report said, 34 senators will no
longer keep such fees, compared with 19 in 1988.
   The 74 collected $2.7 million, donated $685,449 to charity, and
kept the rest, Common Cause said.
   Although Democrats control the Senate, the top two Republicans
earned more in speaking fees in 1989. Republican Leader Bob Dole of
Kansas picked up $108,900 in honoraria; his deputy, Alan Simpson of
Wyoming, got $90,600. Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, senior Republican
on the Labor and Human Resources Committee, was paid $92,499 in
fees.
   Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, was paid $39,000 for
speeches, but his deputy, Alan Cranston, D-Calif., no longer
accepts honoraria.
   One of the wealthiest senators, John Heinz, R-Pa., whose family
started the food company, reported assets that could exceed $17
million; his income for the year may have topped $2.5 million. Sen.
John C. Danforth, R-Mo., whose family founded Ralston Purina,
disclosed holdings that could be in the $15-million range.
   Sen. Claiborne, Pell, D-R.I., may have made $2.8 million or more
last year; his assets were in the $8 million range. Also among the
richer senators are Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., whose assets are
hidden in a trust; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., with vast real estate
holdings, and Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., owner of the Milwaukee Bucks
basketball team. Kohl's 1989 income could have topped $20 million.
   On the other hand, Sens. Jim Jeffords, R-Vt., and Conrad Burns,
R-Mont., could be on the brink of insolvency, with more liabilities
than assets. Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., reported little in
the way of assets except his home, and liabilities that include
loans to pay for a son's college education.
   The law requires most high-level federal officials to report
annually on their assets, liabilities, financial transactions and
gifts received. House members' reports were made public Tuesday;
all but a few senators, who were granted 30-day extensions, made
their reports Wednesday.
   Because the forms are so vague, it is impossible in most cases
to discern an official's true financial status. For example, a $10
million piece of real estate may be listed on the forms as worth
``over $250,000.'' Some senators had dozens of holdings valued at
that level.
   Durenberger's troubles with the Ethics Committee are traceable
in part to his failure to disclose some transactions as required by
law. His office said Wednesday that the Florida lodging was
inadvertently left off a past form and that the loan was omitted by
someone who didn't understand the form.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., included in his income $120.80 in
royalties on a record of fiddle music he recorded several years
ago. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., reported $167 royalties
on two past books and a $5,000 advance for another he is writing
for Harvard University Press.
   Mitchell and his Republican colleague from Maine, William Cohen,
shared royalties from a book they wrote after serving on the
committee that investigated the Iran-contra scandal.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, received $5,058 in royalties for a
tape cassette in the ``Living Scriptures'' series.
   Simpson listed $40,000 he was paid for debating Kennedy in the
Mutual Radio series, ``Face Off.'' Kennedy's report did not include
his share.
   Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the Senate Energy
Committee, received about $3,000 of royalties on oil and gas
investments. Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., shares with his wife a blind
trust valued at more than $250,000, which generated as much s
$50,000 income last year.
   In 1989, most senators were paid at the annual rate of $89,500;
leaders earned $99,500. Senators could keep honoraria equivalent to
40 percent of their salaries and give the rest to charity.
   House members voted to give up their honoraria starting next
year in exchange for higher government salaries, but senators
insisted on keeping those fees and taking a smaller check from the
treasury.
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., a first-term senator who chairs the
Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, picked up $53,000 for
speaking and gave $17,200 of it to charity. Biden, who heads the
Judiciary Committee, was paid $35,548 in honoraria and kept it all.
   This year's figures on speaking fees may not tell the whole
story. Instead of accepting checks and turning them over to
charity, some senators have begun instructing groups they address
to write the check directly to a designated charity. Dole and Sen.
Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, acknowledged doing this in some cases.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., accepted a long list of gifts,
including a lamp stand (value unknown) from the president of
Malawi. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., accepted four Washington Redskins
season tickets. Freshman Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., received
several months of free lodging before his family joined him in
Washington.
   Political leanings are not forgotten in the financial reports.
Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., pointedly noted a fund in which she
invests has no holdings in South Africa.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., turned over $25 of his honorarium to
``Pompous Twits Anonymous,'' a home-state charity that helps the
needy while tweaking public figures for their outlandish statements.

   House members last year took trips to such
faraway places as Cyprus and Ireland and as near as the Oprah
Winfrey Show in Chicago. They made speeches, toured defense plants
and wrote magazine articles. They got gifts of golf sweaters and
boxes of chocolates.
   These and thousands of other details were listed in the latest
round of financial disclosure forms filed by more than 400 members
of the House of Representatives and released on Wednesday.
   In general, members' incomes towered over the average
American's. Most representatives' incomes topped the $100,000 mark
last year, with fees from speech-making and article-writing adding
substantially to their $89,500 annual salary. A handful reported
making under $100,000, while more than a dozen reported assets and
income over $1 million.
   The median family income in the United States is $31,526.
   The forms also offered a glimpse into the workings of Congress.
   For example:
   _Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, a member of the Appropriations
defense subcommittee, reported receiving money for speeches from
several defense companies, including Lockheed, Boeing, Rockwell,
Northrop, TRW, Aerojet, General Electric, LTV, Singer and McDonnell
Douglas.
   _Pennsylvania Rep. Bud Shuster, the second-ranking Republican on
the House Public Works and Transportation Committee and the senior
GOP member of the surface transportation subcommittee, reported
receiving air fare from the Outdoor Advertising Association for a
trip to Los Angeles. The association also paid him a $2,000
honorarium for a speech.
   In 1986, Shuster led a fight on the House floor against taking
down billboards on the nation's highways without ``just
compensation'' to the owner. The administrative aide to Shuster,
Ann Eppard, said Wednesday that Shuster was not so much defending
the outdoor advertising industry as the right to compensation if
one's property is seized.
   _Rep. E. ``Kika'' de la Garza, chairman of the House Agriculture
Committee, received honoraria from a number of food and textile
groups, including the National Milk Producers, Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, Amstar Sugar Corp., Grocery Manufacturers, Western Cotton
Shippers, Monsanto, National Cotton Council and the American Farm
Bureau Federation. His reimbursed travel included a limousine ride
to White Sulphur Springs, W.Va., to attend a Grocery Manufacturers
meeting.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, reported earnings of at least
$168,000, although that did not include royalties from his book.
Published reports have said that Wright was paid royalties of 55
percent from his book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' far above
the 10 percent to 15 percent authors normally receive.
   The royalties are crucial to a demand for an ethics committee
investigation of the Democratic leader.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich promised to sign the documents formally
triggering such an investigation today. For his part, the Georgia
Republican reported income of $122,284 to $133,283.
   Wright promised on Wednesday to cooperate in any investigation.
   ``Although I know my actions have been in full accordance with
House rules, I am concerned that the matters raised ... have led to
increased public discussion, which I believe is unwarranted ...,''
he said in a letter Tuesday to the ethics committee.
   The Texas Democrat also said that publication of the book had
been halted at his orders.
   While the politicians are required to reveal their finances, the
forms give only broad ranges for members' income, assets and debts.
   For example, one of the wealthier members of the House, Rep.
Bill Green, reported income of at least $1.5 million and probably
more than $3.3 million. The New York Republican listed assets of at
least $3.9 million and probably more than $9.2 million.
   Other wealthy House members and their minimum assets included
Norman Sisisky, D-Va., $8.27 million; Amory Houghton Jr., R-N.Y.,
$5.05 million; Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., $2.2 million; Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif., $3.6 million; Don Edwards, D-Calif., $1.65
million; Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., $1 million; Pat Swindall, R-Ga.,
$2.265 million; Sidney Yates, D-Ill., $1.565 million; Fortney
Stark, D-Calif., $3.2 million; E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., $1.16 million;
and Mel Levine, D-Calif. $1.065 million.
   Many of these members reported liabilities, but all of them
appeared to have net worths of at least $1 million.
   While millions of dollars were revealed in the reports, so were
minuscule details.
   Among the exceptions to $100,000-plus incomes were: David
Bonior, D-Mich.; Tim Penny, D-Minn.; William Natcher, D-Ky.;
Clarence Miller, R-Ohio; Bob Dornan, R-Calif.; Julian Dixon,
D-Calif.; and Sherwood Boehlert, R-N.Y.
   Alex McMillan, R-N.C., reported a long list of gifts, ranging
from three boxes of chocolates and five neckties to a copy of the
September 1987 National Geographic magazine.
   Several House members apparently are avid golfers. They reported
receiving travel reimbursements for attending golf tournaments and
gifts of golf clothing and equipment. Among them was Rep. Fernand
St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the House Banking Committee, who
got more than $1,200 in golf shoes, sweaters and accessories from
four charity golf tournaments.
   The trips by House members ranged from the appearance in Chicago
on the Oprah Winfrey Show by Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo. Mrs.
Schroeder also reported receiving two round-trip fares to Dublin,
Ireland. Rep. Peter H. Kostmayer, D-Pa., meanwhile, took an
educational trip to Greece and Cyprus financed by the Trade and
Tourism Alliance last July.
   Wright's disclosure form showed his income to be from $168,311
to $176,808. His salary as speaker was $115,000. His assets were
from $155,000 to $435,000 and his liabilities ranged from $105,000
to $220,000. He transferred investments valued from $140,000 to
$385,000 to a qualified blind trust last year.
   He received $45,850 in honoraria, donating $13,000 to charity.
   Other House leaders also reported substantial incomes.
