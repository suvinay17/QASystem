<HEAD>Titanic Inquiry after 78 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An inquiry will be held into the conduct of a
steamship captain who was criticized for not coming to the aid of
the Titanic when it sank 78 years ago, the government said Monday.
   The Titanic sank after striking an iceberg in the North Atlantic
on April 14, 1912. More than 1,500 of the 2,200 people aboard the
ship perished.
   The Marine Accident Investigation Branch will examine testimony
at the 1912 inquiry into the loss of the great liner to throw light
on the role of the late Capt. Stanley Lord, said a Department of
Transport spokeswoman.
   The inquiry comes in response to a campaign by Lord's relatives,
who have been trying to clear his name, said the spokeswoman. She
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The inquiry was first reported in Monday's editions of The Daily
Telegraph, which said a crucial piece of evidence would be the
position of the wreck as determined in 1985 by U.S. oceanographer
Robert Ballard.
   Lord was master of the Boston-bound Californian, believed to
have been the ship nearest to the Titanic when it struck the
iceberg.
   The Carpathia and other ships which were farther away than the
Californian did reach the scene in answer to the stricken liner's
distress calls.
   Lord's ship was stopped by ice at the time. The original inquiry
censured him for not responding to distress rockets from the
Titanic and ruled that as he was 8 to 10 miles from the liner he
could have gone to its aid and saved lives.
   Lord died in 1962, claiming to the end that the Titanic was in
an icefield 20 miles or more from his ship and that he was unable
to help. A campaign to clear his name has been carried on by his
son and other supporters, and an earlier petition to reopen the
inquiry was rejected in 1965.
   Lord insisted that a ship seen from the Californian was not the
Titanic. The ship was only identified in 1962 as the Samson, a
seal-hunter.
   ``Supporters of Capt. Lord claimed he was a scapegoat for the
failire of the Titanic's owners and the Board of Trade to make sure
there were enough lifeboats,'' The Daily Telegraph said.
   It quoted Capt. James de Coverley, deputy chief of marine
accidents, as saying the 1912 inquiry would not be reopened as that
had been into the Titanic's loss, not Lord's conduct.
   ``We are not in the business of rewriting history but in this
particular case it was considered desirable to have a
re-evaluation,'' de Coverley was quoted as saying.

   Maritime Mystery:
   What Ship Watched
   As the Titanic Sank?

   Britain Refloats the Question
   Of S.S. Californian's Role;
   A Quest for Exoneration

   On the cold, clear night in 1912 that the RMS Titanic
struck ice and sank into history, a heinous crime occurred.
   As the icy Atlantic gushed in through the great liner's
hull, passengers and crew spied a flicker of hope. On the
horizon, the lights of another ship appeared. They signaled
to it, firing rockets high into the sky. But the ship didn't
respond. In fact, "it seemed as if the vessel was turning
around and leaving us," a survivor recalled.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The mystery ship steamed off, abandoning about 1,500
people to drown in the chill black sea; 705 survived.
   Thus began one of maritime history's great whodunits --
and one that has suddenly inspired new investigations in
Liverpool, England. What ship was it? And why, as a U.S.
Senate committee of the day put it, did it disregard "the
dictates of humanity, international usage, and the
requirements of law?" Armed with new evidence, the British
government has reopened its Titanic files and named a special
examiner to plumb this 79-year-old mystery. "This is a unique
investigation," says a government spokesman.
   At issue is the guilt or innocence of Stanley Lord, the
English sea captain whose cargo ship, the S.S. Californian,
was accused of being the mystery vessel. Capt. Lord was
napping in his chartroom that fateful night, while junior
officers were said to have dithered on the bridge. He denied
it, but went to his grave in 1962 portrayed as the monster
who slept while hundreds drowned.
   "Reprehensible and un-British," was how one London
magazine damned his conduct. His supporters, on the other
hand, view him as a scapegoat. They say he was blamed to
divert public outrage from the real reason so many died that
night: lax safety regulations that enabled the Titanic to
scrimp on lifeboats.
   Indeed, Capt. Lord's culpability is again being
challenged, and he may soon have his reputation restored. If
the British examiner exonerates him, a parallel campaign
could gather steam in Washington to correct the record there.
The grand aim, says Leslie Harrison, the captain's former
union leader and chief defender, is to correct "the grossest
miscarriage of justice" in British seafaring history.
   The prospect has the small world of Titanic scholarship in
a maelstrom. For 30 years, a tiny -- and now very aged --
crew of British and U.S. history buffs has debated the late
captain's case. Like a schismatic church, they are split into
Lordites and anti-Lordites. The Lordites say the Californian
wasn't the mystery vessel. Bilge, say the anti-Lordites. The
two sides trade jibes in such journals as "The Titanic
Commutator," a quarterly publication of the U.S.-based
Titanic Historical Society.
   "Passions are high. I have spent more time working on this
one issue than any other" about the Titanic, says Walter
Lord, author of the 1950s best-seller about the sinking, "A
Night to Remember." Confusingly, Mr. Lord, now 73, is an
anti-Lordite. He is also "no relation of ours, thank
goodness," says Stanley T. Lord, who is a Lordite and the
captain's 83-year-old son.
   Steering the course for the Lordite faction is Mr.
Harrison, who has been Capt. Lord's tireless defender since
1958. That year, Mr. Harrison recalls, a tall, elderly
captain appeared in his Liverpool office one day and declared
with authority: "I'm Lord of the Californian." The name meant
nothing to Mr. Harrison, then a clerkish young idealist who
had spent much of his own brief sea career leaning greenly
over the rail. But the captain explained: A new British
movie, "A Night to Remember," based on the book, was
dramatizing the charges against him and he wanted his union's
help to defend his name.
   Since then, muses the now-elderly union leader -- he is 78
and retired to a cottage overlooking the sea -- "my life has
been one of constant battles with people."
   In trying to prove the captain's innocence, Mr. Harrison
scoured musty archives, tape-recorded hours of conversation
with the captain and took affidavits from Titanic witnesses.
He badgered British politicians for a rehearing. To publicize
the case, he spent four years writing a book on it -- and 10
years trying to get it published. When it finally appeared in
1986, it sold 1,720 copies. He even quarreled with his own
union colleagues, some of whom urged him to drop the case as
hopeless.
   He refused. "My approach to life is scrupulous honesty,"
Mr. Harrison says, struggling to explain his persistence. "So
long as there's this absolutely gross slander on his name,
I've got to do what I told him I'd do: Not drop the case."
   According to Mr. Harrison's book, "A Titanic Myth: The
Californian Incident," Capt. Lord had prudently stopped his
ship that night in mid-Atlantic upon encountering a vast ice
field -- the same field into which the Titanic was then
heedlessly steaming. On the horizon, he spied a ship that he
took to be a tramp steamer, but which a junior officer
thought resembled an ocean liner. Capt. Lord signaled to it,
but it didn't respond. So with everything quiet, he left the
bridge after midnight for a four-hour nap on the chartroom
settee.
   As the mariner slumbered, the sea brought strange sights.
"I observed a flash of light in the sky," the officer on
watch said later. It was a white rocket -- possibly a
distress signal -- and it rose near the unidentified vessel.
Seven more rockets followed. After conferring by speaker-tube
with the sleepy captain, the bridge tried signaling the ship
again; still it didn't respond. Then it disappeared --
steamed away, the officer on watch said; sank, U.S. and
British inquests said.
   The next morning, the Californian's wireless operator
learned of the Titanic's sinking from other passing ships.
"Where have you been all night?" one ship asked. "Been
asleep?"
   The questions came to torment Capt. Lord. After landing at
Boston, his ship was named by a U.S. Senate committee and by
a British inquest as being the vessel seen from the Titanic.
Cowardice was the crime: He and his officers were accused of
ignoring the distress rockets in order to avoid a risky
nighttime rescue through an ice field. Capt. Lord denied
this; but he was disgraced -- a scapegoat, Lordites say,
referring to the alleged cover-up of the Titanic's lack of
lifeboats.
   "They wanted to find somebody to blame, and they pounced
on father," says his son.
   Even so, Capt. Lord continued to get commands, thanks to
his reputation among shipowners as a skillfull and safe
captain.
   The chief Lordite theory is that -- far from seeing each
other that night -- the Californian and Titanic were watching
a third, unidentified vessel steaming between them. One
suspect is a seal ship called the Samson, said to have been
hunting illegally in the area. It supposedly mistook the
Titanic's lights and rockets for a U.S. Coast Guard patrol
and fled. But anti-Lordites contend there is little evidence
to support that -- and even if there was a third ship, the
Californian's officers were still negligent in failing to
investigate the rockets.
   This dispute percolated until 1985, when new evidence
emerged. Deep beneath the North Atlantic, an American team of
oceanographers discovered the Titanic's final resting place,
several hundred miles off Newfoundland. The spot was close to
where Capt. Lord had always claimed it would be -- a fact,
Lordites argue, that corroborates a key claim in his defense:
That the Titanic and Californian were too far apart to have
seen each other that night.
   But anti-Lordites still dispute that reasoning. They say
locating the wreck of the Titanic says nothing about the
location of the Californian. The British government, however,
took the new theory seriously enough to reopen the case. The
fate of Capt. Lord's reputation is now with a special
examiner, Capt. Thomas Barnett, a retired government marine
surveyor.
   Whatever happened that night, Capt. Lord himself wasn't
without regrets. Rather than rely on the watch, he wished
that he had risen from his couch to inspect the situation on
the bridge himself. The result, he once told Mr. Harrison,
was "there's always this stigma: Was Lord to blame, or was he
not to blame?"

FT  04 APR 92 / The Titanic's tales of terror: Alexander Garrett on a famous
maritime disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER GARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE afternoon of the April 15 1912, Bruce Ismay, managing director of the
White Star Line, filled out a Marconi telegram form for company headquarters
in New York. 'Deeply regret to advise you Titanic sank this morning 15th
after collision iceberg resulting serious loss life,' he wrote. 'Further
particulars later.'
Ismay was aboard the rescue ship Carpathia, one of 705 survivors - 1,516
perished. But his message remained unsent until 5.50 am on the 17th, nearly
two days later. The wireless telegraph was Carpathia's only contact with the
world, and as its operator worked round the clock to send out messages from
survivors, the signal from the White Star managing director - confirming
what the world already feared - was overlooked.
Today, a vessel involved in a collision would be in contact with coastguard
authorities within seconds. Then, the delay caused enormous uncertainty,
provoked accusations of censorship, and added one more mystery to the
intrigue surrounding the disaster.
On Tuesday April 14, Ismay's communique is one of 448 radio signal messages
relating to the Titanic to be sold at Christie's in South Kensington,
London. Together they provide a poignant chronicle of events in the world's
most famous maritime disaster, 80 years ago this week. The collection is
being sold by John Booth, who has exhibited them at the Titanic Signals
Archive for the last three years.
That these signals survived is remarkable. At the time the Titanic went
down, telegraph companies kept originals of all transmitted signals for 12
months. Messages from ships involved in the Titanic disaster were assembled
for the two public inquiries, one in the US, the other in London. After
that, they were returned to the Marconi company where they were held in a
vault until the late 1940s.
When Cable and Wireless took over the Eastern Telegraph Company - as it had
by then become - the signals were earmarked for destruction, but they were
salvaged by an unnamed employee, whose son found them hidden in a suitcase
when his father died 30 years later. Booth later acquired the signals. He is
selling them now, he says, 'because my wife says they take up too much of my
time'.
Before the wireless was invented by Guglielmo Marconi in 1896, ships
communicated with each other by flags and light signals.
But when the Titanic set sail from Southampton on Wednesday April 10 1912,
she had the most powerful wireless yet fitted. She was one of the first
liners to have two wireless operators - John Phillips and Harold Bride, both
employed by Marconi - who could together provide a round-the-clock radio
watch.
Early in the voyage, they were busy telegraphing arrangements for passengers
to meet relatives in New York. It was a lucrative business for Marconi: each
message cost 30 shillings, at a time when the second wireless operator
earned 50 shillings a month.
It is the tone of optimism that is striking. One starts: 'Fine voyage fine
ship feeling fine'. Another: 'Hardly wait to get back. Cable made me awfully
happy. Love Mutzie'
One, however, was more ominous. 'Westbound steamers report bergs growlers
and field ice in 42 N from 49 to 51 West. April 12th Compts Barr'
On April 12, the Touraine radioed to report 'dense fog and thick icefields'.
Further danger signals followed from the Californian and the Caronia. One of
the great unresolved questions of the disaster is why the Titanic's captain
continued to sail towards the danger zone at 22 knots, especially as Harold
Bride, the Titanic's surviving wireless operator, told the US inquiry that
he had passed on the message from the Californian, and it had been
'personally acknowledged' by Captain Smith.
Later that day a fateful message was sent: 'Sinking wants immediate
assistance'.
The shortcomings of the wireless - as then operated - become evident
immediately following the collision with the iceberg. Unlike the Titanic,
most of the ships that night had only one radio man, if any.
Thomas Cottam, sole operator on the Carpathia, should have finished duty at
midnight. At 12.30 he was about to retire when the first distress signal
came through. The Carpathia sailed to the Titanic's aid at full speed, but
it was 60 miles away, three and a half hours sailing. Another ship, the
Californian, was (by its own controversial account) only 19 miles away, but
its wireless operator, Cyril Evans, had gone to bed. A third vessel, the
Norwegian trawler Samson, may have been even closer, but had no radio.
Marconi was later asked why his apparatus did not have a bell to wake the
operator. He replied: 'On the old equipment used by ships there was a bell
arrangement, which did not work well because it alarmed the operators of all
ships, as well as the one called.'
'Titanic struck iceberg sunk Monday 3 am. Carpathia picked up many
passengers am proceeding New York. Captain Rostron.'
The signals flying through the airwaves created total confusion for the
press. In New York, The Evening Sun trumpeted 'All saved from Titanic after
collision.' The following morning in London, the account in The Times was
riddled with contradiction. After reporting that the Titanic had sunk with
'great loss of life,' it cited later that she was being towed by The
Virginian to Halifax, or was heading under her own steam to New York.
By the following day, April 17, the full extent of the tragedy had become
clear and the recriminations began. The Times scolded the Central News
Agency over a phantom wireless message which had reported everybody safe;
while questions were asked about signals being 'interfered' with by 'amateur
operators'.
An explanation for one of the 'phantom' signals later materialised. A radio
ham unwittingly merged two signals, one asking 'Are all Titanic passengers
safe?' and another from the Asian announcing she was towing the German
tanker Deutschland to Halifax. The result: 'Titanic passengers safe being
towed to Halifax.'
Before the Titanic went down, its two radio operators were given permission
to leave their posts. Bride was washed overboard, but was picked up by the
Carpathia. As the Carpathia headed back to New York, he assisted Cottam in
sending messages from survivors. A few remained cheerful, as: 'Meet me dock
with two hundred dollars underwear cap big coat. Am well but feet slightly
frozen answer George.' Others were tragic: 'Mother girls safe father Charlie
missing'. 'Father not seen no hope arrive Carpathia Wednesday New York.
Richard.'
The US inquiry made a number of recommendations about the use of
radiotelegraphy on ships. But although the Titanic sinking had highlighted
its shortcomings, the momentous significance of radio communication for
sea-going vessels was elegiacally summed up in a Times editorial on April
16:
'But for wireless telegraphy, the disaster might have assumed proportions
which at present we cannot measure; and we should have known nothing of its
occurence for an indefinite period . . . The advantages conferred by this
abridgment of space are enormous. No vessel need be alone, none need vanish
without a sign from human ken; and in none but crushing and instant
disasters need any despair of help.'

   In regard to your Feb. 21 page-one article about the new
investigation into the Titanic disaster: I wrote a
college-term paper on the subject 37 years ago. According to
my research then, Capt. Stanley Lord ordered his wireless
operator to contact the Titanic and advise it that he had
stopped his ship, the Californian, because of the iceberg
conditions. He was told by the Titanic's operator to "shut
up" because his current was interfering with its outgoing
commercial messages.
   In 1912, Marconi wireless operators did not maintain a
24-hour watch aboard transAtlantic vessels -- so, at 11:30
p.m., the Californian's operator removed his earphones and
went to bed.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   At 11:40 p.m., the Titanic struck the iceberg and shortly
thereafter began to fire off its white distress flares. Capt.
Lord, when informed of this, noted that it was probably just
the Titanic's passengers celebrating the maiden voyage of the
new luxury liner. He ordered his crew to attempt to
communicate with the Titanic by Morse light and returned to
his bed. Capt. Lord's men continued signaling with the light
until 1:30 a.m., but got no response from the Titanic. It has
been suggested that the Titanic's officers and crew were far
too busy loading their passengers onto lifeboats to have seen
the Californian's flashing signals. Several surviving
passengers later recalled seeing the lights, and some of them
said they rowed their lifeboats toward them.
   Following the investigations on both sides of the Atlantic
into the Titanic sinking, steamship companies were required
to keep a radio operator on duty round the clock.

north of Japan, said Josh McDowell of NOAA.;    The Navy's and National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's center in Suitland, Md., tracks sea
ice as a warning service for shipping, seeking to prevent disasters like that
of the British liner Titanic.;    The maximum extent of the ice reached nearly
to the latitude of Boston -- though far to the east -- before pulling back
this week, officials said.;    Normally, sea ice reaches its maximum in April
in the North Atlantic. Cold weather could lead to an extension of the ice
edge, McDowell cautioned.;    Detailed information on the extent of sea ice
goes back only to 1972, when satellites began tracking frozen areas.;   
During that period, McDowell said, growth of ice on one side of the planet has
been accompanied by a decline on the other side.;    Sea ice is a sheet of
frozen salt water several inches thick along its edge, McDowell explained.
Temperatures have to be about 29 degrees Fahrenheit to freeze seawater.;   
While the sea ice could damage a ship that was not specially strengthened, it
was not the cause of the Titanic's demise. That ship fell victim to a floating
iceberg. Icebergs are large chunks of ice that break away from land and float
south.;    More than 1,500 people died when the Titanic struck the floating
mass of ice and sank April 14, 1912, on its first Atlantic crossing.  </TEXT>

FT  26 NOV 94 / Thinking the unsinkable: The modern parallels exposed by an
exhibition about the Titanic, which sank in 1912
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a grim coincidence that the first comprehensive exhibition of
artefacts recovered from the Titanic opened at the National Maritime Museum
in Greenwich a few days after the sinking of the ferry Estonia.
The fascination surrounding the loss of the supposedly unsinkable Titanic,
on its maiden voyage, was overshadowed by the shock of the sinking of a
modern ferry at a cost of more than 900 lives. The Titanic went down after
it struck an iceberg off Newfoundland on April 14, 1912. Only 705 of the
2,228 passengers and crew survived.
Timing apart, historians and naval experts see other parallels between the
two doomed vessels. Both were designed and built to prevailing standards but
both were found wanting.
The Titanic was launched when the number of lifeboats carried reflected the
cubic footage of the vessel devoted to passenger accommodation rather than
the number of passengers and crew. Its designers added a 12 per cent safety
margin to the minimum required by the Board of Trade but there were still
only enough lifeboats for half those on board.
A more comprehensive sub-division of the Titanic by internal bulkheads - a
design issue which is again being hotly debated after the Estonia sinking in
October - might have saved the liner, some experts think.
For 73 years the Titanic lay undisturbed, up to two miles down on the floor
of the Atlantic Ocean. The prospect of ever finding the vessel and answering
the unsolved mysteries of its sinking appeared remote.
But in 1985 the wreck was discovered by a joint French-US expedition.
RMS Titanic Inc, a New York-based company, was declared 'salvor in
possession', meaning that it had unique rights to explore the vessel and
raise material.
The company has since carried out three expeditions, the most recent in
July, using a submersible provided by the French Oceanographic Research
Institute. It has raised a total of 3,600 artefacts.
RMS Titanic is committed to raising material from the Titanic and putting it
on general display. It is pledged not to sell any of its finds.
Some 150 objects are on display at the maritime museum, include a ship's
porthole, metal deck bench ends and a letter from a manufacturer lamenting
the demise of the feather boa as a fashion accessory.
Video footage taken from the submersible shows the ship's rail, chandeliers
hanging in a long-abandoned state room and racks of plates.
The chance to stage the exhibition was offered to the maritime museum 'out
of the blue' by RMS, says Dr Eric Kentley, a curator.
There are no plans to take the exhibition to any other museums around the
world though the maritime museum and RMS are working on designs to establish
a permanent museum to display the material.
The Japanese meanwhile, have announced plans to build a full-scale replica
of the Titanic to act as a floating hotel and conference centre. All the
details of its interior would be replicated although there would be no
engines or steering gear.
As the Titanic sank into the darkness of the Atlantic it broke its back and
landed in two separate sections. When it hit the ocean floor the bow section
ploughed into the mud, obscuring to this day the details of how large a gash
was caused by the iceberg.
'The technology exists to remove the silt from the bow section but the
problem is to find the capital to get the equipment down there,' says John
Eaton, a historian with an interest in the Titanic going back more than 45
years.
Recovery of material has been limited to the sea around the vessel. A
decision to treat its interior as a grave site has meant that no attempt has
been made to raise artefacts from inside the hull. Although very few
survivors of the sinking are still alive 'people are very sensitive about
anyone going into the hull', comments Dr Kentley. Eaton confesses to finding
this ban 'very frustrating'.
Although the intense cold, the absence of light and low oxygen levels on the
ocean bed have slowed the deterioration of the Titanic, chemical attack and
sea-bed bacteria have eaten into the metal, staining many objects black.
A comparison of the photographs taken in 1986, and those from a descent in
1993, show a marked deterioration of the wreck, says Eaton. Dr Kentley
thinks there may be as little as 10 years left to continue work on the hull
before it disintegrates.
RMS and its backers are keen to raise more material from the wreck. However,
even if a sudden deterioration was to halt work, enough has been raised to
create a powerful reminder of the fate of the Titanic, and any other vessel
and its crew which underestimate the power of the sea. The exhibition, says
Dr Kentley: 'Is a timely reminder that the sea signs no treaties.'
The Wreck of the Titanic. Until April 2, 1995.

<HEAD>Titanic Memorabilia Auctioned On 76th Anniversary Of Sinking</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A postcard mailed from the Titanic fetched $2,068
during an auction Friday, the 76th anniversary of the ocean liner's
sinking, but a water-stained letter found on the body of a dead
passenger went unsold.
   The auction of 200 items of Titanic memorabilia raised $56,400,
Onslow's Auctioneers reported.
   A spokesman said the water-stained letter didn't sell because it
may have been considered too ghoulish.
   One collector paid $2,068 for the postcard stamped on the ship
and posted when it stopped in Ireland.
   Northern Ireland's Ulster Folk and Transport Museum paid the
auction's top price of $14,100 for a 1912 watercolor painting
entitled ``Fitting Out The Titanic, Belfast.''
   The Titanic, built in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and declared
unsinkable, went down in the Atlantic on April 15, 1912, after
hitting an iceberg while on its maiden voyage from Southampton,
England, to New York. A total of 1,513 people perished.
   The wreck of the liner about 2.5 miles below the surface and 350
miles south of Newfoundland was first located by a U.S.-French
expedition in September 1985.

   MORE FRENCH GIVE UP WINE

   Most French people say they never drink wine, according to
a study by a French wine-industry organization.
   The nationwide survey of 4,000 people was conducted in
March and April by the National Interprofessional Office of
Wine. Participants were asked about the drinking habits of
all adults in their household, and the responses reflected
the practices of 12,400 people, the organization said. In a
1980 survey conducted by the group, 38.7% of the respondents
said they never drink wine. That figure climbed to 45.1% in
1985 and to 50.7% this year.
   Wine consumption varies sharply by sex, according to the
survey. It said 10.9% of the women and 28.1% of the men
called themselves daily wine drinkers.
   Asked why they didn't drink wine, 73.4% of the respondents
said they didn't like it and 25.3% cited health concerns. The
beverage most often chosen to replace wine with meals was
water.
                                                                                                       

   ROBBERY IN BRAZIL
                                                                                                       

   A 15-man team of bank robbers may become the latest
contributor to Brazilian inflation. The robbers stole
cruzeiros valued at more than $13 million Sunday morning from
a federal Central Bank branch in Salvador, Bahia. Most of the
stolen cash reserves hadn't yet become part of the money
supply. The Central Bank said it would publish a listing of
all the serial numbers today, but this may not prevent the
banknotes -- believed to be in small denominations -- from
circulating. Central Bank officials told the Jornal do Brasil
newspaper that the heist was "as if the thieves were issuing
currency."

   JAPAN'S COMMUNISTS
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Communist Party opened a congress yesterday with
an attack on China and the Soviet Union. The party, which has
500,000 members, has long tried to distance itself from the
two giants of world communism by advocating multiparty
democracy. However, its support has fallen sharply in two
national elections over the past year in part because of
public revulsion at China's repression of democracy protests
and the anti-communist tide of change in Europe.
                                                                                                       

   TOWARD PEACE IN AFRICA
                                                                                                       

   The six countries of the Horn of Africa agreed to help
each other find peace. The leaders of Ethiopia, Uganda,
Kenya, Sudan, Somalia and Djibouti made their pledge just
before the annual summit of the Organization of African Unity
opened yesterday in Addis Ababa. Each country promised to
"refrain from any action against the national unity and
territorial integrity of other member states." Of the six
nations, only Kenya and Djibouti are free from civil war.
                                                                                                       

   PLANS FOR EAST GERMAN AIRLINE
                                                                                                       

   West Germany plans to reduce state ownership of the East
German airline Interflug to 51% from 100% following the full
unification of the two Germanys, Lufthansa said. That would
leave Lufthansa, West Germany's 51% state-owned flag carrier,
with its previously agreed upon 26% stake in Interflug, with
the other 23% being sold to third parties, Lufthansa Chairman
Heinz Ruhnau said. He didn't identify the third parties.
                                                                                                       

   CHINA'S FALTERING ECONOMY
                                                                                                       

   China released figures for 1990's first six months that
showed poor performance by state-owned industry. Finance
Minister Wang Bingqian characterized the nation's financial
situation as "still fairly grim," the official Xinhua News
Agency reported. Xinhua quoted Mr. Wang as blaming China's
economic woes on low industrial production, a sluggish market
and insufficient control over expenditures.
                                                                                                       

   GLOOMY OUTLOOK FOR EAST EUROPE
                                                                                                       

   The Soviet Union and its East European neighbors are
plunging deeper into recession, United Nations economists
said.
   Some radical austerity policies, particularly in Poland,
have led to worse recession than expected, the U.N. Economic
Commission for Europe said. And attempts by the Soviet Union
and some other countries to stabilize activity within the old
communist-style economic system have generally failed.
   The commission said East European governments had
encountered considerable difficulties in obtaining a
consensus for new solutions. "The policy landscape at midyear
is thus dominated by uncertainty. The only certain element
appears to be that the recession in Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union is far from having run its course," it said in a
midyear review of the economies of its 34 member states.
   "The problems facing the reforming economies are immense,"
the commission said, "and their solution will take time and
require considerable assistance from the West."
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Japan's Yasuda Trust &amp; Banking Co. has replaced disposable
wooden chop sticks with reusable plastic ones in the company
cafeteria. In so doing, "we are helping to preserve forests
and reduce urban waste," a spokesman said. . . . Britain will
hold an inquiry into the conduct of a steamship captain who
was censured for not helping the Titanic when it sank 78
years ago. The investigation will examine testimony at the
original inquiry as to the role of Stanley Lord, captain of
the Californian. The new inquiry comes in response to a
campaign by relatives to clear the name of Mr. Lord, who
maintained until his death in 1962 that he was too far from
the Titanic to be of help.

<HEAD>New Ship Communications Signal End Of Morse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World shipping leaders have given the go-ahead for
the introduction of new, automatic communications that will mean the
end of the Morse code for ships at sea.
   The Global Maritime Distress and Safety System transmits and
receives automatically, so Morse will no longer be a requirement for
ships. Shipowners are expected to phase out radio operators when the
new equipment is installed in ships, starting in 1993.
   Some parts of the new technology, which includes satellite
communications, are already in use on British ships and from 1999
they will be compulsory on ships worldwide.
   The decision was taken Friday during a two-week London conference
of the International Maritime Organization, a United Nations agency
for the safety of shipping and preventing ships polluting the seas.
   The 66 countries represented accounted for about 97 percent of
the world's ships, said spokesman Roger Kohn.
   A statement afterward called the decision ``one of the biggest
advances in maritime communications since the introduction of
radio.''
   The new system allows the crew to send a distress signal by
pushing a button, which should prevent ships disappearing without a
trace when messages cannot be sent in time.
   Ships will also carry a radio beacon, which will give the ship's
position and must be able to float free if the ship sinks suddenly.
   Kohn said: ``Morse has great romantic connotations with the
gallant radio operator sending off distress calls as the ship sinks.
But we are bringing in something that will be much better and which
should save even more lives.''
   The Morse code, invented by American Samuel Morse and first used
in 1844, has been the foundation of ship's distress and safety
messages since the turn of the century. It is a series of long and
short electronic ``dots and dashes'' representing letters of the
alphabet.
   Morse code was used to inform an incredulous world that the
supposedly unsinkable oceanliner Titanic was sinking in the North
Atlantic in 1912. The Titanic sank swiftly and 1,500 people perished.

   Martin Marietta Corp. formed a new unit to focus on commercial sales of its Titan rocket for launching satellites and named Richard E. Brackeen president of the unit. 

   Mr. Brackeen had been vice president of space launch systems for the company's aerospace operation in Denver, where its Titan rockets are built. 
In his new post, 48-year-old Mr. Brackeen will be responsible for marketing, contracting and business development of the Titan for commercial use. 
Succeeding him as a vice president at the Denver operations will be Gareth D. Flora, 48, vice president of business development. 

   As previously reported, the aerospace and information systems concern predicts that by the early 1990s, annual commercial sales of its Titan rockets could be about $500 million. 
In addition, the company has preliminary agreements to launch satellites for a number of customers, and the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization has said it will buy two Titan rockets.

   A Titan rocket today propelled into
space a secret military payload that a civilian expert identified
as a satellite capable of eavesdropping on Soviet military and
diplomatic communications.
   The powerful, 16-story-tall Titan 34D, scoring its third
straight success after being grounded for 18 months, thundered from
its launch pad at 8:05 a.m.
   The Air Force did not announce the launch in advance, which has
been its practice on military space flights, and afterward said
only that the Titan 34D, ``carrying a classified military
payload,'' was successfully launched.
   John E. Pike, a space policy expert for the Washington-based
Federation of American Scientists, said last month the payload
would be a satellite to monitor Soviet missile tests and radio,
telephone, radar and other electronic military and diplomatic
communications.
   He said the payload carried an antenna built to unfold to the
size of a baseball field.
   Pike said the satellite project originally was code-named Chalet
but was changed to Vortex when Chalet became known. Vortex became
compromised some time ago and yet another name may have been
substituted, he said.
   The Titan 34D will remain the nation's most powerful unmanned
rocket until an upgraded version, the Titan 4, makes its launch
debut later this year, also with a military satellite. Both are
made by Martin Marietta in Denver.
   A Titan 34D carrying a reconnaissance satellite was launched in
October from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. Another blasted away
from Cape Canaveral a month later and placed in orbit a satellite
to provide warning of a missile attack.
   Before the October launch, the Titan 34D had been grounded
following two straight explosions of the rocket.

for repeatedly calling him just plain "Mario." Cuomo dubbed Quayle "Danny,"
the cabin boy on the Titanic.;   The name game began when Quayle referred to
Cuomo three times as "Mario" in a Sunday appearance on ABC-TV's "This Week

<TEXT>     Cuomo insisted Wednesday that he was "not the least bit irritated" and said
maybe the Republicans were "just trying to be friendly." But he also raised
the possibility that Republicans were trying to remind voters of the
governor's Italian heritage.;   The governor, whose mother was born in Italy,
noted that GOP Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas had earlier said there weren't "many
Marios down there" when discussing Cuomo's possible strength in the South.;  
Quayle's spokesman, David Beckwith, responded: "I'm not going to descend to
this level of discourse. It's surprising that Gov. Cuomo would attempt to
inject ethnicity charges before he even declares" his intention to run.;  
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater came to Quayle's defense.;   "That's
his name -- Mario, Mario, Mario, Mario, Mario, Mario. He better get used to
it," Fitzwater said.;   Cuomo's rejoinder: "Please tell Mr. Fitzwater that I
am used to it. I've been using it for 59 years.";   Fitzwater said he was
willing to call Cuomo "whatever he wants.";   "How about, 'Mr. President?' " a
reporter asked.;   "Except that," Fitzwater said.;   Cuomo, who is weighing a
presidential bid, said he was upset by Quayle's suggestion that Republicans
will run against the "nightmare of New York" if the governor is the Democratic
nominee.;   He said President Bush and Quayle can't blame governors for the
nation's overall problems. That would be like the Titanic's captain and his
cabin boy blaming the ship's sinking on the seamen, he said.;   He said the
cabin boy -- Quayle -- was saying what the captain -- Bush -- told him to say.
He added: "Good, Danny, get him another warm milk."  </TEXT>

   A Titan rocket packing a secret
Pentagon payload streaked off on an apparently routine flight into
orbit, but the fiery blastoff ignited brush fires that closed the
launch area for more than an hour.
   The $65 million Titan 34D lifted off at 3:47 p.m. Wednesday and
appeared to be flying normally through a partly cloudy sky.
   As with other military space flights, the Air Force did not
announce the launch in advance. But with more than 20,000 employees
working at Cape Canaveral and adjacent Kennedy Space Center, it
couldn't hide the fact that the 16-story-tall rocket was going to
be launched.
   Minutes before liftoff, hundreds of workers poured out of
buildings to watch.
   The Air Force issued a brief post-launch statement saying only
that a Titan 34D had been launched successfully. It provided no
information on the nature of the payload.
   There was no damage to launch pad from brush fires triggered by
the rocket's exhaust, officials said.
   Lt. Gen. Aloysius Casey, retiring commander of the Air Force
Space Division, told a conference last year that the first Titan
34D launched in 1989 would carry up two communications satellites
named DSCS _ for Defense Satellite Communications System.
   The satellites are built to provide secure voice and high data
rate transmission for American military and diplomatic
communications.
   Sources close to the project who spoke on condition of anonynity
said Wednesday the satellites were aboard the Titan 34D.
   A Chalet satellite designed to monitor Soviet communications
networks was aboard a Titan 34D launched last Sept. 2. An upper
stage failure left that payload in the wrong orbit.
   On Nov. 6, a Titan 34D successfully launched a payload believed
to be a pair of satellites intended to monitor Soviet missile tests
and electronic communciations.
   One Titan 34D remains in the Air Force inventory. It is
scheduled for launch from Cape Canaveral later this year and will
be replaced by the more powerful Titan 4.
   The first Titan 4 is scheduled for launch here within a few
weeks, carrying a satellite designed to provide instant warning of
a hostile missile attack on the United States.

1812-era wreck in Lake Ontario _ and shared the expedition with
children across North America.
   The camera-equipped robot examined the Hamilton, a merchant
schooner that the British pressed into service as a warship.
   Students at 14 spots in the United States and Canada watched
satellite TV transmissions. A few students even got to try steering
the robot through a satellite link, using joysticks like those used
with computer games. It transmitted pictures to students watching
through satellite hookups at 14 locations in the United States and
Canada.
   Cannons, railings and the ship's elegantly carved figurehead
could be seen in the television transmission.
   Robert D. Ballard, the expedition's leader, said the ship's
state of preservation was remarkable.
   ``We can see the caulking in the planks,'' he said.
   The Hamilton and its sister ship, the Scourge, sank during a
storm on Aug. 8, 1813, killing 53 sailors. They had taken part in
several battles for the British against U.S. forces that invaded
southern Canada during the war.
   The wrecks remained undisturbed in 300 feet of water six miles
off St. Catharines, about 30 miles south of Toronto and less than
10 miles west of the U.S. border at Niagara Falls, until their
discovery in 1975.
   Since then, there have been several attempts to examine the
wrecks, including one by French explorer Jacques Cousteau. But none
were technologically advanced enough to reach them.
   The cold, fresh water helped keep the ships in much better
condition than most wrecks, said Shelley Lauzon, a project
spokeswoman.
   ``The wood on the Titanic is all gone because there are
wood-boring animals in salt water,'' Lauzon said. ``They're not
present here.''
   Ballard, director of the Center for Marine Exploration at the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, led the 1985
expedition that discovered the wreck of the Titanic. The ocean
liner sank in the North Atlantic after ramming an iceberg in 1912.
   Ballard said Monday's examination of the Hamilton and the
Scourge was aimed more at teaching children about archaeology and
oceanography than at making startling new discoveries about the two
warships.
   ``We've had four students actually take control and operate the
vehicle beautifully,'' he said in an interview by ship-to-shore
telephone. ``That was the biggest technological feat.''
   The children controlled the robot with a joystick linked to the
system by satellite, Lauzon said. A computer program restricted the
robot's movements so the children could not damage it.
   Although there were no archaeological breakthroughs, the
expedition did reveal a number of details not known before, Ballard
said.
   The two-week expedition will prepare a comprehensive diagram of
both ships and could provide information allowing the city of
Hamilton, which has title to the wrecks, to decide whether they are
worth raising. Ballard said there appeared to be little damage that
would stand in the way of such an effort.
   ``There's no suggestion that they suffered any damage due to the
sinking itself,'' he said. ``They just got flooded and went down
very gently.''
   The museums taking part in the program were in Boston; Chicago;
Dallas; Detroit; Memphis, Tenn.; Minneapolis; Rochester, N.Y.; Salt
Lake City; Sarasota, Fla.; Toronto; Victoria, British Columbia;
Washington; and Woods Hole.

A Norwegian coast guard ship cut through thick Arctic ice Tuesday to rescue 
hundreds of people who had taken refuge on ice floes and in lifeboats after 
their Soviet cruise liner hit an iceberg and took on water. All of the nearly 
600 passengers were reported safe. 
</P>
<P>
"All the passengers are now off the vessel and only (some of the) the crew 
remains," said Arne Finne, a spokesman for the Rescue Center in Bodoe, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the day, some of the Soviet crew members -- who had remained aboard the 
Maxim Gorky -- stabilized the badly listing vessel and sailed toward port with 
the help of a coast guard ship and several pumps flown from Norway. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
740 Reach Spitsbergen 
</P>
<P>
Early today -- more than 25 hours after their ordeal began -- about 740 
passengers and crew of the estimated 950 aboard reached the Norwegian Arctic 
outpost at Spitsbergen, officials said. Passengers were taken to the airport on 
the tiny island of 1,000 people for chartered flights back home. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the Soviet crew had worked to keep the 630-foot ocean liner 
afloat in the Norwegian Sea, about 185 miles west of Spitsbergen, while the 
rescue ship and helicopters saved passengers huddling in blankets in the 
near-freezing temperatures. There were no reports of serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The Maxim Gorky rammed the iceberg in the foggy Arctic twilight shortly after 
midnight, when many of the passengers were partying in a shipboard nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
"Suddenly there was a terrible crash that almost shook me from my bed," said 
Rudolf Ludwig, 67, of Wiesbaden, West Germany, one of the passengers on the 
midnight sun cruise who was evacuated by helicopter to Norway's Svalbard 
island. 
</P>
<P>
"We were told to get into the lifeboats," Ludwig said. "We sat for five hours 
among the icebergs. The atmosphere was calm, and the Russian sailors did 
everything they could. They gave us vodka and whiskey in the boats, since it 
was cold. And blankets, too." 
</P>
<P>
West German passenger Win-fried Prince said there was no panic, and "the 
Russian crew has worked perfectly in disembarking passengers into lifeboats, 
and also the Norwegians who picked us up . . . have done a wonderful job." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ripped Two Holes 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred early Tuesday when the iceberg ripped two holes in the 
ship, which quickly took on water. Passengers said three decks became 
submerged. 
</P>
<P>
The coast guard vessel Senja, its bow reinforced for ice-breaking, rushed to 
the site about 300 miles east of northern Greenland. It reached the area after 
about four hours to begin rescue work. Soviet ships arrived later to continue 
the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Although reports of the number of people aboard the liner varied, the agency 
that chartered the vessel said there were 953 aboard -- 575 passengers and 378 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
Johannes Zurnieden, manager of the Phoenix-Flugreisen tourist agency in West 
Germany, said all but 16 of the passengers were West Germans. The others 
included Austrian, Swiss, Italian, British, Dutch and Swedish passengers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clambered Into Lifeboats 
</P>
<P>
After the accident, about 350 passengers clambered into lifeboats and some were 
taken to ice floes before being plucked to safety by Norwegian and Soviet 
helicopters. They later were moved onto a Norwegian rescue vessel in the 
Barents Sea, the coast guard said. 
</P>
<P>
The estimated 200 passengers who had remained aboard the 25,000-ton vessel were 
evacuated and picked up by the Senja. 
</P>
<P>
The captain of the Senja, Sigurd Kleiven, said the Maxim Gorky had two gashes 
in the starboard hull, one measuring 30 inches by 8 feet and the other 2 inches 
by 19 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Kleiven said that after his ship's arrival, two of the Senja's pumps were taken 
aboard the crippled liner. One pump later broke down. 
</P>
<P>
Divers inspected the gashes, but there was nothing available to plug them with, 
Kleiven said. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Finn B. Hansen of the North Norway Rescue Coordination Center said the 
Soviet tugboat Sarja arrived with more pumps and two more vessels steamed 
toward the site. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like there is enough new pumping equipment aboard to keep it afloat," 
Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, the crew managed to stabilize the ship despite the gashes and set 
sail for Barentsburg, 300 miles to the east, trailed by a coast guard ship, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is under control, thanks to comprehensive pumping equipment 
continuously brought to the vessel throughout the day," a coast guard spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Maxim Gorky had set out June 11 from Bremerhaven, West Germany, sailed to 
Iceland and, then, while sailing around the Spitsbergen island chain on its way 
to Norway, struck the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian Meteorological Institute sends out weekly ice charts of the area, 
but the situation changes too quickly to be dependable for navigation, the 
Norwegian news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was reportedly foggy at the time of the accident, it was not fully 
dark because the area around the Arctic Circle is light nearly 24 hours a day 
this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-seven years ago, on April 14, 1912, the British luxury liner Titanic 
hit an iceberg just south of Newfoundland on its maiden voyage. Of 2,224 people 
aboard, 1,513 died. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fared Better 
</P>
<P>
Steinar Breivik at the Bodoe Rescue Center said the Maxim Gorky fared better 
because damage to the Titanic was apparently much worse and because the Soviet 
vessel "received pumping equipment within a few hours, both from land and from 
other ships." 
</P>
<P>
The Maxim Gorky was built in West Germany in 1969 and sold to the Soviet Union 
in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets have been involved in the cruise business for foreigners for about 
15 years. The Soviet merchant fleet began expanding passenger liners for the 
cruise trade as well as purchasing new ships during the early '70s. 
</P>
<P>
The collision with the iceberg is the latest disaster or near-disaster reported 
openly under Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reformist policy of 
disclosure of events. 
</P>
<P>
In the worst Soviet shipping disaster, the cruise ship Admiral Nakhimov was 
rammed by a grain freighter in the Black Sea in August, 1986, killing 398 of 
1,236 people aboard.

<TEXT>
   Europe and the United States plan to send a space
probe to Titan, the solar system's biggest moon and the only one
with an atmosphere much like primordial Earth's, the European Space
Agency announced Friday.
   The joint mission to Saturn's immense, gas-shrouded satellite
would begin in 1996 and include a lunar probe that may be able to
test soil from the mysterious moon.
   The mission, to be called the Cassini-Titan probe, was chosen
from a series of proposed joint projects during meetings Thursday
and Friday of the European Space Agency's Science Program Committee.
   NASA, however, still is seeking official approval for the $550
million project. It is expected to ask Congress for some funding
during the 1990 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1, NASA spokesman
Charles Redmond said in Washington.
   Redmond said he expects the Europeans would contribute about $100
million to $150 million. They proposed paying for at least one major
instrument system, helping to pay for some others and providing
propulsion components.
   The project is named after 17th-century Italian astronomer
Giovanni Domenico Cassini.
   Titan is the only moon in the solar system known to have a thick,
organic-rich nitrogen atmosphere. The surface temperature is about
minus 354 degrees.
   Scientists believe that the chemical processes in Titan's
atmosphere may resemble those at work on the primitive Earth before
the origin of life.
   Cassini-Titan is to be launched in April 1996 by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and should arrive in the Saturn
system in October 2002, the European Space Agency said in a
statement.
   Saturn and its system of rings and satellites were briefly
encountered in 1980-81 during the United States' Voyager 1 and 2
missions.
   The Cassini-Titan mission will place around Saturn a NASA-built
orbiter that will send an European-built probe into Titan's
atmosphere. The probe is to slow down to subsonic speeds when it
gets within 110 miles of the moon.
   The probe is named Huygens, after the Dutch astronomer and
physicist Christian Huygens, who discovered Titan in 1656.
   A parachute system will be deployed to allow a slow descent to
the surface of Titan, which some scientists say is covered by ethane
and methane lakes or oceans. The low-velocity impact may be soft
enough to allow analysis of a surface sample before the probe dies,
the European Space Agency said.
   During the descent of Huygens, the orbiter will be used as a
radio relay station to transmit the probe's data to Earth. After
Huygen's mission, the Cassini orbiter is to circle Saturn for four
years at an altitude of only 620 miles.

FT  15 APR 92 / Messages from the Titanic fetch Pounds 95,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIE'S South Kensington raised Pounds 95,000 (against a Pounds 30,000
estimate) for a collection of 448 messages which were sent and received by
the Titanic, the luxury liner which sank in the North Atlantic on her maiden
voyage in 1912.
The top price was the Pounds 66,000 (estimate Pounds 8,000 to Pounds 10,000)
paid by a telephone bidder for 85 signals sent and received by the Titanic
between April 12 and April 15, the morning she hit the iceberg that sank
her.
There was keen bidding for a 10-page letter by Harold Bride, a Marconi
wireless operator on board the ship, describing his experiences, which sold
for Pounds 8,250 (eight times its target). Another item that attracted
interest was a letter put up for sale by Eva Hart, one of the few survivors
still alive, which was given by her father, who went down with the ship, to
her mother, who was saved.
Christie's had been excited by the appearance of a previously unknown album
containing more than 50 drawings by Henry Fuseli. Its excitement was
justified - the album doubled its estimate at almost Pounds 750,000. The top
price was the Pounds 55,000 paid for a pen-and-pencil drawing of 'The
Massacre of the Innocents'.
The morning auction of Old Master drawings did well, totalling Pounds
687,764 and 94 per cent sold. A pastel of Princess Radziwill, painted in
1801 by Louise-Elizabeth Vigee le-Brun, just about doubled its estimate
fetching about Pounds 50,600.
The surprise of the auction was the Pounds 38,500 paid for a study of arms
attributed to the Circle of Michaelangelo. Its estimate had been Pounds
5,000. Obviously, the buyer believed it to be by the the master.

   The Air Force's last Titan 3 rocket
blasted off with a secret military satellite Monday, ending a
quarter century of launches by a workhorse booster that has hurled
more than 200 satellites into space.
   The 16-story-tall rocket, the powerful 34D model, brilliantly
illuminated the darkness as it blazed away from its launch pad at
1:54 a.m.
   The Air Force said it was the 135th success in 141 launches for
the Titan 3 family, a success rate of 96 percent.
   ``We close the book of the Titan 34D and move on to another
generation of launch vehicles,'' said Brig. Gen. Thomas W.
Honeywill, commander of the Air Force Systems Command.
   Officials said Monday's payload was secret. Sources who spoke on
condition on anonymity said the rocket may have carried a
reconnaissance satellite.
   Many of the satellites carried by Titan 3 rockets have been
cloaked in secrecy since the first was launched here in 1964.
   The payloads, most of them built for the Pentagon, have performed
a number of strategic assignments, including photo reconnaissance,
communications, navigation, monitoring missile tests, intercepting
military and diplomatic messages, verifying Soviet compliance with
arms treaties and establishing an orbiting system to provide instant
alert of a missile attack.
   Titan 3 rockets also launched two Viking spacecraft toward Mars
in 1976 and sent the Voyager 1 and 2 probes in 1977 toward the solar
system's outer reaches.
   Voyager 2 two weeks ago week sent back stunning images of Neptune
and its moon Triton as it completed a grand tour that also included
a closeup look at Uranus.
   The Titan 34D can boost 31,650-pound payloads into low orbit,
about 150 miles up, or 4,200 pounds to stationary orbit 22,300 miles
out.
   The Air Force is replacing it with the larger Titan 4, the first
of which boosted a missile warning satellite into orbit on June 14.
The new rocket can hoist 39,000 pounds to low orbit or 10,000 pounds
to stationary orbit.
   Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems has a contract to build 23
Titan 4s for the Air Force for $5.1 billion and is negotiating for
an additional 26 rockets.
   Martin Marietta developed the Titan 3 series for the Air Force
from the Titan 2 intercontinental range nuclear missile, which
earlier had been modified to boost into orbit the two-man Gemini
capsule in the mid-1960s.
   The booster evolved through the Titan 3A, 3B, 3C and 34D series,
each more powerful than the last.
   ``With this launch, the Titan continued its unparalleled success
record,'' said Gareth D. Flora, president of Space Launch Systems.
   ``Titan expendable launch vehicles have been the backbone of the
Air Force's space program for more than 20 years, and we expect the
Titan 4 to continue that tradition.''

<HEAD>Four Navy Spy Satellites Said To Soar Aboard Refurbished ICBM</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<DATELINE>VANDENBERG AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Titan 2 rocket that
once sat in a silo armed with a nuclear warhead was launched into
space Monday, carrying a secret Air Force payload believed to be
four spy satellites designed to eavesdrop on Soviet ships.
   The launch marked the first time one of the refurbished missiles
had been used as a space booster, and apparently was the second
time U.S. spy satellites had been sent into orbit in less than a
week.
   ``It was a spectacular launch with all systems operating as
expected,'' said Air Force Capt. Norma Payne.
   But the spokeswoman added that officials would not know for two
to three days whether the classified payload achieved its intended
polar orbit circling the Earth from North to South poles.
   The rocket almost certainly carried a four-satellite addition to
the Navy's White Cloud Navy Ocean Surveillance System, an
electronic eavesdropping system that locates and identifies Soviet
and other ships by detecting radio and radar transmissions, space
policy analyst John Pike said before the launch.
   ``The Navy really likes them,'' said Pike, of the
Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. ``They are very
important for being able to keep track of the Soviet fleet.''
   Pike said a White Cloud launch ``consists of one mother
satellite and three subsatellites,'' and that when orbit is
reached, the mother satellite deploys the other three spacecraft so
all four are strung out a few hundred miles from each other in
polar orbit.
   The $37.5 million Titan 2 roared off Space Launch Complex 4 West
and into fog-shrouded skies at 2:25 a.m. PDT, Ms. Payne said at
this sprawling military base 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   The force of the blast-off rattled windows in the nearby town of
Lompoc, where police said they received a half-dozen calls from
residents asking whether it was an earthquake or a launch.
   The liquid-fueled, two-stage rocket is 103 feet high and capable
of lifting 4,200 pounds into a 100-nautical-mile circular orbit.
   Starting in the 1960s, Titan 2 rockets were kept in silos in
Arkansas, Kansas and Arizona, where they served as intercontinental
ballistic missiles, each carrying a nine-megaton hydrogen warhead.
   But the missiles were removed from service ``because the
propellants were corroding the innards of the missile and they had
a tendency to blow up,'' Pike said.
   The Air Force then ordered 13 Titan 2s reconditioned as space
boosters under a $528.9 million contract with Martin Marietta Corp.
Air Force officials have said more are likely to be refurbished
because recycling the old ICBMs is cheaper than building new
rockets.
   Last Friday, a satellite said to be designed for intercepting
Soviet communications was launched by a $65 million Titan 34D
rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla. But a source close to the project,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the spacecraft failed to
achieve its desired stationary orbit 22,300 miles high when the
upper stage of the rocket failed to re-ignite. He said there was
little hope of salvaging that mission.
   Despite that failure, Air Force Secretary Edward C. ``Pete''
Aldridge issued a prepared statement after Monday's launch,
declaring, ``This is the year of space launch recovery.''
   ``Today's successful Titan 2 launch is the first of three new
boosters the Air Force will launch in the coming year,'' Aldridge
said. ``The Titan 2, Titan 4 and the Delta 2 ... will ensure this
nation's access to space for many years to come.''
   The launch had been expected a week earlier, but apparently was
delayed by a fuel leak that the Air Force said spurred evacuation
of the launch pad Aug. 28. No one was hurt in that incident,
officials said.
   Pike said the only other payload the Titan 2 might boost into
orbit from Vandenberg was a Defense Meteorological Support Program
satellite. But he called that unlikely.
   A Titan 2 exploded in its Arkansas silo on Sept. 19, 1980,
killing one crewman, injuring 21 others, blasting a 250-foot-wide
crater and lofting the nine-megaton warhead harmlessly 200 feet
from the silo. Fuel leaks and vapor spurts that prompted brief silo
evacuations also plagued Titan 2 ICBMs, which since have been
replaced by Minuteman, Midgetman and MX missiles.
   Pike said Air Force officials have testified before Congress
that the first 13 reconditioned Titan 2s would be used for one
launch of a LANDSAT Earth-observing science satellite, six launches
of DMSP weather satellites and six launches of satellites in a
classified program.
   Four or five sets of White Clouds _ about 16 to 20 satellites _
already are in orbit, with the new set likely meant to replace
aging White Clouds launched in the early 1980s, he said.
   Pike compared White Clouds to Soviet RORSATs, or Radar Ocean
Reconaissance Satellites, which monitor U.S. ship movements.

   The last Air Force Titan 3 rocket
roared into space with a secret Pentagon satellite today, ending 25

   The 16-story-tall rocket, a 34D model, blazed away from its

rumbled skyward.
   ``The vehicle is right on track,'' said Air Force Lt. Col. Ron

   The Air Force said it was the 135th success in 141 launches for

that it was classified. Sources speaking on condition of anonymity
said the rocket may have carried an advanced reconnaissance
satellite.
   A secrecy label has been placed on many of the satellites carried
by Titan 3 rockets since the first was launched here in 1964.
   The payloads, most built for the Defense Department, have
performed many strategic military assignments. Among them were photo
reconnaissance, communications, monitoring missile tests,
intercepting military and diplomatic messages, verifying Soviet
compliance with arms control treaties and establishing an orbiting
system to provide instant alert of a hostile missile attack.
   The Titan 3s also have had some notable non-classified launches,
including two Viking spacecraft boosted toward landings on Mars in
1976 and the Voyager 1 and 2 probes dispatched in 1977 toward the
outer planets.
   Voyager 1 and 2 probed Jupiter and Saturn, while Voyager 2 two
weeks ago week sent back stunning images of Neptune and its moon
Triton as it completed a grand tour that included closeup looks at
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   The Titan 34D launched today was the 15th for that model, which
is the most powerful in the Titan 3 series. It can boost
31,650-pound payloads into low Earth orbit or 4,200 pounds to
stationary orbit 22,300 miles out.
   The Air Force is replacing the Titan 34D with the more powerful
Titan 4, the first of which successfully boosted a missile warning
satellite into orbit on June 14. The new rocket can hoist 39,000
pounds to Earth orbit or 10,000 pounds to stationary orbit.
   Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems in Denver has a contract to
build 23 Titan 4s for the Air Force for $5.1 billion. The two are
negotiating for an additional 26 rockets.
   Martin Marietta developed the Titan 3 series for the Air Force
from the Titan 2 intercontinental range nuclear missile, which
earlier had been modifed to boost into orbit the two-man Gemini
capsule in the mid-1960s.
   The space booster evolved through the Titan 3A, 3B, 3C and 34D
series, each more powerful than the last.
   ``With this launch, the Titan continued its unparalled success
record,'' said Gareth D. Flora, president of Space Launch Systems.
``Titan expendable launch vehicles have been the backbone of the Air
Force's space program for more than 20 years, and we expect the
Titan 4 to continue that tradition.''

A powerful Titan rocket Wednesday propelled into space a secret Pentagon 
payload believed to be a pair of advanced satellites for worldwide U.S. 
military and diplomatic communications. 
</P>
<P>
The 16-story-tall, $65-million Titan 34D roared away from its launch pad and 
appeared to be flying normally as it rumbled out over the Atlantic through 
partly cloudy skies. 
</P>
<P>
The fiery exhaust ignited several brush fires that kept the launch pad area 
closed for more than an hour. There was no damage to facilities, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force did not announce the launch in advance, which has been its 
practice on military space flights for several years. It issued a brief 
post-launch statement that said only that a Titan 34D had been "launched 
successfully." It provided no information on the nature of the payload. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Pentagon tried to keep the launch secret, with more than 20,000 
employees working at Cape Canaveral and the adjacent Kennedy Space Center, it 
proved difficult for them to hide the fact that a rocket that large was going 
to be launched. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes before the Titan 34D lifted off, hundreds of workers poured out of 
buildings to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Aloysius Casey, outgoing commander of the Air Force Space Division, 
told a space conference last year that the first Titan 34D launched in 1989 
would carry up two communications satellites named DSCS, for Defense Satellite 
Communications System. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the project who declined to be identified said Wednesday the 
DSCS satellites were aboard the Titan 34D. DSCS satellites are built to provide 
secure voice and high data-rate transmission for American military and 
diplomatic communications.

   It was news that the world had waited seven decades to hear. 
On Sept. 1, 1985, Robert D. Ballard announced that he had found and photographed the wreck of the Royal Mail Steamship Titanic, the largest and most luxurious liner that had ever plied the seas. 

   Mr. Ballard had triumphed -- where many before him had failed -- through a combination of determination, detective work and a firm commitment to advanced technology. 
In that first expedition and in a follow-up a year later, he and his scientific crew shot thousands of still photos and made hours of videotape of the Titanic's final resting place. 

   Now comes "The Discovery of the Titanic" (Madison Press/Warner Books, 230 pages, $29.95), Mr. Ballard's lavishly illustrated account of how the ship was located and what was found when it was. 
One needn't be a Titanic buff to be bowled over by the result. 

   The loss of the Titanic was one of those events that defined an era. 
Hailed as "unsinkable" (though not by either its builders or owners), it was speeding through the night on its maiden voyage when it struck an iceberg on April 14, 1912. 
It carried lifeboats for only a fraction of the 2,227 on board, and when it plunged 2 1/2 miles to the bottom of the frigid Atlantic it took more than 1,500 people with it. 

   For 73 years, the wreck had eluded all searchers. 
Enter Mr. Ballard, a geologist and self-described "submarine cowboy" working out of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts. 
His previous deep ocean work in the Galapagos Rift and Eastern Pacific Rise had already gained him a measure of renown. 
Throughout those explorations, however, the lure of finding the Titanic remained, and each advance in oceanographic technology brought the dream tantalizingly closer. 

   Finally, in 1985, a joint U.S.-French team set out using some of the highest of high-technology equipment, including an underwater television camera capable of scanning the ocean's bottom. 
Mr. Ballard hoped to prove that video exploration of the oceans was both feasible and preferable to using manned submersibles. 
Yet the task was formidable -- far more difficult than finding the proverbial needle in the haystack. 
The explorers found the wreck on almost the very edge of the expanse of water they had identified as their primary search area. 

   The discovery, when it came, was a tremendous scientific achievement, but it also was a human one. 
Mr. Ballard writes of his emotions while standing on the deck of his ship at the exact hour and over the exact spot of the Titanic's demise: "It was one thing to have won -- to have found the ship. 
It was another thing to be there. 
That was the spooky part. 
I could see the Titanic as she slipped nose first into the glassy water. 
Around me were the ghostly shapes of the lifeboats and the piercing shouts and screams of people freezing to death in the water." 

   "The Discovery of the Titanic" is no idealized version of events. 
Mr. Ballard documents tensions within the crew over the approach to the search, as well as the rupture between the U.S. and French scientific teams after the discovery, when the French felt they were being deprived of their share of the glory of discovery. 
Mr. Ballard's own conceits -- some even bordering on arrogance -- come through as well. 
His insistence that electronic rather than human exploration is the wave of the future brought him into conflict with the group manning Alvin, the famous miniature submarine. 
Yet even this champion of new technology could not resist the desire to see the wreck through his own eyes: When he returned to the Titanic a year later, it was with Alvin -- allowing him physically to land on the deck of the Titanic and, using a swimming robot camera, explore the interior reaches of the wreck. 

   In any event, the book itself is splendid visual testament to Mr. Ballard's approach. 
The underwater photographs are stunning in both their clarity and their poignance: the empty davits that launched the too-few lifeboats; a doll's head lying incongruously on the ocean floor; a pair of shoes perfectly preserved long after the disappearance of any trace of the body that once wore them. 
Hundreds of color pictures of the rusting hulk -- often matched with vintage photos of how the ship looked in its heyday -- give eloquent testimony to its fate. 
Equally absorbing are paintings of what the entire hulk must look like now, by artist Ken Marschall. 

   The location and visual inspection of the wreck also cast new light on some of the mysteries surrounding the ship. 
It indeed broke in two before its final descent, as a few of the survivors claimed. 
The explorers found no evidence of the continuous gash many thought had been ripped in the hull; the evidence instead supports the notion that the collision caused the ship's steel plating to rupture intermittently. 
And the ship's location indicates it was not traveling quite as fast as was long believed -- though it was still moving much too quickly. 

   Many people might have thought that the Titanic should remain undiscovered. 
As with watching a magic trick, some of the wreck's fascination has always been rooted in mystery; know too much and the thrill is spoiled. 
It is a tribute to Mr. Ballard, and to this absorbing book, that he manages to preserve the fascination with the Titanic even while stripping away a significant amount of the mystery around its fate.

   A Titan 34D rocket
thundered into space Sunday, carrying a classified payload an expert
said was probably a pair of military communications satellites.
   The powerful 16-story-tall booster blasted off under heavy cloud
cover from Space Launch Complex 4 about 10:03 a.m, said Capt. John
Sullivan, a spokesman at Vandenberg, about 140 miles northwest of
Los Angeles.
   As usual for military space flights, the Air Force didn't
announce the launch in advance and did not identify the payload to
be put into orbit.
   The Titan 34D probably carried two Satellite Data System
satellites, said John Pike, a space policy expert for the
Washington-based Federation of American Scientists. He said it also
could have carried either a KH-9 or KH-11 photoreconnaissance spy
satellite.
   Pike, who knew of the launch in advance, said Friday the SDS
satellites are used for military communications, especially in the
event the United States had to launch a nuclear attack.
   The Titan 34D is America's most powerful space booster, although
it soon will be replaced by the Titan 4, which is due for its maiden
launch next year from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   Sunday's rocket was the last Titan 34D that will be launched from
Vandenberg. Two more are scheduled for launch from Cape Canaveral
early next year.
   The last launch of a Titan 34D was from Florida on Sept. 2, but
sources told The Associated Press it failed to orbit its payload
because the rocket's third stage failed to reignite.
   Titan 34Ds were grounded for 18 months following two successive
explosions during launches from Vandenberg in 1985 and 1986.

   The 1865 explosion of the paddlewheeler
Sultana was a disaster to rival the sinking of the Titanic.
   The dead, many of them emaciated from Confederate prison camps,
totaled more than 1,500, but newspapers of the day gave scant
notice. The horror was lost in the greater gore of Civil War and
presidential assassination.
   Until now, there had been no marker here for the Union soldiers
who perished in the muddy Mississippi. But on Sunday, a six-foot
granite marker is being unveiled in Memphis' Elmwood Cemetery as a
reminder that the Sultana went down in flames just seven miles
north of the city's downtown riverfront.
   Built for 300 passengers and a crew of 76, the steamship was
carrying more than 2,300 people plus 100 horses and mules when
three of its four boilers exploded at 2 a.m. on April 27, 1865.
   Jerry Potter, a Memphis lawyer who has researched the disaster
for a dozen years and is writing a book on it, said Union officers
may have overloaded the paddlewheeler to inflate troop transport
payments.
   ``There were two other steamboats that were trying to get a
portion of the men. The only explanation I have been able to
uncover for why the Sultana got them all is bribery,'' Potter said.
   Potter and Hugh Berryman, a forensic pathologist at the
University of Tennessee in Memphis, estimated the death toll at
1,547, 44 more than the number of people lost when the ocean liner
Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic in 1912.
   Other counts of the Sultana victims have put the total between
1,400 and 1,450, but Berryman said those estimates failed to
include one of three trainloads of soldiers who boarded at
Vicksburg, Miss.
   The monument, financed by three Memphis residents, will be the
second of two major markers to the disaster.
   The other, in Knoxville, was put up in 1916 by Sultana survivors
who raised money for the monument.
   Researching the disaster has been difficult because newspapers
of the day were still primarily concerned with the assassination of
Abraham Lincoln two weeks earlier and with the end of the war.
   ``It was just lost to history because of the other events that
were going on at the time,'' Berryman said.
   The Mississippi has shifted its course since the Sultana went
down, and the steamboat's remains rest now under a soybean field
about a mile east of the river in Arkansas, Potter said.
   Excavating the boat could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars,
and would produce little of commercial value since the wreck was
salvaged two months after it burned, he said.
   Berryman, who wrote a paper on the Sultana last year for the
Journal of Forensic Sciences, said survivors told of watching
dozens of victims drown en masse, hands clasped together as they
grappled for survival.
   ``Many of these victims had been through some of the roughest
battles in the war, and those experiences paled in comparison to
what they went through that night,'' he said.
   Most of the victims had recently been freed from prison camps in
Alabama and were headed north to be released from the Army. Many
were crowded onto two decks directly over the paddlewheeler's four
18-foot boilers, one of which had developed a leak that was hastily
repaired.
   When one of the boilers blew, setting off two others, the upper
decks collapsed forming a funnel that dumped dozens of victims into
the fire, Berryman said.
   The 263-foot boat, made of wood and covered with flammable
paint, was equipped with 76 life jackets. Many of the survivors
also escaped by clinging to debris. One survivor floated to shore
on a dead mule.
   The Army investigated the disaster and a captain in charge of
loading the troops at Vicksburg was found guilty of mishandling his
duties. His conviction was overturned on appeal, however, and he
was honorably discharged.

<HEAD>Spy Satellites OK Despite Reported Explosion Of Rocket's First
Stage</HEAD>

   The reported explosion of a Titan 2 rocket
stage as it fell away from a booster did not prevent four Navy spy
satellites from climbing toward their proper orbits, sources said.
   ``The satellites are moving exactly as they should be,'' an Air
Force source said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``Everything is just peachy.''
   The satellites were launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base 140
miles northwest of Los Angeles on Monday atop a 103-foot-high,
liquid-fueled Titan 2. The Lompoc Record newspaper, quoting ground
observers, reported Tuesday that the Titan 2's expended first stage
apparently blew up in a secondary explosion after separating from
the booster's second stage. The rest of the booster was seen
continuing skyward.
   A second source, also insisting on anonymity, told The
Associated Press that the satellites were not endangered.
   Neither source could confirm the secondary explosion, but said
they wouldn't necessarily know of such an event if it didn't affect
deployment of the satellites.
   ``I checked into it and everything I know is positive,'' said
Capt. Marty Hauser, an Air Force public affairs officer at the
Pentagon. ``It went well.''
   The observers, who were very familiar with launch procedures,
believed the crimson flash resulted from a puncture in a nearly
empty oxidizer tank on the the $37.5 million rocket's first stage,
according to the Record.
   The newspaper said similar anomalies happened after launches of
other rockets at Vandenberg without preventing their payloads from
reaching orbit.
   Capt. Norma Payne, a Vandenberg spokeswoman, would not discuss
whether an explosion occurred or whether the secret payload reached
proper orbit.
   ``We're not going to comment on the results of a (classified)
space flight,'' she said.
   Space policy expert John Pike of the Federation of American
Scientists has identified the Titan 2's payload as a White Cloud
Navy Ocean Surveillance System of four satellites which would be
used to listen to the Soviet fleet's radar and radio communications.
   Four or five sets of White Clouds _ about 16 to 20 satellites _
already are in orbit, with the new set likely meant to replace
aging White Clouds launched in the early 1980s, Pike said.
   The rocket was the first of a series of refurbished Titan 2
intercontinental ballistic missiles to be used as a space booster.
The missiles were originally deployed in silos in Arkansas, Kansas
and Arizona in the 1960s, but were removed because of corrosion and
other aging problems.
   The Air Force decided to refurbish Titan 2 as space boosters
because it was cheaper than building new rockets.
   On Monday, Payne called the Titan 2 liftoff ``a spectacular
launch with all systems operating as expected,'' but said officials
would not know for two to three days whether the payload achieved
its intended polar orbit circling the Earth from North to South
poles.
   Last Friday, a satellite said to be designed for intercepting
Soviet communications was launched by a $65 million Titan 34D
rocket from Cape Canaveral, Fla. A source close to the project, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said the satellite failed to
achieve its desired stationary orbit when the rocket's upper stage
failed to re-ignite. He said there was little hope of salvaging
that mission.

   A secret new spy satellite circled
the globe in a useless orbit Saturday, leaving the United States to
continue relying on aging systems for eavesdropping and warning of
missile attacks.
   The satellite, said to be designed for intercepting Soviet
communications, was propelled into a successful preliminary orbit
by a $65 million Titan 34D rocket launched here Friday.
   But a source close to the project said the spacecraft failed to
achieve a desired stationary orbit 22,300 miles high when the upper
stage of the rocket failed to re-ignite.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
satellite remained in a sharply elliptical orbit ranging from about
100 to 22,300 miles above Earth.
   He said the payload was useless on that course and there was
little hope of salvaging the mission.
   The Air Force, as is its custom with military launches, did not
announce the liftoff in advance. Several minutes after launch, with
the Titan apparently working well, it reported a successful start
to the mission.
   Asked about the reported failure, Air Force Lt. Col. Ron Rand,
director of public affairs at the Eastern Space and Missile Center
here, said the Pentagon had a policy of not commenting on the
results of military space flights.
   John E. Pike, a space policy expert for the Washington-based
Federation of American Scientists, said the satellite was
code-named Vortex, a series designed to monitor Soviet missile
tests and military and diplomatic electronic communications.
   It was intended to replace a satellite that has been in use for
several years and is showing signs of wear, the source reported.
   Aging is a problem with many of America's military satellites
and is causing concern among military planners, who over the last
two decades have relied heavily on space-based systems for
reconnaissance, communications, electronic eavesdropping,
missile-attack alert and navigation.
   Since the space shuttle Challenger explosion and a Titan 34D
blowup, both in early 1986, the Pentagon has been limited in its
ability to lift heavy satellites into orbit to replace older
systems, many of which continue to operate long past their
anticipated operational lifetimes.
   The Titan 34D, the United States' most powerful unmanned rocket,
was grounded for redesign for 18 months following its 1986 failure.
   Flights resumed late last year with two straight successes _
deployment of reconnaissance and missile attack warning satellites,
the only two heavy U.S. military payloads launched successfully in
the last 2{ years.
   Friday's launch was the first for the Titan 34D since those 1987
flights, and it had been delayed several months by technical
problems.
   Only three more Titan 34Ds remain in the inventory, with the
rocket to be replaced starting later this year by the more powerful
Titan 4.
   The redesigned space shuttle is scheduled to resume flights late
this month or in early October, and the Pentagon has booked
critically needed military satellites on five of the first nine
missions.
   Even before Challenger, the Defense Department realized it was
depending too much on the shuttle for access to space and began
developing the Titan 4 over the objection of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The Air Force is shepherding the construction of 50 Titan 4s and
a large number of smaller Delta 2s and Titan 2s to launch a family
of military satellites over the next several years, gradually
cutting back on its use of the shuttle.

   Thirty years ago, a Titan 1 missile
roared off a launch pad here on its maiden test flight, spawning an
evolution that soon will see one of its offspring debut as America's
most powerful unmanned space rocket.
   By today's standards, that first Titan 1 launch on Feb. 6, 1959,
was not much. Only the first stage was fueled, with the second
stage's tanks filled with water for weight, and it traveled only 300
miles down the Atlantic Tracking Range.
   But before many months, the Air Force rocket was hurling dummy
warheads more than 5,000 miles at speeds up to 17,000 mph.
   It was the nation's first two-stage intercontinental ballistic
missile and at the time the most powerful delivery system in its
nuclear arsenal.
   ``We certainly were plowing new ground with a two-stage vehicle.
The Titan 1 was the giant of our launch vehicle family,'' said Gary
D. Flora, who as a young engineer began working on Titans for Martin
Marietta in 1960. He now is president of the company's Space Launch
Systems Co. in Denver.
   But the Titan 1 was soon obsolete. It was replaced by the larger,
more powerful Titan 2, which with its storable fuel could sit for
months in an underground silo, ready to be fired at almost a
moment's notice.
   Fifty-four Titan 2s stood on alert for nearly 20 years in
165-foot silos in Arkansas, Kansas and Arizona before the last one
was deactivated in 1982. The liquid-fueled missiles were replaced by
the Minuteman and the submarine-launched Trident missiles, with
advanced technology and easier-to-handle solid fuel.
   Modified Titan 2s were used in 1965 and 1966 to hoist 10 pairs of
Gemini astronauts into orbit to rehearse techniques needed to send
Apollo astronauts to the moon.
   Then, using the Titan 2 as a basic core, Martin Marietta and the
Air Force built a series of Titan 3s by improving the rocket motors,
enlarging the fuel tanks, and adding solid fuel booster rockets and
upper stages.
   Most Titan 3s were used by the Air Force to launch satellites for
such things as reconnaissance, communications, and navigation. NASA
added its Centaur upper stage to a few of the vehicles to launch the
Helios deep space probe and the Voyager and Viking payloads to
explore the planets.
   The next generation, the Titan 4, is on a Canaveral launch pad,
ready for its maiden flight within a few weeks with a classified
military payload.
   The new rocket will be able to lift 39,000 pounds into low orbit
or carry 10,000 pounds to stationary orbit, 23,000 miles out, where
communications satellites reside.
   The Air Force has ordered 23 Titan 4s from Martin Marietta and
negotiations are under way for 26 more. The company also is
modifying 14 of the old Titan 2s removed from silos so they can
serve as medium-size space boosters. The first of these was launched
successfully with an Air Force payload last September.
   Flora said the Titan 4 is a very ``robust, blossoming program''
and he expects the rocket will be America's workhorse space rocket,
primarily for military payloads, until near the end of the century.
   ``With Titan 4 we are pushing into a new generation in terms of
lift capability,'' said W.E. Fields, director of Canaveral
Operations for Martin Marietta's Space Launch Systems.
   Fields said the Titan 4, like the Titan 3, will grow and become
even more powerful as improvements are introduced.
   And separate teams of contractors headed by Martin Marietta,
Boeing and General Dynamics are studying designs for a new rocket
for the early 21st century capable of lifting 100,000 to 200,000
pounds into orbit.
   ``Whether that becomes a derivative of Titan or not is
problematical,'' said Fields, who began working on the Titan program
in 1956.

   For a century and a half the great ships of the
Cunard line have been sailing the seas, in war and peace. Today
Cunard has seven cruise ships, including the QE2, calling at 240
ports around the world. A reporter who recently took a cruise on
the Black Sea in Eastern Europe tells of the line's colorful
history.

<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABOARD THE MS VISTAFJORD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Old Sam Cunard would be
delighted to learn that stewards on the steamship line he launched
150 years ago still don immaculate white gloves to serve afternoon
tea, that no cabin numbers end in 13 and that the ship's concert
survives as the passenger talent show.
   He would be particularly gratified to learn that when Her
Majesty calls, Cunard ships still go off to war, as the QE2 did,
with a helicopter pad covering its swimming pool, in the Falkland
Islands war. After all, he was knighted for deploying his entire
eight-ship fleet to transport troops and horses to the Crimean War.
   Sir Samuel wouldn't be too upset at finding Cunard's main
operations are now centered in New York, and not London or
Liverpool. Halifax, Nova Scotia, was his birthplace and home port
when the admiralty awarded him the contract ``to convey the mails
from a point in England to Halifax and back, twice each month.'' He
ordered four steam and sail paddle-wheelers built and began the
service in 1850, with Boston at the aft end of what Cunard captains
still call the Western crossing.
   But how in all thunderation did a Cunard ship wind up with a
name like the Vistafjord? Or the Sagafjord? Or Seagoddess I or II?
   In Sam Cunard's day and for almost 100 years all Cunarders had
names ending in ia: Saxonia, Media, Parthia, Lucania, Campania,
Franconia, Caronia. Nearly 200 of them, all the way from that first
paddle-wheeler, the Britannia, to the elegant four-stackers like
the Aquitania, the Lusitania and the Mauretania.
   Then along came the Queen Mary and that legend of how the litany
ended. Cunard favored the name Victoria for its first
1,000-foot-long superliner. During a grouse shoot at Balmoral
Castle, company director Lord Rydon asked King George V's
permission to name the new flagship for ``the most illustrious and
remarkable woman who has ever been queen of England.'' Not thinking
at all of his grandmother, his majesty replied: ``This is the
greatest compliment ever paid to my wife. I'll ask her as soon as I
get home.''
   A queen's whim altered the name of Cunard's current flagship,
which was to have been called the Queen Elizabeth, like its famous
predecessor. But at the moment of launching, Queen Elizabeth II
impulsively christened her Queen Elizabeth 2, insisting on the
Arabic numeral to avoid any thought that she was naming the ship
after herself.
   The former Norwegian American liners Vistafjord and Sagafjord
ran up Cunard's familiar ensign of a lion rampant after their
purchase in 1983. Most of their officers signed on with the new
owners, so that now Cunard's Fifth Avenue headquarters is staffed
by a number of Norwegian vice presidents and a couple of Swedes.
``What we call the Scandinavian Mafia,'' laughed Capt. Sverre
Brakstad of the Vistafjord who as a boy in Oslo never dreamed of
commanding a Cunarder. ``I thought you had to be born on the Clyde
or in Bristol.''
   Over a century and a half, Cunard's teakwood decks have echoed
to the tread of history and heaved and pitched with the waves of
ever-passing social change.
   In Samuel Cunard's lifetime, his ships reduced from six to two
weeks the time it took a letter to reach New York from London. They
carried the first great waves of Irish and German immigrants and
such illustrious passengers as Charles Dickens, Jenny Lind and Mark
Twain.
   Soon Cunard's trans-Atlantic ships doubled and tripled in size.
The Sophia was the first to boast ``electric illumination
throughout.'' Before the turn of the century, travel posters touted
the line's ``floating cities,'' the 600-foot-long Campania and
Lucania, with funnels ``as high as the Eddystone lighthouse.''
Marconi conducted wireless experiments aboard the Lucania, enabling
the first ship's newspaper to be slipped under cabin doors.
   In the early part of the 20th century, ``British stately homes
went to sea under the names Lusitania, Mauretania and Aquitania,''
as one critic described the luxuriant four-stackers.
   Then suddenly the Cunard saga was written in grim headlines, not
travel brochures: the Carpathia racing to pick up survivors of
competing White Star Line's flagship Titanic. The Lusitania going
to the bottom in 18 minutes with a loss of 1,198 lives, torpedoed
off the Irish coast by U-boat 20 on May 7, l915.
   Cunard lost 20 ships in World War I but won history's only sea
battle between ocean liners when the Carmania engaged the Cap
Trafalgar off the Brazilian coast, capsizing the Hamburg South
American liner after a deadly exchange between gun crews.
   Prohibition ushered in the popular ``booze cruises'' with Jazz
Age swingers such as Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald sailing off to
Havana or Nassau to slake their thirst.

   A Titan 4 missile blew up
at a rocket test site Friday, killing one person, leaving one
missing and sending up a huge mushroom cloud over the desert,
authorities said.
   The Titan 4 booster rocket exploded at the testing laboratory at
about 10:45 a.m., said Staff Sgt. Thomas Morgan.
   The blast left one person dead and one missing, said Lt. Col.
Rick Oborn, a spokesman at the Pentagon.
   Oborn said an initial report from the scene indicated that the
blast was due to the explosion of ``one of the stages of a Titan
missile booster.''
   The spokesman said one of the rocket's stages was being moved,
was somehow dislodged or dropped, and exploded upon impact.
   ``It appears to have been one of the solid fuel sections'' of
the booster, Oborn said.
   The resulting plume was moving away from populated areas at an
altitude that posed no immediate threat to residents, Morgan said.
   ``There was a big cloud of smoke. It was really bright,'' said
Roberta Martinson, clerk at a convenience store in Boron.
   Base officials contacted the California Highway Patrol, which
closed a 30-mile stretch of Highway 58. The road, which runs across
the north side of the base, was reopened a short time later.
   There were no evacuations of the area, 70 miles northeast of Los
Angeles, said Capt. Chris Angelo of the Kern County Fire
Department's Boron station.
   ``It was high enough that we felt it wouldn't come down,''
Angelo said.
   Titan 4s, built by Martin Marietta Corp., are considered the Air
Force's primary booster for launching its heavy payloads into space.
   The second Titan 4 built, worth $173 million, was launched June
8 from Cape Canaveral, Fla., carrying a secret surveillance
satellite into orbit. The first was launched on June 14, 1989,
boosting what analysts said was either a missile-warning satellite
or an electronic eavesdropping satellite.
   Ten launches had been planned during 1990-91, but six were
postponed because of delays in preparing launch sites and taking
delivery of the rockets. As of June, the Air Force said it planned
two more Titan 4 launches this year.
   The Pentagon also has said it plans to launch 10 Titan 4s
annually by 1995.
   The Air Force initially planned to build only 10 Titan 4s to
complement the space shuttle as a way to launch heavy payloads. But
the 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed
seven crew members prompted the Pentagon to decide to obtain many
more.
   The shuttle can put a 52,000-pound payload into orbit. The Titan
4, which stands 20 stories tall, can lift a 39,000-pound cargo into
low Earth orbit or a 10,000-pound payload to a fixed orbit 22,300
miles high.
   As of June, the Air Force had let contracts for construction of
41 Titan 4s, and had funds available for nine more. The service
planned to procure 100 Titan 4s by the year 2000.

   Atlantis settled into orbit under a
communications blackout after a dazzling night launch of the
Pentagon's last secret shuttle mission. The ship reportedly carried
a spy satellite aimed at Iraq.
   Riding a 700-foot column of yellow flame, the shuttle lifted
from its seaside launch pad at 6:48 p.m. Thursday, climbed smoothly
into darkness, slowly dimmed to a speeding star and then winked
from view more than 350 miles downrange.
   Atlantis' five-member, all-military crew reportedly planned to
release a satellite that will focus cameras or electronic signal
detectors on the Middle East, where American troops stand poised
against Iraq.
   A news blackout has been imposed on the mission, cutting off
public release of communications between the crew and Mission
Control. Only bare status reports will be issued during the
four-day flight.
   As of midday today, all appeared to be going well. ``That we're
not hearing anything means that the orbiter and crew are doing
fine,'' NASA spokeswoman Billie Deason said.
   It was the first flight in eight months for Atlantis, one of two
shuttles grounded during the summer because of hydrogen fuel leaks.
   Mission Control spokesman Jeff Carr described the launch as
``picture-perfect.''
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration chief Richard
Truly said it was ``just about as smooth a countdown and liftoff''
as he has ever seen. ``We've got a good bird, a healthy crew and a
good mission on the way,'' he said.
   The mission is the seventh and final secret military flight
planned for a shuttle. The Air Force has said that unmanned
rockets, principally the Titan 4, will be used in the future to
launch secret spy and communications satellites.
   Col. Frank Stirling, who heads the Titan 4 program, said
unmanned rockets offer greater reliability than NASA's fleet of
three and ultimately four shuttles.
   ``With Titan we have a continuing production line with many
Titans available, so that if we should ever have a problem or an
outage with the vehicle, we would still be able to recover and
continue operations,'' he said.
   The Pentagon will use the shuttle twice in 1991, but both
missions are unclassified.
   Atlantis' crew consists of Air Force Col. Richard Covey, mission
commander; Navy Cmdr. Frank Culbertson Jr., pilot; and Army Maj.
Charles Gemar, Air Force Lt. Col. Carl Meade and Marine Col. Robert
Springer, all mission specialists.
   Although details of Atlantis' mission are military secrets,
published reports have identified the cargo as a satellite that
will conduct either electronic eavesdropping or photo surveys of
the Persian Gulf area, including Iraq. The reports said that while
Atlantis was grounded because of the fuel leaks, the Air Force
satellite was modified for Middle East surveillance.
   Atlantis was the fifth of 37 shuttle flights to be launched in
darkness and the fifth shuttle mission of 1990, a year in which
NASA was plagued with shuttle problems.
   Atlantis and Columbia were grounded after dangerous hydrogen
leaks developed during launch attempts. In trying to solve the
problem, NASA replaced Atlantis' external fuel tank, some plumbing
and valve seals.
   Atlantis and Columbia were cleared for flight last month.
   NASA officials were clearly relieved Thursday night.
   ``It puts Atlantis back into flying status again,'' said launch
director Bob Sieck. ``In a few weeks, we expect to have Columbia
there too. So we'll have all three shuttles flying again.''
   The third shuttle, Discovery, flew last month. Columbia is being
prepared for launch in December.

<HEAD>Seized Research Vessel Likely To be Returned to Owners</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A research vessel that was part of the Titanic
exploration, seized under the government's ``zero-tolerance''
policy after a small amount of marijuana was found, will probably
be returned to its owners, officials say.
   Atlantis II was seized here Wednesday after a routine inspection
turned up traces of marijuana and two pipes in the shaving kit of
one of the ship's 25 crew members, a U.S. Customs Service spokesman
said Thursday.
   Spokesman Mike Fleming said it was clear the 210-foot vessel's
owners, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole,
Mass., ``were innocent parties. They've been extremely cooperative
in this matter.''
   Crew member Richard Morris, 27, of Buzzards Bay, Mass., pleaded
guilty Thursday to a misdemeanor charge of drug possession, said
Fleming. Morris was sentenced to a year of probation and fined $100.
   The vessel's owners are forwarding a letter to Customs
supporting the anti-drug effort and assuring officials they intend
to tighten security aboard the ship, Fleming said.
   ``Once we receive their agreement and their letter outlining the
procedures they will take, then we fully intend to return the
Atlantis II to the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution,'' he said.
   Atlantis II and its contents, including a three-person research
submarine named Alvin, are worth $80 million, Fleming said.
   Atlantis II arrived in San Diego Wednesday from Guatemala, where
it had stopped for supplies after geological and biological
research work near the Galapagos Islands, said Derek Spencer, the
institution's director of research.
   The seizure shocked the scientific community at Woods Hole,
where the ship is based, said Spencer.
   Construction of Atlantis II and Alvin was substantially funded
by federal research agencies, Spencer said. He noted that the
25-foot Alvin is owned by the Navy.
   Scientists aboard Atlantis II used Alvin in 1986 to explore and
photograph the North Atlantic site where the Titanic lies.
   The luxury liner went down 74 years ago after striking an
iceberg only five days into its maiden voyage. More than 1,500
people died. Scientists found the Titanic in September 1985 on a
joint U.S.-French expedition.
   At least 22 vessels have been seized across the country since
the zero-tolerance policy went into effect.

Robert D. Ballard headed up the discovery of two fabled sunken ships, the 
Titanic in 1985 and, just last month, the World War II German battleship 
Bismarck. In both cases, poignant reminders of human frailty persist on the 
dark, cold ocean floor, he says, lingering testaments to the dead, dragged far

"People say, 'What was it like to go to the Titanic, particularly out in the 
debris area, the stern section where everyone died?' " Ballard recalls of the 
ocean liner that sank to a depth of 12,000 feet in the North Atlantic in 1912, 
killing 1,500 of the 2,200 passengers and crew. "There are pairs of shoes all 
over there where people actually came to rest on the bottom of the ocean. Their 
shoes are still there. Shoes all over the Bismarck, boots all over the place. 
Animals won't eat processed leather. They eat the body and the clothes but they

Oceanographer Ballard, in Los Angeles to announce that he will host a 
television series about underwater explorations and other scientific ventures, 
is somewhere in the middle of a long explanation about why he pursues the 
sunken past with such avidity. Partly, he concedes, it's for the sensations 
that only discovery can provide. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Moment of Discovery 
</P>
<P>
"I think the thrill of exploration is to see something, to be the first to set 
eyes on something that has never been seen before," he says. "The first time I 
saw the Titanic, wow! There it was, this monstrous ship just came out of the 
gloom and there it was." 
</P>
<P>
For Ballard, the moment of discovery is intellectually kinetic -- an instant 
when he connects palpably with history. "The best experience that I can give 
that's sort of an analogy is like going to Custer's Last Stand," he says. "To 
go and stand where Custer stood and imagine, you know, bad day to be in the 
cavalry. That's the sense, it's your hallowed grounds. You sense Crazy Horse 
there . . . and you just realize the hopelessness of the situation. Well, when 
you're out at the Titanic and all of a sudden it happened right here. It's no 
longer abstract." 
</P>
<P>
Unknown territory, scientific and historic, has been Ballard's country for more 
than two decades, perhaps even as far back as his childhood in Southern 
California, when he was smitten by accounts of African exploration and became 
captivated by the Pacific Ocean. Now, four years after the discovery of the 
Titanic catapulted him from mere well-known scientist to global fame, the 
47-year-old seems to be in the throes of another transformation. This time 
around he apparently is eager to shape both the future and the past with the 
technology that he developed in more than a decade of underwater exploration. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he plans to use his new tools as the new host of National 
Geographic Explorer, a weekly two-hour program produced by National Geographic 
and Turner Broadcasting System Inc. It is the kind of popularizing of science 
that Ballard has been criticized for in the past by his peers. But Ballard says 
he sees his metamorphosis into TV personality as an educational mission that 
may help convince children that science is a "contact sport." 
</P>
<P>
Discussing the search for the Bismarck, Ballard obviously savors the contact 
with history and science. 
</P>
<P>
Because the Bismarck was engaged in a running battle hundreds of miles from 
land when it sank, neither the British nor the Germans were able -- or much 
interested -- in keeping precise records of their locations. So Ballard's 
expedition had to search about 150 square miles of ocean floor, initially with 
sonar and then with remote control, computerized robot sensors and cameras 
controlled from a surface ship before locating the wreck June 8. (This kind of 
exploration isn't cheap, Ballard notes, joking that "we had 100,000 pounds of 
equipment and 10 vans and six robots and a partridge in a pear tree.") 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand that the Bismarck battle was waged in a Force 8 sea -- 
50-knot winds, 15-foot waves -- (with) overcast and no celestial navigation," 
Ballard says. 
</P>
<P>
The search for the Bismarck -- which, like the Titanic, sank on its maiden 
voyage -- was further complicated by the nature of the Atlantic Ocean. The 
battleship was in "16,000 feet of water and it was in a mountain range," 
Ballard says, not without enthusiasm. "It was in an awful place and it was in 
the northern latitudes, up at 48 degrees North latitude, which is not a nice 
stretch of ocean -- ever, even in the summer." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties, Ballard was drawn to the wreck because, like the 
Titanic, it is one of the most famous lost chunks of history to litter the 
ocean floor. "I do it because of the challenge to do it," he says. "But I'm 
also interested in the fact that this ship is well preserved. . . . There is 
probably more history preserved in the deep oceans of the world than in all the 
museums of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Although it has lost its gun turrets and was hit by numerous shells and 
torpedoes, the Bismarck still has touches of freshness, Ballard adds, citing 
the "huge painted swastikas" on the ship's bow and stern. 
</P>
<P>
In its day, the 50,000-ton Bismarck, with heavy armor, eight 15-inch guns 
capable of firing one-ton shells 24 miles and high-performance diesel engines, 
was one of the most powerful warships afloat. And briefly it proved to be just 
that. Slipping out of its home port of Danzig (now Gdynia) on May 18, 1941 to 
attack Allied convoys, the Bismarck soon had much of the British Royal Navy 
looking for it. At the time England faced a victorious Germany alone and was 
dependent on convoys from America for most of its food and war material. 
Discovered by two British heavy cruisers 
</P>
<P>
on May 23, the Bismarck was engaged the next day by two other British warships. 
From a distance of 25,000 yards, the Bismarck's huge shells hit the Hood, 
starting a fire in an ammunition locker. Within minutes the Hood exploded, 
killing all but three of the ship's 1,400 crew members. The Prince of Wales was 
also damaged. 
</P>
<P>
Of the Bismarck, "the British were lucky to get it to the bottom," Ballard 
claims. In the climactic battle, a "freak hit" by a torpedo launched from a 
vintage World War I biplane knocked out the Bismarck's steering, forcing the 
crippled battleship to "wait for the British to come and get it." Of course, 
the British came and the Bismarck was sunk in the Atlantic about 600 miles west 
of France. 
</P>
<P>
Since the discovery of the Bismarck, Ballard says there has been curiosity 
about what actually caused the ship to sink -- British firepower or scuttling 
by her own crew. But Ballard believes the evidence makes the point moot. The 
British warships had orders to sink the Bismarck, not capture it, and the 
Germans were under orders not to let the pride of their fleet be taken as a war 
prize, he says. 
</P>
<P>
At 10 a.m. on May 27, the captain of the Bismarck ordered his crew to open the 
seacocks on his disabled ship, thus flooding the hull, Ballard recounts. About 
10:30 a.m., the Bismarck was hit by three torpedoes from the British cruiser 
Dorsetshire and sank three minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bismarck's Survivors 
</P>
<P>
"So it was on its way down and the torpedoes helped -- but it was on its way 
down," Ballard says. "If they hadn't opened the seacocks, I'm convinced the 
British would have sat there and plunked torpedoes into it until it sank. So 
it's sort of academic who sank it." Only about 100 of the Bismarck's crew 
survived. Nearly 2,300 perished, including several hundred who were swimming in 
the water after their ship disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
It is that moment that seems to galvanize Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Bismarck sank, approximately 800 living souls went into the water and 
were alive after the ship went under," he says, leaning forward in his chair. 
"And the Dorsetshire came in and began picking up survivors and then someone 
thought they saw a periscope and they took off and they left 700 people in the 
water alive. . . . Can you imagine the awfulness, the hopelessness, the despair 
of the sailor who's just had a ship blown out from underneath him? He's 
paddling and freezing to death in this water and salvation is right there and 
he's grabbing hold of the hull and the ship takes off." 
</P>
<P>
Ballard has said he will not reveal the exact location of the Bismarck except 
to German authorities. As a ship of war, the battleship belongs to Germany, he 
says, although there might be some debate about which half of that divided 
country would have the more legitimate claim. 
</P>
<P>
As with the Titanic, Ballard says he strongly believes that such relatively 
recent wrecks should be left undisturbed, memorials to those who perished. As 
for wrecks from the dim reaches of the past, Ballard argues that they should be 
explored only by qualified archeologists intent on broadening historical 
knowledge. In fact, he still becomes visibly angry that private expeditions to 
the Titanic took some artifacts from the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Developed Deep-Sea Robots 
</P>
<P>
But Ballard seems to be chiefly an enthusiast, not a critic. In particular he 
is a proponent of machines, especially robots. Ballard has headed up the 
development of a system of deep-sea unmanned robots -- called the Argo-Jason 
system. Equipped with cameras and other sensing devices, the robots are now 
capable of plumbing the world's deep waters faster and more safely than the 
tiny, slow, manned submarines that previously were the cutting edge of ocean 
research and exploration, he says. 
</P>
<P>
While an unmanned robot named Jason Jr. was used in a 1986 expedition to the 
Titanic, it was only within the last few months that the leap was made "to 
fully robotic exploration," Ballard says, meaning that robots can now be 
directed from a surface ship rather than from a manned submarine via a control 
cable. 
</P>
<P>
It's a relief that he and others won't have to spend five or more hours per day 
"commuting" to the ocean floor, which averages 12,000 feet in depth, he says. 
Even though he has spent a lot of time in cramped research submarines and 
probably will spend more, Ballard is miffed by the inefficiency of the 
"romantic little guys," referring to the small submarines. 
</P>
<P>
He explains: ". . . you're spending five hours a day freezing to death in this 
little sphere. Our average dive time on the Titanic was three hours a day. 
Three hours out of 24 and you've got 50 people and you've got one guy looking 
out of a window." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Interest in Science 
</P>
<P>
Ballard has been talking about the potential of this technology for years. But 
recent advances have made him more convinced than ever that the concept of 
"telepresence" will revolutionize not only undersea exploration but the way 
many people "travel." More important, he sees the technology as capable of 
rekindling interest in science among American schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"We're now reaching a point in technology, in imaging devices both acoustic and 
visual, fiber optic transmission links, digital enhancement, computer 
manipulation, robotics etc, etc. to simulate presence," he says in a gee-whiz 
way. "In fact many of us in the technology believe it will become a pervasive 
way of people living their lives. In other words, ultimately you won't travel 
that much. You'll travel in a telepresence way. We can have this conversation 
half a world apart and you'll sense my presence, I'll sense yours. . . . The 
idea of the Argo-Jason system is to put you in a room and convince you you're 
in a submarine looking out a bunch of windows" that are in fact video monitors 
displaying scenes picked up by robot-mounted cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Ballard, whose professional base is the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution on 
Massachusetts' Cape Cod, is such a believer in the concept of telepresence that 
he's already using it to change the way he lives. He recently built a house 
near Montana's Glacier National Park in which he is installing a satellite 
antenna so that he can bounce his image and voice into space and back to Earth 
for professional meetings and conversations with people far, far away. His goal 
is "to create a place where I don't feel professionally inconvenienced by 
living in Montana." 
</P>
<P>
How much time he actually will spend in northern Montana is an open question, 
though, given the demands of the Explorer television series. 
</P>
<P>
With the series, including a program on the Bismarck to be broadcast in late 
October, Ballard asserts that he can do his bit to instill a respect for the 
past and take millions on magical mystery tours of the kingdoms under the sea. 
</P>
<P>
". . . 70% of the planet's under water. We've seen less than .1% of 1%. I mean 
we know more about the mountain ranges on Mars than the mountain ranges of our 
own planet," he says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Vast Unknown 
</P>
<P>
It is this sense of the vast unknown here on Earth that he wants to 
communicate. 
</P>
<P>
"To me the concept of an explorer has been somewhat diminished," he says. 
"People now retrace Hannibal's route in a Winnebago or they walk backwards to 
the North Pole. It's sort of become a Guinness Book of World Records type of 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
And he says he wants to do his part to protect good old people-friendly dry 
land too. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very important right now to realize that the Earth is in jeopardy and 
we're the first generation that can kill it and we're killing it," he says, 
leaving the battles of World War II far behind. ". . . This baloney about 
living in space is baloney. You send everyone else out there and give me 
Montana. I have no desire to live underwater. I've seen the place."

   The Air Force is
spending $90 million to rebuild a launch pad for its new Titan 4
rockets, which will take secret military payloads into space, an
official said.
   Space Launch Complex-4 East has been used for Titan 34D launches
since 1982 and was rebuilt after one exploded in April 1986.
   The Titan 4 will carry payloads previously intended for the space
shuttle. Vandenberg's shuttle pad was dismantled in the aftermath of
the Challenger disaster.
   The 1986 explosion of the Titan 34D destroyed what was reportedly
a spy satellite and put the launch pad and one close by out of
commission for more than a year.
   The Air Force spent $50 million to rebuild the two pads so it
could continue launching the Titan 34Ds, said Col. John E. Angell,
who is in charge of Air Force space launches from Vandenberg.
   The launch pads were further rebuilt to handle the Titan 4
launches, he said.
   The first Titan 4 launched at Vandenberg likely will carry a $1
billion KH-12 spy satellite, said John Pike, a space policy expert
with the Federation of American Scientists.
   The reconnaissance satellite is capable of taking sharp
photographs of the Earth's surface through clouds, he said.

Flight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Leaking rocket fuel
forced the evacuation of a Titan 2 launch pad during the weekend,
the Air Force said Tuesday.
   The Air Force declined to confirm whether the mishap Sunday
delayed the classified launch of four Navy spy satellites.
   John Pike, a space policy expert at the Washington-based
Federation of American Scientists, said last week that a classified
Titan 2 launch was expected soon.
   He said the one-time intercontinental ballistic missile, in its
maiden flight as a space booster, was almost certain to carry into
orbit a set of four White Cloud Navy Ocean Surveillance System
satellites designed to eavesdrop on radio and radar transmissions
by the Soviet fleet.
   The Air Force and Martin Marietta Corp. have previously said
that Space Launch Complex 4 West will be used to launch refurbished
Titan 2s carrying military payloads.
   ``We had a minor vapor escape of monomethyl hydrazine at Space
Launch Complex 4 West this weekend,'' said Capt. John Sullivan, a
spokesman for the Air Force Space and Missile Test Organization at
this military base 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   ``The leak was detected by our sensors and the pad was evacuated
with our safety procedures,'' he added. ``The vapor dispersed
harmlessly into the atmosphere. At no time was there any danger to
the base or community population'' in nearby Vandenberg Village or
the neighboring city of Lompoc.
   Sullivan emphasized the leak wasn't serious, but said he didn't
know how many people were evacuated from the launch pad.
   He also declined comment on whether a Titan 2 was being loaded
with the hydrazine fuel to prepare it for a classified launch.
   For about 25 years, Titan 2 rockets served as ICBMs, each
carrying a nine-megaton hydrogen warhead. Maintenance and safety
problems spurred removal of the obsolete missiles from their silos
in Arkansas, Kansas and Arizona.
   The Air Force has ordered 13 Titan 2s reconditioned as space
boosters under a $528.9 million contract with Martin Marietta
because it was cheaper than building new rockets.

<F P=106> [Jozsef Szabo Bartha report: "Csurka Supports Csucs's </F>
Nomination in Mohacs -- The MIEP's Budapest Elections List Is 
Complete"] 
  [Text] The unlawful police actions against the Hungarian 
Justice and Life Party [MIEP] have become tendentious. The 
latest incident occurred on 18 February, when the MIEP's 
petition for a referendum was confiscated in the underpass at 
the Nyugati railroad station, MIEP Cochairman Lajos Horvath 
announced at the party's news conference on 23 February. 
  He said that a MIEP member who tried to clear up the matter 
immediately after this police action was ejected from the police 
station, being told "walkies outside, why should we deal with 
such a matter, you will not win the elections anyway!" In the 
MIEP's view, it is not impossible that police patrols had been 
given orders to act against the collection of signatures. A 
letter has been sent to National Police Chief Sandor Pinter 
asking him to investigate the responsibility for this 
politically motivated act. 
  In connection with the elections, it was said at the news 
conference that the Budapest list is complete and the number of 
their individual candidates exceeds 140. They are delaying the 
publication of the list of names because running in MIEP colors 
involves the threat of losing one's job in a number of cases. 
  They are willingly to support Laszlo Csucs, deputy chairman 
of Hungarian Radio, if he runs as an independent candidate in 
Mohacs [southern Hungary]. Similarly, they would also be happy 
to support Gabor Nahlik, deputy chairman of Hungarian 
Television, either as a MIEP or as an independent candidate. 
  Answering NEPSZABADSAG's question in connection with the 
Hungarian Democratic Forum's [MDF] National Convention last 
weekend, [MIEP Co-Chairman Istvan] Csurka stated: "The MDF's 
ship is already nose down in the sea. We are lucky that we had 
been removed from this Titanic before it started to sink. The 
current three captains will not be able to repair the hole that 
was caused by the previous captain Jozsef Antall when the ship 
collided with the iceberg of the pact."

   A Titan 34D rocket
thundered into space with a secret cargo during the weekend, and one
expert said it probably carried a pair of military communication
satellites into orbit.
   The 16-story-tall booster blasted off Sunday morning, said Air
Force Capt. John Sullivan, a spokesman for the sprawling Vandenberg
military base on the coast 140 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
   As usual for military space flights, the Air Force didn't
announce the launch in advance and declined to identify its payload.
   However, it most likely carried two Satellite Data System
satellites, although it also might have carried either a KH-9 or
KH-11 photo reconnaissance satellite, said John Pike, a space policy
expert for the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists.
   Pike, who knew about the launch in advance, said Friday the data
system satellites are used for military communications.
   The satellites provide ``a way for the president to stay in touch
with our nuclear forces ... to give bombers and (silo-based crews
operating) missiles the `go code''' to launch nuclear warheads, he
said.
   Pike said two SDS satellites were ``launched five years ago.
They're due for replacement.''
   SDS and KH-series satellites are the only types launched from
Vandenberg on Titan 34Ds, he said.
   ``The reason I think it's SDS is I don't think the Air Force has
any more KH-9s or KH-11s,'' Pike said.
   The Titan 34D, America's most powerful space booster, will be
supplanted by the Titan 4, due for its maiden launch next year from
Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   The last launch of a Titan 34D was from Cape Canaveral on Sept.
2, but sources told The Associated Press it failed to place its
payload in orbit.
   Pike described that payload as a satellite designed to monitor
Soviet missile tests and radio, telephone, radar and other
electronic communications.
   Two Titan 34Ds were launched successfully in late 1987. Before
then, they were grounded following two straight explosions during
launches on Aug. 28, 1985, and April 18, 1986, destroying a KH-11
and a KH-9.

<TEXT>
   America's mightiest unmanned space
rocket, a Titan 4, blasted off today with a secret military payload.
   It was the second launch of a Titan 4. The giant rocket boosted a
missile-warning satellite into orbit in June 1989.
   The rocket was launched at 1:22 a.m. EDT from Cape Canaveral Air
Force Station, lighting up the sky as it thundered toward orbit.
   The Air Force refused to discuss or even acknowledge the flight
until about 20 minutes later, when a statement was issued. The
payload was not disclosed.
   ``This was an important launch for America's space program,''
said Martin C. Faga, the Air Force's assistant secretary for space.
``The Titan 4 is the largest booster ever launched by the Air Force.
... The Titan 4 provides our nation a vital path to space for
critical national security payloads.''
   John Pike, director of the Federation of American Scientists'
space policy project, said the rocket's cargo probably is a $500
million electronic eavesdropping satellite capable of intercepting
missile telemetry and radio communications.
   A less likely possibility, Pike said, is that it is a
missile-warning satellite.
   Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems has a $7.1 billion contract
with the Air Force to supply 41 Titan 4 rockets, with an option for
eight more. The Air Force ordered the rocket in 1985 to lessen its
dependency on NASA's manned space shuttle.
   The shuttle is the most powerful cargo carrier used by the United
States, capable of putting a 52,000-pound payload into orbit. The
Titan 4, an expendable launch vehicle, can lift a 39,000-pound
payload into low Earth orbit or carry 10,000 pounds to stationary
orbit 22,300 miles high.
   The Titan 4 stands 20 stories tall and is powered by two liquid
fuel main engines and two solid rocket boosters. One of the engine's
nozzles malfunctioned in last year's launch, but the other nozzle
compensated and the rocket remained on target.
   The Air Force plans to launch future Titan 4 rockets from Cape
Canaveral and Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
   Ten Titan 4 rockets originally were to have been launched by
October. The U.S. General Accounting Office criticized the program
in a report last month, citing schedule delays and $209 million in
cost overruns as of July 1989.
   Martin Marietta said it is working to improve production and cut
costs.
   The Denver company encountered problems with a commercial Titan 3
launch in March. An engineering design error caused the rocket's
cargo, an Intelsat communications satellite, to be placed in a
uselessly low orbit.
   Intelsat's board of governors will decide at a meeting in
Barbados this week and next whether to pay the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration for a shuttle rescue mission, which could
exceed $130 million. The Washington-based consortium of 119
countries operates a global communications system.
   A commercial Titan 3 is scheduled to carry another Intelsat
communications satellite into orbit on June 21.

   The nation's most powerful unmanned
rocket failed to lift a secret military satellite into the proper
orbit, effectively rendering it useless, according to a source
close to the space program.
   Engineers were trying to determine whether they could salvage
the satellite launched atop a 16-story Titan 34D Friday morning,
the source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said late Friday
night.
   However, the source was not hopeful anything could be done to
place it in the correct orbit.
   A civilian expert has said the booster carried a satellite that
could eavesdrop on Soviet military and diplomatic communications.
   A successful launch would have been the third in a row for the
Titan 34D, which was grounded for 18 months after two explosions.
   Lt. Col. Ron Rand, director of public affairs at the Eastern
Space and Missile Center here, said the Air Force had a policy of
not commenting on the results of military space launches.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Maj. William O'Connell said he
knew of no problem with the launch.
   The three-stage Titan 34D roared away from its launch pad here
at 8:05 a.m Friday.
   The booster's third stage ignited correctly, putting the
satellite in a highly elliptical orbit ranging from 100 miles to
22,300 miles above the Earth, the source said.
   But the rocket failed to re-ignite, which would have put the
payload in a geosynchronous, or stationery, orbit 22,330 miles over
the Equator, said the source.
   A military reconnaissance satellite would be useless unless it
was in a geosynchronous orbit.
   The Air Force, following its practice of recent years, did not
announce the launch in advance, but issued a statement afterward.
   John E. Pike, a space policy expert for the Washington-based
Federation of American Scientists, said last month the payload
would be a satellite designed to monitor Soviet missile tests and
monitor radio, telephone, radar and other electronic military and
diplomatic communications.
   He said the satellite carried an antenna built to unfold to the
size of a baseball field.
   The launch was the third for the Titan 34D, which will remain
the nation's most powerful unmanned rocket until an upgraded
version, the Titan 4, makes its launch debut later this year, also
with a military satellite. Both are made by Martin Marietta Corp.
in Denver.
   A Titan 34D carrying a reconnaissance satellite was launched
successfully last October from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.
Another blasted away from Cape Canaveral a month later and placed
into orbit a satellite to provide warning of a hostile missile
attack.
   Before the October launch, the Titan 34D had been grounded for
18 months following two straight explosions of the rocket.
   ``These two launches (from Canaveral) and last October's launch
(from Vandenberg) illustrate the success of America's return to a
more robust space-launch capability,'' the Air Force said in its
post-launch statement.
   During the long Titan 34D grounding, the Air Force was unable to
lift heavy military satellites into orbit because the only other
available carrier, the manned space shuttle, was grounded because
of the Challenger explosion in January 1986.
   That led to a critical backlog of military payloads waiting to
get into space. To help break that logjam, the Air Force is backing
development of Titan 4, Titan 2 and Delta 2 rocket systems. They
will make their first launches either late this year or early next
year, and are expected to see considerable use over several years.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS: Titanic Memories: Letter From an 11-Year-Old </HL>
<AUTHOR> Nicholas King, Falls Church, Va. </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<TEXT>
   The folded sheet of pale gray writing paper bore the red-and-white pennant of the White Star Line over the words, in dark blue, "On board R.M.S. 'Titanic,'" and the date was April 10, 1912. 

   Below, the space was filled with a child's loops and swoops and misspellings in pencil. 
"Dear Lusia," it began -- the writer meant Louisa -- and it went on to describe "the biggest ship in the world, with its gymnasium, its swimming pool and its Turkish baths." 

   Then the 11-year-old girl who wrote it told how the Titanic, outward bound from its berth in Southampton on its maiden voyage to New York, ran afoul of the cables of another ship, the Olympic. 
It soon got clear and proceeded into the English Channel. 
"It's quite calm now," she wrote innocently, "No one has been sick so far." 

   The letter belongs to Eileen Schefer, a distinguished and self-possessed 86-year-old Englishwoman who has lived here for many years, the widow of retired diplomat and school director Edward Schefer. 
Her abode is a yellow-and-white farmhouse, an anachronism in this densely populated Washington suburb, set in an acre of old trees and enclosed by a wooden paddock fence and beyond it by rows of small brick dwellings in geometric plots. 
The house is filled with graceful Victorian furniture and family portraits in gilt oval frames, as remote from its surroundings as the Titanic would be from the life of the ocean today. 

   But there seems to be a mystery. 
The lady is a survivor of the Titanic, of which there were some and are now still a few. 
But who ever saw a letter from on board that survived? 
Women and children may have been rescued, but no one ever heard of a mail sack being dumped into the life boats. 
How did Mrs. Schefer come to be sitting in her house in Falls Church with the letter she wrote 76 years ago in her hand? 

   What happened was that the letter was taken off the Titanic at the Irish port of Cobh or Queenstown, where transatlantic liners used to stop for that purpose. 
Eileen Lenox-Conyngham, as she then was, and her mother, an aunt and her younger brother, Dennis, went on to France, where they disembarked at Cherbourg, the traditional port of call for British liners, five hours after they left Southampton. 

   Because the Lenox-Conynghams had no luggage to unpack or worry about other than what was needed for a brief vacation, they had time to roam over the ship, hence Eileen's vivid memory of it. 
"The maiden-voyage flowers were beautiful; The officers and deckhands very kind to us." 

   A few days later, after the family visited Chartres, Eileen was horrified, on her arrival in Paris, to see huge headlines announcing the fateful news. 
"Le Roi des Vaissaux Blesse a Mort" said one of them -- "The Monarch of Ships Mortally Wounded." 

   The Louisa of the letter was the family's young nursery maid in their home in Suffolk, where the Rev. George Lenox-Conyngham, Eileen's father, had a parish. 
Louisa later married the gardener, and it was their daughter, Patricia Kent, now 62 and a widow too, who found the long-forgotten document among some family papers. 
She was told it was valuable -- it was indeed: It sold at auction last fall for $1,700 and was bought on Mrs. Schefer's behalf by her nephew. 
She and her son wonder if it should not be framed in double glass (it is temporarily safe in an acetate folder) so the whole thing can be seen. 

   Mrs. Schefer has been in touch with the Titanic Historical Society, which is planning a reunion of survivors in Boston in September. 
The society has invited her and her son Anton to be present and they are looking forward to it. 

   There is one question left: Why did the Lenox-Conynghams embark on such an enormous vessel as the Titanic merely to cross the Channel? 
"Well you see," Mrs. Schefer says, "we were very poor sailors and easily got seasick. 
My father thought that if only the ship were big enough we couldn't have too rough a trip."

<TEXT>
   Underwater scientist Robert D. Ballard is
becoming host of ``National Geographic Explorer'' on SuperStation
TBS because he says the movie and television image of scientists is
driving young people away from science careers.
   ``We're going to change the show's emphasis to more live
exploration,'' said Ballard, the man who found the Titanic and the
Bismarck and recently led an expedition to a sunken Roman ship. That
effort was telecast live to several hundred thousand youngsters in
12 museums across the country.
   His discovery of the Nazi battleship Bismarck, resting upright in
15,000 feet of water about 600 miles west of Brest, France, will be
shown in an October episode of the weekly ``Explorer'' series. The
fabled World War II ship was sunk in a battle with British naval
forces on May 27, 1941. Ballard found the ship June 8.
   ``I want to motivate children and show them that science is a
contact sport,'' said Ballard, who will become host in September.
``We've created an image that scientists are nerds. And that's
created a devastating effect on interest in science as a career.
   ``The battle for children's minds is between grades four to 12.
Right now 50 percent of all the students in American colleges
studying sciences are foreign students. We're now 17th in the world
in science literacy, behind Spain, Hungary and Ireland and
hopelessly behind Germany, Japan, England and the Scandinavian
countries.''
   He warned that if more American students don't become interested
in science the United States will slip economically, industrially
and militarily.
   ``The image children have of scientists is that of a harebrained,
forgetful wacko that they get from movies like `Back to the
Future,''' said Ballard. ``Children want to fit in with their peer
groups, they don't want to look like some silly guy.''
   Ballard is more in the mold of Indiana Jones. He has participated
in or led more than 60 deep-sea expeditions. He is a senior
scientist in the Ocean Engineering Department of the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, head of the Deep Submergence Laboratory
and director of the institution's Center for Marine Exploration.
   The 50,000-ton Bismarck was the biggest battleship launched by a
European power and was such a threat to the Allies that British
Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered an all-out effort to ``sink
the Bismarck.''
   The Bismarck sank the British battle cruiser Hood on May 24,
1941, but two days later British torpedo planes damaged the ship's
steering gear and rudders. The crucial battle came the next day.
   ``The Germans lost their main guns and control in the battle,''
said Ballard. ``The captain ordered the ship scuttled at 10 o'clock.
She was equipped with the latest in military technology and he
didn't want the ship captured. The ship was struck by more torpedoes
at 10:36 and sank three minutes later. Of 2,200 crewmen aboard the
Bismarck, only about 115 survived.
   ``The ship capsized and its gun turrets, which were held in place
by their weight, fell out. She landed upright and other than the
missing turrets and some superstructure damage she is in remarkable
condition. The Nazi swastikas are still visible on her deck.''
   The Bismarck was examined by the deep-sea robot Argo, which
Ballard also used to find the Titanic four years ago. The robot is
equipped with sonar, video cameras and still cameras. Pictures taken
by Argo, its tender and the mother ship on the surface will be used
in the ``Explorer'' program in October.
   The Jason Project in the Mediterranean Sea explored a 3rd Century
Roman ship and undersea volcanoes. Six one-hour shows of the
exploration were sent live by satellite to 12 museums in a two-week
period. Each museum had an exact replica of the control facilities
aboard the other ship so that the youngsters saw exactly what
Ballard saw only one-half second later.
   Future live television projects will take Ballard to the Great
Lakes to look for two ships sunk in the War of 1812, to Lake
Champlain to look for a gunboat sunk in the Revolutionary War, to
the Pacific off Okinawa to explore the Japanese battleship Yamata
and to the Pacific to examine the Japanese aircraft carriers that
attacked Pearl Harbor and were sunk in the Battle of Midway.
   ``We have a large program of exploration lined up and will have
the continued involvement of young people,'' Ballard said. ``We'll
take some children into the field, but most will participate by
telepresence. It will almost be like being there because they will
be surrounded by video pictures. On the Great Lakes project we will
have joy sticks in the museums that will let the youngsters actually
control the robot.''

<HEAD>First Titan 4 Space Rocket Moved To Launch Pad</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first of the Air Force's
powerful new $150 million Titan 4 space rockets was transported to
a launch pad Saturday under curious censorship.
   The 20-story-tall rocket, the largest unmanned booster in the
U.S. space stable, is scheduled to make its maiden flight next
October, boosting a classified military reconnaissance satellite.
   Development of the Titan 4 was accelerated following the
explosion that destroyed space shuttle Challenger in 1986. The
grounding of the shuttle fleet left several critical national
security payloads without a way to get into space, and many of
those will be hoisted by the new rocket.
   The Air Force, which held a media extravaganza here in January
when the first rocket was delivered and its launch pad was
dedicated, originally said the news media would be escorted to the
pad to cover Saturday's rollout.
   But Air Force Secretary Edward C. Aldrich, who presided at the
January festivity, ruled the media out earlier this week, with the
Pentagon explaining only that, ``the launch sequence of military
launch vehicles is not typically an item of public discussion.''
   But when the decision was made Saturday to move the Titan 4, Air
Force public affairs officials alerted the news media at their
homes by phone. They also made arrangements to release photographs,
film and videotape of the move.
   Air Force Lt. Col. Ron Rand, director of public affairs at the
Eastern Space and Missile Center, replied, ``absolutely none,''
when asked if there were any security or safety reasons for barring
the press Saturday.
   A Titan 34D, predecessor of the Titan 4, is being readied on an
adjacent pad for a secret military launching, but Rand said that
had no bearing on the ruling.
   The rocket was visible for miles during its 45-minute move to
the launch pad from an assembly building. The closest point for the
public to see it was about six miles away.
   The launch pad debuts of previous space rockets have been open
to news coverage here.
   Martin Marietta is building 23 Titan 4s for the Air Force at its
plant near Denver. The Pentagon is seeking millions in public funds
to build an additional 27 boosters.
   Col. Lawrence Gooch, commander of the Eastern Space and Missile
Center, issued a statement saying, ``The rollout of the Titan 4 is
another major step toward recovering our space launch capability.''
   From Washington, Aldrich said, ``The Titan 4 program is one of
the cornerstones of our national security stategy to rebuild
assured access to space. This booster represents the new workhorse
of space for our nation.''
   For the next several months, a team of specialists from the Air
Force and Martin Marietta Astronautics Group will check the
compatibility of the rocket with the new launch pad and prepare the
vehicle for launch.
   The Air Force plans to launch two Titan 4 rockets a year from
Cape Canaveral to boost military satellites for such assignments as
reconnaissance, communications and communications intercept. Other
launches are scheduled from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif.
   The Titan 4 can boost 32,000-pound payloads into low Earth orbit
and 10,000 pounds to stationary orbit 22,300 miles high, where most
military satellites are based.

   The long-delayed launch debuts of two
new military space rockets, the Delta 2 and Titan 4, should occur
within two months as the Air Force prepares for what could be the
busiest launch year here since 1983, an official said Tuesday.
   The commander of the Eastern Space and Missile Center, Air Force
Col. Lawrence L. Gooch, said the Delta 2, carrying a pair of
military navigation satellites, is set for liftoff Feb. 7, with the
Titan 4, which will be America's most powerful unmanned rocket, to
follow within a few weeks.
   Gooch told reporters the current schedule for 1989 calls for
seven Delta 2s, two commercial Delta 2s and one Delta 1; two Titan
4s, two smaller Titan 34Ds and two commercial Titan 3s; two
commercial Atlas-Centaurs and one with a Navy communications
satellite, and six to eight submarine test launches of the Navy's
powerful new Trident 2 nuclear missiles.
   In addition, the missile center will support seven NASA space
shuttle launchings during 1989, starting with Discovery on Feb. 23.
   The schedule of 32 to 34 launches would be the busiest here since
1983, when there were 60. There were 26 in 1987.
   But launch slippages and a shortage of manpower could hold down
the total, Gooch said. ``With luck we could support that rate, but
if we can get 70 percent up, we will have earned our pay.''
   The Air Force decided to build the Delta 2 and to greatly
increase its Titan 4 order following the explosion of space shuttle
Challenger in 1986.
   Both the Pentagon and NASA had been phasing out unmanned rockets
and putting all launch eggs into one basket, the shuttle. After
Challenger, officials realized this was a mistake and they ordered
expendable rockets to give the nation assured access to space.
   Gooch estimated that 40 space payloads have backed up, waiting
for a rocket ride, as a result of the 32-month shuttle standdown
after the shuttle accident and because of the grounding of the Titan
34D for several months after back-to-back failures in 1885 and 1986.
About 25 of those are satellites vital to national defense, he said.
   Gooch said the range may have problems supporting the schedule if
there are delays in a lot of the missions.
   Citing the Trident 2 submarine launches, the first of which is
scheduled in about two months, he said, ``If you have a Trident sub
at sea, and it comes in here for demonstration firings, that's a lot
of resources and involves a national defense commitment.''
   In most cases, the Trident launch probably would have priority
over all except the most critical defense satellite launches.
   The maiden launch of the Delta 2 already has been delayed six
months and the debut of the Titan 4 about five months by problems
preparing the new rockets and their refurbished launch pads.
   Another problem, Gooch said, could be a shortage of manpower to
support launches. He said he has asked the Pentagon for about 100
skilled people to add to the 200 he now has in his test operations
group.

<TEXT>
   The Air Force has decided to convert a
mothballed $3.5 billion space shuttle dock into a backup pad for
launches of the Titan 4-Centaur rocket.
   The Pentagon said Friday the multimillion dollar conversion of
Space Launch Complex-6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base will start
after Oct. 1.
   The first launch of Titan 4 rockets equipped with Centaur
upper-stage boosters at the pad is expected in 1996, the Pentagon
said.
   The Air Force believes the pad is needed in case an accident
ever cripples Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex-4 East, which will
be used early next year for the first West Coast launch of a Titan
4 without a Centaur upper stage, Col. Charles F. Sterling, Titan 4
program director, said in a statement.
   Sterling cited the 1985 explosion of a Titan 34D rocket that
temporarily halted use of another launch pad.
   But a critic predicted the pad will never be used because
Congress will refuse to pay for the costly military communications
and surveillance satellites meant to be launched on Titan
4-Centaurs.
   ``They've been working on this launch pad for more than two
decades and it still hasn't launched anything,'' space policy
analyst John Pike said Friday by telephone from the Federation of
American Scientists, a public interest group in Washington. ``They
just want to keep pouring concrete.''
   The conversion of SLC-6 will cost $300 million to $500 million,
and will be faster, cheaper and environmently safer than building a
new launch complex for up to $800 million, said Maj. Tom Worsdale,
a Vandenberg spokesman.
   Pike said he believed the conversion will cost far more. He said
the decision ``effectively forecloses ever flying the shuttle from
California.''
   The cost of Titan 4 and Titan 4-Centaurs ranges from $173
million to $265 million each, according to various Air Force and
General Accounting Office estimates.

   A Titan 4, the workhorse rocket that
will let the Pentagon reduce its dependence on the space shuttle,
lifted into orbit what was believed to be a satellite capable of
warning against missile attack.
   The 20-stories-tall Titan, America's mightiest unmanned rocket,
lit up NASA's two shuttle launch pads a few miles away - one
occupied by Atlantis, the other by Columbia - as it headed out over
the Atlantic on Monday night.
   The launch had been delayed two months by problems that included
leaking propellant.
   Air Force officials refused even to acknowledge the launch prior
to liftoff and would not disclose the nature of the payload, but
civilian experts said they believed it was a $180 million missile
warning satellite.
   A spacecraft of this type could be used to detect instantly the
launch of Iraqi missiles against sites in the Middle East, said
John Pike, director of the Federation of American Scientists' space
policy project.
   It was the Air Force's third launch of the Titan 4, valued at
$173 million. The first one was in 1989, and the second one in
June. Neither had a similar leak problem, said Col. Frank Stirling,
director of the Titan program.
   Martin Marietta Space Launch Systems of Denver has a $7.1
billion contract with the Air Force to supply 41 Titan 4 rockets,
with an option for eight more. The Air Force wants 75 by the end of
1997.
   The Air Force ordered the rocket in 1985 to lessen its
dependence on the pace shuttle.
   A fleet of Titans will allow the Air Force to launch with more
consistency, Stirling said. ``Should we ever have a problem or an
outage with the vehicle, we would still be able to recover and
continue operations,'' he said.
   Atlantis' flight on Thursday, during which it will put into
orbit a military satellite, is the last classified Pentagon shuttle
mission.
   Two more Defense Department shuttle flights are planned, both
next year, but they will not be surrounded by secrecy.
   NASA's shuttle, the strongest cargo carrier used in the United
States, is capable of putting a 52,000-pound payload into orbit.
   The Titan 4 can lift a 39,000-pound cargo into low Earth orbit
or carry 10,000 pounds to stationary orbit 22,300 miles high.
