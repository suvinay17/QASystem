<LEADPARA>  ON MARCH 4, KWSS-FM surrendered. The teen-agers who tuned in to 94.5 FM that
morning to hear the latest in Contemporary Hit Radio, the kind of music that
used to be called Top 40, instead heard the Top 40 of another, earlier
generation -- their parents' generation.;    A week later, the same thing
happened to the kids who set their digital dials to X100, a.k.a. KXXX-FM
(99.7). Goodbye Mariah Carey, hello Creedence Clearwater Revival.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And with that, the Bay Area wholeheartedly followed a nationwide radio
trend. Contemporary Hit Radio (CHR), the kind of station the baby boomers grew
up with, is out. "Classic Rock 'n' Roll" and "Oldies" formats are in.;    "We
were shocked when we figured out there's no major, mainstream CHR station in
the Bay Area" since the changeover of those two stations, says Harvey Kojan,
album-oriented rock editor for the industry trade journal Radio &amp; Records.
"Just shocked.";    But maybe he shouldn't be. A survey completed in August by
Interep Radio Store, a sales agent for radio stations, shows the number of
Classic Rock stations in the United States has grown by 24 percent in the last
five years. Oldies stations increased by an astounding 108 percent. And
Contemporary Hit Radio? Down 14 percent since 1986.;    Everybody, it seems,
is aiming straight for the ears of the baby boomers, especially those between
the ages of 35 and 44.;    "KOME, KSJO, KRQR, KFOG, and even Double 99, for
that matter," muses Kojan. "You could tune to all of them, and they might be
playing the same song at the same time.";    25-to-54 age group;    The world
of radio marketing is a world of niches, polling target audiences, and
tweaking programming to come up with a format that will attract whoever it is
the station wants to attract. Can the radio stations help it if the people
advertisers love just happen to be from the ages of 25 to 54?;    Programmers
such as KUFX's Ed Krampf know that the oldest baby boomers turn 45 this year
and the youngest turn 27, and that they account for 55 percent of all consumer
spending.;    All of which explains why Elton John's greatest hits are bigger
than ever on local radio. The 18-to-24-year-olds make up only 11.6 percent of
the Bay Area radio market. It's a question of simple mathematics, says Paul
Wilensky, vice president and general manager of KDBK/KDBQ, a "mellow rock"
station broadcasting from 98.9 in San Francisco and 99.1 in Santa Cruz since
August.;    "Broadcasters today use research," Krampf explains. "We research
the market like crazy. We find out what the niche is, what the biggest
opportunity is. We know who our heaviest users are, what our potential for
listeners is, and we reach them by giving them what they want.";    In radio
talk, it's called "super serving" your audience. But exactly how to super
serve them is the hard part.;    "If there's a more difficult area to program
than the Bay Area, I don't know what it is," Kojan says. First of all, he
says, there's the hilly terrain, which makes picking up AM frequencies easier
than picking up FM frequencies.;    4th largest radio market;    And then
there's the sheer number of radio stations. The San Francisco Bay Area, which
for Arbitron ratings purposes includes San Jose and Santa Rosa, is the fourth
largest radio market in the country. But it's at the top as far as signals go,
with 59 stations showing up in Arbitron ratings for the area. New York, the
largest market in terms of population, has 52 Arbitron-rated radio stations.; 
  So far, what many radio programmers seem to have figured out is that their
audience is aging. And what does an aging audience want? Memories, familiarity
and the good old days.;    "The bulk of our library is between 1968 and
1972-73," says Krampf. "When you think about that era, you think about Martin
Luther King and Bobby Kennedy, and Neil Armstrong landing on the moon, and the
Vietnam War. . . . People like the emotion of listening to a radio station
that brings back those memories of growing up when Top 40 and rock 'n' roll
was king.";    It's like this, says Kevin Metheny, program director of Oldies
station KFRC-FM (99.7): When you're young, there's not much that's more
important to you than new music. By the time you reach your 30s, however,
you've got other responsibilities. You don't have the time or inclination to
listen to new rock 'n' roll. You just want to hear what you used to hear.;   
To people like Krampf and Metheny, KUFX's Classic Rock 'n' Roll format is
different from the KFRC-FM's Oldies format, both of which are different from
the Adult Contemporary/Soft Rock format played on stations such as KABL-FM
(98.1).;    Variations on one theme;    But to the casual listener, the
differences aren't that apparent. And that's what makes the battle for the
baby boomers so fierce. How do you make your station stand out in the minds of
listeners when everybody's basically programming a variation on the same
theme?;    "You continually research the music to find out what people want to
hear," says Mike Grinsell, general manager of KABL.;    Phone surveys, focus
groups, auditorium testing -- an Oldies station like KARA-FM (105.7) can
easily spend $100,000 a year coming up with a play list, says Bob Kieve,
president of KARA and KLIV-AM in San Jose.;    Auditorium testing, Kieve says,
consists of getting together people from your target audience and asking them
to rate songs. Each group rates about 350 songs. They hear about eight seconds
of a song before deciding whether they like it or not. KARA takes the top
picks and plays them.;    Back in 1982, when Kieve says KARA started playing
oldies, the field wasn't crowded. Now it is. "There is something of a joke
that everybody has suddenly discovered oldies," Kieve says. He takes a deep
breath. "Of course, we don't laugh about it so much anymore.";    25-year-old
play list;    One of the stations Kieve sees as real competition is KFRC-FM,
which plays "immensely popular, generally upbeat music that was popular
between the British (rock 'n' roll) invasion and the withdrawal from Vietnam,"
says Metheny. "Some call it 'Big Chill' music," he adds.;    Ironically,
KFRC-FM finds itself playing the same songs its AM counterpart played 25 years
ago, when the boomers were teens and pre-teens, and KFRC, at 610 on the AM
dial, was the hot Top 40 station on everybody's transistor radio.;    Now, the
AM version of KFRC is Magic 61, a station that plays hits from the Big Band
era in an effort to claim the demographic niche that's one up from the baby
boomers. And the Bay Area doesn't have a mainstream Top 40 station anymore.;  
 Instead, Classic Rock is hot, and it will stay hot, Kojan says. "You pick out
those timeless classics, and you play them over and over again," he says. How
can you lose?;    Nevertheless, Kojan says he's sick of most classic songs.
And he may not be alone.;    "Down the road," he says, "someone is going to
realize that there are a lot of people who want to hear mainstream CHR music.
And someone's going to find a format and make it work.";    Maybe when the
boomers' own babies grow up. (box)  </TEXT>

   At age 70, news commentator Paul Harvey is about
to become a museum piece, but he isn't letting that interfere with
his three daily radio shows, his newspaper column or his speaking
tours.
   ``Tomorrow's the most exciting day in world to me,'' Harvey said
recently, and he has plenty of tomorrows planned _ new directions
for his syndicated television program, a new second home and studio
in Phoenix and adding a helicopter rating to his aviation licenses.
   On Saturday, he is to be inducted into Chicago's Museum of
Broadcast Communications.
   ``I won't retire until I find something that's more fun to do,''
Harvey said, gesturing around his office-studio, decorated with
civic awards, keys to cities and cartoons.
   Harvey got his start at 15 with radio station KVOO in his native
Tulsa, Okla. His name was Paul H. Aurandt back then, and it
remained so through stints in Kansas, St. Louis and Kalamazoo,
Mich. He changed it on taking his first Chicago job in 1944.
   Now, when he says ``Good morning, Americans, this is Paul
Harvey,'' he speaks to an estimated 22 million listeners on 1,348
radio stations, but Harvey tries to concentrate on one person.
   ``I'm usually talking to my wife's sister,'' Harvey said. ``She
seems to epitomize grass-roots America to me. I keep asking myself,
`Would Aunt Betty really care? Would Aunt Betty really understand?'
A lot of stories get rewritten or discarded because of that.''
   Harvey shrugs off such adjectives as ``cornball'' and criticism
of his format, in which ominous headlines are often juxtaposed with
cute animal stories and Harvey's comments.
   ``Hard, cold facts have to be made palatable with some leavening
_ but you can't use too much of that leavening. No one wants to
listen to just good news, after all _ it's been tried and it
doesn't work.''
   He also does his own commercials, delivering them in the same
tone of voice as the news itself. The practice is a Harvey
trademark _ and he defends it, saying, ``I use the products myself
and I can vouch for them.''
   Interviewer and Pulitzer Prize-winning author Studs Terkel, who
has been on Chicago radio since 1945, says he understands Harvey's
popularity, but does not necessarily approve of the reasons.
   ``At a certain point in the New Deal and a certain point in the
war, Paul said the usual, expected things,'' Terkel said. ``Paul
was offering pretty simplistic views, and they caught on like a
house afire, I guess they were what some people wanted to hear.''
   ``He's a nice guy, a very honest guy and a very fair-minded
guy,'' said Terkel. ``I like him very much personally, but I don't
have much in common with his views. In some ways, he's confined his
mind to the 12th century _ and it's not the 12th century anymore.
He sees things in blacks and whites, and the world is more complex
than he realizes.''
   Harvey's family _ he and wife Lynne have been married 47 years _
has sometimes influenced his broadcasts, as when he reversed
himself on the Vietnam War. He signaled the shift in a broadcast
that opened: ``I love you, Mr. President, but you're wrong ...''
   ``I changed my mind about Vietnam after a painful period of
several months of soul-searching and discussions _ often around our
own dinner table,'' he said. ``My son, Paul Jr., was exempt, but he
felt so strongly about the war that he chose to announce himself as
a conscientious objector anyway.''
   It was the Cold War that brought Harvey to national prominence.
Working as an ABC radio commentator in 1951, he was arrested on
orders of the Atomic Energy Commission for scaling a fence and
surreptitiously entering Argonne National Laboratory, west of
Chicago.
   Harvey said it was investigative journalism and proved that
security was lax at the AEC's nuclear facilities; the AEC called it
breaking and entering.
   ``No indictment was filed, but Harry Truman had me picking
barbed wire out of my britches for about a decade,'' Harvey
recalled.
   Having supported such political opposites as Sens. Joseph
McCarthy and William Fulbright, Harvey says he once considered
himself a conservative but can no longer define himself politically.
   ``Basically, I believe in Big People, as opposed to Big
Government _ to the extent that a sardine society will allow,'' he
said.

   Chill out, Madonna and Janet Jackson. Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein is catching heavy play on rock 'n' roll radio these
days.
   Disc jockeys across the country are dubbing over pop songs to
produce parodies aimed at Saddam. It evoked memories of the time
when radio stations blasted Iran's taking of American hostages with
the song ``Bomb Iran'' set to the Beach Boys' ``Barbara Ann.''
   The results are often more popular than the top 40.
   To the strains of the Marvelettes' ``Please Mr. Postman,''
WZLX-FM in Boston lambasted Saddam on Wednesday for his country's
march into neighboring Kuwait.
   The song changes the original lyrics from ``Stop, oh yes, wait a
minute Mr. Postman, wa-a-a-it Mr. Postman,'' to ``Oh yeah, wait a
minute Mr. Hussein, Kuwait isn't yours Mr. Hussein.''
   The song continues:
   ``Saddam Hussein is cut off at sea,
   ``Our troops are poised so patiently,
   ``We're gonna be there for a long, long time
   ``You'll have nothing but an empty pipeline ...''
   In Philadelphia, WMGK-FM aired ``I Am Iraq,'' to the tune of
Simon and Garfunkel's ``I Am A Rock,'' on its show ``Harvey in the
Morning.''
   The song blasts Saddam with the lyrics: ``I am the chosen
leader, no I'm not insane, it's right and just because I am
Hussein, I am Iraq, I am a tyrant ...''
   ``It's our biggest hit,'' said Julie Roberts, the show's
producer. ``People want to know where they can buy copies, and
there are a lot of requests. We've gotten a few dozen calls.''
   Saddam has chosen to be known by his first name, but the
songwriters are generally calling him Hussein.
   WTIC-FM in Hartford, Conn., played ``Blame it on Hussein'' to
the tune of Milli Vanilli's ``Blame it on the Rain.''
   The song was part of a station promotion Wednesday in which disc
jockeys dressed as Arab sheiks and a service station offered
drivers premium gasoline for 96 cents a gallon. Traffic tie-ups
forced an early end to the event.
   WHHY-FM in Montgomery, Ala., caused a traffic jam Tuesday when
it held an ``Insane Hussein'' party. There were no song parodies.
But the station gave away five gallons of gas to the first 102 cars
in line and had a dunking booth with a person dressed as the Iraqi
leader.
   Following in the footsteps of history, Rush Limbaugh's
nationally syndicated radio talk show set ``Bomb Iraq'' to
``Barbara Ann.''
   ``We had a guy call up who said, `let's go in there and take
Hussein out,' '' Limbaugh said. ``I said, `here's a song for you,'
and we played it.''
   In Dallas, KMGC-FM dubbed over the Fine Young Cannibals' ``She
Drives Me Crazy'' with the lyrics:
   ``Hussein is crazy, ooh, ooh
   ``So call his bluff, ooh, ooh
   ``Hussein is crazy, and things could really get rough.
   ``Ooh, ooh ...''
   KLZX AM &amp; FM in Salt Lake City serenaded its listeners with
``Iraq, Iraq,'' based on ``New York, New York,'' and ``Hussein,''
sung to Eric Clapton's ``Cocaine.''
   Country and western stations are also getting into the act. Disc
jockey Ken Cooper at KZLA in Burbank, Calif., came up with several
parodies, such as a twist on Hank Williams Jr.'s ``All My Rowdy
Friends Are Coming Over Tonight'' that goes ``All My Saudi Friends
are Coming Over Tonight.''
   Michael Coleman, production director of Boston's WZLX, said the
station's first parody got such a response he decided to produce
several others.
   One, to the tune of ``End of the Line'' by the Traveling
Wilburys, goes:
   ``Well it's an oil fight,
   ``Riding in the Middle East.
   ``Well it's an oil fight.
   ``Iraq is acting like a beast.''
   Others in the works for national airwaves include ``One More in
the Name of Allah'' to U2's ``Pride, in the Name of Love''; ``Me
and Hussein Down by the Oil Field'' to Paul Simon's ``Me And Julio
Down by the Schoolyard''; and ``Who'll Stop Hussein'' to Creedence
Clearwater Revival's ``Who'll Stop the Rain.''
   ``I don't want to make a joke of this,'' Coleman said. ``This is
just tongue-in-cheek, but we have to be careful.''

<TEXT>
   A song in memory of fallen police
officers, written and recorded by a policeman who died two days
later in an accident, has become the most popular song at the radio
station where it debuted.
   The calls to WQIK-FM haven't stopped since the song ``When Daddy
Comes Home'' was first played Friday.
   ``We have just been swamped on the phones,'' program director
Jack Evans said. ``It's been the most requested song of the day.''
   Officer Ray Shinholser, 30, died Wednesday from injuries suffered
when he was thrown from his motorcycle Tuesday night on his way to
work. His funeral was Saturday.
   After Shinholser's death, his 4-year-old son Michael's voice was
added to the song, reciting the plaintive refrain, ``I miss you,
Daddy. I miss you.''
   ``That's it. That's the part that really gets to people,'' said
Officer Jimmy Guthrie, secretary of the Fraternal Order of Police.
   Michael, Shinholser's widow, Debbie, the officer's manager and
two fellow officers brought the first copy of the song's master tape
to WQIK Thursday night.
   The song was inspired by the death of Officer Gary Bevel, who was
fatally shot in May 1983. But the lyrics foreshadow the songwriter's
own death, saying in part, ``Momma, when's Daddy coming home to hug
his little man?''
   WQIK news director Tim Maguire called the offices of syndicated
radio commentator Paul Harvey in Chicago this week to relay the
story; Harvey opened his Thursday broadcast with Shinholser's story.
   Guthrie said his office has received hundreds of calls from radio
listeners wanting to buy the tape.
   Shinholser originally intended all proceeds to go toward the
construction fund for a police memorial in Washington, Guthrie said.
Now, part of the profits will be placed in a college fund for
Shinholser's two children.
   The police union is producing tapes of the song.

   Radio Aahs uses a unicorn for its logo, and
its all-children's format is almost as rare as that mythical beast.
   But backers hope it will lead to a national network of
child-oriented radio stations, and others say the market is ripe
for such programming.
   ``Radio can be the storyteller that too often is missing from a
child's life. It makes you think,'' said Peggy Charren, president
of Action for Children's Television, a vigorous promoter of
children's radio programming.
   WWTC-AM, or Radio Aahs (pronounced Oz), made its debut May 12
with a broadcast from St. Paul's Como Zoo. So far, WWTC is the only
station in the Children's Radio Network.
   Two other radio networks for children are breaking ground in
Orlando, Fla., and Philadelphia.
   Radio Aahs airs educational songs, school news, fairy tales,
historical stories and re-creations of such old-time radio shows as
the ``Lone Ranger'' around the clock.
   ``It's pretty nice,'' said 5-year-old Gary Petersen. ``I don't
like rock 'n' roll stations. My mom turns it up too loud.''
   His mother, Patricia, is glad Gary and his 3-year-old brother,
Jarrod, feel a part of things. ``Mom has her radio station, Dad has
his radio station, and now they have theirs,'' she said.
   Emily Semsch, 6, likes that the station ``has more kid songs.
There's a song from school I know.''
   William Osewalt, president of Children's Radio Network, believes
that engaging the community is the key to the commercial venture's
success. He's thinking of children as guest DJs, broadcast
performances by school choirs and bands, and radio plays. Junior
journalists could also report on activities in their schools.
   ``There also will be the ones who go out and interview the
Herschel Walkers, other Vikings, the governor and the senators and
find out how legislation will affect them,'' Osewalt said.
   Osewalt formed Children's Radio Network in 1984, selling
programming to six stations around the country before getting out
of the business in 1986 for personal reasons.
   When he was ready to resume, he targeted the Twin Cities. Among
the reasons are its high per-capita spending on education and its
reputation as a traditional family base, he said.
   ``Like they say in show biz, if it doesn't work here, it won't
work anywhere,'' Osewalt said.
   The station has started with about 20 full-time employees, plus
volunteer advisers, such as St. Paul School Superintendent David
Bennett.
   Osewalt would not disclose the network's budget.
   Radio Aahs is a ``very nice alternative in a child's media
diet,'' said Richard Weinberg, director of the University of
Minnesota's Institute of Child Development in the College of
Education. ``Our kids live so much in a visual world. Returning to
an auditory world allows them to enhance their own imaginations.''
   In Florida, Kids' Choice Broadcasting Network has begun
marketing its network of satellite-delivered programs. Orlando
station WPRD-AM is the flagship station for the network, having
launched the children's format March 31.
   Kidwaves Radio Network of Philadelphia plans to launch its
all-children's programming June 1 at KIDZ-AM in Kansas City, Mo.,
said network President Mel Diamond.
   ``I think for the first time radio people are just waking up to
this segment,'' Diamond said. ``Our goal here at this network is to
raise their imagination levels, their creativity, and to ensure we
have a literate America.''
   The notion of an all-children's format on radio tantalizes L.
Roger Casty, executive vice president of CPM Inc., a Chicago media
management company that finds media for advertisers and agencies.
   ``It sounds like a wonderful idea. If I were the advertiser, I
would certainly look into it. It may be a very efficient way to
go,'' Casty said.

   NEW YORK -- Forget Madonna, Motley Crue, Janet Jackson and
the other current staples of Top 40 radio.
   The hottest format across the radio dial these days
showcases performers who haven't had hits in decades, such as
Dion and the Belmonts, Elvis Presley, The Supremes and Lesley
Gore.

   Since last year, the number of stations that program the
solid gold format has ballooned about 20%, making it one of
the fastest-growing formats, according to Broadcasting
magazine. "I've been following radio for about 20 years, and
I've never seen anything like this," says James Duncan Jr.,
publisher of American Radio, a quarterly analysis of radio
ratings, programming trends and financial data.
   By attracting baby boomers in the key 25-54 age group that
advertisers covet most, the oldies but goodies are turning
out to be pure gold for stations such as New York's
all-oldies WCBS-FM. "A lot of stations are looking for the
quick fix, and solid gold is it," says Joe McCoy, program
director at WCBS-FM, which switched from album-oriented rock
to oldies in 1972. "The aging of America is looking for
consistency and familiarity," he says.
   WCBS-FM, which has become steadily more popular since the
early 1970s, reached a milestone last week. For the first
time in its history as an oldies station, it finished as the
top-ranked radio station in New York in ratings compiled by
Arbitron Co., a unit of Control Data Corp. The station, owned
by CBS Inc., also finished No. 1 among 25-to-54-year-olds.
Mr. Duncan of American Radio predicts that WCBS-FM will be
the third-largest money-making station in the country, with
ad revenues of about $30 million. It trails only WGN-AM in
Chicago, with projected billings of $35 million, and KABC-AM
in Los Angeles, with $32 million.
   Even in markets where the oldies station has average or
below-average ratings overall, its popularity with affluent
listeners in the key demographic group is strong. For
example, in Boston, even though oldies station WODS-FM
finished a mediocre No. 11 in overall ratings, it scored its
fourth consecutive No. 1 victory in the 25-to-54 age group.
   "No question that the most attractive demographic likes to
listen to oldies," says Richard Cotter, vice president and
regional broadcast manager in the New York office of J.
Walter Thompson Co., a unit of WPP Group PLC. Mr. Cotter adds
that the age group also gravitates to adult contemporary
(Neil Diamond, Fleetwood Mac, Kenny Rogers) and all-news
outlets.
   The success of the oldies format is prompting a number of
stations with mediocre ratings in other formats to make the
switch. "Stations are searching for a format that would
attract the baby boomers, and in a lot of markets, the format
did not exist," says Gerry Boehme, vice president and
director of research at Katz Radio Group, a subsidiary of
Katz Communications Inc.
   Earlier this month, for example, Infinity Broadcasting
Corp. switched its lackluster adult contemporary station in
Detroit to oldies. "It's a big moneymaker, and you don't have
to depend on high-visibility morning shows," says Mel
Karmazin, president and chief executive officer of Infinity,
which also operates album-oriented rock and so-called classic
rock stations in cities such as New York, Los Angeles and
Boston. "As an oldies station, you may not be everybody's No.
1 choice, but you are everyone's No. 2 choice," Mr. Karmazin
adds.
   Not everyone is thrilled about the oldies boom. Despite
the surge in music video as a marketing tool for new
recording artists, record companies still rely in part on
radio to move new material. "The record companies do not like
this format," says Nancy C. Widmann, president of the CBS
radio division, which owns 20 stations, including 12 FM
outlets, five with the oldies format. "We don't move their
product."
   An official at CBS Records, which is now a subsidiary of
Sony Corp., says that it would be in the best interests of
the record industry if each radio station would broadcast
both current and past hits. However, he acknowledges that may
be an unrealistic expectation, given the trend toward
identifiable formats.
   Some stations were initially wary of the oldies format,
which includes a heavy diet of The Beatles, The Rolling
Stones and other mainstays of the 1960s. Their executives
were concerned that people would naturally tire of songs they
were so familiar with. After all, how many times could you
hear The Dave Clark Five belt out "Over and Over"?
   "Some stations were afraid of the format because they
thought it would burn out," says Bill Clark, president of
Shamrock Broadcasting Co., which owns four oldies stations in
cities such as Denver and Atlanta. "But people identify with
an era of music and love to hear it again and again," he
says, adding that "for people who are 35 to 45 years old, the
oldies stations will be their equivalent of the big band
stations their parents listen to."

Three Los Angeles stations picked up honors as the National Assn. of 
Broadcasters presented its first Marconi Radio Awards at the convention. Named 
as stations of the year for their formats were KPWR-FM (contemporary hit 
radio-top 40), KTWV-FM (jazz-new age) and KMPC-AM (big-band nostalgia). 
Chicago's WLS-AM was selected "Legendary Station" and ABC news commentator Paul 
Harvey won the personality of the year award in the network-syndication 
category. The Marconi awards are to be made annually. ALEENE MacMINN

<HL> Sour Notes? Classical Radio Station's Bid
To Broaden Appeal Riles Some Listeners

   For a month, a man in a white mask, tuxedo, top hat and cape has been been prowling Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall and other Manhattan haunts of the cultured. 
At each location, he hands a patron $104, yells "The 104 Phantom strikes again!" and speeds off in a white limousine. 

   The Phantom is the creation of radio station WNCN, 104.3 FM, which hopes the promotion will help it win bigger audiences. 
Such gimmicks are typical of radio stations that play Billy Joel or the Beach Boys. 
But WNCN plays Bach, Beethoven and Brahms, and some of the station's traditional listeners are appalled. 

   "It's just not in good taste," says T'ing C. Pei, a Manhattan real-estate developer and a director of Listeners' Guild Inc., a WNCN listeners group that has had a long-running feud with the station, partly over programming. 
"I don't think that this audience needs to be shrieked at." 

   The Phantom epitomizes the growing efforts of classical radio stations to attract new and more mainstream listeners. 
By adopting methods used by adult contemporary-music stations and others, they hope to increase audiences -- and thus raise advertising revenues, or listener donations in the case of non-commercial stations. 
The changes may be working: Classical radio's daily audience increased 30% last year to 3.9 million, according to Simmons Market Research Bureau Inc. 

   But the trend is rocking the classical music world and polarizing station operators, as well as listeners. 
Traditionalists fear that the new marketing, promotional and format techniques are stripping classical radio of its program diversity, educational value and stature. 
Some of the methods amount to "prostitution," one station manager says. 

   The innovators, however, say the future of classical radio may be in jeopardy without broader audiences. 
"Station managers are going to have to make sure that when their traditional audience dies or goes away, they darn well better have a base of regenerative listeners," says Mario Mazza, director of programming and operations at WNCN, one of about 35 commercial classical stations in the U.S. 

   In addition to the promotional gimmicks, many of the stations are ordering announcers to talk less, be friendlier and drop the lengthy, pedantic commentary that has long characterized classical music broadcasting. 
They are playing popular works such as those by Beethoven and Mozart more often, and in full rather than in excerpts. 
Vocal works, including opera, are getting less air time, as are more obscure composers and pieces. 

   The classical stations, like their contemporary rivals, also are structuring broadcasts around certain periods of the day, playing short, upbeat pieces in the morning when listeners are waking or driving to work, lighter pieces during working hours as background music, and longer, more challenging works at night. 
Some are weaving into their format "New Age" music -- light, instrumental works that have a jazz-classical tilt and are popular among some younger listeners. 

   Classical stations "are beginning to look at themselves as regular radio stations that just happen to play classical music," says Jerry Del Colliano, publisher of Inside Radio, an industry newsletter. 
"They are breaking out of a mold that may have prevented people from feeling comfortable with classical." 

   WNCN, for example, has hired a comedian to perform skits and jokes during the station's morning show. 
WXCR-FM, which serves the Tampa Bay area from Safety Harbor, Fla., last year began a semiannual "Top 40" countdown of the most popular classical works. 
And KHFM of Albuquerque, N.M., in April set up a remote broadcast at a local luggage retailer. 

   Commercial classical stations hope such moves will increase their share of the upscale listeners coveted by advertisers. 
According to the Simmons research, classical radio's total audience in 1986 was the 10th largest of the 14 formats that Simmons tracks -- but classical listeners ranked first in education and employment levels and second in the $50,000-plus annual-income category. 
That audience profile helps make many commercial classical stations profitable. 

   The classical stations' new strategies run the risk of alienating traditional listeners, however. 
In New York, Warren Bodow, president and general manager of WQXR-AM/FM, WNCN's major rival, says he received about 300 letters of protest when the station moved "Adventures in Good Music," a popular classical-music talk show, to a late-night time slot on weekdays to make room for more music in the morning. 

   When KFAC-AM/FM in Los Angeles unveiled a less traditional format in January, it received 1,500 letters protesting the change and 1,000 letters praising it, says station president Louise Heifetz. 
She says the mail now is running about 90% in favor of the new format, which was created with the help of a consultant to adult-contemporary and rock 'n' roll stations. 

   For the estimated 400 not-for-profit stations that play classical music, the changes are generating even greater debate. 
At issue is whether seeking bigger audiences runs counter to public radio's mandate of providing unique, diverse programming. 

   "Public radio is a different kind of service. 
It shouldn't be looking for bulk listeners," says Samuel J. Paul, head of radio and TV production for New York's Metropolitan Opera Association. 
"If they cut out the talk programs, cut out the opera and the vocal, what's left is not a fair representation of what classical music is." 

   Still, many not-for-profit stations -- fearing possible cutbacks in government funding and worried about money for programming and hiring -- say that despite the risk of losing traditional listeners and their contributions, some changes are needed to woo new audiences. 
National Public Radio, whose services include news and classical programs, wants to double the audience of its 350 member stations by 1990. 

   "Doubling audience is an important aspect of our mission," asserts Peter J. Dominowski, director of programming at WMFE-FM, Orlando, Fla., one of the more innovative public stations. 
He says the station's weekly audience is up more than 20% from a year ago, and donations are increasing at a "slow but steady" pace. 

   "Some stations seem to have gotten it into their philosophy," he adds, "that serving a handful of people meant they were fulfilling their mission."

<HEAD>Crain's: Advertisers of Strike-Bound News Heading for Radio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Advertisers in the strike-bound Daily News are
turning to radio rather than other newspapers in the city, but many
of the stations are already heavily booked, a business publication
reported today.
   Crain's New York Business reported radio is drawing advertisers
who are concerned that the New York Post and New York Newsday, the
city's other two tabloids, don't provide the right mix of readers.
   
   Many radio stations, however, can't handle the extra advertisers
because their ad load has increased for the holiday season, Crain's
said.
   ``I have problems with the Post because of the editorial
content,'' said Harvey Berman, president of the Harvey Berman ad
agency. ``We would consider radio; however, last weekend I tried to
get a news radio package for a client, but couldn't get the time.''
   The 71-year-old News trudged ahead Sunday, handing out free
samples and using ``hawkers'' to sell newspapers on the street
where vendors feared union intimidation. The press run was about
600,000. News' spokeswoman Lisa Robinson said 50,000 copies were
given away.
   ``We're still seeing gaps in distribution,'' she said. ``Many,
many people support us. Some people don't.''
   The News, the nation's third-largest metropolitan daily, had a
Sunday circulation of about 1.2 million before the strike began
Oct. 25.
   Nine of the newspaper's 10 unions went on strike. Some union
members have returned to work, but about 2,000 remain off the job.
Negotiations that began in January over contracts that expired in
March have been fruitless.
   The unions charge unfair labor practices.

   Danny and the Juniors must have had the gift of
prophecy when they recorded ``Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay'' 30
years ago.
   The number of radio stations nationwide playing rock music of
the late 1950s, the 1960s and 1970s has doubled in the last five
years, and the trend is continuing, according to the authoritative
Broadcasting@Cablecasting Yearbook.
   For 1981, the yearbook listed 232 AM or FM radio stations
playing the gamut of popular music of past decades: ``oldies,
golden oldies, nostalgia, classic rock, old gold, solid gold, and
classic rock.''
   That number had grown to 464 by 1986, and members of the
yearbook staff at the main office of Broadcasting magazine in
Washington said recently the 1988 yearbook will list 537 of the
country's 10,219 stations as playing oldies.
   There are indications most are doing well in a highly
competitive business.
   Figures at Arbitron Ratings, the service that keeps tabs on the
nation's listening habits, show that in many large markets oldies
stations are among the top 10 draws.
   There is no clear-cut explanation for classic rock's popularity,
but many in the industry believe millions of baby boomers prefer
the music they grew up with.
   ``I think it really comes down to the music,'' said WODS program
director Dave VanDyke, whose Boston station went on air last
October with its ``oldies'' format. ``For the adults of today, the
music that's being released just doesn't do a thing for them, but
teen-agers (also) are desiring this kind of music more than what's
being recorded today.''
   In New York, Joe McCoy, program director at WCBS-FM, said his
station's ``oldie'' format transcended the generations.
   ``This is the stuff parents grew up on, this is the stuff they
were weaned on, so they're translating it to the kids today,'' he
said in a telephone interview.
   In Hartford, Conn., where WDRC-FM plays ``solid gold rock 'n'
roll'' with emphasis on music between 1964-1975, the station's
program director, Frank Holler, agreed the oldies had appeal for
young adults.
   But Holler, himself a baby boomer at 39, was most eloquent when
describing the meaning of WDRC's music to others of his age.
   He spoke on the telephone to a background of Peter and Gordon's
``World Without Love.''
   ``The people love it, it reminds them of a very special time of
their lives,'' said Holler of his station's music. ``There is a
familiarity that both men and women are immediately comfortable
with, and it has not been played to such excess within the last 15
years as to be burned out.''
   ``I think as long as the baby boom generation is alive with
disposable income that the advertisers are looking to reach, the
music of the '50s, '60s and '70s is going to continue to be
popular,'' he said.
   Garry Guthrie, whose Edinborough Rand Inc. advises stations on
formats, agreed that ``there is considerable advertiser interest''
in baby boomers.
   ``Most of them are in the $35,000-plus range,'' he said, in a
telephone interview from Scottsdale, Ariz. ``You are giving ...
(advertisers) a large block of people with discretionary income who
want to be on top of trends, who are willing to buy durable goods.''
   Guthrie said he has overseen about 12 station changes to classic
rock formats since he set up business in October 1985, and ``we
have yet to have any failures.''

Eric Chandler Communications has sold KCBQ AM and FM, better known as Eagle 
105, to rapidly growing Adams Communications for $23.5 million, it was 
announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Chandler Communications purchased KCBQ for $12.2 million in 1986, and promptly 
switched the format from country to the oldies rock 'n' roll of Eagle 105. The 
format is simulcast on FM (105.3) and AM (1170). 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to keep the format as is," said Matt Mills, president of Adams' 
radio division. 
</P>
<P>
Adams-owned KOOL AM and FM in Phoenix feature oldies rock formats. 
</P>
<P>
"Phoenix has worked out very well for us," Mills said. "We're just real high on 
the San Diego market. San Diego is a growth market and we're specializing in 
Top 30 markets when possible." 
</P>
<P>
Mills said he did not expect to make any staff changes at the station. Jim 
Seemiller, Adams vice president of the Western region, will oversee KCBQ from 
his Phoenix office, Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1983 by Stephen Adams, Adams Communications is a national multimedia 
company with interests in outdoor advertising, publishing, television and 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
The radio division, based in Clearwater, Fla., owns 10 radio stations -- six FM 
and four AM -- in Phoenix, Seattle, St. Louis, San Antonio and other mid-sized 
markets. Adams owns nine television stations, primarily in smaller markets. 
</P>
<P>
The $23.5-million price is high for San Diego, but not unheard of, considering 
the current market for radio stations. Prices have skyrocketed in recent years, 
because of federal deregulation and a host of young companies like Adams 
bidding for stations. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel we're paying a good premium to get into the market, but that's what 
you have to do to get into a good area," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
Radio stations changing owners is "something that goes on in radio," Eagle 105 
General Manager Jeff Apregan said. "Radio stations have become a good 
investment." 
</P>
<P>
KCBQ was the Los Angeles-based Chandler's only radio interest.

   Free-Form Radio Fights Static Formats

   NEW YORK -- On a recent Sunday evening, listeners of radio
station WXRK-FM here heard an unreleased song by Ned Sublette
and the Persuasions, "Ever-Widening Circle of Remorse."
   Vin Scelsa, the disk jockey on duty, liked it so much he
immediately played it again. And again. During the record's
third go-around, Mr. Scelsa talked over the song and
interrupted it to comment on various lyrics that caught his
interest.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Clearly, this isn't cookie-cutter radio.
   Mr. Scelsa is an oddity in an era when most radio is
dominated by carefully researched, risk-averse formats that
live by computer-generated playlists. He is a throwback to
the free-form radio of the late 1960s, when progressive rock
first hit the airwaves and disk jockeys enjoyed wide freedom
to play whatever they wanted.
   But Mr. Scelsa may also be the forerunner of a new wave of
disk jockeys who are being put on the air for their musical
knowledge: Free-form programming, which had dwindled to as
few as five stations around the country in the mid-1980s,
appears to be making a modest comeback.
   To be sure, most free-form stations give disk jockeys less
freedom these days than they did in the '60s, when listeners
may have been assaulted by a half-hour of sitar music or
18-minute album cuts with seven-minute guitar solos. But the
number of stations whose playlists go beyond the staples of
album-oriented rock, such as Led Zeppelin and the Who, has
jumped nearly eightfold in the past several years to 39, says
Robert Unmacht, president and managing editor of M Street
Journal, a Washington-based weekly publication that
chronicles format changes.
   Free-form radio is re-emerging because it serves as a way
for stations to carve distinct identities in a cluttered
market. KDHT-FM in Denver adopted a progressive format in
June to stand out from the roughly 40 other radio stations in
its metropolitan area. WTKX-AM in Pensacola, Fla., went
free-form in December because it "distinguishes {us} from the
rest of the pack," says Matt Shane, program director.
   Radio programmers say the format may draw baby boomers,
whom advertisers covet, because many grew up listening to it
in its heyday. Free-form could also lure college students
because free-form dominates college radio stations.
   The movement to free-form programming, though incremental,
is happening not only on the FM band, with its high-quality
stereo sound, but also on AM, which rock music had all but
abandoned. AM now serves mainly as home to specialty talk
formats, such as call-in, news, religion and sports shows.
But some AM stations, such as Pensacola's WKTX, have begun
experimenting. Howard Seaton, operations manager of WTKX,
says, "We're offering this community something that hasn't
been tried in about 15 years -- radio that hasn't come from a
computer."
   WTKX disk jockeys are given "some degree of freedom," says
Mr. Shane, the program director. The eclectic playlist, which
he calls "DJ heaven," includes the folk music of Suzanne
Vega, the British disco of Depeche Mode and the mournful
country pop of the Cowboy Junkies.
   But stations boasting non-format formats have some
restrictions. "We give the DJs guidelines," says Ira Gordon,
program director at Denver's KDHT-FM. They can't repeat
records that are currently popular for 12 hours, and some
older records have an eight-day rest before they can be
played again. But, Mr. Gordon adds, the DJs "have a lot more
freedom than most."
   FM progressive radio began in the mid-1960s when the
Federal Communications Commission ruled that companies that
owned AM-FM combination stations had to program them
separately. Because FM wasn't a moneymaker, many stations
became a laboratory for new, progressive rock music, the
antithesis of Top 40.
   DJs who started progressive radio 20 years ago and now
find themselves strangled by playlists say FM's financial
success is bittersweet. "Hey, man, radio has become nothing
but a bank with speakers attached to it," says Carl Widing,
program director and 14-year veteran of free-form station
KINK in Portland, Ore. "These days, it's harder to take risks
with the music."
   So, radio stations have become homogenized, with the same
slogans read from index cards in different cities. Doug
Clifton, a DJ for eight years with longtime progressive-rock
station KBCO-FM in Boulder, Colo., adds, "It's much harder to
start a station like this now. A station now looks to be an
instant hit in the ratings, and for that, you need to play
familiar songs. We require word of mouth."
   Some radio veterans blame the decline of free-form
programming on the DJs themselves. "What killed it was, a lot
of stations were manned by air personalities who were
self-indulgent," says Norm Winer, program director at
free-form WXRT-FM in Chicago, which ranks second in the
ratings of the city's four rock stations. "They didn't take
into account the public's musical taste," says Mr. Winer, who
was known on the air as Saxophone Joe.
   "DJs like Vin Scelsa are extinct because radio has become
so research-oriented," says Lee Abrams, a prominent radio
consultant and the managing director of Satellite Music
Network, which programs 1,000 stations nationwide. Station
managers "have little faith in disk jockeys' input and more
faith in computer printouts."
   Mr. Scelsa, a short, balding and bespectacled 42-year-old,
proudly eschews computer-selected album selections from such
rock artists as Tom Petty and the Rolling Stones. On Mr.
Scelsa's show, listeners may hear country-music legend Hank
Williams Jr. and raunchy rocker Prince back-to-back. Then
Clark Gable singing "Putting on the Ritz," followed by They
Might Be Giants, an avant-garde rock group.
   Nor does Mr. Scelsa confine himself to rock. Two weeks
ago, he hosted Michael Smith, the composer from the Broadway
play based on "The Grapes of Wrath," accompanied by actor Ron
Crawford and musician L.J. Slavin. They performed a one-hour
original piece combining what Mr. Smith calls "eclectic,
free-form" music with the text of the John Steinbeck novel.
   His weekly four-hour show, "Idiot's Delight," is named for
a Robert Sherwood play and a card game. "Idiot's delight is a
form of solitaire," he says, "and I'm playing this game alone
on the radio."
   WXRK, owned by Infinity Broadcasting Corp. and a formatted
station during most of the week, limits him to Sundays at 8
p.m., "when I can do little damage," he says. "It's doubtful
whether they would ever put me on full time." Mr. Scelsa has
trouble holding to a schedule anyway. Most Sundays, he
blithely runs well past his scheduled midnight sign-off,
playing on as much as an hour longer, "until {the show}
reaches a logical conclusion."
   Mr. Scelsa concedes that radio consultants and their
careful research will continue to set the agenda for most FM
rock stations. But "the consultants can only control that
which is easy to put into a computer," says Mr. Scelsa. "I
can't be controlled."

   The 10th anniversary of New Music America, a
69-event contemporary music festival, will be hosted this year by
the Brooklyn Academy of Music.
   Harvey Lichtenstein, president of the Brooklyn Academy, made the
announcement Tuesday at the Kitchen in Manhattan. The festival,
which has been held in a different city each year, started at the
Kitchen and featured Laurie Anderson, Steve Reich and Philip Glass.
   Lichtenstein said that New Music America will be held Nov. 10-18
and will be a major component of the Brooklyn Academy's seventh
annual Next Wave Festival. He said the festival ``reflects BAM's
interest in exploring new directions in the performing arts.''
   New Music America will present 104 ensembles and composers
working in extended forms of rock, jazz, classical and electronic
music. Performances are scheduled in 23 locations. For the first
time, a Recording Industry Council will help support the festival.
   A group of radio stations will record the festival and make the
concerts available the next day, via satellite, to more than 300
U.S. radio stations. On the final night, radio stations in four
cities will record different concerts in each of the Brooklyn
Academy's four theaters.
   Lichtenstein said that Philip Morris Companies Inc. has renewed
its grant of $350,000 as sponsor of the Next Wave Festival for the
fourth year. Benson and Hedges will support New Music America.

CAMPUS RADIO STATION IS ON AN 'ALTERNATIVE' WAVELENGTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
No one could accuse Pomona College student radio station KSPC of going 
commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Bands like Headless Chickens and Dog Bowl compete for air time with reggae and 
rap segments. 
</P>
<P>
Listeners in Lakewood tune in for the polka hours. 
</P>
<P>
And deejays would not dream of playing Madonna, Paula Abdul or U2 on this 
"alternative" station, situated to the far left of the FM dial at 88.7. 
</P>
<P>
With 3,000 watts of power, KSPC has one of the strongest signals of any 
student-run college radio station in the area, with a listening radius of 35 
miles and an estimated audience of about 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is, hardly anybody on campus tunes in. 
</P>
<P>
"KSPC. It's a radio station, isn't it?" said Hi Chang Choi, 20, a junior at the 
college, interviewed recently while he was having a Swiss burger at the Student 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
His comment was partly sarcastic but partly a reflection of KSPC's standing on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
A survey of Pomona students conducted by the Student Senate last year found 
that fewer than 40% of those surveyed listen to KSPC for more than an hour a 
week. The survey found that about 65% of the students surveyed believe that the 
station should better serve the college community. 
</P>
<P>
"Three people said 'Blow the damn thing up,' and a lot of people said they 
wanted to change the station," said Brian Azevedo, a member of the Student 
Senate who would like to see KSPC's format changed to something more 
mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying to make KSPC a bit more responsive to the students," said 
Azevedo, a sophomore transfer student from the University of Texas. "I guess 
that it's just that the community that KSPC serves isn't necessarily the 
community that is paying for KSPC." 
</P>
<P>
Azevedo persuaded the Student Senate to include questions about KSPC on the 
survey, which was distributed in campus dining halls and also included queries 
on other topics. He said he has no concrete plans for changing the station's 
format but believes that the tastes of more of the college's 1,400 students 
should go into deciding what is played. 
</P>
<P>
However, students who work at the station defend their playing of the likes of 
Big Black and Firehose. Such alternative rock accounts for half the music 
played on KSPC. 
</P>
<P>
"There's enough good music that is not mainstream that there's no particular 
obligation for us to play mainstream," said Franklin Bruno, the music director. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Vodika, a Pomona graduate and former deejay for the station, added: 
"There's just all kinds of music from all over the world, virtually, that 
doesn't get played on commercial radio stations and even most college stations. 
And KSPC is a forum for that music to be heard." 
</P>
<P>
Even the station's non-rock offerings are a bit unusual. But they also have 
their passionate partisans. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest hits is the polka show. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a kind of ritual with us on Saturday and Sunday mornings," said William 
Workman, 60, of Covina, who listens to the shows with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
Workman explained that "they play some real way-out ethnic stuff," such as 
Serbo-Croatian and Gypsy music. 
</P>
<P>
"Polkas don't all sound alike except to the person that's never heard one 
before," he commented. 
</P>
<P>
Another popular show, "The Boss Guy in Claremont," airs Sunday night and 
showcases alternative music from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"It really plays what I listened to during the '60s as opposed to what passes 
for that today on classic rock stations," said Darrel Frank of Placentia, who 
calls himself a "huge fan" of the show. He points to artists like the Savoy 
Brown Blues Band and Roy Gallagher and to big-name performers' lesser-known 
songs that are overlooked by most commercial stations. 
</P>
<P>
Friday night's funk rap show also has a loyal following, said Julie Frick, the 
station's director and only paid full-time staff member. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing is, we're not here just for the college students," said KSPC deejay 
Erik McGuinness, a Pitzer College senior who is eligible to work at the station 
because his school, like Pomona, is one of the Claremont Colleges. "We have a 
wide listenership, much larger than the college students." 
</P>
<P>
As for McGuinness, he acknowledges that the alternative rock he plays is not 
for everyone. "If you are a woman who is easily offended, perhaps you should 
plug your ears for this one," he tells his listeners as he spins the hit 
"Sleazeball," the latest from the band Zoogz Rift. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all pretty random," said McGuinness, who became interested in alternative 
rock at first because "it was funny" with "a lot of cheesy and ridiculous" 
music. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a proponent of variety over quality, myself," McGuinness said. 
</P>
<P>
Among local colleges, KSPC's broadcasting power is equalled only by Loyola 
Marymount University's KXLU, which plays an eclectic mix of educational, hard 
rock, jazz and classical programming. 
</P>
<P>
KSCR, the student-run radio station at USC, does not "shy away from artists 
just because they're considered commercial," said music director Raymond So. 
However, the station, whose only broadcast outlet is a campus dining hall, also 
plays "new artists that commercial radio wouldn't touch," So said. 
</P>
<P>
Part of KSPC's annual budget of more than $60,000 comes from the Student Senate 
budget, but most -- 75% -- comes from school administration. The station's 
budget is justified because it gives almost 100 volunteer student deejays and 
staffers an extracurricular activity and because it boosts the college's name 
recognition by broadcasting it often, Frick said. 
</P>
<P>
And then there's that music. 
</P>
<P>
"This music is really by some of the most vital and important artists around," 
Vodika said, "and it's not on television, not at the movies, and not on 
mainstream radio."

   Alligator owner and tavern proprietor James
Schebler says mascot Crosby is a real pussycat, but the City
Council refused to allow the bar to display the lounge lizard.
   ``There are a lot of dogs in town that are not maintained
properly and are more of a danger than Crosby. If you maintain an
animal properly, the danger is at a minimum,'' said Schebler, who
bought Crosby's Cove in Coggon four months ago and named it after
his pet alligator.
   Schebler wanted to keep the alligator, now 2 feet long, in the
eastern Iowa bar to attract customers.
   But the council Tuesday rejected Schebler's request that the
community's dangerous pets ordinance be amended to allow alligators
to be kept in the city as long as they are in a locked container.
   Mayor James Pflughaupt Jr. told Schebler that before he could
display the alligator in his bar, he would have to win a change in
a state law that bars animals in establishments that sell food or
drink.
   Meanwhile, other problems surfaced for the reptile. During the
council meeting, it was disclosed that Crosby is living in Cedar
Rapids, which also has a dangerous animal ordinance that bans
alligators within city limits.

   A radio station in this Gulf Coast city
has come up with a novel format and a catchy entry into the 1990s _
playing nothing but songs recorded by the defunct rock group Led
Zeppelin _ 24 hours a day.
   Beginning at the stroke of the new year, radio station WKRL-FM
has been calling itself: ``The first all-Led Zeppelin radio
station.''
   The station first confused listeners on Sunday, the last day of
1989, by playing only the 1971 Led Zeppelin song ``Stairway to
Heaven'' _ over and over for 24 hours.
   Before each playing of the song _ which is among the most
requested rock songs in radio _ the station repeatedly announced:
``It's coming tomorrow ... Your Stairway to Heaven station.''
   The change followed the station's purchase by Great American
Broadcasting Co.
   Led Zeppelin, a British group of the late 1960s and 1970s, fused
blues, country and heavy metal music with dark lyricism. The band
released 10 albums over 12 years. The foursome included lead singer
Robert Plant, Jimmy Page on guitar, John Paul Jones on bass and
keyboards and the late drummer John Bonham.

<HEAD>Helms Brings Up Race During Campaigning</HEAD>

   Sen. Jesse Helms accused Democrat Harvey
Gantt on Tuesday of injecting race into the campaign, while Gantt
said the comments were an insult to North Carolina voters.
   A Gantt ad being played on black radio stations says Gantt would
be good for ``us'' on education and other issues.
   ``He is saying one thing to the black citizens of the state and
he's saying another to all the rest of the citizens,'' the senator
told about 60 people during a campaign stop.
   Helms says he does not object to the strategy, but does object
to Gantt's claims that he is sending the same message to all
people.
   ``Don't let Senator Helms tell you Harvey Gantt is doing
something secret and sinister,'' Gantt told an enthusiastic crowd
of about 500 people. ``I ask you, how can Harvey Gantt be running a
secret campaign on black radio stations? This insults the voters of
this state.''
   During his Kinston appearance, Helms twice brought up his vote
to sustain President Bush's veto of the Civil Rights Act, which he
said included quotas that would require the hiring of certain
proportions of minorities.
   ``If you want quotas to dominate and dictate whether you get a
job or get a promotion, you vote for Mr. Gantt,'' he said.
   Helms peppered his speeches with other references to blacks. He
said Gantt had disappointed some blacks by applying for a
minority-owned television station while mayor of Charlotte, then
selling it for a profit.
   ``No wonder he has a swimming pool in his backyard and a tennis
court,'' Helms said.
   Asked about the Federal Communications Commission's findings
that Gantt had done nothing wrong in the transaction, Helms said,
``They just didn't investigate it.''
   Helms reasserted claims that Gantt's campaign is being
bankrolled by Helms' enemies.
   ``It's being paid for by homosexuals and lesbians,'' he said.
``They don't care all that much for Harvey Gantt. They want to get
this conservative voice out of the United States Senate. They do
not like what I do.''
   Helms tried to temper his opposition to homosexuality.
   ``People can do what they want to in the privacy of their own
homes,'' he said, ``but when they start marching in the street and
say that homosexuality should be given special privileges and be
treated as a normal lifestyle, you bet I say no.''
   Helms, who was unable to personally campaign in North Carolina
for many weeks because of a long session of Congress, said he's
found supporters enthusiastic since he returned. And he said with a
good turnout next Tuesday, election day, Republicans will triumph.

<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. said Thursday it
had completed its previously-disclosed plans to buy eight
Metropolitan-Legacy radio stations in a $360 million deal that it
called the biggest ever in radio.
   The purchase gives Westinghouse Broadcasting 21 radio stations
with an average cumulative audience of 14.1 million people a week,
second only to the 15 million-plus commanded by the 21 stations
owned by Capital Cities-ABC Inc.
   Westinghouse Broadcasting, also known as Group W, is buying the
stations from Metropolitan Broadcasting Corp. and Legacy
Broadcasting, which are controlled by broadcaster and financier
Robert F.X. Sillerman.
   Sillerman and his partners will retain a minority interest in
Group W Radio, which a source familiar with the deal said was less
than 10 percent.
   Group W, which is an operating unit of Westinghouse Electric
Corp. of Pittsburgh, announced in April it had agreed to buy 10
Metropolitan-Legacy stations in a deal reportedly valued at about
$385 million.
   But in the meantime, Metropolitan found a local buyer for its
two radio stations in Minneapolis and they were dropped from the
deal with Group W.
   The newly-acquired stations are WNEW-FM in New York; WMMR-FM in
Philadelphia; WCRX-FM and WCPT-AM in Washington, D.C.; WLLZ-FM in
Detroit; KILT-AM and KILT-FM in Houston and KTWV-FM in Los Angeles.
   ``Our acquisition of these extremely successful stations allows
us to compete for radio advertising revenue in nine of the top 10
U.S. markets,'' said Burton B. Staniar, chairman of Group W.
   He said the addition of the youth-oriented FM radio stations in
New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia to the company's AM
news-format stations in those cities will enable Westinghouse to
offer appealing package deals to advertisers in those markets.
   Staniar said the deal also gives Group W programming diversity
and size ``that makes our entry into the radio network and program
syndication businesses more financially attractive.''
   As it completed its purchase of the eight stations, Westinghouse
relinquished control of KODA-FM, its FM radio station in Houston.
Federal regulations prohibit companies from owning two FM radio
stations in the same market. The station was placed in a trust and
is being sold in a separate transaction to New York-based Command
Communications for $22 million.
   Group W Radio's other stations are: WBZ, Boston; WINS, New York;
KYW, Philadelphia; KDKA, Pittsburgh; WMAQ, Chicago; KQZY, Dallas;
KQXT, San Antonio; KMEO-AM and KMEO-FM, Phoenix; KFWB, Los Angeles;
KFBK-AM and KAER, Sacramento; and KJQY, San Diego.
   Westinghouse Broadcasting's other units are Group W Television,
which owns five network-affiliated television stations; Group W
Productions, a programming and synidication company, and Group W
Satellite Communications, a cable programming, marketing and
distribution business based in Stamford, Conn.

   `This Line Has Been Disconnected'
   Isn't Enough to Deter Elvis Fans

   NEW YORK -- Elvis Presley, check your answering machine.
It's all filled up.
   Musicians have been trying to connect with the slim,
gyrating rock legend turned porky Las Vegas self-parody who
died in his Graceland bathroom in 1977.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In fact, the King, who would have turned 57 on Jan. 8,
appears in the lyrics of more than 150 rock, folk and rap
songs, which a radio station here plans to bring together
Sunday night in a special titled "Calling Elvis." The show
takes its name from a recently released song by the rock band
Dire Straits.
   The planned six-hour special collects all the post-mortem
mentions of the man with the blue suede shoes. Some are
obvious references, such as Frank Zappa's "Elvis Has Just
Left the Building," which was an announcement made at the
conclusion of each of the King's concerts.
   Other songs are poignant. In "Hiawatha" Laurie Anderson
sings, "Hello, operator, get me Memphis." The response: "I
know who you're trying to reach, darlin', and he's not
there." Peter Holsapple simply asks of Mr. Presley, in his
song of the same name, "Elvis, what happened?"
   There are angry songs. A group calling itself Bird says,
in "Hey Elvis," that he ain't nothin' but a hound dog for not
sharing more of his wealth with Big Boy Crudup, who wrote
Elvis's monster hit, "That's Alright Mama." (When we last
checked, Elvis wasn't around to defend himself.)
   Other titles: "Graceland," (by Paul Simon), "Elvis Was a
Narc" (by Fred Koller and Al Anderson) and "Somewhere Elvis
Is Smiling" (by Keith Bradford).
   "His spirit is out there, no doubt," says Vin Scelsa, the
host and creator of "Calling Elvis." "I assume this is only
the beginning, and there are many more songs" that mention
the King.
   As for Elvis himself, in a recording from 1966, he held
out the promise, "I'll Be Back." And "Suspicious Minds"
(released in 1968) have wondered about his fate for nearly 15
years. Mr. Scelsa says: "He was supposed to come back New
Year's Eve. Maybe he's just late."
   The show, on classic rock station WXRK-FM, is the latest
example of radio's fascination with Elvis. Two radio stations
experimented with all-Elvis-all-the-time formats. One
switched to all-business news. The other dumped the King in
favor of religion.

TUNING IN TO CATCHY SLOGANS; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO: 'CLASSIC ROCK' AND 'MORE MUSIC' MAY SEEM LIKE LIGHTWEIGHT CLAIMS, BUT 
THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THAT GO INTO SUCH SAYINGS IS BIG BUSINESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Choosing from among the more than 80 radio stations in Southern California can 
be a confusing, even mind-boggling experience. 
</P>
<P>
If you're a nostalgic sort, do you tune in to the station "with more of your 
favorite oldies" (KRTH-FM)? Or to the one with "all oldies all the time" 
(KRLA-AM)? What about "non-stop oldies" (KODJ-FM)? 
</P>
<P>
There's also the option of the "only station for classic rock" (KLSX-FM). And 
another with "more music, more memories" (KLIT-FM). 
</P>
<P>
If it's information you're seeking, you might prefer the station with "more 
traffic, more often" (KNX-AM). But then what about the one that boasts of 
featuring "twice the traffic" (KFI-AM)? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe if you're stuck in twice the traffic, you'll actually find the time to 
sample all these stations. If you do, you'll find many slogans that are at best 
silly and nondescriptive, and, at worst, patently untrue. 
</P>
<P>
Take the claim being made by KXEZ-FM (formerly KJOI) that it is the "the only 
station for easy music." What about KBIG-FM, KOST-FM, KSRF-FM and KLIT-FM, 
which also play soft hits or "easy music?" 
</P>
<P>
Though slogans -- called "position statements" by the radio industry -- may 
seem like lightweight stuff, their research, development and selection is 
indeed big business. 
</P>
<P>
"They have these things tested and they spend lots of money on research," said 
J. Rae Padden, president of the local chapter of the Radio Advertising Bureau. 
"Somebody just doesn't walk in one morning and say, 'Let's say 'The Big Mix.' . 
. . Every station slogan -- whether you think it's good, bad or indifferent -- 
has been costed out and researched." 
</P>
<P>
The best slogans are catchy and pithy, according to broadcast consultant John 
Lund. 
</P>
<P>
"A slogan should be, in a nutshell, what's good in a radio station and gets you 
to listen," Lund said. It should also be, he noted, "unique, credible and 
beneficial." 
</P>
<P>
But credibility appears to be the least valued of the criteria. Truth in radio 
sloganeering is not strictly enforced. 
</P>
<P>
For example, KLSX contends that it is "the one station that everyone at work 
can agree on." KOST makes the same statement in one of its slogans. Are there, 
instead, two stations that everyone at work can agree on? Have employees even 
been polled on this matter? 
</P>
<P>
Jumping on the bandwagon when a slogan appears successful is a favorite pastime 
for radio stations. 
</P>
<P>
"If (the slogan) 'power pig' becomes a sensation in Tampa, then all of a sudden 
you've got stations all over the country calling themselves 'the power pig,' " 
said Ken Barnes, managing editor of Radio and Records, an industry publication. 
"To use another animal metaphor, it's very lemming-like." 
</P>
<P>
Station officials generally defend the practice of sloganeering, citing the 
advertising potential of the phrases. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're accentuating your positive and you say it enough times, it 
eventually will pay off," said KODJ promotion director Nicole Sandler. "Where 
it doesn't pay off is if it's not describing anything or if it's not true, then 
you're working against yourself." 
</P>
<P>
"They help you describe either how you perceive yourself to be or what they 
tell you you are, or what you hope you are," said Bob Griffiths, KXEZ-FM (98.7) 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes they seem to beat listeners over the head with a simple concept. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't take a rocket scientist to extrapolate that if KLSX is "the only 
station for classic rock," then it also plays "the most classic rock." And 
given those assertions, then there's no question that "at work, at home or in a 
car, when you hear classic rock, it's 97.1 KLSX." 
</P>
<P>
What exactly constitutes "classic rock" anyway? How does "classic rock" differ 
from those other classics that some call "oldies"? 
</P>
<P>
"In my definition, there's classic hits and there's classic rock," said Steve 
Ellis, KLSX program director. "You can hear classic hits on KODJ, KRLA, KRTH. 
We're classic rock. We're the Doors, the Who, Led Zeppelin and the Stones, and 
there's not another station doing that." 
</P>
<P>
But all those groups can be heard on the "the home of rock 'n' roll," KLOS-FM 
(95.5), just to the left of KLSX on the dial, as well as on at least half a 
dozen other stations. 
</P>
<P>
Although slogans are considered serious business by most station officials, 
some radio stations like to poke fun at the entire notion. KROQ-FM (106.7) 
boasts of being "the only Southern California station that doesn't call 
Wednesday 'hump day.' " "Pirate radio" KQLZ-FM (100.3) tells listeners, "Our 
ratings are so low it doesn't matter what we do." 
</P>
<P>
A key function of a slogan, said Radio and Records' Barnes, is to inspire 
listeners to remember the station -- especially if they are selected to be 
surveyed by a ratings service. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea is for that slogan to come out when they fill out that Arbitron diary 
or get a call from Birch (survey service)," Barnes said. "If you sledgehammer 
them enough with it, it will come to mind. You're not necessarily looking to 
make a profound, conscious impression. You're just trying to sink a hook into a 
listener's sub-conscious." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly enough, a slogan lacking in cleverness and originality may actually be to 
a station's advantage, posited consultant Lund. 
</P>
<P>
"If it requires you to think about it, you're down the tubes because the masses 
are bombarded with tens of thousands of advertising messages each day," Lund 
said. "And thinking is not something that the American public should be 
required to do when making a brand decision."

'JEFF AND JER' BOOST MORNING RATINGS FOR B100 RADIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN BRASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two months after making a well-publicized jump from KKYY-FM (Y95)to KFMB-FM 
(B100), morning pranksters Jerry St. James and Jeff Elliott have established 
themselves as the morning team to beat, according to the Arbitron ratings 
released Wednesday for the spring quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to a dramatic increase in B100's morning ratings share, the new 
ratings book shows the contemporary hits format of KKLQ (Q106) in first place 
overall, the position it has held for the past three years, with a 9.4 rating 
share among listeners 12 and over, down from a 10.3 share in the winter book. 
</P>
<P>
KSON, simulcast on AM (1240) and FM (97.3), again posted big numbers with its 
country format. After a respectable 6.7 share in the winter book, KSON moved up 
to a 7.5 share among listeners 12 and over in the spring, placing it second 
overall. The rock 'n' roll of KGB was third in the 12-plus category with a 7.1 
rating share, up from a 6.1 in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
Big jumps also were recorded by KCBQ-FM (105.3), which moved from a 2.6 to a 
3.6 with its oldies rock, and XHTZ (Z90), which switched from rock 'n' roll to 
a contemporary urban format in the spring and jumped from a .8 to a 1.9 share. 
</P>
<P>
A ratings share represents the percentage of the listening audience that tuned 
to the station for at least five minutes in an average quarter hour. Although 
they illustrate the overall size of a station's listening audience, the 12 and 
over numbers are generally discounted by radio station executives, who market 
their stations to specific demographic groups. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, KGB was number one in the 18-34 category, followed by Q106 and XTRA-FM 
(91X), while KSON won among listeners 25-54, followed by KGB, Q106 and the 
"Lites Out" jazz of KIFM (98.1). 
</P>
<P>
"There was more listenership in this book," although KIFM's ratings dropped 
slightly, said KIFM General Manager Bruce Walton. "We're doing a good job of 
keeping our listeners around, especially in the spring when (the start of 
Padres) baseball affects our men listeners." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of "Jeff and Jer," B100 scored big in the 25-54 age group, its key 
demographic target audience. In the last ratings book, for the winter quarter, 
B100 was ranked fifth in the morning among listeners 25-54 with a 6.0, while 
Y95 with "Jeff and Jer" was sixth with a 5.6 share. 
</P>
<P>
"Jeff and Jer" started work at B100 five weeks into the 12-week ratings period. 
But there is no doubt they made a substantial impact, posting an 8.3 share 
among listeners 25-54 years old. That was enough to move B100 into first place 
in the morning in the key 25-54 group, ahead of KSON's Jack Diamond and Lisa 
Bent with an 8.0 and the 7.1 rating posted by KFMB-AM's (760) Mac Hudson and 
Joe Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
B100 had been a perennial power in the morning since 1984, when the "B-Morning 
Zoo" starring the "Rich Brothers" debuted. In April, though, the station dumped 
the zoo concept and hired "Jeff and Jer." 
</P>
<P>
The station promoted the new show heavily, including throwing a large party and 
running television commercials featuring the duo with paper bags over their 
heads, a tactic that arose when Y95 refused to allow B100 to use the names of 
the pair until their Y95 contract expired. 
</P>
<P>
To a certain degree, the numbers can be attributed to increased listener 
sampling in the wake of numerous recent changes in morning programs. 
</P>
<P>
"That might have made the (ratings) jump a little quicker," KFMB General 
Manager Paul Palmer said. "We're dealing with people who were listening to the 
Zoo, who we were trying to keep, and a number of people who came over from 
other stations." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, B100 showed only a slight increase in the 12 and over category, moving 
from a 4.5 to a 4.8. KFMB-AM (760), buoyed by the San Diego Padres broadcasts, 
went from a 4.6 ratings share to a 6.7. 
</P>
<P>
In other significant ratings changes, the mellow music of KYXY-FM (96.5) 
dropped from a 5.0 to a 3.7 among listeners 12 and over, but the equally mellow 
format of KJQY-FM (Sunny 103) didn't pick up the slack. Once a ratings power, 
when it was known as "KJOY," Sunny 103 and its slightly more upbeat format, 
slipped from a 5.3 to a 4.4. 
</P>
<P>
The new rock of XTRA-FM (91X) posted a slight gain in the 12 and over category, 
going from a 4.3 to a 4.8 share, and KSDO-AM (1130) went from a 6.0 to a 5.7.

<P>
In the eyes of radio industry veteran Tom Holiday, the North County is an array 
of niches and valleys, a landscape dotted with opportunity and complications. 
</P>
<P>
"It is like the face of a Thomas Brothers English muffin," said Holiday, 
general manager of two North County-based stations, KOWF-FM (92.1) and KSPA-AM 
(1450). 
</P>
<P>
Something as basic as delivering signals over the hills and through the canyons 
and into the homes and cars of listeners becomes a challenge. His advice: "If 
you can't get a station, simply walk across the street." 
</P>
<P>
Holiday's operation is based in Escondido, which is also known as the "Hidden 
Valley" -- not the type of nickname a radio executive likes to hear. Like all 
North County radio stations, Holiday is constantly struggling to make people 
understand that the hoppin' country tunes of his popular FM station can be 
heard beyond the hills of Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Holiday's, there are five other radio operations in the North 
County, each attempting to find its own niche in the swirl of the Southern 
California radio market. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of tuning in far-off stations, an Encinitas resident can jam to the 
rock of "Magic 102" or the Top 40 hits of KKOS-FM (95.9), which is "North 
County and proud of it." Also programmed from bases in North County: mellow 
tunes, business news, religious programming and golden oldies. 
</P>
<P>
In a very real sense, North County is a distinct market, separated from urban 
San Diego by marketing strategies, as well as geography. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, North County basically seceded from San Diego, when Arbitron, the 
company that compiles ratings for stations throughout the country, began 
issuing a separate "book" for North County. The move came after heavy lobbying 
from North County radio executives, who didn't feel the San Diego ratings 
accurately reflected their home. 
</P>
<P>
Alone, North County is the 62nd largest of the 252 markets in the country, 
according to Arbitron, comparable in size to Las Vegas and Austin, Tex. Unlike 
Las Vegas or Austin, the area is not isolated; it's not an island. In addition 
to San Diego stations, powerful Los Angeles stations are easily picked up by 
North County residents, many of whom have recently moved from Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
The intrusion of Los Angeles stations is simply one quirk in a very quirky 
radio market. Of course, quirky is not necessarily a negative to radio industry 
and marketing professionals, who try to use an area's special characteristics 
to attract listeners and advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
"The North County is one reason we're pouring a million dollars into 
(upgrading) our AM signal to 50,000 watts at night," said Paul Palmer, general 
manager of KFMB-AM (760) and FM (B100). "With growth, we wanted to be even 
stronger there." 
</P>
<P>
Palmer and others are simply responding to the numbers game that powers the 
radio industry. Rating numbers decide whether a station is succeeding or 
failing. Demographic numbers -- data about the population, ranging from the 
number of people and their ages to the amount of money they earn -- dictate the 
potential of a market. 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers for North County look good: The area's population increased from 
288,979 to 616,793 in the 1980s, according to the San Diego Assn. of 
Governments, making it one of the fastest-growing markets in the country. Most 
of the influx, marketing experts say, came in the form of upwardly mobile, 
middle-class, young families. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people perceive it as fairly upscale," said Nancy Duvall, media director 
for Chapman/Warwick, an advertising and public relations firm. "There is a good 
strong Baby-Boomer group." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the population growth have come hundreds of new businesses that want 
to advertise their presence. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of retail sales is incredible," said Jeff Chandler, owner of 
KKOS-FM and KCEO-AM (1000) in Carlsbad. "If you look at what was here 15 years 
ago, it was just the Plaza Camino Real (shopping center) and a whole bunch of 
car dealers." 
</P>
<P>
Revenues of radio stations throughout the county, North County included, have 
increased dramatically in the last few years, even surpassing the pace of the 
county's growth. According to figures compiled by the San Diego Broadcasters 
Assn., the earnings of San Diego stations have grown by 10% to 20% a year for 
the past few years, one of the fastest rates of growth in the country. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic jams help explain the increase. 
</P>
<P>
People listen to their radios in their cars, which is one reason Los Angeles is 
such a powerful radio market. As the San Diego freeways increasingly resemble 
Los Angeles freeways, the radio audience has grown. 
</P>
<P>
North County is a patchwork of suburban communities whose residents get in 
their cars to go to work five days a week, and who on their off days go to 
beaches and parks -- prime activities to match with radio listening. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, even the emphasis on the automobile has its quirks for North County 
radio stations, according to some radio executives. Arbitron distributes its 
ratings diaries based on ZIP codes. But many of those holding North County 
diaries, the theory goes, get in their cars and drive to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"If they listen in San Diego, it's not a fair representation for us," said Greg 
Stevens, program director for KGMG-FM (Magic 102). 
</P>
<P>
But the numbers don't lie. There is no downplaying the size or importance of 
the North County audience. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like the whole market has grown up with the population growth," said 
Dave Ruhlman, who spent 13 years as co-owner and general manager of KOWN (now 
KOWF), before taking over the reins of KPRZ (1210), a religious station based 
in San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
While there are few dominant personalities at the North County stations, the 
level of professionalism both on and off the air has increased in recent years. 
Industry veterans, such as former KFMB-FM personality Scott Kenyon at KKOS-FM 
and Greg Stevens of Magic 102, are key players. 
</P>
<P>
Each North County station has its own programming niche -- from the Top 40 rock 
of KKOS-FM to the country of KOWF. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one of the few markets I've been in that is under-radioed," said Bob 
Jacobson, general manager of KMLO (107.1). "There is no duplication; 
advertisers have a better opportunity to target an audience." 
</P>
<P>
Each of the North County-based stations approaches the market differently. 
</P>
<P>
KGMG-FM, for example, often seems to be trying to detach itself from its North 
County roots. Although it is based in Oceanside, the FM has an "auxiliary 
studio" in Kearny Mesa and it has been attempting to move its transmitter tower 
farther south, in order to better reach San Diego. Last year it installed 
"repeaters" in San Diego, which helped boost its signal in previously 
hard-to-reach areas. 
</P>
<P>
It's not so much that Magic 102 wants to disown its North County base, program 
director Greg Stevens said, it just doesn't want to limit itself to one area. 
</P>
<P>
When he first arrived in North County, the station "scrupulously avoided 
talking about North County exclusively," Stevens said. "Our way not to be 
limited to the North County was to ignore it on the air. That was a little 
naive of us." 
</P>
<P>
Magic executives don't feel they should be limited to North County, simply 
because that's where their transmitter is located and their Federal 
Communications Commission license carries an Oceanside address. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where KGB's transmitter is located, but they're not out there 
saying, 'We're Spring Valley and we're proud of it,' " Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the other North County stations focus on their home area simply because 
they have no other choice. Their signals are not as strong as Magic's, making 
it difficult for them to reach into San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The Fallbrook-based KMLO doesn't even dream of reaching San Diego with its 
mellow music format. But it does covet the audience in the rapidly growing 
Temecula Valley in Riverside County to the north. 
</P>
<P>
"Our station is uniquely situated to serve both counties," said KMLO's 
Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the North County stations are identifiable as North County 
by their advertisements and news, which tend to be localized. 
</P>
<P>
"Our emphasis on being a North County station is primarily in the information 
we give listeners," said Holiday of KOWF. "Our listeners already know (we're 
based in the North), so we focus on information." 
</P>
<P>
More than satisfied to be thought of as a North County station, he has no 
burning desire to try to move his signal into urban San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"By the time we develop ourselves as North County's country station and 
saturated our potential here," Holiday said, "there is going to be a population 
shift and most of the county's population will be in the North County. Then why 
bother?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Signals From North County 
</P>
<P>
Although a North County resident with a solid antenna can pick up dozens of 
stations from as far away as Mexico and Los Angeles, there are only five 
operations that call the area home: 
</P>
<P>
KKOS-FM (95.9): With Scott Kenyon, formerly a member of B100's Rich Brothers, 
helping to shape the musical format, this ratings power is clearly hoping its 
Top 40/contemporary format will take a slice out of B100's large young-adult 
market. 
</P>
<P>
KCEO-AM (1000): The AM sister to KKOS, it programs business and financial news. 
</P>
<P>
KGMG-FM (Magic 102): Recently switched to more of an album-oriented rock format 
after three years as a classic rock station. Morning show is called "The Rude 
Boys." 
</P>
<P>
KGMG-AM (1320): Recently switched to an "easy listening" format. 
</P>
<P>
KPRZ-AM (1210): North County's newest station features religious programming. 
</P>
<P>
KOWF-FM (92.1): The "KOW" is attempting to be North County's country station, 
battling the San Diego-based KSON-FM (97.3) for the foot-stomping hearts of 
North Countians. 
</P>
<P>
KSPA-AM (1450): The AM sister to KOWF calls itself the "Station of the Stars," 
programming middle-of-the-road hits from such artists as Frank Sinatra, Robert 
Goulet and Jack Jones.

<HL> Statistics on Women Lead to New Recipe Called Lady Radio --- Ohio Station Tests Format Aimed Solely at Females, Has Syndication Plans </HL>
<AUTHOR> Constance Mitchell (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> TEL MKT </IN>
<TEXT>
   In Columbus, Ohio, radio station WLRO-FM bills itself for women only. 
And if Mitchell Greenwald is successful, more such stations could join the airwaves. 

   Mr. Greenwald is president of Lady Radio Inc., which he founded with his father, William, an advertising agency executive. 
They designed a programming format aimed at women that blends adult contemporary music with tidbits of news and information. 
In January, they began testing the format at WLRO, where Mitchell Greenwald is sales manager. 
The Greenwalds plan to syndicate the programming to other stations. 

   Will the format sizzle or fizzle? 

   While surveys suggest women don't seek this special attention, Mr. Greenwald believes the statistics are on his side. 
He notes that working women devote 63% of their media listening time to radio, vs. 52% for white-collar working men, and he says women also are considered "power buyers," which has made them increasingly attractive to advertisers. 

   "Women often make the dominant purchasing decisions" when families acquire big-ticket items like cars and appliances, Mr. Greenwald contends. 
Lady Radio has attracted a few national advertisers already. 
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. offers a daily Wall Street roundup, L'eggs Products, the Winston-Salem, N.C.-based hosiery company, airs "Women on the Move" and Avon Products Inc., the New York-based cosmetics and apparel company, provides fashion tips. 
Local doctors and attorneys offer professional advice. 

   But some radio analysts consider the all-feminine format a recipe for failure. 
"It panders to women, and if there is one thing you can't do today, it's pander to women," maintains Jerry Del Colliano, publisher of Inside Radio, an industry newsletter. 
"It's been tried before and failed. 
I can boldly predict that this one won't get off the ground, either." 

   In the 1970s, several stations with all-female formats and disk jockeys were introduced -- some with a hard-line feminist orientation -- but they didn't attract enough listeners to stay alive. 
Unlike those stations, Lady Radio employs DJs of both sexes, hoping the mix will encourage not only women but men to tune in. 

   Lady Radio, promoted as "another nice thing to put on every day," favors familiar top-40 hits and less frequently played album cuts by pop stars like Barbra Streisand, Steve Winwood, Dan Fogelberg and Carly Simon. 
News and special features are captured in one-minute and two-minute capsules aired four times every hour. 

   Station announcers attempt to be conversant advisers, updating listeners on the latest trends and surveys about health, fashion, beauty, careers and fitness. 
Morning listeners are assumed to be stay-at-home mothers and hear discussions on child care and health. 

   When the office set is tuned in, Lady Radio offers tips on office lifestyles. 
"How to negotiate with a non-negotiating boss" was a recent feature. 
Late-night items emphasize entertainment news. 

   Advertisers won't know whether Lady Radio is catching on with listeners until July, when the next Arbitron market-share ratings are due. 
But the station claims to be attracting working and non-working women between the ages of 25 and 44, and far more male listeners than expected. 
"Some (men) like the music, but others just want a better understanding of women," says the younger Mr. Greenwald. 

   But to Mr. Del Colliano, the newsletter publisher, that some men listen doesn't much matter. 
"Even if men do listen, they won't admit it to the ratings company," he contends.

   Mel Gibson said he was torn between becoming a
journalist or a chef after graduating from high school when his
sister submitted an application in his name to a drama school.
   Now, the 32-year-old Gibson said, ``My sister wants 10 percent.''
   The Australian-born star of the recently released film ``Tequila
Sunrise'' said in the Jan. 12 issue of Rolling Stone that he was
``terrified'' on the set of ``Mad Max,'' the 1979 low-budget film
that made more than $100 million worldwide and catapulted him to
stardom.
   Gibson played down his good looks, for which People magazine
named him ``Sexiest Man Alive'' in 1984, and called his craft ``the
art of lying well.''
   ``With acting you can do extreme things,'' he said. ``It's kind
of good to be able to supersede human nature by becoming someone
else in a film. ... I'm paid to tell elaborate lies.''

   Despite a reputation as one of the
nation's rising young conductors and guest appearances with the New
York Philharmonic and other major orchestras, Raymond Harvey says
strangers still ask what railroad he works for when he is introduced
as a conductor.
   ``There are times when you just wish people's minds were more
open,'' said the 37-year-old director of the Springfield Symphony,
who calls it an ``embarrassment'' that he can still count the number
of black symphony conductors on the fingers of one hand.
   ``It just takes a confidence in your own abilities and courage to
do what you think is right and what you are talented for, whether or
not there are a lot of role models around,'' he said.
   Harvey, who holds a doctorate from Yale, was associate director
of the Buffalo Philharmonic before coming to Springfield.
   ``I consider myself a conductor, who happens to be black, and not
a black conductor,'' Harvey said. ``I have a rule that the first
time I appear with an orchestra it will not be in a Martin Luther
King or Black History Month concert. I like doing those kinds of
concerts, but not for the first time I appear with an orchestra.''

   Red bow ties will be the order of the day
Friday in honor of Thad Eure's 19,009th and final day as North
Carolina's secretary of state.
   Gov. Jim Martin has been asked to proclaim Friday ``Red Bow Tie
Day'' in honor of Eure and the trademark tie he has worn to work
every day for 52 years.
   The 89-year-old Eure is the nation's longest-serving secretary of
state, having taken office Dec. 21, 1936.
   Martin will be among those sporting a red tie at a Capitol
Rotunda reception Friday sponsored by Elon College to honor Eure,
who has been a member of the college's Board of Trustees since 1946.
   ``Thad Eure is North Carolina's most beloved statesman,'' said
Elon President Fred Young. ``We are pleased to join others in
celebrating his unparalleled record of service on the occasion of
his final day as secretary of state.''

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson returns to radio in
February with twice-daily 90-second vignettes focused on issues that
affect blacks, it was announced Friday.
   ``The Jesse Jackson Commentary'' premieres Feb. 1 and is
scheduled for syndicated broadcast on more than 120 radio stations
coast-to-coast, said Bob Dockery Jr., president of Syndicate It
Productions.
   ``We are excited to have someone as dynamic as Jesse Jackson back
on the air,'' Dockery said in a press release. ``Certainly there is
no more eloquent spokesperson for Americans than Jesse Jackson. He
transcends race, color and creed, and has a true understanding of
the problems that face us all.''
   Jackson did a similar radio program from 1985 to the summer of
1987 before he suspended the show to run for the Democratic
presidential nomination that went to Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis.

LOW-RATED KEDG-FM TO CHANGE ITS FORMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KEDG-FM 101.9(the Edge), the troubled radio station that was a favorite of the 
record industry and adults with a taste for adventuresome rock, will play its 
last song Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
The station will become K-LITE, changing its format from album-oriented rock to 
adult contemporary music beginning Saturday morning, executive vice president 
and general manager Bill Ward said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Where listeners had heard such critically acclaimed new artists as the Cowboy 
Junkies and Melissa Etheridge as well as such veteran figures as Bruce 
Springsteen and Elvis Costello, they will now hear Barbra Streisand, Neil 
Diamond, Diana Ross and Barry Manilow, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
Ward expects that the new station will attract a larger audience than KEDG did 
and will fill the void left last month when another adult contemporary music 
station, also called K-LITE, went off the air to give way to KQLZ, "pirate 
radio." 
</P>
<P>
"We chose this format because K-LITE had a very loyal and large following and 
it was on the air in the market for about 3 years," Ward said. "We felt there 
was an obvious void and that it would be a real good companion station to our 
AM station, KMPC." 
</P>
<P>
Ward said the change in formats was due to KEDG's low Arbitron ratings, which 
put KEDG's audience at about 14,700 listeners, or a .9 share. 
</P>
<P>
Loyal listeners and employees at "the Edge" were shocked when they heard of 
KEDG's demise, which was announced to the staff Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
"The deejays are just the greatest," said listener Kay Reindl, 23, of Reseda. 
"All my friends listened to it. We thought nothing could touch 'the Edge.' " 
</P>
<P>
Said J.J. Jackson, the station's program director: "We were completely blown 
away. The general manager's a very nice man but I just think he didn't 
understand what we were trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
What Jackson, who also functions as music director and deejay, was trying to do 
was "widen the parameters" of a rock station by playing mainstream favorites. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt there had to be enough people in enough numbers to support a station 
that had parameters as wide as we do," Jackson said. "We purposely didn't want 
that hipper-than-thou attitude that many stations get. We just tried to play 
those parameters real wide but keep away from formula bands." 
</P>
<P>
For Ward, the station's philosophy -- and its playlist -- didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"It was quite inconsistent," he said. "The programming was never exactly in the 
position we had hoped it would be." But Ward said the decision to change 
formats was aimed at attracting a larger audience. "It has nothing to do with 
personal taste at all," he said. "It's purely a business decision." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson said he thought the station was not given enough time to catch on and 
had not received sufficient promotion. 
</P>
<P>
In spite of that, the audience, which he said "had the most intelligent 
listeners -- doctors, lawyers, television producers, artists," had actually 
grown in the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
"We still get people all the time who say 'Gee I just found your radio 
station,' " Jackson said. " We did all this with word of mouth." 
</P>
<P>
The station made its debut as KMPC-FM in October, 1987. In March, its call 
letters were changed to KEDG to avoid confusion with its popular sister 
station, KMPC-AM, Ward said.

<HEAD>Detroit Classical Station No Longer Broadcasting From Ivory Tower</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM IRWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's 5 p.m. on a Monday in Detroit, and disc
jockey Dave Wagner is shepherding motorists home with the usual
rush-hour mix of traffic reports, weather updates and short,
up-tempo compact disc recordings.
   ``Music of Mario Castel-Nuovo Tedesco,'' Wagner says as the
acoustic guitar piece ends. ``Say that 10 times real fast.''
   Also on the playlist are baroque piano renditions of ``Hey
Jude'' and ``All You Need Is Love'' from ``Bach Meets the Beatles''
and Stravinsky's ``Circus Polka'' _ ``possibly the only piece ever
written for an audience with peanuts on their breath,'' Wagner says.
   It's classical music. And Wagner and his colleagues at WQRS-FM
are taking a decidedly unclassical approach to presenting it.
   ``This place is a lot of yuks,'' he says.
   Wagner, 39, is no dilettante DJ-for-hire. He has a doctorate in
music from the University of Michigan, belongs to the American
Organists Society and is choirmaster at St. Paul's Roman Catholic
Church in Grosse Pointe Farms.
   But he's serious about dusting off classical music and making it
more appealing to a younger, increasingly affluent radio audience.
   ``I play mostly things in major keys _ short pieces, without a
lot of commentary,'' said Wagner, program director at WQRS and its
evening drive-time host since 1980.
   ``We're not only giving them reasons to listen. We're giving
them reasons not to turn us off.''
   WQRS is among the increasing numbers of commercial,
classical-format stations stressing entertainment and shedding
self-imposed roles as cultural custodians, according to Peter
Besheer, executive vice president of the New York-based Concert
Music Network.
   ``The adjective that would describe these newer stations would
be `friendly,''' he said. ``They would minimize talk and focus on
providing real emphasis on the music and introduce it in an
inviting way.
   ``By contrast, the old-line stations tend to be elitist, a bit
stuffy and believe they have a social obligation to make people
hear what they want them to hear. They view their job as to educate
the listener. The modern station is much less patronizing, less
paternalistic.''
   Some traditional listeners remain, including an older woman who
phones Wagner to say he incorrectly identified a Chopin piece as
``Opus 25'' instead of ``Opus 10.''
   ``It's the music police!'' yelps Wagner, jumping up to check the
label and tell the caller she is indeed correct. ``Only at a
classical station will people do that.''
   As for newer listeners, he says: ``This big yuppie generation is
growing up. ... They want to try something different besides the
Chuck Berry songs they grew up with.''
   Despite efforts at WQRS and elsewhere to broaden classical
music's appeal, the format never will dominate commercial radio.
   Of more than 10,000 U.S. stations, only 34 commercial outlets
broadcast classics full time, Besheer said. But more than half of
them have revamped their programming and their staffs in ways
similar to WQRS, he said.
   The Arbitron ratings service ranked WQRS 19th in the 26-station
Detroit market in the fall of 1987. But its majority owner, Boston
businessman Howard ``Woody'' Tanger, said ratings fail to reflect
the new listeners' affluence and their attractiveness to
advertisers.
   Between its founding in 1960 and 1985, when Tanger acquired it
for a reported $5 million, WQRS was run as a money-losing tax
shelter that carried as few as two ads an hour, Wagner said.
   Tanger said during a telephone interview that WQRS and its
sister station, WTMI-FM in Miami, are profitable. He declined to
give specific figures but said earnings from both will allow him to
acquire WFLN-FM in Philadelphia _ a traditional classical station.
That deal is pending.
   ``Our philosophy is simple _ we believe we play the `Top 40' of
classical music,'' Tanger said. ``We attempt to minimize the
chatter. We encourage our people on the air to be personalities. We
don't embrace the concept of teaching.
   ``We are still considered by some in the industry to be
renegades,'' Tanger said. ``But I know what we are doing is the
wave of the future.
   ``We do have listeners who alternate between AOR (album-oriented
rock), classic rock and classical music,'' he said. ``The two are
not inconsistent. Times have changed. ... we view every radio
station as a competitor.''
   ``A lot of people are coming to us straight from rock,'' Wagner
said. ``A lot of people say, `I've never listened to classical
music, but I like your approach and you don't make me feel stupid
when I listen to it.'
   ``Obviously, I do that by being stupider than anybody else.''

<HEAD>TV, Radio Stations Asked to Prove Compliance With FCC Political
Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT NAYLOR JR.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission will
examine information from 30 major market television and radio
stations asked to show that they are offering political candidates
the lowest possible advertising rates.
   The FCC on Monday began its first-ever audits of broadcasters,
prompted by what an agency news release called an ``obligation to
assure that broadcast stations are complying with political
programming laws and rules, especially in an election year.''
   The audits were not the result of any complaint, said Milton
Graves, chief of the FCC's political division.
   ``This is just a part of overseeing how the stations are
complying,'' he said. ``We want to know what their practices are.''
   The FCC sent field inspectors to stations in Cincinnati,
Dallas-Ft. Worth, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Portland, Ore. In
each city, they visited four television stations, an AM radio
station and an FM radio station.
   ``These cities were selected because they are geographically
diverse and also because, in some instances, the stations serve
more than one state,'' the FCC said.
   Inspectors asked the stations for political files for the 1990
elections, rate cards for political and commercial advertisers,
commercial invoices, program logs and statements from the stations
regarding pricing structures and methods of calculating ``lowest
unit'' charges for political candidates.
   They were given 20 days to send the FCC data on rates for
non-political advertisers but were asked to provide the political
information immediately, Graves said.
   He said auditors in the agency's Washington office will
``examine all the information that's provided to us.''
   Under FCC regulations, the lowest unit charge is available to
political candidates 45 days before primary balloting and six days
before a general election. Candidates may purchase single broadcast
advertisements for the same price as commercial advertisers who buy
a number of spots in the same time period.
   Graves said most of the field auditors completed their work
Monday but that their jobs were ``just the beginning'' of the
auditing process.
   Spokeswoman Briana Gowing said the action was an unusual one.
   ``Apparently the FCC has never before done anything like this
before,'' she said.
   The stations are:
   _Cincinnati: WCPO-TV, WKRC-TV, WLWL-TV, WIII-TV, WCKY-AM and
WWNK-FM.
   _Dallas: KDFW-TV, KXAS-TV, WFAA-TV, KTXA-TV, KRLD-AM and KPLX-FM.
   _Philadelphia: KYW-TV, WCAU-TV, WPVI-TV, WGBS-TV, WPEN-AM and
WWDB-FM.
   _Portland: KATU-TV, KGW-TV, KOIN-TV, KPTV-TV, KWJJ-AM and
KKSN-FM.
   _San Francisco: KGO-TV, KRON-TV, KTVU-TV, KOFY-TV, KNBR-AM and
KABL-FM.

LASZLO &amp; GARY PUT PARODY TO MUSIC

Instead of dropping coins into a jukebox at their booth, a duo who parody 
Top-40 songs can create their own tunes at a Sherman Oaks '50s-style diner. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Duke of Earl' could be 'Quart of Oil,' " says Gary Kleinman, 36, who looks 
like a skinny version of actor Ted Danson. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Dream Lover' would be 'No Such Thing,' " says Kleinman's partner in parody, 
Charles Laszlo, "and 'Chantilly Lace' could be 'I Lost the Race,' for the L.A. 
Marathon." 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo &amp; Gary, who became known for their parodies in 1985 with 
"Su-Sushi-O," a takeoff on Phil Collins' "Sussudio," are anticipating another 
hit during National Secretary's Week, which begins Monday. "My Boss Is Lazy," a 
parody of the Fine Young Cannibals' song "She Drives Me Crazy," is being 
considered for morning-drive play on local contemporary and rock music stations 
such as KQLZ-FM (100.3). The parody already has aired on KLSX-FM's (97.1) "The 
Dr. Demento Show," as well as that show's nationally syndicated version. 
Between gulps of a chocolate malt, Laszlo, a 36-year-old Reseda resident with 
the rapid-fire wit of a teen-age class clown, explains the plight of morning 
drivers. "People drive and think, 'I've only got 26 years, eight months and 
three days before retirement, I've got to pay electric bills, etc.' We want 
people to laugh instead." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone can identify with this song," adds Gary, who lives in Canoga Park. "I 
don't care how high up the ladder you are, you think you have a boss that is 
lazy." 
</P>
<P>
The song features hapless employee Doodlesby, whose voice reminds one of Radar 
O'Reilly, talking with his employer, Mr. Calhoun. The belligerent boss demands 
that Doodlesby work out for him as well as fax his briefcase. Lyrics include: 
"He's a lazy dweeb/ He wrote the book/ He needs two desks/ One for his foot." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Demento, a.k.a. Barry Hansen, praised the song and its creators. "It's a 
good song, and the response to it has been good," he said. "I put Laszlo &amp; 
Gary in the class of professional jobs. I get all kinds of songs sent to me, 
like people who just sing along with Michael Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo &amp; Gary record all parodies from scratch, rather than recording over 
someone else's music, which is why "My Boss Is Lazy" took about 50 hours 
instead of about four to produce. They write their pieces together. Laszlo 
performs the character voices, and Gary handles the music and singing voices. 
Occasionally, putting together parodies drives them to extremes. 
</P>
<P>
"One Sunday, we were doing a parody and needed the sound of a Mack truck," Gary 
says. "We needed the sound effect by Monday morning. We followed a Mack truck 
for 90 minutes down the freeway, trying to get him to blow his horn. He finally 
did it." 
</P>
<P>
The two got together in 1978 when Detroit-native Laszlo -- who majored in 
radio, TV and film production at Wayne State University -- answered an ad Gary 
placed in a magazine. He moved west to create a radio commercial with Gary, who 
earned a bachelor's degree in finance from Cal State Northridge in 1974. They 
wrote radio jingles and performed as stand-up comics until 1985, when they 
decided to concentrate solely on song parodies. Since radio stations do not pay 
them for their work, they also have day jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't tell you what they are," Laszlo says. "But we're either waiters or 
corporate executives." 
</P>
<P>
The key to a successful parody, both agree, is an excessive familiarity with a 
popular song. "It should be a hit record that stations have played almost too 
much," Gary says. "Listeners can sing the lyrics, and then you hit them with 
something funny." 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo &amp; Gary are preparing their first record album, which will combine 
parodies of popular songs with original creations. "We'd never do an album of 
all originals," Gary says. "They'd have to be exceptionally funny, since they 
aren't familiar." Gary says that three small pop/rock/urban record companies 
are interested in making the album. 
</P>
<P>
One song scheduled to be included, "I'm a Sensitive '90s Guy," a pop takeoff of 
Christine Lavin's "Sensitive New Age Guys," parodies the touchy-feely crystal 
age. "I like to cry at weddings/I think Rambo is upsetting," the song broods. 
</P>
<P>
And once they exhaust Top-40 songs and their original ideas, what will Laszlo 
&amp; Gary parody? "Probably marching bands and sound effects," Gary says. 
</P>
<P>
But his partner has other ideas. "Sports fishermen and parodies with 
subtitles," says Laszlo.

<HEAD>Westinghouse Agrees to Buy 10 Radio Stations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. Inc. has
tentatively agreed to buy the 10 Metropolitan-Legacy radio stations
in a deal that it said would create the nation's second-largest
radio station group.
   Westinghouse Broadcasting, which is also known as Group W,
already owns 14 radio stations: 8 AM stations and 6 FM stations.
   ``With this one agreement, the company that inaugurated radio
broadcasting in America in 1920 will dramatically increase its base
of operations, which will insure that Westinghouse will remain the
first name in radio on into the next century,'' Richard Harris,
Group W Radio chairman, said in a statement Thursday.
   Terms of the purchase were not disclosed, but one condition of
the proposed agreement called for repayment of the outstanding debt
of Legacy Broadcasting and Metropolitan Broadcasting for no more
than $135 million.
   The New York Times reported today that the sale was believed to
be worth about $385 million, making it the largest radio deal ever.
   New York-based Westinghouse Broadcasting said it had signed a
letter of intent to buy AM and FM stations in Washington, Houston
and Minneapolis and FM stations in New York, Los Angeles, Detroit
and Philadelphia.
   It said the deal is subject to reaching a definitive agreement
as well as approval by the appropriate boards of directors and
government regulators.
   If the deal were completed, Westinghouse said it would be
required by Federal Communications Commission rules to sell one of
the two Houston FM stations that it would then own. It said it
would seek a waiver of FCC rules so that it could operate the FM
station in Philadelphia, where it already owns an AM station and a
television station.
   Westinghouse said the deal would create a radio station group
second only to Capital Cities-ABC Inc.'s ABC Radio Station Group in
annual sales.
   The top officials of the Metropolitan Legacy stations are
Chairman Robert F.X. Sillerman and Vice Chairman Carl E. Hirsh.
   The statement said Sillerman, a veteran broadcaster, would
retain a minority interest in Group W Radio under terms of the deal.
   Burton B. Staniar, chairman of Westinghouse Broadcasting, said
the transaction would strengthen Group W's ability to serve several
local communities and give it a presence in nine of the top 10 U.S.
markets.
   He said it would also provide ``important new sales synergies''
for Group W that could offer advertisers combination buys of AM and
FM stations in a number of cities.
   The stations that would be acquired are WNEW-FM, New York;
KTWV-FM, Los Angeles; WMMR-FM, Philadelphia; WCXR-FM and WCPT-AM,
Washington, D.C.; WLLZ-FM, Detroit; KILT-AM and KILT-FM, Houston;
and KDWB-AM and KDWB-FM, Minneapolis.
   Group W already owns WBZ-AM, Boston; WINS-AM, New York; KYW-AM,
Philadelphia; KDKA-AM, Pittsburgh; WMAQ-AM, Chicago; KODA-FM,
Houston; KQZY-FM, Dallas-Fort Worth; KQXT-FM, San Antonio; KMEO-AM
and KMEO-FM, Phoenix; KFWB-AM, Los Angeles; KFBK-AM and KAER-FM,
Sacramento; and KJQY-FM, San Diego.
   Westinghouse Broadcasting is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Westinghouse Electric Corp., based in Pittsburgh.

KBET RADIO TRIES PROGRAM TRADING TO STAY ON AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The only radio station in the Santa Clarita Valley, which was late in debuting 
on the air a year ago, is now battling against an early exit. 
</P>
<P>
KBET, beset with financial and legal problems, last Tuesday indefinitely laid 
off its five on-air personalities -- without pay -- and temporarily changed its 
programming to air only Beatles songs, said Carl Goldman, a consultant brought 
in to oversee the station's restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the station's owner, Canyon Broadcasters Inc. in Canyon Country, is 
negotiating to sell the 1,000-watt station to an unidentified party, said Paul 
Rossilli, one of the company's investors. 
</P>
<P>
Until its switch to Beatles music a week ago, the station (1220 AM) offered a 
combination of contemporary music, news and other programs with on-air 
personalities such as "Barry and the Beast," two morning broadcast disc 
jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
But the format "was not getting enough advertising support" and KBET "was 
definitely losing money," even though the station was an alternative to the 
otherwise bad radio reception that the valley's 150,000 residents receive, 
Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
One problem: The station decided the adult contemporary music it played failed 
to enlist a strong following because it was too broad, including everything 
"from Bon Jovi to Chuck Berry," Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
The station is now playing recordings of various artists while it decides 
whether to go with a narrower adult contemporary program, oldies or 
country-Western music. Once that's decided, KBET will decide which of its 
on-air personalities will be called back, Goldman said. Five other KBET 
employees have continued working. 
</P>
<P>
KBET hit the airwaves June 28, 1989, more than six months behind schedule. It 
was a contentious debut because Larry Bloomfield of Canyon Country, who tried 
for years to establish the station, was fired as KBET's president two months 
earlier by the station's other owners. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, Bloomfield and Canyon Broadcasters filed suits against each other 
in Superior Court, claiming the other was responsible for cost overruns and 
delays in the station's start-up. Canyon Broadcasters is hoping to quickly 
resolve the suits before the station is sold, Rossilli said.

<HL> Futures Markets: Soybean Prices Surge as Radio Report On Plant Disease Incites Speculators </HL>
<AUTHOR> Scott Kilman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<IN> CMD MIN PET </IN>
<TEXT>
   Soybean prices jumped yesterday after speculators heard Chicago radio commentator Paul Harvey rehash old news about a mysterious disease that suddenly kills soybean plants. 

   Grain brokers were stunned when Mr. Harvey's noon broadcast about "sudden death syndrome in the soybean fields" helped fuel a buying binge in the last 10 minutes of trading, apparently on speculation that the disease could wipe out part of the crop. 

   "We were inundated with phone calls," said Steve Freed, a grain analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. 
"It was the old buy the rumor and sell the fact." 

   Like Mr. Freed, most traders discounted the report. 
Nonetheless, the soybean contract for March delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade closed at $6.335 a bushel, up 13 cents. 
Traders said the radio report probably added five cents to a rally that was already being fueled by growing investor interest in soybeans by money-management funds. 

   Researchers at the University of Illinois, which Mr. Harvey said may have found a chemical that prevents the disease, were also flooded with phone calls. 

   "Paul Harvey should be dropped in boiling water," fumed Prof. Malcolm Shurtleff, a plant pathologist. 

   According to Mr. Shurtleff, the university told Illinois soybean growers last summer it was studying an unknown disease that had killed some soybean plants growing in poor soil, but that the disease wasn't a big threat. 
U.S. researchers first noticed the disease in 1967, he said. 

   A secretary for Mr. Harvey said he got the material for the broadcast from a newswire report. 

   Speculation aside, traders said prices were helped by renewed investor interest in soybeans by fund managers. 
With stockpiles falling, exports rising and the prospect of a slight increase in soybean acreage this spring, some analysts say prices could top $8 a bushel if poor weather hurts yields. 
"The speculative capital is starting to come in," a grain trader said. 

   Corn-futures prices rose and wheat-futures prices slipped. 

   And now, the rest of the story. In other commodity markets yesterday:
   COPPER: Futures prices fluctuated widely but ended lower because of a drop in housing starts and greater availability of the metal. 
The March contract on New York's Commodity Exchange settled at $1.045 a pound, down 1.3 cents. 
After trading as high as $1.066 a pound early in the session, the March price dropped to $1.005 before rebounding "with a vengeance," according to one analyst, to recover most of the decline. 
The Commerce Department yesterday reported that housing starts fell 1.9% in January to a seasonally adjusted 1.4-million-unit pace. 
This followed a revised 15.5% drop in December. 
As a result, dealers and some construction firms affected by the two-month drop in housing starts are offering materials more freely, said Robert Wylde, president of R.J. Wylde Metals Inc., a New York metals brokers. 
This has caused premiums for March-delivery copper to drop about two cents from a week ago to about four cents over the Comex futures quotation, he said. 

   ENERGY: Despite positive-looking inventory statistics, heating-oil futures were battered again as the New York harbor barge strike entered its second day. 
Heating oil dropped 0.79 cent, to 45.58 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
Crude oil closed six cents lower, at $16.61 a barrel. 
Gasoline was boosted by American Petroleum Institute weekly data that showed a sharp fall in U.S. supplies. 
Surprisingly, a similarly sharp API downturn in heating oil didn't help, apparently because it only reflected shiftings of supplies within the industry in anticipation of the barge strike. 
"It's not real consumption -- it's movement from one storage to another storage," said Mahmoud Wahba, chairman of Champion Energy Corp., a large heating-oil retailer in Greenwich, Conn. 
Mary T. Bergonia, a broker at E.D.&amp;F. 
Man International Futures Inc., New York, said heating oil was also driven lower as technical price-support levels were broken. 
"In general, the whole (energy-market) performance was disappointing" considering the positive API numbers, she said. 

   COTTON: Prices for March and May contracts rose the daily limit of two cents a pound, on what analysts termed technical considerations. 
The March contract settled at 63.7 cents a pound and May closed at 64.48 cents on the New York Cotton Exchange. 
The July contract also rose its two-cent limit. 
Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities, New York, said there were no fundamental developments. 
Instead, he said, contract buying was mostly by traders who had previously sold short. 
As prices rose, May -- the most actively traded contract -- broke above the key level of 63.2 cents a pound, accelerating the advance. 
Mr. Simon said buying was prompted by the fact that Tuesday will be the first day notices to deliver cotton against the March contract will be issued. 
"It's normal for traders to buy or sell with the approach of first-notice day. 
In this case it happened to be that the shorts were buyers," he said.

<HEAD>Investor Leads Buyout of Metropolitan Broadcasting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group led by New York communications investor
Robert F.X. Sillerman said Friday it had agreed to buy Metropolitan
Broadcasting Holding Co., which owns seven radio stations and the
Texas State Radio Network.
   Sillerman said his group will pay about $40 million to the
owners of the privately-held broadcasting concern and will assume
about $260 million in debt. ``Metropolitan Broadcasting is a
premier radio group,'' Sillerman said. ``We believe our financial
resources and strong broadcast operating expertise will provide
Metropolitan with a solid foundation for renewed growth.''
   The sale is subject to approval by the Federal Communications
Commission.
   Metropolitan Broadcasting was created in November 1986 when a
group that included the investment firm Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc.
and managers of Metromedia Co.'s radio division bought the division
for $285 million in a leveraged buyout.
   In a leveraged buyout, the buyers often borrow heavily against
the assets or cash flow of the company being acquired to make the
purchase.
   Metropolitan originally included nine radio stations and the
Texas radio network, but sold two stations in Washington and
Philadelphia last fall.
   Dennis McAlpine, a media industry analyst for the investment
firm Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said the stations were sold to help meet
the heavy interest costs associated with the debt incurred in the
buyout.
   Metropolitan currently owns WNEW-AM and WNEW-FM in New York,
WMMR-FM in Philadelphia, KTWV-FM in Los Angeles, WWBA-FM in the
Tampa-St. Petersburg area in Florida, WOMC-FM in Detroit, KRLD-AM
in Dallas, and the Texas State Radio Network, which provides
programming to radio stations in that state.
   Sillerman said his company would cancel Metropolitan's announced
plan to sell WNEW-AM and would review Metropolitan's proposed sale
of WWBA-FM.
   But he said the previously-announced sale of WOMC-FM in Detroit
would go forward, pending FCC approval.
   Metropolitan Broadcasting is being acquired by Sillerman
Acquisition Corp., which was formed for the purpose of buying the
radio properties.
   Sillerman is chairman and chief executive of that company, as
well as of Sillerman-Magee Communications Management Corp., a New
York-based communications investment concern.
   In addition, Sillerman and his associates are the largest
shareholders in Legacy Broadcasting, which owns and operates 10
radio stations in Los Angeles, Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul,
Detroit, Denver and Washington, D.C.
   Sillerman said the Metropolitan stations had been profitable and
were not for sale when he began conversations about the acquisition
only nine days ago.
   He said the stations should be able to generate more profit and
revenue through additional investment in more aggressive promotion.
He said his group's purchase should also end speculation about
whether more of the group's stations would be sold.
   He said Metropolitan's corporate and station management would
remain ``substantially intact.''
   Carl C. Brazell Jr., president of Metropolitan Broadcasting,
said, ``We look forward to building on strong expected results and
to an era of expansion and enhanced profitability for Metropolitan
Broadcasting.''

<HL> Heard on the Street:
Some Investors Are Starting to Sing the Praises
Of Radio Stations as They Outperform  Market

   Wall Street is beginning to like what it hears on radio. 

   After years of focusing on broadcasting's more glamorous television stocks, analysts and investors are now giving radio companies new recognition. 

   Once considered the poor relations of the business, radio companies as a group have outperformed the overall market in 1987, after lagging behind it in 1986. 
Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.'s index of seven radio and radio-related companies has jumped 41% since December 31, compared with a 26% rise in Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. 

   Among big gainers in radio have been Infinity Broadcasting, which was up 1/2 at 21 3/4 in national over-the-counter trading yesterday, compared with 11 3/4 at the end of last year; Clear Channel Communications, up 1/2 at 16 3/4 yesterday, compared with 12 1/2 on Dec. 31, and Olympic Broadcasting, which yesterday was at 8, compared with 4 1/2 on Dec. 31. 

   The sudden interest in radio stems in part from dwindling investment opportunities in television and a big increase in the number of publicly traded radio concerns. 

   About 10 television concerns have been acquired, gone private or recapitalized since Wall Street's interest in broadcasting companies surged three years ago. 
Those television concerns include American Broadcasting Cos., Storer Communications and Metromedia. 

   At the same time, at least five companies whose primary business is radio stations went public during the current bull market, bringing the number of publicly held radio companies to about 10, traded primarily over-the-counter. 
Initial public offerings in the last year included Infinity, Olympic and Osborne Communications. 

   "Wall Street really hasn't paid attention to radio," says Andrew W. Marcus, media analyst at Kidder, which initiated coverage of the industry last month. 
"Radio really didn't have the 'critical mass' for institutional investor interest until the offerings that occurred in 1986," including some secondary offerings of older radio concerns, Mr. Marcus says. 

   Many publicly held radio companies were formed recently and are heavily in debt because of aggressive acquisition strategies. 
Meanwhile, earnings are erratic because of high interest and amortization charges. 

   But Mr. Marcus, who considers cash flow a better gauge of broadcasters' financial health, is bullish on radio. 
He notes radio revenues come mainly from local advertising, which is more stable and has been growing faster than national advertising. 
He also believes radio's highly segmented audiences will help attract more advertisers trying to reach targeted demographic groups. 

   Large radio-only companies are a relatively recent phenomenon. 
In 1984, the Federal Communications Commission ruled a single company may own 12 AM radio stations, 12 FM stations and 12 television stations, up from seven of each. 
The FCC also dropped a requirement that a station owner hold on to a broadcasting property for at least three years before selling it. 

   The changes have sparked consolidation among the nation's about 8,900 commercial radio stations, with groups growing quickly by "trading up" smaller stations for larger ones. 
A record $3.2 billion of radio stations was sold last year, compared to $1.8 billion in 1985, estimates Paul Kagan Associates Inc., a Carmel, Calif., media research concern. 
Nearly 5% of stations are now part of groups of more than 14 stations, compared to none three years ago. 

   Part of radio's allure stems from the potential for quick turnarounds. 
In 1983, Malrite Communications bought an unprofitable New York station, WHTZ-FM, for $7.3 million. 
Malrite, which also has interests in independent television stations, changed the format, promoted the station heavily and improved the station's signal. 
Within three months, WHTZ became the market's top-rated station. 
Analysts now value WHTZ at more than $75 million. 

   But inherent volatility makes radio a risky play, analysts warn. 
Radio has more formats than television and is much more competitive. 
A typical city may have four commercial television stations but about 25 commercial radio stations -- of which half may be profitable. 

   "One 25-year-old kid programming the wrong 10 records, and you're out of business," says Gary Stevens, a station broker at Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co. in New York. 

   As a result, analysts stress quality of management in picking radio companies. 
David E. Schutz, managing director of ComCapital Group, a New York-based investment bank, says important management attributes include long radio careers, good track records in turning around stations -- particularly in similar markets -- and extensive overall earnings responsibility. 

   Mr. Marcus gives Infinity's management the highest marks in such areas and recommends the company as his "favorite way to participate in the growth of the radio station business." 
For longer-term investors, Mr. Marcus also likes Jacor Communications, which is making the transition from small to larger markets with recent acquisitions. 

   "These are small-capitalization, high-growth stocks," he says. 
"You have to make a judgment on management."

N.Y.'S SHANNON INVADES L.A. RADIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Westwood One's $54-million gamble in the hotly competitive Los Angeles radio 
market went on the air at 5:03 a.m. Friday. "Pirate Radio" KQLZ-FM (100.3), 
featuring a mix of classic hard rock, Top 40 and dance music, ended the 16-year 
reign of KIQQ-FM, which for the past three years had been calling itself K-LITE 
Radio. 
</P>
<P>
With KQLZ and the premium price it paid to buy the station from Outlet 
Communications, Westwood One has entered the Los Angeles ratings race in a 
bombastic way. Westwood One president Norman Pattiz hired New York's top 
morning deejay, Scott Shannon, to program and staff his new station. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon, who will act as morning drive-time deejay as well as KQLZ's programmer 
and a Westwood One vice president, denied reports that his contract with the 
company is worth $15 million initially, but did say that it could be worth that 
much if the station is successful. 
</P>
<P>
"Ladies and gentlemen, at this time K-LITE signs off the air forever," said an 
announcer who recommended that easy-listening music fans tune to four other Los 
Angeles FM stations: KTWV (94.7), KJOI (98.7), KSRF (103.1) and KOST (103.5) 
</P>
<P>
With that, K-LITE / KIQQ played its last soft hit: the 1958 chestnut "The End" 
sung by Earl Grant. 
</P>
<P>
"The staff and management of KIQQ were proud to serve you," the announcer said 
as KIQQ left the air. 
</P>
<P>
Following a two-minute sound mix featuring several of the legendary voices of 
Los Angeles pop radio (B. Mitchell Reed, the Real Don Steele, Dave Diamond), a 
dramatic voice proclaimed: 
</P>
<P>
"And now, ladies and gentlemen, the beat goes on . . . roll tape. You are about 
to witness the birth of a brand-new radio station. It's 5:03 a.m. KQLZ signs on 
the air for the very first time. Signing on the air, this is the all new 
KQLZ-FM Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Southern California, it's time to wake up. The mother ship has landed: Pirate 
Radio 100.3. Welcome to the jungle." 
</P>
<P>
Following the Guns N' Roses hit of that name, the new station's second 
selection was, appropriately, "Start Me Up" by the Rolling Stones. 
</P>
<P>
KQLZ is the second station bought by Culver City-based Westwood One, the 
nation's largest supplier of syndicated radio programming. The company also 
bought New York City's only country and Western station last year. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the "Pirate Radio" gimmick, the station is temporarily broadcasting 
from the back of a Westwood One warehouse, complete with "Pirate Radio" 
scrawled over the control console where Shannon and other KQLZ deejays do their 
announcing. In keeping with the "all-new" concept, no deejays currently on the 
air in the Los Angeles market have been hired to man the KQLZ mikes. 
</P>
<P>
Shannon will hold down the 6 to 10 a.m. slot, followed by former San Diego 
deejay Whitney Allen from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., with Shadow Steele, from New 
Orleans, taking over at 3 p.m. At 7 p.m., Atlanta deejay "Domino" takes the 
microphone, followed by former Oxnard deejay Jimmy Page at 11 p.m. The 
overnight shift from 2 to 6 a.m. features "Bubba the Love Monkey," described by 
Shannon as "an unemployed guy from Odessa, Texas." 
</P>
<P>
The station's general manager is Simon T, who comes to KQLZ from KCBQ-FM in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called "Morning Zoo" comedy repertory format that made his station in 
New York, Z-100, the most popular outlet on the East Coast, will not be 
duplicated at KQLZ, Shannon said. 
</P>
<P>
The new station was originally scheduled to go on the air in early April, but 
Pattiz and Shannon decided to surprise the competition with their new format 
Friday in order to put competing morning drive-time personalities off balance. 
Several already had taken pre-emptive measures, however. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles' top-rated rock station, KPWR-FM (105.9), recently adopted 
Shannon's "Morning Zoo" name for its morning drive-time crew, headed by 
deejay/actor Jay Thomas. Several other "Zoo" gimmicks and gags pioneered by 
Shannon in New York, such as "the juke box from hell" and a "worst-to-first" 
contest, have been implemented by rival stations, most notably the No. 2 
station in Los Angeles, KIIS-FM (102.7). 
</P>
<P>
"We're programming the two top-rated radio stations in Los Angeles and we're 
not even on the air yet," said Shannon, referring to the "Morning Zoo" gimmicks 
that he pioneered and that are now being used on KIIS and KPWR. 
</P>
<P>
KPWR's Thomas told The Times that he welcomes Shannon's competition, while KIIS 
deejay Rick Dees, the longtime morning ratings champ, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"There's enough (audience) out there for everybody," said KLSX-FM (97.1) 
morning man Peter Tilden. 
</P>
<P>
KIQQ became the third station in as many weeks to change its call letters. Last 
week, KMPC-FM (101.9) became KEDG "The Edge," though it kept its same on-air 
personalities and album rock format. Two weeks ago, KNX-FM (93.1) dropped its 
call letters, most of its deejays and its progressive rock format in favor of 
an oldies rock format. The new station is known as KODJ-FM. 
</P>
<P>
KQLZ's "Pirate Radio" concept is taken from the renegade broadcast tradition 
dating back more than 20 years, when ships in the North Sea transmitted rock 
'n' roll into the British Isles from international waters where the British 
government had no jurisdiction over what could be broadcast. More recently, a 
pair of pirate stations popped up off Long Island in New York until the Federal 
Communications Commission tracked them down and forced them off the air. 
</P>
<P>
Westwood One's Pattiz is not so ingenuous as to try to pass off his new 
$54-million station as shoestring radio, but he does maintain that KQLZ has the 
unsafe overtones of an experimental operation. 
</P>
<P>
Pattiz said Westwood One will be using its satellite, SatCom 1R, to send the 
KQLZ signal out nationally to affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing is really going to evolve," he said. "Everybody expects us to go 
Top 40, but that's not what we're going to be. It'll have a harder edge to it. 
It hasn't been done significantly anywhere else. This will not just be 
attracting listeners from KIIS and Power (KPWR), but KLSX, KLOS and everybody 
else on the dial too." 
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes before he signed off, K-LITE overnight deejay Gary Butterworth 
wished his audience an enjoyable Friday and played the last K-LITE promotional 
insert: 
</P>
<P>
"K-LITE: The station everybody at work can agree on."

<TEXT>
   Women in poodle skirts and saddle shoes
and men in T-shirts with rolled-up sleeves danced to Buddy Holly
classics in memory of the rock 'n' roll legend killed 30 years ago
when his plane crashed in this small Iowa town.
   About 2,000 fans gathered at the Surf Ballroom on Friday, braving
snow, high winds and subzero temperatures similar to the conditions
blamed in the Feb. 3, 1959, crash that also claimed the lives of
Ritchie Valens and J.P. ``Big Bopper'' Richardson. The three had
just played the Surf and were en route to Fargo, N.D., in the early
morning hours when the small plane went down.
   ``This old-time music is the only thing that works anymore,''
said Larry Fennigaoh of Milwaukee, decked out in a tuxedo, white
socks and black sneakers.
   Fennigaoh and his wife, Beth, were among those attending a sock
hop at the 11th annual Buddy Holly reunion.
   ``I liked Buddy Holly even better than Elvis (Presley). Elvis had
more persona and was more macho. But Holly had purity, clarity,''
Fennigaoh said.
   Party-goers filed past the Feb. 3, 1959, edition of the Mason
City Globe-Gazette displayed in the ballroom lobby as 1950s and '60s
music blared in the background.
   The newspaper featured six grisly black-and-white pictures of the
wrecked airplane and one-column photos of Holly and Valens.
   Immortalized as ``the day the music died'' in Don McLean's 1972
pop song ``American Pie,'' the plane crash was the first great rock
tragedy.
   Holly, with such hits as ``Peggy Sue,'' ``Rave On,'' ``Not Fade
Away'' and ``It's So Easy,'' was only 22 when he died.
   Valens, 17, already was known for such songs as ``Donna'' and
``La Bamba.'' Richardson, a former disc jockey, had made it big with
the song, ``Chantilly Lace.''
   For more than a decade the faithful have flocked to the ballroom
to honor the man who changed the face of rock 'n' roll with his
inventive lyrics, irresistable melodies and inimitable Texas twang.
   ``My mom grew up with this music and she always played it around
the house. I never got into that loud, banging kind of music,'' said
Tamera ``Tammy'' Kriegel of Grinnell, who wasn't even born in 1959 _
she's 28 _ but has been coming to the Buddy Holly reunion for the
past five years.
   The walls of the 50-year-old ballroom are lined with portraits
and posters of Holly. A 6-foot tombstone etched with the names of
the dead and the words ``Their music lives on'' stands just inside
the entrance.
   Darryl ``Mad Hatter'' Hensley, who organized the annual
observance 11 years ago when he was a disc jockey with KEZV radio,
said more than 2,000 tickets were sold at $45 each for this year's
bash.
   ``I love this stuff,'' said Jan Crowther of Marshalltown, who was
8 years old when Holly died. ``I've been into it since I was
knee-high to nothin'.''
   David Harvey, 32, who has come to the reunion for six years from
his home in London, arrived early Friday afternoon.
   ``I enjoy visiting you colonials, but I'm here to remember Buddy
Holly,'' said Harvey, a railroad conductor. ``Did you know that in
London, Buddy Holly is second in popularity to Elvis Presley?''
   Harvey is one of 14 people from England who attended Friday as
temperatures hovered near 19 below zero and wind chills hit minus 50
degrees.
   Another Briton, Ray Needham, 46, of Upminster, sold memorial
T-shirts for $8 each in a hotel lobby.
   ``I remember the first time I heard him was when `That'll Be The
Day' came on the jukebox. ... The feeling I got from his music was
that his songs were just being sung to me personally,'' said
Needham, co-founder of the British Buddy Holly Society, which he
said claims just under 300 members.

<HEAD>RKO General Sells KRTH AM and FM in Los Angeles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent of RKO General announced Thursday
it would sell Los Angeles radio stations KRTH-AM and FM, the latest
step in the FCC-ordered dismantling of the RKO network.
   Beasley Broadcast Group of Goldsboro, N.C., will pay $86.6
million for the stations, which play rock oldies.
   In keeping with a settlement between the Federal Communications
Commission and RKO's parent, GenCorp of Fairlawn, Ohio, the seller
gets to keep just $56.2 million, or 65 percent of the purchase price.
   The balance, $30.4 million, will be divided among six companies
that challenged RKO's and GenCorp's fitness to hold the KRTH
broadcast licenses.
   In the settlement, which ended a 23-year wrangle before the FCC,
GenCorp didn't admit wrongdoing, but agreed to sell 12 radio
stations and one television station, splitting the proceeds from
each sale with those who challenged that particular license.
   The dispute began in 1965, when a challenger disputed RKO's right
to operate KHJ-TV in Los Angeles, citing billing irregularities and
questioning the corporate character of GenCorp, the former General
Tire &amp; Rubber Co.
   In a 1980 ruling that stripped RKO of one television license, the
FCC noted that GenCorp, the former General Tire &amp; Rubber Co., had
been accused of improper domestic political contributions and of
bribery overseas.
   GenCorp, which makes aerospace and automotive products and
plastics, has approval for the KRTH deal from Beasley Broadcast and
the various challengers, but the transaction must be OK'd by the FCC.
   Beasley has radio stations in Philadelphia, Chicago, Miami and
elsewhere.
   When the sale was announced late Thursday, Beasley officials
weren't available to say if they planned to change the station's
management or format.
   GenCorp sold KHJ-TV to The Walt Disney Co. in December, with
license challenger Fidelity Television Inc. getting 32 percent of
the $320 million purchase price.
   Similar sale agreements have been approved for RKO's WHBQ-AM in
Memphis, Tenn.; WGMS-AM in Bethesda, Md.; WGMS-FM in Washington,
D.C., and WRKO-AM and WROR-FM in Boston. The company is seeking
buyers for WOR-AM and WRKS-FM in New York City; KFRC-AM in San
Francisco; WAXY-FM in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; WFYR-FM in Chicago and
WHBQ-TV in Memphis.

KJOI TO DROP EASY-LISTENING FORMAT SUNDAY; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO: THE STATION WILL REPLACE INSTRUMENTALS WITH SOFT VOCALS AND LIGHT JAZZ 
IN AN EFFORT TO ATTRACT YOUNGER LISTENERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In an unusual move for a successful radio station, KJOI-FM (98.7) said Tuesday 
it will abandon the "easy listening" instrumental format it has employed for 
the last 25 years in favor of soft vocals and light jazz. 
</P>
<P>
The switch, effective Sunday, comes as a surprise because KJOI ranks fifth 
among Southern California's most-listened-to radio stations in the latest 
Arbitron ratings and, according to Bob Griffith, KJOI vice president and 
general manager, enjoys a 23% increase in advertising revenue this year over 
the same period in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The change from the station's traditional "elevator music" format was prompted 
by KJOI's lack of audience growth and a desire among station officials to reach 
slightly younger listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"We were not unhappy with our ratings," Griffith said. "We found that most of 
the research indicated that the radio station was not growing. . . . And our 
competition, for the most part, is growing by leaps and bounds. If everyone 
else is growing and you're not, you're perceived to be losing." 
</P>
<P>
After eight months of surveys, station officials said, they determined that the 
desired target audience (between ages 35 and 54) would best be reached through 
an updated format. Currently, the average listener is over 45, Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
Attracting younger listeners is mandatory if KJOI is "to compete in the '90s," 
said operations manager Allan Hotlen. 
</P>
<P>
"The term 'elevator music' is perceived as a negative," Griffith said. "And 
KJOI is synonymous with elevator music. That's why we felt we have to 
re-package." 
</P>
<P>
The mix will be 75% soft vocals -- by artists such as Anita Baker, Don Henley, 
Carly Simon, Al Jarreau and Neil Diamond -- and 25% instrumental light jazz, by 
such musicians as David Sanborn, David Benoit and Kenny G. KJOI executives said 
85% of the music will be compositions recorded in the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
"We still would like to be the softest radio station on the dial . . . but what 
we'd like to do is update the programming," Griffith said. "We think of it as 
an opportunity to keep our current listeners and also attract new listeners." 
</P>
<P>
The station will keep its call letters, though downplaying them in favor of the 
identifying slogan, "Touch 98.7." 
</P>
<P>
Terms such as passion, affection, bonding and emotion were bandied about by 
KJOI officials at a news conference announcing the change Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We think 'Touch' reflects the emotionalism and realness that maybe people 
don't find available on radio of today," Hotlen said. "We think our success 
will be a function largely of how people bond with the radio station." 
</P>
<P>
Television advertisements will feature soft, sultry songs and couples nuzzling 
or children smiling and the slogan, "Music you can really feel." 
</P>
<P>
The station will not feature flashy on-air personalities, nor will it offer 
big-money giveaways, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Capparela, the mellifluous-voiced former KFAC-FM announcer who was briefly 
at KUSC-FM after KFAC changed formats Sept. 21, will move over to KJOI next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
With rock stations jockeying for position to corner the coveted teen audience, 
an opportunity to reach more middle-aged people has opened up, Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
"What has happened to L.A. is that as a lot of radio stations become more 
rock-based, they're deserting an area that is very advantageous: adults about 
40," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
The station is expected to compete with KOST-FM (103.5), currently the No. 1 
station in the market, and KBIG-FM (104.3), which ranked No. 8 in the latest 
Arbitron survey. 
</P>
<P>
Both KOST and KBIG also made the switch from easy listening during the '80s.

   Roger J. Williams, recognized as one of the
world's foremost authorities on nutrition, died Saturday at age 94.
   Williams was a professor emeritus at the University of Texas.
His work in nutrition at the UT Clayton Foundation Biochemical
Institute, which he founded, led to the discovery of more vitamins
and their variants than at any other research facility in the world.
   One of Williams' most significant accomplishments was the
discovery and isolation of pantothenic acid, one of the ``universal
vitamins'' required by all living cells and essential to life.
Later he discovered and named folic acid, a substance used by every
cell in the body.
   Williams wrote a book on ``biochemical individuality,'' a
concept that no two people are exactly alike physiologically and
therefore everyone has different nutritional requirements. He
retired in 1985.

   John Allegro, renowned for his work in deciphering
the Dead Sea Scrolls but ridiculed for his theories that Western
religions were based on the worship of mushrooms, died Feb. 17. He
was 65.
   Allegro was a brilliant student of Semitic languages at
Manchester University and went on to study Hebrew dialects at
Oxford University.
   In 1953, Allegro was named to an international team formed to
decipher the Dead Sea Scrolls, which were discovered in caves at
Qumran.
   The scrolls included the oldest known manuscripts of books from
the Old Testament. Allegro's gift for deciphering minute texts was
crucial. His book, ``The Dead Sea Scrolls,'' was published in 1956
and became a bestseller.
   In his 1970 book ``The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross,'' he
contended that Judaism and Christianity were in fact products of an
ancient sex-and-mushroom cult. Allegro also published a 1966 book,
``Search in the Desert,'' about an unsuccessful search for lost
scrolls in the Judean Desert.

KCBQ RADIO TO REUNITE VOICES FROM THE PAST

<P>
For a group of well-traveled disc jockeys, working in a business that is 
transient by nature, mention of radio station KCBQ evokes memories of a golden 
era, a time when they were No. 1 with a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most special place I ever worked, by light-years," said Rich Werges, 
a.k.a. Rich Brother Robbin. "Asking a guy in his middle 40s about KCBQ is like 
asking about the '60s. I get all choked up." 
</P>
<P>
KCBQ achieved greatness -- industrywide recognition -- not once but twice. In 
the mid- to late 1950s, it was one of the country's first big rock 'n' roll 
stations, a pioneer of the music that swept the country. In the late '60s and 
early '70s, it was one of the last great AM music stations, a last hurrah for 
AM before FM music stations began to dominate the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, KCBQ-AM (1170) and KCBQ-FM (105.3) will bringtogether three 
decades of the station's personalities for an on-air reunion from 6 a.m. to 8 
p.m. They will broadcast from the Marriott Mission Valley, where marketing and 
promotional paraphernalia representing 35 years of the station's history will 
be on display. The public is invited, and a free "sock hop" will top off the 
day from 8 p.m. to midnight at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1955, the Bartell radio chain purchased KCBQ-AM and switched it 
from traditional block programming -- an hour of country music, an hour of 
classic music, etc. -- to the music of hot youngsters such as Elvis Presley, 
</P>
<P>
and other pioneer rockers. It was one of the first rock stations in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
Powered by the incessantly upbeat announcing of Ralph James, Don Howard, Jim 
O'Leary, Earl McRoberts, Jack Vincent and Harry (Happy Hare) Martin, the 
station soon became the most popular in the city, earning as much as 40% of the 
audience during some time periods, according to several surveys. 
</P>
<P>
Through much of the era, the disc jockeys worked in a glass booth in the El 
Cortez Hotel, where listeners could drive by and see them at work. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that it was as near to being at one with myself as I've ever 
been," said Martin, now an account executive with KSON and doing voice-over 
work. "Imagine going into a station knowing that everybody loved you and you 
were going in with a spoon to stir up that love." 
</P>
<P>
Station owner Lee Bartell gave the disc jockeys unprecedented freedom on the 
air, and they were known to take advantage of it. Among other stunts, Martin 
recalls running for mayor and staging Indian rain dances on the air. 
</P>
<P>
"I was being paid to be crazy, which saved me a great deal of trouble having to 
go in for therapy," said Martin, who left the station in 1962 for a lucrative 
offer in Cleveland, although he returned to KCBQ in 1969 to anchor the morning 
lineup for three years. 
</P>
<P>
James, who worked at KCBQ from 1955 to 1961, remembers that Bartell never told 
him not to do anything on the air. Despite the rowdiness, the emphasis was 
always on the positive and being upbeat and helpful to the community. 
</P>
<P>
The station called itself "family radio." 
</P>
<P>
"People often ask me what there was with KCBQ," said James, who went on to a 
successful career as one of Hollywood's most recognized voices. "To me, it was 
a very community-oriented station. We were ahead of our time. . . . The success 
wasn't so much the music but the guys who worked there and how they integrated 
themselves with the community." 
</P>
<P>
Although "The Q" was consistently a success, it didn't again approach the 
remarkable popularity of those first years until the late '60s and early '70s. 
Locked in a battle with the "Boss Radio" of KGB, KCBQ again concentrated on Top 
40 hits and the power of its on-air personalities to post double-digit ratings 
and again dominate the market. 
</P>
<P>
Again, the emphasis was on being friendly and upbeat, creating a family 
atmosphere among staff and listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"We frequently screamed but we always smiled," said Werges, who worked at the 
station in 1971 and '72, and again in '73 and '74, serving as program director. 
"It was always something that warmed the inside, was always 'up.' " 
</P>
<P>
Former KGB program director Buzz Bennett, a firm believer in positive thinking, 
directed the station through most of the successful years in the early '70s. As 
program director, he gave the staff books on self-motivation and regularly 
preached to them about believing in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Things were loose and open, both on and off the air. One disc jockey even 
remembers the "I Ching" being consulted on a decision. 
</P>
<P>
Magic Christian, Rich Brother Robbin, Bobby Ocean, "Shotgun Tom" Kelly and the 
other KCBQ personalities became household names, as the station regularly 
posted audience shares of 20 and 30 rating points. In contrast, the top-rated 
station in San Diego for the past few years, KKLQ (Q106), usually earns a 9 or 
10. 
</P>
<P>
"We played the hits and only the hits," recalled Werges, now general manager of 
KQYT-FM, an easy-listening station in Tucson, Ariz. "It was like pulling teeth 
to get a record on the station." 
</P>
<P>
It was a heady experience for the disc jockeys, who could gauge the station's 
success every time they went out in public. Chuck (Magic) Christian recalls 
taking the station's dune buggy to the beach for a summer promotion and seeing 
waves of people flock to the water when the station announced his location on 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unbelievable feeling that that many people listened to that much 
radio," said Christian, now doing morning shows for KLCY-FM in Salt Lake City. 
"I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
For the disc jockeys, it was a 24-hour job; their identities both on and off 
the air were linked to the station. 
</P>
<P>
"You might play golf, or you might ride a bicycle for fun, but you worked for 
KCBQ," Werges said. "It was a privilege. . . . I was Rich Brother Robbin. It 
was everything." 
</P>
<P>
Werges left the station in 1974 because, he said, he was an alcoholic and 
"couldn't cope anymore." But, in some ways, he misses the glory days of KCBQ. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing can compare to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the disc jockeys who worked at the station held a variety of jobs 
before and after their stints with KCBQ. It goes with the territory in the 
radio business, where careers are affected by ratings and the whims of 
management. 
</P>
<P>
"To this day, there are a lot of negative aspects in this business," Christian 
said. "But at least we were united in that one effort." 
</P>
<P>
By the late '70s, FM music stations began to dominate radio markets, and it 
took several years for KCBQ to adjust and establish its FM side. Though 
consistently successful, it has never achieved the success of the 
ground-breaking years of the '50s or the period in the late '60s and early 
'70s. 
</P>
<P>
The station has gone through several owners through the years, and for a period 
in the early '80s, it even switched to a country music format. It reverted to 
oldies rock in 1986. Currently both the AM and FM side feature oldies rock (the 
AM uses the syndicated KOOL format), playing many of the same songs it did in 
the station's heyday. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the station was purchased by Adams Communications, which decided 
to emphasize the station's history, dropping the "Eagle 105" moniker in favor 
of concentrating on the KCBQ call letters in all marketing campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
"They feel KCBQ are legendary call letters that people are familiar with 
locally and nationally," said station spokeswoman Leslie O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to James, Martin, Werges and Christian, the reunion is scheduled to 
bring back to the KCBQ airwaves such familiar names as Charlie Tuna, Jerry 
(Shadoe) Jackson, Dean Goss, "Shotgun Tom" Kelly, Jack Vincent, Charlie and 
Harrigan, Jerry G. Bishop and others. 
</P>
<P>
For the disc jockeys, it will be a chance to revive old acquaintances and, for 
some, to relive the good old days. 
</P>
<P>
"Harry Martin owes me a dollar and I'd like to collect at 10% interest each 
year," James said with a laugh. "I'd also like to see if Don Howard still looks 
as funny as he used to."

   One of the most popular songs on college
radio stations these days is a partly fond, partly unsentimental
look back at youth from a man who's feeling his age.
   The ironic success of ``We Don't Do That Anymore'' hasn't
slipped by David Slutes, co-author of the song and singer in the
Arizona-based rock band Sidewinders. Slutes is 27 years old.
   ``If anything, they shouldn't relate to that at all,'' he said.
``All the classic rock stations should be playing it for the older
people.''
   ``We Don't Do That Anymore'' is a hard rocking take on aging, a
subject rock 'n' roll hasn't treated with particular grace in the
past, both in song and in real life.
   It's a tale of a group of college friends who stay up all night
and drink wine, with ``nothing but dreams and things on our mind.''
Advance a few years later to preoccupations with jobs and rent, and
it's clear from the song's title those days are past for Slutes and
his friends.
   ``You look back and say, `My God, I miss those times,' '' he
said. ``But you also look back and say, `Thank God I'm not doing
those same things.' ''
   The tempered idealism of the song is an apt metaphor for the
Sidewinders' own career. Slutes, Richard Hopkins, Mark Perrodin and
Bruce Halper realized a dream when RCA signed them to a major-label
contract. But they're finding there's a lot of hard work - and no
guarantees - involved in becoming a rock 'n' roll success story.
   That work recently involved networking at the New Music Seminar
in New York City and their fourth appearance at a converted
hamburger stand turned rock club in Albany, thousands of miles from
home.
   Veterans of the punk rock scene in Tucson, Ariz., the
Sidewinders are trying to make it as a hard-edged, traditional rock
band - disdaining the heavy metal scene and the studied weirdness
of many college radio favorites. Musician magazine described them
as an ``unholy cross between R.E.M. and Husker Du.''
   Sidewinders aren't doing their own growing up in the obscurity
that characterizes many similar bands.
   The band put out its first album by itself and expected several
other years of recording on independent labels before anyone in the
``big leagues'' noticed them, Slutes said. Instead, RCA signed them
after seeing the band at a showcase in Austin, Texas.
   ``Auntie Ramos' Pool Hall,'' named after an place near where the
band rehearses back home, is the Sidewinders' second RCA album.
   ``We're growing as songwriters and players with every album,''
Slutes said. ``Lyrically, for me, I'm writing a lot better. I'm
learning how to explain things better to music and Mark is writing
better music.''
   The brutally brief ``Sara's Not Sober'' is about impatience
directed toward a drunken friend. Slutes, charitably, describes
``Sara'' as a composite of several people he knows.
   With ``We Don't Do That Anymore,'' Slutes said he had to walk
the fine line between making the song maudlin or a joke.
   ``It comes about as close to any song we've done to life,'' he
said. ``As you get older, your priorities change. It's something I
live with everyday.''
   The band produced ``Auntie Ramos' Pool Hall'' themselves,
although RCA recently pressured them to hire a manager and make the
next record with an outside producer, Slutes said.
   ``The company said, `Look, you guys, you have to grow up. You're
not an indie (independent) band anymore,' '' he said.
   But Slutes appears to have picked up on the type of work bands
have to do offstage to get ahead. He quickly recites the call
letters of local radio stations that have been playing ``We Don't
Do That Anymore.'' He was following a recent interview with dinner
hosted by an Albany college radio station.
   ``You look at radio and it seems it's gone from being
song-oriented to being sound-oriented, having a certain production
quality,'' he said. ``You don't seem to hear real songs anymore and
we're a real song-oriented band.
   ``That sounds kind of preachy, but there are a lot of great
bands out there that have good songs that you don't hear on the
radio because they don't have the right sound. We haven't had a
producer yet (so) we haven't gotten our radio ear yet, or whatever
you need.''
   While Hopkins jokes about Sidewinders' plans for ``world
domination,'' the band seems content with gradual career
advancement.
   ``We're really happy, especially at the college level, with how
we've been received,'' Slutes said. ``We seem to have gotten a
decent fan base now that so when we go to a town we have a certain
number of people waiting to see us.''

AIRWAVES: ONE POLL SHOWS A LOS ANGELES RADIO STATION ASNO. 1 IN THE 
LANCASTER-PALMDALE MARKET. NEW RESIDENTS WITH MORE URBAN TASTES ARE CREDITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Larry Thornhill, manager of two rock radio stations in Lancaster, got an 
unpleasant surprise last February when he tried to find out what residents were 
listening to. 
</P>
<P>
Arbitron, the major radio ratings service, lumps the Antelope Valley in with 
the vast Los Angeles market. So Thornhill hired a research firm to survey the 
Lancaster-Palmdale region. In previous polls, he said, the top spot was always 
held by one of the Antelope Valley's eight stations, but the results last 
February were startling. 
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, a Los Angeles radio station came in No. 1," Thornhill 
said. "It was KLOS." 
</P>
<P>
For years, the Antelope Valley's low-powered radio stations (1,000 to 5,000 
watts compared with KLOS' 68,000 or KPWR's 72,000 watts) have had a lock on the 
isolated high desert market north of Los Angeles. The San Gabriel Mountains 
block the signals from many L.A. stations, and those powerhouse operations that 
do reach the area have high advertising rates that would break the budgets of 
small Antelope Valley merchants. 
</P>
<P>
But the market is changing. In recent years, affordable housing has lured 
thousands of new residents to Palmdale and Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles radio is now recognizing the potential out here," said Thornhill, 
who manages sister stations KAVL-AM and KAVS-FM. "You're seeing more billboards 
out here. You're seeing more of a concentrated effort to get bumper stickers 
out here. KIIS-FM, for example, now has bumper stickers in all the Taco Bells 
out here. Los Angeles radio's recognizing the big audience out here." 
</P>
<P>
Some Antelope Valley broadcasters are concerned because the Los Angeles 
stations can afford big promotional pushes, including splashy television ads. 
In addition, many of the people moving to Palmdale and Lancaster have brought 
their Los Angeles listening habits with them -- and refuse to even sample local 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
"That's our biggest problem by far," Thornhill said. "When we look at next 
year, we have to build into our budget billboard expenses. That's going to be 
our biggest frontal attack next year -- to try to re-educate new residents." 
</P>
<P>
In the February survey, Thornhill's KAVS, which has a contemporary-hits format, 
placed second to Los Angeles rocker KLOS. To fight back, Thornhill added on-air 
personalities during prime broadcast hours. Previously, KAVS had been automated 
all day. The new hires included a two-man morning team that offers the type of 
banter popularized by KLOS' Mark and Brian. 
</P>
<P>
Other local broadcasters try to compete with Los Angeles by offering Antelope 
Valley news, weather and sports reports. They also do remote broadcasts from 
local shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
They boast that their advertising rates are a bargain. A drive-time spot on an 
Antelope Valley station may cost about $20. The same ad on a highly rated Los 
Angeles radio show sometimes sells for more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Several Los Angeles radio executives denied that the Antelope Valley has been 
singled out for heavy promotion. They said local billboard and bumper-sticker 
giveaways are part of a regionwide campaign to attract listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"We try to get to every area that we cover in Southern California," said Duncan 
Payton, promotions director for Burbank-based KPWR. "We realize our listeners 
are all over the Southland." 
</P>
<P>
Added Steven Smith, director of advertising and promotion at KLOS: "We haven't 
taken a more aggressive approach" in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
But Smith said his station was involved this year in auto racing events in 
Palmdale and Rosemond. Earlier, it did a remote broadcast from a Wrightwood ski 
resort, on the edge of the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"We've thought about going to the Antelope Valley Fair because we're involved 
in the Los Angeles and Orange County fairs. But with the timing and the 
distance from Los Angeles, we just haven't gotten around to it," Smith said. 
"We think we would do very well out there. There seem to be a lot of fans in 
that area." 
</P>
<P>
The Antelope Valley's value as a radio market became evident a few months ago 
when Encino-based entertainment firm Eric/Chandler Ltd. announced that it was 
buying Lancaster sister stations KKZZ-FM and KHJJ-AM for $3.6 million. 
Eric/Chandler owns Avalon Attractions and is already a Los Angeles concert 
promotion heavyweight. It also has business ties to a popular Orange County 
concert venue, Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Miserendino, president of Eric/Chandler, said his firm has been awaiting 
final Federal Communications Commission approval of the sale. Meanwhile, it is 
researching Antelope Valley audiences to determine whether format changes are 
needed. KKZZ now plays light adult contemporary music, while KHJJ spins hits 
from the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"The Antelope Valley is growing by leaps and bounds," Miserendino said. "The 
market is growing at a great pace, and radio is a part of everyone's life. And 
advertisers need a place to advertise. While the signals from the Los Angeles 
station do come in, most of the retailers can't afford to pay those rates." 
</P>
<P>
The Lancaster stations' new affiliation with Eric/Chandler has already enabled 
them to launch a major giveaway. Because Avalon presented the recent sold-out 
Rolling Stones concerts in Los Angeles, KHJJ was able to get about 120 tickets 
to distribute to its listeners. 
</P>
<P>
"These guys are experts at promotions," said J.R. Engel, co-manager of KKZZ and 
KHJJ. 
</P>
<P>
Engel said the new owners are expected to beef up equipment and personnel to 
make the stations more competitive. Engel has already hired a news director to 
begin covering the area. 
</P>
<P>
Some Antelope Valley broadcasters are worried that format changes at KKZZ or 
KHJJ could alter the way the local audience is now divided. 
</P>
<P>
"It scares us to death," said KAVS' Thornhill. "We don't have any competition 
other than Los Angeles now. Any new contemporary-hits station that comes in 
here is going to give us a tough time." 
</P>
<P>
But Dale P. Ware, general manager of KOTY-AM in Palmdale, is less concerned 
about the Eric/Chandler purchase. "I'm pleased in a lot of ways because it 
makes all of us pull our socks up," he said. "On the positive side, they will 
come in, and the ad rates will go up to where they should be." 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley broadcasters say the rates are low partly because their 
stations operate in the shadow of the Los Angeles giants. And because the 
region is not surveyed independently by Arbitron, it is difficult to document 
listening habits and attract national advertisers. Finally, they say, in the 
scramble for local ad dollars, many sales people further discount their rates. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to take somebody from out of town coming in here to say, 'Hey, wait 
a minute. This is dumb. This is stupid,' " Ware said. "They'll set higher rates 
because they know they can get those kind of rates." 
</P>
<P>
Other Antelope Valley broadcasters say Ware faces a particularly tough 
challenge because he operates an AM country station with no FM affiliate at a 
time when most young music lovers keep their radios tuned to FM. 
</P>
<P>
Ware said he has been trying to broaden the station's appeal by positioning it 
as a key source of information. It presents local news reports and recently 
launched a two-hour morning talk show. Guests have included local leaders and 
country music stars. The station also operates an interactive phone service 
that allows listeners to call in for recorded updates of sports, weather or 
winning lottery numbers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Ware boasts that, unlike many of the local stations, his signal 
reaches as far as Santa Clarita -- a key advantage in reaching up to 30,000 
Antelope Valley residents who commute daily to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
KUTY is criticized by some rivals for its failure to use local disc jockeys. 
Its country music comes from a national satellite service based in Illinois. 
Antelope Valley listeners must dial a toll-free number to talk to the disc 
jockey. 
</P>
<P>
Ware said he prefers not to hire the inexperienced young disc jockeys who 
traditionally hone their skills in small markets such as the Antelope Valley. 
"We feel our listeners deserve more than that," he said. "The other reason is 
because when you're in a small market, you've only got so many dollars to put 
into your personnel. We opted to put our money into news." 
</P>
<P>
At least one Antelope Valley broadcaster remains undisturbed by the Los Angeles 
rock giants' promotional push and the sale of KKZZ and KHJJ. Barbara Halley, 
manager of sister stations KTPI-FM and KVOY-AM, believes that she has the local 
country music audience securely in hand. Although Los Angeles has country 
stations, their signals don't reach the Antelope Valley clearly, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're listening to FM country in the Antelope Valley, you're listening to 
us because we're the only one," Halley said. "I can see where a rock station 
would be threatened." 
</P>
<P>
KTPI and KVOY don't offer local news coverage, but, unlike KUTY, they use local 
disc jockeys. 
</P>
<P>
Halley said her stations get new residents to tune in with a busy remote 
broadcast schedule. The stations broadcast and gave away prizes last summer at 
about 50 locations, ranging from a recreational vehicle show to a new housing 
tract to a meat market. For $1,400, an advertiser gets the remote broadcast, 
assorted prizes given away to listeners and 50 radio commercials. 
</P>
<P>
Although Halley believes country is the key market in Antelope Valley, rock 
station manager Thornhill argues that the region's new residents are bringing 
their urban musical tastes with them. "We have nothing to prove that country 
music is No. 1 out here anymore," he said. "Times have changed. We're not a 
country, rural area anymore." 
</P>
<P>
All the local broadcasters believe the Antelope Valley's radio market is 
changing. Advertisers and listeners have become more sophisticated, and local 
stations are looking for new ways to keep the L.A. giants at bay. 
</P>
<P>
Thornhill said rising ad rates may cause local stations to lose their small 
mom-and-pop store accounts in favor of more lucrative chain-store contracts. 
Broadcasts of Antelope Valley high school and college football games may be 
dropped because they don't attract enough listeners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The challenge is to connect with a large segment of the local audience, while 
working with limited resources. Thornhill boasted that his stations recently 
coaxed their listeners into donating $54,000 for San Francisco earthquake 
relief in less than 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't fight with Los Angeles," he said. "You can't fight with Rick Dees. 
You've just got to do the best that you can."

   A Scottish disc jockey has found a wide audience
playing her own brand of down-home music on public radio in, of all
places, North Carolina. But why not? Most of this area's original
settlers were Scotch-Irish immigrants who brought their fiddles and
tin whistles to harken back to the music of their homeland.

   ``I obviously sound like where this music
comes from,'' she says in her lilting, rich Scottish brogue.
   And listening to Fiona Ritchie from her forum, ``Thistle &amp;
Shamrock'' on public radio, it sounds like she is surrounded by
musicians from Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Brittany.
   She's a Scottish disc jockey with a weekly hour-long show
originating in North Carolina.
   Unlikely? Why not?
   Some of this area's original settlers were Scotch-Irish
immigrants who sought to imitate the music of their homeland with
fiddles and tin whistles.
   Fiona's radio show has attracted a wide and faithful audience
from Maine to California.
   Even she had to chuckle when she found her name in The Boston
Globe's crossword puzzle.
   The clue was, ``Public radio's Ritchie.''
   Ritchie, a youthful 29-year-old with thick auburn hair, says she
has had no formal training in music or radio. Yet over the last six
years, she has evolved into one of American Public Radio's biggest
draws.
   It is now picked up by 165 public radio stations across the
country.
   ``It's still popular and growing,'' she said in an interview at
her studio at WFAE-FM, just before leaving for a working vacation
at her parent's home in Greenock, Scotland. ``If it weren't, I
might graciously bow out.''
   That's the last thing her fans, many of whom write her letters
and subscribe to her newsletter, want Ritchie to do.
   ```Thistle &amp; Shamrock' is the reason God invented ears,'' wrote
one fan from Laramie, Wyo.
   ``I work as a ranger deep in the woods of northern Maine for
half the year, and every Saturday night at 8 p.m. finds me glued to
the radio for `The Thistle &amp; Shamrock,''' wrote another fan. ``Your
show has opened a whole new world of music and musical instruments
to me.''
   Ritchie launched the Celtic music show in 1981 as a local radio
show in Charlotte, where she had spent a year in college as an
exchange student from Stirling University in Scotland. Two years
later, APR syndicated it nationally.
   The name of the show came out of her imagination.
   ``It's my own concoction,'' says Ritchie, her face breaking into
a big smile. ``I wanted a name that would evoke a place where this
music would be performed _ a pub-like setting.''
   There's a style she brings to her weekly show that's all Fiona
Ritchie.
   One week the theme could be songs of the sea. The next, songs
about the working class. Later, music from a particular region of
Ireland or England could be featured. Ritchie gives her listeners a
brief preview before each set.
   ``The appeal of the show lies directly with Fiona,'' says APR
spokeswoman Deborah Wolfer in a telephone interview from St. Paul,
Minn. ``Her personality is engaging and her fans sense her
enthusiasm for the subject. People listen for her, not just the
music.''
   To Ritchie, the real attraction is the music, some of it
hundreds of years old. While she started off as an amateur, her
small office is now crammed with tapes, Celtic records and music
reference books.
   ``I'm always looking for new music,'' she says. ``I'll be
bringing some recordings and CDs back with me from Scotland. But I
even find some of it here in Charlotte.''
   Ritchie's playlist ranges from the traditional Scottish ballads
of Jean Redpath, including ``The Songs of Robert Burns,'' to the
Irish traditional music of De Danann and, of course, The Chieftains
(``In Ireland'').
   Another Ritchie favorite is the Battlefield Band, which plays
music based on traditional Scottish tunes.
   Dougie MacLean, who toured with Ritchie last year, also is a
popular attraction. He's a Scottish songwriter who writes new music
in traditional arrangements.
   You also could hear the contemporary offerings of Nightnoise,
including cuts from ``Something of Time'' and ``At the End of the
Evening.''
   ``When I first moved here I had no idea there was such a
connection between the area and Scotland,'' Ritchie says. ``I
didn't expect the people to take such an interest in the music.''
   To Ritchie, the music's appeal transcends most of life's
differences _ including age, national origin and economic class.
   ``People enjoy music that's emotional,'' she says. ``This music
is loaded with emotions.''
   Her fans come from all ethnic backgrounds, not just those with
an Irish or Scottish heritage. ``This music ... has something
everyone can enjoy.''
   Her own tastes run from traditional Celtic music to jazz and
classical and on to contemporary artists like U2, Van Morrison and
Nancy Griffith.
   Ritchie can be spotted at concerts across the country taping
live shows for later play on the ``Thistle &amp; Shamrock.''
   Last March, Ritchie took the ``Thistle &amp; Shamrock'' on the road.
Six Scottish musicians, headed by fiddler Dougie MacLean, played
sellout concerts in 10 U.S. cities. The second annual tour will
begin in September.

<P>
KJQY-FM(103.7) is a pawn in a complicated corporate chess game that probably 
won't be completed for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Although the deal that would have made Westwood One the station's new owner is 
off, New York financier Bob Sillerman's Command Communications has until Feb. 
15 to exercise its option to buy the station from Group W. 
</P>
<P>
The original plan was for Sillerman to turn around and sell his rights to 
"KJOY," a traditional ratings power with its elevator music format, to Westwood 
One for a total of $19 million, including $4 million in Westwood stock. In 
return, Command would buy Westwood One's 50% stake in WNEW-AM in New York. 
</P>
<P>
But Westwood One's stock has been spiraling downward, and both Sillerman and 
Westwood now say they really aren't that interested in making a deal. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile KJOY general manager Bert Whalen has already made it clear that he 
would like to buy the station, and he's putting together a team of investors. 
He tried to buy the station before the Westwood deal was announced but couldn't 
swing it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a possibility that I might work with Sillerman," Whalen said. "But I'd 
much rather get together San Diego investors." 
</P>
<P>
One name that continually pops up is former Noble Broadcasting and Viacom 
executive Norman Feuer, an old friend of Whalen's. 
</P>
<P>
Feuer, who left Noble a few weeks ago to "rearrange his sock drawer," said 
Thursday that "at this moment" he's not interested in the station. Among other 
reasons, he said, the oft-quoted $19-million figure is too high. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is "too complicated at this point," Feuer said. 
</P>
<P>
Whalen looks at the situation this way: "There are a lot bullets flying, and 
there is so much smoke that when it all clears the one person still standing 
will get the station." 
</P>
<P>
Although Jeff Prescott talks about the desire for change and a sense of timing, 
a two-year guaranteed contract for a reported annual salary of $160,000 each 
certainly had a lot to do with Prescott and partner Mike Berger's recent 
"defection" from KGB-FM (101.5) to XTRA-FM (91X). 
</P>
<P>
Their old station, KGB-FM (101.5), where Prescott worked for 14 years, doesn't 
offer employees contracts. 
</P>
<P>
KGB general manager Tom Baker was "disappointed" that Berger and Prescott 
didn't give him an opportunity to make a counteroffer. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, when KSDO-FM (Classic 103) had tried to hire the team for its new 
classic rock format, KGB countered by giving each a raise. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked what it would take to keep us," Prescott said. "Mike and I blew it. 
We asked for too little." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the year, KGB had given each an unsolicited $10,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
But KGB owner Brown Broadcasting has always been known for being tight with the 
purse strings. 
</P>
<P>
"They throw nickels around like manhole covers," said one industry source. 
</P>
<P>
Baker counters that the station signed the other member of the Berger and 
Prescott team, Cookie "Chainsaw" Randolph, who was wooed by several stations, 
to a big new contract after Berger and Prescott left. Randolph may be the 
highest paid radio personality in the county, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
Prescott said they never took the 91X offer back to Baker because 91X had made 
it clear they didn't want to get into a bidding war. Besides, they had already 
made up their minds to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"We just liked the sound of it (switching stations)," Prescott said. "Maybe we 
were ready for a change." 
</P>
<P>
But he doesn't deny that money was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
"We just wanted to get our share," Prescott said. "We make a lot of money for a 
radio station." 
</P>
<P>
An impressive number of movie buffs noticed a mistake in last week's media 
column. Yes, indeed, it was Peter Finch, not Albert Finney, who starred in 
"Network." "So much for your holier than thou attitude," said one caller. And 
that came from a friend. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KKYY (Y95) program director Pat Finn has resigned to pursue "personal goals." . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
KGTV (Channel 10) general manager Ed Quinn reportedly wrote a letter to Helen 
Copley apologizing for certain aspects of a recent Michael Tuck "Perspective" 
piece, which blasted the Union-Tribune publisher's anti-union activities. "No 
comment," Quinn said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KNSD-TV's (Channel 39) "Images of the Eighties" special was well-produced, an 
excellent blend of music and video. However, it wallowed in self-promotion, 
coming across as a commercial for its on-air staff. The video segments were 
separated by "interviews" with the station's news "personalities," as if people 
were dying to find out what anchorwoman Denise Yamada was doing when Mt. St. 
Helens erupted. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Former Channel 10 anchorman Paul Majors, who left to anchor the news for the 
NBC affiliate in Minneapolis, KARE-TV, is among those being mentioned as a 
possible anchor replacement for Channel 10's Michael Tuck. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A study by the accounting firm of Miller, Kaplan, Arase and Co. says San Diego 
radio revenue jumped 10% in 1989, up to about $90 million. The gain is 
respectable, but it indicates a change in the industry's growth curve. A 20% 
increase was reported in 1988, a year that will be forever worshipped by local 
radio station owners. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This is a big week for local fans of ABC News. Correspondent Morton Dean will 
be imparting wisdom at Point Loma College tonight. On Friday, ABC media analyst 
Jeff Greenfield will play UCSD's Mandeville Auditorium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Friday at 5:30 a.m., KSON AM (1240) and FM (97.3) will dedicate 36 
hours of its programming to "Kids Get Cancer 2," a radiothon to benefit St. 
Jude Children's Research Hospital.

   It would take Broadcast Music Inc. 28 years
and six months to relive all its yesterdays.
   Or ``Yesterday,'' to be precise. The Beatles classic that Paul
McCartney once called ``Scrambled Eggs'' until he thought of a
better title is the most-broadcast tune in the song publishing
company's vast catalog. It's gone past the 5 million mark.
   Played back to back, that would amount to more than 28 years
worth of ``Yesterday,'' said Frances Preston, BMI president and
chief executive officer.
   Preston knows this arcane piece of musical trivia because that's
what her company does.
   Through computersheets, BMI keeps track of how
many times songs are played in order to funnel royalty checks to
its stable of more than 60,000  and radio log ssongwriters. The company
is
celebrating the 50th anniversary of its birth with a series of
public events this year.
   ``It's not celebrating BMI, it's celebrating the creativity of
the great songwriters and publishers who have built this catalog,''
Preston said.
   With the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers,
BMI is involved in a high-stakes competition that's invisible to
most music fans but very important to those who make money off
music. BMI against
the music business establishment and has now become the
establishment, said author Marc Eliot, who wrote about the
company's birth in his book, ``Rockonomics: The Money Behind the
Music.''
   The companies work by signing a royalties contract with
songwriters, occasionally getting into a bidding war for big-name
artists. Musicians are assured a source of income at a time when
they may be struggling to make it in the business, or after their
time has passed.
   The companies check how many times a song is performed on radio,
television or elsewhere and collect license fees that are
distributed to songwriters. In the case of ``Yesterday,'' it means
estimating airtimes through logs kept by radio stations on what
songs they play.
   It's not just the Beatles' version of the tune that's counted,
but renditions recorded by Ray Charles, Placido Domingo, Elvis
Presley, Merle Haggard, Lawrence Welk, the Supremes, Frank Sinatra
and about 100 others.
   And it's not just on radio stations, but every time the song is
performed at trade shows, in shopping malls, on elevators and even
on airplanes, Preston said.
   Back when BMI was formed in 1939, ASCAP had a virtual monopoly
on song publishing. Broadcasters angered with the royalty rates
demanded by ASCAP and the limited number of licensed composers they
could play on the air started the company, Eliot described in his
book.
   The new company had an open-door policy for all sorts of
musicians that were essentially ignored by ASCAP, including country
music, rhythm and blues and, eventually, rock 'n' roll, Preston
said.
   ``They just became a house organ, a scab union in order to gain
representation for what ASCAP considered the garbage of the pile,''
Eliot said. ``It turned out to be the cream of the crop.''
   BMI signed artists who weren't part of the traditional Tin Pan
Alley, such as Leadbelly, Woody Guthrie and Hank Williams in the
early years. When rock 'n' roll started, it gave BMI access to a
goldmine of hits from Chuck Berry, the Everly Brothers, B.B. King,
the Beatles and the Rolling Stones.
   By the late 1950s, BMI was jokingly referred to in the industry
as Big Money Incorporated, Eliot said in ``Rockonomics.''
   Today, the two companies compete on almost an even keel, Eliot
said. BMI, because it's still more willing to take a chance on
unknown artists, still has an advantage in rock and pop music,
while ASCAP has the lead in such areas as Broadway and television,
he said.
   ``They've become more conservative, they've become less
embattled,'' he said of the two companies. ``They realize there's
room at the table for both plates. It's better to exist without a
cold war.''
   Preston said the constant advance of new technology keeps BMI
royalty hunters busy. For instance, the use of music as a
motivational tool at trade shows and corporate meetings is a
lucrative part of the business that was hardly thought of a decade
ago.
   The increased use of ``sampling'' old riffs in new songs,
particularly by rap artists, presents a fascinating new challenge
for the publishing companies, Eliot said.
   In some cases, older artists whose work is being appropriated
don't appreciate what the new musicians have done, he said.
   It's still an open question that may have to be decided by
courts. Former members of the '60s rock band the Turtles were
furious with rappers De La Soul for using part of their music
without permission. MC Hammer recently cut Rick James in on part of
the royalties for ``U Can't Touch This,'' which borrows the melody
from James' hit, ``Superfreak.''
   BMI has planned several events to celebrate its anniversary,
including giving a special achievement award to Michael Jackson.
But one anniversary commemoration may make music fans envious.
   The company has produced a three-CD set of some of its best
music, including the pop charts and television themes. It's
virtually an encyclopedic look at what's been popular for the last
50 years, from the Tommy Dorsey band's ``Opus No. 1'' to the Miami
Sound Machine's ``Rhythm Is Gonna Get You.''
   Don't look for it in stores, however _ the company is just
distributing it to people in the industry, politicians and the
media.
   ``I've had so many calls from people asking if they could buy it
somewhere,'' she said. ``But it's not for sale.''

FT  04 JUN 94 / Cinderella rides the waves: The growth potential of UK
commercial radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the past 20 years, CanWest, Canada's largest privately-owned television
group, has been offered radio stations or stakes in stations. It has always
said No - until now.
The Canadian group, which also has television interests in New Zealand,
Australia and Chile, this week took a 24.5 per cent stake in Talk Radio UK,
the UK's third national commercial broadcaster; CanWest regards the deal as
one of the most exciting media investments it has made.
Mr Arthur Price, who used to run MTM, the Hollywood independent production
company responsible for the drama series Hill Street Blues and Lou Grant, is
equally enthusiastic. His money is behind the UK-controlled Media Ventures
International, the largest shareholder in the station, which saw off five
rivals to clinch the winning bid.
Mr Price may be running something of a risk with his share of the Pounds
6.5m equity. It remains unproved whether Talk Radio UK can replicate in the
UK the increasing success of talk format radio stations in north America. It
plans to mix news, controversy and debate with drama, comedy and quiz shows.
The station, due to be launched on February 4, and the interest it has
created among investors, is nevertheless the latest symptom of the
renaissance in commercial radio in the UK.
After more than a decade of trying, the Cinderella medium has broken free
from its financial straitjacket: commercial radio accounted for only about 2
per cent of total UK advertising revenue, even as the number of stations has
grown.
Last year radio advertising leapt to Pounds 178.9m, compared with Pounds
140.9m the previous year, while the proportion of total advertising rose
from 2.8 per cent to 3.4 per cent - quite apart from a further Pounds 30m
received in sponsorship. Commercial radio has increased its share of total
listening to more than 45 per cent and on present trends should overtake all
the BBC stations combined sometime next year.
This overall improved performance has started showing through in the
industry bottom line, with the largest commercial radio group, Capital
Radio, reporting its best figures - a pre-tax profit of Pounds 8.4m for the
six months to March - an increase of 80 per cent over the same period a year
before.
Investors in the City of London, like the advertising industry, are starting
to take radio seriously. 'Commercial radio has come of age. At the moment
everything is positive for radio,' says Ms Lucy Brooke, an analyst who
specialises in radio at the UK stockbroker James Capel.
The arrival of the national stations, in particular the first of them,
Classic FM, has been vital in raising the profile of an industry that was
previously local, fragmented and seen as rather downmarket.
'I do think Classic FM made commercial radio respectable,' says Mr Peter
Baldwin, director of the Radio Authority, the industry regulatory body. In
this case respectability led straight to earnings.
Commercial radio executives like to tell the story of how Barclays Bank
became a convert to their cause. Scepticism on the part of marketing staff
was overcome, it is suggested, by directors who were listening with pleasure
to the new classical music station. Last year, Barclays spent considerably
more than Pounds 1m on commercial radio.
While Classic, Richard Branson's Virgin 1215, the second national station,
and Atlantic 252, the other, 'unofficial' commercial broadcaster from the
Irish Republic, which transmits to a large part of the UK on long wave, have
been important in making radio a more central medium for advertisers, other
factors have also been significant.
One has been the creation of National Network Radio, an initiative by Mr
Richard Eyre, the managing director of Capital, which made it possible for
the first time to buy an advertising campaign on more than 120 local radio
stations from a single purchase point - campaigns that can be aimed at
targeted audiences such as football fans.
In another move that has boosted revenues from commercials, radio stations
set aside their rivalries to support the Radio Advertising Bureau, which
promotes radio as a medium and advises potential new advertisers on how to
make the most of commercial radio.
Commercial radio has also received a big boost from radical changes at BBC
Radio 1 taking the channel even further away from a hit music driven agenda.
The result has been the loss of more than 3m listeners in less than two
years.
Further growth is likely to come from a host of new regional and local
stations. Five regional stations launch in September - for example Heart FM
in the West Midlands. Chrysalis, the media and record group which won the
licence, plans to offer adult contemporary music.
Mr Richard Huntingford, head of Chrysalis Radio, believes the potential for
building assets is considerable. The franchise application - only national
stations go to the highest financial bidder - cost about Pounds 50,000. The
station will be worth, he believes, closer to Pounds 10m.
Chrysalis is also planning to take its adult contemporary music format to
London, where applications for four licences - two AM and two FM - are due
in by June 28. Chrysalis will face competition, not least from Transworld,
one of the largest commercial radio groups, which have been working on an
adult contempory music format for more than two years.
Mr Eyre of Capital believes that such initiatives will ensure that
commercial radio continues to leap forward. He says the European average of
5 per cent of total advertising devoted to commercial stations is attainable
in the UK - sooner than most people expect.

   When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, the U.S. government
halted trade with Iraq and sent out troops. Ten thousand
Westerners in the Middle East discovered they were hostages.
Americans began bracing for a recession -- or war.
   And Jeff Gonzer and Mike Coleman started writing songs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Gonzer, the host of the morning show at Boston radio
station WZLX, thought he might try his hand at parody. He
jotted down some lyrics. He showed them to the station's head
of production, Mike Coleman, who wrote some more and set them
to some familiar music. A few days later a new song -- to the
tune of Paul Simon's "Me and Julio Down by the School Yard"
made its debut:
                                                                                                       

   Well we're on the way
   American troops are coming
   We're on the way
   Not takin' our time so goodbye Saddam
   King of Baloney, we'll clean your corona
   Seein' me &amp; Hussein down by the oilfield
                                                                                                       

   Listeners in Boston have also been treated to such
standards as "Please Mr. Postman" -- as the Marvelettes
probably never envisioned it:
                                                                                                       

   Oh yes wait a minute Mr. Hussein
   Kuwaaiit isn't yours Mr. Hussein&amp;
                                                                                                       

   Messrs. Gonzer and Coleman are part of a time-honored
tradition. For as long as wars have threatened nations,
people have longed to, well, lighten up a little. The
Gonzer-and-Coleman idea hasn't yet reached the mighty status
of a "trend." But Iraq parody is definitely catching on. The
folks at Dallas's Magic 102.9 FM, a soft-rock station, are
treating listeners to "Hussein Is Crazy," an opus based on
last year's Fine Young Cannibals hit, "She Drives Me Crazy":
                                                                                                       

   Hussein is crazy, ooh, ooh
   He's making news, ooh, ooh
   Hussein is crazy, ooh, ooh
   Worse than the 2 Live Crew, ooh, ooh
   It would be nice to get Hussein
   Wait 'til the time he meets his fate
   Cause Noriega's getting lonely
   He could use a new cellmate
                                                                                                       

   To be sure, America's radio stations aren't
underestimating the gravity of the situation. New York's
top-40 Z100 FM has played the national anthem at 9 every
morning since the invasion. "Coach" Mike Opelka, Z-100's
producer, says this is the station's "salute to the men and
women serving in the Middle East as well as for their
families back home in the States." Even the patriotic Coach,
though, is indulging in a bit of humor. His parody,
"Iraqity-Raq," is based on "Yakety Yak" by The Coasters:
                                                                                                       

   He's got his tanks and guns and planes
   And he is totally insane
   And his name is Saddam Hussein
   Invading countries is his game.
   Iraqity Raq, don't shoot back.
                                                                                                       

   Listeners, for their part, have called the stations from
all over the world -- including the Middle East -- with
requests for tapes of the parodies. Americans are the kind of
folk who appreciate this type of thing, says Peter Zipfel --
known to fans as "Zip" -- in Phoenix. He and Drew Lane do the
morning show on Mix 101 FM there, featuring their version of
"Horse With No Name" by America:
                                                                                                       

   Now we're sittin' in the desert cursin' Saddam Hussein
   He got too much sun, fried his brain
   In the desert, you know you could go insane,
   When you use mustard gas and your name is Hussein
   Allah, la, la la la . . .
                                                                                                       

   Songs may do fine for now, but fertile DJ-brains all over
America are already expanding their war effort. WZLX, the
Boston station, has already sponsored "Iraqnophobia Day,"
distributing gasoline to listeners for $1 a gallon. Magic
102.9 in Dallas constructed a Texas-sized greeting card.
Citizens spent one enthusiastic Saturday afternoon at the
local mall signing it. "We're thinking about the guys, but at
the same time we're having fun," said Garry D, of the
station's late-night show. As he spoke, the three-piece card,
filled with signatures and messages for the troops, was
already winging its way to our men and women in Saudi Arabia.

<P>
Saul Levine is feeling real jazzed these days -- even though jazz has nothing 
to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, the general manager and president of KKGO-FM (105.1), appears to have 
turned the fortunes of his radio station around -- with a little help from 
Bach, Beethoven and Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that he angered a devoted audience in the process is of little 
consequence to him now. 
</P>
<P>
Levine, a soft-spoken radio veteran, staged one of the most controversial radio 
broadcast changes of recent years in January when he scrapped KKGO's 
30-year-old jazz format for an all-classical music format. 
</P>
<P>
He was denounced by jazz lovers as a traitor who snatched the only powerful 
local jazz station off the airwaves. But classical music fans embraced Levine 
as a savior who picked up the baton when KFAC-FM, the city's commercial 
classical station, expired, and rock station KKBT boomed on the air in its 
place. 
</P>
<P>
The decision seems to have paid off for Levine. The audience has increased. And 
the hate mail has decreased. 
</P>
<P>
He said the reversal was largely due to having fewer commercials than KFAC, the 
recruitment of longtime KFAC personalities Tom Dixon and Rich Capparela, and 
the programming of full classical works, not excerpts. 
</P>
<P>
At the time that KKGO dropped the be-bop, classical music fans needed more than 
a commercial radio station, said Capparela. They needed a healing. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, the classical music audience has really gone through a lot of 
grief," said Capparela, the station's morning announcer. "Having Tom and I on 
the same staff is a healing element for the rift and the change." 
</P>
<P>
Capparela was skeptical about coming on board KKGO. "I wasn't certain of the 
depth of Saul's commitment," he said. "But now I see he really believes in the 
format. It's like being home, being among friends." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the wrath he incurred from jazz loyalists, Levine said he never worried 
about whether he was making the right move. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no doubt it would work," Levine said, sitting back comfortably in his 
spacious West Los Angeles office. "All we did was switch from one art form to 
another. We have a comfortable percentage of our former audience. I think 
people feel at home now with what we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
But many listeners still are not feeling too homey with the new KKGO. 
</P>
<P>
"It's undeniable that they left a tremendous void," said Dale Jaffe, the owner 
of Le Cafe, a Sherman Oaks restaurant and jazz club. "He deserted one type of 
music for another. I'm a business man, so I can appreciate when a business 
person has to make a hard decision. But I'm personally angry about it, and I'm 
definitely not going to listen to it." 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Cohn, vice president of sales and marketing for Chase Music Group, a jazz 
record label, said she didn't believe that KKGO was more successful as a 
classical station than a jazz station. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see what the ratings are after four quarters," Cohn said. 
"That would give a more accurate assessment of what's happening. I don't think 
it's changed that much." 
</P>
<P>
She added, "I'm very happy for classical music, but it's really sad for a city 
that has such an impact on jazz that there is not one commercial jazz station." 
</P>
<P>
Not even Levine's solution of programming all jazz on his AM station, KKJZ 
(540), has stopped the grumbling. That station, which is located in Hesperia, 
can barely be heard in Los Angeles without a special receiver. And most 
listeners have been unwilling to plunk down $150 to get the special box. 
</P>
<P>
Levine has heard all the criticisms about his switches and is aware of the 
continuing debate. But don't ask him if he feels guilty. 
</P>
<P>
"Feeling guilt is a poor way of dealing with reality," Levine said. "If the 
station could not pay its bills, it could not survive." 
</P>
<P>
Just maintaining the KKGO offices was costing $25,000 a month, Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
"I love jazz. I worked hard for it," he said. "When a listener laments and says 
we were the greatest jazz station in America, I hope they think of the 30 great 
years we had together." 
</P>
<P>
He said it was a losing battle to keep jazz going. "It was a diminishing 
audience, and it's hard to comprehend why," Levine said, speaking slowly. "It 
seems that the growing popularity of jazz has led to the fragmentation of the 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
It was too hard to satisfy listeners who wanted traditional jazz along with 
those who desired to hear more new-age and fusion jazz, Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
"But when we heard about KFAC going under, we knew that concert music was too 
important an art form to be removed from the L.A. scene," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Levine is now hearing raves from classical fans. 
</P>
<P>
Henry Frey, president of the Committee for Classical Music, a listener advocate 
group, said he couldn't be happier with KKGO. "This station might even be 
better than KFAC was," Frey said. "It's kind of funny how one man, Saul Levine, 
can influence the cultural life of a whole city. It shows one man can make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Arbitron ratings released last month showed KKGO holding steady with its 1% 
increase in market share last quarter. Its ranking -- 24th place out of 44 
stations -- and its 1.4% market share remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
Only about 300,000 listeners a week tuned in to jazz, Levine said. But the 
audience has since grown to 430,000 listeners a week. 
</P>
<P>
Audibly and physically, KKGO has few traces of its jazz past. In the station's 
offices, posters commemorating the station's 25th anniversary of jazz 
programming hang on several walls. But all that could be heard on the station's 
speakers were sonatas and waltzes. 
</P>
<P>
The city's former commercial classical music mainstay, KFAC, was purchased in 
January, 1989, by Evergreen Media Corp. for $55 million, the most ever paid for 
a classical radio station. Despite being deluged with pleas and letters from 
KFAC listeners, rumors continued that the classical format was about to be 
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
The station changed to a rock format in September. When that format failed to 
draw a substantial audience, the station switched to an urban contemporary 
format, which is meeting with more success. 
</P>
<P>
When KFAC was going under, Levine came almost immediately to the rescue. In 
September, he programmed classical music in the morning and evening hours on 
KKGO, and jazz fans began to sing the blues. 
</P>
<P>
Before KFAC's demise, the station had been running announcements telling 
listeners to tune in to KUSC-FM (91.5) for classical programming. But several 
listeners were disenchanted with KUSC. They said the station was ignoring 
traditional classical standards and was trying too hard to attract a younger 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a horrible format,"' said Ellen Stern Harris, vice president of the 
Committee for Classical Music. "They talked more about music than they played. 
They would put on this New Age stuff, trying to attract yuppies." 
</P>
<P>
KUSC General Manager Wallace A. Smith said he was glad that KFAC listeners who 
had not found his station to their liking were happy with KKGO. He described 
his station as an operation that was reaching out to an audience that doesn't 
ordinarily listen to classical music. "We have a fresher approach," he said. He 
said the situation was like an "oldies station going against a more 
contemporary station." 
</P>
<P>
He added that he didn't feel the station was diminishing his audience. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good that people have an option," he said. "And it looks to me that their 
success has not been at our expense. There is a large enough universe to 
support two classical stations. It helps both of us when both of us are 
successful." 
</P>
<P>
Levine said he was dedicated to presenting classical music in a way that "is 
acceptable to the established listener. But we want to attract the younger 
listener without driving away the old." 
</P>
<P>
However, he said he would not play new age, light pops or "Star Trek." "We will 
have respect for serious music." 
</P>
<P>
He also hopes to soon make the jazz fans happy with him again. The Federal 
Communications Commission has granted a license which will enable Levine to 
move the KKJZ transmitter to Costa Mesa. He said the signal should be much 
stronger in about six months. 
</P>
<P>
"We're here to preserve the culture," he said. "I'm just glad we didn't go to 
rock."

   The National Broadcasting Co. said Friday it had
tentatively agreed to sell five radio stations to Emmis
Broadcasting Corp., a privately-held concern based in Indianapolis,
for $121.5 million.
   NBC had previously disclosed it was looking for buyers for its
seven radio stations, and reaffirmed that it hoped to sell the
remaining stations.
   The stations which would be sold to Emmis Broadcasting under a
letter of intent are WNBC-AM and WYNY-FM in New York, WJIB-FM in
Boston, WKQX-FM in Chicago and KYUU-FM in San Francisco.
   The sale is subject to a definitive agreement by the companies
and approval by their respective boards of directors, the
announcement from NBC said.
   The sale would leave NBC, a subsidiary of General Electric Co.,
with radio stations WKYS in Washington, D.C., and KNBR in San
Francisco. The company has said it hopes to sell the Washington
station to a minority group.
   Emmis Broadcasting, which was founded in 1980 and claims to be
the largest privately-held radio broadcasting company in the United
States, already owns seven radio stations, including two in New
York City, WFAN-AM and WQHT-FM.
   The announcement said Emmis would have to ``resolve ownership
conflict in New York'' if the sale were completed. Federal
regulations prohibit companies from owning more than one AM and one
FM radio station in a single media market, according to a spokesman
for NBC, Dom Giofre.
   Emmis president Jeffrey Smulyan said that no decision has been
made on which of the four New York stations would be sold.
   In addition to the two New York stations, Emmis owns KPWR-FM in
Los Angeles; WAVA-FM in Washington, D.C.; KSHE-FM in St. Louis;
WLOL-FM in Minneapolis; and WENS-FM in Indianapolis.
   NBC is rooted in radio broadcasting. Radio Corp. of America
formed NBC in 1926 when it purchased what is now WNBC-AM in New
York.
   RCA and NBC were acquired by GE in 1986 and NBC began reviewing
its radio operations in mid-1987.
   Last summer, it sold its radio network business, which supplies
programming to independent stations, for $50 million to Westwood
One Inc., a radio production and distribution company based in Los
Angeles.
   NBC sold its WMAQ-AM radio station in Chicago earlier this year
for $13 million, Giofre said.
