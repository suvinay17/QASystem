<HEAD>Study: When It Comes To The Pentagon, Most Districts Give More Than
They Get</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon costs most congressional
districts more in taxes than they get back through military
spending but the situation likely will change in the 1990s because
of changing budget priorities, says an economist who studies the
effects of federal spending.
   ``These numbers should look quite different five or six years
from now,'' James R. Anderson said Thursday in releasing a study
that showed 321 of the 435 congressional districts lost money on
the deal.
   ``The patterns are fairly stable over a long period of time, but
I think we are going to see some very significant changes as we go
into the '90's, in part because of base closings but also in part
as we level off and perhaps significantly reduce the military
budget,'' said Anderson, a professor of economics at Michigan State
Uniersity.
   Anderson, a senior fellow of Employment Research Associates of
Lansing, Mich., an independent, non-profit economic consulting firm
that conducted the study, said the findings run counter to
arguments often heard on Capitol Hill.
   ``For years, members of Congress would say that even if they
wanted to, they couldn't vote against military spending because it
meant money coming into their districts,'' Anderson said. ``But we
found that the Pentagon budget isn't a boon to most congressional
districts, it's a drain.''
   The study was based on fiscal year 1987, during which U.S.
military outlays came to $282 billion. An additional $7.1 billion
was spent on military categories of foreign aid.
   For the study, that $289.1 billion was apportioned among the
states and then divided among congressional districts by a formula
designed to take into account income levels as well as population.
   The North Central region of the country was the biggest loser,
with 97 of its 113 districts in the net loss category. In the
Northeast, there were 80 net loss districts and 15 gainers. The
South had 99 net loss districts and 43 that gained. The West was
the closest with 45 districts losing and 40 districts, heavily
concentrated in Southern California, gaining.
   The district with the biggest net gain from military spending,
more than $3 billion, was the 10th District of Virginia, home of
the Pentagon. The biggest net loss, $1.2 billion, was in the 7th
District of Texas, in Houston.
   Anderson said he included prime contracts, military salaries and
wages and retirement pay but not veterans' payments in calculating
defense expenditures and in his formula estimated that about 40
percent of federal taxes go for federal expenditures. He said this
is higher than some other estimates, which run between 26 and 28
percent, because he did not include trust funds dedicated to a
specific project in his total.
   The study said 104 districts registered a net loss of $500
million or more.
   Of these, 19 districts were in New York, 13 in Illinois, 11 in
Texas, eight each in Ohio and Michigan, seven each in Florida and
New Jersey, five in California, four in Pennsylvania, three each in
Missouri, North Carolina and Wisconsin, two in Massachusetts and
one each in Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas,
Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Oregon, Tennessee and Virginia.
   States registering an overall net gain were Alabama, $6.2
million; Alaska, $310.1 million; Arizona, $1 billion; California,
$2 billion; Colorado, $737.4 million; Connecticut, $115.5 million;
Georgia, $299 million; Hawaii, $1.3 billion; Maine $71.9 million.
   Also, Maryland, $973.9 million; Massachusetts, $1.16 billion;
Mississippi, $552.9 million; Missouri, $2 billion; New Mexico,
$1.47 billion; South Carolina, $1 billion; Utah, $664.3 million;
Virginia, $9.4 billion; and Washington $1 billion.
   The most dramatic change was in Texas, which went from a net
gain in a previous study in 1981 to a loss of $5.26 billion.
   Other losing states were Arkansas, $612.8 million; Delaware,
$459.9 million; Florida, $3 billion; Idaho, $220.7 million;
Illinois, $11.62 billion; Indiana, $2.82 billion; Iowa, $2.19
billion; Kansas, $671.2 million; Kentucky, $1.25 billion;
Louisiana, $1.57 billion; Michigan, $8.33 billion; Minnesota, $2.26

   Also, Montana, $502.7 million; Nebraska, $942.1 million; Nevada,
$97.9 million; New Hampshire, $395.4 million; New Jersey, $7.57
billion; New York, $13.6 billion; North Carolina, $1.9 billion.
   Also, North Dakota, $237.9 million; Ohio, $5.75 billion;
Oklahoma, $1.18 billion; Oregon, $2.18 billion; Pennsylvania, $7.64

   Also, South Dakota, $357.2 million; Tennessee, $2.2 billion;

<TEXT>
   Thirty of the 50 states are improving their
infant mortality rates enough to meet a federal goal of reducing
nationwide deaths this year to nine per 1,000 live births,
according to a study by the Children's Defense Fund.
   The Washington-based organization, which lobbies on children's
issues, also said only five states have made sufficient progress to
meet the goal of the U.S. surgeon general of reducing the
proportion of low birthweight babies to 5 percent.
   Babies born with low birthweight are 20 times more likely than
other infants to die in infancy and face greater risk of lifelong
disabilities, the report said.
   The report said 10 babies died for every 1,000 live births in
the United States in 1988. That placed the United States 19th among
nations, behind Singapore, Hong Kong, Spain and Ireland, it said.
   The fund ranked the 50 states and the District of Columbia on
their improvement in 10 areas of caring for children and the
adequacy of the states' investments in programs benefiting children.
   Six received grades of 50 percent or more _ Vermont 65, Maine
60, Massachusetts and Minnesota 55, and Connecticut and Delaware 50.
   New Mexico received the lowest grade, credited with 10 points of
a possible 100.
   Other scores included California and South Carolina 45 percent;
Illinois, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, Washington and Wisconsin 40 percent; Alabama, Alaska, Iowa,
Michigan, North Dakota and Virginia 35 percent.
   Others were Arkansas, Florida, Hawaii, Maryland, Nevada, Ohio,
Tennessee and West Virginia 30 percent; the District of Columbia,
Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina,
Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Wyoming 25 percent.
   Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi and Missouri received 20 percent
and Colorado, Idaho, Kansas and South Dakota 15 percent.
   The ratings measured progress in prenatal care, reducing the
proportion of infants born with low birthweights, child poverty,
births to unmarried women, teen birth rates, establishment of
paternity, child poverty, housing affordability, high school
graduation and youth employment.
   Only Alabama, New Hampshire and Vermont demonstrated adequate
progress on six of the 10 measures, the fund said. Arizona and
Maryland each showed no progress, deterioration or inadequate
progress in nine of the 10 areas, it said.
   The report credited New Mexico with the largest percentage
reduction in infant mortality between 1978 and 1988, a drop of 42.6
percent from 14.1 to 8.1 per 1,000 live births.
   Rhode Island was second with a 38.2 percent reduction, from 13.6
to 8.4.
   States not making enough progress to meet the goal set by the
surgeon general were Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Delaware, the
District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana,
Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, New York,
North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Tennessee.
   The five states keeping up with the goal for reducing low
birthweight were Alaska, Minnesota, New Hampshire, North Carolina
and Utah.
   The study also rated the adequacy of state spending on Medicaid
coverage for pregnant women and babies, Medicaid coverage for
children, nutrition supplements, early education supplements, child
care quality, child support enforcement, improvement in benefits
under the aid to families with dependent children program, adequacy
of such benefits compared with housing costs, improving
student-teacher ratios and youth employment initiatives.
   It said five states _ Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota and
Vermont _ made sufficient investments in seven of those 10 areas.
It said Idaho, New Mexico and South Dakota had not invested
sufficiently in any.
   The report called on President Bush to take several steps to
improve the lot of children in the United States.
   It said the president should support child care legislation,
extend Medicaid coverage to pregnant women and families below 200
percent of the federal poverty level, expand food supplements for
all eligible pregnant women, infants and children by 1994, immunize
all children against preventable childhood diseases and reauthorize
Head Start with enough to serve all eligible children with quality
programs by 1994. It estimated the cost of these steps at $3.85
billion.

AFTER DELAYS, CAMPEAU HAS BAILOUT LOAN; 
</P>
<P>
REICHMANN BROTHERS GET CONTROL OF FIRM'S RETAILING UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
After more than a week of tense negotiations, Campeau Corp. said Tuesday that 
it finally has secured a $250-million loan that will bail out its cash-starved 
U.S. retailing companies. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for the infusion, the wealthy Reichmann brothers of Canada and 
their Olympia &amp; York Developments, as expected, gain control of the 
retailing units and will oversee Campeau's previously announced overhaul, 
including the sale of the glitzy Bloomingdale's chain. 
</P>
<P>
The Reichmanns supplant Robert Campeau, the bodacious Toronto entrepreneur 
whose hard-won acquisitions of Federated Department Stores and Allied Stores 
put his company deep in debt. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the company made much of the notion that its immediate liquidity 
crisis has passed, others said they would wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
Heller Financial Inc., a Chicago-based factoring firm that acts as a financial 
middleman between clothing makers and retailers, said it has not yet resumed 
shipments to the Federated and Allied chains. It halted shipments to the chains 
last week when Campeau's troubles were laid bare in financial filings with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Will Get New Chief 
</P>
<P>
The firm has advised manufacturing clients that future sales to Campeau's 
chains would be "at their sole credit risk" but that Heller would closely 
monitor any changes in Campeau's status. That situation still applies, 
spokesman John Brooklier said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
To restore Campeau Corp. to health, a four-member special directors committee 
was appointed to develop and implement plans. A new chief executive and a new 
chief financial officer will be named later, Campeau Corp. said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the changes were viewed as a setback to Robert Campeau, he sought in a 
prepared statement to put a good face on the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
"At my request, Olympia &amp; York has agreed to substantially increase its 
investment in Campeau and to be primarily responsible for the refinancing and 
restructuring," Campeau said. "The significant experience and expertise of the 
Olympia &amp; York organization will greatly assist in the endeavor." 
</P>
<P>
Although Campeau retains his chairman's title, a new, pared-down board of 
directors eliminates many of his relatives and longtime associates. Among those 
are his wife, Ilse, and a son, Daniel. 
</P>
<P>
The board will now consist of 10 members, half its previous size. In addition 
to Campeau, 66, they include Ronald W. Tysoe, the 36-year-old president and 
chief operating officer of Campeau Corp., and Byron E. Allumbaugh, chairman of 
Ralphs Grocery in Compton, of which Campeau owns a majority of the stock. Three 
other directors, including Albert Reichmann, were named by Olympia &amp; York, 
and the remaining four are from outside. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stymied by Creditors 
</P>
<P>
On the special restructuring committee will be Lionel G. Dodd, chief operating 
officer of Olympia &amp; York, who as chairman of the panel could break a tie 
with an extra vote; Robert J. Butler, retired president of the Eaton's 
department store chain of Toronto; G. William Miller, former U.S. Treasury 
secretary and now head of a merchant banking firm in Washington, and Tysoe. 
</P>
<P>
For days, Campeau Corp. had indicated that it hoped at any time to announce the 
loan arrangement, but observers said the company was repeatedly stymied by 
demands from cautious lenders who wanted to protect themselves. The agreement 
was not fully cleared until 6:30 California time Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after the loan agreement was announced, Allied Stores received $50 million 
and immediately covered an interest payment that it had been unable to make 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Olympia &amp; York will receive warrants entitling it to buy 
Campeau shares. If it buys all 16 million additional shares, its stake in 
Campeau would rise to about 38.4% from the 24.5% held now. Meanwhile, Robert 
Campeau's stake would drop to 43.2% from about 54%. 
</P>
<P>
The imminent settling of the cash crisis was cause for celebration for at least 
one interested party Monday night. Bloomingdale's Chairman Marvin S. Traub, who 
has said he would like to buy the 17-store chain, and a 15-person entourage 
popped open champagne bottles at Bouley, a restaurant in downtown Manhattan.

   Americans elect a new president and vice president this year
along with a dozen state governors, 33 U.S. senators and all 435
members of the next U.S. House of Representatives.
   Election Day is Nov. 8. The Census Bureau estimated the nation's
voting-age population _ people aged 18 or over _ will be 182.6
million, about 8.1 million more than in 1984 when 92,654,861
actually voted for president.
   This year's election is for the four-year presidential and vice
presidential terms starting next Jan. 20, when Republican Ronald W.
Reagan will retire after eight years in the White House.
   Here's the 1988 election situation for top federal and state
offices:

<HEAD>President and Vice President</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Vying for votes in the 50 states and the District of Columbia
are:
   _Republicans George Bush for president and Dan Quayle for vice
president. Bush, vice president under Reagan, and Quayle, a U.S.
senator from Indiana, were nominated at the Republican National
Convention in New Orleans. The last incumbent vice president to be
elected president was Martin Van Buren, a Democrat, who won in 1836.
   _Democrats Michael Dukakis for president and Lloyd Bentsen for
vice president. Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts, and Bentsen, a
U.S. senator from Texas, were nominated at the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta. The last sitting governor to be elected
president was Democrat Franklin D. Roosevelt of New York in 1932.
   Among various other presidential candidates on the ballots are
the New Alliance Party's Lenora B. Fulani of New York, a
psychologist, joined in most states by the Libertarian Party's
Ronald E. Paul, a former congressman from Texas, and in some states
by the Consumer Party's Eugene J. McCarthy, a former U.S. senator
from Minnesota.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Governor</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   An even dozen states hold elections for governor this year, with
eight of the seats at stake held by Republicans and four by
Democrats.
   Going into the general election, the lineup of governors was 27
Democrats and 23 Republicans.
   Of the 12 governors to be elected, nine will win four-year terms
and three _ in New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont _ two-year
terms.
   By law, Gov. Robert D. Orr of Indiana, a Republican, serving a
second consecutive term, could not seek re-election.
   Two other governors, Theodore Schwinden of Montana, a Democrat,
and John H. Sununu of New Hampshire, a Republican, chose to retire
from office rather than seek re-election.
   Along with New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, Indiana and
Montana, states electing governors this year are Delaware,

   Of the 33 seats up for election, 18 were held by Democrats and
15 by Republicans.
   Those elected on Nov. 8 will begin six-year terms on Jan. 3,
1989, and will serve in the 101st, 102nd and 103rd Congresses.
   Six incumbents chose to retire from office rather than seek new
terms in 1988: Democrats Lawton M. Chiles Jr. of Florida, John C.
Stennis of Mississippi and William Proxmire of Wisconsin; and
Republicans Robert T. Stafford of Vermont, Paul S. Trible Jr. of
Virginia, and Daniel J. Evans of Washington.
   Sen. David K. Karnes of Nebraska, a Republican, was appointed in
1987 to fill an unexpired term. He is seeking election for the
first time this year.
   Texas law allows Bentsen to seek re-election while he runs for

<HEAD>U.S. House</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The 435-seat U.S. House of Representatives for the 101st
Congress is being elected this year. Members will serve during the
first half of the new president's administration.
   Under the Constitution, every state is entitled to one House
seat; beyond that, representatives are apportioned among the states
according to population, with figures determined on the basis of
every 10-year census.
   The term of office is two years, starting Jan. 3, 1989.
   To hold a majority, one party must win at least 218 seats.
Democrats have been in the majority in the House since the 1954
election of the 84th Congress.
   Present occupants of the House's 435 seats include 255 Democrats
and 177 Republicans, with three seats vacant.
   Here are the vacancies, and those who had held the seats: New
Jersey's 3rd District, Democrat James J. Howard, who died March 25;
Tennessee's 2nd District, Republican John J. Duncan, who died June
21; and New York's 19th District, Democrat Mario Biaggi, who
resigned Aug. 5.
   Representatives must be elected; House vacancies cannot be
filled by appointment.
   In all, 27 House seats are open _ three are vacant, one
incumbent lost in a primary, 12 representatives are retiring at the
end of this term, seven congressmen are nominees for Senate seats,
three gave up their House seats and unsuccessfully sought
nomination for the Senate, and one congressman is a gubernatorial
nominee.
   The remaining 408 representatives campaigned for re-election.

<HEAD>The Electoral College</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Because the nation uses an Electoral College system, voters
don't directly elect the president and vice president. Instead,
Americans cast ballots for electors, apportioned among the states
and the District of Columbia.
   In this election, 538 electoral votes will be at stake in 50
states and the District of Columbia, with at least 270 electoral
votes needed to win. Electors will meet in the states and District
of Columbia on Dec. 17. Their votes will be counted Jan. 6 by a
joint session of Congress.
   Reagan won the 1984 presidential election with 54.45 million
popular votes and 525 electoral votes, beating Democrat Walter F.
Mondale who received 37.57 million popular votes and 13 electoral
votes. Reagan carried 49 states in 1984 while Mondale carried
Minnesota and the District of Columbia.
   Here's the distribution of electoral votes at stake this year:
   _47 for California.
   _36 for New York.
   _29 for Texas.
   _25 for Pennsylvania.
   _24 for Illinois.
   _23 for Ohio.

   Many states are doing too little to tackle
major environmental issues including solid waste disposal, water
quality and protection of food supplies, according to an
environmental group that conducted a national survey.
   Renew America, a private environmental and conservation
organization, gave top ranking Tuesday to California and Oregon
among the 50 states, with Tennessee and Louisiana at the bottom of
the list.
   But the group, whose survey examined state efforts to deal with
five environmental problem areas, said that overall there still is
too little bele environmental problems on the state
level.
   Aggressive state initiatives to protect the environment remain
``the exception and not the rule,'' said Scott Ridley, who directed
the survey. In many cases, states are forced to make haing done to tackrd
budget
decisions with environmental protection losing out, added Tina
Hobson, the group's executive director.
   In other cases a state excelled in one area that was examined,
but fared poorly in others.
   For example, Maine was given the highest mark for dealing with
water quality issues but was ranked well below average in forest and
land management and average in protecting food quality.
   While Oregon was second only to California in the overall
ranking, in); drinking water
quality (Maine); food safety (Iowa); dealing with growth (Oregon).
   The survey ranked the states numerically, with 50 being the
highest possible when examining state actions undertaken to deal
with the five areas examined.
   In the overall ranking, which took into account state efforts in
all five areas, the top states were: California (42), Oregon (39),
Minnesota (38), Massachusetts (37), Wisconsin (37), Iowa (34), New
Jersey (34), Florida (32), Maryland (32), Connecticut (30), and
Washington (30).
   The states with the lowest ranking were: Louisiana (10),
Tennessee (11), Utah (12), South Dakota (13), Arkansas (13), Nevada
(14), Wyoming (15), West Virginia (15), Kentucky (15), and Indiana
(15).
   The report said the states with the best overall program aimed at
protecting drinking water were Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey,
California and North Carolina. The states with the worst record were
Arkansas, Nevada, Ohio, Tennessee and Louisiana.
   The study said there continue to be ``substantial gaps'' in the
monitoring of harmful chemicals in foods, although ``some states
have taken on a growing responsibility to protect food supplies,''
especially in monitoring for pesticide residues.
   It said the five states with the best programs for food safety
were Iowa, California, Minnesota, South Carolina and Wisconsin. The
states with the worst programs were Nevada, Indiana, West Virginia,
Utah, Louisiana and Wyoming.
   The report cited increasing concerns about the growing garbage
problem, but noted that only eight states so far have comprehensive
recycling programs and only 10 have laws requiring at least some
recycling of waste products.
   The states given the best marks for dealing with solid waste
disposal issues were Oregon, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Illinois,
Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and
Wisconsin. Those with the lowest marks were Mississippi, South
Carolina and Arizona.
   The study said Oregon, California, Wisconsin, Massachusetts,
Florida, New York, New Jersey and Minnesota had the best programs
for dealing with the impact of growth. States with the poorest
programs were Arkansas, Mississippi and West Virginia.
   The report said only seven states have enacted laws that attempt
to protect forests by balancing the needs of timber producers and
conservationists. It said the six states with the best forest
management programs were Washington, California, Idaho, Oregon,
Massachusetts and Minnesota.

<HEAD>May Department Stores' Profit Up 3.3 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   May Department Stores Co. reported Thursday
that its profit after taxes edged up 3.3 percent in the second
quarter from a year earlier, as sales increased 21 percent.
   The nation's seventh-largest retailer said its second-quarter
profit rose to $63 million, or 42 cents a share, from $61 million,
or 40 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter.
   Second-quarter sales expanded to $2.72 billion from $2.25
billion a year earlier.
   Sales and earnings for the latest quarter include results from
the 38-store Foley's and 18-store Filene's department stores
divisions, which May acquired for $1.5 billion effective May 1. The
second-quarter results also include a pretax gain of $47 million,
or 19 cents a share, from the sale of May Florida, a five-store
department store division based in Jacksonville, Fla.
   In addition, the results for the quarter include a pretax charge
of $26 million, or 11 cents a share, for costs related to closing
non-productive store locations and $22 million, or 9 cents a share,
for integrating Foley's and Filene's into the parent company.
   During the second quarter, May signed a letter of intent to sell
its 76-store Loehmann's specialty store division. The transaction
is expected to be completed by mid-September.
   In the first six months of the year, May earned $125 million, or
83 cents a share, little changed from $125 million, or 81 cents a
share, in the first half of 1987.
   First-half sales rose 12 percent, to $4.95 billion from $4.42
billion a year earlier.
   May operated 3,090 stores at the end of the first half. Store
openings during the second quarter included one Caldor store, two
Venture stores and 50 Payless ShoeSource stores.

<HEAD>360,000 Truckers Could Lose Driving Privileges, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Up to 360,000 truckers could lose their
driving privileges if states don't step up their plans to comply
with a new federal commercial driver's license law, congressional
investigators say.
   The General Accounting Office said Monday that 33 states may not
comply with a federal law that requires truck drivers to take tests
and obtain federally approved commercial driver's licenses by April
1, 1992. The law aims to get unsafe drivers off the road by
requiring them all to meet national standards.
   However, the Federal Highway Administration official overseeing
the program said the states are doing ``a terrific job'' and that
all plan to meet the deadline.
   A quirk in the law gives states until October 1993 to establish
testing and licensing programs, but the shorter deadline for
drivers to have the licenses makes it necessary to set up programs
18 months earlier.
   The commercial driver's license law was prompted by the 4,500
annual highway fatalities involving large trucks. Trucks account
for 4.5 percent of the traffic and 10 percent of the fatalities
nationwide.
   Before Congress passed the law, several states required only
ordinary driver's licenses for truckers and others had inconsistent
requirements, leading some drivers to go shopping for lenient
states.
   The GAO study, which assesses conditions as of October 1989 when
states were surveyed, said 13 states indicated they cannot meet the
April 1992 deadline.
   An additional 20 states plan to test and license between
one-fourth and one-half of their drivers in the final three months
before the deadline, which the study said probably is impossible.
   Jill Hochman, chief of the highway agency's standards review
division, said seven states already are issuing the new commercial
driver's licenses . They are Arizona, California, Maryland, New
Hampshire, Utah, Virginia and Washington. Michigan started but
temporarily suspended its program because of a computer problem,
she said.
   Twenty-seven other states plan to issue licenses before the end
of the year, Ms. Hochman said, and 10 states have not yet passed
commercial driver's license laws.
   Ms. Hochman said a limitation in the GAO report is that
conditions in a state can look different depending on which
official answers the survey.
   ``The states have been making terrific progress,'' she said.
``Nobody said it's going to be easy, but they all plan to meet the
deadline and I'm certainly not going to challenge their plans.''
   Most states plan to test and license all of their drivers over a
two-year period rather than the four years permitted in the
legislation that implemented the law, the GAO study said.
   GAO also said most states are having problems in making changes
in their driver's license computer systems so they can hook into a
national databank of information on all drivers.
   Ms. Hochman said the Federal Highway Administration has been
working with states to help them set up the computer system.
   GAO researcher Ron Wood said the 13 states that indicated they
could not meet the April 1992 deadline for all truckers to be
licensed are Arizona, Hawaii, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Nevada, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Wyoming, Rhode Island, Kentucky,
Wisconsin and Massachusetts.
   Wood said the 20 states that plan to issue an unusually large
share of licenses in the final three months before the deadline
are: California, Oregon, Illinois, Florida, Iowa, Alabama, Alaska,
Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New
Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah and
Vermont.
   The 10 states that have not yet passed commercial driver's
license laws, according to the highway administration, are Alaska,
Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Vermont and New York. The District of Columbia also
has yet to pass such a law.

<HEAD>Half of All Americans Live in 37 Metro Areas</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two centuries after the United States was
founded as a largely agricultural nation, nearly nine-tenths of the
population growth is occurring in metropolitan areas, the Census
Bureau reports.
   Almost half of all Americans reside in just 37 major urban
areas, the bureau said Thursday in a new analysis of the patterns
of growth. And the metropolitan share of the population is growing
faster than that in rural areas.
   The ``rural renaissance'' reported in the 1970s when small towns
and rural areas were growing seems to have ended, with increases in
cities and suburbs now well in the lead.
   The census study found that about 86 percent of the nation's
population growth since 1980 has occurred in the 282 officially
designated metropolitan areas across the country. That pattern
represents a return to the metropolitan area dominance that has
been common since the era of the Great Depression, the bureau
reported.
   The analysis of 1987 figures found that nearly half of all
Americans, 48.9 percent, reside in the 37 metro areas with
populations of a million or more.
   Led by New York and Los Angeles, these metro areas had 119
million residents in 1987, the Bureau said.
   New Jersey leads the way as the only state entirely included
within metropolitan areas, the bureau noted. The northern portion
of the state is included in the greater New York metro area while
the southern portion is part of the Philadelphia region.
   Seven other states have more than 90 percent of their
populations in metropolitan areas _ California, Maryland,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Florida, Massachusetts and New York.
   Idaho is the least metropolitan state with only about 20 percent
of its residents in urban areas, the report added.
   Reflecting the nation's overall population trend, metropolitan
area growth has tended to flow to the South and West in recent
years, the Census Bureau observed in its study of growth patterns
between 1980 and 1987.
   The population loss experienced in the Northeast during the
1970s has halted in this decade, the agency found, while the
Midwest has continued to have net losses in recent years.
   ``A slowdown in population growth has taken place since 1980 in
much of the interior of the United States, especially in
nonmetropolitan areas,'' noted the report prepared by Donald E.
Starsinic and Richard L. Forstall.
   During this decade the nonmetropolitan population declined in 10
contiguous states _ Ohio, West Virginia, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,
Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas, the
bureau pointed out.
   The nation's metro areas with 1 million or more residents, as of
July 1, 1987, were New York, 18.0 million; Los Angeles, 13.5
million; Chicago, 8.1 million; San Francisco, 5.9 million;
Philadelphia, 5.9 million; Detroit, 4.6 million; Boston, 4.1
million; Dallas, 3.7 million;
   Also Washington, 3.6 million; Houston, 3.6 million; Miami, 2.9
million; Cleveland, 2.7 million; Atlanta, 2.6 million; St. Louis,
2.4 million; Seattle, 2.3 million; Minneapolis, 2.3 million;
Baltimore, 2.3 million; Pittsburgh, 2.3 million;
   And San Diego, 2.3 million; Tampa, 1.9 million; Phoenix, 1.9
million; Denver, 1.8 million; Cincinnati, 1.7 million; Milwaukee,
1.5 million; Kansas City, 1.5 million; Portland, Ore., 1.4 million;
Norfolk, Va., 1.3 million;
   Plus Sacramento, 1.3 million; New Orleans, 1.3 million;
Columbus, Ohio, 1.3 million; San Antonio, Texas, 1.3 million;
Indianapolis, 1.2 million; Buffalo, N.Y., 1.2 million; Providence,
R.I., 1.1 million; Charlotte, N.C., 1.1 million; Hartford, Conn.,
1.1 million and Salt Lake City, 1.1 million.

<HEAD>NASA Spending Benefits States, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA spending next year will create 237,000
private-industry jobs and spur $23 billion in private-industry
sales, according to a study commissioned by a group of former NASA
employees.
   The NASA Alumni League said the study by Management Information
Services Inc. is the first comprehensive look at the state-by-state
industry and job effects of space agency purchasing.
   California, with its huge aerospace industry, is the biggest
benefactor, expected to garner $6.7 billion in sales and 70,332
non-government jobs created directly or indirectly by NASA-related
spending, the study found. That's nearly 30 percent of the U.S.
total in both categories.
   But the study also indicates that states not usually tied to the
space industry benefit. New Jersey, for example, can expect $506
million in sales and 5,411 jobs, the report said.
   The study was based on an estimate that the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration will spend $11.3 billion in fiscal 1990,
which begins Oct. 1. NASA has asked for a budget of more than $13
billion, but that probably will be cut by appropriations committees
studying the request.
   ``NASA procurement spending in 1990 will create 237,000 private
sector jobs, $23 billion in private industry sales and $2.4 billion
in corporate profits,'' the study said.
   Spending on that level also will generate $7.4 billion in
federal, state and local tax revenues.
   Florida, Alabama, Maryland and Texas, all with major NASA
facilities, also lead in the sales and jobs category.
   Texas would have $2.1 billion in sales and 19,528 non-government
employees from the NASA spending, while Florida would have $1.3
billion in sales and 14,756 jobs, according to the study.
   Maryland would have $994 million in sales and 11,122 jobs, while
Alabama would have $858 million in sales and 8,582 jobs.
   The report also computed the indirect impact of NASA procurement
on various states.
   Michigan, for example, would receive $14 indirectly from
procurement-induced funds for every dollar the state receives in
NASA money.
   Other states with large benefit ratios were: Indiana $12 for
every $1 in NASA funds; Illinois 9.8 to 1; Missouri 8.3 to 1; and
Oregon 6.7 to 1.
   The study provided these estimated sales and job figures:
   Alaska $35 million in sales, 236 jobs; Arizona $229 million,
2,424; Arkansas $89 million, 876; Colorado $490 million, 5,381;
Connecticut $601 million, 6,224; Delaware $32 million, 291; District
of Columbia $75 million, 990; Georgia $299 million, 3,224;

   GOP Tax Targets -- State by State

   President Bush and senior Republican congressmen last week
announced they had agreed on a budget proposal to cap the
amount of state and local income taxes taxpayers can deduct
on their federal tax returns. The plan would cap deductions
at $10,000. If passed and implemented, the plan will have
widely different effects. The increased burden caused by
reducing federal deductions for state and local taxes will be
borne unevenly by the states. The result will be a list of
"winning" and "losing" states with respect to their
residents' tax burdens.
   It is widely taken for granted that most tax deductions
benefit only the wealthy. But approximately 70% of all
itemized deductions benefit the middle-income ranges. Of the
numerous exclusions and deductions, those for pension
contributions, mortgage interest on homes, payments from
employers for medical insurance and care, state and local
income and property taxes, and Social Security benefits
account for more than half the amount going to individuals.
These deductions are popular because they benefit millions of
Americans. With the exception of direct Social Security and
Medicare payments, they provide the biggest middle-class
benefit in the federal budget.

   Reducing or eliminating the current deductibility of state
and local income taxes will have a great impact on citizens
of states that use these two forms of taxation as their major
source of tax revenue. New York, Massachusetts and Maryland,
which bear the greatest per-capita burden of state and local
income taxes, will naturally be the victims of any reduction
in the deductibility of those taxes. (New Jersey citizens
will approach the top of the list after Gov. James Florio's
new tax increases kick in.) Residents of those same states
are already among those that pay the highest total per-capita
federal taxes. Thus New Yorkers, citizens of Massachusetts,
and Marylanders will all feel more strongly the bite of the
tax burden their states impose on them.
   Conversely, the federal tax liability of residents in
states that have no income tax will not change one cent if
the deductibility of state income tax is eliminated.
Currently, seven states -- Florida, Nevada, South Dakota,
Texas, Washington, Wyoming and Alaska -- impose no individual
income tax. Three states -- Connecticut, New Hampshire, and
Tennessee -- impose no levy on earned income, taxing interest
and dividends only. (Connecticut also taxes capital gains.)
Although residents of such states do not gain absolutely,
they do gain relative to those of high income-tax states. The
new disparity might well cause people to "vote with their
feet" and move from high-tax states to lower-tax states. In
this age of computers and faxes, why choose to live in
high-tax states like New York or New Jersey at all?

   Drug agents staged dozens of raids nationwide
Thursday, arresting 119 people on charges of growing marijuana
indoors or selling equipment for it and seizing 65 indoor groves,
the Drug Enforcement Administration said.
   In addition, the agents raided 22 stores that sell the equipment
for the indoor marijuana growing, seizing and boarding up seven or
eight of them, said DEA spokesman Frank Shults, who provided the
figures as of early evening for the raids in Operation Green
Merchant.
   The DEA planned to raid a total of 65 commercial businesses in
22 states as well as more than 100 indoor cultivation locations in
46 states on Thursday. The raids continued into the night.
   A marijuana legalization advocate said the raids were just ``a
publicity stunt.''
   A law enforcement source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said earlier in the day that federal agents had expected to make
only 100 arrests Thursday. In the previous month, 112 people had
been arrested in connection with the same investigation.
   The stores raided ``range from mom-and-pop to something
equivalent to a K-mart,'' said the source.
   ``We have established through the advertising and other means
that these stores do sell the indoor cultivation apparatus and give
advice about its use for the cultivation of marijuana,'' Shults
said. ``They openly do it.''
   The DEA used undercover agents in every store to determine
whether the owners knew the equipment _ such as lighting,
irrigation and ventilation apparatus _ was being used for indoor
marijuana cultivation, the source said.
   The stores were located in Alaska, Arizona, California,
Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan,
Minnesota, Missouri, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, Washington
and Wisconsin.
   The only four states where no raids were planned on indoor
cultivation sites were Hawaii, Nebraska, North Dakota and West
Virginia.
   Doug McVay of the National Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws, said the raids on stores were ``a publicity stunt,
a largely ineffective one,'' and ``silly, really silly.''
   ``I can understand the DEA's frustration,'' McVay said. ``It's
true, some of this equipment is being used for (indoor marijuana)
cultivation. On the other hand, dirt is used for indoor
cultivation. I don't think we're going to stop people from selling
dirt.''
   An increasing number of U.S. marijuana growers have been moving
their plants indoors because of extensive aerial surveillance that
enables officials to spot drugs grown outside.
   In the past month, 112 people have been arrested on charges of
cultivating marijuana at 94 indoor growing locations containing
17,000 sinsemilla marijuana plants, according to Shults.
   ``We are trying to send the message to all those people in the
United States who have been cultivating marijuana that they are
violating the law, they will be caught, they will be prosecuted
and, if found guilty, they will serve time,'' said Shults.
   The raided stores ``specialize in the sale of these otherwise
legitimate products with the knowledge that they will be used to
cultivate marijuana,'' he said.
   A DEA statement said the agency has obtained ``the names and
addresses of thousands of individuals who are suspected of being
involved in the indoor cultivation of marijuana.''
   Steve Hager, editor of High Times magazine, said he believed
federal drug agents had subpoenaed the United Parcel Service
shipping records of the publication's advertisers ``and have been
using that information to build a conspiracy case of some kind.''
   ``I've been told that by people who have been visited by the
DEA,'' Hager said. ``They were told they (the agents) got their
names from UPS.''
   However, UPS spokesman Al Winnik said, ``There's no word here of
any subpoenas by DEA ... or any agency of that type.''
   The DEA would not comment except to say there was still an
``ongoing investigation.''
   McVay noted that legitimate manufacturers sell such items as
lights used for growing plants indoors and kits of indoor gardening
equipment, and that they can be bought at hardware stores.
   Shults said such companies were not targeted by the DEA, which
carried out the raids in coordination with state and local
officials.
   Domestic suppliers produce about 25 percent of the marijuana
consumed in the United States, while Colombia produces about 40
percent, Mexico 25 percent and other countries 10 percent,
according to government estimates.
   The DEA estimated that domestic production increased from 2,100
tons in 1986 to 4,350 to 4,850 tons in 1988. The National Drug
Control Strategy announced by President Bush in September called
for increasing federal funds for domestic marijuana eradication
from $8 million in fiscal 1989 to $16 million in the 1990 fiscal
year.
   A pound of sinsemilla _ the highly potent form of marijuana that
accounted for about 53 percent of the domestically eradicated
cannibis in 1988 _ costs $2,000 to $4,000, McVay said.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Let Dtates Sue Asbestos Manufacturers in High
Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to let 30
states sue 26 manufacturers in the nation's highest court over
removal of asbestos from public schools and other government
buildings.
   The court, without comment, refused to hear arguments that the
manufacturers should pay for such removal.
   Today's action does not preclude the 30 states from suing
asbestos manufacturers in their respective state courts.
   But the states first went to the justices, hoping to head off a
competition among themselves for monetary damages from the asbestos
makers.
   In an unsual move, the states asked the court to invoke its
``original jurisdiction'' so this big-stakes dispute could be
consolidated and resolved before any lower court considers it.
   The request was denied.
   Asbestos has been used for decades in the construction of
buildings and ships. The inhalation of asbestos fibers has been
linked to various diseases.
   Tens of thousands of personal-injury lawsuits have been filed
against asbestos manufacturers by shipyard workers. Hundreds of
asbestos-in-buildings suits also have been filed.
   The justices were told that eight states have sued asbestos
makers in their state courts, seeking to have them pay the costs of
removing the substance from public buildings.
   The eight states are Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi,
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia.
   In response to the request acted on today, lawyers for one
asbestos maker, W.R. Grace &amp; Co., said, ``There is no national or
even interstate issue involved here. Plaintiffs may turn at any
time to their own state courts as have their eight sister states.''
   Lawyers for the company said the suggestion ``that only this
court can equitably apportion defendants' assets and spare the
states a race to judgment'' wrongly implies a preordained finding
of liability.
   They quoted Environmental Protection Agency reports indicating
that the presence of asbestos in a building does not mean the
health of occupants is endangered if the asbestos-containing
material remains in good condition and is unlikely to be disturbed.
   The states' request was prepared by Attorney General Kenneth
Eikenberry of Washington state.
   The states were Washington, Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Indiana,
Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire,
New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode
Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Wyoming.
   New Jersey subsequently asked the court to join the other states
as a plaintiff.
   In addition to W.R. Grace, the named defendants were National
Gypsum, U.S. Gypsum, USG Corp., American Biltrite, Armstrong World
Industries, Azrock Industries, Basic Inc., Carey-Canada, Celotex,
Certainteed Corp., Crown Cork &amp; Seal, Eagle-Pitcher Industries,
Fibreboard Corp., Flintkote, GAF, Georgia-Pacific, H.K. Porter Co.,
Keene Corp., Kentile Floors, Owens-Corning Fiberglass,
Owens-Illinois, Pfizer, Raymark Industries, Sprayed Insulation Inc.
and Turner &amp; Newall.
   The case is Alabama vs. W.R. Grace, 116 Original.

   Much of the GI generation that fought in World
War II and returned home to create an economic and baby boom is
retiring in relative comfort, a Florida researcher reports.
   More than half of retirees age 65 to 74 have income at double
the poverty level, and 12 percent form an elite with income from at
least three sources, according to Charles F. Longino of the
University of Miami.
   But elderly affluence isn't spread evenly across the nation,
Longino reports in the June edition of American Demographics
magazine.
   ``There are a cluster of states with a large share of the
comfortably retired,'' Longino said in analyzing 1980 Census data,
the most recent information available with sufficient detail for
the study.
   Connecticut, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada and New Jersey had many of
the comfortably retired, while the pension elite made strong
showings in Connecticut and Washington, Longino found.
   The poverty level for a family of four was $8,414 in 1980.
   The World War II GIs reaped the benefits of government programs
that provided educations and home loans, cost-of-living escalators
for their Social Security benefits and federal laws protecting
private pensions, Longino noted. In addition, many were able to
invest in stocks and bonds in a time of booming economy.
   Longino looked at three groups of retirees in his study, those
aged 55 to 64, 65-74 and 75 and over in 1980. He termed them the GI
generation after the term ``Government Issue,'' which became a
popular for soldiers in the 1940s.
   Just over half (51.1 percent) of those in the 65-74 age group
were listed as comfortable, and 12.3 percent were in the elite
elite.''
   For the younger group, 59.1 percent were comfortable and 4.7
percent were in the elite. They were less likely to qualify as
elite since few were receiving Social Security in addition to other
retirement benefits.
   The oldest group listed 37.5 percent as comfortable and 8.5
percent as elite. Few in this group had income-generating assets
and most completed a large share of their working lives before
World War II, when pension benefits were less common and lower.
   Longino found the confortably retired of the 65-74 age group in
such resort and retirement states as Florida, Nevada and New
Jersey; in Connecticut, where many New York executives have
retired, and Hawaii.
   Hawaii has a large Asian population where extended families are
more common, a situation which boosts the household income measure
used as the basis for this calculation, Longino noted.
   For the pension elite, Connecticut and Washington placed well,
as did Florida, Maryland, New Jersey. Longino also noted that there
are clusters of affluent elderly in some metropolitan areas.
   He cited as examples Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach, Fla.; San
Diego and Palm Springs, Calif.; and along the east coast of Mobile
Bay, Ala.
   Longino is director of the Center for Social Research in Aging
at the University of Miami, and his work was partially funded by
the American Association of Retired Persons. American Demographics,
published by Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc., reports on population matters.
   Here is a state-by-state rundown of the percentage of Americans
aged 65-74 who are considered confortably retired, or among the
pension elite.
   Comfortably retired (CR) is defined as having income of twice
the poverty level. Pension elite (PE) means receiving from three
sources: Social Security, pensions and assets.

   Here are the rankings of states in the ninth
annual ``Manufacturing Climates Study'' conducted by the accounting
firm of Grant Thornton.
   For the first time since the study was conducted, states were
divided into categories of high- or low-manufacturing intensity. To
be ranked among the high-intensity group, total employment in
manufacturing in the state in 1987 must have exceeded the national
average of 17 percent or manufacturing shipments must have exceeded
the national average in dollar terms.

   Here is the state-by-state compliance rate for
public and private school entities for 1987 federal regulations
requiring inspections for asbestos and development of a cleanup
plan, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
   The percentage reflects the percentage of public school districts
and private schools that have either completed the required
inspection and developed a cleanup program or have received an
extension from state officials to comply with the law.

   Here are the state rankings in the 10th annual
Manufacturing Climates Study released Wednesday by the accounting
firm Grant Thornton.
   The states are divided into two categories, high manufacturing
and low manufacturing.
   High-manufacturing states contributed more than 2 percent of the
value of manufacturing shipments in the United States over the last
four years and have 16.43 percent or more of their work forces in
manufacturing.
   The state rankings were based on 21 factors that were narrowed to
five categories: state and local fiscal policies; unemployment
benefits and workers' compensation levels; labor costs; energy costs
and work hours lost because of strikes; and quality of life.
   The states are listed from best to worst:

<HEAD>Revco Agrees to Sell 221 Stores</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TWINSBURG, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Revco D.S. Inc. said Friday it agreed to
sell 221 of its 1,873 stores to Reliable Holdings Corp. of Fort
Worth, Texas, as part of its restructuring under bankruptcy court
protection.
   Revco, one of the largest drugstore chains in the country with a
work force of 26,800 people, announced Jan. 26 that it planned to
sell 712 of its stores.
   The price of the deal with Reliable Holdings was not disclosed.
   Weighed down by debt incurred in a takeover, the chain had filed
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law in July 1988. Its restructuring involves selling
stores in the western United States and emphasizing its operations
in the East, where it gets most of its sales.
   Revco will sell to Reliable Holdings all its stores in western
Tennessee and in Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky,
Michigan and Missouri, Revco said.
   Reliable Holdings Corp. was formed by Acadia Partners LP, and
the management of Reliable Drug Stores Inc., a 112-store chain
based in Indianapolis.
   ``We anticipate a very smooth transition of these stores to
Reliable,'' said Boake A. Sells, Revco chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Friday's announcement is the first involving buyers for the
stores. Any sales are subject to bankruptcy court approval.
   Revco officials in January said they hoped that those working in
stores targeted for sale would be hired by eventual buyers.
   The company said its business in 10 Eastern states accounts for
64 percent of the chain's sales.
   The states are Georgia, Maryland, New York, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, West
Virginia and Virginia.
   Other Revco stores are in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado,
Florida, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New Mexico, Oklahoma and
Texas.
   Revco has annual sales of more than $2.7 billion.
   The company filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in
July 1988, after it failed to make an interest payment on
outstanding ``junk bonds'' used to finance its $1.5 billion,
management-led leveraged buyout the previous year.
   In a leveraged buyout, the buyer of the company borrows the
purchase money with the idea of repaying it through asset sales and
earnings.

<HEAD>US Farmers Get $3.8 Billion in 1988 Drought Benefits</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In New Jersey, 905 farmers collected federal
1988 drought benefits totaling more than $17.1 million, an average
of about $18,925 each.
   Eight farmers in Arizona got $132,836 from the Agriculture
Department under last year's drought aid program, an average of
about $16,600 apiece.
   Most payments, however, averaged far less than those examples,
according to financial reports released by the department's
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service.
   Nationally, a routine ASCS report showed recently, approximately
$3.78 billion was paid to 789,707 farmers under the Disaster
Assistance Act of 1988. Payments by state were listed but the
numbers of farmers in each state were not.
   The agency provided supplemental information, including a
breakdown of the number of farmers by state, at the request of The
Associated Press. A sampling of state averages, including the top
five states, was computed by the AP.
   Karen Kostoff of the agency's information resources management
division said Wednesday the numbers of farmers listed by state would
not add up to the national total.
   That is because if a farmer has property in two states, for
example, each will show up in the state figures, she said.
Nationally, however, the farms under the same ownership are counted
as a single unit.
   Most of the producers nationally _ 709,222 as of June 30 _
benefited because of crop losses due to last year's drought, with
some also collecting under other provisions of the program, such as
livestock feed benefits.
   The national figures showed that more than $3.3 billion of the
$3.78 billion paid out so far was for crop losses.
   On an overall basis of total benefits, North Dakota led the
nation with about $407 million received by 49,144 farmers, an
average of $8,280 each.
   Wisconsin was second with nearly $396 million going to 52,285
producers who averaged $7,490 each.
   Third was Illinois where 98,775 farmers averaged $3,830 each for
a total of $378.8 million.
   Iowa was fourth overall at $326.5 million, an average of $4,520
to each of 72,169 farmers.
   Minnesota was fifth with more than $311 million, averaging $5,450
among 57,083 recipients.
   In all, farmers in the five states collected about $1.82 billion
under the 1988 drought program, accounting for 48 percent of the
total.
   The state with the smallest number of drought aid recipients was
Alaska, where the report showed one farmer collecting $6,640 from
the government. Rhode Island showed two farmers, but they got only
$4,282, an average of $2,141.
   California, traditionally the leader in terms of agricultural
sales value, got about $20.8 million in drought assistance, an
average of $7,260 among 2,864 farmers.
   In some of the smaller eastern states, where farms often produce
high-value specialty crops, the averages were relatively high. In
Connecticut, for example, 58 farmers averaged $11,453 each for a
total of $664,300.
   Kansas, where winter wheat farmers suffered greatly this year as
the 1988 drought lingered, got $61.4 million in aid, an average of
$1,740 for each of the 35,255 farmers who got benefits.
   Here are the 1988 drought payments as of June 30, by state, as
reported by the department's Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service. State payment averages, however, were not
included.
   The first column of figures is the number of producers for each
state. The second column, rounded in thousands of dollars, is the
total amount paid. Hawaii was omitted by the agency.

   Revco D.S., Inc., the first big company to seek
bankruptcy-court refuge from debts incurred in a leveraged buyout,
announced plans Friday to sell 712 of its 1,873 stores in a costly
restructuring.
   The company, one of the country's largest drugstore chains with
a work force of 26,800 people, said it would refocus on operations
in Eastern states where sales are strongest.
   ``The strategic advantages of restructuring operations have
become increasingly clear over time,'' said Gregory K. Raven, chief
financial officer for the company based in Twinsburg, Ohio, a
Cleveland suburb. ``Internal and external analyses agree _ this is
what's best for Revco.''
   Its announcement to shrink by more than a third came against a
background of growing alarm about the consequences of the 1980s
debt-financed takeover tactic known as the leveraged buyout or LBO.
   Earlier this month, Toronto-based Campeau Corp., owner of many
famous U.S. department stores, sought Chapter 11 protection because
it couldn't make payments on the multibillion-dollar debts incurred
to buy the stores over the last three years.
   Revco's drugstores will now join many of Campeau's department
stores on the auction block.
   Revco filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors back in
July 1988, about a month after it failed to make an interest
payment on about $700 million in outstanding high-risk junk bonds
used to finance its $1.5 billion management-led LBO in 1986.
   It was the first major LBO to seek the sanctuary of bankruptcy
court to untangle its finances.
   To cover the cost of the restructuring announced Friday, Revco
said it would take a record $230 million charge against earnings in
its third fiscal quarter, which will end Feb. 10.
   The company intends to open discussions with potential buyers
for 712 of its drugstores. Any sales are subject to bankruptcy
court approval.
   Boake A. Sells, chairman and chief executive officer of Revco,
said he believed the majority of company's employees will keep
their jobs. The company hopes that those working in stores now
targeted for sale would be hired by eventual buyers, he said.
   Harrison Jones, manager of the Revco store in downtown Magnolia,
Ark., said he was concerned but not surprised at the news. Arkansas
is one of the states where stores are targeted for divestiture.
   ``Actually, I feel good about it, like maybe someone in this
general area will purchase this thing and it will be solid
financially and they'll take it and run with it,'' Jones said.
   ``Generally (employees at the store) aren't surprised. They're a
little disappointed because on the surface it generally means bad
news,'' he said.
   In October, it was reported that Revco was considering a $925
million buyout bid from a Texas-based group of investors that
included billionaire Robert Bass, well known for his takeover
forays.
   It was unclear Friday whether these investors played any role in
Revco's divestment plans. Revco spokeswoman Kathleen Obert declined
to identify any possible store buyers.
   Sells said it was too early to estimate how long it would take
to complete the restructuring.
   Sales from the stores to be divested represent about 36 percent
of the chain's total sales, the company said.
   Revco plans to concentrate and build on markets in Georgia,
Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South
Carolina, eastern Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.
   Locations targeted for divestiture include 712 Revco drugstores
currently operating: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida,
Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan,
Mississippi, Missouri, New Mexico, Oklahoma, western Tennessee, and
Texas.
