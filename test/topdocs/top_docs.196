JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT ;

CRAWFORD, MCGRIFF JAZZ UP THEIR CAREERS AS SOUL MATES

<P>
When David (Fathead) Newman had his horns stolen, Hank Crawford and Jimmy 
McGriff became a team. 
</P>
<P>
How did a horn theft lead to a new musical partnership? Saxman Crawford and 
blues organist McGriff, who Wednesday opened a two-week stay at Elario's in La 
Jolla, first played together in Greenwich Village at a benefit three years ago 
to help Newman replace his instruments. 
</P>
<P>
"They played a set that just took the roof off the place," remembers Maxine 
Harvard, who manages both musicians. "Being the promoter/P.R. type I am, I 
said, 'I can't let this go.' " Harvard booked them together at the Apollo 
Theatre, and the duo clicked again. 
</P>
<P>
Both musicians record for Fantasy/Milestone, and, soon after the Apollo date, 
Ralph Kaffel, the company's president, asked them to do an album together. 
</P>
<P>
"Soul Survivors" was released in 1987. Since then, the pair have done two more 
albums, with the latest, "On the Blue Side," scheduled for January release. 
</P>
<P>
McGriff's swinging work on Hammond B-3 organ provides the perfect foil for 
Crawford's funk/blues sax. Crawford might not want to hear it, but McGriff 
lends the music a bluesy fire lacking on some of Crawford's solo projects. 
</P>
<P>
Though both men are blues players at heart, they also have substantial 
background in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"I can go either way," Crawford said. "Most people classify me as R&amp;B or 
blues, but I cut my roots on be-bop, straight-ahead. I'm more comfortable with 
an R&amp;B, blues sound. My approach to horn is actually vocal, a singing, 
melodic sound." 
</P>
<P>
As a youngster, Crawford sang and played piano in church. One of his first jobs 
was backing Ray Charles. He took up alto sax in high school, listening to 
Charlie Parker, Louis Jordan, Earl Bostic and Johnny Hodges. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford left Charles to record several albums of his own in the '60s, and 
spent the '70s having his sound uncomfortably molded to fit the light, fusion 
mold then in vogue at the CTI label. In 1983, he moved to Milestone and 
returned to his grittier style, and he has recorded regularly with a band 
including Newman and Dr. John since then. 
</P>
<P>
McGriff grew up listening to jazz players such as Archie Shepp and Reggie 
Workman, who lived in his Philadelphia neighborhood. He started on drums, vibes 
and piano, but, when he switched to organ, Jimmy Smith, Richard (Groove) Holmes 
and Milt Buckner became important influences. His first hit was an arrangement 
of Charles' "I've Got a Woman," which reached No. 5 on Billboard's R&amp;B 
chart in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
Both Crawford and McGriff have independent careers and spend about half their 
time playing or recording with each other. 
</P>
<P>
At Elario's, Crawford and McGriff will be backed by drummer John Guerin and 
guitarist Bob Devos. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the swan song sounded for jazz at Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach. 
This week, it's more like "Happy Days are Hear Again." 
</P>
<P>
Local jazz aficionado and occasional promoter Bob Geib reports that some local 
musicians have reduced their fees to keep the club alive. This Friday night, 
Geib has lined up saxophonists Rod Cradit and Gary Lefebvre, followed by the 
spicy Latin jazz sounds of Algo Caliente Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon in the larger disco room behind Diego's restaurant, 
clarinetist Bobby Gordon and trumpeter John Best work out with their quartet 
from 2 to 4:30, with special guest Mike Wofford on piano. 
</P>
<P>
The cost for all shows is $5. Those who have a Diego's Loft VIP card get in for 
half price Fridays and Saturdays. Leave your name and address at the door, and 
they will mail you one. 
</P>
<P>
Geib expects jazz to continue at the club for the foreseeable future, but with 
more emphasis on local acts than the nationally known performers featured 
before the owners temporarily shut down to curb their losses. 
</P>
<P>
KPBS-TV (Channel 15) kicks off a new season of "Club Date" jazz programs Friday 
night at 10:30, with a show featuring Hank Crawford and Jimmy McGriff. It airs 
again Sunday at 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
KPBS is getting a jump on its national sisters. Most public television stations 
will begin airing the new group of six shows next spring or summer. 
</P>
<P>
Heading into its second year, the show is gaining a following and improving in 
technical quality, according to producer Paul Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 100 public television stations across the country aired 
"Club Date." For 1989, there are six new programs featuring guitarist Joe Pass, 
trumpeter Harry (Sweets) Edison, Crawford and McGriff, singers Mose Allison and 
Jimmy Witherspoon, and flugelhorn player Art Farmer with saxophonist Clifford 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Sound for this season's shows was recorded on an eight-track machine, so the 
instrumental mix could be polished after the live studio session. Programs are 
broadcast in stereo. 
</P>
<P>
Elario's continues as the show's co-sponsor, with the club's Steve Satkowski 
serving as associate producer. Marshall said each show costs more than $10,000 
to produce; he would like to find a corporate sponsor to pay for programs 
featuring such jazz legends as Ella Fitzgerald and Dizzy Gillespie. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: A clip from a "Club Date" featuring Jimmy Witherspoon may be used when 
the blues singer appears on CBS News's "Night Watch" program tonight. . . . 
Randy Porter, the talented local pianist, is working Monday nights at Elario's 
through December. . . . The San Diego Jazz Orchestra, led by alto saxophonist 
Gary Scott, plays the KSDS-FM (88.3) "Jazz Live" series Tuesday at 8 p.m. in 
the city college theater. You can attend, or listen to the live radio 
broadcast. . . . Guitarist Hank Easton and his Easton West Band are featured 
Mondays through November at Humphrey's on Shelter Island.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: JAZZ EDUCATORS' MEETING LURES A 
HESITANT MARSALIS 
</P>

<P>
This month's National Assn. of Jazz Educators convention may give San Diego its 
biggest single shot of jazz in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Big-time talent will take to the stage at Town &amp; Country's Atlas Ballroom 
on three nights, but the nitty-gritty will be the more than 2,000 jazz 
educators, musicians and aficionados expected Jan. 12-15 for clinics, new 
product displays and the chance to mingle with influential jazz figures. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who will make the scene is 28-year-old sax virtuoso Branford 
Marsalis, who decided, after initial reluctance, to become involved with the 
Southern Comfort "All That Jazz" Collegiate Competition. He'll play a set with 
the winning jazz band Jan. 14. 
</P>
<P>
Marsalis, brother of acclaimed trumpeter Wynton, isn't performing because he 
thinks formal jazz education is essential. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the people we idolize -- Charlie Parker, Sonny Rollins -- didn't go to 
music school. If they did go to school, they were trained in classical music." 
</P>
<P>
Nor is he coming to San Diego because he thinks Southern Comfort is the right 
sponsor for a black jazz musician. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a black American, I was extremely hesitant to hook up with a liquor 
company. If you look at the situation in terms of advertisement, especially in 
the black community, the majority of things are cigarettes and liquor. But in 
the past five years, Southern Comfort has given $1 million to jazz education in 
America. That outweighs any stigmas that could be attached. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so few people willing to do anything for jazz, we'll take help from 
anywhere we can get it." 
</P>
<P>
Marsalis just finished touring with rock star Sting. "In a half-hour jazz gig, 
I play more notes than during a 2 1/2-hour Sting concert," he said. "Once you 
do a rock 'n' roll gig, it takes awhile to get your jazz chops back." 
</P>
<P>
Marsalis might jam when he's here. His father's coming for the convention, as 
is younger brother Delfeayo, who plays with one of the three collegiate 
competition finalist bands. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz/blues greats Hank Crawford and Jimmy McGriff opened a two-week run at 
Elario's last night. Alto saxman Crawford, who likes to play "as if I were 
singing a song," got his big break in 1958 when he joined Ray Charles' band on 
baritone sax. Even in high school, he backed up bluesmen like B.B. King, Bobby 
"Blue" Bland, and Junior Parker. 
</P>
<P>
In 1986, he hooked up with fellow Milestone artist Jimmy McGriff, a master of 
the bluesy Hammond B-3 organ. McGriff and Crawford have Ray Charles in common. 
The organist scored a hit in 1962 with his instrumental version of Charles' 
"I've Got a Woman," which made No. 5 on Billboard's R&amp;B chart and 20 on the 
pop chart. Though he also plays several synthesizers, McGriff's heart is with 
the blues and the B-3. 
</P>
<P>
A three-month gig has turned into a yearlong stint at the downtown Marriott for 
Los Angeles guitarist Ron Eschete. "The general manager, Joel Rothman, is a 
dear friend of mine, and a big jazz fan," Eschete said. "I've known him for 
eight or nine years, since he used to manage the Anaheim and Newport Marriotts. 
He always told me he'd use me if he got the right room, and low and behold, 
last December he called after he'd just moved to the San Diego Marriott." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Pike, Gene Harris, Hampton Hawes, Warren Marsh, Milt Jackson, Ray Brown, 
and Dizzy Gillespie are among the talents that Eschete's played -- and recorded 
-- with. In San Diego, he's performing with locals Hank Dobbs (bass) and Ron 
Ogden (drums). 
</P>
<P>
Eschete's wife and son remain in L.A. while Eschete lives most of the week in a 
room at the hotel, where he plays Tuesday through Saturday evenings just 
outside of D.W.'s Pub. He's recorded five albums, including two on the Muse 
label. A new album of Cole Porter classics (such as "Love For Sale," "Every 
Time We Say Goodbye," and "What Is This Thing Called Love") should be out 
within the next few weeks. A typical set roams freely from Porter to Parker, 
from Jerome Kern to Antonio Carlos Jobim. 
</P>
<P>
'I'm a song person," Eschete said. "I just like good songs." 
</P>
<P>
Eschete expects to be at the Marriott for at least another three months. 
</P>
<P>

   ``In a Sentimental Mood'' (Warner Bros.) _ Dr. John
   
   Those who remember Dr. John as ``The Night Tripper'' who brought
a touch of bayou mysticism to the era of psychedelic rock will find
it curious to think of him as a sentimental kind of guy. Nor would
his usual concoctions of Delta blues, rock and honky-tonk lead one
to associate him with such Tin Pan Alley standards as ``More Than
You Know'' or ``Accentuate the Positive.''
   Even more unexpected are the lush string and horn arrangements
heard in the background of some of the nine tracks on this album of
classic old songs.
   But as an accomplished session player, Dr. John, a.k.a. Mac
Rebennack, is nothing if not versatile. So when he turns his
keyboard talent and his distinctive gravelly voice to sentimental
ballads such as ``Candy'' and ``My Buddy,'' he knows how to create
the right mood.
   Yet it's clear this is not the doctor's specialty. An inner
sleeve note credits Ray Charles for inspiration; the fact is, Ray
does it better.
   Dr. John's seen-it-all-and-then-some vocal style works much
better on the bluesy ``Black Night'' and on ``Makin' Whoopee,'' the
sassy duet with Rickie Lee Jones that leads off the album. Teaming
those two vocal stylists was the best idea behind this record, and
it would be great to hear more from them.
   The other highlights are the instrumental title cut (a Duke
Ellington number) and a rollicking rendition of Cole Porter's
``Love for Sale,'' both featuring Dr. John's piano playing, his
true forte.

   ``Kings of Boogie'' (GNP Crescendo) _ Savoy Brown
   
   In an age of ``classic'' soft drinks and candy bars, perhaps
Savoy Brown after 22 albums can be excused for taking on the title
``Kings of Boogie.'' But as a souvenir of the coronation, this
effort is pretty stale.
   There's plenty of boogie music here, but you've heard it all
before. On any given night, there probably are hundreds of bands in
bars across the country playing this type of music with more
inventiveness and freshness than what is displayed on ``Kings of
Boogie.''
   As always, bandleader Kim Simmons is impeccable on guitar. The
rhythm section is solid and vocalist Dave Walker can growl with the
best of them. The trouble is the material: It's tired, cliched and
forgettable.
   Oh yeah. The album's liner notes, gushing about the band's
``integrity,'' seem a little silly next to the thank you note to a
certain athletic shoe maker and the insert hawking ``Official Savoy
Brown Merchandise.''
   _ By Marc Rice, Associated Press Writer.

   ``A Night to Remember'' (Epic) _ Cyndi Lauper
   
   That is Cyndi Lauper's name on the new album, ``A Night to
Remember.'' And yes, it sure sounds like her. But for all we know,
it could be Paula Abdul. Or Jody Watley. Or Debbie Gibson. Fill in
your own choice.
   Once delightfully distinctive, Lauper's taken a distressing step
backward into the sea of ``wanna-bes'' with this record. The need
for hits has made her music generic.
   The Cyndi on the ``She's So Unusual'' album was a joy to know.
She was a tough, independent woman with a marvelous set of pipes
not afraid, as the song says, to have fun. Not many artists have
the guts to defend masturbation on their first album.
   Where did that Cyndi go? On the first three songs of this new
record, Lauper defines herself through men. There's the man she
craves so much she'll drive all night to sleep with him; the man
she craves so much she feels ``primitive'' urges; the man she
craves so much she can't bear to spend that first night without him.
   The narrator could be anybody. Although Lauper shares
songwriting credit on seven of this record's tunes, all are written
at least in part by professional song doctors _ people such as
Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly who are brought in for artists
desperate for hits.
   Some of the songs are good; these people didn't get their track
record by chance. ``I Drove All Night,'' in particular, builds
nicely with fine singing by the deeper voiced Lauper. ``A Night to
Remember'' is another catchy tune. However, both are weighted down
by overly loud drumming and busy arrangements.
   Some songs are too gimmicky. ``Insecurious'' and ``Like a Cat''
are ideas that probably sounded more clever on paper.
   None of the tunes, though, really sound like Lauper's.
   Remember, this is an artist whose last single stiffed and her
first starring role in a movie, ``Vibes,'' was a disaster. This
record has the uncomfortable feel of an artist who's lost her
confidence being directed by a record company concerned about a big
investment.

   "A lot of people are into music just because it's somethin' to do, and they say, 'Well, I'm gonna get out of it next year, I done made enough money.' My thing is not that way. 
See, music to me is my blood, it's my breathin', it's my everything. 
I don't wanna ever in life do nothin' else but what I do. 
Per-i-od. 

   "I been out here for almost 44 years," Ray Charles continues. 
"I guess you could say without braggin' I'm kind of like a Coca-Cola, like a trademark or somethin'." 

   Indeed Ray Charles has become synonymous with soul, a style he pioneered in the '50s by fusing gospel fervor with blues funk. 
And folks still appear thirsty for the real thing. 
Year after year fans keep him on the road for as long as he likes, playing every place from symphony halls to airport hangars, everything from righteous Rachmaninoff to country-gone-to-meeting. (For dates on his current tour, see the listings below.) 

   This past week they mobbed Manhattan's 200-seat Blue Note for six nights, vying for the privilege of paying $55 to catch one of Mr. Charles's rare club appearances, his first such Big Apple gig in longer than he can remember. 

   As the faithful waited in the rain, hoping for a miracle that would shoehorn them into the late show, the man himself was unwinding between sets in a club office. 
His signature shades were on, his shoes were off, and instead of the ivories, he was fingering chess pieces. 
Pondering the last move by Al Jackson, music director of his 16-man band, Brother Ray keeps up a running commentary. 
"I'm gonna accept that, yeah, I got to accept that," he says in a gravel-bottomed drawl. 
"So, since I have to accept that . . . humm . . ." 

   He moves his rook. 
"Yeah, it's a good interesting game, it causes you to think," Charles says of his longtime passion. 
"Just like people go out and they do aerobics, well chess is the same thing mentally." 

   Right now Charles, who turns 59 next month, needs all the cerebral calisthenics he can get. 
After six albums with Columbia's country-music division that performed disappointingly, he's negotiating a contract with a new label -- by himself. 
"Over the years lawyers have messed up more deals for people, 'cause my lawyer got to prove how great he is, and the company's lawyer got to prove how great he is, and the next thing you know the whole damn deal goes down the drain and both of them are still gettin' paid," he harrumphs. 
"After I make the deal I let the lawyers get their little buts and ifs straightened out." 

   So far he's done just fine. 
In fact Charles's 1960 agreement with ABC-Paramount gave him a degree of control that's still extraordinary -- a production deal, profit sharing and ownership of his masters. 
So today when you buy one of the collections of those ABC classics -- "Georgia on My Mind," "I Can't Stop Loving You," "Hit the Road Jack" and "Busted" among them -- some of your money is going to Ray Charles Enterprises Inc. 

   "It's not that I don't have people doing things for me, it's just that I control it," he is explaining. 
"I'm involved in anything that has to do with Ray Charles." 

   Maybe this fierce independence was born of his blindness. 
He decided early on to be his own kind of blind black singer. 
He made his motto "no dog, no cane, no guitar," and took up the piano even though it was kept on the "white" side of the segregated Florida state school for the deaf and blind he attended. 
He didn't want to be lumped with the strumming blind bluesmen of the previous generation. 
Before he left the school at 15, he'd also learned clarinet, trumpet, saxophone, organ -- and how to compose music in Braille. 

   He started his career by shortening his name from Ray Charles Robinson to avoid confusion with the boxer Sugar Ray. 
And in a more crucial decision, he disregarded the advice of record executives in the early '60s who told him that maybe country music wasn't the wisest career move. 
Instead, he went and recorded the still-startling "Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music," his first million-selling album. 
More recently he fought the government when it threatened to cut off funding for the Braille edition of Playboy. 

   "First of all, you can't even say the pictures are filthy, cause there ain't no pictures," he thunders. 
"And you can't say they use a dirty word because you tell me any nine-year-old that don't know those words today. 
Oh, I get mad, honey . . . 

   "Ok, Unit 3," Charles says, apparently out of the blue. 
Then comes the crackling reply, "This is Unit 3, Base." 
Charles is using a no-hands walkie-talkie. 
"OK, you better give me the time now," he says. 
Seconds later there's a knock on the door. 
It's Unit 3, otherwise known as road manager Muhammad Abdullah. 
"The time?" he says crisply. 
"It's 10:35." 

   In addition to Abdullah, Charles's companions for the next several months include the brass-heavy Ray Charles Orchestra; his five female backup singers, the Raeletts; two stage managers; a bus driver; and David Simmons, his valet, whose duties include fetching Chinese takeout and leading him on stage. 

   Earlier this evening Simmons had steered Charles through the maze of tables. 
The singer wore an embroidered silk jacket the color of maple syrup and bounced to the beat of his band, before taking his place at the electronic keyboard. 
He felt for the mike, then eased into "Sadie's Tune." 

   So big, so brilliant were the horns-four trumpets, four trombones, a half-dozen saxes-that they swamped his voice, which seemed to be awaiting a wakeup call. 
The crowd applauded. 
Then it went wild at the opening of the second song, "Georgia." 

   It was a moody "Georgia," a gentle one, the voice drifting with the alto sax like that moonlight through the pines. 
Lightly caressing the "tenderly," it still came up bruised. 
Charles took the song slow, phrasing as if making up the words as he went along. 
Whether he avoided vocal aerobatics for reasons of prudence or artistry didn't matter; he made you listen. 
It was a moment I thought of later, when Charles talked about the way he wants to be remembered: "I just hope that people say, 'Well, you know what I liked about Ray, he was always a soulful person. 
Any time you heard him sing, he always sounded like he meant it.'" 

   With a brassy blast, reverie was shattered as the band swung jauntily into "Mississippi Mud." 
Charles, in surer voice, rocked left and right with the rollicking chords he played. 
Every now and then a particularly high note propelled him off his bench like a jack-in-the-box. 

   Next, he began a sly blues, "I've Got News for You," adding on some staged byplay with the band, some rapping with the audience, and generally starting to lard the classy songs and stylish arrangements with showbiz shtik. 
All that jazz didn't do much except set the stage for the Raeletts' shimmying entrance. 

   Vocally the women did themselves proud, particularly on the gospelly version of "I Can't Stop Loving You" and the set's moaning, call-and-response climax, Charles's own "What'd I Say." 
Their main function, though, was as foils for Ray baby's billy-goat persona. 

   Fifty-five minutes after the lights dimmed, the show was over. 
But the fans paying their checks didn't appear to be calculating it had cost them a dollar a minute. 
No, they looked as though years from now they'd still be talking about one sultry night when in a shoebox-sized club they saw Ray Charles, so close he could have reached out and touched them.

A SAXOPHONIST OF MANY SOUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
MUSICIAN: BRANDON FIELDS, WHO GREW UP IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY AND WILL PLAY AT EL 
MATADOR ON MONDAY, DRAWS HIS INSPIRATION FROM MULTIPLE MUSICAL TRADITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Something old, something new. The phrase nicely sums up saxophonist Brandon 
Fields' source of musical inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
"I still consider myself a student, listening to all different types of music 
and trying to apply them to my musical sense," he said. "I search out the new 
stuff, contemporary music, the stuff that's playing right now, as well as 
researching as much old material as I can find. For me, that's a never-ending 
process: to stay in touch with what's happening now as well as what's gone 
before." 
</P>
<P>
But Fields, who joins fluegelhornist Tony Guerrero and bassist Luther Hughes' 
trio New Year's Eve at El Matador restaurant in the Huntington Harbour Mall, 
has a sound that's decidedly contemporary. His latest recording, "Other Places" 
(Nova), gives the wily saxophonist a chance to squirm and scream on originals 
with solid bass lines and accessible rhythms that reflect an early exposure to 
pop music. 
</P>
<P>
"My roots are more R &amp; B-oriented," he explained recently from his home in 
North Hollywood. "I listened to a lot of Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Nancy 
Wilson. From them I learned how to perform, the art of nuance, how to deliver 
the material. There's something about the way a great singer puts across the 
melody that does something to me. I've been influenced more by singers, really, 
than saxophonists." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Indiana, Fields began his musical training while growing up in Fountain 
Valley. His mother, a keyboard major in college, started Fields and his three 
sisters on the piano at age 5. 
</P>
<P>
He credits his parents with providing lots of support. "They would go out and 
buy all kinds of instruments -- a trombone one week, a drum set the next. The 
one that really felt good to me was the alto," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He cites two experiences that turned him on to jazz. While he was in high 
school in Santa Ana, his father took him to see Supersax, the band dedicated to 
Charlie Parker charts. "I just liked the sound of five saxes playing together 
like that," he said. And there was the first time he heard saxophonist Michael 
Brecker. 
</P>
<P>
"It was about a year later," he said. "We'd gone to a concert in San Diego, and 
they were playing (drummer) Billy Cobham's album 'Crosswind' in-between Chicago 
and Santana. And I thought, 'Who is this guy playing sax?' It was better than 
the stuff we'd paid to see." 
</P>
<P>
Fields interrupted music studies at Cal State Fullerton in 1976 to travel with 
a Top 40 group in Canada. On his return, he hooked up with Charles (Doc) 
Rutherford's big band at Orange Coast College, where he met other Orange 
County-based musicians like trombonist Mike Fahn and fellow saxophonist Eric 
Marienthal. These associations led to a long engagement in the early '80s at 
the Studio Cafe in Balboa with, among others, Chick Corea's bassist John 
Patitucci. 
</P>
<P>
Fields has also worked with Les Hooper, Victor Feldman and George Benson over 
the years. But he's best known for his association with the Rippingtons, the 
electric instrumental band led by guitarist Russ Freeman. "I never had too much 
artistic say in the band," he said. "Russ liked the way I played his material, 
and I liked playing it." 
</P>
<P>
Though heard on the Rippingtons' latest recording, he hasn't appeared live with 
the group for well over a year. "I just felt that I wanted to spend more time 
doing my own thing," he said. "With the success that my own record (1988's "The 
Traveler") had, it was time to branch out. But I'm really thankful to have been 
involved with a group that allowed so many people to hear me." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Rippingtons, Fields' band is more democratic in its selection of 
material. "I want to be part of a band where everyone makes a contribution, a 
band that's more than just a reflection of my personality," he explained. "Even 
though I'm the motivating force behind the group, I also rely on everybody's 
input." The new band, with keyboardist Dave Goldblatt and bassist John Pena, 
will record Fields' fourth solo album sometime in January. Unlike "Other 
Places," which features singer Phil Perry on a pair of cuts, the new album will 
be all instrumental. "I want to represent most of what we do on the album live. 
There have been some songs that we really couldn't do live because I felt they 
weren't strong enough to perform without the singer. I've never been into 
having a singer on a gig," Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
The saxophonist likes the idea of being in jam-oriented sessions like the one 
Monday at El Matador. "I don't like to go on a gig and have to read a lot of 
music," he said. "It takes some of the enjoyment away, some of the spontaneity 
that can happen when you're playing standards. I'm looking forward to just 
going out and playing with these guys." 
</P>
<P>
Brandon Fields appears with Tony Guerrero and the Luther Hughes Trio on Monday 
night at 8:30 at El Matador restaurant, 16903 Algonquin Blvd., Huntington 
Beach. Cover charge is $35, including dinner; $20 for the show only. (714)

RAY CHARLES DELIVERS RICH HORN OF PLENTY; 
</P>
<P>
THE FAMED R&amp;B SINGER DELIVERED A RANGE OF MOODS AND STYLES TO THE COACH 
HOUSE THAT NEARED PERFECTION.

Ray Charles doesn't work long, and he certainly doesn't work cheap, but his 
work was something close to perfection Thursday night at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
Charles, who will turn 60 next month, was in startlingly good voice throughout 
his early show, the first of four sold-out performances in a two-night stand 
(that's about 1,500 tickets sold at $39.50 a shot, the bulk of which probably 
goes to Charles for the sort of payday that can really make a guy look like a 
genius). 
</P>
<P>
As usual, Charles' set clocked in at a precise and punctual 55 minutes, 
including a five-minute warm-up blow by his 16-man band. But if the overall 
framework of a Charles show is strictly bounded, the 11 songs he inserted 
within it Thursday were the essence of musical freedom and unchained 
spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
Charles' range of moods, styles and textures turned those 50 minutes into a 
cornucopia, with his voice giving full embodiment to the concept "horn of 
plenty." He rang true with cottony, deep-grained intonations to create a 
cloistered intimacy during ballads, or he blasted forth with piercing falsetto 
cries that served as exclamation points for more exuberant soul workouts. He 
consistently held and shaped sustained notes more firmly than you'd think 
possible for a graying icon. 
</P>
<P>
An unbalanced sound mix left things a bit unfocused at the start, and an 
abbreviated, if frisky, "Busted" was cause for some slight concern early on, 
especially when Charles swung immediately into "Georgia On My Mind." But the 
loving, unpredictable rendition he gave that chestnut erased any fear that this 
was going to be a short hour of casually tossed-off hits. For the rest of the 
show, Charles made every moment seem uncharted and full of invention -- whether 
on an achingly lovely ballad like "She Knows," a driving soul shot featuring 
the five Raelettes doing a strong impression of Aretha and the Sweet 
Inspirations, or a friendly, gospel-ized Charles takeover of a standard like 
"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning." 
</P>
<P>
The show would have been a delight if Charles had played it with his hands tied 
behind his back. The fact that he frolicked just as freely with his fingers 
doubled the delight. No purist, Charles has discovered digital technology with 
a vengeance. He made liberal use of the electronic keyboard colorations at his 
disposal, changing timbres, bending notes, making his piano sound like a 
distorted blues guitar or a ringing vibraphone or even a synthesized bass -- 
and doing it all in a way that was light, playful and fully in sync with his 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Charles' band had a marvelous set too. It's hard to imagine a horn section -- 
13 members strong -- playing with a better blend of magnificent clout and 
sensitive control than Charles' crew. Typically, Charles uses his Orange County 
club dates at the Coach House or the Crazy Horse Steak House to get the kinks 
out of his ensemble before a major tour, and he isn't loath to chastise players 
for their imperfections right on the bandstand. This time, there was nothing 
for him to do but whoop with delight at the sound around him and holler yet 
another "Oh, yeah." The same went for a crowd that made a good investment, even 
at premium prices.

   Ray Charles meet Charles Wadsworth, Charles
Wadsworth meet Ray Charles. That may be the scenario one Friday
night in May when these two accomplished pianists meet backstage at
the New York City Ballet.
   It is a bit of stage irony that these two remarkable musicians
were both born in Georgia about a year apart, both trod the boards
for 40 years or more fashioning stellar careers, and yet their
paths never crossed. Until now.
   In the same week in May, Ray Charles and Charles Wadsworth will
be featured in ``Live from Lincoln Center'' broadcasts on PBS,
playing two separate programs of music in their separate,
inimitable styles.
   Ray Charles, at home in Los Angeles, plans to turn on TV today
(May 7), at 5 p.m. (EDT) for a two-hour concert by the Chamber
Music Society of Lincoln Center. Charles Wadsworth will play and
make a speech ``summing up 20 years of incredibly intense, hard,
much-loved work.''
   Wadsworth has been artistic director of the society since its
beginning and has seen it grow from 16 concerts a season to 90. He
decided to retire at the end of this season, when the society was
20 and he would be turning 60.
   Wadsworth plans to take his wife to a birthday dinner next
Friday, and then to the New York State Theater to see three ballets
by the New York City Ballet. The middle, 50-minute one, at 9 p.m.
(EDT), will be televised. It will have Ray Charles on stage with
the dancers, playing piano and singing his songs. ``A Fool for
You,'' a 1955 Ray Charles composition, is also the title of the
ballet.
   Then Charles Wadsworth may go backstage to meet Ray Charles.
   Ray Charles, who was born in Albany, Ga., on Sept. 23, 1930,
studied classical music at the State School for the Blind in St.
Augustine, Ga., long before he became famous for his exhilarating
combination of secularized gospel, blues and pop music.
   Charles Wadsworth, born in Newman, Ga., on May 21, 1929, was
first primarily a piano accompanist. He has been working in
classical chamber music since Gian Carlo Menotti had him set up
daily chamber concerts at the Spoleto Festival in Italy in 1960.
   Wadsworth has written some pop ballads and intends to use time
afforded by retirement to write some more, as well as play the
piano more often and possibly do something on cable TV.
   For the ballet, Ray Charles says, ``Choreographer Peter Martins
was the cat who picked some of my early recordings. I had to go
back and learn the songs the way I did them at that time. They took
the records and that's what they learned the steps to. I play some
of those songs today but I play them so different.''
   Charles was happy with the songs that were chosen. ``I've been
very fortunate in my recording career,'' he says. ``I never was put
in a position to record anything I didn't like. Record companies
always said, `Hey, man, whatever you record, you record.'''
   The first performance of ``A Fool for You'' was last spring,
during the New York City Ballet's American Music Festival. Charles,
who never had provided a live ballet score before, didn't get
carried away and stretch out on any of the numbers. ``I'm not going
to do something to goof them up,'' he says.
   On stage with him on Friday, as they were for last year's
premiere, will be his backup singers, the Raeletts, and most of the
members of his first band. ``They wanted it as close to the same
sound as possible,'' he says. ``I went out and found the cats. They
all have their own things going now. They come in and do this just
for me, which I think is sweet.''
   Today's chamber music concert will include Poulenc's ``Sextet
for Piano and Winds,'' one of pianist Wadsworth's favorites. ``I've
been playing that 30 years now,'' he says. ``It's a very cheerful,
sensuous, warm piece. It seemed the ideal thing for me to play in
this final concert.''
   Asked what he considers the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln
Center's greatest achievement, Wadsworth replies, ``I think it has
been to focus people all around the country on the incredible
wealth of chamber music repertoire and the excitement that can be
generated by having the very greatest virtuoso artists perform this
music together.
   ``There are so many more chamber music events around the country
than we ever dreamed would be happening when we started this
thing.''
   Of the two, Ray Charles was first on television, in Seattle in
1948. ``My trio had this 15-minute radio show every week,'' he
recalls. ``They came in and filmed part of it. We didn't do
anything great on it but I was playing my music and getting it
exposed. I was extremely excited; I was beside myself. TV wasn't
big then. Bars had one TV and people would meet up there and
watch.''
   These days, Charles turns down more TV than he accepts. He
prefers to tour with a band and the Raeletts and to perform with
orchestras in symphonic arrangements of his music.
   Thinking about hearing Charles perform for ballet, Wadsworth
says, ``I've always had the greatest admiration for my fellow
Georgian. I can't wait.''
   On the other side, Charles says that he likes chamber music
``when it is played right. I have to tell you I like any kind of
music I can sit down and listen to and it makes sense.''

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: TOP TROMBONIST ANDERSON BRINGS QUARTET 
TO ELARIO'S

Serious jazz buffs know about Ray Anderson, but a casual listener might well 
ask "Ray who?" 
</P>
<P>
Anderson finds himself in the role of the underdog, trying build a career as a 
leader around the trombone, an instrument that hasn't always fared well in a 
leadership role. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Anderson, who plays Elario's Monday and Tuesday nights, is forging ahead. 
He has been voted best trombonist in the Downbeat Critics Poll for the last 
four years. His newest album, "What Because," includes pianist John Hicks, whom 
many believe to be one of the underrated greats. Anderson is quick enough and 
imaginative enough to carry a solo as well as a trumpet or sax player. He sings 
in a raspy growl reminiscent of Louis Armstrong and has played or recorded with 
Carla Bley, Charlie Haden, John Scofield, Anthony Braxton and Henry Threadgill. 
And for years, Anderson made his living in funk-band horn sections and recorded 
an album with a group called the Slickaphonics. 
</P>
<P>
At Elario's, Anderson will be joined by pianist Amina Claudine Myers, who also 
worked with Haden, plus bassist Mark Helias and drummer Dion Parson. There will 
be two shows nightly, at 8:30 and 10:30. 
</P>
<P>
Pianist-keyboard man David Benoit proved his musical prowess once and for all 
with last year's "Waiting for Spring." On that album, he departed from his 
usual dreamy, electric light jazz for some stirring acoustic jazz. Benoit's 
next album will mark a return to the electric mode. Benoit, a staple of light 
jazz radio, plays Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay this Sunday at 7 and 9. 
</P>
<P>
Del Mar guitarist Peter Sprague is everywhere this week. Today, he plays the 
San Diego Museum of Art's "Jazz After Work" series at 4:30 on the steps of the 
museum, in Balboa Park. Vocalist Coral Thuet will be featured on several 
Brazilian tunes by such musicians as Antonio Carlos Jobim, Milton Nascimento, 
Djavan and Joao Bosco. Tonight, Sprague's trio plays the Full Moon Cafe in 
Encinitas; Friday night, the city of Carlsbad's TGIF Jazz series at Stage Coach 
Park (3420 Camino de los Coches); and Saturday night, Diego's Loft in Pacific 
Beach, above Diego's Mexican restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the trio's sets include several Brazilian-flavored songs written by 
guitarist Pat Metheny, with whom a young Sprague studied in Boston during the 
late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"They have such strong melodies, they can be done in a lot of contexts," 
Sprague said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the business side of his career is on a new path. He recently signed 
with a new manager, Dick Deutsch, who formerly managed the late guitarist Emily 
Remler. Deutsch's first task will be to shop around Sprague's demo tape in 
search of an album deal. 
</P>
<P>
Top local pianist Randy Porter, who works regularly with singer Diane Schuur 
and behind several top players at Elario's, is moving to Oregon in September. 
</P>
<P>
Porter, wife Cindy and month-old daughter Rachel Emily will live in a suburb of 
Portland, which Porter thinks might be a great place to raise a family. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people wonder why, when things seem to be going so well here, I would 
want to move up there," Porter said. "It's kind of a personal thing, for 
creative growth I want to achieve, which even takes priority over playing with 
other people. Being in a natural environment for me is more stimulating. Some 
people thrive around cement, but I like being around trees. 
</P>
<P>
Porter hopes to maintain his association with the young San Diego 
straight-ahead jazz band Common Ground, which also includes Steve Feierabend, 
Dave Marr and Tim McMahon. He hopes to return to Southern California often to 
play with Schuur and others. Porter plays the San Diego Museum of Art's "Jazz 
After Work" series with saxophonist Charles McPherson Aug. 16 at 4:30. He 
appears with Schuur Aug. 9 at The Strand in Redondo Beach; Aug. 10 at 
Humphrey's in San Diego; and Aug. 11 at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
During the Korean War years, Joe Franc played French horn with the 93rd Army 
Band, attached to the AAA (Anti-Aircraft Artillery) branch of the Army. Among 
his band mates: San Diegans Rod Cradit, Tony Higgins and John Pecoraro. 
</P>
<P>
The band played military marches, but also swing jazz for USO dances. Franc is 
putting together an Oct. 18 band reunion. If you were in the band or know 
someone who was, give him a call at 279-0844. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego guitarist Hank Easton hasn't been signed by a major label yet, but 
his self-produced CD, "San Diego Sunset," has won favor from local jazz writers 
(not just this one) and airplay on KIFM. 
</P>
<P>
Easton jammed with jazz celebrity Bob James two weeks ago at the San Diego 
Hilton. James was in town for a vacation, and Easton was sitting in with San 
Diego band Real to Reel. James joined the group for a version of his theme from 
the television show "Taxi." 
</P>
<P>
Easton and his band play tonight from 6 to 11 at the Mission Bay Hilton and 
Saturday from 5:30 to 7:30 at the Coronado Ferry Landing.

<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Singer, pianist, songwriter, arranger, bandleader, actor, dancer,
raconteur, Harry Connick Jr., who holds the Orpheum stage through Sunday, is a
wonder, although you have to wonder at the reaction he gets. This is not a
teen-age crowd. Haven't they ever heard an actual singer before? A jazz
orchestra in full cry? A piano player?;   Apparently not. Harry Connick Jr.
can do no wrong for them, although a dispassionate observer would have said
his show Tuesday night contained far too much chatter, far too many lame
jokes, far too much fooling around with the band and not nearly enough good
singing and playing.;   (After "It's All Right With Me" and the intro to
"Don't Get Around Much Any More," his second tune, Connick never went near the
piano except to illustrate a joke, until the last number, when he played
briefly. His encore, alone on stage, was about two minutes of boogie-woogie
piano. He does that well, too.);   They've been calling Connick "the young
Sinatra," but that's silly. Unlike Sinatra, who put the dramatic needs of the
lyric above mere time, Connick is more likely to punch a word here or there
for purely musical reasons. His time is perfect. Vocally, the singer he most
resembles is Bobby Darin.;   He's not a great singer, but he's a very good one
who has the inestimable advantage of having the spotlight on him just now, and
the people who weren't paying any attention to this kind of music when they
were Connick's age (24 as of Wednesday) are paying attention now.;   He's the
latest in a long and honorable line of singer-musicians that includes Matt
Dennis, Buddy Greco, Frank D'Rone and, of course, Nat Cole. You have to range
as high as Mel Torme and Ray Charles to find another singer of Connick's
caliber who also writes big-band arrangements and plays well, too. Connick's
not in their league as a singer, or as a songwriter for that matter, but he
plays better piano than Torme and has a better band than Charles. That's
pretty heavyweight company.;   As an arranger, he has a genius for voicing
brasses, and, as a bandleader, despite his joking-with-the-band shtick, he
demands and gets discipline. His charts can be boorish -- jazz musicians
chanting vocal responses went out with "Pennsylvania 6-5000," didn't it? --
but he is capable of genuine musical wit, noodling "If I Had You" as an intro
to "Don't Get Around Much Any More" and inserting about two bars of "Wildwood
Flower" into "It's All Right With Me.";   He has a nice sense of his own
musical heritage, too. Lead trumpeter Leroy Jones, who contributed several
tight, biting solos, tossed a reference to "Pop Goes the Weasel" into his solo
on "It Had to Be You," causing Connick to growl, "Stop it!" That's a big-band
joke: Thad Jones, then playing lead trumpet for Basie, used "Pop Goes the
Weasel" in his solo on "April in Paris.";   Connick's show at the Orpheum
consists of 15 tunes, counting "Misty," an alto solo for musical director Brad
Leali, but not counting the star's brief encore. It was a nice mix of
standards and originals, including four from his new album, "Blue Light, Red
Light" (due out in two weeks) and his hit "We Are in Love.";   For me, the
best part of the show was "All of Me," played in a slow, steady, almost
ominous 4/4 with Jones and trombonist Lucien Barbarin playing behind him.
Barbarin's solo, using a plunger mute, was spare and elegant, while Jones,
muting with his hand, was on the attack as usual.;   Connick listens happily
when his people are playing. You can sense the mutual respect. "Do I have the
best band in the world, or what?" he cried when "All of Me" ended. Could be.; 
 When he talks too much, when he clowns with the band or has them clown on
their own, when he takes over the drum kit so Powell can dance, when he dances
himself -- he's very graceful, and moves with a kind of pleasing eccentricity,
like Ray Bolger -- when he works the crowd, kidding with latecomers, he's like
a kid with a new toy: all of it, including us. He's having a ball playing with
it, and the audience responds to Connick's pleasure and energy.;   But the
clowning keeps his show from having any pace. It doesn't build, and the last
number, "Just Kiss Me" (from the new album) seems merely more of the same,
only faster and louder.; Harry Connick Jr.; And the Harry Connick Jr.

BLUEGRASS AND WESTERN SWING: TWO BANDS DOING THEIR THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Along with the grit that got washed out of country music when it was watered 
down by "crossover appeal" in the '70s, country's longtime emphasis on 
instrumental prowess also seemed to get lost in the flood. Outside of Ricky 
Scaggs, the indomitable Merle Haggard and a handful of others, the notion that 
axes can speak louder than words has largely gone ignored in these past two 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
It figures then that two of the best instrumental acts in country during that 
time, New Grass Revival and Asleep at the Wheel, have existed only at the 
fringes of the country-music community. But, if the two bands' clamorously 
received early show Monday at the Crazy Horse Steak House in Santa Ana was any 
indication, it's high time they came in from the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Since it was formed by frontman-singer-guitarist Ray Benson in the early '70s, 
Asleep at the Wheel has been rivaled only by Haggard in keeping alive the brand 
of music known as Western swing, a hybrid of country and jazz originated by Bob 
Wills and His Texas Playboys in the '30s. It's a music well worth saving, a 
true piece of America, with both hard times and an expansive view of the future 
shaping its musical moods. And, true to its title, it most certainly swings. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years Benson has gone through well over 60 band mates (an attrition 
due more, perhaps, to the band's 300-days-a-year touring schedule than Benson's 
reputedly volatile nature). While his present seven-piece lineup didn't burn 
quite as hot as it did in the days when steel guitar monster Lucky Oceans was 
in the band, it was still a remarkably tight outfit. And, on stage, the lanky 
Benson is nothing but pure entertainer, with an engaging-if-limited voice, some 
tremendous chops on the guitar and a flair for showmanship that had him 
juggling potatoes and catching them on his hat brim by show's end. 
</P>
<P>
The material ranged from the rock classics "Route 66" and "Hot Rod Lincoln" to 
Louis Jordan's R&amp;B novelty "Ain't Nobody Here but Us Chickens" to the 
boogie-woogie "The House of Blue Lights." Throughout, the hot ensemble playing 
and solo flashes recalled Wills' band, which was directly represented by "San 
Antonio Rose," "Roly Poly," and "Take Me Back to Tulsa." 
</P>
<P>
While the band has strong soloists on piano, sax and fiddle, the most 
consistently inventive playing came from steel player John Ely, particularly on 
a harmonic-studded solo on "Cotton Patch Rag." Benson's best moment came when 
he strapped on an acoustic guitar for a brief, but remarkably detailed, solo 
version of Robert Wilkins' country blues "Prodigal Son." 
</P>
<P>
Of the two bands, Asleep at the Wheel had the easier row to hoe. While the 
band's set relied almost entirely on Wills' proven style and a songbook of 
standards, New Grass Revival applied a challenging and unique reworking of 
bluegrass playing to original material and obscure covers. Even longtime fans 
couldn't count on familiarity, as much of the set came from the forthcoming 
"Friday Night in America" album. 
</P>
<P>
Quartet members banjoist Bela Fleck, guitarist Pat Flynn and mandolin-fiddle 
player Sam Bush are among the most respected of "musicians' musicians" on their 
respective instruments, while bassist John Cowan brings a strong high-tenor 
voice to their songs. Though their opening spot on the bill required them to 
compress their abilities into a far-too-short eight-song set, even one song 
would have conveyed how special the band is. 
</P>
<P>
Working from a thorough grounding in bluegrass, Fleck, Bush and Flynn propelled 
the picking in new directions, most notably on the encore instrumental "Metric 
Lips," incorporating Irish and Eastern European folk influences into its 
staggered rhythms and complex movements. Though more orthodox, "Can't Stop Now" 
was no less impressive, with breakneck, jazz and blues-inflected solos 
rampaging seamlessly from instrument to instrument.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: AVANT-GARDE WILL FIND ITS PLACE IN THE 
SUN AT ELARIO'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a radical departure from the status quo, Elario's will play host to a 
one-night visit by jazz space cadet Sun Ra and his 15-piece Arkestra next 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The appearance by an avant-garde jazz artist is the first shake-up by San Diego 
Jazz Festival founder Rob Hagey since he took over as talent coordinator last 
month, replacing Steve Satkowski. 
</P>
<P>
It was Hagey who first brought Sun Ra to San Diego, for a sold-out show at the 
Old Globe Theatre's Festival Stage in 1980. This time around, Ra will tame his 
act in deference to the slightly more conservative surroundings, playing a 
tribute to Big Band leaders Duke Ellington and Fletcher Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Hagey acknowledges that the progressive show is an experiment; he said he needs 
to sell 150 tickets between the two shows to break even. Shows are at 8:30 and 
10:30. 
</P>
<P>
Ra, whose real name is Herman (Sonny) Blount, was weaned on traditional jazz in 
Chicago, played with Henderson's band, and arranged Big Band charts for 
Henderson and Benny Goodman. He started his Arkestra in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
Today his band's collective improvising isn't so shocking, but it turned a few 
heads in the early days as probably the first Big Band to depart from 
traditional structures. 
</P>
<P>
There is some degree of mystery surrounding Mr. Ra, if we can call him that. He 
claims to have arrived from Saturn, and has no legal birth certificate. He is 
purported to be in his late 70s, and lives in Philadelphia. The Arkestra's most 
recent album is last year's "Blue Delight." 
</P>
<P>
Rusefest '90, which brought a rare dose of experimental jazz to town this 
spring, including a performance by the Bay Area-based Rova Saxophone Quartet, 
closes Friday night with a concert by pianist Joe Garrison with the Ruse Brass 
Ensemble and featured soloists. 
</P>
<P>
The group will dish up new music by Garrison, who has titled this suite "My 
Brothers, My Sisters." 
</P>
<P>
"My point of departure was, I'm really tired of musicians using music as a way 
to justify their lives," Garrison said. 'I want to take care of my life. I want 
my life to work. It used to be enough to worship music. A lot of musicians do 
that, and they hurt a lot of people in the process. They hurt their families; 
they don't care enough about other people; they put music above everything. I'm 
trying to join the human race, put people first. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I was thinking about while I wrote. I also noticed I was letting 
go of my iron grip on the compositions and thinking of the strength of the 
players. Some of these pieces will only work because of the specific 
musicians." 
</P>
<P>
Among Garrison's band mates for this date will be trombonists Louis Watkins, 
Will Martin and Jeff Bernard and trumpeters Derrick Cannon and Bill Caballero. 
Featured soloists will include Frank Lamarca on tenor sax, David Millard on 
soprano, Turiya on bass clarinet and flute, plus Caballero. Several of the 
players, including Garrison, are also members of Turiya's Immediate Freedom 
Band. 
</P>
<P>
Garrison said the music is designed specifically for this Big Band lineup, but 
with a more abstract approach than is typical of Big Band charts. Some of the 
music is quite formal in structure, some virtually free-form, according to 
Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
You'll hear traces of Latin in the music, but nothing like what Garrison and 
the Immediate Freedom Band produce; this band doesn't have a percussion 
section. 
</P>
<P>
The music starts at 8 p.m. in the San Diego City College Theatre on C Street 
between 13th and 15th streets. 
</P>
<P>
Keyboard player and studio wiz Spencer Nilsen, whose debut album, "Architects 
of Change," enjoyed moderate success last year on light jazz and new age radio 
stations, is ready to perform live for the first time. Nilsen will mix tunes 
from the album with new compositions next Wednesday night in the Catamaran's 
Cannibal Bar in Mission Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Nilsen said his post-album compositions are heading in a new direction. In 
addition to playing keyboards, he's been singing, and he hopes to reach a 
broader audience with a sound he calls "global pop," influenced by artists such 
as Sting and Peter Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the live act is trumpeter and wind synthesizer player Mitch Manker, 
who has backed Ray Charles. Manker uses the synthesizer to duplicate lead 
melodies produced on Nilsen's album by a variety of instruments, including 
violin. Rounding out the group are Brad Kaiser on drums, Dave Curtis on bass 
guitar and former Flight 7 guitarist Mark Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
For next Wednesday's performance, Nilsen has sculpted a tight 90-minute show 
that includes new material and seven songs from his album. He'll play it twice, 
at 8 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Sunday's show at UC San Diego featuring Cecil Lytle and Sonny Rollins 
has been canceled. . . . Next Tuesday, trombonist Rocky Cole puts a sextet 
through its paces for KSDS-FM's (88.3) "Jazz Live" concert at the City College 
Theatre, with a live broadcast on the station. . . . Trumpeter Bill Caballero 
unveiled his new seven-piece tropical and Latin band, Quien Sabe, last Friday 
night at a downtown dance studio. Caballero is a Texas transplant whose recent 
San Diego work has included frequent appearances with Turiya and her Immediate 
Freedom Band. . . . Today and tomorrow, pianist Mike Wofford holds down the 
lunchtime solo piano at Cafe Lautrec in La Jolla from noon to 3:30. Wofford 
also plays the new Hyatt Regency in La Jolla from 5 to 7:30 p.m. Monday. . . . 
Friday and Saturday nights, flutist Lori Bell and pianist Dave Mackay hit the 
Horton Grand Hotel's Palace Bar downtown. . . . With the success of his first 
two "Innovation in Modern Music" concerts at Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach, 
jazz promoter Bob Geib hopes to continue the jazz revival at the club with such 
names as trombonist Mike Fahn, Freddie Hubbard sideman Bob Sheppard, former 
Count Basie trumpeter Oscar Brashear, Harold Land Jr. and Key Akagi, a 
keyboardist who's worked with Miles Davis. . . . Art Johnson, master of 
seven-string jazz guitar, plays Words &amp; Music Bookstore in Hillcrest this 
Sunday at 3 p.m., with Gary Scott on flute and sax and Jim Plank on drums.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: LEGENDARY, BUT STILL ACTIVE, BENNY 
CARTER TO PLAY ELARIO'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Alto sax man Benny Carter didn't shred jazz traditions to establish new forms 
like Charlie Parker did. Instead, Carter, whose roots are in the days of Big 
Band swing, built a career around his sophisticated composing and arranging 
skills and a subtle sound that emphasizes warm, melodic ideas above all else. 
</P>
<P>
At 83, Carter continues to turn out the polished, swinging improvisations and 
catchy, original songs that have been his trademark since he launched his 
career in Big Bands during the 1920s. In the '30s, he emerged as a leader, and 
has since fronted numerous Big Bands and small groups. 
</P>
<P>
Proof of his enduring finesse is this year's "My Man Benny, My Man Phil," an 
album with fellow alto man Phil Woods. Including six of Carter's own tunes, the 
session captures Carter in fine form, his bright, full sound as strong as ever. 
</P>
<P>
Carter plays Elario's Friday through Sunday in a quartet with Larry Nash on 
piano, Larry Gales on bass and Sherman Ferguson on drums. Show times are 9 and 
10:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
As a crack studio musician, guitarist Tommy Tedesco shows up for work hauling a 
suitcase loaded with string instruments. For example, he's spending the first 
part of this week adding mandolin and guitar to the sound track for the movie, 
"The Godfather Part III." But this Friday and Saturday nights at All That Jazz 
in Rancho Bernardo, Tedesco, the closet be-bopper, will be free to play 
whatever he wants. Sets each night are at 8, 9:15 and 10:30 at the new club 
adjacent to the Wall Street Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
The format will be something Tedesco calls "Confessions of a Studio Player." In 
between songs, he regales audiences with stories of some of the things he has 
seen and done during more than 30 years of studio work. Tedesco will 
concentrate on acoustic and electric guitars, accompanied by local bassist Bob 
Magnusson, but he also plans to hoist a mandolin to show how well it can work 
for jazz. 
</P>
<P>
The material will include several of his own tunes, many of them built around 
Brazilian rhythms. Tedesco has played on hundreds of albums, either under his 
own name or behind musicians as diverse as the Beach Boys, Linda Ronstadt, Ray 
Charles, Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. His most recent album was last year's 
"Hollywood Gypsy." Tedesco's credits include soundtracks for the television 
programs "MASH," "Ozzie and Harriet," "Gilligan's Island," "My Three Sons" and 
"Charlie's Angels" on television, and for movies including "Bonnie &amp; 
Clyde," "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" and "The French Connection." 
</P>
<P>
Pianist Cecelia Coleman has been stirring things up in L.A., getting solid 
reviews and winning this year's Shelley Manne Memorial New Talent Award from 
the Los Angeles Jazz Society. Coleman, 28, plays the Horton Grand Hotel 
downtown Saturday night at 8:30. She hasn't recorded an album of her own, but 
she plays on a new one from saxophonist Ben Clatworthy. Schooled by pianists 
Charlie Shoemake and Joanne Grauer, Coleman says her roots are "in be-bop, but 
more of the straight-ahead kind, an Art Blakey kind of thing." She counts 
pianists Red Garland, Bud Powell and Mulgrew Miller as influences. 
</P>
<P>
In search of a recording contract, Coleman plans to record a demo tape of 
original music later this year. She may include a few of her own songs this 
weekend, teaming with locals Gunnar Biggs on bass and Holly Hofmann on flute. 
Incidentally, Hofmann's new album, "Further Adventures," with Mike Wofford, Bob 
Magnusson and Sherman Ferguson, is finally in music stores following an August 
release. Pianist Wofford wrote the title cut. Bassist Magnusson contributed 
"Jillian's Waltz" in honor of his daughter, and other tunes are by Art Pepper, 
Thelonious Monk and Djavan. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Saxman Spike Robinson makes his first appearances at Elario's Wednesday 
and Thursday nights at 8:30 and 10:30. Robinson is back to health after two 
bouts of meningitis last year, which left him with a three-month gap in his 
memory and a slight limp. Based in Denver, Robinson lives several months a year 
in England. A new album is his second with trumpeter Harry (Sweets) Edison. San 
Diego-based guitarist Mundell Lowe returns from a tour of England on Thursday, 
and may show up to jam with Robinson Thursday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Basia fans who still have tickets for the singer's canceled July show in San 
Diego can exchange them to hear her next Monday night at 8 at the Civic Theatre 
downtown. With music that layers her smooth, sexy vocals over Brazilian 
rhythms, the singer has captured a wide light jazz and pop audience. Her first 
album, the 1988 "Time and Tide," topped Billboard's Contemporary Jazz chart for 
eight weeks and went platinum (1 million sales). "London Warsaw New York," 
released earlier this year, quickly went gold (500,000) and is close to 
platinum, according to a publicist. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Singer Peggy Lee has canceled her Nov. 17 appearance at the Civic Theatre due 
to exhaustion. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Inspired by Time magazine's story last month on young players keeping 
traditional jazz alive, San Diego drummer Chuck McPherson is into 
straight-ahead jazz more than ever with his new Modern Jazz Disciples, 
featuring Alan Eicher on piano, Dave Marr on bass and Dale Fielder on sax. The 
group plays Friday nights at 8 through November at Barnett's Grand Cafe at the 
Embassy Suites Hotel downtown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Friday night at 8:30 at the Horton Grand Hotel downtown, pianist Rick Helzer, 
who teaches jazz at San Diego State University, teams up with flutist Holly 
Hofmann and bassist Gunnar Biggs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Next Wednesday night at 8, Fattburger plays the Cannibal Bar at the Catamaran 
Resort Hotel in Pacific Beach. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Part 2 of a seven-part radio series on Miles Davis airs on KSDS-FM (88.3) at 11 
a.m. Thursday. This episode covers "The Early '50s: Drugs and Early Fame," with 
comments from Gerry Mulligan, Max Roach, Sonny Rollins, Art Farmer and Art 
Taylor. The sound quality is excellent, and interviews often include 
spontaneous musical demonstrations. Part 3 airs at 8 p.m. Sunday and repeats at 
11 a.m. on Thanksgiving.

JAZZ: NORMAN GRANZ AND THE PABLO JAZZ JAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How and when can a single three-day festival yield 15 compact discs and 12 
hours of superior music? When the talent is supplied and the records are 
produced by Norman Granz. 
</P>
<P>
The entire Granz family of Pablo Records jazz giants was on hand during a 
weekend in Montreux, Switzerland, in July of 1977. 
</P>
<P>
The CD versions include several additional tracks that were not on the original 
LPs. 
</P>
<P>
The joyous informality of the occasion led to many overlaps of personnel. Oscar 
Peterson is heard as leader or sideman on six records, Ray Brown on five, Niels 
Pedersen and Lockjaw Davis and Clark Terry on four, etc. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps it was something in the mountain air, or just the mutual good vibes 
among mature and dedicated musicians; whatever the cause, the results varied 
from acceptable to exceptional -- more often the latter, as the ratings will 
reveal. 
</P>
<P>
OSCAR PETERSON AND THE BASSISTS Pablo Live OJCCD 383-2 ***** 
</P>
<P>
OSCAR PETERSON JAM OJCCD 378-2 **** 
</P>
<P>
PABLO ALL STARS JAM with OSCAR PETERSON, MILT JACKSON, CLARK TERRY et al OJCCD 
380-2 **** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
MILT JACKSON/RAY BROWN with CLARK TERRY et al JCCD 375-2 **** 
</P>
<P>
Peterson's collaboration with the world's greatest bass players, Brown and 
Denmark's Pedersen, was a summit meeting without precedent. Except for brief 
passages on a blues, the bassists do not play together, but a play-by-play 
rundown makes identification easy. Peterson was doubly inspired; Brown and 
Pedersen, each in his own way, are formidable both as soloists and rhythm 
players. 
</P>
<P>
The Peterson Jam, with Gillespie and Terry on trumpet and Davis on tenor, rises 
above its program (the tunes are predictable) to provide inspired moments. 
Terry has the first solo on "Just in Time" and Gillespie on "Bye Bye Blues." 
</P>
<P>
The Pablo Jam is notable for the inclusion of a rarely heard soloist, tenor 
saxophonist Ronnie Scott (better known as owner of London's famous jazz club), 
who suggests early John Coltrane. Milt Jackson and Joe Pass are airborne 
throughout "Samba de Orfeu," as is Peterson in "Pennies From Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
Monty Alexander replaces Peterson on the Jackson/Brown jam, notable for a 
stealthy minor Brown blues called "Slippery." Inconsequentially diverting is a 
blues vocal by Jackson and Terry. 
</P>
<P>
ELLA FITZGERALD with TOMMY FLANAGAN TRIO OJCCD 376-2 **** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
TOMMY FLANAGAN TRIO OJCCD 372-2 **** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
Ella cuts a swath from "My Man" (introduced by Mistinguett in 1920) to Paul 
Williams and Stevie Wonder. Her indigo finals to "I Ain't Got Nothing but the 
Blues" is reward enough in itself. Flanagan, the ideal accompanist, is also the 
soigne soloist, dealing elegantly with Gillespie, Parker, Ellington and Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
COUNT BASIE BIG BAND OJCCD 377-2 ***** 
</P>
<P>
MONTREUX JAM SESSIONS with BASIE, PETERSON, GILLESPIE, JACKSON, et al *** 
</P>
<P>
Just how much Basie's piano meant to his band is vividly displayed, along with 
a personnel only four of whose members are still in the orchestra (the maestro 
and five others have died). Originals by Sam Nestico, Neal Hefti and Quincy 
Jones are as timelessly compelling as big band jazz can be. "Basie Jam" has a 
few surprises: trumpeter Roy Eldridge using a Ben Webster "Cotton Tail" solo; 
he also sings the blues. Superb tenor by Zoot Sims. "Montreux Jam" is a pickup 
album of leftover tracks by groups heard on four of the other CDs. Three 
consecutive cuts (running over a half hour) are based on the blues. Un peu 
trop, n'est-ce pas? 
</P>
<P>
DIZZY GILLESPIE JAM OJCCD 381-2 *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
ROY ELDRIDGE 4 OJCCD 373-2 **** 
</P>
<P>
Three generations of trumpets are heard: Gillespie, 59, and Jon Faddis, 23, on 
the first; Eldridge, then 66, and the link between Armstrong and Gillespie. As 
in several of these CDs, Granz neglected to give solo credits where there are 
instrumental duplications, but it's probably Dizzy muted and Faddis open on 
"Girl of My Dreams." The ballad medley "Once in a While" sounds like Dizzy, but 
Faddis applies his youthful power to "Here's That Rainy Day." 
</P>
<P>
The excitement, unique raspy tone and incredible tension of Eldridge are so 
well represented that for those unfamiliar with his work (he stopped playing 
after a 1980 stroke, and died this year), this may be a good place to start. 
</P>
<P>
BENNY CARTER 4 OJCCD 374-2 ***** 
</P>
<P>
EDDIE (LOCKJAW) DAVIS 4 OJCCD 384-2 ***** 
</P>
<P>
Carter's alto sax is a model of form and tonal beauty; as a bonus, he plays the 
first chorus of "Body and Soul" on trumpet with the same exquisite lyricism. 
Davis (1922-1986) had a tenor sax sound that was mordant, almost indignant; 
here he tears into some well-selected songs: "The Breeze and I," "I Wished on 
the Moon," "Angel Eyes." Flawless backup by Peterson, Brown and Jimmie Smith. 
</P>
<P>
JOE PASS OJCCD 382-2 ** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
RAY BRYANT OJCCD 371-2 *** 
</P>
<P>
Pass must be judged by his own five-star standards. This was supposed to be an 
all-blues album, but after 20 minutes of blues, presumably bored, he switched 
to old songs. He has many solo sessions that came off far better. Ray Bryant, 
in a solo piano set, runs smoothly enough through standards, blues and the 
like, though his attempt at gospel ("If I Could Just Make It to Heaven") never 
reaches that Ray Charles plateau. (Note: Fantasy Records at 10th and Parker, 
Berkeley, CA 94710 is the distributor for Pablo, founded and formerly owned by 
Granz.)

JAZZ SO GOOD THAT IT SHOULD BE ON RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Someone get this group on tape, please. Saxophonist David Newman's five-night 
engagement at Elario's, including a rare appearance by local pianist Cecil 
Lytle, is producing better music than Newman's last album, a live date at the 
Village Vanguard in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
The choice of Lytle, music professor and provost of Third College at UC San 
Diego, to complete a quartet including Jim Plank on drums and Bob Magnusson on 
bass, was an inspired move by Rob Hagey, Elario's talent coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
Though Lytle knows Haydn as well as he does Monk and Coltrane, he also founded 
the university's revered gospel choir, so his soulful roots go way back. The 
pairing with Newman, a Charlie Parker disciple who took several detours into 
blues and R&amp;B, most notably with Ray Charles, results in some swinging 
chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
Newman plays several horns, but, because airlines make it difficult to bring 
the full array, he is only using tenor sax and flute. Thank the airlines: 
Listeners are gaining a rare opportunity for some extended exposure to Newman's 
fine flute work. 
</P>
<P>
The first set on opening night Wednesday began with the standard "Sweet 
Lorraine," on which Lytle's tastefully restrained playing helped the rhythm 
section find a simmering groove. Newman and Lytle both contributed solos, but 
the juices weren't yet flowing. 
</P>
<P>
Newman switched from sax to flute for "Delilah," an exotic number with a 
Brazilian beat that provided the perfect backdrop for his sensuous, tropical 
flute work. He has a special rapport with the instrument, standing with eyes 
closed to produce a stream of melodic ideas, shaped by subtle vibrato and 
bird-like trills. 
</P>
<P>
Fats Waller's "Ain't Misbehavin' " came next, and Dallas-born Newman showed why 
he's considered one of a handful of classic Texas sax men. His tone isn't as 
full as some, but it is buttery smooth, and he controls the pacing and dynamic 
range to attain the maximum emotional impact. 
</P>
<P>
Sparks really began to fly on Cedar Walton's "The Holy Land," as Newman 
loosened up and attacked his solos with more authority. This bluesy tune was 
the perfect setting for Newman's subtle improvisations, built around the 
tenor's mellow middle range. 
</P>
<P>
Lytle was especially strong here, making mini-meditations of repeated 
right-hand patterns, with plenty of space in between to set them off. At times, 
his playing has the laid-back swing and melodic inventiveness of vintage Herbie 
Hancock. 
</P>
<P>
For "Sunflower," Newman switched to flute again, turning out a breathtaking, 
extended solo, reminding you how rare it is to hear someone with a genuine 
mastery of this difficult instrument. He was back on sax to close the set with 
"Hard Times," the signature song from his 1959 debut album. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman and Company will appear nightly at Elario's through Sunday, with three 
shows tonight and Saturday night (9, 10:30 and midnight) and two on Sunday 
night (8:30 and 10:30).

FT  17 JUL 92 / Arts: Ray Charles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS hard to imagine a more emotionally intoxicating mix than soul and
suffrin' music spiked with sentimental gospel.
If it is sung by a handsome blind man, apparently for you alone, and whose
body language suggests he is deriving almost indecent pleasure from it, the
effect is evangelical.
Ray Charles provokes this devotional state in audiences as a matter of
routine, of course - alone at the piano or surrounded by strings and
celestial choirs.
But fronting a hefty brass and rhythm section and with the divine Raelettes
by his side is easily the most seductive setting for the man who can make
people from Sussex feel homesick for Georgia.
Charles takes a lot of stick, from people who should know better, about his
overt commerciality - the fact that he will advertise anything from charge
cards to soft drinks and is strict about his terms of contract.
Presumably they would prefer him to stick to the basket-weaving skills he
learnt in order to earn his pin-money when a penniless child in Florida.
Charles is the consummate professional who gives his fans exactly what they
crave, effortlessly. He sings the ones they will come again for ('Georgia',
'I can't stop loving you') and, from a huge repertoire, delights with
surprise covers ('Some enchanted evening' and Ruth Brown's 'Evr'y time it
rains'). Surely someone who gives so much pleasure should be allowed some
spin-offs.
The 61 year old voice is legendary, and in great shape, ranging from gruff,
rough velvet eructations through soothing C &amp; W tinged soul to pure blues
shouting.
The charisma of the man still harks back to monochrome footage of the
joyfully demented puppet in sunglasses, black patent shoes and grey DJ,
bent-double in pleasure and clutching at himself in excitement at the
audience's own rapture. (Part of Charles' magnetism is surely induced by an
anxiety that he might actually fall off his stool or somehow become parted
from his instrument.)
The monogrammed stands of the Ray Charles Orchestra, whose horn section is
staffed by implausibly big men, and the Raelettes, a rhapsody in black silk
and hairspray, complete the vision of soul and showbiz in perfect harmony.
The glitzy style of the show might appear even more superficial 30 years on,
but as an escape into sentimentality and 'sadness like a ball game on a
rainy day', it is precious trash.
The JVC Capital Radio Jazz Parade runs until July 18 at The Royal Festival
Hall

POP EYE: RAY CHARLES' LIFE TO GET THE HOLLYWOOD TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood has rock 'n' roll fever. 
</P>
<P>
Tinseltown has already made "The Buddy Holly Story," immortalized the King 
("This Is Elvis"), documented Chuck Berry's life ("Hail! Hail! Rock 'n' Roll") 
and rediscovered Richie Valens ("La Bamba"). This summer Orion Pictures will 
celebrate The Killer, with Dennis Quaid starring as Jerry Lee Lewis in "Great 
Balls of Fire." 
</P>
<P>
Who's next? A few hints: He's black. He's blind. He's a dynamic keyboardist and 
sensual singer who's had dozens of Top 40 hits. 
</P>
<P>
If you guessed Stevie Wonder, you're . . . wrong. 
</P>
<P>
It's none other than Ray Charles. The R&amp;B legend's life and music will be 
dramatized in "The Ray Charles Story," a just-announced film project being 
produced by rock managers Mark Hartley and Larry Fitzgerald. The film is the 
first project due from New Visions Pictures, a new production company headed by 
Taylor Hackford, who says his production slate will offer "at least one" music 
biography each year. (New Visions has acquired the rights to the life of Linda 
Creed, an influential '70s-era black songwriter.) 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted our first New Visions picture to really stand out," explained 
Hackford, a pop aficionado who produced "La Bamba" and directed "Hail! Hail! 
Rock 'n' Roll." "To me, Ray Charles is the greatest living figure in black 
music. His music is the meeting place of R&amp;B, rock, pop, jazz and country 
&amp; Western. He's a wonderfully complex character, a guy born into awful 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
"Ray struggled against unbelievable odds to become one of the major pop music 
icons of the last four decades. And to me, there's something inherently 
dramatic about the distance one travels in American society -- and Ray went all 
the way." 
</P>
<P>
Though Charles experienced many traumas along the way, including a period of 
heroin addiction, Hackford insists none of the rough spots will be smoothed 
over. "We're telling the whole story -- the tragedies and the triumphs. Ray 
doesn't want anything covered up." 
</P>
<P>
No writer or director has been chosen yet. But Quincy Jones -- an old Charles 
associate -- will be on board as a musical consultant. Hackford says he's 
looking for several unknown actors to play Charles at various stages of his 
career. As for the music, Hackford says it will probably be a combination of 
old material and re-recordings. "I'm certainly not going to re-record Ray's 
voice," he said. "No one sounds like him -- and no one ever will."

   Rock survivor Bonnie Raitt, who has toiled in
the vineyards of obscurity since the 1960s, won four Grammy awards
Wednesday, including album of the year, for her critically
acclaimed ``Nick of Time'' album.
   ``Wind Beneath My Wings,'' a ballad performed by two-time Grammy
winner Bette Midler, written Larry Henley and Jeff Silbar, won
record of the year and song of the year.
   ``This record's my first No. 1,'' gushed Midler to the audience
at the 32nd annual Grammy Awards show. ``I had to wait 17 years for
it. I hope I don't have to wait another 17.''
   ``I can only take so much of this,'' said Raitt, accepting her
fourth award, female pop vocalist. ``Wake me up when this is over.''
   Raitt also won female rock vocalist and shared the traditional
blues award with John Lee Hooker for ``I'm in the Mood'' on
Hooker's ``The Healer'' album.
   ``This means so much for the kind of music I do, and means those
of us who do rhythm and blues are going to get a chance again,''
said Raitt, 40, a four-time nominee.
   It was a night for survivors.
   Don Henley, formerly of the Eagles, won male rock vocalist for
his lyrical, melancholy ``The End of the Innocence.'' Henley,
co-wrote the album's title track with Bruce Hornsby. It was his
sixth career Grammy.
   ``Great. You sing a song, you win an award,'' a smiling Henley
said, accepting his award moments after performing the tune with
Hornsby.
   Blue-eyed soul balladeer Michael Bolton won best male pop
vocalist Grammy for ``How Am I Supposed to Live Without You.''
   Linda Ronstadt and Aaron Neville won pop duo honors for their
love duet ``Don't Know Much.'' Their producer, Peter Asher, who
began his career in the '60s as half of the Peter &amp; Gordon duo, was
named producer of the year.
   Bolton, who has been recording since the '70s, acknowledged his
``overnight success'' and thanked ``Ray Charles for blessing us all
and opening his mouth and singing.''
   Ronstadt thanked Neville's mother: ``She gave us not only Aaron,
but all the Neville Brothers and that's a pretty great musical
contribution.'' Neville had his first Top 10 hit in 1966 with
``Tell It Like It Is.'' Ronstadt first made the charts with the
Stone Poneys in ``Different Drum'' in 1968.
   The first televised Grammy award in the rap music category went
to Young MC for the single ``Bust a Move.'' Last year the miniature
gramophone trophy for rap was presented off-camera and some rappers
boycotted the ceremony.
   Lyle Lovett won male country vocal honors for ``Lyle Lovett and
His Large Band'' album; k.d. lang won country music's female
vocalist award for ``Absolute Torch and Twang.''
   Milli Vanilli, the Munich-based, dredlocked pop duo of Fab
Morvan and Rob Pilatus, won best new artist honors despite the
``hip-hopping radio fodder'' label given them by Rolling Stone
magazine.
   Slick rhythm and blues group Soul II Soul, legendary jazz artist
Miles Davis and jazz composer-arranger Dave Grusin were early
multiple winners in pre-broadcast ceremonies at the Shrine
Auditorium.
   Soul II Soul won the rhythm and blues group performance for the
single ``Back to Life,'' and the R&amp;B instrumental Grammy for the
``African Dance'' track from their ``Keep on Movin' '' album.
   Davis, already recipient of a lifetime achievement award from
the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, won best jazz
solo instrumental for ``Aura'' and won for the same album in the
big band jazz instrumental category.
   Grusin won three Grammys, for the background score of the movie
``The Fabulous Baker Boys,'' instrumental arrangement for the suite
from ``The Milagro Beanfield War'' and arrangement with vocals for
the ``My Funny Valentine'' track from ```Baker Boys.''
   The all-star collaboration of The Traveling Wilburys won the
rock vocal group Grammy, ending the Rolling Stones' latest bid for
a first Grammy.
   Brother and sister Michael and Janet Jackson won back-to-back
music video trophies. Michael won the short form Grammy for his
``Leave Me Alone'' and Janet claimed the long form category for
``Rhythm Nation 1814.''
   Bobby Brown won as best rhythm and blues male vocalist for his
``Every Little Step'' single; and female R&amp;B vocalist honors went
to Anita Baker for ``Giving You the Best That I've Got.''
   In the classical categories, Leonard Bernstein and the New York
Philharmonic won best orchestral performance for ``Mahler: Symphony
No. 3 in D Minor,'' and cellist Yo-Yo Ma won the instrumental
soloist award for ``Barber: Cello Concerto, Op. 22-Britten Symphony
for Cello and Orchestra, Op. 68.''
   The late Gilda Radner won the best spoken word Grammy for her
album ``It's Always Something.''
   ``After All This Time'' was named best country song, earning a
Grammy for singer-songwriter Rodney Crowell.
   Former Beatle Paul McCartney and Davis were chosen for the
Academy's Lifetime Achievement Award, and Dick Clark received a
Trustees Award, for achievements in the non-performing side of the
industry.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The Academy also gave two posthumous Lifetime Achievement Awards
to singer Nat ``King'' Cole and pianist Vladimir Horowitz.
   The achievement awards recognize performers who have made
contributions of outstanding artistic significance. Earlier
recipients have included the Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley, Bing
Crosby, Frank Sinatra and Arturo Toscanini.
   Grammy winners are chosen by the nearly 6,000 active members of
the academy, a non-profit organization formed to represent all
segments of the recording industry.
   The Grammy Awards began in 1958 with 28 categories, since
increased to nearly 80.

   Rick Astley is attracting more attention with
his first album than he probably expected to have in a lifetime.
   It has been 20 years since England sent America anything like
Astley _ when Joe Cocker arrived sounding a lot like Ray Charles.
   Astley's RCA album, ``Whenever You Need Somebody,'' and the
first rhythm and blues sounding single from it, ``Never Gonna Give
You Up,'' have shot up the best-selling charts in Europe and then
followed the same pattern in the United States where the LP went
gold.
   Besides getting a superhit with a first record, Astley excites
interest because he's quite a surprise. His voice is super-soulful,
deeply resonating, mature-sounding _ and he's a 21-year-old English
lad with a diffident air, chestnut hair and freckles.
   ``There's so much that gets crammed in,'' Astley said during an
interview at RCA headquarters.
   ``Private life is one thing I don't get, basically, any more.
Today we're a little rushed and that seems to be the norm these
days. I don't see my family any more. I don't mean to moan about
it. I knew I was letting myself in for this. I realize little
things in life become suddenly important and you miss them.
   ``It's very nice traveling to all these countries. All the same,
at the end of the day, all the RCA offices look the same.''
   Astley was born in Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, England _ not
far from Liverpool. Like many performers, he started as a teen-ager.
   ``I took up drums around 15,'' he said. ``I actually liked
drums. With friends, a guitarist and bass player, we got a band
together. One has gone to college now, studying computers. One is
married.
   ``It was a fun thing. The bassist was doing most of the writing.
We played anything that had three chords. We disbanded out of a
mutual agreement sort of thing.''
   Then Astley at 17 was asked by a band named FBI to be its
drummer. ``It was in the same little town,'' he said. ``Anybody who
can play an instrument; everybody seems to know about them. It was
an all-guitar band. Nobody could afford keyboards.
   ``I started to write most of the material about six months after
joining,'' he said, ``so I progressed on to be the singer as well.''
   The band's managers _ one of whom still manages Astley _ invited
Peter Waterman, who owns production and publishing companies, to a
performance. ``The band was still very young; I was one of the
oldest and I was 19,'' Astley said. ``He offered me a solo deal
which I ended up taking.'' FBI continues and Astley says they're
still friendly.
   ``I went to work for Pete for eight months or so. I was a tape
operator in a studio. It's computerized these days. I made tea a
few weeks until I saw how a studio works. Then I started recording
in December 1986, three songs. One was `Never Gonna Give You Up,'
the first single. I was writing like mad, doing demos weekends and
nights, learning whatever I could, getting to know everybody.''
   Later, Astley played guitar on one track of the album, ``No More
Looking for Love.''
   ``We did that at 2 or 3 in the morning,'' he said. ``Nobody was
around. The guy producing said, `You do it.' I always play on my
own demos. I said, `Fine. I can get by on this.'
   ``I'm not stupid enough not to know there are better musicians
than me. I'm not going to get into an ego trip when I play; time is
money in a studio. I'd like to do it when I get older.
   On ``Never Gonna Give You Up,'' Astley said a few notes are
high. ``It sounds as if it is low. I'm not saying that to be hip
and cool. I prefer to sing lower; it feels better and suits better.
   ``I think I've always had this sort of tone to my voice. A lot
of my favorite singers are black guys. In Britain, music by people
like Luther Vandross, James Ingram and Michael McDonald becomes
part of the Top 40. I like a white artist's voice with a soulful
approach.''
   PWL, which Waterman runs with Mike Stock and Matt Aitken, is
mainly known in the United States as the power behind Bananarama
and Samantha Fox.
   ``It is almost like a mini-Motown,'' Astley said. ``They
produce, write and arrange for so many people, some not big in
America but massive in England. They may have five singles they've
written and produced in the Top 20 on the British charts in one
week.
   ``They tend to have a very controlling role. Everybody says they
have a sound. I wondered what style they were going to use for me.
It was a little more musical than some of the stuff they'd done, a
return almost to the '70s, with string arrangements. I don't sound
like most of what they do.
   ``We've recorded `Ain't Too Proud to Beg' by the Temptations. I
sang it live in a few clubs in London. Everybody seems to think
it's the strongest thing I've done and that's my direction. It's
like rhythm, and me singing. It seems to show my vocal ability to
its best. I did it slower than the Temptations did it. My voice
suits slow; I think you can express yourself a little more.
   ``We were going to put it on the first album but didn't want to
put all the eggs in one basket,'' he said, ``and a lot of people
lately have released old Motown songs. I've got all these thoughts
buzzing around in my head. You've got only 10 songs to bring to
people.''
   The album includes five songs by Stock, Aitken and Waterman,
four by Astley and ``When I Fall in Love,'' the Nat ``King'' Cole
hit.
   ``I'm only 21,'' Astley said. ``As years go on, hopefully I'll
get into writing all of an album and producing some of it. It's
still early days for me.''

Everybody understands the blues 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ray Charles 
</P>
<P>
Ain't it the truth. If you've ever been down, sad, miserable or otherwise out 
of sorts, then you've had the blues. 
</P>
<P>
Getting rid of the blues can be as simple as listening to the blues, one of the 
oldest American song forms and musical styles around. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're feeling low, the blues picks you up like a spirit," says John Lee 
Hooker, the veteran guitarist/singer who won a 1989 Best Traditional Blues 
Grammy for his rendition, with Bonnie Raitt, of "I'm in the Mood." 
</P>
<P>
Blues lovers and other enthusiasts can get their fair share of a wide variety 
of the blues from Benson &amp; Hedges Blues, a weeklong festival of free and 
ticketed blues performances that begins tonight and roars on until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Blues greats Hooker, B.B. King, Dr. John and Stevie Ray Vaughan, along with 
many Los Angeles area musicians -- Doug MacLeod, Bernie Pearl and Jimmy and 
Jeannie Cheatham among them -- will take part in the festival, which will 
feature shows at area venues from Banger's in Tarzana to Marla's Memory Lane in 
Los Angeles. The event is highlighted by a concert by King, Hooker, Joe Cocker, 
John, Vaughan and Irma Thomas at the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa on 
Saturday. That concert is also a benefit -- $1 from each ticket sold will go to 
Shelter Partnership Inc., an umbrella organization that aids a variety of 
groups that work with the homeless in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
The celebration, which is produced by George Wein's Festival Productions, kicks 
off tonight with five "Stormy Monday" shows in nightclubs across Southern 
California, including guitarist MacLeod at Reuben's in Redondo Beach, singer 
Dee Dee McNeil at Cafe Lido in Newport Beach and singer/guitarist Roy Gaines at 
Moody's in the downtown L.A.'s Sheraton Grand Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
This year marks the first time Los Angeles is a site for the festival, which 
debuted in St. Louis, Atlanta and New York in 1988 and will be held in five 
cities in 1990. "We chose Los Angeles because of its heritage in the rhythm and 
blues field," says Jane Yusko, manager of the festival for Benson &amp; Hedges. 
</P>
<P>
The recognition is a long time coming as far as Johnny Otis is concerned. Otis 
has been an integral part of the Southland's R&amp;B scene -- which he defines 
as a mixture of "blues, jazz and gospel" -- since the mid-'40s. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been grossly overlooked in terms our contribution to the history of 
rhythm and blues. Los Angeles was the one of most important and earliest 
incubators of R&amp;B," says the man who discovered such artists as singers 
Charles Brown and the late Esther Phillips, and who is perhaps best known for 
his 1958 hit, "Willie and the Hand Jive." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, from the mid-'40s to mid-'50s, such artists as pianist Floyd Dixon, 
guitarists T-Bone Walker (composer of "Stormy Monday Blues"), Lowell Fulson and 
Pee Wee Crayton, saxmen Louis Jordan and and Eddie "Cleanhead" Vinson and 
singers Big Joe Turner and Big Mama Thornton (who wrote "Hound Dog") either 
made Los Angeles their home or worked here extensively. They often performed in 
the Central Avenue area, long renowned for the presence of jazz giants like 
Charlie Parker, Dexter Gordon and Art Tatum, but a showcase for many blues and 
R&amp;B musicians as well. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Pearl, who produces the annual Long Beach blues festival in September 
and who, in association with Festival Productions, helped coordinate talent for 
this week's festival, says that while the blues scene here has rarely hit the 
heights of the '40s and '50s heydays, things are looking up. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like we've reached a stage where blues is an accepted part of the 
(music) scene, whereas a few years ago, it was unusual to see blues acts," 
Pearl says. "And a lot of local artists like (harmonica player) James Harman 
and (guitarist) Phillip Walker also tour out-of-town often." 
</P>
<P>
And if blues is on the rise in the Southland -- clubs such as the Music 
Machine, the Grand Avenue Bar and St. Mark's spotlight blues regularly -- it 
seems its appeal is also on the upswing on a national and international basis. 
</P>
<P>
"The blues are hot," says Hooker, whose "I'm in the Mood" was originally a 
Number One R&amp;B hit in 1951. "They're being appreciated the way they should 
have been appreciated a long time ago. Young fans are coming out and everywhere 
I go it's a sell-out." 
</P>
<P>
Younger artists like Vaughan and Robert Cray are in the spotlight, spreading 
the blues word. "People like Stevie Ray turn their audiences on to men like 
B.B. King, Albert Collins or whoever, and it really helps," says Mac Rebennack, 
also known as Dr. John. 
</P>
<P>
The Louisiana-born Rebennack has his own reasons for the enduring, although not 
always highly commercial, presence of the blues on the American popular music 
scene. "It's real," he says. "Anyway you chop it up, you can't dodge this 
thing. Either you get real and you deal with it or you just melt. The blues is 
crucial chronic music. It's like six by six -- as serious as death." 
</P>
<P>
 Other events on tap are the "Boat Full of Blues," a cruise around L.A. harbor 
with Pearl, John Mayall and Floyd Dixon, departing from Pier 93C, San Pedro, on 
Friday, 8 p.m., (213) 426-4616; an evening of rare blues films screened by 
archivist Mark Cantor at the Laemmle's Monica Fourplex in Santa Monica on 
Tuesday, 7:30 p.m., (213) 394-0741; a seminar on the "Art of Blues 
Songwriting," with Johnny Otis, Dixon, and others in Kinsey Auditorium, 
Exposition Park, Los Angeles, on Saturday, 11 a.m., (213) 450-8859; and a 
tribute to the "Women in the Blues," with Clora Bryant, Ms. Bright Eyes, Mickey 
Champion and more at the Palace, Hollywood, Sunday, noon, (213) 462-6031. The 
latter three events are free. For complete festival information: (213)

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS --  On Disc:
   Raw Rock and Happy Stuff
   ----
   By Jim Fusilli
</HL>

<SO>
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16
</SO>
<LP>
   After all the hype is scraped off, the band Guns N' Roses
can at last be assessed by its work. And on its new albums,
"Use Your Illusion I" and "Use Your Illusion II" (Geffen),
the work is very strong. GNR does what it does well:
straightforward, crushing rock; the occasional snide ballad;
wailing guitars; cocky, tough-guy talk. The 30 songs reveal a
tight unit, powerfully pushed by new drummer Matt Sorum and
led by the prototypically raw guitar of Slash. Axl Rose is
more than a competent screech vocalist, though at times on
these recordings he sounds oddly dissociated from the roar of
the band. The lyrics he delivers exhibit a misogyny and
hubris that says more about the writers than they may have
intended. At their best, the albums echo the Rolling Stones'
"Exile on Main Street" in scope.
   The surprise in the 1989 debut album by Tin Machine (EMI)
wasn't in how well the group played, since Hunt and Tony
Sales had anchored a Todd Rundgren band and Reeves Gabriel
had a burgeoning reputation as a guitarist. The surprise came
in how well David Bowie, the quartet's fourth member, worked
within the context of a band. This year's Tin Machine
surprise is just how good its second album is. A little less
raw than the debut recording, "Tin Machine II" (Victory) is a
powerhouse, laden with commanding performances and
well-crafted songs. Bowie seems as elusive as ever -- is he
playing at being a band member? -- and his vocals float
between coy and crude. In "You Belong in Rock &amp; Roll" he
sings, "I love the cheap things you say"; the perfect Bowie
line -- so effete, so Eurotrashy. Gabriel is more controlled
than on the previous effort (too bad) but the Sales brothers
are blustery and fierce; Hunt Sales's vocal on the bluesy
"Stateside" is an unexpected treat.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Emotions" (Columbia), the follow-up to young Mariah
Carey's smash debut album, is more of the same: happy stuff,
plenty of verve; pretty songs; lush, if somewhat electronic
arrangements; and that highly touted voice. Carey excels at
the kind of vocal gymnastics that are so popular among
today's soul-pop warblers; have these vocalists turned the
bliss and fervor felt and expressed by gospel singers into
calculated performance? The question answers itself. Carey
certainly uses her style and her formidable voice to promote
Carey rather than to convey the visceral intent of the
material: Sooner or later, no matter how sweet the song, no
matter how competent her performance, she is going to get up
on her toes and start squealing for dogs. In time, though,
this may change, and with the flair she and colleague Walter
Afanasieff show for writing a pop song, she will be around
long enough to learn to go for the heart rather than just the
applause.
   Even greater stardom beckons for Harry Connick Jr., and
now his vehicle is brassy, ringing, pulsing '40s-style swing
music. On his "Blue Light, Red Light" (Columbia) he pulls out
all the stops; there's big-band swing, small-combo swing,
sentimental blue-ballad swing (and a pretty-boy Connick in
Bruce Weber photos who signs his blushing liner notes
"Swingfully, Harry"). The good news is that it all works. The
album fairly bursts with joyful noise: honey-dripping
arrangements and facile new melodies by Connick and Ramsey
McLean; snappy, urbane lyrics; and soul-filled playing by
trumpeter Leroy Jones and Louis Ford on clarinet. It may be
disingenuous to call a revivalist derivative, so it's best to
say Connick the vocalist is paying tribute to Sinatra, Torme
et al. with his controlled, romantic crooning. Let's hope his
goal -- "to make jazz and swing music loved by the whole
world. And I mean really loved]" -- produces similar
endeavors of this rich quality, from him and others.
   To my knowledge, Garth Brooks's "Ropin' the Wind"
(Capitol) is the first country album to hit the new Billboard
200 chart in the top slot. (The Billboard 200 is a list of
best-selling albums compiled for the magazine by SoundScan, a
company that says it reports on the number of albums sold by
tabulating them at checkout counters.) It's not hard to see
why the album is a hit. It's a winsome collection with
enjoyable songs, and Brooks aims to please in a gentle
country manner: Even his rockers seem to sway. Of course, he
shines with a tender ballad, as with "What's She Doing Now,"
"Lonesome Dove" and the trucker's lament "Cold Shoulder."
   On his new, two-disc set, "Hymns to the Silence"
(Polydor), Van Morrison shouts, "Memories take me way
back/Hank Williams, Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet on Sunday
afternoons in winter/and the tuning in of stations in Europe
on the wireless." This, then, is where the muse resides for
this project, wherein Morrison pays unbridled homage to the
sound of his youth -- rhythm &amp; blues, gospel, country, Ray
Charles, Celtic music, '50s jazzy blues -- to a wonderful
result. The music is rich, mature, natural, as are his words:
He paints a Joycean picture of his childhood in Ireland as he
writes of moth catchers working the floodlights, green
meadows and buttercups, picking apples at the side of the
track, rippling streams. "And in between the silence there
was conversation and laughter/And music and singing/And
shivers up the back of the neck," he says with a soft, husky
brogue in "On Hyndford Street." Throughout Morrison is
relaxed, chest swelling with confidence, deep in the pocket,
and in great voice, and the band, led by Georgie Fame on
organ, is expert. With "Hymns to the Silence," Morrison
delivers his best recording in many years.

   Reggae has had its ups and downs over the past
decade, but Frederick ``Toots'' Hibbert just keeps playing.
   Hibbert, who has been making music since the early 1960s before
the word reggae ever hit American music stores, is back with his
first LP since 1981, ``Toots in Memphis,' a collection of soul
standards.
   His raspy voice, capable of sweetness and toughness, has been
likened to the late Otis Redding, one of soul's greatest singers.
The reggae star covers a pair of obscure Redding songs, ``I've Got
Dreams to Remember,'' and ``Hard to Handle.'' He also sings the
rhythm 'n' blues hit, ``Knock on Wood,'' and Al Green's ``Love and
Happiness.''
   ``I always listened to Al Green, Otis and Michael Jackson,
Stevie Wonder,'' Hibbert said. ``We are related somewhat.''
   Reggae's most famous rhythm section, Sly Dunbar and Robbie
Shakespeare, plays on the record. Also featured are guitarist
Teenie Hodges, who helped write ``Love and Happiness,'' and Andrew
Love of the Memphis Horns.
   Many of soul's greatest artists, including Redding, Wilson
Pickett and Aretha Franklin, recorded in Memphis. The idea for
making an album there often had been suggested to Hibbert, and the
singer finally contacted Island Records president Chris Blackwell
to express his interest.
   ``I'm not just a reggae singer,'' Hibbert explained. ``I can
sing anything, any song, rewrite the song and make it into my
style.''
   Thanks to young artists such as Ziggy Marley and Maxi Priest,
reggae has enjoyed a resurgence over the past year, inspiring those
who long for a return to the music's heyday of the early 1970s.
   Few of the stars who first made reggae internationally popular
are still around. Bob Marley, the music's most celebrated artist,
died of cancer in 1980. Peter Tosh, Marley's onetime bandmate and a
major performer in his own right, was murdered in 1987. Jimmy
Cliff, whose talents were featured in the popular reggae film,
``The Harder They Come,'' is no longer a commercial success.
   In the early '60s, Hibbert formed a ska trio, ``The Vikings,''
with Raleigh Gordon and Jerry Mathias. They quickly became one of
Jamaica's most popular acts, with Prince Buster producing and
Hibbert leading the way on a series of local hits, ``Pain in My
Belly,'' ``Little Flea'' and ``Dog War.''
   The group renamed itself the Maytals in 1966 and won that year's
Jamaican Festival Song competition with ``Bam, Bam.'' Hibbert
formed a permanent niche in reggae history by giving the music its
name in a 1968 song, ``Do the Reggay.''
   ``We were just playing around,'' Hibbert recalled. ``We used to
have slogans, jokes. Sometimes we'd say of a girl that's not
looking so great, `She's like a streggae.' That word was there and
one morning I said, `Let's do the `reggae.' I didn't think that the
name would last.''
   Under the production of Leslie Kong, the Maytals entered their
peak of popularity with a string of songs that became reggae
standards: ``Funky Kingston,'' ``54-46 That's My Number'' and
``Pressure Drop,'' a featured number in ``The Harder They Come.''
   But Hibbert was anxious to experiment with other forms of music,
covering the rock 'n' roll oldie ``Louie, Louie,'' and a
surprisingly danceable version of John Denver's ``Take Me Home,
Country Roads.'' Hibbert was surprised himself when he learned who
performed the original song.
   ``When I listened to it first I thought it was Ray Charles and I
always liked Ray Charles' sound,'' he said. ``I have a
country-and-western voice, very high pitched. I can find that voice
anytime.''
   Many reggae stars have been outspoken politically. Bob Marley's
active support for Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley led to an
assasination attempt in 1976.
   Priest and ``Burning Spear'' have each recorded tributes to the
late black nationalist leader, Marcus Garvey. Ziggy Marley's latest
album has several political songs.
   But Hibbert, who broke up with the Maytals in the early '80s,
prefers to concentrate on personal matters. ``I don't write about
politics,'' the singer noted. ``I write about naturality, about
real things that happen to real people.''
   One of Hibbert's most popular songs is ``Love Is Gonna to Let Me
Down,'' a heartfelt ballad.
   ``It's about a girl, and I'm giving encouragement,'' he said.
``It can mean anybody, male or female. `Everytime I see your face,
something moves in my heart.' I believe in love so even if love
lets you down, love also never dies.''
   He also differs from other reggae musicians by not being a
member of the Rastafarian religious sect. ``Reggae Got Soul'' is a
better way of expressing Hibbert's philosophy.
   ``I know it's got soul and if you got talent and soul, you can
sing it,'' he said. ``Everybody's got soul. Reggae music is the
music that carries love and good principles with it.''

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: PADRES PITCHER FINDS GUITAR PICK A 
PLEASING ALTERNATIVE 
</P>

San Diego Padres pitcher Eric Show is into his off-season incarnation as a jazz 
guitarist. This Sunday night at the Salmon House in Quivira Basin, between 
Mission Beach and Ocean Beach, Show and top local saxophonist Gary Lefebvre 
will front a rhythm section of Barry Farrar on drums, Bob Hamilton on piano and 
Tom Azarello on bass. 
</P>
<P>
Show has played with Lefebvre on several occasions. The musicians first heard 
each other at one of jazzman Bob Oakes' Sunday jam sessions in Ocean Beach and 
felt a musical rapport. They recorded an album of Christmas songs and planned 
to release it last year, but Show decided to wait until he could arrange more 
thorough distribution than he had for his last album, "America . . . 4/4 To 
Go." 
</P>
<P>
While not on a level with the Wes Montgomerys and Joe Passes of the world, Show 
is a respected guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
"He can play," Lefebvre said. "He can burn on a lot of the old standards and 
some of those things." 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre, who worked with the late trumpeter Chet Baker in the '60s, has put 
his career into overdrive after moving back to San Diego from Ventura 2 1/2 
years ago. He backed Mose Allison during the singer's recent dates at Elario's. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a blues gig," Lefebvre said. "He's got some things with different kinds 
of changes and he makes you think differently, but I started missing the good 
jazz standards." 
</P>
<P>
Lefebvre will also be working with legendary bop trumpeter Red Rodney next 
month at Elario's. And he plans to get his own big band back into rehearsals 
and regular live dates. 
</P>
<P>
At the Salmon House, Show and Lefebvre will play from 6-10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
It's hip to merge African, Cuban or South American rhythms with jazz or pop 
these days, but percussionist Gene Perry is no fashion follower. Perry moved to 
San Diego from Puerto Rico in 1968, and has led his own rhythm-based ensembles 
here since the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
Perry, who makes a living as a groundskeeper at San Diego State University, 
formed Afro Rumba in 1983. This Saturday at 8 p.m., the nine-piece group makes 
a rare appearance at the Centro Cultural de la Raza in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
Early on, the band played mostly variations on Afro-Cuban rhythms, but when 
Perry noticed his diverse audiences included a large number of Latinos, he 
began adding ample doses of salsa. 
</P>
<P>
Live shows bounce to a variety of beats; the band's repertoire includes several 
Latin standards by big-name players like Eddie Palmieri and Mongo Santamaria, 
along with a number of original tunes, many penned by the band's former 
saxophonist Esteban Favila. Perry fuels the fire with a mixed attack on congas, 
bongos, timbales, tamboura and an assortment of other percussion instruments. 
He uses his voice as an additional rhythm instrument. 
</P>
<P>
Perry could increase his following by broadening the music, but he refuses to 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
"Most clubs want Top 40. We don't do that," he said. "Some of the Latinos like 
more of the straight-ahead salsa rhythms, for dancing. It's kind of hard, since 
I'm mixing them up with Latin jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Perry described salsa, generally speaking, as relentless rhythmic dance music, 
while the Latin, or Afro-Cuban, numbers are more expressive, with melodies more 
prominently featured and with more room for improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
Perry has been busy. A few months ago, he sat in with percussionist Tito Puente 
in Tijuana. Recently, he studied with master percussionist Angel (Cachete) 
Maldonado in Puerto Rico, working on traditional rhythms, refining his 
technique on congas. 
</P>
<P>
Perry will open the Saturday show with two hours of African-influenced music 
from Puerto Rico and Cuba. Joined by three dancers, he'll demonstrate bomba, 
rumba and plena rhythms. Then from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m., Afro Rumba will perform 
Latin jazz and salsa. Dancing shoes are recommended. 
</P>
<P>
Former Big Band singer Ann Williams has been booking the jazz at the tiny Beach 
House restaurant in Mission Beach since last summer. Williams, whose best-known 
music was made in the late '40s with Tex Beneke's Big Band, is also an 
influential member of the board of the San Diego Jazz Society. Since joining a 
few months ago, she has attracted such local jazz luminaries as James Moody, 
Charles McPherson and Jim Merod to the board. 
</P>
<P>
Now Williams, who occasionally sings a song or two at Elario's when her jazz 
friends are on stage, is thinking of singing more often. She may do a night or 
two at the restaurant, perhaps with a guitarist or pianist. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, she's bringing top talent to the Beach House. Jan. 19 and 26, 
Mike Wofford plays solo piano; Thursdays, its Dan Papaila on guitar; Saturday 
nights, Brazilian pianist Elfredo Cardim does Gilberto, Jobim and other south 
American classics. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: The San Diego Jazz Society has announced its first show of the new year: 
saxophonist Marshal Royal and trumpeter Joseph Wilder at the Lyceum Stage 
theater in Horton Plaza on Jan. 27. . . . Next Wednesday, Fattburger plays the 
Catamaran Resort Hotel's "Jazz Trax Nite," hosted by Art Good. . . . An 
interview with Max Roach will be featured on the KSDS-FM (88.3) "Percussive 
Profiles" program at 3 p.m. Monday. . . . At the Horton Grand Hotel's Palace 
Bar: Friday, pianist Mel Goot, happy hour, followed by the Bill Hunter Duo; 
Saturday: Jack Hennessey, happy hour, followed by Hunter.

   While growing up in the Scottish village of
Auchtermuchty, Craig and Charlie Reid listened to Frank Sinatra, Ray
Charles and Jim Reeves.
   With their close-cropped hair and horned-rimmed glasses, the Reid
twins could pass for a new-age version of the 1960s English pop duo,
Peter and Gordon. But as The Proclaimers, the brothers erase all
doubts about their Scottish roots.
   ``I think our strength is in being ourselves and not
compromising,'' said Charlie Reid, the guitarist and backing
vocalist for the folk-rock duo. The group has released its second
album, ``Sunshine on Leith.''
   ``In England, which I felt would be the hardest, the album's gone
platinum. We've done it through working and performances. It may
take longer but the process will be worth it. We'll find out a lot
about America and ourselves.''
   The Reids have been best friends all their lives and took pains
in a recent interview to single each other out for priase. As
children, they dreamed of performing together and finally took the
step at 16 when Craig acquired a drum kit and Charlie learned to
play guitar.
   ``It was natural for us that we'd be in the same band,'' said
Charlie, who deferred to his brother as the superior singer. ``I've
got a harsher style; Craig's is better. To some extent the voices
have been shaped that way because I tend to do the backup and the
high harmonies while Craig sings lead.''
   Craig remembered their first time on stage, playing at a local
village hall.
   ``I think one of our songs was by John Lee Hooker, `Boom, Boom.'
We did a Clash song and we may have done soemthing else,'' he said.
``We were very scared. People knew you very well, and they don't
think you can play music. It was very noisy, but it was great.''
   The Reids fronted a punk-rock group before deciding in 1983 to
form an act of their own, naming themselves The Proclaimers and
playing acoustic sets. They headed for London, hoping for a
contract, but were not well received by the English record companies.
   ``They were hinting that if we sang in our own accents, it may be
difficult for people to understand what we were writing about,''
Craig said. ``They said they couldn't sign us because of that.''
   But in 1986, The Housemartins, a popular British band, heard a
tape of The Proclaimers and made them the opening act on their next
tour. The Reids were eventually signed by Chrysalis Records.
   Their first record, ``This Is the Story,'' came out the following
year and featured the single, ``Letter From America,'' a hit in
England. The Reids also celebrated their native accent in ``Throw
the `R' Away.''
   ``A lot of Scots try to get their children's voices to be very
proper, not have them use Scot words,'' Craig said. ``They said you
wouldn't be able to work in England if you do that.''
   The Reids did not use a backing band for their debut album, but
have a wide range of musicians on ``Sunshine on Leith,'' which
features guitars, drums, bass, keyboards, mandolin, fiddle, melodeon
and penny whistle.
   ``We've always liked different sounds,'' Craig said. ``We've
always considered a record where you could do something a bit
different. The music could be anything we wanted. Having a joke,
having a laugh, not taking it too seriously.''
   Gerry Hogan's steel guitar is featured on ``My Old Friend the
Blues,'' a country weeper written by Steve Earle. The Proclaimers
also covered an Earle song on their first album and count themselves
as major country music fans.
   ``I think that any real interest in Scotch and Irish music comes
through our interest in country music,'' Craig said. ``A real thread
of Appalachian and bluegrass music runs through Scotch music. It
awakens your own identity.''
   Craig also praised folk and country lyrics, insisting that they
cover a broader range of subjects.
   ``Basically in rock 'n' roll you write about love and sex and
maybe a couple of political songs, and that is the limit. You don't
write about children, family, places.''
   The remaining 11 songs on ``Sunshine on Leith,'' all written by
the Reids, are a mixture of love, politics and family. ``Sean'' is
about Charlie's baby son. ``What Do You Do'' and ``Cap in Hand''
criticize Scotland's bleak economic condition.
   ``Oh Jean,'' written for a friend of Craig's, closes their live
shows, with the Reids chanting ``I Love Her, I Love Her,'' working
themselves and the audience into a frenzy.
   ``We did a double bill once and we went on and we weren't getting
much of a reaction until we did that one,'' Craig recalled. ``We
tore the place apart.''
   ``You can go as long as you want,'' Charlie said. ``You know the
feeling when it's reached the end. You go into another frame of
mind, not like a trance, but you do try to summon up a primal
energy.''

Drummer Norman Connors and singer/bassist Michael Henderson did some of their 
most important work as pioneers of electric jazz/rock/funk fusion in the '70s. 
But in the '80s, they found success as purveyors of the music known in the 
industry as "quiet storm," the soft, romantic R&amp;B of singers like Whitney 
Houston, Anita Baker and Luther Vandross. 
</P>
<P>
This Sunday, Connors and Henderson bring their bands to Smokey's in Mission 
Valley for shows at 7:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. Lest jazz fans think there's 
nothing in it for them, Connors said the live dates are much different than his 
honey-dripping self-produced albums. 
</P>
<P>
"My direction is jazz, similar to Quincy (Jones)," he said. "I come from a jazz 
background, I studied jazz and classical music. We always play some jazz. I 
always start off the show doing Coltrane's 'Naima,' Miles (Davis), Herbie 
(Hancock). Then, when the singers come out, we play our vocal hits." 
</P>
<P>
Connors' pre-fusion jazz work was on the edge. He worked with Archie Shepp, 
Jack McDuff, Jackie McLean, Sam Rivers and Charles Erler before joining Pharoah 
Sanders' group in 1971. His pioneering fusion album was the 1972 "Dance of 
Magic" with Hancock, Stanley Clarke, Ron Carter, Hubert Laws, Gary Bartz, 
Airto, Ron Carter and Hubert Laws. 
</P>
<P>
Although his last album, "Passion," includes several of the pulsing, romantic 
ballads that have brought him commercial success, there are also tunes like the 
title track, in which Marion Meadows' electrified, Contrane-like soprano sax is 
layered over dreamy, funk rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Connors has always had great singers in his groups. His current band features 
Spencer Harrison, a baritone with a voice Connors described as "somewhere 
between Peabo Bryson and Jeffrey Osborne," and Gabrielle Goodman, a former 
backup singer for Roberta Flack whose early training was in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson and Connors made their last album together -- "You Are My Starship" 
-- in 1977. It went platinum. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Henderson's most intense jazz training came during his seven years with 
Miles Davis. Henderson grew up with the gritty sounds of Detroit, and by the 
mid-'60s, was one of the top session players during the "Golden Era" at Motown 
Records. He has toured with Stevie Wonder and Aretha Franklin, and played with 
Marvin Gaye, the Temptations, the Supremes and the Four Tops. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson and Connors' best known hit together was their recording of 
Henderson's song "Valentine Love." 
</P>
<P>
How will the evening unfold? 
</P>
<P>
"Michael's group will play, then I'll play. At the end, we'll all get together, 
like a gumbo soup," Connors said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans most often hear Ron Satterfield as half of the successful local 
band Checkfield, whose music has become a mainstay of light jazz and adult 
contemporary radio. But Satterfield is also an accomplished straight-ahead jazz 
man, as he'll be proving Sunday and Monday nights through March 26 at the 
Marine Room in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Satterfield and top local flutist Holly Hofmann are using a variety of 
material, including Hofmann's compositions, lots of Antonio Carlos Jobim and 
several Frank Sinatra songs. 
</P>
<P>
Satterfield plays several instruments, but for these dates, he's bringing only 
his guitar and voice. 
</P>
<P>
Checkfield's new album, "A View from the Edge," featuring Satterfield and 
partner John Archer, is due out March 1. Hofmann's next, titled "Further 
Adventures," and using Mike Wofford on piano, Sherman Ferguson on drums and Bob 
Magnusson on bass, is also due in March. 
</P>
<P>
Last time he was here, temperamental sax man Gato Barbieri blitzed the 
Bacchanal with a set that leaned too heavy on ear-shredding volume, too light 
on musicianship. Barbieri, who played free jazz with Don Cherry before finding 
a more Latin sound, appears once again at the Bacchanal this Friday night. 
Depending on how he reacts to the idea, Barbieri may be joined on stage not 
only by his band, but by the Japanese artist Rocco, who is visiting San Diego 
and who often paints large, spontaneous murals to the accompaniment of live 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
For Grammy night next Wednesday, the Catamaran Resort Hotel's Cannibal Bar will 
present the awards program on a large screen television, with local jazz man 
Hollis Gentry interjecting some live music. The Catamaran has been hit hard by 
last year's demise of KSWV-FM (102.9), "The Wave." The club had been drawing 
crowds of up to 300 for its regular jazz nights hosted by KSWV deejay Art Good, 
promoted heavily on "The Wave." Good is back hosting the occasional "Jazz Trax" 
nights with his former employer, KIFM (98.1), and business is much slower, 
according to Catamaran general manager George Harrington. The Catamaran 
originally left KIFM's "Lites Out" jazz club circuit to become the only club 
with a regular jazz night promoted by KSWV. With KIFM again, the Catamaran 
can't get its old Wednesday night "Lites Out" slot back -- it was given to the 
Del Mar Hilton. Harrington is crossing his fingers that the Hilton will "go 
away" so he can officially rejoin the "Lites Out" circuit, with its 
commensurate crowd-drawing radio promos.

ONE JACKSON DIVIDES INTO TWO JAZZ QUARTETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Milt Jackson lives a double life and would not object to enlarging that scope 
to triple or quadruple. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1981, when the Modern Jazz Quartet reunited after a breakup that lasted 
almost seven years, Jackson has divided his time between MJQ tours with his 
longtime companions -- John Lewis, piano; Percy Heath, bass; Connie Kay, drums 
-- and dates with his own quartet. 
</P>
<P>
"We started with the MJQ in February of 1952," he recalled recently during a 
visit to Hollywood with his group. "For all but three of our years together, 
we've had the same personnel -- Connie Kay replaced Kenny Clarke in 1955. 
That's an all-time record in music. And we've performed with 36 different 
symphonies, most notably the Stuttgart; we played with the Juilliard String 
Quartet, and recently we did a television show with Itzhak Perlman. 
</P>
<P>
"When the Modern Jazz Quartet takes off, I do these various other projects. I'm 
not one for long vacations -- I'm like Duke Ellington, who never wanted to take 
time off. There's only two other workhorses like that -- Dizzy Gillespie, who 
has no children and likes to keep traveling; and Ray Brown, who works 
constantly -- so much so that when we were together for a while, I had to tell 
him, 'Man, put a break in there somewhere; you can work yourself to death but 
you're not going to carry me with you!' " 
</P>
<P>
Two other aspects of the vibraphonist's career that have been neglected in 
recent years are his composing and singing. "People forget that my first 
profession was as a singer. I did the vocals on a whole album for Norman Granz 
in 1978, on Pablo, and there are two songs in there for which I wrote the words 
and the music: 'Heartstrings' and 'For Someone I Love.' 
</P>
<P>
"The best compliment ever paid me was when Quincy Jones said I could make a 
fortune as a composer and lyric writer. I haven't done much writing lately, but 
I'm in the process of getting a new idea together." 
</P>
<P>
One item on the Jackson agenda is a return bout with Ray Charles, his partner 
on a unique album some years ago. Another is a small combo sound for which he 
would like to do some writing, featuring Jimmy Heath on soprano saxophone -- "I 
love the sound he gets on that horn" -- and James Moody on flute. Both, like 
Jackson, are veterans of the bop years. 
</P>
<P>
As successful as he has been, Jackson feels that he and his contemporaries are 
still being held back by TV and radio. 
</P>
<P>
"How often do you hear the MJQ, or any good jazz, on TV? Or on radio?," he 
said. "I can remember when Symphony Sid was broadcasting live on ABC out of 
Birdland in New York and we could hear him in San Francisco or Dallas; and Sid 
McCoy came out of Chicago on NBC. Why is jazz sabotaged?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sabotage" is perhaps an overly strong word, but it is true that most disc 
jockeys have rock stars in their eyes and that virtually all the jazz 
television specials are seen via cable or public TV. Serious treatment of jazz 
on the three major networks is a hair short of nonexistent, with a few notable 
exceptions, such as Dr. Billy Taylor's interviews with musicians on CBS' 
"Sunday Morning." True, David Sanborn has his own series, but it leans heavily 
toward pop-jazz and fusion artists. The latter is another area about which 
Jackson has strong negative feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"We experimented briefly with electronics in the Modern Jazz Quartet, and I 
hated it; I was so relieved when we abandoned it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be pure at heart and very dedicated to play our kind of music. 
Consider the music Miles Davis is playing today, compared to that beautiful 
music he played 30 years ago. Of course, he has a reason; he probably got some 
big advances from Columbia Records and wanted to make some records that would 
pay back those advances. You can't do that by making jazz albums." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Parker remains Jackson's principal hero, as he was when they played 
together on some of the early Dizzy Gillespie classics. "He was an amazing man, 
and there is a side of him that I never saw put in print -- the fact that he 
was very well versed in art, literature, philosophy, history. I talked to him 
at length and was astonished at his knowledge. There was a fine line too 
between his genius as a saxophonist, which we all knew about, and the other 
side of him, the drug addict; more people ought to know what a brilliant human 
being he was. 
</P>
<P>
"I am so dedicated to people like Bird, as well as Coleman Hawkins, Wes 
Montgomery, John Coltrane and, of course, Dizzy. I would come back from my 
grave to play with any of those giants at any time. 
</P>
<P>
"Acoustic music is my kind of music; I like the natural sound, the melodic 
content and the lyrical beauty. And, until the people we play for get tired of 
listening to it, that's the type of music I will always play." 
</P>
<P>
MODERN JAZZ QUARTET: "Fontessa." Atlantic 1231-2. **** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
Milt Jackson's famous blues composition "Bluesology" is heard here in its 
pristine 1956 version, recorded when the Quartet and Jackson were winning 
annual jazz polls as No. 1 in their respective fields. An extended version of 
John Lewis' title tune and chamber-jazz treatments of such standards as "Over 
the Rainbow" and "Angel Eyes," helped establish this as one of the MJQ's 
preeminent sessions.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- On Records:
   From Mitchell to McShann

<LP>
   Few contemporary musicians own a legacy as rich and
deserved as Joni Mitchell's, and sharing her growth as an
artist has been a delight: She's been adventurous
challenging, bold, self-assured, open. Her latest album,
"Night Ride Home" (Geffen), shows she's still growing, still
reaching and still succeeding.
   While it may lack the commercial verve of her 1988
release, "Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm" (Geffen), "Night Ride
Home" is a very special recording. A mature work, it casts
Mitchell as surveying the landscape of middle age: "Oh I am
not old/I'm told/But I am not young/Oh and nothing can be
done," she sings in "Nothing Can Be Done" and asks, "Must I
surrender with grace/The things I loved when I was young?" In
"Two Grey Rooms," she adds, "No one knows I'm here/One day I
just disappeared." And, looking back, she sings, "We really
thought we had a purpose/We were so anxious to achieve/We had
hope, the world held promise/For a slave to liberty" in "Come
in From the Cold."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The 10 songs on "Night Ride Home" are intensely delivered
by Mitchell over simple arrangements; the recording has the
hypnotic feel of her 1976 masterpiece, "Hejira"
(Elektra-Asylum). Her guitar is a seductive drone, while
Larry Klein provides an alluring, unorthodox bass and Alex
Acuna adds a gentle percussion. Wayne Shorter, a frequent
Mitchell guest, contributes a flitting, bird-like sax on
several numbers.
   On "Black Top Blues-A-Rama, Vol. 3 and Vol. 4" (Black Top
Records) you'll find plenty of the fire that's often lacking
in today's mainstream rock. Caught live at Tipitina's in New
Orleans in 1989, these two recordings of raucous soul and R&amp;B
revues are as loose and as hot as they can be, and they brim
with the real thing: redhot guitarist Bobby Radcliff; the
blues vocalist and former Guitar Slim and Albert Collins
sideman James "Thunderbird" Davis; organist Ron Levy, with
guest Anton Funderburgh; and Grady Gaines and the 10-piece
Texas Upsetters, whose tornado of a revue is the subject of
Vol. Four. (The original Upsetters were Little Richard's road
band, with Gaines on sax, and they backed the likes of Otis
Redding, Jackie Wilson, Little Willie John and Sam Cooke.)
What you get is shouting, sweating, pushing, wrenching soul,
blues and R&amp;B; nobody's the least bit restrained on these
albums. And the cozy production -- in the background, glasses
tinkle, people cough, the bandleaders count off the songs --
puts you right in the club.
   There's more than a little fire on the jazz side, too, in
Jay McShann's Paris AllStar Blues' live tribute to Charlie
Parker (Music-Masters). Led by pianist McShann, the band
storms its way through numbers written by the likes of
Parker, Benny Moten, Count Basie and McShann. The music is
brazen and brassy, and while soloists Clark Terry, James
Moody, Jimmy Heath, Terence Blanchard, Phil Woods and Benny
Carter excel, the bold ensemble playing glows. And what a
treat it is to again hear vocalist Ernie Andrews, whose style
is as timeless as the songs he sings.
   Danny Gatton has been revered by guitar aficionados for
years. His new album, "Elmira St." (Elektra), may bring him a
wider audience. The Washington, D.C.-based Gatton tackles
rock-a-billy, country, blues and straight-ahead rock with an
almost out-of-control passion -- hence his nickname, "The
Humbler," granted by another guitarist. An in-your-face horn
section consisting of Bill Holloman on all saxes, trumpet,
clarinet and trombone gives him a sturdy backboard to bounce
off. (As if six horns and reeds weren't enough, Holloman also
plays all keyboards and vibes.) Just when Gatton threatens to
burn down the house, he offers an unexpected gem: a sweet,
twangy rendition of Brian Wilson's "In My Room." There's a
touch of Carl Perkins here, a Duane Eddy lick there, maybe
some Scotty Moore, but in the end Gatton's eclectic style is
all his own, and it's hot.
   Speaking of influences, Detroit's Mr. Fiddler mixes a
smattering of styles to come up with a winning debut album,
"With Respect" (Elektra). But, as it was for Mr. Fiddler's
influences -- August Darnell's Kid Creole and the Coconuts
and George Clinton's P-Funk Circle, to name two -- the music
may be too smart for Top 40. But it's more than good enough
for a listen: The vocals by Joseph Amp Fiddler are sharp, the
'70s-dance-meets-the-New-Jack-Swing backing tracks jump,
Chris Bruce's guitar is slinky funk, and the attitude is
cocked fedora all the way.
   And finally, "Selling Water by the Side of the River"
(Island) by Evan Lurie is an album that grows more compelling
with each listening. A clue to Lurie's sound is in the
quintet's instrumentation -- violin, classical guitar (played
by the brilliant Marc Ribot), upright bass, piano and
bandoneon, the typewriter-like accordion -- which creates
music that is as intriguing as it is charming. On the album,
the music gallops along merrily, sweetly, then suddenly turns
cold and distancing; a brightness is followed by despair; the
almost nine-minute long "Ballad of a New York Peasant" is an
album in itself. In all, the recording is evocative,
European-imagine the soundtrack to the film "The Third Man"
with a thrilling accordion instead of the zither-touching,
never less than interesting, wonderful.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: HORTA BLENDS BRAZILIAN IDEAS SEAMLESSLY 
INTO OWN SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of the best hybrid music to come from an American jazz guitarist is the 
Brazilian-flavored work of Pat Metheny. So it's not too surprising that one of 
the finer new albums by a Brazilian musician with strong American ties can be 
found in "Moonstone" by Toninho Horta, a longtime friend of Metheny. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike musicians who casually borrow a bossa nova rhythm or entire Brazilian 
song, guitarist-vocalist Horta makes music that captures the light, pure spirit 
evoked by his Brazilian mentors: Jorge Ben, Joao Gilberto, Milton Nascimento, 
Antonio Carlos Jobim. Horta also names American guitarists Wes Montgomery and 
Barney Kessel as major influences, along with an unlikely source of 
inspiration: Henry Mancini. 
</P>
<P>
Horta, who plays the Bacchanal Wednesday on his first U.S. tour, blends these 
ideas seamlessly into his own sound. A prodigious composer, he wrote all but 
one of the songs on the new album. On guitar, Horta can finger-pick light, 
Brazilian rhythms on a nylon-stringed acoustic instrument or conjure jazzier 
Metheny-ish flourishes from his electric. At times, when playing acoustic 
guitar and singing in a warm, melodic voice, Horta calls to mind those great 
'60s collaborations between Gilberto and saxophonist Stan Getz. 
</P>
<P>
"Moonstone" is only Horta's second U.S. album, but he's a seasoned musician. He 
first came to this country in the '70s to work with Brazilian percussionist 
Airto Moreira and vocalist Flora Purim. He made an impression on musicians, and 
eventually played with Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Joe Pass, Paquito 
D'Rivera and others. 
</P>
<P>
While Horta's new album benefits from an all-star cast including Metheny, Onaje 
Allan Gumbs, Randy Brecker and Russell Ferrante, his road band for the current 
tour reportedly has been less than perfect, at times overpowering Horta's 
delicate singing and playing. Perhaps by the time they hit San Diego, they'll 
have made the necessary adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
Only rarely do San Diegans have a chance to hear today's equivalent of what 
used to be called "avant-garde" or "Loft" jazz. Until recently, there was no 
local venue for music not classifiable as either mainstream or commercial jazz. 
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, the small RUSE Performance Gallery (447 5th Ave.) has been 
making a name by presenting unusual music and performances. 
</P>
<P>
Now RUSE has put together Ruse Fest '89, showcasing the best of cutting-edge 
culture. It is funded in part by a grant from the San Diego Arts and Cultural 
Commission. The festival will run seven nights: Oct. 20, Oct. 27 and Nov. 10-11 
and 16-18. The first two nights will feature jazz at the San Diego City College 
Theater (C Street between 13th and 15th streets), with half the proceeds going 
to KSDS, co-sponsor of the concerts. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz pianist Glenn Horiuchi opens the series Friday night with an original new 
program composed for Ruse Fest, titled "Burning Embers." 
</P>
<P>
"Because of my style, I don't get asked to play clubs that much," said 
Horiuchi, who can swing in the best tradition of straight-ahead jazz but often 
departs into the more abstract territory occupied by players such as Cecil 
Taylor and Ornette Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
There aren't many Asian jazz musicians, and Horiuchi brings an unusual blend of 
influences to his music. His grandfather performed and wrote traditional 
Japanese music, and, in the world of jazz, Horiuchi said he looks up to Taylor, 
Horace Tapscott, Horace Silver, Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane. His music, 
mostly original, often combines jazz references with Japanese rhythms and 
tonalities. 
</P>
<P>
What makes Horiuchi a delight to both neophytes and nit-pickers is his 
technical excellence. Whether he's playing a far-out improvisation or something 
in a more familiar vein, he produces a consistently intriguing series of 
melodic and harmonic explorations. 
</P>
<P>
Adding texture to Horiuchi's live performance will be Leon Alexander on drums, 
Francis Wong on sax and flute and Taiji Miyagawa on bass. 
</P>
<P>
"Burning Embers," a performance of brand-new material, begins at 8 p.m. Friday. 
For ticket information, call 236-1347 or 234-1062.

New from Elario's: The club has added a $5 cover charge on weekends. The 
additional money will be used to maintain a top-notch jazz calendar and,

Witherspoon turn out some mean blues. A quote included by this writer in a 
feature story about Witherspoon last week was taken out of context: Witherspoon 
is quite comfortable financially, and even sports a gold Baume &amp; Mercier 
watch on stage. If you can't pronounce it, you don't need to know the price. .

JAZZ NOTES: TURRENTINE JAZZES UP HIS APPROACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine, who has been a pro going on four decades, 
is another improvising artist who can take or leave the word "Jazz." "It's too 
ambiguous," the Kensington, Md., resident said from a San Francisco tour stop 
Monday. "I always say, 'Ask 50 people what jazz is and you get 50 different 
opinions.' It seems that anything that people don't understand, well, that's 
jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Turrentine -- who plays Birdland West in Long Beach with his quintet through 
Saturday -- says that all the labels people have given him over the years prove 
his point. "It's been said that I'm a blues player, that I play jazz/fusion, 
bebop, rock 'n' roll, con-fusion. I've been through it all," he laughed. 
"Still, I'm playing the same style that I always did, so I try to think in 
terms of music, and just hope the fans like it and keep comin' on in." 
</P>
<P>
Blues, coupled with a capacity for playing long, swinging lines, has always 
been the essential ingredient of the Turrentine approach. "That's a good 
foundation, at least it has been for me," said the former Pittsburgh, Pa. 
native. "I've been into the blues from my first road job, which was with (blues 
guitarist/singer) Lowell Fulsom when I was 16. Ray Charles was the featured 
vocalist and pianist with that group. We'd get on the bandstand and he'd bring 
tears to my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
And while the 55-year-old horn man said that his band members -- Bob Fox, 
keyboards; Dave Stryker, guitar; Scott Ambush, bass, and Ernie Adams, drums -- 
occasionally employ some synthesizers and electric instruments, their use 
hasn't adulterated his presentations. "I surround myself with some of that 
stuff to get that 'today' feel," he said, "but the technology doesn't distort 
my style. I'm still playing acoustically and I don't use any gadgets." 
</P>
<P>
Turrentine said his current repertoire reaches from such early-'70s CTI LPs as 
"Pieces of Dreams" and "Sugar" to his most recent Blue Note effort, "La Place." 
"I play a little bit of the old, a little of the new," he said. "I try to keep 
it to flexible. It seems that a lot of the music I have recorded is still 
valid. At least it's entertaining to me, and I guess entertaining to the people 
who come in." 
</P>
<P>
Briefly hospitalized in October due to an onset of pulmonary edema, Turrentine 
said he's back on his feet and feeling great. "I'm following my doctor's 
orders, sticking to my diet and taking my high blood pressure pills and it's 
like nothing ever happened. I do thank all the people for their cards and 
prayers. They really helped." 
</P>
<P>
Upcoming Turrentine engagements include a slot on the David Letterman show on 
Tuesday, a New Year's Eve date at the World Trade Center in Manhattan and a 
benefit for Enter -- a comprehensive alcohol and drug treatment center located 
in East Harlem -- at the Apollo Theatre on Jan. 27. "It's one of my pet 
projects," he said, adding that such associates as Jimmy Smith, Les McCann, 
Shirley Scott, Hubert Laws, Michael Brecker and Jean Carne are donating their 
services. Angelenos wishing to make donations may write to Enter, 302 E. 111th 
St., New York, N.Y., 10029.

Eskovitz on the Run 
</P>
<P>
Saxophonist Bruce Eskovitz says one of the biggest drawbacks in the current 
music scene is the difficulty in keeping a band together. That's why he's so 
pleased that his quintet -- which plays at the Overland Cafe in Palms on Friday 
at 8:30 p.m. -- has remained intact for a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys and I -- Stuart Elster, keyboards; David Hart, guitar; Bob Feldman, 
bass, and Rod Harbour, drums -- have been friends for many years and there's 
nothing better than people who like each other playing together, grooving and 
having the audience like it," the CSUN grad said. "I think Paul McCartney said 
that having a band is more fun than driving a Rolls-Royce. Well, I've never had 
a Rolls, but I can tell you, having a band is great." 
</P>
<P>
Eskovitz, who also heads the jazz program at the Crossroads School in Santa 
Monica, covers the gamut of modern moods in his performances. "We do some 
Latin-flavored things, some fusion things and also dip into mainstream, though 
we try to do that with a 1989 approach." 
</P>
<P>
The leader's eponymously-titled debut LP is due out in January on the Los 
Angeles-based ITI label. "It's kind of a jazz/fusion record, but there are 
horns on some tracks, a string section on a ballad, kind of a mixture of some 
happy moods with some that are little darker and deeper. I feel good about it."

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: SINGER LAMENTS THE LACK OF CLUB DATES 
IN SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Frustrated by the lack of local club dates for jazz singers, Cath Eckert gave 
up on clubs last spring and has been making a living doing casuals -- parties, 
weddings, conventions. 
</P>
<P>
She'll be back in a club for the first time since then when she appears 
Wednesday evenings, from 5:30 to 9:30 through December, at the U.S. Grant Hotel 
lounge downtown. 
</P>
<P>
"My main main love is jazz, and I do it whenever I can," said Eckert. 'But for 
a while, I said, 'Forget it, it's too much trouble.' To get a jazz gig, you 
have to be able to pack the place, and you end up spending all your time 
mailing out flyers." 
</P>
<P>
Eckert said opportunities for jazz singers seem to be at an all-time low in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what's happened. You'd think with the popularity of Diane Schuur 
and other singers that jazz vocalists would be popular. There are some singers 
out there, but mostly doing R&amp;B, 1950s and Top 40 stuff." 
</P>
<P>
At the Grant, Eckert will be singing standards such as Tadd Dameron's "If You 
Could See Me Now," Latin versions of jazz pieces such as "I Concentrate on You" 
and "Street of Dreams," plus holiday songs including "Have Yourself a Merry 
Little Christmas" and "The Christmas Song." She'll be joined by husband Chris 
Conner on bass and Mike Wofford on piano. 
</P>
<P>
"Luv in the Afternoon," the new album by San Diegans Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham 
and the Sweet Baby Blues Band, continues the band's punchy blend of jazz and 
blues, but with a special grit: the guitar of guest performer Clarence 
(Gatemouth) Brown. Brown contributes his bluesy string bends and T-Bone 
Walker-inspired jazz-blues lines to three songs. The album mixes originals by 
the Cheathams with blues standards such as "Don't You Feel My Leg" and "Baby 
Please Don't Go." Jeannie Cheatham's earthy vocals and swinging piano drive the 
music. 
</P>
<P>
The music is rock solid, but it doesn't have the heat of the band's live 
performances. For that, you can visit Elario's later this month, where they 
close 1990 with a weeklong stay that ends New Year's Eve. It's been a busy year 
for the Cheathams: They appeared at the Blue Note in New York City and guested 
on the "Today Show" in August, played the Chicago Jazz Festival in September 
and entertained travelers aboard the S.S. Norway during a jazz cruise to the 
Virgin Islands. They also made the cover of the September/October issue of 
"Living Blues" magazine, which contained an article on them by San Diegan Jim 
Trageser. 
</P>
<P>
John Patitucci, who opens five nights at Elario's on Wednesday, is equally 
adept at either electric or acoustic bass. On his new album, "Sketchbook," for 
example, Patitucci's playing ranges from earthy, acoustic bass beneath Michael 
Brecker's Coltrane-inspired sax on " 'Trane" to a sliding, sensuous sound on 
six-string electric bass in the funky "Joab." 
</P>
<P>
Patitucci's significant break came in 1985, when he was asked by Chick Corea to 
join the keyboard player's Elektric Band. He continues to play with Corea while 
pursuing a solo career. 
</P>
<P>
"Sketchbook" is his third album. Few bassists are worth several minutes of solo 
time, but Patitucci is one exception. From the difficult upright bass, for 
example, he wrings rapid-fire lines with the ease of the best electric guitar 
players, and he matches saxophonists one-on-one, playing speedy melody lines in 
unison. 
</P>
<P>
As a composer, Patitucci is coming of age. He wrote most of the music on the 
new album (which rated 4 1/2 stars out of 5 in "Downbeat"), and his tastes run 
from jazz to funk to Brazilian. At Elario's, Patitucci will be joined by 
drummer Vinnie Colaiuta, keyboardist John Beasley and saxophonist Steve 
Tavaglione. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning Dec. 10, KIFM (98.1) will operate from quarters matching its slick 
on-air image. After four years in an anonymous stucco building in Kearny Mesa, 
the station has spent $1.8 million on a 10-year lease, equipment and interior 
design for a 6,500-square-foot space in the Tishman Hurst Town Centre in La 
Jolla's Golden Triangle, visible from Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
A black marble floor and a splotch-painted wall that looks like a moody sky 
greet visitors. Other walls are painted in bright shades of blue and grape, 
reminiscent of a sixties record store. The new, larger space will accommodate a 
growing music collection, which station program director Bob O'Connor hopes to 
increase from 125 CDs to 1,000 in the months ahead. The station also has about 
1,000 record albums, especially of straight-ahead jazz not available on CDs. 
With the popularity of Ron Galon's Sunday night straight-ahead show, the 
station plans to expand its straight-ahead collection. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Vocalist Michael Franks kicks off winter's "Simply Jazz" series at East 
County Performing Arts Center in El Cajon at 3:30 Sunday afternoon. Tickets are

   Bobby McFerrin, minimalist composer Steve Reich
and singers Mel Torme and Cleo Laine will headline three of the
concerts at Carnegie Hall during this year's JVC Jazz Festival.
   Impresario George Wein on Monday announced the lineup for the
festival to be held June 22 through 30. He also paid tribute to
Sarah Vaughan, calling the late singer ``one who belongs in the
Valhalla of jazz greats.''
   Vaughan, a featured performer at the festival in past years,
died April 3.
   ``Our schedule is messed up because we don't have the concert
for Sarah Vaughan,'' Wein said. Concerts for June 29 will be
announced later.
   Opening night will feature the Dizzy Gillespie United Nations
Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. Trumpeter Jon Faddis and the group of
pianist Marcus Roberts, stepping out from Winton Marsalis' combo,
will be guests.
   Miles Davis and the popular group Hiroshima will give two
concerts that night at Avery Fisher Hall. Lionel Hampton and
Orchestra will play in Stamford, Conn.
   Earlier in the evening, ragtime specialist Terry Waldo will play
piano at Weill Recital Hall and the Roy Campbell and William Parker
Duo and Jazz Passengers will play at Equitable Auditorium.
   Those who prefer solo piano can attend the early piano series at
Carnegie's Weill Recital Hall. It will feature Randy Weston, Sir
Charles Thompson, Geoff Keezer, Marty Napoleon, John Lewis,
Abdullah Ibrahim, Mulgrew Miller and Barbara Carroll.
   On Saturday, June 23, Reich and musicians and the World
Saxophone Quartet are at Carnegie; Lee Ritenour and Patti Austin at
Avery Fisher, and a salute to bassist Milt Hinton on his 80th
birthday at Town Hall.
   Sunday finds George Benson and McCoy Tyner at Carnegie and Ray
Charles and Roberta Flack at Avery Fisher. Monday has only early
concerts. Tuesday brings Torme, Laine and John Dankworth to
Carnegie, Milton Nascimento and Wayne Shorter to Avery Fisher and a
salute to guitarist Jim Hall at Town Hall.
   McFerrin, best known for his hit record ``Don't Worry, Be
Happy,'' will appear June 27 with Chick Corea in ``An Evening of
Improvisations.'' Pearl Bailey makes her festival debut that night
at Avery Fisher Hall with trumpeter Winton Marsalis and drummer
Louis Bellson as musical director. At Town Hall that night, Gerry
Mulligan, Ruby Braff and Dick Hyman participate in ``An Evening of
American Song.''
   The Dave Brubeck Quartet will give a free concert Thursday, June
28, at the World Financial Center. ``An Evening with Oscar
Peterson'' will be at Avery Fisher Hall. Stan Getz, with quartet
and sextet, will present 50 years of his music that evening in
Carnegie Hall.
   Saturday brings a Latin jam, with Eddie Palmieri, Ramsey Lewis
and Papo Lucca, to Carnegie. ``A New York City Tribute to Spike
Lee,'' with Nancy Wilson, Ahmad Jamal and Terence Blanchard, at
Avery Fisher, will be a benefit for Jazzmobile, which takes jazz
musicians to city neighborhoods.
   Two concerts that night will be given by Jack DeJohnette, Herbie
Hancock, Dave Holland and Pat Metheny at the Beacon Theater.
   Events away from New York include a noon to 6 p.m. piano
spectacular June 23 and a jazz picnic from 11 a.m. to 6 June 24 at
Waterloo Village in Stanhope, N.J., June 23. On the final Saturday
and Sunday, there will be noon to midnight concerts at the Saratoga
Performing Arts Center, Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and 2 to 11 p.m. at
the Finger Lakes Performing Arts Center, Canandaigua, N.Y.

<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; CELEBRITY; SHOW; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  MACEO Parker is digging in for a solo on an old James Brown tune. He's onstage
at Elario's Jazz Club, staring straight down the length of his tarnished horn,
holding the bell of the instrument flush against the microphone. He raises his
left eyebrow as he hits a choice, plump note and then, as the solo builds,
starts to sway his hips.;    Now Parker closes his eyes, angles his shoulders,
crouches and jumps from one foot to the other as he yelps through the horn,
playing staccato phrases over and over like a chant, mixing in long, fluid
bebop lines, and turning all these improvised melodies inside out and back
onto themselves.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Weekend  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  MACEO PARKER -- SOUL BROTHER NO. 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Parker plays every note with that tart, biting sound of his -- Brown could
never get enough of it -- and with a rhythmic drive that's absolutely
on-the-money. He snakes his way through the stuttering funk beat, the beat
that he helped create with Brown in the 1960s, the beat that made disco
possible, the beat that made rap possible.;    When Parker finishes the solo,
trombonist Fred Wesley and tenor saxophonist Alfred "Pee Wee" Ellis --
compatriots from Brown's old band -- cheer as if they've never heard him play
before. Parker turns to his organist and shouts, "Play that funk, baby. Get it
in your neck.";    Larry Goldings, the organist, is 22. That's how old Parker
was in 1965, when he recorded his first saxophone solo with  Brown, America's
No. 1 Soul Brother, on "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag." In 1968, Parker, Wesley
and Ellis were all in Brown's band when it recorded "Say It Loud -- I'm Black
and I'm Proud." In 1973, Parker and Wesley played on Brown's hit "Doing It to
Death," otherwise known as "We're Gonna Have a Funky Good Time.";    You
remember that one -- the thumping one-chord vamp, the chicken-scratching
guitar, the fat back-beat, Wesley's blow-you-down trombone solo, and how Brown
started screaming for Parker to come to the microphone and play his horn:;   
"Wait a minute!" Brown shouted over the band. "Who'd you say that was over
there? Is that Maceo? Maceo! Hey, brother! Ha ha ha!";    It sounded like the
world's greatest party was happening right there in the studio.;    Then Brown
started to croon:;    "Now Mac -- Mac-ee-o.;    "Brother Maceo! Got to blow!";
   And Maceo Parker stepped to the microphone and raised the temperature
another hundred degrees or so, ripping off one of the more electrifying
saxophone solos in the recorded history of American popular music.; (hbox);   
A quarter-century after this threesome made history, Parker, Wesley and Ellis
are on the road -- the tour stops at San Jose State University today -- and
there's nothing dated or warmed-over about the music.;    Parker's new record
-- No. 2 on the Billboard jazz charts -- is "Roots Revisited." He, Wesley and
Ellis have reached back to play the sort of soulful jump tunes that Ray
Charles and his band made popular in the 1950s. Parker's group performed
Wednesday on "The Tonight Show." This followed Parker's recent recordings with
Living Color and Deee-Lite and concerts with bassist Bootsy Collins -- his
confederate in George Clinton's Parliament and Funkadelic aggregations of the
1970s.;    In the last year, Parker-Wesley-Ellis have toured as the JB (James
Brown) Horns, with a changing cast of characters from the old gang. Parker
also has released a 12-inch hip-hop single called "Let 'Em Out." It's
dedicated to Brown, who was jailed in 1988 after leading a convoy of police
cars on a wild chase in Georgia and South Carolina, supposedly while under the
influence of PCP.;    Parker played with Brown off and on for nearly 25 years
-- including a last-gasp fling before Brown's arrest three years ago. Parker,
sitting in his hotel room one floor below Elario's, recounts all of this. He
is friendly, but a little edgy and distracted. He wears a black fedora pulled
down to the bridge of his nose. When he removes the hat, his eyes dart around
the room -- he's jumpy, like his saxophone playing.;    Parker, born in
Kinston, N.C., 47 years ago, remembers his uncle Bobby Butler, who used to
play drums in a band called the Blue Notes. During intermissions, Butler would
let his nephews have their turn -- Parker was on saxophone, his younger
brother Melvin was on drums and older brother Kellis, now a Columbia
University Law School professor, played trombone. They called themselves the
Junior Blue Notes and covered hits by Lloyd Price, Little Willie John and the
Drifters. "I'm trying to think," Parker says, "did we do some James Brown
stuff back then? Maybe we did 'Try Me.' And we did 'Shout' by the Isley
Brothers.";    Parker and Melvin attended college for a year or two. But then
Brown spotted Melvin playing in a club in Greensboro, N.C., and offered him a
job. The brothers quit school and plotted to sell themselves to Brown as a
package -- difficult, Maceo says, inasmuch as "James was too crazy about
Melvin." But Maceo fast-talked his way into a job as Brown's new baritone
saxophonist, even though he had barely played the big horn in his life.;   
That was in 1964. Ellis joined Brown's band in 1965, and Wesley in 1968.;   
In the late 1960s, when Ellis was the band's musical director, Brown had the
hardest working band in show business -- on the road 50 weeks a year. The
shows were exhausting for everyone, and their effect on the crowd was
hair-raising.;    Parker calls Ellis and Wesley to his hotel room to talk
about their old boss.;    Wesley: "It was pandemonium.";    Parker: "Before I
even got in the group, I had gone to see the show and that was one of the
things that astonished me. 'Cause I was still young and I didn't understand
how people who were supposed to be of stature in the community -- school
teachers and good church-going folks -- could be screaming and falling down in
a frenzy and carrying on. That was what was more interesting to me -- the
audience rather than the music. And I said, 'What is this thing he's got?' I
said, 'What the devil is it?' He knew how to work the audience.";    Wesley:
"And the show was so well put-together. I'd seen people like Bobby Bland and
Ray Charles -- but they just played the tunes. James had the lighting and the
sound and the costumes. He'd come out and sing 'If I Ruled the World.' Then
he'd go away and later he'd come back and it was the git-down thing. I was
amazed.";    Brown's concerts were built around the same principle as a gospel
show -- raising the temperature higher and higher. Parker served as back-up
emcee and back-up comic. He also played back-up to the guy who removed the
ermine cape from Brown's shoulders: "We used to call that 'throwin' the cape,'
" Parker remembers, laughing. "I must've done everything but front-office
work.";    It was a grueling, pressure-filled gig and Brown could be an
unreasonable boss: "I was part of the group and I seemed to be an integral
part of the show," Parker says, "so I thought, 'Why am I not compensated
more?' Because a lot of people were coming to the shows to see me play. I've
come to the reality that I have to make my own bed. James Brown's another
artist that I may work with at some time, but it'll never be as boss-employee
again. 'Cause I'm well into my own thing.";    In March, Parker's band will
tour Europe and record a follow-up album -- tentatively titled "Mo' Roots." A
week from Saturday, Parker will appear on "Saturday Night Live" with Bootsy
Collins and Deee-Lite. He is busy.;    "They'd have to come up with some real
big money to have me put this on the back burner again," he says. "It would
have to be almost unbelievable money."; (hbox);    Parker is finishing his
second set at Elario's Jazz Club in La Jolla.;    The band is playing "Soul
Power." There's a man in the audience named Anthony Young. Twenty years ago,
he used to watch his mother put on her hot pants for a night on the town: "I'd
say, 'Where are you going.' She'd say, 'I'm going to see James Brown.' I
remember my mother saying, 'You know, that James Brown -- he's all right. But
does he have a horn section!";    And now Young is hollering:;    "Blow Fred!
Blow, man! Blow!;    "Blow your horn, Maceo!";    There's pandemonium at
Elario's.;    The show breaks up a little before midnight, and Parker exits,
shaking hands with folks in the audience on his way out. He goes downstairs to
his room, changes clothes, grabs some coffee and stays up for hours, talking
about Brown, gabbing on the phone with the old friends who keep calling, and
finally retiring around 3 a.m.;    At 9 a.m., the band piles into its rented
van for the drive to Los Angeles. Wesley drives. Parker sits beside him. Ellis
is in the seat behind. Wesley pops a tape into the cassette player. It's a
1968 recording of a Brown concert in Dallas. Brown had a 15-piece big band at
the time, arrangements courtesy of Ellis who wears a small, delighted smile
now as the music begins.;    "Do you hear that?" shouts Parker, an astonished,
bug-eyed look coming across his face. He's punching the air in rhythm with the
horn section.;    "You were on tenor?" he asks Ellis.;    "No, I was alto. You
were tenor," Ellis answers.;    Brown sings "If I Ruled the World," his voice
high and light. It's the voice of a young man.;    Then Brown starts to mix it
up. He leads the crowd in "Say It Loud (I'm Black And I'm Proud)," then segues
into "Kansas City," which has a fantastic horn arrangement, played super-fast
and as tight as can be. The memories are all coming back. Parker, Wesley and
Ellis are anticipating each musical turn of phrase, pointing out all the
intricacies of the arrangements, laughing, marveling at how good it sounds 23
years later. Ellis leans forward in his seat so he's in a line with Wesley and
Parker and now all three are bobbing their heads in time with the music.;   
And then Parker's voice comes over the speakers -- he was emceeing the show,
it seems -- telling the crowd to cheer for "the young man who you made the No.
1 Soul Brother In America!";    And then Brown sings "Cold Sweat" and starts
to plead:;    "Maceo! I want you to play!;    "Maceo! I want you to play!";   
And there's the sound of Maceo's horn, getting down, snaking its way through
the stuttering funk beat. And Maceo Parker leans back in his seat in the van
and listens, as he heads north to the next gig.;  Maceo Parker; And Roots
Revisited, featuring Fred Wesley and Pee Wee Ellis;     Where: San Jose State
University Student Union Amphitheater, 211 S. 9th St., San Jose.;    When:

<HEAD>Don't Take Randy Newman Too Seriously</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Warning: The opinions expressed on Randy Newman's
records should not be taken too seriously.
   So don't be too offended when Newman urges the United States to
``drop the big one'' on its allies, or informs us that God considers
the human race to be little more than a source of amusement.
   He doesn't really mean it.
   But if you're a little sensitive, don't listen too carefully to
his new album, ``Land of Dreams,'' because you probably won't like
the song in which Newman abandons his wife and kids and tells his
despondent son, ``I want you to hurt like I do.''
   Those lyrics probably will get Newman in trouble. A press
conference will be hastily assembled and Newman will have to explain
his ``poorly chosen'' words.
   Don't laugh. It's happened to him before. Back in the 1970s,
Newman had a fluke hit single with ``Short People,'' which contained
the refrain ``short people got no reason to live.'' Listeners were
outraged at the ``bigotry'' of the 6-foot-plus Newman, causing the
song to actually be banned on some radio stations.
   ``It's amazing how sensitive people are about that thing. Billy
Crystal was supposed to be upset. You know what I think? It's pretty
clear,'' said Newman, who went on to let his offended listeners off
the hook. ``It's not really their fault; they're not used to irony
in songs. They're supposed to take the words at face value.''
   Newman, of course, isn't entirely blameless. Not that he really
dislikes short people, or believes that a poor, black child should
``roll with the punches'' as he sings on the new album.
   What gets him in trouble is he expresses the most controversial
opinions without a hint of distance. He doesn't sing about racism;
he sings as a racist.
   But Newman pleads artistic license: ``I'm not saying it. He's
doing it in the song, but I disagree.''
   Just as he disagrees with the obscene phone caller in ``Suzanne''
and the slave trader in ``Sail Away.'' But Newman can't deny a
certain affection for these and other sordid characters.
   ``You can laugh at some of these people,'' he said. ``They're so
insensitive. They lack such self-knowledge. The audience will laugh
becuase it's so hard, so rough. It's sort of a liberating thing.
Hopefully, we are better.''
   As sung in ``Dixie Flyer,'' the lead track of ``Land of Dreams,''
Newman was born in Los Angeles in 1943 and lived for a few years in
New Orleans. He came from a musical family _ movie music that is.
His uncle, Alfred, was a soundtrack conductor.
   Newman's own musical background was more contemporary. Fats
Domino was a favorite, so was Ray Charles. But Newman, a piano
player himself, was not looking to be famous.
   ``I never thought I'd be anything but a writer,'' Newman said.
``I never thought of performing or recording.''
   Newman got his first break in 1962 when his composition, ``They
Tell Me It's Summer,'' appeared as the B-side of a single by the
Fleetwoods.
   After having songs covered by such artists as the O'Jays, Little
Peggy March and Irma Thomas, his career received another boost in
1966 when Judy Collins performed his ``I Think It's Going to Rain
Today'' on her popular ``In My Life'' album.
   By 1968, the demand for Newman to make an album of his own had
become too strong to resist. John Lennon called him to say all the
Beatles had his demos, and Dusty Springfield included two Newman
songs on her classic ``Dusty in Memphis'' LP.
   ``I think A&amp;M and Warners had heard the demos,'' Newman said. ``I
was pulled into it rather than having any great ambition.''
   Warner Bros. won out and Newman's self-titled debut album came
out later that year. No one, not even Bob Dylan, could have prepared
listeners for a song like ``Beehive State,'' in which Newman, as the
representative of Utah at a national convention, pleads for his
fellow delegates to remember a whole country exists between Los
Angeles and New York.
   ``It was for people in the East,'' he said. ``In the West maybe
they don't know Delaware.''
   And in ``Davy the Fat Boy,'' Davy's only friend makes a deathbed
promise to the boy's parents that he will take care of their beloved
son, but proceeds to put poor Davy in a sideshow.
   Newman has made critically acclaimed albums such as ``12 Songs''
and ``Sail Away,'' but has failed to acheive major commercial
success.
   While it's no longer true that ``all combined, my records have
sold as many copies as James Taylor's last album sold in Des
Moines,'' as Newman once joked, his sales hardly come close to
George Michael or Whitney Houston.
   ``I wouldn't mind selling more records if it didn't change my
life enormously,'' Newman said. ``Why not a million instead of
300,000? But it might affect the nature of the audiences. When I
play a place much over 10,000, there's too much inattention.''
   He has never failed to be noticed by his peers, however. Newman's
songs have been used by Ray Charles, Linda Ronstadt, Art Garfunkel
and Etta James. Harry Nilsson recorded an entire album of his
compositions, and Newman's music was even used as the basis of the
off-Broadway show ``The Middle of Nowhere.''
   ``It's tremendously nice when someone good thinks that I'm very
good,'' he said. ``People who do this have always liked me, showbiz
folks. Harry Nilsson doing an album of my songs, it's what always I
wanted.''
   And Newman hopes listeners also appreciate his unique music.
   ``I'm interested in people who are a little off. Let the audience
figure out how I feel about them. Let them enjoy these people who
are worse off than we are.''

JAZZ SINGER HAILS FROM COUNTRY ROOTS; 
</P>
<P>
PROFILE: DESPITE HER DEVOTED JAZZ-BLUES FOLLOWING, MAXINE WELDON SAYS, "MY 
BASIC FEELING IS COUNTRY-WESTERN," WHICH SHE LEARNED TO LOVE FROM HER FATHER. 
SHE'S IN LAGUNA NIGUEL TONIGHT. 
</P>

<P>
It's 10 p.m. on a Friday night at Marla's Memory Lane in Los Angeles, and the 
crowd is getting impatient. It has heard a nifty five-piece band, led by 
trumpeter Bobby Rodriguez, blow through a couple of standards, and it listened 
while veteran comedian Renaldo Rey jabbered away on an assortment of colorful 
topics ("What are those blues singers talking about? Drink muddy water? Sleep 
in a hollow log? You'd have to be nuts!"). 
</P>
<P>
But then the band strikes up again, and suddenly Maxine Weldon is there, 
singing in hard, clear tones, swaying to a rocking-chair rhythm while her voice 
slides from a conspiratorial whisper into a full-blown cry. 
</P>
<P>
Her delivery is so genuine that members of the audience feel compelled to 
respond, offering encouragement, or nodding their heads and saying, "That's 
exactly how it happened." 
</P>
<P>
Weldon, who appears tonight at Laguna Niguel's Design Center South, offers the 
crowd some blues, jazz standards ("My Romance," "When I Fall in Love"), and an 
original entitled "Lend Me Your Life." She even does a country tune, Gary 
Stewart's "You're Place or Mine." But with a jazz quintet providing the 
instrumentals, the song's roots are hardly identifiable, even though her 
phrasing, as it is on almost every number, has that in-the-saddle, C &amp; W 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
"My basic feeling is country-Western," the singer said recently from her home 
in Beverly Hills. "A lot of the songs I do in my show are country-Western. They 
may not sound like country-Western songs because we're doing it without the 
guitar and we're doing it a little up, at a little faster tempo." 
</P>
<P>
The singer, born in Holdenville, Okla., and reared in Bakersfield, credits her 
father for childhood exposure to country. "My father loved country and Western, 
he was a great fan of Red Foley and Roy Acuff. I was, too, and I still enjoy 
it." 
</P>
<P>
But despite the fact that her father taught music and that she "was always 
involved in some music program or another," the kinds of music she heard at 
home were limited. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't listen to jazz and blues around the house at all because my 
parents were very religious. It was considered sinful to listen to it, that it 
was the devil's music. So the music that we could hear was picked for us. But 
we'd get out to hear other music; you know, go next door to a friend's house 
and hear whatever was going on at the time. Mainly it was Fats Domino, Ray 
Charles, the Platters, the Coasters." 
</P>
<P>
Weldon began her singing career after moving to Hawaii in 1959. It was there 
that she had a chance to work with respected vocalist Helen Humes. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned a lot of stage presence from her, which helped me to become a 
performer," Weldon said. "I was really young, about 18, when I worked with her, 
and she gave me a lot of direction." 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, the singer began a five-year stay in Japan, appearing at clubs and 
concerts in Tokyo as well as in Formosa, Korea, Thailand and Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
It was during this time that she met and performed on bills with fellow 
Americans Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald and Nat King Cole. But not all her 
engagements were so glamorous. "I worked a lot of clubs that had no English 
bookings at all so I had to learn to speak Japanese. It was quite an experience 
being a black woman living in Japan. I'm not surprised about what's happening 
there now because it was happening there then. It was very future-conscious and 
I was lucky to be a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
Back in the States in 1966, Weldon began making club appearances in Los Angeles 
and hit the TV circuit. She released a number of small-company albums in the 
1970s, but, despite one single for Columbia in 1975, she's never had a 
major-label album contract. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of difficulty with my kind of music at the time. They didn't 
really want to hear a black woman record country-Western music. I got a lot of 
negative feedback for that." 
</P>
<P>
But Weldon is confident that things will turn her way. 
</P>
<P>
"(Record companies) are a little more liberal now than before. Before they 
wanted you to sound like Aretha Franklin or Nancy Wilson. Well, I don't have 
that kind of sound, I don't sing like anybody else," she said. 
</P>
<P>
For her Design Center South appearance, Weldon will be backed by her usual 
band, which is led by trumpeter Rodriguez and includes saxophonist Louis 
Taylor, pianist Phil Wright, bassist Ricky Taylor and drummer Washington 
Rucker. 
</P>
<P>
While most singers prefer the quieter support of piano or a bass-piano duo, 
Weldon prefers a bigger challenge. "I like the big-band sound. I like working 
with horns, because I have a strong voice." 
</P>
<P>
She thinks the kind of music being written today is cause for optimism. 
"They're bringing romance back to music now. Before, the men were putting down 
women and the women were putting down the men. But now it's all about love and 
dancing close and looking together at the sunset. And I like that romantic kind 
of music." 
</P>
<P>
 Maxine Weldon appears tonight at Design Center South, 23811 Aliso Creek Road, 
Laguna Niguel, 8 p.m. Information: (714) 643-2929.

'MO BLUES' AND HARD BOP FROM BRANFORD MARSALIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
*** BRANFORD MARSALIS ET AL. "Music From 'Mo' Better Blues' "; Columbia 
</P>
<P>
This album by the Marsalis quintet, with Terrence Blanchard in the trumpet role 
played in the film by actor Denzel Washington, is an amalgam of hard bop, 
R&amp;B and other diversions and will appeal mainly to those who have seen the 
film. The title cut, and the ballad "Again Never," both composed by Spike Lee's 
father, Bill Lee, stand out. There are two versions of W.C. Handy's antique 
"Harlem Blues," updated and sung by Cynda Williams, the actress/vocalist who 
performed the songs on screen. Caveat: fast forward through "Pop Top 40," an 
out-of-context pseudo-pop affair, and "Jazz Thing," a simplistic pocket history 
of jazz in rap form. 
</P>
<P>
*** ANDRE PREVIN "Uptown" Telarc 
</P>
<P>
Previn edges even closer to pristine form in this, his second comeback-to-jazz 
celebration. Bassist Ray Brown is on hand again, and this time the guitarist is 
the long-respected Mundell Lowe. The subject matter helps: six Harold Arlen 
songs, seven Ellingtons, and one Duke-associated pop tune, "Five o'Clock 
Whistle." Previn nudges his way obliquely into a sensitive "Come Rain or Come 
Shine," and achieves a spiritual beauty on "Come Sunday." Except for the 
slightly hasty "It Don't Mean a Thing," everything swings with the utmost ease. 
</P>
<P>
**** TERRY GIBBS DREAM BAND "Volume Four: Main Stem" Contemporary 
</P>
<P>
This Gibbs CD is surely the livest live session on record. Here are 17 men and 
a woman (pianist Pat Moran) who think as one, captured with brilliant sound (by 
the late engineer Wally Heider) at the Summit, the Hollywood nightspot that now 
houses the Club Lingerie. The leader's vibes are ingeniously woven into the 
arrangements by Bill Holman, Shorty Rogers and Al Cohn along with booting 
contributions by such soloists as trombonist Frank Rosolino, reedmen Joe Maini 
and Richie Kamuca and drummer Mel Lewis, all sadly no longer around, as well as 
by trumpeter Conte Candoli and saxman Bill Perkins, who are still vitally among 
us. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 CYBILL SHEPHERD "Vanilla" Gold Castle 
</P>
<P>
At her best, actress/singer Shepherd has revealed a genuine talent with a jazz 
sensitivity; however, this reissue of a date made in 1979, after she had 
returned home to Memphis, is weighted down by a ragged band -- Fred Ford and 
his Beale Street Orchestra. Except for the inane title tune, most of the songs 
are jazz/pop standards. Still, there is a rare value here in the person of the 
late Phineas Newborn, a jazz piano giant, and his rhythm section -- his brother 
Calvin (guitar), Jamil Nasser (bass) and Bill Tyus (drums). Shepherd is in good 
voice on "My Ship" -- where Newborn has the first chorus to himself and where 
the band is too subdued to be disconcerting. Questions: Whatever became of that 
fine album she made backed by Stan Getz? Why doesn't she return now to the 
studios, to make the superior jazz session of which she is capable? 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 VINCENT HERRING "American Experience" Music Masters 
</P>
<P>
Herring, now 25, taped these sessions in 1986 and 1989 with two different but 
equally compatible hard bop groups. Heard recently in Nat Adderley's quintet, 
he has emerged as one of the most passionate new voices on alto and soprano 
saxophones. He is represented as a composer along with Charles Lloyd, Horace 
Silver and his pianist Bruce Barth. The earlier cuts, made when he was only 21, 
reveal that he had already reached a rare plateau of maturity. Herring has come 
a long way from the streets of Manhattan, where he was playing outdoors as 
recently as 1984. LEONARD FEATHER

<HEAD>Willie Nelson, Barry Manilow Have Music Specials on CBS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you're heavily into the Bon Jovi and the
Beastie Boys, you're in probably the only demographic group that
won't find something to like in two widely divergent music specials
offered by CBS.
   On Saturday, Willie Nelson is host of his own network special,
``Willie Nelson, Texas Style,'' a tribute to his home state which
he reveals in a soothing hour of country, rock and blues music
combined with an affectionate travelogue to some of his favorite
Lone Star places.
   Then on Monday, Barry Manilow pays homage to jazz and big band
music in ``Barry Manilow: Big Fun on Swing Street,'' set in an
imaginary neighborhood of break dancers, saxophone players and
blues singers, where the '40s meet the '80s.
   Manilow wasn't, shall we say, successful in his last network
venture, the 1985 CBS musical movie ``Copacabana,'' which marked
his acting debut. This time, he sticks to the music. There is no
dialogue in ``Swing Street,'' a bluesy, jazzy, coolly evocative,
extended music video.
   ``There's no dumb sketches on it. We did that on purpose,'' said
Manilow, during a recent break in the midst of his two-year tour.
``Bruce and Jack and I sat down and wrote a conceptual hour that
takes the viewer on a trip down this imaginary place called Swing
Street, during which we meet all the characters who inhabit Swing
Street, and they are played by the guests. There's no talking
except for the voiceovers, and it's all music, because I wanted to
do a music special with a capital M.''
   Bruce and Jack are Manilow's collaborators, Bruce Sussman and
Jack Feldman. Their concept also produced an album, ``Swing
Street,'' that features the performers on the special, plus Stan
Getz, who was in the hospital when the special was taped, Manilow
said.
   Sussman suggested that this kind of high-style music special is
the wave of the future on network television, which still tends to
rely on the standard host-guest-song-sketch kind of variety program.
   ``One of the problems with variety television is that MTV has
forever changed variety television, and it hasn't responded to
that,'' Sussman said. ``This is something else, it's not MTV, but
something that certainly has been influenced by that development.''
   ``Who knows whether this is going to make it rating-wise,'' said
Manilow, ``but what was definitely not making it was somebody
standing up there saying, `My next guest is Dionne Warwick, my next
sketch is,' you know. This sort of had a point of view, even if it
was odd.''
   The special includes Manilow songs such as ``Hey Mambo'' and
``Black and Blue,'' but also standards such as ``Summertime'' and
``Stardust.''
   Manilow's guests are jazz singers Carmen McRae and Diane Schuur
_ her duet with Manilow on ``Summertime'' is a show-stopper _
saxophonists Gerry Mulligan, Tom Scott and Dana Robbins, bass
player Stanley Clarke and singer Phyllis Hyman, plus the vocal
groups Full Swing and Kid Creole and the Coconuts.
   Nelson's special is as bright and sunny as Manilow's is dark and
smoky, with footage of Nelson walking around his Hill Country home,
playing host to his band members and friends on his golf course,
riding his bicycle down to Mona's Yacht Club for a game of dominoes
with the locals, and floating down the Rio Grande with jazz
guitarist Jackie King.
   Next door to the golf course is Willie's own recording studio _
dubbed ``Cut 'n' Putt'' _ where Bruce Hornsby does a session. Ray
Charles joins Willie at Alley Oop's on East Sixth Street in Austin,
and Asleep at the Wheel jams with him at Carl's Corner, a truck
stop.
   Willie also takes a sentimental tour of his boyhood home of
Abbott, Texas, where his sister Bobbie recalls their grandmother
tying young Willie up to keep him from running off.
   ``She staked him just like she did the cow,'' Bobbie laughs.
   ``That didn't stop me from running away,'' Willie recalls. ``It
slowed me down some.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   BLAKE HONORED _ Director Blake Edwards will be honored at the
second annual American Comedy Awards with the Lifetime Creative
Achievement Award. Edwards made such films as ``The Pink Panther,''
``Victor-Victoria, ``10,'' and more recently ``Blind Date'' and
``That's Life.'' The awards show will be broadcast May 17 on ABC.

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: REISSUES SPOTLIGHT VINTAGE R&amp;B 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles' Specialty Records will probably always be best remembered as the 
musical home of Little Richard, but the new "Legends of Specialty" reissue 
series demonstrates that the R&amp;B-oriented company was far more than a 
one-artist operation. 
</P>
<P>
Though Specialty also helped introduce such noteworthy post-World War II 
vocalists as Sam Cooke and Lloyd Price, the first six editions in the new 
series spotlight Jesse Belvin, Jimmy Liggins, Joe Liggins, Percy Mayfield, Roy 
Milton and Larry Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"This series is designed to expose the range and depth of our catalogue," said 
Beverly Rupe, president of Specialty and daughter of label founder Art Rupe. 
The next four albums in the series -- featuring Cooke and Price, among others 
-- will be released early next year. Each CD in the series, supervised by 
singer and pop historian Billy Vera, contains approximately two dozen songs. 
</P>
<P>
Eleven years before Little Richard's "Tutti Frutti" in 1956, Roy Milton 
released a double-sided hit ("R.M. Blues" and "Milton's Boogie") on Rupe's Juke 
Box Records that not only established Milton as a key figure in the evolution 
of R&amp;B, but also gave Rupe the capital to develop his record company, whose 
name he soon changed to Specialty. 
</P>
<P>
Of the other artists featured in the first group of albums, Larry Williams may 
be the best known to today's pop-rock audience because the Beatles recorded 
three of his songs: "Dizzy Miss Lizzy," "Bad Boy" and "Slow Down." 
</P>
<P>
Mayfield, however, is probably the most respected of the artists in this set. A 
singer and songwriter of exceptional talent, Mayfield's first Specialty hit, 
1950's "Please Send Me Someone to Love," remained his most popular record, but 
"Hit the Road, Jack," -- recorded by Ray Charles -- is probably his best-known 
song. 
</P>
<P>
But the Belvin album is in many ways the most intriguing, because his smooth 
vocal style so richly reflected the doo-wop strains of early Los Angeles 
R&amp;B that were defined by such records as the Penguins' "Earth Angel" (a 
song co-written by Belvin) and "Dream Girl" (a Belvin duet with Marvin 
Phillips). The album also includes a dozen previously unreleased tracks or 
demos -- most recorded for one of the labels John Dolphin ran in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
The Liggins brothers both dealt in an urban jump-blues style that, Vera points 
out in his liner notes, was a link between swing and rock. Joe, the elder 
Liggins, had the most hits, including "The Honeydripper" (on Exclusive Records 
in 1945) and "Pink Champagne" (on Specialty in 1950). 
</P>
<P>
IN THE STORES: Albums that are either new in CD or have been shifted from 
main-line to budget packages include volumes 1 and 2 of Joan Baez's "Joan Baez 
in Concert" (Vanguard), Bob Dylan's "Shot of Love" (Columbia), Fairport 
Convention's debut album (Warner Bros.) and Bette Midler's "Songs for the New 
Depression" and "Thighs and Whispers" (Atlantic).

<TEXT>  BOB SEGER; "The Fire Inside"; (Capitol; all formats); (star)(star); At one
time -- a long time ago -- Bob Seger was content to play that old-time rock
'n' roll. Nothing fancy; nothing frilly. He simply went for and with the gut.
And if he didn't have inspiration, he certainly had enthusiasm.;   But for the
past 10 years and more, Seger has dispensed with even that and released
records that have been sturdy, stolid and middle-of-the-road boring.;   Thus
it is with "The Fire Inside.";   There is a strapping Middle America feel to
this record, with its allusions to Ray Charles R&amp;B ("Always in My Heart") and
Cajun ("Sightseeing") and, yes, rock 'n' roll ("Which Way").;   But for the
most part, the record is dizzyingly dull, with Seger and "guests" Joe Walsh
and Bruce Hornsby and others going about their work like a group of fitters on
the Ford assembly line.;   He does approximate his old feel on one or two
songs -- such as "She Can't Do Anything Wrong." And the title cut does pound
away in the good old way. But the rest of the time, Seger's sappy singing is
proof that he no longer has the fire inside that is necessary to make that
old-time rock 'n' roll.; -- Harry Sumrall; MARIAH CAREY; "Emotions";
(Columbia; CD, cassette); (star)(star) 1/2; For almost a decade, it's been
altogether too easy to dismiss the entire mainstream pop-soul genre as a
wasteland of trite, vapid musical mush -- creatively bankrupt and increasingly
irrelevant since the advent of rap and alternative rock. Mariah Carey might
not be able to erase that perception, but at the very least her music is going
to force a lot of people to reconsider the viability of the genre.;   Last
year, Carey's debut album stunned a listening public that had been drugged
into a catatonic state by years of Lionel Richie &amp; Co. releases. In February,
her incredibly poised Cinderella-at-the-ball performance at the Grammys
charmed millions worldwide. Now, her sophomore release should prove she's no
one-hit wonder, but a major star who's going to be with us for quite some
time.;   "Emotions" is by far a tougher, sexier and flat-out better product
than Carey's ultra-glossy debut album. Rather than swathing her talents in
layers of cotton-candy instrumentation, Carey and co-producer Walter
Afanasieff decided to take the less-is-more approach -- and it works
beautifully. Carey's incredible eight-octave voice drives this disc. From the
four-star gospel-tinged ballad "If It's Over" (co-written by Carey and Carole
King) to the Donna Summer-esque dance-floor ditty "Make It Happen," this is a
pure power play.;   Most of this material is predictable saccharine drivel
(Robert Clivilles and David Cole, the production wizards behind the notorious
C&amp;C Music Factory, have a hand in all the dance-floor tracks), but listening
to Carey take a mediocre song and just whip it around is a sublime pleasure.
The woman has real soul and an instinctive sense of phrasing. She certainly
owes more of a stylistic debt to Tina Turner, Chaka Khan and Diana Ross than
she does to Whitney Houston and other contemporaries. I'm no fan of pop-soul
balladry, but I came away from "Emotions" with one overwhelming impression --
"Dang, has that girl got a set of pipes or what?"; -- David Plotnikoff; PROCOL
HARUM; "The Prodigal Stranger"; (Zoo; CD; cassette, LP); (star)(star); Procol
Harum -- now there's a name out of the past. Remember their great hits,
including "Conquistador," "A Salty Dog" and, of course, "A Whiter Shade of
Pale"?;   After a 15-year absence, the group has reformed and is touring the
United States. (They'll stop at San Francisco's Palace of Fine Arts on
Thursday). Unfortunately, "The Prodigal Stranger" sounds so anonymous it could
be a new release by, say, Steve Winwood.;   Part of the problem is lead singer
Gary Brooker, whose vocals on their '60s classics were so haunting, and who
now sounds as uninspired as the aforementioned Winwood -- as on "Perpetual
Motion.";   And the once-distinctive guitar of Robin Trower (who will be
replaced on the tour by Tim Renwick) is barely noticeable. (Two other early
Procol members, keyboardist Matthew Fisher and lyricist Keith Reid, also are
on board for the reunion. A new rhythm section features bassist Dave Bronze
and former Big Country drummer Mark Brzezicki.);   There are a couple of
exceptions, however. "(You Can't) Turn Back the Page" recalls the group's
earlier ballads with Fisher's swirling organ melodies and Brooker's soulful
vocal. Brooker also does a splendid job leading the multitude of voices on
"Holding On.";   But those moments are far too few. Maybe they should call
this "A Paler Shade of Procol."; -- Steve Marinucci; Jazz; THE VERY BIG CARLA
BLEY; BAND; (WATT/ECM; CD, cassette); (star)(star)(star)(star); In 1981, Bley
told me she was through breaking musical rules, that she wanted her band to
sound like Basie's. It was only half in jest: Her arrangements, renowned for
their humor, rapid shifts in time and texture, have begun to sound like
Ellington's.;   Like Duke, Bley writes memorable melodies and creates lush
tonal beds for soloists. Like Charles Mingus, she likes to pull the rug out.
And those broken rules, like a "wrong" chord from Thelonious Monk, have a way
of sounding great when our ears catch up.;   I'm delighted to report that
she's now caught up with herself. After two bizarrely out-of-character nods to
commercialism, "Night-Glo" and "Sextet," both small bands and both
forgettable, she made the lovely "Duets" with electric bassist Steve Swallow.
And in 1989, she stormed back with "Fleur Carnivore," a 15-piece band recorded
live in Copenhagen.;   The Very Big Band isn't live, but it's memorable. Taped
in Germany in October, it boasts 18 musicians, including most of the soloists
from "Fleur": Lew Soloff, trumpet; Andy Sheppard, tenor; Wolfgang Puschnig,
alto; and Gary Valente, trombone.;   There's a 15 1/2-minute suite, "United
States," a wonderfully quirky "Strange Arrangement," a church-meeting "Who
Will Rescue You?," the nursery rhyming "All Fall Down" and a Latin explosion,
"Lo Ultimo.";   Everything works. The writing is elegant, the voicings superb
(especially the use of the oboe and Swallow's bass guitar). The solos swing,
Sheppard in particular. I do miss the tuba from the old days, though.; --

LEGENDARY SAX MAN NOT MOODY ABOUT NEW LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Legendary sax man James Moody moved to San Diego in April and had his first gig 
in his new hometown Wednesday night at Elario's. 
</P>
<P>
Moody came west from Jersey City to live with his new wife, Linda, a real 
estate agent here. The two tied the knot April 3 in a ceremony at Faith Chapel 
in Spring Valley. Dizzy Gillespie served as best man and played a few pieces, 
including the solo from "Con Alma" as the couple walked in. 
</P>
<P>
"I love her as big as the sky," said Moody, still madly in love and poetic as 
always. He first met his wife during a gig at Catalina's in Los Angeles. They 
didn't see each other for about a year, then they hooked up again when Moody 
came to town to play at Elario's last December. Sparks flew and Moody says he 
had a hard time touring a short time later without her. 
</P>
<P>
"I called her every day. My hotel bill in Egypt for the week. . . . Wow! I was 
sending her two or three faxes a day." 
</P>
<P>
Moody recently spent two weeks in Hong Kong playing The Jazz Club. His new 
album "Sweet and Lovely," dedicated to the new missus, is scheduled for an 
August release. At Elario's, where he will play through Sunday, he'll be backed 
by Sherman Ferguson on drums, Bob Magnusson on bass and a pianist (perhaps 
Harry Pickens, Randy Porter or Art Resnick). 
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Lee Ritenour, who hits San Diego for Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay 
series Friday, feels strong ties to the music of Brazil. The best cuts on his 
last album "Festival" blend Brazilian melodies, rhythms and vocals with the 
driving funk of Marcus Miller's bass and percussion supplied by Brazilian 
Paulinho Da Costa. 
</P>
<P>
"Rit Colors," scheduled for fall release, also has some Brazilian flavor. 
Ritenour went to a funky studio in Salvador, in the Brazilian state of Bahia, 
to record a singer named Gonza Guinha for one cut. Most of the album's vocals 
are handled by Phil Perry, who will play with Ritenour in San Diego, along with 
Bob Wilson (former drummer in the fusion group Seawind), Ernie Watts on sax, 
Tim Landers on bass and Dave Witham on keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
Ritenour, also known as a top '70s studio musician for his work with Herbie 
Hancock, Steely Dan, Stanley Clarke and many others, has been a commercial 
success for years, but "Festival" is his hottest album yet. It has sold more 
than 200,000 copies since its release last October. 
</P>
<P>
With the earlier "Rio" and "Rit" both gold or close to it (500,000 copies), 
Ritenour is, along with Dave Grusin, one of the most commercially successful 
artists on the GRP contemporary jazz label, founded by Grusin and partner Larry 
Rosen. 
</P>
<P>
Talking Wood is a San Diego band built around the warm sounds of the African 
slit drum and is one of several bands scheduled to play the Second Annual Jazz 
Iz Forever, an all-day outdoor music festival this Saturday at the Educational 
Cultural Complex, 4343 Ocean View Blvd., in Southeast San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's concert was dedicated to local jazz singer Ella Ruth Piggee, who 
died of cancer. This year's is a tribute to Dr. Danny Scarborough, former head 
of the Afro-American Studies Department at San Diego State University and the 
director of the school's Black Repertory Dance Co. Scarborough, a prominent 
local educator, died of AIDS two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
Other bands that will appear during the 12-hour celebration, which begins at 8 
a.m., include Hollis Gentry's Neon, Forecast, Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham and 
their Sweet Baby Blues Band, Swell, Reel to Real, Escola Brazilian Experience, 
Immediate Freedom Latin Jazz Ensemble, Glenn Horiuchi Quartet, Ayana Hobson 
Trio, Charles McPherson Jr. and the Lila Smith Trio. The band War ("Cisco Kid," 
"Slipping Into Darkness") is a special guest. 
</P>
<P>
Percussionists Bill Thompson and Gregory Blakney form the nucleus of Talking 
Wood. Besides the slit drum (which is played with mallets), Talking Wood also 
incorporates imbira (African thumb piano), gourd rattle, African claves, 
tom-toms, and, from Java, hank lungs (bamboo percussion instruments). 
</P>
<P>
The heavily rhythmic sound includes a lot of improvisation. Nonstop 
performances typically last a half-hour or longer. Talking Wood hits the stage 
a 9 Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Hank Young, the bass player who once backed Earl "Fatha" Hines, will 
lead a group Friday evening at 5:30 at Magee Park on Carlsbad Boulevard, three 
blocks north of Elm in Carlsbad. . . . Also on Friday, Fattburger will play at 
the Chula Vista Shopping Center's lunchtime concert series. . . . San Diego 
pianist Mike Wofford joins pianist Harry Pickens for the second session of 
Pickens' "The Art of Improvisation" series next Wednesday at 7 p.m., at The 
Athenaeum in La Jolla. . . . Tonight is the Gaslamp's monthly "Arts and Jazz 
Stroll," a self-guided tour of galleries, artists' lofts and jazz venues. Pick 
up a program at Faith Nightingale Gallery, 535 4th Ave., in the Gaslamp 
Quarter.

JAZZ FANS ON LIST? LOOK NO FURTHER; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: SAN DIEGO IS HOME TO SOME TOP JAZZ TALENT, AND A LARGE SELECTION OF 
QUALITY MUSIC IS AVAILABLE FOR HOLIDAY GIFTS. 
</P>

<P>
Want to give the gift of jazz to your favorite music buff? 
</P>
<P>
You can walk the aisles of your major chain music store and fill your basket 
with the obvious big-name albums. 
</P>
<P>
Or you can take another approach: Why not turn your musical friend onto one or 
two of the many recordings made by San Diego musicians? 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's jazz scene is so low-key, most people aren't aware how much top 
talent is here. Yet those who follow it can vouch for the large quantity of 
recorded music -- excellent music -- available. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say there are at least 3 dozen albums," said Paul Lavoie, host of "San 
Diego Spotlight," the Sunday night local jazz program on KIFM (98.1). Lavoie's 
tastes run toward lighter, commercial jazz, but there are even more albums 
available by mainstream players. 
</P>
<P>
Jude Hibler, publisher of The Jazz Link, a monthly San Diego jazz journal, came 
up with a list of 77 musicians who have either recorded their own albums or 
played on sessions with other musicians. 
</P>
<P>
With the recent migration to San Diego by such top jazz players as sax man 
James Moody and guitarists Mundell Lowe and Barney Kessel, the list of recorded 
local talent grew even more impressive. 
</P>
<P>
The Tower Records on Sports 
</P>
<P>
Arena Boulevard is the place most often mentioned by local musicians as a 
source of their recorded music. Folk Arts Rare Records on Adams Avenue in San 
Diego stocks several hard-to-find albums by local players. 
</P>
<P>
Here, then, are some jazzy picks for your Christmas shopping list: 
</P>
<P>
* No lover of jazz saxophonists dating back to Lester Young, Charlie Parker or 
Coleman Hawkins should be without an album by Moody. His newest is titled 
"Sweet and Lovely." 
</P>
<P>
Moody, 64, is a survivor. He's played with the greats, and lived to assimilate 
their influences. Today, Moody's mood is buoyant, his playing at times melodic, 
witty, fiery. Old pal Dizzy Gillespie joins him for two tunes on the new album. 
</P>
<P>
* Another survivor is La Jolla saxophonist Charles McPherson, a sax master in 
his own right who has made several albums. Most recently, he played Parker's 
sax parts on the sound track for "Bird," the movie about the life of Parker. 
</P>
<P>
* Mike Wofford is one of San Diego's top jazz pianists. He is featured on Ella 
Fitzgerald's new album, due for release early next year, and he's done a number 
of notable projects of his own. One of his most critically acclaimed sessions 
is this year's "Gerald's People," on which Wofford tackles the music of veteran 
composer, band leader and trumpeter Gerald Wilson, with Rufus Reid on bass and 
Carl Burnett on drums. 
</P>
<P>
* Bassist Bob Magnusson, who often plays with Wofford, has several albums of 
his own, including the 3-year-old "Song for Janet Lee" with Hubert Laws, Bobby 
Shew, Peter Sprague and Billy Mintz, and earlier collaborations with such 
talents as Bill Mays, John Guerin and Hubert Laws. 
</P>
<P>
* Saxophonists Joe Marillo and Tony Ortega have both recorded albums over the 
years. Ortega's work ranges from the avant garde 1965 "Revelation" to the more 
mainstream 1979 "Rain Dance," including Ortega's wife Mona Orbeck on vibes. 
Neither has recorded recently, but a little sleuthing is bound to turn up the 
existing albums. 
</P>
<P>
* Paul Sundfor, the local alto sax man, is revered by local players. He has no 
albums as a leader, but he played on Wofford's 1987 "Funkallero" and also joins 
bassist Andy Simpkins on an album due in January. 
</P>
<P>
* Guitarist Peter Sprague has recorded several albums; one of the most 
satisfying was last year's "Na Pali Coast," featuring Sprague with the fine Los 
Angeles flutist Steve Kujala. Sprague and Kujala hooked up to create lilting, 
tropical melodies that do justice to the album's title, a reference to an area 
in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
* A pair of San Diego flutists also issued albums last year. Lori Bell's "Take 
Me To Brazil," a collaboration with pianist Dave Mackay, finds the pair putting 
their energy into melodic music, often anchored by Latin rhythms. Holly Hofmann 
recorded "Take Note" with Wofford on piano, Sherman Ferguson on drums and Bob 
Magnusson on bass. 
</P>
<P>
* In the realm of bluesy jazz are Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham, whose 1989 album 
"Back to the 'Hood," recorded with their Sweet Baby Blues Band, received raves 
from jazz critics across the country. 
</P>
<P>
* San Diego's avant-garde jazz scene is nearly invisible, but it does exist. 
Perhaps the most prolific of the cutting-edge local players is pianist Glenn 
Horiuchi, who, in the space of less than three years, has recorded three fine 
albums for the tiny Bay Area-based Asian Improv label. 
</P>
<P>
Horiuchi brings the frenetic energy of pianist Cecil Taylor to his roots in 
traditional Chinese music. 
</P>
<P>
* Also in the realm of cutting-edge jazz is the technically awesome San Diego 
pianist Harry Pickens, who can be heard on several Blue Note albums with the 
group Out of the Blue. 
</P>
<P>
* At the other end of the spectrum are several San Diego artists who have made 
it big with a lighter, commercial radio-oriented brand of jazz. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most impressive debuts was this year's "Architects of Change," by 
composer and keyboard wiz Spencer Nilsen. Instead of the soporific elevator 
jazz that often gets commercial play, Nilsen has built a complex wall of sound 
anchored by relentless pulsing rhythms over which he lays his powerful, 
synthesized melody lines. 
</P>
<P>
* Checkfield, a studio duo consisting of John Archer and Ron Satterfield 
(Archer "discovered" Nilsen) came out with "Through the Lens" last year, the 
band's third album. It doesn't have as much raw spunk as Nilsen's album, but as 
polished, multitracked studio projects go, this one is state of the art. 
</P>
<P>
Other local light jazz leaders are Neon, featuring Hollis Gentry, and 
Fattburger. Albums by both bands this year sold well and made it onto radio 
play lists across the country. The Mark Lessman Band and Flight 7 also released 
light jazz albums in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego also has its share of golden era jazz men, players with experience 
dating back to the big band days. 
</P>
<P>
Band leader Bob Crosby lives in La Jolla. Though he didn't play an instrument 
or read or write music, Crosby fronted a group of top musicians who defected 
from leader Ben Pollack in the '30s. With Crosby, they recorded several albums 
in the '30s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
Crosby bassist Bob Haggart, of La Costa, has made several albums with trumpeter 
Yank Lawson in The World's Greatest Jazz Band. They are available by mail 
(Audiophile Records, 1206 Decatur St., New Orleans 70116). 
</P>
<P>
During the years when Haggart was working with Crosby, San Diego trumpeter John 
Best was playing and recording with the big bands of Les Brown, Artie Shaw, 
Glenn Miller and others, and many of these albums can still be found. 
</P>
<P>
Several other names belong on this list, though there isn't room to discuss 
their work in detail: singer Frankie Laine, saxophonist Gary Lefebvre, singer 
Kevyn Lettau (with Sergio Mendes and Sprague), guitarist (and Padre pitcher) 
Eric Show, the South Market Street Band (Dixieland; buy their tapes at live 
dates); Art Resnick; Nelson Riddle Jr.; the San Diego State University Jazz 
Ensemble; clarinetist Bobby Gordon, Fro Brigham and many others.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO : BARITONE SAX IS IN GOOD HANDS WITH 
NICK BRIGNOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though difficult to master, the baritone sax can produce amazing sounds in the 
right hands. Unfortunately, few jazz players have chosen to make it their 
instrument of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Baritone sax player Nick Brignola's appearance this Saturday at 8 p.m. at the 
San Diego Convention Center is a rare opportunity to hear what this horn can 
do. 
</P>
<P>
The concert is the second in the three-part "Salute to the Masters" series 
being presented by the San Diego Jazz Society. Brignola's show will be a 
tribute to jazz saxophonist Charlie "Bird" Parker, generally considered one of 
the half a dozen most important jazz artists of the century. 
</P>
<P>
Brignola began his musical education as a schoolboy clarinetist, and switched 
to alto sax as he began to get serious about jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I found the baritone and that was it," Brignola said. "I was able to 
express my personality more." 
</P>
<P>
"Bird" was known for the lightning be-bop lines he invented on alto, and one 
might expect that Brignola would have a tough time rekindling Parker's memory 
on the larger, more air-consuming baritone. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter what instrument I pick up, it translates the music inside me," 
Brignola said. "The instrument is just a vehicle. I feel I can play different 
horns with equal facility, but I've worked hard at it. I may be one of few who 
can do it. It's hard, rather like a trumpet player picking up a tuba." 
</P>
<P>
Brignola, who names baritone sax predecessors Harry Carney and Pepper Adams as 
influences, has long been a favorite of jazz purists. A New York Times writer 
last year referred to his "full, hard-bottomed sound and . . . urgent, 
swaggering attack." In various jazz polls, he's consistently named by critics, 
fans and peers as the top baritone player. 
</P>
<P>
During the '50s, Brignola leaned toward the West Coast cool-jazz sound being 
pioneered by players such as Paul Desmond, Stan Getz and Bud Shank. "It was 
easy to learn -- palatable music," he said. But when he sought something more 
challenging, he became a be-bop convert, with Parker as his main guru. (Parker 
died when Brignola was still a teen-ager, and the two never met.) 
</P>
<P>
"On a Different Level," Brignola's new recording, should be in stores any day. 
It pits Brignola with drummer Jack DeJohnette, pianist Kenny Barron and bassist 
Dave Holland. 
</P>
<P>
"The improvisations were going to be very esoteric, so we decided to use 
standards so listeners could hang their hats on it," he said. "There's music by 
Ornette Coleman, Charles Mingus, Jerome Kern, Duke Ellington, Tadd Dameron. It 
was designed to let me do my thing like I do on the job. Some cuts are a little 
longer than normal air play time." 
</P>
<P>
The lack of great commercial success doesn't bother Brignola, who said he is 
lucky to sell 15,000 or 20,000 copies of his recordings. "Pure jazz was never 
meant to appeal to the masses. Anybody selling over 40,000 records would be 
suspect." 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, Brignola, who plans to bring both soprano and baritone saxes, 
will be supported by pianist Frank Strazzeri -- whose meandering improvisations 
sometimes call to mind Thelonious Monk -- plus trumpeter Jimmy Noone, drummer 
Tootie Heath and bassist John Leitham. The material will lean heavily on 
Parker's own compositions and his versions of popular jazz standards. 
</P>
<P>
The new album by San Diego's own Checkfield, "A View from the Bridge," is the 
strongest yet from the duo of Ron Satterfield and John Archer. The pair, both 
experts with mixing boards, synthesizers, guitars, vocals and keyboards, 
brought in top players, including San Diegans Peter Sprague, John Rekevics, 
Mark Hunter, John Leftwich and Duncan Moore, plus out-of-towners such as 
guitarist Pat Kelley, flutist Steve Kujala and violinist Darol Anger. Where 
earlier albums from Checkfield were technically polished but lacking in punch, 
the new project is more dynamic. 
</P>
<P>
Out of 11 songs, all composed by Checkfield, "Conjuring" stands out, with its 
African and tropical rhythms providing the backbeat for Kujala's soothing 
flute. Anger's soaring violin lines are impressive on several cuts. The album 
includes more singing than past Checkfield efforts. Archer and Satterfield have 
serviceable voices, but their lyrics sometimes get too singsong and cute. The 
album is due to be in stores next week. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego flutist Lori Bell and her musical soul mate, L.A. pianist Dave 
Mackay, play Words &amp; Music Bookstore in Hillcrest Friday and Saturday 
nights, and the Salmon House restaurant on Mission Bay on Sunday night. They'll 
work as a duo Friday and Saturday and be joined by drummer Barry Farrar and 
bassist Bill Andrews on Sunday. Bell and Mackay are shopping around a demo tape 
that includes five new songs in the more commercial, light-jazz direction they 
began with the song "The Goose Is Loose" from their last album, "Take Me to 
Brazil." At Words &amp; Music, their repertoire will include several originals, 
plus music by George Gershwin, Michel Legrand and Charlie Parker. Bell's song 
"Waltz for Joe," written for San Diego pianist Joe Azarello, is included on a 
new Japanese release from local pianist Mike Wofford titled "All Alone." 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Open Channel, the new electric-jazz band fronted by San Diego guitarist 
Jim Storey and including top local saxophonist Steve Feierabend, plays the Del 
Mar Hilton this Friday and Saturday nights and again next weekend. Vocalist 
Cath Eckert will perform with the band and may join it permanently if the 
chemistry is right. . . . Sunday night from 7 to 8, the Claude Bolling Big Band 
is featured on "Le Jazz Club," the French program imported to KSDS-FM (88.3). . 
. . Jazz artists such as local pianist Glenn Horiuchi have incorporated 
authentic Oriental influences into their music. Friday night at 8, the real 
thing can be heard at UC San Diego's Price Center Theatre, as Silk and Lace, 
the orchestra of the Chinese Music Society of North America, performs several 
classical and modern Chinese works.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: PAPA JOHN CREACH STILL KICKIN' AROUND 
THE STYLES 
</P>

<P>
Violinist Papa John Creach would like to record another album someday, but his 
style seems too elusive for commercial tastemakers. 
</P>
<P>
"They can categorize me, all right. They can say, 'He plays everything,' " 
joked Creach, who opened three weeks at Elario's in La Jolla last night. "I 
haven't recorded in a while, and I don't know which way to go. It's really a 
confusing operation with me. I play sweet stuff, rock, blues and jazz. You 
can't mix all that up together on a recording. It would be too confusing for a 
commercial operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I like all of it. It really keeps me kickin,' " said Creach, who turns 73 next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
Audiences don't have any trouble warming up to his wide-ranging sets. Although 
he's best known to some for the soaring, electric sound he added to the 
Jefferson Airplane in the early 1970s and the Airplane offshoot Hot Tuna, 
Creach is a walking encyclopedia of jazz, rock and blues who first plugged in a 
violin in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he has slowed his touring pace, but still likes to work with 
young musicians. He goes on the road regularly with such rock bands as the 
Dinosaurs, visits Elario's annually and plays regularly in clubs not far from 
his home near Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Creach has arrived at the ideal formula for producing his 
trademark warm, fat sound. 
</P>
<P>
"I need a violin that cuts through the music. A soft tone is too mushy. I 
usually use a Romanian fiddle made in the 1800s. Lots of guys take one song and 
they wear out a bow. Doug Kershaw's a good example. But I don't press too hard 
on the strings. That gives me a nice, big, fat, round tone." 
</P>
<P>
When Creach taped one of KPBS-TV's (Channel 15) "Club Date" programs in San 
Diego two years ago, he was backed by a trio of locals. For this visit, he 
imported regular band mates Duane Smith on piano and Maurice Miller on drums 
from Los Angeles, to be joined by San Diegan Bob Magnusson on bass. 
</P>
<P>
Trombonists generally function as background players, but singer Aubrey Fay has 
made the big brass a mainstay of his stage act. Fay, who plays the B Street 
Cafe in downtown San Diego tonight through Saturday, first realized the horn's 
potential when he heard one of the greats. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm talking about my idol, J. J. Johnson. He redefined the instrument with 
speed. Before him, Kid Ory was more of a slur-gliss player," Fay said, 
referring to the slow, sliding style of playing that was popular during jazz's 
early years. "When I was learning, all parts with sixteenth or eighth notes 
were omitted for trombone. Then J. J. came along and changed all that with the 
shotgun style of staccato, short notes." 
</P>
<P>
Fay, both a singer and a horn player, grew up around music. 
</P>
<P>
"Jazz took over for me at an early age. My dad used to play it a lot. The guy's 
a nut over jazz -- not a musician, but a big fan. When I said I wanted to play 
trombone, it didn't knock him out, but he was kind of excited. At 5 years old, 
I knew who Basie, Ellington and Glen Miller were. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a guy named Mr. Coady who ran Coady's School of Music on Broadway in 
downtown San Diego. I was in parochial school, and they came to demonstrate the 
instruments. I remember this guy, Bart Hazlett, had a Dixieland band, and he 
came in and played 'Stars and Stripes Forever' with these great slides, and I 
said, 'I gotta have that.' " 
</P>
<P>
Fay continued with the trombone at St. Augustine High School, San Diego City 
College and San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
It was a fluke when he discovered his singing talent. As a young professional, 
he was working with a band in San Diego clubs, and one night the male singer 
didn't show up. 
</P>
<P>
"Lou Rawls was real popular at the time, 'Your Good Thing Is About to Come to 
an End.' I thought I could sing it. Well, I brought the house down, and that 
was the beginning right there." 
</P>
<P>
These days, the Aubrey Fay Band mixes diverse music, from bop to popular tunes. 
</P>
<P>
"People will hear mainstream, be-bop stuff like 'Billy's Bounce,' I'll play 
that on trombone, then I'll turn around and sing a blues like 'I'd Rather Drink 
Muddy Water' or 'Every Day I Have the Blues.' 
</P>
<P>
"The scat thing seems to be popular. I take 'On Broadway' or some other 
contemporary tune and incorporate improvising. Or songs like 'Stormy' or 'Me 
and Mrs. Jones.' I've got my own style, but it reminds people of Lou Rawls." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the club scene, Fay recently played on the sound track for a children's 
TV pilot called "Down Munchkin Alley," taped in Fallbrook. He writes his own 
music and hopes eventually to self-produce a CD of all-original tunes.

   When it comes to video biography, no one's doing it better than "American Masters" (Mondays, 9 p.m. ET, on PBS). 
Now in its third season, this lively series has profiled American treasures from Buster Keaton to Truman Capote, from George Gershwin to Isaac Bashevis Singer. 

   This summer, the series (executive produced by Susan Lacy) returns with another all-star lineup of creative artists: film maker William Wyler, photographer Andre Kertesz, the Algonquin Round Table, painter Diego Rivera, sculptor Augustus St. Gaudens. 
It also offers musical royalty -- the Duke of jazz and the queen of soul. 

   Tonight and next Monday night, "American Masters" will present a two-part retrospective on Edward Kennedy Ellington: "A Duke Named Ellington" (produced by Terry Carter, written by Leonard Malone). 
Creator/arranger of more than 2,000 pieces -- including "Satin Doll" and "Take the A Train" -- Duke Ellington is a mammoth figure in American music. 
Perhaps more than any other single person, he shaped jazz as we know it today. 

   Early in the 1920s -- the jazz age -- Duke Ellington came to New York to make his mark. 
Getting a gig up at Harlem's Cotton Club, he and his band backed the song-and-dance numbers. 
The advertisements for the all-white audience labeled their sound "jungle music," but Mr. Ellington was soon turning out the most sophisticated and delicate of harmonies: "Mood Indigo," "East St. Louis Toodle-oo" and "Creole Love Call." 

   For this suave bandleader and his satin sound, the 1930s and 1940s were the glory years. 
He and his orchestra became world famous, even starring in Hollywood movies. 
But by the '50s, big bands were out, be-bop was in, and no one wanted to hear from the Duke. 

   It was the toughest challenge of Mr. Ellington's career. 
Revitalizing his sound and moving into "modern" jazz, he took the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival by surprise with "Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue." 
That performance was a breakthrough, and it led to a long and rich final creative phase, including extended works -- ballets and sacred pieces. 

   Duke Ellington was said to "play his orchestra like an instrument," and interviews with band members Clark Terry, Ben Webster and Jimmy Hamilton -- and Mr. Ellington himself -- show how the Duke created works for his specific musicians. 
We learn about Ellington as musical inventor -- how he experimented with unusual "cluster" voicings. 
And best of all, we see minutes and minutes of wonderful performance footage of the Ellington band in Europe, never before shown here. 

   But if "A Duke Named Ellington" gives us a solid sense of Ellington the musician, it offers almost no picture of Ellington the man. 
Over two hours, you get desperate to know -- what was he like? 
The film doesn't say. 
The few clues we get don't add up to much. 
"I never saw Duke lose his temper." 
Cut to "Duke got mad at Johnny Hodges once -- they were arguing -- Duke just picked him right up." 
Cut to "Duke and Johnny, they were just {close as can be}." 

   Issues of race and racism would seem to be central to the Duke Ellington story, but film maker Carter touches on them only enough to tantalize us, no more. 
Musician Herbie Hancock says Mr. Ellington "deserves as much or more attention as George Gershwin, and he didn't necessarily get it." 
An interesting charge -- and one that's never developed. 

   Mr. Ellington gets a wry, if cryptic, last word, when a gauche interviewer asks him about "the music of your people" in one clip: "My people? 
Which are my people? 
Piano players? 
Those who aspire to be dilettantes? 
Those who attempt to produce something? 
Those who appreciate Beaujolais?" 

   Aretha Franklin probably wasn't one of Duke Ellington's people, but from "Aretha Franklin: The Queen of Soul" (Aug. 22), it's hard to tell. 

   Raised by her father, a powerful Detroit minister, the Reverend C.L. Franklin, Aretha grew up surrounded by music in the church and at home, where Sam Cooke, Jackie Wilson and Oscar Peterson would drop by. 
At the age of 14, she was out performing with her father on the gospel circuit. 
By 17, she had two children. 
By 20, she was a pop superstar. 

   If you want to find out more about Aretha, you'd better go to the library, because this documentary (written by Nelson George and produced by Kirk D'Amico) won't tell you. 

   Sure, there are celebs like Whitney Houston, Ray Charles and Keith Richards mouthing celeb statements. 
George Michael says "She's the best." 

   So many questions are left unanswered. 
Allusions to tragic relationships, illegitimate children and nervous breakdowns -- all sorts of weird and unhappy stuff -- fly by without explanation. 
What can you expect from a film that opens with ". . . in soul, there's only one queen. 
Her name -- Aretha Franklin." 
Cut to Ms. Franklin proclaiming, "In 1962, I was crowned the queen of soul." 
Puff piece? 
Did anyone say, puff piece? 

   But, as in the Ellington portrait, the music here redeems all sins. 
From "Respect" to "Dr. 
Feelgood," from "I Never Loved a Man" to "Chain of Fools," Aretha belts and squalls and soars through these tunes. 
If you like this music -- so profane, so sacred -- you won't be disappointed by this documentary, whatever its flaws. 

   But the "American Masters" programs -- at their best -- offer both the art and the artist. 
Last year's look at Isaac Bashevis Singer, for example, was a wonderful, glowing portrait, crammed to the edges with vivid details about the man and his work. 
The Duke and the queen deserve nothing less.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO; 
</P>
<P>
UCSD JAZZ DIRECTOR TO JOIN PROTEGES IN PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Jimmy Cheatham, the San Diego trombonist who leads the Sweet Baby Blues Band 
with wife, Jeannie, a vocalist and pianist, will make a rare appearance before 
a San Diego audience next Wednesday, putting the UC San Diego Jazz Ensemble 
through its paces in a show at Mandeville Auditorium on campus. Cheatham is a 
professor of music at UCSD, directing the jazz program. 
</P>
<P>
Can San Diegans expect to hear him play? 
</P>
<P>
"They'll hear me play the orchestra," joked Cheatham, who wants the jazz 
program at UCSD to be "strongly based in the black musical experience, the 
Kansas City style, from Bennie Moten to Count Basie and Fletcher Henderson, 
from Ellington to Thad Jones." 
</P>
<P>
The performance will showcase Cheatham's proteges in a variety of formats, from 
a 25- to 30-piece big band that includes an Afro-Cuban percussion section, to 
solos and duos. "Lucumi Macumba Voodoo," something of a production number, even 
includes singers and calypso dancers. 
</P>
<P>
During the show, Cheatham will hand out awards to the students, including one 
from the National Assn. of Jazz Educators that the ensemble received at last 
January's NAJE convention in San Diego, along with several school awards for 
best individual and group performances during the year. 
</P>
<P>
As for the Sweet Baby Blues Band, its fourth and newest album, "Back to the 
Neighborhood," has generated heavy demand. For the uninitiated, the band's 
all-star lineup includes trumpeters Snooky Young and Clora Bryant; reed men 
Dinky Morris, Jimmie Noone, Curtis Peagley and sometimes Herman Riley, plus Red 
Callender on bass and John (Ironman) Harris on drums. They will be gone most of 
the summer touring, with stops later this month at Joe Siegel's Jazz Showcase 
in Chicago and the Blue Note in New York City, where they set house attendance 
records last September. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans hungry for a dose of Baby Blues should consider a trip to Hollywood 
this Friday or Saturday night, where the band plays the Vine Street Bar &amp; 
Grill. Tickets for the UCSD show are $5, or $3 for senior citizens and 
students. 
</P>
<P>
Jazz clarinet players haven't had an easy go of it in the latter half of this 
century. When big bands gave way to be-bop in the '40s, the clarinet didn't 
make the transition as readily as trumpets and saxes. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, clarinetist Buddy DeFranco, who opened a two-week run at Elario's 
with vibraphonist Terry Gibbs on Wednesday night, stood by his instrument. 
Unlike Benny Goodman, DeFranco was one of the few clarinet players to expand 
his repertoire into the realm of bop, a challenge on an instrument that 
requires precise technique. 
</P>
<P>
After spending the '40s in several of the major big bands, he joined Count 
Basie for two years, beginning in 1950, then led his own small groups through 
the '50s. He spent eight years with the Glenn Miller Orchestra, then formed a 
group with Gibbs in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Gibbs, a veteran of the big bands of Woody Herman, Tommy Dorsey and Benny 
Goodman, played in smaller groups with Sam Jones, Louis Hayes and Kenny 
Burrell, among others. His aggressive, precise mallet attack provides both 
rhythmic and melodic counterpoint to DeFranco's horn. It's an unusual and 
provocative pairing. 
</P>
<P>
You must have heard San Diego jazz pianist Randy Porter somewhere, in a duo at 
the Horton Grand Hotel, or backing local players such as Steve Feierabend, or 
in Palm Desert recently, behind jazz singer Diane Schuur. He'll also be on 
stage with her in August at Humphrey's. 
</P>
<P>
At 26, Porter is shaping a promising career. For a young musician, he shows 
surprising taste and restraint, his solos are melodic and never cluttered, his 
backup work is sparse, with just enough chords and embellishments to push a 
soloist. 
</P>
<P>
Porter was exposed to both jazz and classical music at an early age by his 
older brother, also a musician. In 10th grade at Hoover High School in San 
Diego, he hesitantly volunteered to solo during a school big band practice 
session. Afterward, the instructor came over and laid a penny on the piano, a 
rarely given sign of approval. 
</P>
<P>
Though Porter's tendency is toward the straight-ahead side of jazz, he has 
dabbled in electronics and fusion. He was a member of Hollis Gentry's Neon 
until about a year ago, and wrote two of the songs on the band's new album: 
"Jacoby Creek" and "Song for Symon." 
</P>
<P>
Porter writes often. He recently recorded 11 originals with Hank Dobbs on bass 
and Billy Mintz on drums. Sometime soon, he may make cassettes of the session 
available. You can hear him June 12 at Croce's downtown with an acoustic 
quartet, and Fridays through June with singer Ellen Johnson at the Bucharest 
restaurant in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Hiroshima, whose music is a slick fusion of traditional Japanese music 
and instruments with jazz and modern electronics, appears June 7 and 8 at 
Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay. The group just finished performing the 
autobiographical musical "Sansei" at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. Its 
new album is titled "East.". . . . San Diego jazz guitarist Peter Sprague plays 
June 2 with a quintet at the Book Works/Pannikin at Flower Hill Mall in Del Mar 
and June 4 with JazzBrasil, including singer Kevyn Lettau, at the Full Moon 
Cafe, 485 1st St., Encinitas. . . . Those who heard Joe Henderson and George 
Cables during their recent two-week gig at Elario's seemed to agree that the 
real chemistry was not between the two headliners, but between pianist Cables 
and bassist Marshall Hawkins. . . . San Diego flutist Lori Bell was the guest 
on KIFM's mainstream jazz show Sunday night, and the music selected by her and 
host Steve Huntington included a quirky version of Kermit the Frog's song about 
being green, sung by pianist Dave Mackay, Bell's frequent musical partner.

<HEADLINE>  GRAMMYS DO THE RIGHT THING
MONEY TAKES A BACK SEAT TO TALENT AS A GRIZZLED
VETERAN AND A BUDDING STAR DESERVEDLY DOMINATE
THE AWARDS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story
Additional information attached to the end of this article.
See related stories pages 1C and 10C of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In case it sounded too far-fetched, let me repeat. The good guys won. You
may cheer quietly now.;    Four-decade veteran Quincy Jones almost made a
clean sweep of the seven categories he was nominated in. His only loss was to
Angelo Badalamenti in best pop instrumental performance. His six Grammys raise
his career total to 25 -- the most for any pop artist.;    Backstage, a
positively glowing Jones told the assembled throng: "I've won 25 now, but I've
also lost 57 times. And believe me, I don't take it for granted." Jones, who's
been a hidden power behind hundreds of artists from Dizzy Gillespie and Ray
Charles to Michael Jackson and rapper Big Daddy Kane, proved convincingly that
experience can win over youth and cashbox muscle. Essentially, Jones was
honored for mustering a busload of his famous friends and creating an album,
"Back on the Block," that was wide-ranging enough to be honored in every
category except polka. He should have won the Grammy for best casting.;   
Twenty-year-old Mariah Carey, on the other hand, earned her two Grammys the
old-fashioned way: with solid songwriting and singing. The newcomer took best
new artist and best pop vocal performance/female, beating veteran heavyweights
Bette Midler and Whitney Houston on the latter.;    The big losers during the
six-hour marathon of congratulations were the pop trio Wilson Phillips, who
won none of the four categories in which they were nominated; Sinead O'Connor,
who won only the most minor of the four categories she ran in; and Phil
Collins, who was one for eight for the night. Granted, Collins won the one
that counts: record of the year. Vanilla Ice walked away empty-handed.;    The
Grammys are a unique and ornery beast. It's not a pure popularity show like
the vacuous American Music Awards. Nor is it a pure celebration of cashbox
clout. And never, never, has it been a good arbiter of artistic merit.;    The
annual rite -- played out for a live audience of 6,000 and a television
audience in 60 countries -- is a separate reality glimpsed through the eyes of
the 6,000-plus voting members of the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp;
Sciences. And, what a wacko world it is:;    A world in which a deceased
Leonard Bernstein can compete against (and lose to) Oakland-born rap superstar
M.C. Hammer in the best music video category. A world in which Neil Young's
song "Rockin' in the Free World" can be nominated for best rock vocal
performance -- even though it doesn't appear on his 1990 album. A world where
Jimmy Stewart, John Kennedy Jr. and Kyle MacLachlan of "Twin Peaks" can lose
the best spoken-word recording to George Burns (at 95, the oldest nominee).;  
 The tempest in a teapot over boycotting nominees Sinead O'Connor and Public
Enemy was not a major factor in the show. It was as if the Clash told
Buckingham Palace they wouldn't be stopping by for dinner. Bloody big deal.
The militant rap group Public Enemy, which had boycotted the awards because
the rap segment in which they were competing was not televised, lost to Quincy
Jones and a posse of his friends during the first minute of the ceremony.;   
O'Connor's absence was good for a dark laugh when the Celtic singer stole the
best alternative music performance from the Replacements. The hapless
presenter managed to mumble the stock "I'm sure she wishes to express great
thanks to the members of the Academy" before bursting out laughing.;    That
wasn't the only bug that was dismissed as a laughing matter Wednesday night.
Host Garry Shandling joked about the Milli Vanilli-gate fallout in his opening
monologue. If the Academy is still stung by last year's fiasco with the
lip-syncing Eurotrash boy-bimbos, it didn't show.;    The first major-league
communal groan of the night came early in the telecast as the camera flashed
across the smirking mug of Vanilla Ice as he reacted to M.C. Hammer's
performance. His what-me-worry attitude didn't last long. Moments later,
Hammer bested him in the best rap solo performance category. Too bad the
camera wasn't there to watch Ice's pompadour wilt like a week-old head of
lettuce.;    Backstage, Hammer cradled his three trophies and tried to put the
best face on the so-called rivalry between him and Ice. "I don't blame him at
all. His record company saw an opportunity to paint this as a black and white
thing. A good boxing match. After I stopped laughing, I said, 'Oh? what's
next?' Really -- I don't blame him at all.";    In addition to the three
awards he received, Hammer was a savvy pick for album of the year, but it was
swept away by Jones.;    Schmaltz did win in a major category, as Julie Gold
bagged the top songwriter's award, song of the year, for "From a Distance,"
the song made into a Desert Storm cry of hope by Bette Midler.;    Carey
looked and sounded like a natural winner from the start. She was sexy,
composed and in excellent voice as she sang "Vision of Love." Partly, she was
impressive because many other of the performance segments contained material
so limp it couldn't stand up with the aid of a crane.;    Backstage, when
asked if she considers herself a pop artist or an R&amp;B artist, she replied
coolly: "I consider myself a singer/songwriter. I don't think I should
categorize myself as pop. I'm grateful for any nomination.";    As a group,
Bay Area artists did not fare well. Palo Alto native Michael Hedges lost in
the best new age performance category to Mark Isham. Peninsula sax legend Stan
Getz lost to Quincy Jones in the best jazz fusion performance category and
lost to Oscar Peterson in best jazz instrumental performance soloist. Redwood
City boogie king John Lee Hooker, Novato slide guitar ace Roy Rogers and San
Francisco bluesman Taj Mahal lost to B.B. King in the best traditional blues
recording category. Bobby McFerrin lost in the jazz vocal performance/male
category to wunderkind Harry Connick Jr.;    Some high points in the
six-hour-long day's journey into night (only 17 of the 78 categories were
awarded on the air): Shandling did an excellent job with an almost-impossible
assignment, keeping the show loose and flowing through the long, awkward
telecast. Bob Dylan's blistering unscheduled performance just before he
received a lifetime achievement award from Jack Nicholson was one for the
history books. (Lifetime achievement awards also went to Marian Anderson, John
Lennon and Kitty Wells.);    Jazz guitarist Stanley Jordan put on a
mind-boggling, dead-on-perfect one-man recital that included playing two
electric guitars at once. You had to see it to believe it.;    "Robert
Johnson: The Complete Recordings," the best historical work on pre-rock to
come out in years, won in its category -- best historical album.;    For every
high point, there were corresponding glitches, atrocities and unspeakable
acts.;    Even the great blues diva Ruth Brown couldn't save the first dozen
awards of the long, pre-telecast portion. Thanks to a flurry of pre-telecast
no-shows (most notably M.C. Hammer, who won a pair of early awards), virtually
the entire first hour of the show was deader than an old Christopher Cross
eight-track tape. Tracy Chapman's leaden, lethargic and off-key rendition of
John Lennon's "Imagine" was a major wince event.;    The most tasteless moment
-- and there were plenty of nominees in that category -- came during Billy
Idol's mysterious opening skit to his "Rock the Cradle of Love" performance in
which he appeared to molest a winsome teen who came to his door.;  RECORD OF

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO : BASIE BAND ALUMNI TO PLAY AT FIRST 
'SALUTE TO MASTERS'

Count Basie fronted some of the greatest big-band lineups of all time, 
including several jazz men who left their mark on the music. Alto saxophonist 
and Basie alum Marshal Royal was one such key player. Royal, who joins fellow 
Basie band graduate Joseph Wilder on Saturday night for the first of the San 
Diego Jazz Society's "Salute to the Masters" series, is well aware of his 
contribution to Basie's band. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what he learned from the association, Royal replied: 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have to learn anything. I put his new band together in 1951. He 
learned from me. After I left the band, it never sounded the same." 
</P>
<P>
Royal isn't shy about what it was lacking. 
</P>
<P>
"Me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The intent of the jazz society's series is to keep jazz history alive. Royal, 
too, believes this is important. He's always believed in the traditional forms 
of improvisation: solos with a melody even casual listeners can follow. 
</P>
<P>
"Common melodies, simple melodies are sometimes more important than 
structures," he said. Yet he keeps his mind open about music. "I don't dislike 
any music. There are really only two kinds: good and bad." 
</P>
<P>
Royal and trumpeter Wilder actually played together for the first time in 1940 
in Lionel Hampton's band. This Saturday's concert is a tribute to Duke 
Ellington and Ellington band member and composer Billy Strayhorn. 
</P>
<P>
Royal, who has worked with Ellington, Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughn, Art Tatum, 
Lena Horne, Tony Bennett, Ray Charles, Benny Carter, Quincy Jones, Joe Williams 
and Linda Ronstadt, prefers a big-band setting. 
</P>
<P>
"With a big band, you have good backgrounds for solos. It showcases you 
better." 
</P>
<P>
Wilder's background is more varied, including extensive radio and television 
work, classical orchestra and Broadway musicals -- last year, he finished an 8 
1/2-year run with "42nd St." 
</P>
<P>
Royal and Wilder will be backed by Mike Wofford on piano, Bob Magnusson on bass 
and Roy McCurdy on drums. 
</P>
<P>
After this kickoff concert at 8 p.m. at the Lyceum Stage theater in Horton 
Plaza, the jazz society will present a tribute to Charlie Parker from 
saxophonist Nick Brignola on March 10 at the new downtown convention center and 
an April 1 tribute to Basie at the Don Powell Theatre on the San Diego State 
University campus. 
</P>
<P>
The shows are being funded with $12,800 in city arts money the society was 
awarded for 1990. This spring, the society plans to present a series of outdoor 
community concerts at various San Diego County locations. 
</P>

KIFM (98.1) is making changes that could perk up its Sunday night "Mainly 
Mainstream" program, which runs from 10 until midnight. It's been renamed 
"Straight Ahead." Starting this Sunday, host Paul Lavoie is out, replaced by 
local jazz expert Jim Merod and Steve Satkowski, who will also serve as 
executive producer. Satkowski books the talent for Elario's, which is 
underwriting the program. It's a great promotion for Elario's. Each show will 
spotlight the club's headliner through several short interview segments and 
digital audio tape of their performances at the club. The show will also 
include reviews of jazz CDs, 98-second jazz history capsules and a segment 
called "Straight From the Hip," featuring jazz news and trends.

Tobacco Road has a new self-produced album, available from the group at their 
various gigs, or at Uptown Records in Hillcrest. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cassette's 14 songs, the one getting airplay on KSDS-FM, B100's 
"Morning Zoo" and KFMB-Am's Hudson and Bauer show is "We Got Fish for Supper," 
sung by Preston Coleman, the band's 72-year-old bass player. Coleman has played 
with pianist Mary Lou Williams and drummer Art Blakey in a trio, and with 
singer Joe Williams and trumpeter Walter Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
During the coming weeks, you can hear Tobacco Road during Wednesday happy hours 
at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach and Thursday nights at the new Kansas 
City Steakhouse in the Gaslamp Quarter in downtown San Diego.

   Maurice White is thinking a lot about the past
these days. He has someone checking out his family tree _ he knows
his great-grandmother lived in New Orleans, and he wants to go back
further, much further.
   Musically, it's the same story. Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's new album,
``Heritage,'' is another kind of family tree, the tone set by
``Takin' Chances'' and its refrain of ``No risk, No gain.''
   Sly Stone is on it, so is M.C. Hammer, and tributes are paid to
Fats Waller and Charlie Parker. The music features jazz, funk,
rhythm and blues and rap, with time out for one of Philip Bailey's
sweet ballads.
   ``The album was a germ in my mind,'' White, the band's founder
and producer, said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles.
``It's very interesting watching it evolve and come to fruition. It
starts as an idea, and all of a sudden it's a giant thing.
   ``I was thinking, first of all musical heritage, the things we
had drawn from. And we wanted to bring to our fans' attention
things to appreciate, things to be proud of.''
   The LP has 17 songs and runs for an over an hour. The title
track features rappers The Boys. Hammer, whose album ``Please
Hammer Don't Hurt `Em'' has topped the charts, gives raps on two
songs, ``Wanna Be the Man'' and ``For the Love of You,''
   Stone contributes his best James Brown shout to ``Good Time,''
and the brief instrumental ``Interlude: Bird'' features a saxophone
solo influenced by Parker.
   ``The things that really thrill me about the record was having
the opportunity to work with other artists who I had admired from a
distance. Sly Stone I really had only met casually. He was one of
my early influences, he and Ray Charles,'' White said.
   ``My son, Kibran, listens to M.C. all the time _ besides being
hip to what's going on in the streets, M.C. has a positive message
for young people. So it was a way of bringing back two eras
together and getting back on the cutting edge.''
   This is actually the second edition of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire.
White, a former session musician at Chess Records, formed the first
one in the late 1960s; it soon broke up. So White gave it another
try: same name, new members.
   ``I made sure that they understood it was going to be a long,
rocky road,'' recalled White, who recruited Bailey, brother Verdine
White on bass and six others. ``I was looking for people who had
dedication and integrity to the music. Growth takes a long time. I
still have growing pains.''
   Originally a little known jazz group, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire didn't
click until 1975 and their sixth album, ``That's the Way of the
World.'' The fast-paced chant ``Shining Star'' was a No. 1 single,
its story of every man's uniqueness an update of Stone's
``Everybody Is a Star.'' It appealed to just about all audiences.
   Earth, Wind &amp; Fire has since had six double platinum albums and
won seven Grammys, but White isn't satisfied with the band's
reputation as a ``crossover'' act. Listen to him and you wonder
about the chorus of the new album's title song: ``Just be proud of
your land, where your blood comes from.''
   European audiences are more challenging than American ones, he
says. In the states, they just want to hear the hits _ including
``Boogie Wonderland,'' ``September'' and ``Let's Groove'' _ while
Europeans respond to White's more ambitious outlook.
   ``I think in a lot of cases we have been logged as being a black
group musically and that's it. They look at their faces, and say,
`They're black and therefore they do this kind of music.'
   ``In Europe, they're more open to the music and more open to the
culture. They're inquisitive. They don't understand anything about
the culture and so they try to investigate and have an open mind.''
   White and the band push on, surviving a temporary split in 1984,
and adjusting to a music scene that never stops changing. ``We'll
go on `till we drop,'' he says. A recent visit to the Berlin Wall
reminds him how much there is to write about, and thoughts of their
world tour make him anxious to get back on the front line.
   ``The tour will be about musical heritage, artistic heritage,
racial heritage. We have something now which I think the whole
globe is gravitating to, and that is the world beat,'' he said.
   ``With the opening up of all these different countries in
Eastern Europe, we have a lot more people to reach. What we're
gearing up towards is a great world community.''
