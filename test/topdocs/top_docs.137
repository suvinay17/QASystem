<TEXT>     All it tells you is that the company that manufactured the plant food knows
its marketing, because green -- as in environmentally conscious -- is the
color in garden products these days. In the fertilizer business, as with other
garden supplies, green is the color of money, too, and fertilizer is the
fastest-growing segment of the marketplace.;    Unfortunately for consumers,
discerning if there is anything truly "green" inside those fertilizer bags is
even harder than selecting the product with the right N-P-K ratio ever was.;
 In the N-P-K ratio, it's necessary to know that nitrogen (N) governs foliage
growth, phosphorus (P) helps the flowers bloom, and potassium (K) is
responsible for root development. But savvy shoppers also need to know
precisely what "natural," "organic" and other current fertilizer jargon means.
The words may sound familiar, but watch out.;    As in the early days of
"lite," "natural" and "organic" foods, a kind of free-for-all is taking place
in the garden marketplace.;    Not only are new fertilizer formulas being
introduced to meet the demand for "green" plant foods, but some companies are
simply relabeling their old products to imply an environmental sensitivity and
cash in on the enthusiasm.;    Because it can take several years or longer for
government labeling regulations to catch up with trends in new products,
claims stated on the bag may not be what they seem. A fertilizer labeled
"organic," for instance, is not necessarily non-chemical. It can -- and often
does -- contain synthetic ingredients under current state label laws, most
frequently in the form of urea. By law, a "natural" product cannot contain
chemicals, but it can contain both organic and inorganic materials.;    First,
consumers must decide which side of the chemical debate they are on.
Proponents of non-chemical fertilizers, for instance, say there are several
reasons to buy them, besides the current snob appeal of things green.;
Chemical fertilizers frequently are manufactured from precious reserves of
fossil fuels, antagonists say, and their manufacture also is fuel-intensive,
burning petrochemicals and producing pollution.;    "All-natural organic"
fertilizers -- those that contain only materials derived from plant or animal
products, which tend to be the most expensive, are the choice in strict
organic-gardening circles.;    They make use of renewable resources, waste
products or byproducts, such as manures, meals and composts from other
industries that might otherwise wind up in dumps.;    A caveat: While it is
essential environmentally that we learn to recycle all our waste products
efficiently, some of them may contain substances that could pose potential
threats, especially if used to fertilize the food garden:;    (check) Leather
meal often is high in chromium, an element used in the tanning process.;
(check) Cottonseed meal can be packed with pesticides, because cotton farming
is pesticide-intensive.;    (check) Mushroom compost (the medium mushrooms are
grown in commercially) is likewise exposed to lots of chemicals.;    (check)
Sewage sludge, or tankage, may be high in heavy metals. These need to be
cleaned and tested for safety first, but at present this is not always done,
or even required under current law.;    "If they're following the law, legally
we have to register the product," said Stephen Markarian, acting supervising
inspector with the New York State Division of Plant Industry, Department of
Agriculture and Markets, which registers companies to distribute fertilizers.
"But we're beginning to look at more of these questions. There's a lot of work
ahead to do.";    Slow action;    All-natural organic fertilizers generally
are slower-acting than chemical ones, requiring a couple of weeks or more to
produce results.;    Because they are taken up gradually, they will not burn
plants. Slow-release chemical fertilizers also are formulated to be less apt
to burn than quick-release chemical nitrogen sources.;    But perhaps the most
important distinction is that all-natural organic fertilizers put organic
matter into the soil, proponents stress, not just give a quick shot in the arm
to plants.;    "The plants may not know the difference, but the soil does,"
said Bill Wolf, vice president of the Organic Foods Production Association of
North America, a non-profit educational trade group, and founder of Necessary
Trading Co., a longtime leading supplier of products for organic gardening and
farming. "I just listen to the earthworms. Long term, a 100 percent natural
organic (fertilizer) builds healthy soil while producing healthy plants and
healthy people.";    Read the labels;    What's a consumer to do? Read, read,
read -- as in labels. Some tips on what to look for:;    (check) "Try not to
be led by the company name," said Paul McNelly, a fertilizer regulatory
adviser with the American Association of Plant Control Officials, a group of
individual state officials that publishes rules many states adopt or use as
guidelines in devising their own laws.;    "A brand name can twist the words
'natural' and 'organic' as much as they like. It's 'creative' marketing, so to
speak," he says. Likewise, friendly nature scenes on the package do not
necessarily a natural product make.;    (check) Select a product that promises
slow release. Those rich in organic materials will naturally be slow; when
buying chemical fertilizers, spend the extra amount for non-burning,
slow-release formulations.;    (check) If you want to go strictly organic,
look for the words "all-natural organic" or "100 percent natural organic."
Scan the ingredient list for familiar-sounding substances that come from plant
or animal sources (hoof meal, bone meal, feather meal, fish emulsion, manures,
seaweed and so forth).;    (check) Check the N-P-K ratio numbers for another
clue to whether a product is truly all-natural and organic. It is unlikely
that anything with numbers adding up to more than 15 is 100 percent organic,
unless significant amounts of blood meal (an organic substance very high in
nitrogen) were added. Otherwise, suspect that the product has been "boosted"
with some amount of chemicals.;    (check) Do not waste organic resources.
Compost kitchen and yard wastes, then add to soil. Leave clippings on the
lawn, where they can return nitrogen to the soil naturally. Don't rely solely
on bagged fertilizers -- chemical or non-chemical.  </TEXT>

  [Text] Nagoya, March 15 KYODO -- Nitrogen oxides and ozone
from the Asian Continent are contributing to air pollution over
the western Pacific, researchers at Nagoya University said
Tuesday [15 March].
  The researchers, led by Yutaka Kondo, professor at the
university's solar-terrestrial environmental laboratory, used
data from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration
(NASA) survey of chemical substances in the atmosphere.
  The pollutants are carried from the Asian mainland to the
Pacific by prevailing westerly winds, the researchers said.
  Low-altitude ozone results from a chemical change in
atmospheric oxygen, with nitrogen oxides from automobile
exhausts and coal-fired power stations serving as catalysts.
  Unlike stratospheric ozone, such low-altitude ozone can
damage the respiratory system when in high densities.
  The density of ozone in clean air is normally about 20 parts
per billion (PPB) and that of nitrogen oxide is around 0.1 PPB.
  But at altitudes of 2,000 to 3000 meters off the coasts near
Taiwan and Hong Kong, ozone densities were more than 100 PPB,
and off Japan, nitrogen oxide densities were 1 PPB.
  A member of the research team, Hideaki Nakajima, said the
pollutants detected are responsible for acid rain and could
eventually cause forests near the Pacific to die off unless
countries in the region quickly produce a preventive strategy.
  China and Russia, with their relatively low environmental
standards, have previously been identified as responsible for
much of the pollution in the region, but this is the first
empirical evidence to back up the claims.

  [Abstract] Catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides to
elemental nitrogen by various gases used as reducing agents is a
much more promising way of recovering nitrogen oxides than
conventional absorption and adsorption methods. Noble metals
(i.e., platinum, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, etc.) may serve
as catalysts in selective reduction processes; however, their
high cost and scarcity have spawned the search for cheaper
alternatives. Noble metal oxides on different carriers and
variable-valence metal oxides may be used as catalysts in
nonselective reduction processes. In view of these facts, a
study was undertaken to find effective non-noble
metal-containing catalysts that could be used to reduce nitrogen
oxides with natural gas. The experiments were performed in a
continuous reactor unit with a stationary catalyst layer at
temperatures of 250-590�C with a space velocity of 3,000/h
and CH[.sup]4[/]:NO[.sub]x[/] ratio of 10:1. The content
of nitrogen oxides in the gas mixture at the reactor entrance
and exit was determined by the calorimetric method and by
gas-liquid chromatography. Eight catalysts were tested: STK,
GIAP-8, NTK-10-1, NTK-10, nickel-chromium, palladized carbon,
GIAP-16, and carbon-modified STK. With the exception of GIAP-8,
all of the catalysts tested manifested a high catalytic activity
during the nitrogen oxide recovery process. The main products of
the reduction reaction were nitrogen, water, and carbon dioxide.
A side reaction of methane and oxygen also occurred. The study
established that most metal oxide-based commercial catalysts
(i.e., with the exception of GIAP-8) may be used to virtually
totally remove nitrogen oxides from gas mixtures at
290-590�C provided that the said gas mixture does not
contain more than 3 weight percent oxygen. When greater amounts
of oxygen are present, it is necessary to first remove the
oxygen from the gas mixture by, for example, using a two-stage
reactor. Tables 3; references 4 (Russian).

   Scientists at a Sandia National Laboratories facility said they have developed a promising new process for eliminating a major pollutant from the exhaust of combustion systems.

   The process, which is still in the early development stage, has the potential to almost eliminate nitrogen oxides -- a major part of smog -- from sources such as diesel vehicles and coal-burning generating plants, the researchers said.

   If the process should become commercially applicable, it could greatly benefit the fight against acid rain and air pollution.
Sandia stressed that the concept has been investigated only in the laboratory, and requires a great deal of additional research, which it expects will be carried out by the private sector.

   Sandia scientists Robert A. Perry and Dennis L. Siebers disclosed their findings in an article in the British journal Nature.
Sandia, a research contractor, operates the Livermore Combustion Research Facility for the Department of Energy.
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s AT&amp;T Technologies Inc. unit manages Sandia for the department on a not-for-profit basis.

   The new process uses an inexpensive, nontoxic chemical to convert the nitrogen oxides into water, nitrogen, and other gases.
The chemical, cyanuric acid, is commonly used currently as a stabilizer for chlorine in swimming pools.

   In experiments conducted on a small diesel engine, Messrs.
Perry and Siebers found that by passing the engine's exhaust over the solid cyanuric acid, they could reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by more than 99%.

   The Energy Department automatically owns the patent to any technology developed at laboratories funded by the department.

      New Process May Boost
   Biodegradable Plastics
   ANTI-PLASTIC sentiments stirred by a mounting national garbage-disposal crisis have companies scrambling to rush biodegradable plastics to the market.
But these materials all have one problem: starch.

   Biodegradable products deteriorate as their molecules are eaten by microorganisms.
Plastic molecules, however, are too big for microorganisms to consume.
So, the molecules are mixed with starch, which the bacteria or fungi can eat, breaking the plastic molecules down into smaller, bite-sized pieces.
But starch also weakens plastic's structure and can introduce microorganisms into food packaging.

   Ramini Narayan, the head of organic and polymer research at Purdue University, has overcome these difficulties with a process that has attracted the interest of such big plastics makers as Dow Chemical Co. and Mobil Corp.

   To prevent microorganisms from devouring the plastic as it sits on a grocery shelf, Mr. Narayan uses cellulose acetate, a natural plastic derived from wood pulp, instead of starch.
Cellulose acetate is prone to attack by microorganisms only after a reaction with soil changes its chemical structure to cellulose.

   Mr. Narayan has developed a "copolymer" that grafts the molecules of cellulose acetate and synthetic plastics, which have different chemical structures, together in a "tight fit."
The result, he says, is a plastic that retains its properties and yet is biodegradable in a landfill.

   Wineries Profit Using
   Home-Made Nitrogen
   TO PREVENT wine from turning into vinegar, wineries use nitrogen to shield the alcoholic beverage from oxygen when it is being put into a barrel or bottle.
Most wineries use highly pressured cylinders of liquid nitrogen.
But the supercooled gas is expensive.
So, some wineries have discovered a cheaper source of nitrogen.

   Fetzer Vineyards of Redwood Valley, Calif., now uses a plastic membrane made by Monsanto Co. to extract nitrogen from air.
"It is the first time that we're aware of any winery using this technology," says Alexander Snage, market manager for Monsanto's Permea division, which makes the Prism Alpha membrane.

   Air separation membranes are a relatively young invention.
The St. Louis chemical maker developed a first-generation membrane 10 years ago to separate hydrogen from nitrogen in ammonia, and carbon dioxide from methane.
It developed the Prism Alpha two years ago and sold the technology to apple growers, who use it to blanket their plucked apples from oxygen, which extends the fruit's life up to nine months.

   Air consists of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and other gases.
To separate the elements, compressed air is forced through the Prism Alpha membrane, which allows only nitrogen to pass through.
"You can buy our system and produce nitrogen at the site at a fraction of the cost of having nitrogen shipped to your plant," says Mr. Snage of Monsanto.

   'Super Oxygen' Eases
   Environmental Problem
   SAFE DISPOSAL of polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs, once widely used as insulation in electronics and transformers, has been a nagging problem ever since they were found in the 1960s to be deadly.

   PCBs' virtues -- chemical stability and high heat resistance -- have made them difficult to burn.
The Environmental Protection Agency approves incineration, but the process gives off dioxin, which is substantially more toxic than PCBs themselves.
So the safest method of disposal has been storage in sealed containers.

   Chemists have tried unsuccessfully to render PCBs chemically harmless, which would allow them to be disposed safely.
In fact, Donald Sawyer at Texas A&amp;M University, who discovered a way to break down such chlorinated pesticides as DDT, and other chemists believed that PCBs couldn't be broken down.

   Now Mr. Sawyer and his researchers at the university have discovered that PCBs can be made to react with an oxygen atom that has "a lot of energy," says Hiroshi Sugimoto, one of the researchers.
They combined two oxygen atoms and added an electron to form a highly charged "superoxide ion," and found that it broke down highly chlorinated PCBs into harmless bicarbonate of soda and table salt.

   A Process to Produce
   Wrinkle-Free Cottons
   TEXTILE MAKERS blend cotton with polyester or other synthetic materials to produce wrinkle-resistant fabrics.
But polyester doesn't absorb moisture, so permanent-press clothes aren't as cool as those made from all-cotton fibers.

   Now, U.S. Department of Agriculture chemists say they have developed a way to make all-cotton, permanent-press apparel.
The process also uses non-toxic polycarboxylic acids, while the method for making most current permanent-press fabrics involves formaldehyde, which has caused cancer in laboratory animals.

   Clark M. Welch and Bethlehem K. Andrews of the USDA's research facilities in New Orleans use four groups of chemicals, or "catalysts," to bind polycarboxylic acids to fibers, making them wrinkle-resistant.
Fabrics are soaked in the acids and the catalysts, and then quickly heated for no more than 90 seconds at temperatures as high as 410 degrees Fahrenheit, which bonds the acids with the cellulose molecules of the cotton fibers.

   The ability of these acids to make fabrics wrinkle-resistant has been known for nearly two decades, but chemists had found them impractical to use.
Without the catalysts, the process would take hours.
And at such high temperatures, "the fabric would burn up," Mr. Welch says.
"The catalysts are the key."

<HEAD>Solar Activity Said to Contribute to Ozone Damage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The barrage of charged particles from the sun
may be contributing to the damage to the Earth's protective ozone
layer, a pair of government scientists reported Wednesday.
   ``Very dramatic changes have occurred' in the number of
electrons raining down on the Earth between 1979 and 1984, Linwood
Callis of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said at
a meeting of the American Geophysical Union.
   This flow of electrons, enhanced by the solar wind _ an energy
flow from the sun _ leads to the formation of oxides of nitrogen in
the upper parts of the stratosphere.
   In turn, those nitrogen compounds can settle into the
stratosphere where ``if you have any kind of significant build-up,
then what you have is the possibility of catalytic destruction of
ozone,'' said Callis.
   Ozone helps protect the Earth from potentially damaging
ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
   ``What the model calculations show and that the data confirm is
that from 1979 to 1985 the (nitrogen oxide) levels in the polar
lower stratosphere probably increased betweeen 30 and 80 or 90
percent. In the equatorial region there have been increases, much
smaller, on the order of 10 or 15 percent,'' Callis said.
   Damage to the ozone over the South Pole has been widely
discussed in recent years. Callis said that so-called Antarctic
``ozone hole'' appears to be largely a result of chlorine compounds
trapped over the polar areas, since ice particles in this region
tend to remove many nitrogen compounds from the air.
   ``The interest that we have in this is primarily related to
global ozone ... there are larger than expected ozone changes,''
said Callis.
   Scientists have warned that if that ozone damage were to spread
to other parts of the Earth, the increased radiation could cause an
increase in skin cancer. International efforts are being made to
reduce or ban the use of ozone-damaging chemicals.
   Callis and Dan Baker, also of NASA, reported that they have used
satellite data to study levels of ozone, nitrogen oxides and other
chemicals around the world.
   In the air about 16 miles above the surface, the area where
ozone is most concentrated, they found the gas depleted by as much
as 14 percent between 1979 and 1985, Callis said.
   This could be occurring because of some natural changes in
atmospheric chemistry, he said. But having it occur at the same
time the flood of charged particles from the sun is increasing
makes them consider the possibility of cause and effect.
   Natural changes in the solar cycle should reduce the amount of
incoming charged particles between now and the mid-1990s, said
Callis, and he and Baker are interested in seeing if ozone levels
will recover during that period.
   The flow of particles is lowest during periods of sunspot
maximums and increased when there were fewer sunspots.
   ``There are ... clear links between the state of the
magnetosphere and the state of the middle atmosphere,'' Callis said.

   Congress should require 90 percent reductions
in air pollution by nitrogen compounds, given off in power plant
emissions and motor vehicle exhausts, the American Lung Association
said Tuesday.
   Nitrogen oxides help form ozone, acid rain and the formation of
airborne particles that hamper visibility.
   Some of nitrogen oxide compounds also contribute to the global
warming embodied in the ``greenhouse effect'' theory while others
may be more damaging to health than previously believed, the
association said.
   ``Aggressive control of (nitrogen oxides) is necessary, feasible
and long overdue,'' said Peg Garland of the association, which
recommended reducing nitrogen oxide emissions by about 4 million
metric tons a year, from about 20 million metric tons now. To do
that would cost the economy about $3 per person per year, she said.
   Several technologies can reduce emissions; catalytic devices
used in West Germany and Japan are achieving 90 percent reductions.
   Nitrogen oxides, which result from any combustion, have long
been recognized as important pollutants. In recent years, however,
congressional attention has been largely focused on sulfur
compounds, which also form acid rain; on EPA policies for dealing
with the failure of many cities to meet ozone standards, and on
emissions of industrial chemicals.
   About half of all nitrogen oxides come from industrial fuel
combustion, mostly in power plants, while 40 percent come from
motor vehicle exhausts, according to estimates by the Environmental
Protection Agency.
   If nothing is done, power plant emissions are expected to double
in 30 years and total emissions to increase by 50 percent, the
association said.
   New power plants must meet strict emissions limits, with coal
plants achieving a 65 percent reduction from what their emissions
would otherwise be. There are no standards for plants built before
1971, however.
   The association said that new plants should be forced to reduce
emissions by 90 percent and old plants should be required to
install control equipment achieving 80 percent to 90 percent
reductions over the next decade.
   Current federal standards for auto exhausts in all states but
California result in about a 75 percent reduction in emissions from
an uncontrolled car. California, which has tougher standards of its
own, is tightening its standards to achieve a 90 percent reduction
by the 1991 model year.
   The association said that Congress, in its debates this year on
revising the Clean Air Act, should extend the new California auto
standard to the rest of the country.
   Almost 100 cities fail to meet federal ozone standards, and John
Holmes, chief researcher for the California Air Resources Board,
said the EPA's strategies for fighting ozone have lost
effectiveness by neglecting nitrogen oxides.
   For sustained ozone formation, both nitrogen oxides and
hydrocarbon vapors like unburned gasoline are necessary. In some
areas, reductions in nitrogen oxides can increase ozone, so the EPA
has stressed to states and cities that they should reduce
hydrocarbon emissions.
   John Bachmann, an EPA environmental engineer, said he believed
the agency's concerns were converging with Holmes'.
   ``If the numbers are high enough, there's no question he's
right,'' Bachmann said.
   Bruce Jordan of the office said the agency was requiring states
to consider nitrogen oxide reductions in revising their air
pollution control plans.
   Speaking for himself and not the agency, Bachman said a
requirement for a 90 percent emissions reduction in all cases would
be ``technically premature.''
   The agency's spokesman on air issues did not immediately return
a phone call.

  [Abstract] In all industrially developed nations the
nitrogen industry is related to ammonia and methanol production.
Ammonia and other nitrogen compounds are used for the production
of fertilizers which have an annual estimated production growth
rate of 5 percent. About 70 percent of the world's ammonia
production is derived from natural gas; the most
energy-efficient method of producing technological feed gas for
ammonia is catalytic conversion of natural gas with steam in two
stages. In the first stage pre-treated natural gas is passed
over a nickel catalyst in a tubular reactor heated with natural
gas under conditions selected so that the residual methane
content in the dry converted gas is 9-11 percent by volume. In
the second stage the methane is converted with steam and air
oxygen in a columnar reactor where the entire oxygen content
reacts with hydrogen, methane, and oxides of carbon. Heating the
mix to 1250-1280� C shifts the equilibrium to catalytic
reaction of methane with the steam. The quantity of air supplied
to the reactor is controlled so that the CO and H[.sub]2[/]
to nitrogen ratio is 3.05-3.10 and residual methane is 0.3-0.5
percent by volume. The next step in the production of
technological feed gas is catalytic conversion of carbon
monoxide to increase the hydrogen content, remove carbon
dioxide, and methanize any residual oxides of carbon to give a
nitrogen-hydrogen mixture for the ammonia synthesis stage. Owing
to the sharp rise in energy costs, the problem of energy savings
became acute for multi-ton ammonia production, especially in
production of the technological feed gas. In the present work
some results are presented on a theoretical analysis of various
variants in organizing a technological scheme and simulating
processes in basic reactors making it possible to uncover
tendencies in the modernization of multi-ton aggregates for the
purpose of lowering energy costs. One such variant could be
lowering the temperature in the secondary reforming stage under
conditions of selective methane combustion to 1200� C.

<HEAD>U.S. Signs Accord On Nitrogen Oxide Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States signed a supplemental treaty
Tuesday aimed at limiting emissions of nitrogen oxides, air
pollutants that help cause acid rain and smog, the Environmental
Protection Agency said.
   Administrator Lee M. Thomas signed the protocol to the existing
treaty on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution in Sofia, Bulgaria,
according to an agency announcement.
   The United States earlier declined to sign a similar protocol
dealing with sulfur dioxide, requiring a 30 percent reduction in
emissions, on the ground that U.S. sulfur dioxide emissions had been
reduced substantially under the 1970 Clean Air Act.
   Such a requirement would have been unfair, when similar
percentage reductions by European countries would be made from
almost uncontrolled sources, the United States argued.
   During negotiations on the nitrogen oxides agreement, the United
States sought a 20 percent credit for reductions already made that
other countries had not yet undertaken.
   As a compromise, the agreement requires participating nations to
limit emissions in the 1990s, but permits each to choose as its
ceiling the emission level of any year through 1987.
   In addition, the annual average from 1987 through 1996 may not
exceed the average for 1987.
   EPA's latest estimate is that U.S. motor vehicles, power plants
and industrial boilers produced 21.3 million tons of nitrogen oxides
in 1986. The peak year, which presumably the United States could use
as its base year when the freeze takes effect, was 1978, when EPA
estimates emissions at 22.4 million tons.
   Forty-four percent comes from motor vehicles and other
transportation sources, and just under half from industrial and
power-plant boilers.
   Nitrogen oxides are produced by all combustion, particularly at
high temperatures. Though new cars today emit only a quarter of what
cars without pollution controls emitted in the 1960s, travel has
increased so much that emissions have declined only slightly from
the peak and EPA expects the total to turn up again about 1995,
reaching 22 million tons in the year 2000.
   Participating nations are obliged to ``apply best available
technologies that are economically feasible'' and to control
existing sources ``taking into account such factors as plant age and
rate of utilization and the need to avoid undue operational
disruption.''
   The United States already has done that and thus ``no additional
regulatory actions are required,'' EPA said.
   Major U.S. industries did not oppose U.S. adherence to the
agreement after EPA pointed out its judgment that no new regulations
would be needed.
   Nitrogen oxides in high concentrations can damage the lungs. One
of these compounds provides the visible brown component of urban
smog.
   Transported long distances when emitted high in the air, as from
a tall smokestack, nitrogen oxides become nitric acid and falls in
acid rain.
   Nitrogen oxides are essential in producing the chemical reactions
that make ozone, the major component of smog, and recent research
has shown that even tiny amounts in forests may prompt the formation
of ozone from hydrocarbons emitted by the trees themselves.
   In fighting urban smog, EPA has chosen to stress reductions in
hydrocarbons from fuels and solvents rather than nitrogen oxide
reductions. In certain circumstances, reductions in nitrogen oxides
can increase ozone in the city before ozone concentrations start
going down.

Canada</HEAD>

   The United States has told Canada it won't
agree to bar increases in northbound flow of nitrogen oxides, an
important cause of acid rain, an Environmental Protection Agency
official said Wednesday.
   In United Nations-sponsored negotiations in Geneva, the United
States is seeking the right to emit about 20 percent more nitrogen
oxides than it now does, said Sheldon Meyers, EPA's acting
associate administrator for international programs.
   Meyers said the United States wants credit for earlier
unilateral efforts to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. A 1979
treaty calls for reductions in cross-border flows of air pollution
``taking into account the efforts already made.''
   The United States refused to seek such a credit in another treat
last fall aimed at safeguarding the earth's protective ozone layer.
   The 20 percent increase in nitrogen oxide emissions would be
compensation for the efforts and achievements of the existing U.S.
control program, which has reduced ground-level concentrations of
nitrogen oxides by 14 percent since 1975 and emissions by 8.5
percent since 1978, Meyers said.
   Nitrogen oxide, an important component of auto emissions, later
turns into nitric acid in the atmosphere, and along with sulfuric
acid from sulfur dioxide emissions creates the acid rain which
environmentalists blame for the death of aquatic life in sensitive
lakes and streams.
   ``There's no question that absent our control program, we would
have much higher nitrogen oxide emissions,'' and the United States
believes other countries should catch up before it undertakes new
commitments, Meyers said.
   Earlier negotiations resulted in international agreement in 1985
to cut sulfur dioxide emissions by 30 percent, an agreement the
United States has declined to join.
   Both sulfur and nitrogen oxides are emitted by coal-burning
power plants and factory boilers. In the eastern United States and
Canada, sulfur accounts for two-thirds of the excess acidity in
rainfall and has been believed more damaging to lakes and streams.
   Half of Canada's acid rain originates in the United States, and
Canada for years has pressed for additional U.S. action against the
precursors of acid rain.
   Due to auto emission standards imposed in the United States in
1975, a new car today emits only one-fourth the nitrogen oxides of
cars made before that. Canada adopted U.S. auto emission standards
in 1985, and most European countries are only beginning to
contemplate such controls.
   But U.S. emissions are expected to increase again around 1995
because of more travel by more cars. Thus, Meyers said, ``There's
no way we can agree'' to a Canadian proposal to accept the U.S.
position permitting higher emissions in exchange for a commitment
not to increase cross-border flow of nitrogen oxides.
   In fact, said Meyers, the United States does not believe such
flows can be measured. Canada, he said, ``uses a (computer) model
we say is not accurate. It's very simplistic.''
   During talks leading up to the September international treaty
calling for a 50 percent reduction in emissions of
chlorofluorocarbon compounds that attack the ozone layer, U.S.
negotiators declined to seek credit for emissions reductions
resulting from the 1978 U.S. ban on use of these chemicals as
aerosol propellants.
   The CFC negotiations were not comparable, Meyers said: The 1978
aerosol reductions ``were minor. These (nitrogen oxide reductions)
are not minor.''
   Canada also has sought a treaty with the United States limiting
U.S. sulfur dioxide ``exports'' to 2.2 million tons, compared with
about 4 million tons today. The United States has not agreed.
   According to EPA estimates, the United States emitted 21.3
million tons of nitrogen oxides in 1986 and 23.3 million tons in
1978, the peak year. Canadian emissions were 9 percent of the U.S.
total in 1980. EPA expects U.S. emissions in the year 2000 to be
above 22 million tons.
   Meyers' revelation drew this criticism from Rep. James Florio,
D-N.J., a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee
considering, for the fifth straight year, various measures against
acid rain:
   ``For too long the administration has talked about research when
it was clear that what was needed was action. Now they are talking
about increasing by 4 million tons a year the amount of nitrogen
oxide that is released into the air. It simply does not make
sense.''

<F P=106> [Article by Gerard van Nifterik: "Catalyst With UV Light Let </F>
Loose On Nitrogen Oxides"]
  [Text] Hannover -- A German photo catalytic process using
ultraviolet light is being utilized to remove nitrogen oxides
from exhaust fumes. Researchers at the University of Hannover
developed a process which eliminates nitrogen oxides
(NO[.sub]x[/]) in exhaust fumes.
  Nitrogen oxides are released during the burning process.
Combustion engines are therefore major contributors to the
emissions of NO[.sub]x[/]. In this country, road traffic is
by far the largest source of NO[.sub]x[/].
  Although it is not yet fully clear how efficient the German
process is, the researchers are forecasting that it will be able
to compete with existing methods such as selective catalysis and
non-catalytic reduction.
  The technique which has been developed in Hanover sends
exhaust gases through a titanium dioxide catalyst bed. A 150
Watt UV lamp has been placed in the same bed. The combination
of ultraviolet light and the catalyst ensure that the
NO[.sub]x[/] is then broken down into harmless nitrogen and
oxygen. Hanover uses grains of TiO[.sub]2[/] with an average
size of around 200 microns. Experiments have shown that a 20
centimeter TiO2 column already does a very good job.
Concentrations of NOx of approximately 1,400 ppm [parts per
million] can reportedly be reduced by 50 to 70 percent. The
addition of ammonia could even lead to a reduction of 100
percent. No similar research into the use of UV light in
catalysts is taking place in the Netherlands. Instead, IMET-TNO
(the Institute for Environmental and Energy Technology in the
Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research) in
Apeldoorn is involved in the purification of industrial flue
gases using UV light. The accent here lies primarily on low
concentrations of hydrocarbons (up to 0.5 grams per cubic
meter). An employee at the TNO institute reports that in the
near future it will also be used for degrading nitrogen oxides.

   Engineers from nearly a dozen companies have recently paraded through the doors of Southern Co., showing off technologies that they claim will reduce harmful emissions from the utility's coal-burning power plants.
Only a few will be called back for a full-scale trial.

   "I hope we're on the list," says an anxious Peter Boer, head of research at W.R. Grace &amp; Co. Otherwise, he says, the company is going to "lose position to the competition."

   Pending clean-air legislation has sparked both a heated contest to develop technologies for curbing acid rain and intense investor interest in the contenders.
But a sound technology alone may not guarantee a piece of the estimated $3.5 billion-a-year market for controlling acid rain.
Engineering companies need to find utilities willing to test their science, or be left at a disadvantage.
"It's impractical to set up a pilot plant from scratch, so you have to work with someone's site," says Mr. Boer.

   A technology is "in the club" only after a utility tests it, says Paul Knight, an analyst at Washington Analysis Corp., a research concern.
"There are at least a hundred technologies out there, and more will emerge, but only a few will get the stamp of legitimacy."

   Since the 1977 Clean Air Act, only a handful of engineering companies have entered the club with their "scrubber" technologies, which chemically extract pollutants from flue gases.
The newer technologies include improved versions of some old approaches, such as "coal washing," and installation of huge towers and chambers packed with sophisticated catalysts to catch the byproducts of coal burning -- sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides -- which fall to earth as acid rain.

   Coal-producing communities, especially in the Appalachian region, have a large stake in these technologies, too.
Coal-burning utilities generate 60% of the nation's sulfur dioxide emissions.
Without new solutions to the problem, power plants will likely be forced to seek more expensive, low-sulfur coal, which is usually found in the East.

   The impetus for these new technologies is coming from clean-air bills pending in Congress and the high priority the Bush administration has given in its own proposed amendments to the current Clean Air Act.

   How extensively the utilities will have to retrofit their plants will depend upon the final legislation expected by next year.
Even the least stringent administration bill would require a company like Southern Co. to retrofit at least half its plants with one or the other new technologies and switch to low-sulfur coals in the others.
"That will mean at least a billion dollars increase in annual costs, or an 8% rate increase for customers," says Charles Goodman, vice president of research at Atlanta-based Southern Co.

   One of the reasons the utilities must find alternatives to the relatively new scrubber technology, even though it's quite effective, is that the byproducts of scrubber methods will be suspect under the new pollution regulations.
The scrubbers, which account for a quarter of the size of a power plant, use a fine spray of lime or limestone to extract sulfur dioxide from the flue emissions, and produce huge amounts of sludge.
A storage problem also arises with the tons of limestone that the process requires.

   One old technology that has been refined into a leading contender for commercial application is coal washing.
An advanced process, developed by a McDermott International unit and Asea Brown Boveri of Sweden, involves crushing coal into fine powder and then "washing" it during combustion with calcium-based absorbents to soak up sulfur dioxide.

   American Electric Power Service Corp. is building a small plant in Brilliant, Ohio, to test the process.
In this technology, coal is kept churning under high pressure during combustion.
Michael J. Mudd, principal engineer at the utility, says that in such a condition coal requires only half as much heat to burn as in conventional boilers, and so produces only half as much nitrogen oxide.

   A major drawback of these methods is that additional technologies are required to completely remove nitrogen oxides.
Some technologies attempt to simultaneously remove both gases with catalysts, the same way catalytic converters render automobile emissions harmless.
Noxso Corp., a new company founded to develop one such technology, is designing a pilot plant at a site of an Ohio utility.

   The Noxso process involves passing flue gases through a bed of alumina beads coated with sodium.
The beads, stored in tanks 40 feet high and 40 feet in diameter, absorb both gases.
The beads are then drained from the tanks in a continuous process, heated with natural gas and treated with steam.
As the final product, the process yields elemental sulfur, a basic chemical commodity widely used to make sulfuric acid.

   The nitrogen oxides released by the beads are recycled back into the coal boilers, triggering a "reversible" chemical reaction in which nitrogen oxides are produced and reduced in the same amounts, at the same time.
"The net is zero emission," says L.G. Neal, president of Noxso.

   W.R. Grace, which has agreed with Noxso to jointly develop the process, also has a technology of its own -- the one it's trying to market to Southern and other utilities.
It involves first mixing flue gases with ammonia and sending the mixture through a large catalytic converter, a honeycomb ceramic made of metal oxides.
The catalyst helps the ammonia react with nitrogen oxides to form harmless nitrogen and water.

   But cost is a big problem with these catalysts.
"They have to be replaced every year," says Southern's Mr. Goodman.

   On the fringes of these developments is RCM Technologies Inc., a Los Angeles engineering concern.
In a rundown industrial section of Camden, N.J., it has rigged up a demonstration plant.
The pilot plant appears to burn high-sulfur coal in a boiler and to send the dark fumes through looping pipes and chambers to a chimney that, according to RCM's chairman, Robert Sackett, doesn't emit any noxious gases.

   RCM assiduously courts the media but declines to give details of its process.
Mr. Sackett claims that some utilities have looked at the demonstration plant, but he declines to disclose the names.
Mr. Knight, the analyst, has looked at the RCM demonstration and says the technology "looks and sounds good."
But, he adds, unless a utility checks it out at a power plant "you don't know."

   The Electric Power Research Institute, a utilities trade group, is itself evaluating technologies, singling out ones that should get its stamp of approval.
Edward Cichanowicz, manager for air-quality control, says the group has identified 65 potential processes, using 40 different criteria.
He says eight of the technologies will be targeted for further development in co-operation with utilities.

   "Environmental controls cannot be evaluated solely according to reduction in airborne emissions," says Mr. Cichanowicz.
"They must also produce byproduct liquids and solids that can be safely managed, or preferably sold as a resource."

* Ozone: This colorless, irritant form of oxygen is the most pervasive air
pollutant. At high altitudes, it protects the earth from harmful ultraviolet
radiation, but it can be formed in excess when sunlight interacts with
hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides emitted by cars and industry. Short-term
effects of exposures include headaches, eye irritation, sore throat, coughing,
wheezing, and chest discomfort. Chronic exposures to high levels of ozone
appear to accelerate the aging process of the lung and people who live in
highly polluted areas are likely to have a greater risk of developing chronic
lung diseases. The effect is independent of the effects of tobacco smoking.
Scientists have not been able to prove that chronic ozone exposure increases
the risk of developing lung and other cancers.
</P>
<P>
* Nitrogen oxides: Like ozone, nitrogen oxides are harmful lung irritants. They
are produced when fossil fuels such as gasoline and oil are burned. The brown
gas may increase susceptibility to bronchitis and other respiratory infections.
</P>
<P>
* Particulates: These are microscopic liquid droplets or solids less than the
width of a human hair that are suspended in the atmosphere. They include soil,
metals, sulfates, nitrates and organic chemicals. The smallest particles, those
less than 10 microns in diameter, or PM-10, are the greatest health hazard
because they can be breathed deeply into the lungs. They may increase
susceptibility to respiratory infections. The average Los Angeles Basin
resident has a risk of death in any year of 1 in 10,000 greater than would be
the case if federal PM-10 standards were met, according to a study prepared for
the South Coast Air Quality Management District. Riverside and San Bernardino
County residents have risks that are about twice the basin average; Orange
County residents are below the average. By contrast, the yearly risk of dying
in a motor vehicle accident in California is two in 10,000.
</P>
<P>
* Carbon monoxide: This colorless, odorless gas is produced by incomplete
combustion of gasoline and other carbon-containing fuels. More than 90% of the
carbon monoxide in the basin is emitted directly from motor vehicles. Carbon
monoxide interferes with the oxygen-carrying capability of the blood. Symptoms
include headaches and breathing difficulties. Individuals with heart disease
may have increased vulnerability to angina, a chest pain caused by oxygen
deprivation of the heart, or irregular heart beats during exercise.
</P>
<P>
* Sulfur compounds: Sulfur dioxide is a colorless gas with a sharp odor that is
emitted by power plants, petroleum refineries and chemical plants. It can be
converted to the more irritant sulfuric acid, which contributes to acid rain,
and a variety of sulfur-containing particles. Exposures can cause asthmatic
reactions as well as nose, throat and eye irritation. Sulfur compounds are one
of the few significant pollutants that are not abundant in Southern California
air.
</P>
<P>
* Toxic chemicals. There are hundreds of cancer-causing chemicals in Southern
California air, but only about 10, including benzene, chromium, and ethylene
dibromide, are specifically regulated, according to Dr. John Froines, director
of the UCLA Occupational Health Center. These compounds may be emitted through
industrial combustion or when fuels, solvents and paints evaporate. Researchers
lack good estimates of the number of cancers or birth defects that may be
caused by air-borne toxics.
</P>
<P>
DRINKING WATER
</P>
<P>
Federal law requires that all water be disinfected to prevent the transmission
of infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
In general, when a drinking water source, such as a well, is found to contain
excess pollutants, health guidelines are met by either closing the well or
blending the well water with water from other cleaner supplies. But there may
be health risks from the low concentrations of regulated chemicals that are
permitted in drinking water, high concentrations of regulated chemicals that
escape detection, and unregulated contaminants.
</P>
<P>
* Nitrates: Nitrates are California's major ground water pollutant. They enter
through nitrogen-based fertilizers, animal wastes, sewage spills and septic
tanks. The maximum contaminant level is 45 parts per million. Nitrates are
primarily a hazard to infants. Nitrite, a nitrate conversion product, can cause
methemoglobinemia, or "blue baby syndrome," a potentially fatal interference
with the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood.
</P>
<P>
* Organic chemicals: Surface water and ground water may be contaminated by
hundreds of chemicals, including pesticides, such as dibromochloropropane
(DBCP), and industrial solvents, such as trichloroethane, trichloroethylene
(TCE) and perchloroethylene. While the health effects of specific organic
chemicals vary, the general concerns relate to cancer, birth defects, and, in
the case of DBCP, sterility in highly exposed men.
</P>
<P>
* Disinfection byproducts: These are formed when chemicals added to water to
prevent infectious diseases react with organic materials that are present in
the water. One example is trihalomethanes (THMs), which are produced when
chlorine reacts with organic materials. "Trihalomethanes in treated water
represent a higher cancer risk than most toxic pollutants at the levels that
the latter have been measured in drinking water," according to an article by
California Department of Health Services officials. The maximum contaminant
level of 100 parts per billion would be expected to cause 200 additional cancer
cases in 1 million people over a 70-year lifetime. Public health officials
justify this risk by pointing to the even greater benefits of preventing
water-borne infectious diseases, caused by bacteria and other germs.
</P>
<P>
OCEAN WATER
</P>
<P>
The Southern California ocean has been contaminated by millions of gallons of
pesticides, gasoline industrial wastes, storm drain runoff and untreated and
partly treated sewage. These contaminants may pose health risks to swimmers,
boaters and individuals who eat contaminated seafood. In general, many of these
health risks can be minimized by following the recommendations of health
officials. Do not, for example, swim near storm drain outfalls or at beaches
that are closed because of sewage contamination or fish or collect mussels and
other shellfish in known hazardous areas.
</P>
<P>
* Swimming: When unapproved areas are avoided, state health officials say it is
unlikely that ocean swimmers will contract bacterial diarrhea and other
water-borne ailments.
</P>
<P>
* Seafood consumption: The safety of seafood from Southern California coastal
waters is variable, according to state health officials. Specific warnings have
been issued for certain fish from certain areas. For example, white croaker
from much of Santa Monica Bay may be contaminated by DDT and polychlorinated
biphenyls, or PCBs. Health officials are only now in the process of analyzing
recently collected fish samples from up and down the coast that may help to
pinpoint the potential risk from other areas and for other fish. Until more
data is available, a general guideline is to not eat the same fish caught in
the same spot all the time. It is also prudent to cook mussels, oysters and
other shellfish.
</P>
<P>
SOIL POLLUTANTS
</P>
<P>
Soil pollutants include pesticides, solvents, metals, acids, and petroleum
wastes. These pollutants are most likely to be found near dumps that accept
toxic wastes and near industrial sites. Thousands of sites have been identified
in Southern California where industry and, in some cases, local governments
have dumped or spilled hazardous materials that could represent some risk to
the public health.
</P>
<P>
Soil pollutants may pose a general health risk if they contaminate ground water
supplies. In addition, extremely toxic pollutants may be produced when organic
chemicals are burned.

   Here are the major provisions of the clean air
bill signed into law by President Bush:
   URBAN SMOG
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   -Aims to cut smog 15 percent in the first six years and 3
percent annually until federal air quality standards are met.
Cities must meet standards within five to 17 years, depending on
severity of problem. Los Angeles has 20 years.
   -Requires new emission controls on factories, businesses and
automobiles to meet smog reduction goals.
   MOTOR VEHICLES
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   -Lowers limits on smog-causing hydrocarbon emissions by 40
percent (0.25 grams per mile) and nitrogen oxide emissions by 60
percent (0.41 gpm).
   -Phases in alternative fuel cars for fleets and under a
California pilot program for private cars. Pilot program calls for
300,000 cars by 1999 and may be adopted by other states.
   -Requires on-board canisters to capture vapors during refueling
and extends warranties on emissions control equipment from 50,000
to 100,000 miles.
   -Cleaner burning gasoline blends must be sold in cities with
worst smog problems.
   AIRBORNE TOXINS
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   -Factories must install ``maximum achievable control
technology'' to reduce release of 189 toxic chemicals, including
many that cause cancer, by 90 percent by 2000.
   -Additional controls required if needed to assure ``ample margin
of safety'' from cancer-causing pollutants. EPA must develop urban
pollution control programs to cut cancer risk by 75 percent by
1995.
   -Creates chemical safety board to investigate chemical release
accidents.
   ACID RAIN
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   -Coal-burning electric power plants must cut sulfur dioxide
emissions by 10 million tons, or roughly in half, by 2000, when
emissions will be capped at 8.9 million tons a year. Nitrogen oxide
emissions also are reduced.
   -Utilities may buy and sell ``pollution credits'' to reduce cost
of emission controls at dirty plants and allow for future
expansion.
   OZONE DEPLETION
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   -Phases out production of chemicals - such as
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons - that damage the
stratospheric ozone layer by 2000. Requires recycling of chemicals
after 1992. Also curbs use of some substitutes.
   PENALTIES
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   -Maximum $25,000 a day in civil penalty for violators and
possible criminal prosecution of corporate executives in cases
where they knowingly pollute and significantly endanger health.
   -Government may impose sanctions, including loss of highway
funds or curbs on construction, if states and cities fail to meet
air quality standards.

<HEAD>Initial Effort to Tighten Auto Emissions Standards Fails</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House members who want stricter auto emissions
standards say they won't let an initial defeat prevent another bid
to toughen President Bush's clean air bill.
   Administration opponents on the Energy and Commerce environment
subcommittee failed Tuesday to amend the bill, as they sought to
make auto requirements far tougher than those in smog-choked
California.
   Panel Chairman Henry A. Waxman's plan lost on a voice vote, but
the California Democrat said his forces would make another attempt
_ possibly today, when the subcommittee considers more amendments
to the administration plan.
   ``Many didn't want to go with our provisions,'' he said, but
predicted some members might support ``a middle-ground, something
like the California standards.''
   California has the toughest auto pollution requirements in the
country, exceeding federal requirements for the rest of the nation,
because its ozone problem is so serious.
   Motor vehicle emissions are a prime source of ozone, although
some pollutants also contribute to the other problems the bill is
trying to address: acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals.
   Ozone is a highly reactive gas that is the prime ingredient of
smog, a term coined by combining smoke and fog. Ozone is produced
by the combination of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides in the
presence of sunlight and heat. Both gases are produced from mobile
sources _ cars, trucks and buses _ but also from stationary sources
_ major industrial plants, such as utilities, and some small
businesses.
   The outgunned Waxman, who is closely allied with environmental
organizations, conceded defeat without requesting a roll call.
   ``Sometimes you don't want them on record so they can rethink
their position and come around,'' said Waxman, who can renew his
proposal in the full Energy and Commerce Committee and the House
floor if he loses in subcommittee. The Senate has not begun
amending clean air legislation.
   Rep. Norman F. Lent, R-N.Y., the main GOP sponsor of the Bush
legislation, said Waxman's proposals would have cost consumers an
extra $500 per car if fully implemented by model year 2000. For
that expense, he said pollution under Waxman's plan would only be
cut an additional 2.7 percent compared to the Bush proposal.
   Motor vehicles are mainly responsible for ozone pollution,
although some emissions also release toxic chemicals and a
component of acid rain.
   Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa., said he supported Waxman's plan in
order to ``send ... the right kind of signal'' to the auto industry
and the public: that Congress backs ``the strictest limits.''
   But he added, ``We don't know where those numbers are going to
lead us.''
   The latter point was made repeatedly by Lent, who said the
technology doesn't exist to meet the Waxman standards, but only is
alive in ``the dreams of the authors'' of the amendment. ``Even
California is smart enough not to adopt these standards,'' he
argued.
   Waxman's plan would have limited hydrocarbon emissions to 0.25
grams per mile from 1993 through 1999, and 0.125 grams per mile
after that.
   Nitrogen oxides, an ingredient of acid rain, would have been
capped at 0.4 grams per mile from 1993-99, and 0.2 grams afterward.
   Carbon monoxide, a toxic pollutant, was set at 3.4 grams per
mile from 1992-99 _ retaining current law _ and 1.7 grams afterward
under the Waxman proposal.
   The Bush standard for hydrocarbons is 0.25 grams per mile by
1998; for nitrogen oxides, 0.7 grams by the same year; and
retention of the current 3.4 gram carbon monoxide limit.
   California's limits for hydrocarbons starting in 1995 will be
0.25 grams per mile for 50,000 miles and 0.31 grams between 50,000
and 100,000 miles.
   The state's nitrogen oxide limit, already in effect, is 0.4
grams up to 50,000 miles. The carbon monoxide standard now is 3.4
grams but rises to 4.2 between 50,000 and 100,000 miles.
   Current federal law outside California requires car limits of
0.41 grams per mile for hydrocarbons, 1 gram for nitrogen oxides
and 3.4 grams for carbon monoxide.

   Chevron Chemical Co. said it will close and mothball its ammonia-fertilizer plant in Pascagoula, Miss., by Jan. 28 because of a continuing slump in the nitrogen-fertilizer industry.

   The plant, which has annual output of about 525,000 tons, is one of four nitrogenfertilizer facilities that Chevron Chemical currently owns and operates.

   The Chevron Corp. unit will reassign the plant's 40 employees to other jobs at its Pascagoula oil refinery, where the ammonia plant is located.
The unit added that it intends to reopen the plant "when market conditions justify" operating the facility.

   The nitrogen-fertilizer industry in the Midwest and Gulf Coast states has been hit hard by a recent increase in fertilizer imports, a spokesman for the unit said.
Chevron Chemical expects demand for nitrogen fertilizers to remain low through 1987.

   Last month, the unit sold two Midwest specialty fertilizer facilities and purchased two nitrogen-fertilizer plants in the Pacific Northwest as part of an effort to concentrate fertilizer operations in that region.

   Chevron Corp. has petroleum and related operations.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have no doubt that many of your chemically trained readers
experienced the same delicious frisson as I when they read Clive Cookson's
item 'Nitrous Acid gets last laugh' (April 10).
Suffice it to say that intractable confusion between nitrous oxide (laughing
gas) and nitrous acid (an entirely distinct compound known only in an
aqueous solution) rendered the entire article largely meaningless.
Nitrous and nitric acids are present as pollutants in atmospheric water
droplets largely as a result of emissions of two other oxides of nitrogen
(nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) from petrol combustion and other
chemical processes.
However, I was particularly entertained by the prospect of dentists using
nitrous acid in high concentration as an anaesthetic.
It would be unlikely to induce the last (or any other) laugh, but I can
confidently predict the last gasp, the last rites and the last will and
testament in that order.

<HEAD>Study: Acid Rain Contributing To Death Of Marine Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acid rain's ``sewage from the sky'' is an
important and unrecognized contributor to the death of marine life
in East Coast estuaries and coastal waters, an environmental group
said Monday.
   Nitrate compounds originating in the atmosphere, mostly as
nitric acid, appear to contribute about 25 percent of total
nitrogen flowing into Chesapeake Bay, said the Environmental
Defense Fund in a report by staff scientists.
   Ammonium compounds from the atmosphere, mostly originating in
the evaporation of manure, contribute another 14 percent of the
bay's nitrogen load, the report said.
   The damage comes not from the acidity, which is immediately
neutralized by salt water, but from the overload of nutrients
provided by nitrates and ammonium. These fertilizers encourage
``blooms'' of algae that use up oxygen dissolved in the water,
making it difficult for other plants and fish to live, and cut off
light necessary for bottom-anchored plants to grow.
   By contrast, the fund estimated the nitrogen contribution from
fertilizer runoff at 34 percent, municipal and industrial
discharges at 23 percent and direct runoff from animal waste at 4
percent.
   Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric scientist on the fund staff
and one of the study's authors, said, ``This should change forever
our view of the acid rain problem,'' showing that ``sewage from the
sky'' in the form of nitrogen compounds are a major pollutant of
inshore waters.
   Although the fund's scientists concentrated on Chesapeake Bay,
they said there was evidence these airborne compounds also are
contributing to problems in Delaware Bay, Albemarle-Pamlico Sound
in North Carolina, Long Island Sound between New York and
Connecticut and the New York Bight in the Atlantic Ocean off New
York and New Jersey.
   Nationwide, a little more than 21 million tons of nitrogen
oxides are emitted from all sources, about one third from motor
vehicle exhausts, one third from power plant smokestacks and one
seventh from industrial boilers.
   The fund said it had provided the first estimate of how much of
the nitrogen flowing into the bay originates in the atmosphere,
both as runoff into streams and as direct precipitation on the
bay's surface.
   The fund's estimate of 154,000 tons of nitrogen compounds
flowing into the bay from all sources was higher than the 110,000
estimated by the federal-state Chesapeake Bay pollution control
program for an average year, but within the range of that program's
estimates of 92,000 tons for a dry year to 198,000 tons for a wet
year.
   The joint program has set a goal of reducing nitrogen loading on
the bay by 40 percent, and the fund's report said a 40 percent
reduction should be aimed for in airborne nitrogen.
   Oppenheimer called for enactment of one of the acid rain control
bills pending before Congress, saying, ``With the exception of new
auto controls, the states on the Atlantic Seaboard can begin this
program on their own, but they cannot finish it. ... A strong
federal role is absolutely necessary.''
   Bob Beck, environment manager of the Edison Electric Institute,
the major trade association of private utilities, said nitrogen
oxides from his industry were declining.
   Chris Rice, spokesman for the Environmental Protection Agency,
said EPA had not had a chance to study the fund's report and thus
could not comment immediately.
   The report kicks off three days of rallies, press conferences
and other events by environmental groups seeking an acid rain
control program that the Reagan administration opposes on the
grounds that not enough is known to justify it. The activity is
timed to coincide with the visit of Canadian Prime Minister Brian
Mulroney, who also is seeking a U.S. program because half the acid
rain falling in Canada originates in the United States.

<HEAD>Report Says Air Pollutants Must Be Attacked in Combination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air pollutants must be attacked in
combination, not one by one, because that's the way they are
helping to kill trees and stunt crops across the country, an
environmental research group said Thursday.
   Policymakers risk worsening other pollution if they attack a
single pollutant, said James MacKenzie and Mohammed El-Ashry, the
authors of a report for the World Resources Institute.
   For example, current strategies to reduce urban ozone could be
increasing ozone in rural areas, said MacKenzie.
   The Environmental Protection Agency disagreed with that
conclusion.
   The World Resources Institute study said crop losses could be as
large as $5 billion a year from ozone, but they were unable to
estimate monetary damages to forests.
   Dying trees in the East, primarily some pines in the Southeast
and red spruce in the Appalachian Mountains, probably are being
killed by the interaction of ozone and the sulfuric and nitric
acids in acid rain, they said.
   Ozone in rural areas throughout the country appears to be
roughly twice the normal background level, the study said. At high
altitudes in the East it sometimes reaches concentrations the EPA
has defined as unhealthy in cities.
   The American Paper Institute said it was awaiting a response
from its experts before commenting on the report. In the past, the
institute has said it has seen no evidence that trees its member
companies rely on are being harmed by air pollution.
   Like several other environmental groups, the World Resources
Institute argued for a 10-million ton reduction in annual emissions
of the raw material for sulfuric acid, sulfur dioxide, from power
plant and industrial boilers, and a 5-million ton reduction in
nitrogen dioxide emissions, the raw material for nitric acid, from
boilers and motor vehicles. The two acids are the major components
of acid rain.
   ``We should avoid taking action that corrects one problem at the
expense of others,'' said El-Ashry.
   For example, he said utilities should not be forced to install
expensive ``scrubbers'' to remove sulfur dioxide from smokestacks,
as the current Clean Air Act requires for new plants.
   ``That actually works against the carbon dioxide problem and the
greenhouse effect (warming of the earth),'' he said. The
requirement works to lock in coal to the boilers in question
``rather than allowing fuel switching,'' which would use fuels that
emit less carbon dioxide in burning and thus cause less warming of
the earth.
   Another example is EPA's focus on reducing emissions of one
urban precursor of ozone, reactive hydrocarbons like unburned
gasoline, and ignoring the other precursor, nitrogen oxides,
MacKenzie said.
   ``Those nitrogen oxides will generate ozone in the countryside
and that still comes down as nitric acid,'' he said in arguing that
both should be reduced together.
   The way the chemistry is believed to work, a reduction of urban
nitrogen oxides or a simultaneous reduction of both nitrogen oxides
and hydrocarbons might increase ozone in some urban areas, said
Jennifer Logan, an atmospheric chemist at Harvard University.
   Informed of her view, MacKenzie said such an effect is possible
in some areas, and, ``You have to be careful'' to make reductions
in such ways to avoid it.
   The report cited recent research showing that as little as 1
part per billion of nitrogen oxides in forests can form large
amounts of ozone from the hydrocarbons emitted by trees, isoprene
and the terpene family of compounds.
   Ms. Logan said 35 percent of nitrogen oxides are believed to
originate in small cities or rural areas.
   Without new control measures, nitrogen oxides are projected to
increase in coming decades, and ``this means more ozone damage to
the forests,'' MacKenzie said.
   Gerald Emisson, head of EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and
Standards at Research Triangle Park, N.C., said that with computer
models, ``When we have looked at the Northeastern United States on
a very crude scale, we don't see big ozone contrations taking place
if you don't control nitrogen oxides ... Very tentative results do
not lead us to say there's a big problem in the forests.''

<HEAD>Researcher Says Urban Air Cleanup Efforts May Be Missing Mark</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Urban air cleanup programs are neglecting
sources of pollution that might be killing trees in rural areas,
according to an environmental researcher.
   By concentrating on efforts to limit emissions of hydrocarbons,
rather than nitrogen oxides, the urban programs could be allowing
nitric acids to form ozone in other areas, said James J. MacKenzie,
one of the authors of a report released today by the World
Resources Institute.
   An official of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gerald
Emisson, said the agency's latest computer models showed no such
result, at least for the Northeast.
   Ozone, which damages the lungs, is believed by many researchers
to be helping to kill high-altitude red spruce in the eastern
United States and several species in West Germany. It is formed
from the reaction in sunlight of volatile hydrocarbons such as
gasoline and the nitrogen oxides emitted in all combustion.
   Quite small concentrations of nitrogen oxides, in contact with
hydrocarbon compounds from trees, can form ozone, according to
research completed within the past year.
   The hydrocarbons from trees, mainly terpene or isoprene, ``in
the presence of almost trace amounts of nitrogen oxides, about 1
part per billion, can produce fairly large amounts of ozone,''
noted a report authored by MacKenzie and institute Vice President
Mohammed T. El-Ashry.
   In trying to bring 68 cities and other areas into compliance
with federal clean air standards for ozone, EPA seeks lower
emissions of compounds such as gasoline. In polluted urban areas,
reductions in nitrogen oxides can increase ozone at first before
eventually reducing it.
   ``All that (nitrogen oxide emitted in urban areas) is going to
go somewhere. It's going to increase ozone in rural areas,''
MacKenzie said in an interview.
   ``I think (EPA's policy) is a mistake. ... In urban areas you
have to reduce both'' hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides, he said.
   Emisson, head of EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and
Standards at Research Triangle Park, N.C., said that with computer
models, ``when we have looked at the Northeastern United States on
a very crude scale, we don't see big ozone concentrations taking
place if you don't control nitrogen oxides ... Very tentative
results do not lead us to say there's a big problem in the
forests.''
   The institute surveyed the latest research on the effects of
ozone and acid rain on crops and forests. Like many other
environmental groups and several proposals in Congress, it called
for a 50 percent reduction in emissions of sulfur dioxide from
industrial and utility fossil fuel burning, a major precursor of
acid rain, and a 25 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen
oxides, which become nitric acid and increase rainfall acidity.
   Today's typical rural concentrations of ozone are roughly twice
normal background. They probably reduce overall crop yields by 5
percent to 10 percent, resulting in the loss of about $5 billion a
year, the report said.
   Ozone on rural mountain peaks in the east can approach levels
EPA has defined as unhealthy, and the frequent clouds shrouding the
peaks can be 100 times more acidic than rainfall, the report noted.
   The report itself did not examine EPA's urban-air strategies.
   Heavy doses of ozone have long been known to kill trees
directly. The report outlined theories by which the acids and ozone
in combination could be killing trees by leaching out nutrients or
leaving them too ill to resist drought or insects.
   A 1987 scientific paper cited in the report said, ``In the
absence of (man-made nitrogen oxide) emissions, isoprene
contributes little to ozone formation.''
   A simultaneous reduction of both nitrogen oxides and
hydrocarbons still might initially increase ozone in some urban
areas, said Jennifer Logan, an atmospheric chemist at Harvard
University. Emisson agreed, noting that no one knows yet which
cities might reduce nitrogen oxides without increasing ozone
locally.
   ``An approach that helps ozone in urban areas might not do a lot
of good in rural areas,'' Ms. Logan said. ``It's important to
recognize that this is being actively investigated and people are
only beginning to grasp the science,'' but policymakers could find
themselves forced to favor trees or people, she said.
   ``In a lot of the Northeast, it doesn't make a lot of
difference'' to ozone formation whether urban nitrogen oxides are
reduced, ``but if you get into the more forested areas it can make
a difference,'' Ms. Logan said.

   Dealing a setback to the Bush administration's
clean air bill, the Senate majority leader says it needs major
surgery if the nation is to reduce auto pollution, toxic chemicals
and an acid rain component.
   Majority Leader George J. Mitchell made clear Monday he plans to
revamp the measure, telling reporters he has no intention of making
sponsorship of failed clean air legislation his ``life's work.''
   While Mitchell _ chief sponsor of clean air measures for a
decade _ was largely critical of the legislation, the powerful
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee gave Bush's
legislation a lukewarm endorsement.
   At the first congressional hearing on the legislation, Energy
and Commerce Chairman John D. Dingell, D-Mich., called the proposal
the ``best vehicle'' for breaking a decade-long clean air
stalemate. He lashed out at ``Detroit-bashing'' critics who believe
the bill is too soft on automakers.
   Dingell, while praising the overall pollution reduction he said
the bill would achieve, warned he has reservations about several
parts of the proposal and cautioned that the measure could ``have
devastating effects'' on the auto industry and its workers.
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly,
at the same hearing, asked members of the House Energy and Commerce
environment subcommittee to support the legislation.
   Reilly said the bill will ``make the 1990s the clean air
decade'' and insisted it will force industry to rid the skies of
pollution while taking into account the cost to business of
reducing acid rain, ozone smog and airborne toxic chemicals.
   He said the legislation also will give industry incentives to
cut pollution by giving business the flexibility to work out
alternatives and trade ``credits'' for achieving more cleanup than
required.
   However, Mitchell said Bush ``avoided virtually every tough
choice'' in his legislation and gave too much discretion to the EPA
administrator to enforce the law.
   Mitchell said language to let automakers meet new anti-pollution
requirements by averaging auto emissions represents a major retreat
from current law. Averaging would allow some cars to exceed new
anti-pollution standards while other vehicles would meet them with
room to spare.
   The averaging would cause confusion in emissions testing,
Mitchell said, because it would be nearly impossible to tell
whether a particular car should pass.
   Mitchell called the Bush bill ``especially weak'' on nitrogen
oxides, the second main ingredient of acid rain that harms lakes
and streams.
   ``Incredibly, the president proposes to permit increases in
(nitrogen oxide) emissions,'' Mitchell said, because Bush would
reduce nitrogen oxides by 2 million tons by the year 2000, while
emissions of the substance are expected to grow by 3 million tons
in the same period.
   The senator, however, praised Bush's plan to reduce sulfur
dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by 2000, compared with 1980
levels. Sulfur dioxide is the major acid rain component.
   Mitchell said it was ``most disturbing'' that the cleanup of
toxic chemicals under Bush's plan would take into account the cost
to industry when protecting Americans' health.
   He attacked the so-called ``unreasonable risk'' health standard,
in which economists would perform a ``cost-benefit analysis
estimating how much a human life is worth and how many must be at
risk before additional control of toxic air pollutants is
warranted.''
   Dingell said he had several other reservations about the bill,
including:
   _Provisions that fail to give states credit for past reductions
of sulfur dioxide.
   _The failure to protect between 20,000 and 50,000 jobs in the
soft coal and related industries, which could result from new
requirements on utilities.
   _A cap on sulfur dioxide emissions after the year 2000, which he
said could ``tilt in favor of some fuel to the detriment of coal.''

<TEXT>
   The Journal recently summarized the national debate over clean-air legislation as a trivial fight for air that's "cleaner than clean" ("The Hot-Air Bill," editorial, Aug. 3).

   Nothing could be further from the truth -- just look (or breathe) for yourself.

   While the Journal tells us not to worry -- the Environmental Protection Agency tells us smog levels violate federal health standards in more than 100 cities.
The American Academy of Pediatrics tells us smog levels in most cities could scar children's lungs permanently.
Industry tells us it annually releases 2.7 billion pounds of toxic chemicals into the air.
The EPA tells us that levels of toxic air pollutants threaten adults in many areas with cancer risks as high as one in 100.
And health experts from the Harvard School of Public Health tell us that air pollution contributes to one out of every 20 premature deaths in the country.

   It is because our air quality is so poor that I have such strong differences with the clean-air legislation that President Bush sent to Congress last month.
My criticisms of the administration proposal are based not on the very minor issues identified by the Journal, but on the fundamental inadequacy of the proposal to address these important public-health problems.

   The legislation would repeal provisions protecting the national parks and other clean-air areas from ozone and nitrogenoxide emissions.
It would relax restrictions on the tall smokestacks that foil local regulators by exporting air pollutants to downwind jurisdictions.
And it authorizes the EPA to exempt half of the major sources of toxic emissions from regulation -- permanently.

   The single biggest problem with the administration bill is its motor-vehicle provisions.
"Mobile sources" (principally cars and trucks) are the main culprits in most of our air-pollution problems.
They cause more than 70% of carbon-monoxide pollution, 50% of hydrocarbon pollution, 45% of nitrogen-oxide pollution, and 50% of the cancer deaths due to toxic emissions.
They also contribute significantly to global warming and ozone depletion.

   Yet the administration bill cut a sweetheart deal with the auto makers that relaxes many of the current motor-vehicle standards.
The bill eliminates the requirement that each car meet pollution standards in favor of a program that would allow car makers to "average" the performance of vehicles.
Since car-company data show that average emissions are now already well below the standards proposed in the administration bill, auto emissions would actually be allowed to increase from today's levels.

   Ironically, the administration bill is as big an economic fiasco as an environmental one.
Pollution cutting is a zero-sum game.
What we don't cut from cars, we have to cut from shoe factories and bakeries and other local pollution sources, where pollution control usually costs much more.
Even the EPA's own estimates show that mobile-source controls that the administration bill rejected -- such as requiring that catalytic converters work the full life of the vehicle (100,000 miles), or controlling gasoline evaporation and refueling emissions with "onboard canisters" -- are cheap ways to get pollution reductions.

   A case in point is nitrogen-oxide pollution, which contributes to smog, acid rain and particulate pollution.
If the administration bill had adopted, say, the California standards for motor-vehicle nitrogen-oxide emissions, it would have removed an additional 1.3 million tons of nitrogen oxide from our skies at a cost of about $600 a ton ($20 a car).
Now states and cities will have to get these reductions from electric utilities and industrial boilers, where the costs can be as high as $30,000 a ton.

   In certain areas, the administration deserves substantial credit.
On acid rain, the administration bill opts for a "freedom-of-choice" approach that should cost-effectively reduce sulfur-dioxide emissions.
And the administration supports a "clean fuels" program that will offer help to a handful of our most polluted cities.

   But acid-rain controls in the Midwest are no answer to toxic emissions in Texas and Louisiana or smog levels in New York City and Atlanta.
We can't solve these problems without real pollution-control mandates that are simply missing in the president's bill.
What's at stake isn't air that's "whiter than white" as the Journal suggests -- it's air that pediatricians say is safe for our children to breathe.

   Supporters of President Bush's clean air bill
defeated an attempt Tuesday to make it require auto exhausts
cleaner than those now in force in smog-plagued California.
   The tough provision proposed by Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif.,
was defeated by voice vote in the House Energy and Commerce
environment subcommittee he chairs.
   The subcommittee is considering amendments to Bush's legislation
to clean the skies of ozone, acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals.
   The outnumbered Waxman, who is closely allied with environmental
organizations, accepted defeat without a roll call, saying he
wanted to avoid forcing members to take a public position against
stringent automobile controls.
   Waxman, promising to return with a compromise that still would
toughen Bush's auto requirments, said, ``Sometimes you don't want
them on record so they can re-think their position and come
around.''
   Rep. Norman F. Lent, R-N.Y., ranking Republican on the parent
committee and the main GOP sponsor of the Bush legislation, said
Waxman's proposals would have cost consumers an extra $500 per car
if fully implemented for model year 2000. For that expense, he said
pollution under Waxman's plan would only be cut an additional 2.7
percent compared with the Bush legislation.
   Estimates of the cost of current auto emissions contols have
clustered around $1,500 per car in recent years.
   Lent said the technology doesn't exist to meet the Waxman
standards, which he said represented ``the dreams of the authors
and have no basis in technological fact.''
   Whatever happens in the subcommittee, the battle over auto
standards is expected to surface again in the full Energy and
Commerce Committee and the House floor. The Senate has not yet
begun work on clean air legislation.
   Motor vehicles are a major contributor to ozone pollution, in
some areas the principal contributor, through the emission of
unburned fuel vapors. They also emit oxides of nitrogen and carbon
monoxide
   Ozone, the prime ingredient of smog, is produced by the reaction
of hydrocarbons _ unburned fuel _ and nitrogen oxides in the
presence of sunlight and heat. Because of its ozone problems,
California has tougher auto pollution standards than the rest of
the nation.
   Waxman's plan would have limited hydrocarbon emissions to 0.25
grams per mile _ the standard for California starting in 1995 _
from 1993 through 1999, and 0.125 grams per mile after that.
Outside California, cars are limited to 0.41 grams per mile under
current law.
   Nitrogen oxides, which also contribute to acid rain, would have
been capped at 0.4 grams per mile from 1993 through 1999, down from
1 gram now, and 0.2 grams after 1999.
   Waxman's proposed limit for carbon monoxide was 3.4 grams per
mile from 1992 through 1999, the current standard, and 1.7 grams
afterwards.
   The administration's proposed standard for hydrocarbons is 0.25
grams per mile by 1998; for nitrogen oxides, 0.7 grams by the same
year; and for carbon monoxide, retention of the current 3.4 gram
limit.
   Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa., who supported Waxman, said, ``We are
really in the dark. Our eyes glaze over at these numbers.''

The concentration of harmful ozone pollution in the lower atmosphere has more
than doubled in the last 100 years, and it will likely rise at an even faster
rate in the next 30 years, researchers said last week.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Britain's Harwell Laboratory said recent measurements of
ground-level ozone indicate that levels of the gas are, on the average, twice
as high as recorded by French researchers in Paris in the late 1800s.
</P>
<P>
When it is in the upper atmosphere, ozone shields Earth from the sun's
ultraviolet rays, which can cause skin cancer and other health problems. But
when found near ground level, the highly corrosive form of oxygen can cause
respiratory distress.
</P>
<P>
Ozone is not emitted directly into the air, but is formed through complex
reactions with nitrogen oxide and other chemicals found in automobile and
industrial emissions containing nitrogen oxide.
</P>
<P>
Based on projected increases in nitrogen oxide emissions, researchers said
their computer simulations show that between now and 2020, concentrations of
ground-level or, "tropospheric," ozone will rise "at a rate faster than during
the past 100 years." In fact, the study, in the journal Nature, found the
increase in tropospheric ozone during the next 30 years could equal that for
the entire last century.

   Ethyl Plan to Seek Approval for Gas Additives

   PHILADELPHIA -- This week's uptick in one chemical
company's shares caught analysts by surprise and prompted
some to wonder: "What's up, Ethyl?"
   The Street is intrigued by Ethyl's Tuesday announcement
that it will seek federal approval for a gasoline additive
designed to cut air pollution.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   With all the environmental hoopla and government
initiatives to reduce automobile emissions, the Street is
finding "an opportunity to take a new liking to Ethyl," says
one analyst. Ethyl jumped 2 1/8 Tuesday, before subsiding 3/8
yesterday to 27 1/2.
   Several analysts say that if the additive is approved --
and that's a big if at this point -- Ethyl's annual earnings
could grow as much as $1 a share above projections and the
stock could rise to the high 30s within two to three years --
with $5 of that coming from the additive.
   The manganese-based additive, known as MMT, could have a
potential market of $350 million a year if used in all
gasoline sold in the U.S. Ethyl estimates potential sales
initially at $100 million to $150 million a year.
   "This could be the right product at the right time" to
help oil refiners and auto manufacturers meet stricter Clean
Air Act standards, says Leonard Bogner of Prudential-Bache
Securities.
   Even the most bullish analysts, however, warn that chances
for approval are probably only 50% or slightly better. The
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which must issue a
decision within six months, is concerned that the additive
could actually increase certain types of emissions --
hydrocarbons -- that contribute to smog. And the auto
industry has previously opposed MMT on grounds that it could
damage pollution-control equipment, especially catalytic
converters.
   Charles LoCastro of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette says he
isn't comfortable recommending the stock because chances of
approval are only "50-50." He notes that the EPA twice
rejected the additive, in 1978 and 1981, and there isn't any
sign that car makers will be more supportive this time.
Ethyl's stock is fully valued at 27 1/2 and stands to decline
from there if MMT fails again, Mr. LoCastro says.
   Ethyl says results of exhaustive testing will convince
even the most hardened skeptics. The company drove a fleet of
48 new cars more than 75,000 miles each to compare tailpipe
emissions and reliability using unleaded fuel with and
without MMT. Ray Wilkins Jr., a senior vice president of
Ethyl, says the additive produced a striking 20% reduction in
nitrogen oxide emissions, but a 6% increase in hydrocarbons,
causing an overall 7.5% reduction in emissions, including
nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide.
   Many cars using MMT in the test met strict nitrogen oxide
emission standards being proposed in Congress, and none
violated any existing standards (including those for
hydrocarbons), Mr. Wilkins says. Even with increased tailpipe
hydrocarbons, Ethyl argues, there could be a drop in
hydrocarbons overall because the additive would allow
gasoline refiners to make fuel that is less susceptible to
evaporation. Yet the projected overall 7.5% reduction in
tailpipe emissions still wouldn't meet standards that
Congress is considering mandating for the smoggiest cities.
   "I'm very optimistic we'll have support from the auto and
oil industries and environmentalists," Mr. Wilkins says. The
additive, which would be marketed under the name HiTEC 3000,
has been used widely in Canada for more than a decade with no
apparent ill effects on cars or public health. Athough Ethyl
invented the additive in 1954, so far the U.S. has allowed
its use only in leaded fuel, which accounts for just 6% of
gasoline sales.
   Mary Smith, an EPA official in charge of reviewing Ethyl's
test results, said she couldn't comment on the additive's
chances of approval. But, she said, EPA will scrutinize
closely whether it would reduce the ability of cars to meet
hydrocarbon standards. Spokesmen for Exxon and General Motors
said they couldn't comment until they review Ethyl's test
results.
   Though the additive could become Ethyl's fastest-growing
product, some analysts like its other businesses. Mr. Bogner
calls Ethyl an "aggressive buy" that could earn $2.10 a share
this year and $2.40 next year. If the additive is approved,
he might raise his 1991 estimate five cents to 10 cents a
share. Ethyl, based in Richmond, Va., "could trade in the low
30s over the next six to nine months" without the additive,
and in the high 30s within two years if MMT is approved, he
says.
   John Henry of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets has
recommended Ethyl for some time, in part because of the
additive's potential. His estimates are $2.05 this year and
$2.35 in 1991, and he says MMT could be worth an extra 20
cents to 30 cents a share in 1991 and a $1 a share in several
years: "All this proposed legislation is creating markets for
products that help gas burn cleaner."
   Other companies are benefiting from the drive for cleaner
fuels. Arco Chemical reports fast sales growth for MTBE, an
ether-based product that increases octane and reduces
emissions when blended with gasoline. Ethyl says its additive
can be used with MTBE or other agents to provide greater
reductions in nitrogen oxides.

  [Text] The National Institute of Materials &amp; Chemical
Research (NIMC) of the Agency of Industrial Science and
Technology has successfully increased the alcohol combustion
temperature by 30 percent at maximum by controlling the
combustion state with a magnetic field. The concentration of
oxygen at the combustion temperature was controlled because of
the attraction of oxygen to a magnetic field. NIMC plans to
study applications of this technology to internal-combustion
engines including turbines, hoping to be able to eventually
develop a universal technology for increasing combustion
efficiency.
  Atmospheric oxygen is a magnetic material that is attracted
to a magnet. In contrast, atmospheric nitrogen, which accounts
for 80 percent constituent of the atmosphere, is hardly affected
by a magnet. Based on these facts, NIMC controlled combustion by
burning fuel where only oxygen can be constantly supplied with
the aid of a magnetic field created by an electromagnet or a
permanent magnet.
  NIMC carried out combustion experiments in air with a
platinum catalyst and checked variations in the combustion
temperature. A 1 x 2 cm piece of asbestos was placed between the
N and S poles of an electromagnet, more specifically, near the
end of the magnet where the magnetic field strength changes
suddenly. This is the place that is said to be most suitable for
promoting combustion with oxygen's circulation activated by the
magnet's attraction.
  A constant amount of fuel, butanol or gasoline, was fed to
the asbestos piece with the attached platinum catalyst from the
side that is within a magnetic field. Oxygen was introduced from
the other side (no magnetic field) of the asbestos piece. The
combustion temperature was measured at a point 70 cm away from
the asbestos piece.
  As a result, it was discovered that gasoline, which burned
at
440�C prior to the application of a magnetic field now
burned at 480�C with the magnetic field, showing a 10
percent increase in combustion temperature. In the case of
butanol, a 30 percent increase in combustion temperature was
reportedly observed.
  At NIMC, Chief Researcher Nobuko Wakayama says, ``It appears
possible to use a magnetic field to improve combustion
efficiency.'' She adds that in the future, attempts will be made
to apply the technology to chemical reactions including
electrolysis and oxidation-reduction processes, and combustion
under microgravity.
  Although there had hardly been any precedent of practical
application of a magnetic field to control chemical reactions,
NIMC is hopeful that the technology can be effective in fuel
consumption and diesel exhaust treatment because nitrogen oxides
(NO[.sub]x[/]) and hydroxides, in addition to oxygen, can be
attracted by a magnetic field.

<HL> Ozone Scare Generates Much Heat, Little Light

   Another ozone scare appears to be upon us, and it could be just as misleading as the one that led Congress to cancel the SST prototype in 1971.
Following congressional testimony last month that dangerous melanoma skin cancers had increased 83% in the past seven years, press reports implied that the increase was the result of the destruction of ozone in the atmosphere, which allowed more ultraviolet radiation to reach Earth.
The ozone supposedly was destroyed by widely used chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).

   But there is no reliable evidence that the total amount of ozone has decreased, and any increase in the incidence of melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, must therefore involve other causes.
Indeed, oncologists have proposed many such causes: viruses, genetic predisposition, environmental carcinogens, population shifts to the Sun Belt, changes in life style, earlier detection of melanomas, and even diet.

   In addition, there has been only a modest increase -- well explained without assuming any change in ozone -- in the incidence of non-melanoma skin cancers. (These cancers, which are easily cured, are 20 times more frequent than melanomas) Non-melanoma cancers, such as those removed from the Reagans, seem directly related to exposure to ultraviolet rays and would be expected to increase markedly if ozone were destroyed.

   It is true that over the past several years, localized and temporary decreases in ozone levels have been observed high in the Antarctic stratosphere during mid-autumn.
But these findings do not prove that that CFCs are destroying ozone.
A complete explanation is not yet available; in the presence of the world's lowest temperature, atmospheric chemistry may be quite unusual.
Some scientists believe that ozone is not lost at all but simply moves about as atmospheric motions bring in ozone-depleted air for a few weeks.
In any case, ozone changes over the Antarctic cannot affect melanoma rates in the U.S.

   This is not the first ozone scare.
Before 1970, it was generally believed that the creation and destruction of ozone in the stratosphere -- where most of it is located -- was caused only by solar ultraviolet radiation.
But then the political controversy over the construction of prototypes for a supersonic transport aircraft focused attention on potential environmental effects of an eventual fleet of 500 SSTs.

   According to then-prevailing scientific wisdom, water vapor from the SST exhaust was supposed to destroy ozone, admitting more ultraviolent radiation to the earth's surface.
It was soon discovered, however, that water vapor doesn't destroy ozone very effectively.
Attention next focused on nitrogen oxides (NOX), which also were produced by SST fuel combustion and were said to be a much more potent ozone-destroyer than water vapor.
Based on our present knowledge, however, while NOX would lead to a modest destruction of ozone in the upper stratosphere, it would increase the amount of ozone in the lower stratosphere.
So much for the accuracy of predictions.

   The latest candidate as an ozone destroyer -- and the one that is causing concern today -- is chlorine, and its most important stratospheric source may be the CFCs.
These are inert gases used mainly in aerosol cans and refrigeration, and as blowing agents for plastic foams and as solvents.
Chemically stable, they survive in the lower atmosphere, but are finally broken down by solar ultraviolet radiation when they percolate into the stratosphere, releasing chlorine.

   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that constant growth of CFC use at an annual rate of 2.5% could remove sufficient ozone to cause an additional one million non-melanoma skin cancers over the lifetime of the present U.S. population.
These numbers look huge until they are compared with the current U.S. rate of about 500,000 new cases each year.
Even so, the EPA numbers are only upper limits, and about as likely as the lower limits, which are zero.
The relation between ozone depletion and skin-cancer increases is based on a simple-minded statistical analysis that neglects all factors except the variation of solar ultraviolet radiation with geographic latitude.

   With this fragile scientific base, and many questions still unanswered, the U.S. has taken the lead on international controls of CFCs, supported mainly by the Scandinavian countries -- which do not manufacture CFCs.
Opposed are Britain, France, Japan and the East Bloc -- which do manufacture CFCs and would be forced to close down existing facilities if an international production phasedown is agreed upon.
Because skin cancers occur mainly among Caucasians, the Third World has not gotten too excited about CFCs, even though ultraviolet intensity is greatest near the equator.

   Du Pont has already developed substitutes -- albeit more costly ones -- to comply with the self-imposed U.S. ban on the use of CFCs in aerosol cans that went into effect in the mid-1970s.
Substitution for spray cans is simple -- compressed hydrocarbons.
But it is costly for refrigerators and other industrial uses.
U.S. production of CFCs today is only half of its 1974 peak of 400,000 tons, but it is rising.
Non-U.S. production has been increasing slowly since 1974 and now stands at 600,000 tons a year.

   Plans to phase out CFCs internationally have made substantial progress, spearheaded by the U.S. State Department.
In 1985, the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer created a framework for a protocol to control CFCs.
The U.S. Senate ratified this convention last July.
Having achieved this first step, the enthusiasts for international controls, backed by the EPA and assorted environmental groups, are now pushing for a protocol to phase out, or at least freeze, CFC production world-wide.

   Even if such controls are rejected by the world community, there are likely to be consequences in terms of U.S. legislation for further unilateral controls, plus pressure on friendly governments to go along with the U.S.
Such pressure may lead to trade policies that could harm international relations.
These economic and political costs will have to be weighed against the risk of damage from a possible reduction in ozone.

   The well-established greenhouse effects of the CFCs that could lead to climate warming need to be included in the risk assessment.
However, their effects are small compared with those of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels, and no one is suggesting that we stop energy production and freeze in the dark.

   One final note: As chemical calculations improve, the projected decreases in ozone caused by CFCs have shrunk.
The National Academy of Sciences issued reports in 1979, 1982 and 1984 projecting ozone losses after the year 2000 of 18%, 7% and about 3%, respectively, from present levels.
Furthermore, human activity will continue to generate pollutants such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen oxides, which will counteract the destruction of ozone by CFCs.
It may well turn out that the effects will cancel each other out, leading to little net change in total ozone.

   President Bush is expected to propose
legislation requiring a 10 million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide
emissions by the year 2000 to combat acid rain, administration and
congressional sources said Friday.
   The new acid-rain standards _ not quite as extensive as the 12
million-ton cut sought by environmentalists but far more rigid than
industry has wanted _ are expected to be a key component in a
clean-air package Bush will unveil on Monday.
   The sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also said
that Bush's package likely would give industries that use clean-coal
technology additional time and flexibility in meeting the standards.
   The legislation will not mandate how industrial plants should go
about reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, giving them the choice of
methods, the sources said.
   And the package will offer special credits and other financial
incentives to industries that surpass the standards, the sources
said.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush had
made some ``preliminary decisions'' on the clean-air package, but
would make up his mind on some of the thornier issues this weekend
while at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md.
   ``He is taking with him decision memos and options on all the
major questions that are still outstanding, and we would expect
decisions over the weekend,'' Fitzwater said.
   It was unclear Friday on how the cuts would be distributed
nationwide, but the president was expected to include a proposal
where a utility excceeding the required reductions could sell
credits to one that had not, permitting the buying to utility to
comply.
   Several sources said the president was provided options that
ranged from forcing the 20 dirtiest plants to come up with most of
the early emission reductions to forcing smaller cuts on 107 plants
across the country.
   The president is expected to propose a system by which a utility
that exceeds the reduction requirements may sell credits to another
that has not, bringing the buying utility into compliance.
   American Electric Power, which operates in parts of Ohio,
Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and West Virginia, said Friday if the
20-plant option is adopted, it would be forced to raise residential
electric rates to to its customers from 15 to 25 percent.
   ``The cost of such emission reductions will grind the economies
of the Midwestern states. Our heavy industries which rely upon low
energy costs ... would be devastated,'' maintained A. Joseph Dowd,
senior vice president. of American Electric Power.
   Among the decisions still to be resolved, presumably, are whether
Bush's package _ billed in advance as the most comprehensive
overhaul yet of the 19-year-old Clean Air Act _ will set new
standards for automobile tailpipe exhausts.
   Environmentalists want a requirement that tailpipe emissions of
hydrocarbons and nitrogen dioxide _ which were last reduced in 1981
_ be further reduced by 1993. The automobile industry has voiced
strong objections to any further tightening of the standards.
   Administration officials, perhaps signaling a decision against
tighter tailpipe standards, have stressed in recent days that the
Bush package would put heavy emphasis on alternate auto fuels _ such
as alcohol blends _ that contain fewer contaminants.
   The president also is considering a reduction in nitrogen oxide
emissions, another component of acid rain which primarily comes from
both electric utility plants and automobiles. Options prepared by
the Domestic Policy Council suggested that annual nitrogen oxide
emissions be cut by 2 million to 4 million tons, roughly 10 percent
to 20 percent.
   Nitrogen oxidens are transformed into nitric acid in the
atmosphere, a minority component in acid rain in the East but
nonetheless suspected by many scientists of helping damaqe
high-altitude forests through over-fertilization.
   The president is expected to promote the alternate fuels section
of his bill on Tuesday in a speech at the University of Nebraska in
Lincoln. It's the second day of a two-day Western trip to showcase
the new package.
   He visits Yellowstone National Park on Monday, and gives a talk
on the clean-air package Tuesday morning at the Teton Science School
at Jackson Hole, Wyo.
   The clean-air bill, which Bush on Thursday declared would benefit
the quality of life of every North American, will have three
sections _ dealing with acid rain, urban smog and chemical pollution.
   Sources have said that the section on chemical pollution would
set tough new requirements that would affect hundreds of categories
of businesses, from paint plants to bakeries.
   Cutting sulfur dioxide in the air by 10 million tons by the year
2000, as Bush was expected to recommend, would reduce the
contaminant to roughly half its current level.
   Acid rain is formed when sulfur dioxide, an ingredient of
smokestack emissions from coal-burning utilities and industries,
combines with water in the atmosphere and clouds to form acid which
then returns to Earth in rain and snow.
   Midwestern utilities that burn high-sulfur coal without cleanup
technology are generally agreed to be the chief source of the acid
rain that damages sensitive lakes, streams and aquatic life in
Canada and the Northeast.
   Bush, in his 1989 budget document to Congress, said his
administration was ``committed to ending the long debate on acid
rain.''
   The president also agreed previously to a $5 billion, five-year
joint study with Canada on finding ways to develop cleaner-burning
coal.

<HEAD>Argonne Sells Pollution-Reducing Process To Dravo</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Argonne National Laboratory has sold a process
that could dramatically reduce pollution from coal-fire power
plants to a Pennsylvania company, lab officials said Tuesday.
   The buyer, Dravo Lime Co., of Pittsburgh, which makes chemicals
for smokestack scrubbers, is betting that tighter acid-rain
controls will make the deal a profitable one.
   Officials say the process can be used with existing equipment to
reduce by 70 percent a plant's output of nitrogen oxide _ believed,
along with sulfur oxides, to be a major cause of acid rain.
   ``The driving force on all this is the potential of new
legislation on acid rain,'' said David Livengood, an Argonne
researcher who managed the project.
   Acid rain, formed when the sulfur and nitrogen gases combine
with the air to form acids, is believed to cause widespread damage
to forests and lakes.
   The new process, called Argonox, involves spraying water mixed
with substances called ``metal chelates'' into a chamber through
which coal smoke must pass. The metal chelates then combine with
nitrogen to form a solid substance that can be removed from the
chamber and hauled away.
   Dravo says the new technology will pay for itself because power
plants seeking to comply with tougher acid-rain laws will prefer
the Argonox system, which can be fitted to existing scrubbers, to
other methods requiring costly equipment changes.
   Scrubbers, which use lime to remove sulfur oxides from coal
smoke, have been installed at many power plants and other
industries.
   Dravo spokesman Ron Sommer said the company expected to have a
pilot project installed at the Miami Fort power plant near
Cincinnati sometime in the next year.
   Dravo bought the process from Argonne, a Department of Energy
lab in suburban Lemont operated by the University of Chicago, as
part of a program encouraging the sale of the fruits of government
research to private industry.

<BYLINE>Urban Smog</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Requires states and local authorities to develop pollution
control plans to reduce urban smog and bring air quality in more
than 100 cities within federal health standards. Timetable for
meeting the standards ranged from five to 15 years, with Los
Angeles getting 20 years because of the severity of its problem.
   Smog-causing pollutants, or ozone, are reduced through controls
on automobiles and industry, with annual pollution improvements of
4 percent a year required over first six years.
   Automobiles:
   _Tougher tailpipe emission requirements by 1995 cutting
hydrocarbon releases by 22 percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by
66 percent.
   _Cleaner fuels for all automobiles in nine cities with the worst
pollution. The nine cities are Los Angeles, Houston, New York City,
Milwaukee, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Hartford, Conn., San Diego and
Chicago.
   _Special canisters on auto fuel systems to reduce emissions
during refueling.
   Industrial Sources:
   _Sources emitting 100 tons of smog-causing pollutants must
install new smog control technology, although a waiver may be given
in some cases if pollution control costs exceed $5,000 per ton.
   Current Law: Requires controls on tailpipe emissions, but curbs
widely believed to be inadequate to meet air quality standards amid
growing number of cars on the road. Despite law, more than 100
cities fail to meet federal air quality standards.

to control the release of about 200 hazardous chemicals linked to
cancer, nervous disorders and birth defects. That affects a wide

   The EPA now regulates only seven chemicals.

<BYLINE>Acid Rain</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Requires annual sulfur dioxide releases to be reduced by 10
million tons by 2000, roughly cutting such emissions in half.
   It allows utilities to buy and sell ``pollution credits'' among
themselves as long as total reductions in emissions are not
affected. Extra allowances are given to Midwest utilities and some
``clean'' plants to ease the cost burden and allow for future
growth.
   Nitrogen oxide releases, which also contribute to acid rain,
must be cut by 2.7 million tons.
   It will affects 107 coal-fired electric power plants with
Midwest utilities using high-sulfur coal facing greatest pollution
reduction burden and likely increases in electric rates.
   Current law: Utilities must comply with local air quality
requirements, but have avoided curbs on sulfur dioxide emissions by
building tall smokestacks that send the pollution high into the
atmosphere. Pollutants are carried hundreds of miles and fall as
acid rain.

  [Text] Hitachi Chemical Co., in cooperation with its
subsidiary, Hitachi Chemical Technoplant, developed a wastewater
purification system that efficiently cleans up domestic
wastewater and runs on about 40% less electricity than
conventional systems of its kind. The system simultaneously
performs nitrogen and BOD (biological oxygen demand, a pollution
index) processing. Along with that, the way the system purifies
wastewater results in a shorter process and reduces the area
needed for installation by about 30%. With the increase in
public resources, Hitachi Chemical sees an increase in the
demand for the construction of water treatment facilities. The
company will sell its system to municipalities, and aims for
sales of about &yen;1 billion during FY94.
  The system that was developed is a ``go-round-style
intermittent aeration-purification tank HKN-type'' facility made
of steel-reinforced concrete. Two computer systems, the ``DO
controller'' and the ``sludge controller,'' automatically
control the task called ``aeration,'' which purifies the
nitrogen, BOD, etc., by feeding oxygen into wastewater that is
swirled around the purification tank. The aeration can be done
efficiently because the computers determine the amounts of
pollutants in the water by means of sensors, and then the system
feeds in the appropriate amount of oxygen, without wasting any.
The running cost is low because of the 40% reduction in
the
amount of electric power needed.
  The system can reduce BOD and nitrogen to below 10 PPM to 15
PPM, respectively, and meets the strictest standards set forth
by the Water Pollution Prevention Act. In the past, the
construction of a tank for that level of purification
necessitated the task of obtaining authorization and designation
by the Ministry of Construction. The new purification tank,
however, is the first of its kind in the industry that only
requires general authorization and general designation, and
thereby obviates the preliminary application work.

   WASHINGTON -- A new study by the National Academy of
Sciences is likely to become a key weapon in the oil and auto
industries' battle against tighter pollution controls on cars
and fuel.
   According to the report, the government's 20-year effort
to reduce ground-level ozone -- the prime ingredient in smog
-- may have been misdirected. "There's been a lack of
progress in many areas of the country that's both
disappointing and perplexing," said John Seinfeld, chairman
of a committee of scientists that prepared the report.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As a result of scientific and technical deficiencies, the
study said, policy makers have seriously underestimated the
amount of volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere and
given insufficient attention to controlling nitrogen oxide.
Ozone is formed when volatile organic compounds and nitrogen
oxide react together in sunlight.
   Volatile organic compounds are produced mainly from motor
vehicles, evaporating solvents, the chemical and oil
industries and vegetation. Nitrogen oxide comes from the
combustion of fossil fuel by motor vehicles and electric
power plants.
   The report, scheduled for release this week, was made
available over the weekend after copies were leaked to the
press. The American Petroleum Institute and the Motor Vehicle
Manufacturers Association provided some funding for the
study, which was primarily financed by the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Energy Department.
   The report was required under last year's revisions to the
federal clean air act, which hit hard at the oil and auto
industries. By suggesting that the nation's approach in
attacking smog is flawed, the study could bolster industry
efforts to fend off even tougher requirements.
   Some states are considering whether to join California in
requiring far tougher controls on emissions on cars and fuel
than are required nationally.
   "Why are states going for the most expensive option that
will produce the least gain in air quality?" asked Terry
Yosie, a vice president at the API. "We need a national
debate on the effectiveness of our ozone control policy."
   Environmental groups disagreed vehemently, however. David
Hawkins, senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense
Council, contended that the report shows the need for a
redoubled attack against volatile organic compounds as well
as increased attention to nitrogen oxide.
   Among the report's major findings are the following:
   -- Volatile organic compounds emitted by trees and other
vegetation play a bigger role in smog formation in some areas
than officials have recognized. In cities such as Atlanta,
more volatile organic compounds are emitted by natural
vegetation than by human sources.
   -- The undercounting of volatile organic compounds has led
to a miscalculation of the ratio of hydrocarbons to nitrogen
oxides. This ratio is important in determining which
pollutant is more important to attack in reducing smog. As a
result, in some areas, officials have focused insufficiently
on nitrogen oxide.
   -- The government's main method for measuring smog is
faulty, partly because it doesn't adequately take into
account fluctuating weather patterns.

vision - Tokyo's example / Urban air pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER

<TEXT>
MOSS may not gather on rolling stones but it is growing in Tokyo's parks
again. When scientists at Tokyo's Metropolitan Research Institute for
Environmental Protection looked for this essential component of Japanese
gardens 20 years ago, they found none.
Following drastic cuts in sulphur dioxide levels in Tokyo air since the last
survey, the fuzzy green stuff is once again gracing trees throughout the
city. The density of sulphur dioxide, one of worst air pollutants, is less
than an eighth of its 1966 peak. 'In Tokyo we have virtually solved the
problem,' says Noburu Yoshino, chief of automobile pollution with the Tokyo
metropolitan government.
None the less, the levels of particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and ozone
remain unacceptably high. Walking on the pavement of a congested Tokyo
street is more pleasant than in London, for example, but no one ought to
breathe too deeply.
Tokyo's air pollution crisis was a product of the density of population and
industrial plant in the Tokyo area combined with the breakneck pace of
economic development during the 1960s. Japan was determined to put post-war
poverty behind, and industrial growth was pursued with little regard for
side effects, such as environmental degradation.
By the late 1960s, however, a public backlash had gathered strength at a
time when the ruling Liberal Democratic Party was losing electoral support.
A consensus developed that something had to be done.
The first target was sulphur emissions, caused primarily by industry. In
1970 the government announced a drastic reduction in the level of sulphur
permitted in fuel. The new limit was 0.5 per cent, compared with three to
four per cent in imported crude oil.
The government's next target was carbon monoxide, an important component of
automobile exhaust. The Japanese government required that all new cars sold
in Japan from 1975 be fitted with catalytic converters. The devices removed
95 per cent of carbon monoxide from exhaust.
Use of catalytic converters also led to the gradual introduction of
lead-free petrol, since lead fouls the catalyst. Nearly 100 per cent of
petrol sold in Japan is now unleaded. Although reducing atmospheric lead was
never a principal goal, this has been a welcome side effect.
Sulphur and carbon monoxide, however, were the easy steps. From here the
going will be considerably tougher.
Suspended particulate matter: The concentration of suspended particulate
matter (mainly dust and soot) in the air fell sharply in the late 1970s, but
has since remained high. The initial decline was a result in part of
switching from heavy fuel oil to gas oil and natural gas. In addition, the
government required electrostatic precipitators to be installed on
smokestacks where particulate matter is a problem.
Further progress will be difficult and expensive. Yoshino says that 30 per
cent of the problem is from nature, and cannot be controlled. Another 30 per
cent of particulate matter is generated by chemical reactions of other
pollutants, such as nitrogen and sulphuric acids. Some 20 to 30 per cent of
the total is caused by the carbon particles from diesel fuel.
NOx: The level of nitrogen oxides in Tokyo's air has remained stubbornly
high since the late 1960s. While the government has fixed a target of
reducing NOx by 50 per cent in 10 years, it has no concrete method of
achieving this. 'We are depending on a technological breakthrough,' says
Yoshino. This could be a new catalyst, which car companies the world over
are researching, use of methanol engines or electrically-powered cars.
Ozone: Photochemical oxidants, experienced as urban smog, are also an
enduring problem that is occasionally severe enough for the city government
to order some plants to cease operating.
Barring an unforeseen technical breakthrough, significant progress on
particulate matter, NOx and ozone is difficult to imagine without a
reduction in the activities, particularly automobile traffic, that cause
them. For Tokyo, however, this is especially hard to engineer. The city
already has superb public transportation, so there is little hope of coaxing
more commuters out of cars by offering a better alternative.
Road pricing schemes look especially hard to implement because traffic
congestion is spread over a huge area, rather than in the centre of the
city. Much of the diesel fuel is also consumed by delivery trucks, which are
the economic lifeline of the city.
Further progress is likely to come slowly, if at all. In the meantime, city
residents can console themselves that at least the moss does not seem to
mind.
Next week's article will focus on Athens.

<HEAD>This May be the Year for Acid-Rain Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress, spurred on by President Bush's
promise to do something this year about acid rain, is beginning what
could be the final confrontation in an eight-year, multi-million
dollar lobbying war over clean air.
   The opening volley was fired Thursday when more than 100 House
members, most allied with environmental groups, introduced
legislation to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by more than 40
percent and nitrogen oxide emissions by about half that amount. The
gases are the two major components of acid rain.
   The bill drew expected, strong support from environmental groups,
but was quickly opposed by the coal, auto and electric utilities
industries, which have fought environmentalists to an expensive draw
since the Reagan administration took office in 1981.
   ``This is the year for clean air,'' said Rep. Gerry Sikorski,
D-Minn., a sponsor of the legislation along with Reps. Henry Waxman,
D-Calif., and Silvio Conte, R-Mass. He cited the ``new attitude'' of
President Bush compared to that of former President Reagan, and
``increased public awareness and concern about our environment.''
   Environmental groups cite Bush's promise to solve the acid rain
problem, made during a trip to Canada last month, as one of two
political developments that signal the battle may be near an end.
The other is the levation to majority leader of Sen. George J.
Mitchell, D-Maine, who sponsored last year's clean-air legislation
in that chamber.
   ``For industry, I think they know the `no-bill' option is pretty
well off the table,'' said Alexandra Allen, attorney for the U.S.
Public Interest Research Group, a private environmental lobbying
organization.
   Ron Sykes, senior Washington represenative of General Motors
Corp., acknowledged, ``The pressures for doing something this year
are considerably more than they were last year.''
   But Sykes said ``we seem to be charging down a path that is
driven by what we've learned in the early years'' about acid rain,
and ``not what we're about to learn'' from a 10-year federal study
scheduled for completion in mid-1990.
   He suggested the nation wait for the study, a recommendation that
Reagan supported but Bush rejected in Canada.
   Gayla Hoffman, a spokeswoman for the nation's largest coal
producer, Peabody Holding Co. of St. Louis, said her company ``is
opposed to additional controls beyond those already in place in the
Clean Air Act.''
   And Diane Smiroldo, a spokeswoman for Edison Electric Institute,
representing the nation's electric utilities, said that ``the
current Clean Air Act is working'' and that ``any legislation at
this point is premature.''
   Acid rain and another aspect of the clean air debate _ dirty air
caused by ozone and carbon monoxide _ have been among the most
heavily lobbied issues in Congress.
   According to records on file in the House and Senate, Citizens
for Sensible Control of Acid Rain was the top lobbying spender in
1986. The organization, bankrolled principally by electric utilities
and coal companies, spent $3,028,235 on behalf of a grassroots
direct mail campaign opposing legislation mandating stricter acid
rain emissions. Acid rain legislation did not get near the floor
that year.
   But that figure did not include spending by individual
automakers, lectric utilities and chemical and coal companies and
their trade associations, according to Ms. Allen. She said
environmental lobbying groups spent only a fraction of industry
expenditures.
   The industry groups also have had strong allies in Congress: the
House Energy and Commerce chairman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., and
the former Senate majority leader, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
   The House bill would require that sulfur dioxide emissions be
reduced by 10 million tons and nitrogen oxide emissions by 4 million
tons by 1998. Currently, an estimated 22 million tons of sulfur
dioxide and 21 million tons of nitrogen oxide are being emitted into
the air.
   The two gases are converted in the atmosphere into acids, which
travel far from their starting points to pollute lakes and forests
and, according to some health experts, cause serious respiratory
problems for asthmatics, children and the elderly.
   The leading sources of sulfur dioxide are coal-burning electric
power plants and industrial facilities. Nitrogen oxides are emitted
in approximately equal amounts by motor vehicles and industry.
   Congress has been divided along regional lines. The Northeast,
the primary victim of acid rain, wants immediate action. Midwestern
states, with many older, coal-fired power plants, fear controls that
will boost electric bills.
   States that produce large amonts of high-sulfur coal _ Indiana,
Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania _ worry that controls
will cause massive job losses in the coal industry.
   The West, where low-sulfur coal is mined and acid rain is not a
serious problem, is reluctant to pay the cost for new controls.
   Under the new House bill:
   _Electric utilities would receive federal subsidies to protect
residential customers from rate hikes of more than 10 percent as a
result of the sulfur dioxide controls.
   _Motor vehicle manufacturers would be required to tighten
tailpipe standards for nitrogen oxide and hydrocarbons.
   _The EPA would be required to control hydrocarbon vapors by
requiring onboard vehicle canisters or controls at the gas pump.
Sykes said the canisters are unsafe, and could cause fires in
crashes, in hot weather, and if a leak develops in the emissions
system.

   Diesel Designers Try
   To Lighten Dark Clouds


</LP>
<TEXT>
   NEW technologies to cut diesel engines' emissions are
emerging in response to tougher air pollution rules. Detroit
Diesel has developed diesel engines that run on methanol and
emit fewer pollutants. The engine recently met this year's
tough California standards for diesel bus emissions, says a
spokeswoman for the company.
   Diesel designers aren't giving up on traditional fuel.
They are developing precision turbochargers and
fuel-injection systems to burn diesel fuel more cleanly. If
the systems work well enough, then catalytic converters can
be used to cut emissions further (the converters, now used
with gasoline engines, would otherwise be overwhelmed by
diesel soot). Donaldson Inc., Minneapolis, is working on
another idea: a "trap" that uses an electrical heater to
oxidize and break down particulate matter.
   But these technologies don't do much to cut another class
of diesel pollutants, nitrogen oxides, which contribute to
smog and acid rain. A potential solution from Sandia National
Laboratory uses a chemical that, when fed into an exhaust
system, reacts with nitrogen oxides and produces harmless
nitrogen and water.
   Another technology is in the works at PlasMachines, a
Natick, Mass., start-up. It uses an electronic device to
break down nitrogen oxides, dispensing with the need for
chemical additives, says Stanley Rich, president. He figures
that if mass-produced, the device would cost a few hundred
dollars, less than existing pollution-control systems for
cars.
   New diesel cars aren't currently sold in California
because their emissions of soot and nitrogen oxides exceed
the state's maximums. Several Northeastern states are
expected to adopt similar regulations soon, further crimping
sales of diesel cars. The federal and state rules also pose
problems for makers of diesel engines for buses, trucks and
industrial machines. Though reducing pollution, the rules
also cut use of fuel-efficient diesel vehicles.


   Environmental Start-Ups
   Gain New Green Sources


   THE environmental industry is getting a boost from new
capital conduits.
   Venture Capital Network, a Cambridge, Mass., nonprofit
group that matches investors with entrepreneurs, recently
created an environmental category in its computer database.
The new category was inspired both by investors' growing
interest in environmental start-ups and by the proliferation
of such companies, says Roger B. Wilson, the network's
executive director. For a $250 fee, investors participating
in the network can get a set of three-page business proposals
by environmental entrepreneurs, and from those in other
business areas if desired, each of whom also pays $250 to
participate.
   Another channel has been created by Ally Capital, a
Sausalito, Calif., company that lends money for
corporate-equipment leases. It recently announced plans to
raise $100 million from institutional investors to finance
such leases by environmental start-ups. Allen Gold, president
and chief executive officer, says Ally plans to finance the
leasing of everything from earthmovers to instruments for
toxic-waste testing. In recent months, Ally has made
financing commitments of $20 million to various environmental
companies, he adds.


   And Little Children Shall
   Find Uses for Discards


   RECYCLING markets may be down, but finding customers is
child's play for recycler Leonard Gottlieb.
   For 20 years Mr. Gottlieb has run a thriving business that
recycles industrial discards, mainly by selling them to
children. Housed at Boston's Children's Museum, his Recycle
shop blends well with the place's hands-on exhibits, such as
a "climbing wall" for the upwardly mobile set.
   The shop sells things by the bag-patrons can load up a
grocery-sized one for $5. Mr. Gottlieb says he "smokes out"
the stuff from Boston-area companies, which otherwise would
throw away the defective, outdated or otherwise unsellable
items. They include plastic planters, foam rubber pieces,
computer keyboard buttons, wood rectangles and a barrel full
of plastic E.T. figurines-leftovers of a faded fad. With a
little glue, the items can be turned into spaceships, funny
hats, sculptures, or mock clubs to beat the rival siblings.
   "They're a staple for any situation with kids," says Leigh
Faramarzpour, who teaches art to children and is loading up
20 bags of summer stock at the shop.
   The operation started making money for the museum within a
few years of its inception, Mr. Gottlieb says, and has been
copied in the U.S. and Europe. Though it doesn't cut the
trash stream much, it helps show that recycling can work --
to kids and parents, and also to the shop's corporate
contributors, he notes.


   Odds and Ends


   AMERICANS rank corporate environmental crimes as more
serious than insider trading, antitrust violations and worker
health and safety violations, according to a nationwide
survey by management consultant Arthur D. Little Inc. Some
74% of 1,000 people surveyed said executives should be held
personally liable for their companies' environmental
offenses. . . . Another recent survey, commissioned by
environmental consultant Pilko &amp; Associates, found that 89%
of 200 senior U.S. executives feel their companies are doing
a good or excellent job of managing environmental problems.
But 43% acknowledged that their companies had paid fines for
environmental crimes, and 40% said their companies had
recently rejected proposed acquisitions because of concerns
about environmental liabilities.

<DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan has agreed to freeze the nation's nitrogen oxide emissions at 1987 levels for at least seven years, assuring U.S. participation in an international pact to curb acid rain.

   A White House official said Mr. Reagan authorized the State Department to "continue negotiations aimed at ensuring U.S. participation in the protocol."
In so doing, he embraced a compromise worked out by negotiators in April and debated since within the administration.
The agreement on nitrogen oxide, one of the pollutants in acid rain, is scheduled to be signed by Canada, European nations and the Soviet Union in October.

   Some environmentalists regard the president's decision as a reversal of the administration's acid rain policy.
The administration had balked at signing a 1985 agreement on sulfur dioxide emissions that didn't give the U.S. credit for reductions in emissions of that pollutant.
However, under the April compromise, the nitrogen oxide agreement would take into account U.S. gains in controlling emissions from motor vehicles and electric power plants, according to administration officials.

   The nitrogen oxide freeze isn't expected to have any immediate effect on U.S. industry.
Nitrogen oxide emissions are decreasing but are projected to climb again in the mid-1990s because of population growth and industrial expansion.

FT  21 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: Only time will tell - Clean
coal technology can compete successfully with gas, but not in the immediate
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The run-down of British Coal is taking place against the background of a
huge effort elsewhere in the world to develop efficient 'clean coal' power
stations which could compete with natural gas on economic and environmental
criteria.
The problem in the UK is that the only coal-fired stations capable of
competing financially with natural gas plants at today's prices are old ones
whose capital costs have been written off. And they produce more pollution -
sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and carbon dioxide.
But the position may be quite different a decade or two from now, when gas
supplies are running short and new generations of clean coal plants are in
operation.
There is 'a ferment of innovation' in coal burning, says Walter Patterson,
an energy analyst specialising in coal technology. 'The world's engineering
companies and their enlightened clients are spending large sums in a hectic
race to expand the range of advanced coal technologies, improve their
efficiency and enhance their environmental performance. What is more, they
are succeeding.'
Some 38 clean coal plants are operating in the US, where government and
industry are jointly funding a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) clean coal
programme over five years. One demonstration is AES Shady Point, a 320MW
cogeneration (producing both electricity and heat) plant in Oklahoma which
has low emissions not only of sulphur and nitrogen oxides but even of carbon
dioxide.
In Europe and Asia, too, scores of advanced coal burning plants are being
planned and built. But in the UK, where much of the original research into
clean coal technology was carried out, the level of activity is now very low
compared with other countries. The clean coal power stations developed so
far fall into two broad categories:
Fluidised bed combustion (FBC) involves burning powdered coal in a bed of
pulverised limestone or dolomite (which acts as a chemical trap for any
sulphur emitted from the fuel). An upward flow of air keeps the bed in
constant motion like a boiling kettle. One turbine is driven by steam
produced in boiler tubes in the fluidised bed and a second by the hot
exhaust gases.
Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants have a gasifier in
which coal reacts with steam and air or oxygen to produce a raw fuel gas
containing carbon monoxide, hydrogen and methane. This gas is cleaned
chemically to remove pollutants before firing in a gas turbine to generate
electricity. The hot exhaust then produces steam to power another turbine.
FBC plants are particularly well suited for burning coal of low or variable
quality and for cogeneration. Their net efficiency is around 41 per cent - a
distinct improvement on the 38 per cent achieved by the best conventional
coal-fired power stations with desulphurisation 'scrubbers' but nowhere near
the 52 per cent of a new natural gas combined cycle plant.
IGCC plants offer better performance than FBC when good-quality coal is
available, though the technology is less well developed. Their net
efficiency is about 43 per cent and emissions of sulphur and nitrogen oxides
are comparable with a natural gas plant. The next important development will
be the opening, scheduled for 1993, of a 285MW IGCC demonstration plant in
the Netherlands designed by Shell.
Further improvements may be possible through combining the best features of
IGCC and FBC. One hybrid is British Coal's proposed topping cycle
technology. Stephen Dawes of the Coal Research Establishment predicts that a
commercial topping cycle plant would achieve 47 per cent efficiency using
current gas turbines and as high as 52 per cent if turbine technology
continues to advance as expected.
British Coal has formed a consortium with PowerGen, the electricity
generator, and GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French generating equipment
manufacturer, to develop the topping cycle. Chris Buck of GEC Alsthom says
the group is 'enthusiastic' about building a 75MW plant to demonstrate the
technology, which would have great export potential. But it cannot go ahead
until uncertainties about government support for the project and about the
future of British Coal are resolved.
Dawes accepts that no clean coal plant built in the UK today can generate
electricity as cheaply as a new natural gas plant, because the latter is
technically so much simpler that its capital costs and non-fuel operating
expenses are inevitably lower. Early in the next century, however, lower
fuel costs for coal could tip the balance against gas.
One environmental factor on which coal cannot match natural gas is its
impact on the greenhouse effect. It is chemically inevitable that burning
coal produces more CO than natural gas. Even here, however, there is hope in
the very long term.
The idea of large-scale removal of CO from power station flue gases was
regarded until a couple of years ago as too fantastic to contemplate because
of the high costs and the quantities of CO produced by fossil fuel burning.
Recent studies under the International Energy Agency's Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D
Programme suggest, however, that CO capture and disposal at sea may be
technically feasible, environmentally acceptable and economically bearable.
Clean coal technology will not save British Coal from contracting further
during the 1990s but it could lay the ground for a renaissance some time in
the next century.

The concentration of harmful ozone pollution in the lower atmosphere has more

When it is in the upper atmosphere, ozone shields Earth from the sun's

"Deputy Prime Minister Zaveryukha's Opinion: No Improvement"]
  [Text] Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandr Zaveryukha,
whose duties in the Russian Federation government Include
environmental protection oversight, noted that despite the
stoppage of many hazardous enterprises in industry, the
ecological situation in the country has not improved and still
leaves a lot to be desired.
  According to data of the Rosgidromet [Russian Federal
Service
on Hydrometeorology and Environmental Control] Main Geophysical
Observatory, the air basin over a considerable number of cities
(observations were made in 247 Russian cities) remains
unhealthy. In the 44 cities with the most polluted air basin
(the so-called priority list), it increased considerably between
1988 and 1992. Pollution by certain ingredients increased
somewhat in 15 cities. Only in 18 cities has it practically not
changed or declined slightly because of the drop in production.
For instance, in Irkutsk, Krasnodar, and Saratov the average
concentration of formaldehyde increased severalfold and exceeded
the MAC [maximum allowable concentration] by a factor of six to
seven. In Kemerovo the average concentration of carbon bisulfide
reached six MAC (a sixfold increase); in Krasnodar the
concentration of phenol in the air increased from two to three
MAC. The nitrogen oxide, dust, and phenol concentration
increased in Lipetsk (to 1.5-2.9 MAC); nitrogen dioxide and
ammonia concentration in Saratov--to 2.0-2.9 MAC; and in
Cherepovets the concentration of carbon bisulfide increased from
3.2 to five MAC in Bratsk and from 2.4 to 3.8 MAC. The degree of
air pollution in the capital remains very high; the
concentration of phenol did decrease, but at the same time there
was an increase in the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (mainly
because of increased automotive traffic).
  The hygienic state of air basins over the cities on the
priority list has changed to a different extent over the past
five years. For instance, the concentration of ammonia,
formaldehyde, and nitrogen oxides increased in St. Petersburg;
of carbon oxide, formaldehyde, and carbon bisulfide--in Barnaul;
of carbon oxide, formaldehyde, and carbon bisulfide--in
Orenburg; of phenol and nitrogen oxides--in Ryazan; and of
phenol, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides--in Kazan. The air quality
has not changed perceptibly in Perm, Kaliningrad, Groznyy.
Samara, Ivanovo, and Vyatka.
  Water reservoirs. Observations of dry land surface water
pollution are conducted at 1,341 reservoirs in 2,624 ranges. At
851 of these ranges (32 percent) the average annual
concentration of at least one pollutant exceeds the MAC by a
factor of 10 or more. This ratio has not changed perceptibly
over the past few years.
  According to official data, in 1992 as compared to the
preceding year in water reservoirs with a high degree of
pollution the quality of water improved at 35 ranges,
deteriorated at 99 ranges, and remained basically unchanged at
717 ranges.
  Overall, the level of pollution of water reservoirs on the
territory of Russia remains high.
  There has been a serious deterioration in the water quality
in the largest Siberian rivers--the Ob, Irtysh, Vakh, Taz, and
their numerous tributaries, where the concentration of petroleum
products increased from five-10 MAC in the early 1980's to 10-60
MAC in the early 1990's, and of phenols--from three-eight to
10-45 MAC, respectively. This is a result of the low efficiency
of environmental protection measures of oil- and gas-producing
enterprises and river transport.
  The level of pollution of Volga water reservoirs remains
high--the content of many pollutants in them, including
petroleum products, phenol, copper, and nitrogen nitrite
measures five-15 MAC. The eutrophication process there continues
to progress at a faster rate.
  There has been a substantial deterioration in the condition
of rivers in Tula Oblast, where in the upper reaches of the Don,
Shatskiy reservoir, and Ula river the concentration of phenol
and nitrogen compounds increased from two-eight to 20-35 MAC--a
result of operations of Novomoskovsk industrial complex chemical
enterprises; the situation also deteriorated in Stavropol Kray
rivers. Here, because of the unsatisfactory work of city
purification systems the concentration of petroleum products
increased from four-five to 20-50 MAC; of suspended
particles--from 150 to 950 mg per liter, and of organic
substances--from 50 to 100-300 mgO2 per liter.
  Over the past four years the Moscow river has unfailingly
made it to the priority list of the most polluted water
reservoirs in the country; the average annual content of phenol
and nitrogen compounds in it measures 10-15 MAC, with a trend
toward an increasing level of pollution.
  Monitoring data on dry land surface waters for 1992 showed
practically no change in the trends of pollution levels at water
reservoirs in Russia: the Kola Peninsula rivers, the Oka and Ob
basins, and rivers in the Urals industrial region remain the
most polluted water reservoirs.
  The results of the 1993 monitoring are currently being
processed; the work will be finished in February.

FT  27 OCT 92 / BP Chemicals trims emissions at main plants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLDWIDE emissions from British Petroleum Chemicals' 10 largest plants fell
8 per cent from 171,000 tonnes to 158,000 tonnes last year.
The improvement consisted of a better environmental performance of 9,000
tonnes - equivalent to 5 per cent - and a reduction of 4,000 tonnes from
improved data collection and measurement.
The plants represented 80 per cent of BP Chemicals' production and 95 per
cent of its emissions. Figures for BP Oil and BP Explorations were not
given; nor were they given for individual sites.
The result was in spite of an rise in sulphur oxide and nitrogen oxide
emissions to the air. Sulphur oxide emissions increased 11 per cent to
25,000 tonnes while nitrogen oxide rose 4 per cent to 12,137 tonnes.
Mr Mike LaGraff, manager for health, safety and the environment, said those
increases were because of higher production levels at a power plant located
in Baglan Bay, Wales.
Hydrocarbon emissions fell 16 per cent to 27,000 tonnes, which put the
company on target to reach its aim of halving them by 1997, Mr LaGraff said.
Water emissions remained static at 23,000 tonnes, although the group stayed
on target to cut those by two thirds by 1997. He said water treatment plants
would take time to build. Offsite disposal also fell 5.5 per cent.
The company said carbon dioxide emissions had fallen slightly, but it gave
no details.
Mr LaGraff said the figures would be published next year, together with data
on environmental running costs and expenditure on research and development.
Information on BP Chemicals' failure to comply with regulations would also
be provided.
The group is spending Pounds 100m a year on capital projects for
environmental protection over the next five years, although Mr LaGraff said
that towards 1997 expenditure might slow.

   Acid rain could be almost as big a contributor
as fertilizer runoff or sewage and industrial water pollution to
the decline of marine life in East Coast estuaries, an
environmental group concluded today.
   A study by the Environmental Defense Fund said nitrate compounds
from the atmosphere _ originating mostly as nitric acid _
contribute 25 percent of the total nitrogen input to Cheasapeake
Bay, compared with 34 percent from fertilizers and 23 percent from
municipal sewage and industrial discharges.
   Nitrates act as fertilizers, encouraging ``blooms'' of algae
that use up oxygen dissolved in the water and making it difficult
for other plants and fish to live.
   These airborne compounds also are contributing to problems in
Delaware Bay, Albemarle-Pamlico Sound in North Carolina, Long
Island Sound between New York and Connecticut and the New York
Bight in the Atlantic Ocean off New York and New Jersey, the
group's scientists said.
   ``The problem of enhanced primary productivity from atmospheric
nitrogen inputs appears to be widespread along the Atlantic
Seaboard,'' the fund's report said.
   Release of the report kicked off three days of rallies, press
conferences and other events by environmental groups timed to
coincide with this week's visit to Washington by Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney.
   Canada, supported by U.S. environmentalists, for years has been
unsuccessfully pressing the United States to act against the
pollution precursors that form acid rain and flow northward across
the border before falling on Canada.
   The most-often-mentioned precursor is sulfur dioxide, which
turns into sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. Sulfur dioxide is
mostly emitted by coal-burning power plants, but an estimated
one-third of the rainfall acidity in the eastern United States
actually comes from oxides of nitrogen, which become nitric acid in
the atmosphere.
   Nationwide, about one-third of nitrigen oxides originate in
power plant emissions, one-third in motor vehicle exhaust and
one-seventh in industrial emnissions.
   Today's report was the first to estimate the input to Chesapeake
Bay of nitrates originating in the atmosphere not only as direct
rain and other deposition on the bay itself _ an estimated 9,150
tons per year _ but also in runoff from the land of the bay's
watershed _ 29,400 tons per year. The fund estimated that 154,000
tons of nitrogen compounds from all sources wind up in the bay.
   The total of 154,000 tons was in the range of estimates given by
the joint federal-state Chesapeake Bay pollution control program,
92,000 tons to 198,000 tons.
   The fund called on the joint program to adopt measures aimed at
reducing atmospheric deposition of nitrogen compounds to the bay
and its watershed by 40 percent. The program already has adopted a
goal of reducing nitrogen and phosphorous discharges to the bay by
40 percent.
   At the Environmental Protection Agency, spokesman Chris Rice
said no agency expert had had a chance to study the fund's report
and the EPA therefore was not in a position to comment.

<HEAD>Acid Rain Threatens Northeast Coastal Waters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have concluded that acid rain is one
of the main pollutants threatening marine life in Atlantic coastal
waters, The New York Times reported Monday.
   Up to now, most experts have assumed that agricultural runoff
and sewage were the major culprits responsible for the increasing
number of mass killings of marine life along the Northeast coast,
the newspaper said.
   But a new report prepared by scientists of the Environmental
Defense Fund, a nonprofit environmental group, shows for the first
time that acid rain is also contributing to the problem, according
to the newspaper.
   Acid rain comes from nitrogen oxides in emissions from
automobiles, power plants and other industries. The oxides are
converted into nitric acids and nitrates in the atmosphere.
   Nitrate salts and other nutrients encourage the growth of algae,
which in turn use up oxygen needed by other plants and animals
living in the coastal waters, according to the report.
   ``It is choking off the ocean's nurseries,'' said Dr. Michael
Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist for the environmental group
and a co-author of the report. ``It is shutting down the playground
for millions of Americans.'
   ``It is a regionwide problem, and it is only going to get worse
because of the projected growth of nitrogen emissions,'' he added.
   The study focuses on Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries and
found that atmospheric sources account for 25 percent of the
nitrogen pouring into the bay each year.
   Fertilizers account for 34 percent, sewage and other industrial
discharges 23 percent, and animal wastes, including runoff from
land and evaporated ammonium from manure that travels through the
atmosphere, 18 percent.
   If current trends continue, atmospheric nitrates will constitute
42 percent of annual nitrogen deposits into the bay by the year
2030, according to the report.
   The conclusion of the report was endorsed by other scientists
who have read drafts of it, including Joel S. O'Connor, an
ecologist with the Waste Management Institute of the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, according to the Times.
   George Hidy, director of the environment division of the
Electric Power Institute _ a research association of utility
companies that emit large amounts of sulfur and nitrogen from their
plants _ called the report's findings ``an interesting and
surprising hypothesis that needs to be verified.''

Long Beach needs to change the operation rules for its trash incineration plant
or face continued violations for nitrogen oxide emissions, a major component of
smog, a city official said.
</P>
<P>
The city has asked the South Coast Air Quality Management District to change
its rules so that nitrogen oxide emissions from the Southeast Resource Recovery
Facility will be averaged over an hour instead of every 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
That way, the city could avoid being cited or fined for occasional short
durations of nitrogen oxide emissions because plant operators would have a
longer period to return the plant to normal operations, city Solid Waste
Manager Bill Davis said.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, Davis told the City Council, the plant is expected to exceed its
maximum allowable output of nitrogen oxide about once every 10 days. The
builder of the plant, Dravo Corp., could be held financially liable if the
plant fails to meet pollution standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech plant on Terminal Island burns trash to produce electricity.
Council members hailed the $100-million plant as helping protect the city from
a landfill crisis that is expected to affect all cities in Southern California
over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Davis said the bursts of nitrogen oxide are produced by surges of temperature
in the plant's furnace. Also, the plant's nitrogen oxide emissions rise when it
burns nitrogen-rich grass clippings or tree trimmings.

  [Text] The Air-Conditioning Research Institute of
Matsushita Seiko Co., Ltd. (Matsushita Seiko), has successfully
developed a chelating resin-based NO[.sub]x[/] remover that
was found to be highly effective in eliminating NO[.sub]2[/]
(nitrogen dioxide), the most harmful among NO[.sub]x[/]
(nitrogen oxides).
  Matsushita Seiko plans, for the time being, to apply this
NO[.sub]x[/]-removal agent to filters that will be
incorporated in its own commercial products, including air
cleaners, air-supply-type ventilators and heat-exchanger-type
ventilators, to upgrade the functions of these products.
  The developed NO[.sub]x[/] remover is based on the matrix
of a copolymer of styrene and divinyl-benzene, which is a
porous, polymeric, chelating resin. This matrix is derivatized
with a special functional group that undergoes a chemical
reaction with adsorbed NO[.sub]2[/] for removal. The agent is
capable of effectively removing NO[.sub]2[/] at an ultra-low
concentration (approximately 0.01 ppm) in air, and the
effectiveness lasts approximately 30 times longer than activated
charcoal on a unit weight basis. The resin is made in 0.8- to
1.2mm-sized spheres, so it can easily be attached to a piece of
urethane to produce a filter that yields little pressure loss,
and it is easy to handle. The resin is also capable of removing
other harmful gas components (including SO[.sub]x[/], i.e.,
sulfur oxides, and acetaldehyde).
  In recent years, the atmospheric pollution by nitrogen
oxides
generated by automobiles has become a serious issue. Among
nitrogen oxides, NO[.sub]2[/] is considered to be one of
several causes for pediatric asthma and allergies, and the
atmospheric concentration of NO[.sub]2[/] is known to exceed
the environmental standard in some cases. Such outdoor air is
causing the worsening of indoor air quality.

   The Bush administration says nine states, with
some of the nation's dirtiest coal-burning power plants, do not
deserve financial help from other parts of the country to cut acid
rain emissions.
   William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, said Tuesday he opposed changing the administration's clean
air bill to provide special help to the the nine states.
   He produced figures strongly contradicting the states' assertion
that they would pay a disproportionate share of costs to reduce acid
rain.
   Reilly testified before the House Energy and Commerce energy and
power subcommittee on the acid rain section of the Bush legislation.
Today, the Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee is meeting
to amend the bill, a process that could take three weeks. The
legislation would then go to the full Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Reilly said the acid rain section is ``fair to those who cleaned
upin the past. It doesn't make them pay to clean up again,'' he
said, referring to electric customers from outside the nine states,
whose utility bills already include the cost of pollution-cutting
moves by utilities in their own areas.
   The administrator sparred often Tuesday with Rep. Philip R.
Sharp, D-Ind., chairman of the energy and power panel, who insisted
electric customers in the nine states ``are being asked to do more
than our fair share.''
   The states are Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Georgia, Ohio,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri.
   Sharp has demanded that electric ratepayers in those states
receive financial help in paying for power plant reductions of
sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, emissions that form the compound
known as acid rain. The nine states have plants that burn high
sulfur coal.
   So-called cost sharing could be accomplished by forcing
non-utility industries to reduce their emissions, or by having
electric ratepayers elsewhere pick up part of the tab through their
bills.
   ``The environment will not know'' where reductions come from,
``but our ratepayers will know,'' Sharp said, contending that some
utility rates could rise by 20 percent in the nine states. But
Reilly said the five hardest-hit states would only see ratepayers
bills increase _ on the average _ a third of a cent per
killowatt-hour by the year 2001.
   Sharp began his hearing Tuesday by citing new figures that
contended the nine states would be asked to clean up about 77
percent of the acid rain emissions, even though they cause only 50
percent of the problem.
   He contended in the initial phase of the program, ratepayers in
the nine states would ``pay for fully 90 percent of the cleanup.''
   But Reilly then presented his own statistics, which said that the
nine states produced 51 percent of the acid rain emissions but their
actual cleanup costs would only be 50 percent of the total.
   ``That's as fair as we can possibly make it,'' he said.
   Bush's legislation seeks to reduce pollution from toxic airborne
chemicals, acid rain and ozone. Acid rain consists of sulfur dioxide
and nitrogen oxide, substances that unite in the air and travel
hundreds of miles before falling to earth.
   Acid rain destroys lakes, kills trees, makes buildings
deteriorate and causes lung problems.
   The president proposed reducing sulfur dioxide by 10 million tons
by the year 2000 based on 1980 levels _ nine million coming from
power plants and one million from industrial emissions already
achieved. There would be an emissions ``cap'' to prevent future
releases from offsetting the reductions.
   Nitrogen oxides from utilities would be cut two million tons from
the projected level in the year 2000. But since these oxides could
increase by three million tons during this period, there could
actually be an increase of one million tons.
   Utilities could decide how to reduce their pollution, with
possibilities including switching to cleaner burning fuels,
employing existing anti-pollution equipment like scrubbers, trying
new methods such as developing technology for cleaner burning of
high-sulfur coal, and conservation.

   This just in: The climate of the Earth changed
dramatically 20 million years ago when high plateaus rose up in
Tibet and western North America.
   With new threats to the climate looming, upwards of 3,000
scientists have gathered here this week for the American
Geophysical Union's semiannual exchange of ideas on weather and
climate, volcanoes, earthquakes, water, the solar system and even
politics.
   Several hundred listeners assembled Wednesday to hear Rep.
Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., discuss the need for leadership to
combat the threats of global warming, acid rain and wasteful energy
policies.
   ``You don't have to be an alarmist to recognize that if the
Earth's average temperature rises as much as five degrees ... it
will completely change our way of life,'' observed Gephardt.
   In another hall, William Ruddiman of Columbia University's
Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory explained his calculation
showing that the rise of the mountains in Tibet and western North
America forced the winds to shift direction around them, causing
climate changes that led to the ice ages.
   Scientists have long speculated about the reasons for the ice
ages. Ruddiman, a marine geologist, and John E. Kutzbach, a
climatologist from the University of Wisconsin, say computerized
models of the Earth's climate are convincing them that the rising
mountains and high plateaus were the major factor in cooling off
North America and the northern parts of Europe and Asia.
   In addition, they said, those shifts in the wind helped change
the flow of ocean currents and led to conditions that promote the
summer monsoons in Asia, dry summers in California and the
Mediterranean and increase the cold winter winds in parts of the
western United States.
   A pair of National Aeronautics and Space Administration
scientists, meanwhile, reported their conclusion that the barrage
of charged particles from the sun may be contributing to the damage
to the Earth's protective ozone layer.
   Linwood Callis reported that the flow of high-energy particles
from the sun leads to the formation of oxides of nitrogen in the
upper parts of the stratosphere.
   In turn, those nitrogen compounds can settle into the
stratosphere where ``if you have any kind of significant buildup,
then what you have is the possibility of catalytic destruction of
ozone,'' said Callis.
   Ozone helps protect the earth from potentially damaging
ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Losing some of the ozone could
lead to an increased incidence of skin cancer.
   ``What the model calculations show and that the data confirm is
that from 1979 to 1985 the (nitrogen oxide) levels in the polar
lower stratosphere probably increased between 30 and 80 or 90
percent. In the equatorial region there have been increases, much
smaller, on the order of 10 or 15 percent,'' Callis said.
   Damage to the ozone over the South Pole has been widely
discussed in recent years. Callis said that so-called Antarctic
``ozone hole'' appears to be largely a result of chlorine compounds
trapped over the polar areas, since ice particles in this region
tend to remove many nitrogen compounds from the air.
   ``The interest that we have in this is primarily related to
global ozone ... there are larger than expected ozone changes,''
said Callis.
   In the air about 16 miles above the surface, the area where
ozone is most concentrated, Callis and Dan Baker found the gas
depleted by as much as 14 percent between 1979 and 1985, Callis
said.
   Natural changes in the solar cycle should reduce the amount of
incoming charged particles between now and the mid-1990s, said
Callis, and he and Baker are anxious to see if ozone levels will
recover during that period.
   While modern and ancient climate changes were under discussion,
the massive convention center swarmed with students in jeans,
geologists in string ties, nervous speakers rehearsing their
presentations and political advocates proclaiming the Greenhouse
warming a hoax.
   A steady drizzle dampened arrivals, while an appropriately
placed booth emblazoned ``Hydrology'' greeting them just inside the
main entrance.

   Twelve countries Monday signed a
declaration to reduce emissions of air pollutants that contribute
to acid rain and the depletion of the ozone layer.
   The countries that promised to reduce by 30 percent their
emissions of nitrogen oxide in the next 10 years are Finland,
Norway, Belgium, Italy, France, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, West
Germany, Liechtenstein, Denmark and the Netherlands.
   Nitrogen oxide, derived mostly from car exhaust fumes and the
burning of fossil fuels, contributes to smog, acid rain and the
``greenhouse effect,'' or the warming of the atmosphere around
Earth.
   The 12 members of the United Nations Economic Commission for
Europe were in Sofia for a meeting of the Convention on Long-range
Transboundary Air Pollution that begins Tuesday.
