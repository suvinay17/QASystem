   The U.S. population stood at 249,632,692 as of
the 1990 census, the government said Wednesday in a numerical
portrait of a nation growing far more rapidly in the Sun Belt than
in the industrial north and agricultural heartland.
   California, the nation's largest state, added more than 6
million people in the decade, a 26.1 percent increase to 29,839,250
people.
   Wyoming remained the smallest state, with 455,975 people, down
2.9 percent from 1980.
   Nevada was the biggest population gainer in percentage terms,
and Florida and Arizona each grew by more than one-third as
millions of Americans flocked to the sunshine.
   West Virginia was the largest loser in percentage terms.
   In all, the population increased by 10.2 percent from the
226,504,825 people counted in the 1980 census, below the 11.4
percent population growth recorded from 1970 to 1980, and the 13.4
percent rate from 1960 to 1970.
   The information was contained in the Census Bureau's first
release of ``final figures'' - really tentative final figures -
from the 1990 count. The information will be used for everything
from readjusting the size of each state's congressional delegation
to parcelling out federal aid.
   In political terms, the population shifts will give California
seven new House seats, and add lawmakers to seven other states.
Thirteen states will lose representation.
   Because of the importance of the population estimates, some
states and cities are likely to challenge the tallies, and a final
count isn't expected until next summer.
   The cost of the 1990 census, from planning begun in 1984 to a
final release of data in 1993, is estimated at $2.6 billion by the
bureau.
   Still locked in Census Bureau computers - to be doled out over
the next several years - is a wealth of information about age,
race, living conditions and other details of America near the turn
of the century.
   Besides Wyoming, four other states lost population. The biggest
percentage loser was West Virginia, whose population dropped by 7.6
percent to 1,801,625. Other states losing population were Iowa,
down 4.3 percent, and and North Dakota, down 1.7 percent. The
District of Columbia also lost population, 4.5 percent.
   The sharpest gainer in percentage terms was Nevada. That state's
population grew by 50.7 percent to 1,206,152. Besides California,
other states with gains of more than 25 percent were Florida, up
33.4 percent; Arizona, up 35.3 percent; and Alaska, up 37.4
percent.
   The Pacific states were the fastest growing region, 23.4
percent, followed by the Mountain states, 20.6 percent, and the
South Atlantic states, 18.8 percent. By contrast, the East North
Central states grew a bare 1.1 percent, and the West North Central
states, 3.1 percent.
   Some regions went against the broader trend. New England, which
had a boom in high-tech industry during the 1980s, grew by 7.2
percent. The East South Central states grew only 3.9 percent.
   Because of the high financial and political stakes, the census
numbers and the way they were obtained are certain to draw
continued sharp scrutiny.
   More than 6,000 local governments challenged the accuracy of a
preliminary count based mainly on the April 1 census taken by mail.
The Census Bureau responded with a series of recounts and an ad
campaign urging people who thought they had been missed to come
forward.
   The final national population total was nearly 4 million people
more than the preliminary number released by the bureau earlier
this year.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher has until July 1991, to
decide whether to adjust the census numbers to account for a
statistically determined undercount of minorities. An adjustment
would increase political representation of areas with a high
percentage of minorities, and lower that of other areas.
   California will gain seven seats, giving it 52 in the 435-member
House. Florida will gain four; Texas, three; and Arizona, Georgia,
North Carolina, Virginia and Washington, one seat each.
   New York will lose three seats; Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and
Pennsylvania, two seats each; and Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and West Virginia,
one seat each.
   The 1990 census for the first time counted some Americans living
abroad. The total included 922,819 members of the armed forces,
civilian employees of the federal government and their dependents.
   The comparable numbers from 10 years earlier counted only people
living within the United States.
   The Census Bureau on Wednesday released two sets of 1980
numbers. The 226,504,825 figure used by the bureau for comparison
with the 1990 national total was released in December 1980 but was
later adjusted slightly to get rid of minor problems. The adjusted
figure was 226,545,805.
   The 1990 population count was nearly 64 times the 3,929,214
counted in 1790, the first census in the nation's history. By 1900,
the population had reached 76,212,168.
   In 1950, the first census after World War II, the population was
151,325,798.
   In January, the Census Bureau will begin sending information on
small areas, in some cases the size of a city block, to state
legislatures so they can begin drawing new congressional and
legislative boundaries.
   That process will be completed by April 1.
   The bureau will put off releasing detailed demographic data
until after the decision on adjusting the figures.

   Population pressures threaten to disrupt
political and social conditions in many nations, according to a new
study that finds Japan the world's most stable nation and Mauritania
the most unstable.
   The report from the private Population Crisis Committee, released
Sunday, put the United States in the ``moderate'' category, losing
ground to 16 countries rated as more stable because of this nation's
ethnic conflicts and high rate of youth unemployment.
   The analysis by Sharon L. Camp, Marshall Green and Patricia G.
Barnett noted that ``rapid population growth, especially when
overlaid with sharp ethnic divisions, places enormous strains on
political institutions.''
   ``Not surprisingly the two most deeply troubled areas of the
globe are Africa and the Middle East, with the world's highest
growth rates,'' commented Green, a retired ambassador.
   The analysis was compiled by rating a variety of factors and
totaling the results.
   Population growth rates, movement to urban areas, the age
structure of populations, growth of the labor force and presence or
absence of ethnic and language division in a country were the major
population factors considered.
   The study took into account changes in government over the last
30 years or so, political freedoms, civil liberties, ethnic or
religious conflicts and an estimate of the satisfaction or
frustration of youth in a country.
   Mauritania, situated astride the Sahara desert and the dry Sahel
steppe region in West Africa, led the list for instability with a 95
score out of a possible 100. It also ranked high in separate
population pressure rankings, scoring 71 out of 100.
   Rounding out the five most unstable nations were Ethiopia,
scoring 87; Zaire, 83; and Burundi and the Sudan, 81 each.
   All five have been through several governments and all but Zaire
scored the maximum in communal violence, with bitter conflicts
underway in several of these countries. All five also ranked high in
the study of population pressures.
   On the 100-point instability scale, Japan accumulated only 13
points and was also near the bottom of the population pressures
study.
   The United States, by comparison, accumulated 31 points in the
instability analysis.
   Both nations managed a top ranking of 1 point for government
changes, political and civil rights.
   In the category of ethnic and religious conflicts, however, while
Japan had one point the United States was given 10 of a possible 20.
   And, in the dissatisfied youth category, unemployment hurt the
U.S., which scored 18 out of 40 possible points, compared with 9
points for Japan.
   Countries falling between Japan and the United States were
Norway, 18; Switzerland, 20; Italy, Denmark and Australia, 21 each;
Sweden and Belgium, 22 each; West Germany, 23; Venezuela, 24; Costa
Rica, 25; Jamaica, 28; Netherlands, 29; and Greece, Canada and
Botswana, 30 each.
   Tied with the United States at a rating of 31 were Spain and
France.
   The committee, which advocates family planning, said, ``It is
clear from trends widely evident in the world that rapid growth of a
country's population, along with its maldistribution, will impose
great strains on existing political, social and economic structures
and on relations between nations.''
   Of 120 countries studied, 101 showed a relationship between
population pressures and political stability, the group concluded.
It said only a handful of governments with rapid population growth
have maintained stable governments with good records on civil and
political rights, notably Botswana, Jamaica, Costa Rica, Gambia and
Venezuela.
   China, where student attempts to promote democracy recently ended
in military violence, scored a 57 rating on the index, placing it in
the ``high'' category for instability.
   That score may be too low in light of recent events, the
committee said in an addendum issued with the report.

   Rapidly growing populations threaten social
turbulence, endangering the political stability of many nations,
according to a new analysis by a private group.
   West Africa's Mauritania was rated the most potentially unstable
nation in the world in the analysis released Sunday by the
Population Crisis Committee, which advocates birth control.
   Japan finished at the other end of the scale, the most stable
nation.
   And the United States fell in the ``moderate'' category, losing
ground to 16 countries rated as more stable because of this
country's ethnic conflicts and high rate of youth unemployment.
   ``Rapid population growth, especially when overlaid with sharp
ethnic divisions, places enormous strains on political
institutions,'' observed the study, compiled by Sharon L. Camp,
Marshall Green and Patricia G. Barnett.
   Many nations seem to be striving to develop democracy. ``Whether
these fragile new democracies survive or not will depend partly on
the intensity of population pressures and the strains they add to
the problems of governance,'' said Camp.
   Green, a retired ambassador, observed that ``not surprisingly the
two most deeply troubled areas of the globe are Africa and the
Middle East, with the world's highest growth rates.''
   The new analysis, published in the form of a wall chart
containing a world map of population pressures and growth rates, was
compiled by establishing statistical ratings of a variety of factors
and totaling the results.
   Population growth rates, movement to urban areas, the age

   The United States has more than 20 million
Hispanic residents, the Census Bureau reports, meaning only five
other countries have larger Latin American populations.
   ``This is our first estimate of over 20 million,'' Jorge Del
Pinal, chief of the Ethnic and Hispanic Statistics Branch at the
bureau, said Wednesday. ``It's up from about 14.5 million in 1980.''
   Brazil has the largest Latin American population at more than
147 million people.
   The only other countries in this hemisphere with more Hispanics
than the United States are: Mexico with 86.7 million; Argentina,
31.9 million; Colombia, 31.2 million and Peru, 21.4 million.
   The new Census analysis showed that as of last March Hispanics
constituted 8.2 percent of the U.S. population and are the fastest
growing large population group.
   The bureau said immigration accounted for about half the growth.
   About two-thirds of the Hispanics in the United States live in
just three states. California leads with 34 percent, followed by
Texas at 21 percent and New York with 10 percent.
   Florida has 8 percent of the nation's Hispanics, and there are
significant populations in Illinois, New Jersey, Arizona, New
Mexico and Colorado, the bureau reported.
   Estimates are not prepared for every state because ``Hispanics
are not well spread out throughout the United States,'' Del Pinal
said.
   The Census report estimated the total Hispanic population of the
United States at 20,076,000 as of March, up from 19,431,000 a year
earlier.
   The largest segment is Mexicans at 12,567,000, followed by
people of Central and South American origin, 2,545,000, Puerto
Ricans, 2,328,000, and Cubans, 1,068,000. The balance were of
Spanish or other Hispanic origin.
   Mexicans were mostly concentrated in Texas and California, the
report said. Cubans are mostly in Florida, while Puerto Ricans tend
to live in New York, and Central and South Americans are largely in
California and New York.
   While Mexicans were the largest group they are not the fastest
growing, the report said.
   Comparing the estimates for 1982 and 1989, the bureau said
Central and South Americans had increased by 67 percent. The
``other Hispanic'' category rose 31 percent, followed by Mexicans,
up 30 percent, Puerto Ricans, 14 percent and Cubans, 12 percent.

   There are more than 20 million people of
Hispanic origin in the United States, a nine-year increase of 5{
million, the Census Bureau reported Wednesday.

   A majority of Americans favor financial
assistance for family planning programs in rapidly growing nations,
according to a new poll done for a pair of population groups.
   Sixty percent of adults polled by Louis Harris and Associates
said the United States should fund foreign family planning
programs, regardless of whether abortion is legal in those nations.
   But more than one-third of Americans, 34 percent, disagreed,
according to the poll prepared for the Population Crisis Committee
and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America.
   Providing financial support for family planning has been a bone
of contention in recent years, with the Agency for International
Development withdrawing support from countries where abortion is a
part of the programs.
   The agency halted funding to both the International Planned
Parenthood Federation and the United Nation's Population Fund,
contending that their policies promoted coercive abortion.
   The two independent population groups paid for the poll of 1,250
Americans in order to gauge the support for family planning in this
presidential election year. A poll of that size has a margin of
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   The study concluded that Americans are aware that the world's
population _ which last year topped the 5 billion mark _ is growing
rapidly and that this poses many problems.
   Some 91 percent of those polled think food shortages and famines
will get worse if populations in poor countries continue their
rapid increases, the study found.
   Continued population growth will lead to more illegal
immigration to the United States, according to 89 percent of the
respondents, while 87 percent predicted that there will be more
international crises and that more agricultural land will turn to
desert and 69 percent foresee more U.S. jobs moving overseas.
   Asked if the poor countries of Latin America, Africa and Asia
should have strong birth control programs, 89 percent agreed.
Fifty-nine percent said such programs are in the United States'
interest, and 60 percent approved U.S. money for the programs.

STATE'S LATINO POPULATION IS UP 2 MILLION, U.S. ESTIMATES

California's Latino population, which represents one-third of the Latinos
nationally, has increased by nearly 2 million since 1980, according to a Census
Bureau estimate released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that the nation's total Latino population has grown by 39%
since 1980, rising to a record 20.1 million. Latinos now make up 8.2% of the
U.S. population and have a population growth rate that is five times that of
non-Latinos, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Census Bureau spokesman Carmen Denavas said that half of the 6.7 million
California residents of Latino origin are immigrants. Immigration accounted for
about 50% of the national increase in the Latino population.
</P>
<P>
"This is our first estimate of over 20 million," said bureau spokesman Jorge
Del Pinal. "It's up from about 14.5 million in 1980."
</P>
<P>
The figures in the report are estimates and include illegal immigrants. There
are no precise figures for the numbers of illegal immigrants in the state or
the country, and estimates of the number vary widely.
</P>
<P>
California retains its rank as the state with by far the largest Latino
population, followed by Texas, which is home to 21% of the nation's Latinos.
Next are New York with 10% and Florida with 8%. The report also identified
Illinois, New Jersey, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado as having significant
Latino populations.
</P>
<P>
Estimates are not prepared for every state because "Hispanics are not well
spread out throughout the United States," Del Pinal said.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles on Wednesday, Mayor Tom Bradley joined with Latino leaders and
celebrities to kick off a city campaign designed to encourage Latino youths to
stand and be counted in the 1990 census.
</P>
<P>
"Tell your friends, tell your family that Hispanics must be counted to earn
political power," came a message shouted not from the mouth of a politician,
but by Latin American rock star Jose Luis Rodriguez, who attended the event at
Roosevelt High School.
</P>
<P>
And, based on the high-pitched screams of approval from hundreds of teen-agers,
the words were well received.
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles, bolstered with $600,000 in funding, has joined forces
with a host of community and civic groups to find ways to reach traditionally
undercounted groups, including Latinos, the homeless and those who live in
overcrowded apartments.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they have targeted high school-age Latino youths because the
students can pass along census information to their parents and push them to
fill out forms for the April 1 head count.
</P>
<P>
As part of the campaign, schools in areas with large immigrant populations will
be sent census lessons for classroom instruction throughout the campaign, which
lasts until April 1.
</P>
<P>
The official 1980 count missed as many as 10% of U.S. Latinos, according to
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau report said that the largest segment of the Latino population
is of Mexican descent, about 12.6 million. Residents of Central and South
American origin total 2.5 million, while those of Puerto Rican descent total
2.3 million and those of Cuban descent account for 1.1 million. The remainder
are of Spanish or other Latino origin.
</P>
<P>
While people of Mexican descent are the largest Latino group in the United
States, they are not the fastest-growing segment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Comparing estimates from 1982 and 1989, the bureau said that the number of
Central and South Americans had increased by 67%. The "other Hispanic" category
rose 31%, followed by Mexicans, up 30%, Puerto Ricans, 14%, and Cubans, 12%.

STATE'S LATINO POPULATION IS UP 2 MILLION, U.S. ESTIMATES

California's Latino population, which represents one-third of the Latinos
nationally, has increased by nearly 2 million since 1980, according to a Census
Bureau estimate released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that the nation's total Latino population has grown by 39%
since 1980, rising to a record 20.1 million. Latinos now make up 8.2% of the
U.S. population and have a population growth rate that is five times that of
non-Latinos, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Census Bureau spokesman Carmen Denavas said that half of the 6.7 million
California residents of Latino origin are immigrants. Immigration accounted for
about 50% of the national increase in the Latino population.
</P>
<P>
"This is our first estimate of over 20 million," said bureau spokesman Jorge
Del Pinal. "It's up from about 14.5 million in 1980."
</P>
<P>
While the Census Bureau estimate did not include specific Orange County
figures, the National Planning Data Corp., a Los Angeles-based research firm,
has estimated that the local Latino population has increased by 53% since 1980.
Orange County Latinos totaled 286,339 or about 14.8% of the population in 1980
compared to an estimated 440,117 -- about 19.2% -- in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Latinos account for 22.8% of North County residents, while they represent only
8.7% of the South County population.
</P>
<P>
The figures in the report are estimates and include illegal immigrants. There
are no precise figures for the numbers of illegal immigrants in the state or
the country, and estimates of the number vary widely.
</P>
<P>
California retains its rank as the state with by far the largest Latino
population, followed by Texas, which is home to 21% of the nation's Latinos.
Next are New York with 10% and Florida with 8%. The report also identified
Illinois, New Jersey, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado as having significant
Latino populations.
</P>
<P>
Estimates are not prepared for every state because "Hispanics are not well
spread out throughout the United States," Del Pinal said.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles on Wednesday, Mayor Tom Bradley joined with Latino leaders and
celebrities to kick off a city campaign designed to encourage Latino youths to
stand and be counted in the 1990 Census.
</P>
<P>
"Tell your friends, tell your family that Hispanics must be counted to earn
political power," came a message shouted not from the mouth of a politician,
but by Latin American rock star Jose Luis Rodriguez, who attended the event at
Roosevelt High School.
</P>
<P>
And, based on the high-pitched screams of approval from hundreds of teen-agers,
the words were well received.
</P>
<P>
The city of Los Angeles, bolstered with $600,000 in funding, has joined forces
with a host of community and civic groups to find ways to reach traditionally
under-counted groups, including Latinos, the homeless and those who live in
overcrowded apartments.
</P>
<P>
Officials said they have targeted high school-age Latino youths because the
students can pass along census information to their parents and push them to
fill out forms for the April 1 head count.
</P>
<P>
As part of the campaign, schools in areas with large immigrant populations will
be sent census lessons for classroom instruction throughout the campaign, which
lasts until April 1.
</P>
<P>
The official 1980 count missed as many as 10% of U.S. Latinos, according to
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau report said that the largest segment of the Latino population
is of Mexican descent, about 12.6 million. Residents of Central and South
American origin total 2.5 million, while those of Puerto Rican descent total
2.3 million and those of Cuban descent account for 1.1 million. The remainder
are of Spanish or other Latino origin.
</P>
<P>
While people of Mexican descent are the largest Latino group in the United
States, they are not the fastest-growing segment, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Comparing estimates from 1982 and 1989, the bureau said that the number of
Central and South Americans had increased by 67%. The "other Hispanic" category
rose 31%, followed by Mexicans, up 30%, Puerto Ricans, 14%, and Cubans, 12%.

   Unless birth control becomes available to
everybody by the end of the decade, the number of people on this
already overcrowded planet will double before a baby born today
reaches middle age, according to a study released Sunday.
   ``This is a preventable disaster,'' said Sharon L. Camp, vice
president of the private Population Crisis Committee, a
Washington-based advocacy group that released the report.
   ``We have what it would take _ the financial resources and the
know how _ to solve the problem, and to do so in our children's
lifetime.
   ``But we have to act immediately. We cannot dither away another
decade,'' she said.
   There are about 5.3 billion people in the world, a figure that
the United Nations says could rise to 14 billion before stabilizing
in the next century. The committee said today's population could
double in 39 years and reach 27 billion by the end of the 21st
century if present birth and death rates continued unchanged.
   Stopping population growth at about 9 billion to 10 billion
people would require use of contraceptives by some 75 percent of
couples, the study estimates. But to accomplish that the products
would have to be available to everyone by the end of this century
so the average family size could fall to about two children per
couple early in the 21st century.
   The report goes on to estimate the cost of such an effort _
$10.5 billion per year by the year 2000. Currently $3.2 billion is
spent on family planning in developing countries, where most
population growth is taking place.
   To finance this effort the report calls for increased aid from
industrial nations, including $1.2 billion from the United States,
$4 billion from other developed nations, $1 billion from
development banks, $500 million from private philanthropists and $1
billion from consumers of family planning services.
   ``Universal family planning is a bargain compared to the costs
of delaying world population stabilization,'' Camp said.
   The analysis found 29 countries, including the United States,
Japan and most of Europe, well on the way to ending population
growth.
   In addition, a dozen countries were making ``good'' progress,
the report said. These included Argentina, Poland, Israel, Turkey
and Thailand.
   But 18 nations were rated poor and 45 as very poor in
encouraging birth control.
   Here is a country-by-country rundown of the committee's rankings
of population control efforts.
   Excellent:
   Czechoslovakia, United Kingdom, Belgium, Finland, France, West
Germany, Italy, Sweden, Taiwan, Bulgaria, South Korea, United

   The specter of world hunger is moving nearer as
the population grows and the land loses its capacity to grow enough
food to keep pace, says Lester R. Brown, head of Worldwatch
Institute.
   ``With more hungry people in the world today than when this
decade began, there's little to celebrate on the food front as we
enter the '90s,'' he said.
   Brown, in a World Watch magazine report released Saturday, said
he sees no sure-fire way to boost global food production enough in
the 1990s to keep pace with expected population growth.
   ``The only reasonable goal will be to try and cut (population
growth) in half by the end of the century, essentially what Japan
did in the '50s and what China did in the '70s,'' he said.
   But reaching that goal will be ``perhaps more demanding than
anything the international community has ever undertaken,'' Brown
added.
   ``For the United States, the obvious first step is to restore its
funding of the United Nations Population Fund and International
Planned Parenthood Federation, which was canceled several years ago
in response to pressures from the political right,'' he said.
   The United States halted its support for the U.N. agency in 1986.
   ``Given the link between population growth and environmental
degradation, President George Bush cannot credibly call himself an
environmentalist if funding is not resumed,'' Brown said. ``In the
process, the United States could reinvigorate the international
family planning effort.''
   Last May, the United Nations Population Fund said that unless
women win more access to birth control, education and employment,
the world's population could almost triple to 14 billion by the year
2100.
   Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the U.N. agency, said the
world's population, now at 5.2 billion, may be held to 10 billion in
the next century if family planners succeed in reducing birth rates.
   In pulling its funding for the U.N. agency, the Reagan
administration contended it promoted coercive abortion, but Mrs.
Sadik said the reasons were political. She said movements such as
religious fundamentalism ``seem to be designed to somehow keep women
in bondage.''
   She expressed hope the Bush administration would resume the U.S.
contribution.
   However, the Bush administration has continued Reagan's policy of
not funding the agencies based on the idea that no federal funds
should be spent for population control that involves abortion.
   Brown, whose private, non-profit Worldwatch Institute for years
has espoused population control as part of its research and policy
recommendations, said some progress has been made in scaling back
birth rates, from about 2 percent annually in 1970 to 1.7 percent
this year.
   However, this decline has been so slow the annual incremental
increase is actually going up, he said. The world is now projected
to add 921 million people during the 1990s, the largest increment
ever for a decade.
   ``In many developing countries, soaring population now has a dual
effect on food balance,'' Brown said. ``It increase demand as it
degrades the agricultural resource base.
   ``For instance, crowded cities and villages create a need for
firewood that exceeds the sustainable yield of local forests.
Deforestation is the outcome, which in turn increases rainfall
runoff and soil erosion.''
   Brown said soil erosion tops the list of enviromental trends that
threaten humankind. Other hazards include air pollution's damage to
crops and its long-term effect on climate.
   Last year's drought in the United States and its lingering
effects in some areas reduced world grain output. Even with larger
crops this year, global stockpiles are still short, Brown said.
   With reduced output, world grain prices rose by roughly one-half
from July 1987 to July 1988 and have remained relatively high since,
he said.
   ``For many heavily indebted Third World countries, rising grain
prices are combining with falling personal incomes to pose a policy
dilemma,'' Brown said. ``Price hikes are needed to stimulate output
and encourage additional investment by farmers, but the world's poor
can't cope easily.
   ``Perhaps a billion or more of the world's people already spend
70 percent of their income on food. For many in this group, a
dramatic rise in the cost of grain is life threatening.''
   In the United States, a $1 loaf of bread contains only about five
cents worth of wheat. If the price of wheat were to double, the
price of the loaf would increase to only $1.05, Brown said. But in
poor countries, where wheat is bought at local markets and ground
into flour at home, a doubling of wheat prices means a doubling of
bread prices.
   ``A food price rise that is merely annoying to the world's
affluent can drive consumption below the survival level among the
poor,'' he said.

<HEAD>5.3 Billion To Triple In Century Without More Family Planning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's population of 5.3 billion may nearly
triple in the next century and pose a serious threat to the
environment unless family planning efforts are redoubled, according
to a U.N. report released today.
   ``The next 10 years will decide the shape of the 21st century.
They may decide the future of the Earth as a habitation for
humans,'' said Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the United
Nations Population Fund.
   Only six years ago, the report said, population growth appeared
to be slowing everywhere except Africa and parts of South Asia and
world population seemed likely to stabilize around 10.2 billion
toward the end of the next century.
   ``Today, the situation looks less promising,'' it said.
``Progress in reducing fertility rates has been slower than
expected.''
   ``If fertility reductions continue to be slower than projected,
the mark could be missed yet again. In that case the world could be
headed toward an eventual total of up to 14 billion people,'' Mrs.
Sadik said.
   She told a news conference that ``the best and quickest way to
reduce population growth'' is to invest in improving women's
status, access to education, health and access to family planning.
   The U.N. Population Fund report recommended that spending on
family planning in developing countries be doubled to $9 billion by
the end of the century.
   Mrs. Sadik said she hoped the United States will resume support
for the fund's activities. Last year, she said, the U.S. Congress
voted to contribute to the fund but President Bush vetoed the bill.
   U.S. abortion opponents had charged that because the U.N. agency
operates in China, which has a one-child-per-family policy, the
money would have indirectly supported forced abortions.
   Every year during the 1990s, the population will increase by 90
million to 100 million people, roughly equivalent to the current
population of Eastern Europe or Central America, the report said.
   Over the decade, a billion more people will inhabit the planet,
equivalent to an extra China, it said.
   ``The 1990s will see faster increases in human numbers than any
decade in history,'' Mrs. Sadik said.
   ``The choices of the next 10 years ... will decide whether world
population trebles or merely doubles before it finally stops
growing. They will decide whether the pace of damage to the
environment speeds up or slows down,'' she said.
   World population growth continues to be grossly out of balance,
with 90 percent of the increase in developing countries, and the
biggest growth in the poorest of them, said the State of World
Population 1990 report.
   ``At the start of the 1990s the choice must be to act decisively
to slow population growth, attack poverty and protect the
environment. The alternative is to hand on to our children a
poisoned inheritance,'' it said.
   According to the latest U.N. projections, the report said, the
world has overshot 1984 targets and is on course for a total nearer
11 billion than 10 billion.
   In 15 countries, 13 of them in Africa, birth rates rose between
the early 1960s and 1980s and in 23 more countries, they fell by
less than 2 percent, it said.
   In China, the world's most populous nation, Mrs. Sadik said
family size still increased from 2.3 to 2.5, partly because of the
age structure of the population and rural couples having more
children.
   She said countries in which women had the lowest status and
participated least in society tended to be the ones with the
highest birthrates and countries with sustained political support
for population programs achieved the best results.

   Population growth puts pressure on the
environment and resources, whether it occurs in the Third World or
the United States, a population group says in a new booklet.
   ``USA by Numbers: A Statistical Portrait of the United States,''
was issued Wednesday by Zero Population Growth to show how
increasing numbers of people affect the nation's environment,
economy and society as a whole.
   ``Although Americans are increasingly aware of population
pressures in other parts of the world, many of us do not recognize
the symptoms of overpopulation when we find them in our own
backyards,'' said Susan Weber, executive director of the non-profit
population group.
   The group has compiled statistics from a variety of sources,
many of which also appear in the massive Statistical Abstract of
the United States issued annually by the Commerce Department.
   The new 164-page volume, however, concentrates on the
relationship between population and the quality of life in the
nation.
   Chapters in the volume look at population growth over time, city
and rural relationships, young and old, fertility and health,
sexuality and abortion, unemployment, poverty, water use,
pollution, land use and habitat.
   The paperback volume costs $8.95 plus $1.50 for shipping and
handling and can be purchased from Zero Population Growth, 1601
Connecticut Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C., 20009.

BUSH PROMOTES A CANARD
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, with a veto, removed American support of the United Nations
Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA) from the foreign aid budget in the
groundless belief that some of the dollars might find their way into coercive
abortion programs in China. It is a regrettable extension of his decision to
perpetuate the population policy of former President Ronald Reagan by seeking
to impose restrictions on the use of abortion in poor foreign nations that are
far more stringent than the standards in the United States. Worse, the action
perpetuates canards about a successful, effective and principled U.N. program
at a time when world population growth is at a crisis level.
</P>
<P>
In the legislation vetoed by the President, $15 million of $220 million for
population programs was to go to the UNFPA. Under a carefully crafted
bipartisan amendment, none of the U.S. contribution would go to UNFPA's work in
China. That was to avoid even the appearance of giving support to the Chinese
population program, which is under fire for allegedly including coercive
abortion and sterilization. Never mind that there is no evidence that UNFPA in
any way aided or abetted the controversial elements of the Chinese program.
Never mind that the new UNFPA-China agreement reinforces that separation. And
never mind that there would be no better way to discourage abusive programs
than to enhance contraceptive campaigns, a main thrust of UNFPA.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the United States stands alone on this issue. All of the other
major nations, led by Japan and including the Soviet Union, have stepped in to
make up the declining American funding. The UNFPA, once dependent on the United
States for 25% of its support, now spends even more with no U.S. support. But
the missing dollars have hurt. Some of the replacement money received is not
readily convertible. And the absence of U.S. leadership and cooperation serves
to weaken the effort.
</P>
<P>
President Bush leads the world's richest, most powerful nation, a nation that
has gained effective control of its own population. But his nation is part of a
world whose population is out of control. There were 1.6 billion people 90
years ago. There are 5.2 billion now. And there will be 6 billion by the end of
the century. A quarter of those now living are hungry, and even more are
malnourished. It is a situation that calls for vigorous leadership and more,
not less, funds for effective world programs. Everywhere. Not least in China.

<LEADPARA>  IN 1984, after more than two decades as the leading force behind efforts to
improve access to family planning worldwide, the United States jumped ship. At
the World Conference on Population in Mexico City in 1984, we espoused our new
belief that population growth was a "neutral phenomenon" that neither advanced
nor inhibited the development of a given nation.;   At Mexico City, we also
reaffirmed the Reagan administration's "pro-life" position by stating that the
United States would not fund any organization that counsels women about
abortion. We withdrew our funding from the world's two largest and most
effective international family-planning organizations, the International
Planned Parenthood Federation and the United Nations Population Fund.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  AT THE 13TH CHILD, THERE IS NO MORAL DISCUSSION  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Chester Atkins, a Democratic representative from Massachusetts, chairs the
Congressional Coalition on Population and Development. He wrote this article
for the Washington Post.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Since 1984, this perverse combination of twisted demographic logic and
misdirected morality, known as the "Mexico City policy," has hindered
family-planning efforts worldwide.;   In the United States we live in a
virtual utopia, almost completely isolated from the pressure that rapid and
uncontrolled population growth is exerting on the rest of the world. Few of us
will ever watch our children starve to death or watch our crops and our
livelihood be ruined because deforestation has allowed a mud slide to ruin our
farmland. It is easy for us to engage in a sophisticated moral debate about
abortion.;   Recently in Bangladesh, I spoke with a woman who ran a
family-planning clinic partly funded by U.S. assistance. She told me she did
not understand the way that Americans think about abortion. She pointed to the
30-odd women squatting outside the clinic and told me each of them had watched
at least one of her children die of malnutrition or a treatable childhood
illness.;   She explained that when a woman in Bangladesh gets pregnant with
her 13th child, she does not engage in a moral discussion about the life of
the fetus. She deals with reality. The woman already has 12 children she
cannot feed, and she does not want to watch another child starve. So she goes
out into a rice paddy, finds a dried root and self-induces an abortion. Within
20 minutes, still in excruciating pain, the woman returns to work.;   The
Mexico City policy has led us to delete U.S. funding for the organizations
most capable of ensuring that women have no need to have an abortion: the
non-governmental and multilateral organizations that provide contraceptives to
the developing world.;   Logic would dictate that whenever possible we would
channel our funding through the organizations most capable of reaching the
largest number of people with their services. But clearly logic has no place
in the administration's international family-planning agenda.;   The U.N.
Population Fund estimates that since 1985 it has lost $286 million because of
a loss of U.S. funding. The United States withdrew funding because of the the
fund's supposed involvement with coercive family-planning programs in China.
When the United States stopped funding the International Planned Parenthood
Federation in 1985, the agency lost one-fourth of its total operating budget.;
  Within the next few decades, 3 billion young people will reach their
reproductive years. This represents the largest "baby boom" the world has ever
witnessed.;   Since 1960, the world has made tremendous strides toward
lowering fertility rates and improving contraceptive use rates. In 1960, the
global contraceptive use rate was approximately 10 percent. In 1990 that
number had risen to 45 percent, a phenomenal increase.;   Our commitment to
family planning since 1960 has prevented an estimated 412 million pregnancies
-- yet the population of the world has still increased by more than 2 billion,
and there are still billions of people without adequate food, shelter and
health care.;   By the year 2000, all of the important gains we have made
might be lost. With a tidal wave of young people about to enter their peak
reproductive years, the global community will have to substantially increase
its commitment to family planning simply to keep from losing previous gains
and to make more progress.;   On June 12, the House voted to reverse the
Mexico City policy and restore funding to the United Nations Population Fund.
On July 26, the Senate approved a foreign-aid authorization bill with similar
family-planning provisions.;   Clearly, the House and the Senate, reflecting
public opinion, are trying to send the president a message. The White House
has refused to listen. President Bush has promised to veto any legislation to
reverse the Mexico City policy or restore funding to the U.N. Population
Fund.;   The president must look beyond the "pro-life" advocates who have so
tightly encircled him and consider legislation that would really promote
sustainable life on this planet. Overpopulation is a critical problem that
cannot be ignored.  </TEXT>

   The head of the U.N. Population agency said Friday
she hoped new U.S. President George Bush would end a three-year U.S.
Boycott of agency funding programs linked to alleged coercive
abortions in China.
   Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the U.N. Fund for
Population Activities, said, ``we see a new opportunity with the new
administration'' for resuming U.S. Participation in family planning
programs.
   The United States has withheld about $85 million from the UNFPA
since 1985, charging that Chinese family planning programs backed by
the UNFPA involve coercive abortions.
   ``We are not supporting any abortion program anywhere in the
world,'' Sadik said. She said Chinese officials had stressed to her
that although there are isolated cases of coercion, China does not
force women to undergo abortions.
   She said Bush was ``strongly supportive of population policies''
when he was U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. in 1971-73 and should have
special sympathy for China, where he also lived in 1974-75 as head
of the U.S. Liaison office.
   Sadik, from Pakistan, said she also told the Chinese that they
should work harder to improve the image of their family planning
program, which is striving to hold down a population which has
reached 1.1 billion.
   Since 1980 China has tried to enforce a one-child per couple
policy. The policy has had some successes in the cities, but has met
resistance in the countryside where the return of family farming has
made it advantageous to have more children.
   Newly affluent farmers are also willing to pay heavy fines
imposed for giving birth to two or more children. After dipping in
the early 1980s, the rate of population growth has begun to creep up
again, and demographers now estimate the population at the end of
the century will be about 1.28 billion, well above the original
target of 1.2 billion.
   The Chinese, Dr. Sadik said, ''are not quite sure what they can
do to increase acceptance of family planning.''
   She said the stress is on more thorough education and better
clinical services.
   The UNFPA, she said, is urging China to improve the quality of
its contraceptive devices.
   Prod A. Laquian, deputy representative of the UNFPA in Beijing,
said 50 million Chinese woven wear a stainless steel intrauterine
device that is often ineffective as a contraceptive.
   He said 10 percent of women wearing the IUD become pregnant, and
that 50 to 70 percent of women who obtain abortions were usng the
faultylIUDs.
   Dr. Sadik said production of effective contraceptives will be the
top priority in a proposed 57-million-U.S. dollar UNFPA aid program
for China in the 1990-94 period. Funding will also go to maternal
and child health, information and publicity for family planning,
demographic training and programs for women.
   She said the program will be presented to the UNFPA Governing
Council in June, at which time the United States, a member of the
council, will have to take a stand. ``My hope is that the United
States and China don't want a confrontation.''
   The UNFPA will have a budget this year of about 190 million
dollars, with China the second largest recipient of funds after
India.
   Dr. Sadik said African countries, many which have just begun
family planning programs, have been the worst hit by the withdrawal
of U.S. funds.
   She said other donors have increased their contributions in
recent years. But she said that as a result of the U.S. pullout
``we've had to stretch the programs out, and reduce their scope. We
did lose some momentum.''

   Couples like Faustino and Gloria
Aquino are one reason Mexican officials are having trouble reducing
population growth.
   Their shop, on a hillside overlooking metropolitan Mexico City,
is next door to a family planning clinic. They have eight children
and are expecting a ninth.
   ``There didn't used to be planning,'' said Aquino, 45. His wife
added: ``Now that there is, we don't practice it.''
   Aquino, his dark eyes twinkling, was leaned against a meat case
at their butcher shop-fruit stand. Gloria, 37, dipped a shet of
pork rind into a vat of smoking fat outside the store.
   An extensive network of family-planning programs shrank Mexico's
annual population growth from 3.5 percent in the early 1970s to an
estimated 2.1 percent.
   Now the goal is 1 percent growth. Officials recently presented a
plan that backed off on that target, but an annoyed president
ordered them back to their original goal.
   It isn't an easy task.
   Aquino jokes with the doctor, Hipolito Ascencio Mateo, at the
clinic next to his butcher shop-fruit stand. Painted sunny yellow,
the clinic occupies two rooms rented to it by Aquino.
   But the Aquinos don't avail themselves of its services. Aquino
says he is afraid to have a vasectomy, and his wife Gloria, 37,
says her body won't tolerate contraceptives.
   Their children range in age from 1 to 19.
   A well-publicized family planning program quickly reaches half
the women, those who want to limit their families and are waiting
for the means to do it, said Evold Hosein, director of program
support for the International Planned Parenthood Federation.
   ``That figure stabilizes unless we do something differently,''
he said by telephone from New York. ``We're not sure what it is
that we must do differently.''
   About 55 percent of Mexican women of reproductive age use
contraceptives, according to the Health Department. The number
varies widely by education level and between rural areas and the
cities.
   Young families with only two children, once an oddity, are
becoming common in large cities.
   Abortion is illegal, but common. Although Mexico is
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, the church does not actively oppose
family planning.
   The 1 percent annual growth goal was in 1977, four years after
the constitution was changed from advocating births to promoting
family planning, and the sale of contraceptives was legalized.
   To reduce population growth to that level, 82 percent of fertile
women will have to use contraceptives, more than in the United
States or China, government demographers say. The number of
children a woman bears must decline from an average of 3.4 this
year to 1.67 in 1999.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari links reducing population
growth to development.
   ``The social needs and economic demands, especially for job
creation, are too many for us to abandon this original goal of 1
percent demographic growth by the year 2000,'' he said in February.
``Even reaching it, the challenges will be formidable; imagine if
we don't achieve it.''
   He spoke after officials admitted missing earlier marks and
proposed a goal of 1.5 percent a year. That would put the
population at 105 million in 2000, about 4 million more than at
Salinas' pace, according to estimates made before the 1990 census.
   In a rare public reprimand, Salinas singled out the three
largest public health services.
   ``Your effort has diminished and, as a consequence, we have to
redouble it, especially in rural areas,'' he said. The director of
the National Population Program was replaced.
   Mexico is emerging from deep depression and has difficulty
providing education, public services and utility installations.
With half the population under age 19, more than 800,000 people
enter the job market each year.
   In May, the United Nations said in its annual population report
world fertility rates were declining more slowly than expected. The
1990s will determine whether the world population of 5.3 billion
doubles or triples before leveling off, said Dr. Nafis Sadik,
director of the U.N. Population Fund.
   Uncertain figures make it even harder to chart Mexico's growth.
   Preliminary figures from the 1990 census, released Friday, show
the population is 81.1 million, more than 4 million below earlier
government projections. The validity of the estimated population
growth rate has been questioned, said a public health official who
asked not to be identified, and the announcement gave no new
current growth figure.
   Jesus Kumate, the health secretary, calls for better education
and job opportunities for women, more local health workers to
insert intrauterine devices, increased sex education in schools and
a subsidy for an injectable contraceptive developed in Mexico.
   Aquino, whose youngest children were playing at his feet, said
he approved of Salinas' objective ``because that way everyone will
be able to eat the same.''
   ``After this next one,'' he said, ``we're going to stop.''

<HL> Three Billion Day Approaches in Asia And Causes Concern --- China Presses Birth Control; Responses on Global Level Urged at Meeting in Japan </HL>

   Seven babies are born every second in Asia, and the continent may be only days away from reaching three billion inhabitants.
This is causing some concern in the world's most crowded corner.

   China greeted the prospect with a ceremony and speeches that urged its citizens to keep practicing birth control.
In Tokyo, a group of experts gathered to debate the significance of the approaching milestone, its effects on the family and the growing problem of feeding all those people.

   Takashi Sato, Japan's minister of agriculture, said Friday that "excessive population growth will result in shortages of food, resources and energy . . . and environmental destruction beyond national boundaries.

   "Without global-level responses to the issues of population, food, environment and development," he said, "it would be difficult for the world to welcome a peaceful 21st century."
Mr. Sato is chairman of the Asian Forum of Parliamentarians on Population and Development, which sponsored the conference.

   In July 1987, the world's population passed five billion, double the population in 1950.

   According to United Nations estimates, Asia's population will reach three billion on Aug. 10.
Asia experts, however, predict the milestone will be reached within days.

   Prof. Gayl D. Ness of the University of Michigan, a sociologist and researcher on Asian population, estimated that Asia's population would grow to 3.5 billion by the end of the century -- and to 4.5 billion by the year 2025 while the world population reaches 8.2 billion.

   Rice production will have to increase 50% by 2025 to feed the continent, Prof. Ness said, but great gains already have been registered by farmers in China, Japan and Southeast Asia.

   The 21st century targets, he said, "are well within the realm of possibility if the agricultural transformation continues; this, of course, requires sensitive government policies."

   Asia, said Prof. Ness, has made "substantial progress" in lowering fertility rates, and Asian countries were the first to adopt policies to limit population growth.

   But he noted disparities between regions of Asia.
East Asian countries such as China, which has 1.08 billion people, and Japan, which has 122 million, have rapidly declining fertility rates.
But in South Asia, India is still experiencing 2.08% annual growth in its current population of 818 million; Pakistan has 3.45% growth with 115 million people; and Bangladesh has a 2.67% growth rate from a current base of 110 million, according to U.N. figures.

   "The challenge lies ahead in completing the demographic transition and bringing birth rates down to match the fall in the death rates," Prof. Ness said.

   He and other panelists were critical of the United States for withdrawing money from the U.N. Fund for Population Activities because of the fund's support for abortion.

   The population growth also has caused some social changes.

   Prof. Toshio Kuroda, director emeritus of Tokyo's Institute of Population at Nihon University, noted that China "expects the family to care for the aged . . . but the family is undergoing tremendous change in China with the one-child family."

   China, the world's most populous country, has since the early 1980s limited most families to one child.
But the limit has been widely flouted in the past two years.

   In Beijing, Chinese officials heralded the Day of Three Billion in Asia with a ceremony in the Great Hall of the People. They handed out cassette players to 18 family planning workers, doctors and others for "outstanding performance in implementing our population policy." Speakers warned that rapid population growth poses a threat to economic development. Said Hu Keshi, forum vice chairman:
   "We cannot think that we can have more children because of economic development . . . nor can we relax our efforts because of progress in family planning."

   Four senators told President Bush Thursday
that Congress will press again this year for a U.S. contribution to
the United Nations population control agency, a fight that led to a
veto of last year's foreign aid bill.
   The lawmakers said Third World population growth poses ``a grave
threat to our own future security'' because of the increasing
pressures it places on the environment and on the political
stability of poor countries.
   Supporters of aid to the U.N. Population Fund dropped a $15
million appropriation for the agency as part of a compromise after
Bush vetoed the foreign aid bill last year. But they believe they
have a better chance of getting the aid approved because of growing
GOP restiveness on the abortion issue.
   Adding to their optimism is an agreement by the U.N. agency to
allow the United States to earmark its population aid for specific
countries whose family planning practices do not run counter to the
president's abortion stand.
   The House and Senate voted to send money to the agency last
year, which would have reversed a 5-year-old Reagan administration
policy. Anti-abortion forces objected because the agency sends
money to China, which uses coercion and abortion to enforce a
one-child-per-family policy.
   But Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., Mark
Hatfield, R-Ore., and Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., told Bush in the
letter Thursday that the U.N. agency does not support abortion and
has guaranteed it will not use American money in China.
   ``With the population of the developing countries projected to
grow by over 900 million during the 1990s ... we cannot afford to
remain outside the UNFPA,'' the senators wrote.
   A group of moderate House and Senate Republicans sent a similar
letter last month to Secretary of State James A. Baker III calling
for renewal of U.S. funding for the UNFPA.
   Last year's veto ``sent the wrong signal to the American public
and the international community regarding the Republican Party's
support for international family planning services,'' they wrote.

<TEXT>     "Population growth has a profoundly adverse effect on the environment," the
report issued Wednesday said.;   The same agency reported in May that world
population was expected to reach 5.4 billion by the middle of this year and
could increase to 10.2 billion by the year 2050, 25 years ahead of earlier
estimates.;   That report said the world fertility rate must be reduced from
3.8 births per woman to 3.3, and in line with that, the new report said world
population growth must be balanced against the resources to handle it.;
"Every year of delayed action brings us closer to the brink -- the red line of
resource collapse and social dislocation that humanity must never cross," the
new report said.;   That may have happened already in some of the world's
poorer countries, where population pressures are at their greatest, it said.
And things could turn ugly in the cities.;   "If the 'million-plus' cities
continue to mushroom at current rates, transport, communication, health and
sanitation systems could be overwhelmed and political systems endangered," the
report said.;   "Nonsense," said Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, when asked about
the report, which he called "typical of at least that agency of the U.N.";
"People are not a drain on the resources of the planet," Kemp said.;   The
United States has refused to give money to the U.N. Population Fund since the
1980s because the agency operates in China, which has coercive
population-control policies that have included forced sterilization and forced
abortion.;   A foreign aid bill stalled in the House would provide $20 million
for the agency this year, but President Bush has threatened a veto if the bill
passes with that provision in it.;   Environmental groups, including Zero
Population Growth, the National Audubon Society, the Population Institute, the
National Wildlife Federation and the Population Crisis Committee, lined up
Wednesday to hail the U.N. report.;   "We call upon the Bush administration
and Congress to take aggressive leadership to address the population emergency
today," said Nancy Wallace, Washington director of the Sierra Club's
international population program.;   "We can't begin to talk about the
environment, the economy or human suffering on this planet without addressing
the population crisis," she said.  </TEXT>

reach 3 billion at 47 minutes after midnight Greenwich Mean Time on
Aug. 10 (8:47 p.m. EDT Aug. 9). Asian experts, however, predict the
milestone will be reached within days.

   In Beijing, Chinese officials marked the Day of 3 Billion In
Asia with a ceremony in the Great Hall of the People.
   They handed out cassette players to 18 family planning workers,
doctors and others for ``outstanding performance in implementing
our population policy.''
   Speakers warned that rapid population growth poses a threat to
economic development.
   ``We cannot think that we can have more children because of
economic development ... nor can we relax our efforts because of
progress in family planning,'' said Hu Keshi, forum vice chairman.

<HEAD>World Population Could Hit 14 Billion in 2100</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Unless women win more access to family planning,
education and employment, the world's population could almost
triple to 14 billion by the year 2100, a U.N. agency said in a
report Tuesday.
   Too many women remain trapped because of fundamentalist
religions that ``keep women in bondage'' and cultural values that
put men first, said Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive director of the
United Nations Population Fund, in launching the 1989 State of
World Population Report.
   Appealing for a fivefold increase in world spending on family
planning, the report said: ``The status of women will be crucial in
determining future population growth rates.''
   Half the world's women have no access to family planning
services _ mostly those in traditional male-dominated societies or
areas far from family planning services, Mrs. Sadik said.
   ``Yet, this is precisely the audience we must reach if we are to
have further success in our efforts,'' she said.
   She said world population, now 5.2 billion, ``is at a critical
juncture,'' likely to increase by more than 90 million a year until
the end of the century and stabilize at 10 billion about a century
from now.
   This optimistic projection assumes that fertility in the
developing world will drop by one-third in the next 40 years, the
report said.
   The report said about 465 million women in the developing world,
or 45 percent, use contraceptives: 14 percent in Africa, 50 percent
in Asia, and 56 percent in Latin America.
   Without China's extensive birth control program, the overall use
of contraceptives in the developing world would drop to about 30
percent, the report said.
   To attain the desired drop in fertility, 58 percent of women
will have to be using family planning in 2000 and 71 percent _ the
present level in industrialized countries _ by 2025, it said. In
sub-Saharan Africa, those using family planning would have to
increase tenfold.
   ``But this will not happen unless more of the world's women are
given more health care, family planning services, education, and
employment opportunities,'' Mrs. Sadik said.
   ``We now have clear-cut, concrete evidence of linkage between
female education, fertility and mortality, between gainful
employment for women and patterns of family formation, and between
women's participation and the success of population programs and
economic development,'' she said.
   Thirty-one countries in the developing world still have
virtually no family planning facilities, the report said, and 37 of
the poorest countries have cut health spending by half and
education by one-fourth in the last four years.
   If the family planners failed, the world would have 14 billion
people by 2100, which ``would create enormous potential for
violence and social upheaval,'' she said.
   The Pakistani physician called on societies to end legal and
social discrimination against women, increase their access to
leadership positions, and teach at all levels ``that women and men
are equal in value.''
   Asked whether religious fundamentalism was hampering women and
family planning, she replied: ``All these movements seem to be
designed to somehow keep women in bondage.''
   She accused religious leaders of being on ``a power-ego thing
... They're reinforcing their authority. It's like all religious
leaders ... who do they talk to? They talk to the poor and the
illiterate and those are the only groups they can really sway.
   ``All religious movements look at the woman as the one who
should cater to and serve the family, never the other gender,'' she
said.
   She criticized the United States for halting its contribution to
the Fund in 1986. The Reagan administration contended the agency's
policies promoted coercive abortion but Mrs. Sadik said the reasons
were political and expressed hope the Bush administration would
resume the U.S. contribution.
   The U.N. Population Fund urged governments to earmark 1 percent
of gross national product for family planning. It asked major
donors to increase assistance for family planning programs fivefold
to $2.5 billion a year.
   ``This could also save 3 million women's lives by the year 2000,
as fewer poor women would die from complications from pregnancy,
childbirth and illegal abortion,'' Mrs. Sadik said.

FT  18 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Controlling population
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two stories are told in the annual report from the United Nations population
fund, published yesterday. The first is one of success: in the past 40 years
the rate of growth of the world's population has slowed sharply. The second
 -about prospects for the future - is less cheerful. Nevertheless, the
evidence shows neither that population growth is the overwhelming problem it
is so often alleged to be, nor that policy is helpless to lower it, even in
poor countries. What is required is no more - but also no less - than to
help people, particularly women, achieve the families they themselves
desire.
The most encouraging feature of past experience is that, contrary to the
once cherished theories of demographers, declines in the rate of population
growth have occurred even in countries that have seen little economic
growth. Education of women has helped. But much of the fall can be
attributed to better distribution of contraception, argues the UN. One of
the clearest messages of the report is that people will willingly use
contraception, if it is made available.
The UN's story about the prospects for coming decades is somewhat more
disturbing. The number of people on the planet is likely almost to double,
from the present 5.7bn to some 10bn, by the middle of next century. This
assumes that birth rates continue to fall; other assumptions suggest figures
between 8bn and 12.5bn.
Food supplies
Yet such increases need be no disaster. The UN report rightly rebuts fears
of a global food shortage, of the kind voiced by the Club of Rome two
decades ago. But uneven distribution of the world's food supplies leaves
people in many regions facing starvation. More even than food, water may
become a cause of conflict. It also warns that pressure on other natural
resources - forests, seas and the atmosphere - will increase.
Yet it is important to recognise that population growth is not the sole
cause of pressure on resources. Nor would even a stable global population
halt it. Economic growth is still more important. That is why the 15 per
cent of the world's population in rich countries consumes so
disproportionate a share of global resources. It is also why calls from this
minority for limits on the numbers of the poor majority look morally
disreputable.
Neither prophecies of doom nor hypocritical bombast are justified. What is
needed, instead, is for developing countries themselves to recognise that
unchecked population growth imposes, at best, a heavy burden of additional
investment upon them. At worst, it threatens their social stability, as
people flood from the countryside to the cities, in search of jobs.
Family planning
These pressing social and economic issues underline the importance of next
month's conference in Cairo, the first UN meeting on population for a
decade. The UN's draft agenda calls for co-ordination of measures to
stabilise the world's population, including a trebling of spending on family
planning programmes, and better education for women.
This is the right policy agenda, because it emphasises helping people help
themselves. This is not just the most ethical, but also the most practical
way to address the issue, since what people want for themselves is also what
their societies need.
Despite the convergence of support for such measures among governments, the
agenda faces opposition. This month the Vatican, which has called on
governments to boycott the conference, accused the UN of promoting abortion.
That charge is ill-founded, given that the United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA) is barred from portraying abortion as a way to control family size.
It would be both inhumane and imprudent for governments to reject the UN's
draft agenda. That is not to make light of the social and cultural
implications of the policies recommended by the UNFPA. But it is surely
right for women to be given control over the number of children they bear.
Western countries should assist countries that wish to make contraception
available, though not those that resort to coercion. They should also remind
recalcitrant governments that the alternative to contraception is both lower
growth in incomes per head and serious social disruption.

<P>
NOTES ON THE CURRENT STATUS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OF POPULATION
</P>
<P>
There are currently an estimated 5.3 billion people on the planet, with the
number expected to grow at an annual rate of about 1.5% throughout the 1990s,
according to the World Bank. That means the world population will top 6 billion
near the end of the decade. Even though the growth rate is expected to slow
down after that, another billion will probably be added before the year 2010.
The fastest population growth is in those countries least capable economically
of sustaining it. By 2025, the percentage of humanity living in less-developed
nations will rise from 1985's 75.7% to 84.1%.
</P>
<P>
OF QUALITY LIVING
</P>
<P>
The Population Crisis Committee, a Washington-based think tank, recently rated
the quality of life in the world's 100 largest metropolitan areas. Based on
such indicators as infant mortality, air quality, traffic flow, public safety,
education, communications, food costs and living space, the group rated
Melbourne, Australia, Montreal, and Seattle as the world's most livable urban
environments. At the bottom of the list: Lagos, Nigeria; Kinshasa, Zaire;
Kanpur, India; Dhaka, Bangladesh; and Recife, Brazil. Los Angeles was ranked
16th, with a "good" quality of life.
</P>
<P>
OF HUMAN RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
Despite dramatic reforms in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and South Africa,
thousands of people were arrested, tortured and killed last year by governments
trying to suppress ethnic and nationalist tensions, Amnesty International said
in its 1990 report. The London-based human rights group said that in countries
like Ethiopia, Myanmar (formerly Burma), Somalia and Sudan, long-standing
ethnic tensions have erupted in sweeping attacks on peasants in opposition
areas or killings based solely on ethnic origin.
</P>
<P>
OF THE ENVIRONMENT
</P>
<P>
Among global environmental problems, depletion of the ozone layer,
deforestation and global warming appear to be at the top of the political
agenda at the moment. Brazil is to host a U.N. Conference on Environment and
Development in 1992, with the aim of building on two existing agreements: the
1979 Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and the 1985
Convention on Protection of the Ozone Layer. The goal of the 1992 conference is
to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions, promote energy efficiency and reduce the
pace of deforestation.
</P>
<P>
OF ECONOMICS
</P>
<P>
With its goal of establishing a single European market by the end of 1992, the
European Community will become an economic powerhouse second -- barely -- only
to the United States. Its 12 member countries have a collective gross national
product of $4.8 trillion. They are: Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany,
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
OF NUCLEAR ARMS
</P>
<P>
There are five acknowledged nuclear weapons states: The United States, Britain,
Soviet Union, France and China. In addition, India has also detonated a nuclear
device. Israel is believed to have manufactured nuclear weapons. Top officials
in both South Africa and Pakistan have stated publicly that their countries
have "the capability" to make nuclear weapons should they desire to do so.
Iraq's nuclear capabilities have been debated. In 1981, Israel stalled Iraq's
nuclear program when it bombed a nuclear reactor under construction outside
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
OF TRAVEL
</P>
<P>
This year, the U.S. State Department issued warnings or advisories urging
caution or restricting travel to 52 countries. They include: Bangladesh,
Bolivia, Burma, Chad, Chile, China, Colombia, Cyprus, Ecuador, El Salvador,
Gabon, Ghana, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kenya,
Liberia, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nepal, Nicaragua, Northern Ireland, Pakistan,
Peru, Philippines, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia, South Africa, Soviet Union, Sri
Lanka, Sudan, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Vietnam, Yemen, Yugoslavia, Zaire,
Zambia, Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
OF FOREIGN AID
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Agency for International Development, the primary
recipients of U.S. foreign aid in 1989 were Israel, $1.2 billion; Sub-Saharan
Africa, $1.053 billion; Egypt, $968 million; Philippines, $389 million;
Pakistan, $352 million; El Salvador, $308 million; Bangladesh, $180 million;
Guatemala, $147 million; Costa Rica, $122 million; Jamaica, $115 million;
Morocco, $93 million.
</P>
<P>
OF LITERACY
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics issued by the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization showed that 25% of the world's population over the age of 15 is
illiterate. It is believed that as many as 1 billion people in the world cannot
read or write. In the 42 countries listed by the United Nations as the least
developed in the world, most people are illiterate. Illiteracy is also a
problem in developed nations. Surveys indicate that between 10% and 20% of the
people in various industrial nations are illiterate.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Backers of U.S. support for a United Nations
family-planning agency are seeking to reverse President Bush's
decision to exclude the organization from this year's foreign aid
bill.
   Four senators _ two Democrats and two Republicans _ told Bush in
a letter Thursday that they hope for a compromise. Failing that,
they said they plan to force the issue, which led to a veto of last
year's foreign aid bill.
   Both the House and Senate voted last year to give $15 million to
the United Nations Population Fund, known as UNFPA, to help carry
out its family planning activities in more than 140 countries
around the world.
   But the provision ultimately was dropped from the foreign aid
bill after Bush vetoed the measure. The White House had come under
heavy pressure from anti-abortion forces who complained that the
agency operates programs in China, which uses forced abortions and
sterilizations to carry out its one-child-per-family policy.
   In their letter, Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; Barbara Mikulski,
D-Md.; Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.; and Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., argued
that Third World population growth poses ``a grave threat to our
own future security'' because of the increasing pressures it places
on the environment and on the political stability of poor countries.
   Supporters of aid to UNFPA are optimistic they can prevail this
time around, in part because the population agency is willing to
provide extraordinary safeguards to make sure the money is not used
in China and in part because of growing GOP fear of highlighting
the abortion issue.
   The senators told Bush that UNFPA has agreed to permit the
United States to earmark its population aid for specific countries
whose family planning practices are in line with U.S. values, and
will allow audits to make sure the money isn't freeing other funds
for use in China.
   The agency has received no U.S. aid since President Reagan
halted it more than five years ago, and a congressional source said
it is anxious to regain American participation ``for the
symbolism'' as much as for the money. UNFPA expects that if the
United States resumes participation, its contributions would grow
in later years, said the source, who demanded anonymity.
   ``With the population of the developing countries projected to
grow by over 900 million during the 1990s ... we cannot afford to
remain outside the UNFPA,'' the senators wrote.
   ``Renewed confrontation serves no one's interest,'' they said,
asking the administration to open discussions with Capitol Hill
aimed at finding a compromise.
   A group of moderate House and Senate Republicans sent a similar
letter last month to Secretary of State James A. Baker III calling
for renewal of U.S. aid to UNFPA and chastising opponents for
miscasting the argument as an abortion issue.
   Bush's veto last year ``sent the wrong signal to the American
public and the international community regarding the Republican
Party's support for international family planning services,'' they
wrote.
   ``This is a women's issue, a family issue, an environmental
issue and an international security issue,'' said the GOP group,
which included two women House members running for the Senate this
year _ Reps. Lynn Martin of Illinois and Claudine Schneider of
Rhode Island. ``It remains an issue of great importance to the
Republican Party.''

FT  30 APR 92 / UN body calls for cut in population growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD population growth rates will have to be reduced over the next decade
if economic development is to be sustained and the environment protected,
according to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA).
Human numbers are growing at record rates, with an annual increase of about
97m projected for the next 10 years, says the organisation's State of the
World Population 1992 report.
That would mean 6bn people in 1998, and 10bn in 2050, compared with 5.48bn
this summer. Without 'immediate and determined action' to reduce future
family sizes, world population could reach 12.5bn in 2050, it warns.
UNFPA found that, since 1975, population growth rates have been linked to
per capita income in developing countries - before then, no such connection
had been established.
Countries with slower population growth rates saw annual incomes rise by an
average 1.23 per cent a year in the 1980s compared with a fall of 1.25 per
cent in countries where population grew faster. Lower birth rates also meant
higher savings and investment ratios.
Eliminating extreme poverty, improving health and education, and raising the
status of women are seen as essential steps to encouraging reduced family
sizes.
Such policies should give special attention to Africa and south Asia, which
are responsible for more than half the population increases and which
contain most of the world's very poor, says UNFPA.
The issue of sustainable development is also tackled in the report, which
says record population growth rates are being accompanied by record human
consumption of resources.

   A U.N. official said Friday she hopes President
Bush will end a three-year boycott of U.N. family-planning programs
that Washington has accused of supporting forced abortions in China.
   Nafis Sadik, executive director of the U.N. Fund for Population
Activities, said, ``We see a new opportunity with the new
administration.''
   The United States has withheld about $85 million from the agency
since 1985, charging that Chinese family-planning programs backed by
the agency involve forced abortions.
   However, Ms. Sadik said Friday, ``We are not supporting any
abortion program anywhere in the world.''
   She also said Chinese officials had stressed to her that although
isolated cases of coercion do crop up, China does not force women to
undergo abortions.
   Ms. Sadik said Bush ws ``strongly supportive of population
policies'' as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in 1971-73. She
also said he should have ``special sympathy for China,'' where he
lived in 1974-75 as head of the U.S. liaison office.
   Ms. Sadik, of Pakistan, said she also told the Chinese they
should work harder to improve the image of their family-planning
program.
   Chinese officials are striving to hold down a population of 1.1
billion, the largest in the world. Since 1980, they have tried to
enforce a one-child per couple policy.
   The policy has met some success in the cities but encountered
resistance in the countryside, where the return of family farming
has made it advantageous to have more children. Newly affluent
farmers are often willing to pay heavy fines imposed for giving
birth to two or more children.
   After dipping in the early 1980s, the rate of population growth
has begun to creep up again. Demographers estimate the population at
the end of the century will be about 1.28 billion, 80 million above
the original target.
   However, Sadik said African countries, many of which have just
begun family-planning programs, were hit hardest by the withdrawal
of U.S. funds.

<TEXT>
Worldwide spending on family planning needs to rise to Dollars 17bn by the
end of the decade - more than treble present levels - if the growth in the
world's population is to be curbed, the United Nations population fund said
yesterday.
The UN call comes amid an international row over the agenda of next month's
population conference in Cairo, the first UN meeting to tackle the issue for
a decade.
This week, US anti-abortionists joined the Vatican and Islamic leaders in
attacking the conference's draft agenda, which calls on countries to draw up
plans for stabilising the world's population.
The agenda also covers homosexuality, women's rights and teenage sex, but it
is the comments on abortion that have provoked the fiercest opposition. The
US's powerful anti-abortion lobby took full page advertisements in leading
newspapers this week to accuse the UN and the US of promoting abortion as a
means of contraception.
Governments from the Philippines to the Middle East have been drawn into the
controversy, in which the US and the Vatican have been cast as the prime
antagonists. Pope John Paul II, who has accused the conference of promoting
the 'culture of death', last week attacked the conference's support for
artificial birth control.
Islamic leaders in Cairo, and Iran's Moslem-led government have also
criticised sections of the draft document.
Mr Timothy Wirth, the US undersecretary of state for global affairs, has
insisted that 'neither US policy nor the Cairo document promotes abortion'.
The UN said the agenda commented on abortion only in the context of a threat
to women's health.
The UN population fund, which estimates that 250,000 women die each year
from the 50m abortions performed worldwide, has called for better
distribution of contraceptives to help reduce the number of unwanted
pregnancies. UN officials are exasperated that the abortion row threatens to
distract debate from the broader issues of population growth.
According to the fund's annual report, published yesterday, the world's
present population of 5.7bn is set to rise to 10bn by the middle of the next
century even if the sharp falls in birth rates seen in recent years
continue.
But it argues that the population could be stabilised at 7.8bn if
contraception were made much more widely available.

   Mankind's growth is accelerating again as the
world adds the equivalent of another Mexico every year, the
Population Reference Bureau reported Tuesday.
   The private research group said that the world's population
growth, after having slowed in the 1970s, is speeding up once more.
As of mid-1989, the world will contain about 5.24 billion people,
nearly a quarter-billion more than in 1987.
   Demographers Carl Haub and Mary Kent report that the expansion
from 5 billion to 6 billion could be attained in a record time _
within less than a decade _ if growth continues at current rates.
   The world is adding about 90 million people per year, slightly
more than the current Mexican population estimated at 87 million.
   The report is in line with one issued a week ago by Nafis Sadik,
executive director of the United Nations Population Fund. That
report agreed with the Reference Bureau estimate, and the U.N.
official called for increased access to family planning, education
and employment for women around the globe.
   Kent and Haub's comments accompanied the annual World Population
Data Sheet, a poster-size summary of world population trends
compiled annually by the private group.
   ``Even to reach a stable world population size of 10 billion,
double the current total, birth rates will have to begin a steady
descent soon,'' they said.
   There have been declines in the growth rate in some developing
countries, such as China, Thailand and Indonesia, but there is
little evidence of change in many others, they reported.
   ``Unless we see declines in high fertility rates in many African
and Asian countries during the 1990s, the prospect for world
population to level out at less than 10 billion seems very dim,''
they said.
   ``As far as ultimate world population size is concerned, the
1990s will truly be a decade of decision,'' they added.
   At current rates, the world's population will rise to 6.3
billion by the year 2000 and to 8.3 billion by 2020, the group
estimated, adding that the planet's population will double in 39
years.
   The summary notes a sharp difference between developed and
developing nations.
   It reports developed nations currently contain 1.2 billion
people and will take 122 years to double their population. The
developing nations, however, already contain 4 billion and can be
expected to double in 32 years.
   China remains the most populated country on Earth with 1.1
billion people and an estimated doubling time of 49 years.
   Second is India with 835 million and it has a faster growth
rate. Expected doubling time there is 32 years.
   Far behind those two population giants, the Soviet Union is
third with 289 million people and a doubling time of 70 years.
   The United States is fourth in population at 248 million and
this country will likely take 98 years to double that number.
   Fifth is Indonesia, with 184.6 million people and a doubling
time of 35 years.
   Other nations with more than 100 million residents, and their
anticipated doubling times, are Brazil, 147 million, 34 years;
Japan, 123 million, 141 years; Nigeria, 115 million, 24 years;
Bangladesh, 115 million, 25 years; Pakistan, 110 million, 24 years.

   Women hold the key to economic development and
slower population growth but many are trapped by cultural values
and fundamentalist religions that put men first, the head of the
U.N. Population Fund says.
   Dr. Nafis Sadik of Pakistan issued the agency's 1989 State of
World Population Report on Tuesday and called for a fivefold
increase in world spending on family planning. She said governments
should put population control on a par with major economic
investments.
   With the world's population at 5.2 billion and current growth at
90 million people a year the United Nations forecasts a stable
population of 10 billion about a hundred years from now.
   ``But this will not happen unless more of the world's women are
given more health care, family planning services, education and
employment opportunities,'' Mrs. Sadik told a news conference.
   Without such measures, she said, the world's population could
nearly triple to 14 billion by the year 2100, crippling development
and creating ``enormous potential for violence and social
upheaval.''
   Nations with fast-growing populations are spending more on
essentials and have little left for social programs, Mrs. Sadik
said. In the past four years, 37 of the world's poorest countries
have cut health spending by 50 percent and education spending by 25
percent, she said.
   About half the world's women live in rural areas and in
societies dominated by men and still don't have access to family
planning, she said.
   South Korea, Singapore and Thailand are economic successes
partly because strong family planning programs helped reduce high
rates of population growth, Mrs. Sadik said.
   ``We know from the World Fertility Survey that women would have
fewer children if they had access to family planning,'' she said.
   ``In Latin America, 75 percent of women not using family
planning say they want to postpone, delay or limit their
childbearing. In Asia, the figure is 43 percent and in Africa 27
percent.''
   To stabilize the world's population at 10 billion, population
growth must decline by one-third in the next 40 years, the report
says.
   Mrs. Sadik said the U.N. Population Fund set a goal of extending
family planning services to an additional 500 million women by the
year 2000 and raise the number of contraceptive users from 465
million today to 730 million.
   The fund, which has projects in 130 countries, urged governments
to earmark at least 1 percent of gross national product for family
planning.
   Mrs. Sadik also called for a great expansion in women's
education and literacy, an end to legal and social discrimination
against women and greater access to leadership positions for women.
   She said that even many educated men do not see a need for
equality and opportunity and that religious fundamentalism seems
``to be designed to somehow keep women in bondage.''
   Mrs. Sadik mentioned Pope John Paul II and Moslem
fundamentalists, but said, ``All religious movements look at the
woman as the one who should cater to and serve the family, never
the other gender.''

FT  07 JUL 93 / UN report calls for new policies on migration
</HEADLINE>

NEW policies are needed to cope with a rising tide of migration, both from
the country to the city and across national borders, according to a new
report from the United Nations Population Fund*.
The report warns that millions of migrants will create economic and social
strains in countries of immigration and emigration. Governments will have to
take new measures to reduce the pressure to migrate, such as improving
education, health care and family planning in rural areas, but must also
improve the capacity of urban areas to absorb new migrants.
'The only effective means of reducing migration pressure over the long term
are to slow population growth, stimulate economic growth and job creation at
home, and to promote the development of the individual and the family as the
basic economic and social unit,' the report says.
But government policies aimed specifically at limiting rural-urban migration
have generally been unsuccessful, the report says, because they have not
been linked to the country's overall trade, industrial and agricultural
policies, which exert a much stronger pressure on population movement than
regional strategies.
The report says that around 100m people, mostly in the developing world, are
now international migrants. The number of asylum seekers and refugees is
rising most rapidly, and may account for 20 per cent of the total.
Money sent back by migrant workers to their home countries may now total
Dollars 70bn a year, the report suggests - second in value only to the
international oil trade.
The global population, estimated at 5.57bn in 1993, is projected to rise to
6.25bn in the year 2000 and 10bn in 2050. While annual population growth is
estimated at 1.7 per cent worldwide, this conceals a wide disparity, with
Africa's growth rate at 3 per cent and Europe's at only 0.3 per cent.
Age structures are also diverging. In Africa, the number of people under 15
has tripled over the last 40 years, and the proportion has remained around
40 per cent; in Latin America the proportion of under 15s peaked in 1965-70
and has been falling rapidly ever since, while in east Asia the proportion
has dropped to 26 per cent.

   As far as Hispanics are concerned, ``the word minority is
becoming extinct in some parts of the country, although that may
not have hit the policy types yet,'' says Elvira Valenzuela Crocker
of the Mexican-American National Women's Organization.
   About two-thirds of the Hispanics in the United States live in
just three states. California leads with 34 percent, followed by
Texas at 21 percent and New York with 10 percent.
   Florida has 8 percent of the nation's Hispanics, and there are
significant populations in Illinois, New Jersey, Arizona, New
Mexico and Colorado, the Census Bureau reports.
   Latinos are younger, on average, than the rest of the
population. In 1980 their median age was 23, compared to 30 for
Americans in general.
   That means more are in the childbearing years and they are
producing a higher growth rate than the rest of the nation. In
1988, Hispanics averaged 94 births per 1,000 women ages 18 to 44,
compared to 67 per 1,000 for the rest of the country.
   That also means more young Latin Americans are in the nation's
schools, raising the issue of bilingual education in many cities.
   That as-yet-unresolved debate centers on whether it is better to
teach children in their own language while they learn English, or
to immerse them only in English as a means of improving their
skills in that language while they are learning other subjects as
well.
   Only about 44 percent of Hispanics age 25 and over have
completed high school, compared to nearly 70 percent of
non-Hispanics.
   Cary Davis, a researcher at the private Population Reference
Bureau, views the growing Hispanic population as a source of needed
labor in the coming years.
   ``When the baby boom starts to retire in 20 to 30 years, who
will provide the work force? It will be an increasingly minority
and Hispanic society,'' Davis says.
   ``The labor force is going to be very different in the next
couple of decades, with a need for improved literacy and employment
training to educate the work force,'' adds Navarrete. ``We see this
as a challenge for the United States, but also a very positve
thing.''
   ``We have to think through what kind of investment to make in a
group with lower levels of educational attainment, that doesn't
have a tradition of education,'' Davis says.
   And Davis cautions non-Hispanics against being ``overly
pessimistic'' about these changes.
   ``They will not be all newly arrived immigrants, there is an
assimilation process going on,'' he says.
   ``Hispanics will soon become the majority of entry-level workers
in some metropolitan areas,'' reported the Population Reference
Bureau in a 1988 analysis of the Hispanic population.
   However, limited educations and language skills have held down
incomes, with per-capita income in 1988 averaging $7,956 for
Hispanics, compared to $8,271 for blacks and $13,896 for whites.
   While many Hispanics are not citizens, the Constitution
specifies that the census count all residents of the country, not
just U.S. citizens. Thus, when census figures are used for
political reapportionment and distribution of federal and state
funds, areas with more people _ Hispanic and otherwise _ will be
the gainers.
   Their presence will mean added clout for areas where they live
following the 1990 census.
   Between 1974 and 1988 the number of Hispanic elected officials
in the country grew from 1,500 to 3,300, including 10 members of
the House of Representatives.
   William O'Hare of the Population Reference Bureau has speculated
that minorities, including Hispanics, could gain six to 10 more
House seats after the 1990 census.
   While Hispanics are not as likely to register as other
Americans, that gap has been narrowed by registration drives in
recent years.
   And when they do register they are as likely to vote as anyone
else.
   In 1988, officials estimate, 44 percent of voting-age Hispanics
were registered, compared to 54 percent of blacks and 60 percent of
whites.
   The census report estimated the total Hispanic population of the
United States at 20,076,000 as of March 1989, up from 19,431,000 a
year earlier.
   The largest segment is Mexicans at 12,567,000, followed by
people of Central and South American origin, 2,545,000; Puerto
Ricans, 2,328,000; and Cubans, 1,068,000. The balance were of
Spanish or other Hispanic origin.
   In addition to the challenges they pose, Davis points out that
the growing U.S. Hispanic community can form an important resource
in international business relationships in coming years.
   ``The notion of a smaller world tells us that as we look to
international trade we have a community of representatives who can
work in Central and South America and help establish linkages to
those countries,'' he says.

Suggests</HEAD>

   AIDS may force the growing populations of some
developing countries into decline decades after the first AIDS
virus infection, according to computer projections published today.
   But another study says that at the worst, AIDS could cut the
growth rate of a typical central African country in half.
   ``It's a disaster from any point of view,'' said John Bongaarts
of the Population Council in New York, who did the second study.
   Today's projections appear in the British journal Nature.
   They say that with low to moderate infection rates like those of
Kenya, Uganda or Zaire, population declines would not begin until
20 to 70 years after the AIDS virus invades a developing country,
even one with low growth rates.
   The researchers stressed that their projections are crude and
said too little is known about AIDS to make more realistic ones.
   ``It is clear that AIDS will have an impact on swelling
population growth rates, but by how much is too sensitive to things
we don't know about with sufficient certititude,'' said Robert May
of Princeton University, who did the study with Roy Anderson and
A.R. McLean of Imperial College in London.
   ``Any (firm) long-term projection about whether AIDS will or
will not bring about zero or even negative rates of growth in
Africa cannot be made.''
   In a telephone interview, May said the projections do not
pertain to the United States or any other developed country.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome in Africa is thought to
spread mainly through heterosexual contact, while most cases in the
United States stem from homosexual contact or needle sharing by
intravenous drug abusers.
   The researchers said they found potential for eventual
population decline under a range of plausible assumptions for such
factors as the fraction of infected people who will die from AIDS,
the fraction of infected women's babies who are born infected and
the length of time the virus lies dormant before causing AIDS.
   Projections are severely limited by lack of precise knowledge on
such points, May said.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control estimates that an
infected woman runs a 30 percent to 60 percent chance of giving
birth to an infected baby, and that 20 percent to 30 percent of
people infected with the virus develop AIDS within five years. The
CDC has no figure on the percentage of infected people who
eventually die from AIDS, a spokesman said.
   One series of projections in Nature assumed an initial 4 percent
growth rate like that of Kenya, where the population doubles about
every 16 years and residents have a normal life expectancy of 52
years.
   Assuming an eight-year dormant period for the virus, one
projection forecast eventual population decline if half or 30
percent of babies born to infected mothers are infected at birth.
   A second projection took the same basic assumptions, set the
infected-newborn rate at 50 percent, and found eventual population
decline if every infected person dies of AIDS.
   Bongaarts said his projections come out differently because he
divided the hypothetical population into groups of high, medium and
low risk for AIDS.
   He also said that ``very implausible estimates'' of the
prevalence of AIDS virus infection would be needed to project zero
population growth or population decline.
   His projections, in the worst case, find AIDS cutting the 3
percent growth rate typical of central African nations in half.
More likely is a reduction to 2 percent, he said.
   But even that implies a doubling of the death rate, leading to
an overwhelmed health care system and disrupted social structure,
he said.

   A government study of juveniles in youth
correctional facilities gives a grim picture of the home lives of
those youngsters who commit crimes before adulthood.
   The study found that nearly three out of four of the juveniles
come from broken homes and were under the influence of drugs or
alcohol when they committed their offense.
   The study by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice
Statistics also found that nearly 60 percent of the 18,226
juveniles in the long-term, state-operated institutions during 1987
had used drugs regularly, once a week or more for at least a month.
   Seventy-two percent of the boys and girls under 18 said they had
not grown up with both parents. About half of all the juveniles
surveyed said they had lived primarily with their mothers.
   The report was based on interviews with a nationally
representative sample of 2,621 residents of 50 youth correctional
institutions administered by 26 states.

   A new poll says 60 percent of Americans favor
financial assistance for family planning programs in developing
nations, regardless of whether abortion is legal in those countries.
   The poll by Louis Harris and Associates, which was done for the
Population Crisis Committee and the Planned Parenthood Federation
of America found 34 percent of those surveyed were opposed to such
aid.
   The Agency for International Development has recently halted
support from countries where abortion is part of family planning
programs. It has also halted funding to both the International
Planned Parenthood Federation and the United Nation's Population
Fund, contending that their policies promoted coercive abortion.
   The two independent population groups paid for the poll of 1,250
Americans in order to gauge the support for family planning in this
presidential election year. A poll of that size has a margin of
error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

how to motivate workers.
   Attending the Sept. 6-9 session in Orlando, Fla., were six top
UMTA officials _ including its chief, Alfred A. DelliBovi _ and 47
local mass transit officials from around the country. The officials
paid their own travel expenses.
   UMTA spokesman James Bynum on Friday called the trip ``a

<HEAD>Population Growth Still Outpaces Food Output in Sahel, Analyst Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's an area in West Africa two-thirds the size
of the United States, not counting Alaska. It's the Sahel, a region
the ``Green Revolution'' forgot and is not likely to remember.
   The land is poor, the people are poor, and there are too many of
them. The outlook is grim, says Agriculture Department economist
John Day.
   ``If the Sahel's population of 38 million keeps growing at its
annual rate of 2.8 percent, it will double in about 25 years,'' he
said. ``The land's carrying capacity _ its ability to provide food
and fiber for humans and animals without losing long-term
productivity _ has already been exceeded.''
   If current population trends continue, along with current farming
technologies, the population of the Sahel will exceed the land's
carrying capacity by about 30 million people by the turn of the
century, Day said.
   Collectively, he said, the eight countries that make up the Sahel
comprise the only region in the world where population growth has
outpaced increases in food production over the last 20 years.
   The countries are Senegal, Gambia, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina
Faso, Niger, Chad and Cape Verde.
   Only 4 percent of the region is arable, or fit for crops. The
balance is desert, 59 percent; permanent pasture, 26 percent; and
woodlands, 11 percent.
   Per capita food production declined about 1.6 percent annually
from 1962 to 1988 and is highly variable from year to year, Day
writes in the July issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   Gains in overall food output have come primarily from expanding
crop plantings into marginal lands and by cropping traditional farm
plots more intensively, he said. But the average yields of food
crops have dropped the past 20 years.
   As soil degradation develops, land is turned into desert. It is
this ``desertification'' process that has caused concerns in some
other parts of the world, not only in the Sahel.
   Day outlined some of the steps that he thinks could be taken if
the Sahel is to slow its downward spin and relieve some of the
region's dependence on imports and food aid.
   ``Even during 1986 and 1987, when weather was better and domestic
production was up, imports and food aid made up about 20 percent of
the region's food supply,'' he said.
   Economic policies have stunted farmers' incentives to adopt new
technology and have strongly affected production methods, Day said.
   For example, he said, Sahelian currencies are over-valued, which
makes imports relatively cheap and exports expensive. And that
encourages food imports and depresses farm prices. Urban wages are
artificially high, and cheap food policies hamper production.
   Large-scale irrigation systems hold little promise in the Sahel,
at least for the present, Day said. Eighty-five percent of the
region gets less than 24 inches of rainfall annually.
   The Green Revolution technology dramatically boosted crop
production in Asia, Latin America and other parts of Africa, but not
in the Sahel.
   Day said the Green Revolution's output growth was based largely
on gains from high-yielding crop varieties, which are mostly
effective when combined with ample water and chemical fertilizers.
   But water control, or irrigation, is largely absent in the Sahel.
Sahelian farmers have generally rejected the Green Revolution
approach because the high-yielding varieties rarely outperform
traditional crops there.
   ``Farmers have learned that applying fertilizers in semiarid
regions lacking water control is very risky, with a high probability
of economic loss,'' he said.
   Day said one of the questions is whether traditional production
techniques can be modified to boost productivity and meet the
Sahel's needs. Development specialists, he said, ``are not convinced
that a low-resource approach by itself can achieve these
objectives.''
   Basically, that would involve animal and human labor in cropping
systems that use manures and few purchased production ``inputs''
such as machines or fertilizer and other chemicals.
   Dryland farming techniques already used in India, Australia, the
United States and other countries could be adapted to the Sahel.
   ``Research shows that using moisture-conserving furrow-dikes and
chemical fertilizers, for example, could raise the Sahel's food
production and farm income 50 percent to 70 percent, and reduce soil
erosion by as much as 70 percent,'' Day said.
   ``Farming will always be risky in the Sahel,'' he said. ``But
more efforts to conserve soil and water could cut the risks.''
   Day said ``efforts to encourage voluntary population control are
important'' and could ``help bring the population into closer
balance with the land's carrying capacity.''
   Lester R. Brown, head of Worldwatch Institute, a private,
Washington-based research organization, has warned for many years of
desertification, the abuse of farmland and forests, and the need for
curbing population growth.
   ``Unfortunately, farmers alone cannot brighten the world's food
prospects,'' Brown said in his 1989 report, ``State of the World.''
``Without the help of national leaders and family planners in
slowing population growth, the hunger and malnutrition that has
already engulfed large parts of Africa and Latin America will deepen
and spread.''
   Brown added: ``Population stabilization is the only acceptable
goal in a world where growth in human numbers is leading to a
life-threatening deterioration of environmental systems.''

<HEAD>Commission Says Older Hispanics Suffer More, Get Less Help</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Elderly Hispanics suffer more financial
hardships and serious health problems than older Americans in
general but are less likely to benefit from Social Security and
private pensions, a private study shows.
   The Commission on Elderly People Living Alone said Wednesday its
study of America's 1 million older Hispanics shows they ``generally
are not sharing in the economic prosperity enjoyed by other elderly
Americans.''
   The commission, established in 1985 by the Commonwealth Fund
philanthropic foundation, said the problems confronting Hispanics in
later years ``reflect cumulative deficits throughout life.''
   For example, it said, 73 percent of elderly Hispanics received an
eighth-grade education or less and 39 percent speak only Spanish.
   ``These handicaps have consigned many elderly Hispanics
throughout their lifetimes to jobs that offered low pay and no
pension or health insurance benefits,'' the commission said.
``Despite having worked for most of their lives, many Hispanics find
themselves in old age without the means to maintain their
independence.''
   Higher levels of education and English fluency may help younger
Hispanics get better jobs and retirement benefits, but school-age
Hispanics have high dropout rates and ``many may already be on their
way to lives of low-paying jobs and poverty,'' the report said.
   Advocates for the elderly were to discuss the federal
commission's report at a hearing today of the House Select Committee
on Aging.
   The study, based on a national survey of 2,299 older Hispanics,
found 22 percent of elderly Hispanics live below the federal poverty
line, compared with 12 percent of all elderly Americans. Fifty-four
percent of older Hispanics report poor or fair health, compared with
35 percent of all elderly.
   Forty-eight percent of Hispanic elders are very satisfied with
their lives, compared with 64 percent of all elderly, the survey
found.
   Hispanics currently make up 3 percent of the U.S. elderly
population, but are the fastest-growing segment of the senior
population. Their ranks are expected to quadruple to 4 million by
the year 2020, when they will make up 8 percent of the elderly
population, the commission said.
   It attributed lower percentages of Social Security and private
pension beneficiaries among today's elderly Hispanics to the
immigration of some later in life and to their work in service,
unskilled and farm jobs with few benefits.
   Seventy-seven percent of elderly Hispanics receive Social
Security, compared with 92 percent of all elderly; 19 percent of
older Hispanics receive a pension, compared with 45 percent of all
elderly, the survey found.
   Because of their lower incomes, 30 percent of poor elderly
Hispanics receive benefits under Supplemental Security Income, a
government program providing minimum income to poor people who are
elderly, blind or disabled. Sixty-seven percent of poor older
Hispanics are eligible for the benefits, but many don't know they
qualify, the report said.
   Although the report found poverty and health problems throughout
the elderly Hispanic population, there were differences among
different ethnic categories.
   For example, because elderly Mexican-Americans were the most
likely to have been born in the United States and work there longer,
85 percent received Social Security benefits. But 74 percent of
Puerto Ricans living in the continental United States and 66 percent
of Cuban-Americans receive the benefits.
   Cuban-Americans were the best educated and had the lowest poverty
rate _ 35 percent _ compared with 42 percent for Puerto Ricans and
43 percent for Mexican-Americans.

   WASHINGTON -- The overall U.S. population became
significantly less white and Anglo-Saxon during the 1980s,
largely because of growth in the number of Hispanics and
Asians living in this country, according to the 1990 census.
   The proportion of U.S. residents identifying themselves as
white declined to 80.3% in 1990 from 83.1% in 1980. At the
same time, the proportion of Hispanics increased to 9% in
1990 from 6.4% in 1980. Roughly half of those who identified
themselves as Hispanic, the most rapidly growing minority
group, also identified themselves as white. Asians and
Pacific Islanders grew to 2.9% of the population from 1.5% 10
years ago.

<TEXT>
   In addition, blacks became a slightly larger segment of
the U.S. population, increasing to 12.1% in 1990 from 11.7%
in 1980, and Native Americans grew to 0.8% from 0.6%.
Although still an overwhelming majority in the U.S., whites
have shrunk as a proportion of the population from 90% in
1960.
   Among Hispanics, the largest group remains people of
Mexican origin, followed by Puerto Ricans and Cubans. But the
census numbers suggest that a sizable migration of Central
and South Americans is under way. Between 1980 and 1990, the
number of people identifying themselves as "other Hispanic,"
a group largely from Central and South America, increased by
two-thirds. They now represent 2% of the population.
   People of Chinese descent remain the largest element in
the growing U.S. population of Asians and Pacific Islanders,
followed by those of Philippine and Japanese origins. In
addition, the census found significant growth among certain
groups from Asia -- especially the Hmong, who are from
mountainous regions of Laos, and people from Bangladesh,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Emigres from Southeast Asia and the
Asian subcontinent have been arriving in significant numbers,
but they don't yet represent a large portion of the overall
population.
   Minority groups remain unevenly distributed around the
U.S., with Asians and Hispanics concentrated in the West,
blacks and Cuban-Americans concentrated in the South, and
Puerto Ricans concentrated in the Northeast. More recent
arrivals, however, appear to be dispersed less predictably.
According to Jesus Garcia, a census statistician, growth in
the "other Hispanic" category was evenly divided among the
Northeast, the South and the West, though it was slower in
the Midwest.
   In addition, people of Mexican, Cuban or Puerto Rican
origin are more widely dispersed than in the past. The number
of people of Puerto Rican origin living in Nevada and
Georgia, for example, more than doubled in the last decade.
   "When a group gets larger, it simply cannot concentrate
the way it used to," said Marty Riche, director of policy
studies for the nonprofit Population Reference Bureau.
   Among Asians, those of Hmong descent were most numerous in
California, Minnesota and Wisconsin, while those of Pakistani
descent were found principally in New York, California and
Illinois.

   There are now a quarter-billion Americans.
   This nation started life with just under 4 million people, about
as many as now live in metropolitan Boston.
   On Tuesday it reached 250,000,000, according to estimates by the
Census Bureau.
   A more detailed total will be calculated following the national
head count to be taken April 1.
   The 250 million estimate represents a 10.4 percent increase from
the 226.5 million Americans counted in 1980.
   The U.S. population reached 50 million in 1880, doubled to 100
million by 1915, was 150 million in 1949 and climbed to the 200
million mark in 1967.
   Projections done by the Census Bureau indicate that the nation
could reach 300 million within 30 years.
   Current population growth is estimated at one new person every
14 seconds in the United States. That is based on a birth every 8
seconds and a new immigrant arriving every 35 seconds, balanced by
a death every 14 seconds and a departure every 3 minutes.
   The United States ranks fourth in the world in population,
following China, at 1.1 billion; India, at 833 million, and the
Soviet Union, at 289 million.
   Following the United States are Indonesia, 188 million; Brazil,
151 million; Japan, 123 million; Nigeria, 115 million; Bangladesh,
115 million and Pakistan, 110 million.

<F P=106> [By Carmen Gonzalez Hernadez: "Research and Experience. The </F>
Cuban Population is Aging"]
  [Text] [no dateline as received] -- Local experts have said
a drop in the nation's fertility rate in which the number of
young people goes down raises the population's age and brings it
closer to the demographic patterns of the world's more developed
countries.
  Based on Cuban Statistical Research Institute projections
for
the next century, Cuba will have 11.504 million inhabitants,
with more women, by the start of the next millennium.
  "By the year 2020, approximately 28.9 percent of the
population will be 60 years old or older, thereby drawing closer
to Sweden's levels, for example, where the percentage of elderly
people was 22.8 percent in 1992," Dr. Raul Hernandez Castellon
told PRENSA LATINA.
  The head of the Cuban Center for Demographic Studies said
Cuba is one of the few countries in Latin America experiencing
an early demographic revolution process; a transition that began
its first phase during this century's first three decades.
  "From 1902 to 1928, the United States invested approximately
$1.5 billion in the island, generating a great migratory current
to meet the labor force needs," he indicated. According to
statistics from that time, approximately 750,000 Spaniards and
250,000 Haitians, Jamaicans, and Puerto Ricans entered the
country. This situation influenced the age and gender structure
because most of the immigrants were working-age, single men.
  At the same time, the high levels of urban development
reached and the relative progress in education, he said, were
factors that influenced the reproductive behavior of the Cuban
population. Studies indicated that the major characteristics
of the second phase of the demographic transition was the change
in the direction of the migratory movements, since the nation
had become a source of emigrants owing to contradictions in the
economy and other factors.
  Afterward, when the new government took over in 1959,
another
migratory movement of economic and political nature evolved.
  Later, the fertility rate dropped below the replacement
level
and, finally, a stunning increase in the life expectancy rate
occurred. That was when the first signs of aging began to appear.
  In making a detailed analysis of this phenomenon, Dr.
Hernandez Castellon indicated that, with few exceptions, the
Cuban population has maintained a rather low annual growth rate
compared to developing countries.
  Over a period as long as 62 years, between 1919 and 1981, he
added, the rate was 1.95 percent, although the population
increased approximately 6.8 million, as the census indicated.
  In fact, until 1950, the arrival of emigrants contributed to
a relatively high growth rate of 2.31 percent.
  Although the rate went from 2.8 children to 1.8 per woman
from 1919 to 1953, the migratory flow basically influenced the
age and gender structure.
  For that reason, there were more men than women from 1919 to
1981, but by 1990, statistics showed a balance with women had
been reached.
  "Regarding people younger than 15 years of age, Cuba is on
par with Europe's developed countries, with 22.8 percent in
1990," Dr. Hernandez Castellon noted.
  The profound socioeconomic changes in the country since 1959
have undoubtedly influenced the recent demographic evolution in
the island, the experts stated.
  "There was a noticeable increase in births in the early
1960's and the "baby boom" [preceding two words in English]
peaked in 1963, when the birth rate shot up to 35.1 births for
every 1,000 residents," the expert noted.
  The reason for that was, in addition to the couple's
economic
security and their confidence in the future, abortions were
restricted, and there were no contraceptives on the local market.
  The arrival of electricity to remote areas allowed the news
media to reach those places, which resulted in more education
for the residents.
  Family planning orientation was also extended throughout the
country; an aspect that was accompanied by making diverse
contraceptive means available to every woman. We must also
mention the legalization of abortion, which, though it may not
be regarded as a contraceptive, allows the couple to have the
children they want.
  "Another very important aspect regarding the aging of the
population is found in the life expectancy rate from birth. In
1950, it was 58 years and now is over 75 years," Dr. Hernandez
Castellon reiterated.
  This has been possible, he said, even though the infant
mortality rate has dropped every year, so that by 1993 it had
decreased to 9.4 for every 1,000 live births.

   The increasing demands of the world's population, now heading toward six billion, are damaging the basic natural resources on which all life depends, according to an annual United Nations report.

   The 1988 State of World Population Report, released Wednesday, said the Earth is gaining 80 million people a year, losing topsoil and tropical forests, and creating desert land.

   "The Earth is capable of supporting the increasing needs of the next century," but only if industrialized and developing countries cooperate effectively to reverse the environmental destruction, the report said.

   "All countries must face the fact that the combination of population and industrial growth could destroy the land, water and air on which everything else depends," said Dr. Nafis Sadik, a Pakistani physician who is executive director of the U.N. Population Fund.

   At a news conference, Dr. Sadik expressed hope that action by governments, individuals and international organizations to curb population growth and to encourage conservation and economic development will "safeguard the future of our planet."

   But "population and resources could become more seriously out of balance unless we do something about it today," she said.

   With the world's population now at more than five billion and expected to reach six billion in the next 12 years, the report said that "slower growth and more even distribution of population" would help take the pressure off agricultural land, forests, and water and energy sources.

   Every year, the report said, the world adds the equivalent of a nation the size of Mexico to the population -- about 80 million people.
Nearly all of this growth is in the developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America, which are least capable of absorbing it, the report said.

   Even though most developing countries are trying to reduce population growth, their needs are increasing and their attempts to find new land and increase food production are destroying the environment rapidly, the report said.

   Tropical forests are shrinking at a rate of 27 million acres a year, according to the report.
Topsoil is being lost at the rate of 26 billion tons a year.
About 13 million acres of deserts are being created each year, and about half the world's irrigated land is in danger.

   By the end of the century, half the world's population will be living in urban areas, and one-fifth of the urban population will live in "megacities" of four million or more, the report said.

   Dr. Sadik said industrialized countries must "lead the attack on the population problem" and develop safer technologies for industrial growth.

   In China, Indonesia, Mexico, Thailand and South Korea, she said, population growth has dropped significantly in the past decade, but growth rates remain high in many other countries.

   Last year, Dr. Sadik said, one promising development was that 10 countries in sub-Sahara Africa, which has the highest population growth rates in the world and is "overwhelmed by economic problems," adopted national population policies aimed at limiting growth.

<HEAD>Number of Hispanics Up By One-Third This Decade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of Hispanics has grown by more than
one-third since 1980 and now represents 8.1 percent of the nation's
population, the Census Bureau says.
   In a report issued Tuesday, the bureau also said the rate of
Hispanic growth is nearly five times that for the rest of the
population, and more than half of all Hispanics in this country
live in just two states: California and Texas.
   The bureau estimated there were 19.4 million Americans of
Hispanic background as of last March. That is 34 percent more than
the 14.5 million people who listed themselves as Hispanics in the
1980 census.
   The nation's non-Hispanic population increased by about 7
percent in the same period.
   About half the Hispanic increase was a result of immigration and
half resulted from birth rates exceeding death rates.
   While people of Spanish ancestry made up a growing share of the
nation's residents, they are extremely concentrated geographically,
the bureau found. About one-third, 33.9 percent, live in
California, and 21.3 percent live in Texas, meaning those two
states account for well over half of all Hispanics in the United
States.
   The study did not estimate the Hispanic population of every
state, but it said that nearly 90 percent live in just nine states.
   Those are California, 6.6 million; Texas, 4.1 million; New York,
2.1 million; Florida, 1.5 million; Illinois, 801,000; Arizona,
648,000; New Jersey, 646,000; New Mexico, 543,000, and Colorado,
368,000.
   Other findings of the report include:
   _The unemployment rate among Hispanics was 8.5 percent, compared
with 5.8 percent for non-Hispanics.
   _People of Mexican heritage were the largest Hispanic group at
12.1 million. They were followed by Puerto Ricans living on the
U.S. mainland, 2.5 million; Central and South Americans, 2.2
million; and Cubans, 1 million.
   _The proportion of Hispanic families anchored by a married
couple was 70 percent, down from 74 percent when it was last
measured in 1982. At the same time, the share of families headed by
a woman with no spouse present increased from 26 percent to 30
percent.
   _More than half (51 percent) of Hispanics have completed high
school, and 10 percent have completed four years of college. That
still trails non-Hispanics, of whom 78 percent are high school
graduates and 21 percent have finished college.

FT  18 AUG 94 / UN warns of world's creaking cradle: Annual population
report points to huge strains on resources
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's population is set to reach a staggering 10bn by the middle of
the next century, up from 5.7bn now, the United Nations warned yesterday.
The annual report from the UN's Population Fund (UNFPA), released yesterday,
says the projections assume that the average number of children born to each
woman will continue to fall, as it has done steadily for several decades
(see accompanying story).
If birth rates fall by more it expects the world's population may be as low
as 7.8bn people in 2050. If they stop falling, the total could reach 12.5bn.
The difference between the upper and lower projections - nearly 5bn people,
as much as the world's current population - has huge implications for
prosperity, migration and demand for natural resources. But in advance of a
UN conference in Cairo next month, controversy is mounting over how
countries can try to restrain population growth, or whether they should do
so at all.
Global figures conceal the diverging fortunes of different regions. Africa's
population growth of 2.9 per cent a year is the highest in the world, easily
outstripping Asian and Latin American growth of less than 2 per cent, the
report says. Although many developing countries have seen steady falls in
total fertility rates - the average number of children born to each woman -
they have also seen life expectancy soar in the past 40 years from 41 years
to 61 years, according to the UNFPA.
Industrialised countries can expect their share of the world's population to
shrink given their slow rates of population growth: about 1 per cent a year
in North America, 0.5 per cent a year in the former Soviet Union and 0.3 per
cent a year in western Europe. Meanwhile, their populations are ageing: the
UNFPA expects the proportion of people aged 65 and over in industrialised
countries to rise from the present 12.7 per cent to 18.4 per cent by 2025.
The report flags a long list of economic, social and environmental concerns
that follow from its projections. It warns that population growth will put
huge strains on the supply of natural resources such as forests, fish and
clean air.
It dismisses fears of an 'overall global shortage of food' of the kind much
voiced by 'Club of Rome' school of forecasters some 20 years ago, pointing
out that 'during the past 10 years, the world's food production has
increased by 24 per cent, outpacing the rate of population growth'.
But the report points out that the improvement in food production has been
unevenly distributed; in Africa during the past decade, food production fell
by 5 per cent while population rose by a third. The report concludes that
while production 'should be sufficient to meet all needs for the foreseeable
future . . . poverty translates global adequacy into national and local
shortages'.
Water, as much as food, may prove 'an increasing cause of friction' between
countries and regions, the UN suggests. Rapidly industrialising countries
such as China are facing intense demand for water supplies from industry as
well as from rural populations which are continuing to grow.
Developing countries should brace themselves for huge internal migration as
surplus rural labour travels to the towns to look for work, the UN warns.
The report estimates that 1.3bn will be added to the workforces of Asia,
Africa and Latin America between 1995 and 2020. It adds that cities are
likely to contain half the world's population by the end of the century.
For their part, developed countries need to consider how to respond to
rising pressure for immigration, particularly along Europe's and North
America's southern borders. The UN describes present levels of international
migration as 'hardly significant numerically - about a million people a year
 -compared with movement within countries toward urban areas'. But it warns
that such migration has 'a social and economic impact out of proportion to
its numbers'.

FT  07 SEP 94 / False alarm in Cairo: Women's education, not ideology, is
key to population control
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While doing voluntary service as a teenager in French-speaking Africa, I
shocked a Senegalese friend, a primary school teacher, by urging on him the
virtues of contraception. 'Faut pas empecher les gosses de naitre, wai],' he
expostulated: You mustn't stop kids being born. (Wai], an all-purpose
vernacular exclamation, added emphasis to his statement.)
A Moslem, though by no means a fundamentalist, my friend had unwittingly
given a succinct summary of Catholic doctrine. I had trouble with it then,
and I have trouble with it now. I've always thought the Catholic Church has
a better case on abortion than most liberals and feminists are willing to
allow: it hardly makes one an irrational fanatic to describe the deliberate
destruction of an embryo human being as the 'taking of human life'. But the
Church weakens its case enormously by pushing it back before conception. At
that stage there is no individual human life to be taken: only a myriad
potential combinations, almost all of which nature will rule out anyway. Nor
is it obvious that the methods of avoiding conception which the church
recommends are any more 'natural' than those it condemns.
At the Cairo conference on population and development, Vatican delegates are
struggling to remove 'pregnancy termination' from the list of things covered
by 'reproductive healthcare' in the UN draft document and to salvage a
phrase about 'taking appropriate steps to help women avoid abortion, which
in no case should be presented as a method of family planning'. Vatican
delegates have wisely avoided taking a stand on the contraception issue.
They are not helped by TV footage from the Philippines, where last month
Catholics, led by Cardinal Jaime Sin, demonstrated against the conference
and their government's family planning policy, with banners proclaiming:
'Contraception = abortion = murder.'
Similarly the conference's organisers must have been less than pleased with
newspaper headlines yesterday suggesting that Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, the
Norwegian prime minister, won a standing ovation by calling for abortion to
be legalised worldwide. They have taken pains to establish that this is not
the conference's agenda. Mrs Brundtland herself complained that the agenda
had been misrepresented, suggesting that the term 'reproductive healthcare'
could not 'possibly be read as promoting abortion as a means of family
planning'. But she clearly meant to take on the Vatican with two of her
statements: that 'morality becomes hypocrisy if it means mothers suffering
or dying in connection with unwanted pregnancies and illegal abortions and
unwanted children'; and that morality cannot 'only be a question of
controlling sexuality and protecting unborn life'.
It is a false quarrel about a false alarm. A false quarrel, because each
side is attacking the other for a position which, in this conference at
least, it is not attempting to defend. And a false alarm because the current
prospect for world population growth is less catastrophic than the headlines
suggest.
In an essay just published in the New York Review of Books, Prof Amartya
Sen, a leading expert on the economics of famine, reminds us that the rate
of world population growth has fallen in the last two decades from 2.2 to
1.7 per cent, and 'is expected to go steadily down until the size of the
world's population becomes nearly stationary'.
The number at which it will eventually stabilise, around 10bn, still sounds
alarmingly high. It is, but not - as many imagine - because most of those
people will be hungry and poor: per capita incomes are rising and food is
getting cheaper in those parts of the world where most of them are being
born. The danger is the opposite: sooner or later most of them will be able
to afford western lifestyles and consumption patterns, putting an
unsustainable strain on the world environment.
That problem will not be solved by population control alone, but anything we
can do to accelerate the fall in the birth rate should help to make it more
manageable. But Prof Sen makes a strong case that coercive or 'override'
methods - those in which 'the family's personal decisions are overridden by
some agency outside the family' - are unnecessary and perhaps ineffective,
as well as being inhumane. The fall in China's birth rate since 1979 may, he
suggests, be due less to the authoritarian one-child policy than to 'more
collaborative and participatory' policies which have made education and jobs
outside the home available to many Chinese women. The Indian state of
Kerala, with 29m people, has reduced its birth and fertility rates below
those of China without any state coercion. It is among the poorer Indian
states (so economic growth is not in itself the solution, as is sometimes
argued), but it resembles China in having 'high levels of basic education,
healthcare and so on'. Most strikingly, it has higher rural literacy rates,
male and female, than any Chinese province.
China and Kerala have the advantage of being neither Moslem nor Catholic.
But the birth rate is also falling rapidly in Iran (where there is good
basic healthcare, and the authorities came round to family planning in 1988)
and in most of South America. The Tablet, the British Catholic magazine,
even claimed last month, with a certain chutzpah, that because it favours
women's education 'the Catholic Church should be regarded as one of the most
effective organisations in the world for reducing the rate of population
growth'. In other words, the Pope should be congratulated for educating his
female followers to the point where they can ignore his advice.

<HEAD>Report: If Planet Is To Survive, Humans Must Stop Plundering Its
Resources</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The earth will only be able to support its
population in the coming century if all countries cooperate to
reverse environmental destruction and control population growth, an
annual U.N. report said.
   The 1988 State of World Population Report, released in London on
Wednesday, says increasing human demands and population are
damaging the natural resources on which all life depends.
   The report says world population, now at more than 5 billion, is
expected to reach 6.1 billion by the year 2000.
   ``All countries must face the fact that the combination of
population and industrial growth could destroy the land, water and
air on which everything else depends,'' Dr. Nafis Sadik, executive
director of the United Nations Population Fund, told a news
conference.
   The Pakistani physician expressed hope that action by
governments, individuals and international organizations to curb
population growth and encourage conservation will ``safeguard the
future of our planet.''
   But ``population and resources could become more seriously out
of balance unless we do something about it today,'' she said.
   Every year, the world adds a nation the size of Mexico to the
population _ about 80 million people _ with nearly all the growth
occurring in developing countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America
that are least able to absorb it, the report says.
   It says that though most developing countries are trying to
reduce population growth, their needs are increasing and their
attempts to find new land and increase food production are
destroying the environment rapidly.
   ``There is urgent need for action ... In the poorest areas, the
`scissors effect' of poverty and increasing population is slicing
away at their ability to sustain human life.''
   The report encourages slower growth and more even distribution
of population to take pressure off agricultural land, forests and
water and energy sources.
   Tropical forests are shrinking at a rate of 27 million acres a
year. Topsoil is being lost at the rate of 26 billion tons a year.
About 13 million acres of deserts are being created each year and
about half the world's irrigated land is in danger, it says.
   By the end of the century, half the world will be living in
urban areas and one-fifth of the urban population will live in
``mega-cities'' of 4 million or more, the report says.
   It says population growth will not stop ``for perhaps another
century, when world population may be over 10 billion, twice its
present level.
   ``Part of this dramatic rise in numbers is the result of
widespread improvements in basic health care which have contributed
to lower infant mortality ... and longer life spans. But the very
success of these interventions now threatens the future.''

<LEADPARA>  Declaring earlier projections too optimistic, the United Nations Population
Fund said Monday the number of people in the world will more than double -- to
11.6 billion -- before stabilizing sometime in the 22nd century.;    The fund
had projected two years ago that population would stabilize at around 10.2
billion by about 2085.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  POPULATION GROWING FASTER THAN THOUGHT
U.N. AGENCY SEES 10 BILLION IN WORLD BY THE
YEAR 2050  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The current "most likely" projection calls for a population of 10 billion
in 2050 with continued growth for an additional 100 years, leveling off at
11.6 billion, the organization said in a "State of World Population" report.;
  The largest growth will be in some of the world's most densely populated
areas. South Asia, where millions are threatened by sickness, hunger and
exposure following an April 30 cyclone in Bangladesh, will grow by 300 million
between now and the end of this century, the U.N. organization said.;    And
the population of Africa, which currently is in the grips of an AIDS pandemic,
will be growing faster in 2000 than today's world average -- even if the
worst-case death rate from AIDS develops.;    The world's population is
expected to pass 5.4 billion sometime this year.;    Higher levels;  "By 2001,
the total will be 6.4 billion," the fund reported. "As for eventual totals,
recent work by the U.N. population division suggests that population growth
will stop much later and at much higher levels than previously thought.;
"Instead of a stable total of about 10.2 billion in 2085 . . . population may
eventually level off at about 11.6 billion.";    The "most likely" growth
projection assumes that the amount currently being spent on contraceptives and
family planning services will double to $9 billion a year by 2000 and that the
number of couples in developing countries who use contraceptives will increase
from 381 million to 567 million.;    "Without dramatic increases in funds for
family planning, there is no possibility of stabilizing world population at
moderate levels," said Dr. Nafis Sadik, a Pakistani physician who heads the
Population Fund.;    "Right now, we are simply running to stay in place," she
added.;    If family planning were universally available and widespread use
achieved within this decade, the planet's population would stabilize at about
9 billion sometime in the next century, the fund said.;    Under a projection
that assumes slower growth in family planning and contraception, the
population would exceed 14 billion before finally stabilizing, the fund said.;
   Affordable prevention;  "The fact that the projections are being revised
upward is the bad news," said Sharon Camp, vice president of the
Washington-based Population Crisis Committee. "The good news is we know what
we have to do and it's entirely affordable.";    The $9 billion annual price
tag for achieving population stability at 11.6 billion includes assistance
provided by governments of developing countries, aid from the developed world
and money spent by individual users of family planning services.;    Camp said
the Bush administration "shows no sign of being at all seized with the world
population problem or having any concern about family planning.";    She said
a 335-page White House proposal for a new foreign aid authorization bill
contained only 55 lines on family "and 38 of those lines were devoted to
restrictions" on how funds could be spent.  </TEXT>

POPE GOES BARNSTORMING WITH BIRTH CONTROL PLEA;

MEXICO: HE DELIVERS HIS MESSAGE IN A COUNTRY WHOSE GOVERNMENT ACTIVELY SEEKS TO
LIMIT POPULATION GROWTH.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A tireless Pope John Paul II barnstormed through bruising heat and buoying
crowds in the Mexican north Thursday to deliver an uncompromising message
against artificial birth control to a nation whose government aggressively
seeks to limit population growth.
</P>
<P>
John Paul spent three hours in Chihuahua, enough time for 600 new babies to be
born in Mexico where the population, now around 83 million, has grown by about
16 million since the Pope's first Mexican visit in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Pilgrims from El Paso, Tex., 225 miles to the north, joined hundreds of
thousands of festive Mexicans at a wind-whipped outdoor service in a dusty
field here in Chihuahua, an agricultural and mining state of copper-colored
hills, endless blue sky and wide-brimmed cowboy hats beneath an unblinking
summer sun.
</P>
<P>
An afternoon Mass in a dry riverbed at industrial Monterrey took John Paul to
within 100 miles of Laredo, Tex., his closest stop to the United States on an
eight-day Mexican pilgrimage that ends Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Once again Thursday -- Mother's Day in Mexico -- huge friendly crowds stalked
John Paul's every step through a day that began early in Durango and ended late
in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
In a modern society scarred by "violence, abortion, euthanasia, the
marginalization of the disabled and the poor," John Paul said, it is the woman
who "is called to keep alive the spark of life, the respect for the mystery of
all new life."
</P>
<P>
Terming Catholic marriage a "demanding reality," the Pope said that Roman
Catholic couples must always be open "to the gift of life."
</P>
<P>
"You must keep in mind that if the possibility of conceiving a child is
artificially eliminated in a marriage, the couple is shutting itself off from
God and opposing his will," the Pope said in reiterating the church's unbending
opposition to artificial birth control.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore," he said, "the husband and wife close themselves off from each
other because they reject the mutual gift of fatherhood and motherhood,
reducing the conjugal union to an opportunity to satisfy each other's egotism."
</P>
<P>
The church-state split over population policies in Mexico is a variation on a
theme that courses through all countries of Catholic Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The church, whose teaching allows only natural methods of family planning, is
at odds with a Mexican government whose development efforts are compromised by
a mushrooming population. There will be 100 million Mexicans by century's end
in a nation struggling to lift living standards for a people whose average
annual income is now only around $2,000.
</P>
<P>
Government birth control programs, criticized by Catholic groups, include
television ads urging couples to limit themselves to two children.
</P>
<P>
The programs have helped to reduce the population growth rate to 2.4% a year.
Even that, though, means about 2 million births per year and -- with about 40%
of Mexicans under age 15 -- a doubling of the population in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
About 96% of Mexicans are professed Roman Catholics, but 48% of Mexican women
now use contraception, according to International Planned Parenthood. In the
United States, about 85% of Catholic couples ignore the church teachings on
birth control that the Pope reaffirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Telling Chihuahua worshipers that the health of a society depends on the health
of its families, John Paul urged greater respect for the rights of children,
including the unborn.
</P>
<P>
"Society is more sensitive every day to the rights of the child," the Pope
said. But he warned that any child is nevertheless still a potential victim of
a long list of ills, including "the evil of a part of society that makes
attempts on his life even before birth through the practice of abortion."
</P>
<P>
Today, the Pope travels to extreme southern Mexico for visits to Chiapas and
Tabasco states, where he is expected to address refugee issues.

<TEXT>
   The head of an 82-nation
conference on population growth said Sunday that fighting
illiteracy among women is key to slowing a birthrate that could
more than double the world's inhabitants in 100 years.
   The U.N. Population Fund, sponsoring the conference that begins
Monday, will seek agreement on eradicating illiteracy among women
by the year 2000 and improving the availability of contraceptives,
conference sources said.
   The gathering opens the same day the U.S. House of
Representatives debates a $15 million proposal to resume funding to
the U.N. agency. The money was cut off in 1985 over an
agency-supported Chinese birth control policy.
   Nafis Sadik, the U.N. agency's Pakistani executive director,
told reporters the aim of the four-day forum is to thrash out a
list of ``recommendations'' that governments can use as targets in
their own population control programs.
   Those would include figures on bringing down infant and maternal
mortality rates and improving women's education, seen as a key
factor in determining their willingness to accept family planning.
   ``Attitude changes seem to take place ... where education levels
are higher, particularly (among) women and girls,'' she said.
``Women don't want to have so many children (but) they do because
that's what's expected of them.'' Demographers say the world's
population is 5.2 billion and increases by 90 million a year. If
nothing is done to slow the rate, the globe could contain 14
billion people by the year 2090.
   Under the U.N. agency's goals, all school-age girls should be
enrolled in some form of education by the year 2000, said a
conference source speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The source added that the U.N. agency was pressing for agreement
on making contraceptives available to at least 56 percent of the
world's women by the year 2000. The figure today is 45 percent.
   On the U.S. funding issue, Ms. Sadik said ``the first priority
to us is to get the U.S. back in the consensus'' on family
planning, rather than arguing for a bigger sum.
   Washington withdrew its $36 million funding of the agency in
1985 because of allegtions that an agency program in China included
forced sterilizations and abortions.
   The Senate has already earmarked $15 million for the resumption
of the U.S. contribution, but President Bush has said he would use
his veto if the measure is approved by the House.
   ``They (the U.S. government) don't really have any viewpoint on
the Chinese population program,'' Ms. Sadik said. ``The U.S.
decision has somehow got linked to the abortion issue in the United
States.''

<TEXT>
Slower population growth will not be enough to solve the problem of poverty
in developing nations, the World Bank says in a report prepared for next
week's United Nations population conference in Cairo, writes George Graham
in Washington.
Although slowing down the rate of population growth should still be a high
priority for developing countries, the report says, a broader programme
involving investment in education, health and nutrition will be needed to
address poverty.
'We need to combine reproductive health and family planning with better
infant and child health, education of girls and overall improvement in the
status of women,' said Mr Armeane Choksi, the bank's vice-president for
human resource development and operations policy. The bank expects world
population to grow over the next 35 years to around 8.5bn, with almost 90
per cent of the rise occurring in developing countries.

   China's Iron-Fisted Population Control

<LP>
   In September 1987, an expectant Chinese couple temporarily
residing in the U.S. received a note from a factory back home
where the wife worked. It wasn't a baby shower invitation.
   The Walfantia Bearing Factory warned the couple that their
pregnancy was unauthorized and that everyone from "the
factory director . . . to the cadres in charge of the birth
control program" would be punished if the baby was born.
Because the "consequences for you are unthinkable," the
factory authorities ominously warned, "you should . . . fix
your problem any way you can. You must not delay] If you have
real difficulties, return to China immediately for an
abortion. . . ."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This international direct-mail program is just one of the
dark aspects of the Chinese Communist Party's ferocious
population-control effort, and just one of the grim details
John Aird, the Census Bureau's former authority on China,
provides in "Slaughter of the Innocents" (The American
Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, 191 pages,
$16.95).
   Far from being a blessed event, nearly every birth in
China is viewed with a jaundiced eye because it might violate
the population policy, which evolved during some 30 years
after Mao Tse-tung broke with traditionally optimistic
Marxist thinking on large populations.
   "It is a very good thing that China has a big population,"
Mao wrote in 1949. "Of all the things in the world, people
are the most precious." But as the utopian vision of a
communist Promised Land faded away, Mao was less prepared to
let a thousand flowers bloom. By 1955 he was warning that
unfettered population growth could lead to the "extinction"
of the Chinese race.
   Thus he set in motion a program to help the Chinese
overcome their "feudal mentality" and "conservative tendency"
toward large families and adopt "birth plans." Yet even under
Mao's iron fist, birth-control efforts in China during the
1950s and 1960s were fairly mild.
   Then in the 1970s a new anti-natalist campaign required
local authorities to make planned parenthood and birth
control part of the "class struggle." Opponents became (and
today remain) "class enemies," Mr. Aird writes, and Beijing's
birth directives grew increasingly more draconian. In 1979,
with China's population taking a great leap forward, the
authorities explicitly defined the state's interest: zero
population growth by the year 2000.
   Mr. Aird convincingly shows that China's government has
been willing to do just about anything to reach that goal,
justifying their efforts with the neo-Malthusian idea that
people inhibit economic growth. That Hong Kong supports a
vastly denser population is clearly of no interest to
functionaries pursuing an economic system that is in fact
directly responsible for China's woes. "Whether we can
strictly control population growth," Mr. Aird quotes the
People's Daily, "will directly determine whether we can
smoothly achieve our economic development objectives." And so
the Forbidden City's geriatric potentates prohibit "early
marriages, early births" and decree forced sterilization and
compulsory abortion. "Use whatever means you must," Deng
Xiaoping urged in 1981, "but do it."
   Far from stopping at huge fines and cutting off a family's
water and electricity supply for begetting an unauthorized
child, the Communist Party has outlawed removing an
intrauterine device. And while pregnant Chinese nationals
living abroad receive letters urging abortions, women on the
home front are treated to "study classes" and
"heart-to-heart" talks during which birth control cadres
press them into an abortion, followed by IUD insertion or
sterilization.
   Doctors now storm through villages on abortion and
sterilization raids. To preserve the "happy peace" that
state-sponsored birth-control efforts bring to the people,
Mr. Aird writes, China has even "destroyed infants by
injections of alcohol into the fontanel" and by stuffing
gauze into their mouths.
   The population control lobby will no doubt condemn
"Slaughter of the Innocents" not only for the beam it shines
on China's program, but also because Mr. Aird attacks this
group in the book's opening chapter. Even as Chinese
authorities committed mass infanticide, the United Nations
Population Fund enthusiastically bestowed awards and money on
a program it averred was "totally voluntary." Others less
sanguine about China's zealous quest merely call the program
"aggressive" or "rigorous."
   But as recently as last year, China permitted the
publication of articles demanding coercive sterilization and
compulsory abortion for all women under 24, all second
pregnancies spaced less than five years after the first and
all third pregnancies.
   John Aird deserves acclaim not only for his painstaking
academic research on a difficult subject, but also for
dispassionately exposing China's brutal methods. The question
is whether the population control movement that has
championed China's model will learn something from it.

LINKING AID TO POPULATION GROWTH

<TEXT>
<P>
Rep. Anthony Beilenson's (D-Los Angeles) article on foreign aid and population
growth (Commentary, July 23) was excellent. Mankind's slow response to the
ever-more-serious growth of our population is leading us to disaster.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government must do more to assist anyone in the world who wants access
to family planning. The dehumanizing poverty and declining standard of living
for hundreds of millions of people in less-developed countries are reasons
enough to do so.
</P>
<P>
But help must be given for our own sake as well. The Dominican and Mexican
population explosions illustrate why. The United States has been flooded with
millions of poor, uneducated Dominicans and Mexicans, who have fled their
countries and who now contribute to the overcrowding of our cities,
particularly New York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
The Third World population explosion is everybody's problem. We must insist
that our government take a more active role to solve it.

FT  14 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Politics of population
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After 10 days in the Cairo heat, the United Nations conference on population
and development has produced a remarkable document. More than 150 countries
of widely differing cultures and religions have given their support to a
20-year plan aimed at curbing the world's population growth.
The programme, which urges countries to give universal access to family
planning and reproductive healthcare, may cost an estimated Dollars 17bn a
year by the end of the decade. But the more ambitious element of the
document is its statement that individuals, particularly women, have the
right to control the number and timing of their children. It urges that
women's status worldwide should be enhanced to give them the education and
freedom to make those choices. In a radical departure from previous UN
conferences, it sees a broad agenda of social development, of which
contraception is just one part, as the best way to tackle population growth.
Watching governments wrestle to agree on some of the most tortuous language
in the UN lexicon, there is reason to ask whether the exercise was
worthwhile. The policy statement is not binding, and critics have asked
whether the 'reproductive rights' it bestows on every person have any
meaning, given that there is no arena in which they can be enforced.
Moreover, in many countries which gave their support to the text, people
enjoy only limited political and legal rights.
However, there is cause for hope that governments will embrace much of the
Cairo text. As the population 'clock' in the conference hall's centre
reminded them, by registering more than one birth a second, it is in their
own interest to help people limit the size of their families.
There are also strong arguments that Cairo was right to persist with the
more ambitious parts of its agenda. The final document is, like the UN's
statement of human rights, an attempt to draw a common thread of agreement
between states of widely differing cultures. Mrs Nafis Sadik, director of
the UN population fund, who chaired the conference, deserves credit for her
determination to spin that thread through one of the most sensitive areas of
politics and human relationships.
The price of such agreements is hypocrisy: governments may well have signed
something they have no intention of enforcing. One delegate from western
Europe commented that, in ignoring the reality of countries' records on
family planning, 'it's been like ignoring an elephant in your bedroom'. But
the Cairo agreement at least provides a standard against which their actions
can be judged.
That agreement might have been still broader, or reached more quickly,
without the Vatican. In focusing on abortion - although the text mentions
the issue only as a threat to women's health - it stalled days of debate,
and may also have damaged public support for the Cairo policies. The Vatican
attended Cairo because of its status as permanent observer at the UN. But
its role appeared anomalous, as the only religion represented, and as the
only state with a birth rate of zero.
In the forthcoming UN conferences on social development and on women,
governments should consider how far they want to accommodate Rome in the
formidable but worthwhile task of reaching consensus on these highly
contentious questions.
