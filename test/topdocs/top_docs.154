THE ARABIAN NIGHTS: A COMPANION
by Robert Irwin
Allen Lane Penguin Press Pounds 20, 344 pages
As I read Robert Irwin's book I became more and more painfully aware of my
ignorance of the whole fascinating corpus of stories that goes under the
title of The Arabian Nights. (Literal translation, 'One Thousand Nights and
a Night'). To rely upon one's few childhood memories of the stories of
Aladdin, Ali Baba and Sinbad the Sailor (heavily bowdlerised, it emerges) is
like thinking you know the Bible because you know about Moses in the
bullrushes, David's conquest of Goliath and other biblical tales re-told for
children.
We tend to regard the Nights as a collection of Arab fairy tales. Irwin, a
novelist and former university teacher, points out that the material
'includes long heroic epics, wisdom literature, fables, cosmological
fantasy, pornography, scatological jokes, mystical devotional tales,
chronicles of low life, rhetorical debates, and masses of poetry. A few
tales are hundreds of pages long; others amount to no more than a short
paragraph.'
The Nights represent texts crucial to Western as well as Middle Eastern
culture; but like the Bible and the works of Homer their authenticity,
chronology, transmission and translation are all matters on which experts
disagree. We do not know who the original authors were; we do not have
complete primary texts from which to work and we English speakers do not
even have a reliable translation of the whole collection, an authorised
version.
The earliest manuscript dates from the ninth century and is in the
Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris. The Victorian period saw a number of
translations into both French and English. The most enlightening part of
Irwin's book is the chapter where he deals with these.
The version by Edward Lane, a lithographer, who worked in Cairo, appeared
from 1838 to 1841, and gave the tales a wide currency in England. Lane was
highly praised by Leigh Hunt; soon Tennyson, Browning and other Victorian
writers were reading the tales. After that few imaginative writers escaped
their influence in some form. Somerset Maugham read the Nights avidly when
he was a schoolboy in his uncle's rectory in Kent where they were the only
fiction on offer; and RL Stevenson wrote a linked series of fresh tales he
called The New Arabian Nights.
Lane's Nights were superseded in 1876-77 by the much fuller version made by
John Payne for the Villon Society containing the scurrilous material that
Lane, a clergyman's son, had left out. Then Sir Richard Burton, the
explorer, who had been consul in Damascus and had published an account of
his Pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, approached Payne apparently to
collaborate with him but went on to produce his own version. Irwin shows the
lengths that Burton went to try to disguise how greatly his version was
indebted to Payne's.
There had been versions in French of Les Milles et une nuits since the 18th
century. In 1704 Antoine Galland, an Arabic interpreter and museum curator,
made a version. The odd thing about this was that it appeared to contain
tales that are not in the extant manuscripts and no one is quite sure where
Galland got them from.
At the turn of the century Andre Gide, enamoured of all things Arabic,
poured scorn on Galland's version in order to promote a new version by a
friend of his - a Dr Madrus who hailed from the Caucusus but who was born in
Cairo and had a career in France in medicine. Acclaimed when it appeared,
the Madrus version reads now like a typical art nouveau product containing
'a fantasy Orient, compounded of Opium reveries, jewelled dissipation, lost
paradises, melancholy opulence and odalisques pining in gilded cages'.
Madrus claimed to be translating from a 17th century North African
manuscript. In fact no such manuscript existed but the lie enabled Madrus to
put in embellishments and new stories of his own. This version was
translated from French into English by Powys Mathers in 1923. As recently as
1986 it was being marketed in paperback as 'the only complete and accurate
version' in English.
In 1990 an English version appeared by Husain Haddaway which Irwin
thoroughly recommends for accuracy and readability. But this was taken from
a Calcutta manuscript containing only 271 nights. A wider selection is to be
found in the 1973 version for Penguin by NJ Dawood.
Fortunately much of the charm and the compulsiveness survives in whatever
version one happens to have to hand. The framing device of the whole series
whereby the life of the narrator - the Vizier's beautiful daughter
Sheherazade - hangs on her ability to sustain the curiosity of her
tyrannical audience of one - King Shahiyar - is a timeless metaphor of
authorship. It replicates throughout as characters within stories tell
stories about characters who tell stories upon which their lives depend.
If this was a valid notion a long time ago in the Middle East, Vladimir
Propp the Russian folklorist analysed its continuing validity in his
Morfologia Skazi in 1928, and there have been many subsequent attempts to
codify the tales. Meanwhile contemporary creative writers like John Barth in
his Chimera in 1973 and Salman Rushdie in his Haroun and the Sea of Stories
in 1990 showed how the infinitely proliferating story can be resuscitated
today. It will last as long as their are tales to be told and people to
listen to them. Robert Irwin makes us aware of the strength of this
narrative tradition in a fine, elegant, learned book.

THE ARABIAN NIGHTS
by Brian Alderson,
illustrated by Michael Foreman
Victor Gollancz Pounds 14.99, 192 pages
IT COULD be argued that the book known as The Arabian Nights, that
fascinating oriental patchwork of tales, jests and moral instances, is as
much a fabrication of the 18th century as Percy's Reliques or any of those
other attempts that were made during that century of so-called Enlightenment
to 'rescue from oblivion' collections of old ballads and the like.
In fact, the primary source for what came to be known as The Arabian Nights
was Antoine Galland's French translation of 1704, which led very quickly to
an English version. Galland had consulted a range of Arabian manuscripts but
these sources did not include versions of some of the most famous tales in
the collection, Aladdin and Ali Baba.
According to Brian Alderson, the historian of children's literature who has
produced this splendid new edition of the book, Galland heard these tales
from the mouth of a Maronite storyteller who happened to be wandering the
streets of Europe.
The fictional narrator Sheherazade was, of course, a woman of quite
awe-inspiring stamina when it came to telling stories - such are the lengths
to which a human being is prepared to go when threatened with decapitation -
and Alderson's offering of a mere 192 pages is less than 10 per cent of what
the most complete version might be. Earlier abridged editions of The Arabian
Nights often have left her out altogether because of the delays that must
occur inevitably when morning comes and the tale-telling is interrupted; but
the truth is that her presence is an enriching element, making certain tales
more poignant or more suspenseful.
What Alderson has sought to do in his rendering of the book is to re-create
the sense of exoticism that the idea of The Arabian Nights evokes in the
reader. So, he has resorted in his prose to what he himself describes
accurately as a 'richly upholstered Victorian' style, which serves his
purpose well. Not being an Arabic scholar, he has leant heavily upon both
Sir Richard Burton's great 16-volume Nights and Supplemental Nights of
1885-1888, so beloved of Somerset Maugham, and John Payne's translation,
also of the 19th century.
What is perhaps most interesting about The Arabian Nights is the extent to
which so many of the tales, fables and moral instances have found their way
into European folklore and fable. Motifs appear that find a parallel in
Grimm or Andersen. On one occasion - the delightful tale of a faithful
parrot that is embedded in a larger sequence entitled 'The Fisherman and the
Jinni' - the story finds an echo, according to Alderson, in a similar
anecdote recorded in England as late as 1914 when a parrot was called a liar
because it 'talked about the day it rained beans and bacon after the cook
had thrown the dinner at it.'
This is the oral tradition at work again, burrowing underground like a
colony of moles, moving in many directions at once. And no one is quite sure
where they will appear next.

<P>
A federal appeals court today dismissed Las Vegas singer Wayne Newton's
$5-million libel judgment against NBC, ruling that the evidence failed to show
malice toward Newton.
</P>
<P>
The original $19-million jury verdict was the largest libel award in American
history.
</P>
<P>
Three NBC stories in 1980 and 1981 claimed Newton had financed his 1980
purchase of the Aladdin Hotel with mob money and that organized crime figures
were the hidden ownership behind the resort.
</P>
<P>
A Las Vegas jury found National Broadcasting Company Inc. guilty of defaming
Newton in the broadcasts and awarded him $19 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
The trial judge in February, 1989, reduced the amount to $5.2 million.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals today unanimously ruled in a 50-page
opinion, "Our review of the uncontroverted testimony, together with the
cumulation of the circumstantial and documentary evidence, reveals almost no
evidence of actual malice, much less clear and convincing proof."
</P>
<P>
Newton's lawyers had argued at the time of the trial that the network had a
"total absence of institutional conscience." The Newton lawyers said the
stories were designed to curry favor with "Tonight Show" host Johnny Carson.
</P>
<P>
Carson lost out to Newton in a bid to buy the Aladdin Hotel and Casino in Las
Vegas in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Testimony indicated that the $85-million Aladdin purchase was funded by the
Valley Bank of Nevada.
</P>
<P>
Sued along with NBC were journalists Brian Ross and Ira Silverman, who were
involved in the story.
</P>
<P>
NBC attorney Floyd Abrams said during the trial that Newton created his own
problems by turning to crime figures Guido Penosi and Frank Piccolo for help in
halting death threats against his family.
</P>
<P>
Newton argued that NBC showed malice by publishing statements that Piccolo was
a hidden partner in Aladdin despite having Nevada Gaming Board testimony that
Valley Bank financed the purchase.
</P>
<P>
The appeal court noted that testimony also showed that hidden interest in a
casino is normally not actual ownership of a hotel but an interest in the
"skim, the amount of casino receipts not reported to the appropriate
authorities as receipts."

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Thursday
overturned Wayne Newton's record $5.2 million libel judgment and
dismissed his lawsuit over an NBC broadcast that suggested ties to
the mob.
   A jury in Las Vegas found that the television network's October
1980 story created a false impression that the Mafia had helped the
singer buy the Aladdin Hotel-Casino in exchange for a hidden share
and that Newton had deceived Nevada gaming officials.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did not say whether the
story as a whole was false but said any false impressions were not
the result of the kind of journalistic misconduct required for
libel suits by public figures.
   Under U.S. Supreme Court standards, public figures must prove
that defamatory statements were either deliberate falsehoods or
reckless, made in disregard of the truth. The court said the
evidence failed to support the jury's finding that the NBC
broadcast met that standard.
   The 3-0 ruling said most of the broadcast's factual statements
were true: Newton had a friend with purported mob ties who had done
him a favor, and had then talked with an associate about the
possibility of profiting from Newton's ownership of the Aladdin; a
federal grand jury had investigated that subject, and Newton had
testified falsely to the Nevada Gaming Board.
   Although the broadcast did not specify the favor that had been
done for Newton _ according to Newton, getting a criminal
organization to stop threatening him and his daughter _ the court
said the omission was not libelous. The reporters had reason to
doubt the story of the threats, which had been denied by Newton's
lawyer in Newton's presence, the court said.
   The jury awarded Newton $19.3 million. U.S. District Judge Myron
Crocker reduced the damages to $5.2 million, mostly in punitive
damages, after finding that Newton's income and reputation had not
suffered; it was still the largest libel judgment up to that time.
   Among the reasons NBC gave for challenging the verdict was
Crocker's refusal to transfer the trial out of Las Vegas, where an
annual Wayne Newton Day is celebrated and a street is named after
him.
   The court did not rule on that issue but said the location of
the trial was a reason to scrutinize the jury verdict closely.
   ``Wayne Newton's case poses the danger that First Amendment
values will be subverted by a local jury biased in favor of a
prominent local public figure against an alien speaker who
criticizes that local hero,'' said the opinion by Judge William
Norris.
   ``I don't think this decision would have been rendered any place
in the country other than in Las Vegas,'' Floyd Abrams, a prominent
libel lawyer representing NBC, said Thursday. ``I don't think the
jury was as much biased against NBC as it was prone to support
Wayne Newton.''
   NBC News President Michael Gartner called the ruling ``a sound
victory for investigative journalism.''
   Newton's lawyer, Morton Galane, said he would not comment until
he could reach Newton.

   A federal appeals court overturned Wayne
Newton's record $5.2 million libel judgment, saying the jury didn't
prove NBC News was deliberately false or reckless in suggesting the
singer had ties to the mob.
   In dismissing Newton's lawsuit, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled 3-0 Thursday that any false impressions in the 1980
broadcast did not result from the type of journalistic misconduct
required for libel lawsuits by public figures.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled public figures must prove that
defamatory statements were either deliberate falsehoods or

   Newton's lawyer, Morton Galane, said he would not comment until

   A federal jury found NBC News guilty of defaming entertainer Wayne Newton in a series of broadcasts that linked him to organized crime.

   After a two-month trial and a week of deliberations, the 10-member panel voted unanimously against NBC News, a division of General Electric Co.'s National Broadcasting Co. unit.
The jury awarded Mr. Newton $19.2 million in damages, including $5 million in punitive damages, $5 million for loss of reputation, $7.9 million for loss of income, $1.1 million for loss of future income and $225,000 for physical and mental suffering.

   NBC News said it will appeal the verdict.
Its lawyers had argued the broadcasts, in 1980 and 1981, were "substantially accurate."
In a statement, Lawrence K. Grossman, NBC News president, predicted the division and its reporters on the story "will prevail in a higher court."

   In the broadcasts, NBC News suggested that Mr. Newton had obtained financing to buy the Aladdin Hotel and Casino through links to organized crime and that he had sought help from organized-crime figures to end death threats against his family.
Mr. Newton contended the broadcast resulted in, among other things, the loss of millions of dollars in Las Vegas bookings and a movie contract.
He later sold his stake in the Aladdin to a business partner.

COURT URGED TO OVERTURN LIBEL AWARD TO SINGER
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
An NBC attorney attempted Friday to persuade federal appeals court judges in
Pasadena to strike down the largest libel verdict against an American news
organization -- a $5.3-million judgment that the network defamed singer Wayne
Newton in newscasts that linked him to organized crime figures.
</P>
<P>
NBC lawyer Floyd Abrams said the stories were the product of aggressive
reporting, not ill will, and should be protected by the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
But Newton's lawyer, Morton R. Galane, urged the judges to uphold the December,
1986, verdict of a Las Vegas federal court jury that Newton had been injured
unfairly by three broadcasts in 1980 and 1981.
</P>
<P>
Newton, 47, who listened to the legal arguments with his daughter and friends,
said that regardless of who wins he has been injured forever.
</P>
<P>
"When someone accuses you of what I've been accused of by these people . . .
the effects of what they said will last the rest of my life," the singer said
outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
Abrams said after the hearing that the case is very important because "a loss .
. . would make it very difficult for the news media to report about
investigations and suspicions about public figures, particularly in their own
community."
</P>
<P>
Galane agreed that the case has broad ramifications. In his brief, he asserted
that there would be negative consequences for many people besides Newton if the
punitive damages, which constitute $5 million of the $5.3-million verdict, are
overturned.
</P>
<P>
"If such awards are prohibited, victims of malicious defamation by the mass
media will have no effective remedy and the media will not be deterred from
disseminating knowing or reckless falsehoods," Galane wrote.
</P>
<P>
The legal battle stems out of three newscasts by NBC's special investigative
unit, headed by reporter Brian Ross and producer Ira Silverman.
</P>
<P>
The first report, on the Oct. 6, 1980, Nightly News, focused on Newton's
relationship with Guido Penosi, who was described as "a New York hoodlum from
the Gambino Mafia family."
</P>
<P>
The story said that Penosi was a key figure in an ongoing federal grand jury
investigation of the activities of the Gambino family in Las Vegas and that
investigators were looking into Newton's purchase of the Aladdin hotel-casino
there. The broadcast said Frank Piccolo, a Gambino family boss in New York, had
become a hidden partner in the Aladdin as a result of helping Newton take care
of a problem of an undisclosed nature.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, the newscast showed Newton testifying before the Nevada Gaming
Board on the subject of his relationship with Penosi. Federal authorities said
Newton had not told them the whole story about the relationship, the broadcast
added.
</P>
<P>
Newton's lawyers demanded a retraction four days later, calling the report
"untrue and slanderous." NBC stood by the story.
</P>
<P>
The network ran two follow-up stories, one on Nov. 6, 1980, after Newton
testified before a Connecticut grand jury investigating Piccolo, and another on
June 12, 1981, the day Piccolo and Penosi were indicted by a federal grand jury
in Connecticut on extortion charges. Piccolo was shot to death in a Bridgeport,
Conn., telephone booth before the extortion trial and Penosi was acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Newton sued for libel in 1981 and after numerous delays a 37-day trial was held
in 1986. The jury awarded him $19.3 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
On a verdict form, the jury said that there had been one false statement in the
stories and one false impression conveyed. But the jurors did not say what they
were.
</P>
<P>
Eleven months later, U.S. District Judge M.D. Crocker, who presided at the
trial, reduced the award to $5.3 million. In January, 1989, Newton agreed to
accept the reduced award rather than have a new trial in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
One issue emphasized by Abrams in the appeal is whether a broadcaster can be
held liable in a defamation case based upon a "false impression" created by
true statements in its broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
Abrams acknowledged that "there was no way this broadcast could have been made
at all without leaving a negative impression" of Newton. But NBC did not
deliberately set out to injure Newton, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Galane said Abrams had misstated the issue because the jury found that
there was a false statement in the report, not merely that a false impression
was conveyed. Moreover, his brief contends in detail that NBC was out to get
Newton.
</P>
<P>
Appeals court Judge William Norris questioned both Abrams and Galane
intensively about the extent of an appeals court's power to review jury
findings in First Amendment cases involving public figures. Galane asserted
that the review should be limited to the question of whether the jury had
abused its discretion, while Abrams argued for a much broader review.
</P>
<P>
Norris also asked the lawyers to compare the NBC stories to articles done by
Washington Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the Watergate
scandal that led to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
"We tread a very fine line here to make sure that future Woodwards and
Bernsteins aren't inhibited in pursuing their stories," Norris said.
</P>
<P>
Another key issue in the appeal is whether Judge Crocker erred by refusing to
grant NBC's motion to move the trial from Las Vegas, where Newton has been a
longtime headliner in showrooms and will start a four-week appearance at the
Las Vegas Hilton next week. A street has been named after him there and he has
received many civic honors.
</P>
<P>
Abrams said putting NBC on trial in Las Vegas "was the American equivalent of
trying author Salman Rushdie in Tehran for defaming the Ayatollah."
</P>
<P>
A pretrial poll taken for NBC showed that 95.6% of the people in the area knew
who Newton was and that 70% had a favorable impression of him. But Judge
Crocker said the poll revealed nothing about whether they would be biased.
</P>
<P>
Federal appeals court Judges Alfred T. Goodwin and Dorothy Nelson also took
part in the hearing. A decision is not expected for several months.
</P>
<P>
Newton sold his interest in the Aladdin some time ago.

   NBC News urged a federal appeals court
Friday to reverse a $5.3 million libel judgment won by entertainer
Wayne Newton, saying a 1980 broadcast was guilty of only one thing
_ aggressive journalism.
   Newton's lawyer, Morton Galane, argued that a jury found NBC had
``ill will'' toward Newton and said the verdict should stand.
   But NBC lawyer Floyd Abrams said the report linking Newton to
organized crime figures was correct. Abrams, a noted First
Amendment lawyer, argued that investigative reporting would suffer
if the decision were upheld.
   The two lawyers spoke during 30-minute oral summations to their
arguments at the hearing before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeal. The court's decision will be announced at a later date.
   A Las Vegas federal jury decided in December 1986 that the
network had willfully libeled Newton by claiming he had ties to
organized crime. The jury gave him the largest libel award in
history _ $19.2 million in damages.
   Presiding U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker of Fresno eventually
reduced that award to $5.3 million.
   Numerous media groups, including rival networks CBS, ABC and
Fox, several major newspaper chains and The Associated Press have
joined NBC's appeal of the libel verdict.
   During Friday's hearing, Judge William Norris of the
three-member panel likened the NBC team to Robert Woodward and Carl
Bernstein, the Washington Post reporters who broke the Watergate
scandal.
   ``Would a jury have a basis for finding Carl Bernstein and
Robert Woodward had ill will in pursuing the Watergate story?'' he
asked Newton's lawyer.
   Galane said they would not because those reporters were ordered
by their publisher to verify every fact through at least two
sources.
   But Norris suggested the Newton case might discourage
investigative reporting and prevent stories comparable to a
Watergate scandal from being uncovered.
   ``We tread a very fine line here to make sure that future
Woodwards and Bernsteins are not inhibited in pursuing their
stories,'' said Norris.
   Galane responded, ``We are not intending to inhibit such
goals,'' and declared at one point: ``We're not here to launch an
attack on the media or the First Amendment.''
   But he maintained that NBC had erred by not interviewing Newton
about its allegations.
   Abrams countered that Newton had refused numerous requests for
such an interview.
   Newton, who listened to the arguments from a front row seat,
later told reporters he still feels the impact of the 1980
broadcast that linked him to reputed mob figure Guido Penosi.
   ``The effects of what they said will last me the rest of my
life,'' he said.
   NBC reporter Brian Ross said he and his co-defendants, producer
Ira Silverman and executive producer Paul Greenberg, were ``very
optimistic'' about having the verdict overturned. All three
attended the hearing.
   The case began Oct. 6, 1980, with Ross' report ``Wayne Newton
and the Law.'' Ross reported that Newton had gone to Penosi for
help with a problem and that unnamed federal sources were looking
at Newton's relationship to two East Coast crime figures.
   The reports said one mobster had bragged of earning an interest
in Las Vegas' Aladdin Hotel, which Newton owned at the time.
   Newton claimed the report left the impression that his October
1980 purchase of the Aladdin was tied to organized crime _ which he
denies. Newton later sold the hotel.
   Abrams told reporters outside court: ``I think that a loss in
this case would make it very difficult for the press to report
about investigations and suspicions about prominent public figures,
particularly in their own community.''
   Judge Dorothy Nelson and chief appellate Judge Alfred Goodwin
joined Norris on the panel. Nelson expressed interest in an NBC
argument that the case should have been moved out of Las Vegas.
   Abrams said the defense submitted data on ``Mr. Newton's general
adulation in Las Vegas'' but was unable to win a change of venue.
   ``It was nearly hopeless for us to get a fair trial in Las
Vegas,'' he said.

   A $5.2 million libel damage award to singer
Wayne Newton from NBC was overturned Thursday by a federal appeals
court. It said a broadcast suggesting mob ties in Newton's purchase
of a casino was not shown to be deliberately or recklessly false.
   A jury in Las Vegas found that the television network's October
1980 story about a federal investigation of the singer's recent
acquisition of the Aladdin Hotel and Casino had created a false
impression that criminal organizations had helped in the purchase
in exchange for a hidden share and that Newton had deceived Nevada
gaming officials.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 3-0 ruling, said
most of the factual statements in the broadcast were undisputed,
and that any false impressions had not been shown to be deliberate
or reckless.
   For example, the court said, citing evidence in the case, Newton
had contacted a purported organized crime figure, Guido Penosi,
about a problem; Penosi had arranged a solution, and Penosi and an
associate later discussed the possibility of profiting from
Newton's ownership of the Aladdin, a subject that came under
federal investigation.
   Newton testified that he asked Penosi to stop organized crime
threats against himself and his daughter. That subject was not
mentioned in the NBC story. The court said Newton had testified
falsely to the state Gaming Board about his relationship with
Penosi.
   The court did not say whether the story as a whole was false _
an issue it did not have to reach. Instead, it found a lack of
evidence that the journalists had either deliberately lied or had
been reckless with the truth. That standard must be met by public
figures or public officials suing the news media for libel.
   The court said U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker, who reduced
the jury's $19.3 million libel award to $5.2 million, erroneously
allowed the damages to be based on a conclusion that NBC should
have realized its broadcast would give a false impression.
   What journalists should have realized or foreseen is irrelevant
in a libel suit by a public figure, which must be based on what a
journalist actually knew and intended, said the appellate decision
by Judge William Norris.
   He said Crocker also improperly ``substituted (his) own view as
to the supposed impression left by the broadcast for that of the
journalists who prepared the broadcast.''
   Newton had argued that the story's failure to mention the
threats against him as the reason he had contacted Penosi was a
deliberate omission of the truth. But Norris said the reporters had
reasons to doubt that threats had been made, noting that they had
gotten a denial from Newton's lawyer.
   Norris said the broadcast's statement that Newton had financial
problems at the time of the purchase was true. The broadcast had
some ambiguities about his financial arrangements and testimony,
which might have been cleared up by different wording, but
``editorial decisions about broadcasts are best left to editors,
not to judges and juries,'' Norris said.

GINJI YASUDA; OWNED VEGAS' ALADDIN HOTEL
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ginji Yasuda, the flamboyant international playboy who was the first foreigner
ever granted a Nevada gambling license when he took over the troubled Aladdin
Hotel, has died, it was confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
Andy Vanyo, chief of the enforcement division of the Nevada State Gaming
Control Board, said Yasuda died Dec. 3 in a cancer treatment center in Los
Angeles, but he did not know which one.
</P>
<P>
A Yasuda family attorney in Los Angeles did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
His death came three months after a bankruptcy trustee was appointed to operate
the Aladdin in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Yasuda, 57, the Korean-born son of a wealthy Japanese businessman, had
purchased the hotel and casino for $54 million out of bankruptcy after the
Teamsters Central States Pension Fund had foreclosed its loans.
</P>
<P>
Yasuda operated the hotel but not the casino for more than a year while gaming
officials investigated his background. The investigation was lengthy because of
difficulty in tracing Yasuda's years in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In February, 1987, Yasuda made history as the first foreigner to receive a
Nevada casino license. The Nevada Gaming Commission put a two-year expiration
on the license and required Yasuda to appoint experienced casino managers.
</P>
<P>
He spent millions more on improvements and remodeling and hired a professional
management team headed by Dennis Gomes, now president of the Golden Nugget
casino. But Yasuda and Gomes could not agree on operation of the resort, and
Yasuda fired the Gomes management team in September, 1987.
</P>
<P>
The trouble-scarred veteran hotel on the Las Vegas Strip had undergone a series
of earlier owners, including entertainer Wayne Newton, and had also been
investigated by the gaming board for giving free rooms, food and drink to many
known mobsters.
</P>
<P>
Yasuda, whose Korean name was Sam K. Park, was known on the Strip as a
high-stakes gambler who was a breeder of racehorses and an avid skeet shooter.
In the 1960s he drove on the international sports-car circuit.
</P>
<P>
More recently he had commuted between Japan and his palatial home in the Holmby
Hills area of Los Angeles. He also owned a ranch in Bradbury where he raised
racehorses.
</P>
<P>
He supposedly inherited a fortune from his father and used the proceeds from a
$120-million sale of a downtown Tokyo property to purchase the Aladdin.
</P>
<P>
As early as 1986, even before Yasuda was able to reopen the Aladdin casino,
there were reports that he was unable to pay some vendors for their goods.
</P>
<P>
This summer, Yasuda's lender put the hotel property in foreclosure for past due
mortgage payments and set Sept. 6 as the date for a public auction. In August,
Yasuda lost his gaming license and filed for bankruptcy, listing $121 million
in debts and $83 million in assets.
</P>
<P>
The resort is being operated by a court-appointed bankruptcy trustee. Jeff
Silver, a Las Vegas attorney familiar with the restructuring, said an auction
of Aladdin property has been scheduled in April but chances also remain good
that a new buyer will be found.

<HEAD>Iraqi Videotape Raises Journalistic Question</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable News Network's decision to air Iraqi
satellite transmissions live, including one segment of tape that
showed a meeting between Saddam Hussein and Western hostages,
became the focus of journalistic debate.
   ``We would not do that under any circumstances,'' said Bob
McFarland, NBC deputy director of news. ``We made that decision the
first day they pumped it out. We decided it was pure propaganda.''
   None of the big three American networks _ NBC, ABC and CBS _
aired the Iraqi transmission live on Aug. 28, as CNN did. Instead,
they showed portions somewhat later.
   CNN said the meeting was important enough to show as quickly as
possible.
   ``We make these decisions on a case-by-case basis,'' said CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth, adding that CNN understood that Saddam
would be speaking with American hostages. ``There was no question
in our minds this would be newsworthy.''
   CNN explained to viewers that the broadcast was an Iraqi TV
feed. And afterward, CNN featured a debate over the wisdom of the
decisions it had made.
   It's a decision the other networks see differently.
   At NBC, ``we would not put Iraqi TV on the air without first
knowing what it was,'' McFarland said. ``We took every frame of it
into the house, looked at it, and then selected two or three
bites.''
   ``Wherever there is a hostage videotape, a captive videotape,
it's a decision we don't take lightly,'' said Sherrie Rollins, ABC
director of news information. The president of ABC News has to
approve the use of such video, she said.
   When Saddam appeared on television on Aug. 23 with Western
hostages, ABC joined the Iraqi satellite feed live for a few
moments after first viewing the transmission to gauge the content
of the material.
   ``We did air the material; we did feel it was newsworthy,'' Ms.
Rollins said.
   But when Saddam appeared with hostages again Aug. 28, ABC taped
the material and showed only a brief portion during a special
report by anchorman Peter Jennings, she said.
   After the first appearance on CNN, Pati Heath of Detroit, the
sister of an American hostage, called the Atlanta-based network to
say she had seen her brother on TV.
   CNN then put her on television, too.
   ``I'm just happy to be able to see my brother's face,'' she
said. ``I hope Hussein sees me talking right now.''
   The first U.S. interview with Saddam went to CBS news anchor Dan
Rather, on Aug. 29.
   CBS said the taped interview lasted 90 minutes and began shortly
after midnight in Baghdad. Rather was told there would be no
interview that day, but suddenly was summoned to the presidential
palace.
   There were no restrictions on what Rather could ask, said CBS
spokeswoman Donna Dees. The only conditions were that Iraqi TV
cameras be used and that it be a one-hour interview that would air
as recorded, she said.
   He agreed to let the interview run longer so it could be cut for
translation and minor editing, Dees said.

<HEAD>TV News Gets High Ratings During Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis has created a thirst
for news that has lifted the ratings of everything from ``Face the
Nation'' to ``60 Minutes.''
   CBS' ``60 Minutes'' was the most-watched show on prime-time
television for the second consecutive week, the A.C. Nielsen Co.
said Aug. 28. It was the program's first back-to-back No. 1
victories since 1983, when it was the top-rated show for the year.
   Viewership of six Sunday news and information programs _ ``Face
the Nation'' and ``Sunday Morning'' on CBS; ``This Week with David
Brinkley'' and ``Business World'' on ABC, and NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' and ``Sunday Today'' _ rose 27.7 percent since Iraq's Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait, Nielsen reported.
   The most-watched nightly network news program belonged to ABC
and Peter Jennings, with a 10.4 average. CBS and Dan Rather were
second with 10.2 and NBC and Tom Brokaw was last with 8.9.

   Japanese businessman Ginji Yasuda, owner of the Aladdin hotel-casino and the first foreigner to receive a Nevada casino license, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection for the resort after months of financial and operating troubles.

   In the filing, Ginji Corp. listed debts of $121.2 million and total assets of $82.9 million.
James Patrick Shea, an attorney for Mr. Yasuda, said that the Aladdin's assets were listed at book value and that the Strip resort is worth substantially more.

   The Aladdin was set to be auctioned off next week by the holder of a $32.5 million mortgage on the property.
Mr. Yasuda bought the Aladdin out of a bankruptcy-law proceeding for $56 million in January 1986 and spent over $30 million refurbishing it.

   Mr. Yasuda, 55 years old, couldn't be reached for comment.

   Last week, the Nevada Gaming Commission ordered that the resort hire several new executives, disclose the source of recent loans and meet additional requests to remain open.
John O'Reilly, the commission's chairman, said the filing has no effect on a hearing on those issues scheduled for next week.

   The petition lists 10 secured creditors owed $34.1 million and about 800 unsecured creditors, excluding Aladdin employees, owed $86.9 million.
Mr. Shea said no final decision has been made on whether to sell or reorganize the troubled property.

The Nevada Gaming Commission appointed a trustee to operate the bankrupt
Aladdin Hotel and Casino on Tuesday night, three hours before the resort's
gambling license was due to expire.
</P>
<P>
The emergency action by the commission allowed the casino at the 1,100-room Las
Vegas Strip hotel to remain open and continue operations without interruption.
</P>
<P>
The five-member commission named certified public accountant Jack Fidelman as
trustee, and U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Linda Riegle issued the necessary court
orders after a late-night, cross-town conference call.
</P>
<P>
Bill Dougall, the former president of Del Webb Hotels, and his WDT Co. will
operate the resort for the trustee. Fidelman and Dougall once worked jointly in
a similar situation during an 18-month bankruptcy at the Marina Hotel on the
Strip.
</P>
<P>
The Gaming Commission's 9 p.m. vote followed an 11-hour, back-to-back meeting
of the three-member Gaming Control Board and the commission. Many Aladdin Hotel
employees attended the all-day meeting. Many were there to protest the actions
of Robert Brooker, a newly appointed general manager who has cut wages and
announced layoffs for 400 employees.
</P>
<P>
The commission action, in effect, ousted Brooker from the $125,000-a-year job
which he had held only eight days.
</P>
<P>
During questioning, Brooker admitted that he had been named general manager by
Ginji Yasuda, after the Japanese businessman no longer held a Nevada gambling
license at the Aladdin. Yasuda lost his Nevada gambling license by a commission
vote Aug. 24. Both the commission and the Gaming Control Board unanimously
agreed at Tuesday's meeting not to extend the license of Yoko Katsumata Yasuda,
the wife of Ginji Yasuda.
</P>
<P>
The Yasudas were the first foreign nationals to be licensed by Nevada to
operate a major gambling resort. The state refused to renew their gambling
licenses on the grounds that licensing conditions were ignored and that
financial loans were obtained from questionable sources.

   NBC has been joined by some of the nation's top
news organizations in appealing the network's multimillion-dollar
libel loss to entertainer Wayne Newton.
   A federal jury in Las Vegas awarded Newton $19.3 million in
damages over allegations that NBC libeled Newton by linking him to
mob figures.
   A federal judge later reduced the award to $5.3 million.
   NBC has appealed the verdict to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, saying the award to Newton was ``excessive and
insupportable.''
   Other networks, national newspaper groups and journalism
associations have joined NBC in the appeal, filing ``friends of the
court'' briefs last month.
   Among them were CBS, Capital Cities@ABC and Fox Broadcasting,
whose lawyers argued that viewers' impressions should not open a
media organization to liability.
   Also filing briefs were the Gannett Co., The New York Times
Company, Dow Jones &amp; Co., Copley Press and Chronicle Publishing,
according to Monday's editions of the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
   Newton's attorney, Morton Galane, said he consented to the other
media supporting NBC so the appeals court could be ``presented with
all possible arguments.''
   Newton sued NBC after the network broadcast a series of stories
entitled ``Wayne Newton and the Law'' beginning in 1980.
   Galane argued in the trial that the NBC reports left the false
impression that Newton's purchase of the Aladdin Hotel was linked
to the mob.

Entertainer Wayne Newton has asked a federal appeals court to uphold his
historic $5.3-million jury award growing out of NBC News reports that he was
linked to organized crime figures.
</P>
<P>
Newton's attorney has filed a 120-page brief with the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals in San Francisco, saying that overturning the award would have "dire
consequences to the public."
</P>
<P>
Attorney Morton Galane said if the jury verdict is overturned at the appeals
level, "victims of malicious defamation by the mass media will have no
effective remedy and the media will not be deterred from disseminating knowing

</P>
<P>
If upheld, Newton's award would be the largest in history arising from a news
report.
</P>
<P>
Newton sued the network in 1981, claiming that a series of broadcasts in 1980
defamed him. The broadcasts, titled "Wayne Newton and the Law," linked Newton
to alleged crime figures and centered on his purchase of the Aladdin Hotel
here.
</P>
<P>
The series was presented by NBC reporter Brian Ross and producer Ira Silverman.

After a lengthy jury trial in Las Vegas in 1986, the jury awarded Newton a

<TEXT>
   Nearly two years after a jury awarded a $19.2 million libel verdict to entertainer Wayne Newton, his case against National Broadcasting Co. is heading to trial -- again.

   Court papers filed last week in U.S. district court in Los Angeles disclosed that Mr. Newton's attorneys will seek to limit the second trial to a question of how much Mr. Newton was damaged by an NBC broadcast, while the network's lawyers will try to reopen broader issues raised in the first trial.
NBC is a unit of General Electric Co. of Fairfield, Conn.

   The case concerns an Oct. 6, 1980, NBC news broadcast entitled "Wayne Newton and the Law."
In the segment, NBC reported that Mr. Newton had gone to Guido Penosi, who reputedly had ties to organized crime, for help with a problem, which wasn't named.

   Two days before the broadcast aired, Mr. Newton bought a half-ownership in the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas, Nev.
He argued that the NBC report created the impression that he had received financial assistance from organized-crime figures to finance the purchase.

   At trial, Mr. Newton testified he sought Mr. Penosi's assistance after receiving death threats against his daughter.
Mr. Newton also said he received a bank loan to finance the purchase of the hotel, a fact not mentioned in the broadcast.

   In December 1986, after two months of testimony, the jury awarded Mr. Newton $19.2 million in damages, the largest libel award ever against a news organization.
But U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker reduced the award to $5.3 million, setting aside the jury's award for loss of income and reducing an award for injury to reputation from $5 million to $50,000.

   In an unusual move, Mr. Newton rejected Judge Crocker's reduced award and sought a new trial on damages only.
"Mr.
Newton felt that in light of his reputation the award for reputational injury should have been higher," said Morton Galane of Las Vegas, Mr. Newton's lawyer.

   In a legal brief, Mr. Galane argued that he should be allowed to introduce new evidence on Mr. Newton's loss of income in order for the jury to assess damages properly.
He is also seeking punitive damages against the network, alleging that statements made by NBC executives following the trial demonstrate continued ill will toward Mr. Newton, the court papers said.

   Punitive damages are aimed at punishing the defendant rather than compensating the injured party.
NBC argues that such damages are unconstitutional in First Amendment cases.

   NBC is seeking to present a broad range of evidence to show that it didn't broadcast false statements that damaged Mr. Newton, according to Floyd Abrams of the New York law firm of Cahill Gordon &amp; Reindel, representing the network.
Mr. Newton's lawyers have argued that it is enough that the broadcast created a false impression, even if each statement taken separately was true.

   Judge Crocker is expected to hear oral arguments on the scope of the new trial on Nov. 15.
The trial isn't expected to begin until May 1989.

<TEXT>
   Japanese businessman Ginji Yasuda filed Monday
to put his ailing Aladdin Hotel under federal bankruptcy protection,
citing debt that outstripped the resort's assets by more than $38
million.
   Yasuda, the first foreigner to be licensed to operate a Nevada
casino, reported in the Chapter 11 filing that his Ginji Corp. owed
$121.2 million to various creditors while having total assets of
$82.9 million.
   The filing, which had been expected, comes on the heels of the
Nevada Gaming Commission's decision last week to pull Yasuda's
license and give the Aladdin until next Tuesday to comply with a
list of conditions to allow its casino to remain open.
   ``This was the first step was to get some breathing room for the
hotel,'' said James Shea, an attorney who worked on the petitition.
   Gaming Commission Chairman John O'Reilly said the bankruptcy
filing did not changed the commission's insistence that the Aladdin
hire several new officers, inject $3 million in cash into the casino
and disclose the source of recent loans to the resort.
   Shea said the hotel has begun to comply with the commission's
conditions, including the hiring Monday of longtime gaming figure
Robert Brooker to be general manager.
   He said hotel officials will hold talks with gaming regulators
this week in an effort to have the $3 million requirement set aside.
   Shea said the bankruptcy filing should mean ``business as
normal'' at the hotel, with employees contuing to get paid and all
casino operations intact.
   The bankruptcy filing staves off a scheduled auction of the
Aladdin by the holder of a $32.5 million mortgage on the resort.
   Yasuda himself took the long-troubled resort out of bankruptcy in
1986 when he bought the club for $54 million and spent another $20
million in improvements.
   Yasuda was given a two-year limited gaming license in 1987 but
casino regulators became increasingly concerned over his failure to
comply with regulatory requirements and the casino's increasing
losses.
   At last week's Gaming Commission meeting, commissioners voted to
strip Yasuda of his license but allow gaming to continue at the
resort while attempts continued to sell it.
   The commission ordered that the 55-year-old Yasuda, who is
reported to be seriously ill at his Los Angeles home, stay out of
the club and remove his name from any accounts.

   Entertainer Wayne Newton on Thursday accepted
a $6 million libel award that had been collecting interest while he
pursued his lawsuit against NBC, saying he is satisfied his
reputation has been restored.
   ``This was not a matter of money. This was a matter of
vindication of my name,'' the singer said after filing papers in
federal court to collect the award over a 1980 NBC broadcast linking
him to an organized crime figure.
   A federal jury in Las Vegas awarded a record $22.3 to Newton in
1986, but a judge reduced it to $5.3 million and last month ordered
him to accept the lower sum or face proving his case again in a new
trial, this time in Los Angeles.
   Newton's lawyer, Morton Galane, said that with interest, the $5.3
million award now equals $6 million. ``Such an amount would be
higher than any (libel) award ever affirmed by an appellate court in
the history of this nation,'' he said.
   Galane said a survey conducted for Newton satisfied him that his
image had been restored and that the public understood that he had
won his case.
   NBC said Thursday it would appeal. The network said in a
statement that a trial in Los Angeles would be less likely to
produce the results seen in Las Vegas.
   ``Mr. Newton's refusal to put his case before a Los Angeles jury
speaks for itself on all the issues, including whether NBC libeled
Mr. Newton,'' said Thomas B. Ross, NBC senior vice president of news.
   The jury had ruled that the singer was defamed in a series of
broadcasts. NBC correspondent Brian Ross had reported that Newton
went to a reputed mob figure for help after his 3-year-old
daughter's life was threatened.
   Newton argued the report left the impression that his 1980
purchase of the Aladdin Hotel was linked to organized crime.

   A federal judge has given singer Wayne Newton
until Feb. 1 to accept a reduced $5.3 million award in his libel
suit against NBC or face the prospect of proving his case again in a
new trial.
   U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker's decision, filed last week in
Fresno, Calif., came after attorneys for Newton argued for a new
trial solely on damages while NBC attorneys sought a complete rerun
of the original 1986 Las Vegas trial, which lasted eight weeks.
   Crocker said in the ruling that he was ``convinced that the
issues of liability and damages are so intertwined that they should
be determined by the same jury.''
   Newton's attorney, Morton Galane, was not immediately available
for comment on what the entertainer would decide to do.
   Newton won a record $22.8 million verdict against the network
when a jury ruled the singer was defamed in a series of NBC
broadcasts that linked him to organized crime figures.
   Crocker, however, later threw out all but $5.3 million of the
award, and gave Newton the option of accepting the money or seeking
a new trial strictly on damages.
   Both sides submitted lengthy legal briefs in October in U.S.
District Court in Los Angeles, where the case was transferred for a
retrial scheduled for May.
   The Newton-NBC case stems from an Oct. 6, 1980, broadcast
entitled ``Wayne Newton and the Law.''
   In the report, NBC correspondent Brian Ross reported that Newton
had gone to organized crime figure Guido Penosi for help with a
problem.
   Newton argued the report left the impression that his October
1980 purchase of the Aladdin Hotel was linked to organized crime.
The hotel has since been sold and is currently owned by Japanese
businessman Ginji Yasuda.
   Galane has suggested he will call as witnesses such luminaries as
President Reagan, Frank Sinatra and Lucille Ball to testify in
Newton's behalf for assessing damages in a new trial.

   The Nevada Gaming Control Board voted to extend the gaming license of the troubled Aladdin hotel-casino in Las Vegas until Oct. 11, giving owner Ginji Yasuda time to explore a sale of the property.

   The casino is scheduled to be auctioned Sept. 6 unless Mr. Yasuda pays off a $32.5 million mortgage or files for protection under federal bankruptcy laws.
Mr. Yasuda, who is said to be ill, didn't appear at the hearing held in Carson City, Nev.

   Mr. Yasuda, a Korean-born businessman raised in Japan, was the first foreigner licensed to operate a casino in Nevada.
He bought the Aladdin for $54 million in 1986, and spent more than $20 million refurbishing it.

   Among other restrictions, the state agency required Mr. Yasuda to fully disclose personal loans.
Board members raised concerns about Mr. Yasuda's financial and personal associations since his license was first granted.
Mr. Yasuda's lawyers weren't reachable to comment.

<TEXT>
   Entertainer Wayne Newton has asked a
federal appeals court to uphold the record $5.3 million damage
award in his suit against NBC News over reports that he was linked
to organized crime figures.
   Newton's attorney has filed a 120-page brief with the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, saying that overturning
the award would have ``dire consequences to the public.''
   Lawyer Morton Galane said in the brief filed Nov. 17 that if the
verdict is overturned, ``victims of malicious defamation by the
mass media will have no effective remedy and the media will not be
deterred from disseminating knowing or reckless falsehoods.
   ``The cost of litigating against a media giant like NBC will
often exceed any compensatory award the victim could hope to
receive.''
   If upheld, Newton's award would be the largest on record arising
from a news report.
   Newton sued the network in 1981, claiming that a series of
broadcasts in 1980 defamed him. The broadcasts, entitled ``Wayne
Newton and the Law,'' linked Newton to alleged crime figures and
centered on his purchase of the Aladdin Hotel here.
   The series was presented by NBC reporter Brian Ross and producer
Ira Silverman.
   A jury awarded Newton $19.2 million in damages in 1986.
   The following year, U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker cut the
award to $5.3 million _ $5 million of that is punitive damages _
but upheld the jury's libel findings.
   NBC appealed to the 9th Circuit after Newton announced he would
accept the reduced award.

   Japanese investors, attracted by bargain
properties and a dramatic increase in tourism here by their
countrymen, have spent or committed $800 million in this
entertainment capital and it's fueling an economic boom.
   The projects range from four hotel-casinos to a downtown office
building and a massive golf course and resort development.
   More than 380,000 Japanese tourists are expected to visit Las
Vegas this year, vs. about 300,000 in 1988. That is not lost on some
of Japan's leading economic players.
   ``More than half the Japanese tourists who come to Los Angeles
will also come to Las Vegas,'' said Yoshi Morichika, who is heading
up a 1,274-acre golf and destination resort community for Japanese
recreation and electronics giant Cosmo World.
   The project, in nearby Henderson, will include 45 holes of golf,
2,700 condominiums, apartments and luxury homes, a dozen tennis
courts, a tennis stadium and a 700-room hotel.
   Cosmo World has projects in Japan, Europe, Hawaii, Los Angeles,
San Francisco and Tucson. It added Las Vegas to the list ``because
the land is not expensive, yet, and there is a huge volume of
Japanese tourists here,'' Morichika said in an interview.
   Jane Wilson, who handles international marketing for the Las
Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, says Japanese tourism has
been increasing at about 20 percent a year, and is expected to jump
about 27 percent this year.
   ``If they come to the West Coast, we're going to get them,'' she
said. ``In their culture, they want to go where a city is known
worldwide, where there are a lot of things to do such as shows,
shopping, sightseeing, et cetera.''
   The growing identity of Las Vegas in Japan, bargain real estate
prices, a good economic climate and the attractiveness of the city
are proving a magnet for Japanese investors. The Nevada Development
Authority says Las Vegas is the sixth-fastest growing metropolitan
area in the United States.
   Cosmo World's resort project is expected to cost $200 million by
the time it's completed in 1993.
   Japanese billionaire Masao Nangaku, who bought the Dunes Hotel
and Casino two years ago for $157 million, is planning a 35-story
high-rise office building and 300-room nongaming hotel in downtown
Las Vegas. The cost, when completed in 1991, will be about $120
million.
   A group of Japanese investors have agreed to help Orlando, Fla.
developer Bob Snow finance a $130 million dining and entertainment
complex known as Winchester Station. Snow is seeking a new site for
the project because some landowners in downtown Las Vegas balked at
selling their property.
   Japanese businessman Katsuki Manabe, who owns more than 30
arcades in Tokyo, has invested $30 million in the Park Hotel in
downtown Las Vegas and millions more in his Nevada-based Sigma
Games, a gaming equipment maker.
   Millionaire Ginji Yasuda has invested more than $120 million in
the Aladdin Hotel.
   The move by the Japanese into the sophisticated gaming industry
has not been smooth.
   Yasuda, a high-rolling gambler before he bought the Aladdin, has
experienced financial problems at the resort in recent months,
forcing him to dig for sources to pay back taxes and some suppliers.
   However, one top Nevada gaming source, who asked not to be
identified, said Yasuda's license was up for reconsideration earlier
this year and would not have been continued ``if he had not been
able to meet his gaming obligations.''
   The same source said the Japanese had taken over depressed
properties and kept them open ``and any stride forward is a positive
sign.''
   The Dunes and Aladdin had been operating under bankruptcy
protection for years before they were purchased by Nangaku and
Yasuda. The Park, the former Holiday Inn downtown, had been closed
for five years before it was refurbished and opened by Manabe.
   Mike Rumbolz, former Gaming Control Board chairman who now heads
Donald Trump's efforts to enter Nevada gaming, said the Japanese
were hampered because they bought distressed properties that
couldn't make it under American expertise.
   Sukeaki Izumi, who owns five hotels in Japan and Guam, recently
purchased another closed property, the former Treasury Hotel, which
he has renamed the San Remo. Izumi, who looked at properties in
Hawaii but opted for Las Vegas because of the lower costs, has
committed $30 million for the purchase and renovation of the hotel.
   Don Woodsmall, who serves with Morichika as project manager of
the Cosmo World project, said Las Vegas was picked by the Japanese
company, in part, ``because the housing market is so strong here.''
   Representatives of the company began looking for land in late
1987 and selected a site 10 minutes south of the Las Vegas Strip.
   Work on the Cosmo World project is scheduled to start in the
first quarter of 1990. Several major hotel chains have expressed an
interest in running the resort, Morichika said.
   Izumi, a millionaire industrialist, became involved in the hotel
business six years ago when he bought a property in Osaka.
   He switched his focus here, he said, because the city was
smaller, the cost of living was lower, real estate prices were more
attractive, and he liked the way of life.
   Izumi moved to Las Vegas in December and plans to run the San
Remo personally. The 324-room European-style property is scheduled
to reopen July 1. Izumi has plans for a $30 million 16-story,
340-room tower next year, followed by a second tower and expansion
of the casino.
   When Nangaku bought the Dunes Hotel two years ago, his attorney
predicted other Japanese businessmen would follow.
   They did.
   ``This area is very attractive to the Japanese businessman,''
Izumi said. ``There is no other city like Las Vegas in the world.''

<TEXT>
   Attorneys for singer Wayne Newton and NBC-TV
returned to federal court to argue over the scope of a new trial in
Newton's libel suit against the network.
   Newton's attorney, Morton Galane, urged U.S. District Judge Myron
D. Crocker on Monday to limit the new trial to damages only, while
NBC's lawyers argued for a complete rerun of the original trial won
by Newton.
   Floyd Abrams, NBC's lead lawyer, said the jury that gave Newton a
record $19.2 libel verdict in 1986 failed to pinpoint a reason for
its action and that a new jury should hear the case.
   Galane, however, contended the issue of liability was decided
fairly in the original trial, when the jury ruled that Newton was
defamed by NBC during broadcasts in 1980 and 1981 that linked the
singer to organized crime figures.
   Crocker, who presided over the first trial, reduced the initial
jury award to $5.3 million last year and gave Newton the option of
accepting the smaller award or going back to court. Newton rejected
the smaller award.
   Crocker took Monday's arguments under submission. He has
scheduled the new trial for May in Los Angeles.
   Newton was in court Monday, flanked by his girlfriend, aides and
bodyguards.
   He sued NBC over three broadcasts in which NBC reported that
sources said Newton had gone to a reputed organized crime figure for
help with a problem. Newton testified at the 1986 trial that he was
seeking help in stopping death threats against his daughter.
   Newton contended the report left the impression that his October
1980 purchase of the Aladdin Hotel was linked to organized crime.

<TEXT>
   Entertainer Wayne Newton said today he will
accept a $6 million libel award in his long-running lawsuit against
NBC, saying he feels vindicated from a nearly 9-year-old report that
linked him to the Mafia.
   ``This was not a matter of money,'' Newton told reporters at a
morning news conference. ``This was a matter of vindication of my
name.''
   Newton's attorney, Morton Galane, said the interest accrued on
the reduced $5.3 million award now equals $6 million.
   ``Such an award would be higher than any (libel) award ever
affirmed by an appellate court in the United States,'' he said.
   The case does not yet appear to be over, however. NBC attorneys
had indicated earlier they would appeal the award to higher federal
courts.
   Newton said that as far as he was concerned the case was over for
him personally. He said that if NBC appeals he will leave the matter
to his attorneys.
   Galane told reporters that one factor in Newton's decision to
accept the award was a survey of public attitudes toward Newton's
acceptance of such a high award.
   ``Three weeks ago that survey confirmed that the public believes
that the reporting of a high libel award in favor of Mr. Newton
would be perceived by others as restoration of a positive public
image,'' Galane said.
   In late December U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker gave Newton
until Feb. 1 to accept the award, which had been reduced from $22.8
million, or face the prospect of proving his case against NBC in a
new trial.
   Newton won the original amount against the network when a jury
ruled the singer was defamed in a series of broadcasts that linked
him to organized crime figures.
   Crocker later threw out all but $5.3 million of the award and
gave Newton the option of accepting the money or seeking a new trial
strictly on damages.
   The Newton-NBC case stems from an Oct. 6, 1980, broadcast titled
``Wayne Newton and the Law.''
   NBC correspondent Brian Ross reported that Newton had gone to
organized crime figure Guido Penosi for help after his
then-3-year-old daughter's life had been threatened.
   Newton argued the report left the impression that his October
1980 purchase of the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas was linked to
organized crime. The hotel has since been sold and is currently
owned by a Japanese businessman.
   Asked today if he would again ask for Penosi's help, Newton said,
``I would go to the devil himself to save my daughter's life.''
   Newton emphasized that his lawsuit was not meant to suppress
reporting of the news.
   ``All I hope is that responsible journalists will think before
they do to someone what they did to me,'' he said.

Japanese businessman Ginji Yasuda filed Monday to put the ailing Aladdin Hotel
under federal bankruptcy protection, citing total debt that outstripped the
resort's assets by more than $38 million.
</P>
<P>
Yasuda, the first foreigner to be licensed to operate a Nevada casino, reported
in the Chapter 11 filing that his Ginji Corp. owed $121.2 million to various
creditors while having total assets of $82.9 million.
</P>
<P>
The bankruptcy filing, which had been widely expected, comes on the heels of

Commission Chairman John O'Reilly said the bankruptcy filing has not changed
the commission's insistence that the Aladdin hire several new officers, put a
$3-million cash infusion into the casino and disclose the source of recent
loans to the resort.

<P>
"I don't think the primary focus or goal has really changed," O'Reilly said. "I
would hope they bring forward information Tuesday that will show their

James Shea, an attorney who worked on the petition, said the hotel has already

<HEAD>Audio, Video Equipment Banned at Neil Bush Hearing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators say audio and video recording
equipment won't be allowed at the Sept. 25 public hearing on Neil
Bush's role in the failure of Silverado Banking savings and loan.
   Bush, who faces charges that he acted improperly as a director
of Silverado, was scheduled to testify. He was an outside director
of Silverado from 1985 until shortly before the thrift was seized
by regulators in 1988.
   Bush has been accused of conflicts of interest in his dealings
with former developers Ken Good and Bill Walters, two major
Silverado borrowers.
   The decision not to allow recording equipment angered Rep. Pat
Schroeder, D-Colo., and the Colorado Broadcasters Association.
   Dan Buck, an administrative assistant to Schroeder, said he
understood the federal Office of Thrift Supervision wanting to
avoid turning the hearing into a circus. ``But the taxpayers have
already bought $1 billion worth of ducats to the Silverado failure,
and they should be able to see the investigative process,'' he
said.
   Past administrative hearings have been closed to the public
entirely. In July, because of interest in the national savings and
loan fiasco, the policy was changed, but recording devices still
are not permitted at Office of Thrift Supervision hearings.
   The broadcasters' association sent a letter to the agency's
director, Timothy Ryan, requesting at least one television camera
inside the Neil Bush hearing.
   The association also asked Ryan to move the hearing from
Denver's federal courthouse building, where video equipment never
is permitted. He suggested other hearing sites that allow cameras,
including the University of Denver and state and county courtrooms.
   ``The broadcast media makes a judgment in terms of what they
believe the public is most interested in,'' said Andrew Low, an
attorney for the association and KUSA-TV in Denver.
   ``It is beyond question that Neil Bush's involvement in the
failure of Silverado is of considerable public interest,
particularly in Colorado where Neil Bush lives,'' Low said.

<HEAD>FCC Chairman Says Budget Hearings May Delay Cable Bill Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to re-regulate the cable television
industry may not get a final vote by Congress this year, the
chairman of the Federal Communications Commission told broadcasters
Sept. 18.
   Alfred C. Sikes said the continuing House-Senate negotiations on
the federal budget could cause the delay. The House has passed a
cable bill but a vote on a similar measure in the Senate still is
pending.
   He made the remarks in responding to questions posed at a lunch
held by the International Radio and Television Society in New York.
   Only a month ago, Sikes said, he would have said he felt ``there
was a substantial likelihood'' of a final vote by both houses this
year.
   But now, ``I think that in some ways the fate of the cable
legislation is tied to (federal) budget negotiations,'' he said.
   As the talks drag on and if negotiators ``tighten the rules on
floor action in Congress, it would seem to me that the cable
legislation will run out of time'' for a final vote before the
current session of Congress ends, he said.
   The Bush administration strongly opposes the House bill, saying
Congress should instead encourage new forms of competition to
cable. That industry was largely freed of regulation by Congress in
1984.
   Among other things, the House measure, passed in response to
increasing complaints about overpricing and shoddy cable TV
service, would impose federal price limits on basic cable service.
   It also would give the FCC power to order price rollbacks on the
worst offenders and boost competition to cable, which now serves
58.9 percent of the nation's 93.1 million homes with TV, according
to Nielsen estimates.

<HEAD>Newton Will Appeal NBC Libel Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wayne Newton asked a federal appeals court to
reconsider a ruling that overturned his record $5.2 million libel
judgment against NBC News for a 1980 broadcast linking him to
organized crime.
   Lawyers for Newton said the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
``overlooked or misconstrued'' some evidence and interpreted other
evidence unfairly in favor of NBC in its Aug. 30 ruling.
   In a petition asking for a rehearing, the attorneys said that
failing to overturn the verdict would ``chill the rights of public
figures to bring defamation suits against powerful media
defendants.''
   Newton attorney Morton Galane said Sept. 20 that he filed the
petition.
   A jury in Las Vegas found that NBC's story falsely implied that
organized crime figures had helped Newton buy the Aladdin Hotel and
Casino in exchange for a hidden interest.
   It awarded Newton $19.3 million, but that was later reduced to
$5.2 million, mostly in punitive damages

FT  24 DEC 93 / How Aladdin helped build a castle - but lost out when it had
to be reconstructed: Barry Riley enters the Cave of Gatt and a gripping
story unfolds - but will it end happily ever after?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY

<TEXT>
Once upon a time, in a land not so far away, where the wind is bitterly cold
and the rain often lashes down from a grey and sullen sky, a Magic Kingdom
once grew out of the damp farmland. Its fairy castle turrets rose towards
the sky and its walls resounded to the sounds of happy crowds and fireworks.
But the magic faded and the Kingdom lost its power, and the allegiance of
its millions of subjects waned. This is the story of its rise and fall.
There were moguls from the west, from the Holy Wooden Empire of the
Clintonians. One was a man called Eisnar, rich and powerful, his wealth
expanded by his almost unlimited options. He was already a Grand Vizier in
his native land but he vowed to conquer other parts of the earth where his
market share was low compared with the local entertainment product. So he
came east and journeyed in search of the treasures which he believed were
hidden there, in particular in the Christmas video market.
In the course of his travels he seized literary gems, especially those in
which there was no longer any copyright, such as Beauty and the Beast and
Jungle Book, and turned them into animated wonders which all the world
flocked to see. But still he did not rest content, because there was
resistance to his ambitions and a bigger share of the multimedia leisure
spending market could still be gained.
So the cunning Eisnar drew up a scheme for a new Magic Kingdom and printed
it in a special prospectus and on the cover he painted a picture of a pink
castle. And he pinned it up on walls and inserted it into local newspapers
and waited for local gamblers and traders.
Sure enough, he did not have long to wait before Aladdin, a local merchant
and investor, came looking for Eisnar. 'I find your scheme very attractive,'
he cried. 'Before long it will be paying out great dividends. Please let me
invest.' (In real life, of course, people do not subscribe to prospectuses
with pink castles on the front, but remember, this is a fairy story.)
Thus an elaborate contract was drawn up and partnerships in the scheme were
granted to Aladdin and many of his friends. And Eisnar raised his hands and
issued the command for the Magic Kingdom called EuroDisney Resort to be
created out of an empty landscape. Such was his power that it was done.
But soon the mighty Eisnar began to become angry. The returns were slipping
below budget. The local people began to become restless under his rule and
to protest about his 'cultural imperialism' as they called it. He needed to
increase his power. But only Aladdin could help him to achieve this.
Therefore he promised the greedy Aladdin that he would increase his
dividends, but only if he helped him in a special mission. They journeyed
out into the wilderness and came to a spot at Geneva, where the mountain
lake feeds a mighty river between many high banks.
'This is the entrance to the Cave of Gatt,' Eisnar announced.
'I cannot enter, but you can. Do not be afraid. The Cave extends almost for
ever, some say as far round as Uruguay, but you do not need to go far. Just
inside the entrance you will find the Magic Lamp. I need it for my
audiovisual industry. Bring it to me as quickly as you can. Beware of this,
however: you must ignore the other riches within and must return by December
15.'
At this, his voice became harsh and frightening. 'If you do not succeed the
Cave of Gatt will crumble and you will be trapped for all eternity behind
the high tariff walls. For so the emperor of the Clintonites has decreed.'
Fearfully, Aladdin entered the cave, which to his ears seemed to be filled
with the sound of endless talking. But immediately he gasped in wonder. All
around were the great treasures of the world, spices from the East Indies,
rice from Thailand, textiles from China, computers from Taiwan, jumbo jets
from Seattle. Then he saw the entertainment section, with piles of Michael
Jackson CDs and heaps of videos such as Rambo 2 and Child's Play 3. In the
middle lay what must be the Magic Lamp, battered and dusty, and surely
worthless.
Then he made a grave mistake. Tempted by the treasures all around, he picked
up a Peter Pan video. At once the ground began to shake violently beneath
his feet, and he heard the angry voice of Eisnar bellowing from the entrance
to the cave. 'You foolish knave, you have disobeyed my instructions and you
have infringed my intellectual property rights. You shall pay the ultimate
penalty. You shall be consumed by a trade war.'
Desperately Aladdin looked around. Surely he could not get out by December
15 now. He picked up the Magic Lamp and looked at the primitive object to
see why it might be so valuable. Was it broken? He rubbed the side to see if
it might be made of gold.
The result was amazing. There was a sudden blue flash, a clap of thunder,
and a hazy figure appeared. 'I am Sir Leon, genie of the Magic Lamp,' the
apparition pronounced. 'Your every directive is my command, or at least,
will be the basis for meaningful negotiations at the highest level.'
Aladdin looked around in panic at the crumbling Cave of Gatt. It might fall
in at any moment. 'Can you get me out of this mess?' he cried. 'No problem]'
answered the genie. 'It may take all night, but I can fudge an answer
somehow] And then I can appear on BBC breakfast TV at the peak audience
time]'
And so the Cave of Gatt did not, after all, collapse but was propped up.
Aladdin returned home and life continued much as before, but he realised
that somewhere Eisnar was still at large, and in his anger and frustration
might be seeking revenge, especially as the newspapers said that
EuroDisneyland was threatened with closure.
Several months passed, and then one afternoon he heard a strange sound
outside his house. Looking through the window he saw a stooped old pedlar
with long white hair hobbling along the road, carrying a bundle of papers.
In a quavering but penetrating voice the old man called out repeatedly: 'New
shares for old] New shares for old]'
Other people were approaching him, offering shares in companies such as
Fisons, Tiphook and Queens Moat Houses, yet he turned them away. But then
Aladdin came up with his EuroDisney certificates. Suddenly the old pedlar
seized them, crying: 'Excellent sir, you are the investor I have been
searching for. Your shares are worthless, without hope of dividends, but why
not take these perpetual zero coupon loan certificates instead?' They
sounded good, Aladdin admitted, but why was there a picture of a small furry
animal in the corner? 'It is logical,' replied the old man, who seemed to
become younger by the minute. 'When you have Mickey Mouse securities it is
wise to recognise the fact.'
And so Eisnar - for indeed it was he in disguise - went away in triumph
because he no longer needed Aladdin, and he began to work his spell on the
Magic Kingdom. The capital was restructured, some new magic carpet rides
were built and the marketing was sharpened up. New auditors were hired, to
replace the over-fussy previous firm. A new tunnel to the north was opened,
encouraging Anglo-Saxon hordes to visit at special cut prices, with a
special opportunity to purchase duty-free drinks.
Aladdin was upset, because he believed he had been deceived. But he
remembered the old Magic Lamp, which was still in his possession, and he
rubbed it vigorously. Again Sir Leon the genie appeared in a puff of smoke.
'Your wish is my directive, subject of course to satisfactory harmonisation
procedures and the required legislative implementation by all member
states,' he said.
'You must stop Eisnar,' cried Aladdin. He has restored the power of the
Magic Kingdom and may achieve total cultural domination.'
'Don't worry about a thing,' replied Sir Leon. 'It should be easy. With a
wave of my regulation book I shall require full compliance with the Third
Theme Park Directive, including sub-section 13(c). Furthermore, all Mickey
Mouse impersonators must be paid a minimum wage of Ecu1,000 an hour. Lastly,
all food prepared at the site, including ice cream, must contain 10 per cent
garlic from the garlic mountain. That should fix it.'
Thus was Eisnar repelled, and the clouds gathered and the rain fell and a
great forest grew around the Magic Kingdom and hid it, until even the
highest turrets of the castle had vanished.
But sadly Aladdin and his friends did not live happily ever afterwards. The
moguls of the Holy Wooden Empire developed a new scheme. They created
monsters called Tyrannosaurus and Stegosaurus which roamed the land,
crushing and consuming local opposition and creating a famine in the box
offices. But that will be another story, the one they shall call Jurassic
Park 2.

The Disney company may be in trouble in Europe, where the once-roaring mouse
now squeaks in terror at its quarterly bank statements. But in America,
corporation and rodent have ridden high throughout 1993, mostly on the back
of a single film Aladdin. Disney's new animated feature has outperformed
last year's Beauty And The Beast to become the highest-grossing cartoon
feature of all time.
Why? How? What is happening? Ten years ago paint-and-brush animation was
pronounced dead or dying by many observers, including, I regret to say, me.
The art had been hounded to an early grave - we all said - by such new
pretenders as modelwork, animatronics and computer graphics.
Now look at the blushes on our faces. Aladdin has been the year's second
favourite film after That Dinosaur Movie and a mere five minutes in your
seat will tell you why. Having seduced us with romantic traditionalism in
Beauty And The Beast, Disney now turn 180 degrees and go for comedy mixed
with high kitsch. The decor in Aladdin is out of Kismet via The Thief Of
Baghdad. The characters are spoofy and (post)modern: led by a Tom
Cruise-like Aladdin and a Robin Williams-voiced genie with a genius for
mimicry. And the pace is so fast, so sure, that British Rail should take a
look at Disney's Advanced Passenger Carpet as a serious potential design
model for 2002.
The story, we know, is simple enough to suit the breakneck pace. Boy meets
lamp; boy rubs lamp; boy, after minor setbacks, is helped by lamp to girl of
his dreams. All the film's directors John Musker and Ron Clements need do is
follow the narrative arrows. We begin with melodrama, mugged with a
marvellous opening conceit: the 'cave' is the mouth of a giant sand monster
and Aladdin is chased from its innards by a roaring, bilious spume of lava.
Further metamorphic fun is sketched in by the villain Jafar and his staff
that becomes a cobra. Then Robin Williams's genie arrives, seizing the
spotlight, the microphone and the movie's transformation franchise.
Williams's performance is less a star turn, more a one-man galaxy expounding
its chaos theory of comedy. When one inspired routine burns out, another
flames up to take its place; all in nanoseconds rather than light years. The
demented tinkling of an air stewardess's voice; Peter Lorre's feline murmur
for a line of necromantic apology ('I can't bring people back from the
dead]'); here some Robert De Niro, there some Bette Midler, there again some
Jack Nicholson. And the vocal gymnastics are matched by visual. The Disney
artists swish their scene-stealer through all the lighting likenesses his
voice invokes, calling on the latest computer technology to do so.
At times the movie's modernist attack can feel like assault and battery. The
princess, in keeping with feminist writ, is less a shrinking violet than a
ballbreaking career girl: I have met her kind behind many a Hollywood
executive desk. And as for Jafar's parrot Iago - need it be quite so
deafeningly vaudevillian in its locutions? 'Oh dat's a big surprise] I tink
I'm gonna die of surprise]' etc.
But why are we complaining of too much energy from a studio that not long
ago, after Walt's death, seemed to be slipping into irreversible coma?
Aladdin and Beauty And The Beast prove there is undreamt-of life both in
Disney and in the art of feature animation. And we we have not even
mentioned the songs. Music by Alan Mencken; lyrics by Howard Ashman and Tim
Rice; and my favourite was not the Oscar-winning 'A Whole New World' but the
preposterous, elephant-swaying, over-the-top, out-Intolerancing-Intolerance
'Prince Ali.' Take the children, buy a sack of popcorn, enjoy.
Half a Mel Gibson is better than no Mel Gibson. But The Man Without A Face,
directed by Mr G, shows how stars do like to put their own charisma through
the mincer whenever they get behind the camera.
'Pizza face]', 'Hamburger head]' - these are among the friendly sobriquets
lobbed by local children at the reclusive ex-schoolteacher with the
burn-ravaged features (Gibson) who lives in a sea-washed mansion in Maine.
Turn our hero to the right and we get a perfect Mel profile. Turn him to the
left and we get Elm Street squishiness. Ergo: it takes no small act of
courage for fatherless young Chuck (Nick Stahl) to approach old pizza-face
and request some tuition for his military school entrance exam. He does not
tell mother (Margaret Whitton); for, good heavens, what would she think?
Especially since the man is suspected of having molested a boy years before,
just prior to his scarring car crash.
Can you think of an odder choice for a movie star's directing debut? Then
you have not followed the fashion in these things. Film idols, when they
become film makers, love to deface or deprecate their own glamour. (See
Eastwood giving us wrinkles-and-all in Unforgiven). It shows that they are
serious artists not just pin-ups. Gibson's film, though, never feels focused
enough to offer either serious art or serious image-critique. Apart from
some vague tut-tutting at small-town gossip and vaguer support for
persecuted sexual minorities - Mel's mystery-man may be gay, even if he is
unjustly suspected of abuse - the movie swills around in a soft stew of
buddyism and surrogate-parent sentimentality, varied by the odd morsel of
red-herring Gothicism.
How we distrust those we do not know. This is the theme for the week's
live-action movies. The Stranger is Satyajit Ray's last film: sedentary,
even sciatic in its staging, but grace-touched in its mastery of faces and
feelings. Is the long-lost uncle (Utpal Dutt) who hoves in view to reclaim a
long-waiting bequest an impostor or not? And how can Mr and Mrs Middle-Class
Calcutta Couple, the supposed relatives with whom he stays, find out without
being rude?
Like all Ray's late films, this one features characters stuck as if by
superglue to the ancestral armchairs. Occasionally, stiffly, they rise to
walk about the room. And always they talk. But do not expect songs,
knees-ups or Aladdin-ish pacing. What you get is a subtler dance of
bewilderment: a soft-shoe shuffle of the soul, a grand old
image-choreographer laying out steps to prove that in this world Nobody
Really Knows Anybody.
Can you even know that your newly-wedded bride is not a serial killer? Mike
Myers, aka Wayne of Wayne's World, has this problem in So I Married An Axe
Murderer. High-street butcher Nancy Travis seems so pretty, so nice . . .
Yet her CV does seem to correspond with that of the multiple murderer
headlined on the front page of the tabloid rag Myers glimpses in his
scandal-hungry parents' kitchen.
This is Hitchcock's Suspicion with swapped sexes and often very funny, not
least when it allows an irrelevant riff to get going. I loved Alan Arkin's
cameo as a kindly police chief begged by his officers to be louder and more
brutal. (They have seen too many TV cop shows.) As for Myers, his moon-faced
sincerity and permanent state of attentive wonder  - the candour of the
apprentice lunatic - suggests there is mileage in this actor's
mock-innocence even after he has finished with Wayne's Worlds 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
. . .
Oh that Myers had wandered debunkingly, a Candide for our age, into the
cumbrous landscapes of Posse and The Stolen Children. The first is a black
Western spurred towards pretension by director-star Mario Van Peebles (of
New Jack City): much racial sermonising, much sculptural posturing in the
mise-en-scene. Gianni Amelio's The Stolen Children is a sentimental,
prize-laden Italian film about two siblings orphaned by the law. Carted off
towards a care home from delinquent Momma - she had put the 11-year-old girl
into prostitution - they pal up with their young escorting officer. Result:
tender, truant wanderings across Italy as humanity begins to glow through
the trio's sullen armour. The idea intrigues; the execution is a touch
maudlin and more than a touch longwinded.

TRUSTEE IN DEBT TO CASINOS, OFFICIALS SAY;
</P>
<P>
GAMBLING: TOM ELY, WHO IS RUNNING FOR COUNTY SUPERVISOR, DENIES INCURRING THE
DEBTS. BUT AUTHORITIES SAY NEVADA OFFICIALS HAVE COMPILED A LIST.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ventura Community College District Trustee Tom Ely has incurred about $40,000
in gambling debts at more than half a dozen Nevada casinos, law enforcement
sources have told The Times.
</P>
<P>
Ely, 54, who is running for the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, owes the
money to some of the best known casinos and hotels in Las Vegas, including the
Aladdin, the Dunes and the Sands, the law enforcement sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Times learned that Nevada officials have compiled a list of alleged Ely
gambling debts that includes $9,000 to the Aladdin, $5,000 to the Dunes, $3,500
to the Sands, $4,700 to Maxim's and $2,000 to Bally's.
</P>
<P>
When asked about those amounts, Las Vegas police Detective Ned Brodeur on
Wednesday confirmed that there is such a list. But he declined to go into
specifics.
</P>
<P>
"That's true," Brodeur said. "You've done your homework."
</P>
<P>
The latest disclosures of alleged gambling debts by Ely followed a report last
week that he owed $3,000 to the Edgewater Hotel and Casino of Laughlin, Nev.,
and a subsequent revelation that he is being sued by another casino, the Golden
Nugget in Las Vegas, over $8,000 in alleged debts.
</P>
<P>
Brodeur said Wednesday that only one of the casinos, the Edgewater, has filed
any complaint with the police. He added that the complaint was dropped this
week after the debt was settled.
</P>
<P>
Most casinos allow indebted gamblers a grace period before seeking police
intervention, Brodeur said, although the debts would be listed with the State
Gaming Control Board of Nevada during periodic casino audits.
</P>
<P>
Ely denied Wednesday that he had incurred the gambling debts, adding that his
attorney has advised him not to comment because "there's all kinds of legal
action coming."
</P>
<P>
Ely said he will remain in the supervisorial race to represent the 4th
District, which includes Simi Valley, Moorpark, Somis and the Santa Rosa
Valley.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody has anywhere near the experience I do," said Ely, who has been an
elected community college trustee, a job that pays $400 a month, since 1979.
</P>
<P>
The state Gaming Control Board of Nevada refused Wednesday to comment on Ely's
alleged indebtedness. None of the casinos would comment publicly either, citing
policies guaranteeing confidentiality for clients.
</P>
<P>
Brodeur said the Edgewater Hotel and Casino's complaint against Ely was for
$3,000 in gambling debts that Ely had incurred last June.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Ely told The Times that he had settled his debts with the Edgewater
in June "in cash."
</P>
<P>
But Brodeur said the casino notified him Wednesday that Ely had sent the $3,000
by express mail over the weekend after learning that a warrant for his arrest
would be issued unless he immediately settled the debt.
</P>
<P>
"There are a million stories in the Naked City, and this is just one of them,"
Brodeur said.
</P>
<P>
Ely also told The Times on Sunday that he did not have a gambling problem and
had not visited Laughlin, Nev., since June, when he and his wife, Ingrid,
played blackjack and the slot machines at the Edgewater.
</P>
<P>
Brodeur disputed that account Wednesday, saying Ely had incurred the bulk of
the debts in Las Vegas after visiting Laughlin in June.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit filed against Ely by the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino on Feb. 20
also refers to a later Nevada gambling debt incurred by Ely in July, charging
that he signed five "markers" for $8,000, to be drawn on his account at Simi
Valley Bank.
</P>
<P>
The suit alleges that when the casino attempted to collect the debt, it found
that Ely's account at the bank had been closed. A source at the bank told The
Times that Ely's account was closed by the bank because it was overdrawn.
</P>
<P>
Trustees on the five-member Ventura Community College Board said Wednesday that
they are concerned that the gambling allegations against Ely will damage the
board's reputation. Two trustees said Wednesday that Ely should consider
resigning or face possible impeachment proceedings or a recall.
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a problem with Tom's credibility, and that disturbs me,"
Trustee Greg Cole said. "I have some grave problems with this -- public office
is a public trust."
</P>
<P>
College Trustee President Greg Kampf said he is concerned about the impact that
the gambling allegations may have on the college board.
</P>
<P>
"It's certainly not a positive thing for the board," he said. "It's not going
to add to the district's reputation."
</P>

FT  21 AUG 93 / Arts: All animated about fairy tales - Tim Burt discusses
Disney's plans to reinvigorate the cinema cartoon / Screen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RENAISSANCE started with a rabbit called Roger. Although a little slow
and rather clumsy, Roger has reinvigorated the world's appetite for an art
form that 10 years ago was said to be facing extinction - the cinema
cartoon.
Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, released by Touchstone in 1988, won critical
acclaim and a couple of Oscars; more importantly, it grossed Dollars 154m
and persuaded Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, there was money in
feature-length animated films.
Disney, concerned at the losses on its theme park investment in Europe, has
decided to increase production of its profitable feature films. In the past,
movies were released at a rate of one every three years; that gap narrowed
last year with Aladdin, Disney's latest offering, following the success in
1991 of Beauty and the Beast. The company now to plans to produce two
feature-length animated films a year and is banking on European expertise to
help draw them.
The US company regards Europe, and London in particular, as a centre for
excellence in modern animation. So the skills which first gained
international recognition with the antics of Roger Rabbit are now being
actively pursued by the most famous studios of them all.
A senior executive from Walt Disney this week arrived in London to recruit
artists for a new generation of animated films. Unlike classics such as Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs, these productions will not be years but months
in the making. Max Howard, vice president of Walt Disney Animation in
Florida, thinks European animators are the ones to make it happen.
Walt Disney, he says, is keen to produce more animated features because,
against all the expectations of the early 1980s, they are proving wildly
popular. Attracted by the new dimensions of Who Framed Roger Rabbit? - the
first widely-distributed feature to use computer technology - cinema
audiences have flocked to see Beauty and the Beast, which grossed Dollars
147m in the US and Pounds 94m in the UK.
In Aladdin, due to be released in the UK later this year, one of the
characters is entirely computer driven. A magic carpet - hand drawn and then
committed to a computer's memory - moves around the screen in a way few
artists could emulate. It turns and twist in three dimensions, offering the
directors camera angles which where previously only available to live film
features.
Howard, who ran the Walt Disney studio in London where Roger Rabbit was
made, believes computers now allow an audience to enter the world of the
cartoon characters. That faith has paid off handsomely. Aladdin has grossed
more than Dollars 212m in the US and Walt Disney expects that figure to
double after its international release.
Audience demand for such special effects has been a major catalyst for
Disney, which intends to employ some of Britain's best animators on future
production such as The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Pocahontas, both
scheduled for release in 1995. There has also been a lucrative spin-off for
other UK talent including lyricist Tim Rice, who is currently working on The
Lion King, Disney's animated African tale, along with actor Jeremy Irons and
rock star Elton John.
At the company's studios in Glendale and Orlando, however, the contribution
of these famous names pales against that of James Baxter, a London art
school graduate recruited by Disney after working on Roger Rabbit. Baxter
went on to create Belle, the feisty heroine of Beauty and the Beast.
The US group's willingness to import overseas talent, however, masks a
growing frustration in the UK that there are no backers willing to
underwrite a home-produce animation feature. Richard Williams, the creator
of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, has failed to complete his long-awaited Thief
and The Cobbler and has returned disillusioned to his native Canada.
Only on television, where Channel Four and SC4 in Wales have invested
heavily in animation, is there a growing market. But even so, many
independent producers feel acclaimed outside the UK and ignored at home.
David Sproxton, co-director of Aardman Animation in Bristol, which last year
won an Oscar for best animated short film, says, 'The fact that Disney can
come here reflects that we do not have resources. We have skills and ideas
but not finance.' He fears that overseas studios are snapping up UK
animators because there is not enough work at home. Without substantial
financial backing, he predicts most animation studios will go on doing what
they do best - making TV commercials.
At Disney, Max Howard admits that funding has been the main brake on UK
animation but suggests that the industry may also have been hindered by the
stories it decided to bring to the screen. Walt Disney is not taking that
kind of risk. It plans to serve up more favourite dishes - fairy tales and
fables. Howard says the productions coming across the Atlantic now contain
fewer spoonfuls of sugar than in the past, but Disney is determined to pour
in enough syrup to keep hold of its biggest audience, the young teenagers.
'Great quality animation won't make a film a success,' he says. 'Look at
Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast. There has been a renaissance, but it's
still about finding the right stories to tell.'

   Singer Kenny Rogers says his six-year separation
from his son, Kenny Jr., ``was detrimental to him, and I think
equally detrimental to me.''
   For six years, starting when Kenny Jr. was 12, the pair didn't
meet or talk, according to an interview in the Dec. 8-10 issue of
USA Weekend. The estrangement began after Rogers and his third
wife, Margo, had what he calls a ``volatile breakup.''
   Over the last six years, father and son have tried to patch up
their relationship.
   They will act out a relationship not unlike the one they have in
real life in a one-hour television drama, ``Christmas in America,''
scheduled to air Wednesday on NBC at 9 p.m. EST. Kenny Sr. plays an
ambitious photographer who is reconciled with his son, Kenny Jr.,
after a period of estrangement.
   The 52-year-old Rogers calls the reconciliation with his son ``a
slow healing process. ... This is a wound that was gaping at one
time and it's growing together.''
   Kenny Jr., now 25, recorded his first album _ ``Yes-No-Maybe'' _
in October. He says that when they met after the six-year gap it
was ``like picking up kind of where we left off.''

   Paul McCartney is singing a slightly different
tune now about a possible Beatles reunion.
   When he suggested last month that he, George Harrison and Ringo
Starr may come together for a reunion, Harrison responded there
wouldn't be one ``as long as John Lennon remains dead.''
   McCartney said Thursday he understood. But he still held out
hope for a reunion.
   ``There can't be a Beatles reunion because John died,''
McCartney told a news conference before his concert at the SkyDome.
   ``And I don't think any of us would be interested in
substituting someone for John, even (his son) Julian, which has
been suggested. But there is a film we might get around to in a
couple of years that we've been meaning to do, and there might
possibly be some involvement there where we play together.''
   He said the group wouldn't call it a Beatles reunion, but the
media probably would.

   Entertainer Wayne Newton's lawyer says if
his client's $5.3 million damage award in a suit against NBC News
is overturned, it would have ``dire consequences to the public.''
   Newton sued the network in 1981, claiming that a series of
broadcasts in 1980 defamed him. The broadcasts linked Newton to
alleged crime figures and centered on his purchase of the Aladdin
Hotel here.
   Lawyer Morton Galane said in a brief filed with a federal
appeals court in San Francisco last month that if the verdict is
overturned, ``victims of malicious defamation by the mass media
will have no effective remedy and the media will not be deterred
from disseminating knowing or reckless falsehoods.
   ``The cost of litigating against a media giant like NBC will
often exceed any compensatory award the victim could hope to
receive.''
   If upheld, Newton's award would be the largest on record arising
from a news report.
   A jury awarded Newton $19.2 million in damages in 1986. The
following year, U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker cut the award to
$5.3 million, but upheld the jury's libel findings. NBC appealed.

FT  26 JAN 94 / International Company News: 'Aladdin' pushes Walt Disney
ahead 34% in first quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Walt Disney, the US entertainment company, yesterday reported a 34 per cent
increase in first-quarter net income, powered by strong US video sales of
its hit cartoon film Aladdin.
However, the results excluded its 49 per cent investment in Euro Disney, the
loss-making theme park near Paris which is about to start full-scale
negotiations with its banks over an emergency re-financing package.
Walt Disney said it had not included Euro Disney because it took a Dollars
350m charge last November to reserve fully against receivables due to it
from the park and its provision of limited and temporary funding to the
business until the end of March.
The treatment underscores Wall Street expectations that Walt Disney will
take a tough line in negotiations with Euro Disney's creditors and will
insist it will not provide funding beyond March 31. If a refinancing were
not agreed by then, the park could close.
Walt Disney reported net income of Dollars 368.6m, or 68 cents a share,
compared with Dollars 275m, or 50 cents, before accounting changes in the
first quarter of last year.
Revenues rose 14 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn. Operating income was up 26 per
cent at Dollars 624.4m.
The best performance came from the filmed entertainment business, which saw
operating income rise 45 per cent to Dollars 340m on revenues 18 per cent
ahead at Dollars 1.4bn.
This was due mainly to the success of the film Aladdin in video cassette
form in the US market, and in cinemas in international markets.
Another factor was the international home video release of Jungle Book.
Disney's theme parks saw operating income rise only 1 per cent to Dollars
138m, on revenues 3 per cent ahead at Dollars 769m.
The company said an increase in occupied room nights at its Florida resorts
and a growth in per capita spending had contributed to the higher results,
but these had been partly offset by slightly lower theme park attendance,
due to the softness in international tourism.
The consumer products segment saw operating income rise 17 per cent to
Dollars 146m on revenues 22 per cent ahead ahead at Dollars 532m.

   Shakeout Helps Makers of Wood Stoves

   Boom Shows How Industry's Woes
   Can Have Silver Lining

   COLVILLE, Wash. -- Sales are booming at Aladdin Steel
Products Inc., largely because of two unlikely forces: the
Environmental Protection Agency and Saddam Hussein.
   Aladdin makes wood-burning stoves here in this remote
corner of northeast Washington state. It emerged from an
industry shakeout that killed off all but about three dozen
of the 300 or so U.S. companies that were making wood stoves
a decade ago. Aladdin and the other survivors are now
profiting from a renewed infatuation with wood as an energy
source. Their present prosperity also shows how an industry's
disaster can sometimes be turned to a company's advantage.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Wood-stove sales in the U.S. last year ran close to
270,000 units, estimates the Wood Heating Alliance, a
Washington, D.C.-based trade group. While that's a far cry
from the more than one-million-unit-sales years of a decade
ago, it's up about 20% from a year before.
   The industry's current prosperity partly reflects the
latest unpredictable turn in the topsy-turvy world of energy
economics. The 1990 run-up in world oil prices following
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last August sparked the concern of
homeowners about rising prices for home heating oil. And in
the fall, overall wood-stove sales took off for the first
time in nearly 10 years.
   Iraq's invasion "unquestionably juiced the market rather
dramatically," says Jack Hughes, chief executive of Vermont
Castings Inc., Randolph, Vt., a large wood-stove maker. Adds
Aladdin's co-owner and vice president Daniel Henry about
Saddam Hussein: "He didn't hurt our industry."
   Sales of Aladdin's Quadra-Fire model stoves reached $5.2
million in 1990, up from $3.2 million the previous year. The
11-year-old company has expanded far beyond its Pacific
Northwest base, shipping stoves to dealers in 42 states. And
notwithstanding the recession, Mr. Henry sees no sign of a
slowdown. "We normally cut back our manufacturing this time
of year, but we're still back ordered, so we're running wide
open," he says.
   But the Middle East crisis isn't the only reason for
Aladdin's success. Aladdin survived an onslaught of rules and
restrictions aimed at wood-stove makers that eventually
crushed a majority of the firms.
   Concerned about noxious wood smoke pollution that shrouded
cities such as Denver; Medford, Ore.; and Missoula, Mont.,
during winter months, state environmental departments in the
mid-1980s began drafting emission standards for wood stoves,
not unlike those required of cars. The EPA made the crackdown
nationwide in 1986. This forced stove makers to develop
ingenious ways to reduce pollution, such as fitting
stovepipes with catalytic converters.
   Wood stoves produced in the late 1970s typically produced
40 to 60 grams of particulate matter an hour. The EPA set an
allowable level of only 4.1 grams an hour for stoves
manufactured after July 1, 1990, that were fitted with
catalytic combustion devices. Stoves without catalytic
devices, favored by Aladdin, are allowed an emission ceiling
of 7.5 grams an hour.
   The EPA regulations effectively wiped out scores of small
stove makers that couldn't bear the cost of redesigning their
stoves to meet the clean air standards.
   "You're looking at $100,000 plus" in design costs and
certification fees, says Ben Myren, a partner at Energy &amp;
Environmental Measurement Corp., a Kent, Wash., laboratory
that tests stoves for the EPA. "It used to be that anyone who
was a welder could build a stove, but it's not a backyard
industry anymore." Adds Mr. Hughes of Vermont Castings,
"You're dealing with survival of the fittest."
   For Aladdin, the air quality crackdown proved a blessing
in disguise. The company was young, without a big investment
in inefficient designs. At a 1984 Oregon trade show, Alan
Trusler, Aladdin's 35-year-old president, recalls that he and
Mr. Henry caught hints of an emerging Oregon wood-stove
emission standard. "We came back, looked at each other, and
said `It's time to get in or get out.' We decided to get in."
   While a lot of manufacturers tried unsuccessfully to
jury-rig their existing models to meet the new air quality
standards, Aladdin chose to scrap its small line of
traditional stoves and develop a new model from scratch. It
took nearly two years of mechanical engineering "and a lot of
sitting in front of the fire," to come up with a
clean-burning design, Mr. Trusler says.
   Adds Mr. Henry: "Tuning a stove is like tuning a car
engine. It's an air-to-fuel problem."
   The two men moved to tiny Colville from Southern
California in 1979, looking for a pleasant rural environment.
Mr. Trusler had a business background. Mr. Henry, now 38, was
a skilled mechanic. "He taught me how to weld," Mr. Trusler
says of his partner, "and I taught him to say `no' to bad
debt."
   Today, a two-shift work force of 72 employees uses $1
million of computer-guided steel plate stamping and cutting
machines to produce 60 firewood-fueled stoves a day. The
plant turns out another 10 to 15 "pellet" stoves a day, an
increasingly popular type of stove that uses tiny pellets of
compressed wood waste as fuel. Mr. Trusler says Aladdin will
sell close to 10,500 stoves of both types in the 12 months
ending March 31 vs. 6,300 a year earlier.
   Aladdin's Quadra-Fire 3100 model was the lowest polluting
noncatalytic stove among 63 models rated by the EPA last
October. It retails for about $1,000. Vermont Castings'
Defiant Encore, at $1,450, was the cleanest burning model
among 85 catalytic stoves tested. The lowest emissions for
seven pellet-fuel stoves was the Venturi PVI-87 made by
Martin Industries Inc., Florence, Ala.

   The race is on to develop new tools that
can make the tiny silicon microchips that will run future
generations of computers.
   ``The prize will be the entire world electronics market of 1996
and beyond,'' said John D. Wiley, associate dean of the University
of Wisconsin's College of Engineering in Madison.
   With West German and Japanese electronics firms already jockeying
for position, an electronic storage ring may just be the best tool
American industry will need to keep pace.
   The special device can produce finely etched computer chips, the
guts of the electronics industry. But building a new one from
scratch could cost $15 million to $20 million, an hefty investment
even for a large company.
   Yet in a cluttered metal building overlooking Lake Kegonsa, the
University of Wisconsin is operating its own ring, dubbed Aladdin,
and is willing to make the device available for industrial research.
   Chips now are manufactured by a process known as lithography, in
which the myriad of components on a chip are printed on the wafer
through the use of light-sensitive films and etching chemicals.
   Aladdin, which is 80-feet in diameter and uses as much
electricity as a small town, can apply 800 million volts of spin to
electrons to produce the ``soft'' x-rays that will allow even finer
etching of computer chips than ultraviolet light can accomplish.
   The only other storage ring in the country that produces soft
x-rays is at Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y.,
and it is booked solid.
   Last week, only 17 of Aladdin's 36 available beam lines were in
use, and the University hopes industry snatches up some of those
still available.
   University scientists say it is time for Aladdin to do industrial
research as well as academic research in x-ray lithography.
   The Japanese have spent an estimated $1 billion to develop the
technology needed to build the new generation of smaller computer
chips, said University physicist David Huber, who is in charge of
Aladdin.
   In the United States, Congress appropriated $15 million for such
research last year and is expected to provide $35 million this year,
Huber said.
   Among private companies in the United States, only computer giant
IBM has invested significantly in the technology, and even it
realizes it cannot carry the research burden alone, he said.
   ``There are 15 new rings now under construction in Japan. There
is only one being built in this country,'' Wiley said. He said the
Germans have had a thriving applied research program in x-ray
lithography since 1978.
   ``If we don't play a role, it's unlikely this country is going to
embrace the technology,'' Huber said.
   ``Assuming the much earlier and larger Japanese and European
investments do not render our program irrelevant before it gets
started,'' Wiley said, ``the U.S. may actually have a chance to
regain a competitive position in this technology.''

<TEXT>
   Donald Trump rubbed a genie's lamp
and lasers lashed the sky to herald the opening of the Taj Majal,
his glitzy new casino.
   But the billionaire real estate developer will need more than
electronic miracles for the city's newest and grandest gambling
emporium to break even in an industry whose growth has slowed
lately, analysts said.
   At the grand opening for the billion-dollar, 1,250-room,
51-story casino-hotel, Trump came on stage Thursday night and
touched an Aladdin's Lamp, setting off a green laser that shot up
to a red ribbon along the hotel's outside, cutting the bow in two.
   A Max Headroom-type genie appeared on a giant screen flanking
the stage and said Trump was ``master'' for making this casino of
``princes and princesses'' and ``genies and magic.''
   Then the fireworks began, watched by thousands of Boardwalk
spectators and celebrities including former heavyweight champion
Michael Spinks.
   Trump was introduced by entertainer Merv Griffin, who in
November 1988 swapped the Taj Mahal with Trump for the adjoining
Resorts Casino Hotel.
   Resorts has since filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws.
   Griffin teased Trump about the gossip swirling around who he
would bring to the ceremony _ his estranged wife, Ivana, or his
alleged paramour, Marla Maples. Trump brought neither.
   ``He brought his father, he brought his mother ... But most of
all he brought me along and I'm very appreciative,'' said Griffin,
whose bankruptcy plan includes a $5 million legal kitty for unhappy
Resorts bondholders who might want to sue Trump.
   Optimists believe Trump's glamorous, gilded casino will attract
more gamblers to Atlantic City. But some analysts were saying the
industry could not support the addition of a casino that requires
an unprecedented $1 million a day to break even.
   Gov. Jim Florio, led by Trump on a tour, said he hoped the Taj
wouldn't drive out Atlantic City's smaller casinos. ``Hopefully,
(the industry) will continue to expand,'' he said.
   The games began Monday at the Taj Majal, and packs of bused-in
gamblers looked up from the craps and slots _ 3,000 machines are
packed in a single room _ to see Trump pacing the premises with his
security guards running interference.
   Women in plumed helmets and short skirts carried drinks and
$2.75-a-pack cigarettes around to the gaming tables. Telephone
operators received incoming calls saying, `Thank you for calling
the Trump Taj Majal, where wonders never cease.''
   The New York Times architecture critic described the resort as a
``themed'' casino, ``one part Las Vegas and one part Disneyland.''
   The Taj Mahal will employ 7,200 people, bringing the city's
casino workforce to 50,000. But city officials have complained
recently that the self-contained casinos have done little for the
depressed city's economy.
   The marble Jacuzzi in the $10,000-a-night Alexander the Great
Suite at the Taj has a vaulted ceiling with three crystal
chandeliers _ and a panoramic view of the burned-out shells of
abandoned buildings that encroach on the casino district.

FT  20 AUG 93 / International Company News: Walt Disney seeks expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALT DISNEY, the US entertainment group, plans to expand its animated film
production following the box office success of Aladdin, its latest feature,
which has grossed more than Dollars 212m in North America.
The company, which last month reported a Dollars 30.9m quarterly loss on its
investment in the Euro Disney theme park near Paris, said it intended to
produce two feature-length animated films a year at studios in California
and Florida.
Mr Max Howard, vice-president of Walt Disney Animation in Florida, said
yesterday the decision 'represents a move back into film-making'.
Although the company expects to make further losses on Euro Disney in the
fourth quarter, Mr Howard denied it was hoping to capitalise on increased
box office demand to offset losses at the theme park.
'We're just maximising every part of our business,' he said. 'Expectations
at Euro Disney have been too short-term. We've built a city there with a
huge infrastructure. The returns will be in the future.'
Mr Howard said the films would be funded by revenue from Aladdin - due to be
released in Europe later this year - and Beauty and the Beast, which has
earned more than Dollars 147m in the US and Pounds 94m (Dollars 140m) in the
UK since 1991.
Walt Disney, which is seeking artists in Europe because of a shortage of US
animators, said new recruits would work on The Hunchback of Notre Dame and
Pocahontas, both scheduled for release in 1995.
Last year's sterling devaluation had made the UK a more attractive location,
Mr Howard said, but the company was more likely to set up a European studio
in France.

FT  13 NOV 93 / Arts: The shape of stars to come - Pyrotechnic wizardry is
taking over cinema screens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALADDIN, Dick Tracy, Batman, Death Becomes Her, Terminator 2 . . . Have you
noticed something odd happening in cinema? It is getting harder and harder
to keep track of well-known faces and appearances. Stars vanish under mounds
of make-up. Actors mutate into cyborgs. Actresses's bodies turn into
avant-garde sculptures. And leading cartoon characters spend whole movies
making lightning transformations, like chameleons on benzedrine. We are in
the age - on screen if not off - of prosthetics, 'morphing',
computer-generated effects and other pyrotechnic wizardry.
Today's transformational impulses are less about regaining glamour, more
about reaching for the fantastical or flabbergasting. In Death Becomes Her,
Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn turned into living Henry Moore sculptures: one
with a hole in her stomach, the other with a torso twisted back-to-front by
a stairway fall. In Batman and Dick Tracy a constellation of stars, from
Nicholson to Pacino, played 'Find me' under layers of Pelion-on-Ossa
character make-up. And in every new sci-fi Schwarzenegger vehicle the hero
and/or pursuing villain are called upon to dazzle us with quick-change
routines.
Terminator 2, the most indelible of these Arnie antics, popularised
'morphing'. This is the computer-created process whereby a hero-chasing
cyborg can seamlessly transform himself from metallic robot to human and
back again: sprouting, whenever he chooses, new limbs and bio-mechanical
weaponry.
Now in Disney's Aladdin, opening in Britain next week, this fascination with
fast-track metamorphosis has entered, or re-entered, what many might think
its natural home: the cartoon. Since opening in America last Christmas
Aladdin has become, according to some Tinseltown auditors, the most
profitable film ever made. Though earning less than its only 1993
out-grosser at the US box office Jurassic Park - Dollars 210m against
Dollars 330m - its production costs were tiny and its revenue outstripped
even Disney's 1992 animation phenomenon Beauty And The Beast.
Aladdin has a mimicry-prone genie (voiced by Robin Williams) who switches
voices and faces so fast, so gymnastically, that it is a rollercoaster ride
merely to keep up. Here is Robert De Niro, here Peter Lorre; now it's Ethel
Merman or Woody Allen or an air-line stewardess. And while the voices
change, so do the features and physique. They swirl in and out of new
likenesses with such speed and virtosity that the Disney technicians had to
use new computer techniques - just like their live-action rivals - since
even the plasticity of traditional animation could not do the job.
As this trend towards show-off Proteanism in the movies grows, the message
for cultural observers is becoming louder. Cinema is feeling time and
fashion's chariot hurrying near. It is not just that an
art-and-entertainment form soon to celebrate its 100th birthday (1995) is
reaching for the revitalisation pills and knocking them back to the point of
overdose. It is that cinema is becoming aware of the threat from video,
video games and computer software: forms that have attracted more and more -
and younger and younger - spectator-participants by demolishing all
frontiers between the Possible and Impossible in visual terms.
Jurassic Park itself, plundering trick-image techniques from these upstart
technologies, proved that the way to collar large audiences today is to meld
cinema's wall-to-wall realism - what is left of it in the age of shrinking
screens - with the perceptual gamesmanship of the new audio-visual systems.
Spielberg's creature feature did this deftly enough to become the
highest-grossing film of all time and to show that in today's ludic
zeitgeist a bunch of agile, capricious dinosaurs can act a bunch of stiffly
traditional human characters off the screen. (The real prehistoric monsters
in this film are Sam Neill, Laura Dern and company.)
Jurassic Park spotlights the most dramatic development of all in these New
Age movies: they make a mockery of what we used to think of as cinema's
charisma essentials. In the past stars and their roles were expected to be
bigger than life. (Video-game heroes and villains are smaller than life and
must make up for it in speed, agility and elastic identity.) And stars,
whatever their roles, were expected to be - at core - changeless. Indeed
what defined them as stars was their ability to stand there being luminously
iconic, giant points of light on a giant screen. Dietrich or John Wayne,
Bogart or Gary Cooper, they 'acted' by sending out small, flickering signals
from a largely monolithic face and voice.
Back in those days transformational showmanship was sidelined into
lunatic-fringe genres like horror, sci-fi or fantasy (The Wizard Of Oz).
Today, though, every genre must be able to flirt with the miraculous, the
metamorphic. (A romantic weepie can have a crackpot cryogenics plot -
Forever Young; a crime-and-gangster film can have a trunkful of masks and
funny faces - Dick Tracy). Likewise every star must join in in the game of
musical identities. Tom Cruise? Bring on the balding wig and wheelchair for
Born On The Fourth Of July. Warren Beatty? Off to the Richard Nixon
Lookalike Laboratory for Bugsy. As for Streep, Nicholson, Pacino, Hoffman
and De Niro: these are character actors who have seized the throne of
stardom today thanks to an age that likes its leading players versatile,
volatile and Olympically unpredictable.
Even the recent history of the Best Actor Oscar bears out the trend. Who
have been getting the statuettes? Day-Lewis, Irons, Hopkins, Pacino: each
for playing a broad-stroke character part ostentatiously removed from the
actor's known personality and traditional run of roles.
Today there are still a few white-bread, no-change male stars like Redford,
Gere, Costner and - since Born On The Fourth as if in contrition - Cruise.
And there are female stars like Cher who go in for the full surgical
overhaul in an oldfashioned bid to become ageless icons. But exceptions
prove rules - or at least draw attention to a new trend by hanging
'endangered' signs around on a stardom style that used to be the norm but
now seems an ever rarer beacon in a crashing, changing sea.
If the waves are starting to beat against these immutables, it is because
the waves are beating against the kind of cinema - and cinemas  - that
nourished them. Movie palaces yield to multiplexes; multiplexes yield to
VCRs. And as even VCRs lose their novelty value, kids are forsaking them for
the new moving pictureland of computer games. Screens shrink; so feature
films make larger gestures and louder noises to get noticed.
In recent years the leading cultural buzz-phrase has been Short Attention
Span. But what cinema is experiencing and reacting to today is more the
Shrinking Attention Zone. Reduced frames of action; larger portions of those
frames annexed by computerwork and other brave-new-worldery; diminishing
room inside for humans who just want to be expansively human.
From now on, shrinking 'delivery systems' may dictate an increasingly manic,
attention-grabbing style of delivery. Films like Demolition Man, Last Action
Hero and Jurassic Park pile on the plot twists, animate the once-inanimate
and push their human players through ever more demanding and eccentric
hoops. Audiences - and critics - had better learn to love the new game-plan
or the game itself may leave them behind. Meanwhile beleaguered old-style
film stars, whose effortless charisma depended on those giant screens with
their giant constancy of image, may have to mimic Gloria Swanson's famous
words in Sunset Boulevard. 'I am big] It's the pictures that have gotten
smaller.'

Walt Disney, the US entertainment group, yesterday joined other film studios
diversifying into video and computer games by launching an interactive
entertainment division.
Mr Michael Eisner, chairman and chief executive, announced the creation of
the division, which will co-ordinate Disney's activities in the games and
educational software markets at its headquarters in Burbank, California.
Disney has in the past licensed the rights to develop video games from its
cartoon and film characters to other companies.
However, it recently devised the successful Aladdin and The Lion King games
in conjunction with Virgin Interactive Entertainment, part of the Viacom
group. Last month it launched two CD-ROM products: the Aladdin Activity
Center and Disney's Animated StoryBook.
The group is now expanding its Disney Software subsidiary into an
interactive division to accelerate its move into games and educational
software.

RANDY LEWIS: A FRIEND OF ORANGE COUNTY MUSIC SCENE PULLS UP STAKES TO TRY HIS
LUCK IN GLITTER CITY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Orange County rock lost a tireless booster of its alternative-music scene with
last week's departure of promoter Jim Palmer for, of all places, Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
But true to his well-deserved reputation as a champion of local music, the
first words out of his mouth, speaking by phone from Sin City, were: "I think
it will be interesting. And I hope I can tap into the local scene here -- or
get one going."
</P>
<P>
Palmer has abandoned his digs here in citrus paradise, where he had worked as a
band manager, booking agent, nightclub manager, record label chief, independent
promoter and all-around friend of local music. He has accepted a job as a
booking agent and promoter at Calamity Jane's, a concert club taken over this
summer by Gary Folgner, owner of the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano and the
Ventura Theatre.
</P>
<P>
He sees it as a good career opportunity, where he will get to work with bigger
acts and agents than he's been accustomed to here. And he promised that he's
not cutting all ties to Orange County. He will continue working with several
bands he helped nurture, including National People's Gang, Imagining Yellow
Suns, Eggplant and others.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Palmer will be back next month to oversee the annual "Orange
County Artists for the Needy" benefit concert, an event he started five years
ago to work as a food- and fund-raiser for disadvantaged Orange Countians as
well as a friendly gathering and celebration for local musicians. This year's
show will be held Dec. 19 at the Coach House.
</P>
<P>
Sadly, the reasons Palmer cited for his decision to leave the county are the
same ones that plague struggling musicians and artists trying to carve out a
career in this affluent region that is "affordable" to an ever-shrinking
segment of the population.
</P>
<P>
"I've wanted to get my family and personal life together and that just wasn't
possible in Orange County because of the money it costs to live there," Palmer
said.
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Within three days of arriving in Las Vegas Nov. 3, Palmer said,
he found a place that he and his girlfriend will be renting. "It's a new
townhouse with two bedrooms, two baths, a wood-buring fireplace, washer and
dryer and the master bedroom has a sunken bath. Something like this would cost
$1,600 in South Orange County; we're paying under $500.
</P>
<P>
"It really is a big difference living here. We live in an apartment complex (in
Fountain Valley) surrounded by $350,000 homes, and we're paying $675 a month
for an apartment that is 25 years old. It's a nice neighborhood, but the
apartment is starting to get run down."
</P>
<P>
"We are each making $24,000 to $25,000 a year but out here you can do so much
more with that; here I can afford to have a family. I've lived in Orange County
for about 24 years, and I'm afraid the place is going to end up like Los
Angeles and New York (where there are) too many people on top of each other,
and people forget about the way people are supposed to treat each other."
</P>
<P>
Palmer, an ex-Marine Corps corporal, also said the sense of increasing urban
violence in Orange County has him worried. "A couple of things started scaring
me. A stone's throw from my house we had a drive-by shooting; this was at a
roller rink and fun center where kids go. . . . It's getting crazy with the
traffic and all these people."
</P>
<P>
Ironically, he also spoke proudly, and optimistically, about the improving
state of the Orange County music scene, which has been languishing without a
solid communal center for years.
</P>
<P>
"I was noticing before I left a splurge of new local clubs starting to happen
-- there are three or four. It's time for that to happen. I think (original
music) is going to be a lot more accepted."
</P>
<P>
He expressed no qualms about trading the often frustrating but equally
exhilarating Orange County music scene for the Lounge Lizard capital of the
world.
</P>
<P>
"That (casino showroom entertainment) is fine for the tourists. But the people
who live here need a musical outlet also. And some of the tourists might
recognize some of the names we'll be bringing in and listen. When I come to
Vegas, I don't necessarily want to see Engelbert Humperdinck.
</P>
<P>
"The people (in bands) I've talked to are really excited about it (because
Calamity Jane's) is a concert venue, not part of a hotel. A lot of people in
the entertainment business would like to work in Vegas . . . if they could
expect a normal, regular concert club."
</P>
<P>
The biggest difference Palmer said he has noticed between Southland musicians
and those in Las Vegas is that "a lot of musicians here can earn $2,000 to
$3,000 a week playing covers (of Top 40 hits) two or three nights at a week at
the Aladdin. So why should they want to come down here and get $100 to open for
the Del Fuegos? But I'm sure there are some people who are in rock bands that
are something besides lounge acts. I haven't seen any garage bands yet, but I
haven't been here long enough."
</P>
<P>
Despite the town's appetite for middle-of-the-road performers such as Wayne
Newton, Palmer plans to apply the perspective he honed in Orange County working
with clubs from the now-defunct Spatz and Safari Sam's to more-recent
affiliations with Bogart's and the Coach House.
</P>
<P>
"There is a big university here (the University of Nevada, Las Vegas). I think
this can be a very successful club, and one of the reasons it hasn't exploded
yet is the lack of having someone here on a full-time basis. There have already

   Harrah's sports book said Wednesday it is
refunding outstanding bets on the Olympic 100-meter race, in which
Ben Johnson was disqualified for steroid use, but other Nevada
books honored similar wagers.
   The Canadian top finisher was stripped of his gold medal, which
was given to Carl Lewis of the United States, who finished second.
   ``It didn't seem fair to pay with Johnson as the winner because
he cheated,'' said Joe Bachman, manager of Harrah's Reno sports
book. ``But Carl Lewis didn't win the race either. If Ben Johnson
wasn't in the race, who's to say what would have happened.''
   Mike Rumbolz, chairman of Nevada's Gaming Control Board which
enforces betting laws, said it is up to each sports book whether to
pay off on disqualified winners.
   Several Nevada bookmakers said the Olympic results should be
treated like a horse race in which bettors are paid off for winners
later disqualified.
   ``In horse racing, when a race is run and the results are
declared official at the finish line, that's that. Bettors are paid
off no matter what happens later,'' said Scott Hall, assistant
manager of the Reno Turf Club.
   The Turf Club did not put out a line on the Olympic matchup. The
Hilton and the Aladdin hotel-casinos and Little Caesars sports
books in Las Vegas joined Harrah's in taking bets on the Friday
race, and all three paid off on Johnson, as did books in London.
   ``We paid off on Johnson because, let me ask you, `who won the
race?,''' said Gene Mayday, manager of Little Caesars. ``Johnson
did. We didn't ask whether he took drugs or not. It doesn't matter.
He crossed the finish line first.''
   ``For betting purposes, Johnson was the winner, is the winner
and will be the winner,'' agreed Art Manteris, director of the Las
Vegas Hilton sports book.
   Bachman said less than $10,000 was bet on the two men at
Harrah's with most of the money on Lewis at 5 to 6 odds. The line
on Johnson was 11 to 10 and was 3 to 1 on any one else in the
100-meter race.
   Odds of 5 to 6 would pay off $5 for each $6 bet, plus the amount
of the wager.
   Half of the Johnson bettors were paid off before Harrah's
decided on the refund, but Bachman would not say how much money
that involved.
   ``We just lost in the deal because we paid off some bets and
then we had to refund, too,'' he said.
   In the future, Harrah's probably will inform bettors at the
window that the winner at the finish line will be paid off, Bachman
said.

he'll have recovered long before you see this programme') which keep the

AN Wilson's promotion campaign for his new book about the historical Jesus

   A volcano will erupt next month on the fabled Strip: a 60-foot mountain spewing smoke and flame every five minutes.

   The man-made inferno will tower over a man-made lagoon with more than four acres of pools, grottoes and waterfalls.
Visitors, whisked from the Strip on a moving walkway, will glide over a habitat for rare white tigers, which will star in performances by the famed illusionist team of Siegfried &amp; Roy.
Nearby, six dolphins will frolic in a 1.5 million-gallon saltwater aquarium.

   At the core of all this stands a hotel.
In the lobby behind its nine-story, orchid-strewn atrium, a 20,000-gallon aquarium will come alive with sharks, stingrays, angelfish, puffers and other creatures of the deep.

   And oh, yes.
There's a casino, the financial heart of it all.

   This is the Mirage, a $630 million island-fantasy hotel-casino now being completed for opening in November by Golden Nugget Inc.
It's the most stunning example of Las Vegas's concerted effort to transform itself into a world-famous vacation resort for families as well as gamblers.
Las Vegas has seen nothing quite like it before.

   Not for 15 years has a big new hotel-casino opened here.
Now the Mirage and Circus Circus Enterprises Inc.'s $290 million Excalibur are going up.
The Excalibur, with a castlelike hotel, jousting tournaments and other Arthurian attractions, will be able to handle up to 30,000 visitors a day when it opens in 1990.

   If MGM Grand Inc. proceeds with its plan for an amusement park -- a $700 million movieland resort with a working studio, casino and 5,000-room hotel that would become Las Vegas's biggest -- the investment in the three properties will total some $1.6 billion.
MGM Grand has agreed to buy a 117-acre site for the resort for $93 million in cash plus stock currently valued at nearly $30 million.

   Smaller projects swell the figure to at least $2.5 billion.
Still other projects that have been announced but not yet started could put expenditures above $3 billion over the next few years.

   Stephen A. Wynn, who owns 29.4% of Golden Nugget's shares, says the Mirage and other projects will help Las Vegas attract a whole new generation of visitors.
"If you create a wonderment, if you create something so exciting that the public dreams of being part of it, then they'll come," he says.
The projects already under construction will increase Las Vegas's supply of hotel rooms by 11,795, or nearly 20%, to 75,500.
By a rule of thumb of 1.5 new jobs for each new hotel room, Clark County will have nearly 18,000 new jobs.
The county at the end of 1988 had 307,000 jobs, 95,400 of them in the tourist industry.
Projects in the talking or blueprint stage would add a further 48,000 rooms.

   Hotel-casino operators play down the possibility of a labor shortage.
After all, 40,000 newcomers a year are settling in the Las Vegas Valley.
But Nevada state labor economists think a shortage is probable.

   Nobody yet seems to have calculated the total number of slot machines, crap tables or roulette wheels Las Vegas will add to the enormous store that Lady Luck already guards here, much less the ultimate impact of the growth on schools and municipal services.

   "Traffic is certainly a concern, as is pollution, water and an adequate labor market," says Frank Sain, executive director of the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Bureau.
City fathers have managed to push through projects that are crucial for tourist growth, such as the expansion of McCarran International Airport to accommodate the 44% of Las Vegas tourists who fly here.
This year, by one means of transport or another, more than 18 million people will visit the city.

   The expansion will set off a marketing war among the big hotel-casinos.
Las Vegas promises, or threatens, to become a giant carnival, with rooms to be had for $45 a day or less, for visitors uninspired solely by gambling.
Amid a riot of jousting knights, circus clowns, gold-leaf centurions and creatures of the wild, lesser competitors will fall.

   Caesars World Inc. plans to defend its august reputation by sinking $190 million into its opulent Caesars Palace, next door to the new Mirage, and adding a $100 million shopping area reminiscent of Rodeo Drive.
The Palace, with its marble fountains and toga parties for high rollers, is already well-known for its Caesarean theme.
The Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace, Frontier and others are pouring millions of dollars into facelifts, new room towers and casino floor space just to keep up.

   Where's this huge amount of investment capital coming from?
Golden Nugget, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s first casino client, has borrowed on more than $600 million worth of mortgage notes, mostly sold to private investors by Drexel, to build the Mirage.
Other casino owners, Circus Circus among them, are financing their expansion with their own cash and revolving credit lines from local lenders such as First Interstate Bank of Nevada.

   Will the investments pay off?
The growth of Las Vegas tourism in recent years persuades lenders that they will.
Casino revenues and hotel occupancy rates are high.
Last year, the tourists left $3 billion with the area's casinos, nearly 10% more than in 1987.
The people with a stake in Nevada's gambling industry believe that they have barely tapped the potentially huge family trade.

   "If you build a better mousetrap, it will catch more mice," says Fred Benninger, chairman of MGM Grand.
Ellen Cokely, a tourist from Alton, Ill., seems inclined to agree.
"I'd love it if my daughter had something else to do here," says Ms. Cokely, watching seven-year-old Kristin on the water slide at the Strip's Wet `n' Wild water park.

   "Two generations ago, Dad came to Las Vegas by himself for a little diversion," says Van Heffner, executive vice president of the Nevada Hotel and Motel Association.
"One generation ago, Mom joined Dad.
Now, in the `90s, we're headed toward a total resort environment."

   Only a decade or so ago, casino managers balked at in-room TV sets and other fripperies that distracted from gambling.
Casinos today offer bowling alleys, water parks, golf courses, tennis courts, lush swimming pools and other diversions, and more such facilities are being designed.

   Despite the new emphasis on the family trade, however, tourists in search of naughtier fun than gambling seem certain to find it, with Las Vegas call girls remaining on the scene.

   A serious economic downturn, pessimists observe, could hurt the expansionists.
For now, however, the naysayers' voices are drowned by the roar of cement mixers and the clanging of construction cranes along the Strip.
This is no place for pedestrians, but at 7:30 on a recent morning, when construction choked traffic at the famous Four Corners intersection to one lane, a taxi passenger found it faster to abandon the cab and walk to her destination.

   The ferocious competition probably will drive some poorly managed properties into bankruptcy or new ownership.
It has happened before.
The Dunes, the Aladdin and the Riviera were all acquired by the present owners from bankruptcy proceedings spawned by the last recession, in the early 1980s.

   Yet that hasn't discouraged investors.
Some have bought big chunks of Strip property for what may turn into another wave of building.
Atlantic City casino owner Donald Trump is scouting the Las Vegas market with an eye toward building an appropriately spectacular place.

   Even before the huge new projects began, the Strip's recent expansion squeezed smaller competitors.
Many blue-collar customers of downtown's no-frills gambling spots have been lured to the Strip or to Laughlin, Nev., a Colorado River town catering to snowbirds and the recreational-vehicle crowd.
Hotel expansion and an influx of more-discriminating tourists have hurt motels.
Since 1979, the number of motel rooms has fallen by 17,000.

   Many people here expect a room-rate war as the new projects open.
"There's probably going to be some pressure on occupancy and room rates over the next year, but after that you should see the market return to 80%-plus occupancy and regular rates," says Paul Rubeli, casino executive at Ramada Inc., which runs the Tropicana.

   Skeptics wonder whether mega-resorts such as the Mirage will be able to squeeze a profit from their cash flow.
The Mirage will cost at least $1 million a day to operate.
Mr. Wynn seems confident that it will produce a healthy profit, but some securities analysts doubt it.
Competitors and analysts say that among large existing properties Bally Manufacturing Corp.'s Bally Grand hotel-casino probably will be hardest hit among major properties.
Bally officials decline to discuss the situation.

   Bally bought the former MGM Grand hotel-casino from Kirk Kerkorian four years ago.
Only now is it undergoing a badly needed facelift.
Its parking lot is inconvenient, the MGM lion's-head logo still appears in places, and customers still call it the Grand, rather than the Bally Grand.
It has a "great location, but they're going to have some real problems when everyone around them opens," says Daniel Lee, a Drexel analyst.
Older properties that still have a 1950s image are also vulnerable.

   Any hotel-casino without a strong identity will get whacked by the new competition, says Glenn Schaeffer, senior vice president of Circus Circus.
"If you don't know what you are, bigger won't make you better," he says.
"But it'll sure make you poorer."

   Circus Circus's flagship casino has become the envy of competitors for its ability to vacuum cash from the pockets of vacationing families.
The Circus Circus lures them with low room rates, inexpensive buffets and entertainment for children at no extra charge.
The company's Excalibur will also appeal to families, of course.
Its castle, Mr. Schaeffer says, will be "the most compelling piece of folk architecture ever built."

   Some casino owners have resisted the temptation to add rooms.
Instead, they are spending to reinforce the identity that they believe attracts their customers.
"More rooms aren't the answer for us," says Caesars World chairman Henry Gluck.
While his company's hotel is building a retail complex in Beverly Hills style and redoing existing rooms, it has decreased the number of its rooms.
Some have been combined into suites for the high rollers.

   Caesars has made a specialty of catering to high rollers from abroad, who are also being aggressively courted by the Mirage, the Las Vegas Hilton and others.
Other, smaller concerns are also pursuing market niches -- Hawaiian tourists, for example, or the local trade.
"There's still room for boutique properties," says James Barrett, president of MarCor Resorts Inc. Off the Strip, MarCor is building the Rio, a hotel-casino with a Brazilian theme and only 430 rooms -- all of them suites.

   Despite the proliferation of tourist distractions, Las Vegans haven't forgot that gambling is still what the town is all about.
"The days when when the thrust of casinos was all high rollers, with no windows and clocks and lots of red and black decor, are gone," Mr. Sain of the visitors' bureau says.
"But 93% of tourists still come for gambling.
We can't lose sight of that."

<HEAD>Bally Restructuring Continues With Plans to Spin Off Hotel-Casino
Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bally Manufacturing Corp., which last month
disclosed the sale of its pinball-machine and video-game
businesses, is taking an even bigger restructuring step by spinning
off its hotel-casino group to its shareholders.
   Bally announced the planned restructuring late Thursday and said
it planned to maintain a 15 percent stake in the hotel-casino
business, which accounted for about half its $1.73 billion in sales
last year.
   The move is intended to boost Bally's stock price by creating
two separate companies and ``by permitting the separate management
of each company to pursue specific business opportunities on an
independent basis,'' Bally spokesman William Peltier said in a
statement.
   Bally's stock closed up 12{ cents at $22.75 Thursday in
composite New York Stock Exchange trading. The restructuring was
announced after the market closed.
   Bally's stockholders will receive as a tax-free dividend one
share of common stock in the hotel-casino business for each share
of Bally Manufacturing they own on the effective date of the
spin-off.
   The company, the creator of Pac-Man, Space Invaders, and other
video-game hits, announced last month it was selling its
pinball-video manufacturing business on which the company was
founded for about $8 million to rival WMS Industries Inc., parent
of Williams Electronics Games.
   Bally will retain all of its other leisure and manufacturing
businesses, which consist of Bally's Health &amp; Tennis Corp., a chain
of 250 fitness centers; the Aladdin's Castle chain of more than 300
video arcades; the Scientific Games division, which manufactures
lottery equipment; Life Fitness Inc., a maker of exercise
equipment; and a slot-machine manufacturing division.
   The arrangement should allow the stock price of each
publicly-traded company to more accurately reflect Bally's
underlying value, the company said in a statement.
   Bally's health and fitness operations and the gaming equipment
divisions accounted for roughly 43 percent of the company's revenue
last year.
   Bally indicated it expected each of the separate companies to
post more than $1 billion in revenue this year.
   Lee Isgur, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York, said
the company had been expected for some time to pursue some type of
restructuring.
   ``You could have the value of the two asset groups appreciate
significantly from where they are today,'' Isgur said. ``Diverse
groups of investors can focus on the group that most attracts
them.''
   Isgur said he began recommending Bally's stock last spring, when
it was trading around $16.
   Wall Street has regarded Bally as ripe for a restructuring due
to a relatively weak stock price stemming from an erratic
performance in several ventures, such as its video game business.
   Bally made big profits from the business during the video game
craze of the late 1970s and early 1980s, but earnings tumbled when
the games' popularity declined. Bally wrote off much of the video
game business in 1984 after it lost more than $100 million.
   Bally fended off a takeover overture from real estate developer
Donald Trump in 1987, paying a premium to buy Trump's 9.9 percent
stake in the company.
   The hotel-casino company will operate two Atlantic City casino
hotels, Bally's Park Place and Bally's Grand; and two casino hotels
in Nevada, Bally's Las Vegas and Bally's Reno.
   Consumation of the spin-off will require approval from New
Jersey and Nevada authorities and the Internal Revenue Service,
according to Bally, which also plans to seek stockholder approval.

   Irving ``Ash'' Resnick, a longtime gaming figure
credited with bringing high rollers to the Las Vegas Strip, died
Wednesday. He was 72.
   Resnick died of heart failure at 1:45 a.m., said Humana Hospital
Sunrise spokeswoman Ann Lynch. He had been hospitalized after a long
bout with cancer.
   His forte was bringing high rollers to Las Vegas casinos for
high-stakes gambling, and he organized the first junkets that later
became a fixture to the casino trade.
   Resnick's Las Vegas career spanned four decades and included
stints at Caesars Palace, the Aladdin, the Dunes, the Tropicana, the
old El Rancho and Thunderbird hotels, and most recently the Maxim
Hotel.
   He was credited with starting the first baccarat game at the
Dunes. Baccarat is now featured at most Strip hotels.
   In 1974, Resnick was convicted of income tax evasion while
employed at Caesars Palace. The government alleged that Resnick
skimmed more than $300,000 from Caesars and failed to pay taxes on
it. The decision was later overturned.
   He also was troubled by allegations he had organized crime
associates and twice was the apparent victim of murder plots. In
1974, eight sticks of dynamite were found under his car and two
years later he was shot at while leaving Caesars Palace.
   Resnick, a former star basketball player at New York University,
also brought big-time boxing shows to Las Vegas.

   Las Vegas Confronts Economic Crunch
   As Rapid Expansion Bumps Into Slump

   Las Vegas, Nev., the fastest growing city in the nation,
faces an economic squeeze.
   The city's ambitious development plans are coming to
fruition just as the regional economy is beginning to slow.
Even as the city's gambling industry is adding thousands of
new hotel rooms, many casinos have been laying off workers.
And just as thousands of new homes are ready to go on the
market, housing sales are falling.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Las Vegas is an accident waiting to happen," says David
Shulman, a Salomon Brothers economist who tracks real estate
markets. "The only reason Las Vegas has been booming is
because it was on the periphery of Southern California. Now,
that's stopped and things are bound to change."
   Exciting new projects and aggressive marketing could help
the casinos goose their gambling numbers for a while --
barring a shooting war in the Mideast that plays havoc with
fuel supplies. But the same can't be said in the housing
industry, where out-of-state wealth has fueled growth over
the past decade.
   As a city that thrived on the free-spending ways of
others, Las Vegas was made for the 1980s. It grew up during
those years from a purely gambling town to a destination
resort attracting families and conventioneers. While gamblers
spent money wildly, builders transformed the Las Vegas
valley's dirt roads, rock and sand into a carpet of housing
developments, man-made ponds and golf courses. Jobs, crisp
desert air and the cheap cost of living lured immigrants from
around the country, and the population nearly doubled, to
780,000 residents from fewer than 450,000.
   "We are now a mature and diverse community that just
doesn't have the same reliance on casino gaming as it once
did," boasts Don Haze, a commercial real estate broker who
opened a Coldwell Banker commercial leasing office in 1981.
   But a lengthy downturn could undo some of the
image-building that Las Vegas underwent in the 1980s. "You
must remember that the people who have been successful in
this town have always had their feet on the gas pedal," says
R. Keith Schwer, of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas's
Center for Business and Economic Research. When the city was
hit by the recession of 1981, tourism spending grew a little
less than 1%, though visitor volume posted a slight decline.
"The movers and shakers have not been conditioned to deal
with great economic downturns," Mr. Schwer says.
   The recession in the early '80s spurred city leaders to
mount a campaign to help Las Vegas break out of its
dependency on the casino industry. In 1983, the Nevada state
Legislature passed a law permitting interstate banking that
led Citibank to move its credit card distribution center to
Las Vegas. Today, 2,000 people work there. By contrast, the
city's huge new Mirage casino employs about 7,000.
   But almost no major companies have followed Citibank's
lead. The Nevada Development Authority estimates that in the
past two years only 3,103 new jobs were created by private
sector firms either expanding or moving into Nevada. As a
result, experts say, the economy still lacks the diversity
that would help it weather another prolonged downturn.
   Still, Las Vegas isn't Phoenix, and there haven't been any
billion-dollar thrift seizures or distressed land sales yet.
Even the most pessimistic economists expect Nevada's
population growth to remain healthy. What's more, the
national credit crunch has saved developers from building
projects with no prospect of success.
   "What we need to do now is take a few deep breaths," says
Donald Snyder, chairman and chief executive of First
Interstate Bank of Nevada, a unit of First Interstate Bancorp
and Nevada's biggest bank.
   Las Vegas does have excesses that are uniquely its own.
Huge new Disney-like facilities such as the 3,000-room Mirage
and the 4,000-room Excalibur have forced the industry into a
Darwinian struggle in which older, undercapitalized
facilities are falling behind more modern competitors.
   "The strong will survive," says Golden Nugget's chairman,
Stephen Wynn, whose $710 million Mirage continues to lure
crowds from neighboring casinos. "But I am worried about some
of our competitors. You can't just build boxes, rent out the
rooms and get by anymore."
   Size is no indicator of success, either.
   Bally Manufacturing Corp., one of the nation's biggest
gambling companies, has defaulted on its casino debt, and it
has trimmed its staff by 600 workers. Other big names have
also hit cold streaks. At Hilton Hotels Corp., high-roller
competition from the Mirage and Caesars Palace has cut into
operating profit, which fell 50% in the third quarter. Now
Hilton, Nevada's biggest employer, plans to trim operating
costs -- and staff -- in Las Vegas by about 8%. Altogether,
that means layoffs of more than 500.
   Other once-proud Las Vegas names have been tarnished by
closings and bankruptcy filings. The Landmark hotel and
casino shut its doors earlier this year; the Aladdin has
filed for bankruptcy protection and is slated for auction.
Meanwhile, aging casinos like the Dunes and the Stardust have
struggled to keep pace.
   And even before the town has recovered from the one-two
punch of the Excalibur and Mirage, the industry faces another
challenge from MGM Grand Inc.'s Kirk Kerkorian, who has vowed
to forge ahead with plans for a 5,000-room megafacility. Add
to that the Riviera's 1,600-room new wing, the Stardust's
additional 1,200 rooms and dozens of other projects on the
boards, and further fallout appears certain.
   "It's what I call the rule of 500," says Alan Pomerantz, a
real estate attorney with Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges in New York
City. "If a city projects a need for 500 hotel rooms, then
500 developers will build 500 hotels each with 500 rooms."
   The rule of 500 appears to apply to residential
developers, as well. While the twin engines of Las Vegas's
housing growth -- the casino industry and the spillover from
the California market -- are beginning to sputter, housing
starts continue to climb. Over the next year, builders have
applied for permits to put up more than 49,000 housing units
in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas.
   Tight credit could keep as many as 30% from being built,
says Glen Barton of the Meyers Group, a market research
company based in Los Angeles. But that would still leave
34,000 new homes and apartments to absorb.
   Economists cite another disturbing trend in Las Vegas's
growth pattern: A full 8.1% of all payroll workers are in the
construction sector, suggesting that there aren't enough
indigenous industries to pick up the slack once things quiet
down.
   And home buying has begun to taper off. According to the
Meyers Group, the number of home sales in the third quarter
dropped 27.3% from a year earlier, while the inventory of
unsold homes was up 15.4%.
   Consider the case of Leon Cohen, a 75-year-old former real
estate broker from Encino, Calif. He cashed in on the
California real estate boom last year and moved to the
serenity of the Nevada desert, where he lives in Del Webb
Corp.'s Sun City, a planned community. As a retiree and
former Californian, Mr. Cohen is the type of resident Las
Vegas planners dreamed of when they imagined an economy freed
from the cyclical whims of the gambling industry.
   But there may not be many Leon Cohens left. "With the
California real estate market going down, I'm sure I couldn't
have made my deal today," he says. "I was lucky things went
so well in California when they did."
   Some development companies are betting that any slowdown
will be brief and are plunging ahead with ambitious projects.
One is a 25-village city-within-a-city called Summerlin,
developed by Howard Hughes Properties. Designed on 39 square
miles of property, the project won't be completed until early
next century. Construction has already begun on Lake Las
Vegas, a $3.5 billion project bankrolled by the Bass brothers
on 2,200 desert acres.
   "We all know there'll be a slowdown here, just like
there's going to be one everywhere," says Coldwell Banker's
Mr. Haze. "But they used to say that when California got a
cold, Las Vegas got pneumonia. Now I think when California
gets its cold, we just might only get a case of sniffles."

   A California real estate marketing company has
been retained to sell the bankrupt Aladdin Hotel and Casino after
months of behind-the-scenes efforts failed to find a buyer.
   Representatives of Santa Monica-based Kennedy-Wilson Inc. said
they would advertise the property in the United States and abroad,
and would accept sealed bids until Nov. 15.
   Officials hope the responses will produce someone who can
qualify financially and be able to obtain a gaming license. The
responses will be evaluated by the bankruptcy trustee in hopes of
locating a buyer, although bids could be rejected, officials said.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Linda Riegle will have the final say on
who buys the Strip property.
   The troubled resort has been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection since last October. It was placed in bankruptcy by the
late Ginji Yasuda, who bought the property out of bankruptcy in
1986 for $54 million, then spent another $35 million refurbishing
it. Yasuda died of cancer in December.
   An attorney representing the bankruptcy trustee said efforts had
been made to assist parties showing an interest in the hotel, but
it was finally decided to hire a professional firm to market the
resort.

<HL> Judge Throws Out Most
Of Newton Libel Judgment</HL>

   A federal judge yesterday threw out all but $5.3 million of the record $22.8 million libel judgment won by Wayne Newton against National Broadcasting Co. for news stories linking the singer to organized crime figures.

   U.S. District Judge Myron Crocker, in upholding the liability portion of the jury award, ruled that Mr. Newton had proved by "clear and convincing evidence" that NBC had defamed him.

   But the judge cut nearly $17.5 million awarded for damage to Mr. Newton's reputation and loss of earnings.
He said the evidence didn't support Mr. Newton's allegation that the broadcasts hurt his reputation or cut his earnings.

   New York-based NBC is a unit of General Electric Co. NBC attorney Floyd Abrams said the network will continue to appeal the verdict.

   "We are pleased the damages have been significantly reduced but still believe they are far beyond any amount that could possibly be sustained," he said.
"It still is a loss in the sense that the judge is assuring the jury verdict of liability."

   "It's a big victory for Wayne Newton," said Mr. Newton's attorney Morton Galane.
"It vindicates him completely, and it's still the biggest libel award in history."

   Mr. Galane said Mr. Newton hasn't decided whether to accept the reduced damages or seek a new trial on damages only.
