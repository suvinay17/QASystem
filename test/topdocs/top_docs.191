DIVIDE JOB TO CONQUER BUILDING OF A PARTITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Although the trend in home design is toward open, undivided spaces, there are 
still times when you may actually want to divide big spaces up into smaller 
ones. Building a walk-in closet is one reason. So is adding a darkroom or maybe 
a soundproof music room. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the reason, the thing that gets the job done is the partition, a 
simple structure that any homeowner with a saw and hammer should be able to 
build. 
</P>
<P>
Before you build a partition, draw it out to scale. This will help you 
visualize the job and will make it easy to compile a shopping list for lumber. 
</P>
<P>
At the very minimum, you'll need 2-by-4 top and bottom plates, plus 2-by-4 
studs spaced every 16 inches on center. If you're framing for a door, you'll 
need two or three extra studs for the trimmers, plus a six-foot 2-by-6 and a 
scrap of half-inch plywood for the header. 
</P>
<P>
The door itself? A simple prehung flush door is the easiest to install. These 
come in a variety of widths from 18 to 36 inches. A 30-incher is a good 
all-around size. 
</P>
<P>
You'll also need a few pounds of 16-penny nails and a few pounds of eightpenny 
nails to put everything together. 
</P>
<P>
You have a choice of two ways to frame the wall. One is to assemble the whole 
thing lying flat, then stand it up and nail it in place. The other is to build 
the wall in place. Which is better? 
</P>
<P>
Building flat on the floor is usually easier. Everything is easy to reach, and 
you can nail through the plates into the ends of the studs rather than 
toenailing. But, if your walls, floor and ceiling are irregular, a preassembled 
wall may not fit properly without a lot of shimming and adjusting. Building the 
wall in place makes more sense under these conditions. 
</P>
<P>
For a flat assembly, start by marking the location of the proposed wall on the 
floor. If possible, locate the partition so you can nail the top plate into the 
ceiling joists. If this isn't possible, you'll have to cut 14 1/2-inch lengths 
of the same lumber used for the joists (usually 2-by-8 stock) and nail them in 
crosswise every 16 to 20 inches between existing joists. This will give you 
something to nail your top plate to. 
</P>
<P>
Back down on the floor, cut your top and bottom plates to length and mark off 
the positions of your studs, 16 inches on center. Keep this 16-inch interval 
constant, even if a door opening interrupts the flow. 
</P>
<P>
Next, measure your floor-to-ceiling height and subtract three inches. This 
gives you the length of your studs. Cut them all to this length and secure them 
to the top and bottom plates, using a pair of 16-penny nails through the plate 
and into each end of the stud. 
</P>
<P>
If you are framing in a door, size the rough opening 2 1/2 inches wider than 
your door and one inch higher. This will give you room to shim and adjust the 
door frame properly later on. Next, nail together a header from two layers of 
2-by-6 with a layer of half-inch plywood sandwiched between. Cut this to length 
and nail it in place with 16-penny nails. Then cut your trimmer studs to 
length, nail them in place, and finally, add the little cripples above the 
header. 
</P>
<P>
Now you can stand the wall up. Make sure the bottom plate is positioned 
properly and tack it in place with a couple of nails. If you are working on a 
concrete floor, use concrete nails. Carefully plumb the wall, using a 
carpenter's level to make sure it is dead vertical in both directions. If the 
wall is a bit short in spots, you may have to slip shims between the top plate 
and the ceiling. A piece of cedar shingle works well. 
</P>
<P>
When everything is positioned to your satisfaction, nail through the top plate 
into the ceiling joist or your previously installed blocking, and nail through 
the bottom plate into the floor. But don't nail through the section of bottom 
plate running across your door opening. Instead, saw this section out and throw 
it away. You can now install your door, and finish off with drywall or 
paneling. 
</P>
<P>
For in-place assembly, start by cutting top and bottom plates to length and 
marking them off for proper stud placement. Install the top plate first, 
nailing through it into the ceiling joists or into blocking. Once the top plate 
is in place, install the bottom plate, locating it directly beneath the top 
plate by using a plumb bob. Fasten the bottom plate in place by nailing it to 
the floor. If you will be framing in a door, do not nail the bottom plate down 
in the area of the opening. 
</P>
<P>
Once both plates are in, measure each stud individually to fit its space. 
Install the studs by toenailing with your eightpenny nails, driving in a pair 
of nails from each side of each stud, both top and bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Frame your door opening as described above. Then cut out the section of bottom 
plate spanning the door opening and you are ready to install the door and 
finish off the wall.

DRYWALL PROJECT? SKILL WITH KNIVES IS THE KEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Drywall -- also called wallboard, gypsum board or plasterboard -- is probably 
the most versatile and forgiving wall surface available today. 
</P>
<P>
Less expensive and easier to apply than plaster, it can be frustrating to work 
with in the finishing stages, as it requires some skill with at least three 
sizes of compound knives -- 3, 6 and 10 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Individual drywall panels, called boards, come in a common width of 4 feet, in 
lengths from 8 to 16 feet in 2-foot increments. Thickness starts at 1/4 inch 
and progresses by 1/8-inch increments to 3/4 inch. The most common size, by 
far, is 4 by 8 feet by 1/2 inch. 
</P>
<P>
Each board consists of a gypsum core covered with heavy paper on both sides. 
The ends are cut square exposing the core. The long edges have a tapered 
depression about 1 1/2 inches wide for the paper and joint compound that makes 
a seamless surface between panels. 
</P>
<P>
Start your installation with the ceiling, and install any electrical boxes or 
fixtures first. Cut matching holes before applying panel cement to the bottom 
of the joists with a caulking gun and raising the board. Adhesive makes a 
stronger bond and reduces the number of nails required. 
</P>
<P>
Make it easier to hold ceiling boards in place by tack-nailing a 40-inch-long 
2-by-4 to the wall about an inch below the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
Support one end of the ceiling panel on this cleat while you raise the other 
end and nail it in place. Then move the cleat for the next panel. Use 1 
5/8-inch-long drywall nails 8 inches apart around the perimeter and across the 
face of the board into every joist that's covered. Dimple, or slightly recess, 
the nail heads into the paper for future filling. 
</P>
<P>
The same methods cover the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Place panels horizontally so you won't have to apply joint tape while climbing 
a ladder. Remember to minimize butt joints with their taping bulges. Push the 
upper wallboards tight against the underside of the ceiling boards. This 
drastically reduces future cracking. If the ceilings are eight feet or lower, a 
second board around the perimeter of the room does the job, but higher ceilings 
in older homes take a third, partial board. 
</P>
<P>
Finish in four steps: apply joint compound, embed paper tape in it directly 
over the joint line, cover the tape with more compound and let it dry before 
skimming the joint with a final very thin layer of compound. There are probably 
as many ways of doing this as there are professional drywall installers, but 
for beginners, the three-knife method works well. 
</P>
<P>
Start compounding a tapered joint with the six-inch knife. Hold the knife at a 
30- to 45-degree angle to the joint, pressing the compound into the depression. 
Then wipe off the excess. 
</P>
<P>
Tear off a length of tape to cover the entire joint. Press it in place with 
your fingertips and then lightly smooth it in place with the three-inch knife. 
If you see a bubble under the tape when you finish there is too little compound 
in the joint. Fixing this is impossible. Remove the tape and start over. 
</P>
<P>
Once the tape is embedded, cover it with another layer of compound with the 
six-inch knife. Smooth the joint with the 10-incher. Let the joint dry for a 
day and then sand with 120-grit paper. 
</P>
<P>
Finish up by lightly sanding the whole job and applying a very thin skim coat 
of compound to each joint. Wait a day for it to dry, sand the whole job with 
180-grit paper and touch up imperfections before priming and painting.

FAKE BEAMS CAN HIDE CRACKS, OTHER DEFECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. J. HAND, Distributed by Los Angeles Times Syndicate. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking for a way to hide a persistent ceiling crack? Want to hide those ugly 
steel posts in your basement? Like to give ordinary drywall a post-and-beam 
Tudor look? 
</P>
<P>
You can accomplish all these goals and more with fake beams. Although most 
lumberyards sell realistic-looking beams made of plastic, I prefer to make my 
own, using ordinary 1-inch lumber. 
</P>
<P>
A good all-around size is 1-by-6. They give you a finished beam 5 1/2 inches 
wide, that looks about right in most cases. 1-by-4s look a little bit skimpy, 
and 1-by-8s, a little large. 
</P>
<P>
If you can find rough-cut cedar, by all means use it. This will automatically 
give your beams a rustic look. You can also use ordinary pine and rough it up a 
bit after it's assembled to give it that hand-hewn, rustic look. 
</P>
<P>
Let's make a ceiling beam first. Here is the basic beam-building technique. To 
start, buy three 1-by-6s at least as long as your intended beam. 
</P>
<P>
When you get them home, cut each of these to length. Next, bevel both edges of 
one piece to a 45-degree angle. This will be the bottom of the beam. Then bevel 
one edge of each of the other two pieces. These will be the sides of the beam. 
You can cut your bevels with a table saw, radial arm or a portable circular 
saw. 
</P>
<P>
Now glue and nail these three pieces together as shown in the sketch. Use 
ordinary white or yellow glue, and six-penny (2-inch) finishing nails. Let the 
glue dry for an hour and then the beam is ready to install. 
</P>
<P>
To do this, cut some scrap lumber to a width that will fit snugly inside the 
open top of your beam. Any old scraps of 1-inch pine or 3/4-inch plywood will 
do. Now take these scraps and fasten them to the ceiling, along the line you 
want your beam to follow. If you are using your beam to hide a crack, you can 
simply nail these scraps in place. There will be a ceiling joist directly over 
the crack. 
</P>
<P>
Now you can slip the beam up over this line of scraps and secure it to them 
with finishing nails. If you want to finish the beam -- maybe staining it to 
look old and dark -- you should do so before hanging it. This way you won't 
have to worry about getting any finish on the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
You can use this same technique for installing "antique" posts on your wall. 
This is an easy way to cover the joints between sheets of dry wall and thus 
eliminate the job of taping. Let's say you want to finish off a basement. Do 
the walls with gypsum board. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of taping and carefully covering all the nail heads, just smear on a 
rough coat of wallboard compound with a trowel to get that rustic, 
hand-plastered look. Then cover all the joints between sheets with posts and 
you have a Tudor basement. As a bonus, you can also use these posts to hide 
plumbing or new electrical runs. 
</P>
<P>
Hiding Posts. To cover up those ugly steel posts in your basement, you'll have 
to modify your technique somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of making a three-piece beam, you need to use four pieces. And you'll 
have to bevel all four corners. Glue and nail three of the four pieces together 
and slip the beam around your post. 
</P>
<P>
Then glue and nail on the fourth side to complete the job.

<DESCRIPT>  BUILDING  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  DIVIDING a room by erecting a partition wall requires moderate carpentry
skills but is seldom difficult. Planning and preparation are the keys.;   
Essentially, a partition wall consists of strips of lumber fastened together
to form a rectangular framework. This is strengthened by vertical strips,
called studs, installed at regular intervals inside the perimeter.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Peninsula Home  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  A ROOM DIVIDED: HOW TO ERECT WALL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The framework's top piece, called the plate, is attached to the ceiling;
its bottom piece, the sill, is attached to the floor. Doorways and other
openings are often included. Wallboard or some other paneling covers the
framework on both sides.;    If space permits, constructing the framework
horizontally and then tilting it into place for fastening to the ceiling and
floor is usually the easier method, because attaching the studs to the sill
and plate is simplified.;    But in most cases, lack of space dictates that
the framework be constructed vertically, beginning by attaching the plate and
sill to the ceiling and floor respectively, and then installing the studs
between them.;    How to begin;  Begin by checking with a local building
inspector to find out whether a building permit or inspection is needed and
whether you must include firestops.;    These are horizontal strips fastened
between the studs to prevent a wall from acting as a flue during a fire.
Installing wiring or plumbing inside a wall almost always requires both a
permit and an inspection before any paneling is attached.;    Next, estimate
and obtain materials. For a partition wall without plumbing, use 2-by-4
lumber; for a wall with plumbing, use 2-by-6 lumber. Specify straight boards;
warped boards are tricky or impossible to use. (Lumber yards will often allow
you to select the boards.);    Find the joists;  The wall described here has
no openings or firestops, and is constructed vertically. (Such a wall might
serve as a partial room divider.) To build it, you will need pieces for the
plate, two sills (installing a second sill on top of the first makes attaching
baseboard molding easier) and studs for each end and at 16-inch intervals
between them.;    Actual construction starts with determining the locations of
the ceiling beams, called joists, above the spot chosen for the wall. These
may be visible in an unfinished attic, or their locations may be detected on a
ceiling that has not recently been repainted as light-colored strips
separating darker areas.;    Other methods for finding joists include using an
electronic stud-finding tool or drilling test holes near corners where the
ceiling meets the walls. These can be concealed later.;    A wall running
perpendicular to ceiling joists or aligned so the plate lies directly below a
joist is easiest to fasten.;    Try to avoid erecting a wall between joists;
fastening it requires opening the ceiling and installing strips of wood
between the joists to provide anchoring surfaces for the plate. This is
usually a major task and involves repairing the ceiling.;    Installing the
plate;    Mark on the ceiling the position of joists the plate will cross or
the one it will lie beneath. Next, if the plate will cross the joists, mark on
it where fasteners installed through the plate will enter the joists; or if
the plate will lie beneath a joist, mark positions for fasteners along the
plate's center at 16- to 24-inch intervals.;    Installing the plate with
screws is easier than nailing it. Use screws if the ceiling is made of
plaster, because nailing into it may damage it.;    At the places marked,
drill holes through the plate for three-inch-long multipurpose or drywall
screws. With a helper, position the plate against the ceiling.;    While
holding the plate in place, insert a screw in one of the holes and drive it
into the joist with an electric drill with a screwdriver bit. Check the
alignment of the plate, then install the remaining screws.;    Use a plumb
bob;    Use a plumb bob to align the sill on the floor directly below the
plate. Have a helper hold the bob's string against one edge of the plate while
the bob itself dangles freely about an eighth of an inch from the floor. When
the bob stops moving, mark the floor directly below the point.;    Perform
this step at three or more places along the plate. Then draw a straight line
connecting as many of the points as possible. Align one of the two sills with
the line and screw or nail it to the floor. Then fasten the other sill on top
of it.;    Before installing the studs, mark their locations on the sill and
plate. Starting at one end, place studs so their centers are at 16-inch
intervals. (The distance between the final pair may be less.) Install the
studs by cutting and fastening them one at a time to accommodate
irregularities caused by an uneven floor or ceiling.;    Toenailing technique;
 Experienced carpenters usually fasten studs by driving nails at an angle
through their ends into the plate and sill, a difficult technique called
toenailing.;    An easier method is to fasten metal construction angles to the
ends of each stud (use two angles a stud), fit it into place, then nail the
protruding flanges of the angles to the plate and sill.;    Afterward, drill
an angled hole at the top and bottom of each of the stud's narrow edges and
install a screw or nail as with toenailing.;    Professional practice calls
for attaching end studs to existing wall framing, either a stud or wooden
strips installed as described for anchoring a plate between joists.;   
Amateurs can forgo this unless a code requires it. Once the framework is done
and any wiring or plumbing is installed, paneling can be applied.  </TEXT>

Children of all ages love sand. Here are instructions for an easy-to-build wood 
sandbox that will provide them with years of fun. 
</P>
<P>
A hammer, saw and screwdriver are all you'll need. 
</P>
<P>
The base for the box is made of patio blocks, available at building product or 
home centers. The box itself has no bottom, so that rainwater can drain out. 
Get at least 21 8-by-16-by-2-inch blocks for the base. A lid allows the box to 
serve as a low play table and also acts as a barrier to pets. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Built of Lumber 
</P>
<P>
The box and lid are built of lumber. To minimize waste, buy the lumber, all 
1-by-4-inch stock, in standard lengths. You will need 7 8-foot lengths, 1 
10-foot length, and 2 12-foot lengths. 
</P>
<P>
Redwood needs no wood preservative because the wood resists rot, but it is 
expensive. Pine or other softwood is cheaper but should be treated with a 
nontoxic wood preservative or paint. 
</P>
<P>
Saw the wood into these pieces: 6 48-inch side boards; 6 26-inch end boards; 10 
12-inch uprights; 14 28 1/2-inch lid boards, and 2 46-inch lid crosspieces. All 
the lumber is 1-by-4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
Hardware and supplies: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four mending plates with 1/2-inch screws. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Galvanized nails: 2-inches and 2 1/2-inches. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two 36-inch lengths of 3/8-inch steel curtain rod cut into six 12-inch 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Three 50-pound bags of washed white sea sand, available at building or home 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Steps of Assembly 
</P>
<P>
How to assemble the box: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- Use 8-foot pieces for side boards, lid crosspieces, end boards and the 
uprights. Cut side boards and lid crosspieces first. Then cut end boards. Use 
the leftover 3-foot lengths for the uprights. Use the 10- and 12-foot lengths 
for lid boards. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- The sandbox is 12 inches (or three boards) high. Nail three uprights, 
evenly spaced, to the end boards and two uprights to the side boards. Use 
2-inch nails driven from the outside. Hammer two nails through the uprights 
into each board. 
</P>
<P>
Stagger the nails to prevent splitting. The nail points will project 1/2-inch 
from the inside surface. Hammer and bend these points down and into the wood 
(clinch-nail) so they won't scratch. This will also make a stronger bond. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- Assemble the completed sides and ends. Fasten the sides to the end pieces 
with 2 1/2-inch nails. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Position lid crosspieces 10-inches apart on the lid boards. Adjust the 
crosspieces so they will fit inside the ends of the box. Clinch-nail the 
crosspieces into the end boards with 2-inch nails driven from the outside. To 
reinforce the lid boards at the corners of the lid, attach mending plates 
outside the crosspieces with 1/2-inch screws. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- Lay the patio blocks. Set the box on the blocks. Anchor the box by driving 
two rods into the ground on each side and one at each end in the spaces between 
the blocks.

<LEADPARA>  PERRY Farrell sits in the headquarters of a Los Angeles record company,
touting his latest venture with the exuberance of a child. As lead singer for
the notorious post-modernist rock band Jane's Addiction, Farrell has raised
eyebrows with his dabblings inmysticism, and for advocating drug use and
casual sex.;    But the source of Farrell's delirium nowadays isn't some
consciousness-expanding substance or unconventional religion. Rather it's
Lollapalooza, an ambitious concert tour that's scheduled to hit 21 North
American cities by summer's end. The show rolls into Shoreline Amphitheater in
Mountain View today and Saturday. Today's show is sold out; a few reserved
tickets and lawn seating are still available for the Saturday show.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I'm so jazzed, I'm clean," the singer says, jokingly suggesting that
coordinating Lollapalooza has replaced psychedelics as his preferred drug.;   
If the singer and the tour's other organizers are successful, they just might
make the history books. Farrell says he hopes Lollapalooza will be the event
that awakens today's youth from an apathetic slumber.;    Lollapalooza
attempts to compress all of Woodstock's good intentions into a daylong
concert. Aside from headliners Jane's Addiction, the bill features Siouxsie
and the Banshees, Living Colour, Nine Inch Nails, Ice-T, the Butthole Surfers
and the Rollins Band. Also featured at the Shoreline show will be local bands
playing on a side stage and displays from local artists. There will be a
head-shaving booth, and information booths where environmental, governmental
and human rights groups will distribute their literature.;    "I think you're
going to see a youth movement in America. All of a sudden things are going to
accelerate," Farrell says when asked what he hopes Lollapalooza will
accomplish.;    "It will be nice to see kids coming to a facility not just to
get the art exposure, but also to be informed about important things like
environmental issues," says Don Muller, a booking agent who helped coordinate
Lollapalooza.;    "It isn't just national organizations we're dealing with
here. We'll be trying to get kids to pay attention to regional environmental
issues, too. It's not like we're going completely one wing or the other. We
just want to give people a choice.";    Of course, Lollapalooza isn't the
first time musicians have sought to bring about world peace through rock 'n'
roll. The No Nukes concerts of the late 1970s brought acts like Bruce
Springsteen and Jackson Browne together to heighten awareness about the
potential hazards of nuclear power.;    A few years later, Apple Computer
wunderkind Steve Wozniak sponsored the US Festivals. The loosely coordinated
shows promoted racial harmony through concert bills featuring rock, pop and
R&amp;B acts.;    Just last year a multi-act, politically oriented event dubbed
Gathering of the Tribes attracted moderate-size crowds in San Francisco and
Los Angeles. But when promoters tried to take the concert nationwide this
summer, turnout was so poor that the jaunt was canceled. (At the tour's Bay
Area stop, July 7 at Shoreline, just about 7,500 showed at the 20,000-seat
venue.);    The failure of the US and Gathering of Tribes tours would prompt
skeptics to look askance at Lollapalooza. But Farrell insists "skepticism is a
thing of the past" where his show is concerned.;    "If anyone's skeptical,
it's because of jealousy," says Farrell. "I think people have lost all the
skepticism about this. We're selling out just about every place we play.";   
Though Farrell is exaggerating slightly, his point is well taken. Lollapalooza
shows have sold out in Orange County, San Diego, Detroit and Boston.;    Marc
Geiger, a Triad Artists booking agent, helped organize Lollapalooza. He says
there is a difference between Lollapalooza and the ill-fated Gathering of the
Tribes tour.;    "The difference is that one of the festivals pulled it off,
and one didn't," says Geiger. "The key is in the executing.";    Geiger's
execution began at last year's Redding Festival in Britain. Jane's Addiction
was scheduled to perform, but was forced to cancel after Farrell came down
with laryngitis.;    But Geiger and Muller attended the Redding Festival
anyway, and were impressed by the size of the crowd and the ambiance of the
event.;    "There were 40,000 kids going crazy over the Pixies," says Geiger,
referring to a popular alternative-rock band. "The kids weren't being hassled,
and everybody was having the time of their lives.";    The two booking agents
asked Farrell to draw up a blueprint for a fantastic festival of his own. The
singer jumped at the chance, challenging Geiger and Muller to realize his
wackiest concepts.;    "I'd call someone at 3 in the morning and say 'I want
helium balloons surrounding the crowd,"' recalls Farrell. "I'd say things like
'We need Lollapalooza-sized burritos served in buckets, with buckets of
Sprite.' It all had to be different.";    Whether Farrell is successful in
ushering in a new era of political awareness, creativity and racial concord
remains to be seen. But the singer is optimistic.;    "We're bringing the
museum to the kids, and one of the things I'm confident will happen is that
young artists are going to become superstars," says Farrell. "Sometimes you
just get a vibe that something's going to happen. That's the vibe I get about
this.";     Lollapalooza Festival; Jane's Addiction, Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees,

DOING WALL DETECTIVE WORK: FINDING STUDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY ABRAMS, Abrams is a Los Angeles general contractor and a free-lance 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Every year, thousands of people, especially children, are seriously injured by 
improperly mounted objects falling off the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Whether you own or rent your home, sooner or later, you will have the need to 
anchor a heavy picture, mirror, bookshelf, wall unit or other item on a 
plaster, wood panel or drywall surface. 
</P>
<P>
To do it safely, the mounting hardware should be secured to the vertical lumber 
(studs) inside a plaster, wood panel or drywall surface. 
</P>
<P>
Finding the studs can sometimes be tricky because they are hidden inside the 
wall. One sure-fire but undesirable way to find a stud is to drive a nail into 
the wall at one inch intervals along a horizontal line in the area where you 
want to hang the heavy object until you feel the resistance of the nail 
penetrating solid wood. 
</P>
<P>
This method is both time consuming and damaging to the wall. Here are some 
ideas for making stud finding a lot easier: 
</P>
<P>
Use an electronic stud finder. Another terrific spin-off of the electronic 
revolution for home improvement is a device called an electronic stud sensor. 
This tool is battery powered and operates by sensing changes in the wall 
density that indicate the presence of a solid object inside the wall. 
</P>
<P>
This instrument is about the size of a pocket calculator and works by slowly 
moving it across the wall surface in the mounting area until a row of lights 
illuminate, indicating the stud location. It is sold under the brand name 
Studsensor and is manufactured by Zircon International Inc. Most hardware 
stores and home centers carry it; prices range from $10 to $20. 
</P>
<P>
Measure from known studs. Although the electronic stud sensor is the best 
device on the market for stud finding, it is not 100% accurate. Sometimes 
non-standard wall construction or other obstructions in the wall result in 
either false readings or no reading at all. That's where the old-fashioned 
method of measuring from known wall studs is handy to know. 
</P>
<P>
During construction of a home, wall studs are normally placed 16 inches apart. 
Since room corners and door and window edges are always framed by studs, try 
measuring out horizontally from these points. Odds are that you will find studs 
at about 16-inch intervals. 
</P>
<P>
For example, if you have a door and a window on a wall that are 8 feet apart, 
studs will normally be found between the door and window at 16, 32, 48, 64 and 
80 inches. 
</P>
<P>
When you have noted the multiple of 16 inches from the known wall stud in the 
desired mounting area, drive a thin nail into the wall to determine your 
accuracy. If you miss the stud, try the nail again one inch left or right of 
the first hole. 
</P>
<P>
Another variation on this technique is to measure laterally on the wall from 
the edge of light switches, electrical outlets or heating/air conditioning 
registers because these are always mounted on wall studs during construction. 
</P>
<P>
When measuring from a heat/AC register, hold the end of the tape at either the 
left or right of it, as there are studs on both sides. When measuring from an 
outlet or switch, try either side first since they attach to only one stud. If 
your first attempt is incorrect, try measuring from the opposite side. 
</P>
<P>
Knock on the wall. Still another method of stud location is to literally knock 
on the wall several times at the desired mounting location, and then left and 
right of it. A hollow sound means there is no stud, while a solid sound means 
you have probably hit the jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
Try the nail test at the spot where you hear the solid sound to assure that you 
have indeed found the stud. 
</P>
<P>
Look for dimples on the wall. The least consistent, but often successful stud 
finding technique to try on a drywall surface is to look for depressions or 
"dimples" on the wall that indicate nails. 
</P>
<P>
During construction the drywall sheets are nailed to every wall stud, and then 
the nails are covered with a thin layer of compound to give a smooth, finished 
surface. Sometimes, though, the finish work on the wall is not as good as it 
should be, and with very close examination, slight dimples can be seen where 
the nails penetrate the drywall into the studs. 
</P>
<P>
If you find such an irregularity in the mounting area, you can be almost 100% 
certain it indicates a stud. 
</P>
<P>
When looking for wall studs behind a wood panel wall, look closely for colored 
nail heads in the grooves of the panels. Any nails you find probably penetrate 
a wall stud behind the paneling.

<LEADPARA>  INSTALLING a disappearing staircase -- stairs that fold down from a ceiling
hatchway and are raised into it for storage -- is worth considering if a
larger or more convenient attic entrance is needed.;   The job is usually not
too difficult for a moderately skilled amateur carpenter and a strong
assistant, provided a suitable hatchway already exists or can be built as
described below.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Peninsula Home  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  EASY STEPS: DISAPPEARING STAIRCASE MAKES ATTIC
ACCESSIBLE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Do It Yourself  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Disappearing staircases come in two styles. Both require at least three
feet of space in front of them at floor level for access.;   The folding style
consists of three staircase sections that fold together like accordion pleats.
These are suitable for occasional use (averaging no more than once or twice a
week) and where little room exists in the attic above or in front of the
hatchway.;   They generally cost $50 to $100, depending on quality and length,
and are usually rated for loads of about 200 pounds.;   For more frequent use
and heavier loads (up to 2,000 pounds), choose the sliding style. These have
only one section, which accounts for their increased strength.;   They also
have wider treads and a gentler slope than folding stairs, making them easier
to climb.;   Depending on their length, sliding stairs require three to six
feet of space above the hatchway and four to eight feet in front of it for
storage. They cost about $200 to $800.;   Both styles are spring-loaded to
make them easy to operate. The stairs can be obtained by ordering them through
a lumberyard or building supply store.;   To install disappearing stairs,
first draw an outline on the ceiling of the opening that must be cut for them.
Instructions furnished with the stairs will give the dimensions.;   If
possible, simply enlarge an existing opening. Consult a building inspector
before cutting a new one.;   Amateurs should create only rectangular openings
whose long sides run parallel to the ceiling joists. (Raise attic floorboards
to view the joists if necessary.);   For such openings, this usually involves
cutting through only one or two joists to create the opening's width; cutting
more requires bracing the ceiling from below to avoid collapse and is a job
for an expert carpenter.;   Position the opening so a joist will form one of
the long sides. Do this by drilling small holes as markers down from the attic
through the ceiling along the edge of the joist you select. At the same time,
reroute any electrical wiring that is in the way. When the outline is drawn,
cut along it with a saw. Sever joists squarely.;   Have on hand three pieces
of lumber the same dimensions as the joists -- usually 2-by-8 or 2-by-10 stock
-- and also a supply of U-shaped metal joist hangers and nails designed for
them. Home centers and lumberyards carry these items.;   Cut two pieces of the
lumber for headers to strengthen the opening and support the severed joists.
Cut the headers to span the width of the opening; then loosely fasten a joist
hanger at both ends of each header by installing the nails only partway. Also
attach joist hangers loosely to the ends of the severed joists.;   Set the
headers in place so their edges are even with those of the joists. Nail
through the hangers' flanges into the joists perpendicular to them, then
finish hammering any partly driven nails. Fasten the severed joists to the
headers the same way.;   Use the third piece as a trimmer to narrow the
opening if it is too wide. Cut it to fit between the headers; fasten it to
them with joist hangers.;   With folding stairs, the next step is to
temporarily attach ledgers -- two strips of 1-by-4 lumber -- to the ceiling at
each end projecting into the opening at a 90-degree angle to header.;  
Position each ledger so it creates a lip about three-quarters of an inch wide
beneath the opening, and attach it with nails or screws to the header above.; 
 With help from an assistant, maneuver the folded staircase sideways through
the opening from below, then twist and lower it into place onto the ledgers.
(Most staircases weigh about 60 pounds.);   Gently unfold the staircase as
much as possible (it should be too long) and anchor it temporarily by driving
a few eight-penny (2 1/2 inches long) finishing nails through the frame into
the ceiling opening. Leave the nails protruding for easy removal.;   Level and
square the staircase frame inside the opening by inserting wood scraps between
the frame and the opening where necessary.;   Permanently fasten the frame to
the joists and headers with 16-penny (3 1/2-inch) common nails spaced about 10
inches apart. Then remove the finishing nails or drive them fully into the
wood.;   To trim the stairway to the correct length, first lock the top and
middle sections into position. Set a yardstick on the top edge of one of the
stair's sides and extend it to the floor.;   Next, measure the distance
spanned by the yardstick between the end of the stair and the floor, and mark
the same distance on the upper edges of both sides of the lower section by
measuring from its hinged end. Repeat the process on the underside of the
stairs to mark the lower edges.;   On each side of the section, draw slanting
lines connecting the upper and lower marks. Then carefully saw along them to
remove excess material from the bottom.;   Refold the stairs slightly so the
lower section can be fully unfolded; the trimmed ends should rest flat on the
floor.;   Sliding stairs have no frame and are not preassembled. Basically,
installation involves first attaching the hatchway door and stair hinge to the
forward part of the ceiling opening.;   Next, the stairs are assembled on the
floor, raised into place and fastened to the hinge. Finally, the spring cables
are attached and adjusted. Complete instructions are supplied by the
manufacturer.;   After installing either type of stairs, trim the perimeter of
the hatchway with molding.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Q I want to install a porch swing. The porch-roof ceiling has the old-style
tongue-and-groove wood strips. Will the boards hold a swing and what kind of
hardware should I use?;    A The tongue-and-groove boards won't support a
swing adequately, but the ceiling joists, to which the boards are nailed,
should. Nailing patterns will sometimes reveal the locations of joists, but
nail heads might not be visible in the tongue-and-groove boards.  </LEADPARA>

Gene Austin writes about real estate and home improvement for the Philadelphia

<TEXT>     If not, thump the ceiling with your knuckles or a screwdriver handle until
you hit a solid spot, or use a magnetic or electronic stud finder, sold at
many home centers and hardware stores. Once you find one joist, others should
be spaced at 16-inch intervals from it. To confirm the presence of solid wood,
drill a test hole  or 1/16in diameter. The joists are probably 2-by-6s or
2-by-4s.;    Swings are generally suspended from heavy-duty eye bolts or
screw-eyes (a bolt needs a nut on the end, a screw doesn't).;    I suggest
screw-eyes with screws at least four inches long and shanks and eyes of
three-eighths-inch steel. One screw-eye is needed for each end of the swing.
The distance between screw-eyes should be approximately the length of the
swing, but joist spacing might make it necessary to make this distance a
little more or less. Drill  -inch pilot holes for the screw-eyes, making
certain you hit solid wood.;    The swing chains are suspended from the eyes
with heavy-duty S hooks at least a quarter-inch in diameter. The S hooks make
it easy to hang or remove the swing, or adjust its height.;    Test the
installation carefully and check it frequently to make sure everything is
secure.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     Masonry nails resemble ordinary nails with flat heads, but are thicker,
grooved and made of hardened steel. For driving into solid concrete, choose
nails long enough to penetrate three-quarters to one inch. For driving into
brick and concrete-block masonry, choose nails long enough to penetrate about
an inch and a quarter. (In brick and block, drive nails only into mortar
joints, not into the bricks or blocks; these may shatter.);   When installing
masonry nails in narrow lumber or near the ends of boards, first drill nail
holes through the wood; this will keep the wood from splitting. Make the holes
slightly smaller in diameter than the thickness of the nails.;   Cut nails are
rectangular in cross section and have flat tapering sides and blunt points.
They hold well in mortar joints but are difficult to drive into solid
concrete. When driven through lumber with their tapering sides parallel to the
wood grain, cut nails are less likely than masonry nails to cause splitting,
and so do not always require pre-drilled holes.;   To attach a board using
masonry or cut nails, space the fasteners 18 to 24 inches apart. Drill holes
through the wood if desired, then install one or two nails in the board before
setting it in place. At least one of the nails should be near the center of
the board to support it while you nail the others. To drive masonry and cut
nails, use a small sledgehammer. Wear goggles.;   Hammer the first nails into
the masonry, then continue with the rest. Drive nails only until their heads
are flush with the board's surface; hammering farther can loosen them.;  
Concrete screws are sometimes easier to use than nails, and can be installed
in brick and block. The first step is to drill holes for the screws. If you
need only a few holes an ordinary variable-speed drill is adequate, but for
larger jobs rent an electric hammer drill. Choose screws that are twice as
long as the lumber is thick.;   To install a concrete screw, hold the board in
place and drill through it into the masonry using a masonry-drilling bit with
a carbide tip. The diameter of the bit must equal that of the screw's shaft
minus the threads. Then install the screw and tighten it firmly. If
overtightened, the screw may pull loose.;   Boards thicker than 1 1/2 inches
or boards that must support greater weight than paneling or wallboard require
expansion fasteners. Among the strongest are anchor bolts with lead shields;
these consist of a sturdy bolt and a cylindrical lead sleeve (the shield),
which is split in half along part of its length.;   Anchor bolts are available
at hardware stores and can be installed in concrete, mortar and bricks, but
not concrete block. To select the right size and quantity, ask a sales clerk
for the manufacturer's recommendations. As with concrete screws, you will need
an electric drill and a masonry-drilling bit.;   To install anchor bolts,
pre-drill the board. Use the holes as a guide for marking the masonry with a
center punch or nail. Then bore larger holes into the masonry for the
shields.;   Tap the shields into place with a hammer until they are flush with
or just below the masonry surface. Place a washer on each bolt and slide the
bolts through the board into the shields. Tighten all the bolts as a group, a
little at a time, until all are snug. Tightening the fastener causes the
halves of the shield to expand against the sides of the hole, securing the
assembly.;   Other anchor bolts require drilling only one hole. A special bolt
and shield are installed as a unit; then, depending on the design, tightening
to spread the shield's halves is done with a wrench, screwdriver or hammer.;  
On walls made of hollow concrete block, use toggle bolts that grip from
behind. These resemble a T. The short segment (the toggle) pivots so it can be
aligned end-to-end with the long segment (the bolt), which is threaded.;   To
install, drill a hole the same diameter as the bolt through the board and into
the block. Attach a washer and nut to the bolt, then push the bolt toggle-end
first into the hole. When the toggle enters the cavity inside the block it
will fall, pivoting until it is perpendicular to the bolt. Tightening the nut
then will draw the toggle against the block's inside surface while compressing
the board against the outside.;   Another method of fastening lumber up to 1
1/2 inches thick to masonry is to use a powder-actuated fastening tool that
fires special nails with a .22-caliber gunpowder cartridge.;   A
powder-actuated fastening tool, sold at hardware stores for $15 and up, is a
good investment for some jobs that would otherwise require installing many
masonry nails or screws. Besides lessening the effort of such a job, using the
tool eliminates vibration from hammering that can loosen previously driven
nails.;   Before using a powder-actuated tool, carefully read the instructions
and safety precautions. Also practice nailing. To operate one popular model,
press the end containing the nail against the surface to be fastened and
strike the other end with an ordinary hammer. This detonates the cartridge.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Police Discover Filmed `Murder' Really Rock Video</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mysterious ``murder'' film turned out to be no
mystery at all when police discovered the evidence was really a
rock music video.
   The film, found in a movie camera lying in a Michigan cornfield
last year, shows Trent Reznor, lead singer for the Cleveland rock
group Nine Inch Nails, lying face up in an ally on Chicago's North
Side.
   Chicago police Detective Hal Ardell said Tuesday the rock group
made the film last September using 8mm movie cameras held aloft
with helium balloons for some of the scenes. But a tether broke and
the balloons carried one of the cameras to a cornfield 125 miles
away, near Burr Oak, Mich.
   The farmer who found the camera turned it over to Michigan State
Police, who developed the film and sent a copy to Chicago police.
   Pathologists at the Cook County medical examiner's office said
it appeared Reznor was dead. But Ardell said it was starch powder
placed on Reznor's face that gave him the deathly look.
   Inquiries at college film departments turned up a former Art
Institute of Chicago student who said his employer, H-GUN Video
Productions, had been hired by a New York firm to produce a music
video for Nine Inch Nails. The man explained how the camera broke
loose.
   ``The bottom line is we don't have a body and we don't have
mystery or homicide,'' said John Townsend, chief of detectives of
the Chicago Police Department.

HANDYMEN SHOULD STICK CLOSE TO THEIR GLUE GUNS

Next time you tackle a construction job around the home, reach for your gun. 
I'm talking about your caulking gun. Load it up with one of a variety of 
specialized construction adhesives now available in caulking gun cartridges, 
and you'll have a potent tool for shooting down a wide variety of construction 
problems. Examples? 
</P>
<P>
Decking: The traditional way to fasten down deck planking is with two nails at 
every joist. This holds the planks down, at least initially, but with time, it 
also causes problems. One is splitting. Another is rust. Even the best 
hot-dipped galvanized nails will rust eventually. This causes stains and 
eventual deterioration of the decking. Nails can also work loose, pop up and 
injure bare feet. 
</P>
<P>
The answer to all these problems is deck adhesive, a special formula designed 
to work well with pressure-treated stock. Using this adhesive won't eliminate 
the need for nails entirely. You'll still need a few here and there (follow 
directions on the glue cartridge) to restrain warped boards and keep good 
contact between planking and joists. But you'll use far fewer nails than you 
would without adhesive, and you'll get a stronger, more durable job in the 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
Sub-flooring: Here's another ideal application for construction adhesive. 
Typical floor construction calls for one layer of five-eighths or sometimes 
half-inch plywood followed by another layer of plywood under-layment to provide 
a smooth base for your finish flooring. By using adhesive and special 
three-quarter-inch tongue-and-groove plywood, you can do the job with just one 
layer. The adhesive should go on all joists, plus along the mating edges of the 
plywood sheets. Nail according to adhesive instructions and you'll get a 
sturdy, squeak-free floor with less labor than required for the old-fashioned 
two-layer system. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing off walls: There are also special adhesives for installing drywall 
and paneling. I always like to use at least a few fasteners when installing 
drywall, but with paneling, you may be able to get by without any nails at all, 
using this trick: 
</P>
<P>
Run a fat bead of adhesive on each stud and the panel in place, pressing it 
firmly into the adhesive. Immediately pull the panel away to let the adhesive 
dry for a short time (this varies according to brand). Then press the panel 
back in place. When you do, it will stick like, well . . . glue.

<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; CELEBRITY; PROFILE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IN A career devoted to pushing the boundaries of popular taste, rapper Ice-T
really has his hands full this time.;    The godfather of gangster rap was
among seven acts on the Lollapalooza tour, which played the Bay Area in late
July. On the surface, at least, he was the outsider on a bill that also
included the art-metal bands Jane's Addiction and Living Colour, British
gloom-popsters Siouxsie and the Banshees, industrial dance-machine Nine Inch
Nails, the punkish Rollins Band and renegade grunge rockers the Butthole
Surfers.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It's virtually unprecedented for a rap performer who appeals to the hardest
core of the largely black inner-city audience to share a stage with rock and
pop bands that have a primarily white following, especially on such a large
scale -- the Lollapalooza tour is playing 21 cities nationwide, with audiences
of over 20,000 expected at most shows.;    But Ice-T says he doesn't feel out
of place.;    The hard corps;  "I'm not a traditional black rapper, because
I'm too hard for most black audiences," he says. "I feel perfect out there
with the Butthole Surfers, because I know where they're coming from. I know
where Henry Rollins is coming from because I used to watch (Rollins' former
band) Black Flag back in the punk and hard-core days. I'm into Nine Inch Nails
because I'm a big Ministry fan, which does a similar kind of music.";    Last
year, Ice-T appeared in two West Coast shows billed as the Gathering of the
Tribes, in which he was the sole rapper among rockers such as Iggy Pop, the
Cramps and Soundgarden.;    "The promoters were scared to death, because they
thought when I got on stage people were going to boo," he says. "But we tore
it up. We had people standing and yelling, because rock groups don't say,
'Throw your hands in the air,' and 'Go ahead, scream!' People had a good time,
so I think that was the real breakthrough that showed this kind of thing can
work if you use the right rapper.";    Since then, the merging of rock and
rap, "white" and "black" music, has become more commonplace on record,
including collaborations between major artists such as R.E.M. and KRS-One
("Radio Song"), Sonic Youth and Chuck D. ("Kool Thing") and Anthrax and Public
Enemy ("Bring the Noise"). Concerts matching rap and rock groups, such as the
Sisters of Mercy/Public Enemy bill, also have been popping up more frequently
in the last year.;    "Rap and rock are the exact same thing," Ice-T says.
"Rap groups like Public Enemy are hard-core about music. We're creating the
same energy that rock 'n' roll creates, so any audience can relate.;    "The
way I define music is if you're dealing with the system and you're just
floating with it singing about milkshakes, love and homework, then you're
doing pop music. But if you rock the system, you're rockin' and rollin',
whether it be reggae, jazz, rap, whatever.";    Ice-T makes the point even
more explicitly on his recent album, "O.G. Original Gangster" (Sire), which
contains a wailing, heavy-metal cut, "Body Count," by a black hard-rock trio
of the same name, with Ice-T on lead vocal.;    Body Count was recently signed
to a record deal by Sire Records, with Ice-T as the lead vocalist. The rapper
opens his portion of the Lollapalooza concert with a rap performance, and then
brings on Body Count to back him on three songs.;    "These guys are my homeys
(friends) from Crenshaw (High School)" in South Central Los Angeles, Ice-T
says. "They would always be fighting with me about making a straight-up rock
record and I'd be telling them you can't do it right now, because the rap
audience wasn't buying my records to get rock. So we'd tease the audience with
it, just give them hints of rock on each record, but never full out.";   
Music on the edge; Lollapalooza and Body Count are just the latest in a series
of adventurous artistic steps taken by Ice-T. Most of them have paid off: His
spacious split-level home overlooking Sunset Boulevard is only a short
distance from the "killing fields" of South Central that he grew up in, but he
no longer has to hustle to make a living. His previous three albums have each
sold at least 500,000 copies and "O.G. Original Gangster" recently cracked the
Billboard top 20.;    But that former life of hustling, shooting, pimping and
drug-dealing haunts Ice-T still, and has been the basis of virtually every one
of his records since "Six in the Morning" in 1987, generally acknowledged as
the blueprint for the "gangster rap" style.;    "The whole crew I was running
with, all of them went to prison, and two of them got life terms," he says. "I
was the only one who missed the tag. We used to rob jewelry stores, pull
kidnappings, anything to make a buck. I was very lucky to be detoured just in
time.";    The cover photos on his latest album are a reminder of how thin
that line was. One shows the bejeweled, tuxedo-clad rapper standing in front
of his Ferrari. In the other, he is scowling in a T-shirt and jeans, chained
at the wrists.;    "The more success I get, the more guilt I feel about the
homeys that are stuck," he says. "You never lose that core. It's like asking a
Vietnam veteran if he can still tell you about a firefight. My boys are still
dying out there, and they keep telling me, 'Yo, Ice, kick it, keep telling
them.' ";    Sounds of the street;  And tell it he does, in more vivid detail
and harsher language than almost any rapper in the business. His baritone
delivery is more measured, more ominous than verbal gymnasts such as Rakim or
L.L. Cool J, and whereas records by N.W.A. or Public Enemy blast the funk,
Ice-T's music seems to ooze menacingly from the speakers.;    "I don't make
records that you can dance to, they're more for people to kick back, have a
cold drink, and trip. They're like vocal novels," he says. "When I started
out, I had lots of rhymes about stealing and hustling and living the life, but
I thought that to get over (to a wider audience) I would have to rap like
Run-D.M.C. and L.L. Cool J.;    Real-life raps;  "L.L. was rapping about
radios ('I Can't Live Without My Radio'), but I didn't know anything about
carrying a radio around," Ice-T says. "We were stealing radios. So I wrote
'Six in the Morning,' which was just about a kid trying to run from the cops,
just that whole . . .-the-police attitude. Another cut was 'Pain,' about how
cops broke my face with an ax. Once that hit, I knew that I would be making
records till the end of time, because all I had to do was rap about what I
knew.";    What Ice-T knows has expanded immeasurably over the years, and his
records reflect that growth. While his imitators and disciples, including
N.W.A. and the Geto Boys, have eclipsed him as the hardest of the hard-core by
taking gangster rap to even wilder and more pathological extremes, "O.G."
points to a way out.;    In "Mind Over Matter," for example, Ice-T talks about
the thrill of putting words to paper -- certainly one of the most effective
advertisements for literacy any rock or rap star has ever made. Although the
withering commentary aimed at the likes of trigger-happy police, bourgeois
blacks and Barbara Bush remains, the homophobic and sexist language that
littered his previous albums is virtually non-existent.;    Growing up, moving
on;  "When I started, all I knew was the four square blocks around me, and
anyone who was different was 'dissed' (disrespected)," he says. "But when you
go around the world, you find there's nothing to be gained by putting people
down just because they're different from you. You learn things, you understand
things better. Every year I try to bring the game that I learned to the
record.";    He even found himself playing the role of a police detective in
the hit movie "New Jack City.";    "I never will like cops, but I'm coming
from a situation of no opportunities, so that when you get the opportunity you
capitalize," he says. "If I played a gangster, everybody would say it was no
big deal. But by playing a cop, people may start to believe I can act. I'm
just trying for achievement, to take another step."  </TEXT>

SOMETIMES A DECK IS BETTER THAN A PATIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A deck, in Southern California home improvement parlance, most often is a 
redwood structure hanging off the second floor of a home or cantilevered out 
over a hillside. 
</P>
<P>
A patio, on the other hand, usually is a flat concrete slab at ground level. 
</P>
<P>
But it doesn't have to be so. 
</P>
<P>
A deck can be built just about anywhere a patio can be poured, and the warmth 
and texture of wood, combined with its relatively easy maintenance, makes a 
wonderful replacement for concrete. 
</P>
<P>
And for the do-it-yourselfer, a ground-level deck isn't all that difficult or 
expensive to build. 
</P>
<P>
When Michael and Lois Mirkovich moved from a tiny Balboa Island apartment to a 
1,200-square-foot condominium in Irvine's University Town Center, creating an 
outdoor area was a priority. They wanted to extend their space for 
entertaining, exercising and relaxing, and provide a clean, safe place for 
their son, Adam, to play. 
</P>
<P>
The two-bedroom condo had only a small rear yard -- no hillsides and no 
upstairs family room to give access to a second-floor deck. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Mirkovichs, neither of whom was enamored with concrete, decided to 
install a wooden deck. They just put it where most people put a patio. 
</P>
<P>
The result, after six weekends of work: a beautiful herringbone-patterned 
redwood deck-cum-patio, fitted neatly into a pocket of yard framed on three 
sides -- by the window wall of the living room, the sliding glass doors of the 
dining room and the stucco fence that separates the Mirkovichs' back yard from 
the neighbor's. The deck extends out an additional 6 feet into the main portion 
of the rear yard, giving it an overall dimension of 12-by-16 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Mirkovich, an attorney, decided to tackle the project himself because 
he enjoys working with his hands. 
</P>
<P>
He had learned construction skills when, after graduating from UC Santa Barbara 
with a master's degree in social ecology, he was recruited to play water polo 
in Australia for the University of Queensland club team in 1976-77. "I played 
water polo for free," he recalls. "They got me a construction job to pay the 
bills." 
</P>
<P>
But almost anyone who can swing a hammer and handle a power saw can follow the 
Mirkovichs' example and build a lasting and good-looking ground-level deck. 
</P>
<P>
The 12-by-16-foot deck described below will cost between $1,000 and $1,200 to 
build yourself, which is competitive with the cost of hiring a contractor to 
put in a standard concrete patio. "And aesthetically, it is so much nicer," 
Mirkovich says. 
</P>
<P>
Not only do the wide, "V"-shaped herringbone pattern and the warm reddish color 
of the wood give the deck a level of character that few concrete patios can 
match, it also wears well. 
</P>
<P>
Wood doesn't crack or chip at the edges like concrete. And Mirkovich avoided a 
common deck maintenance problem by refraining from painting or staining the 
deck. Instead, he applied clear water seal to each board before fitting the 
pieces together. All he does to keep the decking looking its best is to swab on 
a new coat of water seal every 6 months -- a process that takes less than 2 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
To keep the deck level with the floor of the house and still avoid the rotting 
and warping that will occur if wood is placed directly in contact with the 
earth, Mirkovich built it on a series of prefab concrete piers with mounting 
brackets for 4-by-4s. After installing the piers, he laid a layer of plastic 
sheeting on the ground to keep weeds from growing and to serve as a moisture 
barrier. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid attaching the deck to the house so there would be no building code 
problems and no chance of water running indoors, Mirkovich built it as a 
free-standing structure. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how you can do it: 
</P>
<P>
(Because building codes differ from city to city and the characteristics of 
each project can vary widely, use these instructions only as a guide, making 
sure your project complies with your local building codes.) 
</P>
<P>
The Foundation 
</P>
<P>
1. Instead of fastening a portion of the framing to the walls or foundation of 
your house, install prefab piers so that the mounting brackets are about 4 
inches from the wall. Set them so only an inch remains above ground. If your 
lot slopes, adjust the depth at which the piers are buried so the exposed tops 
are level. The distance between piers should be 5 to 6 feet. A line level, 
attached to a length of heavy string that is fixed to the house at floor level, 
is the best device for leveling the piers. A slight slope away from the house 
will keep rain water from running inside. 
</P>
<P>
2. Cut treated fir 4-by-4s to the appropriate length. Measure the distance 
between the ground and the level of your home's floor, subtract the 1 1/2-inch 
thickness of the decking boards and the distance the piers extend above ground 
level. 
</P>
<P>
3. Fit the 4-by-4 posts into the mounting brackets on the piers, mark the bolt 
holes and drill through with a 3/8-inch wood bit. Bolt posts to brackets with 
3/8-by-3 1/2-inch lag bolts, making sure they are straight and level. (If you 
taper the top of each post about 30 degrees, it will shed water. Coating the 
bottoms with roofing tar will further protect against water damage.) 
</P>
<P>
The Framing 
</P>
<P>
1. Cut treated fir 2-by-6s to length for main joists. For a 12-by-16-foot deck, 
Mirkovich used 16-foot joists. Cut a single joist for each outside row of piers 
and two joists for each interior row. 
</P>
<P>
2. Mount joists, tops level with the tops of the 4-by-4 posts. Tack in place 
with 16-penny galvanized nails. Exterior joists go on the outside of the piers 
(if you have a row of piers against the house or fence, the 4-inch space you 
left will give you plenty of room to slip the joist between the wall and the 
4-by-4 post). Interior joists are fastened to each side of the mounting posts, 
parallel to the exterior joists. 
</P>
<P>
3. Drill two slightly staggered 3/8-inch holes through each joist and support 
post. Fasten single joists to the posts with 3/8-by-5 1/2-inch lag bolts. Use 
3/8-by-7 1/2-inch lag bolts for the paired joists. 
</P>
<P>
4. Measure and cut treated 2-by-6 cross pieces to fit between the joists. 
</P>
<P>
5. For maximum strength, fasten them on 10- to 12-inch centers using galvanized 
joist hangers and 16-penny galvanized nails. Make sure the tops are flush with 
the tops of the joists. If the cross pieces are lower than the joist tops, the 
decking will sag; if higher, the ends of the decking won't nail down solidly 
and will tend to split. 
</P>
<P>
The Decking 
</P>
<P>
Use select grade redwood for best results. 
</P>
<P>
For a simple "V"-shaped herringbone pattern, cutting the ends of the boards at 
a 60-degree angle looks best. Decking can be run out to the edges of the deck, 
so the ends of each board are visible. Or, as Mirkovich did, decking can be 
framed, like a picture, to hide the board ends and give the deck a more formal 
look. Framing the deck, however, makes the cutting more involved and requires 
extra joists and cross pieces, and won't be dealt with in these instructions. 
</P>
<P>
Use a hollow-ground planing blade in your saw to minimize splintering and keep 
edges smooth. 
</P>
<P>
Coat each board with water seal and allow to dry before cutting. 
</P>
<P>
Then follow these steps: 
</P>
<P>
1. For the first side of the "V," lay a piece of untrimmed decking across the 
joists, adjust it to the proper angle with the ends overhanging the side and 
center joists, and nail it down with 10-penny galvanized finishing nails. Then 
nail each successive board in place, leaving a 1/8-inch gap between each for 
drainage and circulation (make a spacer from scrap 1/8-inch plywood or 
hardboard). 
</P>
<P>
2. Using a long straightedge or chalk line, mark the ends of the boards 
parallel with the outside edges of the joists. You can trim the decking flush 
with the exterior joist or allow it to overhang a bit, but you must add 2 
inches to the inside edge to allow for the space between the paired interior 
joists. 
</P>
<P>
3. Trim edges along the lines you've made. 
</P>
<P>
4. Coat the cut ends with water seal. 
</P>
<P>
5. To cut boards for the opposite leg of the "V" design, use a cutting jig to 
trim one end of each board. (To make the jig, use a 2-by-4 about 2 feet long 
and glue and bolt a 1-foot section to it at the proper angle -- 60 degrees is 
suggested, but it can vary according to individual tastes. Then you can lay the 
straightedge of the jig along the edge of each piece of decking and use the 
angled piece to guide your power saw. A rigid, moveable jig ensures that the 
angles you cut don't vary -- which is of critical importance in setting a 
herringbone pattern.) 
</P>
<P>
6. Coat the trimmed ends with water seal, then butt them against the inside 
edges of the first course of decking to form the point of each "V." Let the 
untrimmed edge of each board hang over the side. Nail boards into place, with 
1/8-inch spacing. 
</P>
<P>
7. Trim outside edge as described in No. 2 above and coat remaining exposed 
ends with water seal. 
</P>
<P>
8. Nail a 2-by-6 across the exposed joist ends to serve as a facing board for 
the edge of the deck that juts out into the yard. 
</P>
<P>
It takes time, and you'll likely end up with a mashed finger or two and more 
than a few splinters, but the end result is well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
The Mirkovichs have found that their deck enables them to entertain friends 
without feeling crowded. In other words, building it enabled Michael Mirkovich 
to add about 176 square feet of living space to his condo at far less expense 
than adding a room.

<P>
A conventional bedroom closet with a single clothes rod and an upper shelf can 
quickly become overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
With a little work and ingenuity, however, it can often be revamped to hold the 
contents more efficiently. Here are a few principles of closet redesign: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Single rods at the standard 6-foot height are necessary for women's dresses 
but wasteful for most men's and children's wear. By installing bilevel rods you 
can double storage space. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A narrow case with open shelves from floor to ceiling can house folded 
items, shoes, hats and other accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shelves above the clothes rods add valuable storage space. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Remove Existing Fixtures 
</P>
<P>
Here's how to go about installing additional rods, shelves and an open case. 
Remember to start any closet revamping by removing all existing rods and 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
You'll need three-quarters-inch plywood, 1-by-2 and 1-by-4 lumber, 1-inch 
hardwood dowels, dowel sockets, shelf edge moldings, L-brackets, screws and 
nails. Quantities and sizes will depend on the dimensions of your closet. The 
basic tools you'll require are saw, hammer, screwdriver, drill, drill bits and 
carpenter's level. 
</P>
<P>
The sides of the accessory case are made of plywood and extend from floor to 
ceiling. Place the good face of the plywood outward (facing the clothing) and 
fasten it at the floor, wall and ceiling with steel L-brackets. Try to line up 
the wall and ceiling brackets with the studs, or use hollow wall fasteners. 
</P>
<P>
Cut the shelves about one-sixteenth-inch shorter than the space between the 
uprights. Cut the shelf cleats that support the shelves from 1-by-2 stock and 
fasten them to the inside of the case sides. Use screws rather than nails for 
greater strength. 
</P>
<P>
The shelves can rest on the cleats or if you prefer pull-out shelves, add 
another cleat above the shelf. Leave enough clearance for the shelf to move in 
and out easily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mounting New Rods 
</P>
<P>
For clothes rods use 1-inch wood dowels. Mount each rod in metal clothes-rod 
sockets which are fixed to 1-by-4 cleats. Mount each socket so that its center 
is 11 inches from the back wall. 
</P>
<P>
If a shelf will rest on the cleats holding a dowel, place the dowel sockets 
near the bottom of the cleats. This will allow clearance above the rod to 
manipulate the hangers. To make sure that the rod is straight, install a socket 
at one end, insert the rod and place a level on it to determine the exact 
position for the socket at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
Shelves can be up to 22 inches deep. Shelves above the height of the closet 
door may have to be shallower to allow easy access. 
</P>
<P>
Use three-quarters-inch plywood for the shelves. Mount them on 1-by-2 cleats. 
Secure all wall cleats to studs. 
</P>
<P>
Finish exposed plywood edges with one-quarter-inch-thick shelf edge molding 
fastened with glue and brads. The molding conceals the raw edge of the plywood 
and eliminates the possibility of splinters.

<LEADPARA>  WAINSCOTING is wood paneling used to cover the lower portions of walls from
the floor level usually to a height of about three feet.;    Wainscoting is
sturdier and less susceptible to staining than paint or wallpaper; therefore,
it better withstands rubbing by furniture and is easier to clean.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But wainscoting has an aesthetic value as well. It can add elegance to a
den and charm to a kitchen or dining room.;    Wainscoting kits usually
include solid pine or cedar tongue-and-groove boards 32 inches long, about 3
1/2 inches wide and 1/516 inch thick.;    The boards interlock side by side
and are meant to be attached vertically. Where the boards meet, their edges
are either rounded and grooved to form a narrow bead or tapered to form a V.; 
  Both styles come with horizontal baseboard and chair-rail molding that is
notched on the back to cover the ends of the vertical boards. When assembled
from some kits, the height of the wainscoting is 35 1/2 inches.;    The
contents of a single kit will cover about five linear feet. Depending on the
dealer, pine wainscoting costs about $18 to $25 and cedar about $25 to $40.;  
 Wainscoting can be attached directly to wallboard or plaster walls if the
surface is reasonably flat. Over masonry walls or bare studs, nail horizontal
strips of 1-by-3 lumber (called furring strips) at 16-inch intervals and
around the perimeter of the area to provide support and a suitable fastening
surface.;    Before installing wainscoting, unpack it and let it adjust for
about 48 hours to temperature and humidity.;    On a finished wall, begin
installation by prying away the baseboard molding and discarding it.;    Next,
cut the new baseboard molding to length. If wainscoting is to be installed on
adjacent walls, cut all of the baseboard molding first, mitering or coping the
ends where they meet.;    For mitering -- cutting the ends of the molding at a
45-degree angle -- use a miter box and back saw, or rent a power miter saw,
also called a chop saw.;    Coping involves cutting the end of one piece so it
fits over the front of another piece at a right angle.;    Miter the end of
the piece to reveal the molding's profile, then saw the mitered part off
squarely, using a coping saw to follow the profile's contours. When finished,
the coped piece should fit precisely against the other piece, whose end is
left square.;    Mark the height of the chair-rail molding on the wall, then
cut these pieces to length and miter or cope them if necessary. Identify all
pieces on the back so they can be reassembled exactly.;    Apply finish to
wainscoting before installing it; otherwise, unfinished portions may show if
the vertical boards later shrink.;    If paint is to be used, sand with
150-grit sandpaper followed by 220-grit, and coat the wood with primer and one
coat of paint.;    After installation, apply a second coat. If a natural
finish is planned, sand as described and coat the wood with penetrating
sealer.;    Then apply stain if desired, followed by either a penetrating
finish (some of these contain stain) or a single coat of surface finish like
polyurethane. Coat the edges of boards as well as the side that will be
visible.;    When the finish is dry, nail the baseboard lightly into place
with annular-ring paneling nails about 1 1/2 inches long. Supplement these
with construction adhesive if desired.;    Start applying the wainscoting at
the more difficult corner so that the last board will fit in easily. If the
adjacent wall will receive wainscoting also, simply place the first board's
tongued edge against the inside of the corner so that the grooved edge can
receive the next board, and so on.;    Hold a carpenter's level against the
grooved edge and adjust the board until it is vertical.;    If the walls are
not straight, causing the tongued edge of the board to slant more than a
quarter of an inch away from the inside of the corner, set the arms of a
drawing compass to the widest space between board and the corner.;    Then, by
holding the pointed arm against the corner and sliding the compass up or down,
scribe the surface of the board with the arm containing the pencil.;    Trim
the board with a saw or plane to the scribed line; the board should then fit
perfectly against the corner.;    This process should also be performed if the
adjacent wall is not to receive wainscoting; if the walls are straight, you
need merely remove the tongue of the board with a plane.;    Fasten the board
to the wall at 16-inch intervals with the same nails used for the molding and
with construction adhesive if desired.;    Install the remaining boards the
same way. Drive the nails at an angle to the wall for maximum holding power.
When nailing into a V-groove, drive the nail into one side of the groove, not
into the center. Scribe and cut the grooved edge of the final board to fit by
following the instructions for the first board.;    After the vertical boards
are in place, fit the chair-rail molding over their tops and nail it to the
wall, using adhesive also if desired.;    Then drive all nails below the
surface with a nail set, fill the depressions above the nail heads with putty,
and either touch these up with penetrating finish or apply the final coat of
paint or surface finish to the wainscoting as directed earlier.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   A flagstone patio is attractive, practical and creates a bridge
between your house and the outdoors.
   It is best built on a level or gently sloping site. When
designing it, consider shade, privacy and access from the house.
Avoid placing it where an overhanging roof will drip water on it as
heavy rains can cause the stones to settle unevenly.
   Flagstones come in many sizes, starting at a nominal 12-inch
stone and increasing by 6-inch increments to 36 inches and
occasionally 42 inches. In reality, the stones are slightly
smaller, by about a {-inch in each direction. Use the nominal size
in your plans since a small space is left between stones.
   Although sold as 1{ inches thick, they actually range from 1{ to
2 inches. Compensate for this by putting more or less san}Wdy|3x~d
beneath each stone.
   When ordering, specify the size of your patio. (The length and
width should be divisible by six inches.)
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Base:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   _ Lay the patio on a 3-inch bed of sand over a 4-inch gravel
base, for drainage. (In areas where ground freezes, it is best to
lay a patio on a reinforced concrete base.)
   _ Use crushed aggregate for the gravel and concrete sand, which
is coarser than mason's sand.
   _ Order these by the cubic yard. To calculate the amount needed,
multiply thickness by width by length. Be sure all measurements are
in feet (for example, 4 inches equals 1-3rd foot). Then divide the
product by 27.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Planninq:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   1. When the flagstones arrive, measure each and record its
dimensions.
   2. Make a scale drawing of the patio on graph paper. Let 1 inch
equal 1 foot.
   3. Using colored paper, cut out a shape representing each stone.
Label each piece, and move the pieces around on the graph paper
until you get a pleasing pattern.
   4. Paste the shapes on the graph paper. This is your plan.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Tools:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   You will need a spade, iron rake, wheelbarrow, hand cart
(optional), prybar, stonemason's chisel, mason's hammer or steel
mallet, hammer, broom, garden hose, safety goggles, disposable
paintbrush, carpenter's level, string, scissors, 4-d galvanized
nails, 1-by-8 pine for forms, 1-by-4 stakes 11 to 12 inches long,
creosote, a 2-by-4 for leveling and another for tamping.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Construction:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   1. Drive temporary stakes at the patio corners, allowing 1{
inches extra on each side for wooden forms. Run string between the
stakes to outline the patio. Measure the diagonals. If the patio is
a true rectangle, they will be equal.
   2. Dig out the soil to a depth of 8{ inches. Be sure the bottom
of the excavation is level. Set aside some turf and topsoil for
later use.
   3. Paint creosote on the 1-by-8 boards for the forms. Also paint
permanent 1-by-4 stakes.
   4. Place the 1-by-8 boards around the perimeter of the
excavation. Drive the permanent stakes at the corners and
additional stakes where the ends of the boards meet. Nail stakes to
form boards with 4-d nails.
   5. Spread gravel in the excavated area to a depth of 4 inches.
Rake it smooth, then use a 2-by-4 level to pack it. Place
carpenter's level on top of the 2-by-4 and move it around to check
the gravel is level.
   6. Spread sand over the gravel. Level and pack it.
   7. Begin laying stones, following the pattern you made. Leave a
{-inch gap between stones. Stand on each stone to make sure it
doesn't teeter. Use a prybar to raise one edge of the stone to
shift its position or to add or remove sand beneath it to make it
level with the other stones. Tamp stones down with a rubber mallet.
   8. Mix sand with some topsoil. Spread the mixture on the patio
and sweep it into the spaces between the stones. Water the surface
to pack down the mixture. Let dry. Repeat with more sand and soil
until the joints are filled. Pack the edges of the patio and cover
the dirt with the turf removed earlier.
   9. Perimeter stones may have to be cut to fit. If so, wear
safety goggles. Pencil a line where a piece is to be cut. Score
along the line, using a chisel and hammer or steel mallet. Score a
line on opposite face. Place a board under the stone, with the
section to be removed overhanging. Tap the excess section with the
hammer or mallet until it breaks off.

<LEADPARA>  Q My 4-year-old son decided to use the living room wall as a canvas for his
new crayon set. I've had problems in the past trying to repaint over stains
when I was unable to completely remove them. What's the best procedure for
dealing with this problem?;    A Your first impulse may be to try to paint
over the stain, but many stains cannot be covered with paint alone. Rust,
grease or oil, crayon wax and magic marker ink may be activated by the solvent
(water or oil) in the paint, and bleed back through the new paint. This is
true regardless of how many coats of paint you apply. You must either seal
over the stain or remove the offending material from the wall before painting.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Peninsula Home  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  PAINT ALONE WON'T COVER MANY STAINS ON WALLS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The best approach is to try to remove the stain material. Check with your
paint dealer for products containing solvents that will remove splattered
latex paints, grease, crayons and other stains. Pour some cleaner on a clean
cloth, wet the stain and let the cleaner work for a couple of minutes. If you
just try to scrub the stain away, you may also remove some wall paint.;    If
the stain comes off the paint, spot prime the stain area and then repaint the
wall.;    If the stain proves difficult to remove, you can seal in almost any
stain with a shellac sealer. The shellac is fast-drying so it does not
activate the stain material, but covers it over.;    To avoid the shiny spots
due to higher sheen over the shellac sealer, seal the entire wall with
shellac, not just the stain.;    Q We've just bought a 50-year-old house. Not
surprisingly, the floors are sagging. How big a job would it be to straighten
them out, or should I just forget it? Structurally, everything seems to be in
good shape.;    A In older houses, built before lumber was graded for
strength, sagging floors were a common problem. Fixing them is hard work, but
is a possible project for the ambitious remodeler.;    First determine how
much sag or deflection you have. This can be measured while a helper holds a
straight-edge that spans the floor from wall to wall. Or, measure the distance
from the basement floor to the bottom edge of the floor joist, both where the
ends of the joist rest on a center wall or support beam, and at the center,
where the sag is greatest.;    To straighten the floor, you'll need a helper
or two, a scissors or hydraulic jack, extra joists the same size and length as
existing joists, a 4-by-4 long enough to reach from the top of the jack to the
bottom edge of the joists, a supply of 16d nails, a hammer and a rule.;    Set
the jack under the center joist, at the center of the room. Measure and cut
the 4-by-4 post so it reaches from atop the jack to the bottom edge of the
joist. Now, working carefully, and being sure the 4-by-4 post is exactly
plumb, use the jack to raise the post and jack the sagged joist until it is
level. Depending on the amount of sag you have, you may want to do this in
stages and use temporary props to prop each floor joist until they are all
raised, then complete the job in a second stage.;    When the joist is level,
set a new joist alongside the old joist. The ends of the new joists must be
setting atop the foundation on one side and the support beam or wall on the
other side. While the jack holds the old joist straight, drive the 16d nails
through the new joist and into the old one. Nail the two doubled joists
together at 16-inch intervals. Remove the jack and check to be sure the joists
are now straight.  </TEXT>

When ordering, specify the size of your patio. (The length and width should be 
divisible by 6 inches.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Base 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lay the patio on a 3-inch bed of sand over a 4-inch gravel base, for 
drainage. (In areas where theground freezes, it is best to lay a patio on a 
reinforced concrete base.) 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use crushed aggregate for the gravel and concrete sand, which is coarser 
than mason's sand. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Order these by the cubic yard. To calculate the amount needed, multiply 
thickness by width by length. Be sure all measurements are in feet (for 
example, 4 inches equals one-third of a foot). Then divide the product by 27. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Planning 
</P>
<P>
1. When the flagstones arrive, measure each and record its dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
2. Make a scale drawing of the patio on graph paper. Let 1 inch equal 1 foot. 
</P>
<P>
3. Using colored paper, cut out a shape representing each stone. Label each 
piece, and move the pieces around on the graph paper until you get a pleasing 
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
4. Paste the shapes on the graph paper. This is your plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tools 
</P>
<P>
You will need a spade, iron rake, wheelbarrow, hand cart (optional), pry bar, 
stonemason's chisel, mason's hammer or steel mallet, hammer, broom, garden 
hose, safety goggles, disposable paintbrush, carpenter's level, string, 
scissors, 4-d galvanized nails, 1-by-8 pine for forms, 1-by-4 stakes 11 to 12 
inches long, creosote, a 2-by-4 for leveling and another for tamping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Construction 
</P>
<P>
1. Drive temporary stakes at the patio corners, allowing 1 1/2 inches extra on 
each side for wooden forms. Run string between the stakes to outline the patio. 
Measure the diagonals. If the patio is a true rectangle, they will be equal. 
</P>
<P>
2. Dig out the soil to a depth of 8 1/2 inches. Be sure the bottom of the 
excavation is level. Set aside some turf and topsoil for later use. 
</P>
<P>
3. Paint creosote on the 1-by-8 boards for the forms. Also paint permanent 
1-by-4 stakes. 
</P>
<P>
4. Place the 1-by-8 boards around the perimeter of the excavation. Drive the 
permanent stakes at the corners and additional stakes where the ends of the 
boards meet. Nail stakes to form boards with 4-d nails. 
</P>
<P>
5. Spread gravel in the excavated area to a depth of 4 inches. Rake it smooth, 
then use a 2-by-4 level to pack it. Place carpenter's level on top of the 
2-by-4 and move it around to check if the gravel is level. 
</P>
<P>
6. Spread sand over the gravel. Level and pack it. 
</P>
<P>
7. Begin laying stones, following the pattern you made. Leave a 1/2-inch gap 
between stones. Stand on each stone to make sure it doesn't teeter. Use a pry 
bar to raise one edge of the stone to shift its position or to add or remove 
sand beneath it to make it level with the other stones. Tamp stones down with a 
rubber mallet. 
</P>
<P>
8. Mix sand with some topsoil. Spread the mixture on the patio and sweep it 
into the spaces between the stones. Water the surface to pack down the mixture. 
Let dry. Repeat with more sand and soil until the joints are filled. Pack the 
edges of the patio and cover the dirt with the turf removed earlier. 
</P>
<P>
9. Perimeter stones may have to be cut to fit. If so, wear safety goggles. 
Pencil a line where a piece is to be cut. Score along the line, using a chisel 
and hammer or steel mallet. Score a line on opposite face. Place a board under 
the stone, with the section to be removed overhanging. Tap the excess section 
with the hammer or mallet until it breaks off.

<LEADPARA>  Q How can I get the mildew smell out of a mattress that was stored in the
cellar? I don't see mildew, but I sure can smell it.;    A Bleach and sunshine
should take care of it. And, as you have learned, a mattress should not be
stored in a basement. Make a solution of one part bleach and 3 to six parts
water. Dip a sponge in it, squeeze it out and wipe all surfaces of the
mattress. Leave the mattress in direct sun for as long as practical. If the
mildew is on the inside of the mattress, it is unlikely that you will ever get
the odor out. Wear rubber gloves when working with bleach.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Q I found a few medium-sized carpenter ants in a porch post, and several
big ones in the house. The bottom of the post was soft, and I think I found
the nest and applied granular Diazinon and wiped it out. How can I keep the
ants away? And how can I fix the post?;    A You can't be sure the ants are
carpenters without identification, but it's safe to say yours are carpenters.
The ones in the house might be lost; the ones in the post were right where
carpenters ants like to work: damp, punky wood. If there is no other punky
wood on or in the house, chances are fair that you won't get carpenter ants.; 
  For the post, shore up the roof of the porch with temporary 2-by-4 or 4-by-4
braces, and check to see how far the decay of the post has gone. If it is just
a few inches, cut it off until you get to sound, dry wood, and install a thick
base in place of the old base, or put in a large base and a slightly smaller
base on top of that. If the decay has gone up more than a few inches, replace
the entire post.;    Q I chipped out a section of plaster ceiling three feet
long and 15 inches wide where a leak from the bathroom above softened it in my
1950s house. The plaster is only about 1/8-inch thick, and underneath is a
grainy, coarse plaster that is darker. Can I replaster that section?;    A You
certainly can cover that area, if the coarse plaster is not crumbling or
powdering. The coarse plaster is a scratch or brown coat of a real plaster
ceiling. Use joint compound to fill the space. Buy a rectangular plasterer's
trowel to do a decent job of applying the joint compound. Dampen the coarse
plaster and apply the joint compound with the big trowel. Wait a few minutes
and smooth it off so that it is level with the original surface. After
everything is dry, sand ridges and bumps. Wait at least two weeks before
painting the ceiling with two thin coats of latex ceiling paint.;    Q Can
siding be put over old asbestos cement shingles?;    A Some outfits put vinyl
siding over asbestos cement shingles, but I think it's a bad thing to do.
Nailing into asbestos shingles will break them up, and asbestos fibers could
be released, something that should be avoided. If the shingles break up,
pieces may drop out of position and get stuck, preventing a smooth surface for
the new siding. Predrilling holes through the asbestos for the nails of the
new siding is just as bad or worse, releasing fibers into the air. An
alternative is to have the shingles removed (very expensive) and new shingles
or clapboards put up over the original finish. Another alternative is to paint
the asbestos cement shingles with two coats of latex house paint.;    Q I plan
to put a railing on the deck on my Victorian house (it's the original "This
Old House"), and I'd like to make it Victorian like the house itself. Where
can I get fancy spindles and rails? How far apart should they be?;    A You
can get fancy turned spindles or balusters at almost any lumber store; some
have special displays set up and you can take your choice. Most are
pressure-treated wood, which is OK to use in this application. There are many
styles of balusters and rails to match, both top rail and bottom rail, the
latter raised a few inches above the floor. The rails are rounded on the top
for water runoff. And, there are posts that hold the rails in place. Balusters
can be close together or far apart, but close enough to keep little heads from
getting stuck between them. Put them 4 inches on center, meaning the center of
one is 4 inches from the center of its neighbor. If the balusters are 1 1/2
inches wide, there will be 2 1/2 inches of space between them. Of course, you
will want to space the balusters so the space will be the same from one end of
the rail to the other.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Man Shot In Head With Nail Gun Should Be OK, Doctor Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DULUTH, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nail accidentally fired from a nail gun
penetrated about 1{ inches into a carpenter's brain and nailed his
cap to his head, but the doctor who removed the nail said he
shouldn't suffer any serious effects.
   ``I've had worse headaches,'' said carpenter Lance Grangruth,
who said the headache was the only complication he suffered.
   ``I didn't actually feel it go in,'' he said. ``I heard the gun
go off.
   ``I tried to take my hat off and it wouldn't come off. Then I
knew it had gone in.''
   Dr. William Himango said he used pliers Monday to remove the
2-inch nail from the frontal lobe of Grangruth's brain at St.
Luke's Hospital. Grangruth, of Barnum, was kept in intensive care
for observation.
   ``If he were to pick a place to put a nail in, he picked exactly
the right place to put it in,'' Himango said.
   The same injury to other parts of the brain could have caused
functional damage or death, Himango said.
   Grangruth was working on a garage Monday in Hermantown when a
co-worker, perched on a ladder, lowered his arm while holding the
gun's trigger, said police Officer Dan Perich. The co-worker didn't
realize Grangruth was standing below.
   Although the co-worker was holding the regular trigger, a nail
gun won't fire until a safety trigger at the muzzle also is
depressed by pushing it against the work surface where the nail is
wanted.
   When the gun touched Grangruth's head it went off, with 120
pounds of air pressure driving an 8-penny galvanized nail _ about
an eighth-inch thick _ through his baseball cap and into his
forehead.
   Grangruth and his co-worker went to a nearby house to call an
ambulance.
   Perich found Grangruth alert and a little pale, but not bleeding.
   ``He was sitting on the couch talking,'' Perich said. ``He
walked around with the nail in his head.''

<LEADPARA>  REPLACING an outside door -- for appearance, security or energy efficiency --
may sound like a daunting task. But home centers and building-supply stores
carry pre-hung entry doors, already mounted in a frame, that amateurs with
some carpentry experience will find quite easy to install.;    Before ordering
the door, you need to measure the doorway in several places. Door frames are
seldom exactly true -- perfectly vertical and horizontal -- so determine the
average height and width.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Peninsula Home  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  REPLACING A DOOR IS NOT A DAUNTING TASK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     For the average height, measure in two places from the underside of the
frame at the top of the doorway to the base of the threshold's saddle directly
below, or to the floor if the threshold is removable.;    For the average
width, measure in three places between the inside surfaces of the door frame's
sides, or jambs. These will be the surfaces that the door's edges touch when
it is closed.;    When you receive the door, open the carton carefully to
inspect it and study the manufacturer's instructions. Do not remove any clips
or other retainers fastening the door to the frame.;    Begin the installation
by removing the existing door and all hardware attached to the frame. Also pry
off the interior casing -- the molding surrounding the doorway inside the
building. If the casing is intact, it can be reused.;    The instructions
supplied with the door will specify how to modify the existing threshold to
accept the pre-hung door frame.;    Using shims;    If you are working with
the old door frame, you will usually need to nail thin wooden wedges called
shims to the jambs so the pre-hung door frame will fit closely in the
doorway.;    Shims are available at lumberyards, but they come with most doors
of this kind, along with a chart telling how many to use.;    Apply caulking
compound to the surface beneath the new door's threshold. Now the pre-hung
door and frame can be inserted into the doorway.;    Before it is fastened,
the frame of the pre-hung door must be trued with a builder's level. First,
place the level on top of the door frame to see that it is horizontal, then
alongside the door to see that it is vertical. If it is not, install more
shims behind the top and sides of the frame to brace it in the correct
position.;    When the adjustments are made, drive tenpenny (2-inch) common
nails, or those supplied, through the pre-drilled holes in the new frame to
attach it to the existing frame.;    Then open the door and install long
screws (also usually supplied) through the the predrilled holes in the sides
and top of the door frame to fasten it completely. When the door is closed,
the heads of the fasteners will be hidden.;    If the existing door frame has
to come off, you will need a helper, who need not be skilled, to install the
pre-hung door. Pry away the door frame and exterior trim to expose the studs
around the opening.;    Apply caulk;    Modify the existing threshold as
specified in the instructions; then apply caulk to the surface that beneath
the threshold of the pre-hung door.;    With the helper standing inside the
house, set the pre-hung door and frame into the doorway from the outside. Hold
a builder's level alongside the vertical brick mold (the molding that overlaps
the studs forming the doorway) on the door's hinge side.;    Have the helper
adjust the door frame until the level shows that both the face and an adjacent
edge of the brick mold are vertical.;    Then fasten the brick mold to the
stud on the hinge side of the opening by driving a 16-penny (3 1/2-inch)
galvanized finishing nail through the brick mold, perpendicular to the siding,
at the top, middle and bottom of the frame.;    From inside, fill any gap
between the door frame and the opening by inserting shims at each hinge
location and also at the top and bottom of the jamb.;    Then go outside and
at each of the shim locations drive a pair of 16-penny galvanized finishing
nails through the jamb and shims and into the stud, parallel to the siding.;  
 Open the door and adjust the remaining jamb from outside so the molding or
weatherstripping touching the door makes even contact with it all the way
around.;    Proper gaps;    There should be a gap of three-eighths of an inch
between the bottom of the door and the threshold, and a gap of three
thirty-seconds of an inch between the latch side of the door and the frame.;  
 Then nail through the brick mold or flanges, add shims from inside and fasten
the jamb permanently. Pack any gaps between shims with fiberglass insulation.;
   Now mount the door hardware, reattach the interior casing and any other
trim, and add weatherstripping or caulking as specified in the instructions.
And your new door is ready, usually after no more than an afternoon's work.  </TEXT>

<DESCRIPT>  GARDEN; REPAIR; EQUIPMENT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  USING screws instead of nails for fastening decks and other outdoor
woodworking projects will often give a neater appearance and reduce some
maintenance problems.;    Screwed-together decks have several advantages over
nailed construction, including extra strength and simpler disassembly if
repairs are needed. Top-quality screws also reduce or eliminate rust and
corrosion of fasteners, which are common even with hot-dipped galvanized nails
because hammer blows can chip the coating.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  TOP-QUALITY FASTENERS REDUCE RUST, CORROSION
SCREWS BEAT NAILS FOR DECKS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Do It Yourself  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Some home centers and building-supply outlets sell decking screws with
Phillips-style heads (X-shaped slots), treated for weather resistance by
galvanizing or other plating processes. Stainless-steel screws are also
available but are relatively expensive.;    All deck screws have slim,
straight shanks and coarse threads for easy driving, and the thin heads sink
fairly easily into decking without countersinking. Pilot holes, slightly
smaller than the screw diameter, make driving easier and prevent splitting,
especially when screws are used close to edges and ends of boards.;    Deck
builders who want to go a step further can use what might well be the best
deck screw so far.;    Good grip, control;    The head of this rust-resistant
screw features a combination square drive and Phillips drive -- a deep, square
recess in the head that gives excellent grip and control with a square-end
driver. The screw head also has notches at the corners of the recess so that a
Phillips driver can be used if a square driver is not available.;    The head
design, called Square-X by one manufacturer, virtually eliminates slipping if
a square driver is used, which means a power screwdriver will not jump out of
the head and mar decking boards.;    A source of Square-X screws in lengths
from 1 1/4-inch to three inches, as well as square-tip drivers and bits, is
Woodworkers' Store, Industrial Boulevard, Rogers, Minn. 55374. A catalog is
$1, refundable with a product order.;    Power driving is almost essential
when using screws for decks or other projects in which many screws must be
driven.;    I have had good results using a variable-speed, cordless
drill-driver that has the proper speed and torque for driving screws. A
regular variable-speed drill can also be used, but the high torque can drive
screws too deeply into the wood and, unless a square driver is used, can also
cause the bit to skip out of screw heads.;    Stop that screw;    One
solution, if a regular power drill must be used, is to equip it with a clutch
adapter that causes the driver to stop turning when the screw is properly
seated. A clutch adapter costs $20 to $25. A source is Leichtung Workshops,
4944 Commerce Parkway, Cleveland, Ohio 44128 (catalog free).;    When 2-by-4s
are used for decking, some builders save time and fasteners with a zigzag
fastening system. In this system, only one screw or nail is driven through the
deck board into each intersection with the beam or joist underneath (beams are
usually centered 16 inches apart).;    Each fastener is spaced about
three-quarters of an inch from the edge of the deck board, first near one
edge, then near the opposite edge at the next joint, forming a neat zigzag
pattern. However, if boards wider than 2-by-4s are used, I prefer two
fasteners at each beam joint to help prevent warping and twisting.;    New
treatment for wood;    One of the newer products for deck builders is
pressure-treated wood that is treated for water repellency as well as
resistance to wood-damaging insects and rot. Hickson Corp.'s Wolmanized Extra
is an example. The factory-applied water-repellency treatment is intended to
help combat the splitting and twisting that mar the appearance of many
projects built with pressure-treated wood.;    A problem is that users of this
extra-cost, pressure-treated wood might assume that the water-repellency
treatment is as long-range as the treatment for rot and insects. Actually,
follow-up treatments with a water-repellent sealer will be needed to give the
wood full protection.;    Manufacturers have been somewhat fuzzy on when
follow-up treatments are needed for the special wood. Hickson Corp. recently
made these comments, which help clarify the matter: "Even these new products
cannot prevent weather damage forever. . . . Foot traffic and sunshine breaks
down the water repellency at the wood's surface.;    "Periodic application
(every year or two, depending on conditions) of a topical water repellent
restores surface protection and keeps a wood deck looking its best."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  'LOLLAPALOOZA" is one of those words that defies specific definition but whose
meaning is obvious anyway. Think of the word for a moment; now think of the
tour of the same name. It fits.;    The Lollapalooza tour came to Shoreline
Amphitheater for shows Friday and Saturday. And, yes, it was a "lollapalooza"
in just about every way.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  WHAT A LOLLAPALOOZA!  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Music Review  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It was big: Seven groups performed onstage, with scores of extra groups
doing their various things on the concourse, along with activist organizations
like Rock The Vote and Greenpeace. It was brash: Schiavo Hair Dressing At
Large (a holdover hit from the recent event Gathering of the Tribes) sculpted
and moussed the fans' hair on a stage on the concourse; and the avant-gardists
of Piano Bell From Hell slammed away at various destroyed keyboards and yelled
obscenities.;    And Lollapalooza was a hit: Friday's show was a sellout to
the tune of 20,000 fans, and Saturday's was nearly the same.;    But what
really set this tour apart from its counterparts, such as Tribes and Operation
Rock &amp; Roll, was that Lollapalooza made a musical point. And that point, too,
was a lollapalooza.;    The point was that rock 'n' roll hasn't necessarily
come to a dead end. All of the groups of this tour were at the cutting edge of
pop. In their ways, each was proof that there are, perhaps, new ideas to be
explored and that they are being explored.;    And, in their ways, each group
was making rock that was infused with energy and excitement and provocation.
It didn't make all of them good, necessarily, but it made each of them
intriguing.;    The Rollins Band opened the day with a slashing sound that
served as the backdrop and counterpoint to leader Rollins' vocal histrionics.
The former Black Flag member shouted the words to the songs with an intensity
and fervor that were compelling. It was an abrasive set, with metallic chords
and monolithic rhythms, almost rock as some sort of expressive release. It
wasn't pretty, but then, it wasn't intended to be.;    The Texas-based
Butthole Surfers came next, with a musical assault that was equally abrasive,
but more orchestrated. Vocalist Gibby Haynes spent most of his time intoning
his words into a bullhorn, while the rest of the group created a cacophonous
sound that was raw and unlistenable. It wasn't rock as much as noise.;   
Ice-T rap;  "We didn't come here to party for you; we came to party with you,"
rapper Ice-T yelled at the start of his set. He said much else, most of which
is unprintable in a family newspaper. Performing songs from his new record
"O.G. Original Gangster," Ice-T baited the crowd with raps laced liberally
with the "F" and "N" words. But when he closed his performance with his new
heavy metal group, Body Count, he churned out blaring, edgy rock that proved a
point of its own. "Rock has nothing to do with color," he shouted. "It is a
state of mind.";    The real hit of this show -- in every way -- was Nine Inch
Nails. Performing on a hi-tech set that came with strobes and fog (that was
blown out at the crowd), the group created an industrial sound that clanked
and bonked electronically but that also had a melodic grandeur and thematic
cohesion that engaged the mind as much as the solar plexus. Leader Trent
Reznor was a maniac speaking his vocals like an automaton while hurling
guitars and drinking cups and mic stands at his mates. The violence was
innocent and disturbing; when paired with the dense and mechanistic songs, it
resulted in a set that was electrifying.;    Pop-tinged metal;  Of all the
groups, Living Colour and Siouxsie and the Banshees were the most
anachronistic, but just barely. Living Colour's metal was pop-tinged and
driven by the instrumental virtuosity of guitarist Vernon Reid. But Reid's
furious forays of sound, notwithstanding, the group seemed somewhat arch and
staid compared with the confrontational music of Rollins and the rest.;    The
punk siren, Siouxisie, seemed similarly innocuous. Even the exotic songs of
the new album "Superstition" had an older feel with their complex
juxtapositions of punk and Eastern themes. But while Siouxsie was dated,
somewhat, that was tolerable because, as one of the original punks of '70s
London, she is one of the progenitors of the rest of Lollapalooza's legions.; 
  Alluring Jane's Addiction;  The spearhead of the tour was Jane's Addiction
and they closed the event with a performance that was annoying -- and
entrancing. The songs of "Ritual de lo Habitual" were a varied lot, ranging
from nervy, noisy rockers to brooding ballads, all of which had a
thrash/punk/metal bite and bluster. And with two female dancers cavorting amid
looming, swaying palm trees and statues, there was a visual allure that made
the group and its songs seem mysterious. But the sophomoric mumblings of Perry
Farrell about sex and, ah, size and such were constantly distracting. And his
helium vocals were an inadvertent hoot -- he sounded like a cross between
Johnny Rotten and a punkish Pee Wee Herman.;    But good or bad, all of the
groups of Lollapalooza were doing their best to inspire and provoke. Their
music was a slap in the face. Thanks, rock needs that.  </TEXT>

MAKE YOUR OWN BED WITH PLYWOOD SHEETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
If you were lucky, your mother taught you how to make your bed. If not, it was 
your drill sergeant. Be that as it may, I'm going to teach you all over again. 
</P>
<P>
But I'm not talking about hospital corners and bouncing quarters. I'm talking 
about making a bed -- with wood, glue, screws and nails. 
</P>
<P>
It's a very simple project, really -- little more than a simple plywood box 
with the sleeping platform set down two inches into the frame. You can make it 
in any size to fit any mattress. In fact, it's best to buy your mattress first, 
then size the bed to fit. That's why I haven't supplied any dimensions in the 
sketch. 
</P>
<P>
Start by cutting out the sides and ends. Make them 20 inches high, unless you 
prefer a bed higher or lower than normal. Cut the end pieces about an inch 
longer than the width of your mattress, and make the sides about an inch longer 
than the length of the mattress. 
</P>
<P>
Material? Your best bet probably is birch plywood. It takes paint well, and 
also looks good -- stained or unstained -- under a varnish finish. It's also 
smoother and more uniform than ordinary fir plywood. 
</P>
<P>
For the framework, use ordinary fir 2-by-3s. But sort through the pile to get 
the straightest pieces you can find. Start the frame by cutting out four corner 
posts, and two center posts, each 14 1/2inches long. Using 1 1/2-inch flat-head 
screws and yellow glue, fasten these posts to the sides and ends. Drive the 
screws through the plywood into the frame, countersinking the heads below 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
Note the corner detail in the sketch. The ends and sides do not overlap each 
other. They join corner to corner, creating a pocket. Later you'll fill this 
pocket with a quarter round molding, giving the bed nice soft corners. 
</P>
<P>
After the corner posts are in place, glue and screw in the center posts. Center 
these end to end on the side panels. Next, cut a center cross brace, the same 
length as your end panels. Place this on edge atop the center posts and secure 
it with a pair of screws, through the sides of the bed at each end. 
</P>
<P>
Now finish off the framework, cutting the side and end rails to length, placing 
one edge atop the posts and securing them with glue and screws. 
</P>
<P>
You are now ready to cut and fit the sleeping platform. Unless you are making a 
single bed, you will have to cut the platform out of two sheets of plywood, 
running a seam directly over the center brace. You can use half-inch plywood 
for a single bed, but for larger beds, three-quarter-inch plywood will produce 
a stiffer surface. 
</P>
<P>
Cut the platform about a quarter inch undersize. This makes it easier to fit 
it. After the pieces are cut, lay them on top of the framework. Using a frame 
square, check to make sure that the bed is dead square. If it isn't, you can 
force it true without much effort. 
</P>
<P>
Once it it square, fasten the platform down with several screws driven into the 
frame. This will lock the bed rigidly in position and it won't be able to move 
out of square. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing up. Now you have to cover the top edges of the plywood. You can use 
iron or glue-on wood tape for this, but I like to use half-round moldings. Cut 
these the same length as your side and end panels and fasten them down using 
yellow glue and small finishing nails. Then cut four pieces of 
three-quarter-inch quarter round 20 1/2 inches long and glue and nail them into 
the corners of the bed as shown in the detail. Using a rasp, finish off the top 
ends of these quarter rounds so the blend in with the half-round moldings on 
the side and end panels. 
</P>
<P>
Fill over all screw and nail heads using wood dough or polyester auto body 
filler. Let set, then sand and finish. Your best bet is probably three or four 
coats of a good semi-gloss oil base enamel. Sand lightly between coats with 
220-grit paper. If you want a natural finish, use a good alkyd or polyurethane 
varnish instead of enamel. Stain before varnishing if you like.

INTERIORS: THE MAGIC OF A HOME WITH WOODEN FLOORS; 
</P>
<P>
INTERIORS: THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHOICES IN THE TYPE OF WOODS AVAILABLE WHEN 
INSTALLING FLOORS, MANY OF THEM ARE PREFINISHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LOIS GIBSON, Gibson is a Malibu free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each year, manufacturers introduce new, improved types of man-made flooring, 
all perfectly uniform. But wood remains a universal favorite for its durability 
and the timeless, matchless charm of its natural irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
A tree trunk is ringed because the large, soft cells of its rapid springtime 
growth contrast with the dark, dense cells of its slower summer growth. 
Cellular structure determines the density, direction, color and pattern of each 
tree's grain. 
</P>
<P>
Today, most flooring is made from logs cheaply slash-cut with circular band 
saws. A century ago, more flooring was sawed at an angle. This costlier method 
produces elaborately patterned edge-grain on two faces, revealing the full 
beauty of the wood. 
</P>
<P>
Because moisture makes it swell and warp, raw lumber must be dried in an 
artificially heated kiln that evaporates three-fourths of the wood's sap and 
cellular fluid. Another 10% is forced from cell walls, shrinking boards across 
the grain to create hard, strong, light flooring. 
</P>
<P>
Such softwoods as pine, fir and redwood are often used for Colonial or rustic 
plank floors with beveled edge to simulate cracks and walnut plugs to simulate 
antique pegs. Budget-minded remodelers sometimes floor older homes with 
1-by-6-inch tongued-and-grooved pine roofing boards secured by quaint, 
old-fashioned, oblong-headed cut nails. 
</P>
<P>
However, as softwoods are less wear-resistant because their cells are less 
dense, hardwood strips far outsell them. In greatest demand are 3/4-by-2 
1/4-inch oak strips of random length, installed at zigzag intervals or in a 
herringbone pattern. For snug fit, each strip is milled with a projecting 
tongue on one side and a groove on the other. Nails driven through tongues are 
hidden by grooves. 
</P>
<P>
Experts differ as to whether ends should be tongued-and-grooved. Some contend 
that square-edged strips with interlocking sides lie just as flat. Others 
insist they squeak. According to Jim Martin of Malibu Lumber, "the tighter the 
fit, the stronger the floor." 
</P>
<P>
Square-edged strips require face-nailing and "may throw off stability," warns 
Jeff Brotman of Virginia Hardwood, "because boards want to move as much as they 
can." 
</P>
<P>
Parquet flooring is another popular wood floor. Block parquets are solid, 
unfinished, tongued-and-grooved squares composed of hardwood pieces splined 
together to form a decorative mosaic. 
</P>
<P>
Oak is, again, the most popular wood, 12-by-12-inch the most popular size, 
alternating cross-matched strips the most popular pattern. However, blocks from 
4-by-4 inches to 4-by-4 feet are made in a dazzling array of tones and woods, 
forming intricate patterns copied from palaces throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
Laminated parquets are cheaper squares of thin board, bonded together like 
plywood, sold by floor-covering dealers. They are set into mastic, much like 
resilient tiles. Todd Hamar of Galleher Hardwood says, "Laminates are not on a 
par with block parquets, but they come in attractive patterns and, unlike 
blocks, they can be installed by do-it-yourselfers." 
</P>
<P>
In his book, "Hardwood Flooring," expert Dan Ramsey cautions homeowners to buy 
only from reputable dealers. He adds that, if buyers tell dealers they are 
shopping around for discounted flooring, most retailers "will either work out 
some type of discount or . . . suggest when that discount will be available." 
</P>
<P>
About half of America's strip flooring is sold prefinished, a boon for 
non-professional installers. Prefinished floors are virtually maintenance-free. 
</P>
<P>
Renovators are advised to scratch a coin against an old, discolored floor. If 
the finish doesn't flake off, it is probably penetrating seal, which can be 
restored without sanding. Sometimes worn, dingy floors merely need a 
wax-stripper, a new coat of linseed oil, a treatment with turpentine-soaked 
steel wool to remove old shellac or a liquid varnish remover and a light 
sanding. 
</P>
<P>
Unfinished and ruined floors require a great deal more work and are best left 
to professionals. Mistakes in installation and finishing are apt to cost far 
more than the fee charged by a professional who knows how to match obsolete 
patterns, protect and beautify wood, make new floors look antique and old 
floors look new. 
</P>
<P>
Once the floor has been installed or restored to its original luster, it should 
never be washed or wet-mopped. Scrubbing rots wood. However impervious the 
finish, water can seep between boards to stain and warp them. All the floor 
needs is vacuuming or dust-mopping, an occasional buff to remove heel marks and 
rewaxing once or twice a year. 
</P>
<P>
DAMAGE CONTROL 
</P>
<P>
Buy good flooring. 
</P>
<P>
Carefully inspect floorboards before accepting delivery. 
</P>
<P>
If lumber is stored outdoors, protect it from dampness. 
</P>
<P>
Acclimate new flooring by storing it two to three days in the room where it 
will be installed. 
</P>
<P>
Do all necessary painting before installing the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Never install flooring until all interior concrete is dry. 
</P>
<P>
Flooring over a cement slab requires special protection and expert advice. 
</P>
<P>
Never install wood floors in a damp basement or one susceptible to flooding. 
</P>
<P>
When estimating cost, remember that quoted lumber dimensions are less than 
actual size (a 2-by-4 measures 1 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches). Dan Ramsey's rule of 
thumb: actual board footage equals number of pieces by thickness by width by 
length divided by 12. 
</P>
<P>
Insulate floors over furnaces and heating ducts to prevent future cracks. 
</P>
<P>
Insulate to soundproof upstairs floors. 
</P>
<P>
When planning floors, never assume walls are straight. They seldom are. 
</P>
<P>
For a professional look, frame obstacles, such as hearths and pillars, with 
mitered molding. 
</P>
<P>
Save short flooring strips for doorways and closets. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid hollows, never let a turned-on drum sander touch the ground unless it 
is moving. 
</P>
<P>
Dust thoroughly after each sanding. 
</P>
<P>
When applying finish, always allow recommended drying time between coats. 
</P>
<P>
If a damaged spot cannot be invisibly patched, refinish the entire floorboard. 
</P>
<P>
When moving heavy furniture, slide it along the floor on a scrap of blanket or 
carpeting. 
</P>
<P>
Rubber, plastic and foam-backed mats may discolor floors. 
</P>
<P>
Put cups under metal furniture casters. 
</P>
<P>
If humidity exceeds 50%, ventilate rooms to keep floorboards from swelling. 
</P>
<P>
In very cold or dry weather, humidify rooms to keep floorboards from shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
In rainy weather, close windows, protect exterior doorways, repair leaks and 
don't track water across the floor. 
</P>
<P>
FLOOR REPAIR 
</P>
<P>
For fine lines and cracks in hardwood: humidify room. 
</P>
<P>
For cracks between softwood planks: clean out and pack with hemp rope or a wood 
glue-and-sawdust paste. (plastic fillers shrink.) Span very wide cracks with 
wood strips. Sand, stain and rewax. 
</P>
<P>
For "bouncy" floors: check beneath house for undersized joists. Hire a 
professional to stabilize or augment them. 
</P>
<P>
For a squeaky floorboard: for wet weather squeak, soak with liquid wax. Or pour 
talcum powder or powdered graphite between boards. For persistent squeak, drive 
triangular glaziers' points between boards. Tamp down with a putty knife. Or 
countersink 2-inch finishing nails through both ends of board, putty nail 
holes, sand and wax. 
</P>
<P>
For creaking floors: see whether nails holding subfloor to joists have 
loosened. If so, drive wedge between joist and loose subfloor board. If several 
boards are loose, nail a strip of wood across them and secure it to joist. 
</P>
<P>
For a loose board in the finish floor: countersink 2-inch finishing nails with 
a nail punch, angling them into subfloor. Putty, sand and stain nail holes. 
Rewax. 
</P>
<P>
For warped, bulging finish floorboards: cover with heavy paper and a plank. Tap 
plank sharply with a hammer, taking care not to split tongued-and-grooved 
edges. 
</P>
<P>
For sagging or inward-sloping floors: see if girders or joists have been 
undermined by rot or termites. Fumigate if necessary. Raise gradually, a few 
turns per day, with horizontal timbers supported by concrete-footed jack posts 
or screw-jacks and vertical timbers. 
</P>
<P>
For outward-sloping floors: raise gradually with jack posts beneath outer 
edges. 
</P>
<P>
For old floors at different levels in different rooms: install threshholds to 
mask discrepancies. 
</P>
<P>
To replace damaged floorboards: hire a professional. 
</P>
<P>
To match a few obsolete floorboards: steal them from an inconspicuous area, 
such as a closet. 
</P>
<P>
To duplicate a roomful of obsolete floorboards: ask a professional to find the 
same type of lumber and "age" it to match. 
</P>
<P>
To replace a damaged parquet square: check to see if it is screwed as well as 
glued. Remove. Scrape off old mastic. Glue in new square. 
</P>
<P>
To repair loose strips in a parquet block: find and eliminate the dampness that 
loosened them. Reglue. 
</P>
<P>
To replace a missing piece of parquetry: trim jagged edges. Scrape out old 
mastic. Outline cavity on tracing paper. Darken back of paper with soft pencil. 
Find a similar strip of wood, making sure grain goes the right way. Press 
tracing paper on wood, shaded side down. Re-outline shape on wood. Cut out with 
utility knife. Sand underside to proper thickness. Stain if necessary. Glue in. 
Replicate dark outline with felt pen. 
</P>
<P>
For swollen veneer: cover with cardboard. Press with a hot iron, bearing down 
hard. Leave a heavy weight on cardboard for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
For dents: cover with a damp cloth. Steam-iron. 
</P>
<P>
For scratches: use filler, then wax. Or buy a touch-up kit from flooring 
dealer. 
</P>
<P>
For worm holes: with an oilcan, squirt commercial wood worm solution into 
holes. Let stand 24 hours. Wipe off excess. Patch holes with filler. Sand and 
wax. 
</P>
<P>
STAIN REMOVAL 
</P>
<P>
Alcohol spots: rub with wax, silver polish, boiled linseed oil or a cloth 
lightly dampened with ammonia. 
</P>
<P>
Bloodstains: rub with wax-stripper. Rewax. 
</P>
<P>
Chewing gum, candle wax and crayon: apply a plastic bag filled with ice cubes. 
Leave on until substance is brittle enough to crumble. Wax stripper or cleaning 
fluid poured around the area, not on it, may loosen substance. 
</P>
<P>
Cigarette burns: for shallow burns, rub lightly with fine steel wool dampened 
with soap and water. Wipe with damp cloth. Dry thoroughly. For deep burns, 
carefully sand away, fill indentation, fine-sand smooth and rewax. 
</P>
<P>
Dark spots, ink stains and pet or diaper stains: if fresh, wash off and bleach 
with lemon juice on a cotton pad. If old, scrub spot and surrounding area with 
No. 1 steel wool moistened with floor cleaner. Pour on vinegar. Leave three to 
four hours. If spot remains, carefully pour on household bleach. Leave two 
hours. If spot remains, fine-sand, feathering into surrounding area. Rewax and 
buff. If spot remains, bleach with 1 ounce oxalic acid in 1 quart water. Wear 
gloves. It is toxic. Let stand one hour. Sponge with clean water. Repeat if 
necessary. If spot remains, sand with 00 paper and feather new finish into 
surrounding area. Rub lightly with 00 steel wool. Apply a second coat. Dry and 
rewax. 
</P>
<P>
Dried milk or food: rub with damp cloth. Dry. Rewax. 
</P>
<P>
Heel and caster marks: rub lightly with fine steel wool moistened with floor 
cleaner. Wipe dry. Polish. 
</P>
<P>
Mold or mildew: ventilate room. Rub with a good floor cleaner or cleaning 
fluid. 
</P>
<P>
Oil and grease: rub with strong kitchen soap. Or cover with white tissue paper 
and press with a hot iron to soak up stain. Or rub with lighter fluid. Or cover 
with a cotton pad saturated in hydrogen peroxide and top with another pad 
saturated in household ammonia. Repeat until stain is gone. Then clean, dry and 
rewax. 
</P>
<P>
Standing water stains: rub with 00 steel wool and rewax. Or fine-sand, then rub 
with No. 1 steel wool moistened with floor cleaner or mineral spirits. Let dry. 
Refinish, feathering into surrounding area. Rewax.

CREATE A BASIC WORKSHOP FOR HOME; 
</P>
<P>
DO-IT-YOURSELF: WORKBENCH IS THE HEART OF A FUNCTIONAL WORKSHOP. IF SPACE IS A 
PROBLEM, A FOLD-DOWN UNIT MAY BE A GOOD CHOICE TO BUILD.

<P>
If you dream of an efficient, functional place to work on projects and store 
tools, here are some hints to help you get started on your ideal home workshop. 
</P>
<P>
A workbench is the heart of a workshop. A sturdy 2-by-4 frame topped by a 
double layer of three-quarter-inch plywood will serve as an excellent, 
easy-to-make workbench. 
</P>
<P>
If a full-sized bench takes up more space than you have, you can build a 
fold-down unit. Use a solid-core door for the bench top; fasten it to a wall, 
using a piano hinge. Support the front edge with 2-by-4 legs attached with 
hinges and folding leg brackets that lock open. 
</P>
<P>
For most people, the correct height for a workbench is 34 to 36 inches. If you 
need a different height, choose one midway between your hips and your wrist 
when your arm is hanging straight down. 
</P>
<P>
Because concrete is hard on the feet and damages tools that are dropped 
accidentally, cushion the workshop floor with plywood or an old carpet. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some tips for expanding storage space: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A back-of-the-door tool rack is great for storing small tools and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 -- You can store tools on wall hooks or on a peg board. Paint the outline of 
each tool on the surface to remind you and others where to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To make a handy rack for screwdrivers and other small tools, drill a series 
of one-half to 2-inch holes through a 1-by-3. Mount the rack on the wall with 
L-brackets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Need a storage receptacle for sharp or pointed tools? Cut a block of 
plastic foam from the packing material in an appliance carton. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Use the unfinished stud spaces of your workshop walls. To make shelves, 
nail old boards horizontally between the studs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A good way to organize washers and nuts is to hang them according to size 
on large safety pins or on wire coat hangers whose necks have been untwisted. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jars with screw tops are ideal for storing small items such as nails, 
screws, nuts and bolts. You can double your shelf capacity by screwing some of 
the jar lids to the undersides of the shelves. Place a lock washer under the 
head of the screw so that the lid won't turn when you unscrew the jar. Or 
attach the lid with two screws. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you need a rack to store abrasive sanding disks, cut off one-third to 
one-half of an aluminum pie plate and fasten it to the wall, bottom side out. 
</P>
<P>
Set your workshop up with safety precautions in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When working with any power tool -- large or small -- use only a 
heavy-duty, grounded (three-prong) extension cord that is 14-gauge or larger. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To keep power-tool cords out of the way as you work, hook the slack on a 
long spring screwed into the ceiling above your workbench. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Store discarded toxic chemicals such as solvents in a separate, sealed 
trash container. Ask your local carting company, recycling center or sanitation 
department about how to dispose of them properly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Because linseed oil is prone to spontaneous combustion even in cold 
weather, quickly discard any rag used with linseed oil or with a product 
containing linseed oil. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If you have small children, store all tools in locked cabinets or drawers. 
As the children grow up, gradually introduce them to the safe use of hand 
tools, but continue to lock up power tools.

   Donna White has a $500 fingernail on her
pinkie. It's 14 karat gold, 2 inches long and adorned with nine
dangling charms.
   In a society so sated that its garbage provides meals for the
homeless, ``nail art'' has become a multimillion-dollar business.
Booths and salons are springing up as fast as the human nail can
grow.
   ``When I was growing up in New Orleans, the only women who
painted their nails red worked in brothels,'' says manicurist Karen
Garlow. Now, women seeking a genteel look can have cameos painted on
their nails; the more showy can have diamonds or pearls drilled in.
For just plain funky, there's no limit.
   One woman wanted bowling balls painted on her nails for the night
of her local tournament. And after the Washington Redskins won the
Super Bowl in 1987, dozens of fans had the phone number of
quarterback Doug Williams painted onto all 10 nails _ toes too, in
some cases.
   When Dorothy's fiance asked her what stone she wanted for her
engagement, she requested a three-carat diamond _ drilled into her
nail. ``It'll still be on my finger,'' she says, asking that her
last name be withheld.
   ``Now that women have become accepted in the work force and
realize they don't have to look like men, they use nail polish and
art as accessories for their wardrobe. It makes them look
well-groomed, dressed up,'' says Garlow.
   And not just women. Garlow recently painted art work on the nails
of 20 3-year-olds as entertainment at a birthday party. ``You know,
instead of playing pin the donkey.''
   Ms. White, also a manicurist, is adept at using an air brush and
other art tools to create fancy nails despite her own 2-inch talons.
   The ``canvas'' for most of the art is an acryllic substance
shaped into the form of nails to make the human nail longer and
harder. A set of artificial nails costs anywhere from $40 to $75,
and ``upkeep'' runs about $25 every two or three weeks. That's for
just regular polishing and filing.
   Nail art runs the gamut of prices _ as little as $2 a nail for
simple sparkles or foil paper, and as high as $2,000 for precious
stones.
   Snails, a Florida-based nail art supply business, estimates its
gross sales this year at about $1 million, says owner Marlene
Sortino.
   She recently moved her offices to the East Coast from Los
Angeles, where nail art first gained fashion in the United States,
expecting a business slump. Instead, her sales have tripled, she
says.
   Ms. Sortino also exports her products to Australia, Saudi Arabia
and other far-flung spots.
   As in the case of many trends, California is frequently cited as
the birthplace of nail art, but the ornate decoration actually is
centuries-old. In China, long nails were a mark of distinction
setting the nobles apart from the working class.
   Robin Weir, a top society hairdresser in Washington, has a
collection of custom-designed protectors used by Chinese women to
guard their jewel-encrusted nails, which were sometimes grown to as
much as one foot.
   Weir, who used to do first lady Nancy Reagan's hair and nails,
has judged a number of nail art competitions around the United
States.
   Mrs. Reagan had nails so thin when she first came to the White
House, ``you could read a newspaper through them,'' Weir says. But
she refused artificial nails, opting for a nature-based
nail-hardening treatment and subdued polish.
   The art competitions, held on local and national levels, are a
chance to win thousands of dollars in prizes provided by cosmetics
manufacturers to promote their products, says Jacquelyn G. Randolph,
chairwoman of the Washington Cosmetology Association Nail Fashion
Committee.
   She estimates nail industry sales around the country, including
nail art, at $1.5 billion or more.
   Ms. Randolph, who holds a degree in business administration and
accounting from Georgetown University, opened her nail salon four
years ago. She constantly experiments with new designs, her latest
discovery being hologram paper pasted onto nails in iridescent
geometric patterns.
   Now, she's turning her attention to male nails.
   She already has noticed that many high school boys in Washington
paint art on their pinkies. Whether that will catch on with older
men remains to be seen.
   But, she says, ``you don't have to sacrifice your manhood to get
artificial nails. A manicure doesn't mean you're a sissy.''

   Decorating fashions run in cycles, and every cycle is slightly
different, incorporating the style and the materials of its time.
   In room decor, moldings are coming ``in'' again, but their use is
subtle, in keeping with the color-consciousness of our time. And,
they come in a variety of materials, although wood is still the
consumers' No. 1 preference.
   In our grandparents' day, moldings were big, ornate, and usually
dark (like the paints and wallpapers of the day). The pendulum
swung, and for many years minimal room accents were the style. Door
and window frame trims became simpler, while chair rails and crown
moldings (the trim that separates _ and integrates _ ceiling and
walls) went out of fashion altogether.
   As today's do-it-yourself decorators turn once again to
decorative moldings to top off their rooms, they're choosing lighter
moldings in less intricate patterns. The most popular trims are
traditional in style, but modern in size, simplici1y and hue.
   Contemporary moldings are less bulky and much less intricately
profiled than those of grandma's time. But the selection of designs
is as varied _ if not more so.
   ``We make more than 40 patterns of oak moldings alone,'' says
Mike Fara of House of Fara, which manufactures solid hardwood
moldings and trims. ``Almost all are between 2 and 3 inches high and
less than 1 inch in thickness. We do make larger moldings _ up to 4
and three-fourths inches with more intricate profiles, but they're
used in exceptional houses _ usually older, restored homes.''
   Natural-finished light-toned hardwoods are the biggest sellers,
outstripping by far the darker natural wppds amd somber stains. They
are often installed with a simple sealant and a clear finish, for a
light, bright look.
   Painted moldings also tend to be light in color. One stylish
technique to subtly highlight trim is to paint moldings a shade
lighter than walls: white molding on cream walls, cream with beige,
etc.
   Virtually every home or apartment has molding trim around doors
and windows, and as ``kickboards'' where walls meet floor. Changes
in style have rarely been so extreme as to eliminate these practical
conveniences.
   Crown moldings top off walls and tie them to a room's ceiling
with a flourish. The accent added to a wallpapered room in this way
helps create a warmer, cozier feeling by ``bringing down'' the
ceiling _ joining it visually more closely to the walls.
   A chair rail molding divides a room, circling it at a height of
about 32 inches, usually at the top of a wainscot panel or between
wallpapered and painted portions of a room. Chair rails are usually
thicker than other moldings, but match the crown.
   Using moldings as decorations _ as finishing touches to a room _
creates an opportunity to accent the main decor with an additional
touch of color and a distinctive visual flair.
   For a gracious traditional look, a do-it-yourselfer can create
panels of wallpaper within painted walls by setting off areas with
molding. Corners can be cut with a simple miter box and saw.
   Special effects, such as rounded or cut-out corners, can be
achieved with pre-shaped products sold in most home centers.
   There are two sources for buying moldings: lumber yards and home
centers. Lumber yards carry large pieces of unfinished, unsanded
molding (often up to 20-foot lengths) that the do-it-yourselfer can
cut to size, sand and finish. Warning: getting the longer lengths
home and up and down stairs may be the most difficult and
frustrating part of your project.
   The second source _ home centers _ stock some unfinished molding
material, but also pre-cut, pre-sanded and sealed moldings. These
are hardwood moldings cut to 6-, 7-, or 8-foot lengths, sanded and
shrink-wrapped for protection, ready for installation and finishing.
   Even for a novice do-it-yourselfer, installing molding is more a
matter of care than of craftsmanship. Measure carefully, cut
exactly. Check the setting on your adjustable miter box before each
cut. Work slowly. And, don't forget to use a level.
   Paint and wallpaper first, if your crown or chair rail molding is
new. If it isn't, paint or finish the molding first, then paint or
paper the wall up to it.
   Hardwoods can be amazingly tough to nail. If you're working with
oak trim, for instance, you'll be wise to drill nail holes in it
before installing it, to save yourself a lot of bent nails and-or
split wood.

<LEADPARA>  CONVENTIONAL clothes closets, with one high shelf and a single rod for
hangers, waste space and become cluttered too easily. Both problems can be
solved by dividing the closet into compartments with freestanding storage
units or a combination of built-in units and rods.;    First reorganize the
closet's contents. Sort all items into two groups: those that are used in the
same room as the closet, and those that are not. Move the items used elsewhere
closer to their area of use if possible.  </LEADPARA>

CREATIVE IDEAS FOR CRAMPED CLOSETS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Interiors  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     If no one has used the remaining items in the last year, can they be
discarded? If you don't want to get rid of them, perhaps you can store them
elsewhere.;    When the only items left are those that must remain, rehang the
clothes with the longest at one end of the rod and the shortest at the other.;
   Items that are seldom used or are out of season can be grouped in hanging
storage bags. Then stand several feet away and look over the area above and
beneath the clothes. This is the closet's extra storage space.;   
Freestanding storage;  The simplest way to use this space is to fill it with
freestanding storage units like shelves, baskets, racks and trays. Modular
units can be bought at home centers, department stores and stores specializing
in closet accessories.;    But if you are handy, you can usually save money by
making storage units. Following are directions for simple shelving units
resembling small bookcases.;    Out of three-quarter-inch-thick plywood, saw
two rectangles for the sides of the unit and another for the top. The length
of the sides should equal the intended height of the unit minus three-quarters
of an inch, and the width should equal the unit's intended depth.;    Shelving
that is installed below shoulder height can be as deep as the closet itself
(usually 22 to 24 inches), but overhead shelves should not be more than 20
inches deep; otherwise, reaching into them may be difficult.;    Make the top
the same width as the sides. The length should be the desired width of the
unit (but no more than 34 inches, to keep the shelves from sagging).;   
Decide how many shelves you want, and how far apart they should be. Convenient
distances between shelves are 6, 9 and 12 inches. Saw the shelves from
three-quarter-inch plywood, and make them an inch and a half shorter than the
length of the top.;    Support strips;    For each shelf saw a pair of
one-inch-wide support strips, or cleats. These should be as long as the sides
are wide. If you think you might want to hang the unit from a wall rather than
make it freestanding, cut another cleat (called a hanging bar) two inches wide
and the length of a shelf.;    Last, cut a rectangle of quarter-inch-thick
hardboard (one brand is Masonite) for the back of the unit. Its dimensions
should equal the unit's full intended height and width.;    To assemble the
unit, first position the wide surfaces of the cleats against the sides,
three-fourths of an inch below the intended heights of the shelves, and attach
them with dry-wall or multipurpose screws one and a quarter inches long. These
are most easily driven with an electric drill with a screwdriver bit.;   
Next, fasten the top across the upper ends of the sides, using
two-and-a-quarter-inch screws. Position the hanging bar against the underside
of the top, flush with the rear edges of the top and sides.;    Fasten the bar
by driving two-and-a-quarter-inch screws into its ends through the unit's
sides.;    Final steps;    Finally, position the back with its edges flush
with those of the sides and top and attach it with three-quarter-inch wire
nails. Paint the unit if desired, and then insert the shelves. Stand it in the
closet, or if you wish, attach it to the wall with the hanging bar as
described farther on.;    For maximum storage space and convenience, consider
partitioning the closet vertically and replacing the single rod and upper
shelf with several short rods and storage units.;    Multiple rods can be used
to hang short items of clothing in double rows, and placing storage units
nearer the top of the closet, rather than at the bottom, eliminates stooping.;
   To plan a layout, make a scale drawing on graph paper. Draw a rectangle
representing the closet's sides, top and floor. Next, group the clothing by
length and hang it from the rod. Measure the width of each group.;    Then
measure the distance from the bottom of the longest item in each group to the
floor; to that distance, add the distance from the top of the closet down to
any shelving above the clothes rod.;    Measuring to scale on the drawing,
come down this total distance from the line representing the top of the
closet. Draw horizontal lines across the rectangle, as long as the width of
each group of clothes; these lines will be stepped, indicating the bottom of
the clothing.;    Another look;  Turn the sketch upside down. Now the space
beneath the clothing appears at the top, and the stepped lines represent the
heights at which short rods should be hung.;    Remove the rod and upper shelf
and install purchased or homemade storage nits whose sides divide the closet
vertically at the intervals suggested by the widths of the clothing groups. To
fasten units to a wall, install two two-and-a-half-inch screws through each
hanging bar into studs inside the wall.;    If the positions of the studs do
not allow this, or if purchased units have metal corner brackets instead of a
hanging bar, as in the illustration at above right, make cleats long enough to
span the studs and attach these horizontally to the wall first (nailing or
screwing them to studs).;    Then attach the units to the cleats. Two cleats
are needed for each unit: an upper one for fastening and a lower one to hold
the bottom of the unit out from the wall, so it hangs vertically.;    Attach
short rods between the partitions at heights that allow the longest item in
each clothing group to hang clear of the floor.  </TEXT>

ARBOR IN GARDEN WITHOUT STICKER SHOCK; 
</P>
<P>
PROJECT: BASING THE DESIGN ON A $2,000 MODEL, ONE CAN BE BUILT FOR JUST THE 
COST OF MATERIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. J. HAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I built a climbing rose arbor (shown in this week's sketch) out of desperation. 
My wife had just purchased a pair of Blaze climbing roses, and she needed 
something for them to climb on. She looked in lumberyards, garden centers and 
mail order gardening catalogues. Anything under $200 looked like a product of a 
sixth-grade shop class. 
</P>
<P>
Finally she discovered an arbor she liked, but the asking price -- $2,000 
installed -- gave new meaning to the term sticker shock. The only solution was 
to build one myself. It's based on the $2,000 design, but it cost about 1/20th 
of that to build. 
</P>
<P>
To build it, all you do is make a pair of stretcher-shaped frames. Into each 
frame you insert a piece of ready-made lattice. 
</P>
<P>
Join the two frames with a pair of arches sawed from ordinary pine, and "plant" 
the whole thing in four holes in your garden. 
</P>
<P>
To make the frames, you'll need five 8-foot, pressure-treated 2-by-4s. I bought 
one 4-by-8 foot piece of lattice and cut it to size, but some lumber yards sell 
it in 2-foot widths. If you can find the 2-foot wide lattice, it will simplify 
your cutting. 
</P>
<P>
For the arches you'll need about 40 feet of 1-by-8 pine, plus 12 feet of round 
closet pole. Everything goes together with waterproof glue and nails. For the 
glue, use construction adhesive, sold in caulking gun cartridges. For screws, 
use plated Phillips flat heads. You'll need about 30 of these 1 1/4 inches 
long, and another 30 at 3 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
The frames. Use four of your 2-by-4s for the posts, and cut the fifth one into 
2-foot lengths for the crosspieces. At the top of each post, cut a notch or 
"rabbet" three-quarter inch deep and 6 inches long. These rabbets will match up 
with four stubs on the arch forming a lap joint (see sketch). 
</P>
<P>
Fasten the main frame parts together as shown with adhesive and a pair of 
3-inch screws at each joint. Then cut your lattice into two pieces measuring 25 
by 60 inches. Use a circular saw with a cheap blade for this. You will probably 
hit a few staples as you cut, and there's no point in ruining a good blade. Be 
sure to wear eye protection. 
</P>
<P>
Set the lattice into the frames and secure it with three-quarter-inch strips of 
wood ripped off the edges of your pine boards. You could also use 
three-quarter-inch quarter-round molding for this job. 
</P>
<P>
The arches. These are made by cutting arced segments out of your pine and 
laminating them together in two layers. The best way to do this is to cut a 
semicircular pattern out of heavy cardboard or scrap plywood. I made a simple 
compass for this purpose out of a thin strip of wood about 26 inches long. To 
do this, drill a small hole about an inch from one end of the stick. Measure up 
20 inches from this hole and drill another hole. Then drill a third hole 23 1/2 
inches from the first. 
</P>
<P>
You now have a simple beam compass that will draw the inside and outside curves 
of your arch. Place the compass on your cardboard or plywood and tap a nail 
through the solitary hole. This will be the center pivot. Now slip a pencil 
into the 20-inch hole and draw the inside curve of your arch. Slip the pencil 
into the 23 1/2-inch hole and repeat to draw the outside curve. Cut it out and 
your pattern is complete. 
</P>
<P>
Use this pattern to lay out arched segments from your pine stock. Cut these out 
and laminate them together using adhesive and your 1 1/4-inch screws. Stagger 
the joints between segments so they don't overlay. And extend the ends of the 
inside layer of each arch 6 inches to create the stubs that will mate up with 
the 6-inch rabbets in the tops of the arbor frames. 
</P>
<P>
Next, join the two arches together with five equally spaced lengths of closet 
pole. You can either simply cut these 24 inches long and fasten with screws, 
or, drill three-quarter-inch deep sockets for them in the inner faces of the 
arches. Then glue and screw them in place. If you take this route, don't forget 
to cut the poles 25 1/2 inches long. 
</P>
<P>
Final assembly. This is easiest with the arbor on its side. Place the two 
frames on edge, 40 inches apart. To hold the frames in position, tack a couple 
of strips of wood from one frame to the other. Apply adhesive to all four 
rabbets, then set the arch in position and secure with one screw at each joint. 
</P>
<P>
Check to make sure everything is square and parallel. Then drive three more 
screws into each joint to lock things up solid. Let the glue set for a few 
hours before putting any strain on the joints. The arbor will be a bit floppy 
until set in the ground, so handle it carefully from here on. It's not a bad 
idea to tack on a pair of temporary diagonal braces about 6 feet long to 
reinforce the arbor until it is safely in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
I tried an unusual trick for setting my arbor in the ground and it worked 
perfectly. Carry the arbor into position in the garden, and set it in place on 
the ground. Carefully mark the position of each leg, then pick the arbor up and 
set it aside. Next, punch four post holes 16 inches into the ground using a 
heavy sledge hammer and a 3-foot length of 4-by-4. Just pound the 4-by-4 into 
the ground, wiggle it around to loosen it and enlarge the hole, then pull it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, set the arbor legs into these holes and pour them full of pea gravel. 
Once the legs are safely set in the ground, the arbor becomes quite rigid and 
you can remove the temporary braces. I finished my arbor with a white exterior 
stain. This looks a lot like paint, but won't chip or peel, so it's easier to 
maintain.

<LEADPARA>  Q I am building several outdoor projects with pressure-treated wood. I've been
told that the wood should be stained.;    I thought pressure-treated wood
would last in its natural state for years -- just the way it comes from the
lumber dealer.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  STAIN GIVES WOOD LONGER LIFE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Do It Yourself  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     A Outdoor or pressure-treated lumber is treated with chemicals to resist
decay and insect attack. This procedure permits consumers and the forest
industry to use inferior grades of lumber, rather than increasing the demand
for redwood, cedar or cypress.;    But, unlike species of timber that are
naturally decay- and insect-resistant, these lesser species have more
pronounced grain, and are more prone to splinter and crack than redwood or
cedar. So, even though the wood is treated, it is best to apply a stain -- or
at least a water repellent -- as soon as your project is dry enough to take
stain.;    The first tip for working with pressure-treated lumber is to let it
dry before using it. Other woods such as redwood and cedar are dry when you
buy them. But lumber that has been treated has been injected with massive
amounts of chemicals and water. For wood that will be in ground contact, these
liquids penetrate the wood completely.;    If possible, hand pick your own
wood at the lumber dealer. Select lumber that looks straight and true, and is
lighter and drier to the touch. These pieces have less water content and will
be ready to use sooner.;    For very heavy lumber, understand that the extra
weight you feel is fluid weight and will evaporate out in time. Stack wet
lumber on a flat surface such as a driveway or patio, use spacers between
boards to let air circulate, and check the wood for weight and by touch for
moisture.;    We have let pressure-treated lumber sit for four or more weeks
in 90-degree weather until it was dry enough to use without shrinking.;   
When the wood is dry, it may be too hard to nail. Pre-drill holes for nails to
avoid splitting the lumber. Use construction adhesives and metal connectors to
reduce the number of nails or screws needed. Use only galvanized nails or
coated screws for assembly.;    Apply stain or water repellent to the "down"
side of the lumber before you nail it in place. Joists, braces, and the
underside of deck boards will be hard to reach and finish when you have nailed
them in place.;    Q Maybe I'm all thumbs, but I have trouble getting wire
nuts to hold -- even when I hold the wires in place with electrician's tape.
Is it really me?;    A Your trouble in getting wire nuts to hold is that you
first twisted the wires together before installing the nut. Electrical tape in
this case, just makes for a messy connection. To join two wires together,
strip the insulation back about 3/4-inch from the wire ends. Then hold the two
wires alongside and parallel to each other.;    Slip the wire nut over the
ends of the wires and tighten the nut. When the wire nut is tight, tug on each
wire to test the connection. Do not add electrician's tape, the wire nut will
stay firmly in place on its own.;    Q Dark brown spots are appearing in areas
of my concrete deck. They don't wash away with soap and water. What causes
these spots?;    A The type of discoloration you describe occurs when
tricalcium alumino-ferride -- the agent that gives portland cement its gray
color -- has not reacted thoroughly with the other chemicals in concrete.;   
To remove the dark spots, try pouring undiluted household vinegar. If that
doesn't work, try a solution of 1 part muriatic acid to 30 parts water.  </TEXT>

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: STRESS-SKIN PANELING MAKES AIRTIGHT HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: I am planning to build a new super-efficient house. How 
energy-efficient is stress-skin panel construction? Is it reasonably-priced, 
and can I do some of the construction work myself? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Stress-skin panel construction is probably the most energy-efficient 
and cost-effective building method available today. 
</P>
<P>
With super-high insulation levels and airtightness, a stress-skin panel house 
should have extremely low heating and cooling costs. A reduction of 50% on 
utility bills as compared to a typically constructed house is reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
Stress-skin panels, made to your building plan, are delivered to your building 
site. You can also select from many standard house design packages to reduce 
the costs. 
</P>
<P>
This construction method is simple and you should be able to do much of the 
work yourself. Most panel manufacturers will rent you any necessary tools. Once 
the foundation or basement is poured, It should only take a few days to close 
in a house (walls and roof). 
</P>
<P>
You can purchase the panels with the openings for windows and doors already cut 
and framed. You just slip them in. If you want to add a window at a later time, 
you just saw a rectangular hole through the wall. Then rout out a little foam, 
frame the opening and set in the window. 
</P>
<P>
A typical structural (no supporting frame needed) stress-skin panel is made of 
thick, rigid foam insulation (insulating R-values up to R-40). A 7/16-inch 
thick sheet of exterior-grade plywood or wafer board is bonded to each side of 
the insulation forming the panel. 
</P>
<P>
You can attach siding, stucco, brick, etc. to the outdoor surface and drywall 
or paneling to the indoor surface. 
</P>
<P>
The foam insulation is routed out to accept standard lumber at the top and 
bottom. Once your foundation is complete and the sill lumber is in place, tilt 
up the free-standing panels and the routed-out bottom fits and seals over the 
sill. 
</P>
<P>
Nail the panels to the sill. Each panel is joined vertically and sealed along 
the joints with 2-by-4 or insulated splines. 
</P>
<P>
Work your way around the foundation until all of the walls are up and properly 
positioned. The corners are nailed together through studs that are in the 
routed-out ends of the corner panels. This forms an extremely strong and rigid 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Electrical wiring chases are provided in the insulation behind the indoor wafer 
skin. It makes wiring easy with no air leaks or insulation voids as with 
studded-wall construction. 
</P>
<P>
Since a stress-skin panel house is so efficient and airtight, you should 
install an air-to-air heat exchanger ventilation system. This gives you 
complete control over the ventilation in your house. Outdoor noise, dust, 
pollens, etc. are almost totally eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
You can write to me for Utility Bills Update No. 374 showing a list of 
stress-skin panel manufacturers, typical panel specifications, and a floor plan 
layout and exterior diagram of a typical stress-skin panel house. Please 
include $1 and a self-addressed, stamped business-size envelope. Send your 
requests to James Dulley, c/o Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Dr.,

Accurate Thermostat Should Be Level 
</P>
<P>
Q: When I had my house interior painted, the painter loosened the thermostat 
and retightened it slightly crooked. Will that effect the operation of my 
central air conditioner and furnace? 
</P>
<P>
A: It can definitely affect the temperature calibration. Most standard wall 
thermostats have a liquid mercury switch in them. As the bimetallic strip 
inside reacts to temperature changes, the mercury flows back and forth to 
control heating and cooling. It must be level to be accurate. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Clothes Dryer Takes Longer to Do Job 
</P>
<P>
Q: Our clothes dryer seems to get hot, but it is taking longer to dry our 
clothes. I keep the lint filter clean. What could be the problem? 
</P>
<P>
A: A clothes dryer uses a lot of energy, and the extra running time can get 
expensive. If your dryer is still getting hot, then your problem probably is 
inadequate air flow. One cause may be the vent duct has become clogged with 
lint. Pull the duct loose from the back of the dryer and run a rag on a coat 
hanger through it. Another possible cause is that the flapper on the outside 
vent is sticking closed. Make sure it swings freely. 
</P>
<P>
Letters and questions to Dulley, a Cincinnati-based engineering consultant, may 
be sent to James Dulley, Los Angeles Times, 6906 Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, 
Ohio 45244.

<LEADPARA>  RINGO Starr is back in the studio again, recording a new solo album. The
record, untitled at the moment, is his first solo record since 1981's "Stop
And Smell the Roses." (A live record of his 1989 tour, "Ringo Starr and His
All-Starr Band," was released in 1990.) The new record is part of a long-term
deal that the former drummer for the Beatles has concluded with the Private
Music label.;    Producing the new record is Jeff Lynne, who was responsible
for "Cloud Nine," George Harrison's remarkable 1987 comeback record. Ringo has
had an uneven solo career, with hits such as "Photograph" and "It Don't Come
Easy," but misses as well. But with Lynne -- who has a way of re-creating the
old Beatle charm -- on line, Ringo could be in for a comeback.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     THEY OUGHTA BE IN PICTURES -- Think of the two big pop stars that you would
most like to see in the movies. They would have to be Whitney Houston and
Vanilla Ice, wouldn't they? Hold that laughter down a minute, because that's
just what they're going to do. Houston is set to make her screen debut in "The
Bodyguard," with the co-star being none other than Oscar-winner Kevin Costner.
The movie, which begins shooting in November, is a thriller about an ex-Secret
Service agent who is hired to protect a big-name pop vocalist from an
obsessive fan.;    And that hit-making ice-man Vanilla Ice, hot on the heels
of his first movie ("Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II"), will star in "Cool As
Ice," which is described as "a mix of music, romance and dance." The movie
should have its premiere later this year.;    While we're at it, Ice's new
album, "Vanilla Ice Extremely Live," is set for a June 4 release. The album is
the follow-up to his debut, "To The Extreme," which sold 11 million copies.
The new album comes with live versions of the Ice's hits and four new studio
songs, including -- hold your breath -- Vanilla's rendition of the Rolling
Stones' "Satisfaction.";    OFF WITH THE SHOWS -- If you were one of the
10,000 fans at Shoreline Amphitheater on Monday disappointed when Whitney
Houston's show was canceled, the official word from Bill Graham Presents is
laryngitis.;    Also, Poison's show at Shoreline tonight has been canceled
because of illness, a BGP spokesman said Wednesday. Tickets will be refunded
at place of purchase.;    TOUR TIME -- Two of the Bay Area's biggest groups,
Huey Lewis and the News and the Doobie Brothers, are making ready to tour.
Huey and the boys -- after warm-up shows at the NARM convention in San
Francisco and the Ritz in New York in April -- will hit the road in July. The
Doobies' tour debuts in Fresno on May 30 and comes to Shoreline Amphitheater
on June 1.;    HE OUGHT TO BE ON RADIO -- Speaking of Huey Lewis, he will be
the featured guest on the "Rockline" program 8:30 p.m. Monday on KRQR-FM
(97.3).;    ON WITH THE SHOWS -- It's called "Lollapalooza," and it is just
that -- one of the real knockout tours of the season. It stars Jane's
Addiction, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Living Colour, Nine Inch Nails, Ice-T,
Butthole Surfers and the Henry Rollins Band, and it is scheduled to haul into
Shoreline Amphitheater July 26 at 2 p.m. Tickets are $25 and $20; they go on
sale Sunday. Also Sunday, tickets go on sale for the Scorpions, who also
perform at Shoreline June 22 at 7 p.m. Price: $22.50 and $19.50. For both

<HEAD>Deputy Suspended Because Her Fingernails Are Too Long</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sheriff's deputy whose fingernails are a
quarter-inch over regulation was suspended for four days after she
refused to trim them, saying she's had them long all her 10 years
on the job and they don't interfere with her work.
   Danielle Rogers, who works at the Hennepin County juvenile
center, has nails that are three-eighths inch past her fingertips.
A grooming policy adopted by the sheriff's department May 16 says
nails may not be longer than an eighth of an inch.
   The policy covers a range of subjects, including the length and
style of hair, personal hygiene and wearing jewelry.
   Rogers filed a grievance over the policy, claiming it is an
issue that should have been decided in collective bargaining
between department officials and the deputies' union. She was
suspended Wednesday for a day for violating the rule, and again on
Thursday, this time for three days, for not trimming her nails.
   On Friday, the union filed suit against Hennepin County and
Sheriff Don Omodt, claiming that the failure to negotiate the
policy was an unfair labor practice and that Rogers was disciplined
for exercising her right to file a grievance.
   Hennepin County District Judge Ann Montgomery denied a temporary
restraining order Friday and scheduled a hearing for Monday on
whether a preliminary injunction should be issued.
   Omodt did not return a telephone call to the department
Saturday. His home telephone is unlisted.
   In an affidavit filed with the court, Rogers said she has had
her nails the same length for the 10 years she has worked as a
deputy and they do not affect her work.
   The objection is not over the grooming policy, said her
attorney, Marshall Tanick, but over the failure of the county to
bargain with the union. He also said there is a right to privacy in
personal appearance as long as it is not detrimental to the job.
   Another problem with the policy, Tanick said, is that it does
not spell out what the consequences are for violating it.
   Rogers has been threatened with disciplinary action up to
dismissal, according to court documents.
   Karla Hancock, assistant Hennepin County attorney, said Friday
there was no need to bargain about the policy because it falls
under management's rights, rather than being a term and condition
of employment that must be negotiated.
   Said Tanick: ``We believe there are serious law enforcement
issues in the county that merit attention. Too much time and energy
has been devoted to this petty issue.
   ``As long as the deputy is competent,the length of her nails
should not matter.''

BUILD A TOOL BOX THAT REFLECTS PERSONALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL J. PRESUTTI, Presutti is a Stanton Island, N.Y. free-lancer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When I first became interested in carpentry, one of the things I admired most 
about the old-timers was the style and creativity that went into their wooden 
tool boxes. These personalized accessories were built to last a lifetime and 
often did. They were all customized to fit the needs of their creators. 
</P>
<P>
If he was a framing carpenter, the box was large enough to carry large nails 
and an extra 22-ounce hammer and a caulk line. One box I recall seeing in an 
old carpenter's shop looked more like an autobiography than a tool box. 
</P>
<P>
It had slews of calculations inscribed in lead, saw kerfs ripped across it, 
glue spots on it, drill holes poked into it and coffee stained into its grain, 
all of these footprints of a carpenter's career. 
</P>
<P>
There was probably the calculation he figured twice before cutting his first 
roof, and the coffee spilled while in his truck waiting to start working on a 
cold gray February morning when the rest of the world was still fast asleep. 
</P>
<P>
I'm going to share with you some of the techniques I use to build my customized 
wooden tool boxes. I've built quite a collection over the years for friends, 
family and myself. I may even be lucky enough to have this column reach a young 
carpenter who is just starting his own autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
There are basically two types of tool boxes: open and closed. An open box is a 
box without a lid. I use these to store materials that are frequently used such 
as nails, screws or tubes of caulking. Since the box is always open you can see 
everything in it at once without opening a lid. I have one open box I use just 
for my finish nails, aluminum capping nails, large dry wall screws and spare 
tubes of silicone caulking. 
</P>
<P>
I also store extra pencils there and extra screw gun bits. I call this my "trim 
box" because I use it when I do trim work. Another open box, a very large one, 
I call my "framing box." This stays in my truck and contains seven different 
compartments, each with various size framing nails in it. 
</P>
<P>
The second type of tool box is a closed box which I use to store my tools. 
Wooden tool boxes are great for tools because they cushion the blows and absorb 
any excess moisture in the air that can ruin an electronic motor. I have a 
wooden tool box for almost all of my tools. Sometimes I make a tool box that 
houses all the tools needed to perform a particular task -- like a box that 
only has electrician tools or laminating tools. The possibilities are endless, 
and if you're like me, you'll just enjoy making them. 
</P>
<P>
I usually use plywood for large boxes and clear 1-x-6,8,10,12-inch board for 
smaller boxes. With a closed tool box, I first create a six-sided box, then 
with a table saw cut the top of the box off, seal it to protect it, add hinges 
and a handle, and then put it to work. 
</P>
<P>
That may sound fairly simple but there are a few tricky joints to mill to 
assure the box's long life. First mill the four sides of the would-be box. Make 
sure they're square and all the same height. Now run a router with a 
three-quarter-inch bit through the bottom on each side; this creates a dado 
joint (see figure). Sometimes it's easier if you run the router through a 
single long piece of wood first then cut the sides. This is up to you and the 
supply of wood available. 
</P>
<P>
Now cut the bottom of the box. Make it long enough to be accepted into the dado 
groove on each side of the box. Then put the five sides of the box together 
dry. This is to check the fit and tightness. While it's still together measure 
the top. It should be the length of the long side plus the width of the two 
short sides (see figure). Now cut the top of the box to whatever size you 
measured. 
</P>
<P>
After you have the top cut, you're going to route a rabbet joint around the 
perimeter of it. This is done so that the top will fit (partially) into the 
box. This will assure a strong joint. 
</P>
<P>
Put all six sides (four sides plus top and bottom) together dry. Check them 
again, then disassemble it, glue it and reassemble it. Clamp every corner joint 
and fasten them together with wood screws or nails. Take caution here not to 
screw (or nail) where you plan to cut later. Leave it clamped and screwed for 
at least 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
Once dried you will have a six-sided box. Now measure down about 3 inches and 
make a mark for your cut. Run the box through a table saw (or use a circular 
saw), and create the top lid. Prime and seal the whole box and install the 
hardware. 
</P>
<P>
To build an open tool box just use the same procedures used to build a closed 
tool box except omit the top lid and add a railing handle (see figure). 
</P>
<P>
Remember, when you create a custom tool box, add personal touches that 
distinguish your box from others. Like the carpenters who use them, tool boxes 
are all different, and should be. Let your tool box reflect you personally. 
Dare to be unique.

CARLSBAD MAN HOPES TO NAIL DOWN A CRAZE 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Englishman Steve Ward was toiling away in the banger business when a peculiar 
2,000-year-old opportunity suddenly came his way. 
</P>
<P>
Just as he was endeavoring to get San Diego County's appetite hooked on 
bangers, those plump British sausages, he managed to buy 30,000 ancient Roman 
nails discovered 30 years ago at a fortress in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
Ward's accountant, who helped arrange the purchase, also issued a challenge: 
"He said, 'Do you think you can get the Americans excited about these nails?' " 
</P>
<P>
Ward, a former race-car driver, figured that, if Americans went wild for Pet 
Rocks in the '70s, they might really gobble up something of antiquity. Even if 
they're nails. And even if they sell for $189 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident that anybody with a reasonable amount of intelligence will know 
this is a good thing to own," said Ward, who, as a sideline to his sausage 
distribution business, British Banger 
</P>
<P>
Corp., has now opened A.D. Discoveries in Carlsbad to market the nails. 
</P>
<P>
He figures the nails are more than a mere curio for somebody who has 
everything, saying, "How often can you pick up something that's 2,000 years 
old?" 
</P>
<P>
A buyer at the Nordstrom department store in Santa Barbara thinks Ward may be 
on to something and has ordered 50 of the nails, which are sealed in Lucite and 
resting in a velvet-lined oak box, to offer for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel our Santa Barbara customers have responded (in the past) to 
merchandise of nostalgic or keepsake value," said Nordstrom spokeswoman 
Michelle Garratt. 
</P>
<P>
Ending up on department store shelves probably isn't the worst thing that might 
have happened to the nails. They literally could have killed somebody. 
</P>
<P>
Back in AD 83, a Roman army commanded by Agricola had trudged through Britain 
up to Caledonia, now Scotland, to subdue the tribes there, according to a 
history book Ward keeps. The Roman leader ordered a fortress built in 
Perthshire, but it was later abandoned and destroyed by the departing Romans. 
</P>
<P>
Roman equipment was buried at the fortress, including 8 tons of nails the 
legion didn't want captured, pounded into arrowheads, and fired back at them by 
the highly agitated locals whose lands the Romans had the bad manners to 
invade. 
</P>
<P>
The nails remained in a pit for centuries, covered by 12 feet of clay, until 
1960. 
</P>
<P>
Then, the British Steel Corp. discovered the cache during an excavation at the 
site. The top layers were corroded, but had formed a protective cap that kept 
the rest of the nails from exposure to air. 
</P>
<P>
The steel firm kept the nails until the 1980s, and Ward produces a letter on 
British Steel Corp. stationary stating, "You have our assurance . . . (the 
nails) are all Roman nails from the legionary fortress of Inchtuthil, 
Perthshire dated from AD 83 to AD 87." 
</P>
<P>
Ward, 36, born in Yorkshire, said the nails have been extensively studied and 
authenticated since their discovery, and he provides buyers with a booklet 
citing the scholarship done on the nails. They are two lengths: 3 to 4 inches, 
and about 2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, just as the nails are going on the market, Ward has no idea 
whether his investment gamble will be a financial debacle or a brilliant 
stroke. But he simply couldn't pass up the opportunity that "just came about by 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
Last May, his accountant, Tony Redpath, told Ward that he had a client in 
northern England who had come into possession of the nails and was willing to 
sell. Ward bought them, got an import license, and brought them to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
When a U.S. Customs agent inquired what he had, Ward said, "You promise not to 
laugh? They're rusty nails." 
</P>
<P>
Now they're for sale, and Ward hopes the items will take off. Ward's friend, 
Nick Reed, a 27-year-old Briton, is ready to market the nails in their native 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"If someone buys one, they're not going to see one at a swap meet for $20," 
assured Reed.

CHILDREN'S DESK IS EASY TO BUILD OR TAKE DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY EISINGER, Eisinger, author of How to Build and Contract Your Own Home, 
is a do-it-yourself authority and syndicated columnist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here is an easy-to-build desk that has three all-important features: 
</P>
<P>
1 -- It is cut from a half sheet of three-quarter-inch plywood, sold in most 
home centers or lumber yards that find a definite market in supplying smaller 
sizes than the usual 4-by-8-footer. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- The desk top can be adjusted from 25 inches in height up to 29 inches, in 
2-inch increments, as the child grows. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- The desk is held together by only four carriage bolts, so it can be 
quickly taken apart for convenient along-the-wall storage. 
</P>
<P>
Cut the desk from a half sheet of APA plywood; we suggest you use the A-C 
grade, which has one side sanded and free from imperfections. Where the 
imperfections are visible on the C side, merely fill the seams or knot holes 
with spackle or paste wood filler. 
</P>
<P>
Note that the desk consists of only six components. Mark off and label the 
parts on your half sheet of plywood, as indicated in the accompanying 
illustration. 
</P>
<P>
A table or radial arm saw will ensure the straight cuts you need. But if you 
don't have this equipment, for a few extra dollars most lumber yards will make 
the straight cuts. 
</P>
<P>
If you have a portable electrical saw, by tacking a fence to the half sheet to 
serve as a guide you can make your own straight cuts. Use a plywood blade to 
cut down on splintering. 
</P>
<P>
With your half sheet marked off as per the layout, make the first 8-inch cut, 
labeled Cut 1, to produce the cross brace (Part D). Then rip the sheet in half 
by making Cut 2, which yields the table top (Part A) and both legs (Part C), 
plus the side braces (Part B). Rip the 3-inch-wide side braces, and all that 
remains is cutting the two legs to make them L-shaped. 
</P>
<P>
To cut the notches in the cross braces and 8-inch legs, a saber saw is the tool 
of choice; it also can be used to cut the straight interior lines of the legs. 
Incidentally, by having a 1-inch radius for the inside line of the legs, you 
can cut apart the legs without making a plunge cut. However, to make the slot 
for the inside of the legs a plunge cut is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Drill the holes for the legs and side braces, as indicated, and nail and glue 
the side braces to the top with six-penny finishing nails. Then sand off each 
part, and to conceal the plywood end grain use a paste wood filler. Sand again 
and brush on a coat of primer paint. Finish with a washable coat of latex. 
</P>
<P>
Now all you need do is to bolt the legs to the table top and slip the cross 
brace in position, as indicated.

I get my water from a well, and it must be fairly acidic. Over the years it has 
corroded and eaten away at the metal pipes and fittings in my plumbing system 
with an insatiable appetite. Whenever an old section goes bad, I replace it 
with plastic. And wherever the plastic goes in, corrosion has ceased. Plastic 
is immune to this problem. 
</P>
<P>
It is not, however, immune to other common causes of leaks, such as errant 
nails driven during remodeling or cracks due to freezing. Even so, when these 
leaks do occur in plastic, they're relatively simple to fix. 
</P>
<P>
NAIL HOLES: If you accidentally drive a nail through a wall and into a run of 
plastic pipe, the easiest way to patch the damage is with a coupling. This is a 
tubular connector that fits over the ends of two pipes to fasten them together. 
</P>
<P>
Saw the pipe in half, right through the hole. If there is enough give in the 
run of the pipe, you can then cement it back together, using an ordinary 
coupling in the usual way. 
</P>
<P>
Apply solvent cement to the ends of the pipe on both sides of the cut. Slip the 
coupling onto one piece of pipe until it bottoms out on the stop molded at the 
midpoint of the coupling. Then quickly pull the other piece of pipe back so you 
can slip it into the other end of the coupling. Press it into the coupling 
until it too bottoms out, give the coupling a quarter turn to distribute the 
cement and let set. 
</P>
<P>
This technique will usually work when you are dealing with the relatively small 
pipes used in your plumbing's supply system. When you get a hole in the heavier 
pipes of your drainage system, however, it's often difficult to maneuver the 
two pieces of pipe far enough apart to get the second end into the coupling. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, try a slip coupling. This is just like an ordinary coupling but 
it has no stop or shoulder molded inside. To use a slip coupling, slip it onto 
one of the ends of the cut pipe, and slide it back several inches away from the 
cut so you can apply a liberal coat of cement to the pipe on both sides of the 
cut (see sketch). Then slide the coupling back up so it is centered evenly over 
the cut. Give it a twist and let set. 
</P>
<P>
Not all pipe makers offer slip couplings. If you can't find one, get an 
ordinary coupling and grind away the stop inside, as shown. 
</P>
<P>
CRACKS: They are usually too long to repair with a single coupling. One 
solution is to cut away the damaged section, then replace it with a short 
length of pipe fitted with couplings at both ends. A second solution is to make 
a patch with a piece of plastic pipe one size larger than the pipe that's 
cracked. 
</P>
<P>
If, for example, a 1/2-inch line cracks, you can repair it with a length of 
3/4-inch pipe. Just cut a piece of the larger pipe long enough to lap past the 
damage a few inches in both directions. Then take a saw and split this piece of 
pipe in half lengthwise. 
</P>
<P>
Next, apply a heavy coat of cement to both the outside of the damaged pipe and 
to the insides of the repair pieces. Place the two halves of the repair pipe 
over the damage, orienting the seams in the patch so they do not line up with 
the crack in the pipe. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, squeeze the patch tightly in place with two or three hose clamps, or 
by twisting a few lengths of heavy wire around the repair with pliers.

nails that attach the ceiling dry wall to the joist. Once several nails are
located you can get a pretty good idea of the position of the joist. If none
is in the area where you want to hang the plant and you have access to the
attic space, you will need to nail a section of 2-by-4 between joists so that
you have something firm to attach a hanger to.;    If you don't have attic
access, it can be quite a job adding the proper foundation for the hanger. To

HOME IMPROVEMENT: PAVING: ALMOST AS EASY AS ROLLING OUT A LOG; 
</P>
<P>
WALKWAYS: IF YOU WANT A RUSTIC-LOOKING PATIO OR PATH, USING WOODEN 
STEPPINGSTONES IS AN INEXPENSIVE ANSWER. BUT THEY DON'T LAST AS LONG AS STONE 
OR CONCRETE.

<P>
Looking for an easy way to pave a rustic walk or patio? Consider log rounds, 
simple slabs you cut yourself from logs or unused firewood you might have lying 
around. Log paving won't last as long as stone or concrete, but it's cheap, and 
it's easy to remove if you ever change your mind. 
</P>
<P>
In its simplest form, log paving needs no border. You can, for example, make an 
informal steppingstone path by placing your rounds individually, each on its 
own bed of sand and gravel. 
</P>
<P>
In most cases, however, you'll be paving a patio or walkway, and some kind of 
edging will be in order. Two-by-fours set on edge serve the purpose quite 
nicely. The sketch shows one simple way to go. 
</P>
<P>
Start by laying out the borders of your paving. Dig narrow trenches to a depth 
of about 3 inches to accept the 2-by-4 edging. This will place the edging at a 
level one-half inch above the ground. Set your edging boards in place (use 
pressure-treated lumber or redwood for this) and then secure them with stakes, 
also of pressure-treated lumber. You can nail the stakes to the edging, but I 
prefer to use screws. Driving nails tends to bang things out of position. 
</P>
<P>
Make sure the tops of your stakes are about 2 inches below ground level. If 
they stick up any higher than this, they may interfere with the placement of 
your logs later on. 
</P>
<P>
Once the edging is in, dig a depth of about 4 inches over the entire area to be 
paved. Then cover the area with a 2-inch layer of sand and tamp it down firmly. 
At this depth, a cubic yard of sand will cover 18 square yards, or 162 square 
feet. Figure your needs accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
Over the sand, rake a half-inch layer of pea gravel and tamp this down. Figure 
on buying about one-third as much gravel as you do sand. Your bed is now ready 
for the paving rounds. 
</P>
<P>
You can cut the logs with a chain saw. Diameter isn't critical, but larger logs 
(10 inches and up) get the job done faster. You can use any species of wood you 
like, or mix and match. 
</P>
<P>
Untreated, your log pavers will probably last two or three years, depending 
upon the type of wood and climate. Brushing on a coat of preservative will add 
a couple years of use to the logs, but it is best to soak them in preservative. 
Even with treatment, the log rounds won't last as long as stone. On the other 
hand, they are easy to replace as needed. 
</P>
<P>
Cut all your rounds 1 1/2 inches thick. Make sure your saw is sharp, and try to 
make each cut in a single smooth motion. This will produce the neatest looking 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
Lay your logs in any pattern you like. If all are roughly the same size, you 
can stagger each row and get a fairly snug and regular layout. If you have a 
variety of sizes, a random layout may be better. You can split rounds in half 
to produce straight edges to run along your border if you like, but this isn't 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
After the rounds are in place, use a straight board to check that they are set 
at the same level. Adjust the low ones by adding a bit more gravel, dig out a 
bit for the high ones. Then tamp everything down. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, finish the job by dumping pea gravel onto the paving and working it 
into the gaps between rounds with a stiff broom. This will lock the rounds in 
place and give your paving a finished appearance. 
</P>

<P>
Drawing, EASY RUSTIC PAVING 1. Dig narrow trenches 3 inches deep to hold the 
2-4 edging. The top edge of the pressure treated 2-4 should be 1/2 inch above 
the ground. 2. Next to the edging, drive pressure treated stakes into the 
ground so the tops are 2 inches below ground level. Use wood screws to secure 
the stakes to the edging. 3. When the edging is finished, dig to a level of 
4-inches over the area between the edging. Fill this area with a 2-inch layer 
of sand and fimrly tamp it down. Then add a 1/2/ inch layer of pea gravel over 
this and tamp it down. 4. Cut your logs 1-1/2 inches thick and lay them on the 
gravel in any pattern desired. Tamp them down firmly and add pea gravel bewteen 
the logs to lock them in place. Los Angeles Times

REPAIRING A 'GUILLOTINE WINDOW'; 
</P>
<P>
REPAIRS: WHEN A DOUBLE-HUNG WINDOW CRASHES DOWN, IT CAN CAUSE INJURIES. USUALLY 
THE CAUSE IS A DEFECTIVE SASH BALANCE. HERE'S HOW TO FIX IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY ABRAMS, Abrams is a Los Angeles general contractor and a free-lance 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Do you have "guillotine windows," double-hung wood-frame windows that come 
crashing down every time you open them? Do you have windows in the house that 
cannot be opened fully because they snag on a thin cable that hangs loose at 
the side of the frame? 
</P>
<P>
Both problems are caused by a broken cable or spring from the sash balances, 
the mechanisms that balance the weight of the window sashes to keep them from 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are broken sash balances a constant source of annoyance, they are also 
a considerable safety hazard. Emergency room statistics indicate that many 
broken hands and fingers (especially childrens') result from wood windows 
falling due to broken balances. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that in most cases, window sash balances can be replaced by a 
novice in less than an hour once you have the proper part. 
</P>
<P>
To get started, you have to determine the correct weight sash balance to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Begin by taking the window measurements. Imagine both upper and lower sash were 
taken out of the frame, leaving a rectangular opening in the wall. What would 
the dimensions of the rectangle be? 
</P>
<P>
Then, determine whether the window requires one balance or two. With the lower 
sash fully closed, look into the window track just above the top of the sash. 
</P>
<P>
You will see a thin metal plate on either the left or the right indicating a 
one-balance window, or you will see a thin plate in both the left and right 
tracks, indicating a two-balance window. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the dimensions of the window and knowledge of whether one or two sash 
balances are required, you can go to most any hardware store and obtain the 
proper weight replacement sash balance. 
</P>
<P>
The replacement of the sash balance requires removing the sashes from the 
window frame. 
</P>
<P>
With a hammer and chisel, remove either the left or right "stop," the long thin 
molding against which the lower sash slides up and down. Begin at the top or 
bottom and tap the chisel blade into the joint between the stop and the window 
jamb. 
</P>
<P>
As the stop begins to separate from the jamb, carefully pull it away farther 
using the chisel blade as a pry bar. Pry the stop at several spots along its 
length to prevent its breaking. Once free, set the stop aside and remove any 
remaining nails. 
</P>
<P>
With the stop removed, the lower sash can be lifted slightly and swung out of 
the frame. If it is still connected by the cable at the bottom, use the chisel 
blade to pry the cable bracket nail from the lower edge. Grab the cable bracket 
and allow it to retract slowly into the sash balance now exposed midway up the 
window track. 
</P>
<P>
Set the lower window sash aside and begin removing the upper sash. Note the 
rounded molding that runs the length of the window jamb adjacent to the upper 
sash. This is the "parting bead" and also should be removed using a hammer and 
chisel in a similar way in which the stop was taken off. 
</P>
<P>
With the parting bead set aside, the upper sash is free. Swing it out of the 
frame and detach the sash balance cable if it still connected under the lower 
edge. 
</P>
<P>
Now that both upper and lower sashes have been removed from the frame, the sash 
balance itself is easily replaced. Simply pry it out of the window jamb with 
the claws of a hammer and discard it. 
</P>
<P>
With a pair of pliers grab the cable brackets that lay on the inside portion of 
the new balance and swing them around so they will be on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Insert the sash balance into the window jamb opening and secure it in place 
with the nails provided. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes the kay to the success of this repair, reassembling the window. 
</P>
<P>
Reinstall the upper sash first. Put the non-cable bracket edge of the sash into 
the track and swing the other edge toward the frame. Grasp the cable bracket 
exposed on the outside of the sash balance with a pair of pliers and pull it 
down far enough to clear the bottom of the sash. 
</P>
<P>
Continue swinging the sash as far as possible into the frame. Allow the cable 
bracket to retract until it contacts the bottom edge of the sash. Orient the 
bracket on the wood according to the outline left by the old bracket and secure 
it in place with one of the nails provided. 
</P>
<P>
Test the upper sash for free movement, and if it is OK, replace the parting 
bead into its groove and secure it with two or three 1 1/2-inch finishing nails 
driven directly through the top of it. 
</P>
<P>
Repeat this procedure for the lower sash. Attach the cable bracket under the 
sash, swing the sash into place, and test it for free movement. 
</P>
<P>
Before reattaching the stop, place it next to the lower sash and secure it with 
four or five evenly spaced 1 1/2-inch finishing nails driven about half way in. 
</P>
<P>
Retest the operation of the lower sash to assure that it is smooth. Remove and 
adjust the nails if necessary. Once you are satisfied that it operates 
properly, drive the nails in fully. Touch up any chipped paint on the casing or 
stop. Lubricate the window tracks with a thin coat of Vaseline if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
That's it. No longer will you test your frustration level and risk broken bones 
when you want some fresh air.

DON'T GET TIED UP ON REMOVING SASH CORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDY LANG, Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: One of the double-hung windows in our house has gone haywire. I am 
fairly certain the trouble is with the sash cord. Can the cord be removed or is 
it too much of a job? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Removing the sash is not difficult. Merely take off the stop moldings 
on the inside. Use a chisel or putty knife and work very carefully, especially 
if you intend to use the moldings again. If your aim is to replace the sash 
cord with another of the same type, be sure to observe how the cord is 
connected so you will be able to replace it without too much trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Before you do this, however, look into the kinds of sash cords now on the 
market. They are easier to use and install and are virtually indestructible. 
</P>
<P>
Can Plywood Be Nailed Directly to Studs? 
</P>
<P>
Q: When paneling an extra room with plywood, I can save a lot of time by 
nailing the plywood directly to the studding. But I read somewhere that it is 
much better to nail the panels to furring strips that have been attached to the 
studs. This seems like extra work. Is it necessary or can I go ahead and nail 
to the studs? 
</P>
<P>
A: You can nail the plywood right to the studs, but then you risk the studs 
warping or shrinking later on and causing the wall to be uneven. The furring 
strips minimize the possibility of this taking place. In still another method, 
you put up a drywall and then attach the plywood to it. In any case, no matter 
which method of installation you use, buy the plywood ahead of time so it can 
be kept in the room several days before application. This will give it time to 
acclimate. 
</P>
<P>
Powdered Pumice: Where to Buy It 
</P>
<P>
Q: You recently told someone about using powdered pumice to smooth the surface 
of a piece of furniture that had just been finished. I was unable to get it in 
my local hardware store, which referred me to the local pharmacy. Sure enough, 
the drug store carried it. Thought your readers would like to know. 
</P>
<P>
A: Thanks. While most hardware stores and home center dealers carry the 
powdered pumice, so do some drug stores and some art supply establishments. 
</P>
<P>
Sawing Metal Takes Different Strokes 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have cut a lot of wood, but I have never used a hacksaw. This time I have 
to cut some metal. Is there any trick to it or do I just saw the same way as 
with a crosscut saw? 
</P>
<P>
A: Forget about the way you cut wood. With a hacksaw, you do not apply pressure 
on the backstroke. The hacksaw must be held as flat as possible for an even 
cut. Put the pressure on the forward stroke, release the pressure on the back 
stroke. When possible, keep both hands on the hacksaw frame. Start the cut with 
several short foward strokes. When putting the blade in the frame, the teeth 
should slant forward. 
</P>
<P>
Should Molding on Plywood Be Glued? 
</P>
<P>
Q: To cover the edges of plywood, I plan on attaching molding to them. Should I 
use glue or nails or what? 
</P>
<P>
A: Use glue and then a couple of well-placed nails. Depending on the kind of 
project you are working on, the finishing nails can be driven a bit below the 
surface and the indentations filled with wood putty or other filler. 
</P>
<P>
Patches Available for Hiding Holes in Wall 
</P>
<P>
Q: The wallboard in our living room needs patching. I can handle most of the 
job, but I'm not sure how to go about filling the few spots where there are 
openings in the wall without anything behind them. Can I apply masking tape 
over each opening and then cover with a patching compound? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, but one of the modern products that will fill the bill is a ready-made 
patch available in most paint stores and home centers. Tape it on according to 
the directions and you will find it easy to disguise the patch when it is 
painted. 
</P>
<P>

remover, etc., are detailed in Andy Lang's booklet, "Wood Finishing in the

   People go to great lengths to improve upon nature, like having Budweiser labels tattooed across their backs, or maps of Africa stenciled on their heads. 
Ellen Caro has pictures of the New York Giants painted on her fingernails. 
And when she is in a certain mood, she changes the display -- to sex scenes in silhouette. 

   Ms. Caro, the president of an all-woman executive-search firm in Wayne, N.J., has her nails done by Liz Fojon at a salon called Phenomanails, in Fair Lawn. 
Ms. Fojon's naughty nails are a conversation piece, but she will gladly put a miniature of your mother on your thumb if you prefer, and people will still talk. 

   "You might say Liz rises to the occasion," says Ms. Caro, who is 39 and unmarried. 
Her fingernails have "opened many doors, personally and professionally." 

   If many women (and surely some men) want their fantasies at their fingertips, an industry is there to serve them. 
This year, nail salons are all over the place, particularly in store fronts that last season housed tanning parlors and that next year, who knows, may be filing for bankruptcy. 

   The armamentarium of a manicurist now goes well beyond emery boards and pink Hazel Bishop enamel, circa 1957. 
For instance, Ms. Fojon drills holes in fingernails and screws jewels into the holes. 
Prices have gone up accordingly. 
Ms. Fojon charges $4 per nail for hand-painting and stone work, rather less than one might expect for a modern-day Michelangelo, a bit more than for a standard $12 manicure in an upscale clip joint. 
Ms. Fojon charges $8 for a family portrait on one nail, which in New Jersey is getting up there in price. 

   Tamami Mihara, a fingernail artist at the Shu Uemura salon on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, has won competitions in the U.S. and in Tokyo for some of her exotic nail designs. 
In Japan, tattoos are associated with gangsters, but fancy fingernails are amusing. 
At the International Beauty Show in New York this year, Ms. Mihara nailed down second place for her "Dragon Lady." 
She gave her subject, Marisol Fernandez, black nails festooned with jewels, feathers and bows. 

   The design makes it hard to do the dishes and, more inconvenient still, it took two weeks to execute, but it was a prize winner. 
"You might go to a party wearing something like that," says Ms. Fernandez, who manages the salon. 

   Some ladies prefer a more understated look. 
The very demure actress Sharon McNight, who appeared in the recent Broadway musical "Starmites," wears a simple inch-long, 18-karat gold fake nail on her index finger. 
It catches the light and upstages the cast. 
She has had it for 10 years (so this trend has been long in the making). 
The bauble was presented to her by her costumers in San Francisco after she won an award for cabaret singing. 
She puts it on with Krazy Glue. 

   Question is: Is this for everyone? 
The over-made-up Brooklyn career girl might feel pretty on the F train in long fuchsia nails with cubic zirconia drilled in, not too close to the cuticle. 
But how about the Park Avenue investment banker on her way to Wall Street in a taxi? 

   Vivian Behrens, a vice president (for makeup and fragrance) at Estee Lauder Inc., says that women today are more self-assured and consequently are returning to things feminine, which of course means nail polish. 
"We all went through a stage where to wear nail lacquer was a sign that you were a dumb blonde," she says. 
But now nail color "is one of the ultimate accessories." 

   No wonder salon sales of manicures and artificial nails will total about $1.5 billion this year, according to Geoff Geils, a marketing executive at Flowery Beauty Products Inc., a Greenwich, Conn., manufacturer of manicure tools. 
It obviously isn't rich Connecticut ladies who are spending all that money. 
"People who can't afford to buy groceries are putting on artificial nails," says Suzanne Scherb, a distributor of fake nails in Farmingdale, N.Y. 

   Which brings things back to taste and class. 
Kenneth Battelle, whose Manhattan beauty salon, Kenneth, is very uptown, calls nail art "simply horrifying." 
Women who decorate their nails "are the people who go to Atlantic City," he says. 

   But if his is the last word, it is hardly the last thing to be said about fingernails. 
There are at least two hanging questions. 
The first is one Ralph Nader might ask: Is all this artificial stuff safe? 
The other is: What about just growing your own natural nails, from scratch as it were, till they are so long it's impossible to use your hands? 
What's wrong with that? 

   Almost anything that can be stuck onto the end of a fingernail will be. 
That includes liquid and powder overlays applied to the nail and shaped, tea-bag paper and Duco cement, even Miss Lee Press-On Nails for little girls. 
It includes extensions made of plastic, silk, linen and Fiberglas that are attached with glue. 
There is a gel bonded by ultraviolet light. 
Jim Nordstrom, who runs Creative Nail Design, a Carlsbad, Calif., nail business, says that "a lot of spending that went into defense, to develop new high-tech coatings," has made its way into fingernails, as Tang and Teflon went from NASA to the breakfast table. 

   Unfortunately, however, fake nails can cause infections if moisture collects under them. 
Ellen Gendler, a New York dermatologist, points out that some acrylics cause the natural nail to separate from its fleshy bed. 
Fungal infections and allergic reactions can result. 

   New York is one of about 10 states where anybody can hang out a shingle and be a manicurist. 
Although nail salons in states that don't license manicurists are visited by health inspectors when somebody complains, regulations are lacking to ensure proper sanitary procedures. 
States, such as California, that license nail technicians and nail parlors conduct routine inspections. 

   Karen Lessler, the president of a trade group in New York that is pushing for a licensing law, says that requiring manicurists to have 450 hours' training would go a long way toward protecting consumers. 
"You don't want clients contracting a staph infection or a fungus," she says. 
You don't want them to feel they are taking their life in their hands. 

   Given the perils, it is probably a good thing that some women merely let their nails grow to the point that they stop traffic. 
For them, the natural look is the thing, if talons can be called natural. 
Berta Ponzo, the 32-year-old owner of Salon Crista in New York, says she doesn't believe in fake nails. 
She cultivates her own horny substance -- nails actually are dead keratin -- extending 3 1/2 inches beyond her finger tips. (Fingernails typically grow about a quarter of an inch per month.) Ms. Ponzo says that when she flicks her wrist, the nails brush against one another and make music. 
All it takes to accomplish this nail-growing feat, she says, "is a little conscious effort" and two years. 
Also, she adds, "you have to really want it in your soul." 

   Dawn Granello, who owns the Night Shift nail salon on New York's Staten Island, believes that she "conquered something within" herself by growing her nails two inches past "the free edge." 
She had other problems to surmount, too, such as raising four children with nails that make it hard to open a refrigerator door. (In fact, she bought the fridge with the door that would be easiest to deal with in her condition.) And she does have a success secret: "You don't use your nails, you learn to use your knuckles." 

   Long, attention-getting nails seem to give certain women a feeling of mastery. 
"There's a feminine power" associated with growing long nails, according to Jerilyn Ross, who practices clinical psychology in Alexandria, Va. 
"It's sort of witchy. 
Witches in pictures always have long nails, and so do vampires." 

   Long nails can also be a handy distraction. 
Ms. Granello, the salon owner, says many of her customers are overweight. 
The attention they lavish on their nails gets them positive feedback and makes them feel better about themselves. 
"People come over to the table when they are out with their husbands and boyfriends and compliment them on their nails," she says. 

   So men, at last, are why some women go to all this trouble. 

   "My fiance really likes my nails long," says Jill Jones, a 23-year-old Chicago hairdresser and part-time model with three-inch nails. 
"But," she adds, "I wouldn't cut them if he asked."

<TEXT>
   Use your imagination and you can make over an entire room with a
single small tool _ a variable-power staple gun.
   Selecting such a stapler for multiple uses requires the choice of
one with multiple features.
   One such heavy-duty staple gun has a setting for use on materials
like hardwood, which needs the maximum power, and one for use on
such materials as gypsum wallboard, which needs only the minimum
amount of power. A rehammer feature allows restriking of protruding
staples.
   Also, consider the staple gun's ``pull,'' or the amount of
strength required to compress its handle and shoot off a staple, as
well as its weight in your hand. Remember, the first pull always
seems easier _ and the staple gun lighter _ at the start rather the
end of a long project.
   The ``easy pull'' handle requires just a squeeze, so that you
don't have to be as strong as Arnold Schwarzenegger to use it. It
has a lightweight non-steel frame. Designed for heavy duty use, it
carries a two-year warranty, another important feature. And its warm
orange color seems more user-friendly than the chrome finish of
other staplers.
   You can insulate new exterior walls by installing roll-type
insulation. Start from the top and work downward on walls, stapling
to the inside or outside edges of framing.
   Set the gun on maximum power and use large nine-sixteenth inch
staples. Drive the first staple through the top edge of the
insulation roll into the stud. Stretch tightly and drive in a second
staple, repeating until done. The vapor barrier is installed on the
inside, towards the heated areas. Use work gloves, eye protection
and mask to cover nose and mouth.
   Mark Furlong, manager of the staple gun division of Emhart Home
Products, says you can panel a room easily with a staple gun and
nailpins. Traditional paneling continues to be popular, but paneling
is also available in a wide variety of designs and colors and can
even resemble wallpaper.
   Most paneling is sold in standard 4-foot by 8-foot sheets, though
some home centers will cut to size on request. Set the staple gun
power dial on ``maximum'' and use nine-sixteenth inch nailpins to
secure the paneling in place.
   Spacing of the nailpins depends on surfaces: on wood framing,
space nailpins from 6 inches to 8 inches; on gypsum wallboard, space
from 10 inches to 12 inches. Be sure the paneling is tight against
fastening surface. To assure a customized look, use the nailpins to
add molding.
   To create an accent wall, apply upholstery fabric directly to one
or two walls to dramatically change the focus of an entire room and
cover a lifeless blank wall or outdated paneling. Fabrics with
smaller random patterns will be easier to work with than those with
straight lines. Large open designs may show seams. Mix or match your
selection of fabric colors according to your room colors.
   Measure wall area carefully and don't forget above doors and
around windows. Add 6 inches to lengths for pattern alignment. Find
square inches, divide by the width of material, less 2 inches for
seams. Convert into yardage. When cutting fabric, allow an extra 6
inches in length to align patterns. Shift lengths of material up or
down to match. Machine stitch with one-inch seams and press.
   Start installation first in the upper left-hand corner. Stretch
fabric taut 4 feet along ceiling and tack into place. Set the gun's
adjustable power dial to ``minimum'' for wallboard or ``maximum'' to
cover paneling and three-eighth inch staples. Staple down the left
hand side, keeping pattern aligned vertically. Space staples 3
inches apart. Then staple the fabric taut along the ceiling, down
the right side and across the bottom.
   Trim excess with a razor knife and straightedge. Cover stapled
fabric edges along the floor, ceiling and corners with wood molding
or upholstery welt. Install with the staple gun and nine-sixteenth
inch nailpins. Space nailpins 10 inches apart on molding; on welt,
space 6 inches apart, keeping taut.

INTERIORS: FAUX PANELS CAN BRIGHTEN A HUMDRUM WALL; 
</P>
<P>
THEY ADD A BIG SPLASH OF COLOR, DRAMA TO A ROOM FOR RELATIVELY LITTLE WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Is a long, blank wall staring you in the face? One that doesn't seem to lend 
itself to pictures or shelves? 
</P>
<P>
One design solution is faux panels. These seldom-used, somewhat formal, 
decorative notes are actually not so complicated that they can't be done by 
amateurs, with some help from do-it-yourself manuals. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who can measure and miter-cut wood molding and put up quickie wallpaper 
or wall fabrics can transform dull-looking stretches of conventional flat 
paneling, dry wall or plaster. You sacrifice little or no space. 
</P>
<P>
And the technique can become "new wave" or "minimal" for modernist interiors 
with the use of metal or Art Deco moldings or mirrored paneling. 
</P>
<P>
"They add interest," says Baltimore designer Paulette Pierlot. She recently 
added moldings around traditional paintings in wall designs for a French 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
In another design, what she calls "an ugly expanse" of wall-to-wall sliding 
doors and windows 27 feet wide in a condo was attractively tamed and unified by 
framing the tops and sides in a latticework of conventional wood molding. 
</P>
<P>
Baltimore muralist and designer Thomas Van Damme, who is also known for his 
elaborate illusionist wall treatments, says this about interior faux panels: 
</P>
<P>
"You can use them to create an illusion that a wall is something else that it 
isn't. Panels are useful in orchestrating space with elements that really 
aren't there physically. They are also useful in improving the proportions of a 
space." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Creating Interest 
</P>
<P>
Interest can be created on problem walls by making use of the virtually 
limitless moldings and custom papers and fabrics available today. Dining rooms, 
long hallways, libraries, dens and living rooms with high ceilings are some of 
the areas particularly suitable for faux-paneling techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Van Damme says any decorative wall treatment has to start with the assumption 
that "no walls or floors are absolutely level or equal in all dimensions . . . 
even in new housing." You get around the hurdle of the unevenness by careful 
use of a carpenter's level. 
</P>
<P>
He outlines the following step-by-step procedure: 
</P>
<P>
You have to decide in advance on the number of panels you are going to do and 
their proportions. Try not to repeat the same size panels monotonously. It's 
better to vary things. A scheme with "a large panel in the center flanked by 
two smaller ones will help the total architecture of the room," Van Damme says. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Draw a Level Line 
</P>
<P>
Establish the distance you want your panel from the nearest window, door or 
corner. Place a pencil-point mark at the middle of the outside edge of the 
closest piece of molding. Using the level, draw a vertical line through the 
pencil point as long as the piece of molding. Then measure the bottom, top and 
other side of the panel, drawing them on the wall in pencil, and checking the 
bubble to see that each line is level. 
</P>
<P>
The pencil frame gives the outside dimension of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
Continue along the wall, drawing each panel according to your pre-established 
pattern, measuring not from the floor or ceiling or shoe molding, but from the 
level rectangle already drawn on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
Once the pattern is in place, prepare the molding. It is helpful to have an 
experienced handyman or carpenter make sure the corners are mitered exactly. 
The pieces can be cut without delay from prefinished wooden or plastic 
moldings, but if you use unpainted wooden moldings, you should finish them 
before cutting or installation. 
</P>
<P>
The horizontal and vertical panels can now be placed on the wall. Run standard 
construction adhesive along the back of the moldings with a caulking gun and 
apply them to the wall. Small nails will hold the strips in place while they 
harden. 
</P>
<P>
If your panel is to frame wallpaper or fabric, rather than paint, cut the panel 
inserts a little larger than the measurements of the interior of each panel. 
Then use a razor blade or a matte knife to trim off the excess. If you are 
handling a large panel that will take more than one width of wallpaper or 
fabric, install the central strip first and work outward from there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Prepare a Plan 
</P>
<P>
"Wallpaper and paint stores usually have brochures to help you out with the 
fine points of cementing with wall adhesives," Van Damme says. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some additional hints: 
</P>
<P>
It helps to lay out your panel scheme in advance on graph paper, using a scale 
of 1 inch to 1 foot. 
</P>
<P>
The most pleasing proportions for wall panels are said to be in ratios of 1 to 
2 or 3 to 5 along the sides, though rectangular panels in confined spaces, such 
as over windows or doors in high-ceiling settings, can violate this rule. Oval 
or half-round shapes, usually small, are also traditional in formal rooms. 
</P>
<P>
A crown molding that runs around the ceiling at the top of the wall is 
sometimes necessary as a finishing touch to balance a room redone with fabric 
or paper panels. Usually it is somewhat heavier and wider than the molding of 
the panel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chair Rail Accents Room 
</P>
<P>
A chair rail around a room gives another architectural accent to an interior. 
If you are installing one with paneling above, keep the rail 29 to 32 inches 
above the floor for rooms 8 feet to 11 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
If your planned panels have large enough interior spaces, they can be further 
glamorized by hanging framed pictures, medallions, small clocks and other 
decorative elements inside the molding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Special Technique 
</P>
<P>
There is a special technique for tacking up paneling strips without the risk of 
splitting them. If hardwood is involved, you should drill a hole in the wood 
before tacking it into the wall. Use a nail with its head snipped off as a 
drill bit to prepare the hole. For soft woods you need only tap the nail on its 
point. 
</P>
<P>
There's nothing wrong with picking routine moldings from your favorite home 
supply store. Chain hardware-lumber outlet stores are good places to look. 
Molding strips 8 feet long and up to an inch or so in width and are likely to 
cost from 50 cents to about $2 a foot.

<LEADPARA>  Q I don't want to damage the brick fascia on the front of my house's entry by
drilling into the bricks, but I need to anchor some light fixtures and an
address sign to the wall. A hardware store clerk has told me that I can't put
screw anchors into the mortar between bricks. Is this true and what is an
alternative?;   A Mortar doesn't always fill in completely the area between
bricks, and will sometimes crumble when drilled. That's the reason the clerk
is cautioning you.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MORTAR OK FOR ANCHORING FIXTURES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Do It Yourself  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     However, unless the light fixtures and address sign are heavy cast iron, I
think you can still put anchors into the mortar. Use anchors threaded to
receive quarter-inch bolts. Drill a hole in the mortar slightly larger in
diameter and deeper than the size of the anchor. Coat the bolt threads with a
mold-releasing agent or silicone spray and screw the bolt into the anchor.
This will minimize epoxy getting onto the anchor threads.;   Mix enough
two-part epoxy to liberally coat the inside and back of the hole. Insert the
anchor flush with the face of the adjoining bricks (not flush with the face of
the mortar). Allow the epoxy to fully cure according to the manufacturer's
instructions before removing the bolt. You may find that it's necessary to
enlarge the mounting holes in your light fixtures to accommodate the
quarter-inch bolt.; Q I bought an older home with a semifinished basement. An
all-purpose room has been finished with paneling over block walls and a
dry-wall ceiling. The room always has a musty odor and I suspect that moisture
is coming through the blocks and getting trapped behind the paneling. This is
the only area of the basement that has this odor. How can I check the wall
behind the paneling?;   A I assume that you've carefully checked all other
wall areas in the basement for any signs of leaks and that your all-purpose
room is not trapping moisture from an adjoining clothes dryer, shower or other
source. If the paneling has been nailed to furring strips, use a nail set and
drive the finishing nails through the panels (remove the top nails last). If
the panels have been glued in place they probably will need to be pried off
the wall and won't be reusable.;   Inspect the exposed blocks for water
stains, mold, mildew -- any sign of moisture. Your most effective time to
search for dampness or a leak is immediately after a heavy rain.;   Before
replacing the paneling, securely tape a one-foot-square piece of aluminum foil
to the block wall, about 16 inches below the exterior soil line. Make sure
that you tape all around the edges to seal them well.;   Periodically check
the aluminum foil for moisture on the side facing into the room. After three
days, remove the tape and see if there is any moisture accumulation on the
side of the foil that has been facing the wall. Moisture accumulation on the
room side of the foil indicates condensation and that the source of moisture
is from within the room. Moisture on the wall side means that moisture is
coming through the wall, and the wall will require repair or sealing. (There
are health hazards associated with using some masonry sealers indoors. Read
warnings carefully.);   Nailed panels can be renailed to the furring strips
and the holes patched with a matching putty stick. It's possible that moisture
could be seeping up the paneling from a concrete floor, so inspect the floor
as well.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Roofing Nails Put Dent In Police Speed Traps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTMINSTER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Someone apparently bent on taking the
wind out of a police crackdown on speeders has been puncturing
tires on patrol cars and motorcycles by sprinkling the officers'
highway hideaways with roofing nails.
   Since May, more than 40 tires on patrol cars and motorcycles
have been flattened by the roofing nails, authorities said
Wednesday.
   After it happened more than once, Westminster police figured
they were targets of booby-traps placed by someone who knew just
where officers would park while looking for speeders.
   ``It was just too coincidental,'' said police spokesman Rick
Kempsell.
   The latest incident occurred Wednesday on a ramp leading to
westbound U.S. 36. Two tires on a police car were punctured. Police
estimated 300 to 500 of the small nails were scattered along the
ramp's shoulder, less than a quarter mile from police headquarters.
   Roofing nails also have been found scattered near emergency
vehicle turnaround areas along the turnpike and Interstate 25.
   The three-quarter-inch mails have flattened at least 30 patrol
car tires and ruined at least a dozen police motorcycle tires since
May. Car tires can be repaired, but the motorcycle tires must be
replaced at a cost of $127 apiece.
   Police said there's no way to know how many passing motorists
also have had tires flattened by the nails.
