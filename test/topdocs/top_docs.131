   Toni Morrison felt ``kind of a redemption'' when
she won the Pulitzer Prize in fiction for her spellbinding and
searing song of slavery, ``Beloved.''
   ``I thought it was quite possible that the value of the book
would not be allowed to be the only consideration that the
(Pulitzer) committee would have to consider, and that saddened
me,'' Morrison said Thursday.
   The editor, playwright and author had been the epicenter of a
literary earthquake and controversy.
   After ``Beloved'' did not win either the National Book Award or
the National Book Critics Circle Award, 48 prominent black writers
and critics signed a statement deploring the celebrated writer's
lack of recognition.
   Morrison's ``Song of Solomon'' did win the National Book Critics
Circle Award for 1977, but the two other awards are considered more
prestigious.
   The statement, published as an open letter in the New York Times
Book Review in January, was signed by such literary figures as the
writers Maya Angelou, Amiri Baraka, John Williams and John Edgar
Wideman, the poet June Jordan and critic Henry Louis Gates Jr.
   ``Beloved,'' they said, was ``a gift to our community, our
country, our conscience.''
   The statement said Morrison ``has yet to receive the national
recognition that her five major works of fiction entirely deserve.''
   Although Morrison said she didn't know a campaign was being
mounted on her behalf, when she read the letter, she felt wonderful.
   ``It says you're valuable to us. It doesn't say you're flawless;
it just says we esteem you. It's kind of obit information _ the
kind of thing you never expect.''
   However, Morrison said she was hurt by charges that she had
manipulated other writers.
   ``The only manipulations are between the covers of the book,''
she said. ``There was an article some one read to me on the phone
about `affirmative- action prizes.' That's depressing.
   ``Somebody told me that I should simply come out and declare
that I did not want the Pulitzer,'' she continued. ``So I dismissed
all of it very happily from my mind until today. And I had genuine
astonishment that the committee made a decision on the merits of
the book.''
   The fiction committee consisted of Julian Moynahan, critic and
professor of English at Rutgers University; critic Richard Eder, a
former Pulitzer winner; and the writer Alice Adams.
   Moynahan said the jurors made their recommendations six weeks
before the letter was published and felt no pressure to recommend
Morrison's book.
   ``I think her book is one of the greatest American novels I've
ever read in my life,'' he said.
   The best-selling ``Beloved,'' published by Knopf, is partly
based on a true account of an escaped slaved named Margaret Garner
who decided to kill her child rather than see her returned to
bondage. It was a chilling choice faced by many during the horrors
of slavery; many Africans chose suicide in the Atlantic during the
crossing on slave ships, and others killed their children or wives
before leaving the continent.
   In language rich and riveting, Morrison tells the tale of Sethe,
who escapes from Kentucky and struggles to survive in post-bellum
Ohio in a house haunted by her dead baby.
   The 57-year-old Morrison, who grew up in Lorain, Ohio, had heard
the Garner story and found herself curious and puzzled by the woman
herself.
   ``In spite of all the political furor about her, the woman was
elusive,'' the writer said. ``She was described always as being so
serene, so calm. But she said very little. The mystery was not the
situation but what goes on inside a woman like that; what was she
feeling?''
   Morrison, a former Random House editor whose other works include
the novels ``Tar Baby'' and ``Song of Solomon,'' and the play
``Dreaming Emmett,'' said ``Beloved'' is the best writing she's
ever done.

Toni Morrison: Finally Just a Writer

   A few summers ago, Toni Morrison looked out at the Hudson River from the little pier of her Rockland County house and discovered that she was feeling dizzy. 
She had, at the urging of her Knopf editor, finally quit her job at Random House to concentrate all her energies on writing fiction. 
And now, lulled by the sight of the water swelling by, she realized that a great burden had been lifted from her. 
Still, Miss Morrison knows, what weighs you down also anchors you. 
She was not only lightheaded with relief, she was giddy with fright. 

   A child of the Great Depression, she had worked since the age of 12 and, in adulthood, had toiled over other people's manuscripts, taught college classes as well, raised two sons and stolen time from the night to write fiction. 
Absent an annuity, a steady wage is as close to security as a single parent can get. 
Moreover, Miss Morrison is a proud and rather distrustful woman who hates to be, in her word, "beholden." 
That condition includes accepting publishers' advances. 
Each of her four fine novels of the American black experience, from "The Bluest Eye" in 1970 to the bestselling "Song of Solomon" and "Tar Baby" of recent years, was written without a contract and completed before it was sold. 

   As Miss Morrison saw it, with her nice sense of irony, "The games that I preferred were always ones where I was the only player." 
She liked the idea of competing only with herself; she was certain that she could be more critical and more perceptive about her work than any professional reader, even Robert Gottlieb, a former Knopf editor, who published her until he moved to The New Yorker recently. 
Besides, "to have had a contract before I had done it would have made it a homework assignment." 
Having considered and finally vanquished all these doubts, Miss Morrison wrote a formal proposal, took an advance, set to work and turned out an amazing book, the best of her career. 

   "Beloved" (273 pages, $18.95), set in post-Civil War Ohio, is Miss Morrison's first period fiction. 
Although she insists it is not a novel about living in slavery, it is, among other things, a novel about living in slavery and about remembering it and, finally, through mythic and tribal exorcism, about learning to survive its cruelest wounds. 
In great part, the book is the story of Sethe, the runaway Kentucky slave woman who cheated her master of his ownership the only way she knew -- by destroying his property. 
The setting is a house first haunted by the "spiteful" spirit of a murdered baby and then possessed by its adult incarnation. 

   A little while before publication, Miss Morrison, 56, a robust, joyous woman with skin the color of creamy caramel and dark, smart, animated eyes, traveled down from Spring Valley, N.Y., to Knopf's office to talk about her book, an undertaking that had surprised her in several ways. 
After "Tar Baby" in 1981, she thought her novel-writing days were probably over. 
"I would not write another novel to either make a living or because I was able to. 
If it was not an overwhelming compulsion or I didn't feel absolutely driven by the ideas that I wanted to explore, I wouldn't do it. 
And I was content not to ever be driven that way again." 

   So Miss Morrison turned to theater, writing the book and songs for a musical she called "New Orleans." 
Centered on the great flowering of jazz before 1920, it had a workshop production in New York in 1983. 
By that time, an old memory was pursuing her. 
At Random House 10 years earlier, she had edited "The Black Book," a scrapbook of bits and pieces about significant moments in the lives of America's black people. 
One item had been a 1855 newspaper account of a runaway Kentucky slave who, about to be recaptured in Ohio, had killed her child rather than return it to a future of servitude. 

   Never forgotten, the story suddenly seized her imagination, and she found herself thinking about a work that would use the episode to explore the period and the people. 
Mr. Gottlieb liked the idea and at last persuaded her it was time to become a full-time novelist. 
This new state, she discovered with delight, allowed her the luxury of an occasional day of "being fallow" instead of rushing around tending to incessant professional and domestic chores. 

   Midway into the book, she blocked and set the work aside to try her hand at a play for the Writers Institute at the State University in Albany, where she teaches one course a semester as Albert Schweitzer professor of humanities. 
Her Albany colleagues had asked for something special to mark the creation of Martin Luther King's birthday as a public holiday. 
Miss Morrison's response was "Dreaming Emmett," a play about a "cause celebre" of the '60s -- the murder of Emmett Till, a Chicago teen-ager who whistled at a white woman in Mississippi. 
Eight months later, the play had been done and Miss Morrison, worn down by the demands of theater, was eager to go back to her novel. 

   Last fall, she brought Mr. Gottlieb what she thought was the first third of a very long book and reported apologetically, "It's not going very fast." 
Mr. Gottlieb's response after reading it was, "Well, Toni, you have a book here." 

   She had planned a novel that would carry the descendants of her Kentucky-Ohio people of 1873 into the 20th century; the middle section would concentrate on one year of the great explosion of the arts in the Harlem of the '20s and the last would deal with our own time. 
Now, to her surprise, Miss Morrison has the first volume of what is to be a trilogy. 

   In a biographical note she wrote for an earlier work, Miss Morrison reported that she first started to set stories down on paper years earlier, when she was teaching at Howard University and her marriage to the father of her two children was breaking up: "I wrote like someone with a dirty habit. 
Secretly, compulsively, slyly." 
Even when she went public, it was hard to tell people that, as she puts it, writing is central to her life. 
For a long time, she was "an editor who wrote, a teacher who wrote, a mother who wrote." 
It's a pleasure to report that after five books, Toni Morrison finally has given herself permission to acknowledge flat out that she is a writer who writes.

   The 1988 Pulitzer Prize for fiction was awarded
Thursday to Toni Morrison for ``Beloved,'' a novel which was at the
center of controversy when it did not win two other major literary
prizes.
   The prize for drama went to ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' by Alfred
Uhry, which like ``Beloved'' deals with race relations in the
United States.
   The prize for general non-fiction went to Richard Rhodes for
``The Making of the Atomic Bomb.''
   The prize for biography went to David Herbert Donald for ``Look
Homeward: A Life of Thomas Wolfe,'' about the American novelist.
Donald also won the Pulitzer Prize for biography in 1961 for
``Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War.''
   The prize in history went to Robert V. Bruce, a professor at
Boston University, for ``The Launching of Modern American Science
1846-1876.''
   William Meredith, an award-winning poet associated with
Connecticut College, won the poetry prize for ``Partial Accounts:
New and Selected Poems.''
   The prize for music was awarded to William Bolcom, a professor
at the University of Michigan, for ``12 New Etudes for Piano.''
   The focus of attention this year was on the fiction prize, which
was awarded against a backdrop of controversy and literary politics.
   After ``Beloved'' did not win either the National Book Award or
the National Book Critics Circle Award, 48 prominent black writers
and critics signed a statement deploring Ms. Morrison's lack of
recognition.
   Because she had never won the National Book Award or the
Pulitzer Prize, said the statement, published as an open letter in
the New York Times Book Review, ``she has yet to receive the
national recognition that her five major works of fiction entirely
deserve.''
   Ms. Morrison's ``Song of Solomon'' did win the National Book
Critics Circle Award for 1977, but the two other awards are
considered more prestigious.
   ``Beloved'' is the agonizing story of a former slave in
post-Civil War Ohio who struggles to cope with the brutal death of
her daughter.
   Ms. Morrison uses flashbacks, multiple points of view and a
singularly vivid ghost to describe the emotional trauma of slavery
from the perspective of Sethe, who kills her daughter rather than
yield her to bondage.
   ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' the drama winner, tells the story of an
irascible white woman and her black chauffeur. The play follows
their relationship over a quarter-century, ending in 1973.
   The play opened off-Broadway in April 1987 at the Playwrights
Horizons Studio Theater and later moved to a larger off-Broadway
theater where it is still running.
   ``The Making of the Atomic Bomb,'' the winner for general
non-fiction, won a National Book Award last fall in the same
category.
   Rhodes, who spent five years researching and writing the book,
said in a recent interview: ``The making of the bomb is a story on
the scale of `Moby Dick.' I don't see much of a difference between
writing fiction and fact, except, of course, that fact has to be
documented.''

   Toni Morrison struggled through 200 years of
history to write a small story that would deeply touch those who
read her spellbinding novel, ``Beloved,'' winner of this year's
Pulitzer Prize for fiction.
   ``I was only aware of how difficult it was to do and how fearful
it was for me because it required living there all those years,''
Morrison said in an interview Thursday. ``About the fourth, fifth,
sixth or seventh revisions I began to see the authority and maybe
the surrender. And when the language arrived I felt this very deep
pleasure and a feeling that I could serve both characters well.''
   The book, which quickly climbed best-seller lists when it was
published last year by Alfred A. Knopf Inc., is based on a true
account of an escaped slave named Margaret Garner who decided to
kill her child rather than see her returned to bondage.
   It was a chilling choice faced by many during the horrors of
slavery; some Africans chose suicide during the crossing on slave
ships, while others killed children or wives before leaving the
continent.
   In rich, riveting language, Morrison tells the tale of Sethe,
who escapes from Kentucky and struggles to survive in post-Civil
War Ohio in a house haunted by her dead baby.
   ``I had made myself a promise that I would not hunt for a
story,'' Morrison said. ``I wanted the book to find me. I was also
weary of taking on a writing project just because I was a writer; I
wanted it to be something that was driven.''
   Morrison, 57, who grew up in Lorain, Ohio, had heard the Garner
story, and found herself curious and puzzled by the woman.
   ``It seemed to me that was ... worth a text,'' she said. ``I got
very frustrated while writing, and each time I felt I couldn't
write it. And then I felt that if I couldn't do it justice, then it
would be like the slave owners had won.''
   However, the author of ``Song of Solomon,'' which won the
National Book Critics Circle Award for 1977, ``Tar Baby'' and the
play ``Dreaming Emmett,'' said ``Beloved'' is the best writing
she's done.
   She's reluctant, though, to call it the Great American Novel.
   ``I shied away from giving myself labels like great,'' the
author said. ``But it certainly is an American novel because I
think American literature is coherent and American history is
coherent only when black history is in it. So it becomes American
in that sense because it completes something.''
   Morrison, a graduate of Howard and Cornell universities and a
former editor at Random House, lives near Nyack, N.Y., in the
Hudson River Valley, and teaches at the State University of New
York at Albany.
   Morrison, who had written her other books while still an editor,
left her job at Random in 1983 to work on ``Beloved.''
   ``The quality of the work improved enormously,'' she said. ``I
had time _ not just writing time, but novel time. Novels don't
emerge in the chronological time of human beings; you have to give
it its own time.
   ``That's six years between the last one in 1981 and this one.
Three of those years was writing and revising and at least a year
and a half was spent thinking, clarifying things.''
   Morrison felt ``kind of a redemption'' on winning the Pulitzer
because of the controversy and literary politics surrounding the
prize.
   After ``Beloved'' did not win either the National Book Award or
the National Book Critics Circle Award, 48 prominent black writers
and critics signed a statement deploring the celebrated writer's
lack of recognition.
   There was the feeling the Pulitzer fiction committee might
succumb to pressure and give Morrison the award, which saddened her
because she wanted ``Beloved'' judged for its own literary value,
not because its author is black.
   ``Joy is uppermost because I really was thinking dark and
difficult thoughts about what was available to this book in terms
of recognition,'' she said. ``I never had any doubt that it was
worth first-rate consideration and recognition, but I did not
believe that that alone _ that its sheer merit was going to be the
sole criterion.
   ``My second feeling is my respect for the difficulties the
committee chose to ignore _ the outside matters of speculation and
gossip.''

<HEAD>Celebrated Concert Pianist Solomon Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The concert pianist Solomon, hailed as one of the
century's most distinguished pianists but forced to cut short his
career because of a stroke, has died at age 85, his family said.
   Solomon, born Solomon Cutner but known professionally by his
first name only, died Feb. 2, his family announced Tuesday. No
cause of death was given.
   Solomon was born Aug. 9, 1902, one of seven children in a family
in London's rough East End. At age 7 he began studying music. One
of his fellow students became the Queen Mother, mother of Queen
Elizabeth II.
   Solomon made his concert hall debut when he was 8 years old,
playing playing Mozart's B flat Concerto and the slow movement of
Tchaikovsky's First Concerto at the Queen's Hall in London.
   He later appeared again at the Queen's Hall, under conductor Sir
Henry Wood, playing Beethoven's Third Concerto and Liszt's
Hungarian Fantasy, and in 1911 undertook his first British tour.
The same year he played to the royal family at Buckingham Palace,
and his career as a child prodigy was established.
   Solomon appeared with many of the world's most famous conductors
and orchestras, but by the time he was 16, he had tired of the
concert hall circuit and temporarily quit to resume his musical
studies.
   Wood wrote in his autobiography that the young Solomon told him
he had ``no boy's interests, no games,'' because of his career.
   ``As he said, it had been piano, piano, and nothing but piano,''
wrote Wood.
   Solomon resumed his concert hall career in 1921, made his
American debut in 1926, and was one of the world's most
sought-after pianists until suffering a debilitating stroke in 1956.
   The Times of London wrote: ``He developed his technical
virtuosity to the highest pitch, but his outstanding quality was
the intellectual insight and poetry of feeling which he brought to
the keyboard repertory, from Mozart to Debussy.''
   Another London paper, The Daily Telegraph, wrote: ``Solomon's
clarity of articulation, his warm, soft-grained tone, musical
accuracy and honesty of purpose shone through all his performances,
and his virtuosity was so formidable as to be unnoticeable.''
   Solomon is survived by his wife, Gwendoline Byrne, who was one
of his former pupils.

<HEAD>Company That Owns ``Happy Birthday'' Song is For Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Happy Birthday to You,'' a song that seems to
belong to everyone, can be bought by whoever purchases the company
that owns its copyright.
   The Sengstack family of Princeton, N.J., which for half a
century has owned Birchtree Ltd., the company that holds the
copyright to the song, has decided to sell the company, The New
York Times reported today.
   The concern could sell for $12 million or more.
   ``Happy Birthday'' brings in about $1 million a year, the
newspaper said. The song's 75-year copyright expires in 2010, when
it enters the public domain.
   Patty Smith Hill and her sister, Mildred J. Hill, two
kindergarten teachers from Louisville, Ky., who also taught Sunday
school, wrote the song. It was included in ``Song Stories for the
Sunday School,'' a book they wrote in 1893.
   In its original version, the ``Happy Birthday'' melody had the
lyrics: ``Good Morning to you, good morning to you, good morning
dear children, good morning to all.''
   Only later did the sisters add the birthday words.
   ``Happy Birthday,'' is one of the three most popular songs in
the English language along with ``Auld Lang Syne'' and ``For He's a
Jolly Good Fellow,'' according to the Guinness Book of World
Records.
   ``Happy Birthday'' is also sung in many other languages,
including Spanish, Dutch, Swedish and Malaysian.
   The Sengstack family acquired the song when John F. Sengstack, a
New York accountant, bought the Clayton F. Summy Co., a Chicago
sheet-music retailer that published the Hill sisters' work. The
copyright was registered by Summy in 1935.
   Besides owning the copyright to about 50,000 titles, Birchtree
owns the Suzuki Method, a musical instrumental instruction method
for children, and the Francis Clark library for piano students.
   Some peculiar situations have arisen as a result of an effort to
enforce the copyright of a song as popular as ``Happy Birthday.''
   By law, any public performance for profit or mechanical
reproduction should require a fee.
   Summy sued Postal Telegraph in the 1940s when the song was used
in singing telegrams. The lawsuit was dropped when company lawyers
were stymied by the argument that even though the song was used for
profit, it was not sung in public.
   The company also objected when Frederick's of Hollywood
advertised underwear that played ``Happy Birthday.''
   Casio digital watches that can be programmed to play the
birthday song every hour on the owner's birthday bring Birchtree a
penny a watch.

When the American baritone William Parker found his career, as well as his
body, ravaged by the Aids virus, he again turned to song and conceived the
idea for The AIDS Quilt Songbook. He commissioned from leading composers and
poets a still-growing collection of songs that, like the panels in the Names
Project quilt, remember individuals who have died of Aids.
Like the quilt's panels, the Songbook songs are performed in whatever
configuration best suits an occasion. The 16 songs recently performed during
the San Francisco Symphony's 'Wet Ink' new-music festival turned out to be,
among other things, a memorial for Parker himself, who died in New York on
March 29 at the age of
49.
The musically exemplary performances by the baritones Kurt Ollmann, David
Evitts, and Andrew Solomon-Glover were unified by the deeply sympathetic
piano playing of William Huckaby, an associate of the project from its
inception. The songs (soon to be published by Boosey and Hawkes) ranged from
the sweetly elegiac (Ned Rorem's 'A Dream of Nightingales') to the ragingly
defiant (Donald Wheelock's 'Fury'). While each poem and its setting captured
an aspect of grief, some inevitably left longer echoes in memory.
Solomon-Glover intoned John Harbison's 'The Flute of Interior Time' in a
rapt hush. Ollmann, who captured the specific consolation in Thom Gunn's
'The Reassurance' (set by Donald St. Pierre), carefully traced the thread of
a Chinese proverb embedded in the Ron Schreiber text of Carl Byron's 'the
birds of sorrow.' Evitts masterfully delineated the desultory undertow in
William Bolcom's bluesy 'Vaslav's Song' and kept listeners hanging on the
heartbreaking narrative of Lee Hoiby's 'Investiture at Cecconi's'
Throughout, the powerful texts told, even across difficult musical idioms.
Sad lines, like 'Paul Jacobs is playing Busoni on the radio' (from Chris De
Blasio's 'An Elegy to Paul Jacobs') were wrenching. Yet the most memorable
words were the hard ones, like the rapier word-play of poet Charles Barber's
'Death be nimble - life was quick' in St Pierre's 'Fairy Book Lines.' Even a
San Francisco concert audience was pommelled by poet Melvin Dixon's tough
talk - 'Night sweats. Dry cough/Loose stools. Weight loss.' rendered with
uncomprom-
ising force by Evitts.
The music was deeply personal. If some of it seemed less than external, it
bears remembering that no one wanted to have to write this music, and that
the participants would like nothing more than for this music to become
unnecessary and obsolete.

   The new book ``Ain't Nothin' as Sweet as My
Baby'' contains a picture of country singer Jett Williams at the
age of 2 playing a toy guitar.
   It is a telling photograph, because Jett grew up to discover
that she was the daughter of country music legend Hank Williams.
   ``That fascinated me when I knew that Hank Williams was my
father, to think back on how I always played guitar and always
sang,'' she says. ``It made me feel really good, as if it was
something he left me.''
   Jett Williams tells her story in the book, how she was adopted
first by Hank Williams' mother and after her death by a Mobile,
Ala., couple named Deupree who tell her that Hank might be her
father but there's no proof and nothing can be done.
   Jett launches a search and learns that she's the daughter of
Bobbie Jett and Hank Williams. In the last five years, she has been
through many courts. There's big money involved but Jett says that
finding her roots, not money, was paramount. Her legal name is
Cathy Deupree Adkinson. Her stage name combines the last names of
her parents.
   Don Helms and Jerry Rivers, longtime members of Hank Williams'
band, the Drifting Cowboys, have embraced her. So far this year,
Jett and the Drifting Cowboys Band have played some 40 dates. ``I
really love it,'' she says of her traditional country show. ``I'm
having the time of my life.''
   The hardest thing in her search, Jett said, was discovering that
her mother had died. ``I had put so much stock in that she was
going to be able to answer all my questions.'' It was also
difficult to accept that her mother voluntarily gave her up.
   The best thing about Williams' search, she says, was meeting
Keith Adkinson, the Washington lawyer who took her case and is now
her second husband. He calls her B.J. because documents that he
found read ``in re: the matter of Baby Jett.'' He manages her
career and practices law, with ``Jett law'' taking the largest
share of his time.
   ``Also wonderful was finding the pre-birth contract and finding
out that Hank Williams was my father and that he wanted me,'' she
said in an interview. ``It was a wonderful emotional cushion for me
to land on.''
   On Oct. 15, 1952, Bobbie Jett and Hank Williams signed a
three-page, notarized document which said that he would give her a
plane ticket to California within a month after she gave birth and
he would pay hospital and doctor bills and support their child, who
would live with his mother for two years then live with him.
   ``I think it tells a lot about my father as a human being. He
loved me before I was born; he took me sight unseen. To me it's the
greatest compliment a father could give a child.'' Hank Williams
died Jan. 1, 1953, five days before his daughter was born.
   In 1985, Hank Williams Jr. sued in Alabama and Jett Williams
sued in federal court in New York over Williams' estate. In 1987,
the lower court in Alabama said Hank Williams Jr. was sole heir to
the estate of Hank Williams, who died without a will, and Jett
Williams was named a child of Hank Williams. In 1989, the Supreme
Court of Alabama ruled that Jett had been the victim of fraud, by
people who tried to keep her from finding out her parentage, and
said she can share in the estate.
   Still to come is a trial in New York regarding copywright of
Williams' songs. Will his two children and second wife share song
royalties equally or will the widow get half and the children get a
quarter each and from what year shall the daughter start collecting
her share?
   Among Williams' some 150 songs are ``Your Cheatin' Heart,''
``Hey, Good Lookin','' ``Jambalaya,'' ``Settin' the Woods on Fire''
and ``I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,'' his daughter's favorite.
   Yet to be decided, in Alabama, is how Jett Williams shares in
Hank Williams' estate.
   She and Hank Williams Jr. haven't met, but she said she would
like them to meet and talk.
   She wrote the book, published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, ``to
tell the story of the search, frustrations, fighting, losing,
winning, setting the record straight in the court system. To me,
that's the story. That's why I ended the book before I knew about
the money.''
   This spring, Jett went to the Country Music Museum in Nashville
and had Williams' guitar handed to her to play. ``I'd seen a tie of
his and one of his suits behind glass but it was the only thing of
his I'd ever touched.'' She was thrilled.
   In 1949, Hank Williams wrote ``There's Nothin' as Sweet as My
Baby.'' His daughter heard a radio transcription of him introducing
it as ``Ain't Nothin' as Sweet as My Baby.'' She used that as her
book title.
   The lyric includes the description, ``Golden hair and big blue
eyes.''
   ``Of all the songs he wrote, that seemed to be custom made for
me,'' Jett said. ``He wrote it years before I was born but I like
to think he might have daydreamed what it would be like if he had a
little baby girl.''

<TEXT>
   Carly Simon has been working hard these days,
doing everything from singing standards dressed in glamorous gowns
to writing songs to recording two albums, scoring a film and
writing children's books.
   She has a sense of achievement. And she's looking forward to
summer like a kid let out of school.
   Her newest album, ``My Romance,'' has 11 standards, plus a new
song co-written by Simon, ``What Has She Got?'' Arista Records
intends to release it with a record of her own songs that will come
out next fall.
   Some of those, written around her birthday, will be about the
passing of time. It will include ``Fisherman's Song,'' which sounds
like a folk song and has Judy Collins and Lucy Simon singing
backup, and ``Have You Seen Me Lately?'' _ a tune Simon wrote for
Meryl Streep to sing in Mike Nichols' upcoming film ``Postcards
From the Edge.''
   Simon did a Home Box Office special in April, with Harry Connick
Jr. as her guest. He played piano on some songs, and performed some
duets.
   ``We only went through them once and it sounds as if we've been
singing together our whole lives,'' Simon said. ``It was magical.
He's one of the most talented people I've ever met. He sings like
(Frank) Sinatra and plays piano like (Thelonius) Monk.''
   On May 6 she sang a few songs with Connick in his show at the
New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.
   Simon recently watched a video of the one-hour special for the
first time because she had been afraid to watch it. She thought
their duet, ``I Don't Know Why I Love You Like I Do,'' was ``very
sexy.''
   But she was winging it with her on-stage patter. ``I hate
hearing myself; I feel embarrassed. They left them in; they felt it
lends a sort of down-to-earth quality.''
   For the album, she and pianist Michael Kosarin went through
``piles and piles of songs deciding which were best for my voice,''
winding up with six by Richard Rodgers. Then Marty Paich arranged
for orchestra and conducted.
   ``I can't imagine anybody treating those songs more sensitively
and romantically,'' Simon said. The record was made in three days,
four songs a day.
   She spent one week before the HBO special was shown in scoring
``Postcards From the Edge.''
   ``Fortunately, I was able to mobilize everything in my head and
work with a sense of urgency, panic and drama. It was very much
like studying for the exam when you haven't done the work all
semester.
   ``I think I wrote a great song for Meryl to sing opening the
picture. She sings two other songs, `You Don't Know Me,' the old
Ray Charles song, and one Shel Silverstein wrote.''
   The same week she and Doubleday editor Jacqueline Onassis
finished work on her children's book for next Christmas, ``The Boy
of the Bells.'' Her first children's book was ``Amy the Dancing
Bear,'' out for Christmas 1989. ``I'm going to put out one a year
probably for the rest of my life.''
   Her husband, Jim Hart, who can be seen in the audience at the
special, is finishing a novel.
   Sipping a big mug of tea during an interview, Simon talked about
Jackie O.
   ``She had great suggestions; she helped me enormously,'' she
said. ``The thing I love about her is that she didn't want to
`tighten it up' or take any of my personality out of it. The other
thing I feel is that her work thrills her. She doesn't do it dryly
or coldly. She is perfect for an artistic type of person. If I feel
like I'm just taking up somebody's time, I just feel awful.
   ``She didn't do this editing on `Amy.' That landed on her desk
almost perfect. I must have told that 1,000 times to Sarah and Ben.
This I started from scratch on a day in the sun when I felt like
thinking up a new story. It wasn't honed the way `Amy' was.''
   When her children Sarah, called Sally, 15, and Ben, 13, were
young, Simon made up stories for them.
   ``I loved doing it. I very rarely read to them because they
seemed to go to sleep better if all the lights were out,'' she said.
   ``Amy is a budding aritst. That was a story that Sally
particularly loved. Ben was quite angry that I didn't dedicate it
to him as well.'' She dedicated ``The Boy of the Bells,'' a
Christmas story, to him.
   The reason she wrote down Amy and some of her other bedtime
stories wasn't to publish but so she wouldn't forget them. ``I knew
when I had grandchidren the kids would say, `Remember the one you
used to tell about Amy.' My memory would be completely gone by that
time.''
   In her musical future, Simon wants to sing both her own songs
and standards. She wrote ``Fisherman's Song'' in 20 minutes after
coming home late from recording and finding Ben asleep. ``I smelled
his neck and kissed his eyelids, things he doesn't let me do
because he's 13. I translated that to an unrequited love situation.
A girl sneaks into a loved one's house and lies beside him. It
sounds like an old English folk song. It shows another style of
mine I feel equally at home in.''
   Simon made one previous album of standards, ``Torch,'' in 1981.
``Everybody gives Linda Ronstadt credit for having gone back and
done the standards. I always felt jealous she got all the credit
for it.''

   With a wicked smile and a wicked song,
Christopher Mason lampoons the ladies and gents of the upper crust.
   He sings about the foibles, follies and fads of high-powered,
high-society folk like Ivana (Trump), Nancy (Reagan), David
(Rockefeller), Brooke (Astor) and William (Paley). And they love it.
   In less than two years, the sprite-like, 27-year-old Mason has
gone from private party entertainer to budding cabaret star. Now
he's appearing through May at the fabled Oak Room in the Algonquin
Hotel where he's singing not only about people like Mrs. Trump and
her yacht and Mrs. Reagan and her new life in California, but about
such topics as the water shortage and trash TV. He's a combination
of Cole Porter and Tom Lehrer with a bit of Noel Coward thrown in
for good measure.
   ``I write the words and the music. I play the piano and sing,''
Mason explains. ``So if the evening is terrible, it's all my
fault.''
   It was never hard to get Mason to perform. He was born in
England, the son of an opera singer and a civil servant. At the age
of 3, he saw ``The Sound of Music,'' came home, sat down at the
piano and played every song from the show _ with one finger.
   ``I used to drive all of my piano teachers crazy because I'd be
playing Chopin or Beethoven, and I'd always think of what I thought
was a nicer way of finishing a phrase,'' he says, recalling his
precocious childhood.
   At Cambridge, Mason majored in English and art history, but when
he came to New York, he worked long hours for little pay in public
relations and fund-raising. But he got to observe the rich at close
quarters. He also got to attend parties, lots of them.
   ``When there was nothing left to revive a party, I was thrown
toward the piano to play and sing,'' he says. ``People said, `Why
don't you do this all the time?'''
   He finally did. His big break came last May when he was hired by
fashion designer Mario ``the Prince of Chintz'' Buatta to play for
a society dinner at the New York Public Library.
   Mason wrote five new songs for the occasion. ``If you are
burning with the love of learning, write a check to the public
library,'' he crooned in his best fund-raising voice. But he also
wrote songs about Brooke Astor and Annette Reed, two of the biggest
supporters of the library. The ditties suggested that Mrs. Astor
change her first name from Brooke to Book and Mrs. Reed spell her
last name R-e-a-d.
   Mason was a big success, and people began calling to ask if he'd
appear at their parties, playing original songs.
   ``I was terrified of asking for money,'' he says. ``I'm English,
so I'm terrible at dealing with money.''
   At first, Mason would immediately say yes to a job and then ask
about the fee. Often it was less than $500. Today, he has an agent
at William Morris and his price for an evening's work can go as
high as $3,000.
   He serenaded Mrs. Trump last summer aboard the Trump Princess,
her husband's $30 million yacht.
   Mason writes during regular, 9-to-5 office hours, but finds
pressure the best tonic for non-productivity.
   ``The idea of a deadline and a check at the end of it is
irresistible for writing new songs,'' he says.
   Some of his best songs have been born on airplanes and trains.
   For the reopening of Blair House in Washington, Mason wrote a
song about it on a cocktail napkin, while he was flying from New
York to the nation's capital.
   And for his Algonquin engagement, Mason has written different
types of songs.
   ``God knows, not everybody is interested in society's
darlings,'' he says. ``So I've written a love song or two. As well
as one number about the former president called `The Reagans at
Home in Bel Air.'''
   Mason suddenly begins reciting:
   ``The Secret Service is awfully nervous
   ``They can't think what to do.
   ``They are meant to take care of the Reagans
   ``But the Reagans seem awfully blue.
   ``They are finding it hard to adjust to being ordinary folk
   ``And the pressure's not fair.
   ``Though their friends bought them quite a swell house.
   ``It's no fun being the Reagans at home in Bel Air.''
   Mason also is working on a musical called ``How To Bag a
Billionaire,'' a look at today's version of what used to be called
golddiggers, those women who want to marry for money and not
necessarily love.
   ``I'm selfishly writing the whole thing, the book and songs, but
I won't be in it,'' he says.
   The show has been delayed while Mason completes his Algonquin
engagement, and he tries to juggle all his offers from the rich and
the famous.
   ``I find myself now invited to all the big parties _ the
serious, social parties, which is a peculiar thing,'' Mason says.
``I spend time with these people. They must be aware that I am
watching them every second to see how they are behaving. Maybe
people think they are flirting with danger in a very acceptable way
by having me around.''

   Playwright August Wilson on Thursday captured
his second Pulitzer Prize for drama in four years when he was
honored with the 1990 award for ``The Piano Lesson.''
   Oscar Hijuelos' book, ``The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,''
won the 1990 Pulitzer for fiction. Hijuelos' novel detailed the
lives of three brothers from Havana who become minor celebrities as
musicians in New York nightclubs.
   ``I had no idea it was even being announced this week,''
Hijuelos, a Manhattan resident, said in a telephone interview from
a friend's house in Ulster County.
   ``I wasn't sitting around chewing on my nails. I came up here to
really cool out. Now, I may have to turn around and drive back into
the city. But worse things can happen.''
   It was only the second novel written by Hijuelos. Pultizer
Administrator Robert Christopher said he believed Hijuelos was the
first Hispanic winner of the Pulitzer for fiction.
   Stanley Karnow's book, ``In Our Image: America's Empire in the
Philippines,'' won for history. Karnow is a long-time foreign
correspondent for several news organizations. He also wrote
``Vietnam: A History,'' which later won six Emmy Awards in its
television incarnation.
   The Pulitzer for general non-fiction went to ``And Their
Children After Them'' by Dale Maharidge and Michael Williamson.
Maharidge is a reporter and Williamson a photographer for The
Sacramento (Calif.) Bee.
   Their book was a 50-year follow-up on the descendants of three
tenant families in Alabama who were made famous by James Agee and
Walker Evans in the book, ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.''
   ``Machiavelli In Hell'' by Sebastian de Grazia won the biography
Pulitzer. The Chicago native has been a Rutgers University
professor of political philosophy since 1962.
   Charles Simic's ``The World Doesn't End'' won for poetry. The
Stratford, N.H., resident had been nominated for a Pulitzer once
before for his ``Selected Poems: 1953-83.''
   The Pulitzer for music went to ``Duplicates: A Concerto for Two
Pianos and Orchestra'' by jazz and classical pianist Mel Powell.
   Powell, 67, started playing with the Benny Goodman Orchestra as
a teen-ager, later joining the Glenn Miller Air Force band. He
currently heads the composition faculty at the California Institute
of the Arts.
   Wilson's ``The Piano Lesson,'' which takes place in Pittsburgh
in 1936, concerns a sharecropper who wants to buy the land his
grandfather worked on as a slave and is willing to sell the family
heirloom, a piano, to pay for it.
   The play, which was one of the finalists last year, opens Monday
on Broadway. Wilson won in 1987 for ``Fences.''
   The prizes, recognizing outstanding work in journalism and the
arts, are awarded by Columbia University. Pulitzer winners receive
$3,000 in each category.

   Julius Lester has written 19 books, many for
children. His early works include a paean hymn to black power. His
latest book, ``Lovesong,'' caused an academic uproar and his exile
from the Afro-American studies department at the University of
Massachusetts.

<TEXT>
   Julius Lester wrote the book on black
power in 1968 with a title he meant to be funny: ``Look Out,
Whitey! Black Power's Gon' Get Your Mama!''
   The title, however, was taken seriously by at least one
newspaper, which headlined the story: ``White Mamas in Danger, Says
Black Militant.''
   That same year Lester was branded an anti-Semite for having a
teacher read a student's poem on his radio show, beginning: ``Hey,
Jew boy, with that yarmulke on your head@You pale-faced Jew boy _ I
wish you were dead.''
   Twenty years later, the maverick Lester is again provoking
controversy, much of it related to his conversion to Judaism.
   ``There's a feeling among some that by becoming a Jew I am now
to be considered a traitor to black people,'' said Lester, 49.
``I've had black people say to me that they don't consider me to be
black, which is news to me, since I look in the mirror and very
clearly I'm black.''
   The man who was once, in his own words, ``anathema to Jews'' now
exchanges his cowboy hat on Saturdays for a skullcap and prayer
shawl and leads a conservative synagogue in song.
   ``There's a kind of intellectual climate in black America today
that really demands a conformity of thought,'' he says. ``If you
are critical of certain things, Jesse Jackson for example, then
people really treat you like a pariah.''
   Ironically, his book about his conversion, ``Lovesong,'' has
made him anathema to another group, the Afro-American studies
department at the University of Massachusetts, where he has taught
for 17 years.
   In the book, published in February, Lester accused writer James
Baldwin of making anti-Semitic remarks in a 1984 lecture. But
Lester refused to debate the matter with members of the
Afro-American studies department who said he was misinformed about
the speech.
   Colleagues saw the charge as pernicious and called Lester, in a
preface to a transcript of Baldwin's speech that they sent him, an
``anti-Negro Negro ... seeking compulsively to slay the
birth-people enemy who exist in his malicious and unforgiving
imagination.''
   ``He will blow in any wind that comes,'' says Michael Thelwell,
who recruited Lester into the department in 1971. Thelwell was
among 15 department members who signed a letter suggesting Lester
would be ``infinitely more comfortable'' elsewhere.
   At the center of the storm is a lanky, long-faced man who loves
playing pool, baking loaves of hallah for Sabbath dinners and
collecting stamps with the youngest of his four children, David, 9.
   ``I guess I just don't care that much about how I appear to
others,'' he says, sitting cross-legged by a field where David
plays ball. ``What's important to me is, whom does God see when God
looks at me?''
   The writings that land Lester in such hot water are only a
sideline to his teaching, he says. His classes are always
over-booked and he is the only faculty member to have earned the
university's top three teaching awards.
   He also is studying to be a cantor and writes children's books,
which make up more than half of the 19 books he has written so far.
His latest project is the fourth volume of the retelling of Joel
Chandler Harris's ``The Tales of Uncle Remus'' in a modern dialect.
   ``A lot of people just know me for children's books,'' he says,
chuckling.
   Lester was born in 1939 to a Methodist minister who was a pillar
of black parishes in Tennessee and Kansas and who would race away
from a gas station rather than accept the services of a white man
who called him ``boy.''
   Lester's great-grandfather was a Jewish immigrant from Germany
who married an ex-slave in the late 1800s and built a house that
stood apart from both the white and black neighborhoods of Pine
Bluff, Ark.
   In his will, his great-grandfather pledged his love to his wife
and wrote that he considered her ``my true and honest wife''
despite the anti-miscegenation laws of the time.
   Lester grew up a model minister's son, learning the Bible better
than some of his teachers.
   As a child, he was fascinated with ``Kol Nidre,'' a Hebrew
melody played on the eve of Yom Kippur, and with Shakespeare's
Shylock in ``The Merchant of Venice.'' He later wrote that he
identified with Shylock in ways he could not with black leaders.
   Lester graduated from Fisk University in 1960 and headed for New
York. Even then, the lure of Judaism was strong. Although Lester,
who has been married twice to whites, made a living as a folk
singer, the black spirituals he played failed to move him as
powerfully as Jewish songs did.

   When tango fans call 84-year-old
composer and pianist Osvaldo Pugliese ``the master,'' it is a
tribute to the man and the musician.
   A composer, arranger, pianist and band leader, Pugliese has
recorded hundreds of songs. His own classics include ``Recuerdo''
(``Memory'') and ``Malandraca'' (``Ruffians'').
   In August, his band of 12 musicians and two singers celebrated
its 50th anniversary. There were two performances to accommodate
all the fans. The following month, the band toured Holland and
Belgium. Last year, it played for two months in Japan.
   Pugliese fans say tango may be divided into before and after
``Recuerdo,'' a tune he wrote in 1924 that featured bandoleon riffs
which elevated the accordian-like instrument from the periphery to
the heart of the music.
   At the time, Pugliese was 19 - too young to legally register the
song in his own name. So his father, a leather cutter in a shoe
factory and an amateur flutist, took credit.
   Pugliese's signature piece, ``Yumba,'' was first performed in
1946. It showcases his distinctive style of a simple melody, a
one-three beat and the violent stops and starts of the instruments
- bandoleon, piano, violin and cello - that get feet tapping and
hearts pounding.
   In comparison, tango's other main exponent, bandoleonist and
composer Astor Piazzolla, revels in complex scores that are meant
to be listened to rather than danced. Sixty-nine and in poor
health, he acquired his own legion of fans by fusing tango and jazz
rhythms, and experimenting with instruments such as the clarinet
and the vibraphone. His followers compose songs on computers and
play them on electric guitars.
   But there's more to Pugliese than music. He's a communist who
never renounced his beliefs, a labor leader punished for promoting
workers' rights, a government critic who refused the safety of
exile, a factory worker's son who won fame but never turned his
back on his roots.
   The grade-school dropout and self-taught pianist also is a
forgiving man who accepted public apologies from President Gen.
Juan Peron and others who threw him in jail and denied him work
over four decades.
   ``His music is great because the man is a giant in every sense
of the word,'' Isidoro Gilbert wrote in the prologue to a 1985
book-length interview of Pugliese. ``He is the high priest of
tango, the soul of the city.''
   ``Pugliese is one of the few people who represent something
special about Buenos Aires,'' said theater promoter Lino Patalano.
``You will never hear anyone say a single bad word about him.''
   Pugliese's story is well known in this South American capital
where tango was born a century ago in bars and brothels by the
docks, and thrives today in nightclubs, dance halls and, when
Pugliese plays, theaters that seat several thousand.
   Jailed or barred from performing more times than he can
remember, Pugliese once persuaded a jailer to enroll in the
Communist Party. In 1961, he composed ``Milonga Para Fidel'' for
Cuban leader Fidel Castro.
   During his enforced absences, Pugliese's orchestra would place a
red rose atop his black piano. The words, ``Tango Is Prisoner, Free
Osvaldo Pugliese,'' would appear as graffiti on the downtown
Obelisk, symbol of the city.
   In 1936, he helped found the Argentine Musicians Union so
colleagues might get a greater share of proceeds from concerts and
recordings. He still splits earnings with his band, and is not a
wealthy man.
   ``I enjoy good health and many friends,'' he said with a smile
at Tango House, a foundation he helped set up to promote the music.
He often can be found at the two-story building, playing truco (a
card game), sipping mate (bitter tea) and telling jokes in lunfardo
(Buenos Aires slang).
   Success seemed unlikely for Pugliese. He dropped out of school
after fourth grade and hired on as a printer's apprentice, learning
to play the piano on the side.
   But he had a natural gift and tremendous yearning. By age 14, he
was helping family finances by playing piano from 6 p.m. until 1
a.m. in cabarets. And practicing, practicing, always practicing.
   Asked his secret of composition, he once said, ``These things
just come out in an instant. ... They appeared in my head, they
appeared in my heart and, bruuuuuum, I wrote it.''
   At 84, Pugliese is hard of hearing, physically frail and sees
the world through thick lenses. But the passing of years has not
weakened his cheery good nature, unbreakable spirit or his touch.
   At his anniversary performance, the notes were clear and his
left-hand mightily swept down the keys. Between songs, he chatted
with fans who shouted out tunes they wanted to hear next.
   ``One thing surprised me,'' he said afterward. ``When I
finished, everyone was quiet and, I thought, asleep or bored? Then
came the applause. I almost had a heart attack.''

JAZZ
by Toni Morrison
Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 229 pages
PLAYING IN THE DARK
by Toni Morrison
Harvard Univ. Press Pounds 11.95, 91 pages
TONI MORRISON'S fifth novel, Beloved, which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1988,
explored the immediate psychological aftermath of slavery in the US during
the post-Civil War Reconstruction era. Conceived as a sequel, Jazz is set in
Harlem in 1926 among the burgeoning community of African-Americans who fled
north after emancipation to escape landlessness and lynchings.
While the novel's unnamed narrator hymns 'the City' in confiding, colloquial
tones, relaying snatches of melody from street-corner musicians and
ubiquitous Victrolas, the Jazz Age and the Harlem Renaissance are only
obliquely evoked. Jazz is present principally as a motif, signalling a new
freedom and sensuality alongside an overwhelming compulsion to forget. 'Here
comes the new. Look out. There goes the sad stuff. The bad stuff . . .
Forget that. History is over, you all, and everything's ahead at last.'
The vision proves illusory for Joe Trace, a door-to-door beauty produce
salesman and his wife Violet, who arrived from Virginia 20 years earlier on
a 'dancing train'. The novel begins as Joe has shot dead his young lover,
Dorcas, whose face Violet has attempted to slash with a knife at the
funeral. It is the complex motivations behind this melodrama that unfold
through the fragmented narrative, with its shifting viewpoints and its
flashbacks to the south, of families dispossessed, houses burned, men hanged
and mothers absent or suicidal.
Through Morrison's fictional 're-remembering' of forgotten black histories
she suggests the delusory nature of free action where the determining demons
of the past have been neither exhumed nor exorcised. The music that
expresses freedom's 'sweet desolation' also contains a 'complicated anger',
disguised as 'flourish and roaring seduction', that can trigger
self-destruction.
Yet, in a narrative twist, Jazz reaffirms the possibility of freedom, of
transcending rather than succumbing to the past as 'an abused record with no
choice but to repeat itself at the crack'. In place of the sensational
events initially promised the reader, Joe and Violet opt for a healing, even
cloying, reconciliation, for 'figuring things out'. The storyteller
confesses both her power and her inadequacy, her characters having been
'busy being original, complicated, changeable, human . . . putting their
lives together in ways I never dreamed of'.
While Jazz displays Morrison's supreme ability to illuminate social process
and the sweep of history through character, those seeking the emotional
authority of Beloved or the visionary intensity of The Bluest Eye, Sula or
Song of Solomon, are likely to be disappointed in Jazz's preoccupation with
its own construction; the self-consciousness of the telling has perhaps been
at the expense of the tale
Morrison, a revered chronicler of the African-American experience, in a
collection of essays on the work of white American writers, challenges
'American Africanism': the 'disabling virus' of myths, stereotypes and
misconceptions of African peoples, to which her own fiction is a powerful
antidote. In Playing in the Dark she argues that, just as the
Enlightenment's concept of freedom was parasitical on the reality of
slavery, the rights of man yoked inevitably to the assumption of racial
hierarchy, the concerns of a nascent American literature were shaped by the
white relationship to a 'dark, abiding, signing Africanist presence'.
Developed with illustrations from Poe, Twain, Melville, Hemingway and
others, Morrison's argument provocatively extends critiques of colonial
literature (notably Edward Said's Orientalism, or the Nigerian Chinua
Achebe's dissection of Conrad) to white American writing in its relation to
its own subordinate black population. In doing so, she challenges the
'universalist' or 'race-free' pretensions of a literature whose habitual
resort to shorthand constructions of blackness marks it out as the product
of white writers with an assumed white readership.
More crucially, her sombre conclusion that racism 'is as healthy as it was
during the Enlightenment', its utility as a metaphor having outstripped its
ideological purpose in justifying economic exploitation, lays down a
challenge to others to share her own project as a writer: to 'free-up' the
language from the 'sinister, lazy, predictable racial codes' that pervade
and impoverish it.

AARON COPLAND DIES; MUSIC FOUND THE AMERICAN MOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aaron Copland, who sought a recognizable American sound in serious music and 
was considered the nation's finest living composer, died Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
He died in Phelps Memorial Hospital in Westchester, N. Y. only two weeks after 
his 90th birthday, an occasion noted with celebrations and tributes from 
throughout the land. 
</P>
<P>
He had suffered two strokes and died of the complications from them, said his 
attorney, Ellis Freedman. 
</P>
<P>
Copland's true achievement, concert pianist Samuel Lipman once observed, was 
not the composer's use of rhythm, harmony, counterpoint or inventive structure, 
but his ability to evoke through melody the "mood of America" from the Civil 
War to World War II. 
</P>
<P>
Copland, wrote the esteemed pianist, "catches the emptiness of the city and the 
quiet of the land. He has succeeded in fixing in the mind of a large public an 
aural image of what America, and therefore American music, sounds like." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other serious composers, the Brooklyn-born Copland did not spurn writing 
for the masses, although many of his works were abstract and some could be 
attempted by only the most skilled musicians. Compositions such as "Piano 
Variations" were not meant for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
(In 1928, during his first trip to the West, Copland heard another of his 
keyboard pieces, "Piano Concerto" with its frequently changing rhythms, hissed 
during rehearsal and again in concert at the Hollywood Bowl.) 
</P>
<P>
But the sweep of his honors attests to his wide appeal. They included a 
Pulitzer Prize, a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Guggenheim Foundation's 
first music fellowship and an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
"He was the composer who would lead American music out of the wilderness," 
Leonard Bernstein wrote in High Fidelity magazine for the occasion of Copland's 
70th birthday. "He was The Leader, the one to whom the young always came with 
their compositions." 
</P>
<P>
Early in his career, when he searched jazz and folk songs as well as Latin 
rhythms to find new musical forms, he was considered by many too avant-garde 
for the concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
He reached a wide audience with his ballet compositions: "Billy the Kid," 
"Rodeo" and "Appalachian Spring," the last written for dancer Martha Graham. 
</P>
<P>
His "Fanfare for the Common Man" became an anthem played around the world and 
was heard in such disparate places as the opening ceremony of the 1984 Summer 
Olympics in Los Angeles and the 1981 inauguration of Ronald Reagan in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
He did not consider himself above writing background music for films -- "Of 
Mice and Men," "Our Town," "North Star" and "The Red Pony" -- and for several 
years that work provided his main source of income. 
</P>
<P>
His Academy Award came for the score for William Wyler's 1949 "The Heiress." 
</P>
<P>
Copland, the youngest of five children of Russian Jewish immigrants, did not 
begin taking formal piano lessons until he was 12 or 13 and it was not until he 
was 15 that, he said, "the idea of becoming a composer seems gradually to have 
dawned upon me." 
</P>
<P>
That was an advanced age for a future professional composer to begin training, 
it was noted by Copland biographer Arthur Berger, "but his determination was 
such that things went rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
After studying piano with various teachers and learning composition under Rubin 
Goldmark, who believed some of his pupil's efforts mere "modern experiments," 
20-year-old Copland went to France to enroll in a new music school for 
Americans at Fontainebleau. 
</P>
<P>
He could afford to go there, Berger pointed out, because his immigrant father 
had a department store in New York and young Copland drew a "nice allowance" to 
supplement what he had earned working in the store and as a runner on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
At Fontainebleau, Copland met harmony teacher Nadia Boulanger and was 
overwhelmed by what he said was her enthusiasm and "clarity in teaching." He 
became the first of several noted American composers who studied under her. 
</P>
<P>
In post-World War I Paris, where Copland went to study with Boulanger, he found 
himself caught up in the excitement over the experimenting European composers 
-- Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel, Bela Bartok and Arnold Schoenberg. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote a one-act ballet, "Grohg," from which he later extracted three 
movements to form his "Dance Symphony," subsequently winning with it a $5,000 
prize in a 1930 contest sponsored by RCA Victor Co. 
</P>
<P>
It was during his three years in France, Copland said later, that he became 
aware that French music sounded distinctly French. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't understand why we in America couldn't create serious music which 
people would recognize as typically American," he told an interviewer before 
his 80th birthday, "particularly since the jazz boys and the ragtime fellows 
had succeeded in doing it." 
</P>
<P>
He made up his mind to write serious music that would reflect America's 
diversity and somehow capture the national character. 
</P>
<P>
When he returned to the United States at 23, Copland earned his living for a 
time playing in a Milford, Pa., hotel trio -- while writing for Boulanger a 
"Symphony for Organ and Orchestra" she was to perform with conductor Walter 
Damrosch and the New York Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the initial performance, which was not very successful by all 
accounts, Damrosch told the audience: "If a young man at the age of 23 can 
write a symphony like that, in five years he will be ready to commit murder." 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear what Damrosch meant, but at a time when modern composers were 
regarded as doing little more than trying to shock the public, he may have felt 
that Copland's talent could bring him intense frustration. 
</P>
<P>
A month later, the Boston Symphony Orchestra performed Copland's symphony. Its 
conductor, Russian-born Serge Koussevitsky, was so enthusiastic about the young 
composer that he asked him to write a chamber orchestra piece to be performed 
at a League of Composers concert. 
</P>
<P>
Copland decided he had drawn upon European influences too much for his 
symphony, so he drew upon the jazz idiom for "Music for the Theatre." 
Biographer Berger observed that Copland, with his superb training, could 
utilize advanced harmonies that were beyond George Gershwin. 
</P>
<P>
Although the league concert audience took "Music for the Theatre" in stride, 
the general symphony public did not. 
</P>
<P>
Berger wrote that "a veritable cabal was formed against the work . . . among 
staid Boston listeners, some of whom claimed that such music had no place in 
Symphony Hall and that Koussevitsky had given it with disguised malice, namely 
as a foreigner who wanted to show how bad American music is." 
</P>
<P>
In a 1975 New York Times interview, Copland recalled the difficulties of trying 
to write serious music that would appeal to a larger public without alienating 
those willing to accept only traditional forms. 
</P>
<P>
He told of fellow composer Roy Harris, who "was interested in writing big, 
serious symphonies in the Sibelius vein," being aghast at the jazz-flavored 
work Copland was writing for the Boston Symphony. Copland told the interviewer: 
</P>
<P>
"I remember him jumping up and holding his head between his hands and shouting, 
'My God, it's whorehouse music! It's whorehouse music!' " 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, it was at the time of this brouhaha that Copland became the first 
composer to win a Guggenheim Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
By 1927, he decided he had done as much as he could with jazz and he went on to 
a new phase, producing "Piano Variations," "Short Symphony" and "Statements." 
</P>
<P>
They were difficult to perform or to understand. Critics noted that Copland was 
using dissonance, irregular rhythms and unmelodic themes. He had become a 
leading figure in modern music. 
</P>
<P>
Copland, however, was increasingly uncomfortable with the failure of composers 
to reach the music-loving public. 
</P>
<P>
So Copland went to a new style, composing and orchestrating by 1936 "El Salon 
Mexico," based on Mexican melodies. It was an immediate success. 
</P>
<P>
As he sought a broader audience and the true American musical idiom, Copland 
drew upon such folk sources as cowboy songs, New England hymns and Shaker 
melodies. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote a play-opera for high school performance, "The Second Hurricane," as 
well as incidental music for two plays and even a puppet show that was 
presented at the 1939 New York World's Fair. 
</P>
<P>
His three major ballets were responsible for most of his fame. "Appalachian 
Spring" won him the 1944 Pulitzer Prize for music as well as the New York Music 
Critics' Award as the outstanding theatrical composition for 1944-45. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote music especially commissioned for radio performance and composed for 
films without, the critics said, sinking to the level of many Hollywood scores. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Arthur Berger wrote, Copland "exerted an influence on some of the 
resident, routine composers there and helped raise the general standards." 
</P>
<P>
In writing about Copland, pianist Lipman observed that "notwithstanding this 
opening to the masses," the composer already had resumed his interest in more 
abstract music with "Piano Sonata," "Sonata for Violin and Piano" and his 
"Third Symphony." 
</P>
<P>
The last was called by Koussevitsky "the greatest American symphony" and was 
the New York Music Critics' choice for the best orchestral piece of the 1946-47 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Copland's career also included his work as a performer of his own music and as 
a conductor -- both in concert and on recordings. 
</P>
<P>
He wrote three books: "Our New Music," "What to Listen for in Music" and "Music 
and Imagination." He also wrote articles for various magazines while others 
wrote several books and hundreds of articles about him. 
</P>
<P>
Copland was celebrated at length and interviewed often at the time of his 80th 
birthday in 1980, three years after his last composition "Midsummer Nocturne." 
He was living, as he had for years, in a rambling hilltop house overlooking the 
Hudson River at Peekskill, N. Y. 
</P>
<P>
His 90th birthday was marked by concerts and tributes stretching across the 
country. But this time his health was too frail for interviews or even comment. 
</P>
<P>
He never married and lived alone with his grand piano, stacks of music 
manuscript, dog and cat. A housekeeper, a cook and a secretary attended to his 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my hideaway, my solitude," he told one reporter many years ago. "You 
know what the composer's life is like in Manhattan. The telephone is always 
ringing, people are always dropping in. You are expected to go places and take 
part. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a matter of keeping yourself free from interruptions."

<TEXT>
   The Charlotte Observer's dogged coverage of the
PTL financial scandal, scorned by Jim and Tammy Bakker and many
readers, earned the Pulitzer Prize for public service, journalism's
highest honor.
   In the arts, Toni Morrison's novel of a former slave,
``Beloved,'' won the Pulitzer for fiction, a category closely
watched after the book failed to win two other prestigious awards
for which it was nominated.
   Alfred Uhry's first non-musical play, ``Driving Miss Daisy,''
won the drama prize and Richard Rhodes was awarded the non-fiction
prize for his book, ``The Making of the Atomic Bomb.''
   The Charlotte Observer, The Wall Street Journal and the Miami
Herald each won two awards.
   The Knight-Ridder newspaper group won six in all, with the
Observer's two, the Herald's two and one each for the Philadelphia
Inquirer and the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch. A total of 21
Pulitzers were awarded Thursday for achievement in the arts and
journalism.
   The Observer revealed misuse of funds by the PTL ministry
``through persistent coverage conducted in the face of a massive
campaign by PTL to discredit the newspaper,'' the Pulitzer board
said.
   The Observer's Managing Editor Mark Ethridge III said the real
reward was winning over readers who had denounced the newspaper's
efforts.
   ``The thing that gratifies us the most of all about PTL are the
folks who have written us and said, `Two years ago, I wrote you and
said you all were going to hell. ... Now, I want to say I'm wrong
and keep up the reporting,''' Ethridge said.
   The paper won the public service award in 1981 for its coverage
of ``brown lung'' among textile workers.
   The Miami Herald's Michel duCille won the feature photography
prize for photographs of the decay and rehabilitation of a housing
project inundated by the drug crack. He also won a prize for spot
news photography two years ago.
   The Herald's humor columnist, Dave Barry, won the prize for
commentary for his ``consistently effective use of humor as a
device for presenting fresh insights into serious concerns.''
   ``It's fun to win a Pulitzer, everybody should do it,'' Barry
said.
   The Wall Street Journal's two prizes came in explanatory
journalism and specialized reporting.
   The paper's Daniel Hertzberg and James B. Stewart won for
stories about an investment banker charged with insider trading and
about the day after the October stock market crash. Walt Bogdanich
won the specialized reporting prize for a series on faulty testing
by medical laboratories.
   Winners generally sounded giddy.
   ``Several people in the newsroom just took a champagne bath,''
said Jacqui Banaszynski of the St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch, who
won the prize in feature writing for her series on an AIDS victim
in a farm community.
   ``There was a lot of dancing and yelling and singing when the
announcement came over the wire _ but that's not unusual for the
Journal newsroom,'' said Jim Tharpe, managing editor of the Alabama
Journal in Montgomery, which won in general news for its
investigation of the state's unusually high infant mortality rate.
   The Lawrence (Mass.) Eagle-Tribune also won in general news for
stories that showed flaws in the Massachusetts prison furlough
system.
   Tom Shales of the Washington Post won the criticism award for
his writings on television.
   Ms. Morrison acknowledged the controversy surrounding her book
after it failed to win the National Book Award and the National
Book Critics Circle Award last fall. In January, 48 black writers
and critics signed an open letter deploring the lack of national
recognition of her book.
   But the chairman of the Pulitzer fiction jury, Rutgers
University professor Julian Moynahan, said jurors made their
recommendations six weeks before the letter was published and felt
no pressure to recommend Ms. Morrison's book.
   ``I am glad that the merits of the book were allowed to surface
and be the only consideration of the Pulitzer Prize committee,''
Morrison said.
   Other awards in journalism:
   _ National reporting, to Tim Weiner of the Inquirer for a series
on a secret Pentagon budget used to sponsor defense research and an
arms buildup. He was part of a Kansas City Times and Kansas City
Star team that won a Pulitzer in 1982 for general news reporting.
   _ Investigative reporting, to the Chicago Tribune's Dean Baquet,
William Gaines and Ann Marie Lipinski for stories on ``the
self-interest and waste that plagued Chicago's City Council.''
   _ International reporting, to Thomas L. Friedman of The New York
Times for what the Pulitzer board termed ``balanced and informed
coverage of Israel.'' _ Editorial writing, to Jane Healy of The
Orlando Sentinel for editorials that protested overdevelopment of
Florida's Orange County.
   _ Editorial cartooning, to Doug Marlette of the Atlanta
Constitution and the Charlotte Observer.
   _ Spot news photography, to Scott Shaw of the Odessa (Texas)
American for his pictures of little Jessica McClure being rescued
from the well into which she had fallen.
   Other arts awards included:
   _ History, ``The Launching of Modern American Science
1846-1876,'' by Robert V. Bruce.
   _ Biography, ``Look Homeward: A Life of Thomas Wolfe,'' by David
Herbert Donald.
   _ Poetry, ``Partial Accounts: New and Selected Poems,'' by
William Meredith.
   _ Music, ``12 Etudes for Piano,'' by William Bolcom.
   Winners are selected by the Pulitzer board, which is guided by,
but not obligated to restrict itself to, a series of finalists
submitted by nominating juries in the various categories.
   Except for the award for public service, which brings with it a
gold medal, Pulitzers carry a cash prize of $3,000. The winners are
announced by the president of Columbia University, which
administers the competition.

   It requires a special talent to take an obscure
wedding dance by Edvard Grieg and turn it into a Hit Parade smash
like ``Strange Music'' or transform the exotic themes of Borodin
into songs like ``Stranger in Paradise'' and ``Baubles, Bangles and
Beads.''
   For much of their careers, George Forrest and Robert Wright have
used that talent, adapting someone else's music, usually a
classical composer, and spinning it into something new.
   They did it in Hollywood, working on dozens of films like
``Maytime,'' ``Sweethearts'' and ``I Married an Angel,'' and on
Broadway with shows like ``Song of Norway,'' ``Magdalena'' and
``Kismet.''
   ``Writing original music is 10 or 20 times easier than the
things for which we are best known,'' Wright was saying the other
day. ``The first thing you have to do as an adapter is learn
everything a composer ever wrote. Then you have to assemble and
assimilate the music. And finally, think the way he did.''
   At 75, Wright is the talkative member of the songwriting team.
Forrest, one year younger, nods in agreement. Their partnership has
lasted some 60 years. It began at Miami Senior High School where
they wrote their first song _ ``Hail to Miami High!'' _ and has
continued into the present. Their latest musical, ``Grand Hotel,''
currently is on view at the Martin Beck Theater.
   ``Grand Hotel,'' directed and choreographed by Tommy Tune,
focuses on the guests at a large luxury hotel in Berlin. It's based
on the 1920s best-selling Vicki Baum novel that later became a
successful movie starring Greta Garbo and John Barrymore.
   The musical, using an original Wright and Forrest score, takes
place in 1928, a year its composer and lyricist remember very well.
   ``We were both working musicians by that time,'' Wright says.
   ``I had won an amateur contest playing the Rachmaninoff `C Sharp
Minor Prelude' when I was 9 and went into vaudeville. I found out
very young that there was money in music, so I never touched the
piano unless I was paid.
   ``I played for Helen Morgan, Leonard Rose and Sally Rand, all in
the same year. I think it was 1933.''
   Two years later, at ages 21 and 20, Wright and Forrest went to
Hollywood and found work at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., the studio
associated with the classiest of the movie musicals. They were
signed to write original music and lyrics. But the team found
little work until a disaster nearly derailed a film version of
Sigmund Romberg's ``Maytime,'' starring Nelson Eddy and Jeanette
MacDonald.
   Irving Thalberg, the legendary producer, died with only half the
film musical completed. A new director started over, and Wright and
Forrest were assigned to come up with new musical material. Much of
it was taken from music already in the public domain, pieces like
Tchaikovsky's ``Fifth Symphony'' and pieces of operas. The movie
was a big success, and Wright and Forrest stayed in Hollywood for
seven years, participating in some 50 movies, often anonymously.
   ``We worked on anything they asked,'' Wright says. ``You're
slaves in Hollywood, very happy slaves, but they owned us body and
soul. We always did our very best and worked as artistically as we
possibly could.''
   Finally, they quit. Herbert Stothart, MGM's famous musical
director and their mentor, told them: ``They'll keep you forever.
People will never know who you are.''
   Before they left they wrote a small musical revue called ``Thank
You, Columbus,'' that opened _ and closed _ in Los Angeles. But
through it, they met producer Edwin Lester who vowed to put on
their next show.
   ``Once you write anything for the stage and you put it in front
of an audience and you hear them react, then the movies become very
dreary and dull,'' Wright says.
   The team traveled to New York to write for cabaret, nightclubs
and radio. The work included special club material for performers
like Jimmy Durante, Ella Logan, Sophie Tucker, Joe E. Lewis, Jane
Froman and Carmen Miranda.
   Lester reappeared in their lives in 1944, with an idea for a
stage musical based on the life of Edvard Grieg, using the
composer's own melodies. The idea became ``Song of Norway.'' It was
a big success for Lester in California, and he brought it to New
York where it ran for over two years.
   Lester also was responsible for ``Kismet,'' the team's other big
New York hit. This musical, a sort of Broadway meets the Arabian
Nights, won them a Tony Award in 1954. Besides ``Stranger in
Paradise'' and ``Baubles, Bangles and Beads,'' the songs included
``This Is My Beloved'' and ``Rhymes Have I.''
   The musical version of ``Grand Hotel'' has had a 20-year
history. It began in 1958 with Luther Davis who adapted the book
for the great Yiddish comedian Menasha Skulnik. It was called ``At
the Grand.''
   But by th time the musical went into production, it starred Paul
Muni and Joan Diener. Muni got sick, and the musical never got
beyond tryouts in Los Angeles and San Francisco.
   Two years ago, Davis resurrected the idea and took it to Wright
and Forrest.
   He told them, ``I would like to start all over again and really
do Vicki Baum's novel,'' Wright recalls. ``Our other version was
set in Rome and was about movies and opera. We went back to the
original.''
   Wright and Forrest began reworking their score, and Davis
extensively revised the book.
   ``The most important part of a musical is the book, not the
music and lyrics,'' Wright says. ``Once the book tells a story that
is interesting, then the music and lyrics have something to say. Up
until then, they are just songs.''
   ``The book is more important because most of the critics are
literary critics; they are not music critics,'' Forrest adds.
``What they criticize is the book.''
   At ages when most people have been retired for a decade, Wright
and Forrest keep writing.
   They are revising ``The Anastasia Game,'' a new version of their
1965 musical ``Anya,'' which recently had a production in
Massachusetts, and working on ``Uncle Daniel,'' a musical based on
the Eudora Welty novella ``The Ponder Heart.''
   ``You can't stop working,'' Wright says.
   ``Besides, most of our working consists of sitting and
thinking,'' Forrest adds. ``You sit and you wish.''

   It's been months since Oscar Hijuelos has looked
at his novel, ``The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love,'' a nominee for
the National Book Award.
   He remembers love scenes and music, but certain passages have
slipped his mind; picking up the book again will be like reading it
for the first time.
   It always works that way. Faces of old friends become blurred
over the years. Listen to your favorite song 100 times and a note
or turn of phrase will still surprise you. Only the most fanatical
Lucy fan can anticipate every joke.
   Memory, music, ``I Love Lucy'' _ they all matter in ``The Mambo
Kings Plays Songs of Love'' (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $18.95), in
which Desi Arnaz briefly drops in on the world of brothers Cesar
and Nestor Castillo, and to their astonishment, transports them to
the living room of Lucy and Ricky Ricardo.
   ``Arnaz was always one of the essential, successful Cubans,''
said Hijuelos, the son of Cuban immigrants. ``He didn't have a down
image. When you think about how Latins are portrayed in the media,
even today, they're either hoods or they're cops.
   ``He was a middle-class man, very successful. He had a
whacked-out life, but he had a real relationship, a real life, and
that image really enchanted me. He also a slight melancholic
streak. He had a lot of qualities that I related to.''
   Try to remember this ``I Love Lucy'' episode: Two Cuban
brothers, old friends of Ricky's, arrive at the apartment one day.
They exchange chitchat with the Ricardos, and later appear at the
Tropicana, crooning ``Beautiful Maria of My Soul'' with the
bandleader himself joining the brothers on stage. (Lucy, naturally,
is upset because she wanted to appear in the show instead).
   Sound familiar? Well, it never really happened, but that's the
point. ``Mambo Kings'' is a song of invented memory, a mournful
melody of events distorted by nostalgia and loss.
   ``The one thing you don't lose is memory, and memory nags you,''
Hijuelos said. ``Look at Jewish writers who write about things that
have happened, internally things go around and around and around.
   ``If you're hung up on the past you can't move forward. Nestor
tries to get courage from the American notion of discarding the
past and move forward.''
   Loss of youth, love and country run through ``Mambo Kings.'' In
the late 1940s, Carlos _ gregarious and ambitious _ and Nestor _
moody and romantic _ arrive in New York as aspiring mambo
musicians. The end comes 30 years later, in a rundown hotel room
where Carlos drinks himself to death.
   Women inspire their songs and their songs inspire women. Love
affairs for Carlos are as intense, and short-lived, as the latest
dance craze. For Nestor, heartbreak is timeless, a haunting ballad
undiminished by repeated listenings.
   And memories of home are inescapable for both Castillos. No
amount of rum, women and song can replace their simple, easygoing
life in Cuba.
   ``I think most immigrants are basically homesick,'' Hijuelos
said. ``You can't imagine losing something like your country unless
you've really lost it. It's just a dream of something lost, which
you can never really retrieve.
   ``You meet Cubans in Miami who have made a million bucks, but
they will never have what they had before.''
   Hijuelos was born in 1951 and grew up on 118th Street on
Manhattan's Upper West Side, a neighborhood remembered in his first
novel, ``Our House in the Last World,'' published in 1985.
   He first wanted to be a musician, but was turned off by the rock
'n' roll drug scene and drifted into writing in his mid-20s.
Hijuelos nearly quit that as well, finding authors no more
appealing than rock stars.
   ``I went to a writers conference in 1978 and I found it the most
sexist, hierarchal, opinionated, prejudical place I've ever been on
Earth. If you don't write their way, you don't write. If you're a
woman and pretty, you get invited to parties, if not, forget it.''
   Meeting author Donald Barthelme, who died recently, provided
Hijuelos with a valued friend and mentor.
   ``He sort of took me under his wing and pointed me in the right
direction,'' Hijuelos recalled. ``He wasn't narrow-minded in his
view of literature and exposed me to a lot of writers. And even
though I was writing quite differently from him, he never held that
against me.''
   ``He was a really nice man and a top-notch editorial adviser.''
   Barthelme helped with ``Mambo Kings,'' and Arnaz and some
not-so-famous musicians provided inspiration. Hijuelos recalled
working in a downtown office where the elevator operator would come
up to his floor and sing. A Cuban musician who died in a London
hotel room made a lasting impression.
   And, of course, there were songs, hundreds of them. ``Mambo
Kings'' is like a greatest hits album, complete with Hijuelos'
favorite dance songs, boleros and ballads.
   Hijuelos urges readers to start where they wish, open at any
page, like dropping the needle in the middle of a record, or tuning
in ``I Love Lucy'' at intermission and quickly filling in the plot.
   ``Barthelme was like that. Instead of thinking of a chapter as a
chapter, you think of it as an atmosphere, a state of
consciousness,'' he said. ``I wrote this book where you can open it
up anywhere and get an idea of what's going on in the book.''

   James Lamont ``Haven'' Gillespie, who wrote
the lyrics for ``Santa Claus is Comin' To Town,'' will no longer be
without honor in his hometown.
   City officials unveiling a historical marker Thursday at Goebel
Park said there was no better time than Christmas to honor Gillespie
on the 100th anniversary of his birth. He was born Feb. 6, 1888, in
the northern Kentucky city and died in Las Vegas on March 14, 1975.
   Gillespie, author of some 1,000 songs, wrote the lyrics to his
most famous song on the back of an envelope in 1933 and collaborated
with J. Fred Coots on the music. Eddie Cantor made it famous when he
sang it on his radio program in 1934.
   City Commissioner Irvin Callery said Thursday he became
interested in 1984 in having the city recognize the songwriter
``because I couldn't find anything to honor him,'' Callery said.
   Callery said Gillespie's famous Christmas song has ``brought joy
to millions of people. Anyone who hears it remembers childhood.''

FT  09 OCT 93 / Arts: Courageous writer wins Nobel Prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WOULD be a great pity if the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature to
the black American novelist Toni Morrison were to be seen as merely another
gesture of political correctness because it rewards the work of a courageous
writer who has charted new territory for the modern novel in a hard clear
prose that has the resonance of poetry. The picture we get of the lives of
black people in America from a novel like Beloved (1987) serves as a vivid
and moving corrective to the world depicted by Harriet Beecher Stowe in
Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Morrison gives us slavery as it really was, the beatings and rapings, the
cruel use of leg-irons and mouth-clamps, the interminable punishments
imposed for trivial offences. Her account is both unbearable and
unforgettable through her deep understanding of the people who endured this
system. She creates not merely individuals but whole families and
communities and the way they transmuted their suffering into irony with
consistent black humour (both senses) and a hearty appetite for the good
things that such a life did have to offer at those moments when the whip was
at bay. She takes a long-term historical view showing how the system was so
inhuman that it contained the seeds of its own ultimate destruction.
An uncompromising realism has been the mark of each of Morrison's six
novels, combined with a willingness to experiment with form. In her most
recent book Jazz (1992) concerning black urban migration her prose mimes the
repeated rhythms and syncopations of the music. It is a remarkable effect
that appears completely spontaneous but Morrison has confessed to having
re-written passages many times to get it absolutely right.
Morrison is thus as much a craftswoman of the novel as an engage campaigner.
She was born Chloe Anthony Wofford in 1931 in Lorain, a steel town near
Cleveland, Ohio. She was the second of four children in a black family
severely hit by the Depression yet succeeded in completing her education at
Howard and Cornell.
Her first novel, The Bluest Eye (1970), had for its heroine a young black
girl in Ohio who believes she has blue eyes. The heroine's incest with her
father, pregnancy, and ultimate insanity was a portent of things to come.
Sula (1973) studied the friendship between two black women throughout the
troubled 1930s while Song of Solomon (1977) and Tar Baby (1981) opened wider
perspectives on the fate of black people and dealt with the heritage of
slavery throughout America and the Caribbean.
Miss Morrison teaches creative writing at the University of Princeton.
Winning this prize (worth Pounds 563,000) to be awarded in Stockholm on
December 10 is likely to make Morrison's courses even more over-subscribed
than they are at present. It is also likely to give a new boost to the cause
of multi-culturalism in American education. Morrison has emerged publicly on
television as a resolute champion of multi-culturalism in direct opposition
to the views of people like her now fellow-Nobel-prize-winner Saul Bellow
and the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr who continue to uphold the primacy
of the traditional white-oriented culture. It is an explosive issue that
divides American academe into two fiercely hostile camps.

Most people won't recognize her name, but Helen Stearns collaborated on several 
songs with her brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
The brother-in-law was Hoagy Carmichael, who composed such legendary songs as 
"Star Dust," "Lazybones," and "Georgia On My Mind." 
</P>
<P>
He died in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
"I loved to listen to him play," Stearns said. "He'd be sitting there pecking 
around on the piano and he'd come up with a tune and say, 'You're the writer. 
Give me some words.' So I did sometimes. We wrote a lot of songs together, 
mostly children's songs." 
</P>
<P>
"April In My Heart" was one of their best. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think much about it at the time, but I still get small royalty checks 
for it from time to time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Stearns, 82, was back in Carmichael's native state over the weekend in 
conjunction with a retrospective concert by the Indiana Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, there's something about Hoosiers that is wholesome," she said. "No 
matter where they go or what they do, they carry it with them. That's what I 
remember about Hoagy. He was always wholesome in that odd Hoosier way. 
</P>
<P>
"That, I guess, and his music were what I liked most about him." 
</P>
<P>
Stearns was one of the "Barclay Girls" who modeled for artist McLelland Barclay 
in the 1930s, wrote screenplays that included the hit 1937 movie "I Met Him In 
Paris," and later worked as a newspaper editor in California and Maine, and as 
a writer, editor and publisher of children's books.

   Pianist and composer Robert D.
Emmerich, who played with the Tommy Dorsey band and wrote songs for
Fats Waller, has died at age 83.
   Emmerich died Friday at Florida Medical Center, and a funeral
was held Sunday.
   Emmerich wrote more than 100 songs, including ``Beat It Out,''
``Woe Is Me'' and 10 others for Waller. He wrote ``Our Love,''
first sung by Dinah Shore, and ``No. 10 Lullaby Lane,'' introduced
by Kate Smith.
   Emmerich, who collaborated with Buddy Bernier and Joseph Meyer,
wrote a song called ``The Big Apple'' in the 1940s, said his wife,
Miriam.
   ``Walter Winchell liked it so much he started calling New York
`the Big Apple,''' his wife said.
   Emmerich also was a vaudeville, radio and night club performer.
   ``Bob was a self-taught piano player who couldn't read a note of
music, but he had some left hand,'' Mrs. Emmerich said.
   Emmerich, who was born in New York City, moved to Florida nine
years ago.

   People recognize the melodies if not the man
behind the music:
   ``I Can Dream, Can't I?'', ``I'll Be Seeing You,'' ``Dear Hearts
and Gentle People,'' ``Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' ``That Old
Feeling,'' ``By a Waterfall,'' ``When I Take My Sugar to Tea,''
``Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine.''
   These and scores of other songs are the life's work of Sammy
Fain.
   At 86, Fain is one of the last of a breed of songwriters who
wrote their way from Tin Pan Alley to Broadway to Hollywood during
the golden days between the two World Wars. Give them a job and
they'd write a song _ fast.
   ``You know, you'd get an assignment on Monday,'' Fain says
matter-of-factly, ``and they'd be rehearsing the orchestra by
Thursday. It's one of those things.''
   If his name isn't as well-known as a Rodgers, Gershwin, Porter
or Berlin, it may be because he never had a big Broadway musical,
although Fain did write the music for ``Hellzapoppin,'' the
long-running vaudeville escapade remembered more for the antics of
comics Ole Olson and Chic Johnson than its songs.
   The success that eluded Fain on Broadway was found in Hollywood:
dozens of film assignments, 10 Academy Award nominations and two
best-song Oscars for ``Secret Love'' and ``Love Is a Many
Splendored Thing.''
   Now theatergoers have a chance to sample a Fain rarity, ``Ankles
Aweigh,'' a 1955 Broadway musical that had nothing more on its mind
than gags, girls and a good time.
   The show is on view at the Goodspeed Opera House, that
ginger-box musical museum in East Haddam, Conn., best known as the
birthplace of ``Annie'' and for its sterling revivals of vintage
musicals from the 1920s and '30s. It will run through Sept. 30.
   A new book has been written for the musical by Charles Busch,
author and star of the long-running off-Broadway hit, ``Vampire
Lesbians of Sodom.'' Busch's revamped plot, still set in the 1950s,
had something to do with Hollywood starlets, the U.S. Navy, Italy
and a secret code coveted by the Russians.
   ```Ankles Aweigh' is an old-fashioned show,'' Fain said the
other day during a visit to the headquarters of the American
Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ``It's got a lot of
good rhythmic tunes and ballads which I like to do.''
   Fain, whose family lived in New York, was born into music. His
father was a cantor. His older brother played violin in Broadway
pit orchestras. His cousin was Willie Howard, the great sad-faced
comedian.
   ``Every winter I would get pneumonia,'' Fain recalls, so the
family eventually moved from the city to the Catskills.
   ``Living up in the country, all I had was the piano,'' says
Fain, who taught himself to play and to write his own music. ``I
had a rather interesting little alto voice. I'd just get up and
sing my own material.''
   After high school, singing brought him back to New York and a
job as a staff pianist with Jack Mills who ran a music publishing
company.
   ``They hired me to demonstrate and teach their songs to all the
performing artists,'' Fain says. ``I would sell the songs to big
performers. It helped me learn to play in every key.''
   He also performed in vaudeville and on radio as part of an act
called Dunn and Fain. But he never stopping writing. His first hit
song, with lyrics by Al Dubin, was published in 1925. It's title
was ``Nobody Knows What a Redhead Mama Can Do,'' and Fain was on
his way.
   Two years later he teamed up with Irving Kahal, a young
vaudeville performer and writer. Their partnership took them to
Hollywood and back again to Broadway and lasted until Kahal died in
1942.
   In California, Fain and Kahal contributed songs to such movie
musical classics as ``Footlight Parade'' and ``Dames.'' The songs
they wrote during those days were sweet and saucy with titles like
``Two Little Flies on a Lump of Sugar'' and ``When You Were a Smile
on Your Mother's Lips (And a Twinkle in Your Daddy's Eye).''
   ``A good title is an incentive to me,'' Fain says. ``I'll change
my melody if I hear a good line. I'm not stubborn about it. That's
collaboration.''
   And Fain has worked with some of the best word men in the
business. Besides Kahal, his lyricists have included Al Dubin, Jack
Yellen, E.Y. Harburg, Mitchell Parish, Joe Young, Lew Brown, Ralph
Freed and Paul Francis Webster.
   ``When I play a good tune for a lyricist, it gives him some
construction,'' Fain says. ``Music can lead you to a different
construction and sometimes a good lyricist likes that. It gives
them a chance to dig for a different kind of rhyme.''
   ``Ankles Aweigh,'' which has lyrics by Dan Shapiro, originally
ran in New York for six months. Besides ``Hellzapoppin'' and its
sequel, ``Sons o' Fun,'' it was one of Fain's longer running
Broadway shows.
   Many of his other musicals, such as ``Christine,'' ``Something
More'' and ``Toplitsky of Notre Dame,'' disappeared quickly.
``Flahooley,'' a 1951 Fain musical that starred Yma Sumac, Barbara
Cook and Bil Baird's Marionettes, has developed an almost legendary
reputation.
   The score, one of Fain's best, graced a witty and satirical book
by E.Y. Harburg that told the story of a laughing doll and its
effect on the big business of toy-making.
   ``That show was the talk of Philadelphia,'' said Fain, recalling
``Flahooley's'' triumphant out-of-town opening. Only New York
seemed unimpressed and the musical died after only 40 performances.
   ``It was a very unusual show,'' Fain sats. ``Someday, somebody
will revive `Flahooley' and it will be a hit.''
   If the shows weren't successful, much of the music was. Consider
two of Fain's biggest hit songs _ ``I Can Dream, Can't I?'' and
``I'll Be Seeing You.'' They somehow survived a 1938 flop called
``Right This Way'' that lasted two weeks on Broadway.
   Fain keeps writing today _ turning out new songs at his home in
Beverly Hills, Calif.
   ``I like to read the script,'' Fain says. ``That gives me an
idea for a melody. Many times, I play a certain little progression
and the lyricist will say `That's great.' If he doesn't like it,
I'll switch it around to fit a line. We help each other. That's the
way to work.''

<MEMO>  Obituaries  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Mrs. Kaye, the widow of actor Danny Kaye, wrote the music and lyrics for
many of her husband's films, including "Up in Arms" (1944), "Wonder Man"
(1945), "The Kid From Brooklyn" (1946), "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"
(1947), "The Inspector General" (1949) and "The Court Jester" (1956).;   A
native of Brooklyn, she was a graduate of Brooklyn College, where she studied
music. After college, she helped put on skits at a summer camp in
Pennsylvania, where her fellow entertainers included Imogene Coca, Max Liebman
and Danny Kaye.;   There she began writing specialty material, including a
Yiddish version of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Mikado" for Danny Kaye. In 1940,
the sketches were produced on Broadway under the title "The Straw Hat Revue.";
  That year, she married Kaye, and the couple worked as a popular act at La
Martinique, a Manhattan nightclub. Mrs. Kaye wrote the music and lyrics for
her husband and accompanied him on piano.;   Mrs. Kaye was known for her
complex, witty lyrics, and she was often described as a composer of patter
songs, which turn on the rapid delivery of tricky lines.;   Most frequently
cited are "Anatole of Paris," "The Lobby Number" and "Soliloquy for Three
Heads," the last sung by three mirror images in "The Inspector General." But
Mrs. Kaye disagreed with this characterization.;   "I wrote many songs for
Danny that had patter sections in them," she once told an interviewer, "but
only two pure patter songs." They were "Melody in 4-F" and a variation of "The
Nightmare Song" from Gilbert and Sullivan's "Iolanthe." For the film "Knock on
Wood" (1954), she wrote "All About You," which Cole Porter called "a perfect
love song.";   For most of her career, Mrs. Kaye wrote songs and music solely
for her husband. She once estimated she wrote more than 100 songs for him
during their 40-year collaboration. She also was involved in the production of
almost all his films. She was nominated twice for Academy Awards, for her work
on "The Five Pennies" (1959) and "The Moon Is Blue" (1953).;   In the 1970s,
she embarked on a separate career as a television producer and teacher. She
began teaching musical comedy at the University of Southern California in 1971
and at Yale University in 1975.;   In 1979, she produced and narrated the
course as a 90-minute Public Broadcasting Service program, "Musical Comedy
Tonight," which won a Peabody Award. In 1975, she was executive producer for a
television special, "Danny Kaye: Look In at the Met." She also produced and
edited "Assignment Children," a UNICEF film that starred her husband.;   In
the last three years, Mrs. Kaye devoted most of her time to writing a book
about her life with Danny Kaye, "Fine and Danny," for Alfred A. Knopf. She
also was writing a catalog of show-business material that she and her husband
had donated to the Library of Congress.;   Brooklyn College awarded her an
honorary doctorate in humane letters in 1985. This year she endowed the Sylvia
Fine Chair in Musical Theater there. She recently financed the restoration of
the 664-seat Playhouse at Hunter College.;   Danny Kaye died in 1987 at the
age of 74. Mrs. Kaye is survived by her daughter, a magazine and television
journalist, and a sister, Rhoda Gamson of New York City.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Charlie Daniels And His Hard Driving Music</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE EDWARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firebrand fiddler Charlie Daniels called
the devil a nasty name in his million-selling record, ``The Devil
Went Down to Georgia.'' He also told the Russians where they could
go in his song, ``In America.''
   His new album, ``Homesick Heroes,'' is less polemical and
contains music that best portrays his band's style.
   ``It's what we are,'' he said. ``Hard driving music.''
   The rollicking album is the 18th in 17 years for the
irrepressible five-piece rock-country band that has performed in
all 50 states and several foreign countries.
   In it, Daniels plays a blazing fiddle to the flash point in
``Boogie Woogie Fiddle Country Blues,'' a hit single. He plays
rousing guitar licks on other songs, and sings sassy, gritty vocals
on still others.
   The LP is a turn away from his last album, ``Powder Keg,'' which
he described as the most rock-oriented LP he has recorded.
   ``It didn't do too well at all,'' Daniels said in an interview.
``It's still selling, but it never really got off the ground.''
   ``It was time for a change. The new album is a career move.''
   Country fans will welcome the sound from the ``kingfish of
Southern roots music'' whose traditional garb is a huge bullrider
cowboy hat, cowboy boots, jeans and vest.
   He and his band are best known for their Grammy-winning 1980
hit, ``The Devil Went Down to Georgia,'' the story of a feverish
fiddle contest between the devil and a boy named Johnny in which he
called the devil a mild obscenity. The single sold 1.6 million
copies and the ``Million Mile Reflections'' album that contained it
sold 2.3 million.
   ``It had mass appeal,'' Daniels said about the song. ``I guess
the lyrics of the song were responsible for 70-75 percent of the
popularity and the fiddle and the novelty value had a lot to do
with it.''
   The blunt lyrics in that song were similar to the ones in his
``In America,'' in which he issued his memorable directive to the
Soviets amid a burst of American pride.
   On topical subjects, Daniels' ``American Farmer'' focused on the
plight of agriculture in the mid-1980s. ``Still in Saigon'' was
about a former soldier haunted by his Vietnam experience. Other
songs by the band, such as ``Long Haired Country Boy'' and ``Uneasy
Rider,'' are more satirical.
   ``I poke fun at rednecks, hippies, politicians, all kinds of
people,'' said Daniels, a native of Wilmington, N.C.
   The band traveled 75,000 miles last year, making 116 concert
stops. In 1986, they grossed nearly $14 million and drew more than
750,000 paid admissions.
   Amid all the travel and hit records, Daniels has done a little
acting. He was in ``Murder, She Wrote'' and ``Lone Star Kid'' on
the Public Broadcasting Service.
   He and the band were featured in the movie, ``Urban Cowboy,''
and their ``Stroker's Theme'' was the title track for Burt
Reynolds' movie ``Stroker Ace.''
   Daniels' writing has not been restricted to songs. In 1985, he
wrote a book of short stories, ``The Devil Went Down to Georgia.''
   Daniels said one of his proudest achievements has been keeping
his band members together so long. Three members have been with him
at least 14 years.
   ``It seems like I've had Taz (DiGregorio, his keyboard player)
since two days after he was born,'' Daniels said.
   ``We're sincere,'' he said about the band's success and its
togetherness. ``I keep a 12-month payroll. We have the philosophy
that we do the best we can all the time. We get to stretch out some
as musicians. Everybody gets to use their ideas and share in the
songwriting royalties. I try to treat people well and look after
our folks.
   ``We try real hard,'' he said. ``I want to do the best I can do:
cut every record the best, write every song the best, do every show
the best, have the most efficient organization in the music
business.
   ``I want the deejays to pick up a Charlie Daniels Band record
and say, `Here's a record by the Charlie Daniels Band and I want to
play this.'
   ``Quality. You can't beat it.''

<DESCRIPT>  ENTERTAINMENT; PAST; MUSIC; CELEBRITY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WE INTERRUPT this mundane existence to remember Cole Porter.;    In case you
haven't circled the date on your calendar, note please that Porter was born
June 9, 1891, to Kate Cole and Samuel Fenwick Porter. Cole was the first of
the Porter children to survive his early infancy. Two earlier children had
died as babies.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  COLE PORTER, YOU'RE THE TOP  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Entertainment  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It took Cole Porter 10 years to write his first song, "Song of the Birds."
It was not a hit.;    But after that, the songs came hot and heavy. At 11,
Cole Porter wrote "The Bobolink Waltz," which was actually published
(privately) and 100 copies were printed, thanks to Mom.;    In the 73 years of
his life, Cole Porter was to write more than 800 songs, more than half
unpublished. There are few writers who were more prolific.;    Today Cole
Porter occupies a musical niche all his own. He's still the backbone of
cabaret performers the world over, not to mention the cocktail lounge
pianists. He represents a style and an age that has all but disappeared, but
that just adds nostalgia to his material.;    Porter came out of a time when
songwriting was a youthful sport, much like stand-up comedy is today. Musical
shows were everywhere. Broadway, in a season, might have four or five dozen.; 
  Young lyricists and composers had college shows and college revues to learn
their craft, and Porter took advantage of that at Yale, where he composed (and
wrote his own lyrics for) many campus hits. ("Bulldog, Bulldog, Bow Wow Wow"
is still played at football games.);    Robert Kimball's hefty book, "The
Complete Lyrics of Cole Porter" (Knopf) has collected the songs, including the
ones at Yale. One begins:;    "First select a small canoe/ Where there's room
for only two . . .";    Little turns of phrase and wit. In our own age, where
rock lyrics cannot be heard or understood without special effort, Porter's
lyrical sophistication seems quaint. But his words are as well remembered as
that of any poet and, in concert with his melodies, serve as a backdrop for so
many private memories over the years.;    Speaking of rock lyrics, where
profanity seems commonplace, it's interesting to note that Porter was
considered risque in his time, and such songs as "I Get a Kick Out of You" had
to have such lines as "I get no kick from cocaine" censored.;    The beautiful
ballad "Love for Sale" could not be sung on radio or television for years.;   
Porter was a rich kid who spent many years in Europe. His career developed
slowly and is replete with flop shows and abandoned songs. A riding accident,
wherein a horse fell on him and crushed both legs, left him in pain the rest
of his life. Six years before his death, one leg was amputated.;    Today,
Porter is part of a select group of American songwriters who are considered
literary and musical treasures. Yale University has a collection of his
manuscripts. So does the Library of Congress. A discovery at a Warner Bros.
warehouse of unseen Porter lyrics in 1982 was front-page news everywhere.;   
That's kind of amazing, considering the low esteem songwriting enjoyed during
those early days of Porter's career. Lorenz Hart, who wrote lyrics for Richard
Rodgers, was said to have become seriously depressed by the lack of importance
of his calling.;    Today, ironically, songwriting is a huge money-maker,
though, with the exception of a Stephen Sondheim (and you will get an argument
there), nobody comes up to the artistry of a Cole Porter now.;    But enough
of this tribute. Let's get to the songs. I regret I can't supply the melodies,
but hunt up an Ella Fitzgerald album or, if you can find one, a rare recording
by Janice Mars, who sang Cole Porter as if she lived each lyric. In a pinch,
some of Sinatra will do.;    And you'll hear: "Begin the Beguine" and the
haunting "In the Still of the Night.";    You will be cheered by "From This
Moment On." Romance was never better than "I've Got You Under My Skin." It's
said that a mourning Jackie Kennedy sat for hours listening to "Down in the
Depths on the 90th Floor.";    Americans during World War II wept through
"You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To." Mary Martin first made her mark with "My
Heart Belongs to Daddy.";    So many songs are classics: "You're the Top,"
"It's De-Lovely." "It's All Right With Me," "Night and Day," "Just One of
Those Things.";    Roy Rogers and his horse, Trigger, recorded "Don't Fence Me
In" during that song's heyday. And a recording last year by current pop and
rock stars doing Porter, "Red, Hot &plus; Blue," was a surprise hit, bridging the
generations.;    This year there will be many reminiscences, including galas
at Carnegie Hall and the London Palladium this week and next. There will even
be a postage stamp.;    All meant to say, Cole, you're the top.  </TEXT>

   Admiral Sergei Gorshkov, the man credited with
turning the Soviet Union into a modern naval power, died Friday at
age 78, Tass said.
   Gorshkov was appointed to head the Soviet navy in 1956 by Nikita
S. Khrushchev, who considered Josef Stalin's emphasis on large
surface vessels impractical because of their vulnerability to
rocket attacks.
   In the book ``Sea Power of the State,'' Gorshkov said the Soviet
navy's development of a fleet of submarines and missile-launching
warships had frustrated ``illusory hopes of imperialist aggressors
that in the sphere of armed conflict at sea they would have no
strong opponent.''
   Gorshkov was replaced in 1985.

<TEXT>
   Academy Award-winning composer Sammy Fain,
who wrote such enduring tunes as ``Love Is a Many Splendored
Thing,'' ``That Old Feeling'' and the wartime classic ``I'll Be
Seeing You,'' died Wednesday. He was 87.
   The two-time Oscar recipient, who suffered a heart attack, was
at the UCLA Medical Center when he died, said Ken Sunshine, a
publicist for the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers.
   During a career that stretched from New York's Tin Pan Alley to
Broadway and Hollywood, Fain wrote some of the most memorable pop
hits of American music this century.
   Many Fain titles bring instant tune recognition: ``Let A Smile
Be Your Umbrella,'' ``I'll Be Seeing You,'' ``Wedding Bells Are
Breaking Up That Old Gang of Mine'' and ``Tender is the Night''
among them.
   ```I'll Be Seeing You' _ just think of how often we say that.
But when you say it a certain way, it means something very deep,''
said ASCAP President Morton Gould of the World War II song.
   ``It's hard for me to believe I won't be seeing him anymore. He
was such a sweet person, such a gentle person,'' Gould said.
   Fain's collaborators over the years included lyricists Irving
Kahal, Bob Hilliard, Harold Adamson, Lew Brown, Paul Francis
Webster, Mitchell Parish, Sammy Cahn, E.Y. Hapburg, and Alan and
Marilyn Bergman.
   ``Sammy didn't study at Juilliard. He played the piano by ear.
He was self-taught, but he wrote some of the most beautiful
standard melodies,'' said lyricist Parish in a telephone interview
from New York.
   The two men wrote ``You're So Indifferent'' for Lena Horne and
another tune, ``In a Little French Cafe.''
   ``When a writer sat down in those days to write a song, he
didn't sit down to write a standard,'' Parish said. ``We wrote
songs that we felt inside of our hearts _ to have people sing and
dance to, and for kids to whistle in the streets. Workmen, whatever
they were doing, would be singing strains of our songs. ... That
explains why these songs are still alive.''
   Fain was nominated for 10 Academy Awards during his long career.
He won for best song for the title tune from the 1955 movie ``Love
Is a Many Splendored Thing'' and in 1953 for ``Secret Love'' from
the Doris Day film ``Calamity Jane.''
   Known for a self-effacing style, Fain's modesty even extended to
Academy Award politics. When he had a little-heard 1976
Oscar-nominated song, ``A World That Never Was,'' from a
little-seen movie called ``Half a House,'' he said in a trade paper
advertisement: ``It would be nice if we had a commercial record,
but we don't. It would also be nice if we were in a widely seen
motion picture, but we don't have that, either.''
   To make up for those shortcomings, Fain provided a
``Dial-a-Song'' phone number so Academy voters could hear his song.
But the award went to ``Evergreen'' that year.
   Born Samuel Feinberg in New York City on June 17, 1902, Fain was
a piano prodigy who unsuccessfully worked Tin Pan Alley until
teaming with lyricist Kahal for their first hit, ``Nobody Knows
What A Red-Headed Mama Can Do.''
   He went to Hollywood to work in early musical films, including
``Dames,'' ``Footlight Parade,'' and ``Goin' to Town,'' then
returned to Broadway and wrote songs for the smash review
``Hellzapoppin'' in 1938.
   Two songs from a failed Fain musical that same year, ``I'll Be
Seeing You'' and ``I Can Dream, Can't I,'' later became wartime
classics, the latter recorded by the Andrews Sisters.
   Back in Hollywood after the war, Fain and Hilliard wrote all the
songs for Walt Disney's ``Alice In Wonderland,'' including the tune
``I'm Late.''
   He also joined with Cahn to write the score for Disney's ``Peter
Pan,'' which included the tune ``Second Star to the Right,'' and
wrote music for Disney's ``The Rescuers'' in 1977.
   Fain was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971 and
was presented earlier this year with a special award from ASCAP for
lifetime achievement.
   He had been a member of the ASCAP board of directors for the
past 10 years.
   He is survived by a son, Frank, of New York. Funeral
arrangements were pending.

<HEADLINE>  SUCCESSFUL DETECTIVE MUSICAL
'CITY OF ANGELS' LANDS IN L.A.  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Theater  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Movie producer Buddy Fidler holds the latest pages of a script by Stine, a
novelist-turned-screenwriter.;    "You like 'em?" Stine asks.;    "They're
perfect," Fidler says with false sincerity. "But we'll fix 'em.";    Moments
later, he breaks into a song that admonishes: "Don't cling to the words to
which you gave birth/ Remember how many a picture is worth.";    Time zips
forward. It's the early 1990s. The place, once again, is Los Angeles.;   
Scriptwriter Larry Gelbart, composer Cy Coleman, lyricist David Zippel and
director Michael Blakemore are talking about their stage musical "City of
Angels," which opens today at L.A.'s Shubert Theatre.;    Their collaboration
has been more harmonious than that of Stine and Fidler, their fictional
creations.;    "A real collaboration is a complementing of talents," Gelbart
said. "We laughed at the same jokes. We had the same appreciation of what a
lyric ought to be and what a melody ought to be -- of how this show should
employ humor, drama, words and music.";    The chemistry seems to have worked.
For a year and a half, "City of Angels" has been on Broadway, where it won six
1990 Tony Awards, including Best Musical.;    Audiences and critics alike have
applauded the show's stylish evocation of such 1940s detective movies as "The
Maltese Falcon" and "The Big Sleep." The script crackles with the energy of a
Raymond Chandler novel, and the score incorporates jazz styles ranging from
sultry torch songs to the slinky harmonies of such vocal groups as Lambert,
Hendricks and Ross.;    The show begins with the set and costumes in the
black, white, and gray tones of a '40s flick. The story involves the
wise-cracking, tough-as-nails private investigator Stone (portrayed by Tony
winner James Naughton), and he's ably assisted -- and quietly adored -- by
Oolie (Tony winner Randy Graff), his secretary and girl Friday.;    Stone
senses trouble when the rich and beautiful Alaura Kingsley struts into his
office, asking him to find her missing stepdaughter. Still, he falls for this
femme fatale, as well as her $100 retainer. He takes the job.;    A typewriter
is heard as the characters continue speaking. A writer -- in full color -- is
seen on the other side of the stage. He pauses, and the characters speak their
last lines backward and move backward to their previous positions. When the
writer begins typing again, the characters replay the scene with a few
changes.;    The writer is Stine, author of a best-selling novel about
fictional detective Stone. He is adapting the novel, titled "City of Angels,"
as a screenplay. The black-and-white movie springs directly from his mind,
with people from his real life reincarnated in the screenplay.;    Many
reviews and feature articles have described "City of Angels" as a spoof of
detective movies. The creators disagree. "This is not a parody," Gelbart said.
"We did this out of affection and respect for that genre.";    The story
behind the musical's creation is considerably less convoluted than the plots
of those private-eye movies. In the early 1980s, Gelbart and Coleman began
talking about doing a show together. Gelbart, 63, started out in radio and
television, writing comic material for such entertainers as Sid Caesar, Bob
Hope and Danny Kaye. He later developed and co-produced the television series
"M(*)A(*)S(*)H." For the theater, he co-wrote the book for the musical "A
Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum," and he wrote the recent
Broadway play "Mastergate.";    Coleman, 61, was a familiar presence on
Broadway, having written the scores for such musicals as "Wildcat," "Little
Me," "Sweet Charity," "On the Twentieth Century" and "Barnum.";    Several
years passed. Then, in the mid-'80s, they decided to work with Coleman's idea
for a private-eye musical. As work progressed, they brought in Zippel. At 36,
he's the youngster in the group. Before "City of Angels," he was best known
for songs he had written for Barbara Cook and for an off-Broadway revue of his
songs, titled "It's Better With a Band.";    "We wanted everything to match so
that it would seem like one person wrote the show," Zippel said. Music and
dialogue were carefully integrated, so that the songs would advance the plot
and set the mood.;    "As a composer working in the theater, you have to be a
dramatist," Coleman said. Music can be extraordinarily powerful when it's
intelligently combined with the story, he explained. "The power to manipulate
with music is just mammoth. You can do anything you want with people's
emotions.";    The writers targeted Blakemore as their director. Blakemore,
who hails from Australia, has won acclaim in England and the United States for
directing such plays as "Noises Off," "Benefactors" and the Maggie Smith hit
"Lettice and Lovage.";    Once he joined the project, Blakemore helped to
sharpen and clarify. One of his primary objectives was to make the film
sequences look like the real thing. "I tried to put a movie on stage," he
said. To achieve this, he coordinated the actors' movements and the shifting
of the sets to resemble tracking shots and other camera movements.;    "City
of Angels" opened Dec. 11, 1989, at Broadway's Virginia Theatre. A few months
later, it was named Best Musical at the Tony Awards, and it won other awards
for Gelbart's book, Coleman and Zippel's score, Naughton and Graff's
performances and Robin Wagner's sets.;    Blakemore smiled when asked if the
humor in "City of Angels" is cutting enough to make Hollywood nervous. "I
don't think the movie industry has anything to fear," he said.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Oscar-winning composer Sammy Fain, whose
classic love ballads included ``Love is a Many Splendored Thing''
and ``I'll be Seeing You,'' has died of a heart attack. He was 87.
   Fain, who was nominated for 10 Academy Awards and won two, died
Wednesday at the UCLA Medical Center, said Ken Sunshine, a
publicist for the American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers.
   During a career that stretched from New York's Tin Pan Alley to
Broadway and Hollywood, Fain wrote some of America's most memorable
pop hits.
   Many Fain titles bring instant recognition: ``Secret Love,''
``Let A Smile Be Your Umbrella,'' ``Wedding Bells Are Breaking Up
That Old Gang of Mine'' and ``Tender is the Night'' among them.
   `` `I'll Be Seeing You' _ just think of how often we say that.
But when you say it a certain way, it means something very deep,''
ASCAP President Morton Gould said of the World War II song. ``It's
hard for me to believe I won't be seeing him anymore. He was such a
sweet person, such a gentle person.''
   Sammy Cahn, a decades-long colleague and collaborator, said his
friend leaves ``not just a few but a staggering medley of hits,
songs that are readily identifiable to everyone.''
   He added: ``You know, old songwriters never really die because
their songs keep them alive forever.''
   Fain's collaborators included lyricists Cahn, Irving Kahal, Bob
Hilliard, Harold Adamson, Lew Brown, Paul Francis Webster, Mitchell
Parish, E.Y. Harburg, and Alan and Marilyn Bergman.
   ``Sammy didn't study at Juilliard. He played the piano by ear.
He was self-taught, but he wrote some of the most beautiful
standard melodies,'' said Parish in a telephone interview from New
York.
   The two men wrote ``You're So Indifferent'' for Lena Horne and
another tune, ``In a Little French Cafe.''
   ``When a writer sat down in those days to write a song, he
didn't sit down to write a standard,'' Parish said. ``We wrote
songs that we felt inside of our hearts _ to have people sing and
dance to, and for kids to whistle in the streets.
   ``Workmen, whatever they were doing, would be singing strains of
our songs ... That explains why these songs are still alive.''
   Fain won Oscars for the title tune from the 1955 movie ``Love Is
a Many Splendored Thing'' and in 1953 for ``Secret Love'' from the
Doris Day film ``Calamity Jane.''
   Born Samuel Feinberg in New York on June 17, 1902, Fain was a
piano prodigy who unsuccessfully worked Tin Pan Alley until teaming
with Kahal for their first hit, ``Nobody Knows What A Red-Headed
Mama Can Do.''
   He went to Hollywood to work in early musical films, including
``Dames,'' ``Footlight Parade,'' and ``Goin' to Town,'' then
returned to Broadway and wrote songs for the smash 1938 review
``Hellzapoppin.''
   Two songs from a failed Fain musical that year, ``I'll Be Seeing
You'' and ``I Can Dream, Can't I,'' later became wartime classics.
The latter was recorded by the Andrews Sisters.
   Back in Hollywood after the war, Fain and Hilliard wrote the
songs for Walt Disney's ``Alice In Wonderland,'' including the tune
``I'm Late.''
   He also joined with Cahn to write the score for Disney's ``Peter
Pan,'' which included the tune ``Second Star to the Right,'' and
wrote music for Disney's ``The Rescuers'' in 1977.
   Fain is survived by a son, Frank, of New York.

<TEXT>
   Blowing out the candles and making a wish
may get you a rendition of ``Happy Birthday to You,'' but you can't
buy it for a song. The ditty is for sale for at least $12 million,
says the company that owns it.
   Cooed by Marilyn Monroe to President John F. Kennedy, sung
recently by 90,000 fans to Michael Jackson, and a staple of
children's birthday parties for almost a century, the song that
seems ageless while reminding us we aren't is on the block with the
other musical holdings of Birchtree Ltd. of Princeton.
   ``The first six notes of `Happy Birthday' are as recognizable as
the first four notes in Beethoven's `Fifth Symphony,''' said Gary
Hanson of the Cleveland Orchestra. ``Of course, `Happy Birthday' is
played a lot more than Beethoven.''
   David Sengstack, chairman of Birchtree, said he can only guess
what made the song so popular.
   ``I think it was the movies that did it,'' he told The New York
Times.
   Translated into dozens of languages, the composition began as a
classroom greeting in 1893 with Louisville, Ky., teachers Patty
Smith Hill and her sister, Mildred J. Hill. The two kindergarten
and Sunday school teachers wrote the song, with the lyrics ``Good
morning to you,'' as part of a book ``Song Stories for the Sunday
School.''
   Since then, it has become one of the three most popular songs in
the English language along with ``Auld Lang Syne'' and ``For He's a
Jolly Good Fellow,'' according to the Guinness Book of World
Records.
   Birchtree, which owns the copyright to about 50,000 titles, says
royalties will still be coming in until the year 2010, when the
copyright expires. It brings it about $1 million a year, according
to the Times.
   ``Everybody uses it,'' said Kate Shen, a spokeswoman for
Birchtree. ``It gets used in movies and plays and greeting cards,
music boxes, television shows and commercials. It's just about
everywhere.''
   Even underwear.
   The company objected when Frederick's of Hollywood advertised
underwear that played ``Happy Birthday.'' But it had no problem
when Casio programmed the song into digital watches that play it
every hour on the watch owner's birthday. The song brings Birchtree
a penny a watch.
   A lawsuit against Postal Telegraph in the 1940's attempted to
keep the song from being used in singing telegrams. But the suit
was dropped when lawyers argued that even though it was sung for
profit, it was not heard in public.
   Since then, the song has been used _ and paid for _ in the films
``10,'' ``The Great Santini,'' ``Oh, God,'' and ``Fame.''
   ``I don't know really why it became so popular,'' Ms. Shen said.
``It seems to bring out the little kid in a lot of people. It's
something we've all grown up with.''
   The song's melody originally had the lyrics: ``Good Morning to
you, good morning to you, good morning, dear children, good morning
to all.'' Only later did the sisters add the birthday lyrics.
   A copyright was issued on the song in 1935 to Clayton F. Summy
Co., of Chicago, a sheet-music retailer that published the Hill
sisters' work. A New York accountant eventually purchased the song
and then sold it to the Sengstack family, which owns Birchtree.

JOHNNIE RAY, BALLADEER OF THE 1950S, DIES AT 63 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Johnnie Ray, the balladeer of tears who brought an emotional intensity to music 
that was singular to his era, died Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The performer, once dubbed "The Prince of Wails" for his impassioned renditions 
of such songs as "Cry" and "Please Mr. Sun," was 63 and died of liver failure 
at 4 p.m., Cedars-Sinai spokesman Ron Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been in and out of the hospital for the last three months" and lapsed 
into a coma Feb. 14, Wise said. 
</P>
<P>
Ray, noted for his stormy style, would jump about as he sang, bend his knees 
and cup his hand to his left ear, where a hearing aid had been in place for 
many years. He injured the ear while being tossed in the air by friends when he 
was 10, and his hearing deteriorated through the years. Many said, not 
unkindly, that he sang as if everyone in the room had similar hearing problems. 
</P>
<P>
As he sang, he contorted his babyish face into a painful expression, tugged at 
his hair and cried. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, his first hit in 1950 was called "Cry." The other side of that 
record was "The Little White Cloud That Cried." They quickly became the No. 1 
and No. 2 songs in the country, turning an awkward, shy boy into a national 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Times rock critic Robert Hilburn wrote that Ray had played a 
"small but noteworthy role in the evolution of rock," helping pave the way for 
the passionate singers that followed him. 
</P>
<P>
His roots actually were in rhythm and blues, for his flamboyant style had 
forced him away from mainstream nightclubs and in front of black audiences at 
the Flame Showbar in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
He soon became the only white artist on Okeh Records' black R&amp;B roster. 
</P>
<P>
(Music critics have said the intensity of his early vocals helped open the door 
for Elvis Presley and other white rock artists.) 
</P>
<P>
After those instant successes he moved into the mainstream of singers and lost 
favor with the teen-agers who had mobbed him at personal appearances in the 
early 1950s. But he was never forgotten by the white rockers who followed him. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as last year he shared a stage with Billy Idol. And Billy Joel, who 
opened last week's Grammy Awards telecast, sang "We Didn't Start the Fire," a 
song of appreciation for long-ago performers that names Ray in the lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
Although young record buyers had largely ignored him for the last three 
decades, their parents hadn't. He appeared regularly in New York, Las Vegas and 
Atlantic City, singing the evergreen favorites that had put him on the national 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
Born John Alvin Ray in Dallas, Ore., a small town outside Salem (where he made 
his last public appearance), Ray was the son of a man who played fiddle at 
square dances and a woman proficient on the piano. He became a self-taught 
pianist who sang at church and at school. 
</P>
<P>
Initially an outgoing child, friends recall that after his hearing loss he 
became introverted and his teachers and others chastised him for not paying 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the loneliest kid in the world," he was quoted as saying. From that 
loneliness came "The Little White Cloud That Cried," which he wrote in his 
teens. 
</P>
<P>
But after he was fitted with a hearing aid at 15, his horizons expanded and he 
decided to become an actor, performing in local plays and amateur shows. 
</P>
<P>
He met Sophie Tucker, the raucous and lightly ribald singer, as she was passing 
through Portland where Ray was singing at a burlesque house. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to make it in show business," she told him, "get the hell out of 
Portland." 
</P>
<P>
He came to Hollywood in 1949 to act in films but found only odd jobs as a 
bartender and piano player in clubs he described as "upholstered sewers." 
</P>
<P>
He went to New York and then to Detroit, where he found work at the Flame 
Showbar. A local disc jockey persuaded a Columbia Records representative to 
give him a chance and the result was "Whiskey and Gin" and "Tell the Lady I 
Said Goodbye" for Okeh, a Columbia subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
Those songs became popular in the Midwest, but it wasn't until he returned to 
New York to record "Cry" and "Little White Cloud" that he became fully 
established. 
</P>
<P>
He followed those hits with "Please Mr. Sun" and "Brokenhearted," arranged by 
Mitch Miller. All four became million-sellers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1952 he opened at the Copacabana in New York and the standing-room-only 
crowds (and press agents) began to call him "The Prince of Wails," "The Nabob 
of Sob" and "The Atomic Ray," among other sobriquets. 
</P>
<P>
He became the first performer to earn $25,000 a week in Las Vegas and on March 
23, 1953, made the first of nine appearances at the London Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
The following year he came back to Hollywood to make the film debut he had 
sought earlier. He appeared as the son of Ethel Merman and Dan Dailey in the 
Irving Berlin musical "There's No Business Like Show Business." 
</P>
<P>
But records were his forte and he returned to the studio. In the next five 
years he made hits of "Just Walking in the Rain," "Walking My Baby Back Home," 
"Yes Tonight, Josephine," "Hernando's Hideaway," "Such a Night," "Somebody 
Stole My Gal" and more. 
</P>
<P>
"Cry," his original hit, had sold 25 million copies at his death and Columbia 
recently released a compact disc of his many hit singles. 
</P>
<P>
He married once, in 1952, to Marilyn Morrison, daughter of Mocambo nightclub 
owner Charlie Morrison, but they divorced. He is survived by a sister and 
nieces and nephews. 
</P>
<P>
His personal life was sometimes as pained as his music. He developed a drinking 
problem, he told The Times in 1976, but indicated he had conquered it. 
</P>
<P>
Ray credited his success with "showing people the emotion they're afraid to 
show" and also said he had grown more appreciative of his career over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Last October, in Salem at what proved to be his final appearance, he told his 
audience: 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't get any better than this."

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The man who created gospel music is as obscure
as his music is popular. Thomas Dorsey is now 88 and bedridden in
his Chicago home. A handful of gospel devotees are working to build
a foundation that would preserve both his music and his memory.
</TEXT>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than half a century ago, Thomas Dorsey
crossed the raw soulfulness of the blues with the sacred music of
his youth to create a foot-stomping, soul-slapping sound that still
fills black churches.
   A personal conflict over his strict religious upbringing and
love of the bawdy, bluesy tunes inspired by slave songs led the
young jazz pianist to create what he called ``gospel'' music.
   Now 88, bedridden in his Chicago home and suffering from
Alzheimer's disease, Dorsey is in danger of dying in obscurity, his
legend unknown by a generation of worshippers who revere his music
but don't know his name.
   ``He was the person who gave blacks a medium to keep their
tradition alive,'' says Michael Harris, a professor of religion and
African American studies at Temple University in Philadelphia and
the author of a new biography on Dorsey.
   Black church music before Dorsey ``was very easygoing. It wasn't
upbeat, it wasn't filled with a lot of rhythmic tones,'' says Bob
Storman, a former gospel performer who with a handful of other
aficionados is working to build a Dorsey foundation in Chicago.
   ``It wasn't until the late '20s and '30s that a lot of ministers
would let that kind of music into their church,'' Storman says.
``The ministers figured that it was indecent and unreligious. For
them it was like some people react to acid rock music today.''
   Dorsey's song ``It's Tight Like That'' hit the top of the blues
charts about September 1928, Harris says. ``A number of people were
very shocked to see the type of music they danced to the night
before the next morning in church,'' he says.
   Dorsey's all-time greatest hit, ``Take My Hand, Precious Lord,''
was the favorite song of the Rev. Martin Luther King, and was
popularized by the late Mahalia Jackson, who once toured with
Dorsey. It has been translated into more than 50 languages.
   Dorsey's work includes more than 1,000 gospel tunes and all
would be displayed, his wife, Kathryn, said in an interview from
the couple's South Side home.
   ``I think he would think it was one of the greatest things that
ever happened,'' she said. ``It would be the only one in the United
States'' dedicated solely to Dorsey, she said.
   But efforts to raise a half-million dollars for the foundation
have faltered. A Chicago concert in December was to be the group's
first fund-raising event, but it was canceled for lack of interest.
   Storman says that while people know Dorsey's music, they don't
know Dorsey. They confuse him with Tommy Dorsey, the jazz
bandleader of the 1940s.
   In promoting Thomas Dorsey, Storman and colleagues have found
that ``people thought we were talking about the jazz artist. We had
to remind people that Tommy Dorsey had passed.'' Tommy Dorsey died
in 1956.
   Thomas Dorsey was born July 1, 1899, just outside Atlanta. His
father was sickly, and he, his mother and four siblings had to help
support the family.
   ``His mother was a very, very religious woman who had been a
profound influence on him,'' says Harris.
   ``He became enamored of a resident pianist at a local theater.
Then as a 12-year-old boy he started playing in bordellos, playing
piano, blues. By that time, he was supporting his family.''
   Dorsey later began composing blues and playing jazz and blues
piano. He adopted the stage name ``Georgia Tom.''
   He began experimenting with gospel music as a way to reconcile
an internal conflict over his religious upbringing and his early
love of blues, Harris says.
   As a young man, Dorsey moved to Chicago, and gradually began to
concentrate on composing gospel music.
   ``He was the first black man in America to publish gospel music,
in 1926,'' and started his own publishing firm at that time in
Chicago, Storman says.
   He sent his first two gospel songs, ``If You See My Saviour''
and ``How About You,'' to hundreds of churches. ``Not a single
person ordered one,'' Harris says.
   ``He spent time going from church to church trying to sell this.
The people thought it was blues, an inappropriate kind of music for
formal worship.''
   In 1931, Dorsey was devastated by the deaths of his first wife
and baby daughter in childbirth. ``That was when he wrote his
all-time great, `Take My Hand, Precious Lord,''' Storman says.
``And that was when he became totally dedicated to just doing
gospel.''
   In January 1932, at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Chicago, the Rev.
J. Howard Lorenzo Smith hired Dorsey to form a choir.
   A month later, at Pilgrim Baptist Church, the Rev. J.C. Austin
invited Smith to preach an anniversary service, Harris says. Smith
brought the choir and ``staid Pilgrim Baptist Church ... went
wild.''
   Two days later Austin offered Dorsey the job of directing his
church chorus.
   ``I was a little boy then,'' says the Rev. J.C. Austin Jr.,
Austin's son and the current minister. ``You couldn't get into the
church. The fire department came to keep the traffic moving ...
every Sunday morning.''
   Under Dorsey, the choir gained national attention, and he
remained its director until the late 1970s, when he retired.
   Dorsey, a tall, thin, distinguished-looking man, was shrewd in
his business dealings.
   ``He was self-taught, never went beyond third grade. But he took
this gospel thing and built his own publishing business out of
it,'' Harris says.
   Dorsey sold his business in the early 1950s to New York-based
Chapel Music, which has continued to publish his music, his
attorney Jay Ross says.
   Dorsey also knew how to create music that performers want to
sing.
   ``There's no comparison to him. He's in a class all by
himself,'' says gospel singer Albertina Walker.
   ``The songs that he wrote ... they have such a meaning, they
have such a message. People are forgetting Dorsey. But you really
can't forget him. He should be remembered as the father of gospel
music, the founder of gospel music.''

REMEMBERING BERLIN -- ALWAYS;

'IF YOU'RE A PRO YOU WRITE WHAT YOU GOTTA WRITE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK HIRSHBERG, Hirshberg, a publicist at Paramount in the 1940s, worked 
with Irving Berlin on White Christmas and Blue Skies. Following are 
recollections and excerpts of conversations he taped over the years with the 
reclusive composer who died Friday at age 101. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I had the good fortune to work on an almost daily basis with Irving Berlin for 
close to two years at one time, and for other shorter spans. We had many 
conversations, some of which I managed to record. This was no minor 
accomplishment inasmuch as Berlin, a wiry, supercharged individual, aspired to 
assert complete control over any project with which he was associated. 
</P>
<P>
He was almost always in motion, seldom remaining seated for more than a few 
minutes unless he was at the piano. He preferred to patrol the executive 
corridors at Paramount Studios, where we worked, or pace nervously in circles 
around his office, frequently in shirt sleeves, lost in introspection, hands 
clasped behind his back, torso bent slightly forward as he moved. Like an ice 
skater. 
</P>
<P>
He was a genial man, as sharp a businessman as he was a beguiling and 
perceptive poet. 
</P>
<P>
Berlin once told me, with his customary candor, that some of his output "was 
trash." Nonetheless, his ability to churn out songs so enchanting and timeless 
that their appeal spans generations and socioeconomic strata and national and 
racial boundaries is unrivaled in the annals of American music. 
</P>
<P>
"Some songs just write themselves," Berlin said. "Take 'Cheek to Cheek,' for 
instance. It is quite a long, involved song. I wrote it for Astaire and Rogers 
in 'Top Hat.' I did it after dinner one evening while staying at the Beverly 
Wilshire Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, I was not satisfied lyrically with 'Always.' I had the tune 
finished for months but couldn't get the lyric right. Then one day I just 
ad-libbed it and it worked. For me, lyrics are the hardest part." 
</P>
<P>
"There's no special recipe for success," Berlin told me. "Some very good songs 
never got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the timing is wrong and a good song dies. It happens to all writers. 
In my opinion, Cole Porter's 'Begin the Beguine' is one of the greatest pieces 
of music written by anybody. It was in a show called 'Jubilee' many years ago 
and it was a failure until much later Artie Shaw, the big-band leader, made a 
recording and everyone suddenly discovered it is a classic. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote 'White Christmas' because I had to write a song about Christmas for 
the show. I was a good songwriter so I wrote a good song." 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain basic emotions, not only in songwriting and play writing but 
also in making speeches or writing stories. There's self-pity, which is 'All 
Alone' or 'Remember' . . . where you feel sorry for yourself. There's 
happiness. There's the straight love song, like 'Always.' There's the homesick 
song -- songs about Dixie. There's the patriotic song, such as 'God Bless 
America.' 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, I've written songs that were failures. You can be so clever that 
you write around your subject and become oblique. Your pencil becomes so sharp 
that you write from the outside rather than the inside. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all amateurs until we write a hit, and there are no basic rules. When I 
started, we were confined to an octave and maybe a note, although 'Alexander's 
Ragtime Band' went beyond that. Then Jerome Kern came along and wrote two 
octaves, or an octave and three quarters. It didn't make a darn bit of 
difference because Jerome Kern had talent and a heart of gold and he just wrote 
great melodies. 
</P>
<P>
"I can give you all sorts of rules, but you may go home and break them all and 
write the biggest hit ever written. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a pro you write what you gotta write. Someone needs a ballad, you 
write a ballad. It's a matter of talent. Some of the biggest hits I've had were 
written because we needed a ballad in the publishing house. I've written many 
songs because the situation called for a boy and a girl to sing a love song. 
</P>
<P>
"Take 'Annie Get Your Gun.' Herbert and Dorothy Fields wrote the book about 
Annie Oakley, who was a fantastic rifle shot. The situations called for a love 
song, so I wrote 'They Say That Falling in Love Is Wonderful.' I thought that 
would be the big hit. We all felt 'I Got the Sun in the Mornin' would be a 
rhythm smash. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Annie Get Your Gun' has 16 songs. It's a true story. Frank Butler was the 
world's greatest marksman with a rifle. But when Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, 
in which Butler starred, came to town, little Annie Oakley beat him. Buffalo 
Bill asked Annie to join his show but she didn't want to leave home. 
</P>
<P>
"I had to write a song that would sell her on the idea of coming along . . . 
the glories of riding on a train. The excitement. I tried to wrap it up in one 
phrase, and the phrase was 'There's No Business Like Show Business.' I wrote it 
as a throwaway song to advance the story line. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't plan it as an anthem for show business. But, according to my ASCAP 
survey, it is my most-performed song. Not the biggest record seller, but the 
most-performed." 
</P>
<P>
"If you're a professional songwriter, you write. You write in the morning, you 
write at night, you write in a taxi or on the subway. You have it in your mind 
until you're finished, and even after it's finished. It may turn out to be very 
bad. I have songs written years ago that I'd still like to change. 
</P>
<P>
"A professional songwriter doesn't work business hours. He subconsciously 
gathers material and ideas all the time. I don't have a notebook filled with 
titles or these ideas, but they're tucked away somewhere in memory. 
</P>
<P>
"There's one thing about longevity in this business. You don't get 
holier-than-thou. You don't give something to the public with the attitude 
that, well, here it is and you damn better like it. You try to guess what they 
want and then try to please them." 
</P>
<P>
"(George M. Cohan) was my ideal," Berlin said. "I tried to write like him. He 
was the fellow who supplied special material to the guys who sang in the 
saloons when I was a kid. I started by writing parodies of current songs by 
other composers -- at first I just wrote lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a bit older I became a singing waiter, and I want you to know I was 
a pretty good one. At least, I thought I was pretty good until we made the 
movie version of 'This Is The Army' at Warner Brothers in which I sang 'Oh, How 
I Hate to Get Up in the Morning.' An electrician heard my prerecording and said 
that if the guy who wrote that song could hear this fellow sing it he'd turn 
over in his grave." 
</P>
<P>
"My interest is principally in the creation of songs," Berlin once told me. 
"But we live in a country and society that is based on free enterprise. Just 
try buying a painting by Picasso or Cezanne and see what you'll be charged." 
Around 1944, Berlin bought up copyrights to all his songs. They are still owned 
by his estate. He refused more than one offer in the hundreds of millions of 
dollars for his catalogue, claiming he would not know what to do with the money 
and the would-be purchasers would not know what to do with his music. 
</P>
<P>
At his death, Berlin was still living in the house on Beekman Place in New York 
which he purchased in 1946 from its builder and original owner, the late James 
Forrestal, one-time Navy Secretary. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to rent it but we couldn't, so we bought it," he remembered. "It's 
on the East River in what is supposed to be a fashionable neighborhood. But the 
East River doesn't impress me because they picked me out of the East River when 
I was a kid . . . a little lower downtown, perhaps, but still the same river, 
tugboats and all." 
</P>
<P>
During his life Berlin stubbornly resisted all offers to use his life story as 
the basis for a Broadway musical or film. He told me that when he died his 
children could make such a decision, if they chose. 
</P>
<P>
"My private life is private, but I'll be very happy to talk about it," he said 
puckishly. "We have a nice corner house in New York. We spend out summers in 
the Catskills, and we go there in winter, too. There's lots of deer up there. 
And snow. 
</P>
<P>
"I seldom relax. My hobby is songwriting. My wife and I used to go dancing, but 
we'd sooner sit and talk. I'm not a good dancer. I'm a very big eater. I like 
good food. I like to cook but they tell me I cook badly. I've found if you buy 
good meat you should leave it alone -- the same as with a good song. Don't do 
too big of an arrangement." 
</P>
<P>
Berlin said the most important advice he would offer aspiring songwriters was, 
"Never throw anything away." 
</P>
<P>
"During World War I, I wrote a song at Camp Upton for a soldier show called 
'Yip, Yip Yaphank'," he said. "I intended it as the finale but we didn't use 
it. It went into the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1938 I was in London for the opening of 'Alexander's Ragtime Band.' It was 
September, near the time Neville Chamberlain came back from meeting Hitler with 
his piece of paper about peace in our time. 
</P>
<P>
"I was distraught about the threat of war, and when I returned to New York I 
wanted to write a patriotic song. I wrote one called 'Thanks, America,' but it 
was a very sad song. 
</P>
<P>
"But the word 'America' recalled the song I wrote 20 years earlier at Camp 
Upton. I hauled it out of the trunk and rewrote it. The first 16 bars and the 
last eight are exactly as they were written originally, but I changed the 
middle because I wanted to write a song about peace, not about war. 
</P>
<P>
"A short time afterwards, when Kate Smith asked me to write a patriotic song 
for her, I just gave her the revised version of the old song." 
</P>
<P>
Thus was "God Bless America" rescued from the scrap heap. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my personal favorite song." 
</P>
<P>
When last we talked, Berlin seemed interested in dispelling a myth about his 
keyboard ability. 
</P>
<P>
"People think I can only play that special piano with the movable keyboard. I 
play in the key of F sharp, which are the black keys. Years ago all fakers 
played that way. We played by ear, and the publishing companies had these 
transposing pianos because we could not transpose. We really could not write 
music. 
</P>
<P>
"For me F sharp happened because the black keys are right under your fingers. 
But as I progressed, I got to know the relative keys. I took lessons once or 
twice but I wasn't any good. 
</P>
<P>
"George M. Cohan had a couple of transposing pianos. He played in the key of C, 
which is also supposed to be easy. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, I began composing away from the piano. I developed a system 
whereby I envisioned the keyboard in my mind, and I could encode the proper 
notes on paper. I work mainly with ideas. I write words and music together, one 
phrase at a time. But I can play any piano." 
</P>
<P>
Today Berlin's old moveable piano stands mute in the Smithsonian Institution in 
Washington.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Theater:
   Bolcom and Weinstein's Gambling Gangster
   ----

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A20

<LP>
   Philadelphia -- The timing certainly was fortuitous for
the opening of William Bolcom and Arnold Weinstein's new
musical, "Casino Paradise," presented by the American Music
Theater Festival here on Sunday. While fictional gangsters
overran a quiet seaside town with casino gambling on the
stage of the Plays and Players Theatre in Philadelphia,
Donald Trump was opening the Taj Mahal, his latest
contribution to that art, at the other end of Atlantic City
Expressway. But in this case, truth packed more punch than
fiction. Trump's slot machines broke down from overuse and
set off fireworks among would-be gamblers, but "Casino
Paradise," despite a host of terrific songs, was a fizzle.
   Mr. Bolcom, a classically trained composer with a gift for
the popular idiom, and his lyricist collaborator seemed like
an ideal pair to create a musical-theater antidote to all
those shows in which the sets, costumes and special effects
are more important than the music and the words. Their song
cycle, "Cabaret Songs," with its catchy, well-turned tunes
and sophisticated, wicked lyrics, is grateful to singers and
entertaining to audiences. Unfortunately, "Casino Paradise"
is rather like a full evening of "Cabaret Songs." It has all
that clever tunefulness and verbal agility, but little book
or character development.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Casino Paradise," set in an unspecified time and era, is
about a gangster-tycoon, J.J. Ferguson (Timothy Nolen), who
buys up a seaside town and brings in gambling, winning over
its inhabitants with blackmail and transparent promises that
as he gets richer, they will too. He is opposed by his
confused, quasi-countercultural son, Stanley (Eddie Korbich),
whose motives stem as much from hatred of his father as from
sympathy for the little guy, and adored by his greedy and
equally confused daughter, Cis (Janet Metz). An ensemble of
weak-willed townspeople/gamblers wavers between J.J. and
Stanley. J.J. gets Stanley sentenced to jail for crimes he
did not commit, so Stanley shoots Dad, and gets put away for
good.
   In Act II, Stanley wakes up from a yearlong coma, during
which he has been tended by a mysterious nurse (Joan Morris)
and undergone a change of heart. Stanley escapes from jail to
fall in love (sort of) with a transvestite prostitute (Keith
Curran). Unaccountably turned even more rapacious than his
father in the interim, Stanley now wants to wrest control of
J.J.'s empire from Cis and her husband (Walter Hudson), who
have been cooking the books while J.J. was out of commission.
J.J., who has ceased to care, dies as the casino -- "this
Club Med of the living dead" -- burns down.
   Lots of promising material here, but alas, not a
"Mahagonny" for the '90s, although its themes recall the
Brecht-Weill opera of 1930. Plot points are told, not acted,
and big chunks of motivation are missing. Why does Stanley do
such a complete about-face? Who is the nurse, besides a part
for Ms. Morris, Mr. Bolcom's gifted wife and duo partner?
Thomas Babe was called in, too late, as play doctor on
"Casino Paradise."
   With a solid frame to hold them together, Messrs. Bolcom
and Weinstein's splendidly inventive songs might have added
up to a terrific show. As it is, there are too many songs
following closely upon each other, and their popular rhythms
(tangos, fox trots, rhumbas, ballads) make them sound alike.
   Mr. Weinstein certainly has a way with words, and you want
to catch every one. Who can resist the love song "I'll Be By"
(sung by Stanley to the transvestite, Sunny), which has the
lyric, "Any bridge you're burning/Any trick you're turning/No
one but me shall lay his head/On your well-traveled thigh."
One was thus doubly grateful for Ms. Morris's crystal-clear
diction: Her shapely ballad "The Nurse's Song" was another
high point.
   Timothy Nolen's frayed upper register and insufficiently
imposing stage presence left J.J. a cipher, and Mr. Korbich
was weak and whiny as Stanley. The evening perked up with the
tall, hairy-chested, bearded Mr. Curran in a
spaghetti-strapped hooker's shift and sequined handbag, and
Ms. Metz as a Daddy's girl turned vicious in her blood-red
wedding gown (Candice Donnelly did the costumes). David
Alden's direction stressed economy of movement and symbolic
gesture over naturalism on the bare-bones set, echoing the
show's depiction of the characters as types, not people.
Michael Barrett led an able instrumental ensemble.
   "Casino Paradise" recalls Mr. Bolcom's gargantuan "Songs
of Innocence and Experience," produced several years ago at
the Brooklyn Academy of Music, in which the composer seemed
too carried away by all his wonderful ideas he had to think
about and how they would hang together. His streamlined,
jazzy violin concerto, on the other hand, like "Cabaret
Songs," successfully represents Mr. Bolcom in a more focused
mood. The next Bolcom/Weinstein production, a full-scale
opera called "McTeague," based on the Frank Norris novel of
1899 about a renegade dentist and his covetous wife, now
being written for a 1992 production at the Chicago Lyric
Opera, already has enlisted a scenario from Robert Altman. Is
Mr. Bolcom beginning to see the light?

<TEXT>
   Ninety years after James Weldon
Johnson wrote ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' for a group of school
children, the song known as the ``Black National Anthem'' has been
given new life by a group of well-known artists and singers.
   The recording, recently released as a single by Capitol Records,
features such artists as Stevie Wonder, Anita Baker, Bobby Brown,
Jeffrey Osbourne and Dionne Warwick. Each artist has a solo on the
recording, similar to the format used by Quincy Jones on the hit
``We Are the World'' record.
   Melba Moore, the Tony Award-winning actress and singer, was the
creative force behind the new recording of the song written by
Johnson, a lawyer, educator and civil rights leader who was born in
Jacksonville. Two versions of the song are included on her new
``Soul Exposed'' LP.
   Moore recently talked about the project in an interview.
   ``The original was really a hymn. The new one has a contemporary
sound. It sounds like a love song,'' Moore said.
   She said she told BeBe Winans about her idea to enlist the help
of other artists, and the gospel Grammy winner quickly contacted
musicians and singers and even took a sound engineer on the road to
record celebrities' voices for the recording.
   Also appearing on the record are Freddie Jackson, Take 6, Howard
Hewett, Stephanie Mills, BeBe and CeCe Winans, the Clark Sisters,
Terri Lynne Carrington and Gerald Albright.
   On the longer version of the song, the Rev. Jesse Jackson also
participates. In addition, actress and choreographer Debbie Allen
directed a video in which Jasmine Guy (``A Different World'')
dances to the song, with narration by Lou Gossett Jr.
   Moore said ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' has been one of her
favorite songs for a number of years, and she's performed it at
meetings of the National Council of Negro Women.
   In the liner notes for the album, Dr. Benjamin Hooks, executive
director of the NAACP, said, ``Every time I hear `Lift Every Voice
and Sing,' I am filled with a deep sense of pride. Ms. Moore's
treatment of this classic ... gives it new zest, vitality and
meaning.
   ``More than any other song, it represents our brave struggle for
freedom and equality, and the faith that has sustained us over all
these weary years. It is part of us, part of our culture and a
treasure to be loved and cherished.''
   Johnson wrote the lyrics to ``Lift Every Voice and Sing,'' and
his brother, J. Rosamond Johnson, an accomplished musician, wrote
the music, for the Stanton School celebration of Abraham Lincoln's
birthday in 1900. A chorus of 500 black children sang the tune.
   Within 20 years, it was known around the world. The song became
an anthem for black Americans during the civil rights movement in
the 1960s.
   A portion of the proceeds of the album are being donated to the
NAACP, the United Negro College Fund and the National Association
for Sickle Cell Disease, Moore said.
   Moore, who was a schoolteacher in Newark, N.J., before going on
to star in Broadway productions of ``Hair,'' ``Timbuktu'' and
``Purlie,'' said she hopes that young people take to the new
version. It was important, she said, that children learn about
Johnson's contributions to American culture.
   ``He is one of our heroes. As far as writers go, everyone knowns
Langston Hughes and James Weldon Johnson,'' Moore said.
   James Weldon Johnson was a lawyer, author, civil rights
activist, educator, foreign consul and newspaper editor. There was
no high school for blacks in Jacksonville, so Johnson was sent to
Atlanta University to complete his education.
   After graduation in 1894, he returned to Jacksonville and became
principal of Stanton School, which he expanded into a high school
for black students.
   Johnson said he was not confronted with racial discrimination
until he was an adolescent.
   ``Neither my father nor mother had taught me directly anything
about race. ... My vague, early impressions constituted ... an
unconscious race-superiority complex. All the most interesting
things ... were being done by colored men,'' he wrote.
   Johnson started the first daily black newspaper in Florida, the
Daily American. He was the first black to pass the Florida Bar exam
and be permitted to practice.
   In 1901, he moved to New York City, where he and his brother
collaborated on 200 songs for musical comedies and light operas,
including``Congo Love Song'' and ``Since You Went Away.''
   As secretary to the NAACP from 1920 to 1930, he conducted the
first statistical analysis of lynching, exposed U.S. Marine
terrorism in Haiti and fought for the passage of the Dyer
Anti-Lynching Bill.
   Johnson served as consul in both Venezuela and Nicaragua, and
was the author of ``God's Trombones,'' ``The Autobiography of an
Ex-Colored Man,'' ``Along This Way'' and numerous other books and
articles.
   In January 1988, a postal stamp was issued in Johnson's memory
in a ceremony at Fisk University in Nashville, Tenn., where he had
been a professor from 1930 until his death in 1938.

   Most people won't recognize her name, but
Helen Stearns collaborated on several songs with her brother-in-law.
   The brother-in-law was Hoagy Carmichael, who composed such
legendary songs as ``Star Dust,'' ``Lazybones,'' and ``Georgia On
My Mind.'' He died in 1981.
   ``I loved to listen to him play,'' Stearns said. ``He'd be
sitting there pecking around on the piano and he'd come up with a
tune and say, `You're the writer. Give me some words.' So I did
sometimes. We wrote a lot of songs together, mostly children's
songs.''
   ``April In My Heart'' was one of their best.
   ``I didn't think much about it at the time, but I still get
small royalty checks for it from time to time,'' she said.
   Stearns, 82, was back in Carmichael's native state over the
weekend in conjunction with a retrospective concert by the Indiana
Symphony Orchestra.
   ``You know, there's something about Hoosiers that is
wholesome,'' she said. ``No matter where they go or what they do,
they carry it with them. That's what I remember about Hoagy. He was
always wholesome in that odd Hoosier way.
   ``That, I guess, and his music were what I liked most about
him.''
   Stearns was one of the ``Barclay Girls'' who modeled for artist
McLelland Barclay in the 1930s, wrote screenplays that included the
hit 1937 movie ``I Met Him In Paris,'' and later worked as a
newspaper editor in California and Maine, and as a writer, editor
and publisher of children's books.

   Jiang Xi Reng, best known for his portrayal
of the lord chamberlain in the 1986 film ``The Last Emperor,'' is
helping to organize a theater exchange program that was delayed by
China's political crackdown.
   The exchange between the Children's Theatre Company and the
Children's Art Theatre of Shanghai had been announced last spring.
   Jiang, a 30-year veteran of the Children's Art Theatre of
Shanghai, will play the wizard Gandalf in the Children's Theatre
Company's staging of ``The Hobbit.'' The production, directed by
CTC artistic director Jon Cranney, goes into rehearsal Tuesday for
an April 20 opening.
   In May 1991, Cranney and a team of designers stage the Theater
Company's version of ``The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins'' in
Shanghai.
   The Children's Art Theatre is the oldest children's theater
company in China. It was established in 1947 by Madame Soong Ching
Ling, wife of Sun Yat-sen, founder of modern China
   The exchange is an outgrowth of meetings that took place a year
ago between Cranney and Jin An Ge, his counterpart with the
Shanghai company. Plans were shelved, however, after the June
massacre in Beijing against advocates of democracy, and the two
artistic directors did not meet again until February.
   Plans for a joint production to tour China and Japan are
incomplete.
   Because relations between the U.S. and Chinese governments
remain strained, neither company has sought government assistance.

   The first black Miss USA says she's not a
``stereotypical all-American winner,'' and being raised by a single
parent on tough streets is a handicap that can be overcome.
   ``I had not the happiest of upbringings, but you don't have to
become a statistic just because you grew up in a broken home,''
20-year-old Carole Gist told reporters Monday.
   Miss Gist, of Detroit, dreams of setting up a fine arts
institute for underprivileged children who, she says, are too often
taught to think ``the only way you can get ahead now is in sports.''
   She was chosen Friday from among 51 women competing for $200,000
in cash and prizes and the chance to represent the United States in
the 38th annual Miss Universe pageant in Hollywood on April 15.
   A junior in management and marketing at the Northwood Institute,
she said being black helped her ``stand out over all the blond,
blue-eyed women there.''
   But she said it was likely she was much different in other ways,
too.
   Raised by her mother, she moved often and sometimes lived in
rough neighborhoods.
   ``My home was broken into a lot,'' she said. ``When I was 5, I
remember seeing a burglar in my home and I was frightened to
death.''

   Stormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver
transplant recipient, remained in fair condition Monday two weeks
after her second liver transplant.
   Doctors said the 12-year-old girl's condition was upgraded from
serious to fair Sunday at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   Stormie, of White Settlement, Texas, received a new heart and
liver at Children's on Feb. 14, 1984, to control a condition in
which her cholesterol level was 10 times higher than normal.
   Doctors decided to implant a new liver Feb. 20 after Stormie's
first transplanted liver was damaged by hepatitis caused by an
unknown virus. Her donor heart was not affected by the disease.

   Watching the new movie, ``Imagine: John
Lennon,'' was very painful for the late Beatle's wife, Yoko Ono.
   ``The only reason why I did watch it to the end is because I'm
responsible for it, even though somebody else made it,'' she said.
Cassettes, film footage and other elements of the acclaimed movie
were collected by Ono.
   She also took cassettes of interviews by Lennon, which were
edited in such a way that he narrates the picture. Andrew Solt
(``This Is Elvis'') directed, Solt and David L. Wolper produced and
Solt and Sam Egan wrote it.
   ``I think this is really the definitive documentary of John
Lennon's life,'' Ono said in an interview. ``What John was really
about is depicted in this film, very accurately and without
whitewashing.
   ``I did view it. I didn't have them take any footage out.
   ``I wanted the truth. In the sense you had to put a 40-year life
into an hour and a half; balance is a very serious consideration. I
think they did a remarkable job and very tastefully so.''
   There is a soundtrack album and a coffeetable book with comments
primarily by Lennon, tied in with the film and using the same title.

   ``Imagine'' is more than a Lennon elegy. Though it fails to
delve too deeply into the darker side of Lennon and the Beatles
(drug use, abusive tempers, manager Brian Epstein's death), it does
capture the music and the times in which Lennon lived.
   One intriguing episode in ``Imagine'' shows cartoonist Al Capp
(``L'il Abner'') being antagonistic toward the Lennons during their
bed-in, when they stayed in bed for a week to publicize their
concern for peace.
   ``We were naive,'' Ono said. ``A lot of things happened because
we were naive. Maybe that was our strength. To us, Al Capp was just
a cartoonist and you naturally assume a cartoonist is liberal, with
a sense of humor. We didn't expect hostility.
   ``Al Capp is one incident that was filmed. In those days we did
numerous interviews because of our stand for world peace. ... There
were some very rough interviews. The hostility that was shown to us
bluntly by reporters in those days was incredible. Each time, I
think we were hurt.''
   Ono said Lennon wrote the song ``Imagine'' in 1969 or '70. ``We
did the bed-in, the Toronto Peace Festival, the `War's Over'
billboard. He was saying we need an anthem for this whole concept
of world peace. I think it's one of the songs that will really go
on forever in people's minds.''

   ``Imagine there's no countries
   ``It isn't hard to do
   ``Nothing to kill or die for

   ``You may say i'm a dreamer
   ``But i'm not the only one
   ``i hope someday you'll join us
   ``and the world be as one.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Lennon was born Oct. 9, 1940. He was shot and killed outside his
Manhattan apartment on Dec. 8, 1980.
   Ono was a painter when Lennon met her. She later joined him in
music and in public demonstrations for peace.
   ``I think that for somebody like me, because I feel that I'm an
artist and a creative artist, that it is a very strange turn of
events that I'm known as a widow,'' she said.
   ``But it is stranger to me that I'm not that disturbed by it. I
think that John promoted my work a lot in his lifetime and somehow
it seems like it is a pleasure for me to sort of still work in a
context of a partnership with him. ... I think it is my turn to
promote him. He promoted me.''
   When Albert Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon'' was published
in September, depicting the former Beatle as riddled with vices,
faults and neuroses, Ono called it ``totally fiction.''
   Since then she's received a tremendous amount of support from
friends and fans. ``I was very touched and thankful that people
sent letters to me and extended hands at this time, very warmly. I
really appreciate that. I was also surprised that so many people
stood up against it (the Goldman book). I didn't expect that,'' Ono
said.
   Lennon's half sister, Julia Baird, also has written a new book,
``John Lennon, My Brother.'' She has no idea how many books have
been written about Lennon; she's been sent some of them but hasn't
read them. ``I know the life and it is too painful to read somebody
else's version.''
   There's still enough footage, Ono said, for another movie _
perhaps a music or political or art film. And there's another big
John Lennon project on her horizon.
   ``It's from unpublished songs which were written for a Broadway
musical. I don't know if it would have gotten to Broadway. You aim
for the stars, you know. The songs might be strung together. They
might become a record, might eventually become a musical. There are
enough finished songs. They were never recorded in the studio.
They're on cassettes.''
   Their son Sean, 13, like his older half-brother, Julian, has
become interested in music and started playing guitar.
   ``I had reservations about Sean going into the music field. I
still do. But I kind of gave up on it,'' Ono said.
   ``He is into guitar now. A session musician, a very good one,
was teaching him. According to this teacher, it seems like he is
very good. He is just totally involved in it, listening to Eric
Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, his dad's songs _ only for guitar playing, I
think.
   ``He is into it so much, good luck to him.''

<HEAD>NY City Opera's Musical Comedy Season Offers `Music Man'</HEAD>

   That masterpiece of music comedy and nostalgic
Americana, ``The Music Man,'' suffered from a lack of strong, clear
singing as the New York City Opera opened its annual season of
musical comedy.
   The acting, directing, dancing and scenery were first-rate
Tuesday at the New York State Theater. But some of the verve and
excitement of those glorious, fast-paced songs was lost during the
first act as the singing did not carry well over the orchestra.
   The problem was alleviated after intermission. Perhaps it was
the shift to mostly ballads, or perhaps the level of the singers'
microphones had been boosted, but Act 2 was the rich, delightful
experience one hopes the whole show will be for the rest of its run
through April 10.
   Bob Gunton, debuting with the company as Harold Hill, had the
most trouble. A Broadway performer, he moves as gracefully as a
dancer and sold his ``76 Trombones'' to the folks of River City
with more charm than brass. But his light voice didn't project in
Act 1's ``Ya Got Trouble'' and ``The Sadder but Wiser Girl.''
   The female chorus also was difficult to understand in
``Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little,'' and the townspeople blurred the
words of joyful anticipation in ``The Wells Fargo Wagon.'' David
Burdick, smaller than most boys who play the lisping Winthrop, also
is no belter, and didn't get his words across the footlights.
   Opera singers learn to project their voices and they came out
best, making themselves understood and never sounding too operatic
for the music. Leigh Munro was a pretty and sympathetic Marian the
librarian, Muriel Costa-Greenspon a natural leader of ladies as the
mayor's wife, Richard McKee as the pompous mayor, James Billings as
Harold Hill's cohort, Brooks Almy as Marian's mother and William
Ledbetter as the constable.
   The dancing chorus was splendid, with choreography by Marcia
Milgrom Dodge, making her company debut. There's a generous amount
of dancing, in the library, in rehearsals for a ``social,'' in the
center of town several times. David Jenkins' set of business
buildings pulled back to give the dancers room. Andrew Marlay's
costumes for 1912 were glorious, from feathered hats to peppermint
suits for the four school board members who squabbled every minute
they weren't harmonizing ``Lida Rose.''
   Donald Pippin, a Broadway conductor, was conducting at the New
York City Opera for the first time. It was wonderful to hear the
overture played by a big orchestra, less wonderful later when words
were covered.
   The late Meredith Willson wrote the book, music and lyrics. He
and Frank Lacey wrote the plot, which came out as a memory of
bygone innocent days of Mason City, Iowa, where Willson grew up.
One wonderful song follows another _ ``Goodnight, My Someone,''
``My White Knight,'' ``Till There Was You'' _ and the audience
greeted each gem like a reunion with a long-lost best friend.

   The last time foreign correspondent Thomas L.
Friedman won a Pulitzer Prize he said the moment was marred because
he received the news while covering the bombing of the American
Embassy in Beirut.
   On Thursday, though, the second Pulitzer for international
reporting for The New York Times writer was ``unalloyed, untinged
by any tragedy,'' Friedman said as he and others winners across the
country celebrated their honors.
   In 1983, Friedman, then the Beirut bureau chief for the Times,
was told of the award he received for his stories about the Israeli
invasion of Lebanon as he was covering the embassy disaster.
   ``It was a moment very much bittersweet for someone living in
Beirut, with friends in the embassy,'' he said.
   This time, he received a telephone call from Max Frankel, the
Times' executive editor, as he worked on a book at his home in
Jerusalem.
   Champagne corks popped in newsrooms across the land.
   ``If I can win the Pulitzer Prize, the Cleveland Indians can win
the pennant this summer,'' said the Wall Street Journal's Walt
Bogdanich, who won for specialized reporting. WSJ writers Daniel
Hertzberg and James B. Stewart also won for explanatory journalism.
   ``This place looks like a locker room after a World Series
victoy,'' said Jacqui Banaszynski of the St. Paul Pioneer Press
Dispatch newsroom after she won for feature writing for her series
on an AIDS victim in a farm community.
   Champagne also flowed at the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune, a 60,000
circulation daily in Massachusetts that won the general news
reporting prize for stories on a furloughed murderer who assaulted
a Maryland couple.
   ``This is pretty big for us. We're just a nice community
newspaper,'' said Susan Forrest, one of the Lawrence staffers who
worked on the story.
   Tom Shales of the Washington Post, the criticism winner for his
writing on television, said he was ``in a state of slack-jawed
dumbfoundness.''
   ``It's nice to be in the World Almanac permanently,'' said
Boston University historian Robert V. Bruce, who won the Pulitzer
in history for his book, ``The Launching of Modern Science
1846-1876.''
   Toni Morrison, winner of the fiction award for ``Beloved,'' said
joy was uppermost in her feelings because, ``I really was thinking
dark and difficult thoughts about what was available to this book
in terms of recognition.''
   The book sparked controversy when it did not win two other major
literary prizes. Ms. Morrison said she respected the Pulitzer
committee for ignoring ``outside matters of speculation and gossip
and some slander.''
   University of Michigan music professor William Bolcom said,
``It's better than a kick in the teeth,'' after he won the Pulitzer
for music for ``12 New Etudes for Piano,'' a tribute to the late
pianist Paul Jacobs.
   But Bolcom, who said he was disturbed by the ``prize mentality''
of the public, planned a subdued celebration.
   ``I put a bottle of champagne in the ice box,'' he said. ``The
local paper is coming over to take a picture of me sipping it.
We'll have dinner, take baths and go to bed.''
   At The Miami Herald, Pulitzers were taken home by humorist Dave
Barry and photographer Michel duCille, a second-time winner who
this time won for photos of apartments inundated by the drug crack,
a potent form of cocaine.
   ``I don't want to lessen the Pulitzers, but I feel more proud
that the photos ... made changes in the community,'' duCille said.
   Barry said he hopes winning the Pulitzer ``will make me taller.''
   He recalled he once wrote a column making fun of the Pulitzer
awards, saying that ``horrendously long, complicated''
Pulitzer-entry stories should have editor's notes warning readers
to avoid them.
   Charlotte Observer Managing Editor Mark Ethridge III said he
hoped the PTL story that brought the newspaper one of two Pulitzer
prizes was ``not a story that comes along just once in a lifetime.''
   The Observer's Doug Marlette also won a Pulitzer for his
editorial cartooning in Charlotte and at the Atlanta Constitution,
where he now works.
   Scott Shaw, a 24-year-old photographer for the Odessa (Texas)
American, said he was surprised to win the spot news award for his
coverage of the 58-hour operation that rescued little Jessica
McClure and fascinated a nation.
   ``I am pretty young. I am just pretty surprised,'' said Shaw.

Instead of dropping coins into a jukebox at their booth, a duo who parody 
Top-40 songs can create their own tunes at a Sherman Oaks '50s-style diner. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Duke of Earl' could be 'Quart of Oil,' " says Gary Kleinman, 36, who looks 
like a skinny version of actor Ted Danson. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Dream Lover' would be 'No Such Thing,' " says Kleinman's partner in parody, 
Charles Laszlo, "and 'Chantilly Lace' could be 'I Lost the Race,' for the L.A. 
Marathon." 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo &amp; Gary, who became known for their parodies in 1985 with 
"Su-Sushi-O," a takeoff on Phil Collins' "Sussudio," are anticipating another 
hit during National Secretary's Week, which begins Monday. "My Boss Is Lazy," a 
parody of the Fine Young Cannibals' song "She Drives Me Crazy," is being 
considered for morning-drive play on local contemporary and rock music stations 
such as KQLZ-FM (100.3). The parody already has aired on KLSX-FM's (97.1) "The 
Dr. Demento Show," as well as that show's nationally syndicated version. 
Between gulps of a chocolate malt, Laszlo, a 36-year-old Reseda resident with 
the rapid-fire wit of a teen-age class clown, explains the plight of morning 
drivers. "People drive and think, 'I've only got 26 years, eight months and 
three days before retirement, I've got to pay electric bills, etc.' We want 
people to laugh instead." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone can identify with this song," adds Gary, who lives in Canoga Park. "I 
don't care how high up the ladder you are, you think you have a boss that is 
lazy." 
</P>
<P>
The song features hapless employee Doodlesby, whose voice reminds one of Radar 
O'Reilly, talking with his employer, Mr. Calhoun. The belligerent boss demands 
that Doodlesby work out for him as well as fax his briefcase. Lyrics include: 
"He's a lazy dweeb/ He wrote the book/ He needs two desks/ One for his foot." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Demento, a.k.a. Barry Hansen, praised the song and its creators. "It's a 
good song, and the response to it has been good," he said. "I put Laszlo &amp; 
Gary in the class of professional jobs. I get all kinds of songs sent to me, 
like people who just sing along with Michael Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo &amp; Gary record all parodies from scratch, rather than recording over 
someone else's music, which is why "My Boss Is Lazy" took about 50 hours 
instead of about four to produce. They write their pieces together. Laszlo 
performs the character voices, and Gary handles the music and singing voices. 
Occasionally, putting together parodies drives them to extremes. 
</P>
<P>
"One Sunday, we were doing a parody and needed the sound of a Mack truck," Gary 
says. "We needed the sound effect by Monday morning. We followed a Mack truck 
for 90 minutes down the freeway, trying to get him to blow his horn. He finally 
did it." 
</P>
<P>
The two got together in 1978 when Detroit-native Laszlo -- who majored in 
radio, TV and film production at Wayne State University -- answered an ad Gary 
placed in a magazine. He moved west to create a radio commercial with Gary, who 
earned a bachelor's degree in finance from Cal State Northridge in 1974. They 
wrote radio jingles and performed as stand-up comics until 1985, when they 
decided to concentrate solely on song parodies. Since radio stations do not pay 
them for their work, they also have day jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"We won't tell you what they are," Laszlo says. "But we're either waiters or 
corporate executives." 
</P>
<P>
The key to a successful parody, both agree, is an excessive familiarity with a 
popular song. "It should be a hit record that stations have played almost too 
much," Gary says. "Listeners can sing the lyrics, and then you hit them with 
something funny." 
</P>
<P>
Laszlo &amp; Gary are preparing their first record album, which will combine 
parodies of popular songs with original creations. "We'd never do an album of 
all originals," Gary says. "They'd have to be exceptionally funny, since they 
aren't familiar." Gary says that three small pop/rock/urban record companies 
are interested in making the album. 
</P>
<P>
One song scheduled to be included, "I'm a Sensitive '90s Guy," a pop takeoff of 
Christine Lavin's "Sensitive New Age Guys," parodies the touchy-feely crystal 
age. "I like to cry at weddings/I think Rambo is upsetting," the song broods. 
</P>
<P>
And once they exhaust Top-40 songs and their original ideas, what will Laszlo 
&amp; Gary parody? "Probably marching bands and sound effects," Gary says. 
</P>
<P>
But his partner has other ideas. "Sports fishermen and parodies with 
subtitles," says Laszlo.

<HEAD>`Once on This Island,' A New Musical, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>

   ``Once on This Island'' is as endearing as it is
exotic, a lush little musical set in the French Antilles but
telling a love story that has universal appeal.
   Credit director Graciela Daniele and the songwriting team of
Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty. The show, which arrived over the
weekend at off-Broadway's Playwrights Horizons, explodes with music
and motion. It never stops, thanks to Daniele's exuberant direction
and the nearly continuous use of song and dance.
   This bittersweet fairy tale, based on the novel ``My Love, My
Love,'' by Trinidad-born writer Rosa Guy, tells of the doomed
romance between a simple peasant girl and a wealthy young man. But
it's not condescending or simplistic in its treatment of the
ill-fated lovers. And Ahrens, who adapted the book and wrote the
lyrics, has come up with a leading female character an audience can
cheer. In a season of such effective but emotionally cold musicals
like ``City of Angels'' and ``Grand Hotel,'' that's something rare.
   Ti Moune is the sweetest Caribbean heroine since Ottilie, a role
played by the wonderful Diahann Carroll in Harold Arlen's ``House
of Flowers'' years ago. It's a sympathetic part played to
perfection by a performer with a dazzling smile and an unusual
name, La Chanze.
   The dark-skinned Ti Moune falls for Daniel, the mulatto son of
an island landowner, and saves his life when his sports car crashes
on a winding road. She nurses him back to health, but eventually
the barriers of class and color prove to be too much.
   In Ti Moune's quest for love, she is helped _ and occasionally
hindered _ by a quartet of rambunctious and rowdy gods, deities of
water, earth, love and death. They add a touch of supernatural to
the plot, an other-worldly quality that gives the story much of its
charm.
   The score is completely different from ``Lucky Stiff,'' a daffy,
dumb-fun musical that Ahrens and Flaherty wrote for Playwrights
Horizons several seasons ago. The title character in that show was
a corpse that refused to stay put, and the witty music reflected
the musical's farcical nature.
   Flaherty's music for ``Once on This Island'' is more expansive
and romantic. It embraces a wide range of styles from calypso, like
in the gutsy ``Mama Will Provide,'' to more traditional theater
love songs like ``Forever Yours.'' Ahrens' lyrics are unforced and
fit the music beautifully.
   Daniele has gotten strong ensemble performances from the rest of
the cast, fine singers and dancers all. Particularly effective are
Eric Riley, a sensuous demon of death, and Kecia Lewis-Evans, as a
big-voiced Earth Mother.
   The director's production team _ set designer Loy Arcenas,
costume designer Judy Dearing and lighting designer Allen Lee
Hughes _ has created an atmospheric island environment. A deep blue
set, painted with primitive trees and birds, fills the small stage
and embraces the actors.
   So does Daniele's inventive choreography which becomes an
important part of the story. The dances swirl throughout ``Once on
This Island,'' turning the stage into a tropical never-never land
that won't disappear from memory even after the curtain has fallen.

   Aaron Copland, the pioneering
composer who used folk songs and jazz in writing plainspoken
classics such as ``Appalachian Spring,'' ``Lincoln Portrait'' and
``Billy the Kid,'' died Sunday at age 90.
   Copland, who lived in Peekskill, died at Phelps Memorial
Hospital in Westchester from pneumonia with respiratory failure
following two recent strokes, hospital spokeswoman Ann Marie
Treanor said Sunday night.
   Admired by colleagues as the ``dean of American music,'' Copland
was a major force in gaining international recognition for the
nation's 20th century composers. His honors included a Pulitzer
Prize, a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Guggenheim Foundation's
first music fellowship and an Oscar.
   Vivian Perlis, with whom he wrote his memoir, said Copland ``had
the unusual ability to reach a wide audience and at the same time
he composed some of the masterworks of the century that were highly
respected by other musicians.''
   She added: ``He put American music on the map. He decided that
there should be an American sound, a place for the American
composer.''
   Among his better known works were the score for ``The Red
Pony,'' the 1949 movie based on the novel by John Steinbeck, and
``Lincoln Portrait,'' music performed with narration inspired by
the writing of Carl Sandberg.
   Other noted pieces included ``Fanfare for the Common Man,''
written in 1942.
   ``He was the composer who would lead American music out of the
wilderness,'' the late Leonard Bernstein wrote in High Fidelity
magazine for the occasion of Copland's 70th birthday. ``He was The
Leader, the one to whom the young always came with their
compositions.''
   Composer William Schumann said he, Copland and Bernstein were
close friends for many years and formed a ``triumvirate'' among
American composers.
   ``I think Aaron created the American sound in symphonic music,''
Schumann said. ``He has not only been for a half-century the
pre-eminent American composer, but a remarkable force as an
influence with younger composers.''
   He added: ``Copland believed in the validity of American music,
and that we were not inferior to our European cousins.''
   Copland wrote two operas, six ballets and eight film scores,
including his Oscar-winning music for William Wyler's ``The
Heiress'' in 1948. He was a pianist, conductor, author and
educator, guiding numerous musicians including Bernstein.
   Copland won his Pulitzer and the New York Music Critics Circle
Award in 1945 for ``Appalachian Spring,'' which he wrote for Martha
Graham to accompany her choreography based on a Hart Crane poem.
Among the composition's most famous themes: a Shaker melody played
by clarinet and followed by five variations.
   His ballets ``Billy the Kid'' and ``Rodeo'' also combined cowboy
tunes and folk songs with original themes.
   Despite his success, Copland stopped composing after 1967,
spending much of his time at his home and directing recordings of
his works.
   One reason for his decision to stop composing was the rejection
by young composers of his ``Inscape,'' his first attempt at the
highly structured, atonal 12-tone system.
   Born Nov. 14, 1900, Copland was the youngest of five children.
His parents, immigrants from Eastern Europe, owned a neighborhood
department store in Brooklyn.
   Copland's maternal grandfather, Aaron Mittenthal, moved to
Dallas and opened a dry goods store there in the 1870s. According
to Copland family lore, Jesse James' brother, Frank, worked in the
store, attracting customers but stealing the profits, forcing
Mittenthal to eeturn to New York.
   Perlis, co-author of his 1984 memoir ``Copland,'' suggests that
lineage is one reason a Jewish boy from Brooklyn could write cowboy
music, though he did not travel to the West until he was 28.
   Copland provided his own explanation: ``I preferred to imagine
being on a horse without actually getting on one!''
   His first work was a song composed at about age 8 for his
mother. About three years later, he gave up after two pages of
``Music for opera, Zenatello, Act I.'' His first complete work was
a song, ``Lola,'' written at age 14.
   But Copland's parents were reluctant to pay for music lessons.
   ``My parents were of the opinion that enough money had been
invested in the musical training of the four older children, with
meager results,'' he once recalled.
   Copland's persistence prevailed. At 16, he began harmony lessons
with Rubin Goldmark, who taught another Brooklynite, George
Gershwin.
   In 1920, Copland was the first to be accepted to the French
government's summer music school for Americans at the palace of
Fontainbleau. He studied harmony in Paris with Nadia Boulanger, and
sold a composition, ``The Cat and the Mouse,'' for $32.50.
   ``To finally see my music printed means more to me than any
debut in Carnegie Hall,'' he wrote home.
   Copland was part of a talented group of Americans who studied
with Boulanger, including Virgil Thompson, Walter Piston, Roy
Harris, David Diamond and Elliott Carter, who remembered Copland on
Sunday night as being ``extremely helpful to his musical
colleagues.''
   The brightest musical light in Paris when Copland was there was
Igor Stravinsky, whose pounding, primitive ballet ``The Rite of
Spring'' caused a riot at its 1913 premiere.
   Copland was struck by Stravinsky's use of Russian folk material:
``I have no doubt that this strongly influenced me to try to find a
way to a distinctively American music.''
   In 1923, Boulanger introduced Copland to Serge Koussevitzky, who
would take over the Boston Symphony Orchestra the next year.
Copland played his ``Cortege macabre'' on the piano, and composer
Serge Prokofiev, who was also at the house, blurted out ``Too much
bassi ostinati.''
   However, Koussevitzky promised to conduct the piece in Boston,
and asked Copland to compose an organ concerto for Boulanger. A
shaken Copland later asked his teacher, ``Do you really think I can
do it?''
   ``She pointed a finger at me. `You can do it.' And when
Mademoiselle said, `You can do it,' that was the end of the
discussion,'' Copland recalled.
   Copland returned to New York in 1924 to complete the ``Symphony
for Organ and Orchestra,'' which Boulanger premiered in New York in
1925 at her U.S. debut.
   Afterward, Copland recalled, conductor Walter Damrosch addressed
the audience: ``Ladies and gentlemen. I am sure you will agree that
if a gifted young man can write a symphony like this at 23 ...
within five years he will be ready to commit murder.''
   Copland laughed along with the audience, but for years Damrosch
worried whether the composer understood he was joking.
   The same year, Copland won the first Guggenheim Fellowship in
music, worth $2,500.
   Koussevitzky commissioned Copland's ``Music for the Theatre,''
and introduced his ``Piano Concerto,'' both jazz-inspired
compositions.
   The concerto, written in 1926, used frequently changing rhythms.
``I felt I had gone to the extreme of where jazz could take me, the
audiences and critics in Boston all thought I had gone too far,''
Copland recalled.
   In 1928, during his first trip to the West, Copland heard the
piece hissed during rehearsal and again in concert at the Hollywood
Bowl.
   His 1942 ``Rodeo'' launched Agnes DeMille in her dancing career.
   Copland also helped organize Cos Cob Press, which published
music of composers rejected by established publishers. He founded
the Young Composers' Group, which helped Thompson, Bernard Herrmann
and others.
   Copland never married and left no survivors.
   An old friend, the late playwright Harold Clurman, once told
Perlis that ``the only ambition I ever heard him remark on was, `I
want to be remembered.'''

<TEXT>
   John Wallowitch is a sophisticated sprite of
Manhattan, an impish composer, pianist and cabaret performer who
celebrates New York and chronicles its often bizarre customs and
mores.
   He sings the music of Gershwin, Porter, Kern, Rodgers and Berlin
too, but he also performs his own compositions, usually songs about
Manhattan filtered through the sensibilities of the 1960s, '70s and
'80s. He can lament the loneliness of big-city life in ``I Live
Alone Again,'' laugh at growing old in ``I'm 27,'' or luxuriate in
the pleasures of high living in ``Back on the Town.''
   The classically trained musician sings anywhere and with little
coaxing: in his cluttered, score-strewn apartment, once the home of
actress Katharine Cornell; on his weekly cable television show; in
tiny nightspots around town, or even on the street, where his
yearly serenadings of Irving Berlin _ a Beekman Place neighbor _
have attracted more and more media attention.
   The impeccable Wallowitch, who seems always to be dressed in
white shirt and bow tie, has worked since 1984 with Bertram Ross,
once a leading dancer in Martha Graham's company.
   ``We have tons of material,'' says Wallowitch, a fanatic
collector of old sheet music. ``Three separate evenings of theater
songs, including one about New York. I could go through a year and
not repeat one song _ which I have done.''
   With Wallowitch providing piano accompaniment, Ross can launch
into obscure Berlin comic ditties like ``Cohen Owes Me 97 Dollars''
or ``Sadie Salome Go Home.'' Wallowitch can handle a tender, lush
love song, ``Come A Little Closer,'' that he wrote himself. Or the
duo can rip through virtually unknown songs from forgotten Broadway
shows like Rodgers and Hart's ``Chee-Chee.''
   Wallowitch's early world wasn't anywhere near the bright lights
of Broadway. He grew up in an isolated area of South Philadelphia,
a neighborhood across from the city dump and surrounded by gas
tanks of the Atlantic Refining Co. His father owned a butcher shop.
   Young John, the first of four children, was precocious, he
admits. After all, how many youngsters sing ``Genevieve, Sweet
Genevieve'' at the age of 3 months? In a few years, Wallowitch was
picking out tunes on his grandmother's piano, and having poems
published in a children's column of the local newspaper.
   `I guess it was desperation,'' he recalls. ``When you are born
in a neighborhood like that, you'd better do something.''
   Wallowitch did. He took piano lessons.
   Every Wednesday, the Wallowitch family would listen to the
Lithuanian Furniture Company Radio Hour. Their eldest son, wearing
knickers and anklets, made his piano debut on the program, playing
a Berlin song called ``So Help Me.''
   Wallowitch eventually became a regular on the show, usually
performing short classical pieces. His musical education continued
at Edwin Vare Junior High School, where he would sneak into the
building before classes to play a grand piano. He was caught one
day by the school's music teacher. Instead of punishment, he got
free lessons.
   He went to Temple to major in education so he could become a
high school music teacher, but was drafted.
   ``I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life,'' Wallowitch
says. ``But when I got into the Army something happened to me.''
   Each night, he went to the USO to play the piano.
   ``I became violent about it,'' Wallowitch says. ``I would push
people away from the piano and say, `I play better than you.' I was
terrible, but this was my life.''
   While in the Army, Wallowitch gave his first public performance
in front of an audience, 10,000 people in a stadium in
Jacksonville, Fla. He was to play ``Clair de lune,'' but forgot
part of the piece.
   ``I found myself talking over the microphone and pretending to
be doing a comedy routine,'' he says.
   Wallowitch, the cabaret performer, was born to great applause,
even if he was mortified about forgetting the notes.
   Wallowitch later returned to Temple and to his old high school
piano teacher. He eventually was drawn to New York to study music
at Juilliard. He was there for eight years, even getting a
post-graduate degree.
   ``To keep myself solvent, I played in tap-dancing schools and
for small dance companies,'' he says. He also entered the theater,
working as a rehearsal pianist for ``New Faces of '52,'' considered
the best of the Broadway revues of the 1950s.
   ``I was so dumb. I thought I was going to be this great concert
pianist,'' Wallowitch says. ``When you start to mix with show
people and you start to realize you have a talent in that area,
then you realize what it takes to be a concert artist and how few
people really succeed at it. There's the loneliness of that life
and the eight hours a day practicing.''
   He finally made his concert debut in October 1962 at Carnegie
Recital Hall, getting rave reviews.
   He toured Europe, under State Department sponsorship, with
actress and singer Ethel Barrymore Colt. He accompanied her
American theater songs, as well as doing his own program.
   Back in New York, he landed a job at a small Greenwich Village
nightclub. He played piano every night for six hours. He even
attempted to sing. One night, an irate customer yelled, ``Don't
sing, we want to talk.'' The next night Wallowitch came back with
an original composition, ``Who Needs Enemies When I Have a Friend
Like You'' and his songwriting career began in earnest.
   Today, Wallowitch concentrates on performing, writing only
occasionally.
   ``I can go on a writing jag because I have a lot of ideas,'' he
says. ``I store them. I feel like Ibsen, you know. He would think
about a thing for two years and then suddenly the whole thing falls
out.''

   Historical novel ``Middle Passage,'' which
chronicles the journey of a freed African slave returning to his
homeland, won the 1990 National Book Award competition for fiction
Tuesday night.
   Charles Johnson wrote the book, which takes place in 1830 and
tells the story of a terrifying voyage to Africa on a clipper ship.
   Ron Charnow's ``The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty
and the Rise of Modern Finance'' won in the non-fiction category
during the 40th anniversary awards dinner at the Plaza Hotel.
   The competition was marked by the presence of little-known
writers from small publishing houses and ``acute dividedness''
among the jurors who chose them.
   The five fiction works that were up for consideration included
three books by immigrant authors - the first novels of Jessica
Hagedorn and Ilena Castedo, and the 42-year-old second book of
Felipe Alfau, who is 88.
   Johnson, an English professor at the University of Washington
who wrote two other novels and a collection of short fiction, was
among two established writers in the fiction category. The other
was Joyce Carol Oates.
   Johnson's novel, published by Atheneum, uses the freed slave's
difficult trip as a catalyst for self-discovery and also marks a
passage for African-American fiction. The title refers to the
crossing of the Atlantic to America from Africa by slave ships.
   ``In this decade, we will see the emergence of black-author
fiction that will help us as a people and as a culture to move from
narrow complaint to broad celebration,'' said Johnson, 42.
   One of the fiction jurors, writer Paul West, said there was
``acute dividedness over nearly everything'' discussed by the
five-member panel that chose the nominees. He charged that ``ethnic
considerations, ideology and moral self-righteousness'' had
prevailed over style and merit.
   But Sonny Mehta, president of Alfred A. Knopf publishers, said
although the list of nominees was obscure, he saw nothing
``sinister'' in the choices.
   ``It looks as if they were looking around for books that have
not had their share of praise,'' Mehta said.
   In the non-fiction category, the four other finalists were books
about teaching, former President Nixon, artist Jackson Pollock and
Roosevelt Cabinet member Harold Ickes.
   Chernow's winner was published by Atlantic Monthly
Press-Entrekin Books. The book traces the ups and downs of the most
influential family in the history of American banking. It charts
the Morgan family's story and the changing relationships between
financiers and companies since 1838.
   ``My motivation for writing the book started with my concern
with what was happening in the 1980s,'' said Chernow, 41, of
Brooklyn Heights.
   He said 19th century bankers had ``a very different notion of
what business was, it was a gentlemen's club against today's wild
carnival of greed.''
   The National Books Foundation also honored Saul Bellow, Nobel
laureate and the only three-time winner of the National Book Award.
   The 10 finalists came from among 375 books put forward by 72
publishers. For the first time in years, none came from such
prestigious houses as Knopf; Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux; or Simon &amp;
Schuster.
   Alfau's book, ``Chromos,'' was retrieved from oblivion by Dalkey
Archive Press, an Illinois publisher whose list amounts to about 15
titles a year and whose biggest seller has been a novel that sold
6,000 copies.
   The Spanish-born Alfau had his first novel, ``Locos: A Comedy of
Gestures,'' published in 1936. It was rediscovered and reissued
last year by Dalkey. When the publisher asked whether Alfau had
written anything else, he came up with ``Chromos,'' which he
finished in 1948.
   Castedo's ``Paradise'' was published by Grove Weidenfeld and
Hagedorn's ``Dogeaters'' by Pantheon, which has been warring with
its parent company, Random House, over Pantheon's tradition of
against-the-grain publishing.
   Atheneum brought out Johnson's ``Middle Passage'' and the Oates
book, ``Because It Is Bitter, and Because It Is My Heart,'' came
from E.P. Dutton-William Abrahams.
   The other non-fiction finalists were:
   ``Small Victories: The Real World of a Teacher, Her Students and
Their High School,'' by Samuel G. Freedman.
   ``Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an American Politician,''
by Roger Morris.
   ``Jackson Pollock: An American Saga,'' by Steven Naifeh and
Gregory White Smith.
   ``Righteous Pilgrim: The Life and Times of Harold L. Ickes,
1874-1952,'' by T.H. Watkins.

<TEXT>     Spangenberg Auditorium is at 780 Arastradero Road, Palo Alto. Admission is
$8; students and seniors are $5. (415) 858-1254 or (415) 354-8264.; AN URBAN
SETTING FOR REAL COWBOYS; David Plotnikoff; YOU probably won't catch any John
Travolta wanna-bes hangin' out at the Iron Cowboy Club on Saturday. The Club
(a long-running series of free country and western gigs run by roots-rock
impresario Cammy Blackstone) caters to urban cowpokes of a radically different
stripe. It's the alternative rock scene's version of a honky-tonk hoedown --
South Fork meets South of Market.;    Saturday, the club convenes at
Bouncer's, a broad-shouldered, blue-collared waterfront dive of redoubtable
character at 64 Townsend St., between the Embarcadero and Second Street in San
Francisco. It would be tough to beat this no-cover double bill with both hands
and a big stick: San Jose's own Diablos (this season's darlings of the
Paradise Lounge scene), teamed with Jerry Shelfer, a tough-as-leather former
Marine with a tender spot for country ballads. (415) 397-2480.; CAHN'S
WONDERFUL WORDS AND MUSIC; -- Murry Frymer; SAMMY Cahn is back.;    Sammy is
that delightful lyricist who does a full evening of "and-then-I-wrote"
material that has proved to be a winner twice in San Francisco in the last
three years.;    Cahn returns to the Marines Memorial Theater with his "Words
and Music" show. He doesn't have much of a voice, but nobody sings a song the
way the guy who wrote it sings a song. And that is the special charm. That,
along with stories about how the songs were written and who sang them when.;  
 The show begins with a preview Monday, opens Tuesday and runs three weeks
through March 10. Tickets $20 to $32. (415) 771-6900.; ARTWORK INSPIRED BY
PAST MASTERS; -- Dorothy Burkhart; APPROPRIATION may be the name of the game,
but New Yorker Sherrie Levine "borrows" better than anyone, including Mike
Bidlo, who fakes Pollocks and Picassos.;    Ten years ago Levine was
photographing reproductions of classic photos by Edward Weston and Walker
Evans. Next came tastefully framed color photographs of art book reproductions
of paintings by early modern masters like Monet, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and
Egon Schiele.;     Now, in her sculptural installation at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art (through March 31), Levine takes her cue from Man Ray's
1938 painting "La Fortune," which pictures a billiard table.;    In one large
gallery Levine has lined up six custom-made, 19th-century-style mahogany pool
tables. A green felt cloth covers the tabletop, upon which sit three billiard
balls -- one red, two white. On a formal level, this impressive and beautiful
work blends the precision of Vermeer and the minimalism of Donald Judd.;    In
this and other works, Levine demolishes modernist myths, challenges
originality in art and makes sly feminist statements, too.;    The museum, at
401 Van Ness Ave., is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and
Fridays; to 9 p.m. Thursdays; 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekends. $4, $2 seniors,
children under 12 free. Free the first Tuesday of every month. (415)
863-8800.; CHILDREN'S MUSIC HITS CENTER STAGE; -- Harry Sumrall; AS THE baby
boomers have begun to sprout babies of their own, the children's music scene
has become a potent force. Not music by children, but music for children.;   
And at the top of the list of children's performers is the group Sharon, Lois
and Bram (Canadian vocalist Raffi was No. 1 until he gave up his crown
recently to compete in the adult market). In the past 12 years, the trio has
sold more than 2 million records and the "Sharon, Lois and Bram Elephant Show"
is broadcast daily to 47 million homes on Nickelodeon.;    A key to the trio's
success is that it never plays down to children, instead opting for a fairly
sophisticated sound that includes rock and folk and that educates as it
entertains. With its new disc "Sing A to Z," Sharon, Lois and Bram highlight
the letters of the alphabet in traditional and contemporary songs and rhymes.;
   The group makes its way to the Bay Area on Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the San
Jose Center for The Performing Arts, 255 Almaden Blvd., San Jose. Also 7 p.m.
Feb. 27 at the Paramount Theater, 2025 Broadway, Oakland. Tickets $13.50.
(408) 998-2277 or (415) 762-2277.; STORYTELLERS OF A DIFFERENT SORT; -- Judith
Green; EVERYONE loves a good story, and two very different storytellers are on
tap this weekend.;    Karen Finley, one of four performance artists turned
down for a fellowship at the height of the National Endowment for the Arts
flap, reads from her new book, "Shock Treatment," at 9 tonight in the ballroom
of the Student Union at San Jose State University.;    The title is no
exaggeration. Finley's subject is violence against women, and she uses bodily
fluids as the ink in her pen to write four-letter words. Admission is $8 in
advance, $10 at the door, with $1 off for students. (408) 924-6374.;    Brenda
Wong Aoki delves into her Chinese, Japanese and American roots for "Tales of
the Pacific Rim," a program for children in words and movement. She performs
at 2 p.m. Saturday in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, Stanford University. Tickets are
$6, $4 children. (415) 725-2787.  </TEXT>

   Ira Levin, a novelist and playwright whose
thrillers and mysteries have spiced the stage and bookstores for
years, notes wistfully that ``comedy comes easiest.''
   But book editors ask for thrillers, not comedies, Levin says.
   ``I always have to watch myself,'' he says. Very often when I'm
writing scary stuff, I find I can't resist a little joke. I
eventually edit it out. Sometimes I'll write a good one down and
hope a place will show up for it. It rarely does. A joke usually
springs out of the situation and characters.''
   His current off-Broadway offering is ``Cantorial,'' in which the
audience never sees the cantor. They only hear him singing, a
singing ghost.
   Not a new twist for Levin, who has written about the
supernatural before. But unlike his best-known novel, ``Rosemary's
Baby,'' this play's ghost is benign. All he does is sing. But his
songs are directed to a young couple that has taken up residence in
a former Manhattan synagogue. The ghostly voice wants their
furniture out of the living room. He wants it to be a synagogue
again.
   Levin's other novels include ``A Kiss Before Dying,'' ``The
Stepford Wives'' and ``The Boys from Brazil.'' His plays range from
the comedy ``No Time for Sergeants'' in 1955 to ``Deathtrap'' in
1978, Broadway's longest-running thriller.
   ``For a while I would go back and forth between a play and a
book,'' Levin says. ``At this point, I'd like to do more books.
It's hard to get a play on. It takes so long. It was easier in the
old days.''
   ``Cantorial'' was presented three years ago in Stamford, Conn.
``There were problems with it,'' Levin says. ``I put it on the
shelf. Then I did a complete rewrite. I felt I had found the
problems with it so it was kind of exciting to get it right.''
   He doesn't mind that it's being presented off-Broadway instead
of on and is pleased at its success there. ``We're hoping it's
going to have a good, long, healthy run. So far it is doing very
nicely. The audience seems to be building, from word-of-mouth.''
   Levin doesn't want potential playgoers to think ``Cantorial,''
with the young man in it adopted and thinking he may be Jewish, is
only for Jews. ``I think non-Jewish people seem to respond to it,
if anything, more warmly than Jewish audience members. Partly, I
think they're relieved they've enjoyed it.
   ``I always intended it for a mainstream audience. We all are
looking for roots and family warmth, even those of us who've had
it. It's nice to have that sense of recapturing it.''
   Levin plunged into writing full time after New York University,
where he majored in English. A TV script he wrote for a competition
was bought by NBC.
   ``That was enough to encourage my parents to let me stay home
and write,'' he says. ``I wrote a few more TV plays that sold. I
wrote a few that didn't. I wrote my first book, `A Kiss Before
Dying,' then I went out looking for work. Before I could find a job
the book had been accepted by Simon and Schuster, so I officially
became a writer. I've never held an honest job.
   ``That's unless you count two years in the Army. Even there I
managed to write training films.''
   Levin, who is divorced and has three grown sons, lives in a
Manhattan apartment with a grand piano and a big, black coffee
table with a big black box in the center. It's a TV projector for a
10-foot screen which pulls down from the ceiling. Consequently he
doesn't read much anymore.
   ``The architect who did the apartment talked me into it. I've
got my own movie theater, which I always wanted as a child. I've
really gotten hooked on TV. It has even made a baseball fan of me,
which I never was.'' The study where he writes is partitioned from
the living room by a wall of glass bricks.
   ``I tend to be a workaholic,'' he says. ``When I really get into
something, I wake up earlier and earlier and work later and later.
After a few days I can't tell the fictional world from the real
world.''
   Years ago, Levin made a list of interesting settings for novels
or plays. A haunted synagogue was on the list.
   ``One day it dawned on me it should be haunted by a cantor, not
somebody banging around in chains,'' he says. ``I thought cantorial
singing would be interesting; it's unusual to hear in a theater.
That's how I got started. Then the synagogue became a former
synagogue. The singing obviously made it a play instead of a
novel.''
   ```The Boys from Brazil' was always a novel idea because these
boys would have to be cropping up in different countries.''
   Levin never has written a screenplay. ``Any idea I got could be
a play or a novel first,'' he says. ``I might as well do it that
way and please myself rather than write a screenplay that has to
please 100 people on the coast.
   ``I was going to do `Deathtrap,' then the thought of writing the
whole thing over again got to be a chore. I was sorry afterward. I
wasn't that happy with the screenplay that was done.''
   But he liked ``Rosemary's Baby.''
   ``It's probably the most faithful movie adaptation that has ever
been made,'' he says. ``Roman Polanski directed it and wrote the
screenplay. It was the first movie he'd made that wasn't based on
his own original material. I don't think he knew he had a right to
change things.''
