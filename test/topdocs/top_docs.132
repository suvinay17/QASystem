<HEAD>James Bond, Ornithologist, Gave Name To Fictional Agent 007</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James Bond, an ornithologist whose name was
adopted for the fictional British agent 007 in Ian Fleming's novels,
has died. He was 89.
   He died Tuesday at Chestnut Hill Hospital, where officials
refused to release the cause of death.
   Bond, former curator of ornithology at the Academy of Natural
Sciences, was the leading authority on birds of the West Indies for
more than half a century and is best known scientifically for
proving that birds of the Caribbean originated in North America, not
South America.
   In recognition of this discovery, the geographic line dividing
Caribbean birds of North American ancestry from those of South
American origins has been called ``Bond's Line.''
   Bond's contribution to popular culture came after World War II
when Fleming saw his book, ``Birds of the West Indies.'' Fleming, a
bird watcher, was writing a thriller at the time and adopted the
name for the dashing character portrayed in movies by Sean Connery,
Roger Moore and other actors.
   ``It struck me that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet
very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James
Bond was born,'' Fleming wrote years later to Bond's wife, Mary
Fanning Wickham Bond.
   ``In return I can only offer you or James Bond unlimited use of
the name Ian Fleming for any purposes you may think fit,'' he wrote.
``Perhaps one day your husband will discover a particularly horrible
species of bird which he would like to christen in an insulting
fashion by calling it Ian Fleming.''
   Fleming died in 1964.
   The ornithologist Bond, a native of Philadelphia, earned a
bachelor's degree at Cambridge University and made his first
scientific expedition in 1925 when he traveled up the Amazon River
to collect bird skins and live animals for the academy.
   He visited more than 100 Caribbean islands, collected all but six
of the 300 bird species living there and wrote more than 100
scientific papers and four books on Caribbean birds.
   Among his scientific honors were the Musgrave Medal from the
Institute of Jamaica in 1952; the Brewster Medal, the highest honor
of the American Ornithologists' Union, in 1954; and the Leidy Medal
of the Academy of Natural Sciences in 1975.
   He is survived by his wife, a stepdaughter and six
stepgrandchildren.
   A memorial service will be held Saturday in Chestnut Hill.

JAMES BOND, 89; ORNITHOLOGIST'S NAME MADE FAMOUS IN FICTION

<P>
A world-famous ornithologist, whose name became synonymous with secret agentry

   Something there is about an actor who loves
the act of giving, so it was nice to find a bunch of ``Santa
Clauses'' running around the set of the new James Bond movie,
``License Revoked.''
   Timothy Dalton ``has been very giving as an actor,'' said Robert
Davi, forgetting for the moment that his villainous character spends
the last part of the movie trying to grind Dalton-Bond into cocaine
dust.
   ``I don't think you can create anything if you don't give,''
returned Dalton, who manages to give Davi's character a hole in the
head.
   ``He's very professional, very focused,'' said Carey Lowell of
Dalton, shortly after saving Bond from a fate worse than coke.
``It's better than working with somebody who doesn't give a damn.''
   Seriously, now.
   ``I would loathe a concept of work in which people are competing
with each other,'' said Dalton. ``I think it is a two-way process.
It is a game where you throw something at somebody and they throw it
back at you.''
   In other words, these actors say, this is how they work. They
have nothing to give but themselves, and that can be scary. But if
an actor holds back, if nothing is given, nothing can be thrown back.
   ``It's probably true that some actors see it as a competition,
but it seems very ungenerous to attempt to deny to another actor the
tools with which to work,'' Dalton said. ``I think if you look at
any really good actors, you'll find them all very giving.''
   Lowell, whose face has decorated the covers of Vogue and
Mademoiselle, understands that concept as one of the differences
between modeling and acting.
   ``It's different from modeling because you don't have to give to
the camera. You give to the actors instead,'' she said. And if you
give only to the camera? ``In a film, if you're static it shows
immediately. It's difficult.''
   To hear these people talk, you'd think making moving pictures was
fun, not long hours of work, intense concentration, weird
situations. Just what does an actor think about while hogtied on a
conveyor belt, waiting to be ground (almost) to magnesium dust
(that's what they use as a stand-in for cocaine).
   ``When you're in the thick of it you have to think of what to do
in the scene. You've got to be on form and on key and
concentrated,'' said Dalton.
   The effort to maintain concentration is why he has a reputation
for being difficult for outsiders to talk to on the set.
   ``If you can't get it right you don't get a moment to do it
again,'' he said. ``You just don't get a moment to do it again.''
   Now let's back up. The film is ``License Revoked,'' and it is due
for release in the summer. James Bond loses his license to kill and
goes off the reservation to avenge his friend, CIA agent Felix
Leiter, who gave his leg to some sharks with the help of ...
   Franz Sanchez (Davi), an evil drug lord modeled a little bit on
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, de facto ruler of Panama who has been
indicted on drug trafficking charges in the United States. He is
foiled with the help of ...
   Pam Bouvier (Lowell), a former pilot for the CIA who worked with
Leiter and who saves Bond and helps gift-wrap Sanchez at Mexico
City's Churusbusco Studios under the direction of John Glen.
   Dalton, 42, is a classically trained actor who has established
his ability to play all kinds of roles _ everything from
Shakespeare's ``Richard II'' to the male lead opposite Mae West in
``Sextette.''
   That range is the envy of Lowell and Davi, who would like to have
the opportunity to show that they, too, can change their spots.
   ``Unfortunately, I always have to play a beautiful girl. Now I
want to do something less stylish,'' the 27-year-old Lowell said.
   Davi, 35, would like to go up the style scale, not down, and to
that end he's trying to push the envelope on the Bond villain bit.
   ``This guy could be a friend who you think it'd be nice to have a
drink with, but after the last sip he stabs you. It kind of makes
him fun to play,'' said Davi.
   ``I want to make my mark in film,'' he said. ``I want to be an
international star. I want to get the girl without putting a gun to
her head. I'm looking for Mister Good-Guy.''
   Dalton thinks they've both got a chance:
   ``Everyone has to be good, because you want a good movie. It
would be stupid and destructive not to be a creative, giving actor.
It's how we work together.''

   Timothy Dalton was faced with two of the
toughest acts to follow, but he has managed by talent and sheer
perseverance to bring James Bond to life in a new, modernized style
that could carry 007 into the 21st century.
   The 44-year-old Briton was here for the opening of ``Licence to
Kill,'' 16th of the adventures (not counting two unofficial films)
that have generated more dollars than any film series in movie
history.
   Most critics have found Dalton at ease in his second go-round as
Bond; his first, ``The Living Daylights,'' was not written for him.
He also seemed relaxed in an interview, as if he had come to grips
with a classic role that might have overwhelmed him. He admitted
having ``enormous pause'' when he first considered it.
   ``My concern was not about creating the character, which after
all is my job,'' said Dalton. ``If I do it well, then that's
terrific. If I fail, then that's also part of being an actor.
   ``The pause was over how to deal with it, how to bring an
audience with you, away from its history and into its new present.
Very clearly, before I took it on, I knew that everyone has an
opinion about Bond; it's part of the cinema-going consciousness.
   ``Everyone has an opinion about the actors who have played Bond
before. Half the world loved Sean Connery; half the world loved
Roger Moore. Their films existed in two very different styles. You
know when you take it on you run the risk of having the whole world
hate what you do. If that had happened, it would have been a major
catastrophe. Fortunately it didn't,'' he said.
   ``What one must face today is that we've got something new,
something different. ... This is a new style of Bond. It isn't a
light-hearted, comedic, spoofing Bond. It's not a technological
extravaganza. I think it's back down to its origins, its basics,
trying to capture the spirit of Ian Fleming, and of the early movies.
   ``I loved `Dr. No' and `From Russia With Love'; they were very
exciting adventure-thrillers. I watched the train sequence of Sean
Connery and Robert Shaw the other day. It's still tremendously
exciting.''
   Previewers noted that Dalton seemed to be performing much of his
own action, but he discounted any threat to his safety.
   ``I think the strenuous side of a Bond movie is the sheer amount
of time to make one _ six months, which is a very, very long
schedule,'' he said. ``You're on location so you work long hours.
The crew works 15 hours a day; we go back, watch rushes, talk about
tomorrow's work, so it's 18 hours a day.''
   Dalton had a thriving career before producer Cubby Broccoli chose
him as the fourth James Bond (George Lazenby had a single shot in
``On Her Majesty's Secret Service,'' 1969).
   He grew up in Manchester with non-professional parents.
   ``My grandfather and grandmother were in vaudeville-music
halls,'' Dalton said, ``but my parents were not involved in the
theater. It skipped a generation.
   ``I suppose I first became interested, just like most kids of my
generation, by going to the Saturday morning pictures. You find
yourself in a very exciting, rare, different world. An extraordinary
coincidence: The first full-length feature film I saw was `The Red
Beret,' starring Alan Ladd. I discovered recently that it was
produced by Cubby Broccoli. The very first picture that I saw at
five or six years old was produced by the man I'm now working for.''
   Dalton studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts and appeared
in classics from repertory to the West End. His film debut was
auspicious: as the young king of France in ``The Lion in Winter''
with Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole. Other films have included
``Cromwell,'' ``Wuthering Heights'' (as Heathcliff), ``Agatha'' and
a curiosity, ``Sextette'' with Mae West.
   Although ``Sextette'' was seen by few, Dalton found working with
the film legend a rare experience.
   ``She claimed to be 84 but some oldtimers said she was 90,'' he
recalled. ``It was amazing to be working at her old studio,
Paramount, and see her come to life every day as she did the thing
she loved.''
   How long will Dalton remain with Bond?
   He laughed heartily before replying: ```Licence to Kill' started
to do extremely well in Europe. If it does well here, I'm sure there
will be another one. ... But for how long I'll continue, I don't
know.''

The owner of the exclusive rights to novelist Ian Fleming's James Bond 
character is putting the super-spy on the auction block after a long run of 
movie hits that has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, it was reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Variety, the entertainment weekly, said the decision was made by veteran film 
producer Albert Broccoli because revenues from the "007" films have been 
slipping. 
</P>
<P>
The latest film, "License to Kill," released last year, cost $30 million to 
make and has grossed only $16 million in domestic theatrical rentals so far. 
</P>
<P>
Variety described the 81-year-old Broccoli's decision to "protect and 
modernize" his franchise on James Bond as a "bloodless coup" within the MGM/UA 
empire, which has made all but one of the 17 James Bond productions.

   In a movie world where studio bosses seem to
change chairs as frequently as they do shirts, one close-knit group
of filmmakers has been prospering for 27 years. They are the folks
who bring the biennial adventures of James Bond.
   ``Licence to Kill,'' a midsummer entry in the season of
blockbusters, boasts a veteran crew.
   Albert R. (Cubby) Broccoli has produced or co-produced all 16 of
the Bond films. Richard Maibaum has co-written 13. Desmond
Llewelleyn has played the gadget maker Q in 14. Peter Lamont has
been production designer for 14. John Barry has scored 11 Bond
films, though a conflict of assignments kept him from the new one
(Michael Kamen takes his place). John Glen has directed the last
five.
   In addition, stunt coordinators, special effects designers,
publicists, stunt men and others have long served the Bond pictures.
   Michael Wilson dates back to the 1964 ``Goldfinger,'' on which he
was an assistant director for the Fort Knox sequence. He has been
with Broccoli for 17 years, first as assistant, then executive
producer.
   In the recent films he has been co-producer and co-writer. The
New Yorker formerly practiced international taxation law, a good
background for worldwide filming.
   Interviewed in his office at MGM-UA, he was asked about the
peculiar _ to Americans _ spelling of ``Licence to Kill.''
   ``There was some discussion over whether we should spell it as
American usually do _ though the dictionary lists both `license,'
which comes first, and `licence,''' he said. ``In England, the noun
is always spelled `licence' and the verb is `license.' We decided
since we had a British subject and a British agent and Ian Fleming
had written it that way as a title, we would adopt that spelling.''
   Only the title is Fleming's; the plot was devised by the
filmmakers because all of Fleming's plots have been used up.
   Starting with ``Dr. No'' in 1962, the first five Bond films were
released annually. Now they come every other year, and that allows
for a more sensible pace.
   From the start, the Bond movies were unbeatable at the box office
with their winning combination of violence, mystery, exotic locales,
sex, sophistication, high-tech toys and almost campy humor.
   The Bond movies also made credit and pre-credit sequences
memorable bits to watch. In ``From Russia With Love,'' for example,
a man presumably with Bond's face is chased and killed. The titles
then emerge on the undulating body of a belly dancer.
   ``Licence to Kill'' began two years ago with a trip to China in
search of locales. Wilson and Maibaum tried a couple of stories
based in China but they didn't work out.
   The two writers decided to follow the headlines and spin a yarn
about a notorious drug dealer who controls a Latin American country.
The scripting period took about eight months.
   ``Normally, we begin our preproduction in February,'' said
Wilson. ``We started filming in Mexico in mid-July, and we finished
around Thanksgiving time. We go into post-production until around
Easter. Then we have the film ready for July release.''
   Unlike previous Bond movies that have spanned continents,
``Licence to Kill'' was shot in Mexico and Key West, Fla. The
company filmed interiors at Mexico City's Churubusco studio, street
scenes of ``Isthmus City'' in and around the capital and seaside
locations at Acapulco. A second unit worked at Mexicali in Baja for
14 weeks to stage a spectacular chase of tanker trucks, the climax
of the film.
   Despite the heavy logistics, Wilson reported that the cost of
``Licence to Kill'' was $30 million to $35 million. This, he said,
was about average for a big production these days.
   Timothy Dalton seems more comfortable in the new film than he did
in his first Bond outing, ``The Living Daylights.'' Wilson agreed.
   ``What happened was that when we first cast Dalton in `Living
Daylights,' we had already written the script. He came in very late,
and we had already written sort of a generic Bond. Dalton played it
in his style. After working with him on one film, it was quite
obvious that he could not or should not imitate the Roger Moore
style.
   ``Dalton brings something different,'' he said. ``This was an
opportunity for us to write a different direction for Bond, using
Timothy's personality as a catalyst. Four actors have played James
Bond (Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Moore, Dalton) and each has
brought a new approach to the character. That's what keeps the
series contemporary and intersting.''
   The producer would not reveal the contractual arrangements with
Dalton, but he indicated that both the producers and cast would like
to see the association continue.
   And the next adventure for Bond?
   ``We'll wait for this one to get out, take a little rest, then
start all over again.''

   John Gardner is not just a thriller
writer but a master of a very special art: the posthumous sequel.
   At his home in this English village west of London, the
61-year-old author writes James Bond novels, having picked up where
007's creator, Ian Fleming, left off when he died in 1964.
   While American writer Alexandra Ripley is just beginning a
sequel to Margaret Mitchell's ``Gone With the Wind,'' Gardner has
already turned out seven Bond novels, each a best seller in the
United States. The most recent, ``Scorpius,'' is in its sixth
consecutive week on the New York Times best-seller list.
   ``It was a challenge, a little honor,'' Gardner recalled of his
decision to accept a publisher's offer in 1979 to write a Bond
sequel.
   He had already made a name with his books about the adventurer
Boysie Oakes, and with such cloak-and-dagger yarns as ``The Dancing
Dodo'' and ``The Nostradamus Traitor.'' He had also written two
novels featuring Sherlock Holmes' nemesis, Professor Moriarty.
   So when Glidrose Publications, Bond's literary copyright owners,
offered him a shot at old 007 himself, he thought, ``Why not? If I
don't do it, somebody else will.''
   Gardner was then living in Ireland as a tax exile, and already
one Bond sequel, ``Colonel Sun,'' had been published in 1968 by
Kingsley Amis, author of such acclaimed novels as ``Lucky Jim'' and
``One Fat Englishman.'' Amis wrote it under the pseudonym Robert
Markham.
   Gardner first encountered Bond while in bed with the flu in the
early 1960s, when his wife, Margaret, brought ``Casino Royale'' and
``Dr. No'' from the library.
   ``I was absolutely enchanted,'' he recalled.
   ``Fantasy, formula, fun are the three F's of Bond writing,'' he
said in an interview.
   The exploits of the suave, self-possessed hero, a man both
dressed and licensed to kill, demand a lot from a writer, Gardner
said.
   The trick, he says, is to make the Bond novels ``look as if
they've been thrown off in one afternoon. ... You can't let readers
see the joints anywhere.''
   ``I sit down to do Bond and within about four days, I'm cutting
lines out and making it run very fast,'' he said. ``Every chapter I
write I have to go back and say, `no, you can take two lines out
there and you can say that in three words.'
   ``It has to be that tight,'' he said. ``These are books to be
read in an airplane or on a beach.''
   His contract calls for two more Bond novels. Under a separate
agreement he is writing the book of the forthcoming ``License
Revoked,'' the first Bond movie not drawn directly from a Fleming
book.
   Movies, Gardner said, pose the greatest obstacle to
sequel-writing.
   ``People remember the movies far better than the books,'' he
said. ``There's a universal myth that Bond drove an Aston Martin.
He didn't, except for a very short time in `Goldfinger.' He drove a
very old Bentley.''
   Gardner said he had tried to bring his champagne-drinking hero
up to date with AIDS and glasnost.
   ``You can make him a man of the '80s, make him adapt to the
women's movement, the strictures under which we live, all that,''
he said. ``(But) I've had to get round the business of him
transporting arms on normal flights, and of course the technology
has changed so greatly.''
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome posed specific problems for
the libidinous Bond. He tried to work in a joke about condoms but
his publishers rejected it.
   Nor is he allowed to give Bond depth: ``I can't in any way
relate to him as a character like I can to my own. Bond is
one-dimensional; that is one of his successes. His novels are kiss
kiss, bang bang adventures.''
   He is reticent about his earnings from the Bond books, saying:
``I get a percentage of a percentage of a percentage. It puts a
tiny bit of jam on top of the money I earn through my other
writing.''
   Gardner's immediate future looks relatively Bond-free. ``Secret
Families,'' the last in a trilogy about espionage from 1910 to the
present day, will appear next May.
   After ``License Revoked'' he plans ``a modern blockbusting novel
a la Jeffrey Archer'' focusing on the life of a symphony conductor.
   Meanwhile, his only advice to such sequel-writers as Alexandra
Ripley is to be faithful to the original, but not unduly so: ``Try
and make it your own.''

   Welsh actor Timothy Dalton, who
earned agent 007's license to kill in the James Bond film ``The
Living Daylights,'' has had his license renewed for the next Bond
movie, ``License Revoked.''
   Dalton, trained as a Shakespearean actor, performed many of his
own stunts in ``The Living Daylights,'' in which Bond battles a
nefarious international arms smuggler while courting femme fatale
Maryam D'Abo.
   Dalton's performance proved he was the right man to pick up the
keys to the Aston Martin and carry on in the tradition of Sean
Connery and Roger Moore, who starred in previous Bond thrillers,
said Amy Kimmelman, a United Artists spokeswoman.
   Filming for ``License Revoked'' will begin in mid-July in Mexico
City, with other locations to be selected later, Ms. Kimmelman said.

<TEXT>
   Filming of the latest James Bond
movie, ``License Revoked,'' starring actor Timothy Dalton in a
reprise role, is ready to begin in Mexico City, United Artists
announced.
   Dalton, 42, is cast as the suave British secret agent opposite
Robert Davi, who plays a tyrannical Latin American drug lord. Cast
as femme fatales are Carey Lowell and Talisa Soto. Filming is set
to begin Monday, the studio said.
   In ``License Revoked,'' Bond is cashiered by the British Secret
Service as he becomes embroiled in a personal mission of vengeance.
   The Hamlet-like role should be a cinch for Dalton, a
Shakespearean actor whose stage credits include ``Antony and
Cleopatra'' and ``Taming of the Shrew.''
   The 20-week production schedule will be shot on locations in
Mexicali, Durango, Vera Cruz, Isla Mujeres, Acapulco and Key West,
Fla.
   ``License Revoked'' will be the 18th James Bond film, if you
count the Peter Sellers' spoof ``Casino Royale,'' and is produced
by Albert R. ``Cubby'' Broccoli, the veteran Bond filmaker, and
Michael G. Wilson. The director is John Glen.

<LEADPARA>  'OH, GOD forbid!" says Roger Moore when asked if he might do another James
Bond film.;   He might well have continued playing Ian Fleming's
globe-trotting super-agent -- even approaching 63, Moore could pass for 45 --
but since his last Bond movie in 1985, Moore has taken on more urgent
international concerns in real life.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     He recently completed a two-week tour of Latin America and the Caribbean,
where he looked in on UNICEF health projects as a representative of that
agency. (His flight back to the United States required a stopover at the
Dallas/Fort Worth airport, with visiting time between connections.);   Moore
has been involved with UNICEF -- United Nations Children's Fund -- since
around the time of his fifth James Bond film, 1980's "For Your Eyes Only."
This involvement led last month to his appointment as the agency's "special
representative for the film arts.";   "This is one of the few worthwhile
things I've done," said Moore, whose humanitarian involvement dates to the
early 1970s.;   "Just a week ago," he continued, "I got to 'introduce' running
water to a Guatemalan village -- that is, I was privileged to turn on the tap,
which the community had built with UNICEF assistance. . . . It's been a most
fascinating time. I knew all about the conditions of poverty from reading the
official statistics, but I've really wanted to go and put some faces to those
statistics.";   Moore tackled the Bond role in seven films from "Live and Let
Die" (1973) through "A View to a Kill" (1985).;   "I believe I said all I had
to say about Bond," Moore said. "Once might even have been enough, though I'm
glad to have stuck with the character.;   "I enjoyed doing Holmes, as well,"
he added, referring to his 1976 TV-movie turn in "Sherlock Holmes in New
York." "But once was decidedly enough.";   He speaks enthusiastically,
however, of returning to another of his familiar characters: While a new Moore
picture called "Bed and Breakfast" is finished for release, he is awaiting
delivery of a script for "The Saint" -- in pre-production as a big-screen
project at Paramount Pictures.;   Moore was hardly the first to impersonate
Simon "The Saint" Templar, Leslie Charteris' rule-breaking crime-buster, but
his redefinition of the character in 114 "Saint" TV episodes (1961-68) is as
striking as any of the 1930s-'40s portrayals by George Sanders, Hugh Sinclair
or Louis Hayward.;   "I'm really looking forward to getting back in
character," Moore said.  </TEXT>

   If Robert Davi ever gets tired of being a
villain on film, he can always try opera. That's how he got his
start in show biz, and when he talks about a character it can sound
a bit _ well, operatic.
   ``I was a high baritone, loved Verdi,'' said Davi, who plays drug
lord Franz Sanchez in ``License Revoked,'' the latest James Bond
movie due out in the summer. ``I sang for the Lyric Opera of Long
Island.''
   Davi, 35, did that when he was 19. He even studied with Tito
Gobbi, one of the great voices of Italy.
   ``If I was still singing I wouldn't be doing any of this now,''
he said, waving at a Bond set gloomy with smoke from the fire that
destroys the villain's laboratory.
   ``I wouldn't be smoking cigars or drinking. And I'd get out of
this air (Mexico City's world-record pollution). I wouldn't even be
talking. I would be totally crazy.
   ``After I'm established as an actor I'd like to spend six months
and work on the voice. Now the voice is getting the black mark.''
   Timothy Dalton, who plays Bond, had proposed that Davi play
Sanchez as an opera buff: ``I suggested to him that he had to find a
moment where he sang a bar or two. Probably at an odd moment right
after or just before he killed somebody, whistle or sing a couple of
bars.''
   ``We thought about it when we first met,'' Davi said. ``Timothy
wanted me to try something, but I decided I better not. I did the
same thing in `Goonies,' sort of played a frustrated opera singer. I
didn't want to do the same thing as I did in the Spielberg film,
which was full of pirate ships and fantasies. I want to be
remembered for something else in this film.''
   But Dalton said he didn't see why Davi should worry about that,
``if it's a good idea.''
   ``All actors have good ideas. But they're not always germane to
the piece,'' said Davi, more diplomatic than Sparafucile, the hired
killer of Verdi's ``Rigoletto.''
   But Sanchez, ``seductive, charming, and totally immoral,'' as
Davi conceived him, might be able to hold his own with many another
opera bad guy.
   ``The most difficult was when I walked through that house in
Acapulco that was supposed to be the house I owned. A $30 million
house. I don't have $30 million,'' Davi said.
   ``You know, a lot of actors when they play something like that
you see them in the house but you don't really believe that they own
it. I had to go through that house and feel like I owned it.''
   Then he bursts into a snatch of ``Va, Tosca,'' a solo in which
the evil Scarpia boasts that he's infected Tosca's heart with
jealousy by fooling her into thinking her boyfriend is fooling
around.
   Watch out, Puccini.

   Pierce Brosnan, who'd never been to Asia
before, started last year with a miniseries in Hong Kong and ended
it with a movie in India.
   In between, he returned to his native Ireland to do an
independent film with some friends.
   The miniseries, ``Noble House,'' starts its eight-hour,
four-part run on NBC this Sunday. It's based on the best-selling
book by James Clavell.
   The movie in India is ``The Deceivers,'' from the book by John
Masters. The Irish movie is ``Taffin.''
   In ``Noble House,'' Brosnan stars as Ian Dunross, the tai-pan,
or boss, of Hong Kong's leading trading house. It also stars
Deborah Raffin, Ben Masters, John Houseman, John Rhys-Davies and
Julia Nickson. Gary Nelson directed it on location in Hong Kong for
12 weeks and at the Dino De Laurentiis Studio in North Carolina for
another 12 weeks.
   ``Hong Kong was my first step into the Orient,'' said Brosnan.
``It's a fascinating place, sort of a condensed version of New York
City. My schedule was such that I had time to go around and see the
place. I bought an automatic camera and did some photography.
   ``What was around me was so exciting to look at and so
different. The colors and the light were magical. Having started
life as a commercial artist, I've always looked at things as though
to paint them. I used a zoom lens because the Chinese don't like
having their pictures taken.''
   As the story opens, Dunross has just taken over the family's
trading empire.
   ``He's fairly ruthless in his dealings with people,'' said
Brosnan. ``He has a remoteness to him. An isolated charm. I've
never played a character like him before. The job came at a very
opportune moment, after the whole incident of James Bond and
`Remington Steele.'''
   After NBC canceled ``Remington Steele'' a few seasons back,
Brosnan was asked to become the next James Bond. Roger Moore had
decided to step down as 007. Then, because of the publicity over
Bond, NBC put ``Remington Steele'' back on the schedule, and
Brosnan was dropped from the Bond picture.
   Did he see the offer of the role in ``Noble House'' as a peace
offering?
   ``I never thought of it as a peace offering,'' he answered. ``I
saw it as a way of putting as much distance between myself and
`Remington Steele' as possible. I'd always enjoyed doing the
series, but I knew coming back for six more episodes was hogwash.
They wanted to have their cake and eat it.
   ``The turmoil for me was the on and off anxiety of the Bond
part. It lasted an eternity. I was offered James Bond. I said yes.
`Remington Steele' was brought back. That's enough to say on the
subject. It was a shame because `Remington Steele' was never
allowed to finish with any grace.''
   As it turned out, Timothy Dalton was hired to play James Bond in
``The Living Daylights.'' Brosnan said he sees no chance that he
will ever play the role.
   His wife, Cassandra Harris, was Moore's leading lady in the Bond
movie ``For Your Eyes Only.''
   Brosnan's India movie, ``The Deceivers,'' is set in 1824 and
focuses on the Thugs who worshipped the god of destruction, Kali.
   ``I play an Englishman, a glorified accountant working for the
East India Trading Co.,'' he said. ``He discovers this cult and
disguises himself as an Indian. He goes on the road with the Thugs,
who kill people by strangulation.''
   Brosnan's only current appearances on TV are in a commercial for
Diet Coke, which was premiered during the Super Bowl coverage. It
was filmed on a speeding train in England and looks like a scene
right out of a spy thriller such as a Bond movie, or perhaps ``The
Fourth Protocol,'' in which Brosnan played a Soviet agent being
tracked down by Michael Caine.
   ``That was me walking on top of that train,'' he said. ``It was
going 40 miles an hour. If I'd fallen off that sucker I'd never
have done `The Deceivers.'''

THE THIN MAN AND JAMES BOND AGREE: WHEN IT COMES TO A PROPER MARTINI, IT'S

The secret of a Big League curve ball? It's all in the wrist. But for a 
first-rate martini pitcher it's all in the hips, if you believe William Powell, 
or rather his incarnation as Nick Charles, raffish sleuth of "The Thin Man" and 
the silver screen's cocktail expert. Indeed, when movie audiences first meet 
Nick Charles, he's holding court in a swanky gin mill. The camera pans the room 
of sophisticated revelers, and in the corner of the club, next to the bar, we 
notice a man gleefully dancing, not with a woman but with a cocktail shaker. 
He's instructing the tuxedoed bartenders on the perfect martini beat. 
</P>
<P>
"See, the important thing is the rhythm," he says, never missing a step. "Now a 
Manhattan, you shake to fox-trot time. A Bronx, to two-step time. But a dry 
martini you always shake to waltz time." 
</P>
<P>
Then he pours the mixture into a waiting glass, olive ready, and with a 
flourish places the glass on a silver tray. It is immediately served back to 
him. He lifts the glass to his nose, savors the fumes and downs the thing. He's 
his own best customer. 
</P>
<P>
You aren't likely to find such a character in today's movies. It'd spoil the 
image of such modern heroes as John Rambo or Dirty Harry to be seen dancing 
with anything less lethal than a .44 magnum. But in the Golden Age of 
Hollywood, the only magnums shot were the kind that held Champagne. In 
celebrations, scenes of young love or tableaux of the haut monde, Champagne was 
a star. It was also a handy plot device. 
</P>
<P>
In "Ninotchka," Greta Garbo tastes the joys of capitalism with her first glass 
of the bubbly and is hooked. In "The Philadelphia Story," several glasses of 
Champagne (or as Cary Grant's character calls it, "the great leveler") jostle 
Katharine Hepburn off her high horse just long enough to make her realize she's 
about to marry the wrong man. Walt Disney's Dumbo even discovers that he can 
fly under the influence of the fizzy stuff. 
</P>
<P>
But as a dramatic prop, the cocktail is more versatile than Champagne: 
Sophistication, seediness or loneliness can all be determined by a character's 
call at the bar. Cocktail parties were all the rage in the '30s and '40s (all 
that industrial-strength Prohibition hooch cried out for mixers, and the 
tradition stuck). The smartest couple on the screen always had a well-stocked 
bar, and the leading man's better half was expected to be a sport and keep up 
with the boys -- Myrna Loy as Nora Charles, finding hubby Nick sipping his 
sixth martini, promptly orders six for herself. "Line 'em up," she tells the 
waiter. 
</P>
<P>
In "Casablanca," Humphrey Bogart is the hero most remember, but Paul Henreid 
got the girl and the most interesting drinks. Bogey spends most of the film 
drowning his sorrows in bourbon, straight. But when the very together Henreid 
escorts Ingrid Bergman to Rick's place, he orders Cointreau and, later in the 
evening, a Champagne cocktail (usually made with a dash of angostura bitters, 
sugar and a twist of lemon). The next night Henreid drinks cognac. It's only 
when talking man-to-man with Bogey that he drinks whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
A man of sophistication doesn't simply drink well; he knows how to mix a drink, 
too. This invaluable talent rightfully impresses Carole Lombard's well-to-do 
family in "My Man Godfrey." William Powell (yes, again) as Godfrey charms the 
lady of the house with a concoction called a Bloody Angeli ca that manages to 
cure the hangover of the Angelica in question. Godfrey calls his drink "a 
focusing agent" and is elusive about its ingredients. However, we learn that it 
involves a pinch of mustard and, like a Bloody Mary, tomato juice. (Angelica 
tells Godfrey: "You can run amok on the vodka.") Godfrey scores points with a 
European socialite (Eva Gabor) when he recalls her drink: French vermouth with 
a dash of cassis and a soda chaser. 
</P>
<P>
As the '50s began, Hollywood's love affair with cocktails was showing signs of 
strain. In "All About Eve," Bette Davis' character prefers her Scotch straight. 
At one point someone offers Davis' Margo Channing a bottle of soda water to mix 
with her drink, only to be met by the steely gaze of those infamous Bette Davis 
eyes. As Joseph Mankiewicz, the film's Oscar-winning director and screenwriter, 
put it in the script: "She looks at it (the soda bottle) and at him, as if it 
were a tarantula and he had gone mad." 
</P>
<P>
Later, Davis throws a big bash but serves her guests inferior liquor. When the 
bartender asks, "Does Miss Channing know she ordered domestic gin by mistake?" 
Davis retorts, "The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests. They're 
domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns." 
</P>
<P>
Although "The Apartment," made in 1960, shows the "martooni" (as one character 
calls it) still going strong enough, the film features libations that would 
have made Nick Charles reach for his gun: frozen daiquiris in a Chinese 
restaurant, the deservedly obscure rum collins, and a Tom and Jerry made with 
hot whiskey (or bourbon), eggs, sugar, Jamaican rum, cinnamon, cloves and hot 
milk. Ray Walston (pre-Martian) brings his own, arriving by cab to Jack 
Lemmon's pad armed with his mistress and four long-stemmed glasses filled to 
the brim with the vile brandy and creme de menthe mixture known as a stinger. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly the cocktail, while surviving, had lost its classic reserve. As the 
'60s progressed, the cocktail was mostly used as date aid for bachelors on the 
make. Meanwhile, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in "Who's Afraid of 
Virginia Woolf?" didn't really care what they drank as long as there was ice. 
By the time "A Clockwork Orange" was made -- its futuristic Korova Milkbar, 
served not liquor, but drug-spiked milk -- the cocktail was in big trouble. 
Fortunately a few good drinking men were still around -- suave, sophisticated 
men who could hold their liquor with style: men like James Bond. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to his creator, Ian Fleming, 007 has perhaps the most detailed drinking 
preferences of all of Hollywood's star characters. Not only should a James Bond 
dry martini be shaken (never stirred despite the fact that shaking will cause 
the ice to start melting), it should be served in a deep Champagne goblet. In 
"Casino Royale" Fleming gives the exact recipe for the perfect Bond martini: 
three measures of Gordon's gin, one of vodka, and half a measure of Kina 
Lillet, shaken until ice-cold, and served topped with a large, thin slice of 
lemon peel. Unfortunately for easily disillusioned Bond fans, martini experts 
point out that Kina Lillet has quinine in it and would tend to make a martini 
bitter. 
</P>
<P>
One of Bond's favorite alternatives is bourbon on the rocks -- Old Grand Dad, 
Walker's Deluxe or I. W. Harper, please. He's also partial to old fashioneds 
and Negronis (1/3 gin, 1/3 Campari and 1/3 red Cinzano). In outdoor cafes, say 
in Paris, Bond shuns vodka, whiskey and gin. Although Pernod is proper for such 
an occasion, legend has it that Bond won't drink the stuff because the licorice 
taste reminds him of his childhood. Instead, he drinks Americanos (Campari, 
Cinzano, soda and a large slice of lemon peel) while dining alfresco. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, James Bond cannot single-handedly save the world for cocktail 
fans, and frankly, it's much easier for bartender-less party hosts if their 
guests drink beer, wine, or the hard stuff straight or on the rocks. The 
obvious drift is toward the simpler drinks. Except for the occasional vamp, 
that's what we're seeing on the screen. But if you long for the concoctions of 
former days, we recommend Hollywood's Musso and Frank. It's benefits: a 
star-studded clientele (many from the good old days); movie-set decor (real 
red-leather booths), and a bartender who never forgets a face. Here Hollywood's 
Golden Age lives on -- and the martini is still king.

<LEADPARA>  SEAN Connery felt fettered and humiliated in Bond-age. Roger Moore, never a
serious actor to begin with, had a lark with James Bond, whom he played as a
clown in Savile Row tweeds. Timothy Dalton, perhaps the cleverest of the
bunch, is using good old 007 to get his pick of, well, more interesting
roles.;    Currently, Dalton, 47, is playing '30s matinee idol/Nazi spy
Neville Sinclair in Disney's "The Rocketeer." It's a deliciously cheeky turn,
part haughty Olivier, part seedy Errol Flynn (right down to the pencil-thin
mustache). Dalton says the role was tailored for him.  </LEADPARA>

EPIC HERO  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "When I first read the (comic book-inspired) script, I didn't want to play
the part. Sinclair was written in a very one-dimensional way. The guy was just
a pompous ass. Disney told me, 'We're going to rewrite the entire script, move
the character from being a cartoon to a much better role.' I wanted to exploit
the fact that he's an actor, to find moments when he seems to be one thing but
is really lying through his teeth. I wanted to show how phony actors can be. I
loved doing it.";    The spy who loved Mae;  Dalton says his favorite line
comes during the knockdown, drag-out with the hero aboard a German zeppelin.; 
  The line "I always do my own stunts" (in response to a Rocketeer put-down),
right?;    "No, it comes a little later. I based my whole performance on it.
It's when Sinclair says, with wonderful arrogance, 'It wasn't a lie, it was
acting.' What nonsense! Acting is lies, but it's also the truth. The whole of
his life this German agent is pretending.";    Little wonder Dalton could
identify with the character. In one manner or another the Welsh actor has been
"pretending" since his late teens, when he attended London's National Youth
Theater and Royal Academy. "Extreme good luck" led to a supporting role
opposite Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn in "The Lion in Winter" and roles
in "Mary, Queen of Scots," a "Wuthering Heights" remake (as Heathcliff, of
course) and "Agatha.";    A different kind of luck led Dalton to Mae West's
"Sextette" and the worst of the comic-strip fantasies, "Flash Gordon" and
"Brenda Starr" (with Brooke Shields as the intrepid reporter).;    This fall
Dalton will don doublet and pantaloons and set sail as New World explorer
Christopher Columbus in Ilya and Alexander Salkind's $40 million "Christopher
Columbus: The Discovery." Then, he'll renew his license to kill for his third
Bond outing, a still-untitled cliffhanger that will attempt a comfortable
middle ground between the farcical Moore Bonds and Dalton's darker "Licence to
Kill." "Licence" received high marks from Bond enthusiasts but brought in a
disappointing $40 million in domestic ticket sales.;    "We were the victim of
a not particularly good advertising campaign on 'Licence,' " Dalton says.
"Then, too, we opened whilst 'Batman,' 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' and 'Indiana
Jones and the Last Crusade' were still going strong. We were like the sixth or
seventh big movie. It was a very bad time to open, but worldwide 'Licence' did
better than 'The Living Daylights' (Dalton's first Bond outing), which was the
biggest grossing Bond movie for 10 or 12 years.";    At the time, it was
reported that Dalton's license to kill was revoked because he was the least
popular of the Bonds. Dalton rankles at the memory.;    "No, that was never
discussed," he fairly hisses into the phone. "Stupid, irresponsible
journalism. . . . One telephone call to 'Cubby' Broccoli (the series'
producer) could have gotten the truth.";    The next Bond, referred to vaguely
at MGM as "Bond No. 17," is still on the drawing board. Dalton explains: "The
script isn't finished, but what I've seen is outrageous. It's a formative
script that obviously needs some work, but when it's finished it'll combine
the best of 'Daylights' and 'Licence,' with some good tough humor.";    It's
tricky attempting to pump a sense of jeopardy back into the series while
holding on to the vermouth-dry humor of the best Connery Bonds, "From Russia
With Love" and "Goldfinger," Dalton concedes.;    "We definitely have to have
more humor in the Bond movies, but I don't want it to be campy humor or a
sendup. I dearly love Roger Moore, but if you talk about the best Bonds,
you're talking about Sean Connery and not camp or sendup. In the '70s and
early '80s, the Bond pictures were dominated by gadgetry and technical
effects, which were often superb. I found them uninvolving. Connery's Bond was
a human being. Cynical and dry, mind you -- but a man with a man's sense of
humor and a certain world-weariness.";    0017;    Dalton explains that Bond
No. 17 was derailed when MGM/UA, the distributor of the series, was taken over
by Pathe and everything went into a legal limbo. "This time last year we were
supposed to go into production, but since the takeover nothing has happened.
There's great uncertainty at MGM now.";    Though contractually obligated to
play Bond, Dalton is his own actor between assignments. "I'm perfectly free to
do whatever I want," he says with a sniff.;    Connery, likewise, did other
films during his time out of Bond-age -- most notably "A Fine Madness" and,
for Hitchcock, "Marnie" -- but he complained bitterly over a PR campaign
designed to make his name synonymous with the Ian Fleming super spy. That was
before Superman, Batman and indeed Rocketeer came along to break Bond's
monopoly on cliffhanger suspense.;    "They did a big push to mold the public
impression of Bond -- of Connery as Bond," says Dalton. "The series was unique
back then. There weren't any movies like 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' It was the
first of the big, high-rolling action-adventure films.";    The mood is
changing in Hollywood, Dalton believes. Spectacle for spectacle's sake is no
longer enough. Big-budget vehicles such as "Robin Hood" and "Hudson Hawk" are
already passe.;    What about his upcoming Columbus project, scripted by Mario
Puzo and due to get under way in September or October in Spain and the
Caribbean? That sounds like a classic Hollywood "costumer" of the type Olivier
and Flynn once made.;    Nothing could be further from the truth, Dalton
says.;    "We're not doing a historical, two-dimensional pageant. We're not
doing a school-book treatment. You won't be watching waves sloshing past
boats. This will not be a dry history lesson; it will be about the inner
struggle of the man. It will be done with passion and vision and be full of
details that nobody knows.";    That's the crowning irony, Dalton says. The
man who discovered the Americas is unknown in America.;    "You don't know
anything about him really. All you know is that he sailed across the Atlantic
and hit America. He was an extremely obsessive man with a great vision. He had
a great sense of ambition. He was very poor and wanted to get rich. He wasn't
Spanish, and he was probably part Jewish at a time when they were burning
Jews.";    If everything goes as planned -- and nothing goes as planned when
you're shooting at sea -- the Salkinds' "Columbus" will be in theaters in
October 1992, just in time to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Columbus'
docking at what is now Watling Island in the Bahamas.;    Hot on its rudder
could be a Paramount Pictures version titled simply "Christopher Columbus."
This version is being described as an earthier, more psychological handling of
the Italian explorer who, in the summer of 1492, sailed for Ferdinand and
Isabella of Spain.;    Paramount's "Columbus" is being hyped as a possible
Gerard Depardieu vehicle, with Ridley ("Thelma &amp; Louise") Scott set to direct.
In contrast to Dalton's Columbus, who sounds like a more traditional hero,
Depardieu's man from Genoa has been described as a manipulator and a martinet
who dies in poverty and disgrace.;    Dalton feels the Atlantic is only big
enough for one Columbus saga.;    "I've not read their script, but the
competition is not a good thing," he says. "They (Scott and Depardieu) are
good people. I wish them luck. But I would be lying if I told you that I feel
comfortable about this. It doesn't please me. It ain't going to be good to
have two Columbuses in theaters at the same time. But it only makes us more
ambitious to be the better one.";    If box-office history is a measure of
such things, they're well on their way to becoming a hit, reasons Dalton, who
takes a strong interest in the business side of things.;    "Of course past
grosses are no guarantee of quality or success," he agrees, "but in this case
they are in some sense good grounds for a movie. Puzo wrote the 'Godfather'
movies. The Salkinds did the 'Superman' movies. There are my two Bonds. George
Cosmatos (the director) did 'Rambo: First Blood Part II' and 'Cobra.' Among
us, we've made several of the top-grossing films of all time. That's cause for
optimism.";    Any trepidation about spending a good part of next fall on the
high sea?;    "I love water," he says. "And the boats are wonderful. The
Spanish government has built replicas of the Pinta, the Nina and the Santa
Maria as part of their 500-year celebration. They're letting us use them.
They're tiny, tiny boats. When they sail off, they're like little dots on the
sea." (box)  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Sean Connery Awarded First Oscar for ``The Untouchables''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sean Connery, the quintessential Agent 007 in
such James Bond films as ``Dr. No'' and ``Never Say Never Again,''
won his first Oscar Monday night for his portrayal of the steely
Irish cop in ``The Untouchables.''
   Connery received his second standing ovation of the evening as
he accepted the best supporting actor award, saying ``patience is
truly a virtue.''
   His first standing ovation came at the top of the 60th annual
Academy Awards ceremony when he introduced the visual effects award
amid a spectacular backdrop of cinematic magic.
   In a 30-year film career, which includes about 40 pictures,
Connery's Oscar also represented his first Academy Award nomination.
   Winning created a certain dilemma, Connery said on stage,
because he had promised to give the award to his wife.
   ``This evening I discovered backstage that they're worth $15,000
and now I'm not so sure,'' he said, then added, ``I'm only
kidding.'' The statuettes actually are worth about $200 each.
   He ended his acceptance speech by saying: ``If such a thing as a
wish accompanied this award, mine would be that we ended the
writer's strike.''
   The strike by the Writers Guild of America against movie and
television producers is now in its fifth week.
   Connery was handpicked by Ian Fleming to play James Bond in
``Dr. No,'' and starred in six more of the spy films including
1983's ``Never Say Never Again.'' He also has appeared in such
films as ``The Great Train Robbery'' and ``The Name of the Rose.''
   Connery was chosen for the Oscar from among nominees Albert
Brooks, ``Broadcast News''; Morgan Freeman, ``Street Smart'';
Vincent Gardenia, ``Moonstruck,'' and Denzel Washington, ``Cry
Freedom.''

   ``License to Kill'' (CBS-Fox Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98. Rated
PG-13)
   
   Bond _ James Bond _ is a grim figure in ``Licence to Kill,'' in
which the secret agent takes on a murderous Latin drug lord in
Florida and Latin America. While earlier 007 films offered a sly,
roguish charmer given to jaunty double entrendres, ``Licence to
Kill'' serves up a moody, humorless Bond.
   Which is to say, no Bond at all. Bond, played by Timothy Dalton
in his second 007 film, is upstaged this time by the gadgetry and
special effects.
   Worse, not even the villain lives up to the usual standards.
While previous villains were often megalomaniacs who wanted nothing
less than the entire world, Sanchez _ played with reptilian charm
by pockmarked Robert Davi _ is a bad guy of almost real-life
proportions. He's not much worse than some of the drug lords making
headlines these days.
   In place of Bond, ``Licence to Kill'' offers lots of violence,
including a few gruesomely creative ways to die, and the usual
fiendish weapons, as unveiled by gadget scientist Q.
   Davi is so believable that his character comes off as
conventional. Talisa Soto is perfectly wooden as Sanchez's _ and
later Bond's _ love interest, and Carey Lowell plays an agent whose
most alluring quality is the way she keeps her gun in a thigh
garter.
   But without a compelling Bond, ``License to Kill'' rarely rises
above the level of a good episode of ``Miami Vice.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   
   ``Road House'' (MGM-UA Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95. Rated R)
   
   The Double Deuce is a down and dirty bar where the low-rent
patrons mix it up at the slightest provocation, a toilet of a place
so mean that someone hits a blind guitarist in the face with a
bottle. Then comes Dalton (Patrick Swayze).
   Dalton _ a bouncer with fists of steel, Zen-like calm and a
philosophy degree from New York University _ weeds out the
undesirables among his bouncers, schools them in self-restraint and
has the place looking like a yuppie nightspot in no time.
   But in doing so he runs afoul of Brad Wesley, a high-class thug
who bleeds local merchants for protection money and at one point
flips a coin to decide who will live and who will die.
   This is a violent tale as simple-minded as a comic book, and
this bouncer-with-a-brain stuff is a little much.
   But ``Road House'' is packed with action and rollicks along to a
rip-roaring ending.
   Swayze (``Dirty Dancing'') gets the job done as a sort of
next-generation, shirtless Clint Eastwood, playing a squinty-eyed
loner from out of town who takes on the local bully. Ben Gazzara is
a stylishly evil Wesley.
   ``Road House.'' See it in the safety of your own home.

17F:THE LIFE OF IAN FLEMING by Donald McCormick Peter Owen Pounds 18.50, 232
pages
IN 1966 John Pearson wrote a good biography of Ian Fleming, who had died,
only 56, two years before. Its weakness was that it became extremely sketchy
about the last years, so much so that many readers must have guessed that
Pearson had run into problems, presumably with the widow, Ann, formerly Lady
Rothermere.
This book, which is no way a serious biography and scarcely a 'reappraisal'
as claimed but a series of observations on Fleming's interesting life, is
free of that inhibition. Donald McCormick, aka Richard Deacon, is a former
journalist colleague of Fleming and an frequent author in the spy stakes. He
was one of Fleming's stringers after the war and writes about him with
affection.
Not surprisingly, McCormick confirms that the Ian/Ann marriage had been
difficult for years. He did not enjoy her social life and she was
contemptuous of his creation of James Bond; their lives had moved apart and
his final years do not sound happy. The interest here is to signal various
items missing from Pearson which may one day figure in another biography.
The emphasis lies on the war years with Naval Intelligence.
For example, there was a Polish woman friend called Christine Granville, a
brave and distinguished Second War spy, later murdered, who may have been
'Vesper Lynd' in Casino Royale. There was also an important German woman
friend called Vanessa Hoffman with a mysterious role inside Nazi Germany who
seems to have vanished without trace. Similarly, we did not know that in the
war Fleming was once involved with Aleister Crowley in astrological and
occult ceremonies which eventually may have influenced Rudolf Hess's flight
to Scotland. More, please.
It also seems to be suggested that Fleming's establishment of the 'Mercury'
news service for the Kemsley papers in the 1940s, in particular for the
Sunday Times, had links with British Intelligence: in view of the stick the
Observer was later to take for its hiring of Philby, the subject has more
than curiosity value.
We could do with another life of Fleming, not because he invented James Bond
but because he was an interesting Establishment figure. The fact that Bond
became a bore - as his creator understood better than anyone  - does not
deny that.

"James Bond" Triumphs: Timothy Dalton, star of the latest James Bond films, was 
awarded unspecified libel damages at a London court Tuesday from the publishers 
of a North American movie magazine that suggested he was going to be booted 
from the Bond role. Dalton's lawyer, Philip Conway, said the reports in Globe 
magazine that the actor could be dropped to save future James Bond films from 
financial disaster were untrue and had distressed and embarrassed him. Conway 
said the producers of the films were very satisfied with Dalton's performances 
in "The Living Daylights" and "Licence to Kill." GREG BRAXTON

Well, at last. Monday was Albert (Cubby) Broccoli Day in Los Angeles. The 
producer of the James Bond films was feted at the premiere of the latest, 
"Licence to Kill," through an evening that began at about 6 p.m. at the 
Directors Guild of America building and ended long after midnight at the Bel 
Age Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone was there, including Mayor Bradley, complete with a Broccoli Day 
proclamation. Broccoli, whose career spans more than half a century and 27 
films, has a great many friends in The Biz, and nearly all of them showed up 
(except two of the Bonds -- Sean Connery and Roger Moore). When all the 
celebrants crushed into the Directors Guild cocktail arena (which doubles as a 
theater lobby at less festive times), conversation can get heated. And so can 
the celebrants. Add in most of the press corps of the Western world, with 
flashbulbs and minicams, for an extra-hot event. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wary of Questions 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Bradley was cooking. He deflected deftly all requests to name his 
favorite Bond film. "I'm smart enough as a politician not to identify any one 
of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
As this was also a premiere of Broccoli's latest Bond film, starring Timothy 
Dalton, everyone was wary of questions regarding their favorite Bond, although 
Broccoli was brave enough to remark that the golden-throated Dalton is "the 
best actor of the lot." 
</P>
<P>
(A random furtive sample taken on the scene demonstrated, however, that Sean 
Connery is still the favorite.) 
</P>
<P>
Broccoli found himself a bit puzzled by all the festivities. "I don't know what 
it's all about. And I'm getting nervous." 
</P>
<P>
Dalton, chatting in a corner, suggested that the women should be asked to 
determine why he is "so attractive." And modest. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Like a Roast 
</P>
<P>
Dalton said that the Bond films endure because "Mr. Broccoli has never cheaply 
exploited any of his previous films." And this, once again, was the case with 
"Licence to Kill," applauded over and over again by the audience, which 
included "Licence" beauties Talisa Soto and Carey Lowell and former Bond 
heroes, heroines, villains and villainesses including Richard ("Jaws") Kiel, 
Maud Adams, John Rhys-Davies, Lois Chiles, Patrick Macnee, Martine Beswick and 
Grace Jones. And there was Miss Moneypenny herself, Lois Maxwell, plus 
celebrities galore, not to mention Ringo Starr. 
</P>
<P>
After the screening, the more than 400 guests squeezed into the banquet 
facilities at the Bel Age Hotel to pay tribute to Broccoli. It was more like a 
roast. Macnee emceed. Wayne Newton, whose first major motion picture this was 
(he plays Professor Joe Butcher), was just beside himself. "Gosh, this is 
great!" he said as Macnee took to the podium to introduce David Picker, the 
former head of United Artists, who gave the go ahead to "Dr. No" back in 1962.

<HEAD>Sean Connery's Son to Play Ian Fleming in TV Movie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jason Connery, son of the consummate James Bond,
Sean Connery, is to star in a television movie as Ian Fleming, the
author and creator of Agent 007.
   ``Freud would have a field day with this one,'' Jason Connery
said in this week's People magazine.
   ``The thing is that I'm compared continually to my father _ so I
thought, if it's a good script, just do it,'' he said. ``People
will say what they want to anyway, so I didn't feel any pressure.''
   The younger Connery says his famous father hasn't intruded in
his acting career.
   ``Dad and I have a very good relationship, but when it comes to
acting, it's important to make your own decisions,'' he said.
   The made-for-TV movie, ``The Secret Life of Ian Fleming,'' will
be televised March 5 on the TNT cable network.

FT  25 JUN 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Stirred, but not shaken - Ian Fleming invented
a heresy for James Bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Not so long ago a friend confessed that he had been to Dukes Hotel in St
James's, central London, and ordered a dry martini. The barman at Dukes,
Gilberto Preti, is rumoured to make the best martinis in London, but my
friend found that he had been unable to finish the glass: it was just that
bit too strong, and just a little bit too dry.
It is that austere and uncompromising side of the martini which makes it the
greatest of cocktails. One's first martini should be a baptism of fire: a
martini is a John Wayne of a drink which separates men from boys. It is one
of the very few things I look forward to when crossing the Atlantic, for
Americans are deeply serious about martinis.
In 1977 President Jimmy Carter launched a famous attack on the
'three-martini lunch' as a symbol of the progressive decadence of the
American business world. American drinking habits are distinctly odd. They
drink three cocktails then sit down to iced water rather than wine with the
meal. It is all a bit like a general who unleashes a terrible artillery
barrage at the enemy lines at the beginning of a battle, then forgets to
send in the troops. Three pre-prandial martinis would seem to be a lethal
dose.
A great deal of mystique surrounds the creation of a martini, but the recipe
looks deceptively simple. The Savoy Cocktail Book (Constable, Pounds 6.95)
gives the following: '1/7 dry vermouth; 6/7 dry gin, stir well with ice and
serve with a squeeze of lemon rind.' Which is certainly only half the story.
In order to find out the other half, I went along to a tasting of dry
martinis at the Atlantic Bar and Grill in Piccadilly, London's latest
late-night haunt. Five top London barmen were standing with their cocktail
shakers in their hands: Dick Bradsell from the Atlantic; Salvatore Calabrese
from the Lanesborough; Peter Dorelli from the Savoy's American Bar; James
Scott from the Groucho Club in Soho; and Lado Stojanovic from Maxwells in
Covent Garden.
Judging between the five was hard work indeed. All displayed a very high
level of professionalism. Bradsell's, Calabrese's and Dorellis were quite
similar in style - all three were deeply lemony. Dorelli's was slightly
different in that it was served, minus the peel in the original Savoy
cocktail glass; justified by tradition, but ever so slightly nude.
Stojanovic's was the least dry of the five, in that it was the only one in
which one could detect the flavour of vermouth which made it half way to a
gin and French. Scott's was possibly the driest, in that not even the lemon
was able to dent the armour of the gin.
What surprised me were the choices of gin.
They were unanimous in their condemnation of Gordons and its new 37.5 per
cent bottling, but all five had selected gins at 40 per cent. Of these, two
were Beefeater, two Bombay Sapphire and one, Booths. Contrary to the
teaching of great barmen beyond these shores, who use export strength gin at
around 47 per cent, these British barmen insist that their relatively weak
martinis are the best. American customers, they maintain, are astounded by
their delicacy after the fire-water they drink at home. I have to say I was
not wholly convinced by this argument.
Of the other elements which go into a martini, four out of five favoured
Martini Extra Dry as their vermouth, while the one remaining barman used
Noilly Prat. In the main, the vermouth does not end up in the drink, being
either swirled round the glass or the shaker. Clear, fresh, quick-frozen ice
was absolutely indispensable; and it should be stirred, not shaken: shaking
bruises the gin. This little heresy was introduced by Ian Fleming of James
Bond fame.
Another heresy was the olive. Dorelli thought this went back to the film
MASH, where one of the characters is offered an olive-less martini and
exclaims: 'What no olive? You can't drink martinis without olives]' You can,
apparently. An olive will just make your cocktail oily.
I emerged from the tasting slightly light-headed and not wholly convinced
that I had really got to the bottom of the martini debate. Next stop Dukes.

   When a medical emergency arises on the set of a
movie, it's not always part of the script.
   So when Dr. James D'Orta is not setting a broken bone at
Baltimore's Franklin Square Hospital or patching up a shooting
victim at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washington, the
emergency medicine specialist usually can be found on location.
   D'Orta is the founder of LifeStar International, a
Washington-based medical consulting firm that expands the walls of
the emergency room to movie sets.
   He and his colleagues have provided advance planning and
emergency medical care on the set for three recent movies:
``Licence to Kill'' and Arnold Schwarzenegger's ``Total Recall,''
both filmed in Mexico City; and ``The Abyss,'' an underwater
thriller filmed in an abandoned nuclear power plant that was
converted into a film studio in Gaffney, S.C.
   ``We're like the sprinkler heads in skyscrapers,'' said D'Orta.
``Producers with vision can see the necessity of taking preventive
measures to ensure the safety of their crews. It's several hundreds
of millions of dollars of movie budgets that we're protecting.''
   According to the New York-based Center for Safety in the Arts,
more than 1,000 injuries are reported each year in the U.S. film
industry, and since 1980, at least 19 people have been killed in
helicopter accidents on movie sets. Actor Vic Morrow and two
children were killed in 1982 during the filming of ``Twilight Zone:
The Movie,'' and five people died during the filming of Chuck
Norris' ``Delta Force 2,'' in the Philippines last May.
   D'Orta, 38, started the company after accompanying his
producer-cousin, Albert ``Cubby'' Broccoli, to Morocco to film
another James Bond movie, ``The Living Daylights,'' released by
United Artists in 1987.
   It was D'Orta's job to keep the new James Bond, Timothy Dalton,
and the rest of the cast and crew in good health while the movie
was filmed in the oasis of Ouarzazate, in the Sahara Desert. Time
lost on the set because of injuries or illness cost more than
$250,000 per day, or about $500 per minute. The doctor's work also
took him off the film set and into what he described as ``a
real-life James Bond drama.''
   He was approached in the desert by soldiers who were seeking
help for the victim of a motorcycle accident, the guard to the
prince of Bahrain.
   ``They said, `The prince will give you anything if you will come
and help us,''' D'Orta said. ``When we got there, the prince was
begging me to help the man and the guy was lying unconscious on the
street. He had a blood clot on the brain.''
   To the amazement of passersby, D'Orta inserted an intravenous
needle and hooked the patient to a cardiac monitor. The 007
airplane was summoned to take the guard to a hospital in Rabat,
Morocco.
   Mission accomplished, D'Orta left the hospital, but was stopped
by soldiers demanding his passport.
   ``I told them, `It's back in the desert on the movie set,'''
D'Orta said. ``They put me in a room where I sat and drank tea for
six hours until the king gave permission for me to leave.''
   D'Orta's patient recovered after surgery.
   ``If it weren't for Jimmy, I don't think he would have lived,''
said Michael G. Wilson, who produced and wrote the Bond flick.
``It's that kind of response that is very important to us, so when
it came time to film our next movie, we wanted him back.''
   D'Orta drafted Dr. Craig Feied, an emergency physician at George
Washington University Medical Center in Washington, and Vincent
Young, a Harvard business graduate, and founded LifeStar.
   D'Orta, Feied and a network of hundreds of emergency physicians
throughout the country have traveled to movie sets in such places
as the Philippines, Austria, Tangiers, Mexico and the Soviet Union.
In addition to motion pictures, the company also provided medical
consultation for Amnesty International's 1988 Human Rights Now!
concert tour, which performed in major cities all over the world.
   D'Orta also helped coordinate emergency medical teams after the
1985 earthquake in Mexico City, and was part of a group of
physicians who traveled to the Soviet Union after last fall's
earthquake in Armenia.
   ``The thing that makes us different from other entrepreneurs and
businessmen is that we truly practice medicine,'' D'Orta said.
``That gives us more credibility.''
   LifeStar uses computer links to the World Health Organization,
the Centers for Disease Control and the State Department to analyze
everything from rumors of unrest in Grenada to reports of a new
outbreak of resistant malaria in Zambia. The company checks each
person's immunizations, types their blood and has access to blood
that has been screened to be disease-free by U.S. and British
standards.
   Because many medications in the United States don't have exact
equivalents in other countries, LifeStar sends along a well-stocked
portable pharmacy. Detailed plans are made for rapid transport to
medical facilities in the event of injury or illness, and once the
filming begins, LifeStar physicians remain on the set.
   LifeStar's prices vary depending on the size of the production
and the risks and planning required, Young said.
   ``Any major film production can afford us,'' Young said. ``If
you compare what it costs for our services with what it would cost
without our services, it is free or very cheap for film producers.''
   Wilson agreed.
   ``It's a reasonable expense and it's worthwhile because they do
an excellent job and can turn a disaster into no time lost,'' he
said. ``When Tim (Dalton) cut his finger (during the making of
`Licence to Kill'), if we'd had to stop filming to take him to the
hospital, we would have lost at least half a day of filming. That
could mean anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000.
   ``But we had a doctor on the set who could stitch him up
immediately. We think Tim got better quality medical care and we
were able to go right on filming.''
   Lee Proimos, of Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., a Los
Angeles-based firm that insures 60 to 75 percent of all feature
films, said fast, effective medical care means fewer production
delays, reduced risk of lawsuits and lower insurance rates.
   ``It's a good situation for the actors, the crew and the
production company and it's good for the insurance company,''
Proimos said.
   Although his work appears to involve the glamour of Hollywood,
D'Orta says the LifeStar doctor is ``the one dose of reality in a
world of make-believe.''

<TEXT>  The movies' latest Robin Hood is played by a star people are comparing with
the film heroes of old, men like Gary Cooper and Jimmy Stewart. But Costner
has his own perspective on what heroism in the movies means. "The movies
represent what happens when the hero acts in the heat of dilemma, and that's
really what films are all about for me: dilemma," Costner told Us. "You're not
sure what the hero will do. We like to think that he will do the right thing.
And we admire the right thing -- in movies. We don't necessarily admire it in
our own world, because we know it's political suicide. . . . In real life, Mr.
Smith would never have gone to Washington. He would have been made to look
like the village idiot. He would have been locked up. It would be made out
that he hadn't paid his taxes and had eight affairs. He would be done. And he
would be the same man. Integrity is out of fashion. Maybe that's why we
respond to it in films." Costner has finished work on Oliver Stone's JFK, in
which he plays conspiracy theorist Jim Garrison -- whose integrity people have
been known to question.;  BROOKE SHIELDS; (box) Hey, Mom, let's double-date;
Her Brenda Starr film spent years on the shelf, and Brooke is now perhaps more
famous for being famous than for any achievements as an actress. Even her
modeling gigs are not a big deal anymore. She's made news by attending
Princeton and by dating George Michael and multimillionaire Dodi Fayed. But at
26, she's still under the watchful eye of her mother, Teri, who accompanied
her to an interview with Garth Pearce. Mom, Brooke said, "is the most
important person in my life. We do everything together." That must put some
limitations on her love life, no? "She's better at choosing my boyfriends than
I am myself," Brooke says. "When I see someone I really like I give her the
eye that inquires, 'What do you think?' I can never remember a time when I
really liked someone and she did not.";  TIMOTHY DALTON; (box) From James
Bond, with relief; Dalton co-starred with Brooke Shields in Brenda Starr and
has a part in The Rocketeer, but is better known as the latest James Bond. And
like others who've played that part, he knows how it can affect your life. He
tries not to let it get to him, he told Premiere. "A film isn't real; it is
artifice. The thing is a piece of pretend. actors who become their characters
-- why, it's absurd. I believe it's real at the moment of working, but, I
mean, I know it's not. To go round as Bond after I leave the set -- why, the
next step would be the lunatic asylum." Still, that didn't stop Britain's
tabloids from running a report that he received a death threat while filming
Licence to Kill in Mexico: "I suppose they thought it was fun, a death threat
made to James Bond, but it wasn't fun for my mother, who read about it. My
mother still believes it, and thinks I've been lying to make her feel
better.";  GEENA DAVIS; (box) Another learning experience; Davis used to tell
people that she saw herself and Jeff Goldblum as like Hume Cronyn and Jessica
Tandy. Not that Cronyn and Tandy ever made films like The Fly and Earth Girls
Are Easy, of course, but they represented a working marriage. Now Davis and
Goldblum are phfft. "Well, yeah, who knows?" she said when the Los Angeles
Times asked her about it. "Obviously one hopes for the best and one enters
relationships hoping for the best . . . but some things don't work out. . . .
I just feel in general that whatever happens in life is not only for your life
good and right and appropriate and a learning experience, but you can use it
in your work too." That puts a new spin on Thelma and Louise if you want to
think about it.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     The KGB? The CIA? The SNP?;   SNP?;   Well, maybe "paymaster" is a bit
strong.;   "We could never afford to pay Sean Connery," said Alex Salmond. "He
did it because he has been a long-term sympathizer over many years. Now he's
turned that sympathy into active support.";   Sean Connery established the
film role of Ian Fleming's super-spy, James Bond, Agent 007, licensed to kill.
For years, he portrayed the randy English spy with a taste for vodka martinis
(stirred, not shaken), ever prepared to give his all for queen and country.;  
But which country, exactly?;   Scotland, it seems. Connery has shown his true
colors by making a television broadcast on behalf of the Scottish National
Party, urging Scots to transfer their loyalties from London to the ideal of an
independent Scotland.;   The party, which just concluded its convention in
Inverness, was jubilant. Connery is the world's most famous Scot. He is very
popular back home. SNP membership applications shot up by more than a
thousand.;   "That is a substantial increase," said Salmond, head of the
party. Connery's support for Scottish independence may have been the best
thing to happen for the cause since Scotland surrendered its sovereignty in
the Act of Union with England in 1707, a sovereignty that at least some people
have been trying to reclaim ever since.;   Salmond hopes the support for the
SNP created by Connery's coming in from the cold can be translated into
concrete advances, maybe even an increase in the number of seats the party
holds in the British House of Commons -- now five of the 72 seats for
Scotland.;   The SNP is the third-largest party in Scotland. The Labor Party
commands the allegiance of 43 percent of Scots, the governing Conservatives 25
percent, SNP 19 percent and the Liberal Democrats 11 percent.;   But that
doesn't mean the SNP's message is without appeal. In fact, polls show that 37
percent of Scots favor independence from Britain. Salmond's task is to get
those people to join or actively support the SNP.;   "If we get that," he
said, "then we can negotiate independence from England. We're talking about
real independence, of taking our place as a separate nation within the
European community.";   Connery's independence instincts, heretofore subdued,
were apparently stimulated when he visited Edinburgh in June and was honored
as one of the sons of the city. The actor was born in nearby Leith.  </TEXT>

CRITIC AT LARGE: THAT'S A WRAP: END OF MGM/UA THAT WAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The transmogrification of the old Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is, as it turns out, the 
end not of one era but of two. The purchase of the MGM/UA Communications Co. by 
Pathe Communications Corp., completed at the start of November, is the last 
cutting of the cord to the MGM that was. The new logo will be MGM-Pathe. And at 
the same time the UA logo will disappear into history after 71 memorable years. 
</P>
<P>
By present plan, "Rocky V," just being released, and the next (and probably 
final) James Bond film will be the last to carry the United Artists label. 
</P>
<P>
The great MGM lot that Louis B. Mayer built is now the home of Columbia, a 
Japanese corporation. From somewhere up in the clouds, Louis B. Mayer and his 
arch-rival, Columbia's Harry Cohn, must both be gazing down with extremely 
mixed emotions at what Mammon hath wrought. 
</P>
<P>
From adjoining clouds Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks and D. 
W. Griffith could look down with equally mixed emotions. The four of them had 
founded United Artists in 1919 with the thought that they would enjoy a good 
deal more creative freedom -- and very likely more money -- if they made and 
distributed their own films. 
</P>
<P>
In the silent era, the company did well, releasing films by the founders and by 
others as well, including Buster Keaton. For a while in the '30s UA also 
released the films of Sam Goldwyn and Alexander Korda. 
</P>
<P>
But there were problems. Mary and Doug, America's sweethearts, ceased to be 
such. D. W. Griffith, ill and out of favor in a changed Hollywood, could no 
longer work. In later years, Pickford and Chaplin did not speak at all. As the 
'50s began and television was making its heavy inroads in Hollywood, UA was 
virtually moribund. Pickford wanted to sell; Chaplin resisted; Mary won. 
</P>
<P>
New owners, led by Robert Benjamin and Arthur Krim, took over from the founders 
in 1951 and led UA into a golden era that lasted just over a quarter-century. 
The company had no production facilities, which once seemed a handicap but 
which, in the post-television era of independent production, suddenly became a 
virtue. Under David Picker and subsequent production executives, UA's operating 
philosophy of approving a project, providing the money and then leaving the 
filmmakers alone was almost unique in the industry. It paid off. 
</P>
<P>
UA had a smashing hit in Tony Richardson's sexy, witty period romp, "Tom Jones" 
(1963). It had the lucky foresight to finance the Harry Saltzman-Cubby Broccoli 
production of Ian Fleming's "Dr. No," which in 1962 introduced Sean Connery as 
James Bond 007 to a waiting world, thus begetting a hugely profitable series 
whose end is not yet. 
</P>
<P>
The hands-off policy at UA attracted Woody Allen, whose unique contracts with 
the company allowed for two week at least of reshooting if Allen wanted it. The 
association began with "What's New, Pussycat" in 1965, which Allen wrote but 
did not direct. 
</P>
<P>
An impressive string of commercial and critical successes began to bear the UA 
label. There was an Oscar for best picture for "In the Heat of the Night" in 
1967, another for "Midnight Cowboy" in 1969. There were best picture Oscars for 
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Rocky" and "Annie Hall" in successive 
years, 1975-77, and a nomination the next year for "Coming Home." 
</P>
<P>
Then in the late '70s, Transamerica Corp. bought control of UA. The 
conglomerate was more accustomed to dealing with insurance policies than with 
creative artists, and at the start of 1978 the UA leadership departed en masse 
in rebellion against head office interference. They formed Orion Pictures. 
Woody Allen, significantly, also left to go with Orion. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest news out of UA in its Transamerica period was the horrendous 
cost-overrun on Michael Cimino's "Heaven's Gate," a $48-million loss from which 
UA as an independent entity never really recovered. Acquired by Kerkorian as an 
MGM hyphenate, MGM/UA has continued to release the James Bond films and the 
Robert Chartoff-Irwin Winkler "Rocky" productions. 
</P>
<P>
In the '80s, the UA or MGM/UA output grew thinner and thinner, and yet the firm 
released Martin Scorsese's "Raging Bull" (produced by Chartoff and Winkler) and 
the Oscar-winning "Rain Man." 
</P>
<P>
The decline and demise of a studio, or a production company like UA, is very 
much like the death of a magazine or a newspaper. It is the silencing of a 
voice, the loss of an option available to the writer or the filmmaker with an 
idea and a passion to see it made, a diminishing of choices and variety within 
the whole output of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
It means a dozen or more films a year that won't get made, any one of which 
might have turned out to be something special. 
</P>
<P>
The voice of a studio, like the voice of a publication, may sometimes have been 
foolish, superficial, shrill, cynical or any one of a number of other things a 
voice can be. But it may also have had its moments of greatness, when it rose 
above the mundane and created something of lasting worth and importance. 
</P>
<P>
Film history would be significantly poorer without the UA legacy, from its 
formative silent days, more particularly from its great period between the '50s 
and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
It made films -- I think immediately of Bob Fosse's "Lenny," with Dustin 
Hoffman -- that might not have found a home elsewhere in the industry. In 1974, 
a film about the controversial comedian Lenny Bruce was a bold commercial 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
With the notable exception of "Annie Hall," Woody Allen's films have been only 
narrowly profitable, a special urban taste almost unmarketable in some parts of 
the country. But the pre-Orion UA was a firmly supportive if occasionally 
nervous patron for him. And by now the Allen films constitute a body of work 
unique in its ever more aspiring creative intentions. 
</P>
<P>
There were UA flops; there always are, it being impossible to repeal the law of 
averages or unvaryingly second-guess the audience. But it is always the 
successes one looks to. The lesson of UA's hands-off regard for its filmmakers 
has not been lost, surviving at Orion and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Still, you watch with melancholy as the UA logo fades from the scene. In its 
various guises it has spanned three quarters of the life of American movies. 
Its best days had come and gone, but it leaves memories that will be a good 
deal slower to fade.

<DATELINE> You probably will see worse movies than "Jaws  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
    the
Revenge" this year. It's still July; the summer load hasn't
been completely dumped.
   This latest "Jaws," the fourth in the series, is doing good business, though the audience I saw it with didn't seem very scared, or very involved in any way at all. 
No one gasped when the shark (was it always so obviously fake?) chomped human snacks, nor did anyone boo or hiss at the silly lines and generally awful performances. 
No one did much of anything, not even squirm to indicate boredom. 

   The lumpish passivity around me would have been frightening had I not been an experienced television watcher. 
I, too, have from time to time settled into a kind of half-slumber in front of the tube, dumbly watching whatever flashed in front of me, comforted because I didn't have to worry about what would happen next since I could play out most of the stories with the dial turned off. 

   Perhaps foolishly, I look to the movies for more, but not now, not in the summer. 
Predictability lands as predictably as dog-day heat and high humidity. 
"Superman," "Revenge of the Nerds," "Beverly Hills Cop," and, of course, "Jaws" have all spawned box-office successes. 

   So the big question surrounding the latest James Bond picture was: Will the new James Bond satisfy the requirements of predictability? 
Would he be elegantly virile enough, would he pun satisfactorily, would he approach his cloak-and-daggering with the correct mix of irony and earnestness? 

   Eventually, Timothy Dalton will match his predecessors as 007, but he isn't ready yet to fill the gadget-armed shoes of Sean Connery and Roger Moore. 
He does look the part, however, in the latest Bond adventure, "The Living Daylights." 
Tall, skinny and handsomely cleft in cheek and chin, Mr. Dalton has a dark charm closer to Mr. Connery's than to Mr. Moore's. 
He seems a little stiff at times, but that might be, as a friend suggests, the thing he can't yet possess: the knowledge that he is a star. 

   The film makers have surrounded him with the usual Bond trappings but not with the usual bevy of beautiful babes. 
This Bond is a man of the '80s, a practitioner of safer sex. 

   As has become usual, the villains are no longer the Soviets, but a non-major power. 
For the 13th time Desmond Llewellyn is Q, the British secret service's gadget-meister, and, for the third time, Robert Brown is top spy M. 
The plot careens all over the place, as though the Bond manufacturers don't want us to pay too much attention to their new man. 

   They needn't worry. 
This Bond does fine in the one ongoing series that seems less objectionable than the rest. 
He will do even better in the next one, but for now it also helps that the producers have sent him to, among other great locations, Bratislava. 

   ---
   Actually, one interesting question did emerge from "Jaws -- the Revenge": Why would a marvelous actor like Michael Caine bother with it, even for money? 
In fact, he treated his secondary role respectfully, which only emphasized the amateurishness around him. 

   However, after seeing "The Whistle Blower," I figure Mr. Caine must arrange his performing schedule like this: one for the money, one for the show. 
"The Whistle Blower," a British spy film, is everything "Jaws" is not: taut, suspenseful, emotional, intelligent. 

   Julian Bond's terrific screenplay, adapted from John Hale's novel, uses wonderful language to delve into the relationships between fathers and sons, the British old-boy system, contemporary espionage. 
For example, when John Gielgud, as a traitorous aristocrat and elder statesman, explains why he did what he did, he says, sniffing: "It wasn't a moral decision, it was an aesthetic one." 

   Mr. Caine is one of those rare top-drawer actors who, with the slightest shifting of expression, can make you think you know what he's thinking or feeling. 
He plays Frank Jones, a middle-aged man who long ago quit rebelling and has since been trudging along. 
He's only slightly paunchy but seems heavy, resigned to the limits of life's promise. 

   But when his son, who works as a linguist for British intelligence, dies suddenly, after confiding his suspicions about the spy system to his daughter, something happens to Frank. 
You can almost feel the heat rising off Mr. Caine's cool surface as he transforms Frank from a go-along fellow into a dangerous man, a man who has nothing to live for but revenge. 

   Not "Jaws"-style revenge, of course. 
"The Whistle Blower" is that rare summer happening, a real movie.

Timothy Dalton, star of the latest James Bond films, accepted libel damages at 
a London court today from the publishers of a North American movie magazine 
that suggested he was to be replaced in the role. 
</P>
<P>
Dalton's lawyer, Philip Conway, said the reports in Globe magazine that the 
actor could be dropped to save future James Bond films from financial disaster 
were untrue and had distressed and embarrassed him. 
</P>
<P>
Conway said the producers of the films were very satisfied with Dalton's 
performances as Bond in "The Living Daylights" and "Licence to Kill" and with 
the financial return from them. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of damages paid by publishers Globe International was not disclosed. 
Their lawyer, Timothy Atkinson, told the court they welcomed the opportunity of 
setting the record straight.

<TEXT>
   Diana Rigg started her acting career in
Shakespeare, but she will be forever known as the exotically
beautiful, black-leather-clad counterspy on the British series ``The
Avengers.''
   Although that was more than 20 years ago, her stint as Mrs. Emma
Peel was unforgetable. Since then, other than a short-lived and
unmemorable American sitcom in 1973-74 called ``Diana,'' she has
rarely been seen in this country.
   Rigg makes up for it this season as she succeeds Vincent Price as
host of ``Mystery!'' on PBS at the start of the new season on
Thursday, Oct. 12. The show is an anthology of the best English
mysteries.
   ``I don't think there will be a major difference other than the
question of our personalities,'' she said on a visit to this country
to promote the show and tape her appearances at WGBH in Boston.
   ``Mystery!'' is noted for Edward Gorey's Gothic steel engravings
for the title sequences, and Gorey has designed a new black and
white set for the host that has a one-dimensional look.
   ``I'm not playing a part. I am myself. I suppose it will evolve,
but it's always dangerous to speak up front. I'd rather wait and
see. My job is to introduce each show. For those who know the
characters it's an affirmation and for those who don't it's an
explanation.
   ``Plus, we'll also take a wider approach to the subject at hand.
For example, we'll talk about the rules of law as they developed in
England for the `Rumpole of the Bailey' series. I like the idea of
giving a tidge of information.''
   Rigg recently completed a miniseries for the BBC called ``Mother
Love'' that may show up on ``Mystery!'' It's a decidedly different
role from Emma Peel.
   ``It's the story of a woman who brings up her son by herself
after her divorce,'' she said. ``She loves her son passionately and
believes he's never seen his father in the years since the divorce.
But the father and son carry on a deception, and when the mother
finds out, murder and mayhem ensue.''
   She plays the mother, David McCallum (``Man From U.N.C.L.E.'') is
the father and the son is James Wilby, who stars in a new version of
``A Tale of Two Cities'' for ``Masterpiece Theatre'' this season.
   ``The Avengers,'' British television's version of James Bond,
starred Patrick Macnee as a suave secret agent in a bowler. It was
witty, absurd and diabolical. His first female partner was Honor
Blackman, who left to play Pussy Galore in the Bond movie
``Goldfinger.'' Rigg was his partner, Emma Peel, when the show began
its run on ABC in 1966. She stayed with it two years, then was
replaced by Linda Thorson. It left ABC in 1969, but was later seen
on late-night on CBS.
   ``It was a very stylistic show and it set the tone for a lot that
followed,'' she said. ``It certainly set the pattern for women as
equal partners. James Bond hasn't reached that yet. It was ahead of
its time and quite original for television.
   ``Emma Peel saw herself as the equal of any man. She could
compete without being strident. Patrick and I chose a very
tongue-in-cheek approach. That made it more fun for us and more
believable for the audience. There's no question that people
remember me most for `The Avengers,' but one has to move on. You
don't expect an artist to paint the same picture over and over.''
   Rigg played a Spanish contessa in the 1969 Bond film ``On Her
Majesty's Secret Service.'' It was the only movie in which 007 got
married and in which George Lazenby played Bond. She and Price, her
predecessor on ``Mystery!'' were in ``Theatre of Blood'' in 1973.
   Rigg, who is married to British producer Archie Sterling, said
she has tapered off her career since the birth of her daughter 12
years ago. Still, she was in a new version of ``Witness for the
Prosecution'' for CBS and recently was on the stage in London in
``Follies.''

      Elsewhere in television:
   MACNEE SIGNED _ Patrick Macnee, who was dandy secret agent John
Steed on ``The Avengers,'' has been signed to co-star in ``Blood
Sport,'' based on the Dick Francis mystery novel. Ian McShane and
Lloyd Bochner also star in the three-hour segment of ``The Mystery
Wheel of Adventure,'' a series of 10 syndicated mystery movies for
independent stations.

Tobacco companies that pay to have their cigarettes displayed prominently in 
major motion pictures -- as in "Superman II," "Supergirl" and the upcoming 
James Bond movie, "License to Kill" -- may be breaking the law if the movies 
are shown on TV or without a health warning, a congressman charged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Thomas Luken (D-Ohio) called the promotional spots in movies, which he 
said amount to paid advertisement, a violation of congressional bans against 
cigarette advertisement on television or elsewhere without a health warning by 
the surgeon general. 
</P>
<P>
Luken, chairman of the House subcommittee on transportation and hazardous 
materials, said tobacco company Phillip Morris agreed to pay $350,000 to the 
makers of "License to Kill" to have Lark cigarettes used in the film as one of 
James Bond's secret weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco companies are on the attack seeking to increase their power and 
influence while continuing to recruit new addicts to the smoking habit," Luken 
said. "These movies reportedly do not carry the surgeon general's warning (and) 
the movies are shown on television, which is absolutely prohibited by law." 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Phillip Morris called Luken's press conference "an attempt to 
curtail people who make artistic decisions," and said the "film maker has 
absolute discretion as to the content of the film and we stand behind that 
100%." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Taylor, director of communications for Phillip Morris, said that in the 
last 10 years, her company has only paid for movie promotions twice and 
defended the James Bond deal by saying that the movie is being produced outside 
the United States and will be distributed internationally. 
</P>
<P>
However, Luken called that argument "the usual evasion" and predicted it would 
not hold up in court if the case were brought to trial. 
</P>
<P>
Luken said he has written a letter to U. S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh asking 
him to consider "prosecution of those persons and companies involved in 
contracting for blatant advertising of cigarettes in movies." 
</P>
<P>
The letter requests that the attorney general investigate whether federal laws 
are being broken and to determine what steps, if any, could be taken to stop 
the activity. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that paying to have a particular cigarette appear in a movie is in 
fact an advertisement," he said in the letter. "I request that you investigate 
these payments." 
</P>
<P>
No one at the Justice Department was available for comment on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of paying for visibility in movies has become fairly common in 
recent years, most notably in the smash success "E.T.," where Reese's Pieces 
candies were prominently displayed. 
</P>
<P>
But Luken said that deals involving tobacco products violate laws that do not 
apply to other products. "It is a federal crime to violate any provision of the 
Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertisement Act," he said. 
</P>
<P>
In "License to Kill," Luken said, James Bond uses Lark cigarettes as a secret 
weapon, while a spokesman for the Coalition on Smoking or Health said that 
"Lois Lane smokes constantly" in the Superman movie.

<TEXT>
   Videocassettes of Rambo and James Bond movies and
Western news clippings of the Chernobyl nuclear accident were among
``ideological contraband'' seized from foreigners by Soviet
customs, Tass reported Thursday.
   The official news agency did not say exactly when or over what
time period the seizures of pamphlets, books and videocassettes
took place, only that separate incidents were involved. The
dispatch was based on an article in Whistle, a newspaper of the
railroad ministry.
   Among the confiscated material were 500 ``anti-Soviet''
publications taken from two British students, identified only as D.
Warrowsmith and D. Dows. Tass said the two were at the Brest
checkpoint in Byelorussia on the Polish border when the material
was discovered.
   ``The subversive literature had been supplied to them by a
`charity' organization concerned about the alleged `suppression' of
(religious) believers,'' Tass said.
   Tass said the two had planned to distribute the material in
Minsk and Moscow, where they were headed on tourist visas.
   Under Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of ``glasnost,'' or
openness, many formally banned authors have been published in the
Soviet Union and state-run media have tackled previously taboo
subjects. But the Tass announcement of the seizures made it clear
glasnost does not extend to material considered ``ideological
contraband.''
   Another case described in the Tass report involved a woman
identified as N. Bashkatoff of Belgium. She allegedly was carrying
several leaflets and clippings from ``the bourgeois press with
fabrications about the Chernobyl accident, concealed in her
luggage.''
   ``She also attempted absent-mindedly to leave behind in her
train compartment a maliciously slanderous book called `Moscow
Quadrille,''' Tass said.
   Another tourist, who was not identified, was caught carrying
dozens of copies of ``People on the March,'' a pamphlet which
authorities say urges Soviets of ethnic German origin to emigrate
to West Germany.
   ``Some of the latest items of ideological contraband include
video recordings of various sermons, karate lessons, with a
sadistic bent, pornography and anti-Soviet films like `Rambo' or
the James Bond `Afghan Series,''' the dispatch said.
   The latter was apparently a reference to the James Bond movie
``The Living Daylights,'' in which the fictional British agent 007,
played by Timothy Dalton, outwits the Soviet army in Afghanistan.
   Soviet officials have bitterly complained that Sylvester
Stallone's muscled Vietnam War veteran Rambo presents a negative
stereotype of Soviets.
   The report from Tass said people carrying material judged to be
ideological contraband will be deported from the Soviet Union.

'LICENCE': A DARKER VERSION OF BOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time marches, age withers and everything falls into decay . . . except James 
Bond, still spruce and deadly after all these years. 
</P>
<P>
The series has been with us since 1962 and, like many another old timer, tends 
to repeat itself. Yet, every once in a while, it pulls in its stomach, pops the 
gun from its cummerbund, arches its eyebrow and gets off another bull's-eye. 
The newest, "Licence to Kill" (citywide), is probably one of the five or six 
best of Bond. 
</P>
<P>
At first, it's hard to suggest why. "Licence" (the title is deliberately 
anglicized) milks the formula as before: a mix of sex, violence and exotic 
scenery, with Bond on a one-man raid against an archetype of evil, while 
seducing women and taking in sights. Here, the locales include the sea-spray 
expanses of Key West and the garish palaces of Mexico City disguised as a 
fictitious "Isthmus City." 
</P>
<P>
Yet the overall tone has gotten more burnished, somber. The new movie sends the 
new Bond, Timothy Dalton, on a desperate one-man vendetta against an apparently 
omnipotent South American cocaine czar. And it isolates him, kills or maims 
three of his best friends, strips him of his rank, his government, his very 
license to kill. It leaves him with almost nothing but his wits -- and dear old 
chic-weapons expert Q (Desmond Llewelyn), who pops up ex officio with another 
bag of lethal cameras and exploding toilet accessories. 
</P>
<P>
It even strips away a little libido. As Timothy Dalton plays the role -- with 
wolfishly sad eyes -- this is a more wounded and sensitive Bond than we've ever 
seen, the sort of Bond the late Laurence Olivier might have imagined. (The look 
is there, but not the lines.) Bond's appetite for sex seems more distracted, 
tentative. His women -- Carey Lowell as a helicopter pilot and double agent, 
Talisa Soto as the drug czar's faithless mistress -- are more self-sufficient. 
His armor has sprung a leak. 
</P>
<P>
Where Sean Connery was wry and self-confident and Roger Moore natty and 
self-mocking, Dalton projects something strange for a hero identified with 
impeccable sadism: inner torment. The walk is tense; cigarettes pour out fumes 
of Angst; the smile carries a hint of pain. 
</P>
<P>
Connery always seemed to be enjoying the world hugely -- and he carried the 
audience along with him, made them enjoy it as much as he did. Roger Moore 
didn't seem to be enjoying the world so much as ignoring it and, instead, 
enjoying himself -- or perhaps some internal reflection. Dalton, by extreme 
contrast, doesn't project much enjoyment at all. He projects pain. And pain, 
obsession and revenge are what "Licence to Kill" is all about. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a film about an urbane adventurer, moving with eerie confidence 
through a violent, chaotic world. It's a film about a bereaved friend, 
half-crazed with grief, relying on his instincts and professionalism to carry 
him through a situation rotten with peril. Like Stallone's Rambo or Eastwood's 
Dirty Harry, this Bond has been stiffed by the world and abandoned by his 
government. He is a loner, driven by overwhelming personal hurts -- confronted 
with a cool, sexy foe who, in some curious way, almost recalls the old Bond. 
</P>
<P>
Previous villains in the series tended to be older, more urbane, wicked 
paterfamilias figures. Instead, Robert Davi, a heavy in "Die Hard," makes Franz 
Sanchez -- who's modeled on modern drug kings like Carlos Lehder of Colombia's 
Medellin cartel -- a sexy adventurer who metes out rough justice with style and 
merciless sarcasm. And he has a code: loyalty matters to him more than money. 
Against this new-style villain, Bond, the dark angel, twists what seems to be 
Sanchez's only good quality -- his insistence on loyalty -- against him, trying 
to strip away his friends one by one and convince him of their treachery. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to isolate Bond as well as Sanchez. Yet it leaves him with everything 
that counts: the gimmicks, the archetypes, the formulas, the old jokes of a 
full 27-year and 16-film tour of duty. Like all Bond movies it has its 
set-pieces, chief among them a roaring, rousing Mad Max-style climactic, 
exploding chase involving three Kenworth trucks, jeeps and a small plane set on 
a desolately beautiful Mexican mountain road. It's planned and staged with the 
exquisite carnage of a silent comedy car chase, with gags topping gags, and 
surprises leaping over each other -- just as one flaming truck leaps over the 
plane. 
</P>
<P>
Produced and co-written by old hands Albert Broccoli and Richard Maibaum (whose 
tour dates back to 1962's "Dr. No"), directed and co-written by new veterans 
John Glen and Michael G. Wilson, the movie whips up a combustible brew of old 
and new. Is it just updating the new cliches: the incessant car crashes, 
gruesome sadism, heavy hardware, feistier heroines? (Just as there used to be 
obligatory sexpots-in-distress, Carey Lowell almost seems an obligatory lone 
wolf.) Perhaps -- but all those movies stole from the Bond films, too, often 
draining out the crucial elements that make them fun: self-kidding humor and 
exotic locales. 
</P>
<P>
"Licence to Kill" (MPAA-rated PG-13, despite extreme violence and suggestions 
of sex) has the usual bursts of illogic, the gratuitous sex or violence. But 
gratuitous sex or violence have always been fixtures of Bond's world. Often the 
formulas grate on you. Here, they ignite. This is a guilt-edged Bond; there's a 
core of darkness and pain in the glittery world exploding around it.

   George Meegan went out for a stroll and walked
right into the Guinness Book of World Records.
   Meegan appeared at the Guinness World of Records exhibit on
Tuesday to receive a certificate honoring his walk through the
Americas _ a 19,017-mile jaunt that took seven uears and four
months and was completed in 1983.
   Meegan, a resident of Kent, England, is the author of ``The
Longest Walk: An Odyssey of the Human Spirit.'' He walked from the
tip of South America to the end of Prudhoe Bay in Alaska, crossing
14 countries.
   While receiving the certificate, he also gave his boots to the
Guinness exhibit. He then delighted the crowd by showing off the
tattoo on his leg, a map of his route.

   Four teen-agers say they have unraveled the
mystery behind a stolen powder blue chiffon dress belonging to the
pop singer Madonna. But police say they aren't sure if the teens'
story is ``true blue.''
   The dress was taken Friday evening from a mall display sponsored
by the cable music station MTV and awaits identification by
officials from the exhibit, Detective Ralph Fluhart said on Tuesday.
   Fluhart said the teen-agers told police they found the dress in
the bushes near the mall on the night of the theft.
   But he said their story leaves some unanswered questions, such
as why the dress didn't appear soiled or to have been wet, although
it was raining the night of the theft.
   ``It was in the same condition it was in when it was stolen,''
Fluhart said.
   The pop singer wore the low-cut sequined frock in the video for
the song ``True Blue.'' She donated it for MTV's Museum of
Unnatural History, currently traveling across the country.

   Actress Barbara Stanwyck recently
spent 2{ weeks in the hospital for a back problem that has plagued
her for the past 25 years, her publicist said.
   Miss Stanwyck, who turned 81 on Saturday, was released earlier
this month from St. John's Medical Center where she was admitted
for treatment of the recurring back ailment, spokesman Larry Kleno
said on Tuesday.
   ``She still has 10 fractured vertebrae which flare up from time
to time,'' he said. ``When the pain gets so excruciating, she goes
to the hospital for heat pack treatment.''
   Miss Stanwyck originally injured her back while performing her
own horse riding and other stunts in films and during the 1960s
television show ``The Big Valley.''
   Miss Stanwyck was nominated four times for Academy Awards and
received an honorary Oscar in 1982 for the body of her work. She
has won three television Emmy Awards.

according to his publicist.
   Dennehy, 50, and the former Miss Arnott, 31, were married Sunday

   After the wedding, Dennehy and his new wife sailed around Sydney

   But Dennehy then had to return to the United States to prepare

remained in Australia to work as costume designer for the
Australian miniseries ``Tana Mera,'' based on the fall of Singapore
during World War II.
   Dennehy has appeared mostly in television movies and miniseries.
He played an American cop chasing murderers in Moscow in the 1983

   Jonathon ``Chico'' DeBarge pleaded
innocent to charges he was involved in a cocaine trafficking ring,
a week after the pop singer was dropped from an anti-drug telethon.
   DeBarge, 22, was arraigned Monday on the drug charges. If
convicted, he faces a maximum of life imprisonment and a $4 million
fine.
   U.S. Magistrate Hugh W. Brenneman Jr. allowed DeBarge to remain
free on a $400,000 bond pending a pretrial conference in two weeks.
   Jeffrey Kildow, head of the local U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration, said DeBarge, his brother, Robert, and five other
men brought large quantities of cocaine from California to sell in
Michigan.
   Robert DeBarge, arrested last week in California, is to be freed
on a $50,000 bond.
   Last weekend, DeBarge was dropped from the Los Angeles Sheriff's
Department anti-drug telethon following his arrest.
   The telethon was to raise money for the Substance Abuse
Narcotics Education program, or SANE, which is a 3-year-old project
to teach elementary school children how to avoid drugs.

<HEAD>Actor Who Played ``Goldfinger'' Dead At 75</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   German actor Gert Froebe, a gifted
comic who became famous as the gold-craving criminal in the 1964
James Bond film ``Goldfinger,'' died of a heart attack Monday. He
was 75.
   Froebe was born Karl-Gerhard Froebe on Feb. 25, 1913, in Planitz
in what is now East Germany. He was a natural-born comic, described
by critics as Germany's version of American Danny Kaye.
   Froebe played in nearly 100 films, including roles in the 1961
U.S. production ``The Longest Day,'' and the British-produced ``The
Magnificent Men and Their Flying Machines,'' filmed in 1964.
   But he was best known internationally for his role as the greedy
villain ``Goldfinger'' who battled Sean Connery's James Bond in the
film version of the Ian Fleming thriller.
   In 1965, Froebe made headlines when he was quoted by the British
newspaper Daily Mail, as saying: ``Naturally I was a Nazi'' during
the Third Reich.
   Froebe denied making the comment and insisted: ``What I told an
English reporter during an interview ... was that during the Third
Reich I had the luck to be able to help two Jewish people, although
I was a member of the (Nazi) party.''
   Despite Froebe's denial, Israel banned all of his films for
months until a Jewish man, Mario Blumenau, informed the Israeli
Embassy in Vienna that Froebe hid Blumenau and his mother from the
Nazis.
   In a statement issued Monday, Froebe's agent Pal Berkovicsa said
the stocky actor died of a heart attack at 1 a.m. in a Munich
hospital, where he underwent an operation after suffering a heart
attack a week ago.
   Froebe studied theater under Dresden actor Erich Ponto and Paul
Guenther in Berlin during the early years of Adolf Hitler's Third
Reich.
   After theaters were closed by the Nazis in September 1944,
Froebe was called into the German army, where he served until the
end of World War II.
   In his first major role in a film, ``Berlin Ballads,'' which
opened in European cinemas in 1948, film critics wrote: ``Germany
has a new Danny Kaye.''
   Froebe is survived by his fifth wife, Karin. He has two sons by
previous marriages, Utz and Andreas.

<LEADPARA>  'THE Marrying Man," from Disney, starring those tempestuous show-offs, Alec
Baldwin and Kim Basinger, isn't exactly setting the world on fire. In the
words of industry smarties, the film is already "bound for video.";    Baldwin
and Basinger were the objects of much-heated gossip during the making of this
movie and they also scored somewhat negatively when they appeared as
presenters on the Oscars. Now, Baldwin has given a blistering interview for
the May 16 issue of Us magazine in which he takes off on Hollywood ethics
generally and Disney in particular. He tells writer Leslie Van Buskirk: "With
most people in this town, you could rape their mother and set her on fire, but
if we close the deal, shoot the movie and it's a hit, hey, let's get out there
and sell this picture!"  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     He adds, "I don't think Disney knows . . . about making movies. They can
sell movies, but I think they know less than anyone else in Los Angeles about
the making of films. It was a terrible, terrible experience making a film for
Disney. Of course, that's based on my experience. I have to throw that in a
lot. Credit that to my lawyer.";    Having dug a hole for himself with
Disney's powerful execs, Baldwin continues: "I want to do great acting roles
for me. I don't give a . . . what Mike Ovitz thinks about me. I care what Mike
Ovitz's gardener thinks of me.";    As you know, if you haven't been under a
rock, Mike Ovitz is chief agent at CAA, a mover and shaker.;    I hope Baldwin
is taking a course in landscape gardening on the side. It never hurts to have
an alternate career when you are making a career out of insulting those who
hire, fire and exert influence.;    BY THE BOOK: Gen. Colin L. Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will offer his first written
appreciation of the men and women who served in the gulf war -- by writing the
foreword to a new book about the Allied victory.;    Random House publishes
"Triumph in the Desert: The Challenge, the Fighting, the Legacy" on Memorial
Day.;    HEAVENLY ROLE: Maybe you read in Variety about how Robert Evans is
going to make a big comeback producing "The Saint" from a Terry Hayes
screenplay, to be directed by Renny Harlin for Paramount.;    Evans has said
he is a long way from even thinking about casting. Evidently, there are others
in Hollywood who are thinking about saintly casting.;    I do mean Ted Hartley
and Dina Merrill, the new owners of RKO who are Mr. and Mrs. in private life.
While Evans owns the rights to 56 "Saint" properties, it seems Hartley and
Merrill found the rights to 11 other "Saints" in their own archives.;   
Perhaps you recall actor Pierce Brosnan was invited, a few years back, to play
James Bond in "The Living Daylights," but he could not get NBC to release him
from "Remington Steele." Timothy Dalton became the fourth 007. Now Brosnan is
talking to RKO about playing their "Saint." (If he gets the role, he'll follow
Roger Moore, who he could have succeeded as James Bond!)  </TEXT>

   Reclusive multimillionaire Doris Duke has
adopted a 35-year-old woman who has been living with her for three
years, her lawyer said.
   Miss Duke, 75, adopted Chandi Hefner, an ``environmentalist,
preservationist and conservationist'' who spends her time ``doing
things as a good citizen as Miss Duke does,'' attorney Donald A.
Robinson said Friday. The adoption took place Thursday.
   Miss Duke, who owns a walled, 2,700-acre estate in north-central
New Jersey, attracted publicity when she allowed Imelda Marcos to
take her private jet from Hawaii to New York to face federal
racketeering charges and posted bail for the former Philippines
first lady last week.
   Robinson said Miss Duke and Miss Hefner met socially in Hawaii
and New York, where Miss Duke also maintains homes.
   Miss Hefner, who also owns property in Hawaii, had been
``estranged from her family for a number of years,'' has never been
married and has no children, he said.
   Robinson would not comment on whether Miss Hefner would become
the heir of Miss Duke, who has been married twice and has no other
children.
   Miss Duke, the daughter of James B. Duke, the tobacco and
electric power magnate and benefactor of Duke University, has a
fortune estimated by Forbes magazine at $800 million and by her
former business manager at $2.5 billion.

   Actor Timothy Dalton suffered a slight wrist
injury while filming a scene for the next James Bond film, ``License
Revoked.''
   In the scene, Bond, played by Dalton, had just been exposed as a
mole in a drug lord's cocaine laboratory and was supposed to dangle
from the end of a conveyor, his feet inches from a grinding machine.
   But during Thursday's shooting, Dalton's watch caught on a metal
hook as he flipped off the end of the conveyor, causing a slight
cut. Dalton completed the scene after a doctor patched the injury on
the set.
   In the movie, Bond's 007 license to kill is lifted by the British
secret service. Despite that, he goes after the drug lord, played by
actor Robert Davi, to avenge an assassination attempt on an American
CIA agent.

   Gov. Thomas H. Kean plans to buy a weekend
house in the exclusive Pottersville section of Bedminster, the heart
of New Jersey fox hunting country, his spokesman said.
   The two-floor, nine-room masonry house with a barn and pond is
located in north-central New Jersey.
   ``The governor is very much an outdoors ... type,'' spokesman
Carl Golden said Friday. ``When he saw the opportunity to purchase a
property in an area that's still rather unspoiled, he took it.''
   Pottersville is part of the Somerset Hills area, whose rambling
mansions house such well known figures as former automaker John Z.
De Lorean and magazine publisher Malcolm Forbes.
   Golden said the price and seller would not be disclosed.
   Kean's choice of quarters has drawn intense interest since his
election in 1981. He was roundly criticized several years ago for
buying an island beach property in New York's Long Island Sound at
the same time he was appearing in television commercials extolling

The Man With the Golden Gun (ABC Sunday at 8:30 p.m.), the ninth James Bond 
adventure, is virtually interchangeable with its predecessors, except that the 
double-entendres seem broader than ever. This time Agent 007's (Roger Moore) 
chief nemesis is Christopher Lee, in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
Of Pure Blood (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.), a 1986 TV movie, starts out credibly but 
becomes routine and predictable. Based on the Nazis' infamous Lebensborn 
program, which paired SS "supermen" with Aryan women to produce a "master 
race," it stars Lee Remick as a German-born American woman confronted with her 
past. 
</P>
<P>
The four-hour 1987 TV movie Hands of a Stranger (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m., 
completed Monday at 9 p.m.) is a raw and terrifying nail-biter that captures 
some of the heat, passion and suspense of Robert Daley's best-selling story 
about a cop's obsession with his wife's mysterious rape. Armand Assante and 
Beverly D'Angelo star. 
</P>
<P>
Beach Party (Channel 5 Monday at 8 p.m.), starring Frankie Avalon and Annette 
Funicello (natch), kicks off a week of American International "beach party" 
pictures of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
In Jumpin' Jack Flash (Channel 11 Monday at 8 p.m.) Whoopi Goldberg, cast as a 
computer whiz caught up in espionage, makes this 1986 feature seem lots hipper 
than it really is. 
</P>
<P>
The James Bond series got off to a rousing start in 1963 with Dr. No (ABC 
Monday at 9 p.m.), which found Sean Connery's incomparable 007 taking on his 
first master villain (Joseph Wiseman). 
</P>
<P>
Anne Bancroft and her husband Mel Brooks attempted a 1983 remake of Ernst 
Lubitsch's To Be or Not to Be (Channel 11 Tuesday at 8 p.m.) in an effort to at 
last work together. They play stars of their Warsaw acting company on the eve 
of the Nazi invasion. There are amusing moments scattered here and there, but 
the comedy-adventure misfires because Brooks lacks the crucial Lubitsch touch 
and because we know far more than in 1942 the full extent of the Nazi evil, 
especially in regard to the fate of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Sadie and Son (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) is an overreaching 1987 TV movie that 
asks us to accept Debbie Reynolds as a Jewish New York cop who ends up teamed 
with her own son (Brian McNamara), a failed comedian. 
</P>
<P>
Dragnet (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is the entertaining 1954 feature which 
Jack Webb adapted from his long-running radio and TV series. 
</P>
<P>
The impressive 1982 TV movie World War III (Channel 11 Thursday at 8 p.m., 
completed Friday at 8 p.m.) imagines a tense confrontation between the U.S. and 
the Soviet Union. Rock Hudson, David Soul and Brian Keith star. 
</P>
<P>
Grease (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m.), that garish, amusing 1978 musical of 
high school life in the '50s, stars an appealing John Travolta and Olivia 
Newton-John. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hara's Wife (Channel 7 Thursday at 9 p.m.) is a 1982 theatrical release that 
was better suited to TV in the first place. Edward Asner stars as a workaholic 
attorney opposite Mariette Hartley, struck fatally by a massive brain 
hemorrhage but who returns on a ghostly mission to urge Asner to start living 
before it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
In the title role of Popeye (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.), Robin Williams is 
fun and so is Shelley Duvall as Olive Oyl, but the Robert Altman film is 
nevertheless curiously lifeless. 
</P>
<P>
George C. Scott stars in the admirable 1986 TV movie version of The Murders in 
the Rue Morgue (CBS Friday at 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Jean Renoir's celebrated, panoramic 1938 La Marseillaise airs on Channel 24 
Friday at 9 p.m. and Channel 28 at 11 p.m. as a celebration of the 200th 
anniversary of Bastille Day. It depicts the turbulent events that took place 
between July 14, 1789 and Aug. 10, 1792, culminating in the defeat of the 
Prussian infantry. Pierre Renoir and Louis Jouvet star. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday brings two Sam Peckinpah pictures, the so-so World War I epic, Circle 
of Iron (Channel 5 at 8 p.m.) and the exciting, amoral The Getaway (Channel 13 
at 9 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Since Mac Davis and Jackie Gleason star in the amiable 1982 The Sting II (ABC 
Saturday at 9 p.m.), it's a good thing it's a variation of rather than a sequel 
to the Newman-Redford "Sting." 
</P>
<P>
S.O.B., Blake Edwards' always audacious, often hilarious and sometimes 
appalling, vitriolic Valentine to Hollywood, airs on Channel 9 Saturday at 10 
p.m.

The ratings checks on movies in the TV log are provided by the Tribune TV Log

<MEMO>  Books
Pisetzner, former critic for the Bergen (N.J.) Record, is writing a novel.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  Putnam, 798 pp., $24.95;  IN EXERCISING his America-centric world view of
politics and firepower, Tom Clancy is a true capitalist. His latest novel
features the DDI of the CIA, a SAC of the FBI, the KGB, the Pentagon's NMCC
and some mobile SAMs and underwater UGMs with tolerable CEPs. At one point,
Clancy's recurrent hero, Jack Ryan, says, "OK, I want DO, DI, DS&amp;T in here
immediately," and then realizes, "I forgot about FOBS.";    Doubtless,
Clancy's followers will want to read this ASAP. (It's due in stores Aug. 7.)
The big question is: Will they be ready for the SEX?;     We're not talking
acronyms here, but mild acrobatics in the beds of various homes, hotels and
Air Force One. We're talking sentences like, "Her breasts dangled deliciously
before his eyes," and one memorable passage in which a woman at a formal
reception accuses another of being involved with a battery-operated device.;  
  Such scenes share center stage with more familiar motifs in Clancy's most
speculative, most ambitious and least polished piece of storytelling.;    "The
Sum of All Fears" is a post-glasnost tale of terrorism that postulates what
might happen if, in the middle of a period of international cooperation, a
nuclear device leveled part of a major American city.;    The final quarter of
the book, in which Ryan of the CIA battles to save the world from Armageddon,
is nearly breathless -- the pace Clancy fans have come to expect. But for the
meticulous Clancy to arrive at that snapping point -- where the deputy
director of the CIA can seize the hot-line to Moscow out of the hands of the
U.S. president -- requires 600 pages of groundwork and assorted fillings, some
of them painful. Be prepared, then, for several passages in which the
president exercises his virility with his female national security advisers
while the Ryan beefcake stock takes a dramatic plunge. There is also a long
and arguably unnecessary treatise on how one might arrive at a just peace in
the Middle East.;    Such is the fallout of glasnost.;    Clancy's
resourcefulness as a topical writer and forecaster of world events was
strained by the end of the Cold War. Strained but not defeated: Clancy has
taken glasnost at full value and concentrated on its likely consequences. What
happens to all the secret police of Eastern Europe who are suddenly
unemployed? To the terrorists who relied on them for sanctuary? To the
military weapons no longer cocked and aimed? To the soldiers responsible for
them? From these speculations and a few synthetic coincidences, Clancy
conceives a plot of renewed hatreds and terror.;    But to develop it, Clancy
is compelled to examine the motivations of his villains. That means leaving
the familiar stomping grounds of military orders and looking into the human
heart. It is a clunky business. For one of his villains, Clancy typically
writes: "How would he make them pay? Russell asked himself. He didn't know,
and really didn't know, and really didn't care. Just so there was something he
could do." The result could be an entry in a Robert Ludlum write-alike
competition.;    Literary hazards abound. Foremost is the question of
credibility. The details in Clancy's surprising first book, "The Hunt for Red
October," seemed so authentic that the author was questioned by federal agents
about his sources. But with the reappearance of Ryan and his friends in each
succeeding novel except "Red Storm Rising" (written while the character was
the focus of a copyright dispute), Clancy has been forced to compromise. The
expanding mythos of his characters has left less room for reality.;    "The
Sum of All Fears" overflows with figures from previous novels. Casual
allusions, such as to the execution of the Irish separatists from "Patriot
Games," soften the authenticity that has been Clancy's strongest asset. In
terms of self-indulgence, the world of Jack Ryan is still kilometers from that
of Ian Fleming's James Bond, but the distance is diminishing.;    Second is
the character of Ryan himself. Intelligent, arrogant, instinctive, insecure,
self-absorbed, gentle, loving, idealistic and occasionally murderous, Ryan
isn't an amalgam -- he's a thesaurus. Clancy likes him, if not as alter-ego
then at least as family. But no one should treat family the way Clancy treats
Ryan. For this latest reunion, he makes Ryan a heavy drinker (Fleming did the
same to Bond), and then he makes him an impotent lover (where Fleming never
dreamed of treading), setting up a strained subplot in which Cathy Ryan
suspects her husband of an extramarital affair.;    A considerable chunk of
novel follows this thread and a parallel one, about the president's own
private congresses, leading to the subtle suggestion that in the end, when the
planet is about to go up in flames, gland-standing counts for little. It is
suspected that with a less popular writer, the editor might have simply taken
one look and said "Forget it." But Clancy's "Clear and Present Danger" was the
best-selling work of fiction of the 1980s; for its follow-up, Clancy probably
would have been allowed to retain a love scene between a submarine commander
and a tuna sandwich.;    The most curious section of the novel, occupying most
of the opening, concerns Ryan's successful effort to broker an end to the
Palestinian-Israeli dispute. The simplicity of the solution and execution make
this the least convincing scenario of any of Clancy's books, but the author
may have felt the emotional need to include it anyway, as a counterbalance to
the most convincing portion: the one about the assembly of a hydrogen bomb.;  
 Clancy writes in great, though sometimes vague, detail about how Arab and
German terrorists construct a two-stage bomb. In the novel's afterword, Clancy
admits he was stunned by how easily he obtained these details himself. (He
deliberately obfuscated some of them, he says.) "The fact of the matter is
that a sufficiently wealthy individual could, over a period of from five to
ten years, produce a multistage thermonuclear device," he writes.;    With
such a prospect on one hand, and a history of happy endings for his novels on
the other, Clancy probably felt compelled to create optimism in the vision of
a Middle East at peace, a crossroads of tolerance like some modern-day
Ephesus. To borrow the words of another best-selling author, "tis a
consummation devoutly to be wished." Should this piece of Clancy forecasting
ever be fulfilled, the rest would be readily forgiven.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Engelhard Restructuring Away From Its Well-Known Metals Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The restructuring of Engelhard Corp., the
metals and chemical company once headed by the supposed model for
James Bond nemesis Goldfinger, could mean higher profits and a
clearer corporate identity, analysts said Friday.
   Engelhard, a leading metals refiner and maker of gold and silver
products, says it is selling those businesses to concentrate on
chemical production and its promise of higher profit margins.
   The Iselin-based concern also has announced a restructuring that
will shed 500 salaried jobs from its 8,100-member workforce and
shut a number of plants worldwide.
   Engelhard stock fell $1.12{ a share to $20.37{ on the New York
Stock Exchange Friday.
   The restructuring announced Thursday prompted Engelhard to take
a $160 million charge on 1989 earnings, giving it a $77.5 million
loss for the year. Fourth quarter losses were $145.9 million
compared with a $19.3 million profit a year earlier.
   Revenue for the year rose $52 million, to $2.4 billion.
Engelhard spokesman Francis X. Vitale Jr. said the restructuring
and sale of businesses should pare away 35 percent of its revenue.
   Thomas Van Leeuwen, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
in New York, said the restructuring was overdue and that the
company's performance had stagnated in the past five years.
   Engelhard's performance has been hurt by a diversion of
management attention to its electronics business and by competition
from other major makers of catalysts, such as W.R. Grace and Union
Carbide, Van Leeuwen said. Catalysts are used in petroleum refining
and chemical manufacturing.
   Cyclical changes in refining also have hurt. With increased
amounts of lighter grade crude oil coming on the market, smaller
amounts of catalysts are needed to break the oil down into
petroleum products such as gasoline, said analyst Jeff Cianci of
Bear Stearns &amp; Co. in New York.
   Shedding the metals business could help focus attention on the
operations that actually constitute Engelhard's main business,
possibly giving investors a better idea of the company's prospects.
   ``Investors have mistaken the true identity of this company in
the past,'' said Van Leeuwen. Many do not realize it does not
produce gold and silver but only makes products from them, and also
that it has substantial chemical operations, he said.
   Engelhard does have the nation's largest gold and silver product
manufacturing plant, located in Plainville, Mass.
   The company was founded in Newark in 1902 by Charles W.
Engelhard Sr. after he bought the Charles Croselmire Co. and began
acquiring specialty metals firms. His son, Charles W. Engelhard
Jr., greatly expanded its operations.
   The wealthy Engelhard Jr., known as the ``platinum king,'' also
was a friend of James Bond creator Ian Fleming, and supposedly
served as an inspiration for the character of the villain
Goldfinger.
   Engelhard was a portly figure who often carried an ebony cane,
and would joke with friends about his identification with the spy
story villain, according to a 1971 obituary.
   Goldfinger might not recognize Engelhard Corp. based on its
remaining businesses.
   For sale are its gold and silver refining and fabrication
businesses; metal joining operations; electronic chemicals section,
which provides precious metals to electronic circuitry makers;
crystals business, which supplies makers of radiation detectors;
and part of its jewelry products business.
   Businesses it will keep include its platinum group, which makes
components of catalytic convertors for cars; its profitable
precious metal trading operation; its chemical and petroleum
catalysts group; and its additives and pigment business.

   Actor Willem Dafoe agrees his portrayal of
Jesus in Martin Scorsese's new film ``The Last Temptation'' is not
typical biblical movie fare.
   ``This is a deeply religious movie for Marty,'' said Dafoe.
``It's not a debunking; it's not a riff. It's a way to articulate
his deep feelings.
   ``Sure, part of the idea was to humanize Christ. It's short on
heavenly angels. But, in the end, it's triumphant in the way people
who subscribe to the Jesus story want it to be,'' Dafoe said in an
interview published Thursday in the Los Angeles Times.
   The film, which opens nationwide Friday, has drawn denunciations
from conservative Christian groups. Based on a novel by Nikos
Kazantzakis, the movie includes such scenes as Jesus dreaming of
making love to Mary Magdalene.

   Amy Carter, daughter of former President
Jimmy Carter, has been accepted for enrollment this fall at Memphis
College of Art, the school's president said.
   ``She picked a school and ... we lie in her area of interests,''
President John Slorp said in Thursday's editions of The (Memphis)
Commercial Appeal. The paper said she is interested in art, ballet,
movies, the violin and reading. School officials weren't sure what
she would study.
   Miss Carter, 21, has been involved in protests against the CIA,
apartheid and world hunger. She was arrested at the South African
Embassy in Washington in 1985.
   A former Brown University student, Miss Carter has denied
reports that she was expelled or dismissed from that school for
academic or other reasons. ``They told me to take a semester off. I
wasn't expelled. I don't have to reapply ... to get back in,'' she
said in December.

   Rock musician Gene Simmons of the heavy metal
band Kiss says he is too busy getting the group ready for the road
to play a villain in the new James Bond movie ``License Revoked.''
   Simmons, a founding member of the glitter-rock band once known
for its alter-ego makeup, begged out of a job offer from film
producer Cubby Broccoli. The bass player cited concert commitments
to the European version of the International Monsters of Rock Tour,
said publicist David Brokaw.
   The Bond film, featuring Timothy Dalton in his second appearance
as the elusive agent 007, begins shooting in Mexico in September,
Brokaw said.
   Simmons enthralled Kiss fans worldwide in the 1970s with onstage
antics that included breathing fire and spitting fake blood. For
years band members refused to show their faces in public or be
photographed without their trademark black-and-white makeup.
   Still known for its raunchy musical style and irreverent lyrics,
Kiss will play its first club date in 15 years in New York on
Friday, Brokaw said.

   For the third straight
summer the prince and princess of Wales have taken their young sons
to visit ``the Spains'' _ as they call the Spanish royal family.
   Prince Charles, Diana, and sons William, 6, and Harry, 4,
arrived Thursday on a Royal Air Force jet, said an airport official
who did not want to be identified.
   The British royalty were greeted at the airport by Crown Prince
Felipe, heir to the Spanish throne, who drove them to meet King
Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia at their Marivent Palace summer
residence on this Mediterranean island, the official said.
   Spanish press reports said the holiday was originally to last 10
days but may be shortened so Charles and Diana can attend the
christening of their yet-unnamed niece born Aug. 8 to the duke and
duchess of York.
   Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II, is scheduled in October to
become the first British head of state to visit Spain. Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher plans a September visit.

<HEAD>Kopell Back with KAOS in `Get Smart' Movie</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nine years of white socks and a charming
bunkside manner as the cruise boat doctor on ``The Love Boat,''
Bernie Kopell is up to no good in the ABC movie ``Get Smart, Again!''
   Kopell is back as Conrad Siegfried, still with KAOS, still
plugging evil and terror, still trying to take over the world, still
being thwarted by Agent 86 from CONTROL.
   Agent 86 was better known as Maxwell Smart, Siegfried's American
nemesis. The truth is they were both a couple of dim bulbs, but
Smart, aided by his brainy and beautiful colleague, Agent 99, always
managed to muddle through.
   Nearly the entire original cast from the ``Get Smart'' series,
which ran from 1965 to '70, first on NBC and then on CBS, is back
for the two-hour movie on Sunday _ Don Adams as Maxwell Smart,
Barbara Feldon as Agent 99, Dick Gautier as Hymie, Dave Ketchum as
Agent 13, Robert Karvelas as Larrabee, and King Moody as Shtarker.
Kenneth Mars takes over as chief of CONTROL in place of Edward
Platt, who died in 1974.
   In ``Get Smart, Again!'' KAOS kidnaps a scientist to obtain his
secret formula for creating a weather machine. Siegfried and his
henchman Shtarker demand a ransom of $250 billion.
   Neither KAOS nor CONTROL stood for anything, the way U.N.C.L.E.,
for instance, stood for United Network Command for Law and
Enforcement on ``The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' Their nemesis was THRUSH.
   KAOS ought to stand for Kopell's Acts of (Comic) Subversion.
   ``Siegfried is more fun than anything I've done in my life,''
said Kopell. ``I could let loose. Is there a comedy of anger?
Siegfried always appears to be angry. In the movie, KAOS has been
taken over by a corporate raider, which only adds to Siegfried's
anger and frustration.''
   ``Get Smart'' was a spoof of James Bond and it gave no quarter as
it milked its laughs from sendups of secret agents, disguises,
codes, technological gadgets and monolithic intelligence
organizations. The series was created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry.
   ``It was biting, incisive and stepped on a few toes,'' said
Kopell. ``We got a couple of good shots at the government. It didn't
pussyfoot around the way some other shows did. It took a few swipes
at some sacred cows.''
   Kopell has been a regular or a recurring character on eight
series. At the same time he was on ``Get Smart,'' he was on ``That
Girl,'' starring Marlo Thomas.
   ``I never had a contract for either show,'' he said. ``I got to
know the assistant directors over at `That Girl,' and I'd call over
and say, `Look, I'm not working Tuesday and Wednesday.' And they'd
set up all my scenes for those days. Marlo Thomas did `That Girl,'
and she was the best boss I ever had. She was very generous, very
supportive.''
   He was also on ``The Steve Allen Show,'' ``The Danny Kaye Show,''
``The Doris Day Show,'' ``Bewitched,'' ``The Love Boat'' and ``When
Things Were Rotten.'' The latter, in which he played Alan-a-Dale in
a Robin Hood spoof, was also created by Mel Brooks. Things were
really rotten because it lasted only a few weeks.
   Kopell also supplied some of the voices for the Saturday morning
series ``Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp,'' a cartoon spoof of James
Bond. The good chimps belonged to A.P.E. and the bad chimps, led by
the Baron (Kopell), belonged to C.H.U.M.P.
   His longest-running series and the only time he was ever cast in
a romantic role was ``The Love Boat.'' He played the ship's doctor,
Adam Bricker.
   ``I was always a character actor,'' he said. ``I couldn't believe
it when I got the role. It was wonderful. I'm grateful, but I never
knew how it happened. I was cast when Dick Van Patten pulled out
after doing the pilots to do ``Eight Is Enough.'''
   Kopell credits producer Leonard Stern with casting him as
Siegfried in ``Get Smart.''
   ``There was no reason why a 33-year-old kid would get the part,''
he said. ``But Leonard had seen me playing an immigrant in `The 49th
Dozen' at the Players Ring. He sent me a sweet letter and said we'd
work together sometime. Two years later he called me to play
Siegfried. He asked me if I could do the accent. I lied and said of
course I could.
   ``Makeup made me look very old. They put a fencing scar on my
left cheek. I was a baby-faced kid. I remember being unhappy
whenever the makeup came off. I was me again.''

'PROTECT CHILDREN ACT' AIMS TO BAN CIGARETTE DEALS IN FILM

<P>
Legislation has been introduced in Congress to ban youth-oriented cigarette 
advertising, including payments to film makers to feature specific cigarette 
brands in their movies. 
</P>
<P>
Paid "product placement" deals, calling for brand-name merchandise to be shown 
in films, are a legal and potentially large source of revenue for movie 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
But paying to have cigarettes placed in movies is "a subtle technique by the 
merchants of addiction to get young people to smoke," Rep. Tom Luken (D-Ohio) 
said in introducing the bill last week. The proposed legislation is being 
co-sponsored by Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and Bob Whittaker (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
Luken also said paid 
</P>
<P>
placement of cigarettes in films "has the effect of circumventing the federal 
ban on cigarette advertising on television" when movies appear on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Tobacco companies say they shy away from product placement deals precisely to 
avoid charges like the one Luken made. 
</P>
<P>
But in filing the bill last week, Luken, who chairs the House transportation 
and hazardous materials subcommittee, said a preliminary inquiry has turned up 
three instances in which cigarette makers did pay to feature their brands in 
recent films. 
</P>
<P>
In response to questions from Luken, Liggett Group Inc. said in a letter that 
it paid $30,000 in 1983 to have its Eve cigarette brand appear in the movie 
"Supergirl" -- although the company's policy since has been to "not pay for 
product to be used in films." 
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris Cos., the No. 1 U.S. tobacco company and maker of the Marlboro 
brand that is the world's largest seller, disclosed two cases in which payments 
were made to feature cigarettes in foreign-made films destined for United 
States and foreign audiences. In a Feb. 24 letter, the company said these were 
the only cases it had discovered "based upon our review thus far." 
</P>
<P>
In the first case, more than $40,000 was paid in 1979 for Marlboro to appear in 
"Superman II." And the company's Tokyo-based advertising agency agreed last 
fall to pay $350,000 to showcase Lark cigarettes in "License Revoked," a new 
James Bond film shot primarily in Mexico. Lark is actually a Liggett brand, but 
Philip Morris owns the rights to the brand overseas, including in Japan, where 
the James Bond character is especially popular. 
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Philip Morris said, it has been providing free cigarettes 
or advertising signs for an average of 17 films per year, but without paying 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, a Philip Morris spokesman told The Times that the company 
had not paid to place its cigarettes in movies "for at least 10 years," but 
said he was not sure this applied to all foreign subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the No. 2 cigarette maker, told Luken it does not 
pay film makers to feature its brands, a policy "we believe . . . has been 
adhered to" at least since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Devaney, director of product placement at Rogers &amp; Cowan Inc., a 
public relations firm, said Reynolds "is the one account that I don't pursue 
any placements for." He said that when film makers request cigarettes for 
movies rated "R" or "PG-13," "I give them product and that's it. . . . If they 
come to me and they want my brand, I'm certainly going to say OK." 
</P>
<P>
The issue is a sensitive one for the cigarette makers, who were helped in 
decades past by a flood of endorsements from glamorous stars. The companies say 
they do not target adolescents through movies or other media, and that they 
advertise only to lure smokers of other brands -- not to induce non-smokers to 
start. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have long accused the companies of using popular entertainment to 
market their brands to youth. With nearly all new smokers taking up the habit 
while still in their teens, critics say the cigarette makers must target youth 
to replace the 2 million smokers who annually quit or die. 
</P>
<P>
An aide said Luken will press the cigarette companies for more specifics on 
their product placement policies. For example, some firms that said they 
currently do not pay to get their brands in movies did not provide information 
back to 1979, as Luken requested. 
</P>
<P>
Legislation to ban all forms of cigarette advertising and promotion went 
nowhere in the last session of Congress. The Luken bill, dubbed "The Protect 
Our Children From Cigarettes Act of 1989," takes a less sweeping approach. It 
would permit text-only advertising on billboards and in print media, with no 
pictures other than the cigarette pack. However, cigarette billboards would be 
banned from sports arenas, vending machine sales would be barred in places 
accessible to adolescents and payments to feature cigarettes in movies would be 
banned. 
</P>
<P>
Luken said he was not trying "to restrict in any way an artistic decision to 
have a smoking scene in a movie." But he said that decision "should not be 
influenced by the lure of large cash payments." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, declined 
comment, saying through a spokeswoman he was studying the bill.

<HEAD>Sir Richard Francis Burton: A 19th-Century James Bond</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORIAN BENKOIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He was an explorer, a thrillseeker, a womanizer,
insatiably curious, painfully opinionated and, maybe, a spy.
   Disguised, he was the first Westerner to visit Mecca, and he led
the first white man's expedition to Africa's Lake Tanganyika.
   ``Sir Richard Francis Burton was the James Bond of the 19th
century,'' says author Edward Rice.
   But unlike Agent 007, Burton really existed.
   Rice's new biography, ``Captain Sir Richard Francis Burton, The
Secret Agent Who Made the Pilgrimage to Mecca, Discovered the Kama
Sutra and brought the Arabian Nights to the West,'' is a surprise
best seller, making its way to non-fiction Top 10 lists.
   A British edition of the Rice biography is being prepared, and
Rice says he recently started negotiations for translations into
German, Spanish and Japanese.
   The book charts ``Ruffian Dick'' from his peripatetic childhood
in France, England and Italy, through his Arabian and African
adventures, until his restless final years in Trieste, Italy.
There, he translated the Arabian Nights and erotic works, such as
the Kama Sutra, which were hardly sitting-room fair in prim
Victorian England.
   Burton spoke at least 29 languages - often passing for a native
speaker when his life depended on it - mastered swordsmanship,
survived a spear through his jaw, wrote 43 books and over 100
articles and translated at least a dozen works from at least five
tongues.
   Stubbornly unwilling to bend to Victorian prohibitions or
political expediency, Burton detailed female circumcision and
homosexual brothels with the same zest as he did the ethnography of
Nile River peoples.
   A man of extremes, he gorged opium and other exotic drugs, and
spent much of a half-year trip to the United States drunk.
   And, writes Rice, Burton played a large, but much more secret,
role in the ``Great Game,'' the British machinations which led to
eventual conquests of much of the Middle East, India and Northern
Africa.
   Yet, dogged by sometimes jealous and vituperative political
enemies, Burton, dubbed ``The White Nigger,'' went largely
unrewarded and never surpassed the unremarkable rank of captain in
the British armed services. In his 40s, he was posted as consul to
backwater Sao Paolo, Brazil, and to Fernando Po, ``an isolated,
foresaken island in the Bight of Biafra on the African west
coast,'' writes Rices.
   Largely through the efforts of his devoted and well-connected
wife, Isabel, Burton finally escaped for a stint as consul of
beloved Damascus.
   But again unable to appease his powerful foes as skillfully as
he charmed his myriad friends, Burton was soon posted to the
near-exile of Trieste.
   A life as fascinating as Burton's, of course, has not escaped
previous notice. Those around him, including Isabel, wrote
sometimes emotionally charged articles and biographies after his
death at age 72, 100 years ago.
   But not until 1963 did Byron Farwell, in ``Burton, A Biography
of Sir Richard Francis Burton,'' take a comprehensive and more
objective look. (Farwell's work was reissued in 1988 and, for the
first time, published in the United States by Penguin.) At least
four other biographies followed before Rice's. Burton's character
also dominated the 1972 BBC miniseries ``The Search for the Nile.''
   Rudyard Kipling based at least two fictional characters on
Burton, says Rice. Philip Jose Farmer chose him as the hero of his
``Riverworld'' science fiction series, in which everyone who has
died past the age of five comes back to life. Burton, as if not
intriguing enough in fact, was fictionalized in William Harrison's
``Burton and Speke,'' the basis for this year's film, ``Mountains
of the Moon,'' which portrays Burton's endeavors and tragic
confrontrations with rival explorer John Hanning Speke.
   That Hollywood movie is one reason Rice's was the first Burton
book to reach best-seller lists.
   ``Clearly, publicity and promotion can turn the tide for a book,
and a movie tie-in always helps,'' says Gayle Feldman, an editor at
Publishers Weekly.
   Publisher Charles Scribner's Sons pushed the book, sending Rice
on book tours and national TV shows, and the biography got good
reviews throughout the media.
   Rice's book is, perhaps, the most comprehensive of the Burton
biographies. It quotes liberally from Burton's writings and puts a
lot of the explorer's life in the context of the times, drawing
upon Rice's considerable knowledge of Eastern religions and
cultures.
   Throughout, Rice's admiration of Burton is clear, and he makes
some controversial assertions. That Burton was a spy has not been
proven, though Rice ties scant evidence into a somewhat convincing
whole.
   Rice, who has written a dozen other books, also seems convinced
that Burton had a mysterious Persian lover whom he wooed, lost and
pined for the rest of his life.
   In perhaps his most contentious argument, Rice says Burton was a
devoted Moslem, maybe even a Sufi mystic. Scholars today heatedly
debate Burton's religious leanings, as did those who lived with and
near him.
   After Burton's death, his wife, a devout Catholic, burned the
personal diaries which may have solved the arguments.

<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Samurai warlord Kagetora (Takaaki Enoki) ends up compromising
himself.  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  JAPAN; WAR; HISTORY; MOVIE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WITH its battling samurai, epic grandeur and twists of betrayal and rebellion,
"Heaven &amp; Earth" has the makings of a great Akira Kurosawa film.;   
Unfortunately it was directed by Haruki Kadokawa.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Weekend  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SAMURAI CAN'T SAVE BLOODLESS DIRECTING  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     That's unsurprising, perhaps. Kurosawa is a prophet without honor in his
own country, a man who has to beg abroad for money. Kadokawa is the head of
his own publishing company, the founder of his own studio and an investor in
such expensive Broadway flops as "Shogun: The Musical." Kurosawa wouldn't get
the backing for a $42 million epic. Kadokawa could.;    He just can't direct.;
   "Heaven &amp; Earth" is set in 16th-century feudal Japan, an age of rebellious
samurai and civil war. Brother kills brother. Nobles seize chunks of territory
like hungry wolves. And the rifle -- a pitiless weapon that kills an enemy
whose face you've never seen -- seems to hint that the age of chivalry is
over.;    Brutal battling;  It's a brutal time that produces two great
warriors, the mystic Kagetora and the pragmatic Takeda. But like Shakespeare's
great flawed kings, Kagetora at first seems unfit for victory. His compassion
hobbles him, and only by becoming more brutal than his enemy can he hope to
defeat him. To win his war, he has to lose himself.;    There's great drama
here, and Kadokawa misses it. Brief, truncated scenes are bridged by long,
Japanese-tourist-board vistas of cherry blossoms and snowy peaks. (Which is
ironic, because most of the exteriors were filmed in Alberta, Canada.) What
should be wrenching moments of death and treachery often occur offscreen,
while hack-of-all-trades Stuart Whitman provides the helpful narration that
"Time passed.";    This isn't completely Kadokawa's fault; over an hour was
cut from the movie for its American release. But what remains isn't very
impressive. He seems incapable of handling his actors, who lapse into stylized
Kabuki mannerisms. Takaaki Enoki, who plays Kagetora, is supposed to be a
thoughtful, spiritual man. We know this because he stares into space a lot and
seems unable to answer questions. Masahiko Tsugawa's Takeda is an old villain
set in his ways. We know this because he scowls all the time. These are
cutouts, not characters.;    It leaves "Heaven &amp; Earth" little to fall back
on, except its battle scenes, and even these disappoint. Kadokawa pulls his
camera back into flat, impersonal medium shots, and the warfare becomes mere
intersecting lines, pretty forces in red and black riding at each other in
full gallop. Twenty-five years ago, with perhaps a hundredth of the budget,
Orson Welles turned the battles of "Chimes at Midnight" into bloody images of
futile violence. Kadokawa turns his civil war into plane geometry.;    Flat
and passionless;  There are a few nice images -- a thicket of lances, soldiers
emerging suddenly from a great concealing fog -- but the spectacle remains as
passionless as the final battle in a James Bond film. A bad, Roger Moore James
Bond film.;    Kadokawa isn't shy. He's said that he identifies with his
mystic hero. His studio biography even cheerfully sets forward his
accomplishments. Shinto priest. Writer of haiku. "Noted adventurer." "Widely
celebrated leader of his generation." Next year, going Columbus one better, he
plans to captain a copy of the Santa Maria from Spain to Japan. He's not shy.
He'd even make a great subject for a movie.;    He just can't seem to make a
great movie.;     Heaven &amp; Earth; (star)(star); Rated: PG-13 (for violence);
Cast: Takaaki Enoki, Masahiko Tsugawa, Naomi Zaizen, Atsuko Asano; Director:

Disney's beloved 1964 live-action/animation fantasy Mary Poppins returns on 
KNBC on Sunday at 7 p.m. Julie Andrews, of course, has the title role as the 
"practically perfect" nanny hired by the Banks family of Edwardian London. 
</P>
<P>
The Living Daylights (KABC, Sunday at 8:30 p.m.) introduced in 1987 a new James 
Bond, Timothy Dalton, who is splendid-provided you can put Sean Connery out of 
your mind-but after a quarter of a century of 007, it's pretty much the same as 
before, except for less casual sex in this AIDS era. 
</P>
<P>
Top Secret! (KCOP, Wednesday at 8 p.m.) tries to send up-and update-the World 
War II spy adventure, a rather antiquated target. There's a nonstop barrage of 
gags, many inspired and hilarious in themselves but scattershot in effect. 
Dynamic Val Kilmer stars as an American rock 'n' roller who's a last-minute 
substitute for Leonard Bernstein at an East German cultural festival-and who 
winds up trying to help an imprisoned scientist escape to the West, along with 
his pretty daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Tarzan, the Ape Man (KTLA, Thursday at 8 p.m.), the delirious 1981 Bo and John 
Derek version,should've been called "Me, Jane." Silly, tedious and soft-pornish 
-- but surely tamed for TV -- Bo's virginal Jane invades West Africa alone in 
search of her great white hunter father (Richard Harris) and winds up saved 
from a lion by an equally virginal Ape Man (Miles O'Keeffe). 
</P>
<P>
In Endangered Species (KTLA, Friday at 8 p.m.), Alan Rudolph's taut 1982 
political thriller, the cattle near a small Colorado town begin to be 
decimated, their carcasses peculiarly mutilated while their internal organs 
seem to have evaporated. The plot proves to be timely and chilling, but its 
unraveling is less than inspired. 
</P>
<P>
Two vintage adventures also air Friday: Robert Aldrich's 1954 Western Vera Cruz 
(KTTV, Friday at 8 p.m.), with Gary Cooper and Burt Lancaster, and Michael 
Curtiz's classic 1938 The Adventures of Robin Hood (KCOP, Friday at 8 p.m.), 
with Errol Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
With the 1982 I Ought to Be in Pictures (KTLA, Saturday at 6 p.m.), Neil Simon 
wrote two of his most believable characters-a burnt-out screenwriter and his 
girlfriend, a studio hairdresser-and under Herbert Ross' direction, Walter 
Matthau and Ann-Margret are wonderful. Unfortunately, Matthau's obnoxious 
teen-age daughter (Dinah Manoff) turns up to become the film's center of 
attention. 
</P>

Photo, The late John Cassavetes' 1980 comedy "Gloria" (KCOP, at 8 p.m.) was his

retired gun moll on the run with both a priceless underworld ledger -- and an 
unwanted but beguiling 6-year-old (John Adames.).

   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said it formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and, eventually, to U.S. theaters, too. 

   The operator of cable-television networks said the new Turner Pictures unit will produce movies that will premiere on Turner Broadcasting's Turner Network Television channel, or TNT, and then will be released internationally in movie theaters. 

   The unit's first two offerings are slated to be "The Secret Life of Ian Fleming," a dramatization about the former British spy who wrote the James Bond novels, and "Treasure Island," produced by Charlton Heston, who also stars in the movie. 

   Ted Turner, Turner Broadcasting's chairman, was named chairman of Turner Pictures, and Gerry Hogan, president of Turner Entertainment Networks, was named president of the unit. 

   In an interview, Mr. Hogan said the subsidiary's primary mission will be to make movies for TNT and to distribute them internationally. 
But he said Turner Broadcasting already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the U.S. 

   "When that occurs, and when the time is right, we'll release the films in the U.S.," he said, adding that Turner Pictures may develop such movies next year for domestic release in 1991. 

   Turner has made several movies, docudramas and documentaries for its networks in recent years, but the company has never acted as a full-fledged movie studio and released its own pictures to theaters. 

   Mr. Hogan said "The Secret Life of Ian Fleming" and "Treasure Island" cost more than $6 million each to make, which is only about one-third the cost of most movies made for theatrical release. 

   The Turner move is in line with a cable-TV trend toward more original programming -- and toward finding more ways to amortize the high cost of producing films. 
In July, Viacom Inc. formed Viacom Pictures to produce 12 low-budget movies a year that will premiere on Showtime network and be distributed later in various markets, including foreign theaters.

   Longtime James Bond actor Roger Moore says he's
giving up the lead role in a new Andrew Lloyd Webber musical because
he can't sing well enough.
   ``I now do not think that the musical stage is for me,'' Moore
said Monday.
   The actor who played secret agent 007 in six Bond films had been
rehearsing for six weeks. The musical, ``Aspects of Love,'' is
scheduled to open in a month and is already sold out until Christmas.
   Moore said he quit after ``much soul-searching,'' and left enough
time for a ``more musically suitable replacement to be found.''
   ``I think perhaps I underestimated the vocal demands of the role
because I so much wanted Roger to play it,'' said Lloyd Webber, the
composer of ``Cats'' and ``Phantom of the Opera.''
   Moore, 61, was to have headed a 20-member cast as George
Dillingham, a romantic aristocrat, in the love story about an
English boy and a penniless French actress. Lloyd Webber had invited
Moore to take the role after hearing him sing at a private party.

   Actress Candice Bergen says that before her
daughter's birth, she thought she would have a baby only if it
``were more like a chimpanzee.''
   ``But then suddenly Chloe was born. ... I was so overwhelmed and
ecstatic to have this baby,'' the 41-year-old actress said in an
interview in April's Redbook.
   ``I never used to like babies. I had absolutely no confidence
that I had any maternal instincts whatsoever. I'd always think,
`Well, if a baby were more like a chimpanzee, I'd have one,''' said
Bergen, who is married to French filmmaker Louis Malle.
   Bergen, who lived in Los Angeles last fall while playing a TV
newswoman in the CBS series ``Murphy Brown,'' said she will try to
distance her 3-year-old daughter from the Beverly Hills lifestyle.
   ``I find the narcissism and self-involvement ... really
appalling. People's preoccupation with their looks and their clothes
at a time when there's so much suffering in the country _ I just
find it grotesque,'' she said.

   Producers of NBC-TV's ``In the Heat of the Night''
said Joe Don Baker will be an interim guest star on the series while
Carroll O'Connor recovers from cardiac bypass surgery.
   O'Connor was moved out of intensive care at Emory University
Hospital on Monday, two days after his surgery, and is expected to
remain hospitalized another week or so, hospital spokeswoman Eve
Patterson said.
   ``He's making excellent progress,'' Patterson said.
   O'Connor, perhaps best known as the blue-collar bigot Archie
Bunker in the situation comedy ``All in the Family,'' will miss this
season's four remaining episodes of ``In the Heat of the Night.''
   The show's producers, MGM@UA Television, announced that Baker
will portray a neighboring sheriff who fills in while Police Chief
Bill Gillespie _ O'Connor's character _ represents his state at a
seminar on terrorism.

   Former White House press secretary James S.
Brady says he's ready to become an advocate for the disabled now
that he's overcome a head wound suffered in the 1981 assassination
attempt on then-President Reagan.
   Brady, 48, who retired from the White House recently, said Monday
he accepted an unpaid position as vice chairman of the National
Organization on Disability, a private, non-profit group.
   ``Now that I'm one of the 37 million people with disabilities, I
know what it's like: the daily frustration and problems,'' he said
at a news conference.
   ``My family and I have been fortunate over the past eight years
to have the support of friends, family and people from all across
the country. That support system has been invaluable to me in my
recovery.
   ``Now, I want to help provide a support system for others.''
   President Bush and Reagan sent congratulatory messages to Brady.
   ``Your comeback has made us all proud,'' Bush wrote in a letter.

   Actress Shirley Maclaine says she's content to
play plump, ill-tempered characters, but she hasn't given up on
glamour entirely.
   Maclaine, 55, said she had a good time gaining 25 pounds to play
a tyrannical piano teacher in last year's critically acclaimed
``Madame Sousatzka.''
   ``I needed to feel my thighs clang together. I had to get Shirley
out of the way and let this character play herself,'' she said in
April's Ladies' Home Journal.
   Her newest role, in the soon-to-be-released film version of the
play ``Steel Magnolias,'' is Ouiser Boudreaux: ``an old, ugly,
sarcastic witch who's been in a bad mood for 40 years.''
   ``I'm going to play characters who are misfits or mildly
eccentric, with very sweeping personalities, maybe 60 or 65 years
old, who may or may not have any sexual relationships, who are
confronting something important about themselves.''
   But one day, the Oscar-winning actress said, ``I may also decide
I want to be glamorous again.''

   Actress Esther Williams says she's limiting her
comeback hopes to swimsuit designing and hasn't acted in decades
because she didn't want to ``lower my standards.''
   Miss Williams wowed moviegoers in the 1940s and 1950s with lavish
swimming and underwater ballet sequences in 26 MGM movies including
the ``Million Dollar Mermaid,'' ``Dangerous When Wet'' and ``Bathing
Beauty.''
   ``Everything changed,'' she said in a telephone interview from
her Beverly Hills, Calif., home. ``I was in that moment of
transition between when the big studios lost all the theaters and TV
was getting prominent and important.''
   Recently, she considered a role in a two-hour television movie,
but turned down the four day, $25,000-a-day job after reading the
``exploitive'' script.
   ``Boy was I glad when I saw it,'' she said. ``I don't want to
lower my standards. I would have hated that hundred thousand
dollars.''
   On Monday, Miss Williams, 65, showed off her first line of
swimsuits, a collection of 124 designs ranging from $30 to $60.

<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Kathleen Turner has banished all 'bimbos' from her detective
movie, 'Fully Loaded.'  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  MOVIE; CELEBRITY; WOMAN  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  IN HOLLYWOOD movies, the beautiful blond in the detective's office is
generally not the detective. More likely, she's there to beg him to take that
case that just doesn't smell right. Kathleen Turner intends to change all
that.;    Wrapped in a thin housecoat against a bitterly cold night -- for
Southern California, anyway -- she's awaiting her next scene as the star of
"Fully Loaded," based on the novels of the Chicago-based writer Sara Paretsky
about a female detective named V.I. Warshawski (her friends call her Vic).  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Living  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  SHE'S SHOOTING TO BE THE NEXT JAMES BOND
TURNER TWISTS THE DETECTIVE ROLE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Film  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Turner has reasons for wanting the name Warshawski to become as well known
to moviegoers as that of James Bond, even if it doesn't roll as trippingly off
the tongue.;    After a week of location shooting in Chicago, the production
has relocated to Los Angeles' port of San Pedro; and as chilly winds whip
across the abandoned dock, the crew members have to keep reminding themselves
how cold it was in Chicago.;    Not only is Turner skimpily dressed as she
awaits her next scene, her hair is dripping wet. She's supposed to have fallen
off the dock, only to find upon making her way back to dry land that her
boyfriend, Murray (Jay O. Sanders), has been injured in an explosion.;   
Turner says she's been reading female detective fiction for a long time,
looking for just this kind of role. Of all the female detectives, Turner says,
Warshawski "is the most interesting, the one with the best moral values. She's
asked, 'What does it cost to hire you?' and she says, 'A just cause.' ";   
That V.I. Warshawski is an admirable, independent, smart, hip, morally
upright, strong yet vulnerable character is rewarding enough; it's also the
lead role in a movie that, if successful, will almost certainly generate
sequels.;    Trying to hew to the spirit of Warshawski, Turner has laid down
some ground rules for the picture, in which the detective teams up with a
plucky 13-year-old girl in an effort to find out who killed the child's
hockey-player father.;    "We have a little slogan in this film -- 'no
bimbos.' I mean, even in the scene where we had to put a girl in bed with
Murray, she was wearing glasses and reading Psychology Today. She was not
reading People.";    Enforcing this rule required a good deal of vigilance,
according to Turner.;    "The opening scene in the movie is with this real
twit, who wants to hire V.I. to investigate his rival, and he says, very
suggestively, 'Why don't you give me a taste of what you do?' and they had
written in some stuff where I kind of go along with this at first. And I said,
no, no, no, no. I will not say anything that will contribute to this jerk's
illusions. I mean, she turns around and puts him in his place in the end, but
as far as I'm concerned, even to go along with it for a little while is
unacceptable.;    "We get in some good male bashes in this film," Turner says
gleefully. "There's one scene where I get this guy to give me information he
really should not be giving. And Angela Goethals, who plays a little girl I
become friends with, says, 'Wow, are men so easy?' And I say, 'Never
underestimate a man's ability to underestimate a woman's.' Which I think
should be our slogan for life."  </TEXT>
