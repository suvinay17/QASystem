   TOKYO -- A Japanese liquor dealer has begun to import
low-priced U.S.-made sake but claims that Japanese brewers
are trying to put a cork in his efforts.
   Sake is the traditional Japanese rice wine, but that
doesn't mean it has to be made in Japan, says Yukio Higuchi,
president of a Tokyo discount liquor store chain called
Kawachiya Shuhan Co. U.S. sake, brewed in California with
local rice, is 30% cheaper than the Japanese equivalents,
even after adding shipping costs and import duties, he says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Nobody else thought of doing this," says Mr. Higuchi,
boasting that his store was the first to display four brands
of American sake last month. Although rice imports are
essentially banned, processed rice products such as crackers
and sake are allowed on a limited basis. Mr. Higuchi sells
the American sake for 1,350 yen ($10.45) for a 1.5 liter
bottle. Mr. Higuchi sells a 1.8 liter bottle of a comparable
Japanese sake for about 2,000 yen.
   There is one problem, however, that may keep many bargain
hunters from the foreign booze. Mr. Higuchi says that all
five U.S. brewers, which are affiliates of Japanese sake
makers and wholesalers, have refused to supply his stores --
or any Japanese liquor store -- with the U.S.-made sake. The
discounter says he finally secured supplies of all five
brands by asking distributors around the U.S. to spare him a
few cartons here and there.
   Mr. Higuchi suspects liquor makers, fearing that the
cheaper sake would threaten the high prices of Japanese sake,
have joined forces against him. "If they all acted according
to orders from the Japanese headquarters, and if they
consulted each other about it," that could be against the
U.S. antitrust laws, says Mr. Higuchi. After seeking advice
from lawyers, he plans to raise the issue soon with U.S.
government officials.
   Meanwhile, Japan's price-conscious drinkers have already
snapped up 18,000 bottles of the U.S.-made sake, says Mr.
Higuchi. Bars are considering placing orders, and Mr. Higuchi
plans to increase imports 50,000 bottles a month. "I can have
100 times more than this, and there still wouldn't be
enough," boasts Mr. Higuchi, who has made his fortune by
selling liquor at rock-bottom prices.
   Mr. Higuchi's complaints follow a long list of accusations
of collusive behavior among Japanese companies to keep out
competition. Beer companies have long been accused of
pressuring liquor stores to sell at exactly the same prices.
Although the breweries denied that charge, Japan's Fair Trade
Commission two years ago ordered four major breweries to put
out an ad saying that their beer prices weren't fixed.
   The Japanese sake brewers deny colluding against Mr.
Higuchi, but insist that there is no reason to ship their
U.S.-made products back to Japan. "The products made in
America are for the American market," says an official for
the international division of Ozeki Corp., a sake brewer. "We
don't make enough over there to bring over to Japan."
   Besides, says Kiyoshi Ishikawa, president of Takara Sake
USA Inc., Mr. Higuchi never contacted the company directly.
Even if he had, the company, which is a subsidiary of Takara
Shuzo Co., Kyoto, says it has no plans to import its
U.S.-made liquor because the American sake, which he says is
"richer," has been tailored to American tastes.
   The brewers certainly have reason to be hesitant about
exporting their U.S. products. Too much of the cheap foreign
sake may upset Japanese rice farmers, who have been selling
rice for six times the price of Californian rice. More than a
decade ago, when Ozeki imported its U.S.-made sake as part of
a promotional campaign, some Japanese rice farmers protested,
and Ozeki didn't repeat the campaign. No farmers are
outwardly opposing Mr. Higuchi now, but Japan's Central Union
of Agricultural Cooperatives says that many are watching to
see if much more of the sake pours into the market.
   As for Japanese sake drinkers, some say that the American
versions probably won't match the Japanese originals, but
they're eager to give it a shot anyway. "I can't imagine it
would be better, but I'm curious to try it," says 33-year-old
Eiji Matsusaka, a Tokyo photographer. Besides, he says, "for
people my age, anything that's made in America has a kind of
a cachet."

<TEXT>
   A major Japanese rice wine brewer plans to set up a
factory in Colorado that will use ``pure Rocky Mountain water'' to
make traditional Japanese sake, the company said Thursday.
   Tatsuuma-Honke Brewing Co., a sake brewer based in western
Japan, will build its $7 million factory in Golden, Colo., on land
bought from Adolph Coors Co., a major U.S. brewer, said Tetsuya
Ogura, Tatsuuma-Honke spokesman.
   Dry air, cool weather and abundant, pure water from the Rocky
Mountains, as well as cheap rice, are factors that led the company
to set up a brewery in Colorado, Ogura said.
   Constrution of the factory is to start next April. It is
expected to produce 200,000 bottles of rice wine a year beginning
in March 1991, with output increasing to 500,000 bottles in the
third year of production.

<HEAD>Colorado Developing Favorable Image In Japan, Officials Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Japanese company's decision to build a
sake plant near here is a sign that Colorado is becoming well known
in Japan, a state economic development official says.
   ``I think there's a growing awareness of Colorado in the minds
of the Japanese citizens,'' said Susan Blansett, who is a business
development representative for the state's Office of Economic
Development.
   ``Colorado is gaining a favorable image. They're beginning to
equate it with the mountains, the clean water and environment in
general,'' she said.
   The Tatsuuma-Honke Brewing Co. Ltd., which brews a sake called
Hakushika, is purchasing an eight-acre parcel for the brewery in
the Coors Technology Center. It plans to break ground on a $7
million, 50,000-square-foot plant in April. When in operation, the
plant will employ about 50 people, including 30 from Colorado.
   The company began looking at Colorado sites about a year ago,
and signed the deal in September, said officials at Adolph Coors
Co., which is selling the land to Tatsuuma.
   Tatsuuma will compete with four other Japanese sake brewers for
the U.S. market, the officials say. Most of the companies are
building plants in California.
   Tatsuuma officials chose Colorado because they thought a plant
here would preserve a niche, Coors officials said.
   ``From the beginning, they really wanted to differentiate
themselves from their competitors,'' said Sandra Woods, Coors' vice
president for corporate real estate. ``The quality of water was the
most important thing to them.''
   Tatsuuma officials wanted ``the quality first, and a good
relationship with the community,'' added Alec Garbini, Coors'
director of corporate property development.
   Economic development officials believe Colorado eventually may
emerge as a bigger lure for Japanese tourism and investment than
the Canadian Rockies.
   Japanese companies already have purchased the Breckenridge and
Steamboat Springs ski resorts.

<HL> A Real Gas of a Gene Could Put the Bite On Any Bad Apples --- Epitope Seeks to Develop Method for Controlling Ripening Pace of Produce </HL>
<AUTHOR> Ken Wells (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

<TEXT>
   Conventional wisdom says one rotten apple spoils the bunch.
Epitope Inc. has a plan to keep that apple from going bad in the first place.

   The small Beaverton, Ore., biotechnology concern said it entered a year-long research agreement with Sakata Seed Corp. of Japan to determine whether it can control the ripening of vegetables, fruits and flowers using genetic engineering techniques.
The ability to do so would obviously have benefits to growers and consumers alike, by reducing post-harvest spoilage and perhaps even widening the window of availability of certain seasonal agricultural products.

   "Anytime you can control ripening and bring products to the marketplace when you want, you've hit it big," says Richard A. Bock, senior vice president of Sutro &amp; Co.'s bioscience group in Los Angeles.
"You're talking about the potential ability to bring strawberries to market in January, or tomatoes to the market two weeks before they become seasonal."

   Epitope is pinning its hopes on a gene, isolated by the company's director of research, A.J. Fero, that appears to control a hormone that produces ethylene, a gas that plays a predominant role in the ripening process.
Banana growers, for example, have long applied ethylene manually to bananas to hasten their ripening.

   But the Epitope research aims at using gene-transfer and tissue-culture techniques to create new vegetable hybrids with genetic codes that essentially would have them ripen on a grower's timetable, says Mr. Fero.
Under its agreement with Sakata, Epitope will focus on the Japanese company's major products, broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower -- Sakata, for example, controls 80% of the world's broccoli seed market.

   "The early indications are that the technique works, but we are still in the experimental stages," cautioned Jerry Florence, an Epitope spokesman.
He declined to discuss financial terms of Epitope's agreement with Sakata, although the one-year research contract could be extended another two to three years, depending on results.

   Analysts say the Epitope-Sakata research, a decade ago the stuff of science fantasy, could be a major boon to the already burgeoning multibillion dollar agriculture-biotech market should it prove successful.
Currently, only a handful of other companies, including Calgene Inc., are involved in tangential research and the payoffs could be enormous.
Calgene, for example, is working on a genetic engineering technique that essentially keeps ripe tomatoes from turning quickly mushy by blocking the enzyme that causes softening.

ETHNIC EATING: ITA-CHO: SAKE TO QUAFF AND SEASONAL DISHES TO NIBBLE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Ita-Cho is a small Japanese restaurant tucked into a mini-mall that could draw
me back any time. The food is wonderful, the presentation beautiful and the
mood as soothing as the misty mural of mountains, pines and temples mounted on
the wall.
</P>
<P>
Given its location, you might expect Ita-Cho to be nothing more than a
neighborhood cafe dispensing homespun sukiyaki and tempura. Neither, however,
is on the menu. Nor is this a sushi bar, although it looks like one, with chefs
busily composing dishes behind a counter. According to the menu, Ita-Cho is a
koryori-ya, a restaurant that specializes in fresh, seasonal fish and vegetable
dishes. It is also a place where Japanese go to drink sake or beer and eat the
food that goes best with these beverages.
</P>
<P>
This could be grilled chicken wings (just the two-boned central joint, mounted
on a skewer), fish dumplings wrapped with noodle-like strands of fragile dough
and steamed, or jade-green rings of lettuce filled with chicken and arranged in
the lightest imaginable broth.
</P>
<P>
The dumplings -- wasu shumai -- are nothing like the open-ended, pork-stuffed
shumai of Cantonese dim sum. And the chicken in lettuce is an exemplary blend
of subtle flavor and lightness.
</P>
<P>
Some of the foods reflect preferences that are distinctively Japanese, like
strong tasting broiled whole smelt with crunchy roe, or fish liver, or thick,
pinkish squid rings that at first looked as inviting as a pile of rubber bands.
But the rings were remarkably tender and full of flavor.
</P>
<P>
Tori tatsuta age is Japanese-style fried chicken. The chicken nuggets are
coated with cornstarch, deep-fried and served with mustard-flavored mayonnaise
and a lemon wedge. Steamed Dungeness crab -- obligingly cut in half for a small
order -- comes with a sprightly, vinegar-based dipping sauce. And steamed white
fish, in a bowl of light broth with chrysanthemum leaves and Napa cabbage,
could qualify as spa food; it's brightened by a lemony soy-sauce dip.
</P>
<P>
Although most people recoil at the thought of fish bones, the spiny carcass is
an essential component of Ita-Cho's fried flounder with lemon sauce. Separated
from the fish and fried crisp, they are as crunchy and tender as chips.
</P>
<P>
Ita-Cho is open only at night and remains open into the early-morning hours, as
befits a beer and sake operation. There are several sakes to choose from.
</P>
<P>
Prices are surprisingly modest. Two could share an assortment of these dishes
for about $25. There is a nice dish of slim Oriental eggplant topped with
minced shrimp in a delicate sauce for $4.50. The wasu shumai are $4, the tori
tatsuta age is $3.50, and the Nagasaki-style braised pork and chicken wrapped
in lettuce leaves are each $4.50.
</P>
<P>
 Ita-Cho, 6775 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles. (213) 871-0236. Open Monday
through Saturday 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. Parking available. MasterCard and Visa
accepted.

<LEADPARA>  THE U.S. economy is picking up again but the unemployment rate has reached 7
percent. Is America now heading down the same path as Western Europe, where
strong economies have long gone hand in hand with high unemployment?;
Economists don't think so. They say that when economies come out of
recessions, hiring at first is slow. Yet Japan, with the world's second
mightiest economy, has so far defied this trend, surviving economic ups and
downs with an unemployment rate of around 2 percent.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BUT IN JAPAN, EVERYONE HAS A JOB -- OR TWO  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Franz Schurmann is an editor for Pacific News Service and teaches history and
sociology at the University of California, Berkeley.
Commentary  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     During the mid-1950s, when I p6,6p3,6p,4p9,3p6,1p6 was a research student
in Japan, a farmer explained to me why no one had ever been unemployed in his
family and in so doing offered a clue as to how the country has achieved this
remarkable balancing act.;    He lived in an old farmhouse near Kyoto in an
area that was a typically Japanese mix of agricultural, industrial and
commercial. One son worked in a factory, another in an office. Both had
families and lived close by.;    The farmer grew rice and vegetables on a few
small plots of land. Some of the rice he brewed into high-quality sake, which
he sold in a small store next to his house.;    Parents and sons together
formed a single household economy. When farm prices were high, the farmer grew
as much rice and vegetables for the local market as he could. If rice prices
were low, he diverted more rice into sake-making and still came out all right.
But if both farming and brewing were not profitable, he needed his sons to
help him.;    The sons had jobs in the general economy, but they also made use
of a peculiarly Japanese institution to bring in a little more income.
Japanese workers have a basic job, but most also moonlight. They call it
arubaito, from the German word for work. The extra income usually goes for the
children or the parents.;    If work is slack in either the general or the
household economy, its members can switch over to the other. In Japan you can
be out of work without losing your job. You can then bring in substitute
income by doing more moonlighting, or helping out in the household economy of
your three-generational family.;    When foreigners think of the Japanese
economy, they think of mighty firms on the cutting edge of technological
innovation. Yet those firms are a superstructure that rests on a foundation of
millions of such household economies. The biggest firms still subcontract out
to family enterprises to provide their workers with package lunches and sake
for the parties that go on endlessly in Japanese economic life.;    Japanese
unemployment is so low because the general economy is in reality a vast social
fabric, and the social fabric is made up of millions of household economies.
In addition there are the many informal networks that make it possible to get
some arubaito from a friend in time of need.;    In Europe, on the other hand,
severe zoning restrictions make it difficult in many areas to start small
businesses. Houses are supposed to be residences, not places of business. A
long history of family dispersal has not only done away with the
three-generational family but is threatening the nuclear family as well. In
Europe, if you lose a job the only way to survive is to find another or get on
the dole.;    America's European roots have brought in the same dislike of
mixing home and business. Cottage industry is frowned on. Unlike arubaito,
moonlighting still has a shady feel about it.;    But in the 1980s, despite
deindustrialization, the United States had a low, un-European unemployment
rate of around 5 percent, and even lower in California where immigrant
influence is strong. Laid-off California automobile workers, according to the
Wall Street Journal, had an easier time adjusting through a flexible mix of
new jobs, moonlighting and expanding family income, than those in Michigan.;
 Economists and the media's business pages pretend that economics is mainly
numbers. Yet the Japanese, who are phenomenally good at the numbers, have long
known better. True, they're worried about their inflated real estate prices.
But what worries them far more is that their remarkable social fabric is
showing signs of looking like that of Europe and America.;    Japan's initial
success was due in good part to its technological borrowing from America. The
time has now come for the United States to consider borrowing some of the
social practices that have made Japan and other East Asian countries so
successful economically.  </TEXT>

genetically engineered plants, has been doing more than just splicing genes. It
has been grafting business deals as well.
</P>
<P>
First came the news of a $4-million agreement with Kirin Brewery Co. of Japan,
announced March 15. And a week ago, the company reported that its researchers
will genetically engineer disease-resistant vegetables with Sakata Seed America
Inc. in a deal valued at less than $500,000.
</P>
<P>
"In the last 3 1/2 years, we've done over $10 million in projects with Japan,"
said Kenneth Moonie, director of product planning for the agricultural
biotechnology firm. "Some of that money is still being paid out over the next
couple of years."
</P>
<P>
Agricultural biotechnology is a fledgling field in which scientists work to
genetically engineer plants and animals to create bio-insecticides,
bio-herbicides, plants resistant to disease and pestilence and treatments for
diseases.
</P>
<P>
Although Japanese investment in ag biotech is still in its early stages,
industry watchers say that its growth is rapid and its future is bright. They
also contend that deals such as Calgene's symbolize the changing nature of
Japanese-American business relationships -- particularly in the area of
technology.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s -- the nascent stages of Japanese investment in U.S.
biotechnology firms -- Japanese investors would swoop in with money and out
with U.S. research and broad licensing rights for future products, said Jim
McCamant, who edits the AgBiotech Stock Letter and the Medical Technology Stock
Letter.
</P>
<P>
Today, they are much more equitable, in part because American companies are
demanding more than just a quick cash infusion in exchange for their research.
And they're getting it.
</P>
<P>
"In the agriculture area, most of the deals being done with the Japanese are
good ones," McCamant said. "Today, when you look at the deals made with Japan,
you'd better ask for a lot. It's clear you're apt to get it."
</P>
<P>
That's just what happened with Calgene in the past month and Mycogen Corp., a
San Diego-based bio-pesticide firm, in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
On March 15, Calgene and Kirin officials announced that the two firms had
agreed to launch a joint venture in the field of potatoes. Kirin would pay
Calgene $2.5 million to purchase 30% of Calgene's seed potato business. The
joint venture would consist of Kirin's 30% share and Calgene's 70%.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Japanese firm agreed to fund a two-year, $1.5-million research
and development project at Calgene to genetically engineer potato seed, making
it resistant to disease and such insects as the Colorado potato beetle.
</P>
<P>
But that's not all. Kirin also agreed to contribute its own potato propagation
technology to the joint venture. Moonie called that part of the deal unique,
and he hasn't gotten much argument about his characterization.
</P>
<P>
"In deals with the Japanese it's been a one-way street, with technology being
transferred from the U.S. to Japan," Moonie said. "What the Kirin people are
providing us with is their production technology, which could revolutionize the
seed potato industry in the U.S."
</P>
<P>
Mycogen is another success story, a firm that Mark Ratner, senior editor at
Bio/Technology magazine, calls "a leader in truly coming to significant
agreements with Japanese companies" in the area of ag biotech.
</P>
<P>
The first was in 1988 with Kubota of Tokyo, a Japanese manufacturer of farm
equipment, said Jerry Caulder, Mycogen's president, chairman and chief
executive. As part of the 1988 deal, Kubota agreed to provide $6 million over
three years for the development of biological insecticides.
</P>
<P>
The agreement gave Kubota exclusive rights in the Far East alone to all
products developed through the collaboration. In addition, Mycogen would
receive 50% of all product sales. Then in 1989, Kubota invested $10 million in
the company, making Kubota a 14% shareholder. Mycogen also has a deal with
Japan Tobacco Inc. for the development of bio-herbicides.
</P>
<P>
"Mycogen is separated from most (ag biotech companies) in that we didn't do
contract research," Caulder said. "We would do deals that brought in money that
augmented our core research projects. I don't think you can build a very large
profitable business . . . giving away your products for royalties."
</P>
<P>
Tetsuo Nishide is director of machinery and technology for the Japan External
Trade Organization in Los Angeles. To Nishide, the increased interest in
agricultural research is partly due to problems Japanese investors have
encountered while trying to break into the U.S. pharmaceutical field.
</P>
<P>
"The agriculture area is one of the perhaps most promising areas," Nishide
said. Investors "can get fruit from the investment. The medical part, it takes
time to get the return because of the procedures to get approval for the
medical products. The agriculture area is the easier way."
</P>
<P>
But other industry watchers warn that Japanese investment in agricultural
biotechnology should not be overstated. It's too early, they say, and Japanese
public opinion is not entirely behind the idea of genetic engineering.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese are "very well versed in 'classical' biotechnology techniques,
especially fermenting," Ratner said. "When it comes to genetic engineering,
they still have a long way to go in terms of public acceptance."
</P>
<P>
The government has yet to allow a field test of a genetically engineered
product, he said. "Public perception of biotechnology is still straight out of
those '50s science fiction movies, where the animal gets irradiated and turns
into a giant," Ratner said. "Instead of radiation, they're worried about
biotechnology."

LET'S EAT OUT: FAMILY STYLE DINING AT MON JAPANESE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
You need to slide, rather than push or pull, the front door open at Mon
Japanese in Tarzana. Then part the noren (hanging fabric panels) to enter into
this cozy little neighborhood restaurant.
</P>
<P>
Run by a Japanese family, the restaurant also attracts a family clientele.
Grass-cloth walls are lined by booths with paper lanterns hanging above the
tables. The L-shaped dining area wraps around the kitchen, leaving only enough
room for three tables in the center.
</P>
<P>
The photo on our table advertising their special dinners-for-two didn't look
very appetizing, but we ordered the shogun boat for the sake of research. Our
meal arrived on a 2 1/2-foot-long wooden vessel, which some might consider a
bit hokey, but sure caught the eye of the children who had just been seated in
the next booth. It wasn't long before a sister ship floated onto their table.
</P>
<P>
Attractively arranged on our boat's deck were lobster, tempura, beef and
chicken teriyaki and two cut oranges. Only the lobster was disappointing.
Although the stuffed shell contained nice big chunks of lobster meat, they were
combined with mushrooms and it was difficult to figure out what else, in a much
too heavy cream sauce.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the tempura batter on the shrimp and vegetables was light and
lacy; although fried in oil, they weren't the least bit greasy. The teriyaki
sauce was also outstanding -- not too salty and an excellent complement to both
the very tender strips of New York steak and boneless chicken.
</P>
<P>
The dinner was certainly sumptuous, especially considering it also included
miso soup, rice, sunomono and green tea ice cream. The miso soup at Mon
Japanese has plenty of flavor with shreds of seaweed and a little sliced green
onion. Their sunomono consists of thinly sliced cucumber and shredded carrot
marinated in a slightly sweet vinegar dressing.
</P>
<P>
The samurai boat dinner includes beef teriyaki, sashimi, tempura, chicken
teriyaki, fruit and green tea ice cream. The Mon boat consists of California
roll, fried oyster, egg roll, chicken teriyaki, fruit and green tea ice cream.
</P>
<P>
A la carte dinners are less extravagant, but still include soup and rice. The
friend who introduced me to this restaurant ordered the salmon, requesting that
it be grilled longer than the rare normally served. It came beautifully
prepared and accompanied by a simple salad.
</P>
<P>
Combination dinners combine two items and are accompanied by soup, sunomono and
rice. The same trio comes with the lobster specials and Mon special dinners,
which feature three items. We were pleased with the salmon teriyaki, tempura
and sushi combination artfully presented on a wood framed tray.
</P>
<P>
The half-dozen sushi, including California roll, shrimp (ebi) and yellow tail
(hamachi) tasted very fresh. The salmon was still nice and moist and the
tempura equally as well-prepared as it had been for the shogun boat.
</P>
<P>
A pot of green tea brewed with crispy rice is the complementary meal
accompaniment. They also offer sake, Japanese bottled and draft beers, plum
wine, domestic beer and wine, soft drinks and ice tea.
</P>
<P>
Green tea ice cream is offered a la carte, as well as with the boat dinners.
It's refreshing, although nothing to rave about. Other desserts include fruit
and ice cream tempura.

   Sakata Inx Corp., a Japanese maker of printing ink, said it agreed to buy Midland Color Co. of Chicago, the fifth largest U.S. ink maker, for $42 million and that it purchased another U.S. company, Knight Color &amp; Chemicals Co. of Montrose, Minn.
The price of that transaction wasn't disclosed.

   The company also announced the establishment of a joint venture company in Indonesia.

   Sakata Inx officials said the three steps were in line with the company's plans to strengthen its global operations.

   Sakata Inx established a joint venture company in Indonesia called Pt Sakata Inx Indonesia, together with a local publishing company and certain other interests.
Sakata will own 51% of the joint venture in Jakarta.
It will start producing and marketing printing ink in Indonesia next spring.

<HEADLINE>  MUSICAL ENTERTAINS IN TWO LANGUAGES
U.S.-JAPAN CONCERNS SERVED OVER RICE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Theater  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Then top it with rice -- some from Thibodeaux, La., and some from Sakiyama,
Japan.;   The boisterous, improbable result is "Labor of Love," the world's
first bilingual, bicultural, Cajun-Japanese musical comedy, which staged its
U.S. premiere before receptive crowds here in Seattle last weekend and plays
Friday through Sunday at the Cowell Theater at Fort Mason in San Francisco.;
Amid simmering tensions about trade that continue to dog the United States'
relationship with Japan, this two-hour rice-farmer musical doesn't avoid the
frictions that exist between the two industrial giants but reminds audiences
that rice growers in both nations face similar hurdles.;   On both sides of
the ocean, rice-harvesting doesn't pay without government support; on both
continents children want to abandon the traditional farms; in both nations,
rice-farming is laden with historical and cultural ties that are painfully
difficult to sever.;   'It's about cooperation';   "This play isn't about
rice," said Soichi Toda, president of Gekkeikan Sake U.S.A., the U.S. sponsor
of the tour, which is scheduled to barnstorm through rural rice-growing areas
of Arkansas and Louisiana. "It's about cooperation, cooperation between Japan
and the U.S.;   "Rice is a very political matter between Japan and the United
States," acknowledged Toda, whose firm last May opened a sake brewery in
Folsom, to distill sake from California-grown rice. "It is a matter than may
be resolved some day in the future. But the humanity of harvesting rice, the
human connection, is much more fundamental.";   The play, co-produced by the
One Reel of Seattle and Furusato Caravan of Tokyo, was warmly received earlier
this summer when it went on a 14-city tour of Japan, including stops in many
small, rural prefectures.;   "For many of those rural audiences, it is very
rare to see Americans," explained Katsuhiko Ishizuka, the Japanese co-director
of the play. "They harbor some uneasy feelings about Americans. But after a
while of watching the play, there was no longer a fear or distrust of these
American actors but an admiration and respect for Americans and their
country.";   A boisterous look at mores, manners and miscommunications, "Labor
of Love" focuses on the problems caused when Kenichi Suzuki, eldest son of a
rice-growing family in Japan, is invited to the rice-growing bayous of
Louisiana as part of an exchange program.;   There he learns about combines
and hot rods, and begins a friendship with Ali, one of the Thibodeaux
daughters. But difficulties begin when "Ken" writes an innocent note home to
his family, which is read by his parents as a sign that he is going to marry
the Thibodeaux daughter and bring her home to the farm.;   Thus begins a
home-exchange between the families, in which the subdued Suzuki family marvels
at the size of the Thibodeaux spread and the spiciness of creole cooking,
while the boisterous Thibodeaux clan wonders aloud about the squat toilets and
"paper doors" they encounter in the Suzuki home.;   While in the end, both
families agree that rice farming is an antiquated, poorly paid "Labor of
Love," the musical doesn't flinch from dredging up the seemingly perpetual
controversies between Americans and Japanese, including a fight among two
grandparents about Hiroshima and a confrontation over the fact that, though
Americans buy Japanese cars, Japanese consumers won't buy American rice.;
"The bottom line is that people don't need cars," a member of the Suzuki clan
says, "but they always need food.";   The unique creative collaboration behind
the play resulted from the work of One Reel executive producer Norman Langill,
who wanted to bring to the United States the kind of rural, traveling theater
that Furusato Caravan carries out in Japan -- shows about rural life produced
in front of rural people.;   After long discussions, the producers and show
writers toured apple orchards, wheat fields and tangerine farms before
settling on the rice harvest, which is associated with rich cultural legacies
on both sides of the Pacific.;   "When we were first working on this project,"
Ishizuka said, "we talked all about our differences in culture, language and
lifestyle. But after we spent time with the farmers in Louisiana and in Japan,
we discussed more and more the similarities.;   "This is really a play about
farmers' lives and how similar they are," he added, speaking through a
translator.;   U.S. version is a bit different;   Disconcerting as it may be
to see a blond, blue-eyed woman belting out a tune in Japanese, or a Japanese
singing about the joys of Cajun roux, the musical goes out of its way to
accommodate each language, with supratitles and translations built into the
staging. And, Ishizuka acknowledges, the play was transformed slightly for its
U.S. audiences because "Japanese humor wouldn't work in America.";   "The
jokes are hard to translate," he said, adding through his translator that he's
not eager to begin another Japanese-American collaboration.; Labor of Love;

  [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 7 KYODO -- The seven ruling coalition
parties' policy coordinators agreed on the details Monday [7
February] of an increase in liquor tax rates on beer, sake and
shochu (Japanese white distilled liquor) in response to
complaints from European Union nations. The tax rates on
whiskey, however, will be left unchanged.
  The raise will increase the tax on beer by 8.86 yen per 633
milliliter bottle. The retail price of beer is likely to rise
by 10 yen per bottle, coordinators said.
  The raise, which will become effective in May at the
earliest, has been sought by the EU countries, which complained
that liquor tax rates on shochu are much lower than those on
whiskey.
  As a result of the increase, tax rates on whiskey will be
3.9
times those on grade A shochu instead of the existing 5.1 times,
and 6.0 times those on grade B shochu instead of the current 8.7
times, the coordinators said.
  The tax on sake will increase the price of a 1.8 liter
bottle
by 12.6 yen.

FT  09 APR 92 / Management: Brewers move ahead in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL WEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Dirk Enters began marketing Heineken beer in Japan 15 years ago,
foreign labels were an exotic oddity. After years of alliance-building and
gradual expansion, overseas brewers are getting an intoxicating taste of
what may lie ahead.
Each of the four imported beers established in Japan has tied up with one of
the big four domestic brewers. Of the American groups, Budweiser has linked
with Suntory, Coors with Asahi and Miller with Sapporo, while Heineken of
the Netherlands has been working with Kirin.
In the past four years, both imports and foreign beers brewed under licence
locally have increased their share of a growing market, although they still
have only 2.3 per cent, compared with about 5 per cent held by imports in
other beer drinking countries.
'This is an immature beer market,' says Heineken's Enters. He notes that
while consumers are inundated with new labels and advertising campaigns,
Japan lacks Europe's variety of large and private labels and price
competition.
The US competitors appear to be setting their sights particularly high, with
their pricing and marketing strategies aimed at the mass market. Only
Heineken is sticking to the premium segment.
Budweiser, the world's best-selling beer, is already Japan's top import
label - its distinctive all-American label and fun-loving sales pitch seems
to appeal to image-conscious young adults.
While beer may appear a popular tipple at Japanese social occasions, per
capita consumption remains less than half the average in many European
nations. Cultural factors are one reason, with sake and shochu highly
popular. But so too is the heady cost, given the lack of price competition
and the higher tax on beer than on other alcoholic drinks.
Whether foreign brewers proceed alone or with partners who have mixed
feelings about their success, they will have to expand sales in bars,
restaurants and discos, which still account for most of their turnover. They
must also grab more shelf space in liquor shops and the growing ranks of
supermarkets and convenience stores being permitted to sell beer.
The tight reins that tax collectors and local brewers have held on pricing
for decades are being loosened. Last year Japan's Fair Trade Commission
launched an investigation into price-fixing by the big domestic brewers. It
concluded no illegal activity had occurred, but urged brewers to run ads
telling retailers that their published prices were recommendations only.
The small family-run liquor shops that still dominate the retail trade
remain reluctant to discount local brands, although large retailers
regularly cut prices for foreign labels.
The Japanese palate seems sensitive to price.
Budweiser sales soared 80 per cent in the first half of 1990 when local
brewers increased their prices. The Americans' production cost advantage has
helped them narrow the gap.
Foreign brewers have one other trump card: as the beer industry becomes a
global business, Japanese brewers are keen to develop their own export
markets. To do so, they will need close industry allies abroad.

SHOPPING: BUDGET ROES FOR CAVIAR DREAMS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beluga and Sevruga are swell, especially for New Year's. But if these two
delicacies are beyond your pocketbook, welcome the new year with caviar anyway
-- budget caviars that cost as little as 57 cents an ounce.
</P>
<P>
They're the roe of pollock, cod, smelt, herring and flying fish, and you'll
find them in Japanese and Korean markets. Don't look down on these Oriental
products as poor cousins to costly sturgeon and salmon roe. They have their own
personalities. Some taste subtly of sake. And some are so zingy with red pepper
or Japanese horseradish (wasabi) that you'll be gasping for Champagne or
whatever cold drink is at hand.
</P>
<P>
In sushi bars, you may have seen tiny golden grains of smelt roe paired with a
quail egg atop nori-wrapped rice. Called masago, this roe costs as little as
$1.99 for 3 ounces. Brilliant orange masago makes a fine topping for a pale
dip, a bright garnish for a canape or an addition to a spread. Try also topping
a cucumber slice with a mound of roe, or scatter it over cream cheese that
you've spread on a cracker, cucumber or zucchini slice.
</P>
<P>
The brand sampled for this column, packed by Nishimoto Trading Co. of Kobe, was
mild in flavor and tasted pleasantly of sweet sake. Not all smelt roe products
are identical, however. Lake smelt roe from the Pacific California Fish Co.,
purchased in a Korean market, had more ocean flavor, and the label listed salt
as the only seasoning. The price was $4.99 for a 6-ounce tub.
</P>
<P>
Pacific California also packs flying fish roe -- tobiko -- at $7.50 for a
6-ounce tub. Salty and a bit sweet from mirin (sweet sake), it is darker in
color than the smelt roe but can be used in the same fashion.
</P>
<P>
Salmon roe (ikura) is much more expensive -- $29.99 a pound at Yaohan in Little
Tokyo. But Yaohan also packs small quantities in disposable blue and white,
bamboo-patterned trays that can go straight to the table. The price is $2.70.
</P>
<P>
Two products that require caution are herring roe with horseradish (kazunoko
wasabi) from Nishimoto Trading Co. and Pacific Giant salted herring roe from
Korea. The herring roe with horseradish is a smooth green paste that includes
radish, cucumber, wasabi, sake and roe. The wasabi dominates, and even a small
taste will send shock waves up your nose.
</P>
<P>
The Korean salted herring roe looks like red pepper paste, and that's what it
tastes like. Incredibly hot, it is best used as a spicy condiment. Stir a
little into soups, sauces or dips that can take a hot touch. But there's more
to the flavor than red pepper. Garlic and sugar are also blended in.
</P>
<P>
The least expensive product sampled was the herring roe with horseradish at
$1.99 for 3.52 ounces. The salted herring roe was $5.99 for a 5.6-ounce jar.
</P>
<P>
Seasoned pollock roe from Korea, packed by Marukai Corp. of Honolulu, could be
used straight from the jar as a spread or blended with cream cheese for a
milder flavor. It's a pasty product with a flavor reminiscent of caviar. Red
pepper seasons the mixture, but gently. Rice wine, soy sauce, garlic and bonito
are other ingredients. This was $4.99 for an 8-ounce jar at the California
market.
</P>
<P>
Sugar is the second ingredient on the label of seasoned cod fish roe, a
Japanese product from Showa Marine Inc. However, the taste is only mildly
sweet. The granules are distinct rather than processed into a paste and would
look good in a dip. The price was $5.99 for a 3.1-ounce jar.
</P>
<P>
Other roe products available in Asian markets include one that seems to be
making a bid for wider acceptance. This is Yamaya's spicy mentai, seasoned
pollock roe that is touted on the label as "a new Oriental appetizing caviar."
The price was $4.98 for 8 ounces at Yaohan.

<P>
 Yaohan is located at 333 S. Alameda St., Los Angeles, and 2121 W. 182nd St.,
Torrance. Other markets that sell the roe products sampled are Enbun Co., 124
Japanese Village Plaza Mall, Little Tokyo; Modern Food Market, 332 East 2nd
St., Little Tokyo; and California Market, a Korean market at 450 S. Western
Ave., Los Angeles. sg,2

<LEADPARA>  THERE comes a time in everyone's life -- especially after holiday shopping --
when the only solution to the vagaries of existence is finding a hot Japanese
bath for your body, a cold bottle of champagne for your soul and a hard futon
for your aching back.;   Which leads us to the Miyako Hotel in the heart of
San Francisco's Japantown, where all the above ingredients are not only
available, but part of the hotel's charm.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A TASTE OF JAPAN IN THE HEART OF S.F.  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Someplace Special; Third in an occasional series  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     To be totally honest, the Miyako is a compromise between what you'd think a
Japanese hotel would be like and the realities of operating a hotel in the
westernized United States. At best, what you can do is get a whiff or two of
Japan, while realizing you're only a block or so from Geary Avenue.;   Still,
for those who are tired of what we might call "Corporate Hotel Decor," where
it's almost impossible to remember what city you're in, let alone what hotel,
the Miyako is a tasty change.;   In addition to its Japanese-style rooms,
however, the hotel has a number of Americanized rooms, most with private
saunas. These are probably for Japanese businessmen who are heartily tired of
futons and tatami mats and long for a huge American bed.;   Going to a
Japanese-style hotel and not staying in a Japanese-style room seems to defeat
the whole purpose, of course, although the American sauna suites are fine. We
chose one of the Japanese rooms, complete with sliding wooden doors and the
aforementioned futon and mats. The view out the window was splendid,
overlooking the hotel's tiny Japanese garden with a view of the Peace Pagoda
in the background.;   The bathtub, huge and deep, was still not quite
Japanese. But the water was hot and a supply of curious chemicals -- purported
to be restorative -- turned the water first yellow, then green. Whatever.
Amenities included two Japanese robes, just to put you in the Asian mood.;
The hotel cocktail bar was small and cozy; the dining room, spacious. Service
throughout, from valet parkers to waitresses in kimonos, was first class. We
do have to report that we found the Miyako's Japanese restaurant a tad
disappointing. The salmon teriyaki was bland, the prawn and vegetable tempura
a bit too oily. The sake was warm on arrival, but after it sat a bit, got
cold; no one offered to warm it back up. Ever had cold sake?;   Food aside,
most of the experience was just what the doctor -- and our aching backs --
ordered.; The Miyako Hotel; Where: 1625 Post St., San Francisco 94115; (800)

NANCY REAGAN'S CRITICS TAKE TURNS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After reading "Her Turn" I feel compelled to point out a discrepancy in Mrs.
Reagan's account of why she wrote her memoirs. She cites her sake, her
children's sake and history's sake as reasons for writing her book.
Conspicuously absent is Mrs. Reagan's bank account's need for the book.
</P>
<P>
"Too much is going on right now" for Nancy to get involved in a drug center.
Too busy ringing up her cash register, I guess. "Just Say No" kind of died
after Reagan left office, but then again, most drug treatment centers are
nonprofit, aren't they?
</P>
<P>
A free house in Beverly Hills, $2 million to go to Japan and five-figure
speaking fees. Who's kidding who? With her "Just Say No" program, Nancy Reagan
expected ghetto children to work for minimum wage rather than make hundreds of
dollars a day selling crack on the street. She doesn't seem to realize that she
and these children have two things in common: greed and a lack of moral
conscience.

RECIPES HELP CELEBRATE NISEI WEEK IN LITTLE TOKYO
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE DOSTI, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nisei Week, which starts Saturday and continues until Aug. 13 in Little Tokyo,
will take you to Japan without having to fly there.
</P>
<P>
There will be a full week of street food-tasting that will match any on a
country road in Japan. Imagawa yaki (fried bean cakes), sushi and yaki-tori
(fried kebabs) are but some of the typical foods of the festival.
</P>
<P>
You may also find kushi-age, which is much like yaki-tori, except the foods are
breaded before frying and are served with dipping sauces or lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
Nisei Week, a celebration created by second generation Japanese (Nisei means
second generation) to foster good will and good business in their community, is
packed solidly with events, ranging from cooking demonstrations, art exhibits,
a car show, karate, kendo, aikido and iaido as well as other Japanese martial
arts demonstrations, a 5-K run and musical entertainment, including the Fujika
Quintet. There is no Nisei Week, however, without the coronation of the Nisei
Week Queen and ball -- which kick off the festivities on Saturday -- or the
parade at 4 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But the food traditions are direct copies of those in Japan. Most of the street
foods are considered fast food because they are generally made on the spot.
</P>
<P>
For instance, yaki-tori, skewered bits and pieces of meat, fish or poultry, are
marinated for several hours but cooked to order by the street vendor (or
restaurant chef). Maki sushi (rolled sushi) is made on the spot to customers'
order, as is temaki sushi (seasoned rice and other foods wrapped in seaweed).
</P>
<P>
You will find imagawa yaki vendors preparing little flat cakes filled with soy
bean paste in cylindrical vats, much as one would make waffles. Then there is
the cooling taste of shaved ice cones topped with strawberry or lime syrup that
delight children and adults alike.
</P>
<P>
Nisei Week began 49 years ago in Little Tokyo to help second generation
Japanese Americans generate business in the Little Tokyo community. The first
festival included a poster contest, essay contest, some radio broadcasts, a
fashion show and various exhibits including a parade through the streets of
Little Tokyo. The following year, a beauty pageant, with a queen chosen by vote
was added.
</P>
<P>
Today's princesses are nominated by community organizations. The festival
ceased when Japanese-Americans were interned in camps during World War II but
resumed in 1949. Today hundreds of volunteers from community organizations help
promote and work in the Nisei Week program. The program of the week's events is
available at most shops, restaurants and banks in Little Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
If you can't get to the festival, here are a few recipes to make you think you
are there. The recipes are from former issues of Palate Pleasers magazine
(Apcon International Inc., Los Angeles), published semiannually, and have not
been tested in The Times Test Kitchen.

<LEADPARA>  THE year's end in Japan begins in mid-November with the first sake-soaked
party to forget the old year. The parties-to-forget continue for weeks, segue
into parties to welcome the new year, and finally putter out around
mid-January, when the new year at last comes into focus.;   Japanese
policy-makers peering through December's alcohol fog are already focusing on a
new year more welcome than most. Japan's big chance to graduate from
diplomatic bridesmaid to diplomatic bride will come in 1992, changing the
international balance of power.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In short, Japan will finally win a permanent seat on the United Nations
Security Council.;   Japan has wanted a Security Council seat for a long time
to give it international diplomatic standing commensurate with its economic
might. For 46 years, council members have resisted changing the body's
membership for fear of permanently upsetting its balance of power.;   But the
dissolution of the Soviet Union will force the issue.;   Nevertheless, Japan
will have to fight an intense diplomatic battle to win a seat. For starters,
Tokyo will become the biggest contributor of foreign aid to pieces of the
former Soviet Union.;   Japan will have to press hard on other fronts as well,
mostly by spreading foreign aid generously around the world. Prime Minister
Kiichi Miyazawa will also oversee several peacemaking efforts. His biggest
coup will be winning North Korea's agreement to abandon nuclear weapons
development in return for several billion yen in loans, trade guarantees and
technical assistance.;   The prime minister will also pull every political
string at his disposal to pass legislation allowing Japanese troops to serve
as U.N. peacekeeping forces.;   Miyazawa's biggest task, however, will be
winning a Security Council nod from the United States.;   After months of
heavy courtship, which will include opening Japan's market to imported rice
and conclusion of international trade talks, President Bush will give his
blessing to the new council seat for Japan.;   But Bush will be preoccupied
with getting re-elected. That means any action on the council seat decision
will come after Nov. 3, most likely a week or two later, just in time for the
forget-the-year parties, giving Japanese policy-makers several weeks of sake
drinking before they have to focus on the responsibilities of diplomatic
married life.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>  A I'm not going to speculate about your ability to attract girlfriends, but I
can provide some information about tattoo removal. Although there are several
methods, the skin cannot be returned to its original condition.;    If time is
a factor, a chemical peel may be your best choice. It takes only a couple of
minutes to apply, does not require anesthesia and can be performed on an
outpatient basis. The treatment results in the formation of a scab, which
eventually falls off.;    "As with all of the other methods of removing
tattoos, chemical peel leaves its own mark: . . . a scar that's lighter or
darker, and often of a different texture, than the skin that surrounds it,"
says Dr. Michael Marschall.;    Used traditionally to remove fine facial
wrinkles, a chemical peel burns away the top layer of skin. However, unlike
the phenol solution used for many face peels, the trichloroacetic acid used by
Marschall is not absorbed by the body and does not pose a risk of heart
problems.;    Tattoos also can be removed by cutting them out, "sanding" them
off through a process called dermabrasion, or vaporizing the pigment with a
laser.;    Q When I was in Japan with the Army, I tried sake and found that I
liked it. How does the amount of alcohol in sake compare with the amount in
wine?; -- Len, Camden, N.J.; A Sake is made from rice. Its alcohol content is
about 16 percent, compared with an alcohol content of about 11 percent to 14
percent for wine  </TEXT>

Yen Envy: Your Money Doesn't Matter
---
By James P. Sterba</HL>
<DD> 06/19/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<DATELINE> NARITA, Japan  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   I've always been quietly chauvinistic about my nation's currency.
It made me feel good, secretly, that the Viet Cong wanted dollars during the war more than they wanted piasters, or dong, or even francs.

   I could swagger up to a money changer anywhere in Asia, plunk down a trusty greenback, and bathe in the courtesy and attentiveness my money mustered.
The house abacus would be launched into its elegant tap dance, and presto: One of mine always seemed to net a bundle of theirs.

   My bills were dull green and all the same size, but portraits of rather stern gentlemen stared up at the money changer as if to say, "This is the right stuff, pal." (Which, incidently, is why I could imagine, say, a Volcker dollar but not a Nixon, Ford, Carter or Reagan dollar.)
Anyway, what I usually got in return was paper in various colors and sizes, sometimes adorned with etchings of peasants in rice fields, or water buffalo.

   My money was a perk for being an American, and it greased many a passage through the Orient.
Then I came here, to Tokyo's international airport, with seven hours to kill thanks to the scheduling geniuses at Northwest Orient Airlines.
One look at the exchange rate -- 137.75 yen to the dollar -- and I concluded that humility was near and that I was about to make a personally major contribution to the trade deficit.
I changed a C-note for a couple of pieces of brown paper and some coins.
No bundles here, although there were a lot of zeros on the yen notes.

   Anyone who has transited at Narita knows two things: Going to downtown Tokyo takes too long and costs too much unless you have about 48 hours, but waiting around in the Narita international transit lounge, with its crowds, backless seats and four-in-the-morning ambiance, is murder.

   I opted to go through immigration and customs and into the main section of the airport.
This took an hour and 45 minutes, the first part of which involved standing in a long queue in front of a sign that read not "Foreigners" or "Nonresidents," but "Aliens."
I passed the time thinking about Sigourney Weaver.
Visaless, the immigration man eventually stamped "shore leave" on my transit pass, thus waiving the $14.52 airport departure tax; the customs woman waved me through; and for a fixed fee of $2.90 a porter rolled my two bags to a storage room where, for $4.36, they were looked after.
Not so bad.

   Before plunging into a major reconnaissance, I bought an Asahi Evening News for 87 cents and boarded an escalator for Cafe Toyosaki, one flight up.
There, for $3.27, I was provided with a bottle of Kirin beer and a tiny table overlooking the south-wing arrival lobby I had just traversed.
It was pleasant enough, until I noticed that I could look out above the arrival lobby through a glass wall and see the long queue in front of the "Aliens" sign again, which turned my attention back to Ms. Weaver.

   I like Narita's layout: two compact, multistory wings, with relatively short corridors leading to the planes.
It isn't a jumble of different buildings like JFK in New York, and you don't have to walk endless miles as in O'Hare in Chicago.
Its workers are dauntingly efficient and invariably polite.
Security seems tight.
It just isn't a very comfortable place.

   After calling the Tokyo office (the phone quickly ate five 100-yen coins ($3.63), I went window shopping for lunch.
The Keisei restaurant on the departure-lounge floor offered hot dogs for $5.81, french fries for $2.90, a green salad for $3.63, bread and butter (or steamed rice) for $1.45 and coffee for $2.18.

   At the Avion restaurant, I could purchase a club sandwich for $7.26, pie a la mode for $5.08, a Coke for $2.54, or a large draft beer for $5.81.
These are Waldorf prices -- at least Waldorf coffee-shop prices.

   One flight above the departure lounge was the Big Boy restaurant, featuring a $7.26 cheeseburger and a $6.17 tuna-fish sandwich.
I've paid that much for a cheeseburger in New York, but a lot of atmosphere came with it or else Woody Allen and Mia Farrow were sitting at the next table.
Or else I was being ripped off and everybody knew it.
I got the feeling, however, that the people inside the Big Boy didn't think $6.17 was a lot for a tuna-fish sandwich.
Since they all seemed to be Japanese, they weren't thinking in dollars anyway.
They were thinking 850 yen -- peanuts.

   Anyway, I ended up at the Yama restaurant and ate shredded pork for $14.52, fried rice for $6.53 and iced tea for $2.54.
Small portions.

   With four more hours to burn, I thought about getting a haircut.
But when I found the barbershop, its sign read "regular cut, 3,000 yen."
That's $21.78, and since the man with the scissors bore no resemblance to Kenneth, I pushed on.

   Down in the basement, I found a medical clinic that would check me out and provide medicine for a set fee of 4,000 yen, or $29.04, or give me a vaccination for 2,000 yen, or $14.52.
But I needed neither.
The basement, however, held my first sight of bargains.
A small grocery store there was bustling with customers: men in coveralls, women in Avis uniforms, and other airport workers.
Sure, an apple cost $2.90, but a banana was going for only 36 cents, and a can of Sapporo beer was only $1.56.

   Similar prices and similar airport workers could also be found up on the observation-deck floor.
Show your ticket and the hostess lets you in free.
At little food and souvenir booths, a coke was only 83 cents, what had a vague resemblance to a hamburger went for $1.89, a bottle of J&amp;B scotch was on sale for $29.04, and a bottle of Robert Mondavi white table wine seemed like a steal for only $8.71.

   But I decided that this was my day of living dangerously, so I ventured back to the main-floor restaurant row for dinner and found a sushi bar that wasn't named in English and was crowded with Japanese but didn't seem to have any foreign customers.
Various offerings were written in Japanese on little wooden boards and paper streamers, and spoken English seemed to be limited to "thank you."

   I ordered some hot sake, and before long was having a wonderful time watching the chef prepare little sushi bundles and rolls for everyone else.
When he concocted something that appealed to me, I'd motion from my end of the bar, he'd snap off a crisp "Hai" and before long I'd get some too.

   The sake was tummy-warming and restful.
The raw tuna, broiled eels, dancing shrimp and other delicacies kept coming.
A good time seemed to be had by all, and soon came the bill: 12,600 yen, or $91.47.

FT  19 JUN 93 / Political paralysis looms over G7 summit

JAPAN'S political crisis could not have come at a more sensitive time for
its international economic relations.
With a general election due in late July, the country will be in the midst
of the election campaign when Tokyo hosts the summit of the Group of Seven
leading industrialised starting on July 7.
That week Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, is due to sign an
agreement with US President Bill Clinton on a framework for Japan and the US
to negotiate trade disputes.
The prospects for the Gatt world trade talks have also been hurt. The
Japanese government, fearful of being punished in the polls, will be in no
position to deliver concessions for the sake of a Gatt agreement at the
summit.
The immediate consequence of the no-confidence vote will be paralysis of the
government. Mr Miyazawa has become a lame duck and all major decisions will
be put off during the campaign. The election itself could yield a weak,
LDP-led coalition government.
In the short run the main beneficiaries of the crisis may be Japan's
powerful bureaucrats, who will have more scope to act on their own
initiative. But in the medium run the bureaucrats can only work effectively
if strong politicians are on hand to take big decisions, for instance over
whether the ailing Japanese economy needs more stimulus or what concessions
to make on agriculture for the sake of the Gatt talks.
The summit may not be too damaged because plans for its agenda are already
fairly well advanced. Indeed a successful summit would strengthen the LDP's
claim to be the only party capable of representing Japan on the world stage.
However, the ageing Mr Miyazawa is likely to look weak next to the
relatively youthful Mr Clinton and the new Canadian prime minister Ms Kim
Campbell.
Japan's bilateral meetings with Russian President Boris Yeltsin may be
particularly troubling, as Mr Yeltsin is likely to make clear Japan should
not expect concessions in the dispute with Russia over the Kurile islands
north of Japan. Rough treatment from Mr Yeltsin would be a further
humiliation for Mr Miyazawa.
As for the talks with the US, foreign ministry officials are confident the
outline framework for trade negotiations can be agreed by officials. But
substantive talks on specific issues such as opening up the market for
supercomputers or car parts will have to be shelved.
In addition US calls for further stimulus for the Japanese economy will only
be met by a strong government capable of overcoming the finance ministry's
opposition to more government pump priming.
The same is true of the Gatt talks. Tokyo will next week host a meeting of
trade ministers from the EC, the US and Canada. It was widely hoped this
would deliver an agreement on market access measures. That may be more
difficult now. But what can certainly be ruled out in the near future is any
Japanese concessions on its rice import ban, which is the main Japanese
obstacle to a Gatt deal.
The LDP needs all the support it can get. Its unwillingness to support
political reform may well have antagonised young urban voters. The last
thing it will want to do is to alienate its traditional rural supporters as
well.

<LEADPARA>  TSUNAMI Grill may be the perfect neighborhood restaurant. I sat there one
night not long ago for more than two hours -- reading, talking to a friend,
drinking beer and eating. Mostly eating. Every once in a while the waitress,
who is the wife of the chef and the daughter of the owners, would wander over.
We'd talk awhile and then order still more food.;   We ate wonderfully fresh,
buttery yellowtail, smoky salmon, creamy giant clam. Some of it was free,
because Tsunami's idea of happy hour is free sushi with every large bottle of
Japanese beer you order. The rest cost $3 a pair.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Then we ate sunomoni, thinly sliced Japanese cucumber with vegetables and
chunks of octopus ($3.50); oshitashi, a pleasantly salty dish of cold steamed

agedashi nasu ($3), chunks of fried eggplant served in the skin and topped
with chopped scallions and dried flakes of bonita tuna, the whole thing
surrounded by a teriyaki moat.;   Then we ordered some skewered shrimp and
skewered scallops ($3.50 for two skewers), quickly grilled with a bit of
teriyaki, miso or salty shio sauce. The shrimp were chewy and uninteresting --
the only thing we tried all night that was -- but the scallops were tender and
perfect.;   As the piece de resistance we ate . . . tofu. Really. Two big
grilled tofu "steaks" with a thick, slightly sweet miso sauce, $5 instead of
$7 because we didn't want the soup, salad and rice that came with the Tofu

BEAUTY QUEST TOUCHES OFF A GOLD MASSAGE IN JAPAN

Want your skin to have that golden glow? Get it massaged with the precious
metal.
</P>
<P>
"With its rich, bright shine, gold offers smoother skin than any massage
cream," said the manager of a beauty salon in Osaka, western Japan, which
offers gold massage.
</P>
<P>
Japan is now one of the world's largest importers of gold, largely due to a
growing demand among newly affluent Japanese for all things golden.
</P>
<P>
Some Japanese sushi bars offer the rice and raw fish delicacy with thin gold
belts wrapped around it. Others offer dried seasoning with gold in it to
sprinkle on noodles.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Golden Sake
</P>
<P>
Some sell sake with small pieces of gold floating in it.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese have a long history of eating gold -- they think it's good for the
health.
</P>
<P>
The full "Goldfinger" body treatment at the Osaka clinic, which takes about an
hour, costs $230, while a facial massage is $60 -- more than double the prices
for normal massages.
</P>
<P>
"It stimulates blood circulation much more than any other massage cream and
eventually makes the skin shine more than regular cream massages can," a
beautician at the clinic says.
</P>
<P>
The clinic uses about a handful of ultra-thin gold foil sheets for each full
body massage. All of the gold is absorbed into the skin, the manager says.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demand Is Growing
</P>
<P>
Despite the high price, demand for the service is growing.
</P>
<P>
"An average of one customer a day shows up for a gold massage. Business has
been going well," she said, adding that quite a few customers return at least
once a month.
</P>
<P>
The clinic said it has received several inquiries about the service from men
but has had to turn them down.
</P>
<P>
"Our clinic is not large enough to have separate rooms for men and women," the
spokeswoman said. "We have to refuse men because customers must be naked for a
session."
</P>
<P>
One woman who requested anonymity said she had tried the gold massage and felt
her skin was smoother after the treatment. But, she added, she could not afford
the treatment again.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mental Benefits Stressed
</P>
<P>
A doctor specializing in dermatology who declined to be identified said the
positive effects of such treatment are likely to be more mental than physical.
</P>
<P>
"All one can get from this kind of massage is psychological satisfaction, no
physical benefits at all," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Gold is one of those materials that is nearly impossible to absorb. From that
point of view, I can see no medical merit in a gold massage."
</P>
<P>
He added that as long as the gold is pure, no skin problems should result from
the treatment. However, if it contains lead or zinc, some customers could
suffer allergic reactions.

   Anheuser-Busch Cos. said it filed a complaint with the
Federal Trade Commission charging rival brewer Adolph Coors
Co. with "false and deceptive" advertising practices for
touting its Rocky Mountain roots.
   The flap began after Coors started testing an advertising
campaign that brags about the "Clean, fresh, pure Rocky
Mountain Spring water" used to brew its beer. The 30- and
60-second television advertisements cut back and forth
between quiet scenes of Colorado mountains and pictures of
the crowded highways of big cities.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Anheuser took its gripe public after Coors announced on
Tuesday its plans to buy a Memphis, Tenn., brewery from Stroh
Brewery Co. "We wonder how that company can maintain its
`Rocky Mountain identity' while brewing in Memphis," said
Michael J. Roarty, executive vice president of corporate
marketing at Anheuser-Busch.
   Mr. Roarty said that the Coors campaign implies that its
beers are brewed using only Colorado water. But Coors
actually makes some beer in a packaging facility in Virginia
by mixing local water with beer concentrate, according to Mr.
Roarty. The water is fine, but "the advertising is deceptive,
and we think they should stop it," he said.
   In Golden, a spokeswoman for Coors said all Coors beer is
currently brewed in Golden with Rocky Mountain spring water,
and "we've made no decision to brew anywhere else." The
spokeswoman also said that all beer starts as "high-gravity
beer," including beers made by Anheuser-Busch, which are
later blended with water and carbon dioxide to meet
government alcohol-content requirements. Coors does ship
about 15% of its high-gravity beer to Virginia, where it is
blended with water and packaged, the spokeswoman said.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Freshwater mussels and clams are falling victim
to disease and greed, and experts ponder the fate of the rivers
that depend on them.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAVANA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ecologist Richard Sparks has worked the
muddy bottoms of the Mississippi and Illinois rivers studying
freshwater clams and mussels _ nature's water filters _ and he
doesn't like what he sees.
   The shelled creatures are disappearing from their native North
American riverbeds, where they spend their lives filtering polluted
water through hairline openings in their shells. Scientists cite
two reasons.
   One is massive die-offs, as yet unexplained.
   The other is the voracious appetite of the Japanese cultured
pearl industry, which grinds tiny beads from mussel shells and
imbeds them in oysters to produce pearls. Over-zealous shellers are
staging a rush on U.S. mussel beds, further harming supplies.
   ``There used to be 50 species of mussels on the upper
Mississippi, and now there're only 36 to 38 left,'' says Sparks, a
river ecologist with the Illinois Natural History Survey at its
river research lab in Havana.
   Sparks is one of dozens of scientists and others in states
across the Midwest concerned about the plight of mussels and clams,
which come in all sizes and shapes and live as long as 50 years.
   ``I've been buying shells on the Mississippi River for 14
years,'' says D.E. ``Butch'' Ballenger, owner of the Mississippi
Valley Shell Co., in Muscatine, Iowa. ``I plan on doing this a long
time. That's why me and another buyer pushed for laws in Wisconsin
and Iowa to limit the season and shell size.''
   Ballenger, 49, employs about 130 harvesters. He exports his
shells to Japan and is working with environmentalists to get state
action to protect the mussels from over-harvest.
   He worries about the recent influx of shellers from rivers in
states such as Oklahoma, Texas, Alabama, Tennessee and Kentucky.
   ``We're getting more and more shellers from out-of-state,''
Ballenger says. ``The mussel beds down south are exhausted, and
they're moving up here. States along the upper Mississippi
shouldn't sell out-of-state shelling licenses.''
   Shelling is a multimillion-dollar industry in the United States,
with shells alone selling for $300 to $1,000 per ton.
   In 1987, 1,128 tons were collected from Illinois and 1,016 tons
from Iowa. Wisconsin waters yielded 667 tons of shells in 1986, the
only full year for which figures were available.
   Freshwater clams and mussels are harvested by hand, using hooks
on poles or by dredging riverbeds.
   In Camden, Tenn., John Latendresse has branched out from simply
selling shells to Japan through his Tennessee Shell Co. Now, he's
growing pearls and producing jewelry _ the first American to crack
the Japanese-dominated industry.
   He says the cultured pearl industry accounts for 3,000 jobs in
Japan, and his dream is to bring as many of those as possible to
the United States. But the industry may be short-lived, Latendresse
says, unless state and federal lawmakers act to protect American
mussel beds.
   ``We exported $16 million worth of mussels to Japan in 1986,''
says Latendresse, citing industry research. ``Cultured pearls are a
$500 million a year industry over there. We're exhausting our
mussel beds to supply their industry. It's a big problem, and I'm
very concerned about it.''
   Even representatives of Japan's cultured pearl industry are
concerned about overharvest in the United States.
   ``It's a free-for-all out there,'' says Nori Sakata, president
of the Sakata Pearl Co. of Tokyo, referring to the competition
between shellers on American rivers. ``It's not just the
Mississippi River. It's the Ohio River and others. They definitely
need restrictions.
   ``The commercial harvesters are over-dredging the rivers. They
don't give the mussel beds a chance for any new growth to occur.
Everybody's trying to get in on it, and they're starting to dredge
smaller rivers. It doesn't do any good for the ecology.''
   Sakata runs the Chicago office of the company, which imports
jewelry and cultured pearls grown at the family oyster farm in
Japan. Founded in 1956, the company began its U.S. operation 25
years ago and had $3.5 million in sales last year.
   ``It think they might need to protect their resources better,''
Sakata says. ``The Persian Oriental Pearl industry is dead because
they didn't protect it. The Persian Gulf used to be a hotbed for
pearls.
   ``If people don't protect their resources, they're going to lose
them.''

<LEADPARA>  In 18th- and 19th-century England, beer sales were governed by the system of
the Tied House and the Free House. A Tied House was a pub owned by a brewery,
which sold only the beer made by its owners. A Free House was a privately
owned pub that purchased ale from a variety of breweries.;   Now, England's
tradition has come to San Jose with the recently opened Tied House Cafe and
Brewery, the third establishment by the same name in the Bay Area. The first
opened in Mountain View in 1987; the second opened earlier this year in
Alameda.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A lunch and a dinner visit to the San Jose Tied House made it clear the
word already is out. It's new. It's popular. It's crowded. But with time, that
will probably level out.;   Although the line to get in seemed long, we were
seated quickly both times. At dinner, the large L-shaped bar and surrounding
area was standing room only. During both visits, the restaurant and outdoor
patio were bustling.;   The lunch and dinner menus are almost identical, with
the exception of marginal price increases for many of the items. There aren't
a lot of different entrees, but the selections go well with the beers that are
brewed on-site.;   Entrees include English-style fish 'n' chips, a sausage,
black bean and rice plate, and beer-mustard chicken breast. There is a wide
selection of appetizers, including shrimp steamed in beer, oyster shooters,
Cajun spice onion rings and blackened catfish strips. The cost of an entree
ranges from $6.50 to $14.95; appetizers range from $1.95 to $6.95.;   To
accompany your meal, you can choose a pale, amber or dark brew. A handful of
specialty brews are listed on blackboards throughout the restaurant. Beers are
available in half-pint and pint sizes or by the pitcher, or you can get the
original triple sampler and taste all three varieties. We sampled all but the
dark brew. And between the pale and the amber, I preferred the rich flavor of
the amber to the somewhat sweet taste of the pale.;   At lunch, my dining
companion and I both selected daily specials instead of ordering from the
standard menu. My companion enjoyed a large piece of yellow-fin tuna with
wasabi and soy sauce, saying it rivaled versions of the dish served at other
well-known downtown restaurants.;   I chose the house sandwich, a turkey and
ham roll-up with sprouts, tomatoes, mustard and mayonnaise. It was made in the
style of a burrito and was quite tasty, although the portion was smaller than
I anticipated. I also ordered a beer cheese appetizer, which our server said
was made from "all of the ends of the various cheeses" and then "mixed with
beer." It was a fine accompaniment to the exceptional brown and white bread.
The cheese was a bit pungent and had its own character, but it's definitely
something to try.;   For our dinner visit, we started out with black bean
nachos with fresh beer salsa, sour cream and jack and cheddar cheese. We were
surprised by a heaping plate of nachos that was more than the two of us could
handle. They were quite good, though neither of us could taste any hint of
beer in the salsa.;   My dining companion had the half slab of smoked barbecue
pork ribs with sweet sauce. They were served with fries and a barbecued red
onion wrapped in foil that was so tender it literally fell apart. The ribs
were very good, the sauce tangy and sweet and the portion more than adequate.;
  I again chose a special: the linguini primavera with a wine butter sauce and
a dinner salad (which does not come with any of the entrees) with bleu cheese
dressing. The dressing was thin and the usual chunks of bleu cheese were
noticeably missing. The linguini didn't compensate. It was bland, appearing
that only butter had been used to give the pasta and an unconventional mix of
vegetables just a hint of flavor. In addition to the expected carrots and
zucchini, the vegetables included a more unusual selection of cabbage, snow
peas and tomatoes. But the dish didn't meet my expectations.;   For desert, we
shared a chocolate mousse. It did little to round out my evening. I expected a
light mild mousse. Instead, I got a thick, dark mousse reminiscent of
chocolate fudge frosting. My companion, however, thought it was great -- but
he loves chocolate for the sake of chocolate.;   Overall, our lunch and dinner
experiences at Tied House were good, but perhaps time will bring a more
consistent quality to both the food and the service.; Tied House Cafe; and

FT  11 SEP 92 / Management: Chewing over the expense account - In the latest
of our series on power lunching around the world, Robert Thompson finds
restraint and excess
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the most powerful of all power lunches, the monthly gathering of the 29
Mitsubishi group heads, the fare is often humble 'curry rice', a
gently-spiced, dun-coloured dish which is also the staple of the average
office worker in a hurry.
The Kinyokai, as the Mitsubishi meal is called, reflects the general
restraint exercised by the Japanese executive at lunchtime, when few deals
are done and the emphasis is on quick and sober consumption.
Such modest daytime habits are a source of frustration for those foreign
competitors who hope that luxury and decadence will undermine the Japanese
work ethic.
But while there may be no wine bottles on the table at lunch, after dark the
picture is very different, for Japanese business people do their best
networking at night. In the evening there will be as much beer, sake and
whisky as the body and expense account can bear.
Relationships will be lubricated in exclusive clubs after dinner guests have
been jollied in the private rooms of traditional-style restaurants. With
important decisions often requiring the approval of more than one executive,
the back rooms allow the company the space to seat all who must reach a
consensus.
The real entertaining - not the novelty sampler presented to most visitors -
tends to be aimed at servicing already-established links and making a
contact aware of an impending deal. Indeed, the deal could even be done with
a knowing nod between courses.
However, there are some signs that the current lavish entertaining could be
under threat. These are supposed to be tough times for executives who are
taking ritual salary cuts to express their grief for plunging profits.
Dai-Ichi Kangyo, Japan's largest bank, announced recently that directors
would take a 5 per cent drop in pay, but an unkinder cut was the 20 per cent
reduction in the entertainment budget.
For a top manager in Japan, a chauffeur and fat expense account have always
been the expected rewards for 35 years of dutiful service, particularly
given that many executive salaries are, by western standards, modest. But
now, if the anecdotes of bar owners are to be believed, instead of drinking
at two or three different clubs in an evening, managers are restricting
themselves to just one venue.
Back at the Mitsubishi lunch table, even in the bleakest times the group's
presidents could probably have champagne with their curry if they demanded
it. But they appear genuinely more content with a cup of green tea or a weak
coffee.
A secretary charged with arranging the Mitsubishi lunches explains that the
food is supposed to be consumed within 30 minutes, giving the executives
about an hour to divide up the world's riches. But if participants are to be
believed, the talk is as innocuous as the menu, for they say they are more
likely to listen to a lecture or discuss the use of the Mitsubishi logo than
corner markets or create cartels.
Says the secretary: 'They don't like me to order food that's difficult for
them to chew. They generally prefer something warm. They may have a bowl of
noodles or rice with raw fish or sandwiches.'
In most Japanese offices on most days, the lunch of champions comes in a
lacquered box with quaint little compartments. The centrepiece of this boxed
lunch, called an obento, could be strips of eel, sushi or a rissole, livened
with shredded cabbage, pickled vegetables, a slice of a sweetish omelette,
rice and a small pile of cold spaghetti.
If a meeting is destined to drift into lunchtime, a Tokyo obento specialist
such as Yumeya or Hisago would be called, and the lacquered boxes delivered
on the back of a motorcycle. For guests, perhaps Y2,500 (Pounds 10) would be
the appropriate amount to spend, while the desk-bound worker ordering his or
her own would probably opt for a cheaper version with more rice and less
substance.
Takashi Taniguchi, manager of the Yamamaru restaurant, a favourite among
business people who eat out, offers set lunches ranging from Y1,200 to
Y3,500.
He says one consequence of economic downturn is that bills are being split,
reflecting the supposedly lower ceilings on expense accounts.
The National Tax Agency reported that expense account claims last year rose
a record 13 per cent. The agency's report early next year will prove the
best guide to the success or otherwise of the cost-cutting campaign on the
feverish evening entertaining that companies feel is necessary for the
cementing of long-term business relationships.

   Dry beer is becoming a big hit across the United
States, although most drinkers still have no idea what it is or what
it tastes like.
   That may be one reason the distinct new beer has become so
popular.
   ``The curiosity level is unbelievable,'' said Bob Goughenour, a
group brand executive at Anheuser-Busch Inc. who helped bring dry
beer to American supermarkets and taverns.
   So, be prepared.
   The cacophonous vendors at the stadium may soon begin asking,
``How's about a nice dry one.'' Your neighbor may invite you over
for something dry to drink.
   It's been a year since Anheuser-Busch introduced Michelob Dry in
this country, and the brand has been so successful _ at one point,
the brewer couldn't make it fast enough to keep up with sales _ the
company earlier this year introduced a dry version of Budweiser, the
world's best-selling beer.
   Bud Dry should be available nationally by the end of the year,
said Goughenour.
   ``We're just delighted with dry beer. Our volumes are more than
twice what we expected. It's just been incredible,'' he said.
   Dry beer is brewed to produce a less-sweet taste that doesn't
linger. It's made with a process that converts more of the malt and
rice into fermentable sugars which interact more efficiently with
the yeast.
   The beer contains less sugar than regular beer, fewer calories
and no aftertaste, which probably is its most noticeable difference.
   Bud Dry's advertising slogan is ``Comes on Strong, Then It's
Gone.''
   Last year, about 500,000 to 600,000 barrels of dry beer were sold
in the United States, said Frank Walters, director of research for
IMPACT magazine, a New York-based trade publication for the
alcoholic beverage industry.
   This year, Walters expects sales of about 2.5 million barrels.
Next year he said the amount should climb to 6 million barrels.
Annual sales of beer in the United States total about 188 million
barrels.
   ``It's still very early to say, but we expect by the end of this
century dry beer should be at about 20 million barrels,'' Walters
said. ``But this category is so new that that could all change in
the next hour.''
   One big question remains about dry beer: Is it just a fad?
   ``It's honestly too early to tell,'' said Robert Weinberg, an
industry consultant and professor of marketing management at
Washington University in St. Louis. ``I think it may be more than a
fad because it looks like this is a very pleasing product to young
women.''
   Weinberg said several female students have told him they like
Michelob Dry because it's the only beer that doesn't make them feel
like they smell ``like a brewery.''
   The female market has been something brewers have hungrily eyed
for decades, Weinberg said, and if dry beer opens the door to that
market, it will prove much more than a fad.
   Odds that a beer drinker will be male are about two-to-one,
Weinberg said.
   At the country's second largest brewery, Miller Brewing Co.,
officials are carefully watching the growth of dry beer, but remain
unconvinced that the category will be around for a long time.
   ``Our research shows that these products do not offer any
significant benefit or appeal to mainstream beer drinkers,'' said
Miller spokeswoman Susan Henderson.
   She said Miller, based in Milwaukee, has no plans to plunge into
the dry beer fray.
   Nineteen imported and domestic dry beers are currently sold
around the country including Canadian, Japanese and European brands.
   G. Heileman Brewing Co., of Lacrosse, Wis., sells five different
dry beers on a regional basis including Rainier Special Dry in the
Northwest and I.C. Special Dry in Pennsylvania.
   Earlier this month, the company, which is a collection of
regional breweries, introduced Lone Star Dry in Texas, said
spokesman Bill Eiler.
   ``We see a real strong future in dry beer. We think it's here to
stay,'' Eiler said.
   Although it's just started to catch the public's fancy, dry beer
is not new.
   Regional beers in the 1950s and '60s, such as Rheingold and Stag
Pale Dry, were touted for dry taste, but they never caused a big a
stir in the industry like the current craze, which got started about
two years ago in Japan.
   Asahi Breweries Ltd. of Toyko introduced a dry brand that started
the sensation and prompted all of Japan's major brewers to scramble
to concoct their own dry brands.
   Now, the category has captured 20 percent to 30 percent of the
Japanese beer market, industry analysts say.
   Goughenour was sent to Japan by Anheuser-Busch to investigate the
skyrocketing dry beer sales and see if the company should get into
the category.
   He came back perplexed.
   ``I couldn't figure out how this could be applied in this
country. That was the question mark,'' he said. ``When we first
started, nobody knew what we were talking about. Americans know dry
wine. They know dry martinis and dry cleaning, but they really don't
know what dry is.''
   In Japan, consumers know what dry is because dry sake is a staple
beverage, so dry beer is kind of a logical extension for them,
Goughenour said.
   But in the United States, the concept of ``dry'' is elusive.
   That's why Goughenour spent a lot of time asking U.S. beer
drinkers to define the meaning of ``dry'' as they thought it might
apply to beer.
   ``We got consumers to tell us what dry is and then we made
something with a brand new, refreshing, smooth taste,'' he said.
``They told us what to make.''

FT  16 OCT 93 / Japan ready to end ban on rice imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO, FRANCES WILLIAMS and DAVID DODWELL

<TEXT>
JAPAN has informally floated a proposal to lift its ban on rice imports
after a six-year moratorium period to 1999, according to trade negotiators
in Tokyo and Geneva.
In a second initiative late yesterday in Geneva, Japan is also offering to
harmonise at low levels its tariffs on non-ferrous metals, and cut by at
least 50 per cent its tariff peaks on a further 150 textile items.
A US trade negotiator described the initiative, unveiled during a full
meeting of Uruguay round participants aimed at taking stock of progress in
negotiations, as 'an additional concrete step' towards successful completion
of the Uruguay round of world trade talks.
The rice proposal, which was made unofficially during intensive bilateral
discussions on reform of farm trade with the US in Geneva, will only be
presented formally once the US and the EC settle differences on farm
subsidies and market access for agriculture products, an official said.
Under the plan, Japan will accept tarification of rice after a six-year
grace period, during which a minimum access level of at least 5 per cent of
its domestic rice consumption will be imported, an official said.
Mr Joe O'Mara, special US trade negotiator for agriculture, said in Geneva
that the two sides were trying to conclude the talks by November 1, ahead of
the December 15 deadline to complete the Uruguay Round negotiations.
Formal headway may yet be frustrated by the refusal of the EC so far to
enter any negotiations on opening its market to more farm imports.
This is largely due to French efforts to review a US-EC agreement on
Europe's subsidised farm exports, and even to withdraw the farm sector from
the Uruguay Round agenda.
News of progress towards a compromise on ending Japan's ban on rice imports
is likely to isolate France on the issue of farm trade, and put fresh
pressure on the EC to negotiate tariff cuts in the sector.
Negotiators in Geneva were quick to note yesterday that France's domestic
problems in selling a farm package were no greater than those of the
Japanese government; if Japan compromises on rice imports for the sake of a
wider agreement, pressure would increase on France to do the same.
A trade negotiator in Geneva said the Japanese initiative on non-ferrous
metals amounted to 'one more area where the rest of the Quad (which groups
the US, Japan, Canada and the EC) are in agreement, and the EC stands in the
way of a package.' Both Canada and the US want tariffs on non-ferrous metals
entirely eliminated.
The welcome for Japan's initiatives was not extended to a new EC market
access package ready to be tabled next week. This proposes adding toys and
vegetable oils to the list of items on which tariffs will be cut to zero,
and cuts average tariffs by about 33 per cent, against a previous offer of
some 23 per cent. One US official, noting that the current US offer achieved
cuts averaging 38-42 per cent, said the EC offer 'hardly passes the laugh
test'.
Meanwhile, in Tokyo, news of the Japanese rice proposal yesterday caused
embarrassment for Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, and his
government, which was quick to deny reports of a tarification accord.
Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, reiterated that Japan had no
intention of subjecting rice to the tarification scheme proposed by the
Gatt.
Meanwhile leaders of the Socialist party, the largest in Mr Hosokawa's
coalition, who staunchly oppose the opening of the rice market, threatened
to pull the party out of the coalition if the cabinet accepted tarification.

ART DECO CLASHES WITH THE ORIENT AT HEALTH FOOD-ORIENTED HIBACHI

<TEXT>
<P>
I imagine that, back in 1939, officers of the Ventura County Mutual Fire
Insurance Co., going about their staid business, would have been shocked if
they could have looked into the future and seen people happily eating meals of
exotic origin right inside their room-sized vault.
</P>
<P>
I was surprised to find Hibachi restaurant in this location. Having eaten many
times at Hibachi in Santa Barbara, I expected the newer Ventura version to be a
similar vine-covered oasis where you order tropical cuisine at the counter and
eat on a lush, breezy patio.
</P>
<P>
Instead the restaurant is in a historic Art Deco building with stately green
awnings. It looks more like an old-fashioned supper club than a Hawaiian
restaurant. Another surprise: Although the outside is classic '30s
architecture, the inside is all Japanese wood, shoji screens and vivid Gauguin
prints.
</P>
<P>
Despite the look of the restaurant, the food is priced to fit most family
budgets. It suggests good health-food fare with an Asian spin. The menu has a
little Chinese, a lot of Japanese, some Korean and some American influences. In
fact, Hibachi is pretty typical of the kind of food you can find in a Hawaiian
fast-food restaurant -- except that it isn't as greasy and doesn't use as much
pork.
</P>
<P>
Among the starters, bite-sized clams with fresh green onions had a nice, spicy
kick to them. We tried a variety of dim sum, including mui pan -- barbecued
pork engulfed in a fist-sized sweet bun. It was like a muffin run amok.
</P>
<P>
I like my comfort foods less blatant, so I had the sui mai: bite-sized shrimp,
chicken or pork wrapped in dough and steamed. They are dipped in a light, tangy
soy-based sauce, which creates a perfect combination of sweet and salt, meat
and dough.
</P>
<P>
My son loved the gyoza, which had a vegetable filling with a slight taste of
cabbage. He ordered them for his appetizer and reordered them for his dinner.
</P>
<P>
The egg roll had a fine, crispy crust and a startlingly mushy filling. I was
just trying to decide what to make of it, when my friend told me that no
genuine food critic could possibly like it; he, however, liked it very much.
</P>
<P>
Hibachi gets pretty creative with its soups. Miso soup had tofu, finely grated
carrots and sliced red and green onions. There was a nice, light broccoli soup
and a delicious seafood chowder, filled with chunks of potato and fish; it had
a slight, wonderful buttery flavor.
</P>
<P>
The simpler the dinner here, the better I liked it. Chicken, fish or steak was
offered marinated in teriyaki and broiled. The chicken was the best -- moist
and crisp. I tried the mahi-mahi and remembered once I tasted it that I'm
always disappointed by mahi-mahi. I think I get suckered because I like the
sound of the name.
</P>
<P>
For bigger appetites -- and I mean big -- the stir fry and curry dishes were
filled with fresh vegetables and generous amounts of fish or meat. The chewy,
slightly sweet brown rice was much better than the white, and worth the extra
25 cents.
</P>
<P>
The workers at the old fire insurance company might be surprised to find
Hibachi here -- but I expect that they'd also be pleased.

FT  23 MAY 94 / Working Life: Echikatsu - a quiet oasis in downtown Tokyo /
Eating Out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A compensation of doing business in Tokyo is the thrill of discovering the
many green oases hidden between the sprawl of office blocks.
One of the nicest of these is Echikatsu, a cottage restaurant endowed with a
water garden, in Kanda, downtown Tokyo, only 15 minutes taxi ride (Y960)
from the Otemachi business district.
As you pass Echikatsu's wooden gate and cross its cobbled courtyard, the
sound of traffic recedes and peace descends. A kimono-clad waitress ushers
you to your private tatami-mat room, thoughtfully adapted for westerners by
the addition of a leg pit under the table. Sliding paper doors open on to a
gurgling brook stocked with carp, and lined with candle-lit stone lanterns
and bamboo. Tokyo seems miles away.
Echikatsu's specialty is shabu-shabu (rough translation: slosh slosh) or
beef teriyaki. They both feature thin-sliced beef and vegetables cooked at
the table. Even unadventurous foreigners have been known to like these and
Echikatsu will equally please a Japanese guest.
The food is excellent, copious, and healthy. But steer clear of the wine
list. As in many Tokyo restaurants, it is limited and expensive. I paid
Y3,500 for a bottle of Piat d'Or, one of the only two white wines on offer.
Stick to sake (rice wine) or beer. In any case, Japanese food was never
meant to mix with French wine. Shabu-shabu for two, plus wine, came to just
over Y25,000 (Dollars 240), reasonable for a restaurant of this class.
Echikatsu is suitable for serious business discussion in small groups. It is
upmarket, private, quiet and there is lots of room to spread papers around
on the tatami floor. The service is unobtrusively attentive. Equally, its
charm makes Echikatsu good for romance.
Ask your hotel or secretary to book a room facing the garden and to get
Echikatsu to fax you a map. It is well known, but Tokyo taxi drivers are
terrible navigators.
Echikatsu is open from 5pm to 9.30pm. Bookings only. No English spoken. It
accepts leading credit cards. Phone 3811-5293.

FT  23 JUL 92 / Tokyo shares pulled down by debt fears

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tokyo stock market fell yesterday to its lowest level since April 1986,
as doubts spread about the health of the economy following release of a
gloomy Bank of Japan quarterly forecast.
The Nikkei stock average slipped 2.9 per cent to close at 15,541.95. Prices
continued to fall early today, with the Nikkei down more than 150 points in
initial trading.
The Bank of Japan said yesterday that it was closely watching the
restructuring of troubled non-bank financial institutions, whose
difficulties have been heightened by the renewed weakness of Tokyo stock
prices.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, said the financial system was
secure in spite of difficulties facing non-bank lending institutions, which
fuelled the stock and property price spiral of the late 1980s, but now have
fast accumulating bad debts.
He said non-banks and other institutions should not necessarily support all
of their troubled borrowers, and suggested that financial institutions
restructuring their operations should maker further changes to ensure their
profitability.
Mr Mieno's comments made clear the central bank has revised its outlook on
the economy, and that a recovery expected in the autumn will come later. He
pointed to decelerating consumer demand as an important reason for delays in
adjustment of inventories. Concerned that the stock market decline could
prompt further falls in the next few days, Mr Sakae Kudo, chairman of the
Japan Securities Dealers' Association, said the market correction must be
close to completion.
But Mr Sakae said stock prices were being weighed down by concerns about the
domestic economy and suggested the Bank of Japan reduce the official
discount rate from the present 3.75 per cent.
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is growing in confidence that it
will win a larger than generally predicted share of seats contested in an
election on Sunday for half the upper house of parliament.
Opposition parties admitted their campaigns had been flawed. Polls suggest
the LDP could take about 70 of the 127 seats, instead of the 60 or fewer
seats forecast when the campaign began. If so, the party and two coalition
partners, Komeito and the Democratic Socialist Party, will consolidate their
control over the upper house.

FT  09 OCT 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Sleeping diner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From TAKURO HOSHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As a businessman, I have encountered several times the embarrassing
situation of a sleeping diner. I myself pinch my thigh under the table to
deal with this peculiar syndrome (rather common among Japanese businessman
especially when abroad).
For the sake of fairness, I must point out I have noticed on a few
occasions, Europeans drowsing in restaurants in Tokyo.
The Solution is 'OSHIBORI' (literal meaning is 'a squeezed').
Perhaps you know what it is as you have surely visited a Japanese
restaurant. But just for good order's sake, it is a wet hand towel served
when we are seated at the table, just to clean hands. I don't know any
restaurants in Europe which never served this Oshibori.
Quality of towel: Thick, soft and and right size.
Moisture content: Not too wet, nor too dry.
Cleanliness: To say nothing of, but must be always almost new, so usually
white towel if
needed to demonstrate cleanliness.
Presentation: Like serviette folding, how 'squeezed', and usually on the
right small tray - (bamboo, knitted basket. etc)
Scent:Trace of fragrance everyone can accept.
Temperature: In hot summer, straight from fridge, and in winter, steaming
hot.
So now what I want to suggest, is that waiting staff smartly approach with
(cold) Oshibori to ask the sleepy diner if he cares to use Oshibori.

A top Japanese businessman received a suspended jail sentence and heavy fine
Tuesday for his role in the 1988 Recruit corruption scandal, which brought down
the government and sparked fierce debate about political fund raising.
</P>
<P>
But political analysts said the verdict will have little impact in reforming
the nation's money-oriented political system.
</P>
<P>
Hisashi Shinto, former chairman of telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph
&amp; Telephone Corp., was handed a two-year jail term suspended for three
years and fined $170,000 by presiding judge Takeshi Toyota for his part in the
Recruit shares-for-favors scandal.
</P>
<P>
Shinto, 80, was found guilty of illegally receiving 10,000 unlisted shares of a
subsidiary of communications conglomerate Recruit Co. He made a handsome
personal profit when the shares were listed.
</P>
<P>
In return, Shinto made Nippon Telegraph services available to Recruit.
</P>
<P>
The 1988 scandal, in which Recruit was found to have distributed more than $11
million to politicians, business leaders and ministry officials -- in the form
of unlisted shares, cash contributions and purchases of tickets for
fund-raising parties -- led to the resignation of Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita and several of his cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Neither Takeshita nor another former prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, were
charged, although Nakasone admitted that his aides received 29,000 shares, and
Takeshita too said his secretaries had received large amount of stocks and
other favors.
</P>
<P>
Eleven other people, including two politicians, are still on trial in the
affair.
</P>
<P>
"The verdict (against Shinto) indicates that tough penalties are likely to be
brought against other defendants," said political commentator Makoto Sakata.
</P>
<P>
But Sakata, who specializes in ties between Japan's companies and politicians,
said the overall political scene and politicians will never change.
</P>
<P>
The Recruit affair overshadowed the 1976 Lockheed scandal, in which politicians
were suspected of taking bribes in return for awarding lucrative contracts to
the U.S. aircraft maker.

<HEAD>Fujitsu Tries To Withdraw Another One-Yen Bid</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Just days after Fujitsu Ltd. failed in its attempt
to escape a contract for which it bid 1 yen, or about 0.7 of a U.S.
cent, the Japanese computer giant said it was trying to withdraw
from another 1-yen deal it says lacks ``common sense.''
   Akira Imagawa, a spokesman at Fujitsu's headquarters in Tokyo,
said Wednesday that company officials in the Nagano prefecture in
central Japan had asked local authorities to cancel a contract the
company won last month with a 1-yen bid.
   Both cases have attracted the attention of Japan's Fair Trade
Commission, whose officials say they are considering an
investigation into whether the unusually low bids constitute unfair
trade under the Anti-Monopoly Law.
   In the Nagano deal, Fujitu and electronics giant NEC Corp. made
identical 1-yen bids for a contract to design software for the
prefectural libary's computer system, local officials said.
   The prefectural government had set aside 16 million yen, or
about $112,000, in its budget for the project, the officials said
on condition of anonymity.
   ``Front-line salesmen desperately wanted to win the contract ...
but lacked common sense,'' Imagawa said.
   In the earlier case, Fujitsu officials said their 1-yen bid to
design software to map the Hiroshima city water supply system
represented a long-term investment. But later they appeared to
change their minds and asked the city to cancel the contract. The
city had budgeted $78,000 for the project.
   City officials refused, although they said their decision would
depend on the outcome of a possible Fair Trade Commission
investigation.
   ``We will continue to seek the city's understanding to retract
the contract,'' Fujitsu's Imagawa said.
   Meanwhile, officials of the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry cautioned Fujitsu on Tuesday about business practices that
were ``beyond common sense,'' said an official of the ministry's
Electronics Policy Division.
   The official, who spoke anonymously, said the ministry also
urged major member companies in the Japan Electronics Industry
Development Associaton, a industrial grouping of computer and
electronics makers, ``not to make discount sales at irrational
prices.''
   Companies competing for both the Hiroshima and the Nagano
contracts reportedly saw the projects as a way to get a head start
on computer systems expected to be linked up throughout the country.
   But Makoto Sakata, a noted commentator, said the cases also
demonstrated that corporate ethics lag behind generally accepted
rules of behavior, with companies emphasizing their relations with
local officials rather than profitability.
   ``Looking at what Japan's leading high-technology companies like
Fujitsu and NEC are doing, It's painfully clear that modernaization
of Japanese corporations is superficial and that they in fact
remain unchanged from the feudal age,'' Sakata said.

   Just days after Fujitsu Ltd. failed in its attempt
to escape a contract for which it bid 1 yen, or about 0.7 of a U.S.
cent, the Japanese computer giant said Wednesday it was trying to
withdraw from another 1-yen deal it says lacks ``common sense.''
   Akira Imagawa, a spokesman at Fujitsu's headquarters in Tokyo,
said company officials in the Nagano prefecture in central Japan
had asked Nagano authorities to cancel a contract the company won
last month with a 1-yen bid.
   Both cases have attracted the attention of Japan's Fair Trade
Commission, whose officials say they are considering an
investigation into whether the unusually low bids constitute unfair
trade under the Anti-Monopoly Law.
   In the Nagano deal, Fujitu and electronics giant NEC Corp. made
identical 1-yen bids for a contract to design software for the
prefectural libary's computer system, local officials said.
   The prefectural government had set aside 16 million yen, or
about $112,000, in its budget for the project, the officials said
on condition of anonymity.
   ``Front-line salesmen desperately wanted to win the contract ...
but lacked common sense,'' Imagawa said.
   In the earlier case, Fujitsu officials, having said their 1-yen
bid to design software to map the Hiroshima city water supply
system represented a long-term investment, later appeared to change
their minds and asked the city to cancel the contract. The city had
budgeted 11 million yen, or $78,000, for the project.
   City officials refused, although they said their decision would
depend on the outcome of a possible Fair Trade Commission
investigation.
   ``We will continue to seek the city's understanding to retract

FT  26 APR 94 / Pride and disbelief in Ueda city: Hata's home town prays and
parades for its famous son
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The two warriors, one in scarlet the other in black, began the incantation.
Kneeling with ankles splayed, the prayers were to summon a power from the
universe capable of making one man overcome his fears and 1,000 men.
Yesterday's invocations were more than pertinent. They were uttered for Mr
Tsutomu Hata outside his headquarters in his home base of Ueda, moments
after he was elected Japan's prime minister.
Ueda, which lies at the foot of the Japanese Alps, yesterday prayed its
local hero would be able to cope with the machinations of the capital's
treacherous faction politics.
Mr Hata, elected nine times over 25 years, is hugely popular but some fear
he is not tough enough.
'He may be just too generous and the danger is he just might not last that
long,' said Mrs Suigetsu Imai.
Ueda is anxious to bask in Mr Hata's glory for as long as possible. He is
the most famous man to come from the city.
Not that he has much competition. Ueda, ignored by almost all travel guides,
has only once previously troubled the footnotes of history.
During the sixteenth century one of its lords, Yukimura Sanada, twice beat
forces of the celebrated Shogun, Tokugawa Ieyasu, before he was defeated and
killed.
'This is the most important day in Ueda city's history,' said Mr Hideji
Ohara, director of planning at Organ Needles, a sewing machine manufacturer.
Mr Kenzo Hori, chairman of the chamber of industry and commerce, proclaimed:
'We have not had a prime minister from Ueda city in 2,500 years, and we
probably won't have another for another 2,500 years. Mr Hata's achievement
is a once in 5,000 years triumph.'
Ueda celebrated his triumph in style. The city hall organised the first
lantern parade since the Sino-Japanese war of the 1930s. More than 5,000 red
and white lanterns were distributed, to be carried along streets festooned
with flags and posters of Mr Hata.
Bands played Sousa marches to compete with loud-speaker systems broadcasting
Wagnerian fanfares. Overhead, fireworks lit the sky and below, on the
streets, drums were beaten, free sake poured, and the crowd orchestrated
into celebratory shouts of 'banzai'.
In spite of Ueda's pride at Mr Hata's achievement, there was also disbelief.
Mr Takeshi Murata, a 59-year old shoe retailer, explained: 'I was in the
same grade as Hata at primary and secondary school, and right after the war
as kids we used to fence together on the streets, pretending to be samurai.
Never in the world would I have guessed he would become prime minister. He
didn't even seem that talented.' Many in the crowd were also concerned
whether Mr Hata would be able to deal with the pressing problems of the day:
tax reform, North Korea and the trade surplus with the US.
Mr Yoshiki Sunohara, a local cosmetics retailer, was convinced Mr Hata would
surprise the Tokyo-based politicians. 'He's a new kind of prime minister,'
he said. 'Despite his appearance he's really stubborn and has a strong will
and that's reflected in his politics. This aspect of his behaviour just
hasn't been appreciated by the media in Tokyo.'
Mr Hata's main strengths are his direct style and apparent honesty. Mr
Kenichiro Hata, the prime minister's cousin and first secretary, explained:
'During the 25 years Tsutomu has been in politics he's developed a style of
explaining politics in terms that ordinary people can understand. He's been
through hardship, failed exams and even been a bus conductor, so unlike his
predecessor he can understand the concerns of the common people. With their
support he can succeed.'
Although local businessmen yesterday queued outside his headquarters to sign
the congratulatory visitors' book and sip sake ladled from a specially
cracked cask made of Japanese cypress, none admitted expecting special
advantages following Mr Hata's election.
The huge kettles of tea, King Edward panatellas, and rice, tainted pink by
cherries, would last one day and then be gone, said one.
But in spite of his reputation, Mr Hata faces a difficult task persuading
Japan that politicians can be honest. Even some locals remain unconvinced.
Ms Sayuri Tobo, a secondary school student, said: 'In general, politicians
are not honest. And I think he is the same as the others. Something will be
revealed about him one day.'
Faced with a public disillusioned by politics and the convoluted challenges
of Diet politics, Mr Hata can only benefit from further invocations to
strengthen his resolve and overcome his fellow parliamentarians.

At the New Otani Hotel and Garden in Los Angeles, displaced residents of Tokyo
find the comforts of home in a breakfast of traditional Japanese foods selected
as much for their variety, shape and color as for their taste. A menu of rice,
pickles, fruit, tea and a source of protein -- usually eggs, fish, chicken or
tofu -- is standard. Some restaurant variations include braised vegetables and
baked eggs.
</P>
<P>
There are two main course choices on the Japanese breakfast menu at the hotel's
A Thousand Cranes Restaurant. Here, either piping hot rice porridge (asa-kayu)
or grilled salted fish are accompanied by a tofu square topped with finely
sliced bonito, grated ginger and sliced green onion; vinegar-pickled
vegetables, including purple pickles, daikon radish and Chinese cabbage; miso
soup, made from a salty, fermented soy bean paste; mixed fresh fruit; a bowl of
pearly steamed rice and green tea.
</P>
<P>
For the fish, coarse salt is sprinkled over a whole trout, mackerel, salmon or
swordfish. The fish is skewered to retain its shape, then grilled over very hot
charcoals or broiled. A dipping sauce brings out its subtle flavor. In some
restaurants, cod marinated in a mixture of sake, soy sauce and mirin is served
in place of the salted fish. Lemon wedges are served on the side. The porridge
is surprisingly sweet, often made from leftover rice, occasionally mixed with
red beans.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese interest in a perfect presentation is obvious in chef Nobuo Saga's
garnishes: paper-thin slices of rolled bright-yellow omelet -- an
egg-and-green-onion mixture fried in rectangular skillets, then rolled with a
bamboo mat and cut into slivers. A sprig of green, dried flakes of shaved
bonito (dashi), orange slices or a mound of shredded vegetables are some other
common garnishes for the Otani's morning meal.
</P>
<P>
To make the crepe-like omelet at home, use an ordinary omelet pan and trim the
edges. Adding peas to the egg mixture, as in this recipe from "Step By Step
Japanese Cooking" (Barron's, 1986) by Lesley Downer and Minoru Yoneda, lends
color and extra flavor to the dish.
</P>
<P>
 A Thousand Cranes Restaurant, New Otani Hotel &amp; Garden, 120 S. Los Angeles
St., Los Angeles, (213) 629-1200. Open daily for breakfast from 6:30 to 10
a.m.; dinner from 6 to 10 p.m. Lunch served Monday through Saturday from 11:30
a.m. to 2 p.m. Touch of Japan brunch served Sunday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

so egg mixture forms even layer. When egg is set, tilt pan and roll top of
omelet toward you to form roll at front of pan. Push roll toward back of pan.
</P>
<P>
Brush pan with oil and pour small amount egg mixture into pan, lifting roll to
allow egg mixture to flow underneath. Allow egg mixture to set, then repeat
tilting pan and rolling omelet toward you until all egg mixture is used and
thick roll is produced at end of pan. Place bamboo rolling mat over omelet and
remove omelet from pan. Or, use slotted spatula. Roll omelet in bamboo mat,
press gently and let stand 1 minute.
</P>

FT  13 JUL 92 / Survey of Japan (11): Downturn begins to bite - The Labour
Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE day starts early in Tokyo's day labourer district. By dawn most of the
men, many of whom had slept outside in blankets and cardboard, hang around
the day labourer market - a block where the recruiters wait around with
their minivans.
However, times are hard for the labourers of the Sanya district in east
Tokyo. While the average Japanese office worker has yet to feel the direct
effects of the recent downturn in the economy, the labourers, usually
working on construction sites and small factories, are one of the first
groups to face the slump in the real estate market and decline in capital
investment by companies.
'It's a recession,' says one labourer waiting for the tehaishi, day job
recruiter, to pick him up. 'I'm lucky because I have connections. You can't
find jobs without connections these days,' he adds. He is one of 8,000
workers in the district, the second largest day labourer area following
Osaka's Nishinari district. The men sleep in the doya, cheap hotels and
apartments, or outside on the streets if they cannot afford Y1,000 for the
night.
At about 6.15 am those who have not been so lucky in finding work for the
day, head off to the employment centre, run by the municipal government, a
grey concrete building where day jobs are posted from 6.30 am.
Waiting for the shutter of the centre to open, the workers, mostly men in
their 50s, wait around with cigarettes in hand, and their belongings in
paper bags by their sides. 'I couldn't pay the rent for three months, so I
just ran away,' says one man to his friend. 'There are three good jobs in
Tokyo, and one in Sendai,' shouts another.
Once the shutter opens, the men crowd into the centre, which resembles an
empty parking lot. The workers look intently at the job offers posted on the
walls. However, the number is limited and only a handful of applicants are
accepted. The daily average number of jobs at the three employment centres
in Sanya fell 16 per cent in the last fiscal year to March, to 554.
For those who have given up looking for work, the day begins with glasses of
beer or sake at one of the many sake stands. Some stand around a meal van
eating curry with rice for Y120, a fraction of the price for a businessman's
meal in Tokyo.
The heady days of the late 1980s and the acute labour shortage created high
demand for the day labourers, increasing daily wages to as high as Y13,000
for clearing and digging land. The increase in pay gave rise to business
hotels where workers upgraded their boarding facilities from a badly lit
room with six bunks to fully air conditioned rooms with television sets,
costing as much as Y4,100 a night.
However, the lack of jobs has pulled down wages, and for an increasing
number of workers, even the cheaper hotels are too expensive. 'Of the 200
hotels for day workers, only 50 per cent of the rooms are being utilised,'
says Mr Kouichi Sato, manager at Jouhoku Welfare Centre, a government run
counselling and aid centre in the Sanya district.
By 8.00 am, the early morning buzz is over, and blue-suited office workers
start their journey to offices surrounding Sanya. The lives of the middle
class around the area, are rarely affected by the outcast day workers.
During the day, the Sanya area becomes quiet, with a few of those who could
not find work sleeping on the streets. Some of the labourers say they are
turned off by the poor terms of the recruiters who are often connected with
the yakuza, or gangsters.
'I'd rather be out on the streets than work for the yakuza,' says one worker
who chose to spend the day at the welfare centre. He complains that the an
increasing number of employers try to exploit the labourers by charging
unrealistic prices for meals, cigarettes, and tissue paper consumed during
the day. With such expenses deducted, 'by the end of the day, you end up
being paid around Y4,000 although the promised amount is over Y10,000,' he
adds.
Mr Sato at Jouhoku says the number of labourers asking for aid or
counselling has risen in the past year. 'The number rose over 3,000 last
January for the first time in eight years,' says Mr Sato. Last fiscal year
to March, the number of workers seeking help concerning food rose by 64 per
cent, while those in need for board rose by 30 per cent.
'You're drinking, aren't you,' says a welfare worker sternly to a
middle-aged straggly-haired man waiting for counselling. A high percentage
of the Sanya dwellers are alcoholics, and many are in poor health due to
malnutrition. 'Get your free health inspection,' urges a flier distributed
by the welfare centre, listing the symptoms of tuberculosis.
The demographic changes under way in Japan are apparent in Sanya. While most
of the men look older than they actual are, due to the harsh manual labour,
the average age of the labourers is rapidly rising. In Sanya, some 60 per
cent of the residents are over 50 years old, while the same age group
constitutes only 30 per cent of the whole of Tokyo.
Another problem for the labourers is the increase in foreign illegal
workers. Employers prefer to hire younger foreign labourers at cheaper
prices. Mr Sato was concerned over the increasing number of Japanese
labourers losing jobs to such foreigners. 'The rise in tensions could lead
to riots,' he adds.
By sunset, most of the workers are back from their jobs. After retrieving
their bags containing their belongings from the coin lockers, some head for
the public baths. By 9.00 pm, the streets are quiet again, as the labourers
of Sanya prepare themselves for another early morning ahead.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan faces a grim task that may prove more vexing
than flooding the world with cars or cracking the computer chip
market: having a good time.
   Although older Japanese cling to the work ethic that rocketed
this country from World War II devastation to economic superpower
status, their children have decided all work and no play made Japan
a dull nation.
   Shoko Shima, 31, works 45 hours a week as a translator, about
average for the Japanese.
   But she also takes time to work out regularly at a health club
and play tennis and golf. ``People used to work for work's sake or
their family's sake. But now many of us work to have free time,''
Ms. Shima said.
   ``More and more young people are choosing part-time jobs so they
can work when they want instead of being tied to a big company.''
   In some ways, Japan today is a nation bent on enjoying itself:
the number of official holidays surpasses that of the United States,
and young people's vision of the future does not include working
grueling hours and blind loyalty to a company.
   ``Many people today say their hobby is work, and the older ones
especially say it with a sense of pride,'' said Sumiko Iwao, a
psychologist who teaches at Tokyo's Keio University. ``But younger
people today are saying `No, that's not my cup of tea.' ''
   ``In the future, productivity will decline, but that's not bad
because it is much better for Japanese to enjoy life and relax than
just work all the time,'' Ms. Iwao said.
   But the old ways continue, especially in the highly charged
business world.
   ``If you want to succeed in business in Japan, you still have to
work from 9 to 9,'' Ms. Shima said.
   The average Japanese worked 2,150 hours in 1986 _ about 225 hours
more than Americans and almost 500 more than West Germans, according
to Labor Ministry statistics. In 1987, the Japanese figure edged up
by 18 hours.
   The government embraced the idea of a five-day workweek in 1985,
partly to reduce big trade surpluses. More leisure time, the theory
goes, would equal increased spending on imports, an expansion of
recreational industry, more domestic spending.
   But no one said it would be easy.
   Office worker Kayoko Kumagai, 41, divides her free time between
household chores, bowling and working out at her health club. But
her 37-year-old husband, a company worker, ``just lies around the
house'' on his one day off a week, she said.
   Like most Japanese, Kumagai has grown used to working six days a
week with only Sundays off.
   ``Not many people realize they are working too much. They take it
for granted,'' said Mrs. Kumagai. She counts her husband among them,
and added, ``My husband wouldn't be able to figure out what to do if
he had weekends off.''
   When the government announced plans to give about 58 percent of
public servants two Saturdays off a month, people complained they
could no longer pay taxes, apply for travel visas or visit the
national library every Saturday. The so-called ``twin holidays''
went into effect Jan. 14.
   Financial institutions went to a five-day workweek Feb. 1, and
the government hopes other businesses will follow suit. It has
targeted 1993 for a uniform five-day workweek.
   Meanwhile, Japan is creating more leisure time by expanding the
number of official holidays from 12 in 1988 to 13 this year, well
ahead of the 10 holidays a year enjoyed by some Americans.
   ``The Japanese find `vacant time' excruciatingly difficult, and
come nowhere near enjoying its advantages,'' wrote former government
official Taichi Sakaiya in the daily Japan Times.
   Japanese tend to hustle even on vacation, Sakaiya noted: ``An
overwhelming number of Japanese prefer the quickie type of package
tour such as five European cities in eight days.''
   Today, sports, travel and relaxing at home with videos, stereos
and computers are the most common ways Japanese spend their leisure
time, a change from a few years ago when the majority in a survey
said sleeping was their favorite pastime away from work.

FT  16 FEB 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Staying in the family -
Charles Batchelor discovers that some of the world's oldest corporate
dynasties thrive on diversification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do not underestimate the staying power of the family business. After a
decade when the rise of the corporate financier and the insolvency
specialist appeared to mark the end of corporate longevity, the
old-established family company still has its place.
A French-based association of international, family-run businesses claims
one Japanese member going back as far as 718 while it counts another three
members dating from the 14th and 15th centuries.
The Henokians,* named after a Biblical patriarch who reputedly lived to the
age of 365, has more than two dozen members over 200 years old. The
association requires members to be majority-owned and managed by the
founder's descendants and to be financially sound.
Established in 1981 by descendants of the founders of Marie Brizard &amp; Roger
International, a French manufacturer of spirits and fruit brandies, the
Henokians have 11 members from Italy, eight from France, two each from Spain
and Japan and one each from Germany and Norway. Asprey, the British
manufacturer of luxury goods, was a member but lapsed when its character
changed as it expanded.
What are the common characteristics of member companies? The main one, in
the view of Dimitry Limont, association secretary, is a strong sense of
family history. This means employing professional, non-family managers when
necessary, and excluding incompetent family members, to ensure the business
flourishes but ultimate control stays with the founding dynasty.
A striking characteristic of members is the dominance of traditional sectors
such as wines and spirits and textiles. Metal working and packaging account
for a significant minority, while jewellers, glass makers and printers are
also represented. These sectors may be traditional but the companies have
adapted to technological and market change. Confetti Mario Pelino, an
Italian confectioner, is proud of its hand-made traditions which require
four days to glaze its sweets. Nevertheless, it is modernising production
and franchising the Pelino name outside Italy.
Viellard Migeon, a French iron foundry established in 1679, diversified out
of chains, bolts and screws into fish hooks at the beginning of this century
and claims to rank second in this sector in the world.
The oldest member of the association is the Hoshi Hotel, which claims to be
the oldest ryokan, or traditional inn, in Japan. Founded on the site of a
hot water spring by a Buddhist priest, Hoshi has expanded to a 100-room
hotel owned and managed, if oral tradition is to be believed, by the 46th
generation of the founding family. It was another 919 years until the
establishment of the second Japanese member, Gekkeikan Sake Company. This
relative newcomer was established as recently as 1637. Gekkeikan has
concentrated on improving methods of producing sake while other Henokians
have sought growth through diversification. Friedr. Schwarze (1664) claims
to run the largest Coca Cola bottling line in Germany alongside its
traditional business of producing corn spirit.
The predominance of Italian and French companies may reflect the relatively
underdeveloped capital markets in those countries and the economic weight of
the family-owned business, but the Henokians are seeking to broaden their
membership. The annual subscription of FFr24,000-FFr42,000 (Pounds
3,000-Pounds 5,250) may however, deter some smaller family firms.
The Henokians meet annually to discuss issues affecting the family company
and have links with organisations such as the Tercentenarians' Club**, a UK
group of 300-year-old companies. British family businesses such as R.
Durtnell &amp; Sons, a Kent building company founded in 1591, and Folkes Group
(1699), a Stourbridge-based open-die forging company, would probably qualify
for membership. In the UK, at least, the significance of family companies
has been largely ignored, although the Confederation of British Industry and
Stoy Hayward, an accountancy firm, have established a family business forum.
The compilation last year of a register*** of the largest 50,000 UK
companies by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, revealed 258
companies, many still family-owned, which were over 200 years old. Further
research is needed to show whether the corporate old-timers are an appealing
curiosity or whether they have a message for students of business
management.

   Two U.S. servicemen died and two were injured in a
head-on collision between their car and a truck in northern Japan,
police said Sunday.
   U.S. Air Force Sgt. Michael D. Depperio, 27, and airman Steven
J. Rodriguez, 20, died instantly in the accident on a highway
Saturday afternoon, said a police officer in Towada, 360 miles
northeast of Tokyo.
   Depperio, the driver, was heading east toward the Misawa Air
Base with three other servicemen when he attempted to pass a car in
a non-passing zone. He crashed head-on into a truck driven by
Hiroshi Sakata, 61, who was heading west, police said.
   Airmen Ronald Lawrence, 20, and Steven Theis, 22, were injured
and taken to a nearby hospital, according to the police officer. He
said Sakata escaped injury.
   Theis was seriously injured and Lawrence was only slightly
injured, the police officer said.
   The hometowns of the Americans were not immediately available.

Sushi Marina is the least Japanese-looking Japanese restaurant I've ever been
in. Outside it's a beige stucco bunker; inside, the restaurant is covered with
shingles -- even the awning over the sushi bar has been shingled. Add some
skylights and hanging plants, and you have a place that could pass for a hip
California bar, '60s style.
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the week, the restaurant had the bouncy atmosphere of a
Friday-night happy hour. Waitresses in tank tops and butcher aprons zipped
around at top speed. And although we had to wipe crumbs off our seats, we soon
got caught up in the pleasant rhythm of the place.
</P>
<P>
Miso soup, hot and hearty, appears at the table along with the menus. Listed
are the kinds of Japanese dishes even unsophisticated American palates would
like -- certainly they are dishes kids would love.
</P>
<P>
I was delighted with the soft-shelled crab. It arrived with a sprinkling of
dried bonita that sat tangled on the hot shell like Medusa's hair. The crab
legs were crisp, crunchy and delicate. And the center was extra tender. The
crab came with a lemon sauce.
</P>
<P>
The salmon-skin salad, which consisted mostly of cucumbers and a tiny shred of
salmon skin, was a disappointment at $5. But the seaweed salad at half that
price was quite nice. The seaweed was lightly pickled and served on a mound of
crisp lettuce.
</P>
<P>
Tempura made a grand entrance on a huge platter. The vegetables were outsize,
too. The onions seemed as big around as saucers. The batter was crisp and
somewhat sticky. It tasted good at first, but ultimately became too greasy --
it's best to eat fast.
</P>
<P>
Teriyaki beef was as good as it gets, mainly because of the fine flavor of the
beef. Beef sukiyaki was also satisfying, essentially a sweet onion soup with
thin slices of beef, rice and glass noodles.
</P>
<P>
Of course, with a name like Sushi Marina, the sushi shouldn't take a back seat
to the rest of the menu. It doesn't. When I eat sushi I order tuna first and
see if I like the color. Here it was just the right shade of rose pink and as
tender as butter.
</P>
<P>
The sushi rolls had wonderful sunflower sprouts that made a plateful of them
look like a lush little garden. There were a few rolls here I had never before
tried. The Alaska roll was similar to a California roll but made with cooked
salmon instead of crab. I found I liked Alaska better than California. I can't
imagine what they would make of the Philly roll in Tokyo -- it's an Alaska roll
with cream cheese -- but the flavor of the sesame seeds and the salmon
certainly brought lox and bagels to my mind.
</P>
<P>
Two other remarkable rolls were the sunset dragon roll (sea eel with an amazing
outer wrapping of perfectly textured avocado slices) and the rainbow roll,
eight kinds of fish wrapped around a California roll -- definitely one to
share.
</P>

HIBARI MISORA; JAPANESE SINGER

<TEXT>
<P>
Hibari Misora, 52, a singer who symbolized Japan's postwar recovery to millions
of Japanese. She was considered a source of strength for many Japanese after
Japan's defeat in World War II, Masao Yamaguchi, a professor at Tokyo Foreign
Language University, told Kyodo News Service. Miss Misora, a Yokohama
fishmonger's daughter, made her singing debut at age 11 in 1948. She was later
celebrated for her renditions of melancholy ballads such as "Kanashii Sake"
(Sad Rice Wine) and "Ringo Oiwake" (Song of Apples). She first performed in the
United States when she was 13. In 1973 she attracted 8,000 fans to the Forum in
Inglewood for a concert where she was praised for the wide range and quality of
her voice. She ended her 40-year career with a 10-hour live radio show by
Nippon Broadcasting Co. on March 21, shortly before she was hospitalized with
respiratory problems. Miss Misora sold 68 million records, including 45 million
singles. In Tokyo on Saturday of the complications of pneumonia.

   Coors to Tout Home
   Of Colorado as It
   Looks Elsewhere

   Adolph Coors Co. plans to test a new corporate ad campaign
that brags about the company's Colorado home and the mountain
spring water it brews into beer.
   Why then is the company shopping outside the state for new
breweries?
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new television advertisements, which will start this
summer with four small markets, pose the question: "Where was
your beer born?" The 30- and 60-second segments cut back and
forth between quiet scenes of Colorado mountains and streams
and scenes of smokestacks and crowded highways of big cities.
   "Clean, fresh, pure Rocky Mountain spring water," the
voice-over says. "Next time you reach for a beer, remember."
Words on the screen boast: "Coors. Great Beers Start Here."
The spots were created by Foote, Cone &amp; Belding
Communications Inc., Chicago. Coors declined to say how much
it plans to spend on the campaign.
   The commercials, said Gary Naifeh, Coors vice president,
brand management, "show the contrast of Colorado to other
parts of the country." But, he maintained, the ads aren't
meant to "take a shot at our competition." Coors's biggest
competitors are Anheuser-Busch Cos. of St. Louis and Miller
Brewing Co. of Milwaukee, a unit of Philip Morris Cos. "We
think most people recognize that most places in the country
aren't as nifty as Colorado," he said.
   But the timing of the campaign is curious. The ads, which
stress that Coors beers are made in Colorado, come at the
same time the brewer is searching for new brewing capacity
that will likely be outside of its home state. Coors's recent
successful introduction of Keystone, a popular-priced beer,
and double-digit annual growth of Coors Light have pushed the
brewer's production right up against its Golden, Colo.,
brewery capacity of 20 million barrels a year. A deal that
would have given Coors some Stroh Brewery Co. breweries (none
in Colorado) fell apart late last year, but the company is
continuing to look at both Stroh and G. Heileman Brewing Co.
breweries as possible new brewing locations.
   The campaign "is self-defeating in the long run because
it's impossible to operate a national brewing company from a
single location," said Robert S. Weinberg, a consultant and
former Anheuser-Busch marketing executive, who also eschews
the emphasis on the spring water. "The water necessary to
brew good beer is available in many, many other places," he
said.
   Mr. Naifeh defended the campaign, saying it communicates
"the roots of Coors's heritage, the people, the culture. It's
much deeper than the water." He added that the company "might
be" brewing beer out of the state soon, but "we might be just
packaging beer somewhere else."
   Also puzzling is the advent of the campaign at a time
Coors has had phenomenal growth. Its sales grew 6.5% in 1989,
the largest increase among domestic brewers, in a relatively
flat market. "Their key brands are doing well," said Emanuel
Goldman, analyst for PaineWebber Inc., San Francisco. "It's
not clear to me that Coors needs a corporate campaign."
   But by starting out in only four markets -- Fresno and
Sacramento, Calif., Erie, Penn., and Rochester, N.Y. -- Coors
isn't gambling a lot of money on the venture, Mr. Goldman
pointed out. "They're going to have an opportunity to find
out it's not going to work before spending a lot of dollars,"
he said. "I think they're going to find out it's not worth
the money."

A COMPELLING FABLE IN 'DEMONS IN SPRING'
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The title of the poetic, compelling fable "Demons in Spring" (at the Little
Tokyo Cinemas) refers to the white crests of waves caused by the collision of
warm and cold currents in the sea off Sanriku, the northernmost district of
Japan's main island of Honshu. In ancient times, the people of Sanriku believed
that every spring the breakers carried with them a demon.
</P>
<P>
For more than 25 years, actor-turned-director Akira Kobayashi has wanted to
film the Tokuhei Suchi novel inspired by this legend. It was worth the wait,
for "Demons in Spring" uses the familiar stylized conventions of the Japanese
period picture to create a unique and stunning experience.
</P>
<P>
As a darkened sky rages with thunder and lightning, Saburoshi (Masaru Matsuda),
a handsome, muscular young fisherman, manages to rescue Yuno (Sachiko
Wakayama), his well-born, fragile-looking true love, from an arranged marriage.
They escape by sea, only to wash up nearly drowned on the shores of Sanriku.
According to custom, as strangers they should be thrown back into the ocean to
appease the gods, but a wise village elder (Toshiro Mifune) intervenes. Yet
they face a fresh ordeal as the masked village chief (Sakae Takita) orders
Saburoshi to undergo a series of superhuman feats before being allowed to claim
Yuno as his wife.
</P>
<P>
This severe testing of the hero, as much a staple of Western mythology as of
Eastern, gradually gives way to a consideration of how ancient peoples employed
ritual and sacrifice to try to make sense of a harsh and unpredictable
universe.
</P>
<P>
The chief, who clearly has designs on Yuno, and his soothsayer mother (Keiko
Tsushima) seem at first merely figures of sadistic evil. They acquire tragic
dimension as we come to realize that they are concerned with the survival of
the community, which suffers periodic outbreaks of plague. (Interestingly, the
chief's audiences with his people, held in a large structure of silvery natural
wood, are every bit as formal as those of an emperor or a shogun, even though
the kimonos of these humble, fearful subjects are virtually rags.)
</P>
<P>
In its attempt to understand customs that might easily be dismissed as ignorant
superstitions, "Demons of Spring" is reminiscent of both Shohei Imamura's
"Kuragejima: Legends From a Southern Island" and the more recent "Himatsuri."
Above all, "Demons in Spring" is an adventure-filled tale very well-told,
thanks to Kobayashi's skill and passion and to the gifts of screenwriter Ryuzo
Kikushima, one of the Japanese cinema's most distinguished veterans.
</P>
<P>
Like Kikushima and Mifune, composer Masaru Sato has also been a frequent
Kurosawa collaborator, and all three contribute strongly to the film's
resonance. As for Matsuda and Wakayama, they recall the beauty and innocence of
Jon Hall and Dorothy Lamour in John Ford's "Hurricane."

<HEAD>Coors Launches Sparkling Water Product</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time since Prohibition, a
division of Adolph Coors Co. is selling a non-alcoholic beverage, a
new product called Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water, company
officials said Monday.
   The product goes on sale this week in Colorado, Arizona and
Northern California cities mainly in the San Francisco area, Coors
spokesman Heidi Buehler Nogues said.
   ``Bottled water is the fastest-growing beverage category in
America,'' John Recca, brand development manager, said in a news
release. ``The timing is right for us to take advantage of our
legendary water source.''
   The product is made by Coors Brewing Co., which is a business
unit of the Golden-based Adolph Coors Co.
   Coors Rocky Mountain Sparkling Water will be packaged in
6.5-ounce, six-pack bottles and in 28-ounce bottes, officials said.
It will be available in original, lemon lime and cherry flavors.
   In the past five years, the bottled water marketplace has grown
about 10 percent, primarily because of the consumer interest in
health and fitness, Coors said.
   A key to Coors' product is the use of pure, Rocky Mountain
spring water, an ingredient that has made the company's beers
famous for 50 years, Coors said.
   ``The new product also provides the company with a good
opportunity to diversify its beverage line and provide consumers
with new choices,'' Coors officials said. ``This is especially
important with the growing national trend toward moderate alcohol
consumption.''
   During the 1920s, the manufacture, sale and transportation of
alcoholic beverages was banned in the United States. Buehler Nogues
said Coors sold malt beverages which did not contain alcohol. The
law was repealed in 1933.

MAKO SUSHI'S PERFECT PRESENTATION NOURISHES DINER WITH 'HAPPY MOMENTS'
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For weeks or even months on end I can forget the greatest virtue of good food
-- that it can make me happy. No doubt my memory fails because most of the food
I eat isn't all that great. I only recall how happy a meal can make me when
suddenly I look up from my plate and feel well-taken-care-of, nourished, safe
and delighted.
</P>
<P>
Two such moments occurred recently, and both took place at Mako Sushi in
Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
Mako Sushi has only been open about six months. It's another one of those
mini-mall restaurants that turns out to be far more tasteful and charming than
it looks from the parking lot. Inside it's spare, with a lot of pale wood, some
judiciously placed red lacquer, a glassed-in kitchen area, and a small sushi
bar where Mako and his son prepare some of the best sushi available.
</P>
<P>
The first time I experienced happiness there, I was sitting at the sushi bar
with my friend John. We were chatting intermittently with the man on John's
left, who was a great fan of the head sushi chef, Mako. "He used to be at
Gennmai sushi," the man said, "and before that, he was at what is now
Matsuhisa's on La Cienega." Then he suggested we try the bonita, two mild,
dense parallelograms of a tuna-type fish topped with smelt roe and ginger.
Also, he urged us to try the salmon, which is cured on the premises and is very
subtle and refreshing.
</P>
<P>
We also tried tuna that was a deep, translucent red, and melt-in-the mouth
barracuda. Then we ate a brown rice tempura vegetable roll. This is a
particularly large roll because it contains actual tempura vegetables -- fried
yam and bean and broccoli -- wrapped in seaweed and rice. We found that the
brown rice was indeed different from the white rice in that it's rounder, less
sticky and slightly more nutty in flavor. We were just finishing that roll when
an irregularly shaped, sputtering piece of fish appeared before us. John had
ordered it. "It's kama," he said. "Yellowtail collar. You just dig at it with
chopsticks."
</P>
<P>
I dug. And every bite was a revelation. I never knew that the neck of a
yellowtail could provide such a wide range of flavors and textures. Some of the
meat was fluffy, some dark and oily, all of it very rich and delicious.
</P>
<P>
It was my first moment of happiness at Mako.
</P>
<P>
And, at the risk of sounding a bit crass, my sense of well-being wasn't
diminished when the bill came. After having eaten as much sushi as we could,
our bill was exactly $30, including tea.
</P>
<P>
The next time happiness hit at Mako Sushi, I was again at the sushi bar, this
time with two good girlfriends. Japanese pop songs played on the sound system.
Mako was speaking Spanish to one of his customers and slicing up gorgeous sushi
and sashimi. We had salmon sashimi that was wrapped in cucumber, an excellent
scallop hand roll, and a jazz roll (yellowtail and salmon). When the special
vegetable roll was delivered, we had to just sit and stare.
</P>
<P>
The cross-sections were like tiny, perfectly composed abstract paintings, or
like laser photographs of some microscopic, perfect world. We pored over it,
heads bumping. "It's just too beautiful to eat," said Annie. And then suddenly,
we were all smiling and laughing, just from being nourished and pampered and
having been given something beautiful to look at.
</P>
<P>
On another visit to Mako Sushi, I made myself sit away from the sushi bar and
try some entrees and noodles. Though I wouldn't go so far as to describe eating
at a table in Mako Sushi as a disappointment, it definitely did not yield the
same pleasures that the sushi bar did.
</P>
<P>
At the table, the service was attentive and yet sporadic: Our waters were
eagerly replenished, but food came out of the kitchen in no particular order.
My friend Pablo finished off a good miso soup, an ordinary dinner salad, and an
excellent teriyaki New York steak a good 15 minutes before the arrival of his
father's chiri dofu, a soup of fish, noodles and tofu.
</P>
<P>
As late as the soup was, it was exceptional -- light and clear and nobly
simple. Meanwhile, I worked my way through an array of appetizers: a limp
soft-shell crab; some acceptable, if slightly soggy, grilled eggplant; and an
assortment of dazzling, delicious sushi.
</P>
<P>
Pablo had finished so far ahead of us, he became fidgety, so we kept ordering
him bowls of green tea ice cream to keep him occupied. And when he didn't want
any more ice cream, he wrote a poem:
</P>
<P>
 The most I love
</P>
<P>
Is the dessert
</P>
<P>
 Named green tea
</P>
<P>
 It tastes like cold tea
</P>
<P>
 Like ice cream
</P>

FT  18 JUN 94 / Travel: In search of the Japanese spirit - Christopher
McCooey experiences early morning on Mount Fuji
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MCCOOEY

<TEXT>
Four o'clock on a July morning on the rim of a dormant volcano. It was dark
and chilly, the wind swirling out of the 700-ft crater behind me. I was not
alone, just one of hundreds gathering on the summit of Mt Fuji, at 12,388ft
the highest point in Japan.
Some people had slept for a few hours in mountain huts on the trail or at
the summit. Others, like myself, had climbed through the night and were
resting - conversing in low voices, sharing chocolate and anecdote in
time-honoured mountain tradition - and waiting for the sunrise.
Climbing Mt Fuji is more than just getting to the top of a mountain. For the
Japanese it is a religious experience, confirmation of their true Japanese
spirit, and to be there at dawn, to pay homage to the rising sun, is the
ultimate high.
The eastern sky began to lighten perceptibly as more and more parties of
climbers, some urged on with whistles and megaphones, snaked their way to
the top. Their progress could be monitored by watching their torches
swinging from side to side, following the trails below.
At this altitude it is necessary to rest every few steps as the final few
hundred feet are the steepest and the loose volcanic ash and clinker make it
very tiring: three trudges up, half a slide down, wheeze, rest, gulp for
oxygen, gaze at the stars. Altitude sickness, a red-hot steel needle
inserted behind the eyes and twisted slowly for effect (or so it feels), may
be a problem. If you are prone to this, take altitude pills.
Fuji is an almost perfect volcanic cone about 60 miles south-west of Tokyo.
On days when strong winds have swept away the pall of pollution that
inevitably hangs over Tokyo, a city of nearly 12m, the graceful mountain,
snow-capped in winter, can be seen from downtown.
The volcano must be considered dormant rather than extinct. Since 800 AD,
seven eruptions have been documented; the most recent took place between
December 16 1707 and January 22 1708.
It was in that eruption that the cone lost its perfect symmetry. There is a
hump on its south-east slope called Hoei-zan (san or zan means mountain in
Japanese, which is why Fuji is often called Fuji-san, or Fuji-yama, yama
also meaning mountain). Ash spewed out from Hoei-zan and covered the
capital, called Edo in those days, to a depth of 6in.
When I was there, Hoei-zan, at 8,864ft, was as black as spilt ink against
the patchy low cloud that hung wispily in the valleys below. I could make
out areas of coniferous trees planted in angular blocks on its slopes, and
then a huge area, lighter in colour, along Fuji's southern flanks.
This is a kind of tableland that was denuded of its forest cover when
Hoei-zan erupted. Today it is an area of open moorland used by the
Self-Defence Force as a training ground for its troops, tanks and jets.
Beyond that were swathes of lights from towns and cities, part of the most
dynamic industrial region on earth, the Pacific seaboard from Tokyo to
Osaka.
It had taken me four hours to reach the crater rim from where I had left my
car at the road-head. The trails are steep, but easy to follow. If you are
reasonably fit then a steady plod will get you to the top.
I reached into my rucksack for a sweater as the chill wind at the top
quickly nullified the body warmth caused by my exertions. I found a
sheltered hollow.
My wife had prepared onegiri for me, and I began to munch on the rice ball
wrapped in dried seaweed. In the centre was a pickled plum, tangy and sour,
and I sucked on the stone, enjoying its refreshing taste.
On peak summer weekends as many as 40,000 people climb Fuji. Like any
mountain area, accidents occur, and Fuji has claimed its share of lives.
Some Japanese have actually chosen this sacred mountain as the place where
they want to die. On the north side is an area of virgin forest called
Aoki-gahara, the Sea of Trees. One of the trails that goes from the base of
the mountain to the summit passes through this area.
Hikers are advised to keep to the trail as it is easy to get lost, and
minerals in the rocks cause compasses to malfunction. Japanese bent on
suicide drown in the Sea of Trees; they wander off the trail and get lost,
spending their last earthly hours on the slopes of their beloved Fuji. Each
year the police and the Self-Defence Force combine to search the area; on
average 20 bodies are found.
With proper equipment it is possible to climb the mountain during any month,
but in the winter it should be regarded as a serious alpine expedition.
Several thousand climbers are on the summit at dawn on January 1, to greet
the New Year.
However, the safest time to climb is during July and August when all of the
mountain huts are open. Even so, care is needed because of rock slides.
In August 1980, 12 people - mostly schoolchildren and elderly people - were
killed by a rock slide as they descended Fuji by the sunabashiri (sandslide)
on the north side. This is a large patch of volcanic sand, and it is
possible to get from the summit down to the car-park in an hour if you run
and slide.
The sky had changed from black to deep purple and was now lightening to
blue. The moon was a pale yellow in a panoply of silver blue stars and
orange planets and, tracking through them, a satellite. In the growing light
I became more aware of my immediate surroundings. The garbage that
desecrates the mountain is unbelievable.
Down below there were huge screes of rusting cans beside each hut; on the
trails were candy wrappers and soda cans discarded by climbers; around me at
the summit were empty boxes that had contained rice meals, smashed beer
bottles, orange peel, cigarette ends and wooden chopsticks used once and
dropped. It seems incredible that the Japanese venerate this mountain so
deeply yet treat it so shabbily.
At the summit there is a post office as well as numerous vending machines
selling sake and beer and soda. Snack stalls offer hot noodles at prices
reflecting the altitude. The toilet facilities are primitive. There are
souvenir shops selling charms and trinkets and, if you have a hiking stick,
you can get it branded to prove that you made the conquest.
It is estimated that just under half the 400,000 who climb the mountain
every year are female - which is only right when it is remembered that the
guardian divinity of the mountain is a female one: the goddess who makes the
flowers bloom.
I was lucky, for conditions were perfect the day I climbed. Thousands of
feet below, smoke-grey cloud covered the forests and rice fields, factories
and cities. High above, the thin shavings of cirrus had already caught the
sun's rays and were bright gold, while out in front a blood-red dawn seeped
perceptibly along the eastern horizon.
And then the huge orb of the sun rose majestically out of the mighty Pacific
to a chorus of 'Banzai]' . . . 'Cheers]' . . . 'Long Live the Emperor]' . .
. 'Long Live Japan]'
When to go: the mountain climbing season is from July 1 to August 31. The
mountain huts charge about Pounds 40 with evening meal and breakfast, less
without. The huts are spartan and very crowded at weekends. No camping is
allowed on Mt Fuji.
All trails are about the same in difficulty: steep and with loose rock and
ash. Try and avoid weekends, which are busy. Fuji does not require special
mountaineering skills in the summer season, just reasonable fitness and
perseverance.
A stout pair of hiking boots is essential, with gaiters recommended to
protect your ankles from the sharp clinker and help keep out the cinders
that work their way into your socks. Warm and wind-proof clothes should be
worn or carried as it may be hot at the bottom and freezing at the top. Take
your own food, snacks and drinks.
