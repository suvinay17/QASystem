<HEAD>Court Rules Patent-Infringement Law Applies to Medical Devices</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that a federal
law reducing patent-infringement protection for drug companies
applies to medical devices.
   The court, by a 6-2 vote, refused to reinstate a $26.7 million
award against Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis.
   Eli Lilly and Co. of Indianapolis said Medtronic infringed
patents on a device implanted in patients to correct potentially
fatal heart rhythms.
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court, upheld
Medtronic's interpretation of a 1984 patent-infringement law. The
statute applies to patented inventions as well as generic drugs, he
said.
   Scalia said Medtronic did not infringe on Eli Lilly's patent as
long as the activities of the former firm were reasonably related
to the development of information necessary to obtain federal
approval for its device. The case now goes back to a lower federal
court to determine whether Medtronic met that condition.
   The 1984 law is intended to help generic drug manufacturers
seeking to place their substitutes for patented drugs on the market
as soon as patents expire.
   The law permits the generic drug firms to get information from
the federal Food and Drug Administration and apply to the FDA for
approval of their substitutes prior to expiration of the patented
drugs.
   Also, as long as the purpose is related to its application to
the FDA, the generic companies are allowed by law to ``make, use or
sell a patented invention'' prior to the patent's expiration.
   Eli Lilly, with support from other major medical companies and
patent holders, said applying the law to medical devices could
undermine health care research and development of life-saving
inventions.
   It said the pace of costly, innovative research will be slowed
because patent holders will fear their work soon would be copied.
   But Medtronic said Eli Lilly is distorting economic reality.
   Medtronic said the value of the heart-implant devices it tested
is less than $415,000. By contrast, it said, Eli Lilly is expected
to sell more than $100 million worth of the devices before a
two-year extension of its patent expires on Oct. 26, 1990.
   Medtronic said its new device is intended to treat cardiac
distrubances painlessly with low-energy electrical impulses as a
substitute for the higher-energy shocks that accompany the Lilly
device.
   Lilly's appeal to the Supreme Court was supported by Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, sponsor of the 1984 legislation, and Rep. Carlos
Moorhead, R-Pa., floor manager of the bill in the House.
   The case is Eli Lilly vs. Medtronic Inc, 89-243.

   The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to referee
a big-money battle over patent rights for medical devices.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Eli Lilly and Co. of
Indianapolis, seeking reinstatement of a $26.7 million award
against Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis. Eli Lilly said Medtronic
infringed on patents on a device implanted in patients to correct
potentially fatal heart rhythms.
   At issue are provisions of a 1984 federal law that reduced
patent infringement protection for drug companies.
   A federal appeals court here interpreted the law to apply to
medical devices as well as generic drugs. The appeals court last
March threw out the $26.7 million judgment a lower court awarded
Lilly.
   The 1984 law is aimed at helping generic drug manufacturers
seeking to place their substitutes for patented, brand-name drugs
on the market as soon as patents expire.
   The law permits the generic drug firms to get information from
the federal Food and Drug Administration and apply to the FDA for
approval of their substitutes prior to expiration of the patents.
   Also, as long as the purpose is related to its application to
the FDA, the generic drug companies are allowed by law to ``make,
use or sell a patented invention'' prior to the patent's expiration.
   The appeals court here said ``the clear intent of Congress was
to create an FDA experimental use exception'' for research
activities. ``No persuasive reason is suggested why Congress would
create an exception with respect to those activities for drugs
only,'' the appeals court said.
   Eli Lilly, with support from other major medical companies and
patent holders, said the ruling could undermine health care
research and development of lifesaving devices.
   The companies said the pace of costly, innovative research will
be slowed because patent holders will fear their work soon might be
copied.
   But Medtronic said Eli Lilly is distorting economic reality.
   Medtronic said the value of the heart-implant devices it tested
is less than $415,000. By contrast, it said, Eli Lilly is expected
to sell more than $100 million worth of the devices before a
two-year extension of its patent expires on Oct. 26, 1990.
   ``Notwithstanding the limited nature of Medtronic's
FDA-controlled testing, Lilly contended that the testing gave
Medtronic a headstart towards an entry into the commercial
marketplace,'' Medtronic said.
   It added that if Lilly's interpretation of the 1984 law is
correct, it is up to Congress and not the Supreme Court to correct
the problem.
   Medtronic said its new device is intended to treat cardiac
disturbances painlessly with low-energy electrical impulses as a
substitute for the higher-energy shocks that accompany the Lilly
device.
   Lilly's appeal to the high court was supported by Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, sponsor of the 1984 legislation, and Rep. Carlos
Moorhead, R-Pa., floor manager of the bill in the House.
   The case is Eli Lilly vs. Medtronic, Inc., 89-243.

   INDIANAPOLIS -- Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said its Eli Lilly Japan
KK unit charged five Japanese companies with patent
infringement, in a lawsuit filed in Tokyo District Court.
   The pharmaceutical concern said the five intend to start
generic operations that would encroach upon the company's
patented cefaclor antibiotic, sold under the name Kefral in
Japan by Lilly licensee Shionogi &amp; Co. Lilly called Kefral
Japan's top-selling pharmaceutical.

   Lilly sells the cefaclor product in the U.S. under the
name Ceclor.
   In an industry where intellectual-property fights are
commonplace, Lilly is considered among the most aggressive in
using litigation to protect its patents.
   Lilly Japan KK's suit names Sakai Yakuhin, Tokyo; Ichikawa
Kagaku Kenkyusho, Osaka; Taiyo Yakuhin Kogyo, Nagoya; MF
Seizei Kenkyusho, Tokyo; and Toyo Shinyaku, Aichi Prefecture.
   Lilly said it has notified several drug concerns, "who are
preparing to launch generic Cefaclor products, of the
effective coverage of our patents." But the five named
companies "are continuing their preparation," Lilly said.
   The suit seeks to have the companies prevented from
"importation/manufacture of bulk Cefaclor or production of
final products."

ELI LILLY, the large US pharmaceuticals company, yesterday unveiled a 14 per
cent advance in first-quarter after-tax profits, in line with the strength
in the drugs sector.
The group made Dollars 495.8m in the three months to the end of March,
compared with Dollars 430.1m in the same period a year ago.
The profit figures were scored on sales of Dollars 1.44bn, up 16 per cent on
the previous year's figure. Eli said the improvement derived largely from
volume increases in both its domestic and international markets.
Among the main product contributors were Axid, which treats ulcers; Ceclor,
an antibiotic and Eli Lilly's top seller; Humulin, a genetically-engineered
insulin; Humantrope, a growth hormone also genetically-engineered by Eli
Lilly; and Prozac, the antidepressant, which has run into some controversy,
provoking lawsuits which claim that the drug has harmful side-effects.
Eli Lilly acknowledged that cost increases outstripped sales growth in the
quarter, saying that the rise in marketing and administrative expenses from
Dollars 303.6m to Dollars 365.7m reflected added promotional costs on newer
products.
Research and development expenditure advanced to Dollars 184.5m from Dollars
163.1m.

<DATELINE> MINNEAPOLIS  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Medtronic Inc. said a jury in Philadelphia awarded Eli Lilly &amp; Co. $26.5 million in a patent infringement suit Lilly had filed against the maker of implantable biomedical devices. 

   Medtronic said the suit, filed in 1983, involved two patents for a device that treats tachyarrhythmia, or too fast heartbeat. 

   Medtronic said it strongly disputes the verdict and intends to assert that position in post-trial legal proceedings and in appeals, if necessary. 
It said a federal district court judge will review the verdict, and that a decision is expected in four to six weeks. 

   A Medtronic spokeswoman said it's "premature" to assess any financial impact on the company. 
In the year ended last April 30, the rapidly growing company earned $73.8 million, or $5.25 a share, on sales of $502 million. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Medtronic stock fell $1.75 to $92.50, while Lilly shares rose $1.625 to $85.50. 
The announcement came shortly before the close of trading. 

   A spokeswoman for Eli Lilly, an Indianapolis-based drug, medical instruments and agricultural products concern, said the company had no comment because "the case isn't concluded." 

   The Medtronic spokeswoman said the company has had the device in clinical trials for almost a year. 
She said the company will continue to pursue development, with the expectation of reaching the market in the early 1990s. 
The first of Lilly's patents for the device expire in 1990.

   Two big pharmaceutical concerns, Upjohn Co. and Eli Lilly
&amp; Co., posted solid sales and earnings growth for the first
quarter.
   Lilly, with the same core product line that has fueled its
recent growth, said its net climbed 14% to $388.6 million, or
$1.35 a share, from $340.8 million, or $1.16 a share, in the
year-earlier period. Sales increased 16% to $1.44 billion
from $1.24 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Upjohn's net rose 17% to $133.3 million, or 73 cents a
share, from $114.3 million, or 61 cents a share. Income from
continuing operations rose 15%. Sales rose 11% to $799.4
million from $723.4 million.
   Eli Lilly, based in Indianapolis, said its Axid anti-ulcer
drug, Ceclor antibiotic, Humatrope growth hormone, and
Humulin synthetic human insulin, all were "important product
contributors." The results include what is thought to be a
slowdown in the rapid sales growth of the company's Prozac
anti-depressant, however; Lilly, as a matter of policy, won't
discuss sales of individual drugs. Sales in Europe and Japan
contributed "significantly" to the overall growth in sales.
   The company said its medical devices and diagnostics
division, led by the division's Advanced Cardiovascular
Systems Inc. segment, also helped push sales higher.
   Chairman Richard D. Wood said that while the company's
cost of sales increased at a slower rate than sales,
"operating expenses grew slightly faster" at 20%. The higher
marketing and administrative outlays reflect the costs of
promoting newer Lilly products, "as well as expenses to
support future growth," he said. Lilly's research and
development costs rose 13% to $184.5 million.
   Upjohn Co., based in Kalamazoo, Mich., said its sales
increase partly reflects price rises and foreign-currency
fluctuations.
   World-wide sales of its human healthcare products
increased 10% in the latest period. Rogaine, a
government-approved treatment for baldness, and Ansaid,
Upjohn's nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, contributed
significantly to the U.S. sales growth, the company said.
   U.S. sales were up 10% from a year ago. Sales abroad rose
12% to $317 million, representing about 40% of total sales.

   Dow Chemical Co. and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. will
combine their plant science businesses to form an agricultural
company in Indianapolis, the companies said Tuesday.
   The companies hope to begin construction in 1989 on an
Indianapolis marketing and research facility for Dow Elanco Inc.,
Dow Chemical spokeswoman Sarah Opperman said.
   Dow Elanco Inc. would be one of the largest research-based
agricultural companies in the world, with projected sales of about
$1.5 billion in its first year of operation, the companies said.
   About 200 jobs would be moved from Dow Chemical's Dow
Agricultural Products facilities in Midland to Indianapolis over a
three-year period, Opperman said.
   Current employees of Dow Agricultural Products and Eli Lilly's
Elanco Products Co. would be incorporated into the new company,
Opperman said.
   She said the companies haven't projected what additional jobs
might be involved, but the new venture will employ about 2,800
including field personnel.
   The venture would be formed by consolidating Dow Chemical's
plant science business, Dow Agricultural Products, and Dow's
industrial pest control business with Eli Lilly's plant science
business, Elanco Products Co.
   Eli Lilly will retain Elanco's animal health business.
   Opperman said Dow Chemical and Eli Lilly have signed a letter of
understanding and hope to reach an interim agreement this summer on
the cashless transaction that would form the new company.
   Dow will receive 60 percent of the new venture's earnings and
Eli Lilly 40 percent, she said.

   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. is revamping quality-control procedures throughout the company following U.S. inspectors' discovery of widespread quality-control problems at an Indianapolis drug plant. 

   Lilly wants to have "good, strong controls over the whole thing because we don't want more problems to emerge," said Richard D. Wood, chairman of the pharmaceutical maker, in an interview here Friday. 
The steps mark Lilly's first acknowledgment of the seriousness of the Indianapolis situation, which arose from a U.S. Food and Drug Administration investigation. 

   In a departure from industry practice, Lilly now will oversee quality control from its Indianapolis headquarters rather than leaving it up to individual facilities. 
Centralizing responsibility means "we will have complete control at the corporate level," Mr. Wood said. 
Before, "there was oversight but no direct-line responsibility" for monitoring production quality. 
Lilly also is making some management changes as part of this overhaul, he said. 

   Last month, Lilly halted the distribution of all drugs made at the Indianapolis plant and recalled 10 drugs after FDA inspectors sharply criticized quality-control procedures. 
The problems centered on submission of false or incomplete data, poor record keeping and Lilly's failure to adequately train quality-control officers. 

   The FDA's report triggered a separate probe by the investigations subcommittee of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
The panel wants to learn whether Lilly filed false or misleading information with the FDA about its manufacturing processes in Indianapolis. 
In addition, the FDA now is looking at three other Lilly drug plants in Puerto Rico to determine whether they have problems like the ones found in Indianapolis. 
Lilly officials have tended to downplay the Indianapolis plant's problems as largely technical aberrations. 
The company hopes the facility "will shortly resume full production and shipment," Mr. Wood told a group of U.K. analysts and fund managers here. 

   As part of the quality-control shakeup, Mr. Wood said Robert Williams has assumed the new post of vice president for quality control. 
Mr. Williams previously was Lilly's vice president of agricultural research. 
Two other Lilly executives involved with directing quality control or the Indianapolis facility have been demoted to less responsible jobs, the Lilly chairman indicated.

   MINNEAPOLIS -- Medtronic Inc., the nation's leading
producer of heart pacemakers, is free to expand into the
lucrative U.S. market for cardiac defibrillators after
settling patent litigation with Eli Lilly &amp; Co.
   Minneapolis-based Medtronic, which settled eight-year-old
lawsuits, was working on the defibrillator -- designed to
alleviate too-rapid heartbeats -- when sued in 1983 by a
company that became a unit of Indianapolis-based Lilly.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Medtronic and Lilly dropped an array of cross-lawsuits
dealing with the defibrillator and with a "dual-chamber"
cardiac pacemaker on which Medtronic held a patent.
   In settling the various lawsuits -- one of which went to
the U.S. Supreme Court last year -- the two medical giants
cross-licensed all patents to each other that electrically
manage the rhythm of the heart.
   The net effect is that Medtronic, which already sells a
defibrillator in Europe, will be able to pursue the entire
U.S. market, pending clearance by the Food and Drug
Administration. The world-wide defibrillator market is
estimated at $500 million a year.
   Meanwhile, the Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. unit of
Indianapolis-based Lilly will have an opportunity to expand
its sales of dual-chamber pacemakers. These devices, which
sell for as much as $6,700, make up about 20% to 30% of the
$1.3 billion world-wide pacemaker market.
   Medtronic's entry into implantable defibrillators didn't
come cheaply.
   A company release said it will supply pacemakers to
Lilly's CPI unit -- leading at least one analyst to suggest
that Lilly had come out ahead in the costly litigation.
   Ronald Nordmann, of PaineWebber, said that, "reading
between the lines, it looks to me as if Eli Lilly won.
   "No products went from Lilly to Medtronic, but Lilly's CPI
subsidiary received products from Medtronic," said Mr.
Nordmann. "And I don't think there's any cash involved in the
settlement."
   "It's a little bit better than a tie for Lilly," he
concluded.
   Terms of the settlement were confidential. Neither company
would comment on the number of pacemakers being supplied by
Medtronic, nor on whether any cash changed hands.
   The saga began in November 1983, when Intec Inc. filed
suit in Philadelphia federal court alleging Medtronic and
Hahnemann Hospital there had infringed Intec's patents. Lilly
acquired Intec in 1985 and assigned it to its CPI unit.
   A district court jury found Medtronic had indeed infringed
on the patent, but that $26.6 million jury award ultimately
was overturned by the Supreme Court on an issue of patent
law. The court found that Medtronic, through an FDA exception
to patent-infringement law, was allowed to develop the
defibrillator.
   That device, which sells for about $20,000 overseas and is
expected to be more costly in the U.S., contains a three-step
capability of regulating rapid heartbeats.
   A normal heart beats roughly in the range of 70 beats per
minute. The defibrillator, surgically implanted in a
patient's chest, is capable through small electric shocks of
reducing a racing heartbeat to the normal level.
   The Medtronic product, for example, has three levels of
intensity, depending on the severity of the excessive
heartbeat; to a patient, one level is imperceptible, the next
feels like a hiccup and the third is a noticeable shock. This
last stage would kick in only when the patient faced a
potentially life-threatening cardiac event.
   Lawsuits concerning the defibrillator were filed in
Philadelphia and Indianapolis. Separately, Medtronic filed a
Minneapolis lawsuit contending Lilly had infringed its patent
on the dual-chamber pacemakers.
   Pacemakers are for patients with abnormally slow
heartbeats. Medtronic holds about 46% of the world-wide
pacemaker market, maintaining a similar share in the U.S.
That amount almost doubles the share of its nearest
competitor, Pacesetter Systems Inc. unit of Siemens AG.

paid Dollars 6.7bn for Medco last autumn, while SmithKline Beecham has
agreed to buy Diversified Pharmaceutical Services for Dollars 2.3bn).
Two others, Caremark and Value Health, have formed close ties of their own
with drugs manufacturers in recent months, though they have stopped short of
outright sale.
In a low-growth US drugs market, manufacturers hope that control of
distribution will help them gain market share.
Pharmacy benefits managers fill out prescriptions for big buyers of
healthcare, such as the Blue Cross/Blue Shield organisations which provide
health coverage at state level to many Americans, or companies which pay for
their workers' healthcare benefits.
Through their formularies - lists of recommended drugs - they exercise
considerable influence over the drugs patients buy.
According to figures provided by the distributors, their influence on drug
buying habits is growing fast. The five mentioned above claim more than 75m
people on their formularies, accounting for nearly one in three Americans.
PCS, the biggest by this measure, claims 30m people.
It also has one of the fastest-growing customer lists (the number of people
on its formularies has grown around 50 per cent in the past year). Much of
this growth has come from converting existing customers to the formulary
approach, though PCS has also won some big new contracts: this year, for
instance, it added nearly 1m people with the BlueCross/Blue Shield of North
Carolina.
Eli Lilly probably needed to acquire a pharmacy benefit manager more than
most pharmaceuticals companies. Its sales growth during the first quarter
this year slowed to only 3 per cent, a far cry from the heady double-digit
growth of the early 1990s, and certainly worse than most of its competitors.
The company has been especially hit by the increasingly acute competitive
environment in the US. Eli Lilly's most important markets - antibiotics,
anti-depressants and ulcer therapies - have been undermined by price
competition. Bulk purchasers of medicines have in effect made such products
commodities.
For example, Prozac, Eli Lilly's top-selling anti-depressant, was the first
central nervous system medicine to achieve sales of more than Dollars 1bn.
Although Prozac was first into the market, a raft of competitors such as
Pfizer's Zoloft, SmithKline Beecham's Paxil, and American Home Product's
Effexor, have undermined the drug's growth. Allegations by the Church Of
Scientology that the medicine can cause suicidal and violent behaviour have
also affected volumes.
Eli Lilly has also performed poorly in the increasingly difficult antibiotic
market.
Ceclor, the group's top-selling antibiotic, lost its US patent protection in
1992, and posted sales down 9.5 per cent to Dollars 515m. The successor
drug, Lorabid, has proved disappointing.
Finally, Axid, the company's fourth most important medicine, continues to
compete in an increasingly turbulent anti-ulcer market. Tagamet, SmithKline
Beecham's competitor product, lost US patent protection in May. Early data
suggest Axid's share of new prescriptions is falling.
Eli Lilly has responded by increasing its research and development
investment to create new drugs that would be less susceptible to price
competition. R&amp;D investment rose 10 per cent to Dollars 955m in 1993, and by
an estimated 7 per cent to Dollars 1.020bn this year.
However, there are few new drugs in the pipeline, according to analysts.
The theory put forward yesterday by Mr Randall Tobias, Eli Lilly's chairman
and chief executive, is that PCS Health Systems can offset this increasingly
difficult environment.
It remains to be seen, though, whether the pharmacy benefits managers can
sustain the difficult balancing act of pushing one manufacturer's products
while convincing their customers that they are providing the best drug at
the best price to each patient.
PCS yesterday said its acquisition by Eli Lilly would make no difference to
the selection of drugs on its formulary, for instance - though such a stance
seems disingenuous, given Eli Lilly's willingness to pay Dollars 4bn in cash
for the distributor.
Judging by Wall Street's initial reaction yesterday, Eli Lilly is paying too
much to secure this line of distribution.
The slide in its share price and the prospect of a ratings downgrade reflect
a general belief the deal will weaken the company financially and fail to
produce sufficient sales growth to justify the price tag.
Some of the cash should come from sales of businesses. Eli Lilly said it was
continuing with its plan to concentrate on pharmaceuticals by floating five
of its nine medical devices businesses during the fourth quarter this
financial year. The remaining operations will be sold separately. However,
the company still expects to borrow some Dollars 2.5bn to finance its
acquisition.

<HL> Eli Lilly Unit Sues,
Charging Abbott Labs
Infringed on a Patent</HL>

   Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s Hybritech Inc. unit filed a patent infringement suit against Abbott Laboratories in a federal court in Los Angeles. 

   Eli Lilly's unit claims in the suit that North Chicago, Ill.-based Abbott sells diagnostic kits that infringe on Hybritech's Tandem brand name line of testing products. 
Eli Lilly said the Hybritech line is based on a patented method of using monoclonal antibodies to detect pregnancy, cancer and infectious disease. 

   Hybritech is asking the federal court for damages, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions against Abbott, according to the suit. 
Eli Lilly didn't elaborate. 

   Lael F. Johnson, Abbott general counsel, said the company will fight the suit by arguing that the technology of using monoclonal antibodies in diagnostic kits can't be patented. 
"Our position is that once these things were invented it was just plain obvious to use monoclonal antibodies," he said. 

   Many diagnostic kits used to employ antibodies harvested from animals, such as goats and rats, Mr. Johnson said. 
He added that some kits have changed to monoclonal antibodies, which are artificially engineered antibodies. 
Abbott estimates that kits that use monoclonal antibodies represent 7% of Abbott's world-wide diagnostic sales. 

   The suit is similar to one Hybritech filed in 1984 against Monoclonal Antibodies Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., biotechnology concern. 
In September, a federal appeals court overruled a lower court's decision and upheld Hybritech's patent. 
That case has been sent to federal district court in San Francisco, which will determine whether the Mountain View company's products infringe on the Hybritech patent.

<TEXT>
   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said net income rose 11% to $138.2 million, or 96 cents a share, in the fourth quarter on a 5.6% increase in sales. 

   But on a continuing operations basis, the pharmaceutical giant posted an $86.9 million loss, the result of $271.9 million in restructuring charges and $65 million in special provisions. 

   The total $336.9 million in pretax charges and provisions, which Eli Lilly said it booked to "strengthen long-term profitability," approximately offset the $216 million gain the company realized from its $700 million sale of its Elizabeth Arden cosmetics unit. 
That sale to Faberge Inc., New York, was completed Dec. 22. 

   Lilly included the Arden gain in profit from discontinued operations, which totaled $225.1 million. 
The company posted an increase in net because of a rise in its profit from continuing operations, excluding the charges. 

   A year earlier, profit from continuing operations was $114.3 million, or 80 cents a share. 
Profit from discontinued operations was $10 million. 
Net was $124.3 million, or 87 cents a share. 
Sales rose to $904.9 million from $856.3 million. 
Results were restated to reflect Elizabeth Arden's sale, the company said. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, the company's stock closed at $71.75, down 37.5 cents. 

   The rise in Eli Lilly's profit from continuing operations, after excluding the charges, was due to sales increases in each of the units, which include its mainstay pharmaceutical business as well as its medical-instrument, agricultural and biotechnology operations. 

   The company also had "very strong growth," in its international sales, said Richard D. Wood, chairman and chief executive officer. 
Rising sales volumes were largely responsible. 
One-third of the rise, however, resulted from the U.S. dollar's weakness compared with other currencies, said James M. Cornelius, vice president, finance, and chief financial officer. 

   Eli Lilly was also helped by growing gross profits that outpaced sales because of improvements in manufacturing and a lower 1987 tax rate, Mr. Wood said. 

   Eli Lilly's world-wide pharmaceutical sales rose 7% to $2.27 billion, with increases in both U.S. and overseas markets, it said. 
The company said Ceclor, its oral antibiotic, showed an "exceptionally strong," double-digit sales rise, surpassing $500 million in sales. 
That rise more than offset declining sales of another oral antibiotic, Keflex, which has faced a competitive onslaught from generic products since coming off patent last April. 

   For the year, net rose 15% to $643.7 million, or $4.41 a share, from $558.2 million, or $3.89 a share, in 1986. 
Sales rose 9.6% to $3.64 billion from $3.32 billion.

   Food and Drug Administration investigators are looking into possible brand-name drug manufacturing problems at an Indianapolis plant owned by Eli Lilly &amp; Co. 

   Disclosure of the FDA's investigation of Lilly comes as the federal agency broadened its separate investigation of the generic drug industry. 
Officials of some generic drug companies have admitted to engaging in bribery, submission of false data and other criminal activities to get their drugs on the market ahead of competitors. 
Generic drugs are usually less expensive versions of brand-name drugs whose patents have expired. 

   The FDA said it will begin comprehensive plant investigations at the nation's 20 leading generic-drug makers. 
The agency is already looking at 11 generic-drug makers and it said last week that it plans to test the 30 top-selling generic drugs on the market. 

   FDA officials said the investigation at Lilly centers on manufacturing and record-keeping problems and has not turned up the illegal practices found among the generic-drug manufacturers. 
"We're talking about apples and oranges here," an FDA spokesman said in Washington. 

   A spokesman for Lilly confirmed that FDA officials were conducting an investigation at an Indianapolis plant that makes tablet and capsule products, such as phenobarbital and potassium chloride. 
Lilly's spokesman also confirmed that in June the company recalled from its wholesalers a thyroid drug and 11 types of vitamins manufactured at the plant. 
He said that the recalls involved a premature loss of the products' potency and that there was no safety hazard involved. 
The spokesman said Lilly didn't know whether the FDA inspection was linked to the recalls. 
"Pharmaceutical companies including Lilly are frequently reviewed by the FDA with regard to their manufacturing processes," said a Lilly spokesman. 
"Lilly is now undergoing such a review." 

   People familiar with the FDA investigation of Lilly said it was triggered by the company's June recall of its products. 
On June 22 Lilly recalled a tablet form of thyroid medication. 
On June 30 the company recalled 11 vitamin products. 

   The FDA sources said that although the agency usually sends its inspectors to plants when there is a recall, the Lilly investigation wasn't being considered routine. 
The sources said the recalled products could turn out to be an indicator of more widespread manufacturing problems at the company. 

   All the products were recalled at the wholesale level. 
"These are relatively small product lines for us," said Lilly's spokesman. 
He said the vitamins that were recalled included a B-complex vitamin and two multi vitamins, Mi-Cebrin and Mi-Cebrin T. 
All the recalled products are sold either under the Lilly or Dista name. 
Dista is a Lilly brand name. 

   Lilly's spokesman said the FDA investigation had been under way at the Indianapolis plant for a number of weeks. 
The investigators have focused on Lilly's documentation and validation procedures for its drugs, the spokesman said. 
Investigators haven't told the company when the investigation would be completed. 

   Meanwhile, a group of California physicians, joined by a University of Washington pharmacy professor and a pharmacologist from the University of California at Los Angeles, petitioned the FDA to hold a hearing on the safety and effectiveness of generic drugs. 
They also requested a moratorium on drug approvals until there is a review of all generics on the market. 

   The FDA said it plans to withdraw three drug approvals from Par Pharmaceutical Inc. of Spring Valley, N.Y., and 25 drug approvals from Vitarine Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Springfield Gardens, N.Y., on the ground that the companies made "untrue statements" in seeking FDA clearance to market the generic products. 
Both companies have already voluntarily recalled or suspended production of the drugs involved.

   INDIANAPOLIS -- Eli Lilly &amp; Co. disclosed tentative plans
to sell one of its last "non-core" businesses to Japanese
joint venture partner Shionogi &amp; Co., and retrieve the rights
to market its successful Humulin product in Japan.
   The two-part agreement in principle will further Lilly's
effort to focus on the proprietary pharmaceuticals, medical
devices and diagnostics that represent its core operations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It also marks the latest in a trend in which U.S. drug
companies are increasingly distancing themselves from their
Japanese venture partners.
   Lilly and Shionogi have made Qualicaps, which are hard
gelatin capsules, through a joint venture in Japan for 25
years. Shionogi will pay an undisclosed amount to the
Indianapolis pharmaceutical giant to gain full ownership of
the venture, as well as Lilly's Qualicaps operations in the
U.S., Europe and Mexico.
   The sale makes sense for Lilly because the Qualicaps
business is relatively small and "didn't fit very well" with
the company's core operations, said analyst Ronald Nordmann
of PaineWebber. "Lilly has been downsizing its operations for
a number of years," he said, and the Qualicaps business was
"one of the last remaining unmatched businesses."
   Additionally, hard gelatin capsules are relatively
outdated; most growth currently is in soft gelatin and other
types of capsules, Mr. Nordmann said.
   On the flip side of the planned transaction, Shionogi will
give back to Lilly the rights to market Humulin in Japan, the
world's second-largest pharmaceutical market. The companies
will co-promote the genetically engineered human insulin
until July 1996, when Lilly will become the sole marketer.
Shionogi has marketed Humulin there for Lilly since 1986,
when it was introduced in the country.

<HL> Drug Firms Had Profit Increases In First Quarter --- Warner-Lambert, Eli Lilly And Pfizer Each Posted A 14% Climb in Earnings --- A Wall Street Journal News Roundup </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> WLA LLY PFE </CO>
<IN> ERN PHA </IN>
<TEXT>
   Three drug companies reported robust increases in first-quarter earnings. 

   Warner-Lambert Co. of Morris Plains, N.J.; Pfizer Inc. of New York; and Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Indianapolis, each reported a 14% rise in net income. 

   Warner-Lambert
   Warner-Lambert's world-wide sales, aided by the continuing decline in the U.S. dollar's value, rose 14%, to $928 million. 
Joseph D. Williams, chairman and chief executive officer, said sales grew at each of the core businesses, with the biggest gains registered by confectioneries and non-prescription drugs. 

   Mr. Williams said Warner-Lambert achieved the earnings gains despite record investments in research, advertising and promotion. 
World-wide sales of prescription drugs rose 11% to $288 million, he said, with international sales of prescription drugs up 24%. 

   Prescription drug sales were led by Lopid, a lipid regulator used to lower cholesterol levels, Warner-Lambert said. 
Sales grew because of a highly publicized study, released last November, showing that using the drug significantly lowered risk of a second heart attack. 
Warner-Lambert recently requested permission to expand Lopid's advertised claims in the U.S. to include heart-disease prevention. 

   The company is awaiting U.S. marketing approval for another lipid regulator, the Cholybar brand of cholestyramine, and plans to introduce 60 new products in international markets this year. 

   Warner-Lambert's world-wide sales of non-prescription drugs rose 12% to $314 million. 
World-wide sales were up 12% for Listerine mouthwash and 26% for Rolaids antacid. 
U.S. sales grew 29% for the E.p.t. pregnancy test. 

   Eli Lilly
   Lilly said all business units reported increased results, but it wouldn't break out earnings by segment. 
Pharmaceutical sales rose despite a decline in sales of Keflex, an oral antibiotic, Lilly said. 
The drug's patent expired last April, thus introducing competition from generics. 

   Agricultural sales were helped by favorable weather, Lilly said, which allowed for early application of its herbicides Treflan and Sonalan. 
Lilly disclosed plans to build a pharmaceutical research center for $110 million, to be completed in late 1991. 

   Analysts said Lilly's results exceeded their expectations. 
"It suggests that they're going to have a strong year," said Craig Baskin of Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. 

   Because of the first-quarter results, Ronald Noordman, analyst with PaineWebber Inc., boosted his full-year estimates to between $5.25 and $5.30 a share. 
He had been predicting $5.20. 
In 1987, Lilly earned $643.7 million, or $4.41 a share, including a $233.3 million gain from discontinued operations. 

   Pfizer
   Pfizer said that world-wide sales rose 16%, to $1.3 billion, for the quarter, aided by strong gains in its five business segments. 
Sales advances were 16% in health care, 17% in specialty chemicals and 18% at materials science. 
Consumer sales rose 17% while agricultural sales climbed 15%. 

   Among pharmaceutical sales, the leader was Pfizer's anti-arthritis drug Feldene, with a 33% sales increase. 
Hospital sales rose 14% world-wide.

   Also to be included at the center are a previously
announced $150 million facility for producing the company's
synthetic human insulin product, and a $35 million
administrative building.
   A Lilly spokesman said the second phase of the project,
set for the latter half of the decade, will boost the

   The technology center is separate from Lilly's cross-town
headquarters and basic-research labs, where a previously
announced $415 million expansion project is also under way.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Eli Lilly to test new formula: Planned purchase comes as the
US drugs industry is reshaping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Eli Lilly's planned purchase of PCS, a pharmacy benefits management company,
looks set to complete the reshaping of a big part of the US drugs
distribution business. If finalised, it will bring to three the number of
benefits managers sold in less than a year, for a total consideration of
around Dollars 13bn.
Two others, Caremark and Value Health, have formed close ties of their own
with drugs manufacturers in recent months, though they have stopped short of
outright sale.
In a low-growth US drugs market, manufacturers hope that control of
distribution will help them gain market share. Pharmacy benefits managers
fill out prescriptions for big buyers of healthcare. Through their
formularies - lists of recommended drugs - they exercise considerable
influence over the drugs patients buy.
According to figures provided by the distributors, their influence on drug
buying habits is growing fast. The five mentioned above claim more than 75m
people on their formularies, accounting for nearly one in three Americans.
PCS, the biggest by this measure, claims 30m people as customers. Its growth
has come from converting existing customers to the formulary approach,
though it has also won some big new contracts.
PCS is widely believed to be less interventionist in its sales of drugs than
rivals like Medco. The Merck subsidiary takes an active approach to doctors'
prescribing habits, telephoning physicians and encouraging them to switch to
Medco-recommended drugs whenever a patient submits a prescription for a drug
not on its formulary. In future, PCS is likely to emulate Medco more
closely. 'They have the informatics capacity to intervene more than they
do,' said Mr James Cornelius, Eli Lilly's chief financial officer.
Eli Lilly probably needed to acquire a pharmacy benefit manager more than
most pharmaceuticals companies. The group's sales growth during the first
quarter this year slowed to only 3 per cent, a far cry from the heady double
digit growth of the early 1990s, and certainly worse than most of its
competitors.
The company has been especially hit by the increasingly acute competitive
environment in the US. All Eli Lilly's most important markets - antibiotics,
anti-depressants and ulcer therapies - have been undermined by price
competition. Bulk purchasers of medicines have effectively made such
products commodities.
Take Prozac, Eli Lilly's top-selling anti-depressant, the first central
nervous system medicine to achieve sales of more than Dollars 1bn. Although
Prozac was first into the market, a slew of competitors such as Pfizer's
Zoloft and SmithKline Beecham's Paxil have undermined the drug's growth.
Eli Lilly has also performed poorly in the increasingly difficult antibiotic
market, Ceclor, the group's top-selling antibiotic, lost its US patent
protection in 1992, and posted sales down 9.5 per cent to Dollars 515m.
Successor drug Lorabid has proved disappointing.
Finally, Axid, the company's fourth most important medicine, continues to
compete in an increasingly turbulent anti-ulcer market. SmithKline Beecham's
competitor product Tagamet, lost US patent protection in May. Early data
suggest Axid's share of new prescriptions is falling.
The theory put forward yesterday by Mr Randall Tobias, Eli Lilly's chairman
and chief executive, is that PCS Health Systems can offset this increasingly
difficult environment.
It remains to be seen, though, whether the pharmacy benefits managers can
sustain the difficult balancing act of pushing one manufacturer's products
while at the same time convincing their customers that they are providing
the best drug at the best price to each patient. PCS yesterday said that its
acquisition by Eli Lilly would make no difference to the selection of drugs
on its formulary, for instance - though such a stance seems disingenuous
given Eli Lilly's willingness to pay Dollars 4bn in cash for the
distributor.
Judging by Wall Street's initial reaction yesterday, Eli Lilly is paying too
much to secure this line of distribution. The slide in its share price and
the prospect of a ratings downgrade reflected a general belief that the deal
would weaken the company financially and fail to produce sufficient sales
growth to justify the price tag.
Some of the cash should come from future sales of businesses. Mr Cornelius
said the company plans to raise Dollars 500m-Dollars 600m after tax from the
sale of its 40 per cent stake in Elanco, an agricultural products company
jointly owned with Dow Chemical. An approach has been made to Dow, which has
first right to buy the stake. A further Dollars 1bn will come from the
previously announced flotation or sale of the company's diagnostics
businesses, which will be completed by the end of this year, Mr Cornelius
said.
With around Dollars 1bn in cash and slightly more than Dollars 1bn in debt
at the moment, Lilly's balance sheet can bear the strain of Dollars 4bn of
new debt. After paying off Dollars 1.5bn from the proceeds of sales, it
would be left with a debt/equity ratio of around 40 per cent, Mr Cornelius
said.
It will take time for the financial ramifications of the deal to turn
positive, though - even based on Lilly's assumptions. According to the
company, it will not be until 1997 that higher sales as a result of the PCS
acquisition begin to outweigh the extra debt-servicing costs.

<HL> Eli Lilly Plant in Indianapolis Is Focus
@  Of U.S. Probe on Drug Quality Control

   Congressional investigators have broadened their investigation of the generic-drug industry to include production problems reported by federal inspectors at a plant operated by Eli Lilly &amp; Co. 

   In a letter to Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Frank E. Young, the chairman of the House investigations subcommittee called for records on inspections of more than 50 Lilly manufacturing plants dating back to 1985. 
Subcommittee chairman John D. Dingell said the request was triggered by the FDA's disclosure Tuesday of widespread quality-control problems at one of Lilly's drug plants in Indianapolis. 

   Lilly said it had halted all drug shipments from the Indianapolis plant and recalled 10 products made there after the FDA reported the findings of its four-month investigation. 

   Separately, FDA officials disclosed yesterday that three other Lilly drug-manufacturing plants are under investigation in Puerto Rico. 
An FDA spokesman in Washington said documents from the Indianapolis investigation were sent to Puerto Rico and that investigators were "looking for the same sort of problems that were found in Indianapolis." 
The Puerto Rican investigation was started in late August, the FDA spokesman said. 

   FDA officials said they would probably decide within the next few weeks whether to expand their investigation to other Lilly manufacturing facilities. 

   "We are examining the results of the Indianapolis inspection to determine the magnitude and severity of the problems there and the likelihood they may affect the manufacture of other products," said Carl C. Reynolds, the FDA's Detroit district director. 
The FDA's Detroit office is in charge of the investigation of Lilly in Indianapolis. 

   A Lilly spokesman said yesterday the company had received a call from a staff member of Rep. Dingell's subcommittee "expressing interest" in the FDA probe of the Indianapolis plant. 
The Lilly spokesman declined to give details. 
He also declined to discuss any details of the Puerto Rican investigation. 

   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Lilly's shares closed at $59.00, down 62.5 cents. 

   Rep. Dingell's subcommittee has been leading the federal probe into alleged wrongdoing by generic-drug makers. 
So far, three FDA employees have pleaded guilty to charges of taking illegal gratuities from generic-drug makers, and manufacturing and record-keeping problems have been found at nearly a dozen generic-drug makers' plants. 

   The subcommittee's request for the inspection reports on Lilly marks the first time the federal probe has been extended to brand-name drug makers. 
"We want to make sure that the FDA and the subcommittee treat the brand-name companies the same way the generics are treated," a subcommittee staff member said yesterday. 

   The House panel is seeking to learn whether Lilly filed false or misleading information with the FDA about its manufacturing processes in Indianapolis, the staff member said. 
"We'd also be concerned if they changed drug formulations without notifying the FDA or didn't report problems like stability failures with their drugs," he said. 

   The FDA's report on its Indianapolis investigation relates a number of instances where Lilly's drugs failed to maintain their stability or to dissolve properly. 
The report says Lilly did not maintain proper followup records on the failures.

UC REGENTS SUE LILLY IN DISPUTE OVER BIOTECH PATENT FOR INSULIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The regents of the University of California on Wednesday sued Eli Lilly &amp; 
Co., alleging that the largest U.S. maker of insulin infringed on a university 
patent for the biotechnology that Lilly uses to make its genetically engineered 
insulin product. 
</P>
<P>
The university obtained the patent in 1984 after the technology was developed 
by four scientists at UC San Francisco, the regents said in a complaint filed 
in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. The scientists discovered a way to 
splice the gene for human pro insulin (an insulin precursor) from human genetic 
material and turn it into a bacteria that produces human insulin, the 
university said. 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis-based Lilly "has been and still is willfully infringing" on the 
patent despite protests from the university, the complaint said. The university 
filed the suit after reaching an impasse in negotiations with Lilly toward a 
licensing agreement to compensate UC for the technology, UC attorney Allen B. 
Wagner said. He said this is the first time the university has sued to protect 
one of its approximately 100 biotechnology patents. 
</P>
<P>
The university is seeking an injunction barring Lilly from continuing the 
alleged patent infringement, an accounting of profits and triple damages "in 
view of the willfulness of the infringement." The suit also seeks attorney's 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
Lilly officials couldn't be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Lilly, one of the largest U.S. pharmaceutical companies, controls 80% of the 
U.S. insulin market with two products. It markets insulin derived from animals 
under the name Iletin but sells far more of the genetically engineered insulin 
sold under the Humulin name. Some analysts estimate 1989 sales of Humulin at 
$295 million, compared to $160 million for Iletin. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner said the share of those sales to which the university believes it is 
entitled "will be the subject of considerable research." 
</P>
<P>
Lilly's major product is the oral antibiotic Ceclor, and analysts expect sales 
of the antidepressant drug Prozac, introduced in 1988, to explode in 1990. But 
Humulin is considered a key factor in Lilly's sales growth and expansion 
overseas. Physicians appear to prefer Humulin for treating diabetics because it 
is identical to human insulin, whereas insulin derived from animals has some 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
Lilly was the first company to introduce a human insulin and was able to enter 
the European market and win some market share from the European manufacturers. 
Lilly announced in 1988 a new $150-million plant in Indianapolis to meet 
worldwide demand for Humulin and has announced plans for a new Humulin plant in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
Universities are increasingly willing to take on private industry to protect 
patent rights. The University of Pennsylvania recently said it is suing Johnson 
&amp; Johnson Co. in a dispute over the acne medicine Retin-A, which has also 
been touted as an "anti-aging" cream that smoothes facial wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
The university and one of its professors who developed Retin-A had a license 
agreement with Johnson &amp; Johnson on the use of Retin-A for acne. But the 
university alleges that the professor, without telling the university, obtained 
a separate patent for Retin-A to fight wrinkles and signed a separate deal with 
Johnson &amp; Johnson. The university claims that all patent rights belong to 
the institution because the professor was a university employee. It is also 
seeking damages and royalties from the sale of Retin-A.

   Two major pharmaceutical makers reported double-digit
increases in second-quarter earnings. A third, American Home
Products Corp., reported a slight decline after a
year-earlier gain.
   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said its earnings continued to reflect the
same trends in its core product line that have contributed to
growth in recent quarters. And Upjohn Co. said it had record
quarterly sales, including animal health products.

   American Home Products
                                                                                                       

   American Home Products, based in New York, said profit in
the year-ago quarter included an after tax gain of $70
million, or 23 cents a share. Sales for the quarter rose to
$1.62 billion from $1.61 billion.
   Even so, American Home said the company's continuing
operations increased profit because pharmaceutical sales in
year-ago period were off sharply. The company said prior to
the second quarter last year it discontinued a variety of
promotional programs to wholesalers, which had reduced sales.
   A company spokesman noted that the recent quarter's sales
were very good, and the company's Premarin, an estrogen
replacement drug, and Orudis, a pain medicine, were
especially strong.
   For the six months, sales declined slightly to $3.38
billion from $3.42 billion; the year-ago period included
sales from the businesses the company has shed.
                                                                                                       

   Eli Lilly &amp; Co.
                                                                                                       

   The Indianapolis pharmaceutical giant said a 12% increase
in sales, to $1.38 billion, reflected volume increases in the
company's domestic and international markets. World-wide
sales in the second quarter of pharmaceutical products such
as Axid, its anti-ulcer drug; Ceclor, an antibiotic; the
cardiovascular product, Dobutrex; Humulin, a genetically
produced insulin; and its Humatrope growth hormone, grew from
the previous year.
   The company added that the drug Prozac and the antibiotic
Vancocin contributed to its sales increase. In the first
quarter, the rapid growth of Prozac, the controversial
anti-depressant, was believed to have slowed -- reflecting
numerous lawsuits alleging the product may be linked to
suicide attempts by some patients suffering from depression.
Lilly said it doesn't discuss sales of individual drugs.
   The company also said that its medical devices and
diagnostics division contributed "significantly" to the
quarter, led by the division's Advanced Cardiovascular
Systems Inc., Cardiac Pacemakers Inc., and Hybritech Inc.
subsidiaries.
   Lilly said manufacturing costs and operating expenses grew
at a slower rate than sales, resulting in a 20% gain in
operating profit. Research and development costs rose 12% to
$183.1 million.
                                                                                                       

   Upjohn Co.
                                                                                                       

   Upjohn said its strong earnings accompanied record
quarterly sales of $859 million, up 14% from a year earlier.
   The Kalamazoo, Mich., company said its sales of
pharmaceutical products rose 16% on strong performances from
Ansaid, an anti-inflammatory agent; Xanax, a tranquilizer;
and Halcion, a sleeping pill.
   Sales of its agricultural products jumped 10%. All
businesses in that unit contributed to the sales gain,
officials said. Animal health products were led by the
antibiotic, Naxcel, and the feed additive, Lincomix.
   Operating profit in the quarter was $168 million, compared
with $175 million last year. Earnings from continuing
operations were up 34%, after excluding a pension credit and
other nonrecurring items from last year's results.
   The results pushed up Upjohn's firsthalf earnings, and
sales increased 12% to $1.66 billion.

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eli Lilly and Co. has discontinued
manufacturing 60 products and versions of products, according to a
notification letter sent to drug wholesalers around the country.
   Representatives of several pharmaceutical wholesaling companies
said the products involved were either old or slow-selling and that
the manufacturing halts would have little or no financial impact on
them.
   ``It shouldn't cause an problems. Our buyers reacted to it as a
routine maintenance'' of Lilly's product line, said a spokesman for
Bergen Brunswig Corp., a California-based drug wholesaler.
   In the letter, dated March 26, Lilly told wholesalers to
continue to fill orders from their inventories and then, after
inventories were depleted, to classify them as ``manufacturer
discontinued.''
   Lilly said it knew of no other manufacturers for 10 of the
products, including two package sizes of 32 milligram Darvon
capsules. However, other dosage sizes of Darvon are available.
   In additions, some packaging formats of Axid, Lilly's anti-ulcer
drug, and of Keflex, an antibiotic, were discontinued, but Lilly
continues to manufacture those products in other formats.
   Several of the products discontinued were among those cited in
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's highly critical inspection
report on Lilly's manufacturing practices issued last year.
   Also discontinued two versions of Bacitracin ointment, an
over-the-counter antibiotic. According to the FDA, Lilly recalled
about 6,000 tubes of Bacitracin in February after testing showed
that the product might not retain its potency through its
expiration date.

   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said it will build a $115 million plant near Strasbourg, France, to boost production of a genetically engineered form of human insulin. 

   Construction of the plant, which will be the pharmaceutical concern's third facility to make the product, Humulin, will begin next autumn, with production starting in early 1993. 

   Lilly, based in Indianapolis, is the world's largest producer of insulin, which is used by diabetics. 
About half of U.S. diabetics currently use Humulin, which is made by recombinant-DNA procedures and thus differs from the natural protein extracted from animal sources. 
A Lilly spokesman said that use of Humulin, introduced in 1982, is growing. 

   The French plant, which will employ about 300 people, will be built in the town of Fegersheim, adjacent to an existing Lilly manufacturing operation that has about 500 workers.

   WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court ruled that a company may
test-market a medical device on which another firm holds a
patent if the effort is part of an attempt to obtain federal
clearance to develop similar devices.
   The court determined, 6-2, that a federal law creating an
exception to patent-infringement claims to allow information
to be gathered about drugs also applies to medical devices.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The decision was a victory for Medtronic Inc. of
Minneapolis, which was sued for infringement by Eli Lilly &amp;
Co. of Indianapolis. More broadly, it is a substantial defeat
for older, established medical-technology developers with
long-held patents, allowing more leeway and flexibility to
newer, upstart companies.
   Older concerns, such as Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. warned in friend-of-the-court briefs
that such a decision would "curtail innovation" by
manufacturers of medical devices. But the attorneys general
of 19 states and the American Association of Retired Persons
filed briefs saying such a ruling would enhance competition
in design and marketing of medical technology.
   The decision, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, required
the court to interpret a 1984 technical amendment to the
federal law that regulates food, pharmaceuticals and
cosmetics. The amendment said it isn't patent infringement to
use or sell a "patented invention" of another company if the
purpose is "reasonably related" to obtaining data to submit
to the FDA.
   The FDA must approve all new drugs and medical devices.
The amendment was intended to allow competitors to enter the
commercial market as soon as a patent expires, rather than
waiting until then to start the test marketing.
   Lilly sued Medtronic for infringement of its patent for a
pacemaker that regulates tachyarrhythmia, or a too-fast
heartbeat. Medtronic cited the 1984 amendment, asserting that
it is manufacturing its own implantable heartbeat regulator
for clinical testing to provide data to the FDA.
   Lilly argued, and a federal district court in Philadelphia
agreed, that the amendment applied only to drugs and wasn't a
defense to patent-infringement claims on medical devices. In
1988, a federal jury awarded $26.6 million to Lilly for
patent infringement.
   But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,
which handles all patent appeals, ruled in March 1989 that
Congress didn't intend to limit the provision to drugs. The
appeals court sent the case back to the district court to
decide whether Medtronic's use of the devices was solely for
the purpose of gathering FDA clinical data. But Eli Lilly
appealed to the high court, putting the issue of Medtronic's
purpose on hold.
   Yesterday, the high court sent the case back to the court
to decide the validity of Medtronic's claim that it was
marketing the implantable heart regulator to gather
information for its FDA application.
   Justices Anthony Kennedy and Byron White dissented, saying
Congress intended to limit the 1984 amendment to drugs.
Justice Sandra O'Connor didn't participate in the case. (Eli
Lilly &amp; Co. vs. Medtronic Inc.)
                                                                                                       

   Suing Thrift Regulators
                                                                                                       

   The justices agreed to decide whether federal law allows
lawsuits for damages for the actions of federal bank
regulators that allegedly cause losses to former thrift
directors. The high court agreed to hear an appeal by the
Justice Department in a dispute with Thomas Gaubert, a former
Democratic fund-raiser and onetime chairman of Independent
American Savings Association of Irving, Texas.
   A federal appeals court in New Orleans ruled in October
1989 that Mr. Gaubert may sue the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Dallas and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which Congress
has since replaced with the Office of Thrift Supervision.
   Mr. Gaubert charged that he lost $25 million in property,
which bank regulators required him to contribute to bolster
the thrift's assets. The contribution was part of an
agreement in which Mr. Gaubert gave up control of the Texas
thrift in exchange for regulators' dropping an inquiry into
his role in an Iowa thrift.
   While under the control of federal regulators, the Texas
thrift's value dropped from $75 million to a negative balance
of $400 million, wiping out the value of Mr. Gaubert's
property.
   Mr. Gaubert, along with four other former officers of
Independent American, was sued last month by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. for approving investments that the
FDIC said caused about $50 million in losses at the Texas
thrift. Last year, Mr. Gaubert was acquitted of bank fraud
charges brought by the Justice Department in connection with
the Iowa thrift.
   The case before the Supreme Court involves the Federal
Tort Claims Act, which allows lawsuits for damages against
the government. The Justice Department argues that the
lawsuit is barred by a legal exception to the act unless
government employees were performing "discretionary"
functions. But the appeals court ruled that the actions of
federal regulators with regard to Independent American were
"operational" in nature and weren't covered by the exception
for discretionary functions. (U.S. vs. Gaubert).
                                                                                                       

   Apple Computer Case
                                                                                                       

   The justices refused to hear an appeal by disgruntled
shareholders of Apple Computer Inc. who filed a
securities-fraud lawsuit after Apple's stock dropped 75% in
1983. The lawsuit contended that the company and its
directors made misleading statements about the sales
prospects for the Lisa computer and companion Twiggy disk
drive. In 1987, a federal judge dismissed the class action
without a trial, finding no evidence of a securities-law
violation.
   In September 1989, a federal appeals court in San
Francisco affirmed the dismissal of most of the lawsuit. The
appeals court ruled that Apple's directors didn't
intentionally mislead investors about Lisa's outlook, because
the directors reasonably thought the prospects for success
were good. Moreover, the appeals court said that Apple's
optimistic statements about Lisa were offset by gloomy
forecasts and criticisms that reached the market through the
news media.
   The appeals court ordered a trial on one issue of whether
Apple officials made misleading statements because they knew
of technical problems with the disk drive that would affect
production of the computer. That part of the case may now
proceed. (Schneider vs. Apple Computer Inc.)

<TEXT>
   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said Tuesday its earnings
rose 26 percent to a record $274 million for the second quarter,
led by sales of the antidepressant drug Prozac and other
pharmaceuticals.
   For the three months ending June 30, earnings per share were 93
cents, compared with 75 cents on net income of $217 million during
the same period in 1989. Sales rose 24 percent to a record $1.23
billion from $986.6 million during the second quarter last year.
   Chairman Richard D. Wood said Lilly experienced sales growth in
each of its operations.
   ``Sales increased in both international and domestic markets.
Higher unit volume continued to be the main contributor to the
quarter's results,'' Wood said. Operating costs grew slower than
sales, he added.
   Worldwide sales of pharmaceutical products ``were significantly
higher than those of the second quarter of last year,'' Lilly said
in a prepared statement. Besides Prozac, other pharmaceutical sales
leaders included the drugs Axid, Ceclor, Dobutrex, Humatrope and
Humulin, Lilly said.
   Lilly also reported record results for the first six months of
1990. Net income increased 23 percent to $615 million, or $2.07 per
share, on sales of $2.47 billion.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENENTECH, the US biotechnology company, said it had filed a suit against
Eli Lilly, the pharmaceuticals company, charging that Lilly's manufacture of
a human growth hormone, used to treat dwarfism, infringes a new Genentech
patent.
The move came after Genentech had been granted a patent covering basic
processes used in recombinant DNA technology or 'cloning'.
Genentech, a pioneer in the use of recombinant DNA technology to produce
pharmaceuticals, launched its first product, a human growth hormone, in
1985. Lilly entered the market two years later with its own version of human
growth hormone.
Since then, the two companies have been waging legal battles over patent
rights.
Eli Lilly said: 'This is yet another suit in the ongoing litigation.'
Genentech said its new patent resulted from early biotechnology research
conducted by Dr Keiichi Itakura and Dr Arthur Riggs at the City of Hope
National Medical Centre.
'Their research led to the production of the first useful protein by
recombinant DNA technology, which is widely acknowledged as one of the most
significant scientific achievements of this century,' said Mr Stephen Rains,
Genentech vice-president of intellectual property.
Genentech has already licensed its recombinant DNA technology, including
that covered by the new patent, to 28 other companies in the biotechnology
field.
In 1990, Roche Holdings acquired a 60 per cent stake in Genentech for
Dollars 2.1bn.
Separately, the Food and Drug Administration is set to review Genentech's
application for approval of Pulmozyme, a treatment for cystic fibrosis.
Analysts predicted that the drug may be approved before the end of the year.

   Major U.S. drug makers reported higher earnings for the
fourth quarter and year as a result of strong sales growth
and level manufacturing costs.
   Eli Lilly &amp; Co., Indianapolis, said earnings rose 13% to
$255.3 million, and Johnson &amp; Johnson, a New Brunswick, N.J.,
maker of pharmaceuticals and health-care products, posted a
14% boost to $232 million.

   Marion Merrell Dow Inc., a Kansas City, Mo., company
created by the 1989 merger of Marion Laboratories and Merrell
Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc., said fourth-quarter net income was
$112 million, up 53% from pro-forma 1989 levels.
                                                                                                       

   Eli Lilly
                                                                                                       

   The pharmaceutical giant posted its 30th consecutive year
of sales and earnings growth. However, sales for the quarter
grew at a faster rate, 26%, than did earnings.
   Sales growth in each of Lilly's operations paced the
company's performance, as did the fact that manufacturing
costs and operating expenses for the year increased at a
slower rate than did sales.
   World-wide 1990 sales of pharmaceutical products rose 26%
to $3.71 billion, with growth led by the antibiotic Ceclor
and the anti-depressant drug Prozac. Prozac's growth came
despite lawsuits alleging the product may be linked to
suicide attempts by some patients suffering from depression.
   Other products contributing to the growth were the
anti-ulcer drug Axid, the cardiovascular product Dobutrex,
Humatrope, a human growth hormone, Humulin, a genetically
produced insulin, and the antibiotic Vancocin HCl.
   The earnings increase was held down by higher interest
costs related to the company's stock buy-back program and
lower earnings in the DowElanco agricultural chemicals unit.
   Chairman Richard D. Wood also said the company raised
capital spending for the year by 82%, primarily for higher
production capacity and environmental projects.
                                                                                                       

   Johnson &amp; Johnson
                                                                                                       

   The company said pharmaceutical sales paced earnings for
the fourth quarter and year. The concern posted a 13%
increase in fourth-quarter sales to $2.79 billion from $2.47
billion.
   The company also said the weakness of the dollar against
other currencies boosted sales; more than half of the
company's sales are overseas.
   The pharmaceutical sector outpaced the company's other
businesses. Pharmaceutical sales for 1990 rose 24%, paced by
the anti-fungal drugs Terazol and Nizoral, and the
antihistamine Hismanal.
   The company didn't introduce any drugs in 1990, but the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved several,
including the anemia drug Procrit, the antibiotic Floxin, the
cardiovascular drug Vascor and Duragesic, an anti-pain skin
patch.
                                                                                                       

   Marion Merrell Dow
                                                                                                       

   Sales for the fourth quarter rose 18% to $630 million from
the pro-forma figure of $535 million for the last quarter of
1989.
   The company's first full-year results showed sales of
$2.46 billion, up 11% over the 1989 pro-forma numbers.
   The top contributors to sales for the fourth quarter and
the year were the Cardizem line of cardiovascular products
and Seldane, an antihistamine product. Seldane sales for the
quarter more than doubled, compared with the year-earlier
quarter; this was partly due to the fact that the company
launched sales of the drug in Japan in 1990 under the name
Triludan. Revenue from the drug in Japan for the year
exceeded $50 million.
   Fourth-quarter sales of Carafate, a drug for duodenal
ulcers, rose 17%.

   A U.K. appeals court decision probably will force about 500 Britons to drop their suits against Eli Lilly &amp; Co. over its anti-arthritic drug Oraflex. 

   Three appeals judges yesterday upheld last month's High Court ruling that all 1,500 Britons claiming the drug caused illness or death in their families must share the estimated #6 million ($9.9 million) court costs equally if their litigation fails. 
The suits against the Indianapolis-based drug maker and the British government seek unspecified damages. 

   The claimants' lawyers unsuccessfully argued in court Tuesday that only the roughly 1,000 plaintiffs eligible for government legal aid should pay the court costs. 
Yesterday's ruling means the 500 plaintiffs who don't qualify for government aid but can't afford the legal fees probably will drop their suits against Lilly, their lawyers said. 

   In 1985, Lilly pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court to 25 criminal counts for failing to inform U.S. officials about four deaths and six illnesses in Britain among patients taking the drug. 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials have said that Oraflex, known as Opren in the U.K., has been "possibly" linked to 49 deaths in the U.S. and "several hundred abroad." 
Lilly already has settled several U.S. lawsuits out of court. 

   After yesterday's ruling, six lawyers representing about 1,200 U.K. claimants called on Lilly and the British government agency that approved the drug in the U.K. "to compensate all victims of Opren, as Eli Lilly has done in America." 

   A settlement with both the drug company and the U.K. Committee on the Safety of Medicine was "nearly achieved" before this week's appeals court hearing, the lawyers said in a statement. 
"It cannot be right for Eli Lilly and the government to delay settlement until they see how many victims have had to drop out," their statement went on. 

   Lilly began to sell Oraflex in the U.K. in October 1980 and in the U.S. in May 1982. 
When Britain banned the drug on Aug. 5, 1982, Lilly withdrew it from the U.S. and other international markets. 

   In 1984, an Indiana judge dismissed a local suit against Lilly by more than 400 Britons who alleged that Oraflex had harmed them. 
The judge said they should file their claims in British courts. 

   Rodger Pannone, a plaintiffs' lawyer here, said yesterday that some of the 500 British claimants might return to the Indiana court because they had been "denied access" to the U.K. courts. 
It wasn't immediately clear whether any plaintiffs were involved in both the Indiana and British cases. 

   The appeals court also ordered the plaintiffs' lawyers to promptly seek a High Court deadline for when claimants must decide whether to drop their suits. 

   Lilly declined comment, saying it hadn't had an opportunity to study the decision with its U.K. counsel. 
Lilly shares closed yesterday at $92.375, up $2.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

<TEXT>
ELI LILLY of the US is cutting about 10 per cent of its worldwide
pharmaceuticals workforce and shedding a further 2,000 staff throughout its
operations, in an effort to remain competitive in an increasingly hostile
industry.
Ten per cent, or 2,000 positions, are expected to disappear by mid-1994
through a combination of voluntary early retirement, attrition and selective
hiring. Lilly hopes to eliminate the second 2,000 jobs by further attrition,
cutting use of temporary and contract workers and consultants.
The move marks the first big initiative by Lilly's new management. Its
former chief executive, Mr Vaughn Bryson, resigned in June after clashing
with Lilly's board. Lilly's failure to produce new, big-selling drugs and
its disappointing results contributed to the resignation. Mr Bryson was
replaced by Mr Randall Tobias, former vice chairman of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph.
Lilly plans to accelerate the expansion of its European pharmaceutical
operations, but sharply to reduce the size of its London headquarters - from
35 staff to five - and its Vienna regional office.
'These actions are the first in what we expect to be a series of decisions
that will help us achieve stronger long-term growth by reducing our
expenses, improving our efficiencies and expanding our capabilities,' said
Mr Tobias. 'These are among many alternatives we're considering in light of
our changing global markets and the economic realities of those markets.'
The Indianapolis-based company has been hit by pressure to reduce drug
prices, and has been plagued by the absence of important new drugs.
As a result of its early-retirement programme and job cuts in Europe, Lilly
said it would take special pre-tax charges against fourth-quarter earnings.
The company predicted third quarter earnings of 98 cents to Dollars 1 a
share. On Wall Street, Lilly's shares closed Dollars 3 1/2 up at Dollars 53
5/8.

   SmithKline Beecham PLC said it received Food and Drug
Administration approval to begin marketing its Relafen
arthritis drug.
   Relafen was among a batch of new prescription drugs
approved by the FDA in late December, including a Hoffmann-La
Roche Inc. antidote for tranquilizer overdoses and an Eli
Lilly &amp; Co. antibiotic product.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Eli Lilly, Indianapolis, will sell its new drug,
loracarbef, under the brand name Lorabid, as a broad-spectrum
treatment for bronchitis, pneumonia, strep throat, sinus- and
middle-ear infections, urinary-tract infections and certain
skin infections, including impetigo. FDA officials described
Lorabid as a successor to Ceclor, a major Eli Lilly drug.
   "They put a lot of work into developing this drug," said
Bruce Burlington, an FDA official. "They had 10,000 people in
clinical trials, which is a much larger number than usual."
   SmithKline Beecham shares climbed on the Relafen
announcement, which unlike word of the Eli Lilly and
Hoffmann-La Roche approvals, came before markets closed
Friday. London-based SmithKline's American depositary
receipts closed Tuesday at $86.25, up $4, in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading.
   Relafen, SmithKline's brand of nabumetone, is one of a new
class of non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs for treatment
of severe arthritis, particularly rheumatoid arthritis and
osteoarthritis. About 13 million people suffer from arthritis
in the U.S., SmithKline said. There currently are more than
15 such non-steroidal arthritis drugs being marketed, "and
few substantial differences have been demonstrated in their
ulcer-causing potential," the company said. What
distinguishes Relafen is that it is non-acidic and is a
"prodrug"that is, it does not become active until after it
passes through the stomach and is transformed by the liver,
said the company, whose U.S. operations are based in
Philadelphia.
   SmithKline said that "in controlled clinical trials,
including 1,677 patients treated (with Relafen), cumulative
incidence of peptic ulcers was 0.3% at three to six months,
0.5% at one year and 0.8% at two years." The company said
1,140 of the patients were followed in the trial for a year,
and 927 were followed for two years.
   Relafen currently is marketed in several other countries;
world-wide sales are about $50 million. With the U.S. market
included, some analysts expect sales to reach $200 million in
1992.
   Hoffmann-La Roche plans to market its new drug,
flumazenil, under the brand name Mazicon. The drug reverses
the sedative effects of Valium, Halcion and other drugs that
are used in anti-anxiety and anti-depressant therapy or as a
part of general anesthesia.
   "It's the first antidote to Valium -- and other
benzodiazepine -- overdoses," said Robert Temple, a senior
FDA official. "Up until now, all you could do is provide
(life) support for them." Such overdoses can be fatal,
particularly if the drugs are taken along with alcohol.
   Hoffmann-La Roche, the U.S. unit of Swiss drug maker Roche
Holding Ltd., also makes Valium. Mazicon is expected to be
widely used to help anesthesized patients wake up after
surgery.
   The FDA, under Commissioner David Kessler, approved 30 new
prescription drugs in 1991, seven more than the previous
year. The agency said it also cut its average approval time
last year by a few months. Now it takes the FDA about two
years to approve new drugs.
   Other late-December approvals include:
   -- Simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, which Merck &amp;
Co.'s Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme division plans to market as Zocor.
It is pharmacologically similar to another Merck drug,
lovastatin, which is sold under the brand name Mevacor.
"Whether simvastatin has any advantages isn't clear yet,"
said an FDA drug-review official.
   -- Cefprozil monohydrate, an antibiotic developed by
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. to treat mild-to-moderate
respiratory infections as well as certain skin infections.
The company will market it as Cefzil.
   -- Isosorbide mononitrate, or ISMO, a drug made by
American Home Products Corp.'s Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories for
the prevention of angina pectoris due to heart disease.
   -- Enoxacin, a Warner-Lambert Co. drug to treat
urinary-tract infections and the venereal disease gonorrhea.
The drug, with a brand name of Penetrex, is similar to others
on the market.

   INDIANAPOLIS -- Eli Lilly &amp; Co. signed a four-year
research pact with closely held Neurogenetic Corp., under
which the pharmaceutical company will fund Neurogenetic's
development of neurological drugs.
   Lilly, which said it will acquire an equity stake in the
Paramus, N.J., company, purchased the exclusive world-wide
license to Neurogenetic's genetically engineered versions of
the human neurotransmitter known as serotonin.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Terms of the pact weren't disclosed. While the agreement
with Lilly marks the first commercial partnership
Neurogenetic has formed, the small company made it clear that
it will seek further links with other drug makers, and will
push forward with its own research.
   Nerve cells are turned on and off by chemical messengers,
known as neurotransmitters, that fit into receptors.
Knowledge of how those receptors are activated, many
scientists think, may help in development of drugs to control
migraine headaches, depression and anxiety.
   Lilly's big-selling Prozac anti-depressant works by
slowing brain cells' intake of serotonin, for example.
Research into that family of neurotransmitters is being
pursued by a number of drug companies.
   Neurogenetic makes genetically engineered receptors, which
can speed such research by allowing scientists to directly
observe how a potential drug will affect the desired receptor
without time-consuming tests on animal tissue.
   Lilly, Neurogenetic said, will fund research "directed at
integrating these cloned receptors into ongoing serotonin
research efforts at Lilly." Under the agreement, Neurogenetic
will receive royalties on sales of any Lilly products that
come out of the collaboration.
   Neurogenetic, which said "several" drug makers have asked
it to consider cloning specific so-called peptide receptors,
will "choose one partner for a collaboration in this area"
later this year.

   Monoclonal Antibodies Inc. said a federal judge in San Francisco, as expected, issued a preliminary injunction blocking it from selling products that account for 80% of its sales. 

   The biotechnology concern said Judge Marilyn Patel granted a motion by Indianapolis-based Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s Hybritech unit for an injunction against the sale of all Monoclonal products named in a Hybritech patent-infringement lawsuit. 
An Eli Lilly spokesman said the company had no immediate comment on the action, but expects to comment later this week. 

   Monoclonal said it is "taking steps to minimize the effect of the injunction," by redesigning major products such as its OvuStick ovulation test and Advance pregnancy test to avoid infringement of the Hybritech patent. 

   Monoclonal also has cut its staff about 30% and is developing new tests for detecting sexually transmitted diseases and drug abuse, which it believes "could make an important contribution" to sales. 
The company said it hopes to begin shipments of the new products in early 1988. 

   As previously reported, Monoclonal said in March that the judge's injunction, which is expected to cost the company about $1.1 million in sales each quarter, was forthcoming. 
The suit, filed in 1984 by then-independent Hybritech, charges that Monoclonal infringed on a technology that uses antibodies to detect and monitor physical conditions such as pregnancy. 

   Monoclonal prevailed in the initial trial, but a federal appeals court last September upheld the validity of the Hybritech patent and sent the case back to the trial court. 
The injunction is expected to remain in place until the court resolves the infringement question, a Monoclonal official said. 
Monoclonal has asked the court to stay the injunction, he said, and is asking for a new trial, but it is "not clear" whether those requests will be granted. 

   In the year ended March 31, Monoclonal had a net loss of $8.1 million, which included charges of $4.3 million related to withdrawal of a product line. 
Revenue for the year was $7.5 million, of which about $6.2 million came from product sales. 
As previously reported, the company's auditor intends to issue a qualified opinion on Monoclonal's year-end financial statements because of uncertainty about the outcome of the legal proceedings. 

   In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Monoclonal shares closed at $4, unchanged. 
Eli Lilly closed at $84.125, up 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   An anonymous benefactor described as a "Fairy Godparent" offered to help pay legal fees for about 500 Britons so they can pursue their lawsuits against Eli Lilly &amp; Co. 

   The offer means the claimants "probably don't need to" drop their suits against the U.S. drug maker over its anti-arthritic drug Oraflex, said Rodger Pannone, their lawyer here. 

   Some 500 plaintiffs seemed likely to give up their litigation against the Indianapolis-based concern after a High Court ruled in May that all 1,500 Britons who claimed Oraflex caused illness or death in their families must share an estimated #6 million ($9.9 million) in court costs if their litigation fails. 

   "If this will help facilitate resolution of the issues it will be beneficial to all parties involved," said an Eli Lilly spokeswoman. 

   The donor's existence was revealed yesterday when a High Court judge set an Oct. 9 deadline for plaintiffs to decide whether to drop their lawsuits. 
The judge noted "a benefactor" was "prepared to offer to provide very substantial sums of money to fund" the 500 claimants' cases, describing the gift as "the 'Fairy Godparent's' generosity." 

   The lawsuits against Lilly and the British government seek unspecified damages. 
In 1985, Lilly pleaded guilty in U.S. court to 25 criminal counts for failing to inform U.S. officials about four deaths and six illnesses in Britain among patients taking the drug.

   Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, said a federal court in Philadelphia granted a request by Eli Lilly &amp; Co. to stop Medtronic until 1990 from making, using or selling devices to treat tachyarrhythmia, a heart condition. 

   A jury last month awarded Lilly $26.5 million in a patent infringement suit filed by Lilly in 1983 involving two patents for the devices. 
Medtronic, which makes implantable biomedical devices, said the final court order is expected next month. 
Lilly, Indianapolis, is a drug, medical-instruments and agricultural-products concern. 

   Medtronic said it disputes both the jury verdict and the injunction and intends to assert that position in post-trial proceedings. 
It added that clinical trials of these devices will continue outside the U.S. and commercial release is expected in several countries in 1989. 
It said it aims for entry into the U.S. market in the early 1990s. 

   Lilly said it is pleased that the court confirmed the enforceability of the patent and that it issued an injunction to prevent Medtronic from using the devices in the U.S. until Lilly's patent expires in 1990.

FT  16 JUL 94 / International Company News: Eli Lilly net steady at Dollars

<TEXT>
Eli Lilly, the US drug company that earlier this week announced the Dollars
4bn acquisition of PCS, a drug distributor, yesterday reported almost
unchanged net profits of Dollars 346.6m for its second quarter.
It blamed the lack of growth on several factors including higher
manufacturing costs, increased spending on research and development, and a
special charge of Dollars 10m relating to the previous quarter's recall of
three liquid oral antibiotics.
The volume of products sold surged by 11 per cent, both in the US market and
internationally, mainly because of increased sales of products such as
Prozac, Axid and Humulin. Turnover, however, grew by 8 per cent to Dollars
1.68bn because volume growth was partly offset by lower prices in the
pharmaceutical division.
Worldwide, Eli Lilly said, competitive pressures were particularly evident
in anti-infectives sales. In the US, lower prices resulted from increased
Medicaid rebates and greater participation in managed-care programmes.
The Dollars 10m special charge was in addition to the Dollars 56m charge
already provided for the product recall in the first quarter.
Net income was barely changed from the comparable quarter's Dollars 346.8m.
Earnings per share were up slightly, to Dollars 1.20 from Dollars 1.18. For
the half-year, net income was down 5 per cent to Dollars 677.3m.

   Food and Drug Administration investigators have reported that employees at Eli Lilly &amp; Co.'s Indianapolis plant submitted false or incomplete data to the FDA on some of the drugs it made. 

   In two instances, investigators wrote, the plant failed to report to the FDA that drugs failed tests for stability. 
Such tests indicate a drug's ability to work as promised after a certain amount of time. 

   Congressional investigators said they plan to examine those and other incidents cited by FDA investigators. 
"It's fair to say the committee is looking at that," said a staff member of the investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
"That goes to the question of obfuscation." 

   A Lilly spokesman said the incidents were "technical aberrations" and that the company is addressing them in its plan to fix the problems at the plant. 
Lilly has said it's reviewing its manufacturing operations and its goal is to "address all of the issues raised by the FDA." 
Last week, it halted the distribution of all drugs made at the Indianapolis plant and recalled 10 drugs. 

   In a related development, subcommittee Chairman John D. Dingell late yesterday asked Lilly for copies of company documents and records of inspections of its facilities from 1985 to the present, including a list of management at the Indianapolis plant. 
In a letter to Lilly Chairman Richard D. Wood, Mr. Dingell said the FDA report "confirmed that callous and cavalier business practices were commonplace" in the plant. 

   A Lilly spokesman said he couldn't comment because the company had not yet seen the letter. 

   Last week, Mr. Dingell asked the FDA for inspection records of more than 50 Lilly manufacturing plants. 
That request came in the wake of the investigators' findings of widespread problems at the Indianapolis plant, which makes drug tablets and capsules. 
The examination of Lilly, one of the biggest makers of brand-name drugs, marked a broadening of the subcommittee's investigation. 
It had been investigating alleged wrongdoing by makers of generic drugs. 

   Although an FDA spokesman said the investigation found "a number of objectionable practices," he said they are different from those found in the investigation of generic drug makers. 
For example, FDA officials said they have no evidence of fraud at Lilly. 

   In the stability tests, investigators said that four lots of the antibiotic Ilotycin showed failures for moisture, but that reports to the FDA didn't mention that. 
They also found that a 1985 Lilly report to the FDA extended the expiration date for the drug to four years from two even though stability for the marketed lots had those failures. 

   Moisture is one of a number of tests to check stability. 
Too much moisture, for example, can make a drug degrade more quickly and thus hurt its effectiveness. 
A Lilly spokesman said Ilotycin wasn't recalled and that the company considers the drug safe. 

   In a separate incident, the investigators said Lilly signed off on a validation for Darvon compound two years late and four days after the FDA started its investigation in April. 
They said the sign-off was contrary to Lilly's standard operating procedures and was done even though the product had long since been recalled. 

   Darvon compound is made up of the painkiller Darvon plus aspirin and caffeine. 

   Lilly has said the report doesn't call into question the safety or effectiveness of any of its products. 

   "They may be right," said Sidney Wolfe, who, as director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, has been a vocal critic of drug companies. 
"But if the company continued such widespread violations of the way drugs should be manufactured . . . sooner or later they might cause a lot of injuries." 

   The investigators also reported two instances when employees apparently signed records without seeing the processing steps they were verifying. 

   One instance involved weighing a batch of Darvocet-N 50, another painkiller. 
Accurate weights are such a vital part of the drug-making process that a second person is required to verify the weights. 

   But the investigators said they talked with a supervisor after finding that verification steps weren't recorded for certain lots of the painkiller. 

   "A few minutes later," the report states, " the supervisor was seen entering the tablet manufacturing room where {another lot} was being processed, and initialed the batch record without actually verifying the weights." 

   Although Lilly wouldn't comment about individual incidents in the report, its response to the FDA's inspection says its training program will "reinforce" its policy that employees "initial only those steps or actions that they perform, verify or observe." 

   The three FDA investigators spent four months examining the manufacturing and control systems of the plant. 
The 90-page report, which is unusually long for such investigations, details problems the investigators said they found "in nearly every area inspected."

   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said it received United Kingdom government approval to market Axid, a drug used to treat peptic ulcers. 
The product became available for marketing Monday. 

   The Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical concern said the oral medication belongs to a class of therapeutic agents that decrease production of stomach acid associated with peptic ulcers. 

   Lilly said Axid is under U.S. regulatory review and has been approved by Italy, Switzerland and France. 
The company said Axid will be marketed in those countries following receipt of government pricing approvals or completion of pricing reviews.

Approval to Sell
Growth Hormone

<TEXT>
   Eli Lilly &amp; Co. said it received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to market a new form of genetically engineered human growth hormone. 

   But Lilly's ability to market the drug may depend on the outcome of a lawsuit filed against the FDA by Genentech Inc., a biotechnology concern based in South San Francisco, Calif. 

   Lilly's new drug, called Humatrope, is used to treat certain forms of dwarfism in children induced by a hormone deficiency. 
It will compete with Protropin, a growth hormone drug that Genentech began marketing in 1985. 

   The two drugs have slightly different amino-acid sequences. 
While Lilly's drug is identical in chemistry and structure to the growth hormone produced by the human body, the Genentech drug contains one additional amino acid. 
Because of this, fewer patients have an immune reaction to Humatrope than to Protropin, Indianapolis-based Lilly said. 

   That difference could give Lilly a significant edge in the marketplace, some analysts said. 
But Genentech, in what could be a precedent-setting test of the FDA's 1983 "orphan" drug act, is fighting to keep the Lilly drug out of the marketplace. 

   Both drugs have been awarded orphan-drug status under the act, which was designed to spur research into drugs to treat diseases with fewer than 200,000 victims. 
Such status entitles their manufacturers to an exclusive seven-year marketing period before competitive pharmaceuticals can be approved. 
A new Genentech drug -- which, like Humatrope, contains one fewer amino acid -- hasn't been awarded orphan drug status. 

   Last week, Genentech sued the FDA in federal court in Washington seeking clarification of how the act applies to genetically engineered drugs. 
The biotechnology concern contends that its second version of Protropin is simply an "improved" product that warrants the orphan-drug status already granted to the original. 

   Genentech also charged that the agency may have violated the orphan-drug act by granting orphan status to the Lilly drug. 
It sought a temporary restraining order preventing the FDA from approving Humatrope. 
Although that motion was denied, a hearing on a preliminary injunction was set for March 26. 

   Genentech's suit, while addressing an important question for gene-splicing drug makers, is clearly aimed at protecting what the company sees as a lucrative market. 
Sales of Protropin, first developed in 1979 to treat certain forms of hormone-deficiency-related dwarfism in children, reached $43.6 million in 1986 -- its first full-year of marketing. 

   A Lilly spokesman refused to comment specifically on the Genentech suit. 
However, he said the company expects a "normal launch" of its drug within a few weeks.

FT  02 JUL 93 / International Company News: Moody's reviews debt rating at
Eli Lilly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOODY'S Investor Service, the US rating agency, is reviewing the long-term
debt of Eli Lilly, the US pharmaceuticals group, for possible downgrade from
its current Triple A rating.
Moody's said the review was provoked by concerns the company's product
pipeline might not generate enough revenues and profits to justify the
agency's highest rating. About Dollars 900m of long-term debt of Lilly and
guaranteed entities would be affected.
The review comes after last week's abrupt resignation of Mr Vaugh Bryson,
Lilly's chief executive, who had been in charge for just 20 months.
Mr Bryson took the blame for Lilly's disappointing sales and product
development, losing out in a boardroom struggle. He was replaced by Mr
Randall Tobias, a well-regarded vice-chairman at AT&amp;T.
Lilly this week suspended trials of the anti-viral drug Fialuridine (FIAU),
once thought to be a potential money-spinner. The drug, seen as a possible
cure for hepatitis B, was licensed by Lilly last year. It halted trials
after adverse side-effects, and will conduct further studies before deciding
whether tests will resume.
Moody's said: 'Without FIAU, Lilly's new product line is unusually lean for
the intermediate term and may be hard-pressed to offset the maturity of the
existing product portfolio.' It said the debt review would assess Lilly's
product pipeline, prospects for profitability, and the impact on capital.
Lilly is heavily dependent on sales of the anti-depressant, Prozac, which
faces increasing competition, and the anti-biotic, Ceclor, which lost part
of its patent protection last year, and will lose the rest in 1994. Sales of
new drugs, such as Lorabid, an intended replacement for Ceclor, have not
taken off.

Eli Lilly &amp; Co. has discontinued manufacturing 60 products and versions of 
products, according to a notification letter sent to drug wholesalers around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of several pharmaceutical wholesaling companies said that the 
products involved were either old or slow-selling and that the loss of the 
items will have little or no financial impact on them. 
</P>
<P>
"It shouldn't cause any problems. Our buyers reacted to it as a routine 
maintenance" of Lilly's product line, said a spokesman for Bergen Brunswig 
Corp., a California-based drug wholesaler. 
</P>
<P>
Lilly said it knows of no other manufacturers for 10 of the discontinued 
products, including two package sizes of 32 mg. Darvon capsules. However, other 
dosage sizes of Darvon are available. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, some packaging formats of Axid, Lilly's anti-ulcer drug, and of 
Keflex, an antibiotic, were discontinued, but Lilly continues to manufacture 
those products in other formats. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the products discontinued were among those cited in the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration's highly critical inspection report on Lilly's 
manufacturing practices issued last year.

FT  12 JUL 94 / Eli Lilly pays Dollars 4bn for distributor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Eli Lilly, the US drugs company, is to pay Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn) for
PCS, a drugs distributor, in the third big acquisition of its kind in the US
in less than a year.
PCS, a subsidiary of San Francisco-based McKesson, claims to sell drugs to
50m Americans under various healthcare programmes, with drugs sales last
year of Dollars 6.4bn, making it the biggest company of its type.
The planned deal is the latest sign of the rush by drugs companies to secure
distribution for their products in the US, the world's biggest
pharmaceuticals market. Faced with pressure to hold down prices,
manufacturers have sought to build market share by buying distribution
companies or by gaining preferential treatment for their drugs.
If completed, the deal will leave three of the biggest US distributors under
the control of pharmaceuticals manufacturers. Last year, Merck paid Dollars
6.7bn for Medco Containment Services, while SmithKline Beecham recently
agreed to acquire Diversified Pharmaceutical Services for Dollars 2.3bn.
McKesson had discussed a sale of its retail distribution arm to other
manufacturers, but did not hold a formal auction of the company, PCS said.
Following other links between distributors and manufacturers, it was the
only big retail distributor left on the market.
In London, shares in Glaxo, which had been rumoured to be interested in PCS,
fell 8p to 563p. The main reason, said analysts, was that a substantial
proportion of US patients would now be more difficult for Glaxo to reach,
particularly with its top-selling anti-ulcer drug Zantac.
Merck, SmithKline Beecham and now Eli Lilly would each push their respective
anti-ulcer products, Pepcid, Tagamet and Axid, through their newly acquired
prescription management benefit companies, explained Mr Duncan Moore,
pharmaceuticals analyst at Morgan Stanley.
These subsidiaries claim to have nearly 50m people covered by their
formularies. 'This is a material tightening of the screws for Glaxo,' he
said.
PCS claimed that it would continue to make available the most beneficial and
cost-effective drugs to its customers after the deal, regardless of who
manufactured them. 'The deal was not done for us to market Lilly's drugs
over other companies.'
The structure of the deal still leaves McKesson open to higher offers for
PCS. Lilly has launched a tender offer for McKesson's shares. It said it
would spin off all of McKesson's businesses other than PCS into a new
company, shares in which would be distributed to existing McKesson
shareholders. 'It does open the door to other offers,' PCS said yesterday.
News of the deal drove McKesson shares up by a third yesterday morning, to
Dollars 98 1/8 . By contrast, Eli Lilly's shares slid 12 per cent to Dollars
50 1/4 on fears that it was paying too much for the acquisition. The
all-cash purchase would be financed with short and medium-term debt, Eli
Lilly said. Moody's, the US credit rating agency, said it would review the
company's debt for a possible downgrade.

<HEAD>Four Big Drug Companies Report Higher Earnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Four major U.S.-based pharmaceutical companies reported sharply
higher third-quarter results Tuesday, led in part by strong sales
growth at home and abroad for disease-fighting drugs.
   The results reported by Warner Lambert Co., Merck &amp; Co., Eli
Lilly and Co. and Pfizer Inc. also reflected the declining strength
of the dollar, which inflates the value of sales in other countries
when calculated in dollars.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Warner-Lambert</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Warner-Lambert, based in Morris Plains, N.J., said earnings for
the three months ended Sept. 30 totaled $124.76 million or 93 cents
a share, up 16.7 percent from $106.92 million or 79 cents a share a
year in the 1989 third quarter. The year-earlier per-share figures
were restated to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split this past May.
   Third-quarter sales rose to $1.19 billion, a quarterly record,
up 7 percent from $1.11 billion a year earlier.
   Joseph D. Williams, chairman and chief executive officer,
attributed the results to the strength of the company's worldwide
pharmaceutical business, led by prescription drug sales, notably in
the cholesterol-regulating drug Lopid.
   Non-prescription drug sales also rose, paced by strong
performance of Listerine mouthwash and Halls cough tablets. The
gums and mints segment, which includes brands such as Certs,
Chiclets and Sugar Daddy, fell slightly.
   For the nine months, Warner-Lambert said earnings totaled
$379.54 million or $2.83 a share, up 18.5 percent from $320.36
million or $2.37 a share a year earlier. Sales totaled $3.44
billion vs. $3.15 billion, up 9.2 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Merck</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Merck, a Rahway, N.J.-based maker of health products and
specialty chemicals, said third-quarter earnings rose 19 percent to
$465 million or $1.19 a share, from $390.5 million or 99 cents a
share a year earlier.
   Sales for the quarter rose 17 percent to $1.91 billion from
$1.63 billion a year earlier.
   The company reported gains in all operations and said there was
particularly strong demand for its pediatric vaccine M-M-R II,
which protects against measles, mumps and rubella. The Centers for
Disease Control strengthened its recommended dosage of the vaccine
in response to higher incidence of measles infections in the United
States.
   For the nine months, Merck said earnings totaled $1.34 billion
or $3.42 a share, up 18.5 percent from $1.13 billion or $2.85 a
share a year earlier. Sales totaled $5.57 billion vs. $4.79
billion, up 16.3 percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Eli Lilly</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Eli Lilly, headquartered in Indianapolis, said third-quarter
earnings rose 21 percent to a record $257 million or 90 cents a
share, vs. $212.4 million or 73 cents a share a year earlier.
   Chairman Richard D. Wood attributed the strength to higher sales
at home and abroad, led by demand for the antidepressant drug
Prozac and other pharmaceuticals.
   For the nine months, Lilly earned $872 million or $2.99 a share,
up 22 percent from $714.2 milloin or $2.45 a share a year earlier.
Nine-month sales totaled $3.75 billion vs. $3.03 billion, up 23.7
percent.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Pfizer</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Pfizer, a New York-based maker of health care and consumer
products and specialty drugs, said third-quarter earnings totaled
$243.3 million or $1.45 a share, up 12 percent from $217.5 million
or $1.29 a share a year earlier. Quarterly sales totaled $1.64
billion vs. $1.44 billion, up 14 percent.
   The company said strong growth in pharmaceutical sales was paced
by the cardiovascular agent Procardia XL and antifungal drug
Diflucan.
   For the nine months, Pfizer said earnings totaled $646.4 million
or $3.85 a share, up 8.8 percent from $594 million or $3.52 a share
a year earlier. Sales for the period totaled $4.62 billion, up 10.5
percent from $4.18 billion.
