   Best known for growing tulips in the
spring, this Dutch town soon may be famous for melting snow in the
winter.
   When the snow begins to fall _ and an average of 100 inches fall
here each winter _ warm water from the city's power plant will be
pumped through a grid of plastic pipes underneath downtown streets
and sidewalks, melting the snow and ice.
   No longer will customers dread looking for parking spots between
huge mounds of shoveled snow or risk slipping on icy patches as
they window shop. Gone will be the days shopkeepers spend more time
behind a shovel than a cash register.
   The project, called ``snowmelt,'' is similar to systems used for
decades in northern Europe and Scandinavian countries.
   But the one being installed under streets and sidewalks along
three downtown blocks here is the largest of its kind in the United
States, according to the system's engineers. It's expected to be
completed in time for the first snowfall.
   Underground systems that use electricity or steam are being used
on a smaller scale, such as in driveways and parking lots of
various U.S. cities, said Pieter Dekker, project director for the
city's Board of Public Works.
   A larger snowmelt system using water is being installed at a
Minneapolis mall to replace an aging underground heating-mat
system, but that won't be completed until 1991.
   ``It's designed so that the snow melts almost instantaneously as
it hits the ground,'' Dekker said. ``In theory, there should never
be an accumulation.''
   When the project was introduced earlier this year, it was met
with skepticism _ especially among downtown shopkeepers displeased
with having to share its $1.1 million pricetag with the city.
   But when local industrialist Edgar Prince, who has a
mini-snowmelt system in his private driveway, agreed to kick in
$250,000 for the project and $25,000 a year toward the annual
$100,000 operating costs, store owners warmed to the idea.
   Holland already had committed itself to a $2 million downtown
beautification project that was going to demolish streets to put in
new brick sidewalks, landscaping and mini-parks as well new utility
and sewer lines.
   The warm water to be used in system is a byproduct of the power
plant, which is less than a mile from downtown and is now dumping
the water in Lake Macatawa.
   The water will wind through the 58 twisted miles of plastic
pipes at a constant temperature of 51 degrees year-round, but may
be turned up during heavy snowfalls.
   Already, officials from other communities are visiting Holland
to find out more about the snowmelt system.
   ``Historically, older downtowns die when shopping malls come in;
the core of the city becomes an eyesore of abandoned buildings,''
said John Hutchinson, former chairman of the city's Mainstreet
Committee. The committee was formed three years ago when the city
was designated a ``Main Street'' community by the National Trust
for Historic Preservation.
   Since then, developers have taken advantage of low-interest
loans to renovate decaying facades of older buildings, instead of
tearing them down to build new ones.
   ``We're determined that Holland, Mich., is not going to follow
that pattern,'' said Hutchinson, an attorney whose wife owns a
downtown children's clothing shop.
   While Holland's attempts to revitalize its downtown and compete
with suburban shopping malls are noteworthy, a strong foundation
already was in place.
   The city's tulip festival draws hundreds of thousands of
visitors each May, its state park beach on Lake Michigan is
considered Michigan's busiest, and Holland's Dutch heritage _
reflected in wooden shoe shops and windmills _ has made it a
popular stop for tourists.
   Most shopkeepers are enthusiastic about the snowmelt system,
even as construction temporarily deters customers.
   But some aren't so sure.
   ``The problem is you won't see the pavement unless you go there.
And the people who don't like to go downtown won't go there in the
middle of winter just because the snow melts,'' said Tim Jenks, a
small-business consultant and former Mainstreet Committee member.
   Still, with proper promotion, its novelty could make it a
success, he said. ``I believe you can bring people downtown with a
snowmelt system or with a three-humped camel. It's all a matter of
how you promote it.''

DESCANSO GARDENS SPRINGING INTO BLOOM WITH ANNUAL FLOWER FEST
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Today marks the beginning of a monthlong celebration devoted entirely to
beauty: The Festival of Spring Flowers at Descanso Gardens.
</P>
<P>
The festival begins with the Pasadena Garden Club's two-day flower show and
continues through April 22 when the San Fernando Valley Rose Society holds its
annual rose show and sale.
</P>
<P>
According to George Lewis, Descanso Gardens superintendent-horticulturist, the
festival is one of the world's greatest flower shows. Visitors will see a
panorama of annuals, perennials and flowering trees and shrubs.
</P>
<P>
Visualize hundreds of thousands of flowers in a tranquil, spacious setting.
There are miles of paths throughout the 165-acre grounds.
</P>
<P>
Lewis says the festival is designed to be "free and flowing." Most flower shows
last only a few days; while the flowers may be at their peaks at the beginning
of the show, they deteriorate toward the end. By using growing flowers,
Descanso Gardens assures visitors of spectacular blooms the entire month.
</P>
<P>
For an introduction and overall view of the gardens, Lewis suggests that
visitors take the 45-minute guided tram tour.
</P>
<P>
One of Descanso's most prominent attractions is the Camellia Forest. Here is
one of the largest plantings of camellias in the world -- thousands of shrubs
featuring more than 600 varieties. Some of the shrubs are almost 50 years old
and more than 20 feet tall. Showing large blooms in white, pink, rose, scarlet
and variegated pink and white and red and white, the shrubs are nestled among
California live oak trees.
</P>
<P>
A special feature of the 25-acre Camellia Forest is the display of a type of
camellia called "reticulatea," which has huge, wavy blooms measuring up to nine
inches in diameter. The reticulate varieties were discovered in China during
World War II. Ten varieties were brought to Descanso from the Kunming Temple of
China in 1948.
</P>
<P>
Bulbs -- more than 30,000 tulips, 10,000 daffodils, 2,000 glads and thousands
of others -- have been specially placed for the festival.
</P>
<P>
Descanso offers the largest flowering collection of tulips on the West Coast
with more than 15 varieties planted in the Tulip Walk and along other bedding
areas.
</P>
<P>
Other special features of the Festival of Spring Flowers include a landscape
designer-created Display Garden, an Old English Garden, an Award-Winning Iris
Garden and beds of annuals and other plants.
</P>
<P>
In the Display Garden, designers have created displays to suit different
landscaping needs.
</P>
<P>
The Old English Garden is across from the Tram Station and features plants
found in an old English countryside garden -- hollyhock, day lilies,
snapdragons, foxglove, buddeleja, penstemon and others.
</P>
<P>
The Iris Garden displays gold cup and silver medal winners.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the gardens, Lewis has extensively incorporated a concept he calls
"two-story bloom," planting bulbs among beds of low-growing annuals.
</P>
<P>
The regular attractions at Descanso Gardens also warrant a visit during the
festival.
</P>
<P>
* Two rose gardens -- Modern Roses and Roses of Yesterday -- are found on the
grounds. Only the Modern Roses garden will have bloom during the festival. It
features an array of hybrid tea roses.
</P>
<P>
* Bird fanciers will appreciate the Bird Observation Station. The ponds are a
regular stopping point for wild waterfowl and other birds.
</P>
<P>
* Azalea varieties in the gardens will begin their bloom, as will many native
plants.
</P>
<P>
* Descanso Gardens has the largest collection of native live oak trees in
Southern California, as well as redwoods, pines, cedars, firs and flowering
fruit trees that should be at their peak during the festival.
</P>
<P>
Descanso Gardens is at 1418 Descanso Drive, La Canada Flintridge. Open daily
except Christmas Day. Hours: 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Admission: adults $3; seniors
and students $1.50; children 5-12 75 cents, and children under 5 free. Tram
tour of the gardens: $1.50. For information, call (818) 790-5414.

FT  16 APR 94 / Outdoors: The aphid that made millions - The Dutch are
celebrating 400 years of tulips / Garden history
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
According to an opinion poll, most Americans do not know where Holland is
but they can easily tell you where tulips come from.
Perhaps fewer Americans know the extraordinary history of this bloom, once
prized above the riches of princes, now produced for the millions, yet still
touched by the magic of its exotic past. Tulip bulbs saved many of the Dutch
from death in the darkest years of Nazi occupation, and they have helped to
keep them prosperous ever since.
It is understandable that the Netherlands wants to celebrate; it has chosen
1994 as the 400th anniversary of the flowering of tulips flowered in the
Dutch province of Holland (no matter that the date is doubtful) and is
marking the event with pageants, tours, an exhibition at the Frans Hals
Museum in Haarlem and one in the autumn at Amsterdam's Nieuwe Kirche,
adorned with unseasonal 'ice tulips'.
The identification of tulips with Holland goes back to the epidemic of
'tulip mania' between 1635 and the crash in 1637 (which showed remarkable
parallels with more modern commodity and price spirals). However, some say
that the warm sentiment inspired by tulips arose relatively recently. This
year is the 50th anniversary of the Hunger Winter of 1944, when the Dutch
starved under German occupation and people were reduced to grubbing up bulbs
from the tulip fields. Some restaurants are putting tulip dishes on the
menu, a gimmick which may say as much about residual anti-German feeling as
about sentimentality towards tulips.
The first recorded tulip flowerings in Holland were at Leiden, in neatly
hedged beds in the hortus botanicus in autumn 1593. They belonged to the
botanist Charles de l'Ecluse. Clusius, as he was known, was by then an old
man, head-hunted for the new university. For more than 30 years he had been
at the imperial court in Vienna, growing and studying tulips brought from
Turkey.
By 1594 tulips were being grown in grand gardens in the German-speaking
lands, in France, and England. Indeed, it is recorded that many years before
he moved to the Netherlands, Clusius sent a present of bulbs to a Dutch
gentleman. No doubt they flowered . . .
Pedantry aside, Leiden can claim to be the cradle of the Dutch bulb
industry. Clusius and his head-gardener, quaintly called Clutius, settled
down to propagating the priceless tulip collection. They sold bulbs at
exorbitant prices to courtiers and country gentlemen.
The breakthrough came only after a break-in, when thieves smashed their way
into the hortus botanicus, stole the tulip collection, and dispersed it to
the nursery trade.
Tulip growing and breeding became a passionate pursuit of rich amateur
gardeners throughout northern Europe. Because they hybridise easily and
produce 'sports' or mutations, tulips were soon being produced in an
extraordinary range of sizes, colours, shapes, and in the case of the most
expensive, with the most fabulously patterned blooms. Vividly striped,
blotched and flamed tulips (much later called 'Rembrandt' type) were the
most expensive.
By the 1620s, tulip bulbs had become plentiful enough for at least the lowly
varieties to be widely available. But the extraordinary thing about tulips
was their propensity to change dazzlingly from one season to the next.
Unique among flowers, they will spontaneously 'break' or 'rectify',
reappearing the next spring with gorgeously patterned petals. These tulips
took their place among the costliest luxuries of the day.
Grow just a few bulbs, and you could find you had the lucky break, which
made tulips ripe for an investment gamble. Without the breaking, there would
not have been the kind of interest which led to a speculative mania
notorious in the annals of capitalism.
A rampant futures markets developed, tulips changing hands many times but
only on paper. Men made and lost fortunes.
In 1623, a Semper Augustus bulb, red and white, fetched Fl 1,000 - around
Pounds 350. Average income was around Fl 150. Next year, the price was Fl
1,200; by 1635, the price was Fl 5,500. Then the massive inflation began and
in 1637, at the height of the market, a Semper August fetched the equivalent
of Pounds 3,300. One bulb cost as much as a house on Amsterdam's smartest
canal, with a coach-house and garden.
Why did tulips break? There were many theories, ranging from the influence
of the planets to insect infestation. The answer was found only in 1919. It
was a virus, TBV, commonly spread by aphids, which by breaking up the
anthocyanin pigment causes the exceptionally intense hues and patterns.
The discovery was the death-knell of the Rembrandt. The flower of the Dutch
Golden Age was merely sickly, diseased and horribly contagious. As Stanley
Killingback, a modern tulip expert remarks: 'The beauty of such flowers is
the beauty of death.' Clusius, too, noted that a broken tulip fizzles out
within a season or two. He thought the breaking was a floral equivalent of a
swansong, to reward its owner.
Tulip mania remains an astonishing tribute to the appeal of flowers that
were valued as if they were gold plate or pearls. Today, tulip prices are at
an historic low, and sales are declining. Tulip 400 celebrates a passion
which has long been waning among gardeners. In the last 20 years, the number
of growers has dropped from 15,000 to 3,510.
Yet even after four centuries of breeding, the hybridisers see a chink
ahead. Extraordinary things may yet emerge from the bulb-sheds. Tissue
culture has reduced the time it takes to bring a new variety to market -
from 20 years to around seven. In the 1930s, they used radiation to make
weird new varieties. Frans Roozen, head of the technical section of the
International Bulb Centre talk of using colchicine, a poison favoured by
Dutch witches, to cross tulips with narcissi and make 'a purple daffodil'.
Genetic engineering is a better bet for the rainbow tulips of the future.
According to hybridiser Piet Koopman of Pico Bello, the true blue tulip is a
possibility if scientists can identify the purple chromasome in the iris
family and inject it into tulip bulbs. Four centuries have taken the tulip a
long way from the small, highly priced flower which Clusius named, 'A lovely
tulip of a most elegant colour'.

<LEADPARA>  IT HAPPENS every spring. Holland becomes a vast patchwork of undulating color
as blossoms of red, gold, blue, pink, yellow and purple blanket the Dutch

varieties of tulips, hyacinths and other exquisite blooms sway smoothly,
forming a sea of color that stretches as far as the eye can see.  </LEADPARA>

Additional information attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The centerpiece of Holland's flower fields is the Keukenhof Gardens, a
70-acre private park outside the charming town of Lisse, about 30 minutes
outside Amsterdam.;    Open to the public for six weeks each spring, Keukenhof
has some six million bulbs, some bursting into rare or unusually colored
tulips, hyacinths, dahlias, daffodils, crocuses, irises and gladioluses.;
The 42nd annual exhibition takes place March 28 to May 20 this year. It is
preceded on March 27 by the Keukenhof's annual Flower Parade, a fantastic
procession of flower-laden floats depicting elaborate home gardens, shade
gardens and gardens planned by color.;    Holland's top bulb growers support
and maintain the Keukenhof and show their best blooms in the artfully arranged
gardens that cover the park's well manicured grounds. Legions of gardeners
constantly groom the lavish flower beds by cutting slightly fading blossoms
and handing them to passers by.;    The park's protective hothouses exhibit
fragile or new breeds of flowers. These often show rare or unexpected colors
or unusual size. There are bowers of sweet-scented freesias, salmon-colored
lillium and tulips that are such an intense and deep purple they appear black
at first glance.;    Special pavilions, named for members of Holland's royal
family, are set up for orchid, lily and amaryllis displays. In the pavilions
and the hothouses, florists demonstrate how to make beautiful flower
arrangements.;    In the midst of this splendid floral spectacle are practical
touches, including several public picnic areas set on landscaped terraces,
play areas for children, snack bars and souvenir shops.;    The name
Keukenhof, Dutch for "kitchen garden," suggests that such an abundance of
blooms might not be extraordinary. In fact, flower-growing is a major industry
in Holland; both blooms and bulbs are cheap. But when the first tulip was
imported from Turkey and planted in Leiden in 1558, each rare bulb cost what
was then the equivalent of $200.;    Of course, no kitchen garden could boast
Keukenhof's six million spring bulbs, but a row or two of tulips or grouping
of hyacinths can enhance any patch of land. An ideal souvenir from the
Keukenhof's selling stalls is a pre-packaged selection of bulbs cleared by the
U.S. agriculture department for planting at home.;     If you go . . .; The
Keukenhof is open from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. daily. Admission is $9 for adults
or $4.50 for children. For visitors in wheelchairs it is free; senior citizen
tickets are discounted.;    The park is a short drive from Lisse, which is
between Haarlem and Leiden. Tours of the Keukenhof leave from Amsterdam's
central bus station morning and afternoon. They take about 3 1/2 hours and
cost about $30 for adults, $15 for children, including admission. An
alternative is riding the train from Amsterdam to Haarlem or Leiden, then
taking a short bus ride to Lisse's center and a shuttle bus to the Keukenhof.
Combination rail-bus-admission tickets cost about $16.;    KLM's air fares
(seven- to 14-day stay with 30-day advance booking) from New York to Amsterdam
are from $714 for travel between March 22 and May 31. KLM's Europe by Design
Tours (from $869 for air fare, hotel for four nights in Amsterdam, continental
breakfasts, ground transfers and a Holland Leisure Card covering admission to
museums and other discounts) feature a Keukenhof add-on for $47.;    For
additional information contact the Netherlands Board of Tourism, 355 Lexington
Ave., New York, N.Y. 10017; (212) 370-7367.  </TEXT>

FT  12 NOV 94 / Gardening: Bulbs for long-term growth - Tulips offer
satisfying returns to the careful investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All year, tulip-growers have been celebrating the 400th anniversary of the
tulip's first flowering in Holland; today, we celebrate its birthday with
theological correctness as a chapter in the history Mammon
Within 40 years of the tulip's first flowering, people were already
speculating in it madly. Instead of planting it, they bought tulip-futures,
sold them to the next man and left the bother of delivery and gardening to
the last mutt in the chain. Perhaps we should reintroduce them for
non-gardening readers in the winter. After the market crashed, one great
academic could never look a tulip in the face again. So many fortunes had
been lost that he would attack the tulips with a stick whenever he passed
them. I will be doing the same with dollars, if they carry on down.
Meanwhile, non-speculators ought to be planting their tulips during this
weekend and the next three. They prefer a sunny, well-drained soil and at
least 3 ins of it above the tops of their bulbs. If you plant them up to
9ins deep, they are safe from passing forks and can be left in the ground
for years. Nonetheless, many of them will not persist. Deep or shallow, they
will flower in the first year, dwindle in the second and disappear in the
third.
The growers tell us to dig them up each year in late May, bury them lightly
in a secondary bed and then pick them over in autumn to eliminate those
which have shrunk. These bulblets can then be replanted and grown on for up
to three years, like a small business, until they are ready again for public
display. I have never had the patience for this routine. Instead, I add a
dressing of potash fertiliser and dig it lightly into the surface of the
soil after planting. It helps to delay the dwindling.
Why do tulips deteriorate? I know three reasons. They miss the rich, silty
soil of Holland or Lincolnshire where the sellers grow them. There is
nothing we can do about that unless we move to the Netherlands.
Alternatively, they may have been eaten by slugs; an expert grower tells me
that this problem is much more widespread than other experts realise. Last
winter, slugs ate the leaves on all my scillas and I bet they had a go at
the tulips. The best defence is deep planting, down to 9ins, below the
slug-line. A top dressing of slug killer is worth the effort.
The third reason is the most regrettable. Many of the most impressive modern
varieties are simply not tough enough for full-size flowering after a year
or two in Britain's unimpressive garden soils. I have learned to prefer
proven varieties and choose the easier of the wild forms which are much
tougher.
If you want one persistent hybrid tulip, choose the one which has lasted
longest in the lists: pink Clara Butt. She has become less familiar nowadays
but she outlasts all others in her class. I also find that the lily-flowered
varieties retain their size of flower for many years. I have three proven
favourites: the yellow West Point, which is a real winner, the deep satin
China Pink, and the tall White Triumphator. So many of the other colours
shrink from year to year but if I was speculating for one season I would
always choose white Carrara, pink and white striped Marilyn, which looks so
stylish in pots, and the lovely lemon yellow Sweet Harmony, which is edged
with white. This spring, I saw several gardens where four or five
well-chosen varieties had been mixed in a multi-coloured cluster. The effect
was fresh, a change from those solemn lines of yellow, then pink which you
see in parks or on the mudflats by Dutch windmills. Nurserymen's mixtures
include some awful carmines but you can mix a selection for yourself.
The best value of all is found in the smaller forms which are closer to the
wild. The white tulip which lasts longest is the short Tulip fosteriana
Purissima; the most persistent striped form is the plain Water Lily tulip,
or kaufmanniana, which is a mixture of ivory yellow and red. Avoid its other
forms, seductively named after great musicians, because most of them are not
harmonious. Recently, I have learnt to value the lilac and yellow flowers of
Tulip bakeri Lilac Wonder, whose flowers open widely in April and have
persisted very well in a sharp, sunny soil. You would not expect a wild
tulip from central Asia to be reliable in the British midlands but I have
also had long life from the lovely soft yellow Tulip batalinii.
The nearer you return to the wild, the more stamina you find in many tulips.
They grow naturally from Greece to central Asia but it is extraordinary that
the ancient Greeks never mentioned them, although they lived with their
flowers each spring. They seem to puzzle their successors too. Not long ago,
I looked across a Greek olive grove of wild tulips in the company of two
great ancient historians who remarked that they never realised that the
Greeks imported so many tulips from Holland. Perhaps these non-botanists
would prefer tulip-futures instead, but we would have to take away their
walking-sticks if they lost bets.

   I came late to tulips.
Until about five years ago, I didn't much like the turban flowers: too big, too bold -- too hybrid?
Then, an imperious gardening mentor of 80 plant-opinionated years presented me a Christmas bag of tulips -- big reds -- Giant Darwin Hybrids.
To be polite, I planted them. (Such unsubtle flowers could easily become cut flowers before they disrupted the strict color code of my studiously understated garden.)

   Instead, that spring, the Darwins put the kibosh on my tulip prejudice.
They were too big, too bright, too red, but they were also tulipically fragranced, had spectacular black basal blotches, and such light-responsive calisthenic petals that I could tell time by tulip.

   Thus began my tulipomania.
Soon the Darwins were joined by Cottage, Triumph, Emperor, Peony, Lily-flowering, Viridiflora, Breeder and my favorites, the Parrot, Rembrandt and Bizarre, those highly inflamed flowers whose color had been fractured by the tulip-breaking virus.

   Last fall, for a change of tulip, I ordered three of the species, or botanicals, the small, supposedly wild -- primitive, at any rate -- Mediterranean antecedents of the big Dutch hybrids: T. Turkestanica, T. dasystemon and T. Saxatilis.
On April 1, in 31-degree weather, Turkestanica began its long bloom run: clusters of dainty, very-lily-white flowers with yellow baseblots, five or so to a five-inch stem.
On April 14 dasystemon, yellow and white, piquant of face and low down to the ground, came on, followed on May Day by a single saxatilis bloom that knocked an out-loud "WOW!" from me.
The flower had an old-rose-pink cup, charming yellow bottom, patent-leather-shiny green leaves and a stunning fragrance.
So taken was I by these T.s I scarcely paid mind all spring to the loud, brassy hybrids breaking and flaming and feathering nearby, though I was still getting my noon time-fix by sighting on the flat-out petals of the big red Darwins.

   Thus began my mini-tulipomania, my mini-manic expectations fueled by happening on the Chicago flower-bulb brokerage firm of McClure &amp; Zimmerman's "Continuing Education Series on Bulbs for American Gardens: WILD TULIPS OF THE WORLD."
The Mc. &amp; Z. catalog had 33 different unhybridized tulips and guaranteed that all had been "harvested from commercial sources."
Next came the White Flower Farm catalog with eight wild T.s and the wisdom of that fictitious house sage Amos Pettingill that these tulips were "more perennial than the conventional" ones.
Most of the other fall catalogs also listed at least a few of the wild tulipae.
I began to suspect a wild-tulipo-trend.

   While awaiting the tiny tulips I read about them.
I was immediately diverted by Louise Beebe Wilder's "Adventures With Hardy Bulbs" (1936), in which the redoubtable Mrs. Wilder, faced by an earlier wild-T. boomlet, opined: "American gardeners are beginning to realize something of {the wild tulips'} fascination, and the attitude toward them has become much less oblique . . . but on the whole, the great hybrid Tulips, the Darwins, Cottages, Breeders (Single Late) and the like, still successfully hold the stage against the wild species."
A generic American bulb scold, she complained: "There are not enough bulbous plants grown in this country."

   Of T. acuminata, the Fireflame Tulip, Mrs. Wilder wrote: "This fantastic plant . . . is said to have appeared among gardeners about 1816 from the general direction of the Levant."
To her, "the very long and narrow segments suggest the finger nails of the mandarin." (To Mc. &amp; Z.: "We plant it as a 'shocker' to confound friends who've never seen a wacky tulip before.")
Mrs. Wilder seems to dote on Tulipa sylvestris, "this charming tramp" (a k a the Wild British Tulip) that has a "small butter-yellow flower with the scent of hothouse violets . . . the shy grace common to most wild things," and advises that it be allowed to dwell in peace "not pressed upon by stout perennials."
She relates Linnaeus's observation that "the flowers of this species do not open before 10 o'clock in the morning, whereas those of the garden Tulip are wide open before eight." (Yet another chronoflower.)
T. dasystemon, "a small wonder of a Tulip," and perhaps her favorite, has "leaves lying flat upon the ground like a star-fish . . . charming fragrant blossoms . . . from Turkestan," while T. Clusiana, the Lady Tulip, is "gay and charming" and "named for the great botanist Clusius, who cultivated it in his garden in Flanders."
T. persica is "this lovely dwarf . . . from Persia . . . very fragrant.
Do not miss it."
T. linifolia is "this small bit of brilliance" from northern Persia with "a dark blotch at the heart," while T. pulchella is, simply, "a delightful mite."
The Cretan tulip, saxatilis, however, she charges with "stinginess of behavior," this species having "never seen fit to give me a single flower.
After the manner of Tulips generally, if it is not going to bloom, it sends up a single leaf, not apparently wishing to leave one under any misapprehension as to its intentions."
And while Mrs. Wilder cautions readers not to expect from species tulips the sort of life everlasting common to daffodils and crocuses, nevertheless if happily situated in a hot, sunny, sharply drained spot, the little tulips "will outstay the great hybrid Tulips that are planted in millions every year -- a truth I have not before seen brought forward in their favor."

   My tulipomanias peaked just as the stock market crashed the other Monday, when I was immersed in reading about the infamous Dutch market crash of 1637 that ended the spectacular three-year tulip-futures lunacy -- the original Tulipomania.
In "The Embarrassment of Riches," Simon Schama writes: "By early 1637, the height of the speculation, the point of the purchase had long since ceased to be a tulip bulb and instead had become a negotiable piece of paper."
By February, "amid conditions of general panic in Haarlem, bulb prices were dropping by the hour, and . . . there was talk of stock becoming unsalable.
As for tulip futures, these had become worthless."

   If you still want to place a forward order on "wild" tulip bulbs -- and why not? the downside is sharply limited -- try any of the following: McClure &amp; Zimmerman, 1422 West Thorndale, Chicago, Ill. 60660; White Flower Farm, Litchfield, Conn. 06759-0050; The New York Botanical Garden, Bronx, N.Y. 10458-5126; Wayside Gardens, Hodges, S.C. 29695-0001; John D. Lyon Co., 143 Alewife Brook Parkway, Cambridge, Mass. 02140; John Scheepers, Philipsburg Road, R.D. 2, Middletown, N.Y. 10940.

GARDENER KEEPS 170 FLOWER BEDS IN HEART OF WASHINGTON FILLED;

HE'S GOT THE BLOOMING SITUATION IN HAND

<P>
The capital is awash in daffodils, masses of tulips proclaim the arrival of
spring, and Milton Boston already is worrying about planting thousands of
geraniums, petunias and marigolds for the summer.
</P>
<P>
Boston is chief floral gardener for the National Park Service in downtown
Washington, the generalissimo with rake and hoe who oversees the yearlong
planting of 170 flower beds from the Capitol to the Kennedy Center.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
186,150 Tulips Planted
</P>
<P>
His job might seem staggering to back-yard putterers. For a month in late fall,
the efficient, unflappable Boston and his crew of eight gardeners were busy
planting 186,150 tulips, 108,300 daffodils and 22,000 pansies, all of which
bloom in the spring.
</P>
<P>
Those flowers are removed by early May. The soil is tilled, fumigated with weed
and pest killers, conditioned with perlite and peat moss and planted with
bright, hardy annuals for Washington's hot summer months. They are weeded and
fertilized until they die in the first frost. Then, they are replaced with
about 3,000 chrysanthemums. Eventually, the beds are cleared and the cycle
starts again in November.
</P>
<P>
Boston, a 26-year Park Service veteran, is especially proud of the "tulip
library," a broad, looping cluster of 95 small beds of the clarions of spring
that lies near the Tidal Basin south of the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
95 Different Varieties
</P>
<P>
This elaborate garden contains 15,000 tulips, most of them imported from
Holland. Each of the 95 beds contains a different variety, with names as
dazzling as their colors -- Queen of Night, Merry Widow, Apeldoorn, Oriental
Splendor, Smiling Queen, Flaming Parrot, Estella Rijnveld.
</P>
<P>
It is so impressive that it won an admiring tribute from the Dutch Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Boston says that he gets "great satisfaction" from his work, which delights the
more than 23 million tourists who visit Washington's national parks and
monuments each year.
</P>
<P>
"This is always what I wanted to do," said Boston, 45, who grew up on his
father's farm in eastern North Carolina and migrated to Washington after high
school. "All my life, I've been used to growing things."
</P>
<P>
His annual $330,000 budget includes the cost of plants and bulbs purchased
wholesale from growers, many from neighboring Maryland and Virginia, on the
basis of competitive bids.
</P>
<P>
During plantings, Boston's crew begins work at 6 a.m. and can leave a flower
bed blazing with color before the morning rush hour is over.
</P>
<P>
"They really work hard and do a good job," Boston said of his eight Park
Service helpers. "They're all gardeners, and they know what they're doing. They
can plant 20,000 bulbs in one day."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Flowers Seldom Stolen
</P>
<P>
In a city beset by violent crime, Boston is pleased that his flowers are almost
never stolen, except by an occasional panhandler intent on selling them for
spare change.
</P>
<P>
"I guess people enjoy them so they don't take them," he said. "About the only
problem is when people stand in the beds to pose for pictures and mash the
flowers down."
</P>
<P>
Boston said he once had "the best-looking yard in the neighborhood" in suburban
Capitol Heights, Md., where he lives with his wife and two children, "but, in
this job, I don't have the time anymore to take care of it."
</P>
<P>
His loss is Washington's gain.

   First, the flowering bulbs, along with forsythia, cherry and
spirea. Then the azaleas. The dogwoods and redbuds are likely to
blossom for a month and tie in the bloom of the tulips with that of
the azaleas.
   That's the fragrant picture promoted by William Alexander,
landscape manager at Biltmore Estate in Asheville, N.C., where the
``Festival of Flowers'' takes place April 14 through May 13.
   Biltmore House, a turn-of-the-century 250-room French
Renaissance chateau amid the Blue Ridge Mountains, will be
surrounded by 50,000 Dutch tulips, hundreds of varieties of azaleas
and native dogwoods, he says.
   Wines produced at the Biltmore Estate Winery will be featured
during the festival. Adult admission to the estate, which ranges
from $14 to $18.95 for daytime visitors, $21 to $25 for evening
hours during the summer, includes a tour and wine tasting.

   You need mulch? North Carolina's Mecklenburg County is giving it
away.
   Since October, workers have been grinding 140 tons of mulch a
day from limbs and trees felled by Hurricane Hugo.
   ``Come and get it,'' says Bill Warren, county operations
supervisor for recycling. ``We're grinding more than we can give
away.''
   For gardeners, the woody pulp is ideal for landscaping. It keeps
moisture in and weeds out. As the mulch decays, it enriches the
soil.
   The county once charged $15 a pickup load. But until all Hugo
debris is ground up, the stuff is free for the taking.
   After four months, the county had ground up only one-fifth of
Hugo's debris. The task probably will continue through autumn, says
Fred Remington, division manager of recycling. Mulch will then go
back on sale as part of the county's recycling program.

Snowdrops. All the colorful, fragrant and reliable flowers that bloom from

<HEADLINE>  SPRING-BULB APPEAL RUNS HIGH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Four months later, on one of those sparkling, blue-sky, late-winter days,
I'll be out there poking around to see if the first green tips are rising.;
Spring's bulbs are available in garden centers, and this is a great time to
shop for them, especially if you have particular colors or varieties in mind.
But you have plenty of time to plant them through the long autumn.;
Selecting colors and varieties is a personal thing. Some gardeners want
intense fragrance, so they concentrate on hyacinths; others go for the elegant
beauty of tulips or the cozy appeal of daffodils.;   But sinking all your
money into one kind of bulb will give you a short bloom season. Spring bulbs
mix beautifully and an assortment will stretch the season from late winter to
late spring.;   All bulbs, however, require excellent drainage. The only
failure I've ever had came from planting tulips in soil that stayed soggy.;
To improve drainage before planting, loosen the soil of tulip beds by adding
enough organic matter such as peat moss, compost or composted bark to make the
soil at least one-third organic.;   And to encourage good growth of the roots,
prepare the soil at least 12 inches deep. Set the larger bulbs such as tulips,
daffodils and hyacinths at least 6 inches deep, the little bulbs 2 to 3 inches
deep.;   If you are planting bulbs, mix a 10-10-10 fertilizer into the soil.
If the bulbs are planted, sprinkle it onto the surface of the bulb bed. In
late winter, when the green tips poke out of the ground, fertilize again.;
Or, cut the feedings from two to one with a slow-release fertilizer such as
Bulb Booster or bone meal, applied in the fall at the rate of four pounds per
100 square feet.  </TEXT>

FLOWERS: CALOCHORTUS CAN BE GROWN FROM BULBS OR SEEDS, BUT THEY MUST BE
PROTECTED FROM INSECTS. THEY PRODUCE MAGNIFICENT BLOOMS.

Attraction is what flowers are all about. Their brilliant colors and unusual
markings are beacons for insects and other pollinators, but they wind up
attracting human beings as well. In California's tawny hills such flirtations
have developed into lifelong infatuations for many people, especially when the
flowers involved are the ones called calochortus.
</P>
<P>
In 1878, Carl Purdy, a 17-year-old Michigan native, was living with his family
in Mendocino County. As he wandered the oak woods collecting wildflowers for
his sister, who was recuperating from tuberculosis, he noticed some dainty
yellow flowers that resembled glowing paper lanterns. He dug up some of the
plants, which he found grew from bulbs, and mailed them to a New Jersey flower
broker who dealt in California plants.
</P>
<P>
The broker replied that the flower was a type of calochortus, a genus of the
lily family related tulips, and that he would pay Purdy $1.50 for each 100
bulbs he could send. From then until his death in 1945, Purdy made a career of
exporting calochortuses and other California bulbs dug from the wild, in one
year alone shipping half a million bulbs.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps 40 calochortus species are native to California, and they fall into
three categories. Globe lilies or fairy lanterns have nodding, lantern-shaped
flowers, while the type star tulips have erect, open flowers, their petals
sometimes so thickly covered with hairs as to suggest another common name,
cat's ears.
</P>
<P>
But the most famous of the calochortus clan are the mariposa lilies, whose
petals are often punctuated with spots, streaks and blotches of color
resembling the markings on butterfly wings.
</P>
<P>
All types of calochortus grow in summer-dry environments, a factor few of
Purdy's customers understood. Because they were watered in summer or planted in
summer-rainfall areas, most of the bulbs Purdy sold perished in a year or two.
Fortunately, some of Purdy's customers persisted and became expert calochortus
growers.
</P>
<P>
In his last years, Purdy sold some bulbs to Fred Smith, at that time an El
Monte traveling salesman. Smith potted the bulbs and was pleased when they
bloomed the following spring. However, that summer he left them in his mother's
care while he traveled, and she watered them to an early death.
</P>
<P>
Smith was not about to give up, for he had been enamored of mariposa lilies
since a 1938 high school hike in the Montebello hills. There he found
Calochortus catalinae, a shapely, tulip-like flower that he recognized as a
relative of the sego lilies of his native Wyoming. He was hooked, but his urge
to grow calochortuses lay dormant for years until he saw Purdy's catalogue.
</P>
<P>
After his initial failure, Smith started to grow calochortuses from seed,
experimenting with various soil mixes, containers and watering schedules. Now
retired and living in Glendale, Smith continues to be fascinated by the globe
lilies, star tulips and mariposa lilies he grows in redwood boxes arrayed
around his swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
The new generation of calochortus fanciers is represented by Rob Ferber, a
Caltech biology student whose introduction to the genus is strangely similar to
that of his predecessors. Ferber's family moved from Pennsylvania to La Canada
Flintridge in 1978, when he was 9-years-old. His first impression of California
was, "It's a desert! It's dead!"
</P>
<P>
He found little to like until, while visiting relatives in San Diego a few
years later, he came across what he considered "a really pretty flower." It was
Calochortus splendens, a lavender-flowered mariposa lily. When his attempts to
grow them from seed failed due to summer watering, he began to study
calochortus in earnest.
</P>
<P>
Ferber is now researching the molecular genetics of calochortus, trying to
learn how the 60 or so species which range from British Columbia to Guatemala
are related to each other and how they evolved.
</P>
<P>
Besides unraveling this scientific mystery, Ferber is also making progress on
how to grow calochortuses. Studying diseased bulbs, he observed that they had
been gnawed by mites, allowing funguses to penetrate the bulb and rot them. So,
in addition to keeping bulbs dry in their dormant period, Ferber recommends
drenching them with the insecticide diazinon and the fungicide benlate during
the growing season.
</P>
<P>
Calochortus bulbs planted now will flower in the spring and, with adequate
care, will bloom at least every other year thereafter. They should only be
planted in strictly summer-dry parts of the garden or in containers, most
growers favoring redwood boxes or clay pots.
</P>
<P>
Ferber's soil mix consists of equal parts of plaster sand, perlite and pine
needle compost, while Smith's formula calls for 40% loamy topsoil, 30% sand and
30% redwood sawdust. Redwood and pine needles are valuable because they contain
natural fungicides.
</P>
<P>
The bulbs do best if consistently moist, but not soggy, during their growing
period, and can be fed monthly with half-strength liquid fertilizer. Mariposa
lilies and star tulips fare best in full sun, but fairy lanterns prefer light
shade.
</P>
<P>
By the time bulbs flower in the spring, their leaves have started to turn
yellow, indicating that it's time to stop watering until cool weather returns
in the fall. It helps to cover the containers with a lid to make sure they are
not watered and to set them out of the hot sun.
</P>
<P>

AT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BOTANICAL GARDENS, THE FIRST SIGN OF SPRING IS THE FALL
PLANTING THAT PROMISES ACRES OF SPECTACULAR COLOR

Arboretums are places of experimentation, where experts work to discover what
plants can grow in our climate and how best to grow them. The autumn months are
an especially busy time at Southern California's botanical gardens. Says
Francis Ching, director of the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum system:
"We wish we could plant everything in the fall, but we have to spread the work
out. So in the fall, we concentrate on those things that must be planted now --
spring's flowers and bulbs." Fall is the best time to plant just about
everything in the California garden -- spring flowers and winter vegetables,
bulbs, perennials, ground covers, shrubs and trees. Last spring, we
photographed some of what botanical gardens had planted the previous fall.
Discussions with four of the gardens' plantsmen led us to some fascinating
combinations of plants and some surprising cultural tips.
</P>
<P>
VOLUNTEERS DO MOST of the fall planting in their own corner of this very large
and under-funded garden, but not everything is planted at the proper time
because many of the plants are donated by nurseries after their fall sales. In
fact, some spring flowers aren't set out until early February. But they still
manage to bloom in time for spring.
</P>
<P>
Full of wonderful and often-unexpected mixes of flowers, this former dump site
looks like a cottage garden in a storybook. "Because this garden is planted
entirely by our volunteers, they can do whatever they want," says Norma
Cantafio, who directs the volunteers' South Coast Botanic Garden Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Surprises occasionally come from flowers that return each year from seed. Red
flax and calendulas are two varieties that make a delightful mix, reappearing
on their own each winter, if the volunteers simply water and weed.
</P>
<P>
A big bed of Tecolote ranunculus planted from tubers in October is also full of
linaria, which looks like baby snapdragons. (The garden is so wild that the
occasional weed -- in this case, the sow thistle -- sneaks in.) The same effect
could be achieved by purposely sowing seeds of these easy-to-germinate annuals
-- especially the red flax (Linum) and the linaria -- among other plants.
</P>
<P>
DESPITE ACRES of camellias, roses, perennials and fall-planted annuals, tulips
are superintendent George Lewis' favorite spring flower. Not only does he grow
them on a scale unheard of in California, but he also grows them perfectly --
not an easy feat here.
</P>
<P>
Lewis and his staff buy bulbs as early as possible and immediately refrigerate
them for a minimum of six weeks. Loamy clay soil is amended with organic
matter, plus an amazing addition: A four-inch layer of washed builder's sand is
mixed in to improve drainage. "Tulips hate wet feet," says Lewis, who
landscaped rooftop gardens in New York City before joining the Los Angeles
arboretum system 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Bulbs are planted 8 to 12 inches deep, much deeper than the usually recommended
6 inches. (Planting occurs at the end of December, in time for an array of
blooms for the Spring Garden Show that begins on April 1). A handful of bone
meal is dropped into each hole, and bulbs are set on top of it. They are not
watered but survive on rainfall and moisture already in the soil (beds are
thoroughly watered a few days before planting) until foliage breaks through the
ground. Withholding water prevents rotting and encourages what Lewis proudly
terms a "massive" root system.
</P>
<P>
After leaves appear, plants are watered frequently -- every other day by March.
When new growth reaches 3 inches, high-nitrogen liquid fertilizer is applied
every two weeks. As flowers wither, bulbs are pulled out of the ground and
tossed on the compost heap. Tulip bulbs grown here are not successfully
recycled, as they are in the East Coast. "Only three out of 10 would return
next year," Lewis estimates.
</P>
<P>
BECAUSE THIS GARDEN is devoted to native California plants, horticulturist
Carol Bornstein keeps a close eye on weather forecasts. She plants just before
fall's first good rain, usually in November. In October, she and her staff
decide what to plant and ready seed. Then they wait.
</P>
<P>
Wildflowers are annual plants and must be sown from seed every fall, but
Bornstein, who has a master's degree in horticulture, reports that she no
longer tries to plant huge meadows of them. Instead, she says, her staff is
"dribbling in wildflower seed in smaller swaths" because weeds can quickly
smother wildflowers and smaller areas make weeding easier. Permanent clumps of
native bunch grasses and perennials break up these meadow areas so that they
don't look completely bare in summer. For example, the buttercup-yellow meadow
foam, Limnanthes douglasii, disappears for the summer. California poppies and
blue-eyed grass, a blue-flowered relative of the iris, hang on.
</P>
<P>
To plant wildflowers, Bornstein's staff clears several square feet, scatters
seeds, then gently rakes or waters them in. Plants appear after the first rain
and bloom all spring. When flowers drop their seed in summer, they are covered
with a mulch of wood chips to keep weeds and dust down. The following fall, the
area is cleared away and seed sown again.
</P>
<P>
NARY A WEED nor a dead bloom lingers here. This tiny botanical garden, which
occupies one city block on Coast Highway, is perhaps best known for its
spectacular, picture-perfect flower displays. "How do you get your plants to
look so good?" is the question director Wade Roberts hears most often.
</P>
<P>
"The answer is simple," says Roberts, who was a landscape designer and Cal Poly
San Luis Obispo-trained horticulturist before he joined Sherman Gardens 23
years ago. "We fertilize and water consistently. It doesn't matter what you
feed with as long as you are consistent," he explains.
</P>
<P>
Calendulas, cyclamen, pansies and stock are planted in beds throughout the
garden in October, but the sunniest flower bed is saved for ranunculus, the
garden's most dazzling spring crop, which is planted in mid-February. Though
ranunculus are usually planted in the fall as tubers, here they are planted
from 4-inch (quart) pots, good news for those home gardeners who don't get
around to fall planting on time. In October, the bed is planted with Iceland
poppies, and when they poop out (or get flattened by winter rains), in go the
ranunculus. Roberts plants a special seed-grown strain, Bloomingdale, that is
sold and planted already in flower. Though this strategy is more costly than
planting tubers, he believes it is worth the expense because beds are kept full
of flowers -- bare dirt never greets visitors.
</P>
<P>
Another favorite is Primula obconica, which likes rich soil with ample organic
matter and grows in the shade. "We plant these from 4-inch pots in mid-October,
and they last for five or six months, blooming all the time. They're an
incredibly sturdy flower; even rain doesn't knock them down," Roberts says.
</P>
<P>
Weeds and dead blooms disappear quickly, however, "thanks to our tireless
volunteers who are issued buckets every morning."

<HEAD>Milton Boston: Generalissimo of the Capital's Flower Beds</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The capital is awash in laughing daffodils, a
grand chorus of tulips is about to proclaim the arrival of spring,
and Milton Boston already is worrying about planting thousands of
geraniums, petunias and marigolds for the summer.
   Boston is chief floral gardener for the National Park Service in
downtown Washington, the generalissimo with rake and hoe who
oversees the year-long planting of 170 flower beds from the Capitol
to the Kennedy Center.
   His job might seem staggering to backyard putterers. For a month
in late fall, the efficient, unflappable Boston and his crew of
eight gardeners were busy planting 186,150 tulips, 108,300
daffodils and 22,000 pansies, all of which bloom in the spring.
   Those flowers are removed by early May. The soil is tilled,
fumigated with weed and pest killers, conditioned with perlite and
peat moss and planted with bright, hardy annuals for Washington's
hot summer months. They are weeded and fertilized until they die in
the first frost. They are replaced by about 3,000 crysanthemums.
Then the beds are cleared and the cycle starts again in November.
   Boston, a 26-year Park Service veteran, is especially proud of
the ``tulip library,'' a broad, looping cluster of 95 small beds of
the proud clarions of spring that lies near the Tidal Basin south
of the Washington Monument.
   This elaborate garden contains 15,000 tulips, most of them
imported from Holland. Each of the 95 beds containing a different
variety, with names as dazzling as their colors _ Queen of Night,
Merry Widow, Apeldoorn, Oriental Splendor, Smiling Queen, Flaming
Parrot, Estella Rijnveld.
   It's so impressive that it won an admiring tribute from the
Dutch Embassy.
   Boston says he gets ``great satisfaction'' from his handiwork,
which delights more than 23 million tourists who visit Washington's
national parks and monuments each year.
   ``This is always what I wanted to do,'' said Boston, 45, who
grew up on his father's farm in eastern North Carolina and migrated
to Washington after high school. ``All my life I've been used to
growing things.''
   His annual $330,000 budget includes the cost of plants and bulbs
purchased wholesale from growers, many from neighboring Maryland
and Virginia, on the basis of competitive bids and shipped into the
capital by truck or van.
   During plantings, Boston's crew begins work at 6 a.m. and can
leave a flower bed blazing with color before the morning rush hour
is over. He says he couldn't meet his grueling timetable for the
passing seasons without his eight Park Service helpers.
   ``They really work hard and do a good job,'' he said. ``They're
all gardeners, and they know what they're doing. They can plant
20,000 bulbs in one day.''
   In a city beset by violent crimes, Boston is pleased that his
flowers are almost never stolen, except by an occasional panhandler
intent on selling them for spare change.
   ``I guess people enjoy them so, they don't take them,'' he said.
``About the only problem is when people stand in the beds to pose
for pictures and mash the flowers down.''
   Boston says he once had ``the best-looking yard in the
neighborhood'' in suburban Capitol Heights, Md., where he lives
with his wife and two children, ``but in this job, I don't have the
time any more to take care of it.''
   His loss is Washington's gain.

FT  24 SEP 94 / Outdoors: After the massacre, the narcissi - Gardening /
Some advice for bulb enthusiasts who want to spend wisely and see tangible
evidence of success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Robin Lane Fox has some advice for bulb enthusiasts who want to spend wisely
and see tangible evidence of success
THIS weekend, it is time to plan the annual bulb massacre. During the past
30 years, I have sent hundreds of them to their death: tulips, anemones,
iris, muscari - and my latest victims, 200 ipheions, which were planted
lovingly on a warm October day last year and responded by sending up two
green shoots between the lot of them in March.
Gardeners like to forget the mass murders buried in their gardens because
hope springs eternal; if only the Triumph tulips would do the same. But I
want to share 35 years' experience of such things with those of you who
cannot confess to it or are starting out with high hopes, coloured
photographs and bulb catalogues which talk of naturalising.
This year is the tulips' 400th anniversary. I send my happy returns to the
family although, as individuals, I have seldom had one which has reached its
fifth birthday. But since tulips should not be planted until late October, I
will reserve a separate week for their birthday obituary.
How, though, do wise gardeners spend their money with better prospects of
success? My successes have always been narcissi. This year, the trade has
not found narcissi easy because many of the bulbs did not grow on well in a
year of peculiar weather.
I follow firm narcissus rules. I put the tall, hybrid varieties in grass,
chosing them to cover their widely differing seasons. I swear by the early
Icy Follies, followed by Barrett Browning and the late Pheasant's Eye. These
narcissi, with a white base to the flowers, persist better in grass than the
tempting all-white daffodils.
Order them in 25 kg bulk for country planting and do not economise by
starting with a few and seeing what happens. They grow almost everywhere,
but you should segregate the varieties in separate clumps because they
flower at different seasons. They look miserable if they open when their
neighbours have gone brown.
Small narcissi also are excellent and persist well, but the catalogues
mislead you by recommending them for naturalising. Why not? you might think;
after all, some of them grow wild on the Welsh borders or in the Yorkshire
dales?
The best method is to plant a few, see if they like you and allow them to
colonise. Vigour varies widely but you should start with some small,
experimental clumps of February Gold, Tete a Tete and the native Lent Lily.
They all flower early, allowing you to mow the grass much sooner in the
year.
I have known gardeners whose grass has been colonised by these strong
varieties after three years. If they start to spread, the best method is to
lift and divide them after flowering when they are still in leaf: they move
much better late in April, the season when no supplier can send them out.
We all buy dry bulbs which need to be planted quickly. Next year, there is
no particular merit in dead-heading them, but it really does help, after
flowering, to spray the leaves with liquid fertiliser once a fortnight.
Most of the small narcissi which I have not murdered are used in small
groups, in flower beds. They bloom early and the small leaves are
unobtrusive when they die. The prettiest, but not the cheapest, is Dove
Wings, although groups of a dozen bulbs go a long way.
Generally, you can make as much of an impact with small clumps, spaced well
down the length of the bed, rather than with an expensive total coverage.
February Gold is the strongest form of all (although it is not gold and does
not flower in February). Jack Snipe is almost as good and Peeping Tom also
has stamina.
Never try to naturalise jonquils in grass: they are better in dry ground
below a wall. The pure white forms are extremely pretty and we have had
sensational success with the pure white Thalia, planted to face due north at
the foot of Oxford's ancient city wall. It is supposed to prefer a warm,
sheltered place but it has spread by the hundred in this unlikely site.
Narcissi grow well on heavy soil but, in light gardens, I would choose
anemone Blanda as a carpet instead; its starry flowers open at ground level
in pink, white and blue (or simply blue, if you prefer). They arrive like
dry, black nuts from the suppliers and I have learned the trick to them.
Soak them for 24 hours in a bowl of cold water before planting, and do not
worry if you are not entirely sure which side of the corm should be
uppermost. Somehow, they right themselves.
They are excellent for the front of beds which will be semi-shaded when
leaves return to the trees but where they can open in the spring sunshine
meanwhile. They will often spread quite happily and the leaves are not a
bother.
Crocuses are harder to kill if you are not too experimental. Despite a few
triumphs, I have vowed to follow narcissus rules with this family, too.
Almost the only ones to go into grass will be the strong Dutch hybrids,
which persist if you do not mow them before the leaves have died away.
The whites and yellows are chosen easily, but the blues are more tricky
because the best-known are purple or striped annoyingly. My favourite is Sky
Blue - but squirrels and mice like all these crocuses, too, and I know of no
protection except the shotgun.
Small-flower crocuses usually dwindle in grass, except for the vigorous
Tommasinianus; this variety is the other great bet for a future carpet in
the lawn. Other small varieties include flowers which I might well choose to
take to my desert island: Blue Pearl and Cream Beauty are of unsurpassed
beauty and show great stamina along the front of flower beds out of season
or at the foot of hedges of roses. On open ground, they persist and
multiply, but grass is too much for them. The best multiplier of all in a
flower bed is the pale blue vernus Vanguard - not the cheapest, but much
your best hope of total cover.
Leave aconites alone in quantity. They are better bought in green leaf in
the spring and planted in small samples to see if they are happy. The same
is true of snowdrops, which few people establish from dry bulbs planted now.
Better bets for the bigger cheque-book are the milk-blue and white
chionodoxa Luciliae, which spreads rapidly, and the wonderfully early scilla
Spring Beauty, which makes clumps but is essential because it flowers so
early. Bluebells are a romantic menace and you probably want no more in your
life.
I would like to have ended on a positive note. For 20 years, my best early
spring bulb was the wonderful iris Histrioides Major, which flowers in a
brilliant blue at a height of 6in and resists any weather. I have never been
able to kill it, whereas its other small relations split into small bulbs
and dwindle after two years.
Now, the nurserymen have killed it instead. Its two main suppliers in
Holland allowed a virus simultaneously into their stock, and this admirable
bulb is now off the market.

<HEAD>At Tivoli Park, Spring's Chores Begin: `25,000 Violets and ...'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY GERBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Wherever there's a little spot for
a flower, there's a flower,'' Owe Bodentien was saying, as he stood
on the muddy soil of a deserted Tivoli park, where he is the head
gardener.
   Like gardeners everywhere in the Northern Hemisphere this time
of year, his work is just beginning _ and he has 20 acres to worry
about.
   ``The policy is to have something new and something old, but not
too much of each,'' Bodentien said of his 10 years in what he calls
``the best gardening job in Denmark.''
   ``First we plant about 25,000 to 30,000 violets and
forget-me-nots in blue, pink and white, with tulips in between.
People should do that in their gardens, too, because when the
(tulip) bulbs are finished, you have another flower underneath.''
   Although the park is open barely a third of the year, as many as
5 million people stream through each summer season for the
amusement rides, the food, the music, the theater _ or just to look
at the flowers.
   Entrepreneur Georg Carstensen got royal permission to found the
park in 1843. The story goes that he told King Christian VIII,
``When people are amusing themselves, they do not think about
politics.''
   For many who visit Tivoli, the gardens are the main attraction.
   Bodentien makes a regular buying trip to the Keukenhof gardens,
showcase of the Dutch flower bulb industry outside The Hague in the
Netherlands. Tivoli buys practically all its flowers from such
specialized suppliers, spending the kroner equivalent of $313,000 a
year on plants alone.
   By modern amusement park standards, Tivoli is tiny, so every
inch counts. The garden plan has 10 pages of ledger-sized entries
detailing what is planted where.
   This year's plan calls for 68,000 tulips of 100 different
varieties, from ``Dreaming Maid'' to ``Black Hero.''
   The gardening staff of nine, which expands to as many as 17 in
the summer, will also be tending 42,300 pearl hyacinths and
anemones, 3,800 narcissi and Easter lilies, 50,000 cut
chrysanthemums and 100,000 potted plants of other kinds.
   January and February is the time for pruning trees, some of
which are older than the park itself.
   ``I must admit that trees are my big passion,'' Bodentien said.
``Flowers are easily bought, but trees take centuries.''
   Tivoli's chestnuts, elms and lime trees are seldom felled, and
when they must be, they are replaced. They grow from walls, poke
through restaurant ceilings and stick up around the winding tracks
of the rides.
   Tivoli's lone California redwood, a gift from the Danish
Brotherhood in California in 1968, is growing at the northern limit
for the species, Bodentien said.
   An American tourist was astonished to see a banana tree bearing
fruit in this northern latitude, he said.
   ``I heard him tell his wife it was plastic, so I picked one and
gave it to him to eat.''
   Bodentien and his crews are in a rush now to have everything in
order and in bloom by opening day, April 27.
   In 1983, Bodentien won a Guinness Record Certificate for the
biggest chrysanthemum display, 370,000 blooms. He's always coming
up with new ideas for the park's designs.
   ``I get my inspiration all over,'' he said. ``At home in a chair
or out walking on the street or maybe talking to people about
something totally different, and suddenly it comes. ...
   ``The park has to look as fine on the last day (of the season)
as on the first day. We are changing all the time.''

RANUNCULUS DISPLAY THEIR MARVELOUS BEAUTY EACH SPRING. PLANTED FROM BULBS IN
FALL, THEY DO BEST IN MILD, COOL CLIMATES.;
</P>
<P>
SPRINGTIME SHOWOFFS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ELLEN GUFFEY, Guffey has been writing Times gardening articles for 10
years.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
They have no common name, but everyone recognizes these flowers when they burst
into bloom in the spring. Easily the most magnificent of all our fall-planted
bulbs, ranunculus blossoms are to the Southland what tulips are to cold-climate
gardeners.
</P>
<P>
More publicity is given to tulips -- even here in the Southland where tulips
are notoriously poor performers. Veteran gardeners, however, ignore the tulip
hoopla and bulb displays in garden centers.
</P>
<P>
Instead, they head straight for brown, claw-like ranunculus tubers because they
know that these weirdly curved claws will produce crepe-paper blossoms coveted
by gardeners and bouquet makers throughout the flower world.
</P>
<P>
Ranunculus flowers can be cultivated only in mild, cool climates such as
coastal Southern California. Small wonder, then, that the world's largest
grower is located on rolling hills along the coast in Carlsbad.
</P>
<P>
With more than 100 acres planted in ranunculus, the Carlsbad fields produce 90%
of this country's ranunculus supply and over 60% of the world's crop.
</P>
<P>
Jim Frazee, a third-generation grower, and his family have been growing flowers
in the Carlsbad area for more than 60 years. Although the flower crops are
rotated, the ranunculus fields are usually visible from Interstate 5 in March
and April, attracting thousands of flower lovers, photographers and sightseers
every year.
</P>
<P>
The sandy soil and foggy climate create ideal growing conditions. But another
important factor contributes to the worldwide reputation of the Carlsbad tubers
-- the development of the Tecolote strain.
</P>
<P>
Through purposeful selection, the Frazee family and its marketing/research
partner, Davids &amp; Royston Bulb Co., have developed a strain that sets the
world standard for quality ranunculus. Tecolote tubers yield double-rose
flowers with layers of petals as thick as feathers on parakeets. No other
grower has been able to duplicate this form or achieve the consistent quality
of the Carlsbad production.
</P>
<P>
Ranunculus tubers are susceptible to soil-borne fungi, so commercial growers
propagate them from seed. Because seed-grown flowers don't always produce
offspring identical to the parents, quality control is an extremely important
task.
</P>
<P>
One special section of the fields is devoted to stock plants, the creme de la
creme of the millions of ranunculus tubers grown there. Divided by color and
separated by plastic panels to prevent unwanted cross-pollination, these stock
plants grow under the watchful eye of Arnold Ellis, research and development
director for Davids &amp; Royston.
</P>
<P>
Cruising the rows of magnificent blooms, Ellis yanks out seemingly perfect
plants for a variety of innocent faults: color variation, semi-double form
instead of fully double, irregular foliage, imperfect shape, small size.
</P>
<P>
"I'm intensely concerned with upgrading the strain," Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
His most recent research has concentrated on development of a new salmon color.
Ready for introduction in 1991, this color range will include salmons, pinks
and orange pastels. Because ranunculus plants are not clones of their parents
(like tulips and other vegetatively propagated flowers), the colors vary,
representing a range of colors.
</P>
<P>
In the spring Ellis watches over the seed plants zealously.
</P>
<P>
"Our biggest problem," he said, "is the theft of plants and flowers at night --
apparently by flower industry people."
</P>
<P>
Security guards now patrol the fields at night, but visitors are allowed to
explore selected areas during the day. As many as 20,000 visit on spring
weekends, taking pictures and stopping to buy bouquets at the corner flower
stand.
</P>
<P>
Besides producing tubers, the Carlsbad ranunculus fields now provide cut
flowers that are shipped around the world. But the future is somewhat cloudy.
Frazee looks across his blooming fields at elegant homes and rapidly spreading
condominium projects and wonders how much longer his flowers will be able to
occupy this prime real estate.

A GARDEN IN THREE ACTS;
</P>
<P>
CAREFUL PLANNING AND PLANTING NOW CAN EXTEND THE SPRING BLOOMING PERIOD ALL THE
WAY TO AUTUMN

IN CALIFORNIA, there are actually two springs. First to bloom are the bulbs and
annuals; then about two months later come the perennials. With luck, the
perennials flower through summer and into early autumn. So this month -- the
optimal planting time in Southern California -- you're really planning and
planting for two springs, plus summer.
</P>
<P>
Last spring, in Louis and Stephanie Snyder's West Los Angeles garden, the bulbs
and annuals set out the previous fall -- a crisp mix of white and yellow --
peaked in March. By mid-May, the garden looked completely different. The bulbs
and some of the annuals were gone, but the perennials, also planted at the same
time, had taken their places. The multitude of flowers -- including roses,
delphiniums, lavender, various salvias and coreopsis -- bloomed off and on and
were still putting on a respectable show in late September. Many perennials
grow in the garden for several years before they must be divided or replanted,
unlike most of the bulbs and annual flowers, which are planted anew every year.
</P>
<P>
Fall planting is almost foolproof in California. Shorter, cooler days and the
occasional rain are kind to seeds and seedlings alike. Nature makes roots wait
until fall to grow, and since most soil diseases are inactive in the autumn,
anything planted between September and December is almost guaranteed to be off
to a sure, if somewhat slow, start -- slow compared to the jump-start plants
get from spring planting.
</P>
<P>
Fall planting also saves considerable water because plants need less during the
cooler months, and any rain helps out. This year, many home gardeners are
waiting to plant until the end of October or even November, when rain is more
likely, temperatures still cooler and the sun even lower.
</P>
<P>
Those who like flowers would have a hard time coming up with a better plan than
the one worked out for the Snyder garden. The long, somewhat narrow area allows
plenty of room for two deep beds, and the path down the middle makes everything
accessible. The garden is on the south side of the property so it gets as much
sun as possible. And the linear plan of this garden is perfectly suited for
drip irrigation. An in-line system (with the drip emitters hidden inside the
tubing) or a porous tubing system (in which water leaks through the walls of
the tubing) could be snaked among the beds. Although the Snyders moved from a
much larger garden (shown in the Oct. 4, 1987, issue of Los Angeles Times
Magazine), they have no regrets. In the new, smaller garden, good planning
created more room for fun things. There is little "filler" -- no lawn or
shrubbery to speak of -- just lots of flowers, a few dwarf fruit trees, and
vegetables, which are in another little plot laid out like an early American
knot garden.
</P>
<P>
Torrance architect Edward Carson Beall designed the Snyders' house, which looks
like it was plucked from a New Hampshire field. Instead of taking up the entire
lot with house, an all-too-common occurrence in California nowadays, Beall
reserved a long space for a garden and shoehorned the farm-style house around
it. Even the color of the house (Dunn Edward's Barn Red) was chosen to
complement the flowers.
</P>
<P>
Sandy Kennedy of Sassafras Nursery and Landscape in Topanga laid out the
garden, and her sister, Dian Kennedy, cares for it through the seasons. It was
Sandy who cleverly designed the two rows of flowers to go with the two springs.
</P>
<P>
In March, the path is lined with white tulips and big 'Mt. Hood' and
'California Giant' daffodils, with an under story of white sweet alyssum and
pansies. Much of the gray foliage comes from the low-growing perennials --
lamb's ears, lavender and snow-in-summer -- that come to life in time to help
hide the fading bulbs. The bright yellow clumps nicely placed along the path
are coreopsis. In spring, Dian plants a few summer-flowering annuals, including
marigolds, where spring annuals have faded.
</P>
<P>
The back row is planted with taller perennials and a few late bulbs and
annuals, like larkspur and watsonia, which peak in May and June and then
continue off and on into early fall. The tall spires in the back are blue
delphiniums or pink larkspur and foxgloves, which are replanted every fall.
</P>
<P>
No space is wasted, not even the space between paving stones (which are simply
set on a tamped sand base). In these narrow cracks grow lobelia, dwarf yarrow,
woolly thyme, ajuga, corsican mint, crocus, potentilla and the very dainty
erodium.

<LEADPARA>  TAKE time this fall to pot some tulips, daffodils, fragrant hyacinths and
crocuses and you will enjoy their colorful blooms indoors far ahead of
nature's schedule. It's a sure way to get a jump on next spring and brighten
one's outlook during the cold gray winter days ahead.;   It is easily done
through a simple technique called forcing, actually tricking the bulbs to
respond as if spring has arrived. Professional growers do it all the time to
make these cheery flowers available in midwinter, but it's much more exciting
to grow them yourself.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  FORCING FAVORITE BULBS INDOORS WILL PROVIDE AN
EARLY COLOR SHOW  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Flowers  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Go for variety;   All that is necessary is to provide the natural
conditions under which the bulbs normally grow, then encourage them to bloom
earlier than they would in the garden. Each bulb has its flowers, stems and
leaves already formed within, eager to emerge when conditions are right.;
Now, with outdoor bulb planting well under way, is a good time to begin a
forcing project. You can use bulbs left over after you've finished outdoor
planting, or purchase them especially for this purpose at garden centers.
Select firm, plump, unblemished bulbs for best results, as well as different
varieties for a wider range of colors.;   You also will need clay or plastic
pots, ceramic bowls or other containers that are at least five inches deep
with bottom drainage holes; soil; and a cold indoor or outdoor place to store
the planted bulbs while they are developing roots.;   Soil brought in from the
garden is satisfactory if it is loose and crumbly. Otherwise use a commercial
potting mix. No fertilizer is necessary as each bulb contains all the
nutrients needed to flower.;   Here's the procedure;   Cover the drainage
holes in containers with stones or pieces of a broken clay pot to keep the
soil from flowing out. Then fill the containers with soil and follow these
steps:;   (check) Firm the bulbs in the soil with a twisting action, placing
them close together but not touching each other or the sides of the
containers. A six-inch pot should hold five or six tulips, or three hyacinths,
or eight to 10 smaller bulbs such as crocuses.;   (check) Add soil as needed
to cover the smaller bulbs, but allow the tips of the larger bulbs to be
visible above the soil. Then water thoroughly, preferably by plunging the
containers in a sink or large pan of water about halfway up and allowing the
water to soak through the drainage holes until the surface becomes moist.;
(check) Store the bulbs in a cool, dark place that duplicates the winter cold
period they require to develop vigorous root growth. Suitable storage areas
could be a cool spot in the basement or garage where the temperature remains
between 35 and 48 degrees. Or place containers under a heavy mulch in an
outdoor trench or cold frame.;   (check) Begin checking some of the pots in 10
to 12 weeks to see whether they have developed substantial roots and some top
growth. If so, the bulbs are ready for the final forcing step. If not, return
them for additional cold treatment.;   Warmup time;   Once you are satisfied
that adequate rooting has occurred, transfer the pots from cold storage to a
room with diffused light and 60- to 65-degree temperatures. Within a week or
so, stems will begin to elongate and buds will enlarge. This is the cue to
give them more warmth and full light and await their flowering splendor.;   By
forcing a few of the potted bulbs at a time, leaving the others in cold
storage, you can add extra weeks to the indoor flower show. To prolong
freshness of plants in flower, keep them away from direct sunlight and away
from heat ducts and radiators. Moving them to cooler quarters at night also
helps.;   Almost all hardy bulbs can be coaxed into bloom ahead of their usual
flowering season, according to the Netherlands FlowerBulb Information Center,
so don't hesitate to try any of your favorite kinds or experiment with
unfamiliar crops.;   While bulbs forced for early indoor bloom seldom can be
forced again, they may eventually flower in the garden if their foliage has
been allowed to ripen. In any event, it's worth a try. In spring when the
ground can be worked, remove the bulbs from their pots and plant them in the
garden, following the recommended greater depth for outdoor planting.  </TEXT>

FT  04 SEP 93 / Gardening: Erratic but worthwhile favours from Madonna -
Robin Lane Fox considers the lilies and how they grow and urges you to fix
your attention on a marvel of midsummer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECENT evenings have been perfect for garden watchers; the ground is too
hard to allow weeds to be pulled out and, instead, we can all trowel in the
coolness, enjoying the late phases of a wonderful gardening year. Thus, I
hate to disturb your peace; but, during the next week, there are
opportunities for up-grading which might slip your notice.
The most obvious, of course, is the ordering of next year's bulbs. Be warned
that it becomes ever harder to plant the early varieties in rough ground
because the autumns are now dry and the earth is baked firmly.
As I try to ram a bulb-planter into rough grass and fit a daffodil
underneath, I am reminded of those Israelites in Egypt making bricks with
useless materials. If you want an exodus, or way out, choose bulbs which you
can plant in the softer surface of flower beds.
My Top Six start with the wonderfully blue little iris, Histrioides Major,
which will resist the worst weather, and narcissus February Gold, which
seldom flowers in February and is not gold, either, but a bearable yellow at
a manageable height of 1ft. I prefer the small-flowered crocusses, of which
chrysanthus Blue Pearl and Cream Beauty are simply the best and will last
for ages.
Among the smaller tulips, I prefer Batalinii Bronze Charm because its colour
is unique and its stamina exceptional at a height of about 6in. Of the later
bedding tulips, I pick Sweet Harmony, in a lily-shaped yellow, and Queen of
Bartigons, in a tolerable pink, which I owe to the sharp eye of the late
Lanning Roper. Anemone blanda, either in mixed or single colours, runs off
the list at ground level wherever the soil is light and sunny so that the
flowers open fully.
The Top Six does not mean that there is not another Top 50, but a short-list
helps to concentrate disagreement. I have found that none of these bulbs
does the usual tulip trick of disappearing after one good year. I also find
that a few bulbs, spaced out in clumps, make much more of an impression than
those great sweeps by the hundred which are the neurotic reaction of those
who believe they can buy gardening, rather than think it through.
Bulb ordering directs our minds to spring, but the less obvious jobs direct
us to winter and mid-summer. Just now, you have a rare chance to bag some
winter irises. These are the forms with rushy leaves and exquisitely blue
flowers which are at home in Algeria and are sold in the UK at varying
prices as Unguicuilaris.
Most of the experts believe these plants will transplant or divide most
happily in September: in my long experience, they seem to be right. If you
can find an owner of an established clump, you are in with an excellent
chance.
At present, these winter irises look scruffy after a dry spell, and anyone
could be persuaded that they would be improved by gentle division. Claim a
piece for yourself, confident that you are doing no harm: my favourite, if
you can find it, is the darker blue form called Mary Barnard.
These irises are heaven-sent from early February onwards, perhaps even
earlier. Their natural companions are the Lenten roses or forms of
helleborus Orientalis.
The basic commandment of hellebore fanciers is that they fancy somebody
else's variety. Now is the time to strike here, too: during the next week,
you can still divide old groups of these plants into pieces of a single stem
and pot-up the divisions without harm.
I learnt this late tip from a great grower, the late EB Anderson. By the
time I knew him, he already had six gardens and 60 years' experience behind
him, and I have found that his advice is usually the best.
Further into the future, fix your mind on Madonna lilies, those white
marvels of mid-June which might seem thoroughly out of the news this month.
Not at all: now is the moment for ordering and planting them, a chance which
is often missed because they need earlier attention than other lilies in the
trade.
Madonna lilies are unpredictable in their favours: either they like your
garden or they do not, and surveys suggest there is no connection between
their favour and virginal habits of their owners. The important thing is to
plant them this month, a few inches deep and preferably in soil which is
full of lime and quite stony. If you are wondering which lily is a Madonna,
it is the one which has confronted you on Tuscan holidays in Italian
paintings of the Annunciation.
For a nativity at Christmas, a Madonna lily has always struck me as a
pre-natal anachronism: how could Gabriel have found one in full flower in
March, assuming that the unusual pregnancy was of the usual duration?
Angels, no doubt, do not place bulb orders; still, this painterly muddle of
the seasons at least reminds us to act when we might otherwise forget and
order and plant this superb lily now.

December is the month to plant blooming bulbs such as tulips, hyacinths, crocus
and daffodils. Tulips and hyacinths need to be chilled six weeks before
planting.
</P>
<P>
Most bulbs prefer a sandy, well-drained soil, so it is a good idea to
incorporate organic matter such as redwood, peat moss and sand before planting.
Keep bulbs on the dry side until the new shoots emerge then water regularly and
fertilize with 10-10-15 every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Prune bare root fruit and nut trees, asparagus, berries and grapes. Again
incorporate organic matter before planting and water with B-1 to help initiate
root growth. Apply a dormant oil spray to smother dormant insects, and mulch
all newly-planted trees and shrubs to help protect from moisture loss and cold
damage.
</P>
<P>
Plant amaryllis bulbs in early December for Christmas color. Plant one bulb per
six-inch pot in a well-drained potting soil. Place in a sunny window and water
sparingly until flower stalk appears.

. . . . AND GENERAL DECEMBER CARE TIPS
</P>
<P>
Spruce up your container garden by filling it with colorful annuals or
perennials that bloom in the winter. Remember to water if the containers sit
under a covered area where the rains don't reach.
</P>
<P>
Tidy up around the lawn and garden -- prune infected tree branches, keep fallen
leaves raked and secure vining plants to trellises.
</P>
<P>
Look for your living Christmas tree now while there's a good selection.
</P>
<P>
Prepare plants for a cold winter by "hardening" them -- holding back on
nitrogen feeding in late fall and early winter discourages new growth.
</P>
<P>
Consider raising your flower beds for better drainage; this also allows
accumulated salts to be leached out the soil.
</P>
<P>
Snails and slugs love the damp winter conditions so use natural or chemical
controls to keep them from feeding on new bulb flower shoots and annuals.
</P>
<P>
When spraying to control pests and diseases in their dormant state, be sure to
cover the plant from top to bottom and even on the undersides of the leaves and
on the ground around the plant.
</P>
<P>
To keep weeds in check during the winter rains and give a neat appearance to
your flower beds, weed now and apply a layer of mulch.
</P>
<P>
Plant roses, strawberries and fruit trees this month.
</P>
<P>
Have you sprayed your peaches and nectarines to prevent peach leaf curl? If
not, do so immediately and then follow up with another spraying before the buds
swell.

ZAN THOMPSON: SEASON BLOSSOMS IN THE HILLS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Zan Thompson
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Spring has tossed in her petals in the Linda Vista Hills like a no-tomorrow
gambler.
</P>
<P>
Even my crotchety hill has never looked so handsome. The roses are as big as
lettuces, and even Mandy's cymbidiums are theatrically ruffled. We inherited
the cymbidiums six years ago, along with Mrs. Goldfarb the cat, because Mandy,
Patsy's daughter, and her husband were off to Japan on a tour of duty. Mandy
didn't think either the plants or the old lady cat would live through the
requisite quarantine, so they became our foster charges.
</P>
<P>
I haven't wanted to tell you but with everything in exuberant bloom, I feel you
are strong enough to hear that dear Mrs. Goldfarb with the green grape eyes,
has nipped off quickly and painlessly with a heart attack. No one knew how old
she was because she adopted Mandy 17 years before she died and she was a young
lady cat then. Patsy and I were consoled because we had managed to give the old
lady six years of pampering and quiet. When she lived with Mandy's family, she
contended with four kids and three Samoyeds. At our house, all she had to put
up with was an occasionally tidy kiss from Peaches.
</P>
<P>
The cymbidiums were not as adjustable. They hunkered down in their pot and
didn't do anything for four years. One day, our esteemed and treasured friend,
Dr. Arvid Underman, was at the house and looked sadly at the pouting flowers.
He kindly took them home to his greenhouse where he raises exotic blooms of
great beauty and ministers to malcontents belonging to other people. He
separated Mandy's cymbidiums, which were living in woefully overcrowded,
substandard conditions, and placed them in three different pots. This year, for
the first time in their lives, they are flinging forth great garlands of
flowers.
</P>
<P>
The irises I planted on the driveway hill are vying to see which one can
produce the most ruffled blooms. I love them all but the lemon yellow with the
bright orange center and the chocolate brown are probably my favorites.
</P>
<P>
Even the azaleas are blooming. (I know other people have great mounds of
azaleas every year but I never have.) And the kolenchoe, the breath of spring
and the amaryllis are loaded with blossom.
</P>
<P>
I know this isn't a patch on what other people have every year but for me, who
has growing trouble with everything except one giant, aboriginal known to us as
the geranium that ate Pasadena, it's a veritable fairyland of bloom.
</P>
<P>
I carefully pulled up the tulip bulbs a week or so ago when they stopped
blooming. Tulips are gorgeous but they are niggardly with their flowers. One
flower to a stalk and that's it. I have always been told to refrigerate the
bulbs so the dumb things will think they are slumbering in the dark cool of the
forest and be ready to be put in the ground in the fall, where they will bloom
in the early spring. I have never been able to make that work.
</P>
<P>
Someone -- Doug, Tim, Patsy or maybe old Green Thumb herself -- has always
thrown them out during the winter months, thinking they were long-tailed onions
or just because of boredom with looking at them. Last winter, Patsy threw them
in a stew by mistake, and although I am not suggesting this is a gourmet
fillip, we didn't know the difference. Recently, I read an article by a tulip
specialist who said to toss the bulbs out and start all over again in the fall.
</P>
<P>
I am sorry to say that I have nothing for a garden encore. When these pretty
things are finished, it's back to geraniums and roses for the rest of the year.
Actually, that's not too bad. The rose bushes get to be big, hulking brutes
with thorns like Malay daggers and have blooms until they are pruned in
January.
</P>
<P>
Happy springtime, everybody, and I think I'll just go ahead and throw out the
tulip bulbs right now.

FT  23 APR 94 / Gardening: Jump on the spring bandwagon - Why good gardens
are more than a two-month wonder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When gardeners start out, they think naturally of summer. They pile on the
roses, the mid-summer borders, and their defences against a dull July. The
summer initiative grows and, in time, it suggests new openings: has anyone
ever pre-planned a serious garden by mapping it in advance? I doubt it,
because it develops a framework after five years built on the corpses of 100
failures.
After five years on my new site, I am now spring-mad and ceasing to worry
about plantings that will continue beyond August. I have re-learned an old
lesson: good gardens are not a two-month wonder. They extend from February
to early November, with an artful emphasis on their early months.
Why did I start so short-sightedly? I began with flower beds and evergreen
hedges but I forgot to thicken the outlying boundaries with enough forms of
early prunus, winter-flowering cherry, early okame, upright umeneko and
others. I planted roses which now detest my soil, but the winter-flowering
shrubs should have gone in first.
This time, to limit my job, I told myself some of the wrong things when I
started out: that I would leave the flowering cherries to suburbia; that I
would cut out spring bedding; that magnolias would never flourish on my lime
soil; and that spring-flowering border plants were better to write about
than to grow. I planted evergreen hedges, so that the yew could develop
brown patches: I even left the bulbs until last.
Now I see my mistake. In the early years, you seldom visit other gardens:
you are too busy taming your own. Only now can I see what others have made
from the same season.
I envy older gardens their grand old trees at this time of year. I defer to
the magnolias in the Hillier Arboretum, the camellias in Richmond's Isabella
plantation, or the white-flowered Amelanchiers which Rudyard Kipling must
have planted at Batemans, the National Trust property in East Sussex near
Tunbridge Wells, where they ought still to be at their best.
I have given them five years' start by not planting spring-flowering trees
as soon as I began. I now think that they are as essential to a sense of
place as evergreens which we urge you to put in first. But I also notice how
great places cope with the bleakness of Britain's early spring by casual
under-planting and how they have two ways of coping with bulbs.
The under-planting has not exactly passed me by. We now grow wallflowers
among the summer borders and discard them after flowering. A few blocks go a
long way and, in smaller beds, I now resort to the best of all
forget-me-nots - the small, dark form called Indigo.
*something in here (HP) *
It pays to go further. In a great garden such as Sissinghurst, in Kent, you
can see the impact of early-flowering extras, grown in groups or occasional
isolation among the surrounding emptiness of spring. Sissinghurst is looking
enviable in spite of cold, wet weather.
In the White Garden, there is easy, white-flowered arabis for colour now.
and there are groups of the easy, pale pink primula Guinivere, taking up no
space but making most of the impact in the main July beds. It takes only a
bush or two of the bright pink prunus Tenella to enliven an entire section,
while someone has had the bright idea of growing a few sprigs of white
prunus Cistena in the garden's front courtyard.
I am still waiting for forget-me-nots, but these established gardens have
used enough early perennials casually among their framework to double their
season of interest. Beginners should remember to do the same.
When I started, I decided also to leave bulbs until last. After all, why
plant tulips and daffodils when you may decide to dig up their ground and
change it?
For the first time, I was ready to move forward last autumn and I added
blocks of narcissi in time for this wonderful year for the family. This
spring, almost every form has been wonderful, but my top five for
naturalisation are those with paler flowers - Geranium, Ice Follies, Barrett
Browning, Winston Churchill - and the later so-called Pheasant's Eye.
They look fine but, by delaying, I realise that I have actually lost
important ground.
What I always knew, and now remember, is that the best shows of bulbs are
colonies, not garrisons. In our great gardens, the best displays were not
planted by the thousand. They were introduced gently, given time to know
each other, and then allowed to run wild when they decided they were
friends.
These colonies take time to spread and develop, but it is vastly better to
buy a few small groups of bulbs which know how to seed themselves, and start
them off manageably as soon as you begin a new garden or gardening phase.
The big blocks can be introduced as occupying forces at any later time: the
narcissi in long grass or the modern tulips by the hundred to brighten the
flower beds.
New gardeners usually receive the same fashionable advice: begin with the
bones first. Nowadays, the bones mean firm hedges of evergreen, some arches,
perhaps a wall or even a fancy conservatory or temple if you want to spend
your way out of bleakness. We tell you to begin with yew, box, climbing
roses and the main specimen trees.
None of this advice is wrong, but I would add what experience has taught me
twice: when you start, jump on the future bandwagon of spring and never
think of your garden as a place essentially for the months from May until
October.

<LEADPARA>  WHILE September pops up three-quarters of the way through the calendar, for
many people it is the season of new beginnings -- a new school year, a new
football season, the Jewish New Year, a new symphony season and the start of
the first hockey season for the San Jose Sharks.;   For gardeners, it is the
start-over season. Longtime soil toilers know this is the ideal month for
cleaning out the old and putting in the new.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     For those who've thought but never acted, it's the ideal time to become a
gardener.;   Jobs both big and small are on the must-do list. Here's how to
get started:; Vegetables; With the weather already turning cool, you can plant
all the winter vegetables. Look for seeds and six-packs of peas, chard,
broccoli, lettuce, cauliflower, carrots, radishes, beets, cabbage and onion
sets. Root crops will grow in light shade; others need full sun. Give soil a
fresh start by digging in a three- to four-inch layer of soil amendment
(compost, leaf mold, redwood soil conditioner). Mix an all-purpose fertilizer
(10-10-10) into the top two or three inches of soil, then sow seeds and put in
transplants. If planting seeds, cover them lightly -- 1/4-inch deep is fine.
Keep seed bed moist until seeds germinate; then start cutting back on
watering. Drip emitters are a good bet.; Flowers; Fall flowers are just
beginning to show up in six-packs, but seed racks are overflowing with the new
varieties. Plant annuals and perennials including pansies, calendulas, sweet
peas, cyclamens, primroses, begonias, coral bells, coreopsis, salvias,
snapdragons, stocks, statice, verbena and violas. Sow seeds of wildflowers
later in the month. See planting directions for vegetables.; Bulbs; If you're
looking for the lazy gardener's flower bed, check out the bulbs. Few plants
produce more flowers with less work. Plant spring-flowering tulips, daffodils,
hyacinths, crocus, ranunculus, alliums, Dutch irises, scillia, muscari and
watsonia. Choose big, plump, firm bulbs. Tulips and hyacinths need a four-week
chill period in the refrigerator. Other bulbs go into the soil without further
ado.;  Lawn; The best time to plant -- or repair -- the lawn is from now
through the last week in October. Seed will germinate without heavy watering,
and new sod will bond to the soil quickly. De-thatch and aerate hard-packed
turf areas, fertilize to carry the grass through winter and use a pre-emergent
control for broadleaf weeds.;  Trees, shrubs; Just about anything you can find
at the nursery can be planted now. Transplant trees, shrubs, vines and ground
covers while the soil and air temperatures are still warm to give them a full
season's root development over those planted in spring. Water in the new
plantings with a mild solution of a balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) to promote
new root growth and reduce transplant shock. Add mulch for frost protection.;
Compost; As you clean up the garden, don't even think about throwing all those
goodies into the trash. Make a compost pile instead. Pile six inches or so of
leaves, grass clippings and green garden debris, along with egg shells and
peelings from the kitchen. Chop up bulky items to help them decompose faster.
Sprinkle a fertilizer high in nitrogen (12-12-12) and spread a two-inch layer
of soil on top of it all. Keep building the pile in a similar manner. Turn it
every few weeks if you wish. The winter rains will trigger the compost heap
into activity. The compost will be "done" in time for spring planting.;
Fertilize; Give trees, shrubs and ground covers a light feeding with a
low-nitrogen fertilizer to help them overwinter without putting out fresh, new
growth that could be damaged in cold weather. Switch to a 0-10-10 fertilizer
for azaleas, camellias, gardenias and rhododendrons to encourage the
development of next season's blossoming buds. Feed roses lightly and water for
their last bloom cycle before going dormant.;  Houseplants; During the short
days of winter, houseplants rest from growing and need less fertilizer and
water. So, cut back -- but don't eliminate -- both water and food. Groom
plants by clipping scraggly shoots and brown leaves. Thoroughly check for
pests, and wash them away with plain water, or spray with insecticidal soap if
needed. Flush away salts in the soil by thoroughly drenching the soil twice.
Move plants closer to a sunny window as the days shorten.;  Manure; Spread it
around. Spread a three- to four-inch layer of animal manure (not pet
droppings) on garden beds. Rain and time will help it decompose and it will be
ready to turn into the soil by spring. Horse manure is best, but cows,
chickens, rabbits and poultry also have a lot to offer. Don't use raw or fresh
manure as it usually burns plant tissues. Or, plant a "green manure" crop such
as fava beans, rye or clover. In the spring till it under to enrich the soil.;
Clean up; It's a dirty job, but someone has to do it. Pull or hoe weeds. Trim
back unruly branches on trees and shrubs that could be damaged in winter
storms, but hold off serious pruning until deciduous trees and shrubs drop all
their leaves. Pull up the summer annuals and vegetables that have done their
thing, but let tomatoes, squash and pumpkins continue to ripen. Pick up fallen
fruit and rake leaves because they are a haven to overwintering pests. Spiders
are everywhere, but leave them alone: They'll soon go away on their own.  </TEXT>

. . . AND GENERAL OCTOBER CARE TIPS
</P>
<P>
This is the time to start planning your fall garden. Prepare all beds by
pulling summer annuals and adding organic matter, such as peat moss or redwood
compost to the soil. Turn over soil, incorporate organic matter, then add a
balanced granular fertilizer, such as 10-10-5 or 14-14-14.
</P>
<P>
Start looking in local nurseries for fall annuals such as snap dragons, violas,
poppies and pansies. Plan and prepare your garden now, but wait until October
to plant. Fall is a good time to divide all spring-blooming perennials, such as
alstromerias or campanulas.
</P>
<P>
Many of the spring-blooming bulbs, such as narcissus or tulips, will be
available this month. Buy now while the selection is best, but do not plant
until December.
</P>
<P>
Store tulips and hyacinths in the refrigerator for at least six weeks before
planting to ensure proper flower formation. Early fall is the best time to
start zonal and ivy geranium tip cuttings. Take cuttings from the new growth,
preferably without bulbs or flowers. Dip the cuttings into a rooting hormone
and place in perlite. Keep in filtered light and slightly moist until roots
have formed, then transplant into a well-drained potting soil.

<HEADLINE>  THE WEEKEND GARDENER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>  Both big and small dahlias will be displayed this weekend at the annual show
by the John E. Stowell Dahlia Society. The event will be held Saturday and
Sunday at Westgate Mall, Campbell and Saratoga avenues, San Jose, during mall
hours. Free admission.; BEST BUY; Bring home bulbs; Spring-flowering bulbs
from Holland are bargains. Look for daffodils and anemones, priced 10 cents
each; tulips, 22 cents, and hyacinths, 49 cents. Or, buy mixed bulbs in
packages, from $1.75 per package.; TOP JOBS; Plant everything; With mild fall
weather holding on, plant shrubs, ground covers, trees, annual flowers,
vegetables and perennials. Also, clean up the yard to discourage overwintering
pests and diseases. Keep after snails; they never give up.; LAWN; Plant or
repair; From now through October is the premium time to put in a new lawn from
seed or sod, or overseed and repair a worn lawn. Apply a lawn fertilizer using
a product with a high amount of nitrogen, such as 22-3-3. Also apply a
broadleaf weed control to take care of dandelions and similar weeds. A good
bet is a combination weed control plus lawn fertilizer to cover both bases.
Also, aerate the soil and de-thatch thickly matted grass.; VEGETABLES; Sow
easy; To get a big harvest from the winter garden, sow beets, bok choy,
carrots, chard, lettuce, green onions, parsley, peas, radishes, spinach and
turnips. Let some herbs reseed themselves to overwinter in the garden. Dill,
especially, seems to germinate better this way.; YOUR CHECKLIST; (box) Switch
to a 0-10-10 fertilizer for azaleas, camellias, gardenias, and rhododendrons
to encourage formation of next spring's blossoming buds.; (box) Divide and
replant crowded perennials including agapanthus, daylilies and yarrow.; (box)
Repot houseplants and place them near a south-facing window so they can have
optimum light during the short winter days ahead.; (box) Prolong bloom on
tuberious begonias, dahlias and fuchsias by pinching off faded flowers.  </TEXT>

FT  05 DEC 92 / Gardening: Dealing with a floating front lawn - Tackling the
ravages of wet weather
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE HAS never been such a prelude to deep winter: rain, rain and more
rain, until even the authorities in Kent have had to lift their ban on
hosepipes. Before you paddle off Christmas shopping, there are urgent
problems in your floating garden: some of them are stored for the future,
others are oversights which we like to pretend do not exist.
Looking forward, I see problems from footprints and serious danger for
flower pots. We cannot give up weeding, cutting down and replanting just
because it is a wet year, but these jobs oblige us to walk on flower beds.
Wellingtons squash the ground between border plants and flatten it into wet
cake. Whenever you are walking on the soil, be sure to lay down short planks
of wood and use them as your pedestals and tractor-treads. By spreading your
weight they stop you packing the soil so that it becomes unworkable next
spring. Fork over the ground beneath the planks as you remove them and beat
your retreat.
Flower pots need more urgent attention. The soil inside them is sopping wet
and gallons of rainwater have now drained through ornamental terracotta
urns. The first heavy frost will ice the pots on to any hard surface on
which they are standing: iced bottoms are a major reason why expensive pots
from Spain or the Far East disintegrate outdoors.
Instead, stand them on two upturned bricks or stones so that their drainage
holes are raised above the ground. The water will then run through without
freezing the pot on to its supporting surface. This protection needs action
now, before nature compounds her hostility and freezes up before Christmas.
Inside urns and large pots, remember that flower bulbs are having a
prolonged baptism. Usually, I leave them uncovered and merely hope that
winter will not freeze them and turn them to a soft mush. This year, I am
considering the example of some of our biggest public gardens where pots are
surfaced with thick plastic, lashed into place until late winter.
These defences cannot remain in place much later than the end of January
because hyacinths, daffodils and so forth will then be nosing their way
through the ground. This year, however, the soil begins from such a wet
point that a fall of snow on top of it will multiply the muddiness and the
mess from thawing frost. It may be wise to cover up potted bulbs for safety,
at least for the next six weeks or so.
As for the oversights, they concern tulips, spring bedding and the other
Dutch bulbs which you bought forwards in August, fearing chaos in the
currency markets. The fall in the pound has already pushed their prices up
by 15 per cent and nobody wants to be losing stock for next year. After a
call auction on tulips, I am still struggling to plant the delivered bulbs
in all the drizzle. What can you do if you still have tulips, wallflowers,
forget-me-nots and even some crocuses with young shoots like yellow tusks
sitting unplanted in brown paper bags?
Despite the books' advice, all is not lost. Tulips, certainly, will not fail
to flower if you plant them as deep as you can during the next fortnight. In
wet ground, accurate planting is more difficult, but you must be sure that
the bulb is sitting firmly on earth underneath it, not sideways on a pocket
of air. Indoors, some of the bulbs may have lost their outer brown tunics,
but even if you plant them looking white and naked, most of them will still
survive. They are merely more prone to diseases, especially to mould in wet
soil. If any of them are already showing tell-tale spots of
greenish-blue,throw them out before planting.
Unplanted crocuses are all shoots, no roots, but they will settle, flower
and survive even if you plant them as late as the next 10 days. Th effects
may show in 1994 when fewer corms will have grown on and made up for lost
progress. However, I still have some satisfactory plants which were planted
as late as December 18: human delay is not as dangerous to them as the
deadly attention of mice.
Forget-me-nots and wallflowers are much more obliging. Plants can still be
moved around whenever the ground is workable: those which I planted in early
October have made little more progress and those still waiting on the
sidelines. This year, the main difficulty is that wallflowers have made such
wretchedly small plants. Do not blame your carelessness: professional
growers have fared no better and tell me that they blame a dry start, a cold
spell in summer and the rain from July onwards which flattened the soil and
prevented plants from forming proper roots.
Throughout the autumn, I have been grappling with wallflowers in my two
chosen colours, Primrose Bedder and Scarlet Bedder, thinking vague thoughts
about which I would choose if they were females, not wallflowers. As plants,
nobody could have picked them for choice, because they are under-developed.
Meanwhile, I am making the best of my trump card for spring gardening: it
involves the scattering of bedding plants in the gaps down herbaceous
borders. Six years ago, we started to revive this old unorthodoxy in the
long borders in my Oxford college. Wallflowers are much the best bet,
because their roots do not run hungrily and drain too much goodness from the
soil. The art is to pack in separate clumps of wallflowers in civilised
colours wherever border plants have retreated ot their main root stocks and
left gaps in the soil. Wallflowers fill in and can be ripped out and thrown
away when the border begins to fill out in late May.
Even now, it is not too late for this easy task. If you have a choice, avoid
the mixed colours which are most widely available because they include a
high proportion of the vigorous orange varieties. Their colour is rather
beastly, a poor mix for the deeper reds and pale yellows. The job is so
rewarding because it doubles a border's season in the simplest way.
These spring bedding plants do not require their own special bed, let alone
a personal space on a roundabout by courtesy of your local council. They are
plants like any others: walk the plank on wet soil between your borders and
even at this late date, you can strike a blow for a brighter spring.

FT  24 OCT 92 / Gardening: Amateur advice at the experts' expense - Robin
Lane Fox has been taking his pot plants indoors in order to outwit the wise
old owls in his garden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT, the owls have been hooting in my garden. By daytime, an
owl-hoot means death, death for Shakespearian heroes, deadly omens for
classical generals and something nasty for columnists who have been much too
slow to plant their tulips.
I have been checking for fire blight and have feared honey fungus: I now
know why they were hooting. They were moping for my half-hardy heliotropes
and other tender plants in pot, but I have outwitted them by taking the
plants indoors before the frosts.
This year, nobody could grudge their half-hardy plants a long warm rest.
They have flourished in pots but none have flourished more than these
scented heliotropes. Ten varieties are listed in The Plant Finder, from
Chatsworth to Lord Roberts: mine is the 11th, White Swan, a heliotrope which
has pale mauve flowers and a scent straight from warm French heaven.
Heliotrope is also known as cherry pie. Its scent combines powder and
chocolate and softens the insensitivity of bedding out in France.
If you want the real thing, you need to beg some cuttings from a named form
during the next fortnight when their owners bring them under shelter.
Varieties from a seed packet have none of the scent and delicacy of the true
old Edwardian beauties.
Like most of the best things in pots, these plants are not hardy and so you
have to follow October discipline. Last week's frost took out the weaker
members of the garden unless you had anticipated it. Perhaps you still have
fuchsias, verbenas, white penstemons or any of those trailing plants with
silver leaves: if so, put them in a frost-proof shed immediately, or else my
owls will be proved right.
If you are putting a large plant or semi-shrub to rest, cut it back quite
hard and see that it is soaked heavily in water before resting in its new
home. By cutting it hard, you encourage those first green shoots which every
economist is hoping to see nowadays.
I prefer to leave these young shoots on the plant and only take them as
cuttings in early spring: some books suggest that you should root them
immediately and leave them in the same pot until March. I find that they rot
more often than not.
Each year, gardening in pots tests the wisdom of the handbooks and throws up
new possibilities. I have learned to follow rules which were being ignored
ten years ago in dictionaries: they are still being ignored in the RHS's new
Dictionary of Gardening.
They originate from amateur gardeners who have a sharp eye for decoration
and are not merely horticulturalists. Their main rule is simple: pack in
many more plants than any expert dares to tell you in print. Begin with a
pot at least 2 ft wide and into it you can pack a dozen different varieties.
They all tangle together and defy the usual wisdom so long as they are
heavily fed and watered.
This year, the reason why the heliotropes were so good is surely that I
planted them in almost nothing but animal manure. As the season ends, I can
also endorse the use of water-retaining crystals or jelly, mixed into the
compost when you plant it.
The Swel-gel really worked and I found myself watering some very heavy
plantings only twice a week, a bearable routine.
With the last of summer out of the way, the field is then clear to break the
rules with bulbs. Once again, the books and the RHS dictionary are behind
the times: they do not tell you to plant your bulbs in layers.
To my intense surprise, this method works. It allows you to put the tulips
about nine inches deep on the bottom layer and then plant a second storey of
narcissi about three inches above them and then round off near the rooftops
with a layer of crocusses just near the surface of the soil.
Like the traffic on a main street in Naples, they somehow manage to queue
without signals and move forwards without colliding.
The crocusses flower first; the narcissi then nose their way between them
and eventually, the late-flowering tulips emerge through the jungle. In one
pot, you can enjoy three seasons: they are not cheap but they are much more
fun than an ordinary old pot full of scillas.
Once again, amateurs have discovered a trick which the experts ignored for
years. Gardening in pots brings the best out of private ingenuity; pack the
bulbs in, layer upon layer, like passengers on the London Underground. They
give you three gardens in once space: this time, it is a real hoot, yours at
the expert's expense.

FT  01 OCT 94 / Gardening: Stirred for spring - Robin Lane Fox offers a tip
on how to make the most of your bulbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cool, wet weather has rescued gardens for a suitable autumn finale and,
with renewed faith, I am planning for next spring at this crucial moment. We
have to stir ourselves now if we do not want a bleak April, waiting for
leaves to return to the trees. We must also stir ourselves if we do not want
a drab house in February.
Let me first pass on a lesson that is especially gratifying because most of
the nurserymen have not yet woken up to it. (There is not a word about it,
either, in any of the Royal Horticultural Society pamphlets, literature and
encyclopaedias which have been fast-breeding recently.) As a result, I can
tell the trade how to double its market and make us all spend twice as much
for better results.
It should start telling us that when we plant bulbs for use in the house, we
should pile them up in layers, one above the other. I mentioned this
revolution last year, having heard about it from that revolutionary
organisation, the Women's Institute. I can now confirm that it works.
Underneath last year's hyacinths, we planted a lower layer of the white
tulip Purissima. The hyacinths flowered late in January and, when we had cut
off the dead pieces and reduced the length of leaves by half, the tulips
appeared magically in bud and doubled the room life of the entire planting.
Bolder souls put a layer of crocus on top of the hyacinths, and some of the
robust and cheap yellow-flowered narcissi Soleil d'Or underneath. One lady
stockbroker, with a very deep container, went further. She wrote to say she
spent a happy Sunday packing in crocus, hyacinths, narcissi and, lastly, the
yellow-flowered lily tulip, West Point, which surfaced through the debris
late in March and gave a fourth season in a single bowl. She considered the
result to be the one investment she made last autumn which was actually
worth more by late March.
Like all revolutions, this one is expensive, but it doubles or quadruples
your return on time and space. But when I first heard of the WI suggestion,
I thought it must be a joke. Surely the shoots of the narcissus would
dislodge the hyacinths and the tulips would be stuck underneath in the
traffic jam? But no.
The key to success is a deep flower pot. The cheapest are plastic, but they
are even more hideous than the average run of glorified cache-pots from a
country gift shop. Indoors, I concealed them or planted directly into the
deep, fluted pots of off-white china sold by the Reject Shop at up to Pounds
9 each. While these have no holes in the bottom, this did not seem to matter
last year because I prepared the soil carefully and minimised watering after
planting.
The old way of minimising watering was to use a special bulb fibre, full of
oyster-grit and willing to retain a soaking for several months. Nowadays, I
cannot find this old-fashioned bulb fibre in general stores: what they sell
under that name is simply peat, recycled under a seasonal label. I have now
given up and simply use earth from the garden into which I mix a very small
dose of water-retention crystals.
Prepare the soil in a separate container by watering it, mixing in the
crystals like ground almonds into a Mediterranean cake: then, wet the
mixture lightly in order to activate the jelly. Next, pack it into the
bowls, making sure that you have not over-jellied the mixture; otherwise,
the bulbs will rot.
Follow the usual rules: put the bowls in a dark, unheated cupboard or
frost-proof shed where they can develop roots; the crystals should mean
there will be no need for more water. Bring them into a cold room after two
months, when the central layer of hyacinths should already be showing about
2in of yellow-looking growth above the soil. Give them a week or so in which
to develop away from central heating, then space out their entry into your
main rooms.
Layered bulbs will not flower for a second season indoors, but they seem to
recover outdoors and perform no worse than hyacinths which have been growing
in the usual segregation. Those of you marooned in London or a flat without
a serious garden ought to enjoy this multiplication of results in the same
space.
Outdoors, my plans now regularly concern two families to which I thought I
had waved goodbye not long after this column began. The bother of growing
one's own wallflowers and forget-me-nots was simply too much for today's
academic part-timer: anyway, I began to tell myself how frightful those
mustard-yellow wallflowers looked on Britain-in-bloom town roundabouts.
Of course, it was sour grapes, because wallflowers have an exquisite scent
and come in far better colours. They are back in my life with a vengeance,
especially since finding a local wholesaler who supplies the councils and
does the donkey work for me.
My lesson here is extremely simple: wallflowers are shallow-rooted and can
be grown in groups between the dormant plants of your main borders without
detracting from their later seasons. I keep returning to this discovery
because it has doubled the shelf life of my flowerbeds, just as layering has
doubled the life of the bulbs.
I plant groups of up to 20 wallflowers in reds, crimsons and the less robust
Ivory White (which is neither ivory nor white) and space them at
considerable intervals in the front to middle rows of the borders. There is
no need to go to the expense and trouble of a continuous carpet; in spring,
a few repeated groups of colour lead the eye down the bare earth and are,
visually, more effective. The inter-planting with wallflowers allows me to
cut down a dying border late in October, running two jobs together.
Lastly, the forget-me-nots. I have tried to live without them but I miss
them too much, just as the name tells us we should. Again, if you hunt
around, there is sure to be a big grower for the bedding trade nearby who
will do a deal on pre-grown plants in a serious quantity.
My lesson here is much less forgettable: if you have the choice, always go
for the smaller Indigo, not the taller and looser Royal Blue. Indigo is so
much brighter, deeper and more remarkable: it is twice the plant and, only
when I had been unfaithful to it for a few seasons, did I realise how much
better it was.
Once again, a few groups go a very long way; and, as it is so compact, you
can fit it into smaller beds near the house to flower in those weeks before
everything starts running wild.

<LEADPARA>  For an "instant" preview of things to come, treat yourself to pots of
flowering plants featured now at floral shops and supermarkets. Bulbous
plants, such as tulips, daffodils, crocus and Dutch iris, are unfailing
reminders of spring. Select tightly budded specimens so you can enjoy watching
the flowers open. In addition to the bulbous plants, you will find
multi-colored azaleas, cinerarias, primulas, kalanchoes, cyclamens and others
that carry the message of spring. Forced branches are a natural foil for the
potted flowering plants. Simply place them among the plants to enhance the

   Truth in Gardening: Uprooting Black-Market Bulbs

   Call me bulb-indulgent. I do a lot of preprintemps
primping. I dibble the fall away. Still, this past year I
troweled uneasy on the bulb front.
   It's not just the pang I feel each time I slash through
the heart of a quondam bulb. It's the guilt of certainty that
my mail-order Minors -- the hardy cyclamens, winter aconites,
snowdrops, leucojums, anemones, hoop-petticoat narcissus,
etc. -- are not indeed good Dutch burgher bulbs ("Product of
Holland" labels misled me) but are bulb endemics plundered
from the wild gene ponds of the Levant.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   What bulbwised me up was the historic
bulb-origins-labeling agreement signed in May between the
Dutch bulb industry and the Natural Resources Defense
Council, the World Wildlife Fund (TRAFFIC-U.S.A.) and the
Fauna and Flora Preservation Society (U.K.). Thirty-one Minor
Bulbs, customarily wild-dug, packaged and passed off as
Dutch, would henceforth exit the Netherlands with the usual
"Product of Holland" mislabel, but also verily tagged "Bulbs
From Wild Source." In 1992, such of the 31 Minors as are by
then propagated will carry "Bulbs Grown From Cultivated
Stock" birth certificates; so will the Majors, come 1995.
   Hard upon the debut of bulb-etiology-by-label, in July,
came Smith &amp; Hawken's "Bulb Book." The catalog commenced with
a righteous sermon on the bulb millions "dug from the wild .
. . disguised as cultivated or propagated plants {and}
shipped to consumers."
   "Much plant extinction," the catalog continued, "is the
direct consequence of commercial collecting to satisfy world
markets for bulbs . . . In the past, companies (ourselves
included) have suavely assured customers that `our' bulbs
were . . . not wild-collected." In the present, suavely
wiser, S&amp;H names 13 bulb binomials "of questionable source,"
which it has dropped. "We offer only cultivated . . . bulbs"
and "have chosen not to offer certain varieties . . . until
there is reliable certification . . . authenticating the
bulbs as commercially propagated."
   Ethical gardening has arrived, and none too soon. I say
this by the guilt of hindsight, recollecting my own entry
into the world of the Bulb Minors in the early '80s via
Louise Beebe Wilder ("Adventures With Hardy Bulbs," 1936),
Elizabeth Lawrence ("The Little Bulbs," 1957) and E.A. Bowles
("I have an insatiable desire for cyclamen.") In 1984, an
obscure New England catalog that had, the year before, slaked
my own insatiable desire for cyclamen ("rare and glorious
little charmers"), mentioned that, "due to the problems in
the Middle East, no white or red botanical cyclamen of any
kind were available." Same for Star of Bethlehem and
Sternbergia clusiana: "Not available this year. Middle East
Situation."
   That the Mideast had to do with my private bulb life was
news. I phoned the Yankee nurseryman for an ME situationer.
"These wild cyclamen are collected all through the mountains
along the Eastern Mediterranean -- in Turkey, Syria,
Lebanon," he obliged. "The collectors stake them out when
they're in bloom, then go back and bring them out on
camelback and in caravans. Very romantic. But right now the
collectors are scared stiff to go into Lebanon. And we're
having problems with the Turkish government." He hoped "the
Israelis will get into cyclamen. Israel is beginning to grow
the Star of Bethlehem. Though," he sighed, "they've got their
problems."
   My Middle East gardening problems became acute in 1985,
upon reading "The Laundered Bulb Trade Is a Dirty Business"
in the New York Botanical Garden's Garden magazine. Sara
Oldfield of the World Conservation Monitoring Centre's
Wildlife Monitoring Unit (U.K.) wrote: "Every year, millions
of flower bulbs are dug up from the natural bulb fields of
Mediterranean Europe, the Mideast and Central Asia to . . .
satisfy the horticultural demand." She identified Turkey,
"extraordinarily rich in bulb species" as "the largest
exporter of wild bulbs." Very unromantically she described
"truckloads of Turkish bulbs . . . regularly delivered to the
Netherlands for sale . . . to the international market," and
warned, "long-time garden favorites are becoming . . .
extinct in the wild," as "illegally wild-dug" bulbs, in vast
numbers, "end up in American gardens."
   The international bulb-rustling cartel's ultimate consumer
is, of course, Everygardener. "Bulb buying and growing is a
major aspect of gardening -- everybody is a bulb gardener,"
Ms. Oldfield said, though "until now, authorities and
gardeners alike have been unaware of the magnitude of the
illicit traffic in bulbs."
   Everygardener-USA was interring a gigabulb a year, and I
was Everygardener, party to illicit bulb practices. Abashed,
I began asking my suppliers if my own delightful misc. Minors
were illegit. To a bulbsman, they straightened their faces
and said: "These are DUTCH bulbs]"
   Something on the order of 100 million bulb wildlings move
through the trade each year. Since World War II the industry
has exploited Turkey, preeminently, as a vast free-dig,
open-pit, bulb mine: 71 million anemones, 20 million
cyclamen, 62 million leucojums, 111 million winter aconites,
200 million snowdrops were extracted from Turkey in the '80s,
without any documentable attempt to leave behind a viable
bulb population for future harvest. (Anent the Middle East
Situation 1991, would the talked-of Turkish second front in
the Bush War for a time interdict Turkey's bulb-mining
operations?)
   Among New World bulb activists, the "eminence grise" is
Marjorie Arundel of the Garden Club of America, a gardener
possessed of a Narcissus poeticus writing style. "The
ancestors of our modern tulips and narcissi are classic
little forms among the rich floral treasure evolved through
the millenia," she wrote in 1986. Yet, "the world's loved
bulbous-rooted flora may be facing extinction." Her cri de
corm: "It is unthinkable for gardeners to knowingly add to
the destruction of these little patriarchs, the floral gene
resources of the planet." Doffing her white goat gloves in
the August 1989 GCA Bulletin she declared: "You can, quite
simply, screen out all wild bulbs offered and become an
effective defense attorney at once for the little wild,
patriarch bulbs without whose genes there would be no tulips,
no daffodils and no catalogues. No one will want to be caught
wielding a `smoking trowel' . . . DO NOT WIELD THE SMOKING
TROWEL]]]"
   The GCA advocates substitution of nano-bulb hybrids. ("Can
be planted in good conscience," NRDC.) Shocked "to see this
world heritage in Mediterranean genetic resources up for
sale," Mrs. Arundel and cohorts have suggested bulb-ranching
in the Minors' homelands. (A Peace Corps project?)
   Several catalogs (Smith &amp; Hawken, Burpee, Van Tubergen)
have cut bulbs of dubious origin, but the NYBG seems stuck on
old-style, oblivious bulbopoly. Despite the years of
wild-bulb consciousness-raising in Garden magazine, the NYBG
Shops again sold wild bulbs this season -- some even labeled
"Bulbs From Wild Source."
   In 1987, when the NYBG sent members a brochure, "Bulbs for
Permanent Effects: A professional selection by the New York
Botanical Garden," offering "many rare bulbs that are not
generally available elsewhere," an in-Garden wild-bulb
imbroglio ensued. Staffers were outraged that this major
environmental education institution was hawking wild-dug
bulbs -- nine species of the 31 now on the Index of Forbidden
Bulbs. This practice has ended, and the NYBG Shops' wild-bulb
brokering ought to, as well. Everygardener hopes the NYBG
will begin reading bulb-origins labels, since its PR man,
Karl Lauby, stated yesterday, "We do not sell bulbs collected
from the wild knowingly."

bono bulb DAs, Made-in-U.S.A. Bulb Minors for some of the

   The Marxist Gardener's Favorite Flower

<LP>
   My lily inventory gets done during high summer, an August
day with liliums nodding off all through the garden. (Not
counted are all the garden's misliliums: day lilies, calla
lilies, trout lilies, etc.) Despite a 10-year lily binge, and
the reliable summer reappearance of Enchantment, Imperial
Gold, Black Dragon, Pink Perfection and dozens of others --
I'm still short liliums. And so, each fall I order more,
thinking with thanks of Jan de Graaff (lily trademarked
JAGRA), the lily's 20th-century impresario.
   During the 40 years to 1970 that he was proprietor of the
Oregon Bulb Farms, Mr. de Graaff, who died last year at 86,
went about inventing the modern business of lilies, those
easygoing garden hybrids that Everygardener now grows as a
matter of course. By systematically building tough lilies --
indifferent to abuse and neglect, wonderfully showy but
virtually gardenerproof -- JAGRA made lilies ("the garden
Cinderellas" by his reckoning) that had hitherto owned the
rep of regally troublesome, demanding, finicky garden prima
donnas into horto-democratic garden regulars, no-nonsense
plants like daffodils and tulips, plants for hoi polloi.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. de Graaff's modern lily hybrids fall into the much
touted no-maintenance category, and gardeners need not be
much concerned with their cultivation. Rather, great care
should be taken with the initial purchase, siting and
planting. Once felicitously situated -- provided they were
plump, zaftig bulbs to begin with -- lilies can be ignored
for years.
   JAGRA once summed up the ease of lilies: "Lilies need no
pruning, no constant spraying, no pinching and disbudding, no
mulching or mounding to survive the winter." Nevertheless,
over the course of 40 years in the lily patch (his massive
breeding program involved lily tryouts by casts of tens of
thousands and Mr. de Graaff became the Cecil B. DeMille of
lilies), JAGRA dropped occasional declaratives re what lilies
do look like, since even regular garden plants respond better
to a little TLC. For those who would do well by the lilies of
their fields, herewith a culling of Jan de Graaff's Basic
Lily Observances:
   -- "The natural and preferable time for planting lily
bulbs is in the fall," Mr. de Graaff believed (in extremis;
earliest spring is just barely permissible); plant liliums in
a sunny, sloping spot (if possible) or in a raised bed.
   -- Except for the Madonna Lily (with its shallow
preference), plant the big bulbs fairly deep, covering with
4-6 inches soil.
   -- Sharp drainage sub-lily is an inviolable rule. Mr. de
Graaff once described a quick sonar soil-suitability test:
"If, when you plunge a spade into the soil, there is a faint
but quite audible grating sound, then, other things being
equal, lilies will like that soil."
   -- Open "air drainage" supra-lily is an absolute de
Graaffian requisite, "since stagnant air makes a breeding
place for fungus troubles."
   -- As to soil-type: neutral to slightly acid, friable,
fertile, humusy. At the most earthy level apply Mr. de
Graaff's Potato Rule: "Any soil that grows good potatoes
grows good lilies."
   -- Lime not lilies, as most are calcifuges -- serious lime
haters.
   -- Feed grossly these gross feeders: organic mulch,
compost, potash, phosphates, cottonseed meal, well-rotted cow
manure a la mulch, low-slow nitrogen.
   -- Deadhead but do not deadstem. Never, ever cut down a
lily stalk post-bloom. (IF compulsive garden tidiness is in
your character, don't grow lilies.) Await the natural
withering away of the leafstalk like a good Marxist gardener.
From the photosynthetic work of this year's leaves comes next
year's bloom and bust.
   -- Do not confuse your lilies] Mr. de Graaff's best
advice: "Leave lilies alone." He noted: "The true character
of the lily is that of a perennial plant which must be kept
moist and growing." He declared, "a healthy lily never
sleeps," and warned that a lily disturbed "may be thrown into
confusion."

<LEADPARA>  LET'S be honest: Labels that tout All-America "whatever" -- roses, carrots and
so forth -- are marketing gimmicks created to catch the buyer's interest. But
they're also superior offerings. Gardeners who buy them can expect better than
average results in their own yards.;   Rose growers, for instance, put their
faith in All-America Rose Selections. AARS is a non-profit organization of
U.S. rose producers who test new varieties and determine which, if any, can be
recommended to the public as exceptional. Each year companies submit roses to
test gardens around the country for a two-year trial.  </LEADPARA>

OCTOBER GARDENING SPECIFICS . . .

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
October is the beginning of our longest growing season and the most important
time to plant for flower color now and through the spring. This time is known
as the "cool season."
</P>
<P>
Get ready to plant "cool season" annuals, "showy perennials" and spring
blooming bulbs. Watch for these annuals as they become available at your local
nursery: calendula; candytuft; chrysanthemum (the small bedding type);
dianthus; English daisy; Iceland poppies; larkspur; nemesia; ornamental
cabbage, kale; pansies; primrose, English; schizanthus; snapdragons stock, and
sweet pea. For shade planting, watch for primrose obconica and primrose
malicoides.
</P>
<P>
Many varieties of "showy perennials" will be available in 4-inch pots. Plant
these perennials (and biennials) for a jump start on permanent color in your
garden: Canterbury bells; coreopsis; cyclamen (for shade); delphinium; dusty
miller; foxglove; hollyhock; nicotiana; rehmannia; salvias and Shasta daisy.
</P>
<P>
For the best selection, buy bulbs now and store them in paper bags in a cool,
dry location until planting time. For added insurance when growing bulbs, hold
off on planting until November, when the soil and air temperature cools off.
</P>
<P>
Tulips and hyacinths need to be placed in a refrigerator after Oct. 15 and
chilled for six weeks. Plant these bulbs immediately after taking them out of
cold storage.

<P>
. . . AND GENERAL OCTOBER CARE TIPS
</P>
<P>
De-thatch or aerate your lawn to prevent disease and pests during the winter.
</P>
<P>
Prepare rhododendrons and azaleas for winter by mulching heavily around their
base with 2 to 3 inches of mulch.
</P>
<P>
When planting bulbs, be generous with the bone meal. Place some at the bottom
of the planting hole, add a little dirt and then the bulb so the bulb doesn't
touch the bone meal.
</P>
<P>
If you're thinking of planting ground cover, plant it soon. If you do it now,
the root system will become established before spring arrives and growth
accelerates.
</P>
<P>
Thin camellia buds now for bigger and better blooms later.
</P>
<P>
For beautiful red and orange color in the fall, plant a pomegranate tree or
shrub.
</P>
<P>
To give your yard a fresh, new look, uproot plants that have overgrown their
space.
</P>
<P>
Tend to your roses by removing dead wood, twiggy growth and leaves with spots
or mildew. But don't prune them now.
</P>
<P>
Before you plant perennials or annuals, prepare the planting bed well: Dig down
18 inches and work in organic matter.
</P>
<P>
For a "berry" good holiday season, plant berried shrubs for garden color and
holiday decorations.
</P>
<P>
Keep fallen leaves raked off the lawn and out of flower beds. Certain pests
love to set up house under them.
</P>
<P>
A good choice for cool-season color is the bird of paradise.
</P>
<P>
Stop feeding garden roses now because they are heading into their dormant
period.
</P>
<P>
For more annual color during winter, check out fairy primroses, stock and
snapdragons.

<TEXT>  Autumn color is showing up everywhere, but one of the best displays of fall
foliage and flowers is at the University of California, Berkeley, Botanical
Gardens. You can walk through the gardens at your own pace any day or take a
docent-led tour on weekends at 1:30 p.m. The gardens, with their wide paths,
are wheelchair accessible. Location: Centennial Drive behind the UC-Berkeley
football stadium. Information: (510) 642-3343.; BEST BUY; Mums and more;
Winter flowers, such as chrysanthemums, cyclamens and azaleas, are one way to
brighten surroundings both indoors and out. Look for these flowers, priced
from $5 each in four-inch pots.; TOP JOB; Slow growing; With more chill in the
air, plants are growing slower. But there is still enough midday warmth to get
some results. Sow or transplant vegetables such as fava beans, beets,
broccoli, cabbage and chard. Also put in transplants of calendulas, gazania,
primroses, stocks, pansies and violas. Sow wildflower seeds. Bait for snails,
as they never give up.; SPRAY; Dormant schedule; Plan your dormant fruit tree
spraying schedule to coincide approximately with cool-weather holidays --
Thanksgiving, New Year's Day and Valentine's Day. Specific cues are the fall
of the last leaf (Thanksgiving), the height of dormancy (New Year's Day) and
bud swell (Valentine's Day). The experts say dormant oils and peach-leaf curl
controls won't hurt predator insects released to control ash whiteflies. The
predators and whiteflies overwinter only on trees with leaves.; YOUR
CHECKLIST; (box) Plant the last of your spring-flowering bulbs including
tulips, daffodils and ranunculus.; (box) Plant azaleas, camellias, forsythias,
dogwoods and oriental magnolias before the weather gets any colder.; (box)
Fertilize lawns with slow-release nitrogen for gradual, consistent feeding all
winter long.; (box) Coat the underside of your lawn mower with used oil to
inhibit rust and help keep grass clippings from sticking to the mower.; (box)
Clean up the garden area. Stacks of pots, lumber and garden furniture can
become nesting places for earwigs, snails, slugs and other pests.; (box) Prune
dead or damaged tree limbs, or mark them with paint so you won't miss them
later when you do winter dormant pruning.  </TEXT>

FT  26 SEP 92 / How to Spend It: The pick of the (artificial) bunch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU thought artificial flowers were the sort of naffery that went with
flying ducks, garden gnomes and dear little knick-knacks all over the place,
then you should hurry along to Pulbrook &amp; Gould where there are silk flowers
to make you think again.
Pulbrook &amp; Gould is that most establishment, most revered of florists, and
when it decides to do something it does it properly - nothing but the best
silk and tender hand-painting for them. Roses, hydrangeas, daffodils,
tulips, polyanthus . . . almost everything the garden has, Pulbrook &amp; Gould
now offers in silk.
Some prefer silk flowers to look as real as possible, and P&amp;G has these in
splendidly realistic ready-made arrangements. Personally, I think they look
best when used as a witty conceit, when their artificiality is all part of
the fun. The tulips planted in strict little rows, like the ones in the
picture above, work, to my mind, better than the large mixed bunches
pretending to be real.
But each to his own taste - Pulbrook &amp; Gould will sell the flowers singly
(medium tulips Pounds 10.50, large Pounds 12.50) or make up arrangements in
customers' containers or to suit customers' own colour schemes.
Pulbrook &amp; Gould is at Liscartan Houses, 127 Sloane Street, London SW1X 9AS.

   Endangered species pop up in the strangest
places. Like flowerbeds.
   Plant-protection activists say some species of bulbs bought to
decorate American and European gardens are being collected by the
millions in the wild, threatening to wipe out those flowers in
their home turf.
   ``The world would lose an irreplaceable treasure,'' said
Marjorie Arundel of Warrenton, Va., an adviser to the Garden Club
of America's horticulture committee. ``They're the ancestors of all
of our spring bulbs today.''
   Mrs. Arundel and other activists are urging American gardeners
to buy only commercially propagated plants, which experts say make
up at least 99 percent of the flower trade anyway.
   ``Wild-collected flowers are a small percentage of the trade,
but a large percentage of certain kinds of plants,'' said Faith
Campbell, director of the plant conservation program for the
Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.
   Working with the World Wildlife Fund and the Garden Club of
America, the NRDC has produced leaflets calling on gardeners to
avoid most kinds of cyclamen, sternbergia and galanthus, or
snowdrops, which they say are collected in the wild in Turkey.
   Those three species are listed as endangered in the Convention
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and
Flora, or CITES. But this treaty _ effective in fighting trade in
some endangered animal skins, horns and tusks _ has had little
effect on the flower trade, Ms. Campbell said.
   Snowdrops are greatly depleted in Turkey's Mediterranean
regions, forcing traders to seek out sources in more remote regions.
   The popular ``Angel's Tears'' narcissus are being collected in
the wild, but experts are not sure if the source is Portugal or
somewhere else.
   Other wildflowers, such as trillium, are being collected from
the wild in the United States and Canada. Japan, China, India and
the Soviet Union appear to be the sources for still other rare
flowers.
   Some species of these plants may be produced by growers in the
United States or Europe, but buyers are being counseled to check
the origins as carefully as they can.
   This may become easier, as a result of the decision last May by
the Dutch Commodity Board for Ornamental Horticultural Products to
require exporters to use a ``Bulbs from Wild Sources'' label to
identify wild-collected plants.
   Under the negotiated agreement, Dutch exporters will also label
their cultivated bulbs, beginning in 1992 for minor species and in
1995 for such major bulb varieties as tulips and hyacinths.
   Because the Netherlands has long dominated the world flower
trade, the action by the Dutch regulatory body should have a major
impact, Ms. Campbell said. It is not binding, though, on dealers in
the United States or other countries.
   Also, the agreement was reached too late for most of this fall's
catalogs. So even if American gardeners order from Dutch dealers
covered by the rules, they might not know they were buying
wild-collected flowers until the bulbs arrive in the mail, labeled
``wild sources.''
   ``We can just hope they won't order those again,'' Ms. Campbell
said. ``It is a messy phasing-in.''
   The long-range solution, she said, could be in helping people in
Turkey and elsewhere who make money from collecting wild flowers to
start propagating the rare flowers in or near the native habitat,
she said.
   Gardeners shouldn't think they're aiding nature by keeping alive
a species that might be disappearing in its native habitat.
   ``We don't consider that a contribution to conservation in any
way,'' Ms. Campbell said. ``It's not playing its role in the
ecosystem in which it evolved.''

FT  09 MAY 92 / Gardening: Westward hoe] In search of new plants and ideas -
Robin Lane Fox loses himself exploring the gardens of the Worcester triangle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GARDENERS are enjoying their best spring for years; everything looks green
and happy; lilacs are already in flower and this years' edition of The Plant
Finder has just come out to join them. To celebrate it, I have taken a break
from preventive poisoning: heading west looking for ideas on what we could
all be growing. Westwards towards Worcestershire, there are ideas by the
dozen, some of which are easier to accommodate than others. Yellow Alyssum
is too harsh for my taste, but there might be possibilities in imitating red
Darwin tulips in grass, while the blossom on the apple trees should cause us
all to regret those which had to be grubbed out soon after we entered the
EC.
Near Malvern, there is the best selection of Michaelmas daisies in any
nursery in the country; at Kingswynford near Kidderminster, there are the
best Lewisias; near Tewkesbury (WHoo in The Plant Finder) there is a list of
admirably grown Alpines within vibration-range of the town's dual
carriageway; they are so fairly priced that most were bought months ago. All
in all, patient plant finders could be lost for days in the
Gloucester-Worcestershire triangle. My taste has learned most from one of my
favourite hunting-grounds, the walled garden and nursery at Stone House
Cottage, Stone, near Kidderminster.
This small nursery is no longer a stranger to connoisseurs. Its mastermind
is Louisa Arbuthnot, and when I wrote about her enterprise six years ago,
the article managed to sing her praises as the skilled keeper of several
thousand pets. The 'pets' should have been 'pots,' but this unsolicited
credit has not stopped the nursery from widening its clientele or the
proprietors from adding a fifth baby to their family. They continue to
propagate, criticise and supply a huge range of plants with a highly
personal labelling system.
The enterprise depends on an exceptionally sharp-eyed wife, a reassuringly
informed husband and no more than one willing assistant. This time I have
returned with young plants of a rare Oriental buddleia, collected by a keen
woman amateur gardener from the Great Wall of China when tourism was still
politically defensible.
A grey-leaved and pink-flowered variety, it has proved quite hardy and ought
to be an apt choice for my own local wall against barbarism: the ancient
city wall of Oxford, which stands in my college gardens.
The nursery supplies visitors only, but I am not trying to tantalise you by
writing merely about a source off the beaten track. Stone House Cottage has
a second string to its bow. The owners planted many of their nursery's plant
in their adjacent walled garden and, as they have lived there for some 20
years, the garden has become a living lesson.
It alerts you to the potential of plants which are otherwise names in a
list, by showing them off at maturity. The setting is not so grand that it
is inimitable.
This weekend, beds at the foot of the walls have white-flowered Bleeding
Heart, the last of the tulips and a rare Blue Eyed Mary which has little
blue flowers starred with white. Pink and yellow Epimediums keep company
with some exceptional rarities, none finer than a plant of Corydalis
Flexuosa. This lovely variety was introduced after an Oriental field-trip
and was already the talks of experts in the lunch-tent at last year's
Chelsea flower show. I now see why. This one plant was smothered in a flock
of crested flowers in an electric shade of blue which outclasses anything
except spring gentians.
Such rarities are beyond most of us, but the shrubs and wall-plants are
another matter. Many of you know or grow the pale yellow flowers of Rose
Canary Bird which is so good in a pot or tub. On Stone House Cottage's wall,
I was attracted once by a deeper and richer variety. It turned out to be
Rose Helen Knight which was bred in the late 1960s and is not related to
Canary Bird at all.
Its parents are a wild yellow rose from Afghanistan, and a plain Scots
Burnet variety. Its breeder, Frank Knight, thought highly of it, but
gardeners have been slower to follow his judgment. If you see a mature
plant, you realise at once that it is a winner. It is located against the
clashing red leaves of a young Pieris in its Worcestershire setting.
Starting from scratch, it would be good in a pot or against a wallat a
height of 5 ft, even in semi-shaded conditions.
Like Rose Canary Bird, the usual forms of Flowering Currant or Ribes are
very well known. One form, however, is more like a flowering gooseberry, the
prickly ribes speciosum. Its crimson-red flowers hang downwards from the
branches and are hardier when trained against a sunny wall. At a flower
show, young plants look ever so slightly boring. At maturity, it is quite
different: after eight years or so, it is looking its best in its
Worcestershire setting.
So has a white-flowered white lilac with a touch of ink-blue to its single
petals. In Oxford's Botanic Garden, Syringa persica alba is trained
vertically up a wall where it flowers very freely. In the walled nursery
garden, this lilac bulges forward at a lower height, not far from tall
pink-flowered Syringa microphylla, one of the great repeat-flowerers in the
family. Together they remind you that large-flowered hybrid lilacs do not
have things all their own way in May.
Established gardens also reassure those of us who are not so far down a new
garden's path. They show you small daphne retusa after 10 years or a
daphniphyllum looking its best; they prove to you that Sycopsis is not just
a suitable name for another dark green shrub with tediously small flowers.
They also show you that one day, too, your own choices will make the grade.
A mainstay of my own newish plantings is the scented white Viburnum
carlcephalum. Since planting it, I have read criticisms of it because it is
less refined than the less vigorous varieties such as Carlesii. Its choice
cost me hours of uncertainty, but I wanted a good grower which could be
pruned gradually into an upright bush like a small standard tree above low
carpets of small hardy plants.
Will the carlcephalum agree to be clipped and grow upwards not outwards?
Books never give the answer, and my young bushes are already bulging
sideways with huge crops of the big scented flowers.
At Stone House Cottage, a much older bush has reached just the height and
shape I have envisaged. Returning home, I have seen a dozen new names at
their mature best, but I have also seen evidence that a bet on the future is
really going to work.

FT  22 MAY 93 / Gardening (A Taste of Chelsea): The agony aunts of gardening
lore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS EVERY regular visitor to the Chelsea Flower Show knows, it is the people
who matter quite as much as the plants they exhibit.
There stand the men and women who know the answers - whether daffodil-leaves
should be tied in a knot, why your auriculas never germinated, why last
summer's tomatoes had black blotches. At other flower-shows, exhibitors are
too busy selling stuff to answer questions. At Chelsea, you fix the poor
devils with a gimlet eye and they have no place to hide.
Exhibitors have ways of evading interrogation. They spend a lot of time
fussing around the stand, squirting the roses and replenishing catalogues.
Language, too, can be a problem. Last year, my most urgent question was
about tulip fire. Does it persist in the soil? But the tulip-exhibitors were
dour Dutchmen and as soon as I waylaid them, each became resolutely
monoglot.
This year, I would find an answer. A section of the Great Marquee is
virtually a clinic for gardeners' problems. The Educational and Science
section is not glamorous; many exhibits are merely display panels and a few
plants. Nonetheless, knowing gardeners queue up for advice, often with bags
and matchboxes of unsavoury items.
For sick lawns, there is the Institute of Groundsmanship (0903-312511);
environmentally friendly ways with greenfly, the Henry Doubleday Research
Association (0203-303517); tree-problems, the Arboricultural Association;
(0794-68717). A sign of the times, the Metropolitan Police will be advising
on chaining down your statues and yuccas.
Among the agony aunts will be Dr Roland Fox of the School of Plant Sciences
at Reading University, known worldwide for its horticultural expertise. This
year's melancholy display, 'Diseases in the Garden', is also advertising
Reading's new BSc degree in crop protection as well as short courses on the
diagnosis of plant disease (0734-318708).
The exhibit itself is not about curing diseases but the symptoms which
reveal that 'the invisible worm' is in the bed. Ghastly photographs
illustrate scabs, lesions, cankers, blights, and moulds, all symptoms of
what the experts call necrosis and we call a dead plant. A close up of
carrot with black bodies, Sclerotimia sclerotorum, is as nasty as it sounds.
The vocabulary of the plant pathologist is strangely poetic. Fungi and
bacteria reveal themselves by streaks, stripes, fire, scald, scorch,
die-back, blotches, mummification, exuding, and bleeding. You want to know
what happens when your pears get scab? 'Conidia of the fungus form under the
cuticles then burst through to sporulate.' If the leaves of a plant grow
downwards, it has epinasty due to ethylene caused by wilts or canker.
Scabby potatoes and crooked cactuses will make this Chelsea's first exhibit
of (knowingly) diseased plants. However, some of these plants are valued for
their viruses. If it were not for arabis mosaic virus which dwarfs its
hosts, all kitchen-garden rhubarb would loom 6 ft tall.
The netted gold leaves on the honeysuckle, Lonicera japonica var
aureoreticulata, are due to a virus. It is not readily transmissible, which
is why the variegated form is tricky to propagate.
Virus has caused the variegations on clover, geraniums, abutilon, and a fine
golden-veined canna peculiar to Reading's collection. A silver variegated
pot of that awful pest, Mind Your Own Business, may have virus but could be
genetic.
If this sounds a trifle academic, the Reading team will be there to answer
questions. Why does my almond have Peach Leaf Curl despite being sprayed?
Answer, because England is cold, and Bordeaux Mixture is not half as
effective as lime sulphur which is listed in my old gardening books, but can
be the devil to find.
Dr Fox is used to gardeners weeping as they describe sudden death of trees
and shrubs. Often, honey fungus is often the cause. Disease, it is well
known, is a matter of social class and as Fox puts it, 'honey fungus is the
major disease of RHS members.' Look for white rot, like very old
matchsticks, and for black 'bootlaces'.
However, the good news is that the Reading team have found a 'very
effective' preventative for honey fungus which it is developing for the
market with Zeneca. Fox will not be drawn on the date of release, but it
should be with us in the next few years.

<LEADPARA>  Working with water; A class on irrigation design and installation will be held
Saturday, 9 to 11 a.m., at Prusch Farm Park, 647 S. King Road, San Jose. Those
who take a scale drawing of their back yard will go home with a preliminary
irrigation design. Nancy Garrison, University of California Extension farm
adviser, will give the program. Cost: $5. Reservations are required; call

<MEMO>  THE WEEKEND GARDENER  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  BEST BUY; Plant everything; Just about everything you can find at the nursery
now is a good bet for fall planting. Look for annual flowers and vegetables in
six-packs, priced from $1.49; mums in four-inch pots, from $1.25; daffodil
bulbs, 10 cents each; and camellias in five-gallon containers, from $17.; TOP
JOBS; Don't let up; This is the best time of the year to plant a new lawn or
reseed a worn one. Feed the lawn and apply a pre-emergent weed control. Give
trees, shrubs and ground covers a light feeding with a low-nitrogen
fertilizer. Clean up the yard, and put the garden debris in a compost pile.
Plant spring-flowering bulbs including daffodils, tulips, hyacinths and
crocus.; VEGETABLES; Frost forward; Vegetables that tolerate light frosts will
provide fresh produce through winter. These include beets, Chinese and
savoy-leafed cabbages, collards, kale, butterhead and romaine lettuces,
flat-leafed parsley, radishes, turnips, spinach and Swiss chard. Sow or
transplant two or three times the amount you would use for spring harvest, as
these overwintering crops will grow very slowly with sketchy harvests.;
TECHNIQUE; Divide and conquer; To divide perennials, let the plants harden off
by reducing the watering as the weather cools. Water the site the day before
digging. Dig around the plants, loosen the roots and gently pull the plants
apart. Or, use a shovel or a sharp knife to cut apart the roots. Replant each
root division immediately.; YOUR CHECKLIST; (box) Trim hedges and shrubs that
block driveways, walkways or the views to the street.; (box) Keep watering
perennials, shrubs and roses; keep seed beds moist.; (box) Buy bulbs, and
don't forget extras for potting for indoor winter bloom.;   (box) Pull crops
that have gone to seed.; (box) Plant a cover crop of rye, clover or fava beans
to add nutrients and tilth to the soil.; (box) Pot herbs for indoor use.  </TEXT>

FT  21 MAY 94 / Gardening (The Chelsea Flower Show): Marquee of marvels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Old-timers know it, but if this is your first visit to Chelsea and
especially if you are a non-gardener, the following are the marvels of the
Great Marquee. Miss these bravura displays and I am tempted to say you have
missed the heart of the world's greatest flower show.
Every year, the celebrated Woodford Brothers of Stratford-upon-Avon arrange
a glorious symphony of lupins. Warmenhoven's bowls of enormous tulips always
hold me spellbound, as do Brenda Hyatt's extraordinary auriculas. Equally
unmissable are Blackmore &amp; Langdon's begonias and delphiniums and S &amp; N
Brackley's sweet peas.
For floral perfection, look to the fuchsia displays (Potash Nursery and
Roualeyn Nursery). Indoor gardeners are always well served at Chelsea - year
after year, Dibleys' stand has inspired people with a passion for
streptocarpus, one of the most charming and easiest of flowering
house-plants.
Pleiones always look tempting on Butterfields Nursery's stand. Tropical Rain
Forest's display of bromeliads or 'air plants' can be relied upon to
fascinate.
Serious plant hunters must look for two specialist shrub and tree nurseries.
Mallet Court Nursery's owner is something of a plant-collector. He displays
rarities such as Tapiscia sinensis (an anagram of pistacia), raised from
seed sent from China, Pterocarya insignis, and exotic oaks grown from seed
collected in the mountains of Mexico. Acer enthusiasts should inspect
Millicient, a jazzy variety of Acer morrisonense Hayata.
Bluebell Nurseries of Swadlincote in Derbyshire is another connoisseurs'
nursery, and it boasts Sinocalycanthus chinensis, a shrub with white flowers
in June. It also exhibits Caragana jubata, described as a strange, shaggy
Mongolian affair, and Senecio gnapholodes, a prostrate willow-like plant
from Crete.
Several delphiniums make their debut, among them Albert Sheppard from
perennial specialists Rougham Hall, and salmon-pink Princess Caroline from
Burncoose. A Dutch creation, it achieves the long looked-for goal of a
tall-growing red delphinium which can be grown out of doors.
Variegation is an easy way to stand out in a crowd. This year Bressingham
Gardens is launching Polemonium Brise d'Anjou, discovered in France. I also
look forward to their new verbena Homestead Purple.
Even more eagerly anticipated are the year's new clematis exhibited by
Valley Clematis, which always makes a lovely show. Lady in Red sounds
intriguing if alarming, with its orangey-red flowers. There are five new
varieties from the US and Guernsey. Arctic Queen sounds like a winner if it
is true that here is a double white which really is double and floriferous
for the whole season.
Gardeners can rely on unearthing something to their advantage in the
educational section. If there is something nasty in the lawn, the Institute
of Groundsmanship will analyse specimens. This year the University of
Reading addresses itself to the compelling problem of pest control. And at
the Plantlife stand you can do your bit for the environment by joining the
Great Hedge Scheme.
This year's show gardens more than ever are linked to charities. Watch out
for the gardens for the blind, for allergy sufferers, for people with
learning disabilities, families with sick children, and even a holistic
garden for the terminally ill.

<LEADPARA>  THIS IS the fall that thinks it must be spring.;   In September, the magnolias
bloomed in the New York Botanical Garden. A few weeks later, the lilacs
blossomed on Martha's Vineyard. In Washington, the rhododendrons are out.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  WEIRD WEATHER TURNS FALL TO SPRING  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But hey, if farmers can water-ski on cornfields, as they did in Iowa in
May, why can't a dogwood bloom in October?;   "We had rhododendrons and
dogwoods and pears blooming at the National Arboretum," said Marc Cathey, a
horticulturist for the Agriculture Department in Beltsville, Md.;   Floods and
droughts. Heat waves and cold spells. This year has seen everything. Is it
global warming, or the age-old vagaries of weather?;   "I think that some of
the extremes we've seen this year are related to the greenhouse effect," said
Dr. James Hansen, a climatologist at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York.;   "But
weather is always highly variable. It's very difficult, if not impossible, to
blame any particular event on a long-term trend like global warming.";
Strange as it seems, this fall's "spring" is a perfectly natural response to a
confluence of weather events, including the past mild winter and early spring,
a blast of extreme summer heat followed by rain, and Hurricane Bob in August.;
  Last winter was extremely mild, setting the stage for unusual blooming this
year in the Northeast.;   The mild winter led into a very warm March and
April, which sent plants into an avalanche of bloom.;   "We had tulips and
daffodils flowering at the same time, which is not normal," said Michael
Ruggiero, special gardens curator at the New York Botanical Garden in the
Bronx.;   The good news was that the hot, dry conditions of May resulted in
near-perfect pollination. The bees and butterflies had a field day, and it was
a bumper crop for peaches, raspberries and beach plums.;   Flowers bloomed
like gangbusters, but out of whack.;   The heat and drought also sent some
plants into early dormancy. Then a mild rainy spell in August and September
caused them to break bud, or flower, as if it were spring. Thus the jolly pear
trees and dogwoods of Washington.;   New Yorkers went dormant on July 21, when
the mercury hit 102 and ozone lay over the city like a suffocating pillow.
They suffered through 38 days of temperatures of 90 or better. That broke the
1944 record of 37 days.;   New York was not the only hot place. The Goddard
Institute's Hansen said 1990 "was the warmest year average of the world,"
adding, "The cherry blossoms in Washington and Tokyo both broke the records by
10 days."  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  AS Macy's Union Square was about to open Monday morning, Dick Korpi had
something on his mind: moss.;    Korpi was standing on Stockton Street,
alternately pointing and mouthing directions to one of his assistants who at
that moment was inside one of the store's huge display windows.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  MACY'S 45TH FLOWER SHOW TAKES NEW PATH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     A bit of moss in a fantasy English-style garden was quickly returned to its
proper place.;    Nothing is left to chance at Macy's 45th Annual Flower Show,
which opened last weekend and runs through April 6. As floral consultant to
the show, Korpi knows that better than most.;    About 100 workers spent three
nights setting up stunning window displays, huge flower-covered arches over
the store's main aisle, a recreated Muir Woods scene, a tropical area
featuring 15-foot-tall bamboo palms and scores of other, smaller-scale special
flower effects.;    Everything was installed by 6:30 a.m. the day the show
opened, but that didn't mean nap time. Every night, after the store closes,
two or three workers water the live species, remove dead blossoms and replace
cut flowers as needed. The most challenging task will be when the arches,
which don't hold moisture well because they're so high above the floor, are
replanted this weekend.;    "It's a constant thing," said Brian Preussker,
whose long-winded title of group vice president of visual merchandising and
store design really means that he's in charge of how the flower show looks.;
 This show's stunner is the English garden scene, complete with a column-lined
stone path, that weaves its way through several windows. In the past, each
window had a separate theme.;    "We wanted to create an environment for a
garden you could walk though," Preussker said. The show's designers didn't
want something that looked formal or tailored. What they now call the
"overgrown colonnade look" began when Preussker saw a photo of a natural
English garden in an airline magazine.;    The Macy's version is awash in
color. For example, in one little corner of the window on Stockton and
O'Farrell, there's orange Asian lilies, yellow and cream Gerbera daisies, deep
purple cineria, echeria (a succulent with orange flowers) and a brilliant
red-and-yellow Rembrandt tulip.;    Some other don't misses include:;    (box)
The 55-year-old white "snowbird" azaleas that have part of the show since its
debut in 1946. Raised by the Gomes family at their Oakland nursery, these
might be some of the best-cared-for flowers in the world. They work two weeks
a year at Macy's and spend the remaining 50 weeks getting cleaned, pruned,
watered, fertilized and sprayed.;    (box) Rare South American amaryllis --
including several extinct species -- on public display for the first time.
They resulted from the work of Fred Meyer, an Escondido plant breeder who grew
the wild species from seeds he collected in Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and
Brazil. Commercial production of these plants is still at least four or five
years away.;    Shoppers who want the total package should stop and smell the
flowers and then take an elevator to the fifth floor. There, 13 elegant,
whimsical table settings, complete with floral china, provoke "I wish I could
afford these" sentiments.;    Highlights include a garden gazebo setting that
uses an array of pastel colors and features chairs with bustles; an artists'
table with palettes as placemats, a painter's box as centerpiece and "Cezanne"
china by Mikasa; and an American table that uses wooden gameboards as
placemats, a collection of weathervanes as a centerpiece, nostalgic
knickknacks and "Petite Fleur" china by Villeroy &amp; Boch.;    Back downstairs,
docents from the San Francisco Landscape Garden Show lead tours each
afternoon. They point out highlights and add some behind-the-scenes tidbits.
On Monday, the store's first floor was crowded as the floral extravaganza was
having its intended effect -- turning flower lovers into potential customers.
A Macy's official says both foot traffic and sales increase during the show
though no specific figures were available.;    Someone else who benefits from
the show is Al Dubayah, who sells flowers at an outdoor stand at the corner of
Stockton and Geary. Some of the people who leave Macy's are inspired enough to
buy an $8 bunch of tulips from Dubayah at they head toward Union Square.;
Dubayah, though, isn't a big fan of the show. "I think they should have stuck
with themes," he says, mentioning "The Hobbit" as one of his favorites from
the past. "It's just a bunch of flowers thrown on the windows.";  IF YOU'RE
INTERESTED; Floral displays can be seen in both Macy's buildings near Union
Square in San Francisco during regular store hours. Windows remain lit until
about 11 p.m. Information: (415) 393-3358.;  MORE THAN FLOWERS; BESIDES the
windows and other in-store floral displays, there are special events during
Macy's 45th Annual Flower Show in San Francisco. Some include:; (box) Docent

<P>
Much has been made of how easy it is to get around the Netherlands by train.
It's true.
</P>
<P>
But it's just as easy, and in many ways more rewarding, to see the country by
car.
</P>
<P>
Dutch roads are excellent and very well marked. Distances between sights are
short, so that you can cover several areas in even a one-week visit. Most
important, you have the option of stopping whenever you wish.
</P>
<P>
Car travel in the Netherlands is especially rewarding during the spring tulip
season. A suggestion: Follow the tulip trail on a weekday. Weekend traffic is
slow going because every Amsterdamer is making the same jaunt.
</P>
<P>
The biggest surprise to a foreign motorist in the Netherlands is how short the
distances are made by expressways linking major cities.
</P>
<P>
The two of us in our rental car took turns as navigator and pilot. We left the
rental office at 9:15 a.m. with a detailed road map, planning a brief detour to
Haarlem 15 miles west of Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
You might also arm yourself with "Tourist Menu Restaurants," a free Netherlands
Board of Tourism booklet that lists restaurants throughout the country that
offer specially priced tourist menus, with three-course dinners for about $9.95
per person.
</P>
<P>
It took only 20 minutes from central Amsterdam over a super-fast highway. Then
we discovered that the Franz Hals Museum didn't open until 11 a.m., giving us
more than an hour to wander through Haarlem, browse for antiques along Kleine
Houtstraat and wander through the Great Market and the 14th-Century cathedral,
the Church of St. Bavo.
</P>
<P>
We even discovered a new museum, the Corrie Ten Boom House, used by a Dutch
Christian family as a hiding place for Jews and Nazi refugees during World War
II.

The Franz Hals Museum in a 17th-Century almshouse was well worth the wait. In
addition to many paintings by Hals it has fine works by other 17th-Century
Dutch masters. A quick lunch in the museum's coffee shop and we were on the
road again.
</P>
<P>
It was a brief drive on N208 to the turn-off to Lisse and the Keukenhof flower
garden. Along the side roads we stopped to photograph brilliant red, yellow and
purple tulip fields. Keukenhof was a feast of color, with beautifully
landscaped flower beds full of bulbs we had never seen. A devout gardener could
spend an entire day wandering the 70-acre parkland, gardens and greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
Later we cruised through Leiden for a once-over-lightly precis of the old
university town's cobbled streets, canals and red tile-roofed buildings before
returning to the E19 and continuing south.
</P>
<P>
We spent our first night at the Delta Hotel on a waterway in Vlaardingen, a
suburb west of Rotterdam. The eye level close view of ships cruising up the
waterway, visible from the dining room, lounge and bedrooms, made up for the
hotel's rather pedestrian food.
</P>
<P>
Our second day began with Delft (just off a major artery, E19), a town
interlaced with canals and so post-card pretty that it seems almost unreal.
Delft has ancient churches, but its principal charm is its Dutch village
character.
</P>
<P>
You can spend hours just walking over canal bridges and sitting at a sidewalk
cafe on Markt Square with its 14th-Century Nieuwe Kerk (New Church), or
shopping for the famous Delft china. Delft has two four-star hotels, the De Ark
and Museumhotel, and several fine restaurants.
</P>
<P>
From Delft we headed east on E19, avoiding Rotterdam's industrial center, to
the Lek River, a narrow scenic waterway dotted with 19 windmills, one of which
is open as the Kinderdijk Windmill Museum. By late afternoon we reached Gouda,
a short hop off a main superhighway, E25.
</P>
<P>
With its Market Square, Gothic town hall, stone churches, canals and cheese
shops, Gouda is another quintessential Dutch town. Its market days -- Thursday
and Saturday -- are especially colorful.
</P>
<P>
North of Utrecht we stayed at at the Hotel Residence Vinkeveen, again with
views of canals. We found several very good restaurants; our dinner at the
French Buitenlust was one of the best during our trip.
</P>
<P>
The final day we backtracked to Utrecht to visit the Catharijne Convent Museum,
with its European medieval art in a 17th-Century convent.
</P>
<P>
We spent our last night at the Apollo Hotel near the Amsterdam outskirts, in
order to drive with ease to Schiphol Airport for our departure the following
day.
</P>
<P>
It was a tulip tour with lasting memories.
</P>

GARDENING: DABBLING IN DAFFODILS AT DESCANSO
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH CHRISTIAN, Christian is a Times copy editor.
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who has traveled to the Pacific Northwest in spring has seen one of the
region's most glorious sights -- huge yellow daffodils, thousands of them,
glowing in the fog as if lighted from within.
</P>
<P>
Many Southern Californians have come home from such trips eager to grow those
splendid flowers in their gardens. Come fall, they rush out, buy two dozen of
the King Alfred bulbs they saw blooming in such profusion in Washington and
Oregon, plant them and wait for success. And they're almost invariably
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
Not only are the blossoms not as spectacular here, the King Alfred usually
performs well only during the first year it's planted.
</P>
<P>
"If you're happy with the King Alfred's blossoms that first year, be satisfied
and throw out the bulbs," says Polly Anderson, a lifelong gardener and a
founding member of the Southern California Daffodil Society. "However, part of
(the society's) ambition is to find varieties that do well in Southern
California -- and that means ones that will naturalize."
</P>
<P>
This weekend at Descanso Gardens, you'll have the opportunity to see daffodils
that do do well in Southern California; so well, in fact, that they will often
naturalize -- in other words, make themselves right at home in your garden and
come back year after year without much effort on your part.
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who is an expert on creating new strains through cross-pollination,
says Peeping Tom and February Gold are daffodils that do particularly well in
this area. Both are yellow and both have blooms on the small side.
</P>
<P>
"The white ones, in general, don't do as well here as the yellow ones, but the
blends of yellow and white do fine," she says.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Sun Lovers
</P>
<P>
She suggests planting the bulbs in a sunny location in September or October.
Set them six to eight inches deep and add a good, low-nitrogen granulated
fertilizer to the planting hole. Then water the bed moderately but regularly.
You won't see their sunny faces until early spring.
</P>
<P>
"When the green spikes peek out of the ground, begin watering heavily,"
Anderson says. "It's really hard to over-water when daffodils are in their
fast-growing and blooming stages." Give them another good feeding when they
begin to grow.
</P>
<P>
Then, enjoy. With luck and a little cold weather, you'll have blooms for weeks.
</P>
<P>
After the blossoms are gone, let the greens rest until they bend over and lose
all traces of green. When they're completely brown, cut them off at ground
level and resume a light watering schedule.
</P>
<P>
Daffodils like the company of other plants in the garden and don't mind poking
up through annuals. "A lot of old-timers plant the daffodils right in their
lawns, where they'll naturalize. Then they just leave them there," Anderson
says. "We even know one fine grower who lets the weeds grow around his
daffodils as a natural mulch, which he doesn't pull until the blossoms are
gone."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wide Selection of Bulbs
</P>
<P>
Local nurseries typically have a good selection of daffodil bulbs on hand
during planting season -- but, again, don't be hoodwinked by the spectacular
photos on the King Alfred boxes. You might also want to write for a catalogue
from Grant Mitsch Novelty Daffodils, P.O. Box 218, Hubbard, Ore. 97032 --
you'll see varieties that never are available through retail outlets here, and
the catalogue does note which strains are well-suited for Southern California.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
All in the Family
</P>
<P>
The daffodil, like the jonquil, is a member of the narcissus group and all are
part of the amaryllis family; many members of the family thrive in Southern
California. Anderson is particularly fond of the paper-white narcissus, which
smell divine and naturalize beautifully. Because of our cool February, many
narcissus are still in bloom, and some will be on display during the
competition at Descanso Gardens.
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Daffodil Society Competition, today from 1:30 to 4 p.m.
and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Descanso Gardens in La Canada Flintridge,
will feature 200-300 different kinds of daffodils, from old favorites such as
Tete-a-Tete, a miniature yellow trumpet, to strains so new that you won't find
them in any catalogue. Although there is no additional fee for viewing the
competition, general admission to the gardens is $3; seniors 62 and older and
students with ID $1.50; children 5-12, 75 cents; 4 and younger are free.
</P>
<P>
A number of classes on growing the daffodils, including sessions on
cross-pollination, will be featured throughout the two-day competition.

<HEADLINE>  THE WEEKEND GARDENER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>  Filoli Center in Woodside is starting the new season with tours of the
historic 43-room mansion and gardens. Although there has been some freeze
damage, the word from Filoli is that the early-spring spectacles -- magnolias,
250 different varieties of camellias and the fragrant daphne -- are at their
best. Tulip beds and daffodils will start their show near the end of February
along with quince, forsythia and rhododendrons. Docent-led tours are scheduled
Monday through Saturday at 10 a.m.. Cost is $4 adults; no children under 12
including babies in strollers. Advance reservations are required: (415)
364-2880.; BEST BUY; Barely bare; Bare-root trees are beginning to break their
dormancy, so nurseries are scrambling to clear them out before growth starts.
Look for fruit trees priced from $10, and No. 1-grade rose bushes from $6.;
HOUSEPLANTS; From the heart; Cyclamen with its heart-shaped leaves and flowers
is a plant well-suited to Valentine's Day. So is the gloxinia. The bell-shaped
flowers come in shades of red, white, red with a white edge, pink, rose and
purple, and in single- and double-flowered form. A potted azalea is another
good bet. Proper watering is essential. Don't let the soil become too dry.;
CHECKLIST; (box) Feed deciduous fruit trees about three weeks before their
expected bloom time.; (box) Keep pruning tools sharp and clean. Wipe the blade
with rubbing alcohol after every three or four cuts to avoid transferring
disease from one plant to another.; (box) Finish pruning roses. The sap starts
to rise about the middle of February and leaves will start coming out. Clean
up soil underneath the bushes.; (box) Check peach and nectarine trees for bud
swell and apply peach-leaf curl controls at the right time. Before bud swell
is too early, but after bud break is too late. By next week, most trees will
be at bud break stage.; THE LAST WORD; Water smart; With severe water
rationing hanging over our heads, take time for a hard look at your garden to
weed out the wimps. Remove sick or poorly performing plants because they waste
water. Get rid of freeze-damaged plants that will need lots of care and much
water before recovering, and eliminate plants that are just taking up space.
Pull, hoe or spray weeds; they steal water from other plants.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  A VEGETABLE gardener gets to enjoy unusual flowers, a bonus for the soul in a
pastime otherwise centered on the earthier pleasure of good eating.;
Gardeners or not, we all know what roses and tulips look like. You don't need
soil-rimmed fingernails and a weatherbeaten complexion to tell a pansy from a
daisy. But an eggplant flower, uncelebrated in song and story, saves its
lovely bloom for those who grow it.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  FLOWERS OF A VEGETABLE GARDEN PROVIDE BEAUTY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The Practical Gardener  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     With lavender petals and a golden center, the eggplant flower reigns as the
belle of my vegetable patch. In midsummer I eagerly await the appearance of
these daisy-sized blooms from which the equally beautiful purple or white
eggplant itself will soon emerge.;   In the 1980s, a school of gardening
developed called "edible landscaping," a fascinating activity that could use a
more poetic name. Basically, its devotees plant handsome vegetables like
red-stemmed rhubarb chard among regular ornamentals to provide contrast and
excitement as well as food.;   A pioneer of the movement, Rosalind Creasy of
Los Altos, put many suggestions and techniques together in "The Complete Book
of Edible Landscaping" (Sierra Club Books, 1982). It's startling to see how
many vegetables can double as decorative plants in flower beds and containers
and on trellises, fences and walls.;   Beans, red cabbage, carrots, eggplants,
kale, lettuce, mustard greens, okra, snow peas, peppers, squash, sweet
potatoes, tomatoes -- all have ornamental uses in their leaves, vines, flowers
or fruit.;   Next to the eggplant, I'd call the zucchini bloom the most
beautiful and certainly most striking. Bright yellow against contrasting dark
green leaves, this squash flower resembles a lily and may reach a breadth of
four inches. The flower itself is edible, too, an epicure's treat.;   Chives
burst into small lavender flowers at the end of their spring eating season. I
have a particularly shapely cluster along the garden path that has never
failed to produce an attractive bouquet.;   In a quest for beauty among the
vegetables, new challenges beckon. We have some old stone walls on which to
feature the brilliant red, white or purple flowers of runner beans. Okra, I'm
told, boasts a stunning, hibiscus-like creamy or yellow flower. I may try
that, but the trouble is: How much chicken gumbo can I eat?  </TEXT>
