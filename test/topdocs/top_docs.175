   If you think progressive taxes are a good idea, you won't be entirely pleased with what's happened to state income taxes in the year since federal tax reform. 
If you think tax progressivity is a bad idea, you've got a friend in Pennsylvania. 

   With a "progressive" tax system, the higher a person's income, the larger the income share subject to tax. 
It's the opposite of a "flat" tax where everyone pays the same rate, no matter how much they earn. 

   A study by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees concludes that of the 40 states and the District of Columbia with broad-based income taxes, 21 made their taxes more "regressive" in the past year. 
That is, in some instances lower-income taxpayers are paying more -- relative to wealthier taxpayers-- in state income tax in 1987 than they did a year earlier. 

   The union -- a champion of increased progressivity in the tax system -- finds its conclusions surprising, since most states tie their income-tax formulas to a greater or lesser degree to the federal tax code. 
And by eliminating loopholes and removing millions of low-income Americans from the tax rolls entirely, the union says the federal income tax has become more progressive. 

   When states applied the new federal code to their own tax code, however, the results proved uneven. 

   "Federal tax reform worked because standard deductions, exemptions and rates were very carefully balanced with base-broadening at various income levels," says Michael Mazerov, author of the AFSCME study. 
"Some states didn't do a very careful job of that, and wound up with something considerably worse." 

   California, Idaho, Maine, Oregon, South Carolina and Utah "did an outstanding job" in tilting tax liabilities away from the poor and toward the well-to-do, says the AFSCME. 
In California, a family of four with two wage-earners making $24,000 no longer pays state income tax; the family paid $167 in taxes in 1986. 
Idaho added two tax brackets for high-income residents. 

   Other states made their income taxes less progressive. 
The study says that in Nebraska, a wide range of income levels pay more after the 1987 changes, with the middle class getting the biggest hike. 
The District of Columbia went from 10 tax rates to three, resulting in larger tax liability in 1987 for persons earning less than $17,500 than before. 
In West Virginia, middle-income married couples are hit with 50% to 60% tax hikes. 
Some other states with less progressive income taxes in 1987, according to the union: Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Minnesota, New York and Wisconsin. 

   Pennsylvania ignored federal tax reform entirely. 
Taxpayers there pay a flat 2.1%, no matter how much they earn. 
Personal exemptions aren't allowed. 

   Karl Ross, a deputy revenue secretary in Pennsylvania, concedes that Pennsylvania's wealthy may not pay much, but "there are no deductions or shelters they can hide behind." 
Tax forms are simple, and easy to file, and revenue is steady year to year, he adds. 

   Mr. Ross says the flat tax is also a good business-development tool. 
When companies investigating Pennsylvania hear about the flat tax, "they get a friendly feeling toward the state," he says. 
"That's one of the reasons you don't see a movement to replace it."

                      Ranking the States
   The following figures look at the income-tax progressivity of  selected states. In Maine, an average household with two wage earners and two children and 1987 income of $125,000 paid more than 10 times the state income tax of a similar household with a $24,000 income. In Pennsylvania, the tax paid by the two households was identical.

   WASHINGTON -- State and local taxes have grown more
burdensome on lower- and middle-income families in the past
six years, according to a study by a largely labor-funded
research group.
   The study, by Citizens for Tax Justice, said these taxes
continue to take far more proportionately from the poor and
middle-class than from the rich.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The changes over the past six years have made the state
and local tax system extremely regressive -- that is, the tax
bite for lower- and middle-income families is a much larger
portion of income than it is for wealthy families -- in
almost every state, the report says. That is largely because
of state and local governments' reliance on the flat sales
tax.
   "Of course we need taxes to pay for public services," said
Robert McIntyre, director of the group. "But by letting the
rich off easy, most states have put too much of the tax
burden on those who can least afford to pay."
   Overall, the study estimated that in 1991 the bottom fifth
of families of four -- with income averaging $12,700 per
family -- will pay 13.8% of their income in state and local
taxes. For the middle fifth -- with an average income of
$39,100 -- state and local taxes will claim 10%. But the
wealthiest 1% of families, which make an average of $875,200
a year, will pay only 7.6% to state and local authorities.
   Those tax burdens have increased since 1985, the study
found, with proportionately bigger increases for the middle-
and lower-income groups. The 13.8% tax rate on the bottom
fifth of families is up from 12.6% in 1985. For the
wealthiest 1%, the 7.6% rate is an increase from 7.1%.
   The study measured income taxes, property taxes and sales
and excise taxes, and appeared to be the first such
comprehensive survey in a decade, experts said. "The study
could be influential in a year in which there are big
questions about how a lot of states are going to balance
their budgets," said Steven Gold, director of the Center for
the Study of the States, in Albany, N.Y. Reports by Citizens
for Tax Justice focusing on huge corporations that paid
little or no tax in the early 1980s were instrumental in
getting Congress to tighten the corporate minimum income tax
in the 1986 tax overhaul.
   The study looked at income and taxes paid by families of
four in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The study
also included corporate income taxes, divided among families
by measuring ownership of capital.
   Citizens for Tax Justice singled out a "terrible 10" list
of states with the biggest ratio between taxes paid by the
bottom 20% of families and the top 1%. Nevada led the list
with a tax rate of 10% on the bottom fifth and a tax rate of
1.8% -- the lowest rate in the country -- on the top 1%.
   Mr. McIntyre noted that many states known as "low-tax
states," mostly because they don't have income taxes,
actually tax middle- and low-income families at very high
rates when other taxes are considered. Texas, for instance,
ranked second on the group's "terrible 10" list, with a tax
rate of 17.1% on the poorest fifth of families and a rate of
3.1% on the top 1%. Washington state, fourth on the list, had
the highest tax rate on the poor: 17.4%.
   The other states with the biggest discrepancy between
taxes on rich and poor were: Florida, South Dakota,
Tennessee, Wyoming, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and
Illinois. Of the 10, only Pennsylvania and Illinois have
income taxes, and both of those tax income at a flat rate.
   Some of the study's findings are likely to be
controversial. Mr. Gold said scholars are divided about the
regressiveness of the property tax -- a big chunk of the tax
rate in all states -- and how to measure it. But, he said,
"on the whole it's true that nearly every state has a
regressive tax system and there isn't enough attention paid
to that fact."
   The study found just two states, Vermont and Delaware, in
which higher-income families pay a slightly higher rate of
state and local taxes than the middle- and lower-income
families.
   In the introduction to the study, Citizens for Tax Justice
didn't hide its view of what should be done. "There are
taxpayers who have room in their budgets to handle new state
and local taxes -- the rich," the report said. The group
urged states to rely more on graduated income taxes and less
on sales and excise taxes -- taxes on alcohol or cigarettes,
for instance -- that disproportionately affect lower-income
groups.

<TEXT>
   Half the states with income taxes have made
them less fair for many low- and middle-income residents since the
federal tax to which they are geared was thoroughly revised in
1986, a union-financed study reported Saturday.
   In 20 states and the District of Columbia, taxes were raised
more in percentage terms for some low- and middle-income taxpayers;
cut more for the wealthy, or increased outright on the poor and
middle class and reduced for the rich, according to the study by
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
   The union said the study provides the first solid evidence of
how state tax burdens have been shifted in the wake of federal tax
overhaul.
   ``While many states made great strides in improving the fairness
of their income taxes last year, too many continued to buy into the
old, failed ... program of cutting taxes for the wealthy,'' said
Gerald McEntee, union president. ``Making a working couple with two
kids and an income of $24,000 pay more taxes, while giving a tax
cut to the town banker who makes five times as much makes no
sense.''
   The 1.1-million-member union is a consisent backer of liberal
tax, spending and social policies. It favors ``progressive'' taxes
_ those in which ability to pay is a major factor.
   The study considered effects of the tax changes on four types of
households _ a one-earner couple with two children; two-earner
couple with two children; single parent with two children and a
single person _ at various income levels, ranging from $9,000 to
$125,000.
   Steve Gold of Denver, a spokesman for the National Conference of
State Legislatures, praised the thoroughness of the study but
issued one caution.
   ``If in any one of the 12 scenarios, the tax system became less
progressive, the study counted the system less progressive _ even
if in 11 of the 12 cases it was more progressive,'' Gold said. ``On
balance, the system was made more progressive in every state.''
   The report does not compare actual dollars of taxes paid in the
states, but deals only with distribution of the burden among
taxpayers with low, middele and upper incomes.
   Most states adopt the federal definition of taxable income. The
1986 broadening of the federal tax base by elimination or reduction
of several deductions thus gave the states more income to tax. The
increase in taxable income was accompanied by federal rate
reductions _ producing a tax cut for most people _ but that formula
was not followed by all the states.
   The study found that states ``were much more successful in
shifting the tax burden from the poor to the wealthy than from the
middle class to the wealthy.'' Ten states worsened the relative
burden on some poor families compared with wealthy families of the
same size while 19 shifted a part of the burden from the upper
levels to middle-income taxpayers.
   The study found that:

<TEXT>
   _Of the 41 states (including the District of Columbia) with
broad income taxes, all but New Jersey, North Carolina and
Pennsylvania significantly changed their systems last year.
   _In 17 states, the changes resulted in a more progressive
system, meaning more relief in percentage terms at lower incomes.
These states: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois,
Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri,
Montana, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia.
   _Progressivity declined for many low- and middle-income
households in 21 states: Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Delaware,
District of Columbia, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North
Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Vermont, West Virginia and
Wisconsin.
   _The significance of the changes in distribution varies widely
from state to state, because state tax laws are so different. For
example, progressivity was barely improved in Illinois because
capital gains _ a form of income held mostly by the well-to-do _
already were fully taxable. Utah improved progressivity
considerably by eliminating the state tax deduction for federal
taxes paid.
   _Only Mississippi imposed no income tax on any of the four
low-income groups studied ($9,000 single parent, $9,000 single
person, $12,000 one-earner couple with children and $12,000
two-earner couple with children).
   _Almost all states could dramatically improve the fairness of
their systems by simply making the state tax a percentage of
federal tax, as Rhode Island, Vermont and North Dakota do.
   _After last year's changes, California, Mississippi, New Mexico,
Maine and Rhode Island have the most progressive income taxes. The
least progressive are in Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, Alabama and
Pennsylvania.

<TEXT>     "The biggest problem is over-reliance on regressive sales and excise taxes
rather than on progressive, ability-to-pay income taxes," said Robert S.
McIntyre, director of the group.;    The findings were included in an analysis
by Citizens for Tax Justice. The analysis pinpoints the major taxes and who
pays them in the 50 states and the District of Columbia.;    The organization,
which is supported by unions and religious and social action groups, has long
advocated higher taxes on the wealthy and greater reliance on income taxes.;  
 The study found that only Vermont and Delaware have tax systems that are even
slightly progressive, meaning that they are based on ability to pay. The 10
states considered to have the least-fair taxes require middle-income families
to pay up to three times as much of their earnings compared with the rich.;   
The eight states viewed as having the worst tax systems -- South Dakota,
Nevada, Texas, Florida, Washington, Tennessee, Wyoming and New Hampshire --
have no broad personal income tax. Pennsylvania and Illinois, the other two
states found to be most regressive in taxing, have flat, low-rate income
taxes.;    Chris Zimmerman, chief economist for the National Conference of
State Legislatures, said he had not seen the report but acknowledged that, in
general, it is more difficult for states, cities and counties to maintain a
progressive tax system.;    "The federal government still relies on the income
tax for 90 percent of its revenue," leaving little income base for other
governments to tax, Zimmerman said. "If a state taxes wealthy people at a high
rate, they can simply move across the border into another state.";    By the
organization's reckoning, Nevada has the worst tax system. In Nevada, the
share of the poorest families' income earmarked for state and local taxes is 5
1/2 times that for the richest families. The rate for a middle-income family
is more than triple that for the rich.;    Texas is next, also requiring the
poor to pay 5 1/2 times the rate faced by the rich, while the share of
middle-income families is 2.7 times that of the wealthy.;    "Only in Vermont,
Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland and Minnesota do the richest 1 percent pay an equal
or greater share of income in state and local taxes as the share paid by the
poorest fifth of families," the report said.;    "Only California, Delaware,
Maine and Vermont tax their richest citizens at greater rates than they impose
on middle-income families. Only Vermont and Delaware succeed at both," it
added.;    In California, the study found that families with the lowest
earnings, which average $12,700 nationwide, paid 14.1 percent of their income
on state and local taxes; middle income families (averaging $39,100) paid 8.8
percent, and the rich (averaging $875,200) paid 10.6 percent.;    "The best we
can say is that there are still a few places where the Rockefellers and the
Trumps are asked to pay taxes at slightly higher rates than the Orphan Annies
and Oliver Twists of the world," McIntyre said.;    Washington has the highest
taxes on the poor: 17.4 percent of their income, the report said. Nevada has
the lowest taxes on the rich: 1.8 percent.;  Who gets taxed how much; Key

<HL> SMALL BUSINESS:
Companies Shifting Tax Focus
As State Levies Loom Larger

<TEXT>
   NAPLES, FLA., IS HOME for Rasmussen Communications Management Corp., whose business is arranging broadcasts of college sports events. 
But when the company's executives conclude a contract with a TV or radio station, they fly to Chicago for the signing. 

   That is because Illinois, where Rasmussen has its production studio, has a lower corporate income-tax rate than Florida -- 4% compared with 5.5%. 
Moreover, when deciding what portion of a company's profit is subject to its income tax, Florida uses a formula that weights sales clinched in the Sunshine State twice as heavily as Illinois weights sales concluded within its borders. 

   "We've been looking at exactly where our income is earned, rather than just assuming it's been in Florida where we're incorporated," says E. Patricia Killory, Rasmussen's vice president of finance. 
"We're trying to shift as much of our income as possible to Illinois." 

   Increasingly, small companies like Rasmussen are taking greater pains to manage -- and minimize -- their state income-tax burdens. 
"Most businesses focus on their federal income taxes," says Victor V. Coppola, director of national emerging-business services for the accounting firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 
"More and more, I'm seeing companies focus on their state income taxes." 

   THE SHIFT IN FOCUS stems from several factors. 
State income-tax rates have risen in recent years as states have sought money to offset cutbacks in revenue-sharing and other federal funds. 
For the same reason, state tax agencies have become more aggressive in enforcement and audit efforts. 

   The prime cause of the shift, however, is the new federal tax law. 
By lowering the top federal corporate rate to 34% from 46%, the legislation effectively made state taxes more costly by reducing their value as a deduction on the federal return. 
"A dollar in state taxes used to cost you 54 cents out of pocket," says Joseph J. Nugent, Coopers &amp; Lybrand's regional director of state and local taxes in Philadelphia. 
"Now it's going to cost 66 cents." 

   Moreover, the new federal law indirectly raised state income taxes by wiping out many deductions. 
Most states allow only the deductions the federal government allows, so deductions lost on the federal level were lost on the state level, too. 
The resulting changes are expected to add at least $1 billion -- and perhaps as much as $2.5 billion -- to the approximately $18 billion corporations pay annually in state income taxes. 

   The impact of the federal tax overhaul was "the straw that broke the camel's back," says Gerrold S. Gattegno, director of the multi-state tax practice at Deloitte, Haskins &amp; Sells. 
"If somebody wasn't thinking about state taxes before, they certainly are now." 

   BUSINESS OWNERS are using a variety of strategies to trim their state tax bills. 
For companies that do business in more than one state, one approach is to tinker with the formula by which income is allocated among each state. 
The formula is based on the amount of property, employees and sales a company has in each state. 

   A New Jersey data-processing company, for example, has restructured into a holding company with two subsidiaries, one that owns the computers and another that employs the national sales force. 

   Previously, the extent of its assets in New Jersey required the company to report most of its income in that state, where the tax rate is a hefty 9%. 
With its salesmen and service force in a separate subsidiary, the company now can allocate more income to lower-tax states where they actually conclude sales. 
As a result, the company has trimmed its consolidated state tax rate to 6.2% from 7.5%. 

   Some strategies are ideally suited to small businesses. 
For example, when a small Pennsylvania cosmetics company recently went public, it first set up an investment holding company in Delaware to hold the cash from the offering until it was needed for working capital. 
That is because interest and other investment income aren't taxable in Delaware but are in Pennsylvania. 

   OTHER STRATEGIES INCLUDE separately incorporating profitable operations in low-tax states, merging less-profitable operations with profitable ones in high-tax states and setting intercompany transfer pricing at favorable levels. 
Establishing financing, sales, management, or other types of subsidiaries in states with low rates also can produce tax savings. 

   However, warns Coopers &amp; Lybrand's Mr. Coppola, a company shouldn't make decisions affecting where income is taxed until it has analyzed the impact on other state levies, such as property, payroll and sales taxes. 
"To focus solely on income tax might be missing the ball," he says. 
"The total state tax picture should be looked at." 

   Accountants also warn that tax decisions favorable in one state could be harmful in another. 
For example, not all states recognize S corporations, which pay taxes on business income at personal-income rates. 

   Electing to become an S corporation could be favorable if personal rates are lower than corporate rates. 
But under certain circumstances, a business that makes an S election could wind up paying double state taxes on part of its income, says Leonard Powers, director of state and local taxes at Arthur Anderson &amp; Co. 

   "When a small business starts moving into a multi-state environment," Mr. Powers warns, "the tax question becomes more than just a puzzle. 
It's a kaleidoscope. 
It's constantly changing."

paychecks by Friday, Casey said.;    Pennsylvania ended the fiscal year with a
$454 million deficit. The tax increase was designed to keep the state in the
black for at least two more years.;    The personal income tax will increase
from 2.1 percent now to 3.1 percent from July 1 until July 1, 1992, then drop
to 2.8 percent. A person earning $20,000 a year will see his or her tax jump
from $420 a year to $620 under the 3.1 percent rate.;    The corporate net
income tax will increase from 8.5 percent to 10.5 percent, with a temporary
1.5 percent surcharge added to the base.;    The Pennsylvania tax plan also
will expand the 6 percent sales tax to include premium cable channels, lawn
care service, long-distance phone calls, lobbying, computer services and most
household paper products. It increases the cigarette tax by 13 cents, to 31
cents a pack.;    In Connecticut, the proposed plan would broadly expand the
base of the state's 8 percent sales tax and increase cigarette taxes by a dime
per pack and gasoline taxes by about 8 cents per gallon. It also will levy new
taxes on gifts, gambling winnings, commercial leases and expensive mortgages.  </TEXT>

   High Capital-Gains Tax Busts State Budgets

   Many state governments, particularly in coastal states
with a large proportion of affluent taxpayers, have faced
unexpected weakness in their tax receipts in the past three
or four years. This has led many states to introduce higher
income- and sales-tax rates, which damaged their own
economies and placed a significant drag on the national
economy as well.
   The states' choice is part of a downward spiral. States'
self-inflicted damage reduces federal tax receipts. Weak
federal receipts then increase the threat of higher federal
rates, hurting the economy and in turn weakening state
receipts. States then raise taxes, and the cycle continues.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   One particular federal tax has had an especially harsh
impact on state tax receipts: the 33% maximum marginal tax
rate on capital gains enacted in 1986. Raising the maximum
marginal rate on capital gains to 33% from 20% stopped the
natural growth of taxable state income from this source.
States in which capital gains had previously been an
important source of taxable state income are finding weak tax
receipts, perhaps without understanding the reason.
   The chart shows realized capital gains (net after losses)
for the five states that account for nearly half the capital
gains in the entire nation (see accompanying chart -- WSJ
Sep. 14, 1990). Florida and Texas have no income tax, which
is one reason that many people who have accumulated
substantial assets live there. New York, California and
Illinois have long depended heavily on capital gains taxes.
So have New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and
Connecticut.
   Until recently, evidence that a high federal capital gains
rate has hurt state collections might have been deemed
ambiguous. People rushed to realize gains in 1986 because the
tax rate was about to rise to 28% the following year. It
might be argued too that in 1987 capital gains were weak
because of the October stock market crash, though there were
plenty of gains in the year's first eight months.
   In any case, the ambiguity ended when the Internal Revenue
Service released its 1988 estimates this spring. For all five
states in the chart, the amount of capital gains reported was
less than half of what it had been in 1986, the last year of
20% tax rates, and well below the level of 1985 (about 5%
lower, on average). This decline in taxable state income from
capital gains over three years occurred despite the
nationwide increase of more than 22% in personal income in
that same period.
   For the federal government, the weakness in realizations
since 1986 has been at least partly offset by a much higher
average tax rate on a small volume of capital gains. The
maximum federal capital gains tax was increased to 45% in
1975 from 27% in 1968. Yet so few of the affected
high-bracket taxpayers actually realized gains at the
punitive rates of 1975 that the average capital-gains tax (on
both excluded and taxable gains) remained exactly the same in
1975 as it had been in 1968: 15%. The 1985 reduction of the
highest capital gains tax to 20% percent so encouraged
efficient turnover of assets among higher-income taxpayers
that the average tax paid remained exactly what it had been
in the high-tax 1970s: 15%.
   In 1988, by contrast, the capital gains tax on the
highest-income taxpayers rose to 28% percent, but the average
tax rate rose to 24%. It is doubtful if there has ever been a
time in U.S. history when so many taxpayers faced tax rates
above 20% on the uncertain rewards from life savings.
   States in which capital gains were a particularly
important source of taxable income expected this source of
income to grow between 1985 and 1988. After all, the Dow
Jones average at the end of 1988 was 62% higher than it had
been in 1985. But the states were mugged by the federal tax
law of 1986. By imposing a 28-33% tax -- even on the inflated
capital gains of couples with rather modest incomes -- the
federal government made it extremely expensive for nearly all
taxpayers to realize any capital gains, particularly in
states that added their own tax on top of the federal levy,
where the combined capital gains burden could reach 39%.
Taxpayers responded by avoiding the sale of assets (except
under financial distress), and by making sure that their
future investments were not subject to combined capital-gains
taxes -- they invested in money-market funds instead of
growth stocks. Tax receipts collapsed in states most
dependent on capital gains -- including much of the
northeast.
   But this is not the only adverse effect of high federal
capital-gains taxes on state revenues. The increased federal
tax rate on capital gains also provides a greater incentive
to locate small businesses in states with little or no income
tax, because of the brutal combination of federal and state
capital-gains tax on those who sell their businesses. Loss of
deductibility for state income taxes would greatly aggravate
this effect for small businesses remaining in states like New
Jersey, New York and California. For taxpayers in a 33%
federal bracket and an 8% state bracket, for example, the
combined marginal tax on capital gains would rise to 41% from
the current 38%. Even fewer capital gains would then be
cashed in states with high income-tax rates.
   Governors of several states most injured by the federal
tax on capital gains are widely considered to be "liberal"
Democrats who are supposed to favor high federal tax rates on
capital gains out of ideological habit. Yet the evidence is
now clear that this federal tax clearly damages their own
state treasuries, even aside from its damaging effects on the
economic growth and on the value of real estate and other
assets. State governors properly complain about the many
other ways in which the federal government attempts to
preempt the states' tax bases -- by limiting the
deductibility of state income taxes or imposing higher
federal excise taxes. Since taxpayers do not have infinitely
deep pockets, the more the federal government takes, the less
is left for the states. Yet in the case of capital gains,
governors of the states most seriously injured appear willing
to impose draconian state tax rates on their citizens rather
than lobby for relief from this counterproductive federal
tax.

   The tax issue, the Republican Party's most consistently
successful political weapon, seems poised to rescue the GOP
in Pennsylvania.
   Dick Thornburgh, former U.S. attorney general and onetime
governor, will use the issue in Pennsylvania's special Senate
election this November. Democratic strategists understand the
importance of the issue, too, and are trying to position
Democratic incumbent Harris Wofford as a populist, anti-tax
candidate. But that won't be easy given the Democratic
Party's national reputation and current public opinion about
Sen. Wofford's most recent employer, Democratic Gov. Robert
Casey.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The early evidence in Pennsylvania -- as well as in such
states as New Jersey, West Virginia, Connecticut and
California -- is that voters are still digging in their heels
against tax increases and want to punish political leaders
who push large hikes.
   Sen. Wofford, appointed by Gov. Casey to fill the seat of
the late Republican Sen. John Heinz, formerly served as
secretary of industry and labor in the Casey administration.
He has been a college president and helped found the Peace
Corps, but he has never held elective office.
   Mr. Thornburgh has name recognition, fund-raising ability
and a generally positive reputation as governor (1979-87) --
but his greatest advantage may be the unpopular Mr. Casey,
whom he will link to Mr. Wofford at every opportunity.
   Mr. Casey was re-elected governor last year with almost
68% of the vote, the biggest Pennsylvania gubernatorial
victory since 1926. During the campaign, he dismissed
warnings by his Republican opponent about state budget
problems, but soon after the election the governor told
Pennsylvanians that the state was facing a budget crisis and
a tax increase was necessary. At that point, Mr. Casey's
popularity ratings went into a free fall.
   One June 1991 GOP survey showed that 52% of registered
voters disapproved of the governor's job performance; 63%, of
his handling of the budget. The same survey found that 63%
thought Mr. Casey had covered up the deficit during the
campaign, and that the GOP enjoyed a 46%-30% advantage as the
party best able to hold the line on taxes in Pennsylvania.
   Last month, things got even worse for Mr. Casey, as the
Legislature passed and governor signed the largest tax
increase in the state's history, including boosts in
personal, corporate and many other taxes. Pennsylvania now
has the highest corporate net income tax in the nation.
   Not surprisingly, Thornburgh strategists regard the
state's budget and increased taxes as major issues against
Mr. Wofford. "Bob Casey is the poster child for raising
taxes, and we don't intend to let Harris Wofford run away
from his mentor. They are joined at the hip on this issue,"
says Thornburgh campaign manager Michele Davis. The
Republican's campaign yesterday began to air a commercial
that argues that "the state lived within its means" during
Mr. Thornburgh's administration, a not-so-subtle criticism of
the current Democratic administration.
   The state GOP is so sure that the Democrats are on the
rocks that it has aired radio spots blasting the governor and
asking anyone who wants to register Republican to call an 800
number for information.
   But Pennsylvania Democrats understand the significance of
the tax issue, and Mr. Wofford and his state party are trying
to turn it to their advantage. When the senator accepted the
Democratic nomination back in June, he committed himself to
"federal tax relief for the middle class," and during the
past few weeks he has promised to introduce tax-cut
legislation. His campaign manager, Paul Begala, says
unhesitatingly that "It's time for the {Democratic} Party to
fight back and be the party of tax cuts for the middle class
and working people."
   The Pennsylvania Democratic Party has also tried to paint
Mr. Thornburgh as the "pro-tax" candidate. It has run radio
ads that charge that the former governor raised taxes 10
times during his two terms in office and "holds the record
for over-all tax increases totaling nearly $5 billion."
   By all indications, the Wofford-Thornburgh Senate race
should turn into a bloody affair, with the senator raising
questions about Mr. Thornburgh's years at the Justice
Department and trying to drive up the Republican's negative
ratings among voters. But the electorate's anger is directed
at the Casey administration, and Mr. Thornburgh should be
able to blunt Mr. Wofford's attacks by running against the
governor, the state's budget mess and the recent tax
increase.
   If Pennsylvania were an anomaly, the state's Senate race
would not be nearly as instructive as it is. But tax
increases are undoing other governors -- Democrat,
independent and Republican alike.
   In New Jersey, Democratic Gov. Jim Florio has not
recovered from voter outrage following a $2.8 billion
increase in sales and income taxes earlier this year even
though the state has mailed $650 million in "homestead rebate
checks" to property owners and renters. A Newark Star-Ledger
poll, conducted earlier this month by Rutgers' Eagleton
Institute, shows that only 23% of respondents said Mr. Florio
had done a good or excellent job as governor, while 73% rated
him fair or poor. Two-thirds of those surveyed in a late
August Bergen Record poll of likely voters in this November's
legislative elections said they would vote for anyone who
runs against the governor when he is up for reelection in
1993.
   Voter anger over taxes almost cost Democratic Sen. Bill
Bradley re-election last year, and New Jersey Democrats are
worried about their prospects in this year's state
legislative elections.
   In Connecticut, Lowell Weicker, an independent who
virtually forced the state General Assembly to institute a
state income tax by vetoing three budgets that did not
include such a tax, has seen his poll numbers plummet. In a
recent statewide poll, 56% said that Mr. Weicker should not
be re-elected, and 73% rated his job performance as fair or
poor. While some editorial writers complimented the governor
for his courage, most state residents would have selected a
different adjective to describe Mr. Weicker.
   Neither Mr. Florio nor Mr. Weicker campaigned for election
on a platform of tax increases, undoubtedly because they
understood the political realities. And they, like Democratic
Gov. Gaston Caperton of West Virginia and Republican Gov.
Pete Wilson of California, both of whom also proposed big tax
increases and have seen their support erode, will find their
re-elections imperiled by the increases.

   PITTSBURGH -- Pennsylvania business groups lashed out at
higher taxes contained in the state budget passed by the
Legislature this weekend following a rancorous five-week
delay.
   But defenders of the $14 billion budget, which could cost
taxpayers about $3.5 billion in new taxes, said business will
suffer no more or no less than other vital interest groups.

   Gov. Robert P. Casey, a Democrat, signed the budget bill
Sunday night, restoring pay to thousands of state workers who
haven't received full pay since the fiscal year began July 1.
As it ended the fiscal year, Pennsylvania had a budget
deficit of $454 million.
   Meanwhile, in Connecticut, which also has been in caught
up in a budget crisis, the General Assembly passed its third
budget plan without an income tax, voting instead to raise
other taxes and fees by $740 million. Gov. Lowell P. Weicker,
who has been determined to implement an income tax, said he
would take several days to review the budget plan before
deciding whether to veto it, sign it, or let it become law
without his stamp on it.
   Some Connecticut lawmakers noted that the new budget was
similar to two previous budgets the governor already had
vetoed. Gov. Weicker issued an executive order to keep the
state government running for another week. The state has been
without a budget since July 1.
   Concerning the Pennsylvania budget, Doug Saltzman, manager
of governmental affairs for the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of
Commerce, estimated that the budget bill will cost businesses
an additional $1.7 billion in new taxes and increase the
corporate net income tax rate to 12.25% from 8.5%.
   Clifford Jones, president of the Pennsylvania Chamber of
Business and Industry, criticized the governor and lawmakers
for failing to make spending cuts and then collaborating to
impose unduly "punitive" tax increases. He said the
general-fund tax package actually will collect more taxes
than lawmakers have estimated, closer to $4 billion than the
stated $2.85 billion.
   "We're now the highest business tax state in the nation
and maybe in the world," Mr. Jones said. "It may drive some
people out."

   The drive for state tax reform is more fervent this year than at any time since the tax revolt of a decade ago. 
The impetus for all this activity, of course, is the new federal tax law, which shook this country's philosophy of taxation to its foundations. 

   Taxation used to be mainly a system for sweeping up revenue and applying it to public-spending commitments. 
Now the new tax system will encourage more economic growth. 
The lion's share of each extra dollar of new income will go to the productive person who worked for it, not to Uncle Sam. 

   But most states are still piggybacked on the old revenue-driven federal system. 
For many taxpayers, it could be a heavy load. 
If they fail to adjust rates to reflect the federal changes, 11 states will effectively impose tax increases ranging from 15% to 28% according to a National Governors Association Survey, and 10% to 15% in 11 other states. 
The biggest potential automatic hikes are in: Louisiana, 28%; Utah and Montana, 19%; Kansas and Oklahoma, 18%. 

   So far nine states plan no rate adjustment, which means their residents will be hit with backdoor tax hikes. 
Three states -- Illinois, Kansas and Iowa -- stand to gain windfalls of $100 million to $175 million. 
Other states expecting tax windfalls from $100 million to $700 million -- among them, Colorado, Missouri, Oregon, Maryland and Minnesota -- plan to return some and spend some. 
So their residents will also get socked with more taxes. 

   Only Ohio and New York have committed to returning their entire windfall to taxpayers. 
In other words, only two of more than 30 states expecting windfalls have promised their residents they won't raise their taxes. (The only other states that won't see an increase in taxes are those that don't peg assessments to the federal code -- New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Tennessee -- and the seven states with no state income tax of any kind.) 

   Ohio's Gov. Richard Celeste, a Democrat, signed a law last December that lowers the state's personal income-tax rate across the board, reduces its top corporate income-tax rate and enlarges its lowest corporate tax bracket. 
These revisions will offset an expected tax windfall of more than $700 million over two years. 

   New York may go one step further. 
Despite a fair amount of public haggling over how big the cut should be and when it should take effect, Gov. Cuomo and the state legislature have promised to cut rates to offset New York's estimated $2 billion huge windfall. 
They also agreed last week to further trim personal and corporate rates -- reducing tax burdens even more. 
If the governor and state legislature follow through, New Yorkers will do better than break even on state taxes; they'll come out ahead. 

   Nearly half the states claim to be strapped for revenue, particularly those dependent on oil or agriculture. 
But legislators tempted to spend tax windfalls rather than cut spending may encounter opposition from taxpayers themselves. 
Utah's Republican Gov. Norm Bangerter plans to not only withhold the state's projected $50 million windfall from taxpayers but also to increase taxes by $200 million. 
This drew 3,000 anti-tax protesters to the state capital in Salt Lake City. 
Trying to sneak tax increases up the back stairs could prove unpopular when the racket wakes taxpayers up. 

   Perhaps the prickliest question confronting states that plan to return some or all of their tax bonanza to taxpayers is how the money should be distributed. 
As a large part of the windfall is derived from high-income individuals (mostly through bigger bites out of capital gains) and from corporations, it follows that they should receive the biggest state tax cuts. 
Ohio did exactly that, lowering its top personal rate to 6.9% from 8% on income above $100,000, and chopping its top corporate rate to 8.9% from 9.7%. 
These adjustments of rates won't result in smaller tax burdens for the state's wealthiest taxpayers; it only means their liabilities won't be any greater. 

   Other state governments wrangling over windfalls, however, see an opportunity to redistribute income from residents in top tax brackets to those in lower brackets. 
Missouri, Maryland and Colorado -- expecting windfalls of up to $200 million -- not only intend to withhold a sizable portion of their windfalls for legislators' pet projects, they also plan to adjust marginal rates so that taxpayers already paying the largest share of taxes pay an even greater share. 

   But what these states may gain in the short run by holding on to their windfalls and effectively raising their tax rates will likely be offset over time by a loss of revenue due to corporate capital flight and tax avoidance by high-income individuals. 
This is what is known as the dynamic effect of tax policy. 
Put another way, people with alternatives don't just stand there and let the tax man beat up on them. 
They move. 

   Only Ohio and New York so far have taken this dynamic analysis into account while preparing their tax-code revisions. 
That is what is known as a competitive advantage.

   WASHINGTON -- While Washington wrangles about tax
fairness, more and more states are quietly doing something
about it.
   Minnesota has raised the rate on family incomes of more
than $172,120 to 8.5% from 8% -- and may raise it again next
year. Kansas's governor, who vetoed an income-tax increase
this year, says she may sign one next year if it goes after
the wealthy. Maine legislators may repeal the sales-tax
exemption for caviar.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the wave of state tax increases this year to combat
rising red ink, says Mike Ettlinger, state tax-policy
director for the research group Citizens for Tax Justice,
"virtually every" income-tax change was progressive -- that
is, it fell more heavily on affluent taxpayers than on
lower-income ones. In four states -- California, North
Carolina, Minnesota and New York -- the entire brunt of the
income-tax rise was borne by the wealthiest taxpayers.
   Now, with half of all the states facing revenue shortfalls
for next year as well, state-tax experts predict a new push
toward progressivity -- especially to offset the regressive
nature of the many increases expected for sales and excise
taxes.
   The new interest in progressive taxation stands in
contrast to the trend of recent years, in which the states
lagged well behind the federal government in taxing incomes
of the wealthy. The shift may signal a change in public
attitudes about the rich presaged by political commentator
Kevin Phillips's 1990 book, "The Politics of Rich and Poor,"
which argued that federal policies had accelerated an upward
distribution of wealth in the 1980s -- and which became a
sort of bible to many state-tax officials. "The group that
has the money has expanded so much they become a target,"
asserts Mr. Phillips.
   Alternatively, the trend may simply reflect the exhaustion
of other revenue sources. Collectively, the states raised
taxes by $16 billion this year, and officials would prefer to
rely on deeper budget cuts and hopes of an economic recovery
rather than have to raise them again in an election year. But
that may not be possible, given expected shortfalls ranging
from $2 billion in California to $105 million in Maine.
   Whatever the reason, "income taxes are palatable in the
1990s, while they were anathema in the 1980s," says
Democratic state Rep. Paul Ogren, tax committee chairman of
the Minnesota House of Representatives. Is raising taxes
easier to sell to voters when it's targeted at the affluent?
"You bet it is," says Mr. Ogren.
   Minnesota is a case in point. Faced this year with a
budget gap, the Legislature voted to increase taxes on family
incomes of more than $172,120 to 9% from 8%. The new bracket
was vetoed by Republican Gov. Arne Carlson, but eventually
legislators got him to sign a bill with a top rate of 8.5%.
Now Mr. Ogren is proposing a new top rate of 10%, with the
proceeds to be plowed back into tax relief for the middle
class.
   Another state that may target the rich in 1992 is Kansas.
Democratic Gov. Joan Finney this year vetoed a $90 million
income-tax increase because, she said, it and an accompanying
sales-tax rise would harm middle-income families. Instead,
the governor chose to slash budgets 1% across the board.
   Now, however, the governor is willing to consider an
income-tax increase to offset property-tax cuts provided it
is "truly progressive" and is focused on high incomes,
according to spokeswoman Martha Walker.
   The push to get the affluent to pay more taxes came this
year largely from state legislators, most of them Democrats,
who sought to provide some balance to steep sales-tax
increases that were seen as harmful to the poor. In
California, for instance, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson wanted
to raise the sales tax to 6% from 4.75%, and to eliminate
previous exemptions for candy and snack foods. State
legislators agreed -- and then coupled the sales-tax increase
with new 10% and 11% income-tax brackets for individuals
earning $100,000 and $200,000, respectively ($200,000 and
$400,000 for couples filing jointly).
   With the state now staring at yet another huge deficit
next year, the Legislature is unlikely to raise the
income-tax rate again -- but it will consider closing tax
loopholes available to the wealthy, for example by
eliminating state deductibility of mortgage interest for
vacation homes.
   A similar gambit might be in store for Maine, which this
year raised its top income-tax rate to 8.6% from 8.5%, for
married joint filers earning more than $75,000 -- plus a 15%
surcharge on income above that amount.
   In a few states, the governor rather than the legislature
has been the driving force getting the rich to pay more state
taxes. That's the case in Connecticut, where independent Gov.
Lowell Weicker got a reluctant Legislature to enact a
firstever state income tax. Gov. Weicker says that he
initially opposed an income tax, but stoutly asserts that the
alternative would have left him "trying to run the state with
the poor paying for it."
   Connecticut legislators have repeatedly tried to repeal
the 4.5% flat-rate tax, a levy that has the state's voters
hopping mad. But for now, at least, Mr. Weicker has enough
Statehouse votes to sustain a veto of any alternatives.
Meanwhile, the governor says he has "no problems at all" with
altering the tax to making the income-tax plan "fairer and
better," presumably by switching to a graduated rate
structure. (Currently, the tax is "progressive" only in the
sense that it provides some tax credits for low-income people
and exempts the first $24,000 for a married couple earning
less than $48,000, phasing out that exemption for families
earning more.)
   Traditionally, state taxes have taxed the rich far more
lightly than the federal government. Indeed, nine states --
including Florida, Texas, Washington and Tennessee -- have no
income tax at all, relying instead on a mixture of sales,
corporate and property taxes. A report issued last April by
Citizens for Tax Justice found that when all major state and
local taxes were added together, nearly every state was found
to tax the poorest 20% of its people at higher rates than the
richest 1%. According to the study, only four states --
California, Delaware, Maine and Vermont -- required the top
1% to pay higher rates than the middle 20%.
   Now that era may be drawing to a close. "It's not a
revolution," says Steven Gold, director of the Center for the
Study of the States in Albany, N.Y. "But it's a shift of
direction."

   President Bush and senior Republican congressmen last week
announced they had agreed on a budget proposal to cap the
amount of state and local income taxes taxpayers can deduct
on their federal tax returns. The plan would cap deductions
at $10,000. If passed and implemented, the plan will have
widely different effects. The increased burden caused by
reducing federal deductions for state and local taxes will be
borne unevenly by the states. The result will be a list of
"winning" and "losing" states with respect to their
residents' tax burdens.
   It is widely taken for granted that most tax deductions
benefit only the wealthy. But approximately 70% of all
itemized deductions benefit the middle-income ranges. Of the
numerous exclusions and deductions, those for pension
contributions, mortgage interest on homes, payments from
employers for medical insurance and care, state and local
income and property taxes, and Social Security benefits
account for more than half the amount going to individuals.
These deductions are popular because they benefit millions of
Americans. With the exception of direct Social Security and
Medicare payments, they provide the biggest middle-class
benefit in the federal budget.

   Reducing or eliminating the current deductibility of state
and local income taxes will have a great impact on citizens
of states that use these two forms of taxation as their major
source of tax revenue. New York, Massachusetts and Maryland,
which bear the greatest per-capita burden of state and local
income taxes, will naturally be the victims of any reduction
in the deductibility of those taxes. (New Jersey citizens
will approach the top of the list after Gov. James Florio's
new tax increases kick in.) Residents of those same states
are already among those that pay the highest total per-capita
federal taxes. Thus New Yorkers, citizens of Massachusetts,
and Marylanders will all feel more strongly the bite of the
tax burden their states impose on them.
   Conversely, the federal tax liability of residents in
states that have no income tax will not change one cent if
the deductibility of state income tax is eliminated.
Currently, seven states -- Florida, Nevada, South Dakota,
Texas, Washington, Wyoming and Alaska -- impose no individual
income tax. Three states -- Connecticut, New Hampshire, and
Tennessee -- impose no levy on earned income, taxing interest
and dividends only. (Connecticut also taxes capital gains.)
Although residents of such states do not gain absolutely,
they do gain relative to those of high income-tax states. The
new disparity might well cause people to "vote with their
feet" and move from high-tax states to lower-tax states. In
this age of computers and faxes, why choose to live in
high-tax states like New York or New Jersey at all?

   From Connecticut to California, state taxes are taking a
bigger chunk of most taxpayers' income -- and there isn't any
relief in sight.
   Hammered by recession and federal cutbacks, 34 states and
the District of Columbia raised income, sales and use and
corporate taxes by $16.2 billion, or 5.4%, in this year's
legislative sessions. It was the largest one-year percentage
increase since 1971, according to the National Conference of
State Legislatures.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Taxes on personal income account for $6.5 billion of the
increase, with 21 states raising personal income taxes by
boosting rates, eliminating exemptions, imposing temporary
surcharges or suspending previously enacted cuts. That
doesn't include rises enacted earlier that took effect this
year, such as New Jersey's 1990 law that doubled the levy on
high-income earners to 7% from 3.5%.
   Moreover, the outlook is for further increases in 1992.
"There will be tremendous pressure to avoid raising state
taxes again next year, since it's an election year and many
states have had back-to-back tax increases," says Scott
Mackey, a policy specialist at the state legislative group.
But because revenue collections are falling short, many
states will have to retain temporary tax increases and
surcharges they enacted this year, he says.
   Most of the personal income-tax increases enacted during
recent legislative sessions were retroactive to last Jan. 1,
1991, meaning taxpayers will be seeing the full effect on
this year's tax bill.
   But increases in some states -- such as Illinois's
temporary increase to 3% from 2.5% -- went into effect July
1. Still others go into effect Jan. 1, 1992.
   Connecticut took center stage by enacting its first
broad-based personal income tax, a flat-rate tax that will
amount to 1.5% this year and 4.5% beginning Jan. 1. The new
levy replaces a tax of as much as 14% on interest and
dividends and 7% on capital gains.
   "People are furious," says Patricia Burton, a tax
specialist in Gales Ferry, Conn. A special session of the
state's Legislature convened Monday to consider repealing the
measure, but income-tax opponents apparently lack the votes
needed to override a promised veto by Gov. Lowell Weicker.
   Pennsylvania increased its personal income-tax rate to
3.1% (including a 0.3% surtax) through next June from a
previous rate of 2.1%. "The chances are, however, these
surtaxes never lapse," says Larry C. Rabun, a Philadelphia
partner in Deloitte &amp; Touche accountants.
   New York state postponed a previously enacted tax cut that
would have lowered its top income-tax rate to 7.7% from
7.875% and delayed an increase in the standard deduction. And
Rhode Island increased its personal income-tax rate to 27.5%
of federal tax liability from 22.96%.
   Some states zeroed in on high-income individuals.
California, for example, imposed new, temporary tax brackets
on high-income earners. For 1991, there will be a 10% rate
for single taxpayers with taxable income of more than
$100,000 and couples filing jointly with more than $200,000.
For taxpayers with taxable income in excess of $200,000
(single) and $400,000 (joint), the rate will be 11%.
Previously, the top rate was 9.3%. California also increased
the rate of its alternative minimum tax to 8.5% from 7%.
   Maine imposed a temporary 10% surcharge for incomes of
more than $75,000 (married, filing jointly). North Carolina
increased its rate to 7.75% from 7% for taxpayers with
taxable income of more than $100,000 (married, filing
jointly) and more than $60,000 (single.)
   In general, there are no special strategies for easing the
state and local bites. But taxpayers in such states as
Connecticut who face a higher income-tax rate next year might
consider shifting income into 1991 if possible. For example,
if you have an end-of-the-year bonus coming, it would make
sense to receive it in December instead of January.
   Connecticut residents could also save money by deferring
any major capital gains until next year, when the
capital-gains tax is capped at 4.5%, says Kevin Roach, a
partner for personal financial planning at accountants Price
Waterhouse in Morristown, N.J. This year the capital-gains
tax consists of two-thirds of the old rate of 7% and
one-third of the new rate of 4.5%, for a combined rate of
6.2%.
   Also, it's important to remember the effects of state and
local levies in reviewing your financial and investment
plans. "With state taxes at record highs and pressures for
increases to continue next year, the stakes are higher than
ever before," says Mr. Roach.
   For instance, high state and local taxes can raise the
effective yield on Treasury securities, which are exempt from
state and local income taxes. Tax-exempt municipal bonds from
in-state issuers and same-state municipal-bond funds can also
be more attractive for residents of high-tax states.
   People who are really fed up could take drastic action and
move. Alaska, Florida, Texas, Washington, Nevada, South
Dakota and Wyoming, for example, have no personal income tax;
two other states, New Hampshire and Tennessee, don't tax
wages and salaries but do tax capital gains, dividends and
interest.
   But moving isn't really practical for most people. And
besides, says Hal Hovey, editor of State Budget and Tax News,
an Alexandria, Va., newsletter, needs for services for
exploding populations are likely to cause Florida, Texas and
Nevada to increase taxes on individuals as well as on
corporations. The increases may not come through a personal
income tax, but revenues can be raised by increasing sales
and use taxes, Mr. Hovey says.
   Retirees often do flee to low-tax states. But if they are
California residents, they may find that the state pursues
them to collect income tax on payouts of a pension earned in
California.
   Marvin Weisbrod, vice president of Triplecheck Income Tax
Service Inc., a tax-preparation concern based in Burbank,
Calif., says retired California teachers and state employees
who moved to Nevada were taxed by California on their pension
payouts even though they were no longer living in the state.
Everyone with a pension earned while living in California is
liable for the tax, but it's hard to find fleeing retirees
unless they were state employees, Mr. Weisbrod says.

   State tax collections rose by 7.5 percent in
fiscal 1989 over the previous year, the Commerce Department says.
   The agency said Tuesday that state tax collections totaled $284
billion in 1989, up from $264 billion a year earlier.
   Eight states reported increases of more than 10 percent
including Oregon, up 22.5 percent, and California, up 14.2 percent.
   Other increases above 10 percent included 13.4 percent in
Delaware, 12.7 percent in Alaska, 11.5 percent in Idaho, 11.1
percent in Indiana, 10.8 percent in Iowa and 10.2 percent in
Kentucky.
   Only Utah and South Dakota reported decreases in state tax
collections. Utah was down 11.4 percent while South Dakota dropped
1.7 percent.
   The Commerce Department said the national average per capita
state tax ranged from a high of $2,675 in Alaska to $554 in New
Hampshire.
   Alaska, New Hampshire and Wyoming have no state income or sales
taxes. The severance tax, which applies to oil and other minerals
extracted from the earth, is the primary source of state income in
Alaska and Wyoming, while the corporate net income tax is the
largest source in New Hampshire.
   Other states ranking at the top of the per capita list were:
Hawaii, 1,994; Delaware, $1,679; Massachusetts, $1,534;
Connecticut, $1,485; New York, $1,481; Minnesota, $1,470;
California, $1,418; Washington, $1,367, and New Jersey, $1,357.
   In addition to New Hampshire, other states at the end of the per
capita list were: South Dakota, $655; Texas, $822; Tennessee, $823;
Utah, $832; Colorado, $875; Mississippi, $882; Alabama, $889,
Nebraska, $900, and Arkansas, $903.
   More than half of the state tax revenues were collected by just
nine states: California, $41.2 billion; New York, $26.6 billion;
Texas, $14 billion; Pennsylvania, $12.6 billion; Florida, $12.5
billion, Illinois, $11.8 billion; Michigan, $11.1 billion; Ohio,
$10.8 billion, and New Jersey, $10.5 billion.
   As usual, general sales and gross receipts taxes were the
largest source of state taxes in 1989, up 7.3 percent to $93.4
billion. Individual income taxes gained 10.7 percent to $88.7
billion, while corporate net income taxes rose 4.8 percent to $23.9
billion.

   As Costs Grow and the Recession Curbs Revenue,
   States Are Raising Taxes to Balance Their Budgets

   WHATEVER CONGRESS DECIDES to do at the federal level this
year, taxpayers had better brace themselves: State fiscal
woes are in the headlines, and tax increases are almost sure
to follow.
   Taxpayers in Kentucky, Massachusetts and Nebraska know all
about it. As they fill out their state income tax forms for
1990, they're getting a close look at the personal impact of
last year's big tax increases -- estimated to add some $10.3
billion to state revenues.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Those increases were the largest ever in dollar amount.
But tax authorities say that unless the recession is very
shortlived, other states will be socking it to taxpayers
starting sometime in the spring.
   "At this stage of the game, we are getting a lot of
governors and legislative leaders who say they are not going
to raise taxes who are going to end up having to raise
taxes," says Hal Hovey, editor of State Budget and Tax News,
Alexandria, Va.
   The reason: The recession is taking its toll on sales
taxes and other levies, leaving the states, particularly
those in the Northeast, below their revenue estimates. This
is happening at a time when the costs of Medicaid, elementary
education and prisons are rising briskly.
   Indeed, more than half the states expect revenue to fall
short of budget projections -- 14 with shortfalls of 5% or
more, says Ronald Snell of the National Conference of State
Legislatures in Denver. The outlook for 1992 is even grimmer.
A poll by the conference shows that with only one exception
-- Wyoming -- states expect things to be worse.
   Local governments "are not in the same boat, but they are
rowing on the same waters," says Mr. Hovey. He predicts that
many local taxes will go up as well.
   Lawmakers realize that raising taxes won't be politically
easy. Indeed, in many states, increases aren't likely until
governors and legislatures have exhausted every budget
cutting possibility. Last year's election made it quite clear
that voters were in no mood for new taxes. "I think the most
important thing that happened was the close call that (U.S.
Sen.) Bill Bradley had in New Jersey," a state with big jumps
in both sales and income taxes last year, says Steven Gold,
director of the Center for the Study of States, State
University of New York, Albany.
   Tax legislation is likely to pick up with the approach of
fiscal 1992, which begins July 1 in 46 states. What type of
increases are likely?
   Income taxes are expected in some states that don't have
them. Tennessee, Connecticut and New Hampshire are the most
likely candidates, says Mr. Hovey. Texas, he adds, could be
"a sleeper." He calls Pennsylvania "an obvious place to
increase income tax," and says Vermont won't be able to
reduce its rates as scheduled and may even raise them. An
increase in New York City income tax rates is definitely "on
the agenda."
   Also predicted is the expansion of sales taxes into
services, including such things as cable TV, long-distance
phone calls, haircuts and dry cleaning. "You can broaden the
sales tax base and make the argument that you haven't raised
taxes," says Marcia Howard of the National Association of
State Budget Officers. "It is a little harder to raise income
taxes and say you didn't do it."
   The impact of such expansion can be significant. A
hypothetical family of four with an adjusted gross income of
$75,000, for example, has an annual sales tax bite of $325 in
Boston compared to $1,103 in New York City, according to
calculations by CPA firm Coopers &amp; Lybrand.
   State and local tax rates account for much of the
variation, but so do the items taxed. In Chicago, this
hypothetical family's $1,070 sales tax burden would include
$320 for clothes, $11 for groceries and $160 for gasoline
each year -- items untaxed in Boston. In New York City, the
same family would be taxed $44 for natural gas and
electricity, $33 for telephone service and $99 for domestic
help -- all untaxed in Boston.
   SUNY's Mr. Gold says governors may try to avoid altogether
the big taxes -- sales and income -- that currently account
for 63% of state tax revenue. "If the governors are really
spooked by the tax revolt, we are going to see more
nickel-and-dime increases," such as taxes on cigarettes and
alcohol, he says.
   Even the nickel-and-dime increases add up, however.
Taxpayers who have seen their federal rates drop from 50% to
31% may be unhappily surprised to realize that they are "back
up to 40% or more" once state taxes are taken into account,
says Joseph J. Nugent, director of Coopers &amp; Lybrand's state
and local tax services.
   What can the taxpayer do to minimize the bite? Not a lot,
except move, says Stuart Kessler, senior partner with
Goldstein, Golub &amp; Kessler in New York. That "probably costs
you more in the long run," he says.
   But as rates go higher, federal tax-planning techniques --
such as accelerating income in advance of a big tax hike --
start to have an impact at the state level.
   Municipal bonds, which are typically free of state income
taxes in the state where issued, may become a more important
way to invest as state taxes go higher, says Dawn McNerney,
Cohen &amp; Co. in Cleveland. "I've seen a lot more activity in
Ohio bonds than in the past," she says.
   State taxes are also becoming a big issue in retirement
planning. In Ohio, it has become an accepted rule of
financial planning that people establish Florida residency in
preparation of retirement, Ms. McNerney says. The reasons: no
income tax and lower estate taxes.
   Taxpayers can expect states to crack down on tax loopholes
and cheating. "There is no question that audits are going to
increase," says Douglas J. Green, KPMG Peat Marwick's
national director for state and local tax services. He says
state auditors will be more aggressive, looking not only at
income amounts, but also at itemized deductions.
   The hue and cry over state taxes, however, is mitigated by
the fact that they are still deductible on the federal tax
form. Yet Congress has reduced that benefit somewhat, by
imposing limits on most itemized deductions for high-income
taxpayers as part of the new tax law enacted last fall. Many
financial advisers worry that the deduction could be
eliminated entirely in the next federal budget crunch. Mr.
Kessler notes that the federal government has already done
away with the deductibility of the gas tax and the sales tax.
"Maybe," he says, "state income tax is next."

   The Bush administration's plan to raise
money by limiting deductions on local taxes could cripple the
ability of high-tax states to run schools and provide services,
opponents say.
   Taxpayers would be limited to a $10,000 deduction for state and
local income taxes under the plan, which is supported by Republican
congressional leaders.
   State officials feared the plan also might drive residents from
high-tax states to ones where income taxes are lower or
non-existent.
   ``If the state loses its income tax, which it relies on, then
you have to use the other taxes,'' Gov. Mario Cuomo said Friday.
``Or would you stop feeding the poor people?'' Cuomo, a Democrat,
was a key player in the successful 1985 fight to save deductibility.
   ``I don't think it helps the states at a time when the federal
government is bailing out of responsibilities,'' said New Jersey
Gov. Jim Florio.
   Cuomo and other officials say a loss of deductibility would put
pressure on them to reduce state and local income taxes at a time
when they are already hurting for tax revenue.
   A loss of deductibility would magnify every state and local
income tax increase for upper-income taxpayers because they would
lose the ability to deduct those taxes on their federal returns.
That, say critics of the plan, amounts to double taxation.
   Edward Farrell, executive director of the New York State
Conference of Mayors, said the practical effect would be states and
localities turning to more regressive taxes, such as sales or
property taxes.
   But those taxes are harder to increase, largely because of the
potential for taxpayer revolts. That means towns and cities might
be forced to sacrifice police, firefighters or other services, he
said.
   Poor school districts in New York, which rely heavily on state
income tax revenue, would ``find it impossible to maintain their
education,'' predicted Board of Regents Chancellor Martin Barell.
   Restrictions also could encourage residents of high-tax states
to move, thus decreasing the tax base, said Chris Zimmerman, chief
economist at the National Conference of State Legislatures.
   ``A rich person in New York would get hit, but a rich person in
Texas wouldn't,'' he said. ``People don't migrate to Canada or
Mexico because the tax rate went up, but they might go to
Connecticut.''
   Connecticut has no income tax and Texas has no state income tax,
but some local income tax.

   Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota toured his state in a twin-engine airplane last week, promoting a new and sweeping plan for overhauling the state's tax system. 

   "Passage of the federal tax-reform act has provided a window of opportunity that we must not close," the Democratic governor said. 
Key state legislators were quick to applaud the outlines of the tax plan, and by the end of the week, many were predicting legislation would be enacted by summer. 
"We've got a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here," says Gerry Nelson, the governor's communications director. 

   Minnesota isn't alone. 
Prompted by last year's overhaul of the federal tax system, dozens of other states are being forced to consider radical revisions of their own tax codes. 
But unlike the federal tax-overhaul effort, which left the distribution of the tax burden among income groups largely unchanged, the state efforts will probably place more of the tax burden on those at the top of the income scale. 

   "The fight is far from over," says Robert McIntyre, director of federal tax policy for Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-backed group. 
"But my impression is that states are moving toward making their tax systems more progressive." 

   The majority of state income tax systems are closely linked to the federal tax system, and in most cases, the new tax law would cause state tax revenues to rise considerably. 
That is prompting hot debates in state capitals across the country over how much of that revenue windfall should be returned to taxpayers, and in what form. 

   Currently, state taxes are notably unprogressive. 
Many states rely heavily on sales taxes to raise revenue, placing an inordinate burden on the poor, who spend nearly all their income. 
And a combination of relatively flat tax rates and ample tax breaks at the state level enables high-income taxpayers to pay relatively little in taxes. 

   A recent study by Mr. McIntyre's group, for instance, found that in 15 states the richest taxpayers -- those with incomes of more than $500,000 a year -- paid an average tax rate that's less than half that paid by the poorest 20%. 
"If you thought the old federal tax system was bad," says Bruce Fisher, research director at Citizens for Tax Justice, "take a look at what's going on in the states." 

   During the past decade, many states have moved away from progressive taxation, hoping that lower rates on high-income executives would help lure new businesses. 
"The heydey for progressive state taxes was in the 1960s," explains Steven Gold, director of fiscal studies for the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
"Since then, progressivity hasn't been a big topic in the states. 
Instead, they've been concerned about tax competition" with other states. 

   This year, however, that trend seems likely to be reversed as a result of the pressures put on states by the tax bill President Reagan signed last year. 

   About 30 states have broad-based income taxes that are based on the measures of adjusted gross income or taxable income used in the federal tax form. 
Last year's tax-overhaul bill wiped out many federal tax breaks, thus raising both measures of income for most upper-income Americans. 

   At the federal level, the elimination of tax breaks for the wealthy was offset by a sharp reduction in the top tax rate, to 28% from 50%. 
At the state level, however, such a sharp rate reduction is unlikely to occur, for two reasons. 
First, many states have flatter rate structures to begin with, and therefore can't afford such steep reductions at the top. 
And second, some states want to use the revenue "windfall" that results from closing tax breaks to finance their budgets, rather than to lower rates. 
As a result, taxes for the affluent are likely to rise. 

   Business groups and supply-side tax cutters are disturbed by the trend. 
"They're making a mistake," says Jeff Bell, an adviser to Republican presidential hopeful Rep. Jack Kemp of New York. 
"Governors and state legislators don't understand how dynamic these tax effects are." 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has sent out material to its state and local affiliates, urging them to lobby for lower top tax rates and retention of tax breaks for capital-gains income. 

   Such efforts, however, are going against a powerful tide. 
Ohio's new tax plan illustrates the point. 
Signed into law last November, it cuts tax rates for the average Ohioan 8%, and provides an especially generous 14% rate cut for those at the top of the income scale, according to Ohio Tax Commissioner Joanne Limbach. 
Nevertheless, wealthy residents of Ohio will pay more taxes under the new law because they lose lucrative write-offs for tax shelters and capital gains. 

   Gov. Perpich's plan would have a similar result. 
He wants to use his state's revenue windfall to pay for dropping the top rate to 8% from 14%. 
Nevertheless, high-income Minnesotans would, on average, face bigger tax bills. 
They'd lose not only the tax breaks eliminated under the new federal law, but also the state deduction for federal income taxes. 
"The plan would make the income tax much more progressive," says Wayne Cox, coordinator of the Minnesota branch of Citizens for Tax Justice. 

   To be sure, some state officials and lobbyists are still struggling to keep new tax laws from increasing the tax bite on the affluent. 
In Wisconsin and Connecticut, for instance, business groups are launching major campaigns to retain the tax benefit for capital-gains income, which mainly benefits the wealthy. 
And in Iowa, Republican Gov. Terry Branstad has proposed to cut the top individual tax rate more than half, to 6% from 13%. 
That would result in a big tax cut for upper-income Iowans, even though they already face a far lower tax burden than the poor and middle-income residents of the state, according to Mr. McIntyre's study. 

   But Democratic legislators are balking at Gov. Branstad's plan, and Charles Bruner, chairman of state senate's tax committee, says a top rate of 9% may be more pleasing to the legislature. 
"I'm optimistic" that the final tax bill will improve the tax system's progressiveness, says Mark Smith, secretary-treasurer of the Iowa AFL-CIO. 

   Minnesota tax officials believe that while their plan will increase the tax bite on the wealthy, it will also make the state look like a more attractive site to new businesses. 
That's because most published comparisons of state tax systems simply look at tax rates, not at tax breaks. 
By dropping its top rate to 8% from 14%, says one state official, Minnesota will fall from fifth place on the list of high tax states to 20th.

   Progressives love an income tax, especially a steeply
graduated one, regardless of how much revenue it brings in.
The fiscal reckoning being played out in statehouses around
the nation in recent weeks has given a boost to the levelers
that they didn't enjoy during the Opportunity Decade of the
1980s.
   Increases in the tax rates on income are on the way in
Minnesota and probably in California. New Jersey, of course,
got an early start with Jim Florio's uproarious package last
year; so did Kentucky. But 10 states have somehow avoided a
levy on wages and salaries all these years, and so they're
getting a lot of attention now in the running debate over
taxes and growth.

   In Connecticut, Lowell Weicker brought home the fervor for
grand government that was one of the hallmarks of his salad
days in the nation's capital. He wants a billion-dollar tax
boost, keyed to an income tax. Some folks there would instead
raise the state's sales tax (already the nation's highest)
still more. Big Business has bought Gov. Weicker's line about
cutting its tax in return for an income tax, as have some
investors who pay a 14% rate on "unearned income." Both these
camps may find themselves with an earnings tax and little
relief on the side.
   A similar situation in Tennessee was headed off when the
legislature quashed Gov. Ned McWherter's income-tax scheme
and told him to cut the budget instead. He did. But a court
order to equalize school financing (a familiar story) may be
looming, and this could restart the governor's campaign in
time for a fall special session. In any event, Tennesseans
can count the absence of an income tax as one reason their
state expenditure problem isn't as bad as Kentucky's next
door.
   Comparisons between adjoining states can be good
indicators of what a difference freedom from an income tax
makes. South Dakota, for example, enjoys a much lighter
government burden than North Dakota. New Hampshire is
famously less fettered than Vermont. Texas and Florida are
the only big states with relatively small public sectors,
though that may change as both could see special legislative
sessions later this year to consider income taxes.
   The James Madison Institute in Tallahassee, Fla., studied
what happened in the eight states that added income levies
between 1969 and 1976. It found that in all but one,
government growth rates jumped up when the tax was imposed
and remain above their pre-tax trend line today. The sole
exception is Pennsylvania, which is also the only one of the
group to have lowered, rather than raised, the rate at which
the tax was first imposed.
   The fact that a tax is difficult to get rid of once
established, and tends to increase in severity, leads David
Keating, an official of the National Taxpayers Union, to urge
that it be resisted at the outset, no matter how dire a
state's "temporary" fiscal crisis may be. Referendums, where
they are allowed, are a quick way to undo a scheme that can't
be stopped in the legislature.
   As we've noted before, there's evidence that many
Americans still vote with their feet on tax policy -- with
migration flowing away from income-tax progressivism and
toward the greater opportunity seen in low-income-tax states.
While restless feet may always remain the ultimate voting
device, it would save wear and tear on millions of folks if
the politicians in the states could just keep the tax ground
from shifting beneath them.

   The Tax Reform Act of 1986 cut personal income tax rates
and broadened the definition of taxable income. Not
surprisingly, the U.S. Treasury netted more revenue after tax
reform than before, because lower personal tax rates
stimulated economic activity.
   Many state governments followed suit, and lowered state
income tax rates to avoid reaping windfalls from the expanded
income tax base. According to the National Conference of
State Legislatures, 11 states purposely avoided grabbing any
windfall from the tax reform of 1986. Thirteen kept the
entire windfall. Ten states kept some portion. Nine other
states simply had no broad-based income tax to begin with;
and seven states did not recognize any windfall, even though
their tax codes levy broad-based taxes on income.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   How have these states fared? The latest decennial census
has been released and the impact of relative population
growth on political clout is telling. The 13 states that
chose to keep the entire tax-reform windfall -- Alabama,
Arkansas, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North Carolina
and Utah -- will lose a net four electoral votes between the
1984 and 1992 presidential elections.
   By contrast, the 11 states that opted to leave the whole
gain to their taxpayers -- California, Connecticut, Georgia,
Hawaii, Maine, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Virginia, West
Virginia and Wisconsin -- will gain three electoral votes.
   The 10 states that kept part of the windfall -- Arizona,
Colorado, Delaware, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland,
Michigan, Oklahoma and Oregon -- will lose four electoral
votes.
   In total, states that kept either all or a portion of the
windfall from 1986 tax reform will lose eight electoral
votes, whereas the states returning windfalls to their
taxpayers will have gained three electoral votes. This is a
swing of 11 electoral votes for the next national electionan
often critical margin in presidential voting.
   Even more significant from the standpoint of revealing
relative economic-growth philosophies of the states is the
fact that the nine states that do not impose any broad-based
income taxes -- Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South
Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming -- will have
gained eight electoral votes in only 10 years.
   Do tax rates and their effects on incentives, wealth
creation and population growth matter? Those who cannot count
the dollars might count the votes.

   High-income taxpayers who find they owe more, not less, to Uncle Sam this year are likely to get a similar headache when they complete their state returns. 

   The spillover from federal tax-law changes and some state tax revisions have combined to increase the share of state income taxes paid by the affluent. 
Among other things, some high-income taxpayers have been dismayed to find that state levies on long-term capital gains generally rose by a greater percentage than the federal tax on those gains. 

   Nationwide, a mix of cuts and increases is producing a slight rise in the total state income taxes due on 1987 individual returns, says Steven D. Gold, state-tax specialist at the National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver. 
But he adds, "On average, high-income returns will have increases, while low-income returns will have decreases. . . . 
I would think that the average return with income over $100,000 would have a 10% or more increase." 

   The impact of the state tax changes can vary widely at different income levels. 
For instance, in California, which passed a major tax overhaul last fall, officials estimate that a family of three with $100,000 of income and usual itemized deductions will see their state tax bill rise 18%, to $5,832 from $4,944. 
In contrast, the state tax bill for a family of four with $35,000 of income and usual itemized deductions will fall 18%, to $471 from $571. 

   Even in states such as New York that adopted tax cuts, some high-income residents will be disappointed. 
Douglas J. Green, state-tax specialist with accountant Peat Marwick Main &amp; Co., says some highincome New Yorkers "come in and say, 'My tax bill is going to go down.' 
But that's just not true." 
As New York taxable income for 1987 climbs toward $100,000, Mr. Green says, "calculations are going to show there will be little or no savings -- and maybe an increase." 

   The main reason that state taxes have increased for many affluent individuals is that more than 30 states "piggyback" on the federal government's definition of taxable income. 
Federal changes -- including restrictions on tax-shelter write-offs, limitations on interest deductions, and the end of the partial exclusion for long-term capital gains -- are substantially increasing some people's taxable income for state as well as federal purposes. 

   A number of states also followed the federal lead in cutting tax rates. 
But, unlike the federal government, the states generally didn't provide larger rate cuts for high-income people, who are most affected by the measures that increased taxable income. 
Instead, many states that faced a potential windfall from the broadened definition of taxable income targeted relief measures toward low-income families, by raising the standard deduction, for instance. 

   In a few states, high earners are finding that even though they now face a lower top rate in state taxes, they've lost a valuable tax benefit: the itemized deduction on state returns for federal taxes paid. 
Colorado, Minnesota and Utah eliminated that deduction altogether. 
And Oregon cut it to a maximum $3,000, from $7,000. 
"We may have some people complaining about that," says James Scherzinger, Oregon's legislative revenue officer. 

   Meanwhile, some high-income taxpayers have been dismayed to see steep increases in state tax rates on capital gains. 
These occurred as most states followed the federal government's lead in eliminating the 60% exclusion from tax for long-term gains. 
Even in some states that cut their overall tax rates, the effective state levy on capital gains more than doubled. 

   In Minnesota, for example, the top rate on capital gains used to be just under 4%: 40% of the top tax rate of 9.9%. 
This year, capital gains will be subject to the new maximum rate on ordinary income of 9%, which will drop to 8% in 1988. 

   For affluent individuals, the percentage increase in the federal capital-gains tax is smaller than the increase in the state tax. 
That's because the top federal tax rate was cut more sharply -- to 33% in 1988 from 50% in 1986 -- and because federal capital-gains taxes are capped at 28% for 1987 as the new rates are phased in. 

   Mr. Gold says six states -- Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland and Wisconsin -- didn't follow the federal example and instead retained preferential treatment for capital gains. 

   As at the federal level, changes in state tax rules have engendered much confusion. 
In New York, state tax officials say calls from consumers are already running at a heavy, April-like pace. 
Many upper-income filers, for instance, are complaining that they haven't received the much-hated maximum-tax form. 
And they won't receive it -- the form was eliminated under New York's 1987 tax act. 

   There's confusion even in the many states that moved to simplify their tax codes by making them closer to the federal model. 
That simplification actually has made it more difficult to file 1987 returns, says Mr. Green of Peat Marwick Main, because "you can't follow what you did the past year." 
Pat Hamel, a senior manager with accountant Price Waterhouse in New York, concurs: "For state taxes, as with the federal, this tax filing season is going to be a nightmare for many people." 

   A final, discouraging word on state taxes comes from Julian Block, a tax specialist with Prentice-Hall Information Services in Paramus, N.J.: Although state income taxes continue to be deductible on federal returns, the lower federal tax rates make that deduction less valuable. 
So, he says, "the after-tax cost to a person of his or her state income taxes is going to be higher."

   Four Northeastern states, facing huge budget deficits, all
greet the New Year bogged down in partisan battles over tax
and budget policies.
   Legislators and governors in New York, New Jersey,
Connecticut and Pennsylvania will have to decide on rollbacks
of newly instituted taxes or -- in New York's case --
implement a new budget.

   Tax increases were relatively easy in the 1980s, when
economies were growing and there was enthusiasm for more
government spending. From 1980 to 1989, spending in the four
states rose 116%, says Stephen Moore, an economist at the
Cato Institute, a Washington think tank.
   But the recession has slowed tax revenues, and tax
resistance is in vogue. "What you're seeing is an increasing
recognition by state governments that maybe they went a bit
too far in the '80s," says Mr. Moore. Whatever the
perception, the pain in the Northeast is growing more acute.
                                                                                                       

   NEW JERSEY
                                                                                                       

   Angry New Jerseyans swept out many Democrats and gave
Republicans veto-proof majorities in both the Assembly and
the Senate in November, culminating a major backlash against
a $2.8 billion tax hike imposed a year and a half ago.
Marches on the state Capitol, radio talkshow denunciations of
Democratic Gov. Jim Florio and the outgoing
Democratic-controlled Legislature and election-year attacks
from Republicans have made believers out of New Jersey
Democrats.
   If voters want tax cuts, the Democrats decided, they'll
get them. The lame-duck New Jersey Senate, still controlled
by Democrats until Jan. 14, voted Dec. 18 to roll back $2.8
billion in taxes on personal income, sales, gasoline, alcohol
and cigarettes. The levies were originally put in place to
provide property tax rebates, fund poorer school districts
and close a budget deficit.
   In the Assembly, however, Republicans caucused at a nearby
restaurant and kept the lower house in Trenton from seating a
quorum; it has adjourned until Jan. 6. The Republicans'
strategy was, first, to avoid being locked into lame-duck
measures and, second, to avoid tax cuts without program cuts
to go along with them. Assembly Democrats say they are
confident of securing a quorum in the new year and expect to
force a vote in the lower house on tax repeal.
   The rollback would take the form of a "sunset" provision
canceling most of the tax increases after June 30, when the
next fiscal year's budget takes effect. Higher income tax
rates would be cut back on Jan. 1, 1993. The idea is to make
the Republicans take the heat for any new taxes or budget
cuts that then have to be imposed.
   So far, all the about-to-be majority has promised is a cut
in the sales tax to 6% from 7%, a $550 million rollback. A
total rollback of the tax package "from a policy point of
view makes no sense," says former New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean,
an adviser to the Republicans. "You can't sunset the money
without sunsetting the programs. You can't repeal the money
without repealing the programs. They need to repeal both."
   Sen. John Lynch, the outgoing majority leader, says
Democrats have learned from their mistakes. "We need to bring
the people into the process -- that was our mistake last
time."
   Gov. Florio has avoided a firm commitment on the proposals
but is promising to keep an open mind.
                                                                                                       

   CONNECTICUT
                                                                                                       

   Perhaps no governor has taken more personal abuse than
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, who forced the
Legislature to adopt the state's first income tax this year
after a 53-day stalemate and three vetoed budgets.
   Public response was enormous and heated. Perhaps 40,000
people converged on the state Capitol in Hartford in October
to protest.
   The Legislature responded by meeting in special session in
November to repeal the 4.5% income tax. The repeal measure,
passed by 83-65 in the House and 21-15 in the Senate, sought
to end the income tax and to raise the sales tax to 8.25%
from 6%. But the governor, who ran as an independent, vetoed
the proposal, and the House couldn't muster the votes to
override.
   The Legislature adjourned until February in the face of
more bad news -- an expected $173 million deficit for the
current fiscal year and a forecast $930 million shortfall in
the next. The state does expect more money from the federal
government for medical payments for poor state residents, but
even with this extra money, the deficit is projected at
$834.6 million.
   Mr. Weicker insisted on the income tax, arguing that the
state's high sales tax and corporate taxes were damaging the
business climate. But some legislators are angry that even
with the new tax, the budget isn't in balance.
   "The obvious question is: Have we discovered what New
York, New Jersey and California have discovered, that an
income tax doesn't solve a deficit?" says Rep. Reginald L.
Jones, one of the Republican architects of repeal. "We must
cut hundreds of million of dollars from our budget."
                                                                                                       

   NEW YORK
                                                                                                       

   The state's prolonged budget stalemate on Dec. 20 was the
reason Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo gave for not entering the
1992 presidential race, and the Legislature continues to try
to draw up a short-term budget while negotiating a
longer-term accord.
   Renewed negotiations began last week on closing an $875
million projected deficit in this year's budget and coping
with a staggering $3.5 billion shortfall for fiscal 1993.
Local school district aid, a sensitive subject with suburban
lawmakers, is a particular sticking point. Aid was cut by
$190 million a year ago and by a further $531 million in
July.
   Until a few weeks ago, Mr. Cuomo was proposing to make an
additional $256 million cut in school aid, as well as a $600
million cut for next year. But the governor then backed off
on the additional cut for this year, citing a $300 million
windfall from the federal government to pay for welfare
recipients' medical care, and he proposes to cut next year's
budget by only $300 million instead.
   Newly elected state Assembly leader Saul Welprin, a
Democrat, and Sen. Ralph J. Marino, Senate Republican
majority leader, have joined in opposing large cuts in school
aid. Sen. Marino has come up with his own 15-month plan,
which concentrates on cuts in welfare and avoids cuts in
school aid and taxes.
   The Assembly, though, did pass Cuomo-backed legislation to
close this year's deficits, but the plan was rejected by the
Republican-controlled Senate Finance Committee. Sen. Marino
contends that the Assembly plan would have covered only 72%
of this year's budget gap, relied on one-shot revenue
"gimmicks," and didn't deal with next year's looming deficit.
   In an "extraordinary" special session called last Friday,
Mr. Cuomo presented his plan again, and again the Senate
Finance Committee struck down the plan. The governor also
offered up his own 15-month plan, which was tabled by the
committee. The legislators worked through the weekend,
without much progress.
                                                                                                       

   PENNSYLVANIA
                                                                                                       

   Gov. Robert P. Casey signed the largest tax increase --
$3.5 billion -- in Pennsylvania's history in August,
featuring an increased personal income tax, expanded sales
taxes, higher corporate taxes and other increased levies.
This month, the Legislature pushed through a $49 million
rollback of professional services and sales taxes, partly at
the urging of business.
   Another effort at tax-cutting is expected when the
Legislature reconvenes in January, although the Democratic
governor has vowed to veto any new tax-cutting measure,
insisting it would put the budget into deficit.
   But with the state's economy slumping, pressure will be
hard to resist. "The business community is upset because they
took a big hit" in the last round of increases, says Rep.
Matthew Ryan, House Republican minority leader.
   The Commonwealth Foundation, a think tank based in
Harrisburg, the state capital, calculates that Pennsylvania
has the highest corporate net tax rate in the nation at
12.25%, including a tax on dividends and elimination of
tax-loss carry-forwards.
   The Legislature, which has adjourned until late January,
"has about 10 to 15 bills to roll back taxes," said Mr. Ryan.
"A lot of people are mad, and deservedly so. My Republican
members are angry at the governor, and the people are upset
with all of us."

<LEADPARA>  California's richest residents grew considerably richer in the last decade
while their combined state and federal tax rates are lower than they were in
1980, according to a study by the state's Franchise Tax Board.;    According
to the study, the richest of the rich -- the top 1 percent of the state's
taxpayers -- saw their annual incomes soar more than 75 percent from 1980 to
1988, yet their state income taxes rose by only 4.1 percent and their federal
taxes went down more than 14 percent.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Front  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  STATE'S RICH MUCH RICHER, STUDY SHOWS  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Additional information attached to the end of this article.;  SETTING THE
RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 5/4/91, pg. 2A);  The Mercury News reported April 19
that state taxes for the rich increased only 4.1 percent from 1980 to 1988.
The 4.1 percent figure pertained to the increase in the tax rate itself.
Because their incomes increased 75 percent, tax dollars paid by the wealthiest
residents increased 84 percent.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In inflation-adjusted dollars, their annual incomes went from $289,533 to
$508,743. For nearly everyone else, income either dropped or remained
virtually unchanged.;    The report, compiled from millions of California tax
returns, provides fresh ammunition for Democrats pressuring Gov. Pete Wilson
to accept a tax increase on the rich to help balance the state's busted
budget, now an estimated $13 billion in the red.;    The study also indicates
that despite the promises of supply-side economics, which ruled state and
federal tax policy during the 1980s, wealth did not "trickle down" to the less
fortunate.;    "Both nationally and for the state of California, the 1980s
have witnessed a tremendous increase in the concentration of income," the
study said. Pre-1986 tax cuts and other breaks "produced a windfall to the
top-income taxpayers. Additionally, increases in payroll taxes during the same
time period hurt low- and middle-income taxpayers more than high- income
taxpayers," the tax board report said.;    Democrats want to increase the tax
bite from the current 9.3 percent to 11 percent, where it stood in 1987, for
single people earning over $100,000 and couples earning $200,000 or more. That
would affect about 300,000 taxpayers and bring in about $2.5 billion over the
next two years.;    Keeping businesses here;    Wilson has threatened to veto
any tax-the-rich plan, saying it would drive business out of California and
cause higher unemployment.;    "Any time you take money out of the private
sector and divert it to the public sector, you're removing capital from the
capitalistic system, the free-market system, so there's somewhat of a drag,"
state Finance Director Thomas Hayes said recently.;    Wilson maintains that
the affluent are shouldering more than their share of paying for government,
and singling them out for additional tax increases isn't fair. California's
wealthiest 3 percent now pay a third of all the personal income tax the state
collects each year.;    But the tax board study, which was quietly released to
legislative researchers last month, says that's the way California's
progressive income tax system is designed to work: The more you make, the more
you pay, on the theory that taxes should fall most heavily on those who
receive the most benefit from living here.;    Reaping the benefits;    The
study shows that since 1980, the rich have reaped California's benefits far
more than anyone else:;    (check) From 1980-'88, gross income -- salary,
dividends and other money -- went up 75.7 percent for the richest 1 percent.
For the bottom 90 percent of taxpayers, gross incomes inched up only 2.4
percent during that nine-year span.;    (check) Wages alone for the wealthy
went up 79 percent, from an average of $129,405 to $215,922. The bottom 90
percent of the population saw their inflation-adjusted paychecks shrink, from
an average of $17,057 to $17,029.;    (check) Federal tax rates on the richest
1 percent have dropped 14.4 percent since 1980. For workers in the bottom 60
percent of the income chain, federal taxes went up -- anywhere from 1.5
percent to 15 percent.;    The study also explodes the myth that taxing the
more populous middle class is the surest way of raising the most revenue for
the state. The reason: Middle-income taxpayers as a group now control less of
the state's wealth than ever.;    In 1988, for example, the top 10 percent
took home more than 41 percent of all the personal income made in California
that year.;    Poor got poorer;    That trend intensified during the 1980s,
the study found. The richest 1 percent saw their share of the state's total
income leap from 10 percent to 16 percent -- a 55.5 percent gain. But for 5.1
million lower-income taxpayers, those earning between $15,000 and $28,000 a
year, the 1980s sliced their ownership of the state's wealth anywhere from 11
percent to 14 percent.;    "The increase in (wealth) concentration . . . means
that the poor got poorer and the rich got much richer," said Jay D.
Chamberlain, the tax board analyst who co-authored the study.;    Meanwhile,
new tax loopholes enacted in 1987 and 1988 are allowing more of the wealthy to
escape paying any state taxes, said Chris Swanson of the tax board's research
bureau.;    Swanson said the number of rich people who paid no state income
taxes had been falling sharply but started shooting back up in 1987. There
were 266 taxpayers with incomes of more than $200,000 who paid no state taxes
that year. By comparison, in 1980 there were only four.;    "We're seeing the
effects here in 1989 and 1990, because tax revenues are down," Swanson said.;
THE RICHEST 1 PERCENT; (box) From 1980 to 1988, their incomes went from
$289,533 to $508,743.; (box) Their federal taxes dropped 14.4%.; (box) Their

<HL> Your Money Matters:
Municipal Bonds
Offer Investors
New Tax Plays

By Barbara Donnelly
Special to The Wall Street Journal</HL>

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<IN> TAXES
BOND MARKET NEWS (BON) </IN>
<TEXT>
   While the stock market and interest rates continue to preoccupy investors, many people may be overlooking a potentially profitable opportunity in the municipal-bond market. 

   Municipal bonds from high-tax states like Arizona, California and New York are selling for significantly less than they should relative to low-tax state issues, market professionals say. 
But that ought to change over the coming year or so, they add, as more investors recognize the bonds' increased value as tax shelters following last year's federal tax overhaul. 

   "This will cause a shift in portfolios toward these issues, and people will be willing to pay up for them," says Hugh Lamle, executive vice president at M.D. Sass Investors Services Inc., a New York investment-management firm. 
He predicts that prices on these issues could rise enough over the next year to increase investors' return by 1 1/2 percentage points. 

   Of course, there isn't any guarantee. 
Municipal bonds from high-tax states may not appreciate to reflect what analysts say is their full value to investors. 
Still, says Nancy Utterback, a municipal-bond analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., these high-tax state bonds are "definitely good value for in-state investors." 

   Normally, municipal bonds from high-tax states should be priced to give state residents a yield equivalent to what they'd get on out-of-state issues after considering tax differences. (In most states, residents don't pay tax on in-state issues, while out-of-state issues are subject to tax.) 

   In a high-tax state where investment income is taxed at 8%, for example, an investor in the old, top 50% federal tax bracket would have to earn 6.72% from a tax-exempt local issue to equal the after-tax return on a comparable out-of-state bond yielding 7%. 
Assuming that investor is in the 28% bracket under the new tax act, the "break-even yield" would be only 6.6%. 
That's because the reduction in the federal-tax rates increases the value of these bonds as shelters from state taxes. 

   The surprising thing is that in today's market, high-tax state issues are trading at yields at or above what was warranted even under the old tax law. 
Translated in terms of price, says Mr. Lamle, bonds from high-tax states are trading for $5 to $10 per $1,000 face amount more than munis from low-tax states. 
As the new federal-tax rates take effect, he says, the difference ought to be more like $20 to $30. 

   The reason, analysts say, is that the municipal-bond market simply hasn't adjusted to the Tax Reform Act of 1986. 
Investors, they explain, have failed to recognize how much cuts in federal income-tax rates are reducing the value of tax breaks the government gives on state levies. 

   Consider the impact of lower federal rates for taxpayers who face a state income-tax rate of, say, 10%. 
At the top 50% federal rate prevailing at the time of tax overhaul, the ability to deduct state income taxes on federal returns effectively reduced their state levy by half to 5% -- about a tenth of their federal taxes. 

   But at the new 28% rate, these investors will be able to deduct only 28% of their state taxes. 
In effect, their state income-tax bite will rise to 7.2% -- more than a quarter of their federal taxes. 
"People are going to know when they file, that state taxes now equal a huge share of their total taxes," says Mr. Lamle. 

   As that realization sinks in, the appeal of munis that shelter income from state taxes should rise, along with their prices. 
But, says Elizabeth Dickson, a senior analyst in municipal-bond research at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., "that adjustment hasn't shown up in the market yet."

   Connecticut may finally be getting a wage tax, but not
everybody is unhappy about it.
   Some wealthy residents who rely primarily on interest and
dividend income are likely to end up paying lower taxes
overall; shoppers will benefit because the state probably
will cut its sales tax to 6% from 8%; and business tax rates
will drop.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The budget proposal, which lawmakers say could be approved
by the Legislature as early as today, would impose a 4.5% top
tax rate on wages. Until now, Connecticut's 3.2 million
residents haven't had to pay any state taxes on wages,
although they have paid as much as 14% tax on interest and
dividend income and 7% on capital gains.
   Under the proposed new package, income from interest,
dividends and capital gains would be treated as ordinary
income and thus subject to the 4.5% maximum rate -- a break
for taxpayers who receive most of their income from those
sources.
   "It's ironic that in making the tax system more
progressive, Connecticut also is bestowing a big tax savings
on some affluent people," says Steven D. Gold, director of
the Center for the Study of the States at the Nelson A.
Rockefeller Institute of Government in Albany, N.Y.
   The tax proposal "certainly raises the basic issue of
fairness," says Richard D. Pomp, professor of law at the
University of Connecticut Law School in Hartford. "This is a
tax proposal that could have been drafted on the back of a
cocktail napkin at the Greenwich Country Club."
   The new tax, if approved, wouldn't affect all Connecticut
residents. For example, a resident who is single and has an
adjusted gross income of only $12,000 a year wouldn't be
affected, according to an aide to Gov. Lowell Weicker. The
exemption for a single head of household would be $19,000,
and it would be $24,000 for taxpayers filing jointly.
   However, the tax would take a bite out of the income of
the approximately 60,000 people who live in other states and
work in Connecticut, says Avice Meehan, the governor's press
secretary.
   Joseph F. Brennan, counsel to the Connecticut Business and
Industry Association, a 7,000-member group based in Hartford,
praised the proposed reductions in business tax and sales tax
rates. The proposal includes a two year phase-out of a 20%
surcharge on the corporate income tax. Mr. Brennan said
businesses also are encouraged by spending cuts that are
included in the proposed new budget, as well as limits on
state spending growth.
   "Having the highest corporate income tax rate in the
country and the highest state sales tax rate makes
Connecticut a difficult place for business expansion," Mr.
Brennan said. "By lowering those rates, we're hoping it will
improve our business climate" and make Connecticut "a more
attractive place to do business."
   Connecticut now is one of only 10 states with no
broad-based income tax. "Connecticut will be the first of
numerous states that will have to pass an income tax in the
1990s because of growing nationwide pressures to increase
spending, especially for health care, education and prisons,"
says Mr. Gold of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute.
   Harley T. Duncan, executive director of the Federation of
Tax Administrators, an association of state tax agencies
based in Washington, agrees. "I would not be surprised to see
three or four other states adopt a personal income tax, not
this year but certainly over the next several years," he
says. "The most likely prospects are Texas, Tennessee and New
Hampshire, and possibly also South Dakota." These states
"already are pushing the top on certain of their {existing}
taxes."
   Opposition to a statewide tax on wages has long been
intense in Connnecticut. Twenty years ago, the state enacted
a broad-based income tax, but intense protests persuaded
lawmakers to repeal it before it went into effect.
   The latest measure, if approved, would represent a
victory, although perhaps a costly one, for Connecticut's
maverick governor. Mr. Weicker, a former Republican U.S.
senator who drew nationwide attention in the 1970s for his
tough questioning of Nixon administration officials during
the Watergate hearings, was elected governor last year as an
independent.
   Many Connecticut lawmakers initially vowed opposition to a
broad-based income tax. But that opposition began to crumble
after Gov. Weicker vetoed three separate measures that didn't
include such a tax, leading to a temporary shutdown of the
state government. Several longtime foes finally reluctantly
agreed this week to support an income tax-based package.

   High-Tax States Are Low-Growth States

   The 1990 census will almost certainly show that population
-- and therefore voting power -- is continuing to shift from
the Eastern and Midwestern states to the South and West.
Americans are not just moving toward better weather. They are
escaping from high-tax states to states that let them keep
more of their money.
   The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, a
permanent bipartisan body created by Congress in 1959, has
attempted to calculate the state-by-state tax burden. The
commission arrives at its conclusions by dividing each
state's tax base by the actual taxes paid per capita. This
exercise yields an index number of "tax effort" for each
state. An index number above 100 indicates relatively heavy
exploitation of the tax base; an index number below 100
indicates relatively light exploitation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The states with the heaviest tax burdens have been losing
population to the states with the lightest. Between 1975 and
1988, New York had the heaviest tax burden in the country --
62.6% above the national average. It also will have lost more
electoral votes between 1972 and 1992 than any other state.
Florida, among the four lowest-tax states over those 13
years, had a tax burden almost 25% below the national
average. Between 1972 and 1992 it gained eight electoral
votes, more than any other state in the nation.
   Altogether, the 10 states whose relative population grew
fastest between 1970 and 1990 -- Nevada, Arizona, Alaska,
Florida, Utah, Texas, California, New Hampshire, New Mexico
and Washington (in that order) -- had a relative tax burden
nearly 12% below the U.S. average. Collectively, those 10
states will have 31 more electoral votes in 1992 than they
did in 1972.
   In contrast, the 10 states that have been losing relative
population fastest -- Iowa, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Michigan, Massachusetts, West Virginia, Illinois, North
Dakota and Indiana -- had tax efforts more than 10% above the
U.S. average. These states will together have lost 29
electoral votes since 1972.
   Taxes seem to depress employment even more than
population. The best 10 states for employment growth --
Nevada, Arizona, Florida, Alaska, New Hampshire, Washington,
Georgia, Vermont, California and Utah -- averaged 77% growth
in the number of jobs between 1974 and 1989. The worst 10 --
West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Ohio, New York,
Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, Montana and Louisiana -- averaged
just 18%. The top 10 job-producing states had a relative tax
effort 6% below the U.S. average. The worst 10 job producers
posted results 4% percent above the national average.
   These grand totals are confirmed by surveys of individual
behavior. A 1989 investigation of emigrants from Michigan in
1984 and 1985 found that 86% percent of the 39,674 tax filers
who moved to another state chose states that had discarded
their separate death or inheritance tax. Because Michigan
maintains its own death taxes, in addition to federal taxes,
a person who has been left a $1 million estate will typically
receive nearly $38,000 less than in most other states.
Michigan also imposes punitive taxation on wealth and income.
It enjoys the dubious distinction of the highest unemployment
insurance premiums of any of the nation's 15 most populous
states -- largely because it pays weekly benefits $50 higher
than the national average. This is tantamount to an
employment tax.
   The superior population and employment growth of low-tax
states is unaffected by size or region. Small low-tax states,
such as Arizona and Colorado, do just as well as big low
tax-states, such as Florida and California. Low-tax states in
the North, such as New Hampshire, do just as well as low-tax
states in the South, such as Georgia.
   If deductibility of state and local taxes is capped, as
has been suggested in Washington's budget negotiations, high
income-tax states, such as New York and Massachusetts, would
experience disproportionately great capital flight because
the effective marginal tax rate on income in those states
would escalate dramatically. The Heartland Institute in
Chicago confirms that for each 1% increase in a state's tax
effort relative to the national average, personal income
growth in that state will fall behind the U.S. average by
0.6% per year.
   Americans are voting with their feet. States that are
dreading the results of the current census can easily, then,
improve their performance on the one coming in 2000 simply by
cutting taxes.

<TEXT>     In Maine, the grinding halt of state functions snared car buyers who
couldn't get registrations and left out-of-town defendants waiting for courts
to reopen. Maine lawmakers have given themselves until Saturday to come up
with a state budget.;    Besides Maine and Connecticut, at least seven other
states -- California, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Pennsylvania
and North Carolina -- were without a spending plan Tuesday, two days into a
new fiscal year.;    Weicker, elected as an independent in November, ordered a

to me to harbor the resources of the state as best I can.";    Welfare checks
were mailed a day early in anticipation of the shutdown. But 40 state
agencies, boards and commissions were ordered shut as part of a phased-in plan
that would idle 20,000 of the state's 48,000 workers by today if no budget was
passed.;    About 300 workers rallied at the state Capitol, urging the state
Senate to follow the House's lead and pass a state income tax to head off a
deficit pegged at nearly $1 billion and mounting.;    At Hammonasset State
Park in Madison, rangers awakened campers at about 8 a.m. by announcing over
loudspeakers that everyone had to leave by sunset.;    Campers complained they
had already paid for their spaces and couldn't come back later because their
long-planned vacations would be over. Parks officials later relented, agreeing
to let campers stay until sunset today.;    "If they make us leave we're going
to pick a nice spot on the Capitol grounds and pitch a tent," said Mary
McGowan, a Rocky Hill resident.;    At the Connecticut Capitol, weary
legislators worked around the clock trying to pass a budget Weicker would
accept. But the Senate, by a 23-12 vote, on Tuesday defeated the income tax
plan that Weicker and the House supports.;    Weicker's critics blamed him,
pointing out that he has vetoed two budgets and refuses to sign a continuing
resolution that would keep the government operating.;    Weicker maintained
his decision was based on legal and fiscal considerations and was not an
attempt to pressure the Legislature.  </TEXT>

   Connecticut's Gov. Weicker Aspires to Initiate
   An Income Tax and Revels in the Sound and Fury

   CROMWELL, Conn. -- Gov. Lowell Weicker seems a trifle
disappointed by the reception he has just received from the
Middlesex County Chamber of Commerce.
   Any other politician might be pleased to get a standing
ovation for defending one of the most unpopular proposals
imaginable: imposing an income tax on a state that has spent
215 years without one.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But the veteran maverick is a little nonplussed at the
warm reception. Sure, some elements in the business community
have em- braced the contro- versial plan. But the governor
glories much more in the tax's opponents, who include the
chairmen of both the Democratic and Republican parties -- he
observes brightly that they have "blasted the {expletive} out
of the plan and the governor" -- and most of the state's
voters.
   Hockey fans jeer Mr. Weicker, disc jockeys taunt him and
the governor himself, elected as an independent last year,
hints darkly that he may no longer be "a viable product at
election time." Most politicians would recoil at such a
reception, but the pugilistic Mr. Weicker seems to revel in
being reviled. "When you hand out tough doses of medicine,"
he says proudly, "you usually don't get handed roses for it."
   Connecticut is one of only 10 states that get by without
an income tax. Yankee thrift, many in Connecticut believe,
keeps state spending in check and makes places like Stamford,
Greenwich and Darien attractive to wealthy corporations and
individuals fleeing New York City. Per capita income is
higher in Connecticut than in any other state.
   But Connecticut and other states around the country are
suffering their worst budget shortfalls in nearly a decade,
thanks to recession-lowered tax receipts and a host of
spending commitments mandated by Congress, the courts and
their own Legislatures. Nearly all these states are
prohibited from running a deficit. The result: Officials in
several income-tax-free states are thinking the politically
unthinkable.
   In Texas, Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, a Democrat, has suggested
an income-tax plan that he concedes has led to "a good bit of
adverse reaction." Gov. Ann Richards has thus far declined to
endorse the proposal, saying she will reserve judgment until
she receives a report on state spending this summer.
Meanwhile, in Tennessee, Democratic Gov. Ned McWherter has
proposed an income tax in order to pay for a new education
initiative. Spokesman Ken Renner says that the reaction has
been "negative" from "a very vocal minority," adding that the
governor won't push actively for the tax until after the
education bill clears the Legislature.
   No state has dared initiate an income tax since 1976, when
New Jersey took the plunge. But the financial demands of
modern state government inevitably compel those states
without an income tax to jack up already-regressive sales
taxes to record levels. "As the spending pressures rise,"
explains Steven Gold, a state tax expert at the Albany,
N.Y.,'s Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, "you
reach a breaking point because you can only push {other} tax
rates up so high."
   Connecticut's current 8% sales tax on both goods and
services is the highest in the country, yet the state still
faces a current fiscal shortfall of $2.4 billion. Gov.
Weicker's budget plan would eliminate the deficit through
equal packages of spending cuts and taxes, including the new
flat-rate tax of 6% on all income above $12,500 for single
filers and $25,000 for joint filers. Meanwhile, the sales tax
would be reduced to 4.15% and extended to some new items,
such as clothing and gasoline.
   Gov. Weicker, who in the 1990 campaign stated in a
television spot that he didn't support an income tax, now is
waging a passionate campaign for it. He invokes the memories
of Connecticut patriot Nathan Hale and the men and women who
fought Saddam Hussein as he seeks to persuade legislators to
pass the plan. Given the state's budget crisis, Mr. Weicker
says the income tax option is a "no-brainer," and invites his
opponents to offer a practical alternative.
   It isn't an easy sell. A recent Hartford Courant poll
showed a majority of Connecticut voters oppose the idea,
while the proportion judging Gov. Weicker's performance as
"fair" or "poor" jumped from 24% to 54%. Appearing at a
recent Hartford Whalers hockey game, the governor was booed
by the fans. (Mr. Weicker, whose budget plan also calls for
some layoffs, notes in his defense that it was State
Employees Night.)
   In the Democratic-controlled state Legislature,
Republicans are especially hostile to the plan. "I don't
think we need an income tax," says Senate Republican leader
Adela Eads. "It's a license to spend." The Democratic
leadership, meanwhile, is remaining noncommital, in part out
of fear that the issue will be used against the party in
1992. Both parties are keenly aware of the political calamity
that resulted when the Legislature, facing a similar budget
crisis in 1971, passed an income tax: Voter outrage led to
its repeal two months later.
   But Gov. Weicker, a sort of Happy Pariah, doesn't seem to
care. "He enjoys being extremely assertive," explains
Democratic Rep. Irving Stolberg, "and that's fine, because in
this case he happens to be right, as he was in Watergate,"
alluding to Mr. Weicker's spirited attacks against the Nixon
administration as a member of the Senate Watergate committee.
(Mr. Weicker, then a Republican, was defeated for re-election
to the Senate in 1988.)
   Gov. Weicker argues that his current status as a political
independent, seemingly a disadvantage because it gives him no
party chits to call in, is actually an asset because it
allows him to act as a lightning rod.
   The strategy just might work. Republicans have yet to
offer an alternative to the proposal, while Democrats on the
joint House-Senate finance committee have put forth a sales
tax expansion that even they show little enthusiasm for. And
while middle-income taxpayers are still judged likely to
oppose the Weicker plan, businesses may end up supporting it
because of the sales tax reduction and because the Weicker
plan would also reduce the state's corporate tax. The
Connecticut Business and Industry Association, an influential
pro-business group, yesterday said it would support the
Weicker proposal if it is accompanied by long-term limits on
state spending.
   Another constituency wooed by the Weicker proposal is
moderate Republican "coupon-clippers" living off capital
gains, interest and dividends income, which would be taxed at
a substantially lower rate under Gov. Weicker's budget. (Gov.
Weicker, himself a Greenwich native and heir to the Squibb
pharmaceutical fortune, says the current taxes on investments
are driving the state's rich to Florida.) Because Connecticut
would credit income tax payments to other states, the roughly
60,000 largely affluent people who commute each day into New
York would also be likely winners, paying little or no income
tax in Connecticut while benefiting from the reduction in
other state taxes.
   In fact, Gov. Weicker's plan is so generous to business
and the rich that a few tax experts question whether the
proposal is truly progressive. "There should be a testimonial
at the Greenwich country club for Weicker," quips University
of Connecticut professor Richard Pomp. Supporters of the
plan, though, argue that the income tax is of greater benefit
to the poor, because it starts from a high threshold.
   Meanwhile, the laurels are slow in coming for Gov.
Weicker, who is resigned to pay whatever political price is
required. If he lost a 1994 re-election bid, he contends, "it
wouldn't make any difference. . . . That die was cast a long
time ago in my career. I'm just interested in the end
result."

Gov. Ann Richards convened a special session of the Legislature and urged
approval of a state lottery to help bridge a budget gap.;    "It is the rarest
of creatures; a popular way to generate revenue," Richards said.;    Texas
lawmakers face a $4.8 billion deficit on an an estimated $57 billion budget
that would continue the current level of services for 1992-93.;    Unlike
their counterparts in some other states, the Texas legislators aren't late yet
-- the current budget doesn't expire until September. Most states are on a
July-to-June budget cycle.;    In Maine, about 10,000 state workers have been
idled for all but three days since July 1. Only 3,000 workers providing
services deemed essential, such as prison guards and mental hospital workers,
have remained on duty during the shutdown.;    McKernan and his Republican
allies in the Legislature have refused to approve a two-year budget without a
bill to cut one-third of the costs of Maine's $500 million workers'
compensation system.;    In Connecticut, the Senate again rejected an income
tax pushed by independent Gov. Lowell Weicker, and legislators in the House
said they had little choice but to push to override the governor's veto and
put into law a no-income tax budget.;    "We're at an impasse, that's for
sure," said Senate President Pro Tem John Larson. Weicker, elected last year
as an independent, scheduled a statewide speech for this evening; legislative
leaders from both parties promptly sought equal time.;    About 75
Pennsylvania state workers began the second week of daily rallies after a
weekend break at the Capitol in Harrisburg, where legislators are deadlocked
in their budget talks. The state is expected to skip paychecks this week to
53,000 workers.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Connecticut's governor stepped up the pressure on the Legislature to enact an
income tax today by ordering a shutdown of non-essential services. State

<TEXT>     Pressed by the recession to make difficult and politically painful choices,
Connecticut became the second state in as many days to order such a shutdown
for lack of a budget. Maine's governor did the same on Monday.;    Besides
Maine and Connecticut, at least seven other states -- California, Illinois,
Ohio, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Pennsylvania and North Carolina -- were
without a spending plan two days into a new fiscal year.;    Illinois was
under court order to distribute welfare checks anyway.;    Nevada, New Jersey,
Washington state and New York City agreed on budgets within minutes of their
Sunday deadlines.;    Under Connecticut's shutdown, 7,000 non-essential
employees -- or about 14 percent of the workforce -- were furloughed today,
Weicker said. The number will grow to 20,000 -- or about 41 percent of the
workforce -- by Wednesday.;    The shutdown will force the closing of parks
and beaches already jammed as the Fourth of July approaches. Employees were
affected at dozens of agencies, including those regulating banking, labor and
insurance.;    At least one state employee union planned to file suit in
Hartford Superior Court today to halt the shutdown.;    "We can't afford to
have our members go one, two, or three days without salary," said Steve
Perruccio, president of the 7,000-member Connecticut Employees Union
Independent, the union of janitors and maintenance workers. "Our members live
paycheck to paycheck.";    The governor had given the Legislature until
midnight Monday -- 24 hours after the fiscal year began -- to adopt a spending
plan that included an income tax. Weicker, who won office last year as an
independent, has argued that only an income tax can solve the state's budget
woes.;    About 300 state workers rallied outside the Capitol today.;   
States and cities often have trouble making bottom-line revenues and
expenditures match. But it has been particularly tough this year.;    Hit hard
by the recession, governments are being forced to make agonizing and
politically dangerous choices about layoffs, welfare cuts and higher taxes.;  
 (check) New York City balanced its $28.5 billion budget by making $1.7
billion in cuts that included 10,000 layoffs and cutbacks in the police
department. It also raised income taxes 14 percent and increased property
taxes.;    (check) New Jersey enacted a $14.7 billion budget that included up
to 2,300 layoffs and the sale of part of Interstate 95.;    In Illinois, a
federal judge Monday ordered the state to distribute welfare checks even
though no money has been appropriated for them. Gov. Jim Edgar had said he
wouldn't authorize the checks until he was given an acceptable budget.;   
Maine Gov. John R. McKernan declared an emergency Monday after the Legislature
failed to pass a budget. About 2,000 employees remained at work in jobs that
protect public health and safety. But more than 10,000 others were told to
stay home.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Maine's failure to enact a spending plan forced a shutdown of non-essential
state services today, and a similar closure loomed in Connecticut as budget

<TEXT>     New Jersey adopted a budget just before the midnight deadline, as did
Washington state. New York City reached agreement on a spending plan in time
to avert a takeover by a financial board created during the fiscal crisis of
the 1970s.;    Legislators were forced by the recession to make tough choices
-- including tax increases, thousands of layoffs and painful spending cuts --
to close budget gaps.;    New York Mayor David Dinkins said the budget
agreement reached in his city "reflects a lot more pain and a lot less gain
than any of us would like.";    "It reflects our city's enormous fiscal
constraints and the lingering recession that continues to hold our city -- and
our nation -- hostage," he said.;    In Maine, Gov. John R. McKernan declared
an emergency, ordering 2,000 employees to report to work at jobs involving
health and safety. More than 10,000 others were told to stay home while the
Legislature wrangled over a budget.;    "We hope this impasse is going to be
resolved as quickly as possible," McKernan said.;    Connecticut Gov. Lowell
Weicker vetoed a budget passed by the Legislature but delayed a similar
shutdown by 24 hours. The Legislature was given until midnight tonight to
approve an acceptable budget.;    "We will not have a series of one-day
delays. This is it," he said. Weicker has warned that he will furlough about
7,000 employees if lawmakers don't approve a spending plan he likes.;   
Lawmakers over the weekend rejected Weicker's proposal to enact a state income
tax, approving a budget that relied instead on sales taxes on a variety of
previously untaxed services, including haircuts, taxis and dry cleaning.;   
There were no other immediate threats of government shutdowns in states that
failed to adopt budgets.;    New Jersey legislators passed a budget, and Gov.
Jim Florio signed it just six minutes before the midnight deadline. The $14.7
billion spending plan calls for no new taxes but could force the layoffs of up
to 2,300 workers.;    In New York, Dinkins and city council leaders agreed on
a $28.7 billion budget that calls for most of the $1.5 billion in service cuts
Dinkins proposed, including 10,000 layoffs. It also will cost the average
homeowner about $143 in additional real estate taxes.;    If a balanced budget
had not been submitted by midnight, the state Financial Control Board could
have been called in to manage the city's finances.;    In Pennsylvania,
legislators abandoned their marathon session shortly before 9 p.m. and
conceded their budget would be late. Before recessing, the Senate approved a
stopgap budget to keep money flowing for welfare and interest payments.;   
With no budget in place, $250 million for schools and paychecks for 10,000
employees will be held up July 5. State offices, though, were to remain open.;
   Washington Gov. Booth Gardner signed a $15.7 billion budget a half-hour
before the midnight deadline. The plan includes $7.2 billion for education, or
about 46 percent of the budget. Earlier this year, 22,000 teachers in
Washington went on strike for two weeks for more spending for education.;   
Ohio legislators Friday gave up on passing a timely budget and approved a
30-day temporary spending bill.;    Massachusetts lawmakers sent Gov. William
F. Weld a proposal for a $12.9 billion spending plan that includes deep cuts
in social services and a property tax increase for most residents.;   
Illinois legislators expected to continue their debate into the week but faced
the prospect of shutting down some state services as talks continued.;   
North Carolina lawmakers took a weekend holiday from their debate over the
largest tax increase in state history, thereby ensuring that they would not
pass a budget in time for the new fiscal year.  </TEXT>

   HARTFORD, Conn. -- Gov. Lowell Weicker signed into law a
controversial budget which includes a state income tax,
ending a stalemate that left Connecticut without a budget for
53 days.
   Under the new law, which takes effect Oct. 1 and is
retroactive to Jan. 1, Connecticut residents are subject to a
progressive income tax with an effective rate of up to 4.5%.
The law also reduces the sales tax to 6% from 8% and phases
out a 20% surcharge on the corporate income tax. The tax rate
on income from interest, dividends and capital gains would be
reduced to a maximum of 4.5% from a current range of 7% to
14%.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The end of Connecticut's lengthy struggle to close its
gaping budget deficit was not a smooth one. After
round-the-clock negotiations, the measure was narrowly passed
in the Senate through a tie-breaking vote from Lt. Gov.
Eunice Groark. The House initially rejected the budget
proposal in a round of last-minute posturing, but passed it
later by a vote of 75 to 73.
   The budget's passage is considered a victory for Gov.
Weicker, who had vetoed three previous budget proposals from
the legislature that didn't include an income tax, leading to
a temporary shutdown of the state government.

   Connecticut is now in Day 47 of its Budget Hostage Crisis.
The legislature and an apparent majority of voters don't want
to create a state income tax; Connecticut is one of 10 states
without one. Governor Lowell Weicker, a prickly independent,
insists on using an income tax to close a $923 million
deficit. Last week he vetoed a non-income tax budget for the
third time and the legislature again failed to override him.
Perhaps the way to break Connecticut's stalemate -- and
others that will no doubt develop elsewhere -- is to let the
people decide the issue in a referendum.
   Governor Weicker, elected with only 40% of the vote last
year, insists that only an income tax can truly balance the
state's budget and that the issue of government spending is a
"red herring" in the debate. Legislators say that the issue
goes beyond this year's budget. "Once state government has a
claim on our paychecks, it will never give it up," says M.
Adela Eads, the GOP State Senate leader. States without an
income tax also tend to have more economic growth than states
with one. As an alternative, the legislature would expand the
sales tax to a variety of new products.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Tom Scott, a former state senator, says opposition to an
income tax isn't coming from those who would pay the most
under it. Legislators from affluent Greenwich and Stamford
are the biggest supporters of an income tax. Many of their
constituents already pay a hefty state tax on investment
income; that might be lowered with a broad-based income tax.
"It's middle-income and working people who are fighting
this," Mr. Scott told us.
   To break the budget gridlock, some legislators have indeed
suggested letting the people decide on an income tax in a
referendum. Last year, Bruce Morrison, the Democratic
candidate for governor, said such a major change in state
finances shouldn't be made without consulting the people who
would have to bear the burden. But Mr. Weicker, an heir to
the Squibb drug fortune, is openly contemptuous of popular
democracy. "We're not going to run the state by referendum,"
he says. "That comes every four years, and it's called an
election."
   Yet 22 states, mostly in the West and Midwest, provide for
direct voter lawmaking. As their residents see it,
representative government is important, but there are times
when an entrenched government becomes beholden to special
interests and refuses to solve pressing policy issues. Then
the people should step in and do the job themselves.
California's Prop 13 is only the most notable example.
   The right of initiative does not have to be absolute. Some
states place limits on it. Nevada requires any new law to be
approved twice by voters before it takes effect.
Massachusetts requires that any measure be submitted first to
the legislature for a vote; only if it is rejected can it go
on the ballot. Sometimes, the voters also fail. By passing
the tax-cutting Prop 2 1/2 in 1980, voters thought they had
contained the growth of Massachusetts' government. Michael
Dukakis proved them wrong.
   Although many states have proven the value of initiatives,
their potency means that most legislators in states without
them bitterly oppose the idea. New Jersey provides a recent
example. Voters are furious at how Governor Jim Florio rammed
through a redistributionist tax increase using the state
income tax that was first imposed in 1976. Anti-tax groups
say the only way to keep state spending under control is to
vest the people with the power to change laws directly.
   For years, Republicans have supported adding a right of
initiative and referendum (I&amp;R) to New Jersey's constitution.
In 1986, the measure passed the State Assembly only to die in
the Senate. But some GOP legislators want it both ways. They
publicly back I&amp;R, but privately hope Democrats will defeat
it and keep the lawmaking power in Trenton.
   Last month, Democratic Senate leaders who opposed I&amp;R
forced the Republicans to put up or shut up. They moved to
approve a GOP-backed initiative bill. Last year the Senate's
GOP caucus had unanimously voted to get the same bill out of
committee, but this year seven GOP Senators switched sides
and defeated I&amp;R. Such double-dealing by the state's
Remocrats and Depublicans will only fuel voter support for
the idea.
   Popular democracy is more than a way for voters to check
the excesses of arrogant elected officials who make it nearly
impossible for voters to oust them. If Connecticut and other
states deny voters a chance to express their will on key
issues, they risk creating an electorate mired in cynicism
and alienation. Allowing the right of initiative would put
voters once again in control of their destiny and would
represent a legitimate extension of the right to vote.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo has a $900 million problem,
California Gov. George Deukmejian's is $2 billion and Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis' just grew to more than $400
million in Massachusetts.
   State budget deficits are sweeping the nation as a result of
what almost everyone thought was a good idea _ federal tax reform
that has resulted in a slump in capital gains tax collections.
   North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin announced last week that he would
have to pare as much as $60 million from his budget proposal
because of a one-shot ``revenue slump'' brought on by
lower-than-expected tax collections.
   Connecticut budget chief Anthony Milano warned state agencies
last week that sluggish revenue collections could mean the state
will start its new fiscal year July 1 with a deficit.
   In Pennsylvania, state officials say that total revenues are up
but that taxes on sales of personal investments, also known as
capital gains, are down about 8 percent.
   There are indications that other states that rely heavily on
personal income taxes for revenue may have similar problems as the
year goes on, said Dall Forsythe, Cuomo's budget director.
   Cuomo has even proposed cutting funding for the state's Council
on Children and Families, which is run by his wife, Matilda.
   Most states reaped tax revenue windfalls from 1986 when
investors rushed to take advantage of tax breaks that the new
federal rules were designed to erase when they took effect Jan. 1,
1987.
   Then the tax changes sent taxpayers running to their accountants
for help in reducing their taxes, and the taking of capital gains
slowed, reducing capital gains tax revenues.
   In some states, such as Pennsylvania, budget officials lowered
their revenue estimates forthis year in anticipation of a possible
shortfall.
   The Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry complained
that Gov. Robert Casey's administration was not liberal enough in
estimating the benefits of federal tax reform.
   ``We had a discussion with the Pennsylvania Chamber on how much
of a windfall we would get and we said, `None,''' said Karl Ross,
Casey's deputy secretary for policy and analysis. ``That's what we
budgeted for and that's what's happening.''
   The fiscal problems are causing political headaches for Dukakis
and Deukmejian.
   Dukakis, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, based his
campaign on his abilities as a manager. He must now cut his budget
because his numbers were wrong.
   Republican Deukmejian, who has been mentioned as a possible
running mate for George Bush, had proposed $800 million in revenue
raisers to help close his budget gap, estimated at about $1 billion
this year and $1 billion next year. But he withdrew the proposal,
angry at reporters for calling it a tax increase.
   Democrat Cuomo doesn't have to run for re-election until 1990
and has been quick to propose some politically unpopular spending
cuts.
   Cuomo said last week that the shortfall could present a good
lesson for this year's presidential campaign by demonstrating the
different approaches for dealing with it.
   ``The deficit he has is just the right size,'' Cuomo said of
Dukakis. ``I think this is a break for Dukakis. He will now show
you how he handles a deficit. He will do it swiftly, cleanly,
effectively.''
   Massachusetts' Democrat-controlled Legislature has tentatively
passed a $40 million cigarette tax hike and a revision of state tax
law to conform it to federal law that would increase personal
income taxes by $70 million this year. Dukakis is not yet committed
to the cigarette tax.
   There have also been cursory discussions of other ``sin taxes''
on liquor and entertainment to close Massachusetts' $400 million
shortfall.
   Dukakis already has ordered that $233 million in spending be
postponed, that state employment be frozen and that agencies
prepare for possible personnel cuts through attrition.
Massachusetts' total budget is about $11 billion.
   Cuomo last week proposed $406 million in program cuts and
cost-savings from the $44.2 billion-plus budget the Legislature
adopted less than two months ago. He also wants to make use of a
$650 million fund that, ironically, was created with the 1986 tax
windfall and set aside for low-income housing and highway projects.
   Cuomo has, among other things, ordered a hiring freeze for state
agencies and proposed increasing tuition for out-of-state students
at New York's public colleges. He's called for the elimination of
the State Police's six-horse mounted patrol, a favorite at fairs
throughout New York.
   Cuomo has refused to call for tax increases or even a delay of
tax cuts enacted last year, even though at the time he suggested
the cuts might be too generous.

<HEAD>Despite Promises, Pennsylvania Tax Vote Creates Confusion</HEAD>

   A plan to restructure Pennsylvania's
local taxes is being contested with the zeal of carnival hucksters,
and voters appear to be confused over whether it would mean lower
taxes or another dig into their pockets.
   The complex proposal appears on a statewide referendum May 16,
boiled down to a critical 50 words dealing with the balance between
business and residential taxes. If approved, it would mark the
first major change in the state's local tax system since the
mid-1960s.
   At the heart of the plan is a tradeoff: Homeowners are being
promised property tax reductions in exchange for allowing local
governments to raise income taxes.
   It's a trend that has been taking place around the country.
Similar proposals to place a larger tax burden on income are being
weighed in Michigan, Nebraska, Washington and Montana.
   Predictions of what Pennsylvania's plan will mean for average
taxpayers have varied so greatly that its essential component _
seeking greater fairness by taxing income instead of property _
seems lost. The sole focus has become whether overall local taxes
will go up, or down.
   The plan's architects hold that those hurt most by increasing
property taxes are residents on fixed and lower incomes, including
many elderly. By shifting more of the tax burden to income, the
state would be creating a fairer tax system that would benefit
those groups, they say.
   According to state figures, about 58 percent of the local tax
revenue across the state is now raised through property taxes and
about 11.5 percent from income. Under the proposed changes,
property taxes would make up about 30 percent of the local tax base
and income about 40 percent.
   The great irony _ and a fact acknowledged by both sides in the
debate _ is that no one can truly say what will happen: There are
just too many local variables.
   In addition to the property-income tax shift, the bill would
also allow counties to use a sales tax; the despised Philadelphia
wage tax, imposed on both city residents and suburbanites who work
in the city, would be lowered; and other local wage taxes would be
eliminated.
   ``It's like picking the Lotto; it's just not something that can
be done with any precision,'' said Robert Greenwood of the
Pennsylvania Economy League, an independent research group.
   The confusion is illustrated in estimates prepared by various
groups at the state Capitol. The administration of Gov. Robert P.
Casey, a Democrat who championed the plan, has predicted that a
family in Lehigh County in eastern Pennsylvania making about
$30,000 annually would pay about 12 percent less in local taxes
under the reforms. Senate Democrats say a family in that county
making $25,000 would pay 17 percent more.
   Using such figures, supporters are trying to sell the plan as a
tax cut for most homeowners while opponents are pitching it as a
virtual across-the-board tax hike.
   The shrill tenor of the tax debate was unexpected in
Pennsylvania, where there is no tradition of controversial ballot
questions. In the past 30 years, only nine of the 68 statewide
referendums have been voted down, and those elections were
low-profile.
   Republican opponents like to describe the referendum as a
measuring stick for the governor's popularity. Casey urged the
Legislature to enact the plan last fall, and Republicans are
apparently looking for potential political ammunition for Casey's
expected re-election bid next year.
   ``(Casey) has attached his star to this issue. ...The governor
has gone way, way out on a limb,'' said Senate President Robert
Jubelirer, a Republican and opponent of the tax plan.
   The whole thing has proven difficult to sell to voters, a
political consultant's nightmare.
   ``It's certainly different and unique compared to promoting a
candidate. It's a concept, and a concept that's very difficult to
grasp,'' said David Sanko, a coordinator for Citizens Against
Higher Taxes, a group opposed to the plan.
   ``I'm disgusted with the distortion and the partisan political
debate,'' said John Stauffer, a former Republican leader in the
state Senate who is co-chairman of the Vote Yes Committee, which
supports the plan.
   ``If anything it will get worse in the final few days. It will
be a typical election,'' he said.

<HEAD>Governors See GOP Plan as Adding to Tax Woes</HEAD>

   It used to be an article of Republican faith:
the more taxing and spending that can be shifted out of Washington
to local and state governments, the better.
   That tenet now seems subject to revision to fit the federal
deficit crunch. As governors and local officials see it, the new
version shifts spending all right, but then proposes tax changes
that would undercut their ability to raise their own revenues.
   At the long, lagging negotiations on an elusive deal to trim the
$169 projected budget deficit, Republicans produced a plan that
included a new ceiling on federal tax deductions for state and
local income taxes. It also would sharply increase the federal tax
on beer and wine, as part of a package of $54 billion in spending
cuts and revenue increases.
   The federal tax deduction for state income taxes would be
limited to $10,000 a year, and most of the estimated $3 billion it
would produce would come from taxpayers making $100,000 a year or
more.
   So some congressional Republicans said the plan the
administration floated _ but never really disclosed _ should
satisfy Democrats who insist that upper income Americans pay most
of the tax cost of deficit control.
   It didn't. And it ran head-on into the opposition of governors
of both political parties, in Mobile, Ala., for their annual
conference, which ended Tuesday after raising the volume of their
usually scattered protests.
   The governors already are facing tax woes of their own; 36
states are electing governors this year and where incumbents are in
jeopardy, it's usually over increased taxes.
   State taxes generally have increased during the past decade,
under a conservative Republican administration that has trimmed
federal aid. That worked in boom times, but it is a worsening
problem in a slowing economy.
   Democratic governors circulated a letter demanding that
President Bush drop the tax idea. They said it would impose a
double tax in the states that have done the most to deal with their
own financial problems, and would make it tougher for the states to
increase their own revenues.
   There are income taxes in 44 states, and local income taxes are
levied in 11 of them.
   Along with the impact, governors feared the precedent.
   Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, a Republican
usually allied with the administration, said the idea of a
deduction limit was ominous.
   Once that ceiling was in place, lowering it would be a tempting
way to come up with future federal tax increases. About one-third
of all the itemized deductions on federal tax returns are for state
and local income taxes.
   Deductions for state sales taxes were phased out as part of the
1986 tax overhaul.
   Bush has not acknowledged administration authorship of the tax
plan; the refrain at the White House is that everything is still on
the table. That's what John H. Sununu, the chief of staff, told the
governors on Sunday. He also said the proposal wasn't what the
president would prefer.
   But it was put together by Bush's budget director, and it
appears that the president would prefer it to a straight increase
in the federal income tax rate for the wealthiest taxpayers. Under
current law, middle and upper income taxpayers pay 33 percent; on
family incomes over about $186,000, the rate dips back to 28
percent.
   Despite that White House wariness, Senate Republican Leader Bob
Dole, said, ``We've laid out a specific plan and we're still
waiting to hear from the Democrats.''
   But the Democrats were in no hurry to talk taxes. They always
wanted the Republicans to go first.
   And congressional Republicans, looking toward the Nov. 6
elections, complained they were taking a beating.

   This decade will be remembered for a profound transformation in federal-state fiscal relations: a great reduction in aid from Washington accompanied by a flip in the preferred forms of taxation. 
The national government has abandoned high rates of income taxation and must look to revenue sources long exploited by the states, which in turn ought to move to the income tax. 

   According to the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations, federal aid, though fairly constant in absolute levels, has dropped as a percentage of state-local outlays from 25% in 1981 to an estimated 19% for 1987. 

   The signal event of the latter half of the 1980s was the passage of a federal tax bill that sharply reduced personal and corporate income-tax rates and repealed the deductibility of state and local sales taxes in computing federal taxable income. 
This legislation continues a two-decade trend that has seen the maximum federal income-tax rate fall from 90% to 28%. 
The inducement it provides to states to shift their tax base is clear: Income taxes paid to them remain fully deductible on federal forms. 

   Washington, meanwhile, will likely turn to excise and consumption taxes -- perhaps even a value-added tax -- the next time it decides to "enhance" revenue. 

   Surprisingly, the states seem oblivious to the revolution currently under way. 
An unusually large group of them -- predominantly in the Southwest, Midwest and Rocky Mountain regions -- spent fiscal 1987 cutting budgets and raising taxes in response to structural and cyclical economic downturn. 
A smaller group -- mostly on the East and West coasts -- was preoccupied with disposing of "windfalls" received as a result of the 1986 federal tax changes. 
Neither group, however, took cognizance of the fundamental changes occurring in the intergovernmental system that effectively establish new, and rather narrow, parameters for state tax policy. 

   Texas provides a textbook example of how not to raise revenue under the new regime. 
Facing a huge budget deficit brought on by falling severance-tax revenues, the legislature recently passed a $5.7 billion tax bill, the largest single state tax increase in the history of Texas or the nation. 
This was achieved by raising the sales tax rate from 5.25% to 6%, broadening the sales tax base to cover certain business and consumer services, extending a motor fuel tax and boosting excise taxes. 
The sales tax's nondeductibility has made this increase an extremely costly one for Texas taxpayers. 
Indeed, in large metropolitan areas, the combined state-local sales tax is now 8%, putting Dallas and Houston in the same league as New York and San Francisco. 

   Worse yet is Florida, which, in its last regular legislative session, levied a 5% sales tax on services, including those provided by out-of-state companies. 
Florida's version of tax reform represents an unabashed effort to shift a sizable proportion of the state's sales-tax burden to out-of-state residents, ostensibly sparing in-state taxpayers the cost of nondeductibility while at the same time managing to avoid state income taxes. 

   This is not the first time Florida has reached beyond its borders to raise revenue. 
Several years ago the state enacted the nation's most severe unitary tax on the world-wide earnings of multinational corporations. 
But 18 months later, after a number of companies doing business in Florida pulled up stakes, the unitary tax was repealed. 
In the wake of convention cancellations and withdrawals of national advertisers, the Florida legislature is now meeting in special session and will probably repeal or amend its new service tax. 

   Some would argue that the lesson to be drawn from Florida's experience is simply don't tax advertisers. 
But a much more serious issue is at question: How can states such as Florida and Texas modify their fiscal structures in a nondiscriminatory way to capture activity in the rapidly growing service industries without resorting to income taxes? 
In fact, they can't. 

   Proposals to hit business and personal-service industries with broadened sales and franchise taxes, or even a state valueadded tax, will inevitably entail complex and expensive administrative and compliance procedures for both taxpayers and tax collectors. 
In contrast, profits-based taxes are fair, efficient and easy to administer and collect. 
And they afford the best mechanism for maintaining revenue adequacy over the long term. 

   States without income taxes must realize that today this can be a competitive liability rather than an advantage. 
Ironically, Louisiana -- notorious for regressive, inefficient tax policy since Huey Long's administration -- recently has been among the most progressive in this regard: The Louisiana legislature is currently considering a proposal, endorsed by all the gubernatorial candidates, to significantly lower the state's sales-tax levy while raising its income-tax rate. 
It bears noting that support in Louisiana for an income-tax increase at the expense of sales taxes has come largely from the state's corporate leadership. 
Similar business support for an income tax ultimately will materialize in Texas and Florida as well. 

   At the same time, states should relentlessly pursue the holy grail of the lowest possible tax rates levied across the broadest possible base. 
While empirical evidence demonstrates conclusively that moderate taxes broadly based and fairly administered are no detriment to economic growth, it's just as clear that relatively high taxes administered inefficiently or unfairly are destructive. 

   Finally, the reality of what John Shannon of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations has branded "fend-for-yourself federalism," the hallmark of which is continued reductions in federal assistance to other levels of governments, argues for a renewed focus on budget containment at the state-local level to obviate the need for frequent tax increases. 
Facing these tough choices, governors and legislators shouldn't have to dissipate their energy, capital and political ambitions in tedious and protracted wranglings over tax structure.

<HEAD>Study Says Higher Standards Needed To Improve State `Safety Nets'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The federal government needs to set higher
standards for state poverty programs so that the assistance
available to poor people won't vary so widely from state to state,
a private research group says.
   At the same time, states need to do more on their own to improve
programs for the disadvantaged, said the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities.
   The center, which analyzes government spending and its impact on
the poor from a liberal perspective, reported Wednesday that most
states fail to provide adequate ``safety nets'' for the poor.
   The center's report, ``Holes in the Safety Nets,'' found broad
differences among the states in the quality of assistance provided
to the poor. It concluded that shortcomings exist in all regions of
the country and even in some states with sound economies and
above-average personal income.
   ``The extent of variations in state poverty policies makes a
strong case for an enhanced federal role, both in setting standards
and providing funds,'' the researchers said. ``Assistance to many
poor families would not then depend so much on where in this nation
they happen to live.''
   But center Director Robert Greenstein said that because budget
constraints probably will prevent sweeping changes at the federal
level, ``we believe that the principal choices made in determining
the quality of the state safety nets are likely to be those made in
each state capital.''
   ``To narrow some of these holes in the safety net, state action
is crucial,'' he said.
   The center studied government programs that provide cash,
medical and other assistance to the poor, and found that none of
the states nor the District of Columbia met all 10 standards in a
``reasonable adequacy'' test developed by the center.
   Twenty-nine states meet three or fewer of the criteria,
including Indiana and Texas, which meet none; just 14 states meet
more than half the criteria, including Minnesota and Massachusetts,
which did the best by meeting nine of the 10.
   The study found, for example:
   _In 32 states, maximum benefits from Aid to Families with
Dependent Children are below half the poverty line for a family of
three with no other income.
   _Twenty-eight states impose state income taxes on working
families living below the poverty line, and 10 tax the income of
families living below half the poverty line.
   _In 26 states, fewer than one in three jobless workers received
unemployment insurance in an average month in 1986.
   Greenstein told reporters that some of the states that are the
most stingy with benefits ``turn around and extract significant
amounts of the income of poor families through the tax system in
their states.''
   He said that because the assistance gaps are present in all
regions of the country and in states with both low and high
personal income, ``this indicates that really you're talking about
political questions'' in determining benefits.
   ``I think what you're seeing reflected ... on the most part is
the political weakness ... of low-income families,'' Greenstein
said.
   Here is a breakdown of which states met how many standards in
the 10-point adequacy test:
   _Zero: Indiana and Texas.
   _One: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico, North
Dakota and South Dakota.
   _Two: Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho,
Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, Tennessee and Wyoming.
   _Three: Hawaii, Illinois, New Hampshire, Ohio, Oklahoma, Utah,
Virginia and West Virginia.
   _Four: Alaska, Delaware, District of Columbia, Kansas, Nebraska
and North Carolina.
   _Five: Iowa and Maryland.
   _Six: Maine, Oregon and Washington.
   _Seven: Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Vermont and
Wisconsin.
   _Eight: California, Michigan, New York and Rhode Island.
   _Nine: Massachusetts and Minnesota.

   Capital-Gains Cut -- A Worse Idea Than Ever

   The White House plan to cut the capital-gains tax rate to
15% from 28% deserves the shroud into which even the feckless
Congress seems inclined to sew it. There might be a version,
there might be a time and there might be a place, but this
isn't any of those things. And pushing Alan Greenspan into
heading a bipartisan capital-gains commission to "iron out
technical disagreements" may wind up undercutting the Fed
chairman's less-than-Gibraltarian credibility rather than
alchemizing gold out of warmed-over 1980s greed.
   What some folks in Washington don't seem to understand is
simple: The greedwagon rolled 10 years ago and the 1980s are
over. A decade ago, Ronald Reagan and a bipartisan majority
of Congress leaped for their fiscal machetes and slashed a
half-century of federal tax progressivity to ribbons. By
1990, a married couple with two $50,000-a-year-incomes was
paying a marginal rate in federal taxes of 40.65% (33% in the
income tax "bubble" and 7.65% in Social Security) while
million-a-year earners were paying just 28% on each
additional dollar.

   A few more statistics bear repetition. The Forbes 400
richest Americans increased their combined net worth to $270
billion in 1989 from $92 billion in 1982, while the median
family income stayed only slightly ahead of inflation. The
Census Bureau, in turn, recently reported that the median net
worth of American households dropped 4% between 1984 and
1988.
   Low capital-gains taxation played a starring role in this
wealth polarization. Congressional Budget Office data show
that during the 1980s, the top 1% of Americans increased
their share of national income to between 11% and 12% of the
total, from about 8%. However, if you add in capital gains, a
Brookings Institution study shows that the top 1% boosted
their share of national income even more -- to an
extraordinary 14.7% in 1986. That year was a high for capital
gains, to be sure, but the message remains. The richest 1% of
Americans own about 60% of the corporate stock. They probably
do about 98% of the serious "deals." Big capital gains
caressed by low taxes are what tripled the net worth of those
on the Forbes list.
   That wasn't what the 1981 propaganda had predicted, of
course. "Trickle-down" economics -- one of the Republican
Party's more recurrent embarrassments -- sandbagged huge
chunks of Middle America. For example, while the mid-1980s
stock market indexes were soaring, the value of farm land was
collapsing. Data from the Conference Board indicates that the
total value of U.S. farm land dropped to $392 billion in 1986
from $712 billion in 1980. While lawyers' and doctors'
compensation jumped, the real average wage in manufacturing
was declining.
   The trouble with the new money is too little of it is
doing the real economy any good. It's in speculative funds
and deals, junk bonds, vintage Bugattis, see-through office
buildings, yachts (the Atlantic and Pacific oceans had to be
area-coded during the Reagan years) or modern art.
   What 1990s tax policy will probably wind up doing is
mandating new priorities rather than increasing already ample
exchequers. Last fall, Washington raised the top 1%
income-tax bracket to about 31% from 28% and established a
half-hearted luxury tax that could easily become a framework
for serious revenue-raising. Congressional Democrats, for
their part, have been drumbeating for a surtax on
millionaires and a 35% top bracket. At the state level,
pressure is building for new, higher top brackets in
Illinois, Pennsylvania and Maryland. Within a few years,
Connecticut -- and maybe even Texas -- could have state
income taxes. The governor of Maryland has just proposed a 2%
annual tax on automobiles and boats. A wealth tax a la
Mitterrand France might also pop up in some states.
   Trends like these could wind up recreating a major
differential for capital investment without cutting the
rates. If mansions and luxuries get clobbered, and if taxes
rise on ordinary income, then a 28% tax on capital gains
could make capital investment comparatively more appealing.
Of course, the law would presumably be tightened to limit the
sort of assets eligible and to minimize tax-shelter
re-emergence. Luckily, high Japanese and German interest
rates increase capital costs in those countries, reducing
that problem.
   Politics, meanwhile, is more populist now. A capital-gains
rate reduction to 15% became a do-it-yourself suicide kit for
the Grand Old Party by late last year. As October's budget
debate spotlighted President Bush's simultaneous attempt to
reduce capital-gains rates while fighting off a millionaire's
surtax, his own job approval dropped from an 80% high in
August to a 48% late-October low. At one point, GOP voter
identification was off 1012 points as Middle America couldn't
stomach the Republicans' re-emergent "party of the rich"
image. Even rank-and-file Republicans couldn't stomach some
of what was being done by their leaders. A December NBC/Wall
Street Journal poll found 51% to 43% of Americans favoring
increasing capital-gains rates, not cutting them (and four
out of 10 Republicans agreed). In the same poll 84% favored
the Democrats' surtax on millionaires -- and that included
80% of Republicans.
   Post-election national polls taken for Fortune Magazine
confirmed the late 1990 populist surge. Fifty-five percent of
those sampled said millionaires had gotten where they were by
exploiting others, and the percentage saying America would be
better off without any millionaires rose from one in four a
decade earlier to about one in three.
   Now that the U.S. is at war in the Persian Gulf, White
House promotion of capital-gains rate reduction giving most
of its benefit to the top 1% or top 5% of Americans could
also be bad patriotism. The Arab world already seeths with
"have-not" animosities against rich Persian Gulf oil states
run by Mercedes-driven sheiks. Even here in the U.S. there's
an uneasy sense that blue-collar, minority-group and
middle-class Americans will fight the war, while domestic
social programs lose funding -- and while rich Americans bear
little burden.
   So it would have been better if George Bush's enthusiastic
research into World War II and Persian Gulf parallels hadn't
ended with Hitler, Churchill and Munich. Back then, a
military draft took everyone, from Yale to Yazoo City; the
top tax rate was 91%; and an excess-profits tax ensured that
no corporation profiteered from battlefield sacrifice. The
Bush White House, however, has just rejected an
excess-profits tax for 1991, and to bunch that decision with
yet another push for capitalgains rate reduction could raise
the sort of fairness issues that plagued the GOP in October.
   As for a Greenspan Commission, with its unseemly role for
a Fed chairman, no one can doubt that it will buzz with
rented economists confiding that a capital-gains cut will
raise $6 billion a year while growing hair on Mount Baldy.
But the larger truth will still be that capital-gains rate
reduction, for now, is a triple play: bad economics, bad
politics and bad patriotism in one unwise package.

   Connecticut, Tennessee May Soon Join
   List of States That Levy Income Taxes

   The short list of states without an income tax could get
even shorter as two more ponder instituting such a levy in
the face of severe budget problems.
   Connecticut Gov. Lowell P. Weicker, faced with one of the
highest budget deficits of any state, has proposed a personal
income tax while cutting other state taxes. But a tax on
wages would be unthinkable for some because Connecticut has
an enduring distinction as a tax haven from its neighboring
states.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But confronted with the recessionary economy and a
projected budget deficit of $2.4 billion by midyear, Gov.
Weicker said he was left with few choices. Indeed, in his
speech to the state Legislature Wednesday, Gov. Weicker said
he went into the budget deliberations seeking to avoid an
income tax.
   Citing a similiar fiscal dilemma, Tennessee Gov. Ned
McWherter also proposed that his state impose a personal
income tax. State officials said the state won't be able to
grant raises to teachers without one.
   However great the declared need for such a tax, proposals
in both states are expected to meet stiff opposition. In the
Connecticut Legislature, Democrats are divided on the issue
while the Republicans are expected to fight it. For the
Tennessee governor, a Democrat, the obstacles were already
evident as a state senator from his own party refused to
carry the legislation into the state Senate.
   Specifically, the budget package for Connecticut calls for
a flat 6% tax on personal income in excess of $25,000 for
couples and $12,500 for individuals. The package also calls
for cutting the 8% sales tax to 4.25%, although some items
that are currently exempted would be included. The sales tax
provided the bulk of the state's tax revenue during the heady
days of consumer spending but has become a relative trickle
with the recession.
   In short, Connecticut officials said the tax package is
expected to reduce the total state tax burden for the poorest
families, those making less than $15,102 a year, while
increasing it for most other taxpayers. And though Gov.
Weicker's proposal also calls for eliminating state taxes on
capital gains, dividend and interest income, the rich are
still going to be hurt under his proposal. State officials
estimate that a family with $460,000 income would still pay
nearly $5,000 more in combined state taxes than last year,
when the bulk of such a family's taxes were based on unearned
income.
   Under Gov. McWherter's package, poorer Tennessee families
would also pay less in combined state taxes as the state
personal income tax is offset by lower taxes on sales and
other items.
   Connecticut and Tennessee are not the only states looking
to find ways to cure their budget woes. According to the
National Governors Association, at least 28 states are in
significant budget trouble this year, with a total of $9.6
billion in projected deficits for their fiscal years ending
in June. Rhode Island, Connecticut's neighbor, is proposing a
major income-tax increase.

   Re your July 28 article "Governors Say Rising State Taxes Are Proof They Have Fiscal Discipline Washington Lacks": Nebraska should not be included in the group of states that did not return all or part of a "huge revenue windfall" that resulted from the 1986 Federal Tax Reform. 
Prior to 1987, Nebraskans were taxed approximately 20% of their federal income taxes due. 
The 1986 reforms would have resulted in a Nebraska state income tax shortage. 
In 1987, our legislature changed our state income tax, reducing our tax rates, and uncoupling it from the federal return. 
It was assumed to be revenue neutral. 

   Gov. Orr's tax and economic development package also provided for optional sales, corporate income and property tax incentives for Nebraska companies that substantially expand their investment and/or increase jobs as well as for companies that relocate or start up anew in our state. 
Based on early reports, the results seem spectacular.

Texas Tackles a Big Problem:
How to Repair Its Tax Code
---
By Eugene Carlson
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
12/01/87
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)
TAXES LABOR
ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)
   IMAGINE YOU HAVE carte blanche to design a tax system for your state. 
Starting from scratch, how much of the state's revenue-raising load would you lay on the sales tax? 
Would you install a state income tax? 
How much of a tax burden should property owners bear? 
And just to keep the debate interesting, how about a state value-added tax? 

   The Texas legislature, disgusted with its own meager efforts at repairing the tax code, has commissioned a business-government group to recommend top-to-bottom changes in how the state collects revenue. 
Since April, the 13-member Select Committee on Tax Equity has been digesting the works of tax scholars, listening to expert testimony, and weighing suggestions, both practical and offbeat, from citizen taxpayers at public hearings around the state. 
One resident proposed taxing all Texasrefined gasoline exported to the Eastern seaboard. 

   "We're gathering the chestnuts. 
We haven't started making the pie yet," says Dan Cook, the panel's chairman and a partner in the Dallas office of the investment banking firm Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. 
The committee includes seven business and financial executives, all relative newcomers to tax policy, plus four members of the legislature, the state comptroller and the chief budget officer. 

   TEXAS'S BIG PROBLEM is a top-heavy revenue system that hasn't changed much in nearly 30 years. 
Two-thirds of the state's tax receipts in the 1987 fiscal year came from just three sources -- a weighty 8% sales tax, a motor fuels tax, and a production tax on oil and natural gas. 
The system works fine when the state's petroleum-dependent economy is booming, but when oil prices start to roller coaster, as they have since 1982, so do tax collections. 
It's a revenue estimator's nightmare. 

   Mr. Cook says the tax code is also "filled with inequities across the board." 
Overall, individuals aren't heavily taxed, but the dominant sales tax hurts low and middle-income people more than the affluent. 

   The petroleum industry, heavy manufacturers, and utilities pay the lion's share of corporate taxes, while much of the service sector goes untaxed. 
Meanwhile, a state court has ruled that the property tax-based system that pays for public schools is unconstitutional. 

   "We've got a 1960s tax base working on a 1980s economy," says Billy Hamilton, the select committee's executive director. 

   What to do? 
The income tax, long considered politically off limits, is one of many options getting a close look from the committee. 
"It's awfully nice to say we don't have a state income tax, but I think if something was done in a modest fashion, it wouldn't be a major detriment," Mr. Cook says. 
He notes in the same breath that the committee is still gathering information and isn't anywhere close to making its final tax choices. 

   (Texas is one of 10 states that doesn't have a broad-based personal income tax. 
The others are Alaska, Connecticut, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Washington and Wyoming.) 

   THE COMMITTEE IS also intrigued with Michigan's 11-year experiment with the value-added tax. 
Like Texas, Michigan's economy is subject to the ups and downs of a single industry. 
In the old days, when automobile sales slumped, state corporate income tax collections dried up. 

   Looking for revenue stability, Michigan in 1976 replaced a handful of business taxes with a "single business tax" that places little emphasis on profits, instead taxing the "value added" to a product in the form of wages, material, and so on at each step of production. 
Michigan is the only state to take this tax route. 
The idea "is going to get a lot of analysis," says Texas tax committee member Bob Marbut, president of Harte-Hanks Communications Inc., San Antonio. 

   Committee members insist they won't make recommendations based on how easily they might become law. 
"I'm not a political animal," says Mr. Cook. 
Adds Mr. Marbut: "If we don't do anything more than what the last legislature did, we're wasting our time." 

   Instead, the panel hopes to draft a blueprint that includes the philosophy behind taxing various economic sectors plus economic models that will influence Texas tax reformers for years to come. 
"At least to the end of the century," Mr. Marbut adds. 

   Notes Bill Alloway, director of the Texas Association of Taxpayers: "They're dramatically elevating the tax IQ of the state of Texas." 

   The committee expects to hand its report to the legislature before it convenes in January 1989.

   SEPTEMBER MARKED THE FIRST TIME in eight years that no state had an unemployment rate in double digits. 
The highest jobless rates were in Louisiana, 9.9%, and in West Virginia, 9.1%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

   The Northeast and Middle Atlantic states continued as the nation's tightest labor market, with six states under 3% unemployment: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont. 

   September marked New Hampshire's 26th consecutive month as low-unemployment leader.

<HEAD>It's Income vs. Spending As Legislatures Convene</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA BARNAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Aid to education, prison overcrowding, insurance reform, property
tax relief and the environment are among the issues challenging
state lawmakers this year, but none looms as large as the battle of
the budget.
   It's income vs. spending, and if revenues are up, so are costs of
services. Just to stay even is more expensive, without talking about
adding money for things like schools, road repair or social services.
   ``What we face in the coming months will not be easy,''
Connecticut Gov. William A. O'Neill said last week in his
state-of-the-state address. ``We will have to say `No' when we
really want to say `Yes.'''
   Some states, including Alaska, California, Connecticut, Iowa,
Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New York and West Virginia, are
running in the red or face deficits in the coming fiscal year.
Others, like Illinois, have avoided deficits by no-frills budgets
and face a backlash from the lean years.
   A lucky few are running surpluses, heating up debate on what to
do with the largesse.
   Caution abounds. New York and Massachusetts saw surpluses of a
few years ago turn to deficits _ at least $636 million in
Massachusetts' current $11.6 billion budget and more than $1 billion
in New York's budget of more than $28 billion.
   States expecting to do well this year _ Hawaii, Kansas,
Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Idaho and Maryland _ are
fearful of the same thing happening to them.
   ``It's real easy to make a tax cut right now, and we all look
good for re-election,'' says Hawaii House Finance Committee Chairman
Joseph Souki. ``But is that the wisest thing?''
   Lawmakers, having read voters' lips, are loath to talk about
hiking taxes. The idea is being mentioned mainly in the states with
the biggest money woes, and the most likely candidates are increased
taxes on cigarettes, alcohol and gasoline, rather than raising state
income taxes.
   Spending on education has perhaps the highest priority. Even in
West Virginia, with a fiscal headache totaling $680 million,
Gov.-elect Gaston Caperton has promised unspecified raises to the
state's teachers, who rank 46th nationally in salaries. Illinois
education officials, who have gone two years without a significant
budget increase, are expected to seek increases totaling more than
$600 million this year.
   Coupled with increasing aid to education is the need in some
states to restructure the system for public school financing to
reduce the disparities between rich and poor districts. Montana's
Legislature must fashion a new system to replace one that a state
court last year declared unconstitutional.
   Prisons are another big-ticket item. Michigan is in the middle of
a massive prison building program; by 1991, the state will have
spent $900 million to build 28 prisons, and if projections hold
true, the system still will be overcrowded.
   ``The cost of operating prisons is eating us alive,'' said
Michigan Senate Appropriations Chairman Harry Gast.
   Virginia is building two new prisons to increase its inmate
capacity by 2,600, but corrections officials say the state still
will be at least 1,000 beds short in a few years and more money will
be sought.
   ``The cost of crime is expensive, so we must accept the fact that
the money drawn to support the criminal justice system is money that
we will not have for the wide range of other important needs
throughout the commonwealth,'' said Gov. Gerald L. Baliles.
   Once lawmakers have their budget priorities settled, they still
won't lack for issues.
   Rising auto insurance costs are expected to be debated in New
Jersey, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. And California is awaiting
the results of a court challenge to Proposition 103, a voter
initiative passed last November that requires a 20 percent rate
rollback for most kinds of insurance and tougher state regulation of
insurers.
   The environment and waste disposal is another sore spot for some
states. New Jersey suffered a second consecutive summer of beach
closings because of high bacteria levels and medical waste washing
ashore, and the Legislature passed a series of measures designed to
help clean up the state's ocean waters.
   However, other proposals to track the disposal of medical waste,
impose tougher penalties on polluters and create a powerful
commission to protect the coast remain mired in disputes.
   South Carolina residents are clamoring for reductions in the
amount of hazardous waste buried in a landfill used by more than 30
other states, and the Legislature is studying ways to deal with
rapidly filling solid-waste landfills, also a consideration in New
Hampshire.

   When your March 16 editorial "Wrangling Over Windfalls" criticized states for using the new federal tax law as a "backdoor" method of increasing state taxes, I had just completed an agreement with the Oregon Legislature to enact a revenue-neutral reconnection to the federal tax code. 
But rather than respond immediately to your editorial's inclusion of Oregon as one of the states where citizens would "get socked with more taxes," I chose to wait until actual legislation was enacted. 

   I have just signed into law a revenue-neutral reconnection, tying Oregon's tax code to the new federal code without collecting an extra dime in state taxes. 
If our legislature had simply adopted the new federal code with no changes in our rates, the state of Oregon would have collected an extra $300 million in the 1987-89 budget period. 
Instead, I recommended, and the legislators agreed, that personal and corporate rates would be reduced. 
Our top personal income-tax rate was cut from 10% to 9% and our top corporate rate from 7.5% to 6.6%. 
Two-thirds of Oregon's families will pay a lower state income tax in 1988 as a result of this law, which was supported by an overwhelming bipartisan vote in the Oregon Legislature. 

   Oregon is emerging from a severe economic recession and we are embarking on new programs to encourage businesses to expand and locate here. 
These lower tax rates are a signal that Oregon provides a friendly economic climate as well as quality of life.

   Nearly half the states have seen no real
growth in revenues this year, indicating they are in recession or
close to it, a study of state finances said Saturday.
   The impact was cushioned by a big round of tax increases last
year, and even more are likely next year, the author of the study
said.
   ``The pressure is building on states to raise taxes next year,''
said Steven D. Gold, director for the Center for the Study of the
States at the Nelson Rockefeller Institute of Government at Albany,
N.Y.
   ``If you see a state that has lower revenue this year than last
year, you know they're under tremendous pressure and there's a good
bet they'll have to raise taxes next year,'' he said.
   The report was issued by the center, which is part of the State
University of New York at Albany.
   It said that in a survey of revenue collections in 43 states, 23
reported total tax revenue increases equal to or below the
inflation rate _ meaning no increases after adjustment for
inflation.
   The figure was in line with a Labor Department report Friday
showing unemployment shot up to 5.5 percent last month and the
economy grew by just 1.2 percent in the second quarter, below the
level needed to create new jobs.
   Orders to factories for manufactured goods fell 1.5 percent in
June, the third drop this year, a sign layoffs and cutbacks could
be coming.
   Construction spending was unchanged in June after being down two
straight months and the government's Index of Leading Economic
Indicators, weak most of the year, showed no strength at all.
   The conclusion that many state economies are in or near
recession is consistent with a report from the National Governors'
Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers
in April that states were in worse financial condition than a year
ago.
   The fresh study said corporate income tax collections were the
weakest component of the state revenue picture, with a 6.7 percent
decline, reflecting a drop in earnings.
   The two other principal revenue sources, the sales tax and
personal income tax, posted overall gains of 6.6 percent and 7
percent respectively.
   Those three taxes account for more than 70 percent of state
collections. In most states the revenue figures were for the 12
months ending in June.
   Weak state economies were found in all regions of the country,
but New England and Mid-Atlantic states were in the worst shape,
the report said.
   In five states, revenue was lower than in the corresponding
period a year earlier: Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, New
Hampshire and New York.
   Eighteen other states had increases of less than 5 percent, the
approximate rate of inflation used in the report.
   They were: Rhode Island, Vermont, Maryland, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Alabama, Florida,
Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, New Mexico,
Colorado and Oregon.
   Only eight states had revenue increases of 10 percent or more:
Illinois, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, West Virginia, Idaho,
Wyoming and Nevada.
   Tax increases enacted since last year have helped boost revenue
in several of those states, including Illinois, Georgia and West
Virginia.
   ``Things are even worse than they look when you consider the
fact states raised taxes quite a bit last year,'' Gold said in an
interview. ``If those tax increases hadn't occurred, the decline in
revenues would be even lower.''
   Thirty states raised taxes last year, about the same number as
this year. Twelve of the 1989 increases were large, involving
either income or sales taxes.
   Gold said last year's tax increases totaled about $5 billion,
with $3 billion taking effect this year. That should have been
enough to increase the overall revenue figure by about 1.5 percent,
he said.
   Three states reported decreases in personal income tax
collections: Hawaii, which cut its rates, and Michigan and New
York. But 10 others had increases below the inflation rate.
   Maine and Massachusetts reported lower sales tax revenues, and
19 others had increases of 5 percent or less.
   Seven states did not provide figures for the study: Alaska,
Delaware, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and
Wisconsin. The report said several of those states are known to
have strong revenue growth _ North Dakota, Utah and Washington.

   NEW HAMPSHIRE _ Districts pay an average of 85 percent of
education costs, chiefly with property taxes. Voters in 1984 passed
constitutional amendment saying state government had to pay for
programs it mandates. Many feel state is not abiding by the law, and
Claremont School Board is considering suit.
   
   NEW JERSEY _ State Supreme Court scheduled to hear arguments
Sept. 25 in lawsuit on behalf of 20 school-aged children in Camden,
Irvington, East Orange and Jersey City. Group won a victory last
summer when an administrative judge ruled state's school funding
formula unconstitutional because of disparities between rich and
poor districts.
   
   NEW MEXICO _ Since 1986 when a state law limited school property
taxes, more than 95 percent of the operational funds for public
schools come from state appropriations. But with school spending
still lagging, some now support increasing reliance on property
taxes so long as it's equitable.
   
   NEW YORK _ Long Island voters, angered by property tax increases
of as much as 60 percent, rejected school budgets in 28 districts
this spring, greatest number in at least a decade. Governor's
commission recommended changes in state aid formula, but Legislature
took no significant action.
   
   NORTH CAROLINA _ Most school funding comes from state, and all
counties get same amount of funding. But state sources say
Reidsville City School System is considering suing state over its
funding formula.
   
   NORTH DAKOTA _ Nine school districts and 48 parents filed suit
against state in June, claiming North Dakota's system of providing
aid to public schools is unconstitutional. Suit pits urban
districts, which have more students but less property wealth,
against rural districts, with fewer students and more property from
which to draw tax revenue.
   
   OHIO _ Lawmakers have for years debated dozens of proposals that
backers say would close the funding gap among Ohio schools; none
have passed. Last year, Legislature approved local-option income tax
provision. Some 85 districts as of July 7 had taken initial steps to
compute income tax rates.
   
   OKLAHOMA _ Legislators this summer considering Gov. Henry
Bellmon's ambitious plan to replace most of the property tax with a
special school tax and a system of income tax surcharges. Bellmon
says his plan would add $281.5 million for Oklahoma schools; it
faced stiff opposition.
   
   OREGON _ Federal lawsuit filed this spring on behalf of three
Portland high school seniors challenges state's school funding
method. Group of school districts plans similar challenge. State
pays about 30 percent of costs of local schools; local property
taxes pay most of remainder.
   
   PENNSYLVANIA _ Voters in May trounced referendum backed by Gov.
Robert P. Casey designed to rework the way local governments tax
residents. Plan sought to reduce residential property taxes by
allowing local governments and school officials to impose new income
and sales taxes.
   
   RHODE ISLAND _ Legislature voted in 1985 to limit local property
tax increases to 5.5 percent a year in exchange for increased state
education aid. The state, which contributed 40 percent of local
education costs in 1985, now kicks in 50 percent; goal is 60 percent
by 1993.
   
   SOUTH CAROLINA _ The Education Finance Act passed in 1978
includes formula to calculate tax-paying ability of each school
district. Assessors must meet minimum standard for that school
district, then the state provides additional funds.
   
   SOUTH DAKOTA _ The Legislature froze local property taxes
effective July 1 at request of Gov. George Mickelson. Local
governments have the power to exempt themselves. The freeze was
imposed to give state time to study school funding methods, which
depend almost solely on property and sales tax.
   
   TENNESSEE _ Sixty-six school districts have sued state claiming
smaller districts come up short in school funding and state fails to
make up the difference. No court date set. State provides about 50
percent of school funding, virtually all from sales tax.
   
   TEXAS _ Group of school districts has sued state claiming funding
method is discriminatory. The districts won lower court ruling,
which was reversed by appeals court. Case pending before Texas
Supreme Court.
   
   UTAH _ State's funding system, the ``weighted pupil unit,'' is
among the most equal in the nation, providing about $2,400 per
student in state funds. But per pupil spending still ranks near
bottom.
   
   VERMONT _ State equalization formula changed over the last three
years to take property tax rates into account, and state money for
local schools doubled from $71 million in 1985 to $137 million.
Still, property tax rates have soared in several large districts;
Bennington and Middlebury defeated school budgets.
   
   VIRGINIA _ Legislative commission created this year looking at
ways to ease school property taxes. State budget for 1988-90
included a $550 million-plus boost in school aid, with state
increasing its share of local school costs from 50 percent to 52
percent over the two-year period. Gov. Gerald Baliles has set goal
of 55 percent.
   
   WASHINGTON _ Ten-year-old court ruling required state to fully
fund education. Local levies permitted only for enrichment, and now
average about 17 percent of the state allocation. Voters this fall
will decide a ``Children's Initiative'' to increase spending.
   
   WEST VIRGINIA _ State remains under 1982 court order declaring
school finance system unconstitutional and ordering Department of
Education to draw up a plan to correct inequities. Second ruling
declared state's property tax system unconstitutional. Changes would
cost $1.3 billion, but entire state budget is only $1.7 billion.
   
   WISCONSIN _ State Supreme Court in February upheld school funding
formula under which state apportions about $1.3 billion a year among
districts. Milwaukee school officials argued unsuccessfully that
children in large cities have special high-cost problems.
   
   WYOMING _ Superintendent of Public Instruction Lynn Simons in
August urged Legislature to add a 1 percent sales tax to ease
financial problems in state education funding to raise $50 million a
year. Simons suggested increase to make up for Wyoming's dwindling
oil and gas money reserves that have been used to fund school
programs.

   HARTFORD, Conn. -- Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. vetoed the
Legislature's latest proposed budget, calling instead for
lawmakers to use "honest numbers" to devise a budget that
works.
   "I will not accept the old `creative accounting' mode at
budget time," he said, citing what he called the
Legislature's manipulation of various expense and revenue
lines to create an illusion of a balanced budget. "We have
the honest numbers. On with the honest job. Veto."

   This is the third budget Gov. Weicker has vetoed, and his
decision leaves Connecticut the only state without a budget
for the fiscal year that began July 1.
   In a statement outlining the reasons for his veto, Gov.
Weicker said the budget passed by the General Assembly Sunday
would leave him "stripped of any capacity to sell Connecticut
as a place to locate a business and raise a family." He cited
the planned expansion of the 8% sales tax to more goods and
services, further increases in excise and property-related
taxes and a failure to lower the 13.8% corporate tax rate,
the highest in the nation. He has insisted that an income tax
is the only fair way to raise revenue.
   Legislative leaders vowed to try to override the
governor's veto and are expected to take up the issue today.
An override requires a two-thirds vote of the Assembly and
Senate. The previous override attempt narrowly failed. During
the budget stalemate, the state has been operating by
executive order. The order is due to expire Sunday but could
be extended.
   The governor challenged the Legislature on a number of key
points. First, he argued that although the budget bill says
the state would spend less than $7 billion, a more "honest"
figure would be $7.5 billion, largely because the state is
responsible for interest and principal payments on debt
outstanding. Moreover, he questioned legislators' assumptions
about $327 million of labor concessions that were volunteered
in April, saying that the deal with state workers may not be
available now.
   On the tax issue, Gov. Weicker blasted the plan to raise
$827 million by expanding the sales tax as "regressive,"
saying middle-income families would be hard-hit and the poor
would be "wiped out." Gov. Weicker has said cuts in the
corporate and sales tax rates would help stimulate the state
economy.
