   Free speech, including the right to wear
offensive T-shirts, has returned to the campus of Tufts University
after President Jean Mayer decided a ban on verbal attacks wouldn't
wash in court.
   ``I have decided we are better off erring in the tradition of
free speech,'' Tufts President Jean Mayer said Thursday in an
interview. ``We decided we would decide each case on its merits.''
   Student body president Billy Jacobson, 20, of Roslyn, N.Y., said
he was sorry to see the abolition of a policy supported by most of
the 7,000 students at the private school about six miles north of
Boston.
   ``It was well-intended,'' Jacobson said. ``The university has a
responsibility to protect students. It can't insulate students, but
this is their home and students shouldn't have to worry about going
into their dorms and their dining halls and seeing something
offensive to them.''
   The policy published in the student handbook barred verbal
attacks, whether spoken or written, against an individual's race,
ethnic group, religion or sexual orientation.
   The policy was prompted by an outcry last spring when an
enterprising student marketed a T-shirt stating 15 reasons ``Why
Beer is Better than Women at Tufts.'' All 15 reasons disparaged
women, and one printable reason was ``Hangovers go away.''
   The T-shirt dealer was placed on probation and ordered to do 50
hours of community service. But Mayer suspended that sentence when
lawyers advised him it was unconstitutional.
   The Student Life Committee, a panel comprising faculty and
students, stepped into the breach and imposed the free speech
restriction last June.
   When it made its way into this year's student handbook and
protests were raised, Mayer decided the policy had to go. He
announced it to students Wednesday through the campus media.
   Mayer said he abolished the restrictive policy in part because
legal opinions vary widely on the matter.
   Some experts say the First Amendment only means to bar the
government from restricting speech and doesn't apply to private
universities, Mayer said. Others say it outlaws muzzling anyone who
says or writes anything short of inciting a riot.
   Additionally, a court ruling found a similar policy at the
University of Michigan at Ann Arbor was unconstitutional and vague,
Mayer said.
   Bruce Reitman, Tufts associate dean of students, said the issue
of resurgent bigotry on campuses around the country comes up
whenever administrators gather. But he couldn't offer a theory why.
   ``Campuses are more reactionary than they were in the '60s.
There's a new right wing,'' Reitman said. ``We have had our share
of it, similar to other campuses around the country. There's more
tension about these issues than there used to be.''

<HEAD>Sununu Receives School Benefits Six Years After Leaving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six years after he last taught at Tufts
University, John Sununu remains on the school faculty in what one
official calls an ``extremely rare'' arrangement that allows his
children to receive tuition waivers and other aid.
   Sununu, the New Hampshire governor chosen to serve as White House
chief of staff in the Bush administration, last week declined to be
discuss the arrangement but said last summer, ``I never asked for
any different treatment. This was all done by the board of
trustees.''
   Sununu has had two children enrolled in Tufts since he left the
university and also has children attending the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Mass., and Stanford University
in Palo Alto, Calif.
   The children attending Tufts are granted full tuition waivers and
those at other colleges receive tuition subsidies from Tufts as part
of faculty benefits Sununu has received during his six years on
leave from the school, according to Tufts officials. Tuition at
Tufts in the 1987-88 school year was $11,750.
   An official who oversees faculty benefits at Tufts said general
school policy is to grant leaves for up to two years.
   But policies governing such extended leaves by faculty at private
colleges and universities vary greatly, with the longest leaves
generally granted to professors who quit their academic posts for
high-profile government assignments.
   Sununu announced in May that he would not seek a fourth term as
governor and has spent much of his time since then working for Bush.
During the presidential campaign he served as a chief Bush surrogate
attacking the record of Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the
Democrats' nominee.
   In announcing that he would not seek another term, Sununu cited
his $68,000 a year gubernatorial salary as too small. His wife
specifically said college tuition bills were a factor in her
husband's decision to leave his post.
   As White House chief of staff, Sununu can earn up to $89,500,
according to government pay scales.
   Tufts officials confirmed Sununu remains on leave from his
tenured teaching post in the mechanical engineering department but
referred most questions about the circumstances of his leave to
President Jean Mayer, who did not return repeated messages from The
Associated Press.
   Mayer's secretary said the school president told her he would
have no comment on Sununu's status.
   Sununu said last summer he intended to eventually return to
teaching at Tufts but had not discussed a date with school
officials. In the school's latest catalog, published in Aug. 15,
1988, Sununu remains listed as an associate professor of mechanical
engineering.
   ``Why not?'' he answered when asked if he believed it was
appropriate for his children to continue to receive tuition waivers
and assistance from Tufts.
   Attempts to reach Sununu this week to discuss his status at Tufts
were unsuccessful. Jerry Little, the governor's spokesman, said
Wednesday that Sununu did not have time to conduct an interview.
   Children of Tufts faculty members, and most other colleges and
universities, are allowed to attend that school free of charge.
Tufts policy also allows children of Tufts faculty to receive $1,250
a semester for a maximum of $2,500 a year to help pay their bills at
any other accredited college, according to Bernice Segal, academic
affairs officer at Tufts.
   Whether those benefits are extended to faculty members on leaves
varies from school to school, according to an informal survey of a
dozen private colleges and universities.
   Sununu said he believed his children at Stanford and MIT received
$1,250 a year from Tufts. He said he did not believe, as Ms. Segal
said, that they were eligible for $2,500.
   The school, citing confidentiality guidelines, refused to say how
much assistance was given to Sununu children attending schools other
than Tufts. But it released the amount which they are eligible to
receive.
   Ms. Segal, to whom all questions about faculty benefits were
referred, said all benefits are available to faculty on full leaves,
including health and disability insurance. Sununu does not receive a
salary from the school.
   She termed it ``rare'' for a faculty member to be granted a leave
of more than two years and ``extremely rare'' for a leave to be
approved for five years or more.
   A department chairman must recommend a faculty member for a leave
and the recommendation must be approved by the school's dean, she
said. Leaves are reviewed annually, she said.
   Tufts spokeswoman Rosemarie Van Camp disputed parts of Ms.
Segal's account and said extended leaves are ``routinely'' given to
faculty members who enter the Foreign Service, an apparent reference
to those who leave Tufts' Fletcher School of Law &amp; Diplomacy for
diplomatic jobs.
   Ms. Van Camp said she could not recall any current or former
faculty member except Sununu who had been granted an extended leave
while holding elective office.
   Frederick C. Nelson, dean of Tufts School of Engineering, said
Sununu's leave ``was not an action of my office. I suppose he asked
for it to be continued but that was handled by the president's
office.'' He referred all other questions to Mayer.
   Sununu joined the Mechanical Engineering faculty at Tufts in 1967
and remained in the post until he was first elected New Hampshire
governor in November 1982.
   His daughter Cathy graduated from Tufts in 1982, while Sununu
still was teaching there.
   Another daughter, Elizabeth, graduated in 1983, the first year of
her father's leave of absence and first year as governor.
   A third daughter, Christina, a graduate of the University of
Vermont, is currently enrolled in a graduate program at Tufts,
according to school officials who refused to discuss her specific
course of study.
   Sununu's son, John, attends MIT and another son, James, attends
Stanford.

   With society's increased attention on the environmental threat posed by toxic compounds, Tufts University plans to begin the nation's first collegiate program in hazardous-waste management. 

   "We've received a lot of support from industry, because there's no other program like this in the country right now," Gene Blake, associate director of the Tufts Center for Environmental Management, said. 
"There's a real need for it." 

   The interdisciplinary master's degree course is designed to educate students on issues related to hazardous waste and will focus on environmental health, science, policy and technology, school officials said. 

   Representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Audobon Society, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Quality Engineering and several engineering consultants and Tufts faculty members will develop the curriculum before classes start next fall. 

   The EPA has targeted hundreds of sites across the country for cleanup of hazardous materials under its Superfund program. 

   "We're hearing from government and citizens groups that it's hard to find good people aware of the issues surrounding current policy, technology and research," Mr. Blake said. 

   Linfield C. Brown, chairman of Tufts' civil engineering department, said that students will be required to have some background in calculus, chemistry and biology, but that the program will focus on risk assessment, management and communication, health effects and environmental management regulations. 

   Mr. Blake said the new venture is designed to do more than just teach students how to clean up hazardous-waste sites. 
"We want to teach people how to avoid waste problems in the first place," he said. 

   For a final one-semester course, all students will be placed in small teams to act as consultants and meet with federal and state officials to develop solutions for existing environmental management or policy problems. 

   Tufts' Department of Urban and Environmental Policy is assisting in development of the new program. 
Students can complete the program in one year full time, or in three years on a part-time basis.

   The president of Tufts University
rescinded a ban on verbal attacks after legal experts suggested the

   Tufts University has withdrawn investments
in companies that do business in South Africa, except for those
involved with communications and humanitarian endeavors.
   The decision was reached Saturday during a board of trustees
meeting and was approved by both faculty and students. Under the
action, Tufts will withdraw investments of approximately $5 million
from U.S. companies. The school has a total investment portfolio of
about $120 million.
   In 1986, Tufts students staged demonstrations against the
apartheid policies of the white South African government. Students
built a shantytown and held a sit-in demonstration.

   Your March 14 editorial "Dartmouth's Vexations" hit home. 
In late January, we hosted representatives from the Sandinista government and the Nicaraguan resistance on back-to-back nights (the Sandinistas refused to share the podium with any representative of the Contras). 
While the Sandinista, Julio Icaza (then-deputy permanent representative to the U.N.), was able to deliver his speech without incident, the following night the Contra, Alfredo Cesar, was nearly silenced by what has been called the "rent-a-mob" forces in Cambridge. 

   While we were able, after removing 26 protesters, to hear Mr. Cesar, the fracas certainly had a chilling effect on future efforts to bring people of controversy and note from the right/conservative viewpoint to the forum. 
Although we were successful with Mr. Cesar, the prospect of once again encountering the expense, criticism and scrutiny is a frustrating one, and it may be at a price many are increasingly unwilling to pay. 

   I for one hope that will not happen because our role as educator will have then become moot.

   Your editorial lists Tufts University as an institution where the politics of Alexander Haig would not be tolerated. 

   Four years ago we invited several former secretaries of state to Tufts to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. 
We have an excellent policy on controversial speakers, and the university is very experienced in dealing with noisy situations. 
We guaranteed our participants that we would handle all groups with discipline and security. 
I cannot speak for Mr. Haig, but at the last moment Henry Kissinger pulled out. 
I assume that Mr. Haig also withdrew at the last moment, because he did not appear at the forum. 

   In recent years we have had the Jewish Defense League, the PLO, Israeli settlers and the acting president of Ber Zeit University on our campus. 
This past semester the university sponsored a discussion by the director of academic affairs of the CIA, who wrote that he was very gratified at the reception he got. 
Within the past month, at a symposium on "Covert Action and American Democracy," we had the pleasure of one former CIA Director and several station chiefs sitting on a panel with people of the opposite political orientation. 
Comandante Zero was also a guest at Tufts. 

   Ms. Kirkpatrick and Messrs. 
Haig, Pastora, Kahane, Chomsky, et al. are welcome at Tufts. 
We look to educate and stimulate our students, and this requires an open campus. 
No one has ever been denied the First Amendment here.

   Of all the leading liberal-arts institutions in America, Dartmouth College has been a leader in recent years in permitting and even nurturing the growth of conservative thinking, writing and activism among its students and faculty. 
True to its long history, Dartmouth proudly sustains open and free speech and the attendant controversies that have arisen on campus. 
Contrary to your editorials, Dartmouth certainly has not engaged in censorship, suppression of free speech or persecution by closed hearing. 

   In the case at hand, Dartmouth was dealing with unruly students who were completely out of line. 
Your suspicion of other motivation is wholly unsupported by any evidence. 
Dartmouth's actions would be and absolutely should be the same regardless of the political or other persuasions of the individuals involved.

   After checking with people I know in Hanover, N.H., I find your editorial to be almost entirely based on the facts. 
As with many liberal-arts institutions, the truth is more likely to be found in independent sources that are not in the employ of the management. 
My alma mater doesn't need a better public-relations agent; it needs an infusion of fair-minded trustees and higher standards for faculty.

   The Journal is to be congratulated on highlighting the intolerance against conservatives on campus. 
It would be bad enough if the Dartmouth Review, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Adolfo Calero, et al. were the only targets of this prejudice. 
It is compounded when discriminations against conservative institutions are included. 

   The faculty at Colby College has voted to ban students from meeting with CIA recruiters. 
Similar faculty-sponsored efforts are under way in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota and New York. 

   A similar campaign is under way to prevent colleges from offering students the option of participating in the ROTC and its related scholarship programs. 

   Conservative and religious student group applications for recognition are frequently denied or delayed indefinitely despite or because of a plethora of leftist groups on campus. 
It is sometimes hard to concede rights to those with whom you are ideologically opposed. 
Our colleges are finding it impossible. 

   The First Amendment seeks to protect freedom of speech, religion and assembly. 
Our colleges and universities purport to teach their students its nearly 200-year history. 
Maybe the day will yet come when our colleges also implement its spirit.

<HEAD>Tufts, MIT Officials Deny Weakening Findings in Scientific Journal
Challenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top officials of Tufts University and MIT
insist they did not whitewash their findings when they investigated
a scientist's challenge of a colleague's article in a scientific
journal.
   The university officials said Tuesday that review panels took
seriously the complaint of former Massachusetts Institute of
Technology researcher Margot O'Toole but believed she overstated
deficiencies in the article.
   Ms. O'Toole told the House Energy and Commerce investigations
subcommittee she lost her job at MIT and her reputation was smeared
after she complained to both universities about the article
published in the journal Cell in April 1986.
   She testified that those who reviewed her complaint from the two
schools later accused her of stealing data, lying, refusing to
accept alternative interpretations and being unable to distinguish
between important and trivial issues.
   The article dealt with the immune responses of mice bred with an
extra immune system gene from another species. Ms. O'Toole
attempted to show the conclusions of the paper were not supported
by the original laboratory data.
   One of the authors was Thereza Imanishi-Kari, who is now on the
faculty of Tufts but in 1986 was in charge of the MIT laboratory
where Ms. O'Toole worked.
   John Deutch, provost of MIT, told the subcommittee that
reviewers found that O'Toole was correct in contending there was an
error in the article, but decided it was not flagrant and a
correction was not warranted.
   ``At the conclusion of the review, I concurred in the judgment
that the issues raised did not imply misconduct ...'' Deutch said.
``Any suggestion of misconduct in ... research is viewed with
concern.
   ``Our self-interest in our reputation as a leading research
university required that the integrity of our research be our first
priority.''
   Henry Wortis, a pathology professor at Tufts and one of those
who reviewed the challenge, said investigations at his school, MIT
and the National Institutes of Health found ``the original
conclusions of the paper are legitimate. I stress this point: the
conclusions are correct.''
   Wortis also criticized the committee probe as ``yet another
inquiry, this time by non-scientists into the same matter.''
   Ms. O'Toole said, ``I challenged the paper because it
represented evidence that simply did not exist, period. This is not
a complicated concept. It is one thing to believe that something is
true. It is another to present experimental evidence in support of
the claim.''
   A review panel convened by NIH said that although there was no
fraud or misrepresentation, errors had occurred that should be
corrected. The NIH investigation was reopened after two members of
the review panel were replaced when it was revealed they had ties
to one of the authors.
   A report from Secret Service experts said at least five and
possibly 25 pages in one of Ms. Imanishi-Kari's notebooks were
filled in as much as two years after the dates on the page, and at
least two dates were changed.
   Ms. O'Toole told the subcommittee she was forced to take a job
outside the field of science because of her challenge. She said she
learned that high-level Tufts administrators were told she made a
charge of fraud without justification, when it fact she had not
charged the article was fraudulent.
   She said she heard the MIT faculty was ``accusing me of
`purloining' or stealing laboratory notes. I had never done such a
thing, but I have since confirmed that this is how they described
my attempts to behave in a professionally responsible manner.'`

<HEAD>Students From Tufts, Moscow State To Discuss Arms Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 350 students from Tufts University
will discuss the Cold War and nuclear arms race in a classroom
session with undergraduate counterparts in the Soviet Union via
television, the school said.
   The March 5 teleconference is the first of three scheduled
sessions between students from Tufts and Moscow State University in
a jointly run course on the superpowers' arms buildup.
   Tufts professor Martin J. Sherwin, course instructor and
director of Tufts' Nuclear Age History and Humanities Center, said
the project coincides with the rise of glasnost, Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of openness.
   ``Given the new climate in the Soviet Union, this appears to be
the right step at the right time,'' he said.
   An American panel of historians and foreign policy experts is
scheduled to discuss the arms race with a panel of Soviet
counterparts.
   ``These programs will be lively discussions,'' Sherwin said.
``Panelists will be directed to engage in a dialogue rather than to
present set pieces.''
   Students will have an opportunity to question both countries'
panelists, he added.
   The first session will focus on the history of the nuclear age,
including the consequences of the U.S. bombing of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki in World War II, the first United Nations' arms control
debates and the origins of the Cold War, Sherwin said.
   The 1962 Cuban missile crisis and current nuclear policy issues
_ including the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative program, the
Geneva arms talks and the December signing of an intermediate range
missile reduction treaty _ will be discussed at April 9 and April
30 sessions.

   Students at Tufts University can wear T-shirts with
raunchy messages in dorm rooms and on campus lawns, but not in
classrooms under a new policy that officials said Thursday tries to
balance free speech with decorum.
   ``We feel it's our obligation to say that there are no
constituencies that are fair game,'' said Dean of Students Bobbie
Knable.
   The T-shirt zones were created after a male student marketed 200
T-shirts that gave 15 reasons ``Why Beer is Better than Women at
Tufts,'' all disparaging to women. One of the more printable lines
was ``Hangovers go away.''
   ``There were complaints about it,'' Knable said. The T-shirt
dealer was placed on probation and sentenced to 50 hours of
community service, which was later revoked. Officials of the private
liberal arts school then decided to draft a policy curtailing the
bodily display of hostile or derogatory slogans.
   The new rules, which take effect this fall, could involve some
fast changing. For instance, a student might wear a risque T-shirt
in his own room, then cover up the offending portion on his walk
through the dormitory common area before reaching the campus lawn, a
free area.
   But Knable says the circuitous policy stems from efforts to
comply with free speech rights.
   Students in classrooms or dormitory common areas can't escape
looking at the offending message, so the T-shirts are banned, she
said. But dormitory rooms are private and general campus grounds
can't be controlled.
   ``We didn't expect that we could protect our students from all of
the manifestations of bigotry or prejudice,'' Knable said.
   The writing of the policy stirred lively debate on campus. The
final decision on what constitutes a derogatory slogan will be made
on a case-by-case basis, she said.
   ``We really tried to narrow the definition (of offensive) to
derogatory and demeaning,'' Knable said. ``There are a lot of ideas
that people will encounter on campuses in a diverse community that
will be offensive to them and we are not trying to protect people
from ideas,'' she said.
   Knable said the policy is intended to be more of a deterrent than
a disciplinary tool. If complaints are lodged with the dean of
students, the matter will be taken to a panel of faculty and
students. Possible penalties might be probation or community service.
   Knable said officials at Tufts, known for its foreign policy
department, don't expect to have to enforce their penalty frequently
this fall.
   ``It's not as if we are a campus in which we expect the most
virulent kind of things will happen and happen frequently, it's just
that we are still a part of the world,'' she said.

   Most people know that protein is essential, but there are many
misconceptions about how much the body needs and what are the best
sources.
   Take this true-or-false quiz to see if you know the facts.
   1. Most Americans eat more than enough protein.
   2. Proteins that come from animals contain all the essential
amino acids the body needs.
   3. As adults age, they require less protein.
   4. High-protein diets are not recommended for the obese.
   5. Red meats are better protein sources than poultry or fish.
   6. Athletes need significantly more protein than non-athletes.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ANSWERS
   1. (True) Most Americans consume double their requirement for
protein. For example, the RDA for a 130-pound woman is easily met
by eating three ounces of lean meat, one slice of bread, one-half
cup of cottage cheese, and 1 cup of milk.
   2. (True) Animal proteins are considered ``complete,'' meaning
that they contain the needed amounts of the nine essential amino
acids your body must get from food. Vegetables are not complete
sources of protein; they lack essential amino acids or do not
contain them in sufficient quantities to meet your body's needs.
Only by combining complementary vegetables on the same day (e.g.,
rice and beans) can you receive a complete protein source.
   3. (False) Current thinking is that the RDA for protein remains
the same on a weight basis throughout adulthood. Some investigators
think that because of changes in the body's efficiency in using
protein, the elderly might require more. However, since calorie
needs decrease as we age, it is wise for the elderly to select
low-fat sources of protein.
   4. (False) High-protein, low-carbohydrate, very low-calorie
diets can be effective for weight loss in obese people (those who
are approximately 25 percent or more above their normal weight
range). After an initial water loss, significant amounts of fat are
also lost. However, these diets can be hazardous and are
recommended only for heart disease or adult-onset diabetes. And
they should always be undertaken with medical supervision.
   5. (False) Red meats tend to be higher in fat, so the percentage
of protein on an ounce-for-ounce basis is lower than in fish or
poultry.
   6. (False) Although an athlete may need slightly more protein
during the initial stages of training or competition, that need is
not very great. Since most Americans already consume more than
enough protein, chances are the increased need has already been met
by a normal diet.

   A solar-powered commuter car Sunday won
a 234-mile race against other sun-fueled vehicles and a free ride
to an international competition in Switzerland, organizers said.
   The Solectria Lightspeed produced by Solectria Corp. of
Arlington took first place in the commuter category with a time of
8.2 hours, crossing the finish line behind the Fletcher School of
Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in this Boston suburb.
   Fifteen solar-powered cars began the second annual race in
Fairlee, Vt., on Wednesday. The commuter category consisted of
useable two- and four-seaters, said race co-director Nancy Hazard.
   ``What we are really trying to promote is the development and
use of commuter cars,'' Hazard said.
   The Solectria Lightspeed, driver Anita Rajan, and its crew will
be flown to the Tour de Sol in June by Lufthansa German Airlines,
said Rosemarie Van Camp, a Tufts official.
   Solectria Corp. also finished second in the commuter category
with its Selectria Sunrise, at 8.23 hours.
   In the racing category, the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's MIT Solectria 5 finished first at 6.2 hours.
   The Dartmouth Sunvox II came in second for solar racers at 7.9
hours.
   The University of California at Irvine's Solaris was the only
entry in the cross-continental category. The car completed the race.
   The race was sponsored by the Northeast Solar Energy Association
and private corporations, Hazard said.

   Sugar has little to offer in the way of nutrient value. For its
calories (16 per teaspoon), sugar provides no vitamins or minerals
that are essential to good health.
   But is sugar one of the culprits in disease? Does eating too
much sugar lead to obesity? What is the role of sugar in the onset
of diabetes?
   Take this quiz to see how your answers match up with those given
by experts. Answer true or false.
   1. People who eat a lot of sugar tend to be heavier than others.
   2. Excess sugar consumption can lead to diabetes.
   3. Sugar plays a role in the development of tooth cavities.
   4. Research has begun to implicate sugar as a risk factor for
certain cancers, particularly cancer of the colon.
   5. Reactive hypoglycemia, a condition characterized by a sharp
drop in blood sugar after meals, affects a larger percentage of the
population than was once believed.
   6. Sugar interferes with the availability of certain vitamins
and minerals to the body.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ANSWERS
   1. False. Overweight people actually eat less sugar than thin
people, according to epidemiological studies. Moreover, the amount
of sugar someone eats is not necessarily a determinant of whether
he will gain weight. Obesity results from a variety of factors,
including life-style, genetics, and overall eating and activity
patterns.
   2. False. Sugar in itself does not contribute to the development
of diabetes. However, it does aggravate the condition once it
exists. People who have diabetes have trouble keeping down their
blood-sugar levels, so eating products that contain a lot of sugar
makes the problem harder to control.
   3. True. It is not possible to say exactly how great sugar's
role is in the development of cavities. The form in which it is
consumed makes a difference. Sugar in sticky substances is more
problematic than sugar in fruit or fruit juices. Other factors,
such as the hardness of the tooth's surface, are also involved. But
the amount of sugar Americans eat contributes to dental cavities.
That's because the bacteria that cause toothe decay feed on sugar.
Sugar also increases the chance that periodontal (gum) disease will
occur. The more sugar a person eats, the more likely it is that his
gums will recede, causing his teeth to loosen.
   4. False. No scientifically based data support the notion that
high levels of sugar consumption increase an individual's risk of
developing any type of cancer.
   5. False. Although many people believe they have reactive
hypoglycemia, relatively few individuals suffer from this condition.
   6. False. Scientists have discovered no convincing evidence that
people who eat large amounts of sugar have trouble metabolizing any
nutrients.
   Note: Taken as a whole, these answers indicate that sugar
appears to cause no direct problems besides playing a role in the
developmnet of tooth decay. But that doesn't mean that a healthy
diet is consistent with the consumption of a lot of sugar-filled
snacks and beverages. Since sugar contributes no nutrients to the
diet, its consumption should be limited to make room for foods with
vitamins, minerals and other essential nutrients.

   Integrated Genetics Inc. said it signed a research agreement with Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine for developing genetically altered animals that produce human drugs in their milk. 

   Under the three-year agreement, the biotechnology concern will fund the development of a herd of livestock at Tufts that can produce commercial quantities of human drugs in their milk, Integrated Genetics said. 
The amount of the funding wasn't disclosed. 

   In 1987, researchers with the National Institutes of Health and Integrated Genetics reported they had developed genetically altered mice that secrete the drug tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, in their milk. 
The technique involves transferring genes from one species into another. 

   Since then, Integrated Genetics and other concerns have investigated the feasibility of producing TPA and other drugs in larger animals such as sheep and cows.

<LEADPARA>  Nobel Prize-winning molecular biologist David Baltimore, who is also president
of New York's Rockefeller University, asked Wednesday that an influential
scientific paper bearing his name be retracted because of evidence that it
contained fraudulent data.;    Baltimore's action came just hours after
several major news organizations received leaked copies of a draft report of
an official government investigation into the paper, which was published in
the scientific journal Cell in 1986 and which purported to make a critical
contribution to understanding the immune system.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BIOLOGIST RETRACTS STUDY OVER FRAUD CHARGES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The report, prepared by the Office of Scientific Integrity of the National
Institutes of Health, detailed numerous instances in which one of Baltimore's
co-authors, Tufts University researcher Thereza Imanishi-Kari, allegedly
falsified and manufactured data.;    Although the report does not implicate
Baltimore in any scientific fraud, it criticizes him for defending the paper's
scientific honesty despite evidence that parts of it were fraudulent.;    "It
is difficult to comprehend his maintaining this stance as the evidence mounted
that serious problems existed with the . . . data in the Cell paper," the
report said.;    Baltimore's request to withdraw the Cell paper, a dramatic
reversal of his stance, is the latest development in a 5-year-old controversy
that so far has prompted two university reviews, numerous congressional
hearings, three lengthy National Institutes of Health investigations and a
national debate about how science should be policed.;    "The draft report, if
it stands without major changes, raises very serious questions about the
veracity of the serological data in the paper," Baltimore said. "Therefore, I
am asking the other authors to join with me in requesting that the journal
retract the paper until such time as the questions are resolved. It is up to
Thereza Imanishi-Kari to resolve them.";    Baltimore had insisted previously
that the charges leveled against Imanishi-Kari were groundless, a conclusion
that had been supported by the three previous scientific reviews of the Cell
paper conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tufts University
and an earlier NIH investigating body.;    Neither Imanishi-Kari nor her
attorney would comment on the report's conclusions.  </TEXT>

   For years, many elite colleges and universities
have cooperated to figure out amounts of financial aid they should
give to students, but now federal antitrust investigators are
investigating the practice.
   Justice Department officials Wednesday acknowledged an
investigation was under way, but refused to disclose details.
   ``Antitrust division investigations are not a matter of public
record,'' agency spokesman David Runkel said.
   Financial aid for college students totaled some $26 billion last
year, said Kathleen Brouder, head of College Scholarship Service
information services in New York.
   She noted that colleges began working together in the 1950s,
when the Soviet-U.S. space race set off a flurry of scholarship,
loan and grant-giving by governments and institutions seeking to
beef up American education.
   The schools' objective has been to avoid bidding wars for
students, Ms. Brouder said.
   ``There was intense bidding, and people were concerned about the
fact that aid might be going in amounts that didn't need to go to
people, and they were very concerned about scarce institutional
resources,'' Ms. Brouder said.
   The Justice Department would not comment on what prompted the
investigation.
   On May 2, The Wall Street Journal reported the practice by 23
elite schools of meeting formally once a year to decide how much
each applicant for aid could afford.
   This is how it hypothetically works: Yale decides the Smiths can
pay $3,000 toward daughter Joan's education. But Dartmouth's aid
formula reckons the Smiths can only afford $2,000. The two schools
then work out the difference until they agree on a figure, say
$2,900. When Joan Smith receives acceptance letters from Yale and
Dartmouth, they both say she can receive financial aid, short of
$2,900.
   This year more than 10,000 high school seniors and their
families were subject to this arrangement, the Journal said.
   Schools named in this practice: Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, the
University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Yale, Amherst, Barnard,
Bowdoin, Bryn Mawr, Colby, Mount Holyoke, Middlebury, Smith,
Trinity, Tufts, Vassar, Wellesley, Wesleyan and Williams.
   Many schools on that list said Wednesday they were not the
subject of an investigation. Others, including Harvard, the
University of Chicago and Tufts University, declined to comment on
how they figure financial aid.
   But William Cotter, president of Colby College in Waterville,
Maine, said the probe appears to revolve around the possible fixing
of salaries, fees, tuition and financial-aid requirements.
   He denied Colby was fixing costs with other schools. ``There is
absolutely no agreement on salary and tuition,'' Cotter said. ``We
compete vigorously with one another for students. We compete
vigorously for faculty.''
   Like other officials at schools contacted, Amherst College
spokeswoman Terry Allen said: ``We believe we are in compliance
with the law. But if it is determined that we are not, we will do
everything to comply.''

   Some 20 prestigious colleges and universities may have violated federal antitrust laws by exchanging certain financial information at meetings that are apparently the target of a Justice Department investigation, antitrust experts and former government officials said. 

   The key to whether antitrust violations could be proven would depend on whether federal prosecutors find that the schools agreed to fix tuition increases for specific years or scholarship amounts for specific students, the antitrust experts said. 
The schools' main justification -- that they exchange certain financial information to avoid an unseemly bidding war for top students -- probably wouldn't carry much weight in court if the government decided to bring suit to block the longstanding practice, the antitrust experts agreed. 

   Moreover, several former government officials said, the fact that the Justice Department is investigating how prices are set in a field not usually viewed as commercial may indicate that prosecutors will enforce antitrust laws more vigorously under the Bush administration than they did under President Reagan. 

   A department spokeswoman confirmed that the antitrust division has sent formal requests for information on tuition and financial-aid practices to "about 20" schools over the past six weeks. 
School officials said in interviews that the targets of the investigation apparently include members of an informal group of 23 prestigious colleges and universities -- including Harvard and other Ivy League schools -- that systematically exchange financial information at a meeting every spring. 
The Washington Post first reported the probe yesterday. 

   Justice Department officials declined to provide details of the investigation but said it is at "a very preliminary" stage. 
The department spokeswoman said the requests sent to the schools "mention the Sherman Act," which prohibits any transaction "in restraint of trade or commerce" and provides for penalties including fines and imprisonment. 

   School officials interviewed yesterday uniformly said that they don't discuss tuition levels until after rates for the coming year have been announced by the individual schools. 

   Tuition increases at most colleges and universities in recent years have run substantially above inflation. 
The College Board, a New York educational association, in figures to be released today, said that tuition at private, four-year colleges will rise an average of 9% for the 1989-90 school year. 
The College Board said total annual costs to students at those institutions, including such items as room and board, will rise to about $14,500. 
Annual costs at the most expensive institutions rose to more than $18,000 this past academic year. 

   Members of the group of 23 elite colleges and universities have previously acknowledged that for the past 35 years their representatives have met annually to share information on common applicants seeking financial aid. 
As a result of this process, many students receive financial-aid offers from a number of the participating schools that require identical out-of-pocket expenses to be paid by the applicants or their families. 

   In addition to Harvard, the other 22 schools that meet every spring are: Amherst College; Barnard College; Bowdoin College; Brown University; Bryn Mawr College; Colby College; Columbia University; Cornell University; Dartmouth College; Mount Holyoke College; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Middlebury College; the University of Pennsylvania; Princeton University; Smith College; Trinity College; Tufts University; Vassar College; Wellesley College; Wesleyan University; Williams College; and Yale University. 

   Of that group, Amherst, Bowdoin, Colby, Harvard and Tufts have received investigative letters from the Justice Department, officials at the schools said. 
Officials at Wellesley, MIT, Princeton and Yale said they hadn't received the requests for information as of yesterday. 
At least one school not in the group, the University of Chicago, has also received a Justice Department request, suggesting that the inquiry may go beyond the spring meeting of the 23 schools. 

   The schools have contended that sharing financial information is proper because federal statutes establish a basic formula for determining applicants' financial need for scholarships. 
The schools have said they discuss why, using the same formula, they frequently come up with different assessments of what a family can afford. 
The goal, according to university officials, is to make sure that scholarships are based only on need and to prevent schools from bidding against each other for talented applicants. 

   "The intent is to . . . take the financial-aid decision out of the running as a factor," when students choose a college, a Bowdoin spokesman said. 

   In its requests, the Justice Department asked schools for a broad array of information on tuition, financial aid and faculty salaries, from 1985 to now, school officials said. 
Officials at Amherst, Harvard and Tufts all said they believe their practices are in compliance with the law. 

   Antitrust experts said the mere exchange of price or scholarship information among schools wouldn't necessarily be illegal. 
But if the exchange were accompanied by evidence that the schools had agreed to offer uniform financial-aid packages to particular students or to fix tuition increases, "that would be a traditional antitrust violation," said Irving Scher, a New York lawyer who heads the American Bar Association's antitrust section. 

   Although they aren't normally viewed as the sort of businesses regulated by antitrust laws, colleges and universities "are to some extent selling a product -- education -- with a price -- tuition," said Phillip Areeda, an antitrust professor at Harvard Law School.

<HEAD>Soviet, U.S. Students Discuss Nuclear Arms In Television Link-up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There were differences in culture and style in a
television linkup between Soviet and American students and
scholars, but the students and 10 panelists agreed that the two
countries are making progress in breaking down barriers.
   The two-hour forum Saturday joined 350 undergraduates at Tufts
University's downtown campus with 200 Moscow State University
students.
   Not accustomed to the American style of TV answers, the Soviets
often strayed from the questioning and read prepared speeches
detailing minor points in Soviet nuclear history.
   At one juncture, Soviet moderator Yevgeny P. Velikhov said,
``It's a lecture. We have to teach the students something here.''
   Andrey Kokoshin, deputy director of the Institute for U.S.A. and
Canada, told a U.S. questioner the superpowers are moving past Cold
War tensions to begin ``to clear off layers of mutual fears.''
   ``It seems to me what we are doing now in a first step to
disarmament should create a new basis, a new faith to increase
trust in each other,'' Kokoshin said.
   The satellite-relayed ``space bridge'' forum was the first of
three between Tufts and Moscow State on the nuclear arms race and
Cold War politics. The sessions are part of a course devised by
Tufts professor Martin J. Sherwin.
   The panel included two Americans who worked on the top-secret
Manhattan Project that developed the first atomic bomb in 1945, and
a Soviet researcher who helped build that country's first nuclear
weapon in 1949.
   Students and scientists frequently interrupted each other with
applause, the loudest when Sherwin praised Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's efforts to ease nuclear tensions.
   ``I think there's not a single person here who thinks he will be
able to survive a nuclear bomb,'' said Alexei Milayev, a Soviet
physics student. ``We are gathered here in the final analysis to
think about what must be done to prevent a nuclear war.''
   Velikhov, vice president for physics and mathematics for the
Soviet Academy of Sciences, noted the forum came 40 years after the
U.N. Committee on Atomic Energy abandoned its effort to ban nuclear
weapons.
   ``Today we are at the first stages of a non-nuclear world,'' he
said. Velikhov said the recent superpower arms reduction treaty
signed in December ``is the first encouraging step. We believe, in
a new international situation, we will succceed in resolving the
question.''
   Mark Anstendig, 21, a Tufts junior history major from Edgemont,
N.Y., said afterward the forum went a long way to promoting better
understanding.
   ``I think there was good rapport on both sides,'' he said.
``It'll promote better feelings. I think it's a good microcosm of
what could happen.''

   A scientist won't testify at a Congressional panel
investigating accusations that she falsified data in a genetics
research paper she had written with a Nobel Prize-winner, her
attorney said Friday.
   ``She feels very much hounded ... by an unwarranted intervention
and intrusion by the government into the scientific process,'' said
Bruce A. Singal, attorney for Dr. Thereza Imanishi-Kari of Tufts
University.
   Imanishi-Kari is declining to testify Monday before a House
subcommittee reviewing charges she misrepresented research reported
in a 1986 article published in the scientific journal Cell.
   The committee's investigation has focused on forensic studies
performed on Imanishi-Kari's notebooks by Secret Service
specialists who allegedly found as many as 40 pages were prepared
up to two years after their recorded dates.
   Monday's hearing also was scheduled to examine a May 4 forensics
study that suggests the Boston pathologist made fraudulent tape
recordings to support the paper, which was researched at Tufts and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   ``This a case study of how institutions respond or don't respond
... when there are questions or allegations about the quality or
accuracy or integrity of research,'' said Dennis Fitzgibbons, a
spokesman for the subcommittee.
   The Congressional investigation began in 1986 after a former MIT
researcher charged she could not duplicate the published study,
which examined the immune cells in genetically altered mice.
   Investigations were conducted by both MIT and Tufts, where
Imanishi-Kari now works, but both schools reported the research
required no corrections.
   The National Institutes of Health also has investigated the
charges, but Singal said his client would not cooperate unless the
panel detailed the allegations against her.
   ``This is becoming an annual rite of spring, being invited back
to the Dingell committee every May,'' Singal said.
   Imanishi-Kari testified a year ago before the House Subcommittee
on Oversight and Investigations chaired by Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich.
   At that time, she told the committee that her notebooks had
nothing to do with the published experiments and showed only that
``I am not a neat person.''
   David Baltimore, an MIT molecular biologist and co-author of the
study, has joined other scientists backing Imanishi-Kari's claim
that the notebook had no bearing on the work.
   ``It is apparent that, after years of investigation, a
reasonable person must conclude that the Cell paper was an honest
report of collaborative research,'' said Baltimore, a 1975 Nobel
laureate who has been named president of Rockefeller University in
New York.
   In a letter sent Thursday to Dingell, Singal said the latest
hearings were ``nothing more than a rehash'' that his client would
decline to attend.
   ``We frankly do not understand why this same set of so-called
findings is now being recycled one year later,'' Singal wrote. ``It
is as insignificant and irrelevant now as it was a year ago to any
legitimate scientific issue.''
   Singal said the Secret Service report issued May 4, and made
public by his client Thursday, contained ``deficiencies and
omissions which ... preclude the possibility of any meaningful
response at this time.''
   He said Imanishi-Kari would be willing to respond to the charges
her tapes were fraudulent after more information and clarification
of the charges was made available.
   Fitzgibbons declined to elaborate on the report, which was to be
the subject of Secret Service testimony Monday.

<HEAD>Back to Basics for Good Nutrition and Weight Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tufts University President Jean Mayer, one of
the nation's best-known nutritionists, has taken much of the
confusion out of eating well and losing weight.
   ``Dr. Jean Mayer's Diet &amp; Nutrition Guide,'' written with Jeanne
P. Goldberg, provides a compact and generally sensible path for
children and adults, but is somewhat disorganized and fairly
conservative.
   Mayer and Goldberg, a Tufts School of Nutrition professor, are
widely known for their newspaper column ``Food for Thought,''
written in a question-and-answer format. The same device is used in
the book, at the end of each chapter, which can make information
hard to find.
   For example, yogurt is discussed both in the main section of a
chapter that inclues adapting recipes to make them healthier and in
the question-and-answer section at the end of the chapter.
   With the plethora of diet plans available and labels on food
difficult to decipher, consumers need someone to cut a path through
it all. And Mayer and Goldberg offer reasonable advice and clear
explanations.
   Their book includes information on preventing food poisoning,
eating well in restaurants, vitamins and minerals, food
requirements at different ages and for those with various health
problems or conditions, and how to lose weight sensibly.
   That Americans are doing a poor job of feeding themselves seems
clear.
   ``You would probably think it outrageous if we suggested that
our paleolithic ancestors crouching in their caves may have been
routinely eating a better diet than do many Americans today,'' the
authors say.
   It need not be the case, and beginning with a tour of the
supermarket, the authors warn that shoppers' best nutritional
interests are not always served by marketing professionals.
   Overall, Mayer and Goldberg recommend a low-fat diet consisting
of foods either fresh or lightly processed, passing by many of the
prepared foods that have come on the market in the five decades
since the opening of the first supermarket, a King Kullen in New
York.
   They warn about tricky food labels: An ounce of all sorts of
cereals may have the same number of calories, but an ounce of corn
flakes is about a cup, while an ounce of granola may be just
one-quarter cup. Manufacturers are not required to use comparable
serving sizes, and many foods have no nutrition labeling at all.
   But while the authors note that labels can be vague about the
types of fats used, they do not point out that because
manufacturers must list ingredients in descending order by weight,
various kinds of sugar won't appear all together; shoppers should
beware of how they add up.
   There is plenty of information in the book on what various terms
on labels mean; how to get enough protein, even in a vegetarian
diet, without eating too much fat; how to adjust favorite receipes.
   Weight-loss advice is simple and traditional: Eat fewer
calories, generally by cutting fats and sugar, and exercise more. A
month's worth of menus is included.
   Where government scientists or agencies clash with other groups,
the book tends to be conservative. For example, on pesticides, it
repeats old arguments about toxins that naturally occur in foods
and concludes, ``But when you mesh all these factors together, and
weigh the risks and benefits, a general outcry against pesticides
is unwarranted.''
   With almost half the restaurant dollars going to fast-food
outlets, the appendix listing the calorie, salt and fat content of
fast-food items from three chains is very useful.
   ``Dr. Jean Mayer's Diet and Nutrition Guide'' is being published
in April by Pharos Books.

   The New England Journal of Medicine is considered one of
the most influential medical journals. Dr. Relman, during his
14 years at the Journal's helm, was known for helping to set
the national medical agenda by taking strong positions on
issues such as medical quality versus health-care cost
containment.
   Dr. Kassirer, who received his medical degree at the State
University of New York in Buffalo, is known for work on how
doctors make decisions when treating patients. At Tufts, he
is vice chairman of the department of medicine and has
received eight outstanding-teaching awards. "His style is
nonconfrontational," said a physician acquainted with Dr.
Kassirer. "I expect him to deal with issues in a firm and
open manner."

   You may know that raw pork is not safe, or that a bulging can
spells trouble. But how aware are you of the safety of other items
in your kitchen? Take this quiz to find out.
   Is it safe or risky to eat ...
   1. Hot dogs that have been stored in an unopened package in the
refrigerator for 10 days?
   2. A bruised or moldy piece of fruit?
   3. Frozen ham that was thawed on the counter?
   4. An unopened jar of mayonnaise that has been in the
refrigerator for six months?
   5. A baked potato left out on the counter from the night before?
   6. Meat loaf that's pink in the middle after cooking?
   7. Raw ground beef that turns brown after a day or two of
refrigeration?
   8. An uncooked potato with a greenish cast?
   9. Lettuce or other produce moistened by poultry drippings in a
grocery bag?
   10. Steak that was thawed in the refrigerator and then refrozen?
   11. Cooked shrimp that was never deveined?
   12. Mustard or ketchup with a black, crusty ring around the rim
of the jar?
   13. Moldy or shriveled peanuts?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ANSWERS
   1. Safe. Hot dogs that come in vacuum-sealed packages can be
kept in the refrigerator for up to two weeks. Once opened, you can
keep them for about seven days, carefully wrapped in plastic.
   2. Safe if it's just bruised. But possibly risky if the bruised
portion has become moldy. Some molds can produce harmful toxins,
and it's not yet clear whether fruit molds are among them. The best
bet is to cut away the moldy section, which should also remove any
toxins that might be pesent.
   3. Risky. Many people think they can take chances with ham
because it has been smoked or salted. But these processes don't
make the meat immune to bacterial contamination, especially since a
number of manufacturers are lowering the salt content of cured
meats. As with any meat, the safest way to thaw ham is in the
refrigerator.
   4. Safe. It's a misconception that foods prepared with
mayonnaise may go bad sooner. In fact, its high acid and salt
content may actually inhibit bacterial growth somewhat. You can
keep an opened jar of mayonnaise in the refrigerator for up to a
year, provided you don't let it sit at room temperature for
extended periods.
   5. Risky. We usually don't think of potatoes as a likely source
of food poisoning, but there have been reports of deadly botulism
in people who ate foil-wrapped baked potatoes left at room
temperature for a day or more, even when they were reheated.
Leftovers of most foods should be promptly refrigerated.
   6. Risky. Ground meat undergoes a great deal of handling,
compared to other forms. This increases the likelihood of bacterial
contamination. For this reason, the USDA suggests cooking meat loaf
until it is brown or at least brownish-pink in the center. An even
better guide is to cook it to an internal temperature of 170
degrees Fahrenheit, cheching with a thermometer, particularly if
the meat loaf contains pork.
   7. Safe. Whether it's brown or pink has to do with the amount of
oxygen with which it has come into contact. As a general rule,
however, don't keep raw ground beef in the refrigerator longer than
two days, and don't use it under any circumstances if it doesn't
smell right or was left unrefrigerated for any length of time.
   8. Risky. Green-skinned potatoes contain a chemical called
solanine, which can cause gastrointestinal illness. You can use
green potatoes if you peel them well and remove a layer of flesh
underneath the skin.
   9. Risky. Uncooked poultry juices may contain harmful bacteria
that could lead to trouble when they get into foods that are eaten
raw. If the produce is really saturated, you'd better not use it.
But if contact was minimal, you can remove outer sections or rinse
and peel.
   10. Safe _ especially if some ice crystals remain. Make sure to
thaw the frozen meat in the refrigerator the second time around. Be
aware, too, that refreezing might cause flavor and texture
deterioration. You might get better flavor and texture if you cook
the meat the first time it is thawed, then refreeze it.
   11. Safe. You can eat shrimp that hasn't been deveined as long
as you cook it. The black line running down the back is actually
the intestines of the shrimp, which are more susceptible to
contamination.
   12. Safe. The ring is the result of an interaction of the
contents with air, not a sign of spoilage. Simply wipe it off and
use the remaining contents.
   13. Risky. When you crack open peanut shells only to find sickly
looking nuts, don't eat them. The types of mold that grow on nuts
(as well as on grains) can produce aflatoxins, some of which are
very potent carcinogens.

<TEXT>
   Product directions often seem simple.
``Press firmly'' is a typical instruction. But how firmly?
   Design engineers at Tufts University are researching ways to
make such orders more specific.
   They began after learning that owners of homes with a certain
kind of gas valve were asked to test them by pressing a knob firmly
without forcing it; with no more than those directions, the owners
were expected to determine whether their valves were defective and
possibly dangerous.
   ``The goal of the research is the ability to craft phrases that
will produce well-defined physical responses,'' said Professor John
G. Kreifeldt.
   A graduate student in design engineering at Tufts, Kodali V.N.
Rao, developed an experiment to see if product directions could be
made more simple.
   ``From nail polish to computers, cameras to hair sprays and
toasters to tanks, the designer needs to be well-informed about the
consequences resulting from use or misuse of the product,'' said
Rao. ``As designers, we have to decide that a switch should work
with a certain amount of force.''
   But how does one go about communicating that, he wondered.
   In his research, he asked about 240 people to squeeze a device
attached to a meter, either gently or hard.
   The results varied considerably. The instruction ``firm''
covered a range of two kilograms to 32 kilograms of force.
   The project's most surprising result: when the instructions were
changed to ``squeeze not very hard and not too gently,'' the test
participants were remarkably consistent. Ninety percent of the
participants applied 12.9 to 14.6 kilograms of force.
   Rao said that the word ``not'' in instructions causes people to
be more cautious about how much pressure they exert.
   ``Force is a perceivable thing that people can use through
experience,'' said Rao. ``One thing is sure: one-word instructions
don't convey enough information. If you say `Do this,' people tend
to get carried away by presuppositions, so it is important to give
users parameters.''

   Kathy Foster, a third-year student at Tufts
University School of Medicine, was caring for a 10-year-old boy
with cancer last year when she noticed his depression over being
tutored while other youngsters were out playing.
   ``I thought, that's something medical students could do _ help
kids with their school work while they're at the hospital
undergoing chemotherapy,'' said Foster in an interview Saturday.
   Foster organized a group called Kids in Chemotherapy Support
(KICS) and passed out a questionnaire to other students to find out
how many might want to donate their time. She was amazed by the
response _ more than 75 Tufts medical students signed up.
   In order to link young cancer patients with medical students,
Foster contacted Dr. Lawrence Wolfe, assistant professor of
pediatrics at Tufts Medical School and chief of pediatric
hematology-oncology at the New England Medical Center. So far,
seven KICS students and patients have been matched.
   The program is similar to the Big Brother-Big Sister
organization. But the medical students help the children through
the kind of difficulties most kids fortunately don't face.
   ``The older kids are really concerned about their appearance,
such as hair loss or being too thin. Or their faces may be swollen
from steroids,'' said Foster.
   Students learn to help the kids cope with their problems
cautiously.
   ``You can't just come right out and ask them how they feel about
losing their hair,'' she said. ``But after playing a board game
with them four or five times, a lot of kids will confide in you and
say they're afraid of cancer.''
   Many children spend their eight hours of chemotherapy in the
hospital alone, with family or friends. Foster said she is helping
a 15-year-old Vietnamese girl who has Oriental cholangitis, a rare
gastrointestinal disorder. The girl lives with her grandmother and
other relatives, who attach a social stigman to her illness, Foster
said.
   Chris Aho, spokeswoman for the medical school, said school
officials were surprised at the number of students who signed up
for the program.
   ``Part of it is they're so anxious to be with patients,'' said
Aho. ``They want to help so much. They're looking for that
humanitarian aspect in people.''
   The students and the children often go on group outings. Last
spring, they attended a Red Sox baseball game at Fenway Park. The
highlight of the game, said Foster, wsa watching seven-year-old
Derek Walsh, a KICS child, enjoy the game.
   Walsh had a Wilms's tumor on his kidney but following surgery
and chemotherapy, he is cancer-free at this point. He was strong
enough to play baseball this spring.
   Foster said many of the students have formed close bonds with
their young friends and their families.
   ``When you are assigned to a child, you have that childthe whole
time they are undergoing chemotherapy,'' said Foster. ``Some
parents have even invited students over for dinner. The students
involved in these programs just love it. They wouldn't give it up
for anything.''

   MEDFORD, Mass. -- Scientists at Tufts University here
developed a hair-thin fiber optic sensor for threading into
arteries to detect levels of various blood components.
   The device represents a potentially important step toward
a long-sought goal in medicine -- continuous monitoring of
acidity, oxygen and other crucial substances in the blood.
Such monitors could give physicians early warning of
impending crises in critically ill patients or in patients
undergoing surgery. The devices also someday may be used in
automated systems that release drugs into the body in doses
precisely controlled to yield desired therapeutic benefits
and minimize side effects.

   Blood tests now typically require medical workers to draw
blood into tubes for analyzing in remote laboratories, a
process that can take minutes to hours. The method can lead
to errors from naturally occurring changes in the chemistry
of blood as it is moved, from contamination of the equipment
it touches and from mixups in handling.
   During the past few years, bedside blood analyzers have
been developed to speed measurements of certain blood
components. But these devices require extracting blood
samples from patients, hence still have time-delay and other
drawbacks compared with the continuous, inside-the-body
monitoring envisioned with fiber optic devices. Some 10 to 12
companies "have serious high-dollar projects" to develop such
continuous monitors, said Stephen Shapiro, a medical devices
specialist at Wilkerson Group Inc., a medical industry
consulting firm in New York.
   In a report in today's issue of the journal Nature, the
Tufts researchers said they developed a prototype sensor
system consisting of a light-analyzing device connected to a
single optical fiber that is designed to be threaded into an
artery through a needle. The fiber, made of light-conducting
strands of glass or plastic, has multiple specks of
"indicator" chemicals on its tip. The indicators are special
dyes through which light beams are passed; the intensity of
the light emitted varies with the level of selected chemicals
with which the dyes are in contact.
   The device works by sending light through the fiber to its
sensing tip. A camera-like device then measures light that
returns through the fiber after passing through one of the
dyes.
   The prototype measures acidity and carbon dioxide, said
David Walt, one of the Tufts researchers. The scientists
expect soon to add a third indicator dye to measure oxygen,
he added. Later they hope to add indicators for electrolytes
such as sodium, for enzymes released into the blood when a
heart attack is starting and for other substances. Outside
experts said the Tufts device appears to be the first sensor
that can register multiple substances with a single optical
fiber -- potentially making it cheaper, simpler to
manufacture and easier to get into arteries than alternative
sensors being developed.
   Dr. Walt, a chemist, cautioned that several major problems
still must be solved to use such devices for continuous blood
monitoring over several days. One is finding a way to prevent
clots that occur when foreign materials contact the blood.
Another issue is sensor stability-indictor dyes tend to get
bleached out over time, making their signals fade.
   Dr. Walt added that several companies have "approached us"
regarding development of the device for medical or other uses
-- such as monitoring toxic chemicals during environmental
cleanups -- but declined to disclose their names. He
estimated that a marketable sensor costing several thousand
dollars might be developed in five years or so.

   Michael Dukakis boosted economic
nationalism while tossing barbs at his Republican opponents
Tuesday, promising as president to restore American leadership in
science and technology and translate that into dominance of global
markets.
   Dukakis said that he and Democratic running mate Lloyd Bentsen
would be aggressive advocates for U.S. companies and workers while
Republican George Bush was ``satisfied with today and complacent
about tomorrow.''
   Dukakis delighted the partisan crowd at Tufts University with
new salvos at the GOP ticket, saying the ``Republican campaign song
seems to be, `Don't Worry; Be Happy,''' a tune played at a recent
Bush event.
   ``I want us to be happy, but I also want us to be concerned,''
Dukakis said. Then, lashing out at the bottom half of the
Republican ticket, he added: ``Dan Quayle asks us to believe that
if he ever had to fill in for George Bush, America could get by on
a right wing and a prayer.''
   Dukakis ticked off a six-point plan aimed at improving U.S.
science teaching and technology as well as product development. And
he spoke of the ``new economic patriotism'' that has become a
staple of his attempt to win support from blue-collar workers and
middle class voters concerned about their jobs and effects of the
federal budget and trade deficits.
   ``We have a choice,'' Dukakis said. ``Will we keep running in
place or will we forge ahead? Will the future belong to our
competitors, or to us? Will we sell out more and more of our land
and our factories and our banks, or will we take charge of our
future?''
   ``Together we can build a future where the best products in the
world are designed by American minds, built by American hands and
produce good profits and good paychecks here on American soil,'' he
said.
   Bush, meanwhile, in a speech prepared for delivery to college
students in Seattle, accused Dukakis of ``protectionist
demagoguery'' in his criticism of foreign ownership of U.S.
businesses.
   ``My opponent needs an issue, and he's willing to scare people
to find it,'' Bush said.
   Dukakis, on another subject, also appeared on national
television to denounce what he called the ``crass and cynical''
campaign tactics of Bush in connection with attacks on Dukakis as
soft on crime. In addition, he attended a breakfast with Vietnam
veterans and recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor and
spent several hours preparing for his second and final debate with
Bush Thursday night in Los Angeles.
   Dukakis was flying to California later Tuesday.
   At Tufts University, about two dozen Bush supporters gathered
outside and chanted ``Bush '88'' as Dukakis arrived and left.
   Inside, Dukakis declared, ``If we can build the greatest
spaceship the world has ever seen, then we ought to be able to
build the televisions and the VCRs that compete and that win in
foreign markets.''
   The six points discussed by Dukakis, most of them proposals he
has touched on earlier in the campaign, include:
   _Having the National Science Foundation issue annual,
state-by-state reports on the quality of science education.
   _Establishing seminars to help science instructors improve their
teaching.
   _Calling on scientists and engineers, including retirees, to
teach classes.
   _Persuading industry to set up worksite technology training and
retraining centers.
   _A nationwide network of centers of excellence modeled after
state programs designed to foster research and new product
development.
   _Cooperation between U.S. companies in advanced technologies
such as superconductivity and consumer electronics.
   ``We need a commander in chief who stands up and fights for
American companies, American products and American jobs,'' said
Dukakis, who said Bentsen would be his top deputy in the trade war.
``I want us to begin selling cars and computers and compact discs
to the Germans and the Japanese and the Koreans, not arms to the
ayatollah.''
   Dukakis also joked about his ``October surprise,'' a speech last
week in which he warned against growing foreign investment in the
United States only to find out after the speech that the company at
which he sounded the warning was owned by an Italian firm.
   ``I'm not against foreign ownership,'' Dukakis said after making
light of his mistake. ``I'm against the policies that make us
dependent. I'm against a fire sale of America.''
   During the morning telvision appearance Dukakis appeared upbeat
about the debate and repeated his contention that Bush was
exploiting a tragedy involving a Massachusetts furlough program for
political gain because of Bush's own failure as the Reagan
administration's point man on crime and drugs.
   Speaking on NBC's ``Today'' program, he denounced Bush for
repeatedly detailing the violent assault of a Maryland couple by a
murderer who escaped while on a Massachusetts furlough.
   ``To use these human tragedies for your own political purposes,
I think, is really a very crass and cynical thing,'' said Dukakis,
who said similar tragedies have occurred in the federal furlough
program and in one Ronald Reagan supported while governor of
California.

   A noted pediatrician says his patients will
suffer and die because of attacks by a powerful congressman on the
work of a Nobel Prize-winning researcher.
   ``I can promise you that organizations of patients, when made
fully aware of what you are doing, are going to fight this tooth
and nail,'' Dr. David Nathan wrote to Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
   Nathan is physician-in-chief at Children's Hospital in Boston
and professor of pediatrics at the Harvard Medical School.
   Dingell, chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, spent most of Thursday in a
hearing room attacking the handling of a dispute over a research
project led by David Baltimore, a molecular biologist at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology who won the Nobel Prize in
1975 for his work on cancer-causing viruses.
   ``An attack on him is an attack on our patients. ... The David
Baltimores of this world have made it possible for them to live. It
is as simple as that,'' Nathan wrote in his April 26 letter, which
was distributed at the hearing.
   Nathan's letter appeared to be part of a growing effort by
scientists to defend Baltimore. The journal Science reported last
week, for example, that major figures in science were in touch with
minority Republican members of the subcommittee.
   A review committee is being reconstituted to look into new
allegations of missing data raised by Dr. Margot O'Toole, said
James Wyngaarden, director of the National Institutes of Health.
   Dr. O'Toole's dispatch of 17 pages of data to two NIH staffers
in 1986 started the long controversy over a paper in the scientific
journal Cell that year by Baltimore, Dr. Thereza Imanishi-Kari of
Tufts University and four others.
   Dr. O'Toole, at the time working on other projects in Dr.
Imanishi-Kari's lab, said the 17 pages showed that conclusions of
the paper were not supported by the original laboratory data.
   Reviews by MIT and Tufts determined that the conclusions,
dealing with the immune responses of mice bred with an extra immune
system gene from another species, were fully supported by some
1,000 data pages and no action was needed.
   A review panel convened by NIH, the one now being resurrected,
said that although there was no fraud or misrepresentation, errors
had occurred that should be corrected. Baltimore has sent one
correction letter to Cell and is preparing a supplemental letter to
deal with the latest accusation.
   A report from Secret Service experts said at least five and
possibly 25 pages in one of Dr. Imanishi-Kari's notebooks were
filled in as much as two years after the dates on the page. At
least two dates were changed.
   The two notebooks studied by the Secret Service had nothing to
do with the Cell article and showed only ``I am not a neat person
... very bad with dates,'' she said.
   She said she would often use the date on which data were taken,
perhaps logged by laboratory equipment, when writing them on paper
months later.
   Wyngaarden said he was establishing an Office of Scientific
Integrity to monitor and conduct investigations of possible
scientific impropriety. The Health and Human Services Department is
establishing an Office of Scientific Integrity Review to establish
policies to deal with scientific misconduct.

90-YEAR-OLDS SHOW GAINS IN WEIGHT-TRAINING STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
At an age when most of their contemporaries are worrying about simply keeping 
their blood pumping through their veins, 90-year-olds in a nursing home in 
Boston have been pumping iron. 
</P>
<P>
The frail, institutionalized men and women have undertaken regular weight 
training to improve their strength and mobility and thereby reduce their 
susceptibility to injury in falls and accidents. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the six women and four men in the original pilot program improved their 
strength threefold to fourfold over an eight-week period, and all except one 
who dropped out because of a previous hernia are "stronger than they had been 
many years previously," physicians from Tufts University report today in the 
Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the patients who walked with a cane at the beginning of the program can 
now manage without it, one can rise from a chair without using his arms for the 
first time in years, and five of them walk 50% faster. All are more mobile, 
have better balance and have suffered fewer falls since the training began, 
said geriatrician Maria A. Fiatarone of the U.S. Department of Agriculture 
Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
"The importance of this study is that it shows that, even at a very advanced 
age, physical frailty is treatable," said Evan C. Hadley, chief of the 
geriatric branch at the National Institute on Aging. "This could greatly reduce 
the need for nursing home admissions by maintaining the mobility of older 
people and thus their ability to live independently." 
</P>
<P>
According to census figures, more than 3.5 million Americans are over the age 
of 85 and 1 million are over 90. 
</P>
<P>
The study was so successful, Fiatarone said in a telephone interview, that the 
pilot trials have now been extended to about 30 additional people, one of whom 
is 100 years old, at the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for Aged, and the first 
subjects have been enrolled in a continuing weight-training program. 
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the positive results from this pilot study, the National 
Institute on Aging and the National Center for Nursing Research have awarded 
$2.9 million to the Hebrew Center and seven other institutions for further 
studies on this and other interventions for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
"The exciting results from this study really served as an impetus for 
developing the (Frailty and Injuries: Cooperative Studies of Intervention 
Techniques) research project," Hadley said. 
</P>
<P>
The 10 people in the original program ranged in age from 86 to 96, with an 
average of 90. They had an average of 4.5 chronic diseases and had been 
institutionalized for an average of 3.4 years. Eight had a history of falls and 
seven habitually used a cane or walker. 
</P>
<P>
The subjects used a resistance training device. Sitting in a chair, they raised 
one leg at a time to lift a weight. At the beginning of the study, they could 
lift 17 pounds per leg on average. By the end, they could lift an average of 45 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
That response, Fiatarone and her colleagues wrote, "is remarkable in light of 
their very advanced age, extremely sedentary habits, multiple chronic disease 
and functional disabilities and nutritional inadequacies." 
</P>
<P>
Fiatarone emphasized that, like younger people, the patients lost some of their 
gains if they stopped exercising. When the subjects were assessed four weeks 
after the end of the pilot test, they had lost 30% of the strength they gained. 
Most went back to exercising.

dramatically lowered the blood pressure of those whose blood pressure was
mildly elevated.;    "In terms of exercise's beneficial effects, more intense
exercise is not necessarily better," wrote Linda S. Pescatello, an exercise
physiologist at the university in Farmington, Conn. The study appears in the

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is asking several
prestigious universities for documents as part of an antitrust
investigation into how they set tuition and student aid rates,
officials say.
   The department, while declining to discuss the thrust of the
investigation, acknowledged that it is seeking certain documents.
   Daniel Steiner, general counsel at Harvard University, said the
request was for documents dealing with ``student financial aid,
budgeting and other fees and salaries.''
   Jonathan Kleinbard, vice president for news and community
affairs at the University of Chicago said today that his
institution was cooperating with a Justice Department request ``for
information concerning the procedures by which it establishes its
tuition.''
   ``Specifically, the ... department is interested in whether
institutions of higher education have entered into arrangements or
understandings as to prospective tuition rates that may violate
federal antitrust laws,'' he said.
   ``At no time has the University of Chicago participated in any
agreement or understanding with any other institution as to the
setting of its tuition,'' Kleinbard said. When asked about possible
agreements relating to financial aid, he said, ``We don't do it _
pure and simple.''
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel confirmed that
document requests ``have gone out to a number of colleges,'' but he
declined to disclose the subjects of the request.
   ``Antitrust division investigations are not a matter of public
record,'' he said.
   ``You can say this is in a preliminary stage,'' Runkel said,
adding that the first requests were made ``sometime earlier this
summer, perhaps six weeks ago.''
   ``Essentially, they've asked us to produce a lot of documents
with regard to our budget, how we budget,'' Richard Mersereau, a
spokesman for Brunswick, Maine's Bowdoin College, told The
Associated Press. ``It's an extensive amount of documentation, and
we are complying.''
   Universities have shared financial information about students
for years, even arranging to use copies of a single financial
statement submitted by parents of applicants seeking scholarships
and other aid.
   There have been reports that major universities agree among
themselves on the aid packages to be offered, generally mixtures of
scholarships, loans and campus jobs. Such agreements, if they
exist, would be of interest to the antitrust division, which
enforces the legal ban against price-fixing by private commercial
companies.
   There are well-known aid agreements among universities, such as
limits on athletic scholarships that members of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association may offer. Members of the Ivy
League have agreed not to offer athletic scholarships and to base
offers of financial aid on student need.
   Harvard's Steiner declined to say whether cooperating
universities agree on aid packages to be offered to applicants.
   The Washington Post said in today's editions the department's
requests had gone to 20 institutions, among them Harvard, Colby,
Amherst, Williams and Bowdoin colleges, Tufts and Wesleyan
universities and the University of Chicago.
   Harvard ``will be cooperating with the Justice Department in
giving them the data they've requested,'' Steiner said.
   At neighboring Tufts University in Medford, Mass., spokeswoman
Rosemarie Van Camp said, ``We will cooperate fully with the Justice
Department.''
   Colby spokesman Edward Hershey also confirmed that the school
had been served and had turned the matter over to counsel.
   ``They have asked for certain documents and we will, I'm sure,
attempt to respond appropriately,'' he said.

   Dr. Priscilla White, whose research
sharply increased the survival rate of babies born to diabetic
women, died at age 89 after a long illness.
   White died Saturday at her home in this Boston suburb, according
to a statement from the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston.
   Her studies identified ways to decrease the risk of maternal and
child death in pregnancies complicated by diabetes, the statement
said.
   White's research and the treatment process she developed
increased the fetal survival rate around the country from 54
percent in the 1920s to about 97 percent in the late 1970s and
1980s, it said.
   Born in Boston, White attended Radcliffe College and graduated
third in her class from Tufts University Medical School in 1923.
   She joined a diabetes practice headed by Elliott P. Joslin, and
in 1924 became the youngest member of the team that established the
clinic now known as the Joslin Diabetes Center.
   White taught at Harvard Medical School and was an assistant
professor of medicine at Tufts. She received numerous honors, and
was the first woman to receive the Banting Medal, the American
Diabetes Association's highest scientific award.
   In her research, White found that a fetus of a diabetic mother
often would be healthy a month before delivery but would die if
allowed to go full term. She concluded that babies of diabetic
women should be delivered by Caesarean section at eight months.
   She gradually discovered that babies could remain in the womb an
extra week to develop. She also learned that although infants of
diabetic mothers usually are normal or larger than normal in size
despite premature birth, they require the same special care needed
for premature infants.

   Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Seymour
Hersh is coming ``because you don't normally get this interesting
mix of people.'' Former CIA director William Colby will attend
``because I think someone needs to say a few good words about the
agency.''
   Hersh and Colby are among more than 30 experts and commentators
who plan to meet Friday at Tufts University for a two-day forum on
the role of covert aid and secrecy in U.S. foreign policy.
   The panelists include former and current members of the
intelligence community, military and defense officials,
journalists, educators and legal specialists. They represent
opinions ``from the left, right and center of the ideological
spectrum,'' forum coordinator Sherman Teichman said Thursday.
   Teichman said the conference, sponsored jointly by Tufts, the
National Security Archive, the U.S. Department of Defense and the
Center for the Study of Covert Action, will address more than such
obvious examples of covert action as the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``It is important to ask if the use of covert actions is a
necessary part of dealing with foreign governments,'' he said. ``If
it is a necessary evil and used to influence others to our way of
thinking, then how does a democracy justify its actions?''
   Topics at the forum include ``The Southeast Asian Experience: A
Case Study''; ``Lessons of Vietnam and Southeast Asia for the
1980s''; ``The Iran-Contra Affair: The Hostage Ransom, Iran-Israel
Arms Sale''; and ``Contra Support: Managing and Supplying a
Paramilitary Operation.''
   Also scheduled to attend are Bob Woodward of the Washington
Post; ``Pentagon Papers'' leaker Daniel Ellsberg; Thomas Polgar, a
former CIA station chief in Saigon; former Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton
of Missouri; and Scott Armstrong, executive director of the
National Security Archive.
   ``It seems like a rather contentious group of people,'' said
Colby, now an attorney in Washington, D.C. Colby said he will
defend his opinion that ``covert action is a regular part of
American foreign policy. It's perfectly compatible with American
democracy.''
   Eagleton has prepared a paper reviewing the history of
congressional oversight of covert activities. He said the symposium
is particularly timely because of a pending Senate bill that would
plug loopholes in existing laws that allowed the Reagan
administration not to notify Congress at the time of the Iran arms
deal.
   ``There can be a time and circumstances where covert action is
clearly in the American interest,'' said Eagleton. ``But the
question is: Under what conditions of shared knowledge does our
government undertake covert action?''
   Hersh, with tongue slightly in cheek, said he has split views on
the need for covert operations.
   ``I have mixed feelings about it because on one hand, people
like me get to write books on it and make a lot of money,'' he
said. ``On the other hand, I don't see, especially when you're
talking about things like Chile, what (secret actions) have done
for the American people.''

   The National Institutes of Health and two
congressional panels are about to launch investigations into
charges that a molecular biology manuscript written by a Nobel
laureate and his colleagues misrepresented research data.
   An official at the NIH said a special committee has been named
to review allegations of scientific misconduct involving a study on
duplicating immunity cells in laboratory mice. The project was
headed by Nobel laureate David Baltimore, director of the Whitehead
Institute in Boston, and Theresa Imanishi-Kari of Tufts University.
Four other researchers were co-authors.
   Mary Miers, an executive in the NIH office that investigates
allegations of research misconduct, said the special committee was
organized after two NIH scientists, Walter W. Stewart and Ned
Feder, ``raised issues'' about research performed by Imanishi-Kari.
   Miers said Stewart and Feder reported their allegations in a
manuscript that has been provided to the committee. The two men,
who in the past have raised questions about the credibility of
other research efforts, declined to discuss the case with a
reporter.
   Baltimore, who won the Nobel Prize in 1976 for research in
cellular biology, said in an interview on Friday that he welcomed
the NIH investigation and hopes it will silence the charges of
Stewart and Feder who he said have ``acted like a judge and jury''
in the case.
   Testimony on the controversy will be heard by two separate
congressional subcommittees, both of which have called Stewart and
Feder as witnesses.
   On Monday, the House subcommittee on government operations and
human resources will hear the NIH scientists, along with other
witnesses on the general subject of scientific fraud.
   On Tuesday, the House subcommittee on oversight and
investigation will plow some of the same ground. Feder and Stewart
will again testify, along with a researcher, Margot O'Toole, who
assisted Imanishi-Kari in the controversial study.
   The study co-authored by Baltimore, Imanishi-Kari and four other
researchers was published in the prestigious journal ``Cell'' on
April 25, 1986. The paper, titled ``Altered Repertoire of
Endogenous Immunoglobulin Gene Expression in Transgenic Mice
Containing a Rearranged Mu Heavy Chain Gene,'' deals with the
replication of immunity cells in a type of genetically altered
laboratory mice.
   Baltimore said he performed the molecular biology work that
contributed to half of the paper, and that Imanishi-Kari conducted
the research that dealt with the immune system.
   The allegations of misconduct, he said, stem from a ``difference
in interpretation'' of research conducted in the laboratory of
Imanishi-Kari, who then was at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   He said O'Toole, who was a post-doctoral student assisting in
the research, disagreed with an interpretation by Imanishi-Kari of
how a monoclonal antibody attached itself to types of immune cells.
   O'Toole brought charges of misconduct against Imanishi-Kari, but
her allegations were investigated and dismissed by officials at MIT
and at Tufts.
   ``The subject was dropped until somebody got Stewart and Feder
interested in the case,'' said Baltimore.

back-to-basics '90s, Kolp seems ahead of the corporate pack rather than out of
step.;   As business people are increasingly buffeted by a recession-plagued
economy that is leaving thousands out of work, as status-seeking yuppies are
ridiculed rather than admired, and as growing numbers of people search to put
more meaning into their work lives, Tom Kolp has done exactly what a growing
number of people are doing. And if they haven't yet, the experts say, they're
thinking hard about it and scraping together resources.;   Kolp dropped out.
And while his decision to start his own business mirrors that of many who have
exited the rat race, his product -- freshly baked bread made from just-milled
wheat, and huge chocolate chip cookies -- and his staff -- young,
well-educated college graduates -- seem particularly telling of the mood of
the '90s and changes in the corporate world.;   "I was tired of working for
people who were just looking out for the almighty dollar," explains Kolp, who
last worked as a real estate and litigation consultant.;   The smell of the
just-out-of-the-oven bread permeates the air at his Great Harvest shop in
Evanston, Ill.;   "I want to live a life I'm proud of and contribute
something," says Kolp. "It sounds corny but that's what I want. Bread is
basic. You make it and you sell it.";   He has a young, energetic group
working for him -- all with degrees from prestigious institutions such as
Northwestern University, Tufts University in Massachusetts and the University
of Toronto. They say they, too, may want to do the same thing someday, that
they're so turned off by the corporate scene they don't want to get into it,
at least not right now.;   "There has to be more to life than just making a
lot of money," says Dan Ettinger, a Tufts University graduate who eventually
wants to be a lawyer. "And these days, even the jobs that are real jobs don't
pay well, so you might as well do something you like.";   "A lot of people who
are 35 or 40 are realizing that their first career choice was off target,"
says Liam Davis, who recently graduated from Kenyon College in Ohio with a
degree in music. "I don't want to make that same mistake.";   "I was exhausted
when I went home," says Jessica O'Malley, who gave up an office manager's job
and took a 20 percent pay cut to help bake bread. "I wanted to get away from
all of the office politics. Here I feel like I'm accomplishing something.";  
The U.S. Small Business Administration reports that more than 1 million
Americans started businesses last year. Estimates range all over the board on
how many will succeed, but that seems scant deterrent.;   John Ward, a
professor at Loyola University's business school and an expert on family
business and entrepreneurship, suggests, in fact that once the entrepreneurial
spirit bites, people "keep scrapping until they figure out what works.";  
Kolp knows the feeling. Every morning, he says, he sees the corporate types
trudging by his store on their way to catch the commuter train. "You don't see
too many smiles," he says. "That's the way I used to be.";   He turned his
back on a lucrative consulting job in Denver. He put away his power ties and
suits, said goodbye to a girlfriend and emptied his bank account to start his
new life.;   But that's not to say his evolution from engineering consultant
to baker has been easy. "I stopped counting the number of times I've been in
tears," he admits.;   Kolp planned his escape for two years, trying to find
just the right opportunity. He stumbled on it in Boulder, Colo., when he tried
the bread at a Great Harvest bakery there -- a franchise company started and
run by a couple from Connecticut, Laura and Pete Wakeman. They had left the
fast lane by moving to Montana in the '70s and opening a bakery there.;   The
company gets hundreds of inquiries a month and more than 300 completed
applications a year from people who seriously want to start bakeries -- and
have put together the needed money, close to $100,000 -- according to company
spokeswoman Jeanie Berna. Just 8 to 10 a year are accepted.;   There are 44
Great Harvest bakeries in the United States; Kolp's is the first in Illinois.;
  Once he got the go-ahead, he traveled the country for months, sometimes
sleeping in his car, looking for a spot to open his bakery. He scrounged used
supplies, including a 30-year-old oven he bought from a Wisconsin prison. He
went door to door asking people if they would buy freshly baked wheat bread.
He sat in his car at various spots and counted the number of people who went
by.;   Kolp renovated a former pharmacy, mostly by himself because he had no
cash to pay for labor. And since the bakery opened Oct. 16, he has worked
every day from dawn until well into the evening, though the bakery is open
five days a week. "I have yet to take a day off," he says.;   He has no money
in the bank and no time for a social life. He's existing on frozen lasagna and
Pepsi and, of course, his bread, but he says he couldn't be happier.;   He has
sold out most days: more than 500 loaves of Oregon herb, honey wheat and
raisin walnut bread, among others. He needs to sell 300 to make ends meet. He
sends leftovers to a local shelter for battered women.;   The bread, Kolp
claims, is healthier and cheaper by the pound than a standard supermarket
loaf. His are $2.75 to $4 per 2-pound loaf and will stay fresh for a week, he
claims. "Affordable quality," Kolp says, between a steady stream of customers
one recent morning.;   The shop offers free samples, with honey and butter.
Rock music plays as the bright-faced crew kneads the bread. Everybody is
dressed casually in jeans and T-shirts.;   "I work 12 hours a day, and I don't
want to leave," says Anna Christman, a 23-year-old with a degree in art from
Northwestern.  </TEXT>

   Sunlite Inc. said it agreed in principle to settle litigation between it and Crutcher-Tufts Corp., a New Orleans energy company. 

   Separately, Sunlite said it will purchase as many as 300,000 of its 2.7 million common shares outstanding. 

   Under the legal agreement, Sunlite, an Atlanta energy and real estate concern, will pay Crutcher-Tufts $615,000 and give up approximately $350,000 in payments from a Louisiana oil and gas field the two have an interest in. 
Both companies will drop suits against each other, and Crutcher-Tufts principals will receive an option that allows them to require Sunlite to buy their 54,050 shares in Sunlite at $6.50 a share. 

   The dispute between the two companies stemmed from Crutcher-Tufts's claim that it had overpaid Sunlite its share of income from the energy field. 

   Sunlite said the settlement will cause it to incur an expense of about $100,000 in its second fiscal quarter, ending Dec. 31. 
That's in addition to $926,000 recorded through Sept. 30 as a provision for contingent loss. 

   Sunlite shares closed Friday at $3.375, unchanged, in national over-the-counter trading.

as younger than their chronological age, said John McCarthy, executive
director of IRSA, a national association of health clubs.;   "In a behavioral
sense -- what movies they go to, books they read -- they literally are 10 to
15 years younger than their actual age," he said.;   WellBridge Centers will
try to keep people from becoming frail as they age, said Evans, a Tufts
University researcher. "Much of what we call aging is really nothing but the
lifetime accumulation of inactivity and poor nutrition.";   The first
WellBridge Center is to open in mid-1992 in Newton, Mass., which is near the
Tufts researchers and has many older people who could want to join, Morley
said.;   Exercise programs will be individually tailored, and based on studies
demonstrating that even people in their 90s can gain strength, he said.;  
Beginners will get a physiological evaluation including stress testing to help
exercise physiologists specializing in their age group determine a program,
under a physician's guidance, Evans said.;   They also will get a diet
evaluation, but, company officials say the center will not at first offer
foods carrying the artificial sweetener NutraSweet label.;   The exercise
program will emphasize flexibility and range of motion, Evans said. Stretching
is vital to increasing range of motion and avoiding injuries, he said. Over
the years, muscles become stiffer, and ligaments and tendons less flexible.;  
Exercise equipment will be tailored to the 50-plus age group. For instance,
exercisers will be able to fine-tune the amount of weight they lift, instead
of using standard plates found in many machines, he said. Aerobics floors and
treadmills will have more padding, and there will be a swimming pool for
impact-free calisthenics, he said.;   The WellBridge Centers will be havens
for people who don't feel comfortable in clubs where most exercisers are
young, Morley said.  </TEXT>

   Soaring medical malpractice claims have contributed to an image of physicians as a tightly knit club with little self-policing. 
But a recent study says doctors are effectively culling many of the bad apples from their midst. 

   The culling is being done by physician-owned insurance companies, which insure more than 40% of U.S. doctors for malpractice. 
Physicians who review insurance matters for such companies have strong financial incentives to prevent negligence-prone colleagues from spawning patient lawsuits. 
They take far more disciplinary actions against negligent doctors than state medical boards, according to the study, which appears in today's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. 

   Physician-owned insurance companies have proliferated since the mid-1970s as traditional malpractice insurers -- faced with skyrocketing, unpredictable awards -- abandoned the business. 
Doctor-owned companies insure about 179,000 U.S. doctors, or more than 60% of those who aren't covered by institutions they work for, such as state mental hospitals, said a spokesman for the Physician Insurers Association of America, a trade group. 

   In 1985, such companies took disciplinary actions against 3.2% of their insured physicians, including termination of coverage for 0.66% of them, according to the medical journal's study. 
Moreover, the sanctions often were imposed with remarkable speed after a doctor showed signs of negligence, said William Schwartz, co-author of the study and a medical economist at Tufts University in Boston. 
Sometimes a single patient claim against a doctor triggered an investigation. 

   In contrast, traditional insurers identify negligence-prone doctors only after data on multiple claims against them have accumulated, a process that can take five years or more, Dr. Schwartz said. 
Also, the doctors on hospital performance review boards often are reluctant to discipline colleagues they work with. 
And state medical boards generally don't have enough resources to effectively weed out bad doctors, Dr. Schwartz said. 

   Still, the state boards are doing a better job, partly because of a four-year-old data bank on problem doctors maintained by the Federation of State Medical Boards, based in Fort Worth, Texas. 
In 1987, the boards reported taking sanctions against 2,663 doctors nationwide, up 72% from 1984, said Bryant Galusha, the group's executive vice president. 

   In a related study in the same issue on doctors who lost their malpractice insurance, the Tufts researchers found there were 24% more physicians in the 45-to-54 age group who lost coverage than expected based on the proportion of doctors they represent. 
Many underwriters speculate that such doctors face "financial responsibilities that drive them to take on grossly excessive work loads, particularly surgical procedures, for which they are not adequately trained," the study said. 
The finding could also stem from the gradual accrual of evidence on negligent doctors that reaches a critical mass only after they have practiced a decade or more, Dr. Schwartz said. 

   The researchers also found that foreign-trained doctors aren't overrepresented among those who lost coverage and that neurosurgeons, plastic surgeons and some other specialists tend to lose coverage more often than expected, even when the high rate of claims in their fields is taken into account.

<TEXT>     She lost her job and her house, and feared that her husband's job was in
jeopardy as well. She took work answering phones at her brother's moving
company.;    "It was very difficult," she said Thursday. "There were times
when I was really frantic.";    But Wednesday, the National Institutes of
Health called her a hero.;    "Dr. O'Toole suffered substantially for the
simple act of raising questions about a scientific paper," the agency said in
a report on the case.;    In a draft report, the health institutes' Office of
Scientific Integrity said in effect that O'Toole had been right all along:
Crucial data in the paper based on work by her superior, Thereza
Imanishi-Kari, had been faked.;    The scientific paper described findings
suggesting that transplanted genes could stimulate a recipient's immune
system. The finding has not been confirmed by other researchers.;    Adviser
signed off;  Baltimore, now president of Rockefeller University in New York,
was a senior adviser on the paper who reviewed the research and the data for
the paper, and his signature on the paper signaled his acceptance of its
claims.;    He said Wednesday that he would ask that the paper be retracted,
and the journal Cell, which published it, agreed Thursday to do so.;    The
chairman at Rockefeller University, Richard Furlaud, issued a statement
reaffirming the university's total confidence in Baltimore.;    "One of the
most surprising things to me is the way so many members of the scientific
community and the scientific press were ready to denigrate Dr. O'Toole," said
Mark Ptashne, a researcher at Harvard University who is an officer of Genetics
Institute, where O'Toole was hired last year to do work in the immunology of
breast cancer, after years of being unable to obtain work in science.;   
"They were willing to go to battle with absolute certainty, without bothering
to read the paper and think about the likelihood that the paper was wrong,"
Ptashne said.;    The Cell paper was not the first time O'Toole had taken on
powerful opponents, her mother, Elizabeth Ryan, said Thursday.;    Earlier
incident;  In 1985, said Ryan, her daughter "was rushing back from lunch" when
she saw a slight man being beaten by a robust assailant. "She came trotting up
sideways to the large man, and said, 'Well, what do you think you are doing?';
   "The man said: 'Go away, go away. I'm a detective making an arrest.' She
said, 'Well, show me your badge.' Another man . . . showed her something but
it wasn't a badge, so she just didn't accept it.";    She collected the names
of people standing nearby and took the matter to the authorities. The matter
eventually went to court, and the large man, who was a police officer, was
suspended for a year.;    O'Toole was a postdoctoral fellow at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1985 and 1986 under Imanishi-Kari,
who was charged in the NIH report with scientific misconduct.;    O'Toole
informally reported to her senior adviser, Henry Wortis at Tufts University,
that she had found 17 pages of data that clearly showed that information in a
scientific paper published in Cell that year was false.;    Wortis and two
other researchers looked into the matter informally but found no misconduct,
he said. MIT later began its own investigation of the allegations.;    After
she reported the matter, O'Toole said she was told by Imanishi-Kari never to
come back to the laboratory.;    Baltimore defended Imanishi-Kari at the time,
he said Wednesday, because he believed in the principle that Congress and
others outside science should not insert themselves in scientific disputes.;  
 In the process, he did not hide his dislike of O'Toole's actions and
described her in one letter as a "disgruntled postdoctoral fellow.";    Toole
recalled hearing painful rumors, everything from reports of incompetence to
suggestions that, as a nursing mother, she was not acting rationally.;    The
heat continued for five years, involving inquiries at universities, by the NIH
and in Congress.;    The dispute prompted a fear that her husband, Peter
Brodeur, would be dismissed from his job in Imanishi-Kari's laboratory, but he
continues to work there.;    O'Toole found solace in the support of two-time
Nobel-prize winner Linus Pauling, as well as that of Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., and his staff, who continued the investigation of the matter. They
were later joined by Ptashne.;    They were among the few who spoke out in her
behalf as O'Toole's allegations were heard and reheard in investigations and
hearings.;    Most scientists rallied around Baltimore and Imanishi-Kari, and
were critical of O'Toole.;    Dr. Walter Gilbert, a Nobel laureate at Harvard
University, raised the question of the responsibility of scientists in charge
at the institutions involved.;    Authorities 'failed';  "The whistle-blower
herself did not want to call this fraud in the beginning, but she reported it
to people who should have known better. The people in authority, and in my
opinion that means at MIT and Tufts, failed to investigate properly," he
said.;    "That is the greatest failure, of the institutions," he said. "There
is a canon of the establishment which says that when someone objects, that
person must be a malcontent and be badly motivated and that science is holier
than anyone or anything. This is the issue: what happens when a scientists is
called upon to be unsure of his or her work."  </TEXT>

<HL> Rise in College Costs Again Outstrips U.S. Inflation Rate --- Average Tuition to Go Up 7% This Year; 4-Year Total Soon Could Be $100,000 </HL>
<AUTHOR> Gary Putka (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>

<TEXT>
   The $100,000 sheepskin is just around the corner. 

   Colleges and universities have raised average tuitions for the coming school year by 7%, the College Board said Friday. 
That makes this the eighth straight year of increases higher than the inflation rate and may step up criticism of higher education for failing to keep its costs under control. 

   Private-school tuitions rose 9% to an average of $7,963, the New York-based college admissions organization said; tuitions at public colleges rose 5%, bringing their average to $1,485. 
Consumer-price inflation for the year through June was 4%. 

   After the latest increases, a year at the most expensive schools now costs just under $19,000, including room and board. 
If tuition inflation continues at present rates, freshmen in the fall of 1989 will pay about $100,000 for a four-year degree from a top school, including incidental costs such as supplies and transportation. 

   Colleges have blamed the rising prices on a need to spend more on financial aid to make up for federal cutbacks and on rising labor costs, especially for faculty. 
But their critics remain unconvinced. 

   "There is no reason, with inflation of 4%, that colleges should be raising their prices by 9%," said Rep. William Goodling, a Republican from Pennsylvania who has unsuccessfully urged a limit on financial aid to high-priced schools. 
"Their concern has been the bottom line, rather than providing quality, affordable education." 

   Colleges point out that tuition provides only about a third of their budgets, with the rest coming from government aid and private contributions. 
"The notion that we're somehow squirreling it away is absurd," says Richard Rosser, president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. 
"Every college I know of is struggling to raise prices as little as they can and still provide a quality education." 

   Ernst Benjamin, the executive secretary of the American Association of University Professors, said that while scholarship and faculty expenses have been rising for schools, administrative costs have risen faster. 
He also cited spending on noneducational services such as counseling and recruiting. 
The average university professor's salary rose 4.9% last year, the AAUP says. 

   The 10 private schools with the highest tuition, room and board charges are Bennington College in Vermont, $18,990; Sarah Lawrence College (N.Y.), $18,760; Brandeis University (Mass.), $18,586; Barnard College (N.Y.), $18,550; Tufts University (Mass.), $18,282; University of Chicago, $18,225; Harvard/Radcliffe colleges (Mass.), $18,210; Dartmouth College (N.H.), $18,199; Boston University, $18,175; New York University, $18,100. 

   The most expensive public colleges are Jersey City State College (N.J.), $7,464; University of Michigan, $6,875; Virginia Military Institute, $6,540; University of Illinois at Chicago, $6,455; College of William and Mary (Va.), $6,370; Virginia State University, $6,356; Lyndon State College (Vt.), $6,291; Johnson State College (Vt.), $6,286; Old Dominion University (Va.), $6,272; and Trenton State College (N.J.), $6,245.

<TEXT>
   The state that's home to the Grand Canyon
and the Petrified Forest will soon acquire another natural wonder _
a spectacular 2{-mile cavern kept secret for years for fear it
would be vandalized.
   The Legislature and Gov. Rose Mofford on Wednesday rushed to
enact legislation allowing the state to acquire the cavern
discovered 14 years ago near Benson in southeast Arizona.
   Mrs. Mofford perched a spelunker's helmet atop her beehive
hairdo as she signed the bill passed by lawmakers only an hour
earlier.
   The cave's existence had been a closely held secret since it was
discovered in 1974, because its owners feared vandals would destroy
its beauty.
   ``It is a major natural resource find,'' said state Park Board
Director Kenneth Travous, who has twice squeezed through the tiny
opening to view the cavern.
   ``It's fabulous,'' Travous said. ``Walt Disney couldn't have
done any better for the state of Arizona. Your imagination goes
crazy when you get down there.''
   The cavern is about 13,000 feet long with rooms the size of
football fields and ceilings from 50 to 100 feet high. Thousands of
still-growing stalagmites and stalactites ranging from a few inches
to 60 feet are found throughout. It's also home to a colony of 700
bats.
   In about three years, Travous says, about 100,000 to 150,000
people a year will get to travel by elevator to see the cave.
Officials plan to use state park revenues to acquire the site for
$1.6 million within a year from the Arizona Nature Conservancy,
which soon will buy the site from the family of the late James
Kartchner, a Cochise County rancher and educator.
   ``I imagine I walked over this thing I don't know how many times
hunting deer'' but never realized the cavern was underneath, said
Rep. Gus Arzberger, whose district includes the cave.
   The state on Friday sent park rangers to guard the site on an
emergency basis as word of the cavern's existence began to leak
out. The bill was quickly enacted Wednesday to allow the state to
continue to oversee the land.
   The cavern's co-discoverer, Randy Tufts, 39, said that finding
it along with Gary Tenen, 37, was ``a once in a lifetime discovery
for the caver.''
   ``People go out and hunt and hunt and hunt for caves; 99 times
out of 100 you never find anything,'' Tufts said.
   Tufts said he and Tenen wanted the cavern turned into a park
because that would be the best way to protect it from vandals.
Because it is near a major highway, Tufts said it was inevitable
that other people would find it.
   Tufts said he had been into the cavern hundreds of times.
   ``It's very colorful ... The variety of formations is very
wide,'' and it still is an actively changing cave, Tufts said.
   Four of Kartchner's 12 children attended Wednesday's legislative
session and bill-signing. Dean Kartchner, a physician, said family
members were aware of the cave but not its splendor.
   ``We climbed in it, there were rattlesnakes, and we climbed back
out (with) no idea of the magnificence of the structure,''
Kartchner said.

   Pat Phillipps is staying in downtown Boston for a
few months, in a room with a view of the theatre district. At her
disposal are a swimming pool, library and exercise room, and she
gets three meals a day.
   Rather than pay room and board, Phillipps will get about $2,100.
But then, most tourists aren't called back if they don't clean their
plate.
   Phillipps, 68, and about 11 other people are housed not at the
Sheraton or the Meridien, but a Tufts University laboratory.
``You've got a private room, private bath, and you don't have to
make up your bed if you don't want to,'' she said. ``Of course, I
make up mine.''
   Tufts' Nutrition Research Center on Aging, funded by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, runs experiments and studies with
volunteers, mainly older people. For $50 to $3,000, depending on the
study, subjects are fed and monitored.
   The center, in an effort to slow the aging process through diet
and nutrition, studies ways to impede the decay of the human body by
osteoporosis, arteriosclerosis, cataracts, and overall loss of
physical capacity.
   ``There are life-threatening situations as people age,
debilitating situations,'' said Judy Frazier, metabolic research
unit manager and director of nursing. ``There really has to be a
better way.''
   The studies can last from two months to five years, including
follow-up experiments. The center, since its inception in 1983, has
completed 76 studies, is working on 18, and has seven ready to go.
   The main focus, naturally, is on diet, and meals are monitored
rigorously. Portions are carefully weighed and measured so the staff
knows exactly how much protein, cholestrol, body fat and other
elements the subjects are eating.
   ``We look at food as chemicals,'' said research dietician Nadine
Sahyoun. ``We are really a lab, not a kitchen.''
   Some studies require two identical meals, one that ends up poured
into a blender to be mixed together and inspected for overall
content.
   If a subject doesn't eat everything the study calls for, even a
dab of gravy left on the plate, the ``rinse and scrape'' method is
implemented. The plate is squirted with a bit of water, and the
volunteer scrapes the plate with a spatula to ensure that every last
bit of food is consumed. If a volunteer is found to have dropped a
pound or two, his or her meals are enlarged.
   Most of the participants, aside from the money, like to
contribute to the center's research and come from all over the
country.
   ``It's a great organization, great people,'' said Richard Harris,
a retiree from El Paso, Texas. ``That makes it more pleasant than
anything.''
   Harris, who participated in a vitamin B-6 study last fall and was
this year for a follow-up, said he would receive $3,000.
   The center offers guided boat tours, museum outings and other
diversions, and the nearby theaters provide entertainment.
Chaperones used to keep the volunteers from sneaking over to
Chinatown for a plate of sweet and sour pork, but most subjects
welcome the chance to find out if they've been eating right.
   Of course, there are other reasons. Phillipps, whose Walpole home
doesn't have air conditioning, likes to take part in summer
experiments so she can get some knitting done without her hands
getting sweaty.

   A "sunburn meter" may soon tell beachgoers they've been in the sun too long. 

   Xytronyx Inc., a San Diego-based maker of health products, has developed a set of chemicals that change color with increasing exposure to ultraviolet rays, the invisible portion of the sun's rays that cause tanning and burning. 
The company plans to use the chemicals in a Band-Aidlike patch that can be put on the skin of sunbathers, or a badge that can be attached to a swimsuit. 
The wearer can tell by the patch's color how much ultraviolet he's been exposed to, even on overcast days. 
A sunbather using a sunscreen lotion can dab the lotion on the patch to see how well the lotion is blocking the burning rays. 

   "It works much like a dosimeter used by workers in the nuclear-power industry to measure their exposure to radiation," says Peter Baram, Xytronyx president. 
The company acknowledges that other firms have developed other types of ultraviolet gauges, but claims its device is the first with commercial potential because it's cheaper and simpler than the others. 
Xytronyx is negotiating marketing rights with several companies and expects to see disposable versions of the gauge on the market this summer, Mr. Baram says. 

   Excessive exposure to sunlight is a major cause of skin cancer. 
Recent studies also indicate that severe sunburn at an early age sharply increases the risk of developing skin cancer later in life. 

   Protecting Animals
   Self-mutilating animals may be aided by a drug used to treat heroin addiction. 

   Researchers at Tufts University's veterinary school in Grafton, Mass., are giving naltrexone, a human drug sold by DuPont Co., to animals that habitually injure themselves. 
In humans, naltrexone counteracts opium-like drugs, such as heroin, and eliminates the "high" people get from such drugs. 
It also blocks effects of naturally occurring substances that are chemically similar to heroin. 
Such substances, including endorphins, are thought to lessen pain and cause the "runner's high" that long-distance runners experience. 

   The Tufts researchers reason that some animals get a slight "high" from endorphins released when they injure themselves, which reinforces the habit of self-mutilation. 
Some stall-kept horses develop a vice called "cribbing," a tendency to bite objects and swallow air, which can produce fatal intestinal blockage. 
Some dogs habitually chase and chew their tails. 

   Experiments with naltrexone so far support the theory. 
"I can inject a dose that will temporarily stop horses from cribbing virtually 100% of time," says Nicholas Dodman, one of the researchers. 
Implanted naltrexone pellets, instead of injections, might work for days or weeks, he suggests. 
Amy Marder, another researcher, is working with dogs. 
"One German shepherd that constantly sucked on a stove handle became much better with naltrexone," she says. 
Such bizarre behavior is often intensified with confinement, so exercise should accompany naltrexone treatment, she adds. 

   Increasing Fertility
   A sperm treatment appears to boost the effectiveness of artificial insemination. 

   One cause of male infertility is low sperm motility, an inability of the sperm to propel themselves with the velocity needed for fertilization. 
"Sperm that 'swim' less than 20 microns a second are very unlikely to fertilize a human egg," says Robert K. Burke, a reproductive endocrinologist with the Fertility Institute of Western Massachusetts. 

   Dr. Burke and his colleagues have developed a new test for sperm motility using a special computer program and time-lapse photography. 
The test, which involves equipment costing $15,000 to $20,000, is "more quantitative, much more highly reproducible and far less expensive" than existing motility tests, he says. 
He predicts the test will eventually become a routine part of all semen analyses. 

   The test also has helped the researchers confirm that a simple test-tube treatment of the sperm can enhance their motility. 
The sperm are incubated in a special high-protein mixture for about 20 minutes. 
For 75% of males, Dr. Burke says, the treatment increases the sperm's velocity to well above normal. 

   The treatment may help many previously infertile couples. 
In cases where the treatment increases sperm motility, a wife can be artificially inseminated with her husband's sperm instead of having to resort to sperm from a donor bank. 
So far, the treatment has been successful in about 35% of the previously infertile couples in which it was tried, Dr. Burke says.

<HEAD>Boston City Councilor Proposes Students Pay $5 Monthly Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONNI EFRON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A city councilor has proposed that college
students, who comprise 20 percent of Boston's population but don't
pay taxes, pay a $5 monthly levy to support the financially
crunched public library.
   Making students pay for city services is an old idea gaining new
luster because of the specter of slashed budgets.
   ``Sixty dollars a year isn't going to make them broke when
they're spending up to $20,000 a year to go to some of these fancy
schools we have in Boston,'' said Councilor Christopher A.
Iannella. ``We have great research facilities and those students
don't pay a cent.''
   All proceeds would go to the Boston Public Library, which is
planning to lay off up to 120 employees and close its 25 branch
libraries four days a week when the city slashes its budget by more
than $1 million next year.
   Boston is host to 32 colleges and universities with an estimated
120,000 students. But half of its real estate is tax-exempt because
it belongs to universities, hospitals or other non-profit
institutions.
   ``Colleges and universities do not pay any tax or gratuity, yet
we supply them with public works, safe streets, police and fire
protection,'' Iannella said in placing the library tax proposal
before the council Wednesday for the second time in seven years.
   His plan would tax full-time college students no more than $60 a
year and part-timers no more than $20 annually.
   Spokesmen for the U.S. Department of Education and the National
Association of Independent Colleges and Universities said they
hadn't heard of attempts elsewhere to tax college students for
local services.
   The tax would not apply to some of the area's best-known
schools: Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, which are in Cambridge, and Tufts University in Medford.
   The president of the library's board of trustees, Kevin F.
Moloney, said the library needs money but won't take a position on
whether taxing students is the best way to raise it.
   ``We're getting slammed from far too many directions,'' said
Stephen Mazzulli, an editor at the student newspaper on the
University of Massachusetts's Boston campus. ``They're upping our
tuition, they're tacking on fees. They added $100 just because they
screwed up the (state) budget, and now they want more.''
   Mazzulli said the average age of a student at his school is 28,
and 80 percent work more than 30 hours a week.
   Northeastern University student Joel Kurth said he uses the
Boston Public Library regularly and wouldn't mind paying for it.
   Iannella first proposed the library tax in 1982 when Boston, on
the verge of bankruptcy, began laying off police and teachers and
closing libraries. The city council passed the tax, but the
Legislature refused to approve it.

   Voracious Vine Poses
   Threat to Young Trees

<TEXT>
   MILE-A-MINUTE weed is a new threat to young trees in the
middle Atlantic states and possibly nationwide.
   The weed, a vine with triangular leaves and an iridescent
blue berry, is a kind of horizontal version of Jack's
beanstalk. It can grow as rapidly as six inches a day and can
grow from seed to 25 feet in a single season. It overruns and
smothers other vegetation and thus poses a threat to
orchards, Christmas tree farms, shrub nurseries and
reforestation efforts. It also can overrun the sides of
highways.
   The weed was first seen by weed scientist Nathan L.
Hartwig of Pennsylvania State University in 1972, when a
specimen was brought to him from a shrub nursery south of
Harrisburg, Pa. He believes the weed came originally from
Japan, possibly aboard some rhododendrons imported by a
Pennsylvania nurseryman around 1930.
   In a survey two years ago, Prof. Hartwig found that
mile-a-minute weed had spread to 12 Pennsylvania counties, 13
Maryland counties and two sites in West Virginia. He believes
the pesty vine, spread by birds and rodents who eat the berry
and by people moving yard plants to new homes, has reached
Virginia, Delaware and Washington.
   Until now, the weed hasn't raised alarms because it
doesn't menace food and fiber crops where tilling and
herbicides keep it at bay. But no-tillage crop practices and
cutbacks on herbicide use could encourage its spread, the
scientist suggests. "It's a definite possibility that this
weed could spread from coast to coast," he says.
   The weed scientist is searching for a herbicide that would
wipe out the weed. Unfortunately, the most effective weed
killer he's found, Roundup, is nonselective and kills the
trees that the vine grows on.
   Mr. Hartwig asks that anyone spotting mile-a-minute weed
call 1-800-247-3662.
                                                                                                       

   Graphite May Drive
   Pistons of Future
                                                                                                       

   AUTO-ENGINE pistons someday may be made of carbon instead
of aluminum alloys.
   Engineers at Daimler-Benz in Stuttgart, Germany, recently
made pistons of fiber-reinforced graphite and installed them
in the engine of a Mercedes-Benz 190E. During 15,000 miles of
city and highway driving, hydrocarbon emissions were 20%
lower than with aluminum-alloy pistons, and carbon-monoxide
emissions were down by 30%. Gasoline consumption improved 3%.
   "The largest improvement, however, was observed in oil
consumption," research engineer Jurgen L. Heuer reported to
the August meeting of the American Chemical Society. "The
carbon piston engine consumed only 44% of the lubricating oil
that a standard engine needs," he said.
   Carbon pistons suffer less friction than metal ones and
are lighter, cutting piston weight by 20%, he explained. They
also stand up to high temperatures better and are quieter.
   Unfortunately, carbon pistons also are more brittle than
aluminum pistons, and current manufacturing methods make them
far too expensive for use in today's engines. Mr. Heuer,
however, suggested there might be cheaper ways to make the
pistons.
                                                                                                       

   New Form of Yogurt
   Helps Stop Diarrhea
                                                                                                       

   TWO TUFTS University medical school scientists and a
Finnish dairy have developed a form of yogurt that helps stop
diarrhea.
   Several years ago, Sherwood Gorbach and his colleague,
Barry Goldin, of the community health department at Tufts in
Boston, began searching for a naturally occurring bacterium
to make a yogurt that would live up to the sometimes
exaggerated health claims of yogurt lovers. Five years ago,
they isolated such a bug from the gut of a fellow professor
and dubbed it lactobacillus GG, for Gorbach and Goldin.
   The bacillus not only ferments milk into yogurt but has
the ability to thrive in the intestine for several days and
prevent the growth of other bacteria. The Americans tied up
with the big Finnish dairy cooperative, Valio, to test the
new yogurt's effect on diarrhea. They recently reported that
among Finnish infants hospitalized for diarrhea, the problem
cleared up in about two days in infants fed the new yogurt,
compared with three days for other infants.
   The "yogurt-like" product made with lactobacillus GG
technically can't be called yogurt, because by international
agreement, yogurt can be made only by a combination of two
other bacilli. Valio sells a low-fat version of the product
in Finland under the name Gefilus.
   Several U.S. dairies expressed interest in the Tufts bug
after it was described at a recent meeting of the Institute
of Food Technologists, Dr. Gorbach says. Data to back up the
claim that the product is effective are being submitted to
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, he adds.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   DEVELOPING a pure white chrysanthemum for florist shops is
the goal of Florigene, a venture of DNA Plant Technology, a
Cinnaminson, N.J., biotech company. . . . Panty hose has
practically eliminated what was once the major cause of
nickel-allergy skin rashes, the buckles in garter belts,
German doctors report in the Journal of the American Academy
of Dermatology. But rashes caused by coins in which nickel
has replaced silver are increasing. . . . Federal
agricultural scientists in Peoria, Ill., have found a process
for converting surplus sugar into a substitute for the $25
million worth of gum arabic that food processors and others
import each year from the Sudan and elsewhere.

   William J. Bennett knew he was going to be
giving up the big bucks when he returned from private life to public
office, and new financial disclosure forms indicate he got what he
expected.
   During the first 2{ months before he became director of the
Office of National Drug Control Policy March 10, Bennett earned
$80,246 from speeches and consulting work plus $25,962 in salary as
president of The Madison Center, a private policy research group he
created.
   If the $106,208 income from the early months had held up
throughout 1989, he could have earned about $550,000, not including
interest on savings.
   Instead, the government started paying him after March 10 at the
rate of $99,500 for a full year, or about $80,000 for the rest of
1989.
   Adding that salary to the earnings of the first couple of months
plus his declared interest earnings gave Bennett an approximate
income of $191,209 to $201,208 for 1989.
   His interest earnings totaled between $5,001 and $15,000.
   ``I was told it would have been a very good year for me,''
Bennett said shortly before taking office, reflecting on his
expected nose dive in take-home pay.
   Some other White House aides have managed to remain wealthy in
public service, while others, such as Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater, have not.
   Bennett, known as one of the poorest members of President
Reagan's Cabinet when he was education secretary, ``turned down $1.5
million in lectures in 1989,'' when President Bush nominated him to
the drug policy job, a lecture-circuit industry source said at the
time.
   The financial disclosure forms indicate Bennett's cash assets
suffered somewhat as a result of his new employment.
   In 1988, Bennett's assets ranged from $301,003 to $356,002 and
up, according to the forms, which only require broad ranges to be
reported and do not require listing such personal items as homes or
cars.
   Bennett told the Senate Judiciary Committee in early 1989 that
his net worth was about $432,600.
   For 1989, Bennett's assets ranged from $150,002 to $350,000.
   When Bennett resigned as Reagan's education secretary on Sept.
20, 1988, he reported having a savings account worth less than
$1,001. The former philosophy professor had been chairman of the
National Endowment for the Humanities for four years before becoming
education secretary in 1985.
   While Bennett was out of office in late 1988, he signed a
contract with Simon &amp; Shuster publishers in New York to write two
books, neither of which has yet been published, and he received
advances of $187,500.
   Bennett's form also said he resigned from positions as consultant
or member of the board of several foundations or public policy
research groups.
   Sig Rogich, who orchestrates President Bush's public appearances,
remains a multimillionaire from his advertising business and
holdings in radio, real estate and other ventures, according to
financial disclosure reports released Monday by White House general
counsel Boyden Gray.
   Rogich reported assets of at least $3.9 million to $5.5 million
or more, and net income on his holdings in the range of $180,549 to
$238,544 or more. His interests included an advertising firm, radio
stations, mobile billboards and a bar in Truckee, Calif.
   At the other end of the spectrum, Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's press
secretary, listed assets ranging from $17,005 to $55,000 and outside
income of $2,722 to $4,520.
   Rogich, in a telephone interview from California where he was
traveling with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said he had
put his holdings in a blind trust and ordered his trustee to sell
his stocks.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu is still on leave from
Tufts University as an engineering professor, but he reported he
will not accept tuition breaks or other faculty benefits for his
children while he works in Washington.
   Sununu, a former governor of New Hampshire, reported assets
ranging from $422,008 to more than $1 million, and income apart from
his White House salary ranging from $15,506 to $55,000. He also drew
$9,151 from New Hampshire for his final weeks as governor.
   Robert Gates, the deputy national security adviser to the
president and former career CIA man, reported assets ranging from
$33,005 to $115,000 and outside income of $2,305 to $8,000.

<TEXT>
   Re Vermont Royster's Sept. 22 editorial-page article "The 20th Century's Forgotten War": Let me assure him that World War I is more than ever very much in the conscience and the curriculum of our colleges. 
Beginning in 1975 with Paul Fussell's "The Great War and Modern Memory," scholars have been producing a stream of very readable general education studies. 
Barbara Tuchman's "Guns of August" (1962) did not stimulate the guild of academic historians, but the literary historians such as Mr. Fussell and the new scholars in technology saw World War I as a watershed of political engagement by intellectuals as well as the start of really terrifying technological innovations, such as poison gas, tanks, airplanes and, above all, the machine gun. 

   This was a war that began with saber charges and red-white-and-blue uniforms. 
It ended with four-foot rats and the near total destruction of a generation. 
None of this has been lost on the faculties of American universities. 
To understand today's world, we examine the impact of Darwinism, chauvinism and the nationalism of an Olympic movement that started in 1896 amid hopes of international brotherhood, and soon degenerated into the worst kind of sports warfare. 

   Whether Santayana actually said it or not makes little difference to an academic community in several disciplines that is dedicated to the absolute necessity of learning from past mistakes. 
Let's only hope someone is listening.

   Boston University seniors are getting a final
lesson in supply and demand. Tickets to this weekend's commencement
featuring President Bush and French President Francois Mitterrand
are being scalped for as much as $100.
   About 30,000 people _ 10,000 more than usual _ are expected at
the ceremony, for which each of the 5,600 seniors was allotted four
tickets.
   ``We haven't had to use a system like this in the past because
we've been able to accommodate everyone, but the students' response
this year has been overwhelming,'' BU Executive Vice President Jon
Westling said Tuesday.
   Most students say their parents wouldn't dream of missing
graduation or the chance to watch two world leaders collect
honorary degrees. And for those with small families or eager to
make a buck, the opportunity to wheel and deal is attractive.
   ``It's a very difficult thing to stop, but it's not something we
encourage or condone,'' Westling said of the scalping.
   University President John Silber helped persuade Bush and
Mitterrand to come to the school's urban campus.
   Silber knows Bush from his days at the University of Texas in
the 1960s, university spokesman Thomas Cashman said. He also has
become acquainted with Mitterrand recently through Nobel laureate
Elie Wiesel, a BU professor and friend of the French president,
Cashman said.
   The coup has allowed BU to dominate the keen annual competition
among Massachusetts' 120 colleges for commencement speakers.
Harvard University and Tufts University had to settle for just one
world leader each: Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, respectively.
   Nevertheless, senior Cindy Carron said she regarded the
presidents' visits a mixed blessing because it limits the number of
tickets available and requires extensive security checks.
   ``I'd almost rather have my whole family there to share in the
ceremony instead of the president, who's untouchable,'' she said.

   A councilman urged the city to construct
a UFO landing pad to welcome extraterrestials. His colleagues
quickly brought him down to Earth.
   George Darden has a reputation for filing unusual bills,
including one last year that would have outlawed sex in Metro
Courthouse.
   On Tuesday night, Darden asked his colleagues to show a little
earthly hospitality to visitors from outer space.
   ``Many people have come to me expressing the fact that they are
seeing these unidentified flying objects,'' he told the council's
rules committee.
   The committee unanimously defeated the resolution. The council
later defeated it 27-1, with Darden the only supporter.
   ``You might live to regret this day,'' he told the council,
chiding members for not taking his proposal seriously.
   Councilman Tom Sharp suggested amending the bill to allow the
landing pad be constructed only in Darden's district.
   Councilman Charles French proposed giving UFOs access to the
airport.
   And Mayor Bill Boner said earlier that if the resolution passed,
he would see if aliens would support a contract on a leaseback
basis, although the currency exchange would be a dilemma.
   Darden told reporters later he would build the landing pad
himself.

   Michael Dukakis today proposed a plan
aimed at restoring U.S. dominance in science and technology to
allow development of new American products that would compete
successfully in foreign markets.
   ``We've got to win the battle to be No. 1 in the technologies of
the future,'' the Democratic nominee told students at Tufts
University. ``We've got to build new industries. We've got to
modernize our old ones so we can make top-of-the-line products and
earn top-of-the-line paychecks.''
   Dukakis expanded on his theme of economic nationalism at Tufts
after he went on nationwide television to accuse Republican rival
George Bush of ``very crass and cynical'' tactics in making a
campaign issue of the Massachusetts prison furlough system.
   Dukakis spoke a few hours before flying to Los Angeles for his
second and final debate with the vice president on Thursday, which
he said would give millions of American voters ``a good sense of
who I am and the kind of leadership I can provide.''
   The Massachusetts governor said that only improvements in
science education and technology development would lead to
restoration of U.S. dominance in manufacturing and marketing of
high-tech consumer goods.
   ``I want us to begin selling cars and computers and compact
discs to the Germans and the Japanese and the Koreans, not arms to
the Ayatollah,'' he said.
   Dukakis delighted the friendly crowd with this and other
partisan salvos, including a jibe at Bush running mate Dan Quayle.
   ``Dan Quayle asks us to believe that if he ever had to fill in
for George Bush, America could get by on a wing and a prayer,'' he
said.
   Dukakis' science proposal included asking the National Science
Foundation to draft annual, state-by-state report cards on the
quality of science education, and programs to improve science
teaching.
   He also proposed recruiting active and retired scientists and
engineers to teach on at least a part-time basis, creating
workplace centers to retrain employees for new technologies, and
establishing a network of national centers of excellence modeled
after state programs that encourage research and technology
development.
   The vice president has repeatedly cited the case of Willie
Horton Jr., a convicted murderer who escaped while on a weekend
furlough granted by the Massachusetts prison system last year and
later slashed a man and twice raped his fiancee.
   ``I think when you use human tragedy for political purposes,
that's kind of the ultimate cynical act in politics,'' Dukakis
said, adding that similar tragedies had occurred under the federal
furlough program and another instituted in California when
President Reagan was governor of that state in the early 1970s.
   ``To use these human tragedies for your own political purposes,
I think, is really a very crass and cynical thing,'' the
Massachusetts governor said on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``And I think
it's frankly because Mr. Bush has never done anything on law
enforcement and crime. Whenever he's been given an assignment (in
the Reagan administration) he's failed.''
   Dukakis vowed that during his nationally televised debate with
Bush in Los Angeles and in the remaining four weeks of the
campaign, ``I think the American people are going to come to know
Mike Dukakis and who he is and how strongly he believes in their
concerns.''
   Dukakis spent several hours Monday night preparing for his
showdown with Bush, which he and his aides view as crucial to his
chances of overcoming Bush's apparent lead in most polls.
   ``This one is out there to be won. You know it and I know it,''
an upbeat Dukakis told a Columbus Day gathering in Levittown, N.Y.
The Democratic nominee then marched in New York City's parade,
where he was enthusiastically received by thousands lining the
streets, many toting Dukakis placards.
   The Massachusetts governor was flanked by New York Gov. Mario
Cuomo, Mayor Edward Koch and John F. Kennedy Jr. as he strolled
through Manhattan.
   Levittown, a model community of post World War II housing
programs, served as a symbolic backdrop for Dukakis' announcement
of his housing plan, which would allow first-time home buyers to
use up to $10,000 of their IRAs or pension plans for a down payment.
   It also would amend federal housing programs to put home
ownership _ which Dukakis called the ``cornerstone of the American
dream'' _ within the reach of five million families who now rent
because they cannot afford to buy a home, Dukakis aides said. It
would complement a previously announced program to promote
construction of new, affordable housing through partnerships with
building and trade unions and developers, they said.
   Dukakis recalled bipartisan post-war efforts in Levittown and
across the nation to ``promise to provide affordable housing for
all Americans'' but said the Reagan administration ``broke that
promise in the early 1980s.''
   The Dukakis ``Home START'' program would allow up to $10,000 to
be removed from IRA accounts or 401K pension systems for a housing
down payment without a tax penalty that they would currently face
by making such a withdrawal.
   It also would change Federal Housing Administration regulations
to raise the maximum loan amount to bring it more in line with
current market prices and allow first-time buyers to get an
FHA-insured mortgage with only a 3 percent down payment.
   Campaign advisers said the principal cost of the home ownership
plan would be an estimated $400 million loss in tax revenue
resulting from the increased incentive for people to contribute to
Individual Retirement Accounts.
