<HEAD>Court Agrees To Hear Challenge To Makeup of St. Louis Board</HEAD>

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether people who do not own property may be excluded from
membership on a public body authorized to recommend a reorganization
of local government in the St. Louis area.
   The court said it will hear a challenge to the make-up of the St.
Louis City-St. Louis County Board of Freeholders.
   The board of freeholders was created to write a proposed charter
for reorganizing the city and county government structure. The board
also was empowered to recommend new taxes to finance the city and
county governments.
   Any proposals by the board would be submitted to the voters in a
referendum.
   Board members were ppointed by the mayor of St. Louis, the county
executive and the governor of Missouri.
   State Representative Robert J. Quinn, a St. Louis County resident
who does not own property, said his rights were violated by a state
constitutional requirement limiting membership on the freeholder
board to property owners.
   Quinn, suing for himself and all others in the city and county
who do not own property, said the exclusion violated the U.S.
Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under law.
   But the Missouri Supreme Court ruled last September that the
federal constitutional protection does not apply because the
freeholder board does not have ``general governmental powers.''
   ``The board of freeholders serves only to recommend a plan of
reorganization to the voters of St. Louis City and St. Louis
County,'' the state court said. ``It can recommend ... property
taxes and sales taxes, but it cannot levy and collect them. In sum,
the board of freeholders has no general governmental powers.''
   The state court said the St. Louis case is not covered by past
U.S. Supreme Court rulings that struck down property ownership as a
qualification for membership on a city school board or regional
airport commission.
   The case is Quinn vs. Millsap, 88-1048.

   People who do not own property may not be
excluded for that reason from membership on a public body empowered
to recommend a reorganization of local government, a unanimous
Supreme Court ruled today.
   The court declared unconstitutional the composition of the St.
Louis City-St. Louis County Board of Freeholders.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said a
land-ownership requirement for appointment to such a public agency
violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under law
for all people.
   ``The mere fact that the board of freeholders considers land-use
issues cannot suffice to sustain a land-ownership requirement in
this case,'' he said.
   The St. Louis freeholder board was created to write a proposed
charter for reorganizing the city and county government structure.
The board also was empowered to recommend new taxes to finance the
city and county governments.
   Any proposals by the board would be submitted to the voters in a
referendum.
   Board members were appointed by the mayor of St. Louis, the
county executive and the governor of Missouri.
   State Representative Robert J. Quinn, a St. Louis County resident
who does not own property, said his rights were violated by a state
constitutional requirement limiting membership on the freeholder
board to property owners.
   Quinn, in a suit on behalf of himself and all others in the city
and county who do not own property, said the exclusion violated the
U.S. Constitution's guarantee of freedom from unlawful
discrimination.
   But the Missouri Supreme Court ruled last year that the
constitutional protection does not apply because the freeholder
board does not have ``general governmental powers.''
   Blackmun said today that even though the freeholder board has a
limited role, that does not mean its composition can violate
constitutional protections against ``invidious discrimination.''
   The case is Quinn vs. Millsap, 88-1048.

DEPLETED RAMS, 49ERS KICK OFF SEASON IN JAPAN 
</P>

<P>
Considering the task at hand, maybe 5,600 miles isn't far enough from home for 
George Seifert, who makes his pro head coaching debut tonight (Sunday, Japan 
time) when the San Francisco 49ers face the Rams in American Bowl '89 at the 
Tokyo Dome. 
</P>
<P>
As it was soon discovered this week, not even crossing the international 
dateline helps. Eager to show the world they've done their homework on a 
strange game that certainly is not baseball, the Japanese were curious to know, 
foremost, what it felt like to replace a legend. 
</P>
<P>
Seifert might have referred them to the new emperor. Instead, he worked his way 
deftly through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we start in this profession, we all tend to live with it," Seifert said 
of handling pressure. "Whether as a head coach, or assistant coaches and 
obviously, the players. That becomes a way of life to us." 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that Bill Walsh, who coached the 49ers to three Super Bowl 
titles in the 1980s, no longer even hovers in the front office, having recently 
accepted a broadcasting position with NBC. Only the memories of a genius and 
his sweaters remain. 
</P>
<P>
Undramatically, tonight's game should prove little, other than to see how well 
Seifert handles the pregame interviews and sideline headset. The game itself is 
pure ceremony, marking the third consecutive season the Rams will play five 
exhibition games instead of the customary four. It's the second overseas 
exhibition in two years for the 49ers, who faced the Miami Dolphins in London 
last summer. All for the betterment of humanity, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The rivalry on the field has long been heated, but what about these owners, 
Edward DeBartolo Jr. and Georgia Frontiere, who have been duking it out in the 
game of international diplomacy? 
</P>
<P>
DeBartolo is already challenging Frontiere to a game next year in Milan, Italy. 
Although the Ram owner is interested, she concedes that she may need some time 
to think it over. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the owners have asked coaches Seifert and the Rams' John Robinson to 
put something interesting together for their hosts, which is easier said than 
done. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams could be missing seven offensive starters because of injury or 
holdout. Tailback Greg Bell, tight end Damone Johnson and guard Duval Love are 
back on the mainland, poring over negotiating strategies. Flanker-tight end 
Pete Holohan is out with a bad knee, and left guard Tom Newberry and wide 
receiver Aaron Cox have hamstring pulls. Receivers Henry Ellard and Ron Brown 
are doubtful with back and hamstring problems, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
So how can a game live up to its billing? 
</P>
<P>
"You get the feeling their expectations of the game are very high," Ram 
quarterback Jim Everett said of the Japanese. "I think all we can do is play as 
aggressive and hard as we can and hopefully win." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson will do his best to squeeze two quarters out of his starting 
quarterback. No one said show business was easy. 
</P>
<P>
"We would like to have a cultural show for the Japanese people," Robinson said. 
"But we don't want to embarrass ourselves. We have mixed goals. We'd like to 
play a lot of people and we'd like to have some rhythm. I think you worry about 
the first game, you know, getting the snap from center." 
</P>
<P>
Thankfully, the Rams' offense will be equally matched by the 49er defense, 
which is missing cornerbacks Don Griffin and Tim McKyer, end Larry Roberts, 
linebacker Charles Haley and strong safety Jeff Fuller, all of whom are 
negotiating contracts. 
</P>
<P>
"Go out and have a hot dog when we have the ball," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana, Super Bowl hero, will start at quarterback for the 49ers and no 
doubt draw the most attention. His legend stretches across the Pacific and was 
further enhanced by Robinson at an opening-night news conference. 
</P>
<P>
"In Joe Montana, you will see one of the great players ever to play this game," 
Robinson said. "He certainly has been the best quarterback to play in my time 
in the NFL, and I think he will go down in history as perhaps the best 
quarterback of all time." 
</P>
<P>
Does Joe dare throw an incompletion? And what of the transition from Walsh to 
Seifert, a nine-year 49er assistant and the team's defensive coordinator since 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference isn't as great as everyone believes," Montana said. "George has 
been in this organization and has been the major reason for our winning. 
Everybody knows what he can do and respects him. For us, it doesn't seem like 
that much of a change. I think there's a little transition in the beginning, 
but practices are going along as usual." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's game starts at 7, PDT, and will be televised locally by ESPN and 
KTTV-Fox, Channel 11. . . . The team charter departs immediately after the game 
and arrives home at noon Sunday. The Rams will move their training camp to Cal 
State Fullerton Monday. . . . With Damone Johnson and Pete Holohan out, rookie 
free agent Richard Ashe from Humboldt State gets the start at tight end. . . . 
Gaston Green will start at tailback and split time there with Robert Delpino. 
Buford McGee will start at fullback. . . . On defense, inside linebacker Fred 
Strickland is out with a knee injury and will be replaced by Richard Brown. . . 
. This is the second NFL game to be played in Tokyo. The St. Louis Cardinals 
defeated the San Diego Chargers, 20-10, here on Aug. 16, 1976. . . . The Rams 
are on the road again next week, facing the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium 
Saturday night. The team opens the home exhibition season at Anaheim Stadium 
Aug. 21 against Phoenix.

LANSFORD GETS ANOTHER LIFE FOR RAMS;

<P>
HIS KICK IN OVERTIME BEATS 49ERS, 16-13, AFTER BLOCKED ATTEMPTS

<P>
As exhibitions go, Saturday night's American Bowl '89 at the Tokyo Dome wasn't 
worth the price of admission, but then, game programs were selling for more 
than $14. 
</P>
<P>
You couldn't tell the players without a program, for 2,000 yen. Yet, a 
standing-room-only crowd of 43,896, some of whom paid $200 a seat for the 
privilege, seemed equally amused and impressed by the Rams' 16-13 overtime 
victory over the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
On his fourth chance, kicker Mike Lansford kicked a 29-yard field game as time 
expired in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The fans here, who haven't seen a professional football game played on home 
soil in 13 years, reacted mightily to every moment and movement, from violent 
collisions on the field to the acrobatics of the Rams' baton twirler. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they're a great crowd and were excited to see American football," Ram 
quarterback Jim Everett said. "As players, we were excited to get the chance to 
play in front of them." 
</P>
<P>
Too excited, as it turned out. The game actually spilled into extra minutes, 
the last thing either team wanted with Typhoon No. 13 sweeping toward Tokyo and 
chartered flights awaiting them at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford had a chance to win it for the Rams with 5:48 left in overtime, but 
his 27-yard field-goal attempt was blocked by Wesley Walls. 
</P>
<P>
He had another shot with less than a minute remaining, but Walls again blocked 
his attempt, this one from 24 yards. However, Ram tackle Kevin Robbins was 
called for a false start before the block, and Lansford set up again from 29 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
A third attempt was also blocked, but both teams were called for false starts, 
and the down was replayed. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Lansford connected and sent the Rams to the airport. But the Rams and 
49ers did their best to mess up complicated logistics that were months in the 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the third quarter, with the 49ers on the Rams' goal line with a 13-6 
lead, rookie Frank Stams recovered a Terrence Flagler fumble at the seven and 
sent the momentum the other way. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams drove 93 yards from there and scored on Robert Delpino's one-yard run 
that tied the score with 8:18 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Starting quarterbacks Everett and Joe Montana were long gone by then, having 
finished up their tuneups in the second quarter. Both were sharper than might 
have been expected so early in the season. 
</P>
<P>
Montana completed eight of 13 passes for 81 yards, while Everett finished with 
five of nine for 69 yards and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a start in the right direction," Everett said. "I didn't like the way my 
performance ended with a pass interception, but again, it's only our first 
preseason game." 
</P>
<P>
And a time to shake the rust from a few Rams. In fact, some would be 
hard-pressed to name the Rams' backup quarterback last year. 
</P>
<P>
He attempted only five passes all season, completing four for 38 yards. His 
name is Mark Herrmann, and he was impressive in his longest stint since joining 
the Rams as a free agent last summer. To give you a hint of how well Everett 
was going in 1988, Herrmann didn't appear in the team's last eight games last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, he stepped in and looked at home in the offense, exactly what 
offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese had in mind when he suggested that the Rams 
rescue Herrmann from football's unemployment line. He had learned Zampese's 
complicated offense in San Diego, and the Rams' figured it was easier to bring 
in Herrmann than to break in a new quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Herrmann completed 16 of 29 passes for 186 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The other star of the night was tailback Gaston Green, the team's first-round 
draft choice a year ago, who shook off some heavy cobwebs. He shared the 
tailback spot with Delpino and finished with 28 carries for 116 yards, nearly 
surpassing in one game his totals for the entire 1988 season, when Green 
carried 35 times for 117 yards. 
</P>
<P>
In the first half, Montana and Everett exchanged enough fire to get their teams 
into kickingrange. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers scored on a 33-yard field goal by Mike Cofer with 6:03 left in the 
quarter, capping a nine-play, 41-yard drive. The Rams came back and tied the 
score during their next possession on a 32-yarder by Lansford. 
</P>
<P>
Montana then picked his way up the field, hitting Jerry Rice for 18 yards and 
John Taylor for 19 on successive completions. The 49ers stalled at the Ram 22, 
and Cofer's 39-yard field goal gave San Francisco a 6-3 lead with 11:15 left in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Young replaced Montana on the 49ers' first possession of the second 
quarter. On first down from his own 36, Young took off on a 41-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
After escaping the rush, he cut his way through the middle before breaking down 
the right sideline. The biggest collision on the run was Young crashing into a 
Japanese photographer as he was forced out of bounds at the Ram 19. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers scored two plays after Young's run. Flagler broke left from the 15 
and had the ball stripped from his arms by safety James Washington at the 
three, the ball bounding toward the end zone. Ram cornerback Clifford Hicks had 
the ball in his hands before it squirted free and into the arms of receiver 
Terry Greer, who recovered in the end zone, giving the 49ers a 13-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Herrmann, who replaced Everett in the second quarter, then drove the Rams 68 
yards in eight plays into field-goal range. Lansford's 25-yarder with 2:11 left 
cut the deficit to seven before the half. On the drive, Herrmann completed 
three of four passes, including a 47-yard play to rookie Mike Williams, the 
team's 10th-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
The only other NFL game in Asia was in Tokyo in 1976, when St. Louis beat San 
Diego, 20-10.

   A St. Louis jail escapee wanted in a
multistate robbery-kidnap spree was chased by 40 police cars and
captured Wednesday in Fort Wayne, after his stolen car crashed into
a squad car and overturned, police said.
   Ronald L. White received only head and leg abrasions in the
crash that ended a 15-minute chase through city streets by FBI
agents, state police and Allen County deputies, police said. He was
arrested around 12:45 p.m.
   Authorities say White was involved in a series of sexual
assaults, the abduction of three people and the theft of four
vehicles since his escape Monday from the medium-security City
Workhouse in St. Louis.
   White, whose age and hometown were not immediately known
Wednesday, was taken to the Allen County Jail after being treated
at a Fort Wayne hospital, Additional charges may be filed by
Missouri, Illinois and Indiana authorities for crimes White
allegedly committed while at large, said Lee M. Quick, assistant
special agent in charge of the Indianapolis FBI office.
   Quick said about 40 law enforcement vehicles were involved in
the chase.
   White also faced charges from an Aurora, Colo., bank robbery
after he was arrested in St. Louis on a drug charge, Quick said. He
also is suspected in in bank robberies in Denver, Seattle and
Lansing, Mich., officials said.
   ``The FBI received a tip that White was en route to Fort Wayne
from Indianapolis and that he had a relative in Fort Wayne,'' said
police Sgt. Keith Butts.
   ``A stakeout was set up at the (relative's) house, but the
suspect rammed an FBI vehicle and fled,'' Butts said.
   White was captured a short time later in a stolen car matching
the description of one owned by a woman he abducted in Missouri,
officials said.
   The kidnapping charge involved the abduction of a 60-year-old
St. Jacob, Ill., gas station attendant who was reported missing
Tuesday night and was found unhurt the next morning, tied up in an
Indianapolis motel, Quick said.
   White drove out of the St. Louis jail Monday after stabbing a
dairy truck driver in the leg who was making a delivery to the
lockup, authorities said. White abandoned the truck minutes later,
then got 27-year-old Michael Crawford to take him to south St.
Louis, where he picked up his 25-year-old girlfriend and threatened
Crawford with a butcher knife, police said.
   Crawford then crashed his car against an apartment house after
White threatened to kill him with a butcher knife, police said.
   Crawford was not injured and White fled, but his girlfriend, who
was treated for facial cuts from the accident, was arrested, police
said.
   White also is suspected of entering the residence of a
19-year-old St. Louis woman, sexually assaulting her at knifepoint
four times and forcing her to accompany him in her boyfriend's car,
police said.
   The woman later jumped from the car when White tried to make her
cash checks at a bank drive-up window. White drove away in the
vehicle, the FBI said.
   He was being held in the workhouse awaiting extradition to
Denver, Quick said. Authorities said they found $20,000 in
travelers checks taken in the robbery of a suburban Denver bank in
his car.

free-agent contract with the St. Louis Blues in July, he looked forward to
being with a Stanley Cup contender. But his arrival meant the loss of Stevens,
the team's captain and top defenseman, as compensation to the Devils.;   And
so, with the Blues off to an 0-2 start in which they have been outscored 10-2,
Shanahan is understandably feeling a little heat entering tonight's home
opener against Edmonton.;   Last week, he said he was sick of hearing about
Stevens.;   "I shouldn't worry about our defense without him, and I don't
think he has to play forward in Jersey to make up for me."; ETC.: Los Angeles
defenseman Rob Blake, who sprained his right shoulder when he rammed into the
boards during the Kings' 6-3 victory over Edmonton on Tuesday, will be
sidelined for up to a month.  </TEXT>

Plan for a County's Survival:
First, Eliminate Some Towns
---
By Eugene Carlson
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
09/15/87
WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)
   IMAGINE A LOCAL ELECTION where you are given the choice of dissolving your hometown. 
Wiping it clean off the map. 
A lot of voters in St. Louis County, Mo., may face that decision next spring as part of an unusual experiment in government reorganization. 

   The audacious plan is being championed by St. Louis County Executive Gene McNary. 
For starters, he suggests completely redrawing the boundaries within St. Louis County, creating 21 municipalities where 90 exist now. 
Mr. McNary says streamlining the county's crazy-quilt geography, along with rejiggering the tax system, would bring efficiency to local government and improve the area's business climate. 

   It would also put a stop to a phenomenon that is making life miserable for Mr. McNary and a lot of other officials of counties in fast-growing metropolitan areas of the U.S. 
This is the push by communities to gobble up valuable, tax-producing land through annexation or outright incorporation. 

   WHEN A CITY or a town reaches beyond its boundaries and snaps up a shopping center or an affluent housing development on county land, it improves its own tax base. 
The county, meanwhile, loses a chunk of real estate that was generating revenue for its own treasury. 

   The trend is strictly one-way. 
Mr. McNary and other metropolitan county executives seem powerless to stem the land grabs. 
They foresee a situation not many years hence when communities will have skimmed off all the valuable real estate, leaving counties in possession of a handful of isolated, unattractive parcels. 

   What to do? 
Mr. McNary's plan at first glance looks like surrender. 
He proposes incorporating all of St. Louis County, wrapping every last chunk of county land into one or another community's boundaries. 
The county budget would be cut in half; it would turn over police and fire duties to the communities and worry only about regional matters, such as roads and economic development. 

   St. Louis County, 524 square miles and one million population, nestles between the Missouri and Mississippi rivers and the western limits of the city of St. Louis. 
It is largely developed, with a mix of wealthy and low-income neighborhoods, factories and parkland. 
About 40% of the county's land is inside some municipality's boundaries. 
The rest of the area, most of it on the county's periphery at the farthest distance from downtown St. Louis, is unincorporated. 

   IT'S THE PROLIFERATION of cities and towns in the county that grates Mr. McNary's sense of government efficiency. 
The 90 municipalities range from a robust community of over 50,000 population to glorified neighborhoods with fewer than 100 residents. 
That's the second-highest number of cities and towns of any county in the U.S., the county says; only Allegheny County, Pa., which includes Pittsburgh and environs, has more. 

   Mr. McNary totes up the numbers. 
"There are 530 elected officials, 43 fire departments and 70 police departments. 
There's something like 700 different taxing rates. 
It's ludicrous for people to be paying for that kind of inefficiency." 

   Continued piecemeal zoning and incorporation will leave the county in dire straits, the executive says. 
"We'll have 130 or 150 municipalities, and any time a company wants to come in, there'll be a neighborhood zoning board to make them dance through the hoops. 
That's not conducive to economic vitality. 

   Mr. McNary and his planning staff have produced a blueprint that radically alters this patchwork pattern. 
It shows 21 communities, nearly all with populations in the 25,000 to 75,000 range. 
That's large enough to provide a broad range of city services but not so big that citizens can't be heard. 

   The new cities would absorb smaller units and get some county land on the side. 
For example, the revamped city of Normandy would digest all or part of 26 municipalities. 

   THE VOTING PROCEDURE is complex. 
A signature-gathering campaign has assured county reorganization a place on the ballot. 
The actual plan will be drafted by a 15-member Board of Freeholders, a peculiar institution created by Missouri's constitution to arbitrate conflict between the city and county of St. Louis. 
It could be Mr. McNary's blueprint, or one substantially different. 

   Oddly, the freeholder procedure for county reorganization also requires approval by city of St. Louis voters. 
Mr. McNary says city officials have pledged not to sabotage reorganization, despite a nasty disagreement over the location of a new professional football stadium that is taking on the character of a blood feud. 

   Selling reorganization, particularly to county residents and elected officials of towns destined to disappear, won't be easy. 
"The strategy is to preserve the large municipalities and give them some of the unincorporated land they've been trying to annex anyway," says Mr. McNary. 
And the small communities? 
"They're proud of their independence, but with the loss of (federal) revenue sharing, they're about to go under anyway." 

   The county executive is reconciled to howls of pain. 
"The very small municipalities will get 50% of the ink and make 50% of the noise on radio and television," he says. 
But their numbers at the ballot box aren't large. 
The 25 smallest communities make up only 1% of the county electorate. 
"We hope they'll be reasonable about finding a solution," Mr. McNary says, without much conviction.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Thursday by the Supreme Court.
   
   CIVIL RIGHTS
   
   The court, which touched off an uproar last year by considering
reversal of a key civil rights decision, today upheld the 1976
ruling that has been a powerful tool to fight racial discrimination.
   The justices unanimouly reaffirmed that an 1866 law enacted to
help freed slaves could be used to sue private citizens accused of
race bias.
   But the court, by a separate 5-4 vote, also ruled that the
123-year-old civil rights law cannot be invoked to fight racial
harassment.
   The case is Patterson vs. McLean Credit Union, 87-107.
   
   STATES-CIVIL RIGHTS
   
   The court gave states and state officials sweeping new protection
from federal lawsuits accusing them of civil rights violations.
   In a 5-4 ruling in a case from Michigan, the court said they may
not be sued under an 1871 law that authorizes damages against
``persons'' who violate people's civil liberties.
   The case is Will vs. Michigan Department of State Police, 87-1207.
   
   REVERSE PATERNITY
   
   The court gave some legal help to any man trying to prove he
fathered the child of a woman married to someone else.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said states must give such men a
``fair opportunity'' to prove paternity and seek visitation rights.
   The case is Michael H. vs. Gerald D., 87-746.
   
   HANDICAPPED CHILDREN
   
   The court shielded states from federal court lawsuits by parents
seeking to enforce a federal law aimed at assuring adequate
education for handicapped children.
   The justices voted 5-4 to excuse Pennsylvania officials from
paying a year's private school tuition for a student with a learning
disability.
   The case is Dellmuth vs. Muth, 87-1855
   
   SUPERFUND
   
   The court ruled states may be forced, through private lawsuits,
to help pay for cleaning up hazardous waste sites targeted under the
so-called Superfund Act.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said the Constitution's Commerce
Clause gives Congress the power to strip state governments of their
constitutional immunity against private lawsuits.
   The case is Pennsylvania vs. Union Gas, 87-1241.
   
   INSURANCE TAXES
   
   The court resolved a tax dispute between the insurance industry
and the Internal Revenue Service in a decision dealing a significant
financial setback to many insurance companies.
   The justices, by a 6-3 vote, ruled that the ``ceding
commissions'' a life insurance company pays when reinsuring another
firm's policies may not be claimed as deductions for the year they
are paid.
   The case is Colonial American Life vs. Commissioner, Internal
Revenue, 88-396.
   
   FREEHOLDERS
   
   The court ruled unanimously that people who do not own property
may not be excluded for that reason from membership on a public body
empowered to recommed a reorganization of local government.
   The court declared unconstitutional the composition of the St.
Louis City-St. Louis County Board of Freeholders.
   The case is Quinn vs. Millsap, 88-1048.

<HEAD>St. Louis Man Sentenced in Battle Over John Lennon Car</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former restaurant owner involved in
litigation over a $350,000 Mercedes-Benz Pullman car once owned by
John Lennon was sentenced Friday to 15 months in prison for money
laundering.
   Edward Murphy, 44, pleaded guilty in August to violating federal
currency reporting requirements. He admitted his girlfriend bought
cashier's checks at six St. Louis area banks to avoid reporting
transactions exceeding $10,000.
   Murphy, who once owned the American Cafe in St. Louis, was
sentenced by U.S. District Judge John Nangle.
   Murphy used the cashier's checks to wire $45,000 in April 1988
from Mercantile Trust in St. Louis to London as payment of legal
fees connected with the litigation, U.S. Attorney Stephen Higgins
said.
   Ownership of the car was being challenged by former Supremes
singer Mary Wilson.
   The car was sold by a repair shop in Basingstoke near London for
$3,750 in 1982, two years after Ms. Wilson and her ex-husband,
Pedro Ferrar, left it there for repairs.
   The car passed through several owners before Nick Miranda, a
former St. Louis used car dealer, bought it in December 1984. Ms.
Wilso won repossession of the car in 1988.

FT  04 MAR 94 / International Company News: Chrysler investment plans grow
to Dollars 1.8bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Chrysler, the US motor manufacturer enjoying strong market share gains,
yesterday announced plans to spend Dollars 1.8bn - up from a previously
announced Dollars 1bn - to expand the production capacity of its
best-selling vehicles over the next two years.
The company said the Dollars 1.8bn would increase capacity by some 500,000
units a year, to around 3.5m vehicles by 1996, and could add around 6,000
new jobs at its plants in the US and Canada.
Last September the company approved a Dollars 1bn programme to remove
production bottlenecks and the additional Dollars 800m it is now committing
is in response to continued strong demand for its products, particularly its
new Dodge Ram pick-up trucks and its Jeep Grand Cherokee sports utility
vehicles.
The move, which comes against a background of global vehicle overcapacity,
underlines Chrysler's strong financial and market-share recovery from the
1991 US recession, when it appeared close to a financial crisis.
The recovery has been due to a succession of innovatively-styled new
vehicles, strong cost controls, and an improvement in the US vehicle market.
The US industry announced yesterday that cars sold at an annual rate of 7.3m
units in February, the same as January and up from 6m units a year ago.
Truck sales were 6m units, up from 4.7m the previous February.
Chrysler's action yesterday includes keeping open its St Louis North
assembly plant, which is making its popular mini-vans. It had previously
intended to close the plant in January 1995, switching production of a new
generation mini-van to a second plant in St Louis.
However, the North plant will now be reopened in the third quarter of next
year to build up to 130,000 Ram trucks a year. The move will add around
1,500 employees in a programme costing Dollars 300m.

FT  13 AUG 93 / International Company News: St Louis makes Dollars 64m deal
with TWA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRANS WORLD Airlines, the bankrupt US carrier, yesterday announced a Dollars
64.7m sale-and-leaseback deal with the city of St Louis, in Missouri. News
of the deal came 24 hours after TWA won bankruptcy court approval for its
plan of reorganisation, and was accompanied by confirmation that the airline
plans to move its headquarters to St Louis.
TWA filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the US
Bankruptcy Code in early 1992, when the airline was still owned by Mr Carl
Icahn, the US financier. Approval for its reorganisation plan means that it
should emerge from bankruptcy within a few weeks.
Under the reorganisation scheme, equity ownership of the airline will be
split between employees, in return for wage concessions, and creditors, in
exchange for forgiving debt.
The carrier had been headquartered in Mount Kisco, New York - alongside Mr
Icahn's other business interests - although its main operating 'hub' was in
St Louis. Under the arrangement with the city, TWA will sell gates, jetways,
baggage systems and associated property to the local airport authority and
then lease these assets back.
Cash from the sale will arrive in two stages: Dollars 24.7m by October 31
and Dollars 40m by December 31. The city has also waived a Dollars 5.3m
claim against TWA for back-lease payments.
TWA dominates air services in St Louis, and when fears about the airline's
continued viability were at their height, concerns were expressed about the
impact which the airline's collapse might have on the city's business
community.

<HEAD>Cox Sells Independent TV Station To St. Louis Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cox Enterprises Inc. said Tuesday it had agreed
to sell its independent television station here to a new St.
Louis-based communications company for an undisclosed price.
   The sale of KDNL, Channel 30, to Better Communications Inc.
hinges on approval by the Federal Communications Commission. KDNL is
affiliated with the Fox Network.
   Atlanta-based Cox also owns newspapers, other television stations
and radio stations.
   Stanley G. Mouse, president of Cox Broadcasting, a division of
Cox Enterprises, said KDNL had not fit the profile of its other
television stations.
   ``Other Cox television stations either are affiliated with the
networks of ABC, CBS and NBC _ or are top 10 market independents
with major news commitments,'' Mouse said.
   ``We're pleased to turn KDNL over to quality broadcasters who
will serve the St. Louis market well,'' he said. ``As for Cox, we
will continue to look for television stations that fit our
portfolio.''
   Better Communications was formed last fall by Barry Baker, former
vice president and director of Koplar Communications Inc. of St.
Louis, and Larry Marcus, former vice president of business affairs
for Koplar. Koplar owns KPLR-TV, St. Louis' Channel 11.
   ``KDNL is the perfect launch for Better Communications,'' Baker
said. ``We plan to grow a broadcasting company from our St. Louis
base, a city in which we have strong ties to both the business and
civic communities.''

SOCKERS BEATEN BY STORM

<TEXT>
<P>
The difference between shouts and whispers was Claudio De Oliveira. 
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian midfielder darted to steal the ball from Socker defender Ralph 
Black, scooted up the carpet and around defender Kevin Crow and sent a shot 
singing into the right corner 8:05 into overtime Monday night to give St. Louis 
a 4-3 victory over the Sockers.. 
</P>
<P>
With the victory, St. Louis evened the best-of-five semifinal series, 1-1, 
snapped a 10-game winning streak for the Sockers in the San Diego Sports Arena 
and forced them to win one on the road. The series resumes tonight at 5:35 at 
St. Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
After the loss, in front of 5,875 spectators, came the quiet analysis. Black 
sat with his head in his hands and found it difficult to form words. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball just came off the boards harder than I thought," he said. "He took it 
off me. I just screwed up. I don't want to say any more." 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Black behind, De Oliveira froze Crow in the middle of the penalty 
box and goalie Victor Nogueira in goal. He celebrated his accomplishment with a 
little dance. 
</P>
<P>
"That's typical in Brazil," said De Oliveira, a first year player who led St. 
Louis with 27 goals in the regular season. "Sometimes I pressure and the coach 
doesn't like it. Black got the ball and I said that's the time." 
</P>
<P>
The coach, Don Popovic, didn't mind him pressuring this time one bit. 
</P>
<P>
"He is a franchise player," Popovic said. "He can do anything. He can pass and 
he can score. He doesn't understand indoor so well but he adjusted." 
</P>
<P>
Socker Coach Ron Newman thinks his team can do some adjusting of its own on the 
road, where the Sockers to date have won just six of 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not worried about playing in St. Louis at all," he said. "We've got no 
excuses. We've just got to suck it up and go after them." 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers almost pulled this one off after falling behind 3-1. Forward Rod 
Castro made good on his first shift, taking a restart kick from midfielder 
Branko Segota, turning to his left and sending it by goalie Slobo Ilijevski to 
tie it 3-3 early in the fourth quarter. Castro, a rookie, has picked his spots 
this season, starting hot, disappearing midway through and finishing hot. 
Monday's goal was his first MISL playoff point. 
</P>
<P>
Storm midfielder Michael Collins put the Storm ahead 2-1 early in the third 
quarter, sneaking behind the defense and waiting while forward Godfrey Ingram 
drew watchful eyes from the Sockers. Instead of shooting, Ingram sent a nice 
soft pass to Collins, who tapped it in quicker than the Sockers could turn 
their heads. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the quarter, the Sockers sat while the Storm shot. Midfielder Branko 
Segota was assessed a two-minute penalty for pushing forward Marcio Leite. 
Twenty-seven seconds later, the whistle blew again, this time directed at 
midfielder Brian Quinn for an intentional hand ball. That gave the Storm a 
two-man advantage and they capitalized, forward Thompson Usiyan taking a pass 
from Godfrey Ingram and crossing it into the left corner to make it 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
It was a game of highs and lows for the Sockers, who were looser and more 
cohesive in the first quarter than they were Saturday but appeared to have 
momentary lapses of intensity until Castro's goal gave them a lift in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was scoreless until forward Godfrey Ingram faked and went to the right of a 
frozen Quinn and sent a swift carpet-hugger into the left corner 3:54 into the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the quarter, Quinn served up a taste of his poetic skills following 
the rebound of his own shot and hitting a ball that was two feet off the ground 
into the left corner. Segota created the chance, sliding on his back to send 
the ball in Quinn's direction between two defenders. 
</P>
<P>
What happens now? Well, it's time for this team to prove itself. The 
speculation and the regular season are history. The road to St. Louis lies 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
"We've just got to work harder," defender George Fernandez said. "We gave the 
ball up too many times. That's lack of concentration. Just a step slow." 
</P>
<P>
Why? 
</P>
<P>
"I have no answer. This is the playoffs. We should be flying all over the 
place." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they are flying to St. Louis in search of that answer. 
</P>
<P>
Socker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Brian Quinn had two assists in Saturday's 3-2 victory over St. Louis 
in Game 1 to move ahead of Jean Willrich into third place on the team's 
all-time playoff scoring list with 92 points. . . . Forward Jim Gabarra, who 
finished the regular season with 10 goals, scored the first game-winning 
playoff goal of his MISL career Saturday. . . . St. Louis forward Stan 
Terlecki, who had 35 points in the regular season, has missed both playoff 
games with bursitis in his right knee. . . . Peter Hattrup, a forward from the 
American Indoor Soccer Assn. signed by the Sockers last Friday, has not suited 
up for either playoff game. . . . Tonight's game will be telecast live from St. 
Louis starting at 5:30.

Bernie Nicholls said the coaches jumped all over the Kings after a lackluster 
first period, and it apparently had the desired effect as Los Angeles came out 
and blew St. Louis away, 7-4, behind Nicholls' 13th career hat trick Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
"It was obvious we didn't play well in the first period," Nicholls said of a 
period that saw only a single goal -- by St. Louis. "Give them the credit. They 
didn't give us much. We got shouted at between periods and it got a little 
hyper in here. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't get excited after one bad period. We played well in the second and 
third." 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls scored his third hat trick of the season in running his goal scoring 
total to 43 in 44 games, second only to Mario Lemieux of Pittsburgh, who has 
47. 
</P>
<P>
After scoring the first Kings goal of the game, Nicholls completed his hat 
trick with a pair of goals 64 seconds apart early in the third period to expand 
what had been a 4-3 Los Angeles lead to 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Krushelnyski added his 12th and 13th goals for the Kings, while rookie 
Igor Liba added a goal and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
Tony McKegney collected two goals for the Blues, his 16th and 17th of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings have won two straight games after suffering through a five-game 
winless streak. St. Louis has won only once in their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Tuttle scored the only goal of the first period at 1:45. After Nicholls' 
45-foot slap shot tied the game at 2:07 of the second period, McKegney rammed 
in a 5-footer at 3:44 to make it 2-1 Blues. The Kings then reeled off three 
straight goals to take command. 
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille popped in a 10-foot rebound of a shot by Sylvain Couturier at 
4:29 to tie the game at 2-2. Liba's power play goal made the score 3-2 at 8:45. 
Liba deflected in Dale De Gray's shot from the blue line past goaltender Greg 
Millen. 
</P>
<P>
Krushelnyski's first goal at 14:27 of the second came on a 5-foot tap-in off a 
pass from Liba to make it 4-2. St. Louis closed to 4-3 with 3:30 remaining in 
the middle period when Rick Meagher beat Kings goalie Glenn Healy on a 20-foot 
wrist shot. 
</P>
<P>
"The difference tonight is we were down 4-3 going into the third, and we know 
it's a one-goal game," said Blues Coach Brian Sutter. "We've got to play like 
we did in the first two periods. We got away from what we do as a hockey team. 
We let it slip away. You've got to play 60 minutes -- that's concentration. 
It's not that didn't get any chances because we got the opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
Kings goalie Glenn Healy won his 20th game of the season, tying him for the NHL 
lead with Philadelphia's Ron Hextall. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately we came out strong," said Healy, "and when you get a cushion you 
tend to play with a lot more confidence."

TAMPA BAY TOPS ON WALSH'S LIST IF HE LEAVES TELEVISION

It's still unknown whether Bill Walsh will return to the broadcast booth next 
season, but the former San Francisco 49er coach did indicate a preference for 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers should he return to football. 
</P>
<P>
"If I pick a team to sign with, Tampa Bay would be at the top of my list," 
Walsh told the St. Petersburg Times. "But there's a lot that would have to 
occur before we finalize something." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh's name has surfaced as a possible replacement at virtually every 
franchise that is having trouble. The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported Tuesday 
that three teams, possibly including the Rams, have already contacted Walsh. 
Cleveland and Tampa Bay were the other teams. 
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper report may be nothing more than speculation based on 
rumor. Neither Walsh nor Rams executive vice president John Shaw could be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh has given no indication to his colleagues that he has an interest with 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Enberg, a broadcast partner of Walsh's at NBC, said that Walsh has had a 
lot of contact from teams but Enberg labeled the Ram rumor as "the least 
credible of them all." 
</P>
<P>
Charlie Jones, who spent last weekend with Walsh working the Denver-Kansas City 
game, said he talked extensively with Walsh about a possible return to 
football. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what he's going to do, and I don't think Bill knows what he's 
going to do," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
Network sources indicate that NBC is satisfied with Walsh's work but given 
current budget constraints haven't decided whether to sign him to another 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh has said that he will not decide his future until after the football 
season. He has not spoken with Buccaneer owner Hugh Culverhouse, but Walsh said 
in the St. Petersburg paper that Culverhouse had asked San Francisco owner 
Eddie DeBartolo to represent Tampa Bay interests in preliminary discussions.

RAMS HAVE TO THINK ABOUT 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a world devoid of San Francisco 49ers, the Rams might be kings. They threw 
their best stuff at the league in 1989, won 13 games, christened a star 
quarterback, played with passion and purpose, and made everyone gather around 
the tube to watch reruns of Flipper. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no blue ribbons. The 49ers have extended grief upon the Rams into a new 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Losing a championship game is difficult enough. The Rams know, having lost nine 
of 12 over the years. But losing to your divisional rival is unbearable. Still, 
the Rams stood and took it honorably after Sunday's 30-3 loss, biting their 
tongues to suppress what had to be an excruciating frustration. 
</P>
<P>
What legal act, exactly, aligned these divisions in the first place, and what's 
to keep a team from jumping ship? If an owner can move a franchise out of town 
in the dead of night, why can't the Rams fudge up their letterhead a bit and 
announce a new alliance with the AFC West? 
</P>
<P>
Can a franchise talk out loud here? 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have averaged 9.6 victories a season under Coach John Robinson since 
1983, and have to show for it one lonely divisional banner to run up the 
flagpole each morning. The Rams will always have 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, a spirited team with an infectious collegiate flavor, never wanted 
the 1989 season to end, much less skid to a halt as it did in Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a roller-coaster," safety Vince Newsome said. "It's been one of the 
oddest years, and the only way to see any good out of it would have been to be 
in the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Newsome, a relative veteran among kids who turns 29 next week, has maybe seen 
his best chance slip away. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, Flipper Anderson, who burst from nowhere in training camp to 
national acclaim in November, can't wait for July. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a big loss," he said after Sunday's game. "But we know what kind of team 
we have. Our spirits are down because of the loss, but we'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Rams count the days until Joe Montana's going-away party. 
But 1989, for all its crazy comebacks and memories, is done. Robinson explains 
that a football team dies at the end of each season and must be reborn the 
next. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Rams were buried in Candlestick Park. A new season will be bring 
change. You'll miss some familiar faces and won't recognize others. 
</P>
<P>
Some names to look for in coming weeks: 
</P>
<P>
Jim Everett. One skittish championship game-performance does not a season make. 
Everett came of age in 1989, leading the Rams through nine nerve-racking 
finishes, winning six. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will soon reward Everett with a new long-term contract, probably five 
years in the $2-million-a-season range. The deal will be completed before Feb. 
1, when Everett technically becomes a free agent. Vice President John Shaw and 
Everett's agent, Marvin Demoff, have been quietly working on the deal since 
August, and risking Everett to a free-agent offer sheet was never an option for 
the Rams or Everett. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the negotiations say the deal will be announced at a news 
conference soon, but there's a "90%" chance it won't happen this week. 
</P>
<P>
LeRoy Irvin. He was 10 years of laughs and one of the most flamboyant Rams 
ever, but his career is apparently over, at least in Anaheim. Irvin, a two-time 
Pro Bowl selection at right cornerback, suggested he would retire after 
Sunday's loss. That may become official on Feb. 1, when the Rams must protect 
37 players and leave the rest for Plan B free agency. Irvin, sources say, won't 
be protected. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Slater. The 14-year veteran right tackle made the Pro Bowl for the sixth 
time in 1989, but Sunday's loss choked him up so much he said he's considering 
retirement. Don't expect it to happen. Robinson thinks Slater, 35, can play two 
more seasons. For that reason, the Rams are expected to protect him. Great 
tackles, even aging ones, are difficult to find. Look for Slater to return for 
his 15th season. 
</P>
<P>
Gaston Green. What's a team to do with a first-round pick who hasn't played in 
two years? Green finished the season on injured reserve so the Rams could 
activate Paul Butcher, a free-agent special teams monster, for a playoff game 
against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Because he was the 14th pick of 1988, though, the Rams will likely protect 
Green from free agency, figuring some team will surely take a chance with the 
former UCLA star. The trading season opens again Feb. 5, but Green hasn't shown 
enough to command much in market value. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone need a low-mileage tailback with great speed and questionable desire? 
</P>
<P>
Fritz Shurmur. The Rams' defensive coordinator since 1983, Shurmur brought the 
league innovations such as the Eagle defense -- five linebackers, two down 
linemen -- and this year's four-linebacker rushing unit. Shurmur gained 
national attention when he out-foxed Philadelphia Coach Buddy Ryan in the 
wild-card game. It might have been enough to get the 57-year-old Shurmur a 
crack at the Phoenix Cardinals' coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
It would take the Rams more than a phone call or two to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ONCE AROUND THE ROSTER IN 1990 
</P>
<P>
OFFENSE: Don't touch that dial. The unit is set for the next five years, so 
long as tackle Robert Cox can step in for Slater in two years and line coach 
Hudson Houck can develop a few young projects to protect against age. Left 
tackle Irv Pankey turns 32 next season and center Doug Smith is 33. Smith made 
the Pro Bowl in 1989, and Pankey would have been in a few by now were it not 
for Slater, who keeps stealing votes on the right side. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson says he's going to abandon his one-back offense in favor of a two-back 
set to better utilize underworked backs Robert Delpino and Cleveland Gary. 
</P>
<P>
But tailback Greg Bell isn't exactly over the hill. The man the experts claimed 
couldn't put good seasons back to back just finished his second consecutive 
1,000-yard rushing season and his third in a six-year career. 
</P>
<P>
Not bad for an afterthought in the Eric Dickerson trade of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, Bell doesn't turn 28 until August. Any more dwarf jokes? 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: Want six good reasons the Rams had no chance of stopping the 49ers 
Sunday? Mike Piel, Bill Hawkins, Clifford Hicks, Anthony Newman, Doug Reed and 
Newsome. All missed the championship game because of injuries. Piel started at 
right defensive end but re-dislocated his left elbow in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
When sound, the Rams' defense isn't as defenseless as it appeared Sunday when 
Montana brushed up on some of his patterns. It probably wouldn't have finished 
21st overall for the season, either. The pieces are there. 
</P>
<P>
Still, changes beckon in 1990. Robinson swears he's finally going to move Jerry 
Gray, a four-time Pro Bowl selection at left cornerback, back to his natural 
position, free safety. But can he afford to if Irvin retires and Hicks, his 
heir apparent, can't return from major reconstructive knee surgery? That would 
leave Darryl Henley and Alfred Jackson as starting cornerbacks in the same 
division with Jerry Rice and John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
One option is drafting a cornerback this spring, or moving Newman to one of the 
open spots. 
</P>
<P>
Piel kept getting better at defensive end, and first-pick Hawkins had emerged 
as a solid player when he was lost for the season Dec. 11 with a knee injury 
that required surgery. 
</P>
<P>
One objective for next season is getting linebacker Frank Stams more action. 
The former Notre Dame star volunteered to move to inside linebacker when Fred 
Strickland and Larry Kelm went down in training camp. Stams was thrown to the 
wolves, then disappeared when Strickland and Kelm returned, proving it takes 
more than five minutes to learn a new position in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
SPECIAL TEAMS: Dale Hatcher, who made the Pro Bowl as a rookie in 1985, may 
have punted his way to Plan B free agency with his woeful 38.8 average in 1989. 
Kicker Mike Lansford remained one of the NFL's best clutch kickers. If he ever 
improves his kickoffs, he'll make a Pro Bowl before he's through. 
</P>
<P>
No question, the Rams made waves in 1989. Their fourth-quarter comebacks gave 
them unique character and a soul. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud of our football team," Robinson said. "I think we played our hearts 
out throughout the year." 
</P>
<P>
They made it all the way to the Final Four. Flipper Anderson, an understudy 
turned superstar, says the Rams will be back in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Think the 49ers will show? 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams have been held without a touchdown in their last three NFC title 
games, dating back to a 9-0 victory over Tampa Bay in the championship game of 
1979. The Rams used three field goals to win that game. They were defeated by 
the Chicago Bears in 1985, 24-0, and by the 49ers on Sunday, 30-3.

<HEAD>Statue Owned By St. Louis Art Museum Was Stolen In 1914</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With a little help from Interpol, a Roman
statue displayed here is going back to the French museum from which
it was stolen in 1914.
   The bronze, a six-inch statue of Hypnos _ the god of sleep _ was
given to the St. Louis Art Museum in 1953.
   The museum's board of commissioners voted Tuesday to give it
back to the Musee des Beaux Arts et d'Archeologie in Besancon,
France.
   French police may come to St. Louis this summer to claim the
statue, one of six bronze objects stolen in 1914, a French museum
official said.
   The statue was given to the St. Louis Art Museum by the late J.
Lionberger Davis, a lawyer, art collector and museum patron, said
James Burke, museum director.
   Burke said the statue was neither a particularly valuable nor
important work and was worth no more than $5,000. He said the
statue has not been displayed at the museum for at least 20 years.
   The statue's ownership came into question as it was about to be
auctioned at Sotheby's in New York last year. A few days before the
auction, two scholars who had seen the statue in a catalog
questioned its authenticity and suggested that it might be a copy
of the missing Besancon bronze, Burke said.
   A day before the auction, Interpol, the international police
force, notified Sotheby's that the statue was believed to be the
stolen bronze itself and the statue was withdrawn from the sale.
   The authenticity of the statue was determined when a plaster
cast made from a 160-year-old mold of the Besancon bronze was
compared to the statue in the St. Louis collection. The plaster
cast and the St. Louis bronze were identical, down to a crack in
the left arm and scratch marks on the buttocks, Burke said.
   Sidney M. Goldstein, associate director of the St. Louis museum,
said he had no reason to believe that either Davis or his dealer
had known that the object had been stolen. He said he had planned
to take the statue to the Besancon museum himself as a gesture of
good will, but a French museum official said the statue must be
turned over to the French police.

DELPINO A BARGAIN IN RAM BACKFIELD; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: LUXURY CARS ABOUND AMONG THE RUNNING BACKS, BUT THE TEAM'S 
SECOND-LEADING RUSHER DRIVES A FORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this week's episode of life styles of rich and famous Rams, Robert Delpino, 
the second-year fullback from Dodge City, Kan., realizes he's the only man in 
the Rams' backfield driving a Ford. 
</P>
<P>
In order of yards gained this season, in fact, it's Greg Bell, Mercedes-Benz; 
Delpino, Mustang; Cleveland Gary, Mercedes; Gaston Green, Mercedes, and Buford 
McGee, BMW. 
</P>
<P>
In the speculative world of judging football talent, it all boils down to 
plain, lousy, fifth-round luck. Delpino, we now know, is much more luxury 
vehicle than sedan. But under the National Football League's system, you are 
what you're drafted. First-rounders get rich. Fifth-rounders get Fords. 
</P>
<P>
Why Delpino lasted eight picks into the fifth round in 1988 is a mystery in 
this age of unlimited budgets and sophisticated scouting services. 
</P>
<P>
To the Rams' credit, they memet Delpino face to face. Coach John Robinson and 
scout Lawrence McCutcheon stopped by Columbia, Mo. -- it's not as easy as it 
sounds -- on their way back from Oklahoma State, where they had taken a hard 
look at tailback Thurman Thomas, ultimately deciding against drafting him 
because of a knee problem. (Robinson's updated opinion: "I regret that.") 
</P>
<P>
"I came away with a sense that (Delpino) was a violent football player," 
Robinson said. "And some violent things happened when he was around." 
</P>
<P>
Five rounds and Gaston Green later, the Rams squeezed Delpino onto their draft 
board. 
</P>
<P>
"It was nothing personal," Delpino concedes. "It was just the system; me never 
being a running back until my senior season in college; me coming from a losing 
program; me growing up in the Midwest. I was kind of a hidden name. I wasn't 
out there much." 
</P>
<P>
Delpino is the Rams' second-leading rusher with 173 yards and a 4.9-yard 
average. He has also caught 15 passes for 154 yards while continuing to play 
well on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino attacks the game head-on, playing with the intensity of someone who has 
had to fight for every yard and every cent. 
</P>
<P>
He has. Last year he came to camp and stood behind Bell, Charles White, Mike 
Guman, McGee, Tim Tyrrell and Green, the 14th overall pick who was being paid 
$1.85 million over four years. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino, who checked in at $333,500 for three years, pored over the odds and 
decided that his only shot was on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
"We were stacked," he said of the running back situation. "After mini-camp was 
over, I went home and told myself to concentrate on other areas, meaning 
special teams." 
</P>
<P>
He ended up as the Rams' rookie of the year for 1988 and was named the league's 
special teams player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"I made a name for myself on special teams, and I got a big ol' trophy. It 
looks like a Heisman Trophy," Delpino said, laughing. "I'm damn proud of it. 
But you get to a point where you want to get off special teams and be more 
involved in the offense, to make more money, to provide for the team." 
</P>
<P>
The battles continue. Last year, he out-dueled the first-rounder, Green, at 
every turn, and figured to make even more inroads this season. 
</P>
<P>
Then came draft day in April. Coach John Robinson, asked why he had by-passed 
Miami fullback Cleveland Gary with the 21st pick to take defensive end Bill 
Hawkins, said Delpino was everything he needed in a fullback. 
</P>
<P>
Five picks later, though, Robinson took Gary with the 26th pick. Delpino, 
watching the draft at home with his girlfriend, nearly choked on his generic 
potato chips. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked," he said. "I didn't know the exact position we stood as far as 
running backs, but I didn't think we needed him. Not a first-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
"Me and Buford McGee were talking about that. We had the same reaction. My 
mouth was wide open. It was my second year, and I'm going to have to do it all 
over again. He does much the same thing I do, the same role. 
</P>
<P>
"But here he is, a first-rounder, and here I am, a fifth-rounder, so I was kind 
of interested to see what was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
Delpino said his girlfriend turned to him and asked for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
"I said I didn't know," he said. "My head was spinning. I was surprised, 
shocked, dismayed and all those great words. The difference was the big money 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
Gary signed a four-year, $1.8-million deal. Delpino is making $80,000 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino has held off his latest challenge, although Gary appears closer to 
making an impact. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino's relentlessness has forced the Rams to reconsider the future. Robinson 
is already talking seriously about dumping his vaunted I-formation in favor of 
multiple-back sets. 
</P>
<P>
Delpino can't help but consider the financial differences among the backs, 
especially Green, who plays so sparingly and dresses so smartly that he might 
consider coming out with his own line of inactive wear. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't help but think about it, to be honest," Delpino said. "I think about 
it a lot. But I do work hard enough to where somebody will take notice, and 
maybe I'll get what's coming to me -- more money." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Jim Everett's back continues to bother him, although it seems almost certain 
that he will start against Phoenix on Sunday. Before Thursday's practice, 
though, John Robinson painted a bleaker picture. "If we said he was out of the 
game, we'd activate (Jeff) Carlson or send out a helicopter for (Steve) Dils," 
Robinson said. Everett, however, threw painlessly in practice and announced 
himself fit for the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
Everett missed Wednesday's practice to have his back checked at Centinela 
Hospital Medical Center, where X-rays proved negative. Everett is also seeing a 
chiropractor, Robert Moore of Irvine, and is doing special exercises to 
strengthen his stomach muscles. "It's probably similar to what Joe Montana was 
doing," Everett said. The San Francisco quarterback had major back surgery a 
few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Everett's condition appears only temporary. "He's got a strained back," 
Robinson said. "Like you or I would have a strained back from lifting a garbage 
can." . . . The Rams fell 12,953 tickets shy of selling out, meaning Sunday's 
game will be blacked out locally.

<TEXT>
   The city of East St. Louis endangers its
police force by failing to equip officers properly, a prosecutor
said Wednesday at the opening of a trial on criminal charges of
reckless conduct against the city.
   But Mayor Carl Officer countered in afternoon testimony: ``I
know of no officer of the East St. Louis police department required
to go to work if they felt their safety was endangered.''
   The Mississippi River city, plagued by unemployment, crime and a
growing municipal debt, is accused of failing to supply its
seven-member patrol force with properly working radios and cars.
   Officials said it was the first Illinois city to be tried on
criminal charges. Convictions would carry fines of $1,000 on each
of nine misdemeanor counts, filed Feb. 22 by the St. Clair County
state's attorney.
   State's Attorney John Baricevic told Circuit Judge Robert
LeChien that some police had bought their own radios and that
detectives had used their own cars.
   The city ``was aware of the situation and recklessly ignored''
it, Baricevic said. The city had the money to correct the problems
but failed to do so, he said. He said he planned to call about 30
witnesses.
   The mayor testified the police-radio problems were routine.
``They are mechanical equipment. They are manmade; they break
down,'' he said. He contended some of the vehicle problems were due
to abuse by the police.
   East St. Louis City Attorney Sam Ross contended Wednesday that
there were no local, state or federal regulations saying
municipalities must provide officers with radios.
   Officer Ray Waggaman, a 16{-year East St. Louis police veteran,
testified that he felt endangered by problems with the radios and
cars.
   Waggaman said he bought his own portable radio in 1983 because
the police radio did not transmit or receive properly. He said he
was not reimbursed.
   Waggaman said he informed his shift commander repeatedly of the
problems, which included cars with bald tires and low oil and
without spotlights.
   During cross examination, Ross said there were no regulations to
define what a ``properly equipped'' vehicle was.
   ``It's a luxury, is it not?'' Ross asked Waggaman, referring to
the radios. ``It's for the convenience of the officer.''
   Waggaman said he knew of no regulations governing the equipment.
   Roosevelt Malone, a former alderman and former chairman of the
City Council's Public Safety Committee, testified that Police Chief
Isadore Chambers told the panel on numerous occasions that new
police equipment was needed.
   Chambers has said that while the force has six radios for its
patrol cars, he often had as many as seven uniformed officers on
the streets. When a seventh officer is available, two members of
the force must share a car so both have access to a radio.
   East St. Louis, once a thriving industrial city, became one of
the nation's poorest with the decline of the industries and the
exodus of whites in the 1960s.
   Sixty-one percent of the city's 55,000 residents receive some
kind of public assistance, and about 40 percent of its citizens are
unemployed.
   Officials say the city's financial problems show no sign of
subsiding. It recently reached a $4 million settlement with a man
seriously beaten by another inmate in the city jail in 1985.

<HL> Corporate Focus: Chrysler Ends Strike, Yielding Little --- Firm Lost Mini-Van Output But Won on 'Outsourcing' Issue </HL>

   Chrysler Corp. resolved the vexing two-week strike at its highly profitable mini-van plant in this St. Louis suburb without giving much ground to the union. 

   It's the first time in a year of various clashes with the United Auto Workers union that Chrysler hasn't had to blink to get a settlement. 
But as the plant's 3,200 workers return to the job today Chrysler won't be chalking up a victory, for the strike will leave unpleasant legacies. 

   It will slash fourth-quarter profit by some $56 million, or an estimated 16%, at the only Big Three auto maker whose earnings have been declining all year. 
Chrysler can't make up the lost production of at least 12,600 stretched-version mini-vans, because the factory already was working full tilt. 
Many would-be buyers may defect to Ford Motor Co., which is launching its stretched mini-van this month. 

   Perhaps more importantly, the strike starkly illustrates how unexpected conflict can be sparked not by any one event, but by the simmering frustrations of workers and companies alike. 
The St. Louis strike, company and UAW officials agree, hadn't any single cause. 
Instead, worker fatigue and resentment clashed with the company's determination not to give ground to workers yet again. 

   "This was a case of ghost issues taking control of the circumstances," said Jerry Tucker, director of the United Auto Workers' eight-state Region 5, which is based in St. Louis. 
"You had workers who've been on a punishing work schedule loaded with overtime at a plant that's building Chrysler's hottest selling item. 
That created a lot of pent-up raw emotions and gave the workers some leverage to vent those emotions with a strike." 

   The main "ghost issue" was outsourcing -- a cost-saving strategy in which auto makers shift work from their own factories to cheaper outside suppliers. 
The St. Louis workers walked out on Oct. 5, the day their local contract expired. 
They said they wanted to ban moves such as the one Chrysler made two years ago, when it outsourced the plant's seat-cushion manufacturing, at a cost of 125 jobs. 

   "If we don't stop outsourcing now it will become like dominoes through our plant and other plants," said Michael Fletcher, a 15-year veteran at the plant, while walking the picket line last week. 
Earlier this year, feelings on the issue ran so high that a group of workers at Chrysler's complex here (which also includes an auto plant) smashed the windows out of a Dodge Colt on their parking lot. 
Even though the car wore a Chrysler badge, it was built by a Japanese manufacturer rather than by American labor, and thus was the ultimate form of outsourcing. 

   But the St. Louis plant hasn't even contemplated any additional outsourcing, say company and union officials. 
What's more, outsourcing is an issue reserved for the UAW's national contract with auto makers, and thus isn't allowed as an issue in local bargaining. 
"I tried to make it clear to the local members that outsourcing is addressed in the national contract with Chrysler," Mr. Tucker said. 

   But emotion, not logic, ruled. 
Four times last summer, the plant's workers had wildcat walkouts because of the stifling heat inside the factory. 
And bitter memories linger from the three years when the plant, and its workers, sat idle after a financially struggling Chrysler closed it in 1980. 

   "You know we're used to standing on the wrong side of this fence," shouted worker Greg Pottoroff after polishing off a beer and watching the World Series on a chilly night at the picket line. 
"It wouldn't bother us if they closed the plant tomorrow and moved everything to Mexico. 
They pushed us out on the streets before. 
I made it through then, and I can do again." 

   What made the situation even more volatile was last month's heated battle for the job of UAW Region 5 director won by Mr. Tucker. 
He campaigned as a dissident on a platform that accused the union of getting too close to the auto makers. 
The mini-van plant voted against Mr. Tucker, and Mr. Tucker says he didn't encourage the strike. 
Nonetheless, his message apparently won notice among the rank-and-file. 

   Meanwhile, Chrysler wasn't about to lose another battle this year to the union. 
Already, the No. 3 auto maker backed down when the UAW staged strong opposition to Chrysler's efforts to sell its Acustar Inc. parts subsidiary. 
And angry worker reaction to the closing of Chrysler's assembly plant in Kenosha, Wis., forced the company into a number of concessions, including creating a trust fund for displaced workers there. 

   "There was no way we could cave in on outsourcing, which had already been hammered out in our national talks," one Chrysler executive, who asked to remain unnamed, complained last week. 
"If we did, this kind of thing would never end." 
So even though the strike had become more costly than the six-day strike at all of Chrysler's Canadian facilities last year, the company held firm. 

   The auto maker grew so desperate to end the walkout -- and so pessimistic about its chances of doing so -- that it sent letters to each worker, via overnight mail, to persuade them to return to work. 
"This strike is adversely affecting you," argued the letter, signed by general plant manager J.B. Burkhart. 
"All employees have much to be thankful for. 
We are all well-paid, our fringe benefits are excellent, and it is a good place to work." 

   But several workers said they burned their copies in the oil drum keeping them warm on the picket line. 

   The company also took the local union to court, saying the strike was illegal and violated its national contract with the UAW. 
But U.S. District Court Judge Clyde S. Cahill, after hearing testimony, admonished the workers and the company to resolve their differences themselves. 

   Finally, last Friday, the intransigence on both sides gave way. 
Chrysler made a new proposal that included a few minor concessions, such as being more flexible in granting time off on hot days, and increasing the number of excused absences allowed the workers in each department to six a day from three. 

   With that, the union, after having rejected two previous offers from Chrysler, voted overwhelmingly to return to work. 
"The members just began to realize this was a stand-off that wasn't going anywhere," Mr. Tucker explained.

<TEXT>
   A judge on Wednesday approved the sale of the
Chicago-to-St. Louis line of Chicago, Missouri and Western Railway
Co., ending fears of a shutdown during the company's bankruptcy
reorganization, its trustee said.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Schwartz made final a tentative
approval he had given last week to the purchase of CM&amp;W's
north-south line for $21.5 million by Rio Grande Industries Inc.,
the parent of Southern Pacific Railroad.
   The sale was endangered, with the threat of a shutdown in
service, late Tuesday when negotiations hit a snag, CM&amp;W trustee
Daniel Murray said.
   The snag occurred when Norfolk Southern Corp., the joint owner
of facilities with CM&amp;W, demanded at least $350,000 from contracts
signed before CM&amp;W declared bankruptcy in April 1988, Murray said.
   But that dispute and several other minor ones were resolved
Wednesday, he said.
   ``The closing is in the process of being completed right now,''
he said late Wednesday afternoon. ``We reached a resolution of the
dispute with Norfolk &amp; Western after negotiations last night and
this morning.''
   Norfolk Southern is the parent of Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co.
   Murray did not provide details on how the problem was resolved.
   ``There will be continuation of service on the line from Kansas
City to St. Louis,'' he said. ``Southern Pacific will take over the
north-south line. Service will continue uninterrupted.''
   CM&amp;W has 632 miles of track from Kansas City to Joliet, with
trackage rights into Chicago. The purchase affects the 282-mile
line running roughly from St. Louis to Chicago.
   Murray had said Tuesday that if negotiations to resolve the
dispute were not completed before the parties went before Schwartz
on Wednesday, the judge would probably have ordered the entire
railroad shut down at midnight.
   About 100 businesses in Illinois and Missouri would have been
affected by a shutdown. An estimated 300,000 people annually also
travel by Amtrak on CM&amp;W track between Chicago and St. Louis.
   The sale of the north-south line to Rio Grande came during
eleventh-hour negotiations last week. State officials stepped in to
mediate the deal and avert a possible shutdown.
   Citicorp North America Inc. and Heller Financial Inc., CM&amp;W's
chief creditors, had asked the court to cancel the CM&amp;W contract
with Amtrak on the north-south line because they said the railroad
was continuing to lose money on passenger service and had no
prospects for a successful reorganization.
   Murray said those creditors appeared to accept the deal and
voiced no objections in court.
   Rio Grande agreed to pay $1 million in start-up expenses and
assume responsibility for $11 million in loans the state of
Illinois made last year to keep struggling CM&amp;W afloat.
   The state, in turn, agreed to reduce interest rates on the
existing loans and extend their payoff periods, as well as forgive
another $2.5 million loan by changing it to a grant.
   Negotiations continued with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., which seeks
to purchase the CM&amp;W east-west lines that are used to haul freight
between St. Louis and Kansas City.
   The Wertheim cash proposal was expected to go before Schwartz on
Dec. 4, Murray said.

   Convicted killer Winford Stokes was executed
by lethal injection Friday night for strangling and stabbing a
woman to death 12 years ago.
   Both the U.S. Supreme Court and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in St. Louis denied last-ditch requests to block the
execution Friday.
   Stokes, 39, was pronounced dead at 9:39 p.m. CDT after receiving
separate lethal doses of sodium pentathol, Pavlon and sodium
chloride at the Potosi Correctional Center.
   He lifted his head to look at the IV bag as the first chemical
was being injected at 9:35 p.m. CDT, blinked his eyes rapidly and
lay back on the gurney.
   Stokes had no last words and had asked for no personal witnesses.
   ``Justice has been served. This regrettable event is necessary
to reaffirm the value the state of Missouri places on innocent
human life,'' Gov. John Ashcroft said in a prepared statement.
   Stokes was sentenced to death after being convicted of capital
murder in the February 1978 strangling and stabbing of 33-year-old
Pamela Benda of University City, outside St. Louis. Authorities
said Stokes, who had escaped from a mental hospital, killed Benda
after meeting her in a bar and going home with her to have sex.
   He also has served time for the 1977 slaying of an elderly St.
Louis woman and the fatal shooting of a St. Louis tavern owner in
1969.
   Stokes' wife, Evette, met with the condemned man for most of the
afternoon but left the prison shortly after 6 p.m., said Dale
Riley, prison spokesman.
   The full 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had refused Friday
morning to lift the stay. Attorney General William Webster promptly
turned to the Supreme Court.
   Even while the stay was in effect, prison officials continued to
prepare for the execution. Stokes ordered another last meal, his
second in two days.
   Riley said Stokes ordered catfish, french fries, cole slaw and a
two-liter bottle of Pepsi. He had had his first last meal of
sirloin steak, wild rice and Pepsi on Thursday.
   The Supreme Court issued its ruling lifting the stay about 7:15
p.m. CDT, and Sindel promptly asked both the 8th Circuit and the
Supreme Court to issue a second stay based on other arguments. Both
courts refused.
   An opinion concurring in the decision was signed by Justice
Anthony Kennedy, Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and Justice
Antonin Scalia.
   Justice William Brennan was joined in a dissenting opinion by
Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry Blackmun.
   Justice John Paul Stevens also dissented.
   Earlier Friday, another three-judge panel of the 8th Circuit
refused to lift the stay. That order was appealed to the full 8th
Circuit.
   Stokes' attorney, Richard Sindel, said U.S. District Judge
George Gunn Jr. granted the stay Wednesday on the basis of
arguments contending Stokes' trial court failed to differentiate
between felony murder and capital murder in its instructions.
   He was the third convict in Missouri and the 125th nationally to
be executed since the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing
states to resume use of the death penalty.

49ERS STRIKE BACK AT RAMS, 26-10;

MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED FROM PLAYOFFS.

<P>
The San Francisco 49ers, Big Nickel-ed and dimed to death by the Rams only 
three weeks ago, performed a little math lesson for their inferiors Monday 
night in front of a national audience that is used to these 49er 
teacher-student sessions. 
</P>
<P>
One superstar quarterback plus one superstar wide receiver plus one darting 
young running back plus a surging defense equals a Super Bowl contender, just 
about any season you want. 
</P>
<P>
Even subtracting 49er all-pro safety Ronnie Lott, all that added up to a 26-10 
defeat for the Rams (5-9) and the mathematical end to any of their far-fetched 
playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
The team that came into the preseason called "the Second-Best Team in Football" 
probably won't even be the second-best team that doesn't make the playoffs this 
season, while the best team in football keeps on besting everybody. And the 
Rams will second that proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
"They just show you what championship-level is," Ram Coach John Robinson said 
of the 49ers. "They cover for an injured player very well." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, after stopping the 49ers at Candlestick Park with an imaginative 
four-safety "Big Nickel" defensive scheme, were just another bump on the road 
Monday night. And the 49ers do love the road -- this victory made it 17 in a 
row on the road and nine of their last 10 in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
You can confuse the 13-1 49ers once, spoil their shot at a perfect season with 
defensive tricks and gadgets and big plays, but Joe Montana and Jerry Rice and 
all the rest aren't about to be swept. They do their own sweeping. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night marked Montana's ninth consecutive victory in Anaheim, his own 
personal Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
This time the difference was two big 49er offensive plays -- a 60-yard scoring 
pass from Montana to Rice and a 74-yard burst by rookie runner Dexter Carter -- 
and a relentless defense that separated the NFL's best from one of its most 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
Carter's run was the longest touchdown run in the NFC this season. And it was 
an almost perfect duplication of last week's game-turning 67-yard dash around 
the left side by New Orleans runner Gill Fenerty as Ram safety Vince Newsome 
again took the wrong angle on the runner. 
</P>
<P>
"Last time we played them, they didn't get the big plays," Robinson said. 
"Their two big plays in the game tonight were pretty much the difference." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams got no game-shaking big plays of their own against a scrappy 49er 
defense that was missing a Lott but not missing a beat. Ram quarterback Jim 
Everett completed 17 of his 35 passes for 232 yards and was intercepted twice, 
and the Rams managed only 53 rushing yards in 19 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Conversely, the 49ers piled up 173 rushing yards in 36 tries -- thanks mainly 
to Carter's 124 yards in 13 carries. The Rams dared the 49ers to run again, 
using variations of six-back and seven-back defensive sets, but not only did 
the 49ers run, Montana found open passing lanes where last meeting he did not. 
</P>
<P>
After Carter blew past the Rams' defense early in the fourth quarter to 
transform a 19-10 game into a 26-10 laugher, the Rams' season was over, with 
two meaningless games left. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rams, who have been pounded in their three nationally televised night 
games this season and still have one left, said they will charge on this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"I always thought we'd dig ourselves out of the hole, but we never did," tackle 
Jackie Slater said. "The good thing about team sports is that, at times like 
this, you can find a bright side. I can look at my teammates, look them in the 
eye, and see no quit there." 
</P>
<P>
They may not have quit, but the Rams were pushed around by the 49ers from the 
opening kickoff until the final gun. The Rams did not force the 49ers to punt 
until less than two minutes remained in the third quarter, and Everett didn't 
complete his second pass of the night until the game was well into the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers started the scoring on their second possession, using their patented 
short-passing game to march for more than five minutes down to the Rams' 
five-yard before settling for Mike Cofer's 23-yard field goal. Montana 
completed five straight at one point, dinking and dunking to Rice and John 
Taylor on quick hits over the middle and his backs flying out to the flats. 
</P>
<P>
On their next possession, the 49ers swallowed up 9:03 in 15 plays, scoring on 
fullback Tom Rathman's one-yard dive on fourth and goal. The 49ers converted 
three third downs and the one fourth-down try on the drive, but failed on the 
extra-point attempt when the snap was low and two 49ers ran into each other 
vying for holder Barry Helton's pass. That made it 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
After a three-and-out Ram possession, the 49ers did it the quick way: a 60-yard 
pass to Rice streaking down the left sideline past Jerry Gray and Anthony 
Newman for a 16-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams mustered up a challenge as the half ticked down, moving 78 yards on a 
long drive of their own. Rookie wide receiver Derrick Faison caught the first 
touchdown pass of his NFL career to cap the drive, a perfectly thrown 
eight-yard lob by Everett over cornerback Darryl Pollard, closing the score to 
16-7. 
</P>
<P>
Everett, after starting out one for eight, completed four of his five passes on 
the drive, for 71 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I think their defense turned it up a notch, and we just couldn't score," 
Robinson said. "We just couldn't sustain it enough." 
</P>
<P>
With the 49ers' defense harrying Everett into hurried throws and with the 
49ers' secondary -- led by free safety Dave Waymer and cornerback Don Griffin 
-- swarming all over the timing patterns the Rams usually hit to Henry Ellard 
and Flipper Anderson with ease, the Rams' defense was under intense pressure to 
stuff the 49ers' offense. Too much pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Rams started the second half by fumbling away a snap on the second 
play of the third quarter to set up Cofer's second field goal of the night, a 
31-yarder to push the 49ers' lead to 19-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams came back with Lansford's chip shot field goal to narrow it to 19-10 
late in the third, but Carter's gallop came just as the final period began. 
</P>
<P>
When did it hit the Rams that they were absolutely out of the playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
"When we walked in here right after the game and looked at each other," Pete 
Holohan said. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Ram inside linebacker Frank Stams suffered a right knee sprain in the first 
quarter and did not play after returning for one play. He will be examined this 
morning for possible cartilage damage. Guard Tom Newberry sprained his left 
ankle in the first half and rookie Bern Brostek played at his spot the rest of 
the way. Safety Vince Newsome suffered a left shoulder contusion. . . . 
Fumble-prone tailback Cleveland Gary did not get into the game until eight 
minutes remained in the third quarter, carried three times for 11 yards, caught 
two passes and did not fumble. Gaston Green started in his place and gained 34 
yards in 12 carries. Gary had no comment when asked about his playing time. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Rams were logically thrust from the playoff race after last 
month's loss to the Dallas Cowboys, Monday night's loss put the mathematical 
finishing touches on the season. The best the Rams can finish is 7-9, which 
would at best tie them with the Dallas Cowboys. Because the Rams lost their 
game against the Cowboys and also cannot finish with a better conference record 
than Dallas, the Rams cannot gain the one NFC wild-card berth still up for 
grabs. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams also clinched their first losing record under John Robinson since 
1987, and their first losing record in a non-strike season in Robinson's eight 
years as coach.

Finding themselves submerged in a dynasty not their own, the Rams will open a 
training camp for rookies today knowing that all good things and teams must 
end. So is this the year or will San Francisco party again? 
</P>
<P>
More anxious than even Steve Young for quarterback Joe Montana to retire, the 
Rams are rebounding from their championship game knockout last January to 
presume again that the best days of the 49ers too shall pass, preferably 
against someone else's defensive secondary. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were quite the compliment collectors after last season's entertaining 
title run, emerging as possibly the NFL's second-best team -- small 
consolation. 
</P>
<P>
For sanity's sake, the Rams pretend not to notice their northern rivals in 
July, prefering self-examination. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they're the issue," Coach John Robinson said of the 49ers, 
resurrecting a familiar training camp tone. "I think they're the issue for 
external people, not for us. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to start this year -- and win the championship this year -- against 
all of the teams that we play. What we're striving to do is become a 
championship-level football team, not just focus on beating one team." 
</P>
<P>
Come December, though, the teams are inevitably linked because of their 
distinct rivalry and a divisional title they seek each season. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, in fact, calculates precisely a San Francisco mean streak that has 
produced consecutive Super Bowl titles. He notes accurately that the 49ers have 
won 24 of their last 27 games since a midseason slump in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"And we're two of those losses," he adds. "And certainly there was another one 
of those we could have won. We've played them four times (during the regular 
season) in that period and won twice. And it's been a phenomenal period, but it 
won't go on. But we cannot spend our time looking at someone else. We must 
spend our time looking at ourselves and improving ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
Still, each measure of self-improvement is always in part a response to the 
maneuverings of the 49ers. The difference is that the Rams play their game of 
chess with limited funds, looking for garage-sale bargains while the 49ers 
spend money from their owner's fancy shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
This past off-season, the Rams signed free-agent quarterback Chuck Long, a 
former sore-armed, first-round draft choice of the Detroit Lions who never 
panned out. If Long pays off in Anaheim, he's the insurance policy answer to 
Young, San Francisco's talented backup. Young earns $1 million a season; Long, 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
Next, Robinson reached into the Plan B market, plucking tailback Curt Warner 
from Seattle, where he gained only 631 yards last season. At his best, Warner 
was among the game's elite runners. At 29, he battles doubts and leg injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is hoping that Warner, a passionate player and leader, will replace 
the emotionless statistical offerings of Greg Bell, who gained few yards in the 
clubhouse diplomacy game. Robinson sent Bell to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The Warner experiment, too, was cost-effective. They'll pay him less than 
$800,000 for the chance he'll bring to the Rams what veteran John Riggins 
brought to Washington after a late-career trade from the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
"It could be a mistake," Robinson said of the Warner deal. "But I don't think 
it's a gamble. It didn't cost us anything. We didn't pay anything. We didn't 
give away a draft choice. Sports has millions of outstanding players who 
somebody said they're careers were over. Then, they make a move and there's an 
immediate resurgence. One could say that the jury's out. But it's not 
ill-conceived. It has a chance for some real success." 
</P>
<P>
If Warner fails or is injured, the running load is plopped into the lap of 
inexperience. Cleveland Gary's rookie season was a wash in 1989 after he 
reported to camp less than a week before the opener. Gaston Green's career has 
been a wash since the Rams made him their top pick in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson insists that Green has matured as a runner and will get a shot this 
summer. But time is running out on this costly investment. 
</P>
<P>
"For us it is," Robinson admitted. "I don't mean that as any kind of threat or 
anything. We've either got to use him or find a way for him to get somewhere 
where he can use his strengths. No question, he is physically different now 
than when he came. He wants desperately to play, (and) we're going to try to 
give him that opportunity. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to have to wait and see. Who knows about injuries? There's 
some question about Curt. Some people say he's all washed up. You don't know. 
There are three guys. I have three tailbacks all trying to prove themselves 
this year. So we will have some healthy competition." 
</P>
<P>
Nothing on offense compares to the competition on defense, where waves of young 
talent fight for a few positions. The Rams ranked 21st overall on defense and 
28th against the pass, although serious and numerous injuries last season 
muddled the true picture a bit. The Rams played the title game without six top 
defenders, but vast improvement on defense remains a must if the Rams wish to 
contend. In short, the wealth of talent acquired in the drafts of 1988 and '89 
must soon produce. The Rams were fortunate last season to get quality time from 
free-agent linebacker Brett Faryniarz and seventh-round linebacker George 
Bethune. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the young defenders on the hot-seat this season are linebacker Frank 
Stams, safety Anthony Newman and linemen Bill Hawkins and Brian Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have to improve," Robinson said. "But I like the cast of 
characters. There's just a lot of unproven people. The scary thing would be to 
have a mediocre group and have them all back." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson envisions multiple defensive schemes and alignments this season to 
take advantage of all his personnel. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams, for example, have a strong run defense led by nose man Alvin Wright 
and ends Doug Reed and Mike Piel. But that unit gets burned too often on 
first-down passes. Robinson hopes to improve the situation by using either one 
or both of his twin towers, Smith and Hawkins, on early downs. Both are 
6-feet-6 and about 270 pounds. Hawkins and Smith also will team up as inside 
rushers on passing downs, and the hope is that the tandem will take some 
pressure off the secondary and the team's only true pass-rusher, Kevin Greene. 
</P>
<P>
"Our outside rush is OK," Robinson said. "Inside is where we need the help. In 
Minnesota, for example, (Keith) Millard is coming at you with the pass rush all 
the time. We're going to try to move in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Rams signed their 10th-round choice, defensive end Stephen Bates, Tuesday. 
He and sixth-round receiver Tim Stallworth are the only draft chices to sign so 
far. Bates, from James Madison, may be tried at linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
Safety Anthony Newman (elbow), defensive end Doug Reed (ankle), safety Vince 
Newsome (ankle) and defensive tackle Mike Piel (elbow) have recovered fully 
from injuries suffered late last season, Coach John Robinson said. Defensive 
tackle Bill Hawkins still isn't 100% after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery 
in December, but he is expected to be practicing at full speed by Aug. 1. The 
news isn't so good for third-year cornerback Cliff Hicks, who suffered knee 
damage last season. He is not expected back until September at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
Two roster positions open this summer are at fourth wide receiver and punter. 
Veteran Hank Ilesic and rookie Kent Elmore figure to battle for Dale Hatcher's 
old punting job. . . . The veterans will report to training camp at UC Irvine 
on July 26. The Rams were forced out of Cal State Fullerton this year because 
construction has begun on a campus sports complex. . . . The team will spend 
two weeks at Rams Park before opening camp in Irvine, then leave a week later 
for an Aug. 11 exhibition game against the Kansas City Chiefs in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams are the first NFL team to report to camp. It might be a while before 
the team's top three draft choices -- Bern Brostek, Pat Terrell and Latin Berry 
-- agree to terms. The Rams also have seven conditional free-agent veterans yet 
to sign, most notably Pro Bowl linebacker Kevin Greene, who has recorded 33 
sacks over the last two seasons. The others are linebacker Brett Faryniarz, 
tight ends Pete Holohan and Damone Johnson, safety Michael Stewart, nose tackle 
Alvin Wright and defensive end Doug Reed.

STALWART RAM FANS HAVE A BALL IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>

SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the posh reception in the Golden Gate Way ballroom at the Hyatt Regency 
Saturday night, even the food symbolized the fan loyalties for the game between 
the Rams and 49ers, who face off under cloudy skies today for the NFC 
Championship. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams people dug into pizza from a station at "Hollywood and Vine," 
surrounded by movie posters and stuffed pink flamingos. The 49ers piled their 
plates from a boatload of seafood a la Fisherman's Wharf. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Rams owner Georgia Frontiere swept into the party fashionably late, 
sparkling in an amethyst necklace and bead-splashed turquoise chiffon dress. 
"I'm so excited, I can hardly stand it," she said. "It's going to be the Rams 
all the way." 
</P>
<P>
Not all Rams fans can get invited to parties at the Hyatt. But the hundreds of 
Rams supporters who made it to San Francisco for the game to decide the NFC's 
Super Bowl team found the city teeming with football fever, undampened by the 
rainy weather. None of the Rams' fans lacked for spirit either. 
</P>
<P>
At San Francisco International Airport, Yvonne De Jon of Long Beach was decked 
in Ram colors -- a blue and gold Bermuda-style hat, with a football-helmet 
charm dangling from her neck, and a Rams' jacket. 
</P>
<P>
She and others gave a boisterous hello to the city when they arrived on a 
Saturday flight from Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Is that for Joe Montana?" she gently chided an airport porter pushing a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
"No way. Go 49ers," he shot back." 
</P>
<P>
De Jon and her friends arrived early enough on Saturday to greet Rams players 
as they checked into their hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got on my (Rams) colors, right down to my blue bra," De Jon boasted. 
</P>
<P>
Closet Rams fans cropped up at the unlikeliest of places. At Candlestick Park, 
where the game will be played this afternoon, groundskeeper John Gilledo, 24, 
said he was only sporting a 49er hat because he works there. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a Rams fan," he said. "I have a hunch that they are going to win." 
</P>
<P>
Late Saturday night, 30 members of the Rams Booster Club climbed aboard a bus 
for a night of revelry. Waving a banner and blowing horns, the group charged 
into the lobby of the West Hotel at the airport, where the players are staying, 
in hopes of finding some of their heroes. 
</P>
<P>
"You blew it," a hotel clerk said. "You're about an hour late." 
</P>
<P>
But they were lucky enough to find defensive back Kevin Greene, who found 
himself surrounded by well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
"This is great," Greene said. "We're getting great support. I'm happy to see 
all these smiling faces." 
</P>
<P>
Some Ram boosters made a stop by the offices of the San Francisco Chronicle, 
taping a banner to the window that read "Watch Out, the Rams Booster Club was 
here." They were steamed about an article in Saturday's paper describing them 
as lousy fans. 
</P>
<P>
"We're really mad," said Joanie Feria of Glendale. "We won't wear white shoes 
after Labor Day." That crack was in response to the article's suggestion that 
Ram fans were even bad dressers. 
</P>
<P>
There were plenty of non-Ram fans in town, of course. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate the Rams," said Manny Robleto, a San Francisco policeman. "I'm hoping 
it's going to be a 49er blowout." 
</P>
<P>
At the Hyatt party, 49er owner Edward DeBartolo Jr. apologized about the 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
"Sorry about the rainy weather," he told some Rams people. "I don't think it 
will affect the game that much. In fact, it may help the offense." 
</P>
<P>
The $40,000 party, attended by nearly 400, was for team owners, their staffs, 
sponsors, and the media. 
</P>
<P>
Someone jokingly noted the Hollywood theme and asked: Doesn't San Francisco 
know that the Rams are from Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
It was a festive mood, whatever the theme. But one element missing from the 6 
to 8 p.m. party was the players. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Beam, director of operations for the Rams, explained they were in team 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
"Then it's two hours of free time, when they'll go into their hotel rooms, 
watch some TV, and play some cards. They'll have their meal at 9:30 -- 
hamburgers, fried chicken, salads, that kind of stuff -- and curfew is at 11." 
</P>
<P>
Former Rams defensive end Jack Youngblood, now a Rams broadcaster, confided he 
would rather be resting up to play in the game instead of rubbing elbows. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd all like to be 28 and out there playing the game," he said. "It was a 
very exciting time for me, and right now I know the Rams are trying to relax. 
You get stressed out just trying to relax. Tomorrow morning, they will get up 
at 6 and drink six gallons of coffee, have a little breakfast and load up on 
the carbs (carbohydrates)." 
</P>
<P>
For those without tickets, the 49ers booster club was selling them for $300 
each. Some of the Rams booster club members were worried they would get tickets 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until Wednesday that 18 tickets were made available to them. And that 
was only because booster president Larry Kenemore called Georgia Frontiere at 
her hotel in New York. The club actually wound up getting more tickets through 
the 49ers booster club, which made 50 tickets available at the regular price. 
</P>
<P>
Two Ram fans, Beth Fisher, 14, and her sister, Karilyn Fisher, 21, had a 
special reason for making the trip. They got a call from Coach John Robinson 
himself after the Rams beat the Giants last week. 
</P>
<P>
Beth Fisher said he told them: "Make plans for San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is engaged to their mother, Linda Fisher, owner of a modeling agency 
in Anaheim. The daughters said they think the wedding will be next month. 
</P>
<P>
"We usually just go to home games, so this is real exciting," Beth Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams supporters were having fun, but anxious for victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The Rams are going to be the team of the '90s," predicted Jim Ort, a charter 
member of the Booster Club. 
</P>
<P>
But most fans will likely agree with 49ers owner DeBartolo. 
</P>
<P>
"All I know is it's going to be a great game," he said.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: NO ERRORS FOR CBS AFTER ESPN'S BIG BLUNDER IN BOSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
CBS' postseason opener Thursday night was a lot better than ESPN's 
regular-season finale Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
CBS didn't really miss anything in covering Pittsburgh's exciting 4-3 victory 
over Cincinnati in Game 1 of the National League championship series, which is 
more than you can say about ESPN in covering Boston's American League 
East-clinching victory over the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
With two out in the bottom of the ninth inning and the Red Sox leading, 3-1, 
ESPN positioned all but two of its nine cameras to get player and crowd 
reactions. 
</P>
<P>
The center-field camera was used to show the pitch to Chicago's Ozzie Guillen, 
and that left only the high camera behind home plate to follow the ball to 
right field, where Tom Brunansky, blocked from view in a corner of Fenway Park, 
made his big catch. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN missed the live shot of this momentous play and, worse yet, had no 
replays. The cable network was left with nothing but egg on its face. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN, it is hoped, learned something: Never sacrifice game action for reaction 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd in Cincinnati demonstrated knowledge of CBS announcer Jack Buck, 
holding up a "Go Crazy, Folks, Go Crazy" banner. That was Buck's radio call on 
Ozzie Smith's home run that gave the St. Louis Cardinals a 3-2 game lead over 
the Dodgers in the 1985 NL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Buck's succinct style works well with Tim McCarver's more animated delivery. "I 
think we're tied," Buck said when the Pirates' Sid Bream hit his two-run homer 
to catch the Reds at 3-3 in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
The National League's Game 2 begins at 12:18 p.m. today, and Game 1 of the 
American League championship series, Oakland at Boston, is set for Saturday at 
5:30 p.m. The AL announcers are Dick Stockton and Jim Kaat. 
</P>
<P>
The season is over for the Dodgers, but not for announcers Vin Scully and Jaime 
Jarrin. 
</P>
<P>
Scully will work the World Series for CBS Radio, and Jarrin will work the 
playoffs and the Series for CBS Radio's Spanish-language network. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin's words will go to 40 stations reaching 80% of the 12.8 million 
Spanish-speaking people in the United States, plus 175 stations throughout 
Latin America. The Los Angeles affiliate is KTNQ. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin relishes the assignment. But then he relishes about everything these 
days. Mainly, he is thrilled to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin almost died from injuries suffered in an auto accident at Vero Beach, 
Fla., in March. He had a lacerated liver, a ruptured spleen, broken ribs and a 
collapsed lung. He underwent surgery the night of the accident and again a few 
weeks later to clear an intestinal abscess. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin didn't return to work until the All-Star game July 10, and didn't return 
full time until July 23. 
</P>
<P>
He says he's now about 85%. "There's still some pain from the incisions, but I 
feel pretty good," he said. "My weight is coming back." 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin, who lost 36 pounds, dropping to 138 after the accident, is at 158 and 
looking fit. 
</P>
<P>
Add Jarrin: The auto accident isn't the only recent tragedy in Jarrin's life. 
Two years ago, his son James died of an aneurysm at 29. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin has two other sons -- Jorge, the popular traffic reporter for KABC 
Radio, and Mauricio, a student at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Life has been good to Jarrin. The two tragedies made him realize how good. 
"I've learned to appreciate everything just that much more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Jarrin, possibly the most popular member of the Dodger organization, came to 
the United States from Ecuador with his wife, Blanca, in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
He got a radio job with KWKW that year and began covering the Dodgers. In 1972, 
he became the Dodgers' No. 1 Spanish-language announcer and was soon called the 
Vin Scully of the Spanish-speaking community. 
</P>
<P>
As Fernando Valenzuela's translator in the early 1980s, he became known to the 
English-speaking community, as well. 
</P>
<P>
While recuperating in the hospital, Jarrin got the chance to listen to Scully 
extensively. "There's no question he is the best," Jarrin said. 
</P>
<P>
That's what Spanish-speaking listeners also say about Jarrin. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the baseball playoffs are here and the World Series is next, KABC 
Radio has cut its "Sportstalk" program in half. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning today, "Sportstalk," which has been running from 4 to 8 p.m., will be 
on the air from 5 to 7 p.m. This is not exactly a good omen for host Ed 
(Superfan) Bieler, and KABC management has reportedly met with other talk-show 
hosts. 
</P>
<P>
Stu Nahan will continue with his "Stu's Views" segment at 5:45 p.m., and Ross 
Porter will be on three times a week during the second hour with "Dodger 
Focus." 
</P>
<P>
Buffoon Dept.: Just before going on the air, Victor Kiam, the New England 
Patriots' owner who also makes Remington shavers, mentioned to NBC's Will 
McDonough and Bob Costas that he has already bought Christmas advertising on 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, it was supposed to soften them up. It didn't work. Costas grilled 
Kiam. 
</P>
<P>
New show: The Rams' Mike Lansford will kick off "Sports Confidential" on 
SportsChannel Los Angeles Nov. 5, and the show is scheduled to move to the full 
SportsChannel America network in December. Janniene Keahl, who works for an 
Orange County cable channel, will be the co-host. 
</P>
<P>
Lansford does a radio show Monday and Friday mornings on KEZY and KORG in 
Orange County, and the TV commercial he does for Smogpros is seen everywhere. 
One thing about that commercial: It's not Lansford's voice. Why? "Beats me," 
Lansford said. 
</P>
<P>
TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
Either USC or UCLA has appeared on ABC every weekend this season, and the trend 
continues. The Arizona at UCLA game will be on ABC Saturday at 12:30 p.m., with 
Brent Musburger and Dick Vermeil reporting. And on Oct. 13, ABC will televise 
USC at Stanford, with the same announcing team. . . . Saturday night, USC's 
7:30 home game against Washington State will be on ESPN, with Steve Physioc and 
Neil Lomax reporting. . . . With KNX carrying baseball Saturday night, the 
Trojan radio broadcast will be on KLAC. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were 6,559 tickets shy of selling out in time to lift the blackout for 
Sunday's home game against the Cincinnati Bengals. So the NFL lineup will be 
Kansas City at Indianapolis at 10 a.m. on NBC, with Charlie Jones and Todd 
Christensen; Green Bay at Chicago at 1 p.m. on CBS, with Pat Summerall and John 
Madden, and the Raiders at Buffalo at 4:30 p.m. on TNT and Channel 9, with Skip 
Caray and Pat Haden. . . . Joe McDonnell's Sunday night talk show on KFI will 
air after the Raider game. . . . The Rams' game at Chicago on Oct. 14 will also 
have a 4:30 p.m. kickoff. TNT is going with 4:30 starts the next two Sundays to 
get a head start on the baseball playoff games on CBS. There will be no TNT 
Sunday night football on Oct. 21 to avoid competing with the World Series. 
Instead, the New England-Miami game will be televised on Thursday, Oct. 18, a 
Series travel day. 
</P>
<P>
John Rooney and Jerry Coleman are the CBS Radio announcers for the National 
League playoffs; Jim Hunter and Johnny Bench are handling the American League 
playoffs. Bench will join Vin Scully for the World Series. . . . Chicago White 
Sox Manager Jeff Torborg will be a studio guest on the CBS-TV baseball pregame 
show Saturday night, and Don Baylor will be on the Sunday night show. . . . The 
Dodgers' Rick Dempsey was Channel 2's postgame guest Thursday night, the 
Angels' Wally Joyner will be the American League guest commentator, and St. 
Louis pitcher Joe Magrane will take over on the National League show Tuesday. . 
. . Dodger pitcher Tim Belcher will be a KFWB contributor during the playoffs 
and the Series. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 2 announced that KMPC's Jim Healy, along with fellow radio 
personalities Ed Bieler, Lee Hamilton and Gabe Kaplan, would be a part of this 
week's "The John Robinson Show," which airs Saturday at 3:30 p.m. and again 
Sunday at 10 a.m. But Healy said he will not be on the show. He said KMPC sent 
along a mug shot of him, but that was it. . . . Kaplan will do his KLAC 
"Sportsnut" programs from Honolulu next week. . . . Talk about a big dropoff: 
Roy Firestone, possibly the best sports interviewer on television, will be 
replaced by Joe Fowler on the Laker pregame shows on Channel 9 this season. Ted 
Green remains as the producer.

<HEAD>Southern Pacific Railroad to Buy St. Louis-Chicago Line</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southern Pacific Transportation Co. will
pay $22 million in cash to purchase the St. Louis to Chicago rail
line of the Chicago, Missouri &amp; Western Railway Co., officials
announced Thursday.
   The CM&amp;W railway submitted the preliminary sale agreement to
Chief Bankruptcy Judge John D. Schwartz in Chicago, said Daniel R.
Murray, trustee of CM&amp;W.
   Southern Pacific, a unit of Rio Grande Industries Inc., agreed
to buy the 282-mile line through Springfield and Bloomington, Ill.,
and to assume $7 million in debt owed by CM&amp;W to the state of
Illinois, he said. CM&amp;W is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   Under the terms of the agreement, the trustee would retain the
CM&amp;W lines from Kansas City, Mo., to Springfield and to Godfrey,
Ill., as well as a 50 percent interest in the lines from eastern
St. Louis to Godfery. The St. Louis and Kansas City lines meet in
Godfrey.
   Schwartz referred the matter to the Interstate Commerce
Commission and has set Sept. 13 for a further hearing.
   ``This purchase, along with acquisition of the Soo Line's Kansas
City-Chicago route which we negotiated in June, will give Southern
Pacific access from two major routes to Chicago markets and,
through Chicago, important routes for customers across the
nation,'' said Mike Mohan, president of San Francisco-based
Southern Pacific.
   Rio Grande Industries, which also owns the Denver and Rio Grande
Western railroads, last month announced it had agreed to buy 532
miles of railroad between Kansas City and Chicago from the Soo Line
Corp. An application to the ICC for approval of the sale is being
prepared.

   An eighth-grade dropout convicted of
murdering a woman 12 years ago after meeting her at a bar was put
to death by lethal injection.
   Winford Stokes, 39, was pronounced dead at 9:39 p.m. CDT Friday
after receiving lethal doses of sodium pentothal, Pavlon and sodium
chloride at the Potosi Correctional Center.
   The U.S. Supreme Court and the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
had denied last-ditch requests to block the execution.
   Stokes was sentenced for the Feb. 18, 1978, strangling and
stabbing of 33-year-old Pamela Benda, a waitress from University
City, a St. Louis suburb.
   Stokes, who had escaped from a mental hospital, killed Benda
after meeting her in a bar and going to her apartment for sex.
   Stokes previously had been convicted in the 1977 slaying of an
elderly St. Louis woman and the shooting death of a St. Louis
tavern owner in 1969.
   His wife, Evette, met with the condemned man for most of the
afternoon, prison spokesman Dale Riley said. Stokes had no last
words and asked for no personal witnesses at his execution.
   After the curtains to the death chamber viewing area were
opened, Stokes lifted his head to look at the witnesses and the IV
bag from which the lethal chemical flowed. Then he blinked his eyes
rapidly and lay back on the gurney.
   ``Justice has been served. This regrettable event is necessary
to reaffirm the value the state of Missouri places on innocent
human life,'' Gov. John Ashcroft said in a prepared statement.
   Stokes was the third person put to death in Missouri since 1976,
when the Supreme Court ruled that states could resume carrying out
the death penalty. He was the 125th person in the nation executed
since then.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Ruling Sends Woman Across State Line For Abortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman carrying a severely deformed fetus was
left with a choice of a 250-mile trip to get an abortion or going
to another state because of the Supreme Court's ruling on
Missouri's abortion law, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   In its ruling July 3, the U.S. Supreme Court said Missouri can
bar public hospitals from performing abortions. Within hours of
that decision, Truman Medical Center, a public hospital in Kansas
City, ordered its doctors to stop performing abortions.
   The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that a 24-year-old woman
was referred to a specialist at Truman who confirmed through tests
that the 19-week-old fetus she was carrying had deformities that
made survival outside the womb impossible. A doctor familiar with
the case told the newspaper the fetus' heart was outside the chest
wall and that its abdominal organs were outside the abdominal wall.
   ``Before the Supreme Court decision, she would have had a
therapeutic abortion at Truman,'' said Dr. Howard Schwartz, an
obstetrician and gynecologist who was a consultant on the case.
   Truman was believed to be the only site in Kansas City where
second-trimester abortions were widely available before the Supreme
Court ruling. After the ruling, the nearest clinic in Missouri
where the woman could have gotten a second-trimester abortion was
across the state in St. Louis, a 250-mile drive.
   Instead, the woman was referred to Comprehensive Health for
Women, a private gynecological clinic in nearby Overland Park,
Kan., a Kansas City suburb about 20 miles away.
   The fetus was aborted in a two-day procedure July 11 and 12, and
the woman's insurance company paid for it.
   Schwartz said he thought the woman's abortion was the first of
what would ``turn out to be many cases of Missouri women crossing
to another state or traveling to St. Louis to obtain abortions.''
   Adele Hughey, executive director of Comprehensive Health, said
abortion was the woman's ``only real option.''
   ``The condition of the fetus was totally incompatible with
life,'' Hughey said. ``She could have carried the fetus through the
entire term of pregnancy, knowing that the outcome would be a dead
baby, or have an abortion and then try to get pregnant again. But
by carrying the fetus to term, she might have jeopardized her own
health and also delayed another pregnancy.''

MIKE PENNER: FEAR HAS SETTLED IN ON 49ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Suddenly, something new fills the air above Nob Hill and Fisherman's Wharf. 
Suddenly, fog is out and doubt is in, the mighty 49er dynasty cast adrift like 
the runaway Fuji blimp that threatened to turn Ram Sunday into Black Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"When we lose one, it's like a death in the family," says San Francisco tight 
end Jamie Williams. "We kinda take it hard." 
</P>
<P>
So does the city. On most days, it prefers its proper designation, The City, 
but during this week of civic mourning, in lieu of black arm bands, all letters 
are at half-mast. 
</P>
<P>
The city has been shaken and this time, not by Mother Nature. The city has seen 
the Falling of the Forty-Niners, for the first time in a full year, but worse 
than that, the team failed to go down nobly, as the local gentry would have 
imagined it. 
</P>
<P>
There was no Joe Montana gallantly firing away until time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
There was no Ronnie Lott lunging after his man in the end zone, gripping a 
pulled hamstring as the winning pass eluded him by inches. 
</P>
<P>
There was no comeback, no overtime, no one-point loss to an opponent deemed 
worthy of the feat, such as Sir Phil Simms and the esteemed New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
No, this loss was as ugly as the quagmire that passed for the field at 
Candlestick Park. This loss was about Captain Montana throwing three 
interceptions; about 49er ballcarriers fumbling three times; about Lott getting 
beat for a pivotal 53-yard completion; about the Red &amp; Gold defense 
surrendering a 95-yard scoring drive in the mud and the rain late in the fourth 
quarter -- a total system shut down in the clutch. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, this was a loss to the riffraff and the rabble, to the black sheep of 
the division, to the louts from down south -- the Rams, owners of a pregame 
record of 3-7 and the kind of defense Montana usually dunks into his morning 
coffee. 
</P>
<P>
Deep-fried and glazed, with a hole in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
Against this defense, which would rank last in a league without the Detroit 
Lions, the 49ers committed six turnovers, converted three of 10 third-down 
attempts, scored two touchdowns and were held to 291 yards -- nearly 90 shy of 
their weekly average. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite sure how to react -- the Niners hadn't lost since Nov. 19, 1989 -- 
the city has overreacted. Sunday morning, it was God, country and 49er 
football. By Monday morning, it was Faith No More. 
</P>
<P>
Some postgame headlines: 
</P>
<P>
 Why Can't They Run? 
</P>
<P>
 49ers' Ground Game Worries Seifert 
</P>
<P>
 Secondary Isn't Too Impressive, Either 
</P>
<P>
The sure sign of panic in San Francisco: When they start second-guessing 
Montana. Tuesday, one newspaper printed its weekly 49er report card and graded 
Montana out at D-, wondering why St. Joe didn't scramble when "he could have 
run for a two-yard TD in the third quarter but (instead) threw incomplete and 
the 49ers didn't score." 
</P>
<P>
Next, an appointment awaits with the team they call the Giants, which, this 
year, is both a nickname and a description. It will be 10-1 vs. 10-1 in front 
of the Monday Night Football cameras. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers keep saying they aren't worried, but why do we keep hearing nervous 
talk? 
</P>
<P>
Offensive lineman Harris Barton says, forebodingly, "The Giants play better 
defense than the Rams, I can tell you that right now." 
</P>
<P>
Coach George Seifert labels the week ahead, the limbo between defeat and the 
Giant struggle, as "kind of a glum situation." He warns, too, of pressure. "You 
don't want to be the team that winds up with two losses in a row." 
</P>
<P>
The concern is justified. Say this for the Rams: They've finally found their 
purpose in life. They're not going to the playoffs and they're not going to get 
the No. 1 draft choice, but they have served as a valuable barometer in trying 
to gauge the weather next Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
Rams 28, 49ers 17. 
</P>
<P>
Giants 31, Rams 7. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the clues as to what's in store -- and good clues they are. The 
Giants should beat the 49ers for the same reason the Rams split their games 
with the NFL's elite. It involves moving the football on the ground and only 
one of the teams involved can do it with power, consistency and precision. 
</P>
<P>
They might be Giants. 
</P>
<P>
New York's rushing offense has the big (Ottis Anderson) and the short (Dave 
Meggett) of it, plus a mid-sized rookie (Rodney Hampton) who's a threat inside 
and out. Against the Rams, three running backs scored for the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
With San Francisco, the problem is Montana. The 49ers now depend so heavily on 
their quarterback that their running game is a victim of neglect. After 11 
games, San Francisco ranks dead-last in average gain per rushing attempt (3.3) 
and 24th in average rushing yards per game (88.6). Against the Rams, the 49ers 
netted 66 yards on the ground -- 44 in 13 carries by Roger Craig, with Montana 
outgaining his fullback, Tom Rathman, 15 yards to seven. 
</P>
<P>
Do the 49ers have enough ground force to overtake another Super Bowl? "I don't 
know," Seifert says. "I think it's a good question." It wasn't raised before 
because 10-0 teams tote few questions. "You win ballgames," Seifert says, "and 
you may have a tendency to overlook some things." 
</P>
<P>
In San Francisco, they're not overlooking anymore. In San Francisco, the 
two-time defending Super Bowl champion 49ers have lost to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
Once that happens, you begin to fear that anything is possible.

49ERS MAKING ANOTHER RUN AT RAMS; 
</P>
<P>
NFC: SAN FRANCISCO, WHICH IGNITED ITS GROUND GAME LAST WEEK, TRIES TO AVENGE 
ITS ONLY DEFEAT TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Having rediscovered their running game, their zest for late-season charges and 
their ability to rely on Joe Montana in clutch situations, the San Francisco 
49ers get a chance on prime-time television to rediscover a way to beat the 
Rams, the team that wrecked their try for perfection. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, the 49ers come to their home-away-from-home, Anaheim Stadium (where 
Montana is 8-0 in games he has started), with a 12-1 record and the vivid 
recollections of their 28-17 loss to the Rams at Candlestick Park three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Ronnie Lott, their Pro Bowl safety and emotional bonfire, injured his knees two 
weeks ago and could require surgery that would put him out for the season. But 
the 49ers' machine just rolls on, popping new bodies into the void and eager to 
banish all thoughts of 1990's only blemish. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, for really the first time all season, the 49ers cranked out a 
powerful running attack in their overtime defeat of the Cincinnati Bengals, 
piling up more than 200 yards and re-energizing the battered body of tailback 
Roger Craig, who gained 97 of his own. Of course, they won it in the end on a 
couple of Montana-led late-game drives, but what's the news in that? 
</P>
<P>
Before last week, the 49er offense was strictly airborne, a method that crashed 
and burned when the Rams played a four-safety "big nickel" defense most of the 
game, switched their coverages relentlessly to confuse Montana, clogged up the 
passing lanes and dared the 49ers to run. 
</P>
<P>
After last week, the 49ers are running, and the Rams know that they'll have to 
do something vastly different this week in order to keep the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
"They won the (Cincinnati) ballgame, and that's what the 49ers do extremely 
well," said Fritz Shurmer, the Rams' defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
"They win. They find a way to win the ballgame, whether it's last week running 
the ball 40 times for over 200 yards or it's with Joe with the ball in his 
hands on the last drive. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the thing that makes them great. Or if they've got to win one, 7-3, 
like they did (against the New York Giants), win it with their defense. That's 
what this team is. This team is a great football team that has a great capacity 
to be able to do whatever they need to do to win the football game. And if 
they've got to run 40 times to do it, they do it. And if they've got to throw 
it 50 times, they'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
The last time these two teams met in Anaheim, it took perhaps Montana's finest 
single-game performance ever to beat the Rams. Trailing, 24-10, going into the 
final quarter, Montana put 20 points on the board in that quarter, and passed 
for 458 yards overall to lead the 49ers to a stunning 30-27 victory. 
</P>
<P>
That was just the latest chapter in Montana and the 49ers' tradition of 
walloping their Orange County hosts. Montana, in his eight games at Anaheim, 
has averaged 321.5 yards of passing and thrown for a total of 17 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know why that happens," Craig said. "But we can't go off the history 
of saying we win down there all the time so it's going to be a cakewalk for us. 
No, the Rams will be fired up. And they have more incentive now to play us than 
the first time they played us this year." 
</P>
<P>
The Rams limp into this game out of the playoff picture for the first time in 
three seasons. So, at 5-8, they are clutching at one final goal for 1990: 
</P>
<P>
Mess up the 49ers' season as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the league doesn't quite seem to be up to knocking off the two-time 
defending Super Bowl champions, who are vying with the Chicago Bears and the 
Giants for home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, but another Rams' 
victory almost certainly would do away with that air of 49er invincibility. If 
the Rams can sweep the 49ers, why can't a team with a winning record? 
</P>
<P>
"It'd be great, it'd be great for us," Ram defensive end Doug Reed said. 
"Knowing that we beat them twice (with another victory tonight). I think that's 
what it's all about at this point. Beating them and playing a hell of a 
football game." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, by the way, not only are quite comfortable in Anaheim Stadium, but 
everywhere: they have won 16 consecutive road games dating to 1988, and it's 18 
in a row if you count their two neutral site Super Bowl victories in that span. 
</P>
<P>
So don't ask Ram Coach John Robinson why the 49ers play so well in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no explanation for it," Robinson said. "I just don't know. That 
question has been asked, (but) I have no idea. The 49ers have played well in a 
lot of stadiums, what, 18 in a row, some number that's way out there. Fabulous. 
They don't lose on the road." 
</P>
<P>
One thing Robinson can explain is the most underestimated part of the 49ers' 
team: Their defense. In their last meeting, the Rams piled up 350 yards against 
the 49ers, whose best defensive player, linebacker Charles Haley, was banged 
up. Haley is injury-free now and leading the NFC with 14 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers have the seventh-rated defense overall and are the No. 2 defense 
against the rush. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they have a great defensive team," Robinson said. "I can't imagine why 
people don't talk about what they've done. I guess people don't understand . . 
. what they've done defensively because they tend not to be individuals, they 
tend to be a group. 
</P>
<P>
"They're so much better than any other defense that I've dealt with over a 
period of time. There's been periods when other defenses have risen and such, 
but this is a consistently outstanding defense. And in big games, they play 
marvelous football. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take the time . . . you look back at their defensive record, in the 
games that were really big, they were phenomenal. Sometimes the other team 
scored, but it was usually in the last quarter when they were ahead by along 
ways. It's a very impressive group." 
</P>
<P>
Even without Lott? Last week, with Lott out, veteran Dave Waymer moved over to 
free safety and Johnny Jackson started at strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, he's missed some games," Robinson said. "I think it's a major blow to 
them, but they're used to it. They've never lost a game with him out, so I 
think they'll survive." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Coach George Seifert says he isn't a bit surprised that his 
former boss, Bill Walsh, is the subject of speculation about a number of 
coaching jobs. "I don't believe any of us are surprised by any of it," Seifert 
said. "He's one of the great coaches ever to coach in this game and probably 
did as fine a job as has been done as far as putting together a team and 
building it into the type of organization, along with Eddie (DeBartolo), our 
owner, as has been done over the years." . . . The Rams are 17-17 overall on 
Monday nights; the 49ers are 15-12. . . . The Rams' 5-8 record is their worst 
through 13 game since 1981, when they also started 5-8. To find a worse Ram 
record through 13 games, you have to go all the way back to 1965, when they 
started 3-10.

TAMPA BAY TOPS ON WALSH'S LIST IF HE LEAVES TELEVISION

<P>
Bill Walsh says he plans to wait until after the NFL playoffs to decide whether 
to stay in broadcasting or return to football, but the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
would be his top choice if he chooses the latter. 
</P>
<P>
"If I pick a team to sign with, Tampa Bay would be at the top of my list," 
Walsh told the St. Petersburg Times on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"But there's a lot that would have to occur before we finalized something." 
</P>
<P>
However, there is other interest in Walsh. The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer quoted 
unidentified sources as saying three teams have contacted the former 49er 
coach, possibly including the Rams. Tampa Bay and Cleveland were the other 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper did not elaborate on potential interest from the Rams. Walsh has 
seven games left on his two-year contract with NBC as a football analyst. 
</P>
<P>
Although not in a hurry to make a decision about his future, Walsh thinks Tampa 
Bay could be a good opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"I have great respect for (owner) Hugh Culverhouse and great respect for the 
whole organization," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
"I also think Tampa Bay can become competitive and real contenders in that 
division (NFC Central) right away. It's just a matter of me looking into 
whether I want to leave the San Francisco area at this stage of my life. That 
would be the prime consideration." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh said he has not talked directly with Culverhouse, but that he has had two 
conversations with San Francisco owner Eddie DeBartolo and 49ers president 
Carmen Policy about the Buccaneers' coaching vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
He said Culverhouse had asked DeBartolo and Policy to present Tampa Bay's 
position in preliminary discussions. 
</P>
<P>
"Like I said, there's a lot that would have to happen before we finalized 
anything," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland owner Art Modelll would not comment on the situation.

   The city's new daily newspaper, the St. Louis
Sun, is scheduled to hit the streets Sept. 25, its owner says.
   ``We're right on budget and right on schedule,'' Ralph Ingersoll
II, the newspaper's chairman and editor in chief, said at a news
conference Tuesday in the Sun's downtown newsroom overlooking the
Mississippi River and the Gateway Arch.
   The Sun, a morning tabloid, will cost 25 cents every day except
Saturday when it will publish an expanded weekend edition that will
sell for $1 and include two glossy magazines and advertising
supplements.
   The Washington Times, a newspaper owned by affiliates of the
South Korean-based Unification Church headed by Rev. Sun Myung
Moon, was the last major metropolitan newspaper to be started in
the United States. It began in 1982.
   Ingersoll, chairman of the Princeton, N.J.-based Ingersoll
Publications Co., said the Sun hopes to lead the way in the
newspaper industry with its expanded Saturday edition.
   ``Changing lifestyles and workplace habits convince us that
Saturday morning will continue to increase in importance as the
prime time for weekend newspaper publication,'' he said.
   Ingersoll's publishing company owns 40 daily and 150 non-daily
newpapers in the United States and also publishes 14 papers in
England and Ireland. The company employs 11,000 people.
   It also operates a chain of suburban newspapers in the St. Louis
area, which Ingersoll said has helped the Sun get started.
   The Sun will compete with the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which has
operated alone in the city since 1986 when its longtime rival, the
St. Louis Globe-Democrat, folded.
   The Post-Dispatch has a circulation of 371,000 during the week
and 551,000 on Sunday. It costs a quarter during the week and its
Sunday edition costs $1.
   Ingersoll said the Sun hopes to have 75,000 subscribers
immediately and will be able to break even if circulation climbs to
100,000. He said he's not looking to pass the Post-Dispatch in
circulation numbers.
   The new newspaper has hired about a third of its editorial staff
and has trained its display advertising staff, which will begin
selling ads soon, Ingersoll said.
   A sample front-page showed a bright and colorful layout with
only headlines and teasers promoting sports, business and other
news stories inside the paper.

SPORTS ET CETERA: HOLIDAY BOWL ON A SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the first time in the game's history, the Sea World Holiday Bowl this year 
will be played on a Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 13th annual game will be played at 4:30 p.m. Dec. 29, also the earliest 
kickoff in its history, the game committee announced. 
</P>
<P>
"The weekend date means local fans will not have to battle rush-hour traffic to 
get to the stadium, and those coming from out of the area will also find 
Saturday a more convenient date," Holiday Bowl President L. Robert Payne said.

Milan Mandaric, owner of the MISL St. Louis Storm, said he is optimistic that 
his team will not fold, as has been rumored, and set Monday as the date a 
decision will be made on the future of the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
Mandaric, who lives in San Jose, has been looking for St. Louis investors for 
his financially ailing team. He said "some" St. Louis business leaders have 
come forward and that St. Louis Mayor Vince Schoemehl has begun soliciting 
support on Mandaric's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of things are happening in the last minute," Mandaric said Friday. "The 
mayor of the city and others want to give some support to the club, and I'm 
waiting to see how things develop." 
</P>
<P>
The fate of the eight-team league could hinge on that of St. Louis. Other 
owners reportedly do not want to go forward with just seven teams.

<TEXT>
   In the newsroom of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
editors, reporters and clerks left their desks and gathered around a
microphone to hear a talk from the chief.
   ``Our confidence is strong, our spirits are high, our adrenalin
is running and we've done this without steroids,'' said Joseph
Pulitzer, Jr., chairman of the Pulitzer Publishing Co. and grandson
of the founder of the Post-Dispatch.
   It was a pep talk for the journalism troops who are preparing to
begin the nation's newest newspaper war, a battle the newspaper
industry is watching closely.
   The confrontation starts Monday when the tabloid newcomer, the
St. Louis Sun, owned and edited by Ralph Ingersoll II, hits the
street.
   Ingersoll, whose Ingersoll Publications Co. owns a chain of 43
free weekly or bi-weekly newspapers with a circulation of 700,000 in
the suburbs of St. Louis, is trying to buck the trend of newspapers
closing up or merging because they can't attract enough readers or
advertising to make money.
   So far, the specter of competition has been good for the historic
Post-Dispatch, which will be 111 years old in December, said
Nicholas G. Penniman IV, the newspaper's publisher.
   The paid daily circulation of the newspaper has been steadily
increasing this summer, Penniman said. Compared with the same period
last year, daily circulation is up about 8,000 and Sunday
circulation has increased by about 15,000.
   ``Part of the increase is because of baseball, part of it is
because we are making aggressive attempts to sell the Post-Dispatch,
and thirdly, I think people appreciate the Post-Dispatch and enjoy
it,'' he said.
   Penniman said the Post-Dispatch now has a daily circulation of
about 380,000 and a Sunday circulation of about 565,000. The Sun
hopes to have at least 75,000 subscribers at the outset; it already
has signed up more than 50,000, said Robert M. Jelenic, president
and chief executive of the Sun.
   Penniman said that as far as the Post-Dispatch can tell, it has
lost only 50 subscribers to the Sun, and the amount spent on retail
advertising by the Post-Dispatch's 10 largest accounts is up about 5
percent from last year.
   Meanwhile, in the Post-Dispatch newsroom, ideas and ideals have
been flying.
   ``It's a little bit like an athletic competition,'' said David
Lipman, the managing editor. ``There's no question there's a sense
of anticipation and excitement about the competition.''
   He said the Sun has allowed editors to make changes that had been
proposed for at least a year, including increasing sports and
business coverage and adding a news summary.
   The Post-Dispatch also has redesigned several sections of the
paper and hired a full-time writing coach, longtime chief copy
editor Harry Levins.
   Lipman said the changes were not made to match the Sun, which has
touted itself as planning to be a colorful, easy-to-read ``laptop''
newspaper with extra emphasis on sports.
   ``We would have made these changes whether there was some new
competition or not,'' he said. `'We are going to continue putting
out an ever-improving newspaper no matter what distractions or
attractions come to St. Louis.''
   Expectations of St. Louis residents toward the two newspapers may
differ, according to Charles Klotzer, editor of the St. Louis
Journalism Review.
   `'I think the first questions that are asked about the Sun and
the Post-Dispatch depict immediately how the newspapers are viewed
in the community,'' Klotzer said.
   ``When we talk about the Sun, we ask, `Do you think it's going to
make a profit,' and when we talk about the Post-Dispatch, we ask,
`Do you think it's going to be a better newspaper.'''
   Penniman, speaking to a recent Missouri newspaper meeting, said
some people believe ``we'll be like the 800-pound gorilla and crush
the Sun.'' But he added that this would not be true.
   ``We don't want to be the only paper in St. Louis, we want to be
the best,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
So the 49ers won at Anaheim Stadium and the Rams won at Candlestick Park. What 
else is new? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Don't blame this one on Cleveland Gary. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Fred Claire shouldn't have to apologize for trading Hubie Brooks and keeping a 
younger and better hitter, Kal Daniels. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Less than 48 hours after the Dodgers dealt Brooks to the New York Mets for Bob 
Ojeda, they sang happy birthday to Ojeda at a Stadium Club news conference and 
wheeled out a cake big enough for 33 candles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Gary Carter would be a good pickup for a team whose candidates to back up 
catcher Mike Scioscia are Carlos Hernandez and Barry Lyons. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Dodger-Giant rivalry is bound to heat up this season when Brett Butler-Kal 
Daniels-Darryl Strawberry-Eddie Murray are matched against Willie McGee-Will 
Clark-Kevin Mitchell-Matt Williams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
So much for the depiction of Peter O'Malley as an owner who is satisfied to 
have a winning team that makes money and won't spend that extra buck to win a 
pennant. . . . 
</P>
<P>
You would have thought that the Angels finished first in the American League 
West last season, not 23 games out in fourth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jack (the Ripper) Clark, a pull-hitting right-handed slugger, seems made to 
order for Fenway Park. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Bo Jackson's 88-yard run against Cincinnati was only the third-longest of his 
Raider career. He went 92 against the Bengals last year and 91 at Seattle in 
1987. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jackson and Eric Dickerson of the Indianapolis Colts each gained 117 yards 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The difference was that Bo carried the ball eight times at the Coliseum and 
Dickerson 28 times against the New York Jets at the Meadowlands. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No Los Angeles NFL running back has been as exciting as Jackson since Jaguar 
Jon Arnett was dodging, darting and dashing for the Rams from 1957-63. . . . 
</P>
<P>
All four quarterbacks who went down over the weekend -- Jim Kelly, Phil Simms, 
Jim Harbaugh and Steve DeBerg -- were playing on artificial turf. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bears were more fun to watch when Mike Ditka was throwing temper 
tantrums on the sideline. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Peter Tom Willis, the rookie from Florida State, should develop into the best 
of the Bear quarterbacks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Smiling Rodney Peete seems to enjoy his work. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The New England Patriots aren't as good as their record would indicate. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Late-season NFL cliche: "We can control our own destiny." . . . 
</P>
<P>
You know the Broncos are having a lousy season when there are 11,042 no-shows 
for a game against San Diego at Denver. . . . 
</P>
<P>
There have been 13 sellouts for hockey at the Forum this season and only one 
for basketball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Twenty Washington football players were named first- or second-team or 
honorable mention All-Pacific 10. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The new cradle of college football coaches is UCLA. Six of Terry Donahue's 
former assistants are head coaches -- Jim Colletto at Purdue, Gary Blackney at 
Bowling Green, Rich Brooks at Oregon, Dick Tomey at Arizona, Steve Axman at 
Northern Arizona and Don Riley at East Tennessee State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Roy Firestone got three standing ovations -- and several sitting -- on opening 
night at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
All is peaceful in Naples, where Diego Maradona has returned to the starting 
eleven. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Harry Ornest, the former owner of the St. Louis Blues who was involved in a 
scuffle with John Forsythe in the Hollywood Park Turf Club on Sunday, must have 
seen too many hockey fights. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KO magazine rates Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez, who defends his World Boxing 
Council light-flyweight title against Rolando Pascua Wednesday at the Forum, as 
the most feared fighter in the world. Ranked behind the 108-pound slugger are 
the considerably bigger Michael Moorer and Mike Tyson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Patrick Ewing, who is eligible to become a restricted free agent next season, 
will make at least $5.7 million if he stays with New York. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Seattle would like to deal Dale Ellis as soon as he returns to the court and 
displays his old skills. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland, seeking a replacement for Mark Price, is among those teams 
interested in Minnesota guard Pooh Richardson. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Detroit isn't quite the same without James Edwards, who is injured. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Morton Downey Jr., the controversial former TV talk show host, was one of the 
organizers of the old American Basketball Assn. . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA's No. 5 ranking in basketball is the Bruins' highest since late in the 
1982-83 season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Forum claims to have broken even financially on its first Chicago show, but 
the local favorite, junior welterweight Louie Lomeli, got knocked out in the 
first round. . . . 
</P>
<P>
If Pete Sampras doesn't watch out, he'll give men's professional tennis a good 
name.

<HEAD>Up to 40,000 Anti-Abortion Protesters Rally in St. Louis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Up to 40,000 people in St. Louis rallied to demonstrate their
hope the U.S. Supreme Court will overturn the 1973 decision that
legalized abortions, and more than 100 anti-abortion protesters
were arrested in Cleveland.
   In Pittsburgh, about 4,000 people sang and prayed, carrying
balloons and placards during an anti-abortion rally in the city's
Market Square. The protesters paraded through the downtown shopping
area in a light rain Saturday during the 10th Annual Greater
Pittsburgh March for Life.
   The St. Louis demonstrators gathered at Kiener Plaza on Sunday
without incident and no arrests were made, said police Lt. Roy
Miller.
   Organizers called it the largest anti-abortion rally in St.
Louis. But several police officers at the scene and pro-choice
supporters disagreed with the official crowd estimate. They said
only about 5,000 to 10,000 demonstrators were on hand.
   In Cleveland, 119 protesters were arrested Saturday outside of
two abortion clinics. They were charged with aggravated disorderly
conduct, resisting arrest and criminal trespassing.
   Edward J. Heben Jr., a lawyer representing the protesters, said
his clients planned to plead innocent to all charges today in
Cleveland Municipal Court.
   St. Louis demonstrators marched several blocks through downtown,
some holding balloons and banners. One teen-age girl carried a sign
saying, ``Thanks, Mom!''
   The ``Show-Me Life'' rally came several weeks after the U.S.
Supreme Court heard arguments in a Missouri abortion case that
could be used to overturn the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision that
legalized the procedure in 1973.
   The court is expected to announce its decision this summer in
that case, Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services.
   The Missouri law at issue, passed in 1986, declares that human
life begins at conception. It restricts abortion by banning the
procedure in publicly financed hospitals and by forbidding the use
of public funds.
   Loretto Wagner of Missouri Citizens for Life said rally
organizers hoped to impress the Supreme Court with the number of
people who attended the St. Louis event.
   During the rally, about 85 pro-choice supporters stood across
from Kiener Plaza. One woman carried a giant white coat hanger with
the messages ``Never again'' and ``Keep abortion safe and legal.''
   ``We just wanted to be a thorn in their side, to keep them
honest,'' said Brooke Petersen, a board member of the Missouri
affiliate of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   The anti-abortion rally was sponsored by Missouri Citizens for
Life, along with the Archdiocesan Pro-Life Committee, the Christian
Action Council and Clergy for Life.

<P>
WHEN QUESTIONS ARISE, MIAMI HAS THE ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHRIS DUFRESNE, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it came time to pull two first-round triggers, the Rams were left stunned 
at what remained on Sunday's draft table. So they stalked and talked and darn 
near balked, waiting until waning seconds before finally turning to Miami 
Twice. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't supposed to be so difficult. The Rams were almost locked into Miami 
defensive end Bill Hawkins at pick 21, but were forced to reconsider with so 
many blue-chippers left. 
</P>
<P>
Gnashing teeth as minutes passed, the Rams were left to ponder: How do you not 
take cornerback Louis Oliver, considered a top 10 pick in most circles? Or 
receiver Andre Rison? Or fullback Cleveland Gary? What were the Rams doing with 
this incredible opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
Panicking, as it turns out. With only 16 seconds left to choose in their 
allotted 15 minutes, the Rams scribbled Hawkins' name on some paper and raced 
it to the podium. 
</P>
<P>
They resisted temptation in the end and stuck to their guns, passing on the 
best-available athlete theory to fill a long-standing need at defensive end. It 
seemed a victory for the coaching staff, defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur in 
particular. This wasn't a public relations pick. 
</P>
<P>
So Bill Hawkins it was. He's tall (6-6) and lean (265) and was a three-year 
starter for the Hurricanes, who lost one football game the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"He has a chance to develop into the big-time pass rusher we've always talked 
about but never found," Ram Coach John Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson wasn't out of the woods yet. 
</P>
<P>
Five picks later at 26, Miami fullback Cleveland Gary was still on the board 
and flashing like neon lights in front of Robinson's eyes. The Rams were still 
thinking defense, or maybe tight end. But not a fullback. Only minutes before, 
Robinson said that Robert Delpino, last year's rookie sensation, was a 
perfectly capable fullback. 
</P>
<P>
But this time the Rams couldn't pass on a big-name talent. They used every 
second of their 15 minutes and finally decided on Gary, passing over Auburn 
tight end Lawyer Tillman and Tennessee linebacker Keith DeLong. 
</P>
<P>
Just what the Rams need, another running back. But Robinson coached Gary in the 
Senior Bowl and claims he's one of the best receiving backs to come out of 
college in years. 
</P>
<P>
Gary wasn't as thrilled over the developments, figuring he never should have 
lasted long enough to become a Ram. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think I'd be there," said Gary, who considered himself a top 10 pick. 
"But the decision's been made and I'm and L.A. Ram. I love it. . . . You have 
to prepare for things like that. I'm elated that it's over." 
</P>
<P>
Next question: Are there enough footballs to go around? The Rams are suddenly 
well-stocked in the backfield, Gary joining a team that includes Greg Bell, 
Delpino, Buford McGee and last year's first round choice, Gaston Green. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson seems to think he can keep everyone happy. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an area that we once did not have any depth," Robinson said. "We now have 
depth. This isn't a game where you can have one deep. It just isn't." 
</P>
<P>
But doesn't something have to give? Is Greg Bell on the trading block? 
</P>
<P>
"No," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
What about Gary being a makeup pick for Green, who played sparingly as a 
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard one genius say that it's indicative of our feelings for Gaston Green," 
Robinson responded. "But that's way off. It's not even close." 
</P>
<P>
Only time will tell whether the Rams will regret taking Gary over DeLong, a Ram 
favorite who went two picks later to the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
A brief look at the rest of the Rams' Sunday picks: 
</P>
<P>
Second Round 
</P>
<P>
45th choice -- Frank Stams, linebacker, Notre Dame. The final payoff for Eric 
Dickerson, Stams gives the Rams another outside pass rusher to go with Hawkins. 
Robinson compares Stams to the NFL's second-leading quarterback sacker last 
season. Lawrence Taylor? Bruce Smith? No, Kevin Greene, remember? The Rams' 
outside linebacker finished with 16 1/2, trailing only Reggie White of the 
Philadelphia Eagles for the league lead. 
</P>
<P>
"We see him like Kevin Greene," Robinson said of Stams. "He came off the corner 
for Notre Dame much like Kevin Greene did for us." 
</P>
<P>
Stams is a converted fullback and one of several prime-time players from Notre 
Dame's national championship defense. He led the Irish with seven sacks in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
One knock on Stams is his inability to drop into pass coverage. The Rams 
knocked on wood. Robinson spoke of Stams as if he were a son. 
</P>
<P>
'I'm not supposed to get emotionally involved with guys," he said. "But I 
really feel good about this guy." 
</P>
<P>
48th pick -- Brian Smith, defensive end/linebacker, Auburn. Like Hawkins, Smith 
is 6-foot-6, giving the Rams a pair of ends who can peer over a line of 
scrimmage for a change; unlike say, a Donald Evans. Rams' personnel director 
John Math calls Smith "747" because of his large wing span. He's also been 
called "String Bean," but that's what weight rooms are for. Smith is listed at 
245 pounds, though Robinson envisions him at 270 pounds some day. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a Richard Dent-type," said Robinson, careful not to actually compare 
Smith to the Chicago Bears' All-Pro. 
</P>
<P>
53rd pick -- Darryl Henley, cornerback, UCLA. He returns to a Bruin reunion 
that includes Gaston Green, James Washington, Flipper Anderson, Duval Love, et 
al. At 5-feet-8 and 165 pounds, Henley lacks size and muscle, but could be the 
punt returner the Rams have been looking for since receiver Henry Ellard became 
too valuable to risk returning kicks. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a great punt returner, and that's very positive for us," Robinson said. 
"His lack of size probably kept him from being a first-round corner. He played 
like a first-round corner." 
</P>
<P>
Henley's best shot this season seems to be as a nickel-back player. 
</P>
<P>
Third Round 
</P>
<P>
75th pick overall -- Kevin Robbins, offensive tackle, Michigan State. Right 
now, he's just the answer to Tony Mandarich's trivia question: Name the other 
tackle at Michigan State last season. Yes, it was Robbins, who pales in 
comparison to Mandarich at only 6-foot-4 and 286 pounds. Robbins, however, was 
an Academic All-Big 10 Conference selection. 
</P>
<P>
Fourth Round 
</P>
<P>
102nd pick overall -- Jeff Carlson, quarterback, Weber State. A local product 
from Pacifica High School in Cypress, Carlson could be that developmental 
quarterback Robinson was talking about. The lefthander passed for more than 
5,000 yards in his college career. 
</P>
<P>
Fifth Round 
</P>
<P>
135th pick overall -- Alfred Jackson, cornerback, San Diego State. A wide 
receiver in college, Jackson will compete for a spot in a very crowded Rams 
secondary. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
As exected, Robinson said Sunday he would soon meet with veteran linebacker 
Carl Ekern, 34, and fullback Mike Guman, 31, and probably ask both to retire. .

MELVIN DURSLAG: IF OTHER CITIES DO IT, WHY NOT L.A.? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
If you are following events on planet jock, you doubtless are aware that a new 
stadium is being built on the South Side of Chicago to shelter the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
A dome is under construction in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis has voted funds for a football stadium to serve as home for an NFL 
team the city aims to capture. 
</P>
<P>
And Cleveland has just come in with a vote to build a complex that would serve 
the baseball Indians outdoors and the basketball Cavaliers under a roof. 
</P>
<P>
You know, of course, that Chicago, Cleveland, Atlanta and St. Louis have no 
homeless. They have no problems with education, no problems with public works, 
no problems with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Such problems are peculiar only to Los Angeles, where it doesn't seem possible 
to get a new stadium airborne. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1920s, Los Angeles doesn't even build the Coliseum. When voters reject 
the project, local newspaper publishers get a bond floated to finance the 
edifice. It is a sterling effort until the publishers handed over management of 
the stadium to the city, county and state, forming a body called the Coliseum 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
That is like handing over the British Museum to Larry, Curly and Moe. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Los Angeles tries to build a baseball stadium with the idea of 
bagging a major league team. This venture fails, too. 
</P>
<P>
The city finally give land to the Dodgers, who built the stadium with their own 
money. 
</P>
<P>
Tapping the old scalp, the Coliseum Commission then underwrites bonds to build 
the indoor Sports Arena, to be paid off, for the most part, from revenues from 
basketball and hockey tenants. 
</P>
<P>
The only trouble is, the Commission ticks off the guy controlling pro 
basketball and hockey, and he moves his teams to a stadium he builds in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
Now stuck with the bond obligation, the Coliseum earmarks money from its 
football tenants to pay off the Sports Arena, except the principal tenant, the 
Rams, moves to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
When a pro replacement, the Raiders, arrives, a college tenant, UCLA, moves to 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
So now we sit down for a review. We have a pro football team called Los Angeles 
in Anaheim, another in the Coliseum. We have a college football team in the 
Coliseum, another in Pasadena. We have a college basketball team in Westwood 
and another at the Sports Arena. We have a pro basketball team at the Sports 
Arena and another at Inglewood, where we also have a hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
And the baseball team occupies Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Seven facilities doing the work of maybe four," a cost efficiency expert 
gasps. "With better management, Nicaragua went broke." 
</P>
<P>
Now 67 years old and visibly dated, the Coliseum needs replacing, but it won't 
come off because a cry is heard that the historic beauty of that monument must 
not be defaced. 
</P>
<P>
And, guarding the ramparts of public welfare, political knights awaken our 
conscience to the plight of the homeless, even though the issue is not related 
to a stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Money raised for a stadium is calculated to come back. If a stadium weren't 
built, that money would not go to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
There is still another point to which Cleveland, Chicago, Atlanta and St. Louis 
give thought. Those who aren't homeless outnumber overwhelmingly those who are. 
Lives of everyday people must go on, and so must those of their children. 
</P>
<P>
Forming the backbone of any society, they have something coming from the pot 
into which they ante. 
</P>
<P>
And a sports stadium is a cultural accommodation, as is a music center, an 
opera house, a museum or a zoo. Indulging any of the foregoing, one needn't be 
made to shoulder the guilt. 
</P>
<P>
A few years back, Cleveland voted down a stadium, linked to an excise property 
tax. The new proposition, financed jointly by private and public funds, is tied 
to a sin tax, specifically, on cigarettes and booze. 
</P>
<P>
Minneapolis helped bankroll its Metrodome with a tax on tippling, touching off 
a bitter fight that even went to court. 
</P>
<P>
Drinkers argued that it was illegal to tax them when they had no interest in 
baseball or football. 
</P>
<P>
Baseball and football fans countered they had no interest in drinking, but were 
made to pay for all the problems drinkers create, including a need for 
hospitals to dry them out. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, baseball and football fans prevailed, proving the ideal society is 
one in which there is something for everyone.

<TEXT>
   A new daily tabloid will hit the homes and
newsstands of St. Louis in September, and its publisher will be a
man who has been a top executive at the city's established
newspaper, publishing magnate Ralph Ingersoll II announced Tuesday.
   The newspaper, the St. Louis Sun, will be published seven
mornings a week and compete head-on with the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch, a morning newspaper owned by the Pulitzer Publishing
Co.
   The Post-Dispatch has been the city's only newspaper since the
St. Louis Globe-Democrat folded under financial strain in October
1986.
   ``This is a completely new newspaper,'' Ingersoll said at a news
conference. ``I assure you the Sun will not just be a good
newspaper, it will be a great newspaper.''
   Asked about the slant of the editorial page, Ingersoll said the
paper would be ``a conservator of traditional values.''
   Ingersoll said he will be chairman and editor in chief of the
newspaper and will set up a residence in St. Louis to oversee the
operation initially.
   Robert M. Jelenic, executive vice president of Ingersoll
Publications, will be the president of the new company; and Thomas
M. Tallarico, 44, a senior vice president and general manager of
the Post-Dispatch since 1986, will be the publisher.
   Tallarico submitted his resignation to Post-Dispatch Publisher
Nicholas G. Penniman IV Tuesday morning, sending shock waves
through that newspaper.
   Penniman said he was stunned when Tallarico gave him the news.
Penniman said it was his view that Tallarico had taken on the job
of ``burying the Post-Dispatch.''
   ``We, of course, won't let that happen,'' Penniman said.
   Ingersoll owns the Suburban Journals, 43 non-daily newspapers
published throughout the metropolitan area. He said the Journals
and the Sun would be operated separately.
   Ingersoll said his company has invested more than $100 million
in the St. Louis area with its non-daily publications and is
committing millions more to establish the Sun. He would not divulge
specific figures on the Sun's start-up cost.
   The organization has acquired color-capable presses that can
print 128 pages an issue. The press run will be 200,000 copies,
Ingersoll said.
   The paper, to be housed in a new downtown office building, would
be able to operate successfully with less than 100,000 circulation,
he said. Ingersoll said the Sun will hire a staff of 75 to 100
reporters.
   Ingersoll said he was not concerned that many cities have become
one-newspaper communities due to lack of advertiser support for a
second paper.
   ``We'll be competitive with the Post-Dispatch _ volume one,
number one,'' Ingersoll said. ``The Sun will be profitable in the
second year of its operation, and it will continue to grow.''
   Tallarico said the Sun, unlike many other tabloids in the United
States and Europe, would not emphasize sensational news.
   St. Louis Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr., who was involved in an
attempt to save the Globe-Democrat in 1984, called the announcement
``a very historic day.''
   Ingersoll Publications, a privately held company that had
revenues of more than $700 million in 1988, operates 40 daily
newspapers and more than 150 non-daily newspapers.
   Circulation of the daily newspapers exceeds more than 1.25
million. Its non-daily editions reach an additional 5 million homes.

LANDRY GOING TO CANTON, BUT DAVIS MISSES AGAIN;

<P>
Tom Landry, who coached the Dallas Cowboys for 29 years before he was fired 
last spring, was voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame Saturday along with 
six former NFL players. 
</P>
<P>
But Raider owner Al Davis was denied enshrinement in Canton, Ohio, again, as 
were several of the finest players in the history of football, among them 
Raider quarterback Ken Stabler, Ram defensive end Jack Youngblood, and 
Pittsburgh wide receiver Lynn Swann. 
</P>
<P>
The only Californian elected was Ted Hendricks, the linebacker who finished his 
Raider career in Los Angeles. He moves into the hall with Miami quarterback Bob 
Griese, Kansas City lineman Buck Buchanan, San Francisco lineman Bob St. Clair, 
and two Steelers, halfback Franco Harris and linebacker Jack Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
Selection committee members said that Davis, who was rejected for the fifth 
time in five years, consistently gets the support of well over 20 voters on a 
board that varies from 27 to 30. 
</P>
<P>
But under committee rules, six voters can thumbs-down any nominee, and the 
anti-Davis faction continues to hold the balance of power. 
</P>
<P>
The selectors, who represent newspapers in each NFL city, are known for their 
unpredictable actions. In Saturday's election, for instance, they voted for St. 
Clair over Swann -- although St. Clair is a relatively obscure offensive tackle 
and Swann a champion who was the MVP of Super Bowl XX. 
</P>
<P>
Youngblood and Stabler were voted down although their credentials are 
comparable with most of those elected. 
</P>
<P>
The 1970s defensive captain of the Rams, Youngblood was twice named the NFC's 
top defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
Stabler was the AFC's player of the year at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Swann, Stabler and Youngblood at least made the list of 14 who were voted on 
Saturday. Two who didn't were George Allen, the former Ram and Redskin coach, 
and Tex Schramm, the former Dallas president, who, many selectors said, both 
have impressive Hall of Fame credentials. 
</P>
<P>
Davis made the list of 10 finalists along with those elected and three former 
linemen -- Dan Dierdorf of St. Louis, Larry Little of Miami and Ron Yary of 
Minnesota -- and the Baltimore tight end, John Mackey. 
</P>
<P>
Those opposing Mackey denied that their votes were based on his record as a 
union organizer. 
</P>
<P>
As a Hall of Famer, Landry joins a list of coaches that includes George Halas, 
Vince Lombardi, Sid Gillman, Paul Brown, and others.

   The Interstate Commerce Commission on Friday
approved the proposed sale of the Chicago, Missouri &amp; Western
Railway line between Chicago and East St. Louis, a major step in
the carrier's reorganization.
   The deal, which still must be approved by a U.S. bankruptcy
judge in Chicago, would give the route to Rio Grande Industries
Inc., a railroad company in San Francisco that has been seeking a
foothold in Illinois.
   Under the proposal, Rio Grande would pay $22 million and assume
$7 million of CM&amp;W debt owed to various state agencies. Rio Grande
told the government it would eliminate 187 of the 360 CM&amp;W jobs on
the line.
   ``Whatever happens in bankruptcy court will probably happen soon
because CM&amp;W is in a tough cash position,'' said George W. Mayo
Jr., attorney for Rio Grande.
   The route is used mainly for freight, but Amtrak also uses it to
run three daily round-trip runs between Chicago and St. Louis and
two between Chicago and Springfield.
   In making its decision, the ICC considered objections from
competing railroads, including Chicago and North Western
Transportation Co. and Illinois Central Railroad Co.
   Both handle freight for railroads owned by Rio Grande _ business
they are likely to lose if the deal is approved in bankruptcy court
and Rio Grande gains access to the line. Illinois Central said it
would lose $7.2 million per year.
   The ICC was not swayed.
   ``We conclude that the ... acquisition of CM&amp;W's line ... will
not result in a substantial lessening of competition, creation of a
monopoly or restraint of trade in freight surface transportation in
the region,'' the order said.
   ``The transfer will also assure continued operation by Amtrak
over its third heaviest volume line. ... The state has made a
substantial investment in the line,'' the ICC said. ``Sale to (Rio
Grande) will secure this investment.''
   Under the proposed deal with Rio Grande, CM&amp;W would still retain
its Kansas City, Mo.-East St. Louis route; track between Greene
County and Springfield; a 50 percent interest in the Godfrey-East
St. Louis line, and all locomotives and cars.
   CM&amp;W was created in 1986 to be an independent regional railroad.
In April 1988, the railroad filed for bankruptcy reorganization and
the case is pending before U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John
Schwartz in Chicago.
   Creditors, primarily Citicorp North America Inc. and Heller
Financial Inc., are owed more than $100 million. They want
immediate liquidation of the railroad, while Daniel Murray, the
court-appointed trustee, supports the Rio Grande deal.
   Neal Wolf, an attorney representing Citicorp, and Murray could
not be reached for comment Friday on the ICC decision.
   CM&amp;W is wrangling with its creditors over $13.9 million in loans
and grants given to the railroad by the state of Illinois.
   U.S. District Judge Marvin Aspen prevented CM&amp;W from using the
money, but that ruling has been appealed to a higher court.

   Missouri Cable-TV Operator Is Denied
   Franchise Renewal, Ending Court Battle

   In a development that could have ramifications for cable
television operators nationwide, a Missouri cable operator
was denied a franchise renewal by the city it served, ending
a six-month court battle.
   U.S. District Court Judge Edward L. Filippine in St. Louis
upheld the decision by the city of Rolla, Mo., not to renew
the franchise that Rolla Cable Systems, a subsidiary of Omega
Communications Inc., had held for thirty years. The franchise
is among the oldest in the country, but had been attacked by
the city for failing to provide adequate service.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cable industry analysts and attorneys say this is the
first case where a court upheld a city's decision not to
renew a franchise based on guidelines contained in the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984. The act freed the cable
industry from most local rate regulation, but left local
governments with authority over franchise renewals.
   Cable franchises are valuable commodities that are not
surrendered easily. Of the cable franchises up for renewal,
98% are negotiated informally and without incident, said Wes
Heppler, an attorney specializing on cable television law
with the Washington, D.C., firm of Cole Raywid &amp; Braverman.
"It's highly unusual for a case to get this far," he said.
   Rolla Cable Systems, which has about 4,000 subscribers,
brought the case to U.S. District Court in St. Louis after
the city of Rolla decided to deny the company a franchise
renewal.
   "We had problems with their office staff, their technical
staff and problems with getting a clear signal from St.
Louis," said Merle Strouse, the city administrator of Rolla,
a community with a population of approximately 14,000 located
midway between St. Louis and Springfield.
   Robert Schloss, president of Indianapolis-based Omega
Communications, which operates 12 cable systems with 60,000
subscribers, declined to comment on the judge's decision or
say whether the company would appeal.
   However, Mr. Schloss said the city of Rolla, through Rolla
Municipal Utilities, was anxious to establish its own cable
franchise and that entered into the city's decision to oust
Rolla Cable.
   Mr. Strouse acknowledged that the city's utility company
might become a cable operator, but added, "we're going to
entertain bids from other cable companies, including Rolla
Cable Systems, if it wishes to enter the competition."
   In its filing with the court, attorneys representing the
city of Rolla said that there was "no factual base" to
determine that Rolla Cable Systems "has the continuing
technical ability" to provide adequate services, facilities
and equipment. The city also charged that the cable operator
"continually and consistently mismanaged the system in light
of substantial community criticism and had done so primarily
because of its inability to understand and/or commit to
technical competence."
   John Mansell, a senior analyst with the Carmel, Calif.,
cable firm Paul Kagan Associates Inc., said that such cases
may increase as "cities make noises about owning their own
cable systems."

<TEXT>
   Suits being filed nationwide against Chrysler
Corp. have delayed payments of at least $500 each to owners of
Chrysler cars sold after being test-driven while their odometers
were disconnected.
   Chrysler, the nation's third-largest automaker, agreed last year
to pay about $16 million to more than 32,000 owners but will not
pay the money until the settlement is approved late this summer by
U.S. District Court Judge John Nangle in St. Louis.
   Approval of the settlement has been delayed in part by continued
filing of class-action suits against Chrysler nationwide, said
Marcia Aud, Nangle's deputy clerk. The suits must be consolidated
and heard in St. Louis.
   So far, Aud said, 38 suits have been filed against Chrysler by
owners and state attorneys general, ``and we're still adding new
ones.''
   Chrysler pleaded no contest last year to federal charges of
odometer tampering contained in an indictment handed down in St.
Louis. The investigation was launched in Missouri after state
police noticed in several instances in which traffic citations were
issued to Chrysler employees that the odometer read zero and
speedometer was out of commission.
   Chrysler stopped disconnecting odometers in October 1986 after
learning of the government investigation.
   Chrysler also extended the warranty on the cars to seven years
or 70,000 miles from the standard five years or 50,000 miles. The
warranty is in effect despite delays in the settlement, Chrysler
spokesman Steve Harris said.
   Last July, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said selling cars
tested with disconnected odometers was ``dumb'' and that selling
cars damaged during the testing went ``beyond dumb and reached all
the way to stupid.''
   All automakers disconnected odometers during testing at one
time, but General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. halted the
practice in the 1970s.

FT  08 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: European food
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
This week's purchase by Saint Louis of a 13.8 per cent stake in Source
Perrier is another intriguing development in the Agnelli family's
pan-European food strategy. The ultimate goal may remain obscure, but the
latest deal has two immediate implications. It notably strengthens the
Italian grip on France's much-prized water company, and it underlines the
growing alliance between the Agnellis and Maison Worms.
These two families are openly acting in concert at St Louis, where they have
more than 50 per cent of the votes. By combining the new St Louis stake in
Perrier with the 35 per cent held by Exor, the quoted holding company for
which the Agnellis are currently making a full bid, they will now own 49 per
cent of Perrier. Under French takeover rules that should trigger a partial
bid for the rest, though minority shareholders should not expect any
favours. The Agnellis would not be required to pay more than the FF1,235 per
share forked out this week by St Louis, and with effective control already
in their hands they will hardly want to.
The more interesting question is whether a more substantial shake-up of food
and drink assets in France is on the cards. Notwithstanding stakes in BSN
held directly through the Agnelli vehicle Ifil (5.8 per cent) and indirectly
via St Louis (3 per cent), a full bid for the food giant is difficult to
envisage. It would be hugely expensive, would cause deep political ructions
and would simply not be the Agnelli style. The Agnellis and their French
friends are nevertheless emerging as a powerful new force in the European
food industry, ready to mount a serious challenge to the likes of Nestle and
Unilever in the 1990s.

ADDING A LITTLE SPIRIT;

<P>
BUILDING AIMS FOR NEW IMAGE WITH MURAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The challenge: Transform the ugliest building in San Diego into a work of art. 
The result: A nine-story, three-dimensional mural, complete with swaying palm 
trees and the Spirit of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The building is the year-old Ramada Hotel on K Street, in downtown San Diego. 
Designed and built by Concrete Dynamics, the 22-story hotel has been described 
by an architectural critic as "a building that brutally assaults the street and 
robs the neighborhood of its scale and humanity." 
</P>
<P>
After the building garnered an "Onion" at last year's "Orchids and Onions" 
architecture awards ceremony, hotel owner Clark Higgins decided the building 
needed some dressing up. So he put out the call for an artist to design a 
mural. 
</P>
<P>
Carol Hobson, former director of the county's Public Arts Advisory Council, 
organized an international competition, 
</P>
<P>
whichattracted more than 40 entries from San Diego, Los Angeles and Mexico. A 
panel of five artists and consultants selected San Diegan Mario Uribe's design 
depicting the legendary "Spirit of St. Louis" flying through a window-like 
opening in the wall of the building. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some entries that were different, to say the least," said Dale 
Vogelaar, the hotel's director of sales and marketing. "But Mario's design is 
really dramatic. When we put the lights on the mural, it really looks like the 
Spirit of St. Louis is flying through the side of the building." 
</P>
<P>
The mural is a trompe l'oeil rendering, meaning Uribe used optical illusion 
techniques to attract the viewer's eye. His inspiration for the design came 
from "The Spirit of St. Louis," a movie starring Jimmy Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
The original Spirit of St. Louis was built in San Diego by Ryan Aeronautical 
for Charles Lindbergh's historic 1927 Atlantic crossing. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to bring some of the sky back that the building might have taken 
away," Uribe said. "This mural opens up a window, in a sense, and improves the 
architecture of the building at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
The mural was done by Muralizing, a local company owned by Linda Churchill and 
her husband, Nicholas Weiss. Suspended from the hotel's roof, the couple and 
two assistants took more than 1,000 hours to complete the work, which covers a 
210-by-70-foot portion of the hotel's northern wall. 
</P>
<P>
The project cost Higgins about $40,000, Vogelaar said, including Uribe's 
$30,000 prize and Muralizing's production costs. 
</P>
<P>
The giant mural will be unveiled at 7 p.m. Thursday.

<HL> Chrysler Executives Both Plead Innocent
In Odometer Case; 2 Related Suits Filed

   Two Chrysler Corp. executives charged with conspiracy to commit odometer fraud Friday pleaded innocent in U.S. District Court in St. Louis. 

   Meanwhile, at least two class-action suits -- one in St. Louis and another in Illinois -- have been filed against the No. 3 auto maker in what has become for Chrysler an increasingly embarrassing legal and public relations mire surrounding the odometer case. 

   The suits stem from a Justice Department investigation that last week resulted in a 16-count indictment charging that a Chrysler unit sold as new more than 60,000 cars and trucks, which company employees allegedly had driven with the odometers disconnected. 

   In one of the consumer class-action suits, an owner claims a Chrysler car was delivered with chipped paint and a burn in the upholstery. 
The Justice Department has said some of the cars were damaged more severely, but nonetheless repaired and sold as new. 

   Highland Park, Mich.-based Chrysler has said it didn't do anything wrong and that the vehicles were part of a quality test program. 
Yesterday, Baron Bates, a company spokesman, said Chrysler is still trying to determine whether it can identify all of the owners whose cars were part of the program, which has been in operation for years. 
"Record keeping, like everything else, is imperfect," he said. 

   Lawyers for Frank J. O'Reilly and Allen F. Scudder, former supervisors of Chrysler's assembly operations who each were charged with one misdemeanor count of conspiracy to commit odometer fraud, also say their clients did nothing wrong and have been unfairly singled out by the Justice Department. 

   Mr. O'Reilly currently is a senior executive in Chrysler's Canadian operations. 
Mr. Scudder retired from Chrysler, but was brought back last year on a special assignment to oversee a plant conversion in Kenosha, Wis. 
A tentative trial date was set for Aug. 31. 

   "There are any number of individuals who have been aware of the type of program" at Chrysler, said Mr. O'Reilly's counsel, Barry Short, a former U.S. Attorney now with the law firm of Lewis &amp; Rice in St. Louis. 
"If a mistake was made, it wasn't criminal." 

   Frederick H. Mayer, another St. Louis lawyer representing Mr. Scudder, said he believes the Justice Department focused on his client and Mr. O'Reilly because of a memo concerning problems with the test program that both men had signed. 
"It appears these fellows are being made scapegoats," he said. 
Chrysler is paying for the two executives' legal expenses. 

   The company hasn't yet made a formal pleading concerning the government's charges against its unit, Chrysler Motors Corp. 
The unit has been accused of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, wire fraud and odometer fraud and faces a maximum fine of $120 million. 
In addition to the class-action suits filed in St. Louis and Illinois, Mr. Bates said the company has received reports, but hasn't been able to confirm, that a third suit was filed in California. 

   "These class-action suits have no more merit than the charges by the Justice Department," Mr. Bates said. 
"It's not these few opportunists that concern us; it's all of the Chrysler owners who may be confused by the publicity. 
It's them that we have to reassure." 

   Mr. Bates added that the company has talked to some owners of cars damaged during the quality-test program. 

   Hugh Jones, a 61-year-old retired electrician, and his wife, Shirley, own the car involved in the St. Louis class action. 
In an interview, Mr. Jones said his wife "fell in love" with the gold 1986 Gran Fury while shopping for a new car and that the couple, who live in Hazelwood, Mo., bought it for between $12,000 and $13,000. 

   But later, the Joneses received a letter from the U.S. attorney's office informing them that their car was part of the Justice Department's investigation. 
Mr. Jones claims that, besides chipped paint and a burn in the upholstery, the car had scratches and the floor mats were uprooted when they bought it. 
Since then, he said, he has returned the car repeatedly for a variety of engine and transmission problems. 

   "You go out and pay that much money and find out you bought a used car," he said. 
"Somebody's got to teach these big corporations that they can't do this to the consumer." 
Mr. Jones wouldn't say what damages the suit seeks. 

   Details of the second suit, filed in Illinois weren't immediately known.

   Convicted killer Gerald Smith, who had said
he wanted to die, was executed by lethal injection early today,
becoming the second Missouri prisoner put to death in a
quarter-century.
   Smith, 31, of St. Louis, was pronounced dead at 12:09 a.m., said
Dick Moore, director of the Missouri Department of Corrections.
   Smith was executed for the 1980 beating death of Karen Roberts,
his former girlfriend in St. Louis. In a letter to a newspaper,
Smith said he murdered Ms. Roberts because he believed she gave him
a venereal disease.
   Smith's wife, Lynn, watched the execution along with
court-appointed defense attorney C. John Pleban.
   As the first lethal drug was administerred, Mrs. Smith raised
her left hand and made a ``V'' sign. She mouthed, ``I love you.''
   Smith became the 121st prisoner executed since the U.S. Supreme
Court allowed states to resume carryuing out the death penalty in
1976.
   Death-penalty opponents made a last-ditch effort to save Smith's
life by filing a motion Wednesday afternoon with the U.S. Supreme
Court, but the court voted 7-2 to reject the appeal by the Missouri
Capital Punishment Resource Center in Kansas City.
   Smith came close to execution several times before, but stays
were issued as he changed his mind about whether he wanted to die.
   Last week, Associate Justice Harry Blackmun stayed an execution
for Smith that was scheduled last Thursday to allow the court to
consider motions by Pleban.
   But the full court lifted that stay on Tuesday, and the Missouri
Supreme Court acted swiftly to schedule the execution.
   Smith also was under a death sentence for the 1985 slaying of
fellow death-row inmate Robert Baker.
   Opponents of capital punishment gathered for prayer services at
churches in St. Louis and Jefferson City.
   Gov. John Ashcroft was asked to reprieve Smith on Wednesday by
the Missouri Coalition Against The Death Penalty. The governor's
spokesman, Bob Ferguson, said Ashcroft would not interfere with the
judicial process.

<HEAD>Man Awarded City Hall For Delinquent Court Judgment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST ST. LOUIS, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who was awarded City Hall as
compensation for a multimillion-dollar court judgment needs the
money, not the building, his brother said.
   ``We're not interested in actually owning part of East St.
Louis,'' said Richard DeBow, 59, of Bargaintown, N.J. DeBow's
brother, Walter, was awarded the building and 220 acres of
city-owned property Thursday by a circuit court judge in nearby
Belleville.
   ``If the city paid us $1,025,000 tomorrow, we would probably
give it back, but at this point we're looking for a for-sale
sign,'' said the family's attorney, Clyde Kuehn.
   Stunned city officials said they would appeal.
   Walter DeBow, 55, suffered permanent brain damage after being
beaten into a coma by a fellow prisoner at the city jail more than
six years ago. He has no short-term memory and is being cared for
at a head-injury rehabilitation center in New Jersey.
   DeBow, who was in court Thursday, was in jail for a traffic
charge of illegal transportation of alcohol at the time of the
beating.
   He won a $3.4 million judgment in 1985. With interest it has
risen to $4 million. Financially strapped East St. Louis still owes
at least $1 million, Kuehn said.
   Judge Roger Scrivner's property award was the only way to
guarantee DeBow would get his money, said Kuehn.
   ``I think this decision is just a major miscarriage of justice
and demonstrates bias against the city of East St. Louis,'' said
City Attorney Eric Vickers.
   The 4-year-old City Hall is worth $10 million, Vickers said, and
city officials had been negotiating with a company to sell the
other property for $5 million to a company that wants to build a
trash recycling plant.
   In the meantime, the city has tried to pay off DeBow's award by
selling $5.2 million in bonds, but Kuehn said they are only worth
$2.8 million.
   DeBow will continue to hold the bonds, however, and collect
payments on them, his lawyer said.
   East St. Louis is saddled with debts estimated at $47 million,
and Gov. James R. Thompson signed a $34 million bailout bill Aug.
30. The money is to come from state bond issues.
   The population of the city, which has one of the highest
homicide rates in the country, fell from 55,000 in 1980 to 40,000
this year, according to Census Bureau estimates.
   ``With all the financial problems we've had, this is just icing
on the cake,'' said City Clerk Alzada Christian Carr.
