   The Duke and Duchess of York named their
two-week-old daughter Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, Buckingham Palace
announced today.
   The baby, who is fifth in line to the throne, will be known as
Her Royal Highness The Princess Beatrice of York, the palace said.
   She is the first child of the former Sarah Ferguson and her
husband, Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Britain's newest princess is currently at Balmoral Castle, the
queen's summer home in Scotland, with her parents and grandparents.
   She was born Aug. 8, 1988 at 8:18 p.m., considered one of the
luckiest moments of the century by Chinese astrologers, and flew to
Scotland hours after leaving Portland Hospital in London with her
parents on Aug. 12.
   The name Beatrice _ which means bringer of joy _ has royal
roots. The youngest of Queen Victoria's nine children was named
Princess Beatrice.
   While the duke and duchess were deciding on a name, British
gamblers had a few ideas as well. But their top favorites,
Charlotte, Victoria, Annabel and Elizabeth, all turned out to be
losers.
   The tabloid Sun, Britain's largest-circulation paper, hit the
mark last Friday with a front-page banner headline revealing all
three of the baby's names correctly.
   The paper said Annabel was Andrew and Sarah's first choice but
the name was rejected by the queen as ``too yuppie.'' It said the
queen suggested the name Beatrice during a family gathering at
Balmoral.
   ``It was agreed to be the perfect compromise _ unusual enough to
please Fergie, but royal enough to please the queen,'' The Sun said.
   Princess Beatrice's second name, Elizabeth, is after her
grandmother, the queen, and her great-grandmother, Queen Mother
Elizabeth, who just celebrated her 88th birthday.
   The baby's third name, Mary, is the middle name of the duchess'
mother, Susan Barrantes, wife of Argentinian polo player Hector
Barrantes. It is also the name of Andrew's great-grandmother, Queen
Mary, wife of King George V.
   Taking two weeks to choose a name is not unusual in the royal
family.
   The queen's daughter, Princess Anne and her husband Mark
Phillips took more than three weeks to name their son, Peter, and
almost four weeks to name their daughter, Zara.
   Prince Charles and his wife Diana were comparatively quick to
name their children. Prince William, who is second in line to the
throne behind his father, was named eight days after his birth and
his younger brother, Prince Harry, who is third in line, was named
after 24 hours.
   But Charles himself was referred to as the ``infant son'' for
about a month after he was born on Nov. 14, 1948. His name was
announced the day before his christening on Dec. 14 of that year.

   The Duchess of York, daughter-in-law of Queen
Elizabeth II, is expecting her second child in the spring and said
Tuesday she was ``absolutely ecstatic.''
   The new baby will be the sixth grandchild for the queen.
   The red-haired duchess, who will be 30 on Oct. 15, was speaking
at a literary luncheon hours after the formal announcement by
Buckingham Palace. Her husband, Prince Andrew, Duke of York, a Royal
Navy lieutenant, was on duty at Portland in southwest England.
   ``Andrew is flying a helicopter somewhere today, but he is
naturally delighted ... We are absolutely ecstatic,'' the duchess
told the 300 guests at the lunch in a London hotel. It was held to
honor her as the author of two children's books.
   The news was announced at the lunch by the host, television
personality David Frost.
   ``I just want a happy, healthy baby and a friend for Beatrice. It
will be nice for Beatrice to have someone to play with,'' said the
former Sarah Ferguson, whose first baby was born 13 months ago.
   Prince Andrew, 29, is the second son of the queen and her
husband, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.
   If the baby is a boy he will supersede his sister to become fifth
in line to the throne after Prince Charles, his two sons and Prince
Andrew. If the baby is a girl she will follow her sister Beatrice as
sixth in line.
   In the British order of succession, the sons of the sovereign and
their descendants have preference over the daughters.
   The announcement from Buckingham Palace said: ``The Duke and
Duchess of York are very pleased to announce that the Duchess of
York is expecting a baby in March.''
   The duchess, still known to the London tabloids as ``Fergie,''
said she had not yet thought of any names but was pleased there
would not be a very great age gap between her two children.
   The duchess, who is a licensed helicopter pilot, was a
publisher's assistant before her marriage and her two books are
about a helicopter named Budgie.
   ``I now have not only two books but the prospect of two children
as well,'' she said.

<HEAD>Royal Baby Due Soon, Will Be Fifth In Line To British Throne</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Duchess of York, wife of Prince Andrew, will
soon give birth to her first child following an active pregnancy
which survived two accidents, a family scandal and a flood of
rumors.
   Buckingham Palace insists the birth is due in mid-August, but
Britain already looks set for a fresh bout of royal baby hoopla,
spurred by excited predictions in the tabloid press that the big
day is imminent.
   The Sun newspaper said Friday the duchess' weight and other
health problems may force a Caesarian delivery this weekend.
   On July 22, the Star claimed the birth was likely to be
artificially induced within 48 hours because the duchess feared
losing the baby.
   Every other day, Andrew is prematurely reported to have left his
Royal Navy ship in Singapore to be at her side during the delivery.
   But Buckingham Palace is sticking to its forecast and refusing
to comment on the press reports.
   The baby, to carry the title Prince or Princess of York, will be
Queen Elizabeth II's fifth grandchild and fifth in line to succeed
her.
   ``Complications which could endanger mother and baby have led
her doctors to give up the wait for a natural delivery,'' the Sun
reported Friday.
   The newspaper said without attribution that the duchess' doctor
had decided on a Caesarian section because she is suffering from
high blood pressure and severe water retention, and because the
baby is in a breech position, meaning it would be born bottom first
rather than head first, as is normal.
   The Star added that the ``roly-poly'' duchess has gained almost
50 pounds during the pregnancy.
   The 28-year-old duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, married
Andrew, the queen's second oldest son, in July 1986. When she
didn't become pregnant in the first year, the British media
speculated that ``Fergie'' was being treated for infertility,
although her family repeatedly denied it.
   The duchess radiated good health during the early months of her
pregnancy. She skiied in Europe, performed a full calendar of royal
engagements and worked at her publishing job until February. When
the palace confirmed her pregnancy on Jan. 25, the duchess was
taking a helicopter flying lesson.
   Then came two scares and a family scandal.
   The duchess fell into an icy stream while skiing in the French
Alps in March, when she was four months pregnant. Earlier this
month she escaped injury when her car, driven by a police
bodyguard, collided with another car on a busy highway outside
London.
   Meanwhile, the tabloids discovered that her father, Maj. Ronald
Ferguson, was frequenting a London massage parlor. The scandal
almost got him expelled from his polo club.
   The duchess has broken with royal tradition in her choice of
doctor and hospital.
   Instead of Dr. George Pinker, royal gynecologist since 1973 and
deliverer of nine princes and princesses, she has chosen Dr.
Anthony Kenney, a prominent London obstetrician known to favor
natural childbirth.
   She has picked the private, American-owned Portland Hospital in
west London, unlike her sisters-in-law, Princess Diana and Princess
Anne, who had their babies in the private wing of a state-run
hospital.
   The modern Portland Hospital is said to be Britain's most
expensive maternity clinic.
   The Sun says Room 201 has been reserved for the duchess and
decorated with pink wallpaper and mauve floral curtains.
   Andrew was quoted as saying in May that the baby will be a girl
and will be named Annabelle. He refused a gift of a child's cricket
bat from a Yorkshire cricket team, saying: ``It won't be much use
... I'm sure we are having a girl.''
   However, the prince has a reputation as a prankster, and
Buckingham Palace said of his comments, ``It's all speculation.''
   Bookmakers William Hill say Annabelle remains the favorite name
for a girl and David for a boy.

   Sarah Ferguson was lauded as a breath of fresh air
in the stuffy world of royal protocol when she married Prince Andrew
2{ years ago, but today the Duchess of York is known in some
quarters as ``Her Royal Idleness.''
   Britain's brassy tabloids also are calling her ``Duchess
Dolittle'' for what they view as her love of holidays and
jet-setting lifestyle.
   A recent scorecard listing the public engagements of Britain's
royal family put Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant, at the bottom with
only 30 last year.
   Sarah was next with 55, less than half those performed by her
husband's 88-year-old grandmother, Queen Mother Elizabeth.
   Buckingham Palace noted that Andrew, as a naval officer, was not
expected to have other commitments and that Sarah gave birth to
their first child in August.
   But a public opinion poll published Sunday in News of the World
indicated 34 percent of Britons surveyed believe the 29-year-old
duchess does not earn the $150,000 she and her husband receive
yearly from the government for royal duties.
   ``Her Royal Idleness,'' the newspaper's headline blared.
``Freeloading Fergie is the most unpopular member of the royal
family,'' its story said.
   The newspaper said Market and Opinion Research International Ltd.
polled 501 adults last week. No margin of error was given.
   News about Queen Elizabeth II and her family sells newspapers in
Britain, and the duchess has suffered her share of barbs since she
first was linked to Andrew more than three years ago.
   At first, the duchess was lauded for her breezy style and
friendly, open manner. But she slowly became a target, mainly for
her healthy appetite, sometimes plump figure and fashion gaffes.
   After an official visit to California last March, even the
serious newspapers said Sarah and Andrew's behavior had been brash
and vulgar, particularly her bold repartee with audiences.
   As the duchess gained weight last summer during the later months
of her pregnancy, the tabloids delighted in publishing unflattering
photographs of her.
   Criticism intensified last fall when she left her newborn baby,
Princess Beatrice, at home with a nanny for six weeks while she went
to Australia on official business and holidays.
   The attacks reached a crescendo last week when Sarah and Andrew
went skiing at Klosters, Switzerland, where Maj. Hugh Lindsay, a
close friend of the royal family, died last year in an avalanche
that narrowly missed Prince Charles, heir to the throne.
   Critics considered the trip an excessive holiday and unseemly
because it came only a year after the tragedy.
   The Daily Mirror, which branded Sarah ``Duchess Dolittle,'' said
she sobbed after daily briefings by aides on the tabloid attacks.
   The duchess flew to London on Friday to attended a memorial
service for the 34 people killed in a triple-train crash in south
London in December. It was one of only six public engagements she
has scheduled until March, according to Buckingham Palace's official
list.
   The Sunday Times of London, which usually does not focus on the
private lives of the royal family, said the duchess was suffering
from a general cooling in relations between the palace and the media.
   The chill is largely due to the royal family's failure to attend
a memorial service in Lockerbie, Scotland, for victims of the Dec.
21 crash of Pan Am Flight 103, and the decision to send Prince
Philip to the funeral of Japan's Emperor Hirohito. Many British
veterans still consider Hirohito a war criminal.
   ``Whether the activities of the duchess are an embarrassment and
a disgrace or whether she is merely fulfilling a popular need for a
bete noir in the nation's most popular soap opera is debatable,''
The Sunday Times said.

<TEXT>
   Drawing on royal precedent, the Duke and Duchess
of York have named their 2-week-old daughter Beatrice Elizabeth
Mary, Buckingham Palace said Monday.
   The princess' names are from Queen Victoria's youngest child,
the present queen and her mother, and the duke's great-grandmother,
Queen Mary.
   The baby, who is at the royal summer retreat in Scotland with
her parents, Prince Andrew and Sarah, and the queen, will be known
as Her Royal Highness The Princess Beatrice of York.
   She is fifth in line to the throne and the first child for the
Duke and Duchess of York.
   The announcement of her name ended energetic speculation, which
long preceded her Aug. 8 birth. One major bookmaker closed his
books for a time when a newspaper quoted Andrew as saying one day
in May that the baby would be a girl named Annabel.
   But Annabel continued to remain a favorite among bettors, along
with Charlotte and Victoria. Not a single bet was placed on
Beatrice at two of the country's largest bookmakers, they said with
delight.
   ``It's terrific. We couldn't have chosen a better name,'' said
Graham Sharp of William Hill bookmakers, which offered Beatrice at
100 to 1 odds. ``We cleaned up every which way.''
   ``It is a bit of a surprise for everybody,'' said Malcolm Palmer
of Coral Bookmakers. ``Victoria and Elizabeth were the two
favorites.''
   The only correct entry in the public guessing game came from
Britain's largest-circulation newspaper, the tabloid Sun, which
reported all three names Friday.
   The newspaper said Annabel had been the first choice of Andrew
and Sarah, but the queen, who must approve royal names, rejected it
as too ``yuppie,'' and suggested Beatrice.
   The last Princess Beatrice among British royals was the youngest
of Queen Victoria's nine children.
   The Sun reported the name was royal enough for the queen but
unusual enough to please Sarah.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publisher of Burke's Peerage, said Sarah
was pleased because she likes old-fashioned names.
   The baby's second name honors her grandmother, the queen, and
her great-grandmother, Queen Mother Elizabeth. Her third name,
Mary, is the name of the duke's great-grandmother Queen Mary, wife
of King George V, as well as the middle name of Sarah's mother,
Susan Barrantes.
   Buckingham Palace said no date had been announced for the
christening.
   Prince Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant, is due to return soon to
his ship, HMS Edinburgh, in the Far East following a leave of
absence.

   Prince Andrew arrived at a London hospital today
with a bouquet of red roses to visit his wife, Sarah, and their
newborn daughter as delighted Britons celebrated the princess'
birth on an especially lucky day.
   Champagne corks popped, bells rang and cameras flashed outside
Portland Hospital in central London with the announcement Monday
night of the birth of a 6-pound, 12-ounce girl to Andrew, the Duke
of York, and his red-haired duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson.
   Two army units fired simultaneous 41-gun salutes in Hyde Park
and at Tower Green near the Tower of London this afternoon
celebrating the royal birth.
   The Princess of York, who has not yet been named, is their first
child and the fifth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Jane Makim, the duchess' elder sister who lives in Australia,
told British reporters that her mother, Susan Barrantes, who was at
the hospital for the birth, had telephoned to say the baby was very
alert, had elegant hands and ``a petite little face ... just fit
for a princess.
   ``My mother said the baby is beautiful. Just a nice weight and
everything. Not much hair but very pretty,'' Mrs. Makim said.
   Andrew, sporting a yellow rose in the lapel of his dark blue
suit, smiled and waved to a large crowd of journalists and several
dozen well-wishers before going inside the American-owned Portland
Hospital.
   Only 24 hours earlier, he had looked somber and anxious as he
drove his 28-year-old wife to the hospital from the country home
west of London which they are renting from King Hussein of Jordan.
   Dr. Anthony Kenney, the duchess' obstetrician, was also at the
hospital today. He led a team of four doctors in the delivery room.
   Hundreds of people on their way to work this morning stopped off
at Buckingham Palace to see the brief notice posted on the gates
announcing the baby's birth.
   Polish student Arek Ilnicki went straight there after arriving
in London. ``I think the English are a bit mad about the baby. But
it's good.''
   Andrew, the 28-year-old second son of the monarch and a Royal
Navy lieutenant, flew to London on Sunday from Singapore where he
is on sea duty on HMS Edinburgh. News of the birth was announced to
the ship's crew and the prince's fellow officers immediately
toasted to the health of the baby and parents.
   The Buckingham Palace statement announcing the birth said the
Duchess of York was ``safely delivered of a daughter at 8:18 p.m..''
   The statement said the delivery was ``a normal birth'' and
`there were no complications.'' Neither the palace nor the doctors
would say whether the birth had been induced, as newspapers had
speculated.
   Andrew was present at his daughter's birth, the palace said.
British press reports said the prince, an accomplished amateur
photographer, took the first photos of his daughter.
   There was much speculation over the baby's name, with Elizabeth
and Victoria as favorites. Early in his wife's pregnancy Andrew had
been quoted as saying the baby would be called Annabel.
   Whatever the choice, the baby will be Her Royal Highness,
Princess (name) of York. She is fifth in line to the throne behind
Andrew's older brother, Prince Charles, Charles' two children
Prince William and Prince Harry, and Andrew himself. The queen's
two other grandchildren, Peter and Zara Phillips, are the children
of her only daughter, Anne.
   The baby's birth at 18 minutes past 8 on the eighth day of the
eighth month of the century's 88th year is being taken by
well-wishers as a sign of great good fortune. The day is considered
highly auspicious by Cantonese-speaking Chinese, whose word for
eight is similar to that for prosperity.
   The Times of London headline said: ``At 8:18 on 8.8.88 _ A Safe
and Lucky Royal Birth.'' The tabloid Sun said: ``Fergie's first
baby has been blessed with the century's luckiest birthday.''
   A message of congratulation from Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and her husband, Denis, who are visiting Bangkok, read:
``It is wonderful news and your happiness will be shared by the
whole nation.''
   It was not known how soon the queen and her husband, Prince
Philip, would see the baby. The queen has public engagements in
Scotland today and is cruising off the Scottish coast in the royal
yacht Britannia.
   The Queen Mother Elizabeth is on vacation in Scotland.
   Charles and his wife, Princess Diana, and their sons go to the
Spanish island of Majorca this week for a vacation with the Spanish
royal family.

<P>
Britain's Royal Family has resorted to disguises and aliases to evade the 
prying lenses of the press, but two of its most controversial members have just 
walked into a photographic storm with their eyes open. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, and his wife, Sarah, invited a 
photographer into their home to take a set of informal pictures, complete with 
birthday party scenes and beachwear shots. 
</P>
<P>
The photo exclusive of the couple, the Duke and Duchess of York, and their two 
young daughters filled 48 pages of a recent edition of Hello magazine. 
</P>
<P>
But the royal snapshots, accompanied by an article titled "Delightful Moments 
at Home with the Yorks," provoked criticism from friends and foes of the 
monarchy, who accused the couple of making a tasteless show of their private 
life. 
</P>
<P>
It also stoked a long-running debate over whether the more fashionable royals 
damage or strengthen the monarchy by their mass appeal. 
</P>
<P>
The episode is the latest in a series of controversies surrounding the younger 
members of the Royal Family who, in breaking with protocol to make the monarchy 
more accessible, have sometimes been accused of lacking the dignity demanded by 
their high station in life. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Edward, Queen Elizabeth's youngest son, was panned three years ago when 
he persuaded a group of royals to dress up in period costumes and lead teams in 
a televised charity contest. 
</P>
<P>
Flame-haired Sarah, nicknamed "Fergie" after her maiden name of Ferguson, was 
one of those taking part. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, she has faced more criticism over her spending habits, her 
ranch-style house -- dubbed "Palace Dallas" by British newspapers -- and for 
wearing short skirts that reveal too much royal leg when she gets in and out of 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
More recently, traditionalists were horrified when Princess Diana, wife of 
Prince Charles, heir to the throne, was caught giving her chauffeur a goodby 
kiss on the cheek after a holiday in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult for the royals to keep their dignity with the tabloid press 
around. A newspaper once ran a story titled: "20 Things You Did Not Know About 
Prince Charlie's Bald Spot." 
</P>
<P>
Other controversial photographs have surfaced, including one of a pregnant 
Princess Diana in a skimpy bikini. 
</P>
<P>
"All these things added together are leading to a crisis in the monarchy," said 
Harold Brooks-Baker, champion of royal tradition and editor of Britain's 
nobility directory, Burke's Peerage. "If this carries on, it will come 
unstuck." 
</P>
<P>
He was highly critical of the Yorks. 
</P>
<P>
"Even for an ordinary person, these photographs would be unacceptable," he 
said. "Who would want to show pictures of their wife in a sun-dress to anyone 
but very close friends?" 
</P>
<P>
The photographs are no different from average family snapshots. But some 
Britons take offense at the idea of one of the queen's sons and his wife being 
photographed frolicking in a pool and feeding the baby. 
</P>
<P>
The duchess was snapped changing her baby daughter Eugenie's diapers and 
rubbing suntan lotion on 2-year-old Beatrice, who romped naked by the pool. 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, the public was not allowed to see inside the royal households. 
When Queen Elizabeth first admitted the television cameras, her family was clad 
in traditional tweeds and tartans. 
</P>
<P>
Hello editor Maggie Goodman said typical English prudery and snobbery were 
behind the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
The public was snapping up copies of the magazine, she said, and newspapers 
that criticized the photographs were just jealous of Hello's exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
One newspaper said the prince and his wife, the daughter of a polo coach, came 
across like tourists on a cheap holiday. Even the right-leaning Daily Telegraph 
admonished the couple. 
</P>
<P>
"My advice is that the Royal Family should equip themselves with an intelligent 
public relations operator without further delay before irreparable harm is done 
to the monarchy," wrote the Telegraph's Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd. 
</P>
<P>
The Royal Family could hardly complain about snooping reporters if they made 
their private lives public, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Andrew is no fan of the press. In his bachelor days, he was caught 
vacationing with an actress friend despite traveling under an assumed name. He 
once threw paint over the paparazzi and had to make a public apology. 
</P>
<P>
It was not clear why the couple agreed to the photo session. Goodman said they 
just wanted to share their wedded bliss with the world. 
</P>
<P>
Skeptics have spoken of a big fee, a claim firmly denied by Hello magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Buckingham Palace, in keeping with royal tradition, offered its customary "no 
comment."

<HEAD>Britain Celebrates New Princess With Flowers, Bets, 41-Gun Salutes</HEAD>

   Britain on Tuesday celebrated the birth of a
princess with two 41-gun salutes, a new cocktail and heavy betting
on her name.
   Prince Andrew, saying it was ``wonderful'' to be a father,
showered the women in his life with roses and carnations _
reportedly choosing red for his red-haired wife, Sarah, and pink
for his day-old daughter, the couple's first child and the fifth
grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II.
   The daughter of the Duchess of York is a beautiful baby with
elegant hands and ``a petite little face ... just fit for a
princess,'' said the duchess' sister, Jane Makim, who lives in
Australia and received a phone call from her mother, Susan
Barrantes, after the birth.
   Andrew, fielding questions from reporters outside Portland
Hospital on Tuesday, said she probably looked like ``both of us.''
Asked whether she was pretty, he replied: ``Yes, but I am biased.''
   Dr. Anthony Kenney, the obstetrician who supervised the Monday
night delivery, said: ``I'm delighted it all went so well. All I
can say is that it was a normal birth. Both of them are doing very
well.''
   Andrew said: ``It was a long time, but she came through it very,
very well.''
   Told that he looked worried while waiting for the birth, which
he attended, the prince retorted: ``That's because I was on my way
to the dentist.''
   Buckingham Palace said the 28-year-old duchess is expected to
remain in the hospital for a few days.
   Andrew insisted that no name has been chosen for the new
princess, who is fifth in line to the throne behind the queen's
eldest son, Prince Charles, his children, Prince William and Prince
Harry, and Andrew himself.
   ``We have a few ideas but we haven't chosen a name yet,'' said
Andrew, also 28.
   British gamblers had a few ideas as well.
   ``We've been extremely busy today,'' said Wally Pyrah of Coral
Bookmakers. ``There's been plenty of interest in the baby's name.
The one name that everyone seems to want to bet in the last few
hours is Charlotte, which has seen the odds tumble from 14-1 to 6-4
favorite. I hope that doesn't mean that everyone knows before us.
   ``The second favorite is Victoria at 5-2 followed by two very
popular names, Annabel and Elizabeth, at 4-1,'' he said. Andrew had
mentioned a preference for Annabel in May.
   Cards and bouquets poured into the hospital and hundreds of
people stopped at Buckingham Palace to read the official
announcement on the gate.
   Two army units fired simultaneous 41-gun salutes in Hyde Park
and at Tower Green near the Tower of London to celebrate the
princess' arrival.
   In the town of Dummer, Hampshire, where the former Sarah
Ferguson grew up, villagers at The Queen Inn pub toasted mother and
baby with a special cocktail called the ``New York'' _ made from
Babycham, Grenadine and navy rum.
   A nursery has been prepared at the couple's temporary home at
Castlewood House, a 12-bedroom mansion near Egham, southwest of
London, that King Hussein of Jordan loaned them while their own
home is being built at nearby Sunninghill Park.
   The duchess' full-time nurse, Alison Wardley, 21, will be the
youngest nanny in the royal family.
   ``I am just waiting to hear now when I will start,'' she told
reporters at her home in the city of Manchester. ``I was very
excited and very thrilled when I heard the news. It has been a long
wait.''
   The Princess of York was born on the eighth day of the eighth
month of 1988 at 8:18 p.m. She weighed in at six pounds, 12 ounces.
   The day is considered the luckiest of the century by the
Chinese, whose word for eight is similar to that for prosperity.
The London press decided it was an auspicious day as well for the
first princess in the royal family since the queen's only daughter,
Princess Anne, was born in 1950.
   The Times' front-page headline said: ``At 8:18 on 8.8.88 _ A
Safe and Lucky Royal Birth.'' The tabloid Sun, said: ``Fergie's
first baby has been blessed with the century's luckiest birthday.''
   The Sun said she would be the first royal bride of the 21st
century and listed six contenders ``for the tiny tot's hand,''
including Harry Soames, the 3-year-old great-grandson of Sir
Winston Churchill, and James Jagger, the 3-year-old son of rock
star Mick Jagger.

   Criticized by the press for taking too many
holidays, the Duchess of York will spend five days next week at a
French ski resort on official duties, Buckingham Palace said today.
   The palace said the duchess, who is married to Prince Andrew,
will visit Megeve in the French Alps for the Combined Services
Winter Sports Association championships.
   ``This is not a holiday, but an official working engagement,'' a
palace spokesman said.
   He said Sarah, better known as ``Fergie,'' would not ski
privately but may take part in a dual slalom run on the final day of
competition.
   During their ski trip in the Swiss resort of Klosters in
mid-January, Andrew and Sarah were criticized by British tabloids
for being ``no-work royals'' and taking too many vacations.
   Buckingham Palace defended the royal couple, saying Sarah had a
baby last year and Andrew does not take on too many duties other
than his navy service with the HMS Edinburgh.
   The palace also said that in July the couple will make a 12-day
visit to Canada, where they will visit Prince Edward Island, Quebec,
Saskatchewan and Ottawa.

   The Duchess of York gave birth to a 7-pound,
1{-ounce daughter by Caesarean section Friday night, and mother and
child are both well, Portland Hospital announced.
   It was the second child and second girl for the 30-year-old
duchess and her husband Prince Andrew, and is the sixth grandchild
of Queen Elizabeth II.
   The new baby, daughter of the queen's second son, is sixth in
line to the British throne after her sister, Princess Beatrice of
York, who was born Aug. 8, 1988.
   Andrew was present at the delivery at 7:58 p.m. (2:58 p.m. EST),
the hospital statement said.
   The Caesarean section was carried out because the baby was in a
breech position, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said. ``It was the
wrong way round,'' he said.
   The duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, had spent the last week
at Buckingham Palace in London instead of her country home. She
arrived at the London hospital nearly four hours earlier in a
chauffeur-driven car and entered through a side entrance, avoiding
photographers waiting at the front.
   Her husband joined her two hours later after driving the 150
miles from Devonport naval dockyard, where he is based as a flight
commander on the Royal Navy frigate Campbeltown.
   As tradition dictates, a notice was posted on the railings at
Buckingham Palace giving news of the birth.
   It read: ``Her Royal Highness the Duchess of York was safely
delivered of a daughter at 7:58 p.m. today. Her Royal Highness and
her child are well.''
   The birth was greeted by cheering and the cracking of champagne
corks by a small crowd of well-wishers outside the hospital.
   The Duchess of York's father, Maj. Ronald Ferguson, said at his
home at Dummer, a village 53 miles southwest of London: ``I am
delighted for the mother and daughter.''
   For Beatrice's birth, the duchess was admitted shortly after 10
a.m. and gave birth at 8:18 p.m.
   No name was announced immediately for the new baby, but she will
be known as Her Royal Highness, Princess (baby's name) of York.
   Andrew's elder brother Prince Charles, 41, is first in line to
the throne, followed by his sons Prince William and Prince Harry of
Wales. Then comes Andrew, 30, then Beatrice.
   The queen's unmarried youngest son, Edward, 26, is now seventh
in line of succession. Her 39-year-old daughter Anne, the Princess
Royal, is eighth and has a son and daughter, Peter and Zara, who
are ninth and tenth.
   The duke's ship has returned to Britain after exercises and is
to remain in home waters until July. The queen went to Windsor
Castle, 21 miles west of London, for the weekend and has been
notified of the birth.

   The Duchess of York gave birth Monday to a
daughter, the first child for her and husband Prince Andrew and
fifth in line to the British throne, Buckingham Palace announced.
   The child, who weighed six pounds, 12 ounces, and the mother,
the former Sarah Ferguson, are doing well, the palace said.
   Andrew, Duke of York and second son of Queen Elizabeth II, was
with his wife when she was ``safely delivered of a daughter at 8:18
p.m. (3:18 p.m. EDT) today,'' the palace said.
   In May, Andrew was quoted as saying the child would be named
Annabel.
   ``All members of the royal family are very pleased with the
news,'' a palace spokesman said later. He was not identified, in
keeping with British custom.
   An official notice including the statement was posted on the
gates of Buckingham Palace, also in keeping with royal family
custom, to the cheers of a waiting crowd.
   Dr. Barry Lewis, the family pediatrician, said as he left the
hospital: ``The atmosphere inside was very cheerful. Everyone is
delighted.''
   Town crier Peter Moore, dressed in a red tunic and swinging a
brass hand bell, opened bottles of champagne and announced the
birth to crowds of reporters and members of the public waiting
outside the hospital.
   Andrew left the hospital hours after his daughter's birth,
smiling broadly and waving to the well-wishers as got into a car
and drove away slowly.
   Maj. Ronald Ferguson, father of the duchess, said at his country
home that he was ``absolutely thrilled'' and added: ``If they've
chosen a name, I'm not aware of it.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her husband, Denis,
visiting Bangkok, Thailand, sent congratulations: ``It is wonderful
news and your happiness will be shared by the whole nation.''
   The baby's birth at 18 minutes past 8 p.m. on the eighth day of
the eighth month of 1988 is being taken by well-wishers as a sign
of good fortune. The day is considered highly auspicious by
Cantonese-speaking Chinese, whose word for eight is similar to that
for prosperity.
   Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant who returned on Sunday from sea
duty in Singapore to be with his 28-year-old wife, had driven her
to the rear entrance of Portland Hospital from their rented home 21
miles west of London Monday morning.
   The prince, also 28, looked nervous and anxious as left the
hospital after 1{ hours, only to return later _ still looking
worried. The duchess' mother, Susan Barrantes, also joined her at
the hospital, smiling and looking relaxed.
   ``Any Moment Now!'' proclaimed a banner hanging outside the
hospital, where crowds gathered to await the birth of the queen's
fifth grandchild.
   Dozens of photographers who have spent weeks camped outside the
hospital's main entrance missed the arrival of the red-haired
duchess, and the few at the back entrance just caught a glimpse of
her as the car raced by.
   The queen, who was opening a new soap plant at Port Sunlight on
the Wirral in northwest England, joked that the baby was taking a
long time to arrive.
   ``We hope it is soon. We are fed up with waiting,'' she told
young mother Heidi Courtney during a tour of the plant.
   Mrs. Courtney's 22-month-old, curly haired daughter, Carla,
handed a teddy bear to the queen, who said: ``If it is a little
girl, I hope my grandchild has curly hair like this.''
   The baby will be Her Royal Highness, Princess of York. She is
fifth in line to the throne behind Andrew's older brother, Prince
Charles, his two children, Prince William and Prince Harry, and
Andrew himself. The queen's two other grandchildren, Peter and Zara
Phillips, are the children of her only daughter, Anne.
   Millions of TV viewers around the world watched the July 23,
1986, Westminster Abbey wedding of the handsome prince and the
vivacious young working woman he had known since childhood.
   The duchess chose Dr. Anthony Kenney as her obstetrician rather
than the queen's gynecologist, Dr. George Pinker, who has delivered
all royal babies for the past 10 years.
   The duchess also broke tradition by choosing the modern 86-bed
Portland Hospital, which costs $588 a day and is privately owned by
American Medical International. Sarah's sisters-in-law, Anne and
the Princess of Wales, used the private wing of St. Mary's Hospital
in Paddington, a hospital of the government-funded National Health
Service.
   The day after the duchess' pregnancy was announced Jan. 25, she
celebrated by flying a helicopter from a Royal Air Force base in
Oxfordshire.
   The rest of her pregnancy was action-packed, including three
skiing trips. She suffered a fall while on the slopes at Klosters
when she was four months pregnant. On July 8, she escaped injury
when her car collided with an oncoming car on a highway 20 miles
outside London.

   The Duchess of York gave birth to a 7-pound,
1{-ounce daughter by Caesarian section and the child, the second
for Sarah Ferguson and her husband Prince Andrew, is sixth in the
line of succession.
   Well-wishers cheered and popped champagne corks outside London's

30-year-old mother and her child were well, the hospital said.
   No name has yet been announced for the baby, but she will be

   The Duchess of York's father, ex-army major Ronald Ferguson,
said at his home at the village of Dummer 50 miles southwest of

   The baby is the second girl for the royal couple and is the

   The Duke and Duchess of York have named their
week-old daughter Princess Eugenie Victoria Helena, Buckingham
Palace said today.
   The baby's name was announced shortly after the royal couple
stepped from Portland Hospital with the new princess, wrapped in a
white blanket.
   The baby slept quietly through the cheers of the crowd and the
click of hundreds of cameras.
   Princess Eugenie is the sixth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II
and sixth in the line of succession. She is the second daughter
born to the duchess and her husband, Prince Andrew.
   The 30-year-old Duchess of York, the former Sarah Ferguson, gave
birth to Princess Eugenie by Caesarian section on March 23.
   The baby's name surprised Britain. Bookmakers William Hill said
they had thousands of bets but not one for Eugenie.
   It was the name of Queen Victoria's granddaughter, the daughter
of Princess Beatrice who was Victoria's fifth daughter and youngest
child. The baby's second name _ Victoria _ comes from Queen
Victoria herself, and the third name, Helena, comes from the third
daughter of Queen Victoria.
   Eugenie is the French derivative of the ancient Greek word
``Eugenia'' meaning ``nobility'' and ``excellence,'' and was made
fashionable in 19th- century France by the Empress Eugenie, wife of
Emperor Napoleon III, said David Williamson, co-editor of Debrett's
Peerage, a leading reference book on the aristocracy.
   In its classical form of Eugenia, it was first recorded as a
name in England in the 12th century, he said.
   Prince Andrew's elder brother Prince Charles, 41, is first in
line to the throne, followed by Charles' sons, Prince William and
Prince Harry. Then comes Andrew, 30, then Beatrice.
   The queen's unmarried youngest son, Edward, 26, is now seventh
in line of succession. Her 39-year-old daughter Anne, the Princess
Royal, is eighth and has a son and daughter, Peter and Zara, who
are ninth and 10th.

<TEXT>
   Princess Beatrice, the 3-month-old daughter of the
Duke and Duchess of York, will be christened by the Archbishop of
York on Dec. 20, Buckingham Palace said Monday.
   The christening will take place in the historic Chapel Royal in
London's St. James's Palace, where Queen Victoria and Prince Albert
were married in 1840 and where royal christenings occasionally have
taken place.
   Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, fifth in line to the throne and
the fifth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, will wear the royal
family's christening robe of Honiton lace and will be baptized at
the silver gilt Lily Font, the palace said.
   The font was made for the christening in 1840 of Princess
Victoria, the eldest child of Queen Victoria, and it has been used
to baptize Queen Elizabeth's four children and grandchildren. The
christening robe has been worn by all royal babies since the baptism
of Victoria's eldest son, Prince Albert Edward, in 1842.
   The christening will take place shortly after the princess'
father, Prince Andrew, returns to Britain. A Royal Navy lieutenant,
he is serving on board the destroyer Edinburgh which has been in the
Far East.
   Princess Beatrice, born Aug. 8, is the first child of the prince,
the queen's second son, and the former Sarah Ferguson.
   Buckingham Palace said the royal couple chose Dr. John Habgood,
the archbishop of York and second-ranking prelate in the Church of
England, rather than the Archbishop of Canterbury, the church's
spiritual leader, to christen their daughter because of ``personal
and appropriate'' reasons.
   The queen, as Princess Elizabeth of York, was also christened by
the then- archbishop of York but in the chapel at Buckingham Palace.

<HEAD>Princess Beatrice Gives Short Cry At Baptism</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Princess Beatrice was bapitized Tuesday by the
archbishop of York with water from the Jordan River, and she let out
just one quick cry as her parents, the Duke and Duchess of York,
watched in delight.
   The 19-week-old princess, the newest member of Britain's royal
family, got a calming pat on the back from her mother after the
archbishop poured the water on her forehead in a ceremony that made
her a member of the Church of England.
   Queen Elizabeth II, the baby's grandmother who is temporal head
of the Anglican church, smiled broadly as she led the baby and about
100 relatives and friends out of the Chapel Royal at St. James'
Palace after the christening to pose briefly for photographers.
   The blue-eyed princess, who has her mother's red hair, looked
directly into the cameras. She didn't let out a peep as she rested
in the arms of the duchess, who wore an emerald green suit and
matching hat with a wide upturned brim and black band.
   Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, fifth in line to the throne and
the queen's fifth grandchild, was born on Aug. 8, 1988, at 8:18
p.m., considered to be lucky by Chinese astrologers.
   Poet Laureate Ted Hughes wrote what he called a nursey-rhyme hymn
woven around the six eights in her birth. It notes that the
``blessed and fortunate'' child comes into a world of ``poisoned
glut'' and ``poisoned seas.''
   The princess' baptism was delayed until after her father, Prince
Andrew, a Royal Navy lieutenant, returned last week from a tour of
duty in the Far East.
   Buckingham Palace said the duke and duchess chose the Most Rev.
John Habgood, Archbishop of York and second-ranking prelate in the
church rather than Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, the
church's spiritual leader, to christen their daughter because of
``personal and appropriate'' reasons _ a reference to their York
title.
   The Chapel Royal, the main surviving part of the Tudor Palace
built by Henry VIII, was also chosen by the couple, the palace said.
Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were married in the chapel in 1840
and royal christenings occasionally have taken place there.
   The 30-minute private ceremony included three hymns chosen by the
parents, ``Jesus, Good Above All Other,'' ``All Things Bright and
Beautiful,'' and a Christmas touch, ``Away In A Manger.''
   The choir also sang ``Princess Beatrice's Anthem,'' composed by
Richard Popplewell, organist and choir master of the queen's Chapels
Royal, with words by the late Lord Gorell, a literary magazine
editor.
   Beatrice was dressed in the royal family's christening robe of
flowing cream Honiton lace, first worn by Queen Victoria's eldest
son in 1842.
   She was baptized at the silver gilt Lily Font, made for the
christening in 1840 of Princess Victoria, Queen Victoria's eldest
child, and used to baptize Queen Elizabeth's four children.
   Like all godparents at Anglican baptisms, Beatrice's five were
reminded of their duty to raise the princess to fight against evil
and to follow Christ.
   Her godparents are Viscount Linley, son of the queen's sister
Princess Margaret; property developer Peter Palumbo, who is chairman
of the Arts Council; Mrs. Harry Cotterell, who formerly shared an
apartment with the duchess; the Duchess of Roxburghe, at whose
Scottish home the duke proposed to the then-Sarah Ferguson; and Mrs.
John Greenall, a friend of the duchess.
   Among the guests at the christening were the queen's eldest son
and heir to the throne, Prince Charles, his wife, Princess Diana and
their two children, Prince William, 6, and Prince Harry, 4. Queen
Mother Elizabeth, the baby's 88-year-old great-grandmother, was also
there.
   After the ceremony, the guests went to Buckingham Palace for a
tea party in the white and gold decorated Bow Room overlooking the
palace gardens. The duke, an accomplished amateur photographer, took
the official family photographs of the christening party.

   The Duchess of York, 28-year-old wife of Prince
Andrew, gave birth today to a 6 lb. 12 oz. daughter, the couple's
first child who is fifth in line to the British throne, Buckingham
Palace said.
   Mother and child are both doing well, the palace said.
   Andrew, the Duke of York and second son of Queen Elizabeth II,
was with his wife when she was ``safely delivered of a daughter at
8:18 p.m. (3:18 p.m EDT) today,'' the palace said.
   ``Her Royal Highness and the child are both well,'' the palace
statement concluded.
   The 28-year-old prince, a Royal Navy lieutenant, returned to
London on Sunday from Singapore, where he has been on duty with the
ship HMS Edinburgh, to be on hand for the birth.
   Andrew drove his wife to the rear entrance of Portland Hospital
from their rented home 21 miles west of London this morning.
   The prince left the hospital briefly but spent the rest of the
day and evening with her. The duchess' mother, Susan Barrantes, who
had flown from her home in Argentina for the birth, also was at the
hospital.
   The queen, who was opening a new Lever Brothers soap-making
plant at Port Sunlight on the Wirral in northwest England, joked
earlier in the day that the baby was taking a long time to arrive.
   ``We hope it is soon. We are fed up with waiting,'' the queen
told young mother Heidi Courtney during a tour of the plant earlier
today.
   Mrs. Courtney's 22-month-old blonde, curly-haired daughter Carla
handed a teddy bear to the queen, who said: ``If it is a little
girl, I hope my grandchild has curly hair like this.''
   Bookmakers William Hill stopped taking bets on the sex and name
of the baby in May after Andrew was quoted as saying it would be a
girl called Annabel.
   The baby will be Her Royal Highness, Princess of York. She is
fifth in line to the throne behind Andrew's older brother, Prince
Charles, his two children, Prince William and Prince Harry, and
Andrew himself. The queen's two other grandchildren, Peter and Zara
Phillips, are the children of her only daughter, Anne.
   Dr. Anthony Kenney, 45, the duchess' obstetrician, and a team of
specialists were on hand for her arrival at the $590-a-day
American-owned hospital.
   Most photographers who had camped in front of the hospital for
weeks missed the duchess' arrival. Even the few who were outside
the rear entrance said they caught only a glimpse of the duchess as
the car sped inside.
   The duchess' father, Maj. Ronald Ferguson, was quoted by the
British media as telling fellow polo players that baby's due date
was Aug. 11.
   Andrew married the former Sarah Ferguson on July 23, 1986 at
Westminster Abbey.
   Hours after his arrival on Sunday, Andrew took his wife for a
20-minute drive in the Surrey countryside on what was the hottest
day of the year.
   Outside the hospital, crowds had been waiting for several days
and started growing as soon as the word was out that the duchess
had been admitted.
   A white banner has been flying outside the hospital for several
days saying: ``Any Minute Now!''

   An avalanche roared down on Prince
Charles's skiing party Thursday, killing a close friend. The future
British king was unhurt, but a witness said he trembled and wept as
a rescue helicopter arrived.
   Swiss officials had warned earlier Thursday of possible
avalanches in the area.
   The dead skier was identified as Maj. Hugh Lindsay, 34, a former
aide to Queen Elizabeth II, the prince's mother. Buckingham Palace
said another skiier, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson, suffered leg
injuries.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, said
Charles helped dig the victims out of the snow.
   Charles was not injured, and his wife Diana and pregnant
sister-in-law the Duchess of York were safe in a chalet at the time
of the avalanche, said the palace statement issued in London.
   There were calls in Britain for members of the royal family to
take more care. Press Association said the Dutchess of York, the
wife of Charles's younger brother Prince Andrew, had a fall earlier
in the day from which she emerged wet and shaken. She was told to
spend the afternoon resting.
   Prince Andrew was not on the ski trip.
   Queen Elizabeth and her husband, Prince Philip, were attending
an official engagement in London when informed of the avalanche.
The queen later talked to Charles, 39, at the Alpine chalet where
the royal party had stayed since arriving Tuesday.
   Witnesses on the mountain said Charles, the Prince of Wales and
heir to the throne, looked distraught after the avalanche buried
two of the six people in his party. One said he was weeping and
shaking when the helicopter came.
   Buckingham Palace said Charles and the others were off the main
ski trails near an extremely steep run, and were stationary when
the snow began to move.
   Charles has vacationed in the Klosters ski area for years, knows
it well and is considered good on the slopes.
   The party, including a guide, was on Mount Gotschnawang when the
snow rushed down from about 100 yards above at 2:50 p.m., said
officials of the Grisons canton, or state.
   Lindsay and Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson were flown to a hospital in
Davos, the officials said.
   According to the palace statement, ``All members of the party
were in a position to take avoiding action with the exception of
Maj. Lindsay and Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson who were both caught in the
avalanche.''
   Another statement Thursday night said: ``The Prince of Wales and
the whole party are naturally extremely distressed by this tragic
accident which resulted in the death of their close friend Maj.
Hugh Lindsay and serious injury to Mrs. Patti Palmer-Tomkinson.''
   Hanspeter Kirchhofer, an investigating magistrate in Davos, said
Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson was being treated for fractures of both legs
and was ``doing well under the circumstances.''
   The Gotschnawang station on the cable car, which skiiers ride up
the mountain, is at 7,540 feet and the prince's party had skied
down to about 5,800. The Swiss Federal Avalanche Research Institute
had warned of considerable avalanche danger above 5,200 feet in
northern Grisons.
   Lindsay was the 12th snowslide victim of the winter in
Switzerland.
   Earlier Thursday, a Polish mountain climber was killed on the
north wall of Mount Eiger, about 95 miles to the southwest.
   Charles, Diana and the Duchess of York posed for photographers
Wednesday at Klosters. The 28-year-old duchess, the former Sarah
Ferguson, is expecting her first baby in August.
   Lindsay was a close friend of Charles and Diana, who attended
his wedding last July. He frequently accompanied them on their
annual ski holiday at Klosters.
   Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson and her husband, Charles, also vacation
with the royal couple at Klosters.
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publisher of the Burke's Peerage directory
of the aristocracy, said his representative in Switzerland told him
the royal party was warned of the avalanche danger.
   ``We have constantly suggested to the royal family that they be
more prudent,'' he told a reporter. ``They constantly act as though
nothing can harm them. ... After all, these people don't belong
just to families but to the world.''
   Charles had a spectacular crash on Gotschnawang in 1979, landing
on his hip and escaping unhurt.

   Andrew and Sarah, the duke and duchess of
York, transformed into Andy and Fergie, the down-home celebrities,
snacking at a supermarket deli, decorating a cake and shaking hands
with screaming fans.
   The royal couple's ``walkabout'' along the edge of a crowd
outside a supermarket Monday was their closest unplanned contact
with everyday Americans during a Southern California tour that has
included much hobnobbing with Hollywood celebrities.
   ``I love them both. I think Fergie and Di are just _ American,''
said Susie Clayton, referring also to Diana, the Princess of Wales.
   Ms. Clayton, 27, visiting from Arizona, waited for two hours in
on-and-off rain that could have been imported from Britain for the
royal retinue to arrive at the Von's Pavilions market in suburban
Arcadia.
   Prince Andrew and his pregnant wife, midway through their 10-day
tour, plan to meet with British denizens of Hollywood today during
a new round of stops that includes a trip to a trendy disco.
   They have already been greeted by famous faces like Roger Moore
of James Bond fame; Joan Collins, the wicked queen of the
``Dynasty'' dynasty; and Michael York, a movie actor who lately has
appeared on ``Knots Landing.''
   York, who greeted the royal pair during their travels Monday,
said that the duke and duchess have a glamour of their own.
   ``They have a youth, glamour and pizazz and they preserve a
longstanding tradition,'' he said.
   Today, Andrew and Sarah were to take a tour of Showscan, a movie
special effects studio in suburban Culver City. Later, they planned
to meet with British Oscar winners at the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences in Beverly Hills.
   Finishing out their round of entertaining the entertainment
community, they were to attend a lunch for the British Academy of
Film and Television Arts.
   Two fashion shows were laid on to finish the royal day, one at
the Music Center, and another at the Stock Exchange disco downtown.
   The royal couple is in the United States to promote trade to
Great Britain and act as patrons of the three-month UK-LA '88
festival, a celebration of the British arts in Los Angeles.
   On Monday, apart from the supermarket, the couple visited a
technology museum and the Wilshire Bullocks department store, where
they were joined by a Hollywood entourage that included Lynn
Redgrave, George Peppard and Lloyd Bridges.
   At the supermarket, the duchess cruised the aisles and paid
particular attention to the deli section, pausing to examine sushi
and stuffed chicken breasts but tasting only one item _ a dollop of
coffee-toffee chip ice cream.
   ``She said she loved the pastry but was afraid to eat it,''
confided assistant bakery manager Barbara Huereque, who recognized
a sister calorie-counter.
   Both the duchess and duke tried their hand at decorating a cake.
Andrew produced a vague approximation of a red rose and she made a
lopsided white rose, symbol of the house of York.

<HEAD>Bookmakers Stop Bets On Sex and Name of Duchess' Baby</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of London's leading bookmakers has stopped
taking bets on the sex and name of the Duchess of York's unborn
child because her husband, Prince Andrew, was quoted as saying it
will be a girl called Annabel.
   The Sun newspaper reported Friday that Andrew told a Yorkshire
cricket team about his prediction this week after the team offered
him a child's cricket bat.
   ``It won't be much use. I'm sure we are having a girl,'' the
paper quoted Andrew as saying. It said the 28-year-old prince, a
Royal Navy helicopter pilot, told the guests the baby will be
called Annabel.
   In Britain, cricket is primarily played by boys.
   The former Sarah Ferguson, who married Queen Elizabeth II's son
in July 1986, is expecting their first child in August.
   Buckingham Palace said the report that the 28-year-old duchess
was expecting a girl was just speculation.
   ``Certainly, we are not in a position to talk about the private
coversations of the Duke of York. It's all speculation,'' said a
spokeswoman, who by custom was not identified.
   But Graham Sharpe, a spokesman for bookmakers William Hill,
said: ``We decided that the reported remarks of the Duke of York
represented an ideal opportunity for us to close the book on the
sex and name of the baby.''
   Sharpe said if Andrew's quote had surfaced soon after the
duchess become pregnant, ``we might not have given it credence.''
   But now that she's six months along, he said, ``they must have a
good idea of what they would call the baby, be it male or female.
After six months, if they want to know what the sex of the baby is,
it's very easy to find out.''
   In recent weeks, he said, Annabel went from a 20-1 to 3-1
favorite.
   ``The last time anything similar happened was when we had heavy
backing for the name William to be chosen as the name of Charles
and Diana's firstborn, and of course we all know what happened
there.''
   Andrew's older brother, Prince Charles, and his wife, Princess
Diana, chose William as the name of their first son, who was born
in June 1982. William is second in line to the British throne
behind his father.
   Sharpe said William Hill had taken in about $56,000 in bets on
the name and sex of the baby.
   ``It's not as much as was bet on William, but it's more than on
Harry,'' he said. Prince Harry, the second son of Charles and
Diana, was born in September 1984.
   Sharpe said punters with an appetite for things royal would
still be able to bet on the weight of the duchess' baby and its
birth date. ``We're offering 7-1 against them being able to tell us
the date on which the baby is born,'' he said.

   A beaming Prince Andrew welcomed Princess Diana
and her two sons with kisses and hugs when they arrived at Portland
Hospital on Wednesday for the first glimpse of the newest addition
to the royal family.
   Andrew's wife, Sarah, the Duchess of York, gave birth Monday
night to their first child, the still-unnamed Princess of York.
Mother and daughter are ``very well,'' Buckingham Palace said.
   Coral Bookmakers offered short odds on the princess being named
Charlotte, although British newspapers speculated Annabel, Victoria
and Elizabeth were also possible choices.
   More than 100 well-wishers cheered as Diana and her sons,
Princes William and Harry, arrived for their brief visit.
   It is not known when the duchess and baby will leave hospital,
although Andrew must return to his Royal Navy duties in the Far
East next week.
   The palace confirmed the duchess was expected to take the baby
to Balmoral Castle in Scotland ``at some stage'' this summer to see
her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.
   Andrew is the queen's second-oldest son and the baby is her
fifth grandchild.

   The Duchess of York, daughter-in-law of Queen
Elizabeth II, is expecting another baby in March, Buckingham Palace
announced today.
   The former Sarah Ferguson and her husband, Prince Andrew, were
``very pleased'' to make the announcement, said a palace statement.
   Andrew is the second son of Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh,
and the baby will be the monarch's sixth grandchild.
   For the royal family, it provided a happy contrast to the
announcement Aug. 30 that Andrew's older sister, Princess Anne, is
separating from her husband of nearly 16 years, Mark Phillips.
   If the new baby is a boy, he will supercede his sister,
13-month-old Princess Beatrice, to become fifth in line to the
throne. A girl would follow Beatrice as sixth in line.
   The palace said the duchess was ``in excellent health,'' and was
expected to fulfill her existing program of engagements, while
scaling down her activities toward the end of the year.
   Andrew, 29, a navy lieutenant, was attending a refresher
helicopter course at Portland navy base in southern England when the
announcement was made.
   The red-haired duchess, who will be age 30 in October, was
attending a literary luncheon, having recently written and published
two children's books about a helicopter named Budgie.
   ``Budgie at Bendick's Point'' and ``Budgie The Little
Helicopter'' are dedicated to Andrew and Beatrice respectively.
   Sarah and Andrew are both licensed helicopter pilots.

   More than 800 guests attended a glittering ball
held by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday night
toate the 90th birthday of her mother this year and three
other royal anniversaries in 1990.
   The ball marked the 90th birthday of Elizabeth the Queen Mother
on Aug. 4, the 60th birthday of the queen's sister Princess
Margaret on Aug. 21, the 40th birthday of the queen's daughter
Princess Anne on Aug. 15 and the 30th birthday of the queen's
second son Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, on Feb. 19.
   Guests at what the palace called ``the dance of the decades''
included personal friends of the royals from the arts, politics and
high society and scores of other celebrities and dignitaries.
   The palace in a brief statement described it as a private
function as opposed to a formal state occasion. Almost every member
of the royal family was present to welcome the guests.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association described it
as the biggest party at the palace since the one in November 1988
marking the 40th birthday of Prince Charles, the queen's eldest son
and heir to the throne.
   Guests held dinner parties at top restaurants throughout
London's West End before driving to the palace for the ball, which
began shortly after 10 p.m.
   Because of the large number of guests, the palace picture
gallery with its valuable collection of Old Master paintings was
transformed into a ballroom.
   Its gilded ceiling was hung with blue draperies and the gallery
was lit by a starry constellation of white lights. Drawing rooms
and and the music room leading from the gallery were filled with
huge arrangements of flowers.
   Guests included songwriter Tim Rice; singer Cleo Laine; Maj.
Ronald Ferguson, the father of Prince Andrew's wife the Duchess of
York, formerly Sarah Ferguson; Mark Thatcher, son of former Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, and Thatcher's American wife Diane.

   Argentine polo player Hector
Barrantes, stepfather of Britain's Duchess of York, died after a
long battle with cancer, the official news agency Telam reported
Saturday. He was 51.
   Barrantes died Friday at his polo ranch in Guamini, 335 miles
southwest of Buenos Aires, the agency said.
   He was buried Saturday at Peace Garden cemetery in Buenos Aires.
   The Duchess of York, the former Sarah Ferguson, returned to
London from Argentina on Thursday morning after a 10-day visit to
her ailing stepfather. She made the trip to Argentina with her two
children, Princess Beatrice, 2, and 4-month-old Princess Eugenie.
   In London, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said she was informed
immediately after his death Friday night. ``There is no question of
her returning to Argentina immediately,'' said the spokesman, who
by custom was not identified.
   The duchess is spending the weekend quietly with friends, the
spokesman said. Her husband, Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen
Elizabeth II, is a Royal Navy pilot currently on duty aboard HMS
Campbelton.
   Barrantes, born to a poor, working-class family, rose to become
a man who was at home with the British aristocracy.
   He got his big break at 15 when he was introduced to polo ponies.
   He first came to England in 1967 and three years later was
employed by Lord Vestey to play polo for Vestey's Stowell Park team.
   Barrantes first wife died in a car crash.
   In 1974, shock waves flowed through British society when Susan
Ferguson, niece of Viscount Powerscourt, left her husband, Maj.
Ronald Ferguson, and her daughters Sarah and Jane, to start a new
life with her husband's rival on the polo field. The Fergusons'
18-year marriage ended in divorce that year and Barrantes married
Susan in a civil ceremony in Argentina in 1975.
   Barrantes detected the first warning signs of cancer in
September, underwent surgery at a Buenos Aires clinic, and was
flown to New York where doctors confirmed he had cancer of the
lymph glands.
   He underwent chemotherapy before returning to his 1,000 acre
ranch, El Pucara, where he bred polo ponies. Barrantes had
described his illness as the ``first great inconvenience I've ever
encountered.''
   In an interview with Hello! magazine, he said: ``I'm not afraid
of dying. Having a clear conscience makes you face death in another
way.''
   He told the magazine the ranch would eventually be left to the
duchess.
   ``Sarah was there when we started work on the ranch in 1980. We
planted the first trees with her. She helped us move over there.
Sarah loves the place and in the end it will be hers.''
   Despite the rupture in Anglo-Argentine relations following the
1982 Falklands War, Barrantes was welcomed by the queen and Prince
Philip to the extended royal family when Andrew married his
stepdaughter in 1986.
   The duchess was the first member of the royal family to visit
Argentina since the war. Argentina and Britain restored full
diplomatic relations earlier this year.
   Barrantes is survived by his wife, Susan.

<LEADPARA>  I HAVE never met the Queen of England, who visited the United States last
week, nor seen her in person. But on one occasion I almost knocked down her
mother, the Queen Mother.;    I was walking near St. Paul's Cathedral in
London, not particularly watching where I was going, when a limousine pulled
up to the curb and out stepped the ever-smiling Queen Mother, dainty in an
organdy dress and wide-brimmed hat.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Waving to the instant audience that gathered, she stepped onto the sidewalk
-- and I almost collided with her.;    That's the closest I've ever come to
meeting a member of the royal family, but it shows how accessible they are. If
I were determined enough, I could easily see -- if not meet -- every one of
the royals residing in London.;    Royals-watching is something like
star-watching. If you want to see a movie star in Hollywood, you go where they
are likely to appear.;    The same is true in London, only the palace makes it
easy: It publishes a monthly calendar listing the public appearances of the
royals. Among newspapers that print this list are the London Times, the
Telegraph and the Independent.;    Usually there's a royal appearance of one
kind or another every day. When I was in London a few years back, for
instance, the Duchess of York was to make a presentation at the Dulwich
Picture Galley at noon and attend an "Evening at the Races" at 7:55 p.m. at
the Savoy Hotel. Meanwhile, Princess Diana was to attend a preview of the
Chelsea Flower Show that evening.;    Such appearances are almost always
covered by London's headline-seeking tabloids, who are inveterate
royals-trackers. Some newspapers, like the Sun, have a full-time royals
reporter.;    For the general public, these appearances provide only a glimpse
of a royal personage as he or she moves from limousine to ceremony. For a more
candid -- and perhaps longer -- look at the royals, the thing to do is to hang
out at places where they are known to stay or visit.;    Prince Charles and
his family, for instance, live in London's Kensington Palace; a patient
royals-watcher may spot Princess Diana sending off sons Prince William and
Prince Henry to school in the mornings.;    Kensington Palace is also home to
several other members of the royal family, including Princess Margaret, the
Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and their three children, and Prince and
Princess Michael of Kent and their two children.;    The best place to spot
the royals at Kensington Palace is near the entrance on the side away from
Kensington Gardens Park, according to "Fodor's Royalty Watching," an excellent
guidebook that details the many places and events where the royals can be
seen.;    Unlike Buckingham Palace, where the Queen resides, parts of
Kensington Palace are open to the public. On display in the baroque state
apartments is a collection of court costumes.;    On the other hand, only the
Queen's Gallery and the Royal Mews are open to the public at stately
Buckingham Palace. The gallery displays some of the Queen's extraordinary
collection of paintings. In the mews, or stables, are the gilded state
coaches, including those used in coronations.;    Visitors also can watch the
changing-of-the-guard ceremony in the palace forecourt at 11 a.m. daily. It's
difficult to see much of this popular ritual because the heavy crowd cuts off
the view. Get there early or buy a periscope.;    The rest of the palace is
off-limits. In addition to the Queen, Buckingham is home to Prince Edward and
Princess Anne. Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York also stay here when in
town.;    It's possible to spot a royal or two coming and going at Buckingham,
but don't wait at the front gate; they use the side entrances.;    Most of the
royals also have homes outside London. Prince Charles' house in the Cotswolds
Hills is called Highgrove. Prince Andrew built a home in Sunninghill,
Berkshire, adjoining Windsor Great Park. Princess Anne has a place in Gatcombe
Park in Gloucestershire. The Queen has several castles, including Windsor and
Balmoral.;    Certain events bring out the royals. The royal enclosure at the
Royal Ascot races in June is always a good place to spot a crowned head or
two, as are the polo matches at nearby Smith's Lawn. Beware, however, of the
English tabloid photographers. They will elbow and jostle unmercifully just to
get a photo, as some of us found out one day when both Princess Diana and the
Duchess of York came to the polo matches attired in polka-dot outfits,
creating a photo frenzy.;    The Queen, of course, makes many public
appearances. One of the most colorful is the Trooping of the Color, a
celebration of the Queen's birthday held every year on the second Saturday in
June. She rides in a carriage. Other members of the royal family watch the
ceremony from the Horse Guards building.;    After the march, the Queen and
royal family gather on the Buckingham Palace balcony to watch a flyover by the
Royal Air Force. Camera-toting visitors equipped with a telephoto lens can
make their own souvenir photos of the royal family at this time.;    Now that
his broken arm has mended, Prince Charles is likely to resume playing polo at
Smith's Lawn, near the Ascot race course. Among the spectators may be his
father, the Duke of Edinburgh, or his wife, Princess Diana, though Di's
presence is becoming increasingly unlikely.;    Most royals watchers, however,
cherish the views they get of their distinguished targets during their less
public moments -- if, for instance, one happens to dine in the same restaurant
as Princess Diana, or spot Prince Andrew and the spirited Duchess of York in a
nightclub.;    These are chance occurrences, of course, since the royals do
not broadcast their private itineraries. But your chances of spotting a royal
are better if you visit the places where they are known to frequent.;    I
once missed seeing Princess Diana by just a day at Green's, a classy
restaurant on Duke Street in Mayfair. On a later visit there, I talked with
the manager, David Wicker.;    "Someone printed what she (Princess Diana)
dined on, so I got a letter from her lady-in-waiting, saying she was
displeased. But she's been here since." Wicker said people hardly turn their
heads when royal diners come in, and detectives don't let people approach
them.;    Other restaurants popular with members of the royal family include
Caprice, San Lorenzo, Mirabelle's, Belinsky's Balloon, Langan's Brasserie,
Annabel's Club (private), and the Clauserie in Claridge's Hotel.;    It's a
heady world the royals travel in, but it may not be as exciting as one might
think.;    A year or so ago in London, I saw a wonderful series of clips of
Princess Diana greeting person after person in a receiving line and becoming
progressively and utterly bored with it all.;    Which goes to show that for
all their pomp and circumstance, the royals are just as human as we commoners.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   In the two years since she married the queen's
second son Andrew, the Duchess of York has brought both sparkle and
new controversy to the royal scene.
   Some critics find her vivacious personality and sense of fun
tiresome or vulgar, her adventurous spirit verging on the reckless.
   But royal watchers say the 28-year-old former Sarah Ferguson is
a favorite with Queen Elizabeth II.
   Prince Andrew, a tall, handsome Royal Navy lieutenant, gained a
playboy reputation during a colorful bachelorhood. It included a
well-publicized romance with an American actress, Koo Stark, who
once appeared in soft-porn movies.
   But by the spring of 1986 Andrew was clearly smitten with the
red-haired Miss Ferguson. The public were enjoying her lively good
nature and the queen was reported to be greatly relieved that
Andrew had found a suitable wife.
   They married at Westminster Abbey July 23, 1986, and became the
Duke and Duchess of York. Both were 26.
   Sarah Ferguson was a new kind of royal bride.
   A sales executive with a graphic arts publishing company when
she married, she had led a free and independent life that included
a three-year romance with motor-racing figure Paddy McNally, a
widower with two sons.
   Robust, athletic and outspoken, Sarah was far from the slim,
demure and impeccably-groomed English rose that Princess Diana,
wife of Prince Charles, typified.
   She kept working after her marriage, and although she had given
up her publishing job by early 1988, she planned to do free-lance
work.
   While Andrew pursued his career as a Royal Navy pilot, his wife
learned to fly a helicopter and a plane so she could share the
experience with him.
   The Yorks have rejected the traditional choice of an old stately
home and are building a new house near Windsor Castle _ in a
neo-Tudor style that has drawn some criticism.
   Sarah's attempts to find a fashion sense of her own led to some
howling failures, each of which was dissected in the press.
   The media also criticized what they saw as the duchess' brash
and vulgar behavior during the couple's March U.S. tour,
particularly in Los Angeles.
   Newspapers were especially critical of the duchess' quip: ``I'll
see you later,'' to a man who yelled out, ``I love you'' at a
dinner.
   When Sarah wore a flamboyant black-and-red gown to a black-tie
dinner, Craig Brown of The Sunday Times wrote: ``While the stars of
Hollywood dressed in discreet black and stayed in the shadows, down
the stairs walloped someone who looked as if she'd just won third
prize for her Carmen Miranda impersonation ... at some forgotten
resort.''
   ``Has the Duchess of York gone too far?'' asked the Observer
newspaper.
   As Sarah grew heavily pregnant, the tabloids carried
unflattering photos of her and made remarks about her weight.
   But the duchess's sense of humor scarcely flagged _ except in
May when a newspaper carried a photo of her father, Maj. Ronald
Ferguson, emerging from a London massage parlor.
   While some newspapers called him Romeo Ronnie and suggested he
be fired from his job as polo manager to Prince Charles, the heir
to the throne, and others said the duchess was advised to avoid him
in public, Sarah was photographed speaking to her father, worriedly.
   The major had become a close friend of the queen's husband,
Prince Philip, through their shared interest in polo. Sarah, born
Oct. 15, 1959, has known all the queen's children since childhood.
   She became a close friend of Diana, who is reported to have done
some matchmaking in Sarah's relationship with Andrew.
   Sarah grew up at her family's 18th-century farmhouse set in
1,200 acres of rolling Hampshire countryside at Dummer. She was
educated at two local boarding schools, Daneshill and Hurst Lodge,
where she was head girl _ the school leader _ excelling at sports
rather than studies.
   Sarah's parents divorced when she was 14, and her mother, Susan,
married Argentine polo professional Hector Barrantes. They live at
Trenque Laughen near Buenos Aires and travel the international polo
circuit.
   After school, Sarah studied at St. James' secretarial college in
London. Then it was off to work, first at an apartment rental
agency, then at a Covent Garden art gallery, a sports public
relations agency and finally as a sales executive with B.C.K.
Graphic Arts in fashionable Mayfair.

<HEAD>Britain's Newest Princess Leaves Hospital; Still Unnamed</HEAD>

   Britain's newest princess entered royal life in
high style Friday with a flight to the queen's summer home in
Scotland after leaving the hospital with her parents, the Duke and
Duchess of York.
   Bundled in a white blanket, the still unnamed 4-day-old Princess
of York left Portland Hospital in the arms of her mother, Sarah, as
hundreds of spectators strained for a glimpse of her tiny face.
   A smiling Sarah wore a small bear-shaped badge which said, ``I'm
a Mum.''
   Minutes later, the princess was whisked off to Balmoral Castle,
where her grandmother Queen Elizabeth II was expected to approve a
name for her.
   The baby is the first child for Prince Andrew and his wife, and
the queen's fifth grandchild. She is fifth in line to the throne.
   The royal threesome drove straight from the hospital in central
London to a Royal Air Force base for a flight to the northern
Scottish coast and a car ride to the castle, said a Buckingham
Palace spokesman.
   The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, were to arrive at the
castle Monday after sailing up the Scottish coast on the royal
yacht Brittania, said the spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The monarch and her family traditionally spend parts of August
and September at the estate.
   At the hospital, hospital chefs and nurses joined several
hundred spectators awaiting the new princess' first appearance.
   Hospital spokeswoman Nicki Freer said, ``in general it has been
a pleasure having (the duchess) here. ... We all wanted to say
goodbye.''
   As the princess left the hospital, her face was barely visible,
but one newscaster narrating the event broadcast live on TV said
those ``with zoom lenses caught a glimpse of an eyebrow, an alert
eye, and a hint that she could have hair like her mother's.''
   There was a slight mishap when the red-headed Sarah handed the
baby to Andrew and stumbled while hurrying across the street to
receive a bouquet of pink carnations from an American tourist. She
recovered as bodyguards rushed to give her a hand.
   ``I waved my flowers and she started to walk over,'' said Heidi
Alasio of Eugene, Ore. ``I'm very glad she didn't fall over all the
way. It was a very nice gesture that she came to get the flowers.''
   Andrew told reporters he hoped he would suffer ``only a few''
sleepless nights because of the baby. He is scheduled to return to
his naval duties in the Far East next week.
   Asked about his feelings for his daughter, he said: ``I am
overjoyed.''
   British bookmakers and newspapers say likely choices for the
baby's name include Charlotte or Victoria, although Andrew was
quoted as saying in May that he favored Annabel.

<HEAD>Newspapers Jump To Defense of Duchess' Fashion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tabloids, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daily Mirror and other British tabloids have
risen to the defense of the Duchess of York, criticizing American
designer Richard Blackwell for having ``the barefaced cheek'' to put
her on his worst-dressed list.
   The Mirror said Tuesday that Blackwell was ``so sensitive about
his own precious looks that he's had them rearranged four times.''
   Blackwell had hit out at the former Sarah Ferguson in a preview
of his list of the world's 10 worst-dressed women, saying she has
none of the style of her sister-in-law Princess Diana, that she
looks ``as if she makes beds in Ireland or milks cows,'' and that
she ``walks like a duck with a bad leg.''
   Until recently, the tabloids have not been great fans of the
duchess' wardrobe, saying it runs to frumpy, outrageous and
ill-fitting.
   But the 29-year-old commoner, who married Prince Andrew in 1986,
has worked hard to retrieve her svelte figure following the birth of
their daughter, Princess Beatrice, and her stylish, well-cut new
wardrobe has won plaudits from the tabloids.
   For the popular press, which has a near-obsession with royal
watching and prints the minutest pieces of trivia, the attack on the
duchess was over the top, and below-the-belt ripostes about
facelifts were only to be expected.
   ``What A Jerk,'' bannered the Sun, Britain's largest selling
daily, on Monday. It quoted American model Marie Helvin as saying
nobody ``takes a blind bit of notice'' of Blackwell. Hardy Amies, a
favorite designer of Queen Elizabeth II, was quoted as calling him
``a complete ignoramus.''
   The rival Daily Star, under the headline ``He's At It Again!,''
accused Blackwell of ``talking through his hat.''
   The Daily Mirror noted that Blackwell's attack came ``just as the
new, slim-line Fergie is winning over fashion critics here ... in
well-cut outfits which suit her figure.''
   The newspaper Today said the duchess' new look had come ``just
too late to spare her another blasting'' from Blackwell.
   A Mirror cartoon showed Blackwell strung up to a Christmas tree,
the duchess standing on the floor dressed as a milkmaid, and Andrew
saying: ``Now then, Mr. Blackwell, what was it you said about my
wife?''

MAGAZINES: REDBOOK ISSUES A ROYAL CLIFFHANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Readers of the September Redbook -- which contains an excerpt of a children's 
story about a plucky little helicopter -- may wish their copy came equipped 
with an anti-aircraft missile. 
</P>
<P>
The weapon would be useful in venting the frustration or incredulity provoked 
by the slice of a forthcoming children's book by the Duchess of York, a.k.a. 
Fergie, wife of Britain's Prince Andrew, one of many heirs to the British 
throne. 
</P>
<P>
Called "Budgie the Little Helicopter," the three-page extract indicates that 
the story could well be titled "The Little Engine That Could Gets Rotor 
Blades." The tale opens with a bored Budgie -- his self-esteem in need of a 
lift -- lolling about his hangar. He meets a new aircraft, Pippa, a female 
Piper Warrior about to take her first flight. Off they go into the sky, where 
their carefree acrobatic play is soon darkened by an approaching thunderstorm. 
(It's not clear whether Budgie and Pippa filed a flight plan and checked the 
weather.) 
</P>
<P>
As the clouds move in they overhear an emergency radio call for Lionel -- the 
big tough helicopter who just happens to be out of touch at the moment -- to 
help in the search for a kidnaped little girl. Budgie and Pippa decide to do 
their bit, even though the control tower tells them they are "much too light 
and small" for a job that requires fully mature aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
But first they have to get through those inconvenient, roiling, 
lightning-streaked clouds. 
</P>
<P>
"Budgie felt the first drops of rain and heard the thunder," writes the 
Duchess, who flies a helicopter herself. "As he watched the lightning approach, 
he couldn't help feeling frightened." 
</P>
<P>
Do they make it? 
</P>
<P>
Impossible to say because the excerpt stops there, followed by a note from the 
cunning editors -- none of whom apparently have children: "The exciting ending 
is revealed in The Duchess' book, of course." 
</P>
<P>
This teaser smacks of venality and marketing strategy, even though the magazine 
reports that a portion of the book's royalties will be donated to an 
unspecified charity. It also represents Redbook's gushing attitude toward 
Fergie that starts with the cover blurb proclaiming that the cover photo of the 
Duchess was taken by Prince Andrew "just for us." 
</P>
<P>
Inside, a page of "Fascinating Fergie Facts" reveals a world record of sorts: 
"Fergie, by the way, holds a private pilot's license and a helicopter license 
-- the first royal lady ever to have either!" The editors also write that the 
Duchess' nanny is "a karate expert trained in self-defense against muggers, 
terrorists and kidnappers." 
</P>
<P>
Granted, Budgie is cute and it's hard to hate an anthropomorphized helicopter 
who wears a baseball cap. But is Redbook's fawning necessary? 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, unless parents rush out and buy the book -- to be published by Simon 
&amp; Schuster next month at $9.95 -- for their kids, no one can know whether 
Budgie and Pippa engineer a predictable daring rescue. Or if the Duchess has 
the artistic courage to send the two little flyers on a valorous but doomed 
mission. Which at least would nip the dread possibility of sequels and further 
excerpts in Redbook. 
</P>
<P>
As cruel fate would have it, the "Fergie Facts" page notes that the Duchess 
already has launched a second installment in Great Britain, "Budgie At 
Bendick's Point." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Bendick's Point is a convalescent hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere on the royal front, this week's People reports that the Duke and 
Duchess of York briefly jumped into trouble with their environmentally minded 
subjects. The uproar began when a newspaper reported that the pair gave their 
daughter, Princess Bea, a $3,270 rocking horse "made of mahogany from the 
endangered Brazilian rain forests" for her first birthday. Not true, Buckingham 
Palace retorted, explaining that the horse was a present to the baby from a toy 
firm before her birth. "So there is no question of the Duke and Duchess of York 
ordering and buying it, or choosing a special type of timber," the Palace said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Troubled Refugees 
</P>
<P>
In Stockton, the father of an 8-year-old Cambodian girl, one of five youngsters 
killed by gunman Patrick Purdy in a school yard last January, watches -- over 
and over -- a videotape of his daughter's funeral. A survivor of 
institutionalized slaughter in Southeast Asia, the father cannot let go of his 
anger and grief over the death of his child in America, despite the 
ministrations of mental-health professionals. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in California, Salvadoran refugee Heber Hernandez dreams of friends 
assassinated in the early 1980s by El Salvador's death squads. In the dream, 
Hernandez says he tells one friend, " 'But Felipe,' I said, 'I am sure you are 
dead.' And he told me, 'No, that's a lie.' So I said, 'Well, then where is 
Joaquin, our friend who was killed?' And Felipe says, 'He's fine, too. Don't 
believe what they tell you. We are alive.' " 
</P>
<P>
These are two vignettes from the troubling but enlightening spring-summer issue 
of California Tomorrow, which is devoted to the mental-health issues facing the 
state's ethnically diverse population. 
</P>
<P>
Describing the issue in an editorial, California Tomorrow president Lewis H. 
Butler maintains that California's perennially overloaded, financially strapped 
mental-health system has been unable to cope with the problems of immigrants 
and refugees. " . . . These concerns are compounded by the strains and 
complexities of building a workable multiethnic state. War trauma and culture 
shock have been added to the list of social ills afflicting Californians," 
Butler writes. 
</P>
<P>
He goes on to argue that Western and Anglo concepts of mental health may have 
to be redefined. "Clearly, in our communities, we must tap traditional sources 
of strength and healing," Butler maintains. "We have to turn to families and 
churches and tribes and elders and caring individuals, all of whom can be 
assisted by professionals but not replaced by them." 
</P>
<P>
A compilation of statistics at the front of the magazine illustrates the scope 
of the state's mental-health needs. For instance, among California's population 
of 7 million children under age 18, it is estimated that as many as 1.06 
million need some type of mental-health services. In the state's largest cities 
more than 15% of babies are born addicted to drugs or alcohol. Two years ago an 
assessment of the mental-health needs of Southeast Asian immigrants estimated 
that almost 28% were in "severe need" of mental-health assistance, compared 
with 3% of the general population. 
</P>
<P>
California Tomorrow, according to co-editor Bruce K. Kelley, is an outgrowth of 
a nonprofit organization of the same name founded six years ago to "promote 
issues of changing demographics and ethnic diversity" within the state. 
</P>
<P>
Until now, the quarterly has been distributed free to members of the 
legislature; locally elected officials and their staffs, and selected business, 
community and education leaders, Kelley said. With the latest issue, however,

   The Duke and Duchess of York today left a hospital
with their newborn daughter, the Princess of York. As the proud
parents waved to hundreds of well-wishers, the newest member of
Britain's royal family slept.
   The baby, still unnamed, was swaddled in a white blanket for her
first public appearance, broadcast live on British television.
   Born Monday night weighing 6 pounds, 12 ounces, she is the first
child for Prince Andrew, the second oldest son of Queen Elizabeth
II, and his wife, Sarah. She is the queen's fifth grandchild and
fifth in line to the throne.
   The duke and duchess, both 28, waved to the crowd as they left
central London's Portland Hospital at 12:37 p.m. with the princess
for an undisclosed location.
   Before leaving, the duchess handed the baby to her husband, then
stumbled on the pavement as she accepted a bouquet of pink
carnations from an American tourist.
   ``I waved my flowers and she started to walk over,'' said Heidi
Alasio of Eugene, Ore. ``I'm very glad she didn't fall over all the
way. It was a very nice gesture that she came to get the flowers.''
   A palace spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom, said the duchess was feeling ``fine.''
   Andrew told reporters he hoped he would suffer ``only a few''
sleepless nights because of the baby. He is scheduled to return to
his Royal Naval duties in the Far East next week.
   Asked about his feelings for his daughter, he said: ``I am
overjoyed.''
   It's not unusual for royal parents to take several days to
select appropriate names for their babies. The names must be
approved by the queen who is currently vacationing in Scotland.
   British bookmakers and newspapers say likely choices include
Charlotte or Victoria, although Andrew was quoted as saying in May
that he favored Annabel.
   Before arriving at the hospital, Andrew attended a Post Office
ceremony to unveil a set of postage stamps based on his photographs
of famous castles.
   The stamps, ranging in value from 1 pound ($1.70) to 5 pounds
($8.50) are the first designed by a member of Britain's royal
family.
   They show Windsor, Edinburgh, Caernarfon and Carrickfergus
castles, one for each country of the United Kingdom. All have
strong royal connections.
   Andrew, an accomplished amateur photographer, thanked the Post
Office for ``having the guts'' to invite him to take the
photographs.

<HEAD>Duchess Of York Returns To Britain And Her Baby After Six Week
Break</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Duchess of York returned to London today after
six weeks in Australia, carrying a toy koala bear as a present for
the 12-week-old baby girl she left behind in Britain.
   The 29-year-old duchess arrived at London's Heathrow Airport with
a white fluffy toy bear under her arm. She smiled at waiting
photographers but said nothing before she got into her Jaguar car
and took the wheel to drive into London.
   The baby, Princess Beatrice, stayed in Britain with a nanny while
the duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, was in Australia with her
husband, Prince Andrew, second oldest son of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Andrew, 28, a Royal Navy helicopter pilot, will remain with his
ship, the guided-missile destroyer HMS Edinburgh, and is not
expected back in Britain until Dec. 16.
   The couple had a narrow escape from serious injury Wednesday in
Fremantle, western Australia, when a steel cable securing the
Edinburgh to the dock snapped as they were saying goodbye.
   The duchess _ on the dock chatting with Andrew, who was on the
lower deck of the ship _ was whisked to safety by a security man who
saw the cable about to snap less than three yards from where she
stood.
   Andrew and other crew members ducked for cover as the cable
lashed back like a whip and smashed into the ship's hull.
   The duchess flew from Britain to Australia on Sept. 21 on her own
and met up with Andrew there for the couple's 10-day official tour
to help celebrate Australia's bicentennial.
   When Andrew returned to his ship, the duchess extended her stay
in Australia to have more time with him, traveling from port to port
to meet his ship.
   She also visited relatives in Australia and the British domestic
news agency Press Association said she comforted her elder sister
Jane over the reported breakup of her marriage with Australian
farmer Alex Makim.
   British tabloids criticized the duchess for spending so much time
away from her baby, who was born on Aug. 8. The duchess and Andrew
shrugged off the criticism and Buckingham Palace, as is customary,
refused to comment on the issue.

<TEXT>
   Prince Charles flew home Friday with the body of a
friend who was killed by a Swiss avalanche that nearly engulfed the
future king as it roared down a mountain in a ``terrifying matter
of seconds.''
   With Maj. Hugh Lindsay's pregnant widow, Sarah, the prince
watched as six soldiers from his dead friend's Royal Lancers
regiment bore the flag-draped coffin from the red and white jet of
the Queen's Flight.
   The 39-year-old heir to the throne was praised for helping save
the life of another skier in his party but called foolhardy for
skiing perilous slopes off the main trails of the Klosters resort.
   A private funeral service in Devon was being arranged for
Lindsay, but no date was announced. Independent Television News
reported that Lindsay, an avid cricket player, had said he wanted
his ashes to be scattered on the cricket ground in his home town of
Budleigh Salterton.
   Charles, his wife, Princess Diana, and sister-in-law, Sarah, the
Duchess of York, all dressed in black, walked under leaden skies
from the jet at Northolt air base near London.
   They were met by Mrs. Lindsay, 34, a Buckingham Palace press
officer who had helped answer inquiries about Thursday's accident
before discovering her husband had died.
   She and Lindsay, also 34, were married last summer and she
expects a baby in May. He was a former aide to Queen Elizabeth II,
the prince's mother.
   In a handwritten statement read to reporters at the Zurich
airport after the royal party left, Charles said he and five
companions were skiing ``at our risk and we all accepted ... that
mountains have to be treated with the greatest respect and not
treated lightly.''
   When the avalanche started ``with a trememdous roaring'' he and
three others skied out of its path, Charles said.
   Then, ``to my horror, Maj. Hugh Lindsay and Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson just failed to ski clear and were swept away in a
whirling maelstrom as the whole mountainside seemed to hurtle past
us to the valley below. It was all over in a terrifying matter of
seconds.''
   He described helping dig Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson out of the
snow with a shovel, then with his hands. Both of her legs were
broken and she is hospitalized in Switzerland.
   The royal party cut the skiiing holiday short. It began Tuesday
and ended tragically at 2:45 p.m. Thursday when the avalanche
hurtled down the mountain toward Charles; Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson;
her husband, Charles; Lindsay; Swiss guide Bruno Sprecher; and a
Swiss policeman.
   They were skiing off the main track between the treacherous
Gotschnawang and Drostobel trails at an altitude of about 5,800
feet when the snowslide began about 300 feet above them. Officials
had warned of avalanche danger at 5,200 feet and higher.
   ``Herr Sprecher acted with incredible speed and total
professionalism,'' the prince said. ``He skied down as fast as
possible, having told the Swiss policeman to radio for assistance.''
   Sprecher located Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson by a beeper on her body.
   ``Mr. Palmer-Tomkinson and I skied down and just arrived as Herr
Sprecher had reached Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson's head,'' the statement
said. ``He gave her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and revived her.
He gave me the shovel to dig her out and I tried using my hands as
well.
   ``At this point I sat with Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson while he
(Sprecher) quickly went to try and locate Maj. Lindsay. He found
him about 15 yards above Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson, but tragically he
had been killed outright during the fall.''
   Mrs. Lindsay left the Northolt base with her father. She was
carrying a bag apparently containing some of her husband's
belongings that the Duchess of York had given to her.
   Prince Charles departed for Windsor Castle, 20 miles away, to
see the queen and Diana and the Duchess of York went to Kensington
Palace.
   ``Thereafter their movements for the weekend are private,''
Buckingham Palace said.
   The accident highlighted the sometimes risky behavior of
Britain's royals.
   Hours before the avalanche, the Duchess of York, 28 and four
months pregnant, took a bad fall skiing.
   That night, the Royal Navy ship on which her husband, Prince
Andrew, is serving lost a helicopter with two crewmen off Portugal.
Andrew, younger brother of Charles, was not involved but he is a
helicopter pilot.
   The avalanche was the worst accident for the royal family since
Prince William of Gloucester, a cousin of the queen, died in a
crash during an air race in 1972.
   Newspapers clamored on Friday for Charles and other members of
the royal family to give up dangerous pursuits.
   ``Why was he there?'' the tabloid Sun asked. ``Charles has
consistently risked his life by going on increasingly deadly
slopes.''
   Charles is an ardent polo player who has taken many falls, and
had a near-collision while flying a plane. On his first parachute
jump he snarled the rigging and fell several thousand feet before
untangling it.

   The Duke and Duchess of York's 10-day dash
through California headed for the home stretch Friday as the royal
couple met Los Angeles' duke of oil and prepared to visit a UCLA
film class and a sculpture made of 600 Barbie and Ken dolls.
   The visit with Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chairman Armand
Hammer, 89, kicked off the eighth day of a whirlwind tour by Prince
Andrew and his pregnant, red-haired wife, the former Sarah Ferguson.
   ``Hi, Fergie!'' two dozen spectators chanted as Sarah emerged
from a Rolls-Royce limousine clad in a navy-blue suit, a brimless
rust-colored hat and brown shoes. Andrew, in a dark business suit,
and his wife waved politely to the small crowd.
   Hammer escorted the couple into his Wilshire Boulevard corporate
headquarters for talks over coffee and rolls. Mayor Tom Bradley
showed up for the last 10 minutes of the meeting.
   As Hammer and Bradley escorted Andrew and Sarah back to their
car, a teen-age girl gave Sarah a bouquet and spectators yelled,
``It's wonderful seeing you'' and ``Come back again!''
   ``It's amazing,'' said British-born spectator Elaine Ball, who
has lived in Los Angeles for five years. ``You never see the royal
family over there, but you come 6,000 miles and you can see them.''
   The duke and duchess sped to the nearby University of
California, Los Angeles, where they were greeted by Chancellor
Charles Young, his wife and a crowd of 200 students _ some yelling
``Sarah! Sarah!'' _ then swiftly escorted to a luncheon with more
than 100 students.
   ``Sarah's so pretty,'' said student Rachel Perse, 19.
   ``Andy looked good, too!'' added 20-year-old Roberta Salazar.
   The royal itinerary at UCLA included a stop to view sculptures
of the Barbie and Ken dolls and UCLA's Bruin Bear mascot; a gift to
Andrew and Sarah of historical newsreel footage of the royal
family; visits to a film-making class and the Jules Stein Eye
Institute; and a walk across the Center for Health Sciences Plaza.
   The sculpture of Barbie and Ken dolls, entitled ``Off the Beaten
Track,'' was created by 31-year-old Scottish-born artist David
Mach. His work, on view through March 13 outside a UCLA art
gallery, consists of a two-ton, 20-by-10-foot cargo bin that
appears to be supported by the 600 dolls, their arms outstretched
above them.
   Mach's sculpture, which purportedly satirizes consumerism, is on
display as part of ``UK@LA '88: A Celebration of British Arts,''
which Andrew and Sarah are promoting on their visit.
   After leaving UCLA by helicopter, the duke and duchess were due
in Palm Springs to open a department store boutique Saturday
morning. Then they will travel to the Eldorado Polo Club in nearby
Indio to attend a polo match to benefit efforts to rebuild
Shakespeare's Globe Theater on its original site on the banks of
the Thames River.
   Sarah's father, Major Ronald Ferguson, will be captain of the
Windsor Park team in the polo match.
   On Sunday, the royal couple are scheduled to travel from Palm
Springs to Los Angeles for a flight back to London.

   Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, open their
10-day California visit with a Hollywood-style welcome from Los
Lobos, the hometown group featured in the hit film ``La Bamba.''
   After a welcoming ceremony at City Hall today, the Duke and
Duchess of York were to be entertained by Los Lobos.
   The group was to perform ``La Bamba,'' the rollicking Spanish
song immortalized by Ritchie Valens, the subject of last summer's
movie. Valens died in a 1959 plane crash with rockers Buddy Holly
and the Big Bopper.
   The royal couple arrived amid tight security in spring-like
weather Friday, five years to the day after the start of a similar
tour by Andrew's parents, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip.
   ``He's a friendly, outgoing young man and we're happy to have
him in our city,'' Mayor Tom Bradley said after welcoming the
couple at Los Angeles International Airport.
   Their tour is crammed with receptions, banquets, tours,
exhibitions and other official functions.
   Today, the royal pair were to tour Chinatown, visit an
elementary school, have lunch with Bradley, and host a press
reception aboard the royal yacht Britannia, docked at Long Beach.
   Security personnel experienced some tense moments Friday when
they found an abandoned briefcase about a block from where the
Brittania was docked. A State Department bomb unit exploded the
attache case.
   ``It was no bomb,'' said a British consulate spokeswoman who did
not want her name used.
   The duke and duchess deplaned at a remote section of the airport
after an 11-hour flight from London. A red carpet flanked by
American and British flags was rolled out to the stairway to the
plane.
   The couple were greeted by Bradley, Los Angeles County
Supervisor Deane Dana, British Consul General Donald Ballentyne and
their wives.
   Sarah, wearing a black suit, a blue-and-green blouse and a black
bow, was handed a bouquet by the mayor's wife, Ethel. The prince,
wearing a gray suit, waved at reporters and photographers.
   The couple boarded a black-and-white Rolls Royce limousine,
which quickly departed in a motorcade to Long Beach.
   Andrew, 28, and his wife, the former Sarah Ferguson, also 28,
will spend much of their time taking part in the UK-LA Festival, a
celebration of British cultural and commercial achievement.
   Gynecologist Anthony Kenney is traveling with the couple to
monitor Sarah's first pregnancy. The baby is due in August.
   The prince, the third child of Queen Elizabeth II, was a
rollicking bachelor dubbed ``Randy Andy'' when he visited Los
Angeles four years ago. The trip's most memorable moment came when
he turned a paint sprayer on the press corps while visiting a
housing project.

POLL SHOWS PUBLIC 'DISGUSTED' BY BEHAVIOR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     How many of the royal family's subjects are losing sleep over this matter
is not clear. But in a phone-in poll over the weekend, 83 percent of those
participating pronounced themselves "disgusted.";    That in turn prompted the
tabloid newspaper Today to declare with just the slightest overstatement: "The
Queen is today facing the biggest royal crisis since the Abdication (of Edward
VIII) more than 50 years ago.";    Among the elements in the indictment are
these:;    Prince Philip and Prince Charles have gone hunting. Prince Andrew
has played golf. The Duchess of York, also known as Fergie, has enjoyed a loud
meal with some friends at a London restaurant.;    Lord Linley, the Queen's
nephew, took a vacation in the Caribbean with his girlfriend. Lord Althrop,
the Queen's godson, had an adulterous affair in France.;    Queen Elizabeth
and Princess Diana are generally considered to have impeccably performed their
wartime duties.;    But, as royals watchers have noted, it is always the
"minor royals" and the "nearly royals" who ruin things for everyone.;    What
distinguishes this flap from the kind that arises every other week in this
country is that the criticism has come from high places.;    Harold
Brooks-Baker, editor of Burke's Peerage, the bible of the British aristocracy,
has weighed in with his warning.;    So, too, have the editors of the Sunday
Times, which, like Today, is owned by media baron Rupert Murdoch.;    "On the
home front," the editors wrote, "too many of the young royals and their
entourages carry on regardless with their peacetime lifestyles, parading a
mixture of upper-class decadence and insensitivity which disgusts the public
and demeans the monarchy. The Queen should put a stop to it.";    Coming from
one of the so-called "quality papers," that attack was too much to take for
Charles Anson, the press secretary at Buckingham Palace.;    He responded by
putting out a list of war-related appearances by members of the royal family
since British forces were first deployed in the gulf in August.;    And as if
to answer the charges, the royals were out Monday doing their duty. Prince
Charles and Princess Diana visited navy families in Plymouth; Princess Anne
was at a military base in Germany; and Prince Philip was seeing soldiers in
Northern Ireland.  </TEXT>

   The Duchess of York and Prince Andrew are expecting
a baby that would be their second child and the sixth grandchild of
Queen Elizabeth II.
   ``I just want a happy, healthy baby and a friend for Beatrice. It
will be nice for Beatrice to have someone to play with,'' said the
former Sarah Ferguson, who is due in March and whose first baby was
born 13 months ago.
   The red-haired duchess known as ``Fergie,'' who will be 30 on
Oct. 15, spoke at a literary luncheon Tuesday hours after the formal
announcement by Buckingham Palace. Her husband, also 29, was on duty
as a Royal Navy lieutenant at Portland in southwest England.
   ``Andrew is flying a helicopter somewhere today, but he is
naturally delighted,'' the duchess said. ``We are absolutely
ecstatic.''
   Television personality David Frost announced the pregnancy to the
300 guests at the luncheon honoring the duchess as the author of two
children's books about a helicopter named Budgie.
   If the baby is a boy, the British order of succession will put
him ahead of his sister as the fifth in line to the throne, after
Prince Charles, his two sons and Prince Andrew.

   In addition, Maureen Reagan paid her father a surprise visit,

   Reagan, 78, underwent surgery Friday at St. Marys Hospital to
drain fluid that built up on his brain after he was thrown from a

said.
   ``We're still hopeful, if the present rate of progress continues,
he will be able to return to California by the end of the week,''
Weinberg said. ``There are no plans at this point for any additional

   Jazz pianist Dave Brubeck will ``Take
Five'' tonight to become the first person inducted into the
University of Pacific's new Pantheon of the Arts.
   Actor Burgess Meredith, a longtime friend of Brubeck's, will be
master of ceremonies for the induction at the independent,
5,800-student university.
   Brubeck will show his appreciation by presenting a concert Friday
evening with the Stockton Symphony in this city 75 miles east of San
Francisco. Proceeds will go toward a Conservatory of Music-Stockton
Symphony string scholarship.
   Brubeck attended then-College of the Pacific with plans to become
a veterinarian. But legend has it that a science professor so often
found Brubeck rewriting melodies that wafted through the windows
from the music conservatory that he suggested his young charge
``just go over there.''
   Brubeck did, graduating in 1942 as a music major and going on to
pioneer a style called progressive jazz with compositions such as
``Take Five.''

   Walker, whose strip ``Beetle Bailey'' is about Army life, founded
the museum in 1974.
   Eisner, who drew and wrote ``The Spirit'' for 10 years, has
become one of the leading artists in graphic novels, the museum said.
   Browne, who invented ``Hagar the Horrible'' about a good-natured
Viking chief and the family that puts up with him, was known by his
professional peers as the ``cartoonists' cartoonist,'' the museum
said. He died in June.
   The induction ceremony, scheduled for Sept. 22, will bring to 27

   Most 59-year-old women would be content to have
their doctor tell them they look good. But not Mitzi Gaynor.
   ``What do you mean good? Whatever happened to sensational? What's
the matter, you never heard the word magnificent before?''
   The exuberant entertainer was pronounced looking good by a doctor
who examined her before she left on a lengthy tour as star of the
Cole Porter musical ``Anything Goes.''
   She disagreed with the diagnosis after she peeked over his
shoulder and saw his report, she said in a recent interview.
   Miss Gaynor has appeared in 17 movies, including the film
versions of ``Anything Goes'' and ``South Pacific.'' But she says
her real breakthrough in the entertainment business occurred in the
1960s when she became one of the first women to do a one-person show
in Las Vegas.

   Actor Donald Sutherland, who plays a South African
teacher in the film ``A Dry White Season,'' said a movie with a
powerful anti-apartheid message may inflame enough people to take
action.
   ``South Africa is a country that does not care what people in the
rest of the world think,'' Sutherland said Monday at the Toronto
Festival of Festivals.
   ``A Dry White Season,'' which was favorably received by audiences
and critics in its world premiere at the festival, shows how a
once-passive Sutherland responds to a series of revolting events.
   Also in the film are Marlon Brando, who plays a human rights
attorney, and South African actor Zakes Mokae.
   The movie has graphic scenes of police violence and torture in
South Africa. Its producers say it was difficult to get the film
made because some studios shy away from making films with political

<HEAD>Royal Family Gets Pay Increase of 4.6 Percent, Below Inflation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II and her family got a pay
increase in Tuesday's annual budget of 4.6 percent, which was lower
than inflation but still means they will cost the taxpayers $10.6
million.
   The increase of 273,000 pounds ($466,800) brought the total to
6,195,300 pounds ($10,594,000), and was too much for some Labor
Party legislators whatever its relation to the cost of living.
   ``For the royal family, it looks as though Christmas has come
early,'' Labor member Max Madden said in the House of Commons.
   An increase of 4.6 percent for the Civil List, as the royal
allowances are known, compares with annual inflation of 7.5 percent,
up from 3.3 percent a year ago.
   Members of the royal family are paid for carrying out such
official duties as receiving ambassadors, presenting awards, opening
hospitals, visiting the armed forces and making foreign tours.
   Most of the money goes to salaries for the 350 royal household
staff, from private secretaries to coachmen, gardeners and window
cleaners at Buckingham Palace and the other royal residences.
   Queen Elizabeth, rich in in her own right, will receive 4.65
million pounds ($7.96 million) in the 1989-90 fiscal year, up from
4.55 million pounds.
   Her 88-year-old mother, Queen Mother Elizabeth, will get 404,000
pounds ($691,000), and Prince Philip, her husband, will be paid
225,300 pounds ($385,000).
   The queen's youngest son Prince Edward, 25, who quit the Royal
Marines and now works as a production assistant for a theater
company run by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, does not get a raise.
He has received 20,000 pounds ($34,200) a year since 1982.
   Prince Charles, heir to the throne, and his wife Diana are not on
the list because he is Prince of Wales and lives on income from the
Duchy of Cornwall estates. That amounted to 1.4 million pounds ($2.4
million) last year.
   The largest percentage raise was for the queen's second son,
Prince Andrew, Duke of York, a naval lieutenant on a destroyer. His
state allowance rises from 86,500 pounds ($148,000) to 155,400
pounds (nearly $266,000), or more than 79 percent. He also will get
21,000 pounds (nearly $36,000) in service pay plus allowances.
   Andrew has been accused of taking too much leave and not handling
enough royal duties to justify his allowance.
   Madden called the raise a ``monster increase'' that would ``amaze
and astonish'' most people, who he said would not find much benefit
for themselves in the budget.
   Andrew's raise will pay for his office at Buckingham Palace,
established in 1986 when he married Sarah Ferguson, now Duchess of
York. Their staff includes a private secretary, a full-time
lady-in-waiting, up to four clerks, a chauffeur and a dresser to
look after the duchess's clothes.
   Labor legislator Chris Mullin said the royal family should pay
tax on their state grants and claimed the queen could afford it
because she is ``one of the richest people in the world.''
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, said
she pays the equivalent of 80 percent tax on the income from her
estates and invested wealth, double the top rate of her richest
subjects.
   ``The queen is the most heavily taxed person in Britain,'' he
said, and estimated royal revenues at 50 million pounds ($85.5
million) a year, of which the queen would retain 10 million pounds
($17.1 million).
   ``That is the same as being taxed at 80 percent,'' Brooks-Baker
said.
   In the time of King George III in the 18th century, he said,
monarchs found they could not live on their income and agreed to
surrender all revenues in return for the Civil List, a sum
Parliament deemed sufficient for their needs.
   Each monarch since has opted for the Civil List at the start of a
new reign, but because today's royal revenues are much greater than
before, the queen has been allowed to keep a portion, Brooks-Baker
said.

<TEXT>
   The Princess of York, newborn daughter of the Duke
and Duchess of York, is fifth in line the British throne now
occupied by her grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II.
   The baby girl born Monday night is far enough away from the
ancient seat not to have to train seriously for it as her Uncle
Charles, the first in line, did.
   Charles' 6-year-old son, Prince William of Wales, is destined to
be king after his father and will no doubt have to study for the
role more diligently than younger brother Prince Harry, almost 4,
the third in line.
   The baby's father, 28-year-old Prince Andrew, the Duke of York
and second son of the queen, is fourth in line as long as Charles
and his wife, Diana, have no other children to push Andrew further
down the list.
   The baby princess is officially Her Royal Highness Princess of
York.
   Her place in the line will change if her parents have a son, who
would be placed ahead of her, or if the Prince and Princess of
Wales have a daughter or another son.
   The new York baby pushes Prince Edward, 24, the queen's third
son, back to sixth place, and 37-year-old Anne _ her only daughter
and second-eldest child, back to seventh place.
   Anne's children _ Peter Phillips, 10, and Zara Phillips, 7 _ are
eighth and ninth in line. They are not a prince and princess, nor
are they designated royal highnesses, because Anne's husband,
equestrian champion Mark Phillips, has no royal title.
   The queen's 57-year-old sister, Princess Margaret, the Countess
of Snowdon, is 10th in line followed by her children, Viscount
Linley, 26, and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones, 24, in 11th and 12th
place.
   The order of succession then shifts to the queen's cousins: the
Duke of Gloucester and his three children, the Duke of Kent and two
of his three children, and the two children of his brother Prince
Michael of Kent, who lost his own place by marrying a Roman
Catholic. The Duke of Kent's eldest son also lost his place in the
line of succession because he married a Catholic.
   The Kent brothers' sister, Princess Alexandra and her two
children are next.

   Prince William, 7-year-old son of heir-to-the
throne Prince Charles, will go to boarding school next year,
Buckingham Palace said.
   William is to attend Ludgrove School in Berkshire county, 10
miles from the Windsor Castle country home of his grandmother,
Queen Elizabeth II, and 35 miles from his parents' London home at
Kensington Palace.
   William, who will be 8 by the time he starts at Ludgrove, has
been attending Wetherby School in London.
   The choice of the 186-student school is a break with family
tradition. Charles attended Cheam Preparatory School, as did his
father, Prince Philip.
   Buckingham Palace announced Friday that Ludgrove had been the
``joint parental choice'' of Charles and his wife, Diana.
   Another royal offspring, 15-month-old Princess Beatrice, took
her first trip abroad, Buckingham Palace announced Saturday.
   Her mother, Sarah, the Duchess of York, slipped quietly out of
the country for a private vacation in Australia with her elder
sister, Jane. The Duke of York, Prince Andrew, is taking a
refresher course in England as a Royal Navy helicopter pilot.

   Princess Beatrice, the month-old daughter of the

   Beatrice, who is fifth in line to the throne and the fifth
grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, will stay at home during the
Sept. 28 to Oct. 7 visit.
   ``She'll certainly be remaining behind with her nanny,'' said a
palace spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity. Asked why,
she said, ``It's the decision of the duchess.''
   Princess Beatrice was born Aug. 8.
   The Duchess of York, formerly Sarah Ferguson, will fly to

<DATELINE>KLOSTERS, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Charles escaped an avalanche
while skiing today, but the snowslide killed one of his friends and
injured another.
   Buckingham Palace identified the dead man as Maj. Hugh Lindsay,
a former equerry, or aide, to Charles's mother, Queen Elizabeth II.
A woman in the party, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson, suffered leg
injuries, the palace said.
   The palace said Charles was not injured. But witnesses said the
prince looked distraught, and one said he was weeping and shaking
as a helicopter arrived to pick him up.
   Charles' wife, Diana, and Sarah Ferguson, his pregnant
sister-in-law, were not on the slopes at the time, the palace said.
   Swiss authorities said the snowslide on Mt. Gotschnagrat near
Klosters began about 300 feet above a group of six skiers that
included Prince Charles. The prince and three other people were
unharmed.
   The palace said the party was skiing off the main ski run and
was stationary when the avalanche began at 2:45 p.m.
   ``All members of the party were in a position to take avoiding
action with the exception of Maj. Lindsay and Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson, who were both caught in the avalanche,'' it said.
   Lindsay, 34, was a serving army major and a friend of Charles
and Diana. He was married to a Buckingham Palace press secretary
who was expecting a baby, the palace said.
   Peter Balsiger, editor-in-chief of the Zurich-based newspaper
Blick, was quoted as saying he was told Charles, 39, helped dig one
person out of the snow.
   The palace statement said a Swiss guide and members of the royal
party helped dig the victims free. It did not say whether Charles
was among the diggers.
   A French photographer told BBC radio he saw Charles being
comforted by someone as a helicopter took off with a stretcher.
   BBC TV news said the queen was understood to have spoken to the
family at the chalet where they gathered after the tragedy.
   The 1988 Good Ski Guide describes the run where the accident
occurred as ``a slope of awesome steepness, dropping about 500
meters (yards).''
   Prince Charles skied the area many times during his bachelor
days and is credited with giving Klosters its exclusive tag.
   The guide says: ``Prince Charles is no doubt pleased to have put
(it) behind him; mercifully it is rarely open.''
   ``They (avalanches) are extremely difficult to predict. That is
what makes them so dangerous,'' said Peter Cliff, an Alpine guide
and leader of the Cairngorm mountain rescue team in Scotland.
   The most common is the snow-slab avalanche, when snow driven by
wind creates a crusted surface, underlaid with air pockets, and is
liable to fracture across the entire width of a slope.
   Without warning, massive slides can be set off by temperature
increases, new falls of snow or skiers and climbers.
   The royals arrived in Switzerland on Tuesday.
   Charles, Diana and the Duchess of York, who is married to
Charles' younger brother Prince Andrew, posed for photographers at
Klosters on Wednesday for photographers. The 28-year-old duchess,
the former Sarah Ferguson, is expecting her first baby in August.

   The Duke and Duchess of York spent a jovial
day among the arts and artists, joking with conductor Andre Previn
following a concert by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and
laughing with artist David Hockney.
   Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, spent Wednesday evening at
the Music Center listening to the two-hour concert that included a
work by their countryman, Ralph Vaughan Williams.
   The duke and duchess, both 28, were scheduled to visit the
aircraft carrier USS Nimitz today, the seventh day of their 10-day
visit as patrons of the UK@LA '88 arts festival.
   The nuclear-powered aircraft carrier sailed from San Diego at 7
a.m. for the noon rendezvous.
   The Navy planned a fly-by of A-7 jets breaking the sound
barrier, demonstrations of catapault launches and recovery of
aircraft and a lunch that included asparagus soup, marinated
mushrooms, chicken salad and cherries jubilee.
   The prince, who is a Royal Navy officer and helicopter pilot who
saw action in Britain's Falkland Islands war, was to be catapaulted
from the carrier's deck aboard an S-3A Viking anti-submarine
warfare jet.
   On Wednesday, the duchess, who is expecting her first child in
August, was given a bouquet of lavendar roses sporting a white
stork and balloon that read ``Special Delivery'' when she arrived
for the concert.
   Sarah wore a calf-length jade-green gown, contrasting with her
red hair pulled to the side with a flower hair ornament.
   Afterward, the royal couple chatted with Previn and his wife,
Heather. The conversation ended in laughter, as they joked about
the fierce facial expressions conductors sometimes wear.
   So far, the couple known popularly as Andy and Fergie have
hobnobbed with Hollywood celebrities and local business and
political leaders and taken a backstage look at a movie
special-effects studio.
   Earlier in the day, Andrew greeted American investors for a
five-hour cruise aboard Her Majesty's Yacht Britannia by quipping,
``Please don't sink her when you go to sea. Bon Voyage.''
   Andrew also expressed his appreciation for Wednesday's sunny
skies, which followed days of rain during their visit.
   ``We thank you for the weather, for as you know, when the queen
and the royal family comes to pay a visit the weather gets
dreadful,'' Andrew said.
   To the delight of Americans, the duchess dropped her regal
composure a few hours later outside the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art.
   ``Check these out!'' she called out, flouncing about to show the
crowds her hair tied in a loose ponytail and held by clips shaped
like the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes.
   Sarah wore a purple knee-length skirt and matching blazer with
tan shoes to Wednesday's museum visit. The prince wore a gray suit,
pale green shirt and dark green tie.
   At the museum, Hockney met them beneath two of his works, the
giant paintings ``Les Mamille,'' a depiction of a harbor done for
an opera set, and ``A Walk Around the Courtyard, Acatlan.''
   Hockney and museum officials led the couple through the
retrospective show, which includes 150 paintings, 60 drawings and
30 photographs.

   Newspapers clamored today for Prince Charles and
other royals to abandon dangerous pursuits after the 39-year-old
heir to the British throne narrowly escaped an avalanche that
killed a close friend.
   ``Charles is the next king .... That means he must be ...
safeguarded, if need be from himself,'' the Daily Mirror admonished
in an editorial.
   It said Charles as well as Prince Andrew and his wife, the
Duchess of York, took ``unnecessary risks.''
   ``The royals have a duty to play it safe,'' the newspaper added.
   Charles' 28-year-old brother, Andrew, was catapaulted off the
deck of the U.S. carrier Nimitz in a jet fighter when he and the
28-year-old duchess visited the United States last week.
   The duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, is expecting the
couple's first child in August. She was on a skiing holiday with
Charles and his wife, Princess Diana, 26, and friends at Klosters
in the Swiss Alps when the avalanche occurred Thursday. All are
good skiers.
   Sarah, who fell skiing earlier Thursday and was advised to rest,
was with Diana in a chalet when the avalanche struck.
   Andrew, a Royal Navy helicopter co-pilot in the 1982 Falklands
War and now a helicopter instructor, missed the holiday because of
duties at Portland naval based in southwest England.
   The avalanche killed Maj. Hugh Lindsay, 34, and injured another
friend of the royals, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson.
   Charles, the lead skier, and the rest of his party managed to
evade the avalanche. He helped rescue the unconscious Mrs.
Palmer-Tomkinson, both of whose legs were broken, and then helped
free Lindsay's body from under the snow.
   Another tabloid, The Sun, demanded: ``Why was he there?''
   ``Daredevil Charles has a passion for pushing himself to the
limit on the snow. Each time he dons his skis he likes to shake off
his tag of pampered prince and prove he is a real man ... Charles
has consistently risked his life by going on increasingly deadly
slopes,'' The Sun said.
   Swiss authorities had warned that the area where the royal party
was skiing was prone to avalanches.
   The Sun quoted Alex Broggi, a Klosters ski club owner, as
calling Charles ``incredibly brave.'' Broggi added, ``Many locals
are amazed by the runs he attempts. They wouldn't go anywhere near
them.''
   The Star said in an editorial: ``We don't want our royals to be
wimps ... But advisers who should know better must never again lead
the heir to the throne into such deadly danger.''
   The royals and many of their friends have a pronounced taste for
danger and Charles once asserted: ``If you occasionally live
dangerously it helps you appreciate life.''
   The Daily Mail said: ``The question asked by well-wishers of the
royal family is: Why do so many of them go in for such perilous
sports?'' It urged Queen Elizabeth II to ``ask your offspring, for
the nation's sake, to show just a little more care.''
   Charles' other sports include polo and fox hunting. He has
injured himself several times in falls from his horse at polo.
   His father, Prince Philip, 66, played polo until recently while
the 61-year-old queen is an accomplished horsewoman.
   Princess Anne, 37, the queen's only daughter, goes fox hunting
and occasionally rides in horse races, where accidents are numerous.

<HL> U.S. Grocer Stages Supermarket Coup With Royal Couple --- Andy and Fergie Will Tout U.K. Foods on U.S. Tour, Smiling, Saying 'Cheese' </HL>

   The Duke and Duchess of York are no strangers to American supermarkets, appearing regularly in the tabloids. 
Next week, however, they'll be appearing live at a California grocery store, touting British comestibles. 

   On Feb. 29, Prince Andrew and his wife, Sarah, will take a half-hour tour of Vons Cos.' 
Pavilions supermarket here as part of a promotional effort by Food From Britain, a U.K. government-sponsored group that works with retailers in the U.S. to boost American consumption of British foods, from soups to cheeses. 

   By featuring U.K. products in Vons' stores during the royal Couple's 10-day visit to Los Angeles later this month, Food From Britain hopes Americans will discover "that British food isn't dull and drab and ghastly and horrible," says Patricia Matthews, a spokeswoman for the group. 

   In 1986, British foods made up just under 3% of the total $665 million of foods and beverages imported in the U.S. 

   Last year, Food From Britain arranged promotions at 29 retail chains covering 1,200 stores. 
The promotions have meant annual increases in export volume of as much as 15% for some British producers, says Anthony Matthews, president of Food From Britain and husband of Mrs. Matthews, the group's spokeswoman. 

   Members of the royal Family have toured U.S. department stores before to promote British goods. 
But getting Andy and Fergie (as the couple are often called in the tabloids) to visit Vons Pavilions is a grocery-industry coup. 

   But it won't be the last such promotion. 
From here, the British food promoters move on to Buffalo, Detroit and Memphis. 
Then, in September, they'll be at Waldbaum and Food Emporium in New York -- this time without the royals. 

   Vons has been moving to capture the No. 1 spot among Southern California supermarket chains, aiming to grow through acquisitions and aggressive marketing. 

   Mr. Matthews says Food From Britain selected Vons because it was impressed with the company's marketing strategies and the diversity of its stores. 
Mr. Matthews also had worked with Bill Hyde, Vons' vice president, specialty food products, when Mr. Hyde was merchandising director for Bloomingdale's in New York. 

   During the Royal visit, Vons will push products like Coleman's English mustard, Schweppes seltzers and tonics, Keeler marmalade and Baxters soups. 

   The supermarket chain also will add some British flavor to its menu of prepared foods, with Cornish Pasties, a type of pastry; Stilton quiche and Cheshire cheddar cheese tarts. 

   Elizabeth Page, Vons executive chef, has been working up recipes for the prepared foods since December, but she confides that her chefs have found some of them hard to swallow. 
"They kept asking me to take the kidney out of the steak and kidney pie," she says.

   Budgie the helicopter was nowhere to be seen
Tuesday during the Duchess of York's visit to a children's museum.
   Indeed, the former Sarah Ferguson didn't even mention her books
``Budgie the Little Helicopter'' and ``Budgie at Bendick's Point,''
children's tales of a helicopter that has adventures and doesn't
like to bathe.
   When the British duchess known as ``Fergie'' led a group of
schoolchildren to a table laden with books by her publisher, Simon
and Schuster, there was no sign of Budgie.
   The meeting between the duchess and youngsters at the Children's
Museum of Manhattan was organized by Reading is Fundamental, a
program that encourages children to read books.
   Asked why her books weren't among those being handed out to
children, the duchess just smiled.
   ``It wasn't an event to promote the Budgie books,'' said Ken
Geist of Simon and Schuster.
   To showcase Budgie ``would have been too obvious,'' said Francis
Corniche, a spokesman for the British Embassy.
   The duchess, who is married to Prince Andrew, has said she got
the idea for the Budgie character while taking helicopter lessons.
Andrew is a helicopter pilot in the Royal Navy.

   Actor Tom Cruise says working with veteran actors
such as Paul Newman and Dustin Hoffman is a learning experience.
   ``What you get from great actors like Newman and Hoffman is where
to focus your energies and what to worry about and what not to worry
about,'' Cruise said. ``Because as a young actor, you're worried
about everything.''
   Cruise, 26, starred with Newman in ``The Color of Money,'' and
with Hoffman in the to-be-released ``Rain Man.''
   In ``Rain Man,'' the 51-year-old Hoffman plays an autistic man
with remarkable powers of memory and a $3 million inheritance.
Cruise plays his brother, who wants the money.
   Hoffman, known as a hard-working perfectionist on a movie set,
says Cruise is equally driven.
   ``He's a demon. He gets up early, he works out, he goes home
early, he studies, he works out again at night. ... And he always
wanted to rehearse,'' Hoffman said in December's Gentlemen's
Quarterly.

   A judge dismissed Jackie Mason's libel suit
against a Florida woman who filed a paternity suit against the
comedian.
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan threw out Mason's lawsuit Monday
for lack of personal jurisdiction.
   Mason last year sued Ginger Reiter and her mother, Miriam Oliver,
alleging libel, invasion of privacy, copyright infringement and
unjust enrichment, over a live stage production ``Oh Jackie Oh,'' on
which they collaborated.
   Ms. Reiter's paternity lawsuit in Florida is pending.
   Mason's attorney, Jay D. Kramer, declined comment on Monday's
ruling, saying he had not yet seen it.
   There was no answer at the Port Washington offices of Ms.
Reiter's lawyers when called for comment Monday evening.

   Tahnee Welch says it was difficult growing up as
the child of a sex symbol, but she doesn't fault her mother, Raquel.
   ``She's a hard worker. She's always taken care of herself. My
mother has never, never, never been supported by anyone,'' the
26-year-old Welch said. ``So I had it in my mind that I had to do it
myself. I have this pride.''
   The younger Welch insists she won her part in the 1985 film,
``Cocoon,'' on merit, not because of her mother. Welch also appears
in the recently released ``Cocoon: The Return.''
   ``They said I never paid my dues,'' Welch said in an interview in
December's Gentlemen's Quarterly. ``It's like what I was doing
didn't count. Like I cheated. But the point is not the advantages I
had but what I'm doing with them.''

   The Duke and Duchess of York picked the historic
Chapel Royal in London's St. James Palace for the Dec. 20
christening of their infant daughter, Princess Beatrice.
   The chapel was the site of the wedding of Queen Victoria and
Prince Albert in 1840 and where royal christenings occasionally have
taken place.
   Princess Beatrice Elizabeth Mary, fifth in line to the throne and
the fifth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II, will wear the royal
family's christening robe of Honiton lace and will be baptized at
the silver gilt Lily Font, Buckingham Palace said Monday.
   Princess Beatrice, born Aug. 8, is the first child of Prince
Andrew, the queen's second son, and the former Sarah Ferguson.
   The royal couple chose John Habgood, the archbishop of York and
second-ranking prelate in the Church of England, to christen their
daughter.

   Doubleday has acquired the English publishing
rights to 14 books by Naguib Mahfouz, the Egyptian writer who won
the 1988 Nobel Prize in literature, and to a book on architecture by
Britain's Prince Charles.
   Jacqueline Onassis, a Doubleday editor, and Alberto Vitale,
president and chief executive officer of the Bantam Doubleday Dell
Publishing Group, who lived in Egypt for many years, acquired the
rights to Mahfouz's works from The American University in Cairo
Press, the publishing house said.
   It was not immediately known how much Doubleday paid to acquire
the English rights to the works by Mahfouz and Prince Charles. The
publishing house could not be reached after office hours Monday for
comment.
   Doubleday said last week that the company will publish 14 books
by the 77-year-old Mahfouz, the first writer in the Arabic language
to win the Nobel Prize in literature.
   It will publish a collection of his short stories and 13 of his
novels, four of which have never been published in English.
   Charles' book, ``A Vision of Britain: A Personal View of
Architecture,'' is based on his recent television documentary, which
sharply criticized modern architecture in Britain. The British
publishing rights were acquired by Doubleday U.K., a division of
Transworld Publishers Ltd. London.

   Prince Charles today said he and
others in his party knew the risks of skiing off marked trails
before an avalanche killed a companion and injured another in a
``whirling maelstrom.''
   In a statement read to reporters shortly before the royal party
flew from Zurich airport to London, Prince Charles said:
   ``I would like to emphazise that all members of my party,
including myself, were skiing off the piste (trail) at our own risk
and we all accepted ... that the mountains have to be treated with
the greatest respect and not treated lightly.''
   The handwritten statement, read by a press spokesman, also
described Thursday's tragedy in the mountains near the alpine
resort of Klosters.
   The snow slide missed the prince but killed a close friend, army
Maj. Hugh Lindsay, 34. Another friend, Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson,
was knocked unconscious and suffered fractures of both legs.
   ``When the avalanche started, with a trememdous roaring, Bruno
Sprechter (a guide), Charles Palmer-Tomkinson, the Swiss policeman
and myself all managed by a great good fortune to ski to one side.
   ``To my horror, Maj. Hugh Lindsay and Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson just
failed to ski clear and were swept away in a whirling maelstrom as
the whole mountainside seemed to hurtle past us to the valley
below,'' the prince said.
   ``It was all over in a terrifying matter of seconds,'' the
prince said.
   Charles, his wife, Diana, and sister-in-law, the Duchess of
York, landed at Northolt, a Royal Air Force base 11 miles west of
London, this afternoon aboard a Queen's Flight aircraft after a
1{-hour from Zurich. The plane carried Lindsay's coffin.
   Lindsay's pregnant widow, Sarah, was at Northolt when the royal
party, wearing black, arrived. The 34-year-old press officer at
Buckingham Palace watched from a VIP lounge as eight officers from
her husband's Royal Lancers regiment carried the coffin from the
aircraft.
   She is expecting her first baby in May.
   Earlier today, a doctor said Charles' quick rescue efforts
helped save the life of Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson, who was buried under
the snowslide with Lindsay.
   Elsa Rauch, a doctor who was flown to the scene, said Charles
and others dug out Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson.
   ``They were so fast that they dug her out in a few minutes and I
would say they saved her life,'' she told the BBC. ``He (Charles)
helped to dig her out with his own hands. He was very controlled.
He talked to the lady.''
   Witnesses said Charles was distraught, in tears and trembling
when a helicopter came to take him away from the scene.
   British newspapers clamored today for Charles and other royals
to abandon dangerous pursuits.
   ``Charles is the next king. ... That means he must be ...
safeguarded, if need be from himself,'' the Daily Mirror admonished
in an editorial.
   The loose snow cascaded down as Charles, 39, and five companions
were skiing at about 5,800 feet in an area that was off the main
skiing trails. Authorities earlier in the day had warned it was
prone to avalanches.
   Diana and the duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, were safe in a
chalet when the avalanche struck. Sarah is married to Charles'
younger brother, Prince Andrew, and is expecting the couple's first
child in August.
   Mrs. Palmer-Tomkinson regained consciousness after
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on the scene. A helicopter took her to
Davos, where she underwent surgery for multiple fractures of both
legs and was reported in satisfactory condition this morning in a
hospital intensive care unit.
   It was the royal family's worst accident since Prince William of
Gloucester, a cousin of the Queen, died when his sports plane
crashed during an air race in 1972.
   Lindsay, a former aide of the queen, was a close friend of
Charles and Diana, who attended his high-society wedding last July.
He frequently accompanied the royal couple on the annual ski
holiday.
   The Palmer-Tomkinsons also vacation with Charles and Diana
annually at Klosters.

   Sarah, the Duchess of York, better known
as ``Fergie,'' has received a scolding from a suburban Chicago
dermatologist who contends her visits to a tanning parlor set a bad
example.
   The former Sarah Ferguson who is married to Britain's Prince
Andrew is especially prone to sun damage because of her fair
complexion and Celtic ancestry, said Dr. Michael Greenberg.
   Greenberg said he wrote to the duchess after reading in People
magazine about her tanning parlor visits.
   ``I am astounded that an intelligent woman such as yourself
would, first consent to tan her skin considering the increase in
skin cancer caused by ultraviolet (rays) and, second, let yourself
be an example for the millions of ordinary, gullible women who
follow whatever a member of the royal family does as though it were
gospel,'' Greenberg wrote.
   The duchess and her husband, both 28, are on a 10-day visit to
California. They are expecting their first child in August.
   ``I think she would be grateful for his concern,'' said Francis
Cornish, a spokesman for the British Consulate in Los Angeles,
which delivered the letter Tuesday to the duchess' private
secretary.
   The duchess and her husband plan to leave Los Angeles on Friday
for a two-day stay in the desert resort Palm Springs, Calif.,
before heading back to Britain, Cornish said.
