FT  21 NOV 92 / Art works threatened as blaze sweeps through Windsor Castle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUEEN and the Duke of York helped save hundreds of art treasures
yesterday as flames engulfed Windsor Castle.
Hundreds of firefighters battled into the night with a blaze in the castle
that houses one of the greatest privately-owned art collections.
The Queen went to Windsor from Buckingham Palace when told of the fire by
the Duke. He was carrying out research work at the castle as flames were
discovered in a private chapel near what is known as the Equerry's entrance.
The Duke said: 'Her Majesty is absolutely devastated. She is inside the
building, helping to take stuff out - works of art and other things - as a
precaution.'
He added that the fire was already 'a great deal worse' than the Pounds 10m
Hampton Court blaze six years ago.
The Prince of Wales last night spent about an hour inspecting the damage.
Fire incident commander David Harper said last night he was satisfied the
blaze was now under control.
'At certain times it seemed worse than it was. That is because the fire
voided itself through the roof and that was a deliberate ploy by ourselves
to let gases escape.'
The fire started shortly before midday in the basement of the Brunswick
Tower overlooking Windsor Great Park and swept through the north-east wing.
It spread rapidly to St George's Hall where many of the Queen's most
valuable paintings are hung below the vaulted wooden roof.
More than 200 firefighters from four counties struggled to control the blaze
but after nearly four hours the flames burst through the roof of Brunswick
Tower.
Many of the most valuable art works were saved by teams of firemen, soldiers
and castle employees, but the final cost of lost pictures and other
valuables, and of damage to the castle structure, will be considerable.
Buckingham Palace said first assessments were that 'only a handful' of works
of art had been lost. 'It is certainly too early to say how much damage has
been done, but we can say a great deal has been saved.'
Sir Roy Strong, former director of the Victoria and Albert museum, said the
Queen had one the of the world's greatest art collections, much of it held
at Windsor.
In common with most government buildings, royal palaces are not insured
because premiums would be too high. The repair bill will probably be the
responsibility of Mr Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary.
The heritage department said: 'We are responsible for financing the repair
and maintenance of occupied royal palaces. If it turns out there is a
significant repair bill the royal household will come to us and we will be
expected to pay it.'
The fire broke out in an area of the castle closed for a Pounds 2m
renovation, including rewiring.
Windsor Castle, founded by William the Conqueror, ranks sixth among historic
properties as a tourist attraction, with 630,000 visitors last year.

FT  08 SEP 94 / MPs demand closer scrutiny of royal spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Senior officers of the royal household responsible for the Pounds 20m of
taxpayers' money spent each year on Buckingham Palace and other residences
occupied by the Queen and her family face closer scrutiny by MPs.
A report by the Commons public accounts committee published yesterday
rejects voluntary arrangements under which information about the use of the
money is made available.
It calls for 'public visibility' of the Pounds 20m a year of public money
involved, with the National Audit Office having an automatic right of access
to the relevant documents.
The committee recommends that the royal household should be required to
publish an annual report and accounts, instead of merely having to submit
them to the Department of National Heritage.
It concludes that there is 'no objection to placing the officials of the
royal household under comparable systems of scrutiny and control to public
servants when dealing with public money'.
Apart from Buckingham Palace the Pounds 20m is used in connection with
Kensington Palace, St James's Palace, Clarence House and Marlborough House
Mews, Windsor Castle, Windsor Great and Home parks, and Hampton Court Mews
and Paddock.
Members of the committee were critical of the arrangements for administering
the net income from public admissions to Buckingham Palace and Windsor
Castle - expected to amount to Pounds 25m in the next four years.
The money, which will go towards the cost of restoring the parts of Windsor
Castle severely damaged by fire in 1992, is administered by Royal Collection
Enterprises.
Mr Michael Peat, director of finance and property services in the royal
household, denied having censured Mr Robert Sheldon, the former Labour
minister and chairman of the committee, for wanting to study the accounts.
Mr Peat likened the decision of Royal Collection Enterprises to give money
towards the restoration of Windsor Castle to a charitable donation.

<HEAD>Tower Of Windsor Castle Damaged By Shifting Foundations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDSOR, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 800-year-old Round Tower at Windsor
Castle, one of Queen Elizabeth II's homes, has been damaged by
shifting foundations, the Department of the Environment said today.
   The castle overlooking the River Thames is reportedly the
queen's favorite home and is one of Britain's top tourist
attractions. The monarch's royal standard is flown from the tower
when she is in residence.
   ``There has been a slight movement to the Round Tower at Windsor
Castle. We are looking into it,'' the government department said in
a brief statement.
   The statement added that the cause was not known and gave no
details about the extent of the damage.
   The Daily Telegraph, which first broke the story, described the
damage to the five-story tower as serious following a shift in its
ancient foundations.
   The London newspaper said the tower moved two weeks ago,
bringing down plaster, causing cracks to appear in the stonework
and jamming a door and two windows.
   It said the queen had inspected the tower. Buckingham Palace
said in a statement: ``The queen is obviously concerned and is
being kept informed.''
   The queen and her husband, Prince Philip, live for much of the
year at Buckingham Palace in London but they and their family spend
each Christmas at Windsor Castle. Windsor is 21 miles west of
London.
   The Round Tower is the most imposing feature of the castle. The
foundations of the tower and the rest of its lower part were built
by King Henry II in 1172. The upper part was added 6{ centuries
later in the reign of King George IV.
   The Round Tower is built on a mound thrown up by the Saxons, the
Teutonic invaders who conquered Britain between the 5th and 7th
centuries. They ruled until their army under King Harold was beaten
at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 by Duke William of Normandy, who
then became King William I of England.
   The original castle was built by King William around 1070.

<TEXT>
WINDSOR CASTLE is the largest inhabited castle in the world and has been the
sovereign's official residence for more than 800 years.
The original castle at Windsor, a fortified earthwork surrounded by a dry
ditch, was built by William the Conqueror in about 1070 as one of a chain of
strongholds to control the area around London.
It was rebuilt and enlarged over the centuries, although the outline still
follows the shape of the original earthwork.
In 1215 King John rode reluctantly from the castle to nearby Runnymede to
set his seal on the Magna Carta.
Earlier, Henry I was the first monarch to make it a royal house when in 1121
he married his second wife Adelaide of Louvain in a chapel in the castle.
Their new home was little more than a cold and draughty timbered hall.
Each monarch in turn strengthened and added to the castle. The lower wall of
the dominant Round Tower dates back to Henry II, who reigned from 1154-89.
Two kings were born in the castle: Edward III (1327-77), and the gentle and
pious Henry Vl (1422-61), who founded Eton College. His body lies in the
castle's St George's Chapel.
Henry VIII (1509-47) made additions to St George's Chapel and his daughter,
Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603), built a gallery which is now part of the
Royal Library.
Work on the inside of the castle was carried out by Sir Christopher Wren on
the command on Charles II (1660-85), although he was not often resident
there.
George III - 'Farmer George', who was king for 60 years from 1760 - loved
the whole of the Thames valley, and since then Windsor's popularity has
never wavered. Queen Victoria (1837-1901) loved the castle more and more as
she grew older.
The state apartments are open to the public when the Queen is not in
residence and visitors can view a collection of paintings by Holbein,
Rembrandt, Vermeer, Rubens, Van Dyck and Canaletto, as well as important
collections of furniture, porcelain and tapestries. Also on display are
drawings by old masters, including Leonardo da Vinci.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Brooke defends pledge of cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Peter Brooke, national heritage secretary, strongly defended the decision
to use taxpayers' money to meet the multi-million-pound bill for repairing
fire damaged Windsor castle in the Commons yesterday.
He stressed: 'Windsor Castle is the property of the state, and it is the
government's responsibility to ensure that resources are provided to
maintain it in a manner commensurate with its status, and its role on
occasions of state'.
Ms Ann Clwyd, the shadow heritage secretary, said there was 'legitimate
public concern that the total cost of repair should not be paid exclusively
by the taxpayer'.
In more aggressive tones, and to cheers from some of his Labour colleagues,
Mr Bill Michie, MP for the Heeley division of Sheffield, contrasted the
government's readiness to find up to Pounds 60m to meet the cost of
repairing Windsor Castle with its attitude to the homeless sleeping in
'cardboard cities'.
Mr Brooke refused to 'lend credence' to the Pounds 60m figure in advance of
properly prepared estimates, but acknowledged that whatever the total
finally proved to be it was unlikely to be 'absorbable' within his
department's budget.
He envisaged that the cost would be spread over a number of years, and that
he would be involved in negotiations with Mr Michael Portillo, the chief
secretary to the Treasury.
Mr Brooke joined with Sir Anthony Grant (C Cambridgeshire South West) in
condemning the attitude of Labour critics of the cost as 'mean and
Pecksniffian'.
Mr Alex Salmond (SNP Banff and Buchan) argued that if the taxpayer had to
meet the bill it strengthened the case for requiring the Royal family to pay
taxes in the same way as everyone else.
Mr Brooke answered that taxation was a matter for Mr Normam Lamont, the
chancellor of the exchequer.
The minister emphasised that responsibility for the fabric of Windsor Castle
had rested with the government since 1831, while the contents, including the
royal collection, were the responsibility of the Queen.
Meanwhile, local fire chiefs said the cause of the fire was not yet known,
despite claims it had been started by a halogen lamp igniting inflammable
fluid.
Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'The brigade does not yet know
what the cause is. The investigation is continuing.'
The halogen lamp theory has puzzled some picture experts, who claim that if
only the most basic safety rules were being followed, there should have been
no prospect of the fire beginning in such a way.
Other possible causes being investigated include an electrical fault - the
part of the castle where the fire started was being rewired - a discarded
cigarette, or hot bitumen dropped on the chapel roof.

FT  30 NOV 92 / Arts: A foolish plan to reinvent Windsor - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Watching the flames at Windsor was a numbing experience and only the gradual
passage of time has put the disaster into some perspective. The losses are,
in architectural terms, immense. The stroke of luck, if one can call it
that, was that important works of art had been moved from some of the rooms
in preparation for the next stage of a comprehensive rewiring programme. Six
major rooms have been destroyed or badly damaged with roofs and ceilings
suffering the most.
The fire began in the private chapel, a relatively modest room that was
refurbished by Sir Hugh Casson in a wave of modernisation early in the
Queen's reign. Will this be the first room in Britain to be restored in the
Casson style? The Octagon Room, close to the chapel, was also damaged but
the serious losses are the enormous St. George's Hall, the Grand Reception
Room, the State Dining Room, and the Crimson Drawing Room. All these rooms
represent part of the complete transformation of the castle by King George
IV in the 1820s. There is no doubt that George IV, both as King and Prince
Regent, was the finest royal patron of the arts since King Charles I.
Windsor Castle was extensively altered by Charles II, but by the 19th
century it had become unsuitable for the residence of the sovereign of a
major world power. In 1824, the House of Commons granted the not
inconsiderable sum of Pounds 150,000 for improvements at Windsor. Sir
Charles Long, the King's principal artistic adviser, organised an
architectural competition. He invited three architects from the Office of
Works - Sir John Soane, Sir Robert Smirke and John Nash - to compete with
one outsider Jeffry Wyatt (who was to rename himself when he was knighted,
Sir Jeffry Wyatville). After long consultations with the King, Charles Long
produced a fascinating and extremely detailed brief. Wyatville followed the
brief very precisely and won the competition.
Wyatville's ambition at Windsor was to create in the Upper Ward a series of
State Apartments on the north side with a new grand entrance, the George IV
gateway, on the south side. An important part of the brief and of
Wyatville's plan was to improve and romanticise the castle's silhouette.
This included raising the height of the Round Tower by 33 feet to make it
the dominant element in the new group of battlemented and machicolated
towers. As an exercise in the picturesque, Wyatville and his patron achieved
a remarkable success; seen from the Great Park, or even from the M4
motorway, the castle makes one of Europe's most romantic skylines.
I am amazed that the Royal Institute of British Architects has reacted to
the fire at Windsor not with a scholarly and thoughtful response based on
historical knowledge, but with a Pavlovian reaction urging: 'an
architectural competition be held for the rebuilding of Windsor Castle. An
architectural competition would be a far more positive assertion of
tradition than the slavish recreation of Victorian pastiche. A contemporary
rebuilding could also provide an unrivalled opportunity to combine new state
rooms with acceptable modern galleries in which the Queen's art collection
could be put on permanent, and safe, public display. This really would be
worth every penny of the public money that the rebuilding will cost.' The
RIBA's statement goes on to urge the Queen to take advice from the president
of the Institute and Sir Hugh Casson.
Apart from the breathtaking ignorance that tries to suggest that good
Regency architecture is Victorian pastiche, I wonder whether any member of
the RIBA has recently been to Windsor or taken the slightest interest in
English artistic and architectural history. The facts are that the walls of
these important state rooms remain and there is sufficient plasterwork in
the Grand Reception Room, for example - one of the finest neo-Rococo
interiors in the world - for the only solution to be painstaking and
accurate restoration. There is plenty of archival evidence of how these
rooms looked and only a committee of historians and the finest conservation
architects can ensure that a decent job of restoration is carried out. I can
only suppose that the Institutional architects did not notice that most of
the furniture, tapestries and pictures that belonged in these rooms was
carefully rescued and is of a quality that deserves appropriate
reinstatement in properly restored rooms.
In Vienna last Friday another architectural loss was sustained when a part
of the Hofburg Imperial palace was badly damaged by fire. The main loss
seems to have been the great Redoutensaal built by the Empress Maria Theresa
and used for international conferences. The reaction of the Austrian
Chancellor Franz Vranitsky was the appropriate one. 'The whole area was
recently renovated and was one of the prominent jewels of our city. We'll
just have to renovate it again.'
The same sentiments should apply to Windsor Castle. There is an aesthetic
consistency in the Gothic progression of rooms from the Great Staircase
(later altered by Salvin) through the great vaulted Guard Chamber with its
military decoration and tributes to Marlborough, Wellington and Nelson to
St. George's Hall and the State Apartments. The dining room, and the vaulted
octagon room which serves as an ante-room in the Brunswick tower (both badly
damaged) continue the Gothic theme. Pugin's sideboard may have to be
replaced and the challenge will be to find craftsmen to recreate that sense
of Gothic chivalry and romance that is so important a part of the Windsor
style. No amount of prevarication about cost and stylistic treatment should
be allowed to cloud the fact that the only right course for Windsor Castle
is complete and accurate reconstruction.

<TEXT>
Last week two related events occurred that brought a bit of life to the
architectural world. One was that Country Life, the magazine with a
first-rate architectural editor in the shape of Mr Giles Worsley, announced
the results of its competition for the rebuilding of parts of Windsor Castle
damaged by fire.
The other was also related to Windsor Castle, the appearance of a book
Windsor, the Most Romantic Castle by Mark Girouard, which contains a chapter
devoted to new ideas for rebuilding the castle's burnt-out St George's Hall.
Both sets of ideas form the basis of an exhibition at the Architecture
Foundation in London, which it is hoped will then travel to all parts of the
kingdom.
When the smoke finally blew away from the charred ruins of the castle after
the fire last November, crowds of the curious and the impertinent came
forward with their views on what should be done. In fact, the damage was not
as bad as had been thought. Only the north-east corner of the Upper Ward was
affected. But it was a part of the castle that contains several important
rooms.
The fire began in the private chapel and attacked St George's Hall, the
Grand Reception Room, the Octagon Room in the Brunswick Tower, the Dining
Room, Crimson and Green Drawings Rooms and the Great Kitchen. It spread with
sickening speed through the roofs of these rooms, but, although it damaged
the walls, they are not beyond repair. By a stroke of good fortune, the
furnishings of these rooms had been removed for a rewiring programme and it
all survives.
The survival of almost all the furnishings and works of art from these rooms
would seem to make it sensible speedily to rebuild the castle exactly as it
was in before the fire.
But, naturally enough, there have been strange cries from architects calling
for contemporary contributions to the rebuilding. Mr Girouard's book and the
competition entries from Country Life are part of a campaign to promote a
debate which tries to relate the rebuilding of Windsor to the modernisation
of the monarchy as an institution.
Competitions should be judged by their results, not simply by their good
intentions. The 10 proposals for St George's Hall in the Girouard book come
not only from architects, but also stage and lighting designers. It is a
strange list that seems to demonstrate how difficult it is for architects
and designers to understand the purpose of state rooms, the role of history
and the functions of the monarchy. The implication is that Wyatt Ville's
work at Windsor was dull and there is little understanding of how the castle
works when it is filled with the colour and glitter of, for example, a state
banquet in St George's Hall or a procession of Knights of the Garter.
The sense of continuity is the essence of an hereditary monarchy and the
wish of so many of these designers to 'bring light colour and change' into
the castle may be almost as destructive as the intrusion of the media. There
should be an element of poetry about any scheme for what has been described
as 'the most romantic castle' and that is exactly what is missing from so
many of the laboured designs in both competitions.
The idea of leaving the Great Hall as a ruin, as proposed by Mr Rowan Moore,
does have a certain Gothic romance, but also opts out of the architectural
debate. More feasible is the plan by Roderick Gradidge to add a steeply
pitched roof to the hall and redecorate in a rich, almost Puginesque manner.
One entrant, Douglas Binnie, has combined his talents as an architect and a
sculptor in his elaborately iconographic schemes, and his Country Life entry
is one of the best presented.
Of the 10 Girouard schemes, only two are remotely workable. One is Richard
MacCormack's bronze and timber roof, inspired by but not imitative of the
original Gothic roof of St George's Hall; and the other is by Michael
Hopkins, who saw the decorative potential of the motif of the Garter Star.
There is, inevitably, a committee to discuss the restoration plans for the
castle. A decision is already made to rebuild the chapel area in a
contemporary way. This area, where the fire began, was a remodelling by Sir
Hugh Casson of the 1842 chapel by Edward Blore. Whether a private chapel is
needed at this point in the castle's history may be debatable.
The committee may decide to build a modern roof on St George's Hall and they
would be foolish to overlook the wonderful timber designs of the Hungarian
architect Imrie Macovecz. He designed one of the best pavilions ad Seville's
Expo 92 and his work is remarkably original.
The committee will have the benefit of the experience of the National Trust
who are currently rebuilding Uppark in Sussex after a disastrous fire. They
will also take advice from those responsible for the recent excellent
restoration of Hampton Court.
The real opportunity offered by Windsor is involve in the restoration the
expertise of those responsible for the Royal Collection who made such a
splendid job of the refurbishment of Frogmore in Windsor Great Park. With
the gentle help of one or two good architects, Windsor should be restored
very much as it was.
Mark Girouard's agreeable book tells us something of the story of life at
Windsor. But his selection of contemporary architects and winners of Country
Life competition demonstrate that the modern imagination cannot deal with
either the romance of the castle or the appropriate panoply for the home of
the head of state.

FT  23 NOV 92 / Windsor loss less than feared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS SMOKE and steam lingered yesterday over the ashes of what were once some
of the most stately of Windsor Castle's 1,000 rooms, it became clear that
the art treasures had been less damaged by Friday's fire than had previously
been feared.
Last night, Buckingham Palace and Department of National Heritage officials
agreed that the biggest task arising from the blaze, which raged through the
800-year-old castle for several hours, is the restoration of the building's
fabric.
Some of the worst-damaged rooms had been stripped of most contents as part
of a three-year renovation programme which had been under way for months.
Buckingham Palace said: 'With all the help available to us and with the
royal collection's own team of conservators available, we will be able to
restore pretty well all the items to their former condition. It is clearly a
long haul but we are confident of success.'
Only a handful of works of art have been lost, although they include Sir
William Beechey's portrait of George III.
Some calls, particularly from Labour MPs, were made yesterday for the Royal
Family to contribute to rebuilding costs, although the government has
already acknowledged its responsibility for maintaining the fabric of
Windsor and other royal residences.
Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary, is expected to make a
statement in the Commons today setting out when and how reconstruction will
start.
Other than the certainty of department officials that reconstruction will
cost 'tens of millions' of pounds, the eventual bill is still in the early
stages of being estimated. Various reports of Pounds 50m-Pounds 60m being
required were indicated by officials as little more than 'guesstimates'.
Reports of how the fire started, ranging from a workman's cigarette to a
welding torch, were also dismissed as speculative. A team of forensic
experts arrived yesterday to investigate the cause.
Senior officers of the Berkshire fire brigade also rejected reports that
cost-cutting measures by the royal household had reduced fire cover at the
castle and had been a factor in the fire's early spread.
Mr Maurice Doyle, divisional officer, said that while the fire had shown it
was necessary to improve salvage expertise, 'we work with the castle fire
service all the time'.
Establishing the precise losses and damage to art treasures, furniture and
artefacts is likely to take time because of the need to cross-check the
inventories of items previously removed for the renovation and those piled
on the lawns by a human chain that included the Duke of York.
Tourists were still being allowed into unaffected lower grounds of the
castle yesterday but it is unclear as yet how tourism will be affected.
The 200-ft-long St George's Hall is devastated and roofless. The Waterloo
Chamber, scene of state banquets, is ruined and both the Grand Reception
Room and the great corridor are badly damaged.
They were among the greatest attractions of the state apartments which,
according to the English Tourist Board, were visited by nearly 650,000
visitors last year.
The state apartments were already closed to the public for the winter when
the fire struck. But there is no doubt that the fire is seen by the Royal
Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead as another blow to tourism on which the
area is heavily dependent, and which has been battered by recession.

forward a personal view of the damage wreaked by the fire at the castle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The loss from the fire at Windsor castle has nothing to do with Heritage,
that now hateful, vulgar, sentimental word. Nor is it about the cost of
repairs, nor the loss of objects and artefacts, however wonderful. The loss
I feel as one who spent his boyhood in the shadow of that great tower is
harder to explain: an enormous, possibly irreparable, damage to the spirit
of the place and what it represents to Englishmen.
Samuel Pepys called Windsor: 'The most romantic castle that is in the
world'. It is also the largest inhabited castle in the world, and has been
in continuous habitation, since the time of the William the Conqueror. It
is, by any measure, extraordinary and wonderful.
Even as the flames swept through the great hall on Friday night, television
announcers were meanly asking how much it would all cost; and the row about
who will pay continues in Parliament and elsewhere. Good God: could they not
see that some 900 years of our common history has gone up in smoke. Yes, I
admit, I take the disaster personally. For those of us who lived in the
town, that familiar towering silhouette was always present, as constant as
Fuji-san is to a Japanese or the Eiffel Tower to a Parisian. I saw it from
my bedroom window, on my way to school, from the Great Park, from the forest
at Dedworth, or away across the Brocas and along the river from Boveney
Lock. There it would be, through the trees, around every corner.
But it would change, too, with every shift of the clouds and mood of the
weather. I remember it in the long damp week between the death of the King
and his funeral, so quiet and still, shrouded in the mists of early
February. Most of all I remember the funeral itself, we children standing at
the top of the Long Walk inside the Park gates, the crunch of wheels and
feet on the gravel, the shadowy, veiled figures in the closed coach, the
bands, the shouted orders coming towards us through the mist, past us and
away, the minute guns, boom, boom, in the Park: and all the while the white
looming walls of the Castle just barely visible through the fog.
I would often go into the Castle, a marvellously safe place for a schoolboy
to be when he shouldn't be, with nothing better to do than slope off for a
smoke and to admire the view. I would go up the Round Tower, or pay my
sixpence to go into the Curfew Tower with its clock and dungeons, or
perhaps, late in the afternoon, slip into St George's to hear sung Evensong.
One special game, at the height of the tourist season, was to go out along
the North Terrace, just where the fire has destroyed St George's Hall, to
where one long queue was waiting to go into the State Apartments, and
another, even longer, was waiting to see The Queen's Dolls' House. I would
walk alone between the two lines and up to the barrier, which, after a low,
brief exchange, would be unhooked to let me pass. 'Yes sir? You wish to see
the drawings, sir? Of course. This way, sir.' Insufferable.
I felt, as many others did, intensely proprietorial about the place. I too
had - still have - a Windsor Castle of my very own - ancient, familiar,
comfortable, romantic, fixing the present so very firmly in the continuous
historic past. And it is a feeling about the place itself, and the town
which grew up around it, and the countryside of river and park beyond, and
the people who made it what it is.

FT  21 NOV 92 / Windsor fire destroys historic hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUEEN'S art collection, most of which will have escaped destruction in
yesterday's blaze at Windsor Castle, is possibly the greatest private
collection in the world.
The castle holds the greatest concentration of items in the collection. As
well as the works of art there are collections of armour, furniture and
18th-century French tapestries.
Last night the Duke of York said he believed only six paintings had been
lost in the blaze, which spread from the Brunswick Tower to St George's
Hall.
Buckingham Palace said that all the works of art were safely removed from St
George's Hall - one of the main state rooms - and the long corridor, where
many of the most valuable paintings were hanging. The fabric of St George's
Hall had been 'very badly gutted'.
Fire incident commander David Harper said last night: 'It's such a
complicated building. You have to rely an awful lot on the people who work
in it. The structure is very weak in certain places.'
Mr Adair Lewis, manager of information services for the for the Fire
Protection Association, said: 'Blazes can spread quickly and undetected in
the nooks and crannies of large old palaces and castles.
'It was found after the Hampton Court fire that there were all sorts of
voids which were not known about.' The restoration of Hampton Court Palace,
which took five years, was completed last year.
The serious damage to the hall is a blow for the national heritage. The
original room was built in the 14th century as the banqueting hall of King
Edward III. It could have been there that he inaugurated the Order of the
Garter.
For more than 600 years it has been the site of the annual banquet of the
Garter Knights. Their coats of arms, now numbering almost 1,000, cover the
ceiling.
The walls are lined with sets of arms and armour and with portraits of
British sovereigns from King James I to King William IV, including works by
Van Dyck and Kneller. Among the special treasures is a bust of George II by
Roubiliac.
The hall in its present form was the creation of King George IV in the early
19th century.
George IV lengthened the hall to 185ft and made it a triumph of Regency
Gothic.
Many of the paintings had been taken down because of the electrical rewiring
in progress at the castle. That helped the rescuers when they formed human
chains to lift the paintings, vases, armour, tapestries, carpets and other
works of art to safety, but many works of art will have been damaged by
smoke.

FT  30 APR 93 / Buckingham Palace to open doors to paying visitors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUCKINGHAM Palace is to be opened to the public for the first time this
summer, prompted by royal glasnost and financial prudence. Fees paid by
visitors will help to pay for the restoration of Windsor Castle after the
fire last November.
The palace will open from the second week of August for about two months,
with an adult entrance fee of Pounds 8, Pounds 5.50 for people over 60 and
Pounds 4 for those under 17.
Over the next five years, the revenues, plus a new Pounds 3 entrance charge
for Windsor, will pay for 70 per cent of the estimated Pounds 30m to Pounds
40m repair bill for fire damage at Windsor, Mr Peter Brooke, national
heritage secretary, said yesterday. The rest will be paid by the state.
Visitors to Buckingham Palace will be able to see 17 state rooms, gardens
and the west elevation. They will not be allowed into the private quarters
of the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh or Prince Edward, or into working
offices.
The palace would not speculate on how many visitors it expected. Some 40,000
people already visit the palace each year by personal invitation of the
Queen. But if the final bill for the restoration of Windsor totals Pounds
40m, the equivalent of 3.5m adult visitors will be required to cover the
monarchy's 70 per cent share.
The public opening of the palace - first built in 1677 - will be a
short-lived affair. The gates will probably be closed again by the end of
1997, when the restoration of Windsor should be complete.
A palace spokesman said the entrance fees were arrived at after considering
charges at 'similar types of attraction'.
Two of the Queen's private residences - Buckingham Palace is owned by the
nation - are already open for limited periods of the year. Sandringham
charges Pounds 3 for adults, Pounds 2 for children; Balmoral is cheaper, at
Pounds 1.75 for adults and free for children.
The palace, however, is priced above competing London attractions, which
admittedly lack its exclusiveness.
Adults pay Pounds 7.40 at Madame Tussaud's waxwork museum (owned, like the
Financial Times, by Pearson), Pounds 6 for the London Dungeon, and Pounds
4.50 for the Natural History Museum.
But the White House is open year round at no charge, and imperial residences
in Japan, such as Kyoto Imperial Palace and three other imperial villas, are
open year round (except weekends and public holidays). They make no charge,
but visitors must carry their passports.
Around Europe several other official royal residences are already open. In
Madrid, the Palacio Real - about Pta600 (Pounds 3) - is open all year, as is
the Netherlands' Royal Palace in Amsterdam, and the small Palais du Prince -
about FFr50 (Pounds 6) - in Monaco.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev followed in the
footsteps of the czars and came to Queen Elizabeth II's castle on
Friday, then asked the question Britons have been speculating about
for months.
   He asked the monarch if she would come to Moscow. Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said the queen gave ``a very definite yes.''
   Winding up his two-day visit, the Soviet leader sampled
old-fashioned British pageantry _ first in the oak-paneled splendor
of the Guildhall, for 800 years the seat of London city government,
then in majestic Windsor Castle overlooking the River Thames.
   Elizabeth will be the first British monarch to visit the Soviet
Union since the revolution that ousted the czars and brought the
communists to power.
   The invitation has great implications because of the close
kinship of the Russian and British royal families. Czar Nicholas
II, a cousin of the queen's grandfather, was murdered with his
family in 1918, ending the Romanov dynasty.
   The queen's reaction sounded somewhat guarded. A Buckingham
Palace statement said: ``Thanking Mr. Gorbachev, Her Majesty
explained that the program for her visits were fixed a number of
years in advance. She hoped it would be possible to visit the
Soviet Union in due course.''
   But Mrs. Thatcher, whose government has the final word on
approving or rejecting a visit, said: ``It's a very definite yes.''
She added the queen was ``very positive, very glad, very happy''
about the invitation.
   In November, a month before Gorbachev originally was scheduled
to visit Britain, reports of a Soviet prospective invitation to the
queen started circulating and Mrs. Thatcher let it be known she
thought it was too soon to give such a resounding stamp of approval
to the Soviet leader's reform plans.
   At a news conference in London Friday night, Soviet officials
were asked whether the palace or British government had insisted
the Soviets apologize for the treatment of the Russian royal family
before the queen accepted the invitation.
   Yevgeny Primakov of the Soviet Institute of World Economic and
International Politics said there were ``no preconditions on either
side.''
   He said Soviets are reasessing their history but added: ``This
is not the point. This is an invitation to a head of state of a
country with which we are trying to find points of convergence.''
   Gorbachev was driven to Windsor Castle, 21 miles west of London
_ the first Soviet leader since 1967 to visit the queen.
   In drizzling rain, he took the Royal Salute from the Guard of
Honor mounted by the 1st Battalion Coldstream Guards. The captain
then reported to Gorbachev in Russian and the Soviet leader,
carrying his hat in his hand, reviewed the troops clad in gray
greatcoats and bearskin hats.
   The queen, wearing a pink cape and matching skirt, then took
Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, on a quick tour of the palace _ past
relics from the Crusades, medieval knights on horseback, King Henry
VIII's suit of armor, and a painting of the Russian Emperor
Alexander I. Gorbachev beamed in recognition.
   The party made a brief detour to enable Gorbachev to look at a
malachite vase given to Queen Victoria by Czar Nicholas I.
   Nicholas I was the first of the czarist cousins to come to
Windsor, spending three days in June 1844 as Victoria's guest.
Alexander II, the future Alexander III, and the future Nicholas II,
were also entertained at Windsor by the British royals.
   Buckingham Palace said Gorbachev invited the queen to visit the
Soviet Union over a lunch of smoked salmon, pastry filled with
layers of beef, duck puree and artichoke and avocado salad, and
three wines.
   The 34 guests included Mrs. Thatcher and her husband, Denis, and
the queen's youngest son, Prince Edward, who will be visiting
Moscow next week with the National Youth Theater.
   Lord St. John of Fawsley, a constitutional expert, said the
invitation ``will cement the very warm relationship between
ourselves and the Soviet Union. I think it will put an end to all
tensions that could have come from the memories of the
assassination of the czar and I think the queen will have a very
ecstatic reception.''
   Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's peerage,
said the queen should insist that the Soviets disclose where Czar
Nicolas II and his family are buried, and that she be allowed to
pay her respects.
   ``The fact that the queen could see the graves of her relations,
and repair the damage done after the Russian Revolution in a
Christian and religious way, would perhaps bring these countries
closer together than anyone ever thought possible,'' he said.

FT  16 APR 93 / Arts: Royal views of Windsor Castle - Susan Moore reviews
the work of Thomas and Paul Sandby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the major consequences of the Queen's 'annus horribilis' has been an
increase in public debate abut the Royal Collection. The ill-informed have
been tempted to speculate that the Queen might start selling off works of
art to pay the tax man. Yet a splendid if unassuming exhibition at Windsor
comes as a timely reminder that the collection is growing, albeit modestly.
Since the number of paintings, drawings and watercolours is an awesome
10,000, 20,000 and 30,000 respectively, some say that the collection is big
enough, while others press for contemporary acquisitions. As it happens,
portraits of the current holders of the Order of Merit are in the process of
being commissioned, and recent additions to the already rich holding of
Sandby drawings of Windsor represent a special case.
Amid the throng of tourists gripped by the Changing of the Guard and the
burnt-out shells of rooms ravaged by the recent fire, the new drawings
gallery is a haven of tranquility. It has been formed out of a Georgian
Gothick lobby that led to the Grand Staircase before Wyattville remodelled
the castle for William IV. A gallery has been there since the 1960s, but it
has been transformed by the designs of Alec Cobbe into an environment that
is both intimate and grand. Drawings are shown to striking advantage on
Gothic screens against dark burgundy damask.
As a topographical draughtsman to the Duke of Cumberland, and then Deputy
Ranger of Windsor Great Park, Thomas Sandby was resident at Windsor for much
of his life. His views of the castle and its environs, along with those made
by or in collaboration with his younger brother Paul, constitute an
unparallelled record of Windsor and the development of the Great Park in the
second half of the 18th century.
Grand, showy gouaches by Paul open the show. Three out of the four are
relatively recent acquisitions and, given their fragile condition, may never
be exhibited elsewhere. The clarity of light and artfully casual
distribution of figures in his delightful 'The North Terrace looking east',
suggest why Canaletto should have been so readily collected by the British -
and bring to mind the gouaches of his fellow Venetian Marco Ricci.
Thereafter, we move between Paul and Thomas, and sheets that can only be
read as a combination of their talents. Few works are signed and even
signatures need not always tell the whole truth, but it seems reasonably
clear that the most ravishing of all the sheets, those carefully
pencil-drawn and subtlely washed prospects of the castle and the untroubled
landscape beyond, are the work of Thomas. Their meticulous mapping of every
tree, field, turn in the Thames - almost every roof tile - mark them out as
the productions of the trained military topographer who was to become the
first Professor of Architecture at the Royal Academy of Arts. In one
masterly panorama, a sign undecipherable to the naked eye offers 'Coffie and
Tea' in the old guardroom.
Figures appear to have been largely Paul's responsibility. Here are one or
two larger-scale studies of the personalities found in the Duke of
Cumberland's household in the 1750s. Thus we find Bob Dun, one of the Duke's
gardeners, 'a most facetious fellow', Voules the bailiff, the steward and an
un-named negro servant. More usually, however, the figures are simply
staffage, there to be busy in the Moat Garden wielding watering cans or to
stand guard in immaculate and picturesque uniforms.
Even in this small selection, numbering a slim 28 sheets and representing
perhaps a tenth of the collection, there is considerable evidence of
unevenness. Thomas is seen to best advantage in a series of masterly
panoramas, and more modestly at work designing various rustic structures
like the root house and the rockwork bridge for the Great Park. Paul is
shown capable of bravura gouaches but also of a coarseness of touch which is
even more pronounced beside the precision and delicacy of Thomas.
It is not easy to judge this show purely on its artistic merits, or on its
historical interest. It is impossible not to be seduced by what comes across
as a cloudless golden age before the castle was troubled by the Heathrow
flight path and the bad weather John Piper found there during the war.
One note of high drama reminds us of the present more than the past: Paul's
spectacular watercolour and gouache of 'Windsor Castle on a Rejoicing
Night'. Shooting fireworks confected out of flecks of gold paint light up
the night sky and a massive gold and pink-tinged bonfire ominously
silhouettes the Winchester Tower and sends out billowing black smoke. And
the presence of a drunken man being half-carried away from the revelry
suggests that Saturday nights have not really changed all that much.
The exhibition continues at Windsor Castle until October 3

FT  23 APR 94 / Arts: Windsor after the fire - William Packer finds
Alexander Creswell following in the tradition of Turner, Sandby and Piper
with his evocative watercolours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the age of the photograph, the uses of the work of art as a thing of
topographical or architectural record may often be overlooked, but the
argument remains. In matters of particular emphasis and annotation, and of
personal experience and response, the drawing or painting may take on a
selective authority which the supposedly all-seeing camera can seldom match.
There was Turner, watching from the river as the old Houses of Parliament
went up in flames: there was Paul Sandby, noting down the informal daily
life of the Windsor Castle of the later 18th century: there too, under
darker neo-romantic skies, was John Piper, seeing the Castle in wartime
through more dramatic eyes - 'you don't seem to have had much luck with the
weather, Mr Piper', remarked the King.
The great fire at Windsor Castle, late in 1992, touched a national, indeed
an universal nerve, as the image went round the world of one of the great
monuments and symbols of nationhood about to be, so it seemed, destroyed. No
doubt, in its aftermath, every single square inch of the damage has been
dutifully photographed, but how good it is to learn that an artist,
Alexander Creswell, was also called in to make more subjective, perhaps, but
no less pertinent a record.
The damaged part of the Castle, he tells us, 'had been wrapped in plastic
sheeting . . . isolated from the world . . . enshrouded. The sun filtered
through from above . . . The plastic sheeting rustled . . . pigeons flapped
around somewhere above . . . tourists gazed in . . . a band struck up in the
Quadrangle, the tunes echoing round the empty walls, distorted and remote .
. . The damage inside the Castle had created a fantasy, a ghost of a
palatial interior.' Ruins are familiar enough to all of us, but it is the
freshness of ruin and devastation that is so shocking: 'it was cold and
sepulchral in the Castle, the rubble giving off a stench of black rot.'
We see what he means. It is, of course, the documentary and circumstantial
content of these dozen or so watercolours, commissioned for the Royal
Collection, that will give them their immediate reclame, and it has to be
said that at this first level they are immediately effective and satisfying.
The mood is appropriately doom-laden and tragical, the perspectives looming
and dramatic, the significant detail  - the skeletal rafters, the isolated
malachite vase, a corner of gothic tracery, an empty frame - well-chosen and
well-observed.
But they are better than that, something more than of merely superficial
interest and indulgence. A good story, after all, can bear the bad telling:
told well, we are hardly aware of the telling at all. And Creswell does the
business very well indeed, working with a freedom yet sureness of touch, and
a simple, confident authority in the setting up of his composition, that
together mark him out as a true painter, not just a reasonably efficient
note-taker and recorder.
For it is never the image alone, and what it represents, that makes the work
of interest as art, but always the way it is done - the command of the
medium, the direct, physical engagement with surface and material, the sense
of adventure and discovery and an element of risk. Creswell's sketchbooks
even more than the full-dress paintings give us this picture of the true
artist, unselfconsciously absorbed in the subject.
There is in all this, however, something of a paradox and a word of warning.
Creswell is clearly a skilful painter, master of his chosen medium and his
favoured architectural subject-matter. That said, it may well be that so
strong and extraordinary was the experience afforded him by the devastation
of Windsor Castle, that there was nothing for it but for him to lose himself
and all his skill in the magnificent awfulness before him - which is
precisely why his Windsor work is so successful.
Is there is to the accompanying group of paintings, of great houses from
Rome to St Petersburg, something rather less of the intuitive excitement,
rather more of the mechanical and, dare I say, complacent? A few lines from
Basil Bunting's Briggflatts come to mind: 'It is time to consider how
Domenico Scarlatti/ condensed so much music into so few bars/ with never a
crabbed turn or congested cadence/ never a boast or a see-here . . .' But
the show is worth catching, the only pity that it has been on for so short a
time.

'Take the train to Windsor for an unforgettable day out' gushes NetWork
SouthEast's latest lavishly-illustrated poster. Among the attractions on the
poster, promoting cheap fares, is a cut-away drawing of Windsor Castle which
clearly depicts St George's Hall 'primarily used for banquets' and the
Waterloo Chamber which 'the Royal Family use for their Christmas pantomime'.
Bit odd, since both these imposing state rooms were all but destroyed in
last year's fire. British Rail would be providing the country with a better
service if it encouraged trippers to visit Buckingham Palace which has been
specially opened to raise money to repair Windsor Castle.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Charred, not changed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Before the great fire of Windsor the talk of London and elsewhere was that
Britain's royal family was on the skids. If that was so last week, then it
still is today, despite the flames that dominated the weekend news. If the
prospect last Thursday was that Prince Charles would never become king, it
is the same this Tuesday morning. A charred national monument will make no
difference, however glorious the original may have been. Hampton Court was
gutted by fire six years ago; since then, coincidentally, its occasional
inhabitants have been the victims of incessant crescendos of public
disrespect.
Hold on. This is not a prediction that a revolution is around the corner.
The establishment of a federal republic of Britain would be a remarkable
constitutional advance, but the odds in favour of any such development are
slight. Yet they are not zero. None of us really knows what the heir
apparent has on his mind. Gossip suggests that he is fed up, that he might
try to have the crown passed over his head to his son's. If he does so the
whole institution will probably crumble. Only a brave or unintentionally
destructive dauphin would risk that.
The dramatic flames of the weekend have put such speculation on hold, at
least for a day or two. It is natural to express sympathy for the Queen, as
seen on TV bravely surveying the conflagration in her raincoat. No one who
fails to make the appropriate noises will be regarded as a gentleman.
Certainly Her Majesty is held in greater public esteem than any other member
of her family. While she reigns, the institution is secure. What may come
after her is less predictable. This is not because the monarchy is costly,
although if it was privatised and managed as a tourist attraction, as it
should be, a strong finance director would doubtless find much fat to trim.
You would then be well advised to take shares in Royal Attractions plc. It
could be a far better bet than Euro Disney.
The fact that the Queen pays no tax, even on her private investment
portfolio, does rankle with a great many people. Some Labour MPs, notably
those on the public accounts committee, miss no chance of reminding us of
her tax-free status. Perhaps that is why we have been reading stories about
the prime minister negotiating a new fiscal concordat with the palace.
Monarchists must hope that he is successful. He should be. There is no case
for the Queen withholding the tax she should pay on her considerable
personal fortune. This is a simple problem of equity, which in theory can
easily be resolved.
It is harder to prescribe an antidote for the de-mystifying effect of our
national obsession with the private lives, or the imagined private lives, of
the supposedly dignified element of the constitution. It is not the Queen's
fault that the private behaviour of some members of her family is similar to
that of many of her subjects. The House of Windsor is not the product of a
long line of saints; its forebears were human, and therefore imperfect. The
damage that has recently been done to its reputation is not the consequence
of any change in royal behaviour, but rather the result of a change in the
level of intrusive salacity the public will accept from - indeed demand of -
the media that serves it.
If none of these concerns existed there would be near-unanimous support for
the decision, affirmed by Mr Peter Brooke yesterday, to finance the
restoration of Windsor Castle from public funds. The heritage secretary has
logic on his side. The building belongs to us taxpayers. We have maintained
them since 1831. The monarchy is irrelevant to this argument. Even if we
lived in a republic this valued historic monument would be maintained by the
public purse.
As it is, provided we turn up at the right time we may see most parts of it,
including some of the burned-out area - although you may need an invitation
to a state banquet to get into the grander state rooms. Those who argue that
Windsor Castle should be subject to normal planning permission and fire
regulations have a point. But that is a red herring. The cry of 'let the
Queen pay' is not rational, although strongly felt. It means 'let the Queen
pay taxes'.
There is no general cry for what is really needed, which is the
disestablishment of the monarchy. British democracy would be less stultified
if it was disconnected from the process of government. The Crown sits at the
apex of our unwritten constitution. It puts the lid on the glass jar inside
which sit the suffocating elements of a Britain that should be long past: an
over-powerful executive (thankfully rather hamstrung for the moment); a
tradition of secrecy in the name of the Crown; a tendency for ministers to
make arbitrary decisions; an obsession with maintaining the unitary
structure of the United Kingdom. Every milligram of ash at Windsor Castle is
a small national tragedy; a bonfire of the constitutional nonsense that
rests on the House of Windsor would be a huge national triumph.

   Mikhail Gorbachev today had lunch with
Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor Castle and invited her to visit the
Soviet Union.
   Her office said the queen told Gorbachev she would like to
accept, but her foreign travel is fixed years in advance.
   She would be the first British sovereign to visit the Soviet
Union since the Russian royal family, her cousins, were murdered
after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.
   ``Thanking Mr. Gorbachev, Her Majesty explained that the program
for her visits were fixed a number of years in advance. She hoped
it would be possible to visit the Soviet Union in due course,'' a
Buckingham Palace statement said.
   The announcement came as the Soviet leader left Windsor Castle
for London's Heathrow Airport to return home at the end of a
40-hour visit to Britain.
   Earlier, Gorbachev and his wife Raisa drove to the majestic
castle on the Thames River in drizzling rain.
   Maj. Nicholas Parsons invited the Kremlin leader in fluent
Russian to inspect a guard of honor of bearskin-capped Coldstream
Guards.
   The queen, in bright pink skirt and cape, and her husband,
Prince Philip, greeted her guests on the castle doorstep.
   Gorbachev was the first Soviet leader since 1967 to meet the
queen, and by putting the royal seal on his 40-hour visit to
Britain, he clearly hoped to enhance the benign image he is trying
to implant in Western minds.
   Windsor Castle, the palace 20 miles west of London, has been a
royal residence for more than 800 years, and the queen took the
Gorbachevs on a tour of some of its rooms and held a lunch in their
honor.
   The 34 guests, including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and
her husband Denis, ate smoked salmon cornets filled with crabmeat,
layers of fillet of beef, duck puree and sliced artichoke, all
baked in pastry.
   Earlier today, Gorbachev delivered a major televised policy
speech in the oak-paneled, chandeliered splendor of Guildhall, for
800 years the seat of London city government.
   Like many of Britain's archaic institutions, the Guildhall's
power is more in its looks than in its powers. Like Queen Elizabeth
II, the Guildhall and its lord mayor are restricted largely to
ceremonial duties.
   The Gorbachevs arrived at the Guildhall in a 24-car motorcade
through the congested streets of the City, London's financial
district, where the lord mayor, Alderman Sir Christopher Collett,
waited, resplendent in black, gold-braided robes and three-corner
hat.
   Gorbachev was escorted into the building in a procession led by
the mayor, the sergeant at arms and officials bearing a sword and a
gold mace, symbol of city authority.
   A trumpet fanfare announced the Gorbachevs' entry into the hall,
and they stood beside Mrs. Thatcher and her husband Denis as the
Soviet and British anthems were played.
   An array of dignitaries packed the hall, ranging across the
political spectrum from Mrs. Thatcher through Archbishop of
Canterbury Robert Runcie to Bruce Kent, chairman of the Campaign
for Nuclear Disarmament.
   Pikemen, musketeers, sheriffs and city elders in blue robes
stood by to complete the pageant.

   A dog belonging to Queen Elizabeth II died after
being bitten in a fight with other royal dogs at Windsor Castle,
Buckingham Palace said.
   Chipper, a 12-year-old cross between a dachshund and a corgi,
was involved in a fight started by Ranger, a corgi belonging to
Queen Mother Elizabeth, the palace said Friday.
   The crossbreed, known as a dorgi, was stitched up after the
fight by a veterinarian but died, the palace said.
   The queen was given a corgi by her parents in the 1930s when she
was a little princess. They became the royal family's most popular
house dogs because of their small size but palace staff and
visitors say the dogs tend to snap at ankles.
   Princess Margaret, the queen's sister, preferred dachshunds.

<HEAD>British Crown Jewels Hidden in Lake in World War II, Newspaper
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The most precious gems among Britain's crown
jewels were hidden in a lake at Windsor Castle during World War II
to keep them out of German hands if the country was invaded, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   The Sunday Telegraph said the only people who knew of the hiding
place were King George VI, who chose it, and Sir Owen Morshead, his
librarian.
   The king, father of Queen Elizabeth II, died in 1952 and
Morshead in 1977.
   The newspaper said that in 1940, when a German invasion was
anticipated, the king ordered the royal jewelers to take the gems
from the Tower of London to Windsor Castle, about 20 miles west of
London.
   The king and Morshead then wrenched the most important gems out
of their settings with pliers and other tools provided by a
chauffeur, according to the newspaper.
   ``The gems, including the Koh-i-Noor diamond, were then wrapped
in cotton wool, placed in a tin and submerged in one of the lakes
at Windsor. There they remained until the defeat of Germany and for
a long time only the king and Sir Owen knew,'' wrote the
newspaper's anonymous columnist, Mandrake.
   The Koh-i-Noor is an Indian diamond of 108 carats presented to
Queen Victoria in 1849. Its name means Mountain of Light.
   The wartime hiding place of the jewels, which today are on
public display at the Tower of London, has always been a mystery in
Britain.
   But the Sunday Telegraph said it had discovered that the facts
were revealed in 1972 in a book that was never translated from
French _ a biography of the military leader Jean-Marie Lattre de
Tassigny by his widow, Simonne.
   The newspaper said it was told of the story by Lattre de
Tassigny's British aide, John Saint-Clair Smallwood, who said he
accompanied the general and his wife on a visit to Windsor in 1949
at Morshead's invitation. Smallwood said Morshead related the
secret to them as they gazed out of the castle windows onto the
grounds where there was a round pond.
   According to the newspaper, Smallwood related that Morshead said
the king told him the crown jewels represented ``the honors and the
kingdom of England'' and must not fall into German hands.
   The report did not say where the crown jewel settings were kept
during the war.
   Most of the crown jewels date from the restoration of the
monarchy after the death of Oliver Cromwell, who overthrew King
Charles I and died in 1658. Cromwell had the original crown jewels
sold or melted.

FT  24 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Historic building experts to plan
work - Commons row over liability for repair costs fo up to Pounds 60m after
Windsor Castle fire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HISTORIC-building and art experts are to meet shortly to make preliminary
plans for the restoration of the castle's damaged state apartments. They are
expected to report within a month.
The extent of the damage will possibly take weeks to establish, as the
structure has to be inspected, and rescued and lost pictures and furnishings
checked against the castle's inventory.
First priority will be to put a temporary roof over the burnt-out sections
to keep out rain, dampness and frost that could further affect masonry and
timbers weakened by the fire and the thousands of gallons of water pumped on
the blaze.
A number of organisations will be involved, including the National Heritage
Department, which will be responsible for paying for repairs to the
structure; English Heritage as the historical and technical experts; and the
royal household as occupiers.
According to English Heritage, which will play a big role in advising on the
form restoration should take, the building should be allowed to dry
naturally rather than by using industrial heaters, which might harm
surviving timbers.
The most likely judgment is that the state apartments should be returned to
the condition they were in before the fire, based on the wealth of archive
evidence available.
That will require a pool of skilled labour, particularly carpenters and
plasterers, either from specialist builders or individual craftsmen. Several
building companies specialise in historical restoration and retain teams of
craftsmen. One, Sussex-based James Longley, won the contract at Hampton
Court palace, damaged by fire in 1986, in open tender. English Heritage also
maintains teams of specialists.
Sir Geoffrey de Bellaigue, director of the royal collection, has reported to
the Queen that the greatest damage was to the fabric of the castle.

Sir, Your architectural correspondent applauded ('A foolish plan to reinvent
Windsor', November 30) the renovation of run-down Windsor Castle by its
'complete transformation' in the 1820s by Jeffrey Wyatville in the style of
his time.
However, he then declared himself amazed that the Royal Institute of British
Architects has reacted to the fire at Windsor Castle by suggesting that a
distinguished architect of today should also respond to the fire in the
style of his time.

FT  22 MAR 93 / Arts: Gothic preserved - The case for sympathetic building
and restoration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It often seems to me that architecture is sometimes taken much too
seriously. Sides are taken and battle lines are drawn in a fashion that
often looks ridiculous to anyone outside the profession. Do you really care
whether or not a design is modern, post-modern, gothic or classical? What
matters is whether or not the design is good. One of the subjects that
currently arouses ire and passion in equal doses in the breasts of
architects is the future of the damaged wing of Windsor Castle.
That esteemed organ, Country Life, which now seems to be all set under its
new editorial team to become the journal of imagination when it comes to
architectural and environmental issues, has just launched an important
international competition for designs for the rebuilding of the fire-damaged
areas of Windsor Castle. The reason for mentioning this in this column is
principally because it is open to anyone - artists, interior designers, 'and
anyone else who feels qualified to comment'. This sounds a brilliant idea
because there are many of us who have maintained for a long time that
architects do not necessarily have the monopoly of architectural ideas.
The other reason why the Windsor competition could be very important
(although impossible to judge) is that it may concentrate minds on the
debate about the appropriate way to treat historic buildings. The only
problem with this competition is the nature of the jury. For some reason,
presumably to excite international interest, Country Life seems to have lost
its traditional nerve and gone for trendy names on its jury - as well as
some deadbeat modernists who are known to be deeply prejudiced against
history itself. But far be it from a mere architecture critic to put anyone
off entering a competition because of the composition of the jury. After
all, this competition does deal with a fascinating and important
architectural problem. The key thing to remember is that it is open to
anyone.
The competition brief is available from Country Life Windsor Castle
Competition, Winkfield, Windsor, Berkshire, SL4 2EH. Telephone: 0344 890080.
There is an entry fee of Pounds 10 and a very modest prize of Pounds 1000.
The closing date is June 10.
The Architecture Foundation is another ginger group that is keen to get on
the Windsor Castle bandwagon. It has commissioned several practising
architects, mainly but not entirely of a modernist persuasion, to come up
with a new design for the interior of the damaged St. George's Hall. These
will be exhibited shortly at the Architecture Foundation and published in a
forthcoming book about Windsor Castle by Dr Mark Girouard.
When it comes to architectural tradition there always has been a
comparatively unsung group of architects and craftsmen in England quietly
working away building and designing things that are usually ignored by the
architectural press. What these unsung heroes generally achieve is very
happy clients and plenty of work. They are free of the vagaries of fashion
and mercifully outside the intense and often meaningless international
debate. One of these architects is Roderick Gradidge, who has recently
completed an ingenious scheme for St. Edmund's College, Cambridge.
The college is situated on Mount Pleasant - the part of Cambridge that marks
the commencement of the line of new colleges that proceed to the west of the
city. It was founded as St. Edmund's House by the 15th Duke of Norfolk in
1896 as a residence for Roman Catholic clergy studying for degrees. Since
1965 the college has been an approved graduate college and now has some 150
students from 30 countries. The early gabled red brick, turn of the century
buildings are without any particular distinction and to unify and extend
them was a not inconsiderable challenge for the architect. For a long time
Gradidge has taken a pioneering interest in the history of Edwardian
architecture - his work at the National Portrait Gallery in London and his
more recent restoration of the Guildhall at Northampton shows a
knowledgeable enthusiasm for Edwardian and Gothic interiors.
At Cambridge Gradidge had little opportunity to provide decorative
interiors. Instead he has designed a striking brick tower some six storeys
high to mark the entrance to the college. At the top of this tower is the
Okinaga Room, named after the benefactor (Dr S. Okinaga the President of
Teikyo University, Japan). This is the highest room in Cambridge and has
remarkable views over the whole city. The style of the tower has been
described by the architect as 'streamlined Tudor'. It is built of buff brick
with a slate roof and has some well carved heraldry in the brickwork (by
Richard Kindersley). The tower has succeeded in centering the plan of the
college, giving it a prominent entrance and literally raising its profile in
Cambridge. Gradidge worked throughout the scheme with the Charter
Partnership.
Shades of Tudor and Gothic revivals are clearly in the air with attention
focused on the fate of the unrepaired Albert Memorial in London's Kensington
Gardens, which is now a neglected victim of government parsimony. There is
an argument for putting Albert into a glass case but a public appeal for
funds looks more likely. That will be a real test of the national enthusiasm
for the Gothic - and the recent news that passengers from the Channel Tunnel
trains are now going to arrive at St. Pancras gives Railway Gothic a sudden
international dimension.
I would like to see architect Michael Hopkins put in charge of the
replanning of the station, as he has the rare skill of understanding and
adding to the past without any hint of nostalgia or pastiche. He would also
provide ample evidence to our visitors from Europe that although we love the
Gothic we are not totally smothered by Gothic gloom. Next year's exhibition
at the Victoria and Albert Museum devoted to the life and work of Pugin will
show once and for all how Gothic architecture and design can marry
structural ingenuity with colour and decoration in a way that many
contemporary architects still find difficult to contemplate, let alone
achieve.

<LEADPARA>  Is she or isn't she the world's richest woman? And should she or shouldn't she
pay taxes on her income, just like everyone else? Those brash questions about
Queen Elizabeth II were raised in Parliament this week by Liberal Party Member
of Parliament Simon Hughes, in a move that reflected the opinion of a majority
of citizens.;    More than 70 percent of the British, polls show, believe her
income should be subject to taxes. Or as Hughes put it, "When so many people
in my (London) constituency are scraping along and asked to contribute tax on
very low incomes, it seems grossly unfair that the person with the highest
income escapes. And there's no reason a modern constitutional monarch
shouldn't pay taxes."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  COUNTING QUEEN ELIZABETH'S MILLIONS
ESTIMATES PLACE MONARCH'S WEALTH AT $7.4
BILLION  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The queen's personal net worth has long been a matter of considerable
speculation and argument, since, unlike U.S. heads of state, she is not
required to make public the amount of her wealth and she has not volunteered
the information. Estimates range on the high side -- Fortune magazine
estimates it at $7.4 billion, with an annual income of perhaps $3 million a
day; Buckingham Palace snorts that such a sum is "grossly exaggerated." There
also is a more modest estimate that her income is $35 million annually.;   
Over the years, researchers have tried to estimate the queen's personal
capital and income. Those assets are different from the institutions of the
monarchy, including the crown jewels in the Tower of London and the official
residences of Buckingham Castle, Windsor Castle, and Holyrood Castle.;    As
far as current official income goes, she receives from the British government
-- in what is called the Civil List -- 7.9 million pounds, or about $12.5
million. That sum is much more than her royal household expenses, giving her a
comfortable surplus this year. (Her employees, incidentally, pay taxes on
their salaries.);    But the queen has other major resources: Whatever money
she inherited from her father, King George VI; a vault full of precious jewels
-- crowns, tiaras, diamonds, rubies, emeralds; Faberge eggs; and the royal art
collection with 900 Leonardo Da Vinci drawings, 26 Van Dycks and works by
other masters. There is also one of the world's most valuable stamp
collections.;    Further, she owns hundreds of thousands of prime agricultural
acres, as well as valuable property in central London. Then there are Balmoral
and Sandringham castles with 64,000 acres between them. Not to be forgotten
are the royal stud farms and stables.;    The queen's major source of income
may be her private investments, which have accrued tax-free over a long
period. In 1971, to quiet speculation, the palace let it be known that her
investment portfolio in stock shares did not exceed 50 million pounds.;   
Taking an even lower figure of 35 million pounds, Andrew Morton, author of
"Theirs Is the Kingdom: The Wealth of the Windsors," consulted experts who
estimated that, if reasonably wisely invested, the portfolio would be worth
600 million pounds today. He estimates the queen's personal wealth at 1.2
billion pounds.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
Britain's royal family can sleep soundly again; the financial headache of
how to pay for the restoration of the fire-ravaged Windsor Castle could soon
be over, thanks to piles of the black stuff.
No, not coal - oil. According to an article in the Oil and Gas Journal, the
US oil industry's bible, Her Majesty could be sitting on top of one of
Britain's biggest onshore oilfields.
Desmond Oswald, boss of the little-known Canuk Exploration, has been poking
around underneath the castle for the past four years. He believes that as
many as 100m barrels of oil may be trapped in a reservoir which begins only
1,000 feet below the Castle. Little is known about Canuk, based in Gerrards
Cross, but other oil industry sources say the idea is not as barmy as it
sounds.
Oswald expresses surprise that 'such a large structure should have remained
undrilled in a country where extensive exploration has taken place'. Having
done his homework, he is now seeking a competent operator to contribute
financially to the drilling of an exploratory well.
Of course, the royals may not be amused at the thought of nodding donkeys
taking their place alongside the Household Cavalry. But times have changed.
Prince Edward has set himself up in the film business and his mum opened
Buckingham Palace to paying gogglers for a few weeks this summer. The
possibility of a gusher under Windsor Castle should not be ignored just
because it might keep the occupants awake at night.

<TEXT>
   Proclaiming it ``the first contact of its kind
since 1917,'' Soviet television broadcast Friday's meeting between
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Queen Elizabeth II with relish
and lingering detail.
   After a leisurely shot of Gorbachev's cortege gliding up the
lush drive to Windsor Castle, the nightly news program ``Vremya''
touted the ``symbolic significance'' of the British monarch's
hospitality to the Communist leader.
   The narrator recalled that close relations between Russian and
British nobility ended in 1917 ``when the Romanovs were deprived of
power.''
   Czar Nicholas II abdicated in early 1917, and he and his entire
family were shot by the Bolsheviks in 1918. Nicholas was a cousin
of the queen's grandfather.
   As the dignitaries stood at attention and the Soviet national
anthem was played, Soviet TV noted that ``never before has the
anthem of the Soviet Union been sounded here,'' at Windsor Castle.
   The report praised the castle's furnishings and art as
``invaluable collections.''
   Gorbachev invited the queen to visit Moscow, and she accepted in
principle but said her schedule was fixed years in advance.
   Dissidents contended she should reject the invitation because of
continuing Soviet human rights violations.
   Andrei Mironov, a Moscow dissident and former political
prisoner, cited the case of a dissident journalist in Sverdlovsk
who is now on trial.
   Mironov spoke as he and four others gave a protest letter to the
British Embassy about the trial of Sergei Kuznetsov. The dissidents
wanted the embassy to have Britain's prime minister, Margaret
Thatcher, raise the case in her talks with Gorbachev.
   Soviet television also covered Gorbachev's meeting with Mrs.
Thatcher extensively.
   It broadcast live on Friday the speeches by Gorbachev and Mrs.
Thatcher at London's Guildhall.

FT  10 DEC 92 / Prince Charles and Diana to separate but not divorce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRINCE and Princess of Wales are to separate, Buckingham Palace
announced yesterday, but the government said the princess could still become
Queen.
Mr John Major told MPs the decision had no constitutional implications and
there were 'no plans' for the couple to divorce. Prince Charles's succession
as head of the Church of England, which frowns on divorce, was also
unaffected.
The prime minister said: 'There is no reason why the Princess of Wales
should not be crowned Queen in due course.'
The couple's 11-year marriage had been subject to intense speculation by
newspapers, fuelled by the publication in June of a biography of the
princess by Mr Andrew Morton. Buckingham Palace said the Queen was
'saddened' by the announcement and wanted an end to the press intrusions
into the couple's lives.
The Queen believes 'a degree of privacy and understanding is essential if
their Royal Highnesses are to provide a happy and secure upbringing for
their children, while continuing to give a wholehearted commitment to their
public duties'. The prince and princess will continue to carry out public
engagements - sometimes together, as at tomorrow night's state banquet in
Edinburgh for European Community leaders.
The princess will live in Kensington Palace. The prince will stay in
Highgrove House, Gloucestershire, and, when in London, with his grandmother,
the Queen Mother, at Clarence House.
The announcement follows, in the Queen's words, an annus horribilis for the
royal family - dominated by newspaper reports of marital rifts and the
behaviour of its junior members - that has stimulated debate about the
future of the House of Windsor.
After a political row over the cost of the Windsor Castle fire, the Queen
said she would pay income tax and reduce the number of publicly funded
royals.
The separation of Charles and Diana could have wider implications. If either
wanted to divorce, the question of the succession would trigger
constitutional uncertainty not seen since the abdication of King Edward VIII
in 1936.
Downing Street last night refused to comment on 'hypothetical' scenarios. Mr
Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, believes that
the prince will renounce the throne in favour of his eldest son, William.
The idea of a single-parent Queen separated from her husband was greeted
with gasps by MPs. 'There is no possibility of this working,' said Mr
Brooks-Baker.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Taxing the Monarchy: Audit confounded by ritual secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS, PHILIP COGGAN and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE QUEEN'S personal fortune and the income that will be subject to tax are
impossible to estimate accurately because so much secrecy has traditionally
surrounded her accounts. This is unlikely to change even when she starts
paying tax.
Her personal fortune could be as little as Pounds 50m or as much as Pounds
6.5bn, according to estimates published in unofficial surveys.
The huge disparity is caused by the lack of information and by whether the
value of palaces and paintings, technically owned by the monarch, are
included.
The Queen has three primary strands of income:
Income from her personal wealth, which reliable sources say could be around
Pounds 50m. It is already clear that this will be liable to income tax at up
to 40 per cent, and capital gains tax.
The civil list settlement presented to parliament in 1990 which ensures an
income of Pounds 79m between 1990 and 2000, rising by 7.5 per cent a year to
take care of inflation. The Queen's share of the civil list payments is
about Pounds 7.9m. This is not taxed at present, and will not be under the
new regime, as it is regarded as money to cover the Queen's function as head
of state.
The most complex area of the privy purse which includes a mix of public and
private functions, and part of which will probably be taxed. The dividing
lines are still to be devised by the Queen's advisers and the Inland
Revenue.
The proposed changes will also mean that the only members of the royal
family funded directly by the taxpayer will be the Queen, the Duke of
Edinburgh and the Queen Mother. Others will still receive money from the
civil list because they perform public duties, but much more money will be
repaid by the Queen in future.
It is estimated that the Queen at present reimburses the Exchequer by about
Pounds 650,000 a year for minor members of the royal family, and this will
rise by a further Pounds 800,000. This money comes from income and rents
from the Duchy of Lancaster estates owned by the Queen.
The new arrangements, which should be completed in the new year ready to be
introduced at the start of the next tax year in April, follow growing unease
that the monarch pays no personal taxes.
Increasing public clamour over the royal family's financial arrangements has
come to a head following a succession of royal scandals and the disclosure
this week that the taxpayer is to foot the bill for the fire damage at
Windsor Castle, which could reach Pounds 60m.
The pivotal question now will be how much the public will be allowed to know
about the Queen's private income from her shares and property.
She would presumably be entitled, like any individual, to a personal
allowance of Pounds 3,445. After that, the first Pounds 2,000 of her income
would be taxed at 20 per cent, and the next Pounds 21,700 at 25 per cent.
Everything else would be taxable at the top rate of 40 per cent.
Dividend payments are normally taxed (at basic rate) at source and the Queen
has presumably been reclaiming the tax credit to date. It accordingly would
be quite easy to collect the tax on her investment income once her immunity
ended.
Although some estimates have put the Queen's private wealth at as much as
Pounds 6.5bn, Philip Hall in his book Royal Fortune: Tax, Money and the
Monarchy estimates a more conservative figure for investments of Pounds
341m, and annual income of Pounds 18.4m. On that basis, her tax bill would
be just under Pounds 7.35m a year.
Then there is the Queen's rental income from her estates. She would be
allowed to offset costs against this income but according to Richard Law of
accountants Ernst &amp; Young, these costs might be small since the Queen would
not have borrowing costs on the properties.
But there is a further issue. An ordinary employee would face a tax
liability on those perks provided to the Queen, such as rent-free
accommodation and a company car. Presumably the Queen will still be exempt
from tax on these.
Capital gains tax is payable, at the individual's highest tax rate, on
realised gains of over Pounds 5,800 in the current tax year. Investors are
allowed compensation for the effects of inflation on asset prices since
1982.
Should the Queen dispose of any of her art collection, that would also
attract CGT. A CGT liability can be triggered by other events, such as
destruction, which might lead to a tax problem if the Windsor fire were to
recur.
Inheritance tax is payable at a rate of 40 per cent on estates worth more
than Pounds 150,000. There are many vehicles for getting round the tax,
however, such as the use of trusts.
Palace officials have previously justified the fact that the Queen has paid
no taxes on the grounds of tradition. According to Buckingham Palace, 'taxes
are levied in the Queen's name and therefore it would not be appropriate for
the Queen to pay taxes.'
The palace also argues that any cost-to-taxpayer assessment had to include
the benefits brought by tourism and the 'prestige, access and reputation'
that the UK had acquired internationally thanks partly to the presence of
the royal family.

FT  28 NOV 92 / Woman in the News: Exception to the rule - The Queen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Monarchy becomes Elizabeth Windsor. She does the job well. She has outgrown
the natural disadvantages of one who never went to school, never learned to
mix as an equal with others of her own age, and, initially at least, had
little more than formal contact with persons outside the narrow penumbra
that surrounds the royal family.
Five years into her reign, when she was still an apprentice, her speeches
were described by the erstwhile Lord Altrincham (now John Grigg) as prim
little sermons; her style of speaking, he wrote in 1957, was a 'pain in the
neck'. The words that were being put into her mouth were appropriate to 'a
priggish schoolgirl, captain of the hockey team, a prefect, and a recent
candidate for confirmation.'
Mr Grigg's comments caused a furore at the time. An elderly crank hit him.
An Italian monarchist challenged him to a duel. Today that long-forgotten
text should serve the Queen well. The contrast between then and now is to
her advantage. She was a nervous young woman. Her voice and manner were
stilted. Her public demeanour was heavy with responsibility. But 35 years
later she is a mature sovereign, a mother who has suffered as would any
other from the sight of the marital difficulties afflicting her children, a
matron with a long memory and a definite sense of humour.
Her 40 years' experience of public life prepared her for the moment when she
was obliged to come clean, which she did in her celebrated 'annus
horribilis' speech on Tuesday. Yes, she intimated, she did hate it when her
family was pilloried by the media. True, she hinted, it was indeed
unpleasant to be attacked for not paying taxes, or for being so wealthy that
she should have contributed to the cost of rebuilding the burned-out segment
of Windsor Castle.
She was appealing for sympathy but her heartfelt remarks, delivered in the
husky tones brought on by a cold, did not reduce the tabloids to quivering
respect. Those years are gone. Do not blame the messengers: they largely
reflect the sentiments of their readers. In 1952 the young Elizabeth
inherited not only the throne but also the affection in which the nation had
held her father. During the war, class distinctions were forgotten. By his
sharing of their experiences King George VI had won the undiluted allegiance
of the British people. Unexpectedly, he died aged 56. The then Princess
Elizabeth was 26. Not yet ready for coronation, she became Queen-Empress;
her reach stretched around the globe.
Today the Commonwealth means more to its titular head than it does to most
of her subjects. In Britain the monarchy is fondly regarded as a mildly
decaying domestic institution. As such, it is the subject of cartoons, TV
lampoons, commonplace jesting, and, on occasion, the nastier manifestations
of envy. How it is viewed by people in the former colonies, some of which
have discarded it, is a matter of little concern back home. Among the
generality of the Queen's British subjects deference is an outdated notion,
although there is still a tendency to fawn when politicians, or
business-folk, or other distinguished persons are invited to the palace.
Those who seek honour, or recognition, are positively enthralled by contact
with any royal.
The Queen is accustomed to obsequiousness. It is, to her, a natural part of
her life. Yet she shows every sign of enjoying her job, which she takes
seriously. She is proud of remembering many of the names, and recognising
many of the faces, of those of her guests she greets personally. She likes
being flattered, and bowed and curtsied to, and treated as the pivot of the
constitution by a succession of prime ministers, some of whom have sought to
out-Disraeli Disraeli, the Victorian prime minister who wooed his Queen. She
has a strong sense of royal vocation. When there is a matter of state the TV
cameras confirm that her dignity and composure are exemplary.
Her highest duty, as she sees it, is to preserve the monarchy. She had
previously taken advice on how to maintain the affection of the people; this
led to two intimate TV portraits of her family of which the later, a
close-up of the Queen herself, was surely the more appealing. She came
across as a race-horse owner, a countrywoman, a professional monarch with a
twinkle in her eye. But in mid-slump, and with tabloid scandals appearing
every day, that was not good enough. There is no widespread demand for a
republic, but the feeling that people want a less extravagant, less
patronising, less privileged monarchy is palpable. The almost universal
reaction to the Windsor Castle fire last weekend convinced both the
government and the palace that slowly-gestating plans for the Queen to
subject herself to taxation had to be brought forward immediately. She was
ready to be so persuaded by Mr John Major.
The torrent of criticism should now abate, at least for a while. The history
of the monarchy is one of survival by adapting to the pressures of the time.
The events of this week - the Royal cry for help and the Royal decision on
taxation - are fully consonant with that history. Yet the adaptations the
Queen has been obliged to make since 1952 have all served to diminish the
importance, if not the stature, of the institution she personifies. As the
significance of the Commonwealth has shrunk, so has that of the Crown. As
Britain has moved to middle-ranking status, so has its head of state. As the
costs of maintaining a rumbustious extended family have risen, so the esteem
in which the enterprise has been held has dwindled.
During the fifth decade of her reign there may be further changes. The
European Community accommodates monarchies, but the complexities of
membership put into question Britain's highly centralised, unwritten
constitution. Celtic demands for self government may again become vocal. The
Conservatives seem set to hold office indefinitely; single-party government,
exercised in the name of the Crown, cannot be good for democracy. While
Queen Elizabeth is on her throne she will continue to be the British
constitution made flesh. Her successor may be a mere boy on a bicycle.

   An exhibition from Queen Elizabeth II's private
collection of paintings and furniture opened Friday at the Queen's
Gallery in Buckingham Palace.
   The exhibition, to mark the 25th anniversary of the Queen's
Gallery, includes some of the most celebrated works in the royal
collection, the palace said.
   Works have been taken from private corridors and apartments of
Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. Some have been on display at
Hampton Court or on loan to art galleries.
   Masterpieces include paintings by Rembrandt, Bruegel, Vermeer,
Durer, Holbein and Canaletto.

FT  13 AUG 93 / Arts: Driven through palaces - Patricia Morison makes a plea
for more time to stand and stare
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You love looking at great paintings. Should you then go to Buckingham Palace
to see the Queen's pictures? Other things being equal, of course you should
because the Picture Gallery is just wonderful. However, the decision whether
or not to 'do' Buckingham Palace must depend on the time available and sheer
physical stamina. How physically uncomfortable can one be and still derive
pleasure from art?
It could so easily be different, not just at Buckingham Palace but at
cultural monuments everywhere, if only cultural tourism was not focused on
the mass-experience. Although Buckingham Palace is mercifully not quite as
popular as some had projected, there were still 6,000 visitors last
Wednesday, which is a lot for a building not purpose-built as a museum.
You should expect to queue for between 60 and 90 minutes for your ticket; it
is possible to have the whole thing over in a morning if you are near the
front of the queue by around 8am. Luring you on is the thought of the
Picture Gallery where this year there are some dozen splendid masterpieces;
Guercino's 'Libyan Sibyl', Guido Reni's sensual 'Cleopatra', the utterly
chaste Agatha Bas as portrayed by Rembrandt, Rubens's 'Farm at Laeken' and
'St George and the Dragon', together with works by de Hooch, Cuyp, and
Claude Lorrain.
Other rooms have memorable paintings and some surprises, such as finding no
less than three women artists: the Renaissance wonder Sophonisba da
Anguissola; Angelica Kaufmann (her large German duchess has the Throne Room
to herself); and a marble statue of Princess Louise made in 1877 by obscure
Mary Thornycroft.
However, the Picture Gallery is the thing, perhaps above all for the chance
to see together two of the most famous and haunting images of royalty ever
made, Van Dyck's 'Great Piece', Charles I with Henrietta Maria and the two
eldest children, faces the great equestrian portrait of Charles and his
riding master, M. de St Antoine. (The second, larger portrait of the king on
a dun charger is in the National Gallery.)
These monumental paintings would be better seen from much further away, as
the artist intended and as they were at one time displayed in the Van Dyck
Room at Windsor Castle. Even so, it is marvellous to compare these two very
different images of a doomed king. Royalists will find them the more
poignant for being still within palace walls and just a stroll away from the
Banqueting House where Charles's head was struck from his shoulders.
So far, so very good, but the drawback is that visitors have to move in one
direction only. Anyone who wants to look properly must be for ever
criss-crossing the gallery which is a wretched way to see paintings. They
will permit no looping back for a last look, a particular hardship in the
case of Rembrandt's small 'Christ and Mary Magdalene at the Tomb', to my
mind one of the loveliest things he ever did.
On a pragmatic view, the Queen's generosity in lending works from her vast
collection - for example, to The Queen's Pictures at the National Gallery
last year - lessens the urgency of going to the Palace. Both my favourite
Rembrandt and 'Agatha Bas' were widely seen in the 1991 Rembrandt show. The
third terrific Rembrandt, 'The Shipbuilder and his Wife', was shown at
around the same period in the Queen's Gallery beside Buckingham Palace.
For 30 years, the Queen's Gallery has been making the royal collections
accessible, although as a rule its shows are very little publicised. It is
there that you will find Vermeer's 'Lady at the Virginals' in an exhibition
on George III and Consul Smith previously noticed on this page.
Even so, I hope that the Buckingham Palace visit will also become a regular
feature of London's cultural resources, as the summer visit to the Palais du
Roi is in Brussels. (Will public opinion prise open the Prince of
Liechtenstein's collection at Vaduz Castle?) I would also like to see
special access for people who are not interested to flow by, gazing
open-mouthed at the mirrors and chandeliers, but want instead to concentrate
on the art treasures.
Some country houses with important art collections do offer 'connoisseurs'
trips', although not nearly enough. They do at Boughton House in
Northamptonshire, a palatial building of exceptional beauty which is only
open on August afternoons. The intact 17th-century panelled State Rooms with
their tapestries are protected by being shown as part of the longer tour.
I see the royal palaces as a classic example of the need to offer the public
a split-level, sheep-and-goats kind of cultural tourism. Separating the
serious from the faintly curious visitor preserves the quality of the
experience and should become part of the strategy for protecting prime
cultural destinations while actually increasing public access and awareness.
Unfortunately, the sole object of the people who run many tourist venues is
to herd visitors round in droves, adding on so-called 'attractions' which in
reality amount to force-feeding us gimmicky, patronising, low-grade pap.
How great an improvement it would be if, instead, every great castle,
palace, or great house offered a choice of experience. Whether at
Versailles, Wilton House or Castle Howard, there ought to be a 'happy hour'.
Enthusiasts, who may have hankered to see a place for years, could be
assured of the peace to look, savour, and commit the experience to memory.
Of course, the motive for opening Buckingham Palace is financial and not
philanthropic. It might reduce the takings to lay on something special for
people with a serious interest, even though they would be asked to pay
sweetly for the privilege. (I see no reason why a private view of a great
art collection should not cost as much as a good seat at the opera.)
However, there is also the matter of popularity. It is surely no bad
investment if in future years a trip to the palace could be made more
appealing to the Queen's more educated subjects.

   Princess Anne had a brief reunion Tuesday with her
husband of 15 years while a royal aide the tabloids say is
``besotted'' with her remained on duty behind the walls of Windsor
Castle.
   All three kept silent on the questions that grip Britain's
mass-circulation newspapers: Is the marriage of the queen's only
daughter in trouble, and is Timothy Laurence, the royal aide who
wrote four letters to her, the other man in her life?
   Buckingham Palace refused to comment on reports that Laurence, a
handsome 34-year-old bachelor who is a Royal Navy commander, had
offered his resignation to Queen Elizabeth II.
   It said only that the theft of the four letters delivered to The
Sun, Britain's largest-circulation tabloid, was under investigation
by Scotland Yard.
   In a front-page story Tuesday, The Sun quoted unidentified
friends of Laurence as saying he ``is besotted with Princess Anne
and believes she loves him too.''
   Under the banner headline ``Tim `So In Love With Anne','' the
rival Daily Mirror quoted other unidentified friends as saying they
have had long telephone chats at night and have met secretly at a
house in the country.
   Rumors have circulated since 1981 of trouble in the marriage of
Princess Anne, 38, and Mark Phillips, a 40-year-old commoner and
former captain in the Queen's Dragoon Guards. They were brought
together by their love of horses but have led increasingly separate
lives, spending about half of 1988 apart.
   On Sunday and Monday, the princess and Phillips had separate
schedules and did not see each other, then had only a brief reunion
in the early hours of Tuesday.
   She arrived at their Gatcombe Park estate in western England
after midnight Monday and went horseback riding at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
By the time she returned three hours later, Phillips was gone.
   His business agent, Taryn Bennelick, said he was ``somewhere in
Spain.''
   His father, Maj. Peter Phillips, said his son was advising
people who wanted to set up an equestrian center in Spain.
   ``There is no question of him running away,'' said the senior
Phillips, 68. ``One is getting rather fed up with all the
speculation. They have been getting along for the last 10 years
without any problems.''
   Anne kept public engagements in London later Tuesday, including
visits to research projects related to multiple sclerosis and
muscular dystrophy at the National Hospital's Institute of
Neurology.
   Laurence was on duty at Windsor as an equerry, or aide, to the
queen.
   The Sun, which told Scotland Yard it would not reveal the
contents of the letters, quoted one of Laurence's friends Tuesday
as saying:
   ``Obviously, Tim and the princess were physically attracted to
each other, but their friendship goes deeper than that. Tim has
apparently filled a loneliness in her life and given her a shoulder
to cry on when she needed someone to tell her troubles to.
   ``He understands her tantrums and the bad publicity she often
attracts. But most of all, he cares for her in the way she believes
her husband does not.''
   There is royal precedent for divorce. The queen's only sister,
Princess Margaret, divorced Lord Snowden in 1978 and he has
remarried.
   Because Anne is seventh in line to the throne and unlikely to
become queen, a divorce would not threaten the monarchy.

<HEAD>The Artists: Holbein Drawings Together For First Time in Four
Centuries
^EDS: The spelling of Liffe in 13th graf is CORRECT.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HANNS NEUERBOURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BASEL, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After more than 400 years of
separation, Sir Henry and Lady Mary Guildford are temporarily
reunited in Basel.
   Drawings of them are on display in the first joint showing of
the world's two most important collections of the graphic work of
Hans Holbein the Younger, the Basel burgher who became the court
painter of Henry VIII.
   The exhibit comprises 50 drawings from the collection of Queen
Elizabeth II on loan to the Basel Kunstmuseum and the 80 works
normally on display at the museum.
   ``An ancient wish has come true,'' Kunstmuseum director
Christian Gelhaar said at the opening. The exhibition of the 130
works spans a career that made the German-born Holbein the first
portrait painter to achieve international fame.
   It ranges from a study for a double-portrait of a Basel mayor
and his wife, when he was 19, to a drawing of an English nobleman,
done shortly before the artist fell victim, at the age of 46, to a
plague sweeping London in 1543.
   Holbein, a friend of the Dutch scholar and humanist Erasmus,
came to England in 1526 in search of lucrative orders because the
arts were ``freezing'' in Basel, as Erasmus put it.
   Erasmus sent him to Sir Thomas More, the later Chancellor, who
became Holbein's first patron. More's warning that Holbein ``may
not find England such fruitful and fertile land as he had hoped,''
as he wrote Erasmus, was soon disproved.
   Portraits of Henry Guildford, newly-named treasurer of the crown
by Henry VIII, and his wife, were among the key works Holbein did
during a first two-year stay in England. Another was a More family
portrait which has vanished.
   Returning to Basel, Holbein took with him the studies for More's
family portrait, a gift for Erasmus, and for the portrait of Lady
Mary. The painting he did of her is now in Missouri at the St.
Louis Art Museum.
   By that time, Holbein was wealthy enough to buy two houses in
Basel and received well paid commissions. But iconoclastic riots by
fanatic Protestants boded ill for the future of an ambitious artist.
   One of the victims was his altarpiece of the Last Supper, which
was chopped to pieces. Most of the fragments were salvaged,
however, later joined together in an irregular way and even painted
over. At the exhibition the piece returns to public view after more
than two decades of painstaking restoration.
   In 1532, Holbein made England his permanent home, leaving behind
his family and most of his oeuvre to become known, according to an
ancient English biographical note, as ``the greatest Master Truly
(in the arts) after the Liffe that ever was.''
   The 50 drawings on loan through Sept. 4 from Windsor Castle,
make evident that this last period marked the culmination of his
career as a portrait painter.
   They impress visitors by the unerring way in which Holbein
captured the features of his subjects, his sure sense of pattern
and the proficiency with which the left-handed artist worked with
generous strokes of black and colored chalks.
   A few show that even Holbein had his off-days, as Jane Roberts,
curator of the Print Room at Windsor Castle, commented at the
opening.
   Drawing an annual salary of 120 pounds sterling from the court,
he portrayed merchants, scholars, statesmen and, mostly, members of
the court and nobility.
   Many of them were protagonists in a stormy period of English
history that, somewhat surprisingly, seemed to leave Holbein
unperturbed. The Windsor collection includes drawings of Anne
Boleyn, the second wife of Henry VIII who was beheaded in 1536, of
Jane Seymour, the third wife, as well of Baron Rich, whose
testimony led to the execution of Thomas More.
   No preparatory drawing of Henry VIII survived. And what is rated
as Holbein's most masterful portrait of the monarch is in London _
on loan. It is part of the Lugano Collection of Baron Heinrich von
Thyssen-Bornemisza which Britain, like other countries, is bidding
to be the permanent host.

FT  19 MAR 94 / Gardening: English flowers in a class of their own - Trying
to impress a great foreign botanist, Robin Lane Fox finds a sight worth the
journey from St Petersburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
March is behaving madly, which makes life difficult for show-offs. Where do
you take visitors if you want to impress them with English flowers at their
best?
I have just faced this difficulty. I have been trying to impress a great
foreign botanist - not any old European dignitary but one of the senior
plant scientists from Russia, who has seen more fruit trees than you or I
would recognise and knows every botanic garden from the Caucasus to
Vladivostock. A few drifts of narcissus Cragford in long grass would not
make the right impression.
As usual, this early spring is split between towns with clouds of early
blossom and a countryside which has yet to see an anemone in flower. Acid
soil and shelter have hurried along the camellias, but where are
Cornwall-like habitats within easy reach of Oxford?
The answer, this weekend, is at the Savill gardens in Windsor Great Park,
where spring breaks early on a sheltered site. Would it have broken already,
I wondered. The person at the end of the telephone assured me she could see
daffodils the last time she managed to escape from her paperwork.
Vladimir was expecting great things: cravenly, I threw in such sweeteners as
the promise of seeing Windsor castle, royalty at prayer, and a guided tour
round Eton college - the pinnacle, I apologised, of the English class
system. If the camellias failed, we could fall back on boys in tailcoats and
guesses about Princess Margaret's bedroom.
Perhaps it was the promise of narcissi, perhaps it was the class struggle.
But, when we set off, the plan already had a Russian stamp of approval
because two passengers had become five: Vladimir brought along some extra
friends to keep up the numbers.
They had much to teach me, some of which will enliven this column in future:
a post-Stalinist exclusive for the pink FT. Meanwhile, I learnt that there
are great rose beds in the botanic gardens at Yalta; thousands of roses have
been planted down the streets of major Ukrainian towns; and there are vast
orchards of scientific collections around Vladivostock.
To seal an agreement of collaboration, I now have bushes of blackcurrants
(with names such as Delight of Lenin) which have been planted in that last
lingering ash-bed of communism, the gardens of my Oxford college.
On the road to Windsor, Vladimir wanted to tell me about great cherries
which he had visited; one friend wanted to interpret; another wished to tell
all of us (in Russian) about the latest political changes; and the fourth
harangued me on her understanding of relations between ancient Persia and
Greece. Schizophrenically, I wondered if the Savill gardens would rise to
the occasion, or if we would peter out in snapshots of Eton's school yard.
There is no knowing at the turnstile: the gardens are entered through an
extraordinarily ugly gift shop which blots out the style which the late Eric
Savill tried to achieve. The famous meadow beneath it has Britain's finest
sweep of the small Hoop Petticoat daffodils which revel in the damp. A few
dozen were visible, and so I improvised about the millions which were
waiting to emerge. What impressed my convoy most was the meadow's similarity
to the sort of steppe they see in Russia every day.
Beyond the future narcissi, the white-flowered osmanthus delavayi is
flowering freely, but it did not attract comment. The first rhododendrons
were better, including the aptly-named Redwing; the big bushes of the
Falconieri variety looked wonderful to me, but less wonderful to those in
the party who had seen them wild in Bhutan. I was beginning to think it was
time for St George's chapel and the royal dolls' house when we rounded the
path to the garden's furthest dell and my guiding anxieties all passed away.
Go and see it if your own gardens are still emerging from winter. Huge
bushes of all the various corylopsis are smothered in the yellow
bell-flowers which never appear on my soil and old, hybrid camellias are
tangled into a flowering archway where names such as Inspiration are
entwined with Salutation. The rhododendrons are not overpowering and the
trunks of the birches are beautifully white.
Out in the clearing, to the right of a pile of drainpipes, stands a sight
worth the journey from St Petersburg. The small cyclamen-flowered narcissi
are already flowering by the thousand in the wet conditions which their
tubular flowers require. Above them stands a tree of a special magnolia
sprengeri, its hundreds of white and reddish flowers opening flat in the
spring sunshine. They bear the name of Savill, who made this garden out of
unused parkland.
You and I are unlikely to have the soil, or the years of patience, to grow a
magnolia to this size. Visit it instead - and reflect on the appropriate
chance that it was open to welcome St Petersburg's leading botanist on a
visit which could never have been considered when the tree was first put in
place.
We admired the crocuses and felt at home among the Chinese azaleas. By the
time we moved on, it did not seem to matter that the state apartments were
closed and there was scope only for a snapshot of Windsor castle's towers.
The Etonian boys were viewed with wonderment and the buildings made my
visitors feel expressively pro-British.
Magnolias, it seems, are stronger than Marxism and, when we left, we all
felt we had seen something to provide a special memory - one that is greater
than any particular country and common to anyone who responds to flowers.
This weekend, those flowers should still be holding and the gardens will
have even more to show. You do not need a foreign delegation to persuade
yourself that the journey is a justified pleasure on its own terms.

<HEAD>Government Acts to End Annual Row Over Royal Finances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an attempt to end yearly budget-time rows over
the royal allowance, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Tuesday
the royal family will receive a fixed annual increase for the next
decade.
   Such an arrangement was used for about 200 years before 1975.
Then, the government began granting the royal allotment on an
annual basis as part of the national budget.
   The Civil List, as the payment is known, will rise at about 7.5
percent per year for the next decade, Mrs. Thatcher said.
   She said the royal family is ``a focus of patriotism, loyalty,
affection and esteem. It is a rare combination and we should value
it.''
   Behind her move was the wish to avoid the annual budget-day
``pay rise'' announcement, which both politicians and the royal
family found unseemly. Anti-monarchists used the budget
announcement as a chance to attack the expense of maintaining the
royals.
   Under the 1990 budget, the royal allowance totalled about $12.1
million. Queen Elizabeth II received the lion's share at $9.26
million.
   The Civil List officially repays the monarch and 10 other
members of her family for official duties. About 70 percent of the
money goes to salaries and employment costs for royal staff.
   The queen has 250 permanent full-time employees, including those
in her private office, the Buckingham Palace press office staff and
those responsible for ceremonial duties.
   Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, is not on the Civil
List. He receives undisclosed income from royal estates.
   Opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock applauded the new
arrangement and said it would ``provide for greater continuity and
more effective planning in the financing of the royal household.''
   Meanwhile, the queen has recruited a leading London accountant
to help run her households more efficiently.
   Michael Peat, 40, a partner in the accounting firm of Peat
Marwick McLintock, was named the royal household's director of
finance and property services. He will oversee the management of
Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, St. James Palace and Kensington
Palace.

<HEAD>Soviet Leader Ends Goodwill Tour By Inviting Queen To Moscow</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ended a
six-day tour of Ireland, Cuba and Britain by announcing nuclear
cutbacks and inviting Queen Elizabeth II to visit Moscow.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Friday that the queen gave
``a very definite yes,'' but that no date had been set.
   She would be the first British sovereign to visit the Soviet
Union since the 1917 revolution. Her Russian ancestors _ the family
of Czar Nicholas II _ were slain by revolutionaries eight decades
ago.
   Gorbachev's invitation to the queen indicated his success in
winning Mrs. Thatcher's trust. In addition, televised pictures of
the Gorbachevs being escorted around Windsor Castle by the
63-year-old queen and her husband, Prince Philip, further warmed
the royalty-loving British to the Soviet leader.
   Despite the invitation and the cordiality, Mrs. Thatcher and
Gorbachev disagreed on issues of nuclear disarmament and the
balance of East-West forces in Europe.
   Mrs. Thatcher, moreover, downplayed the importance of the Soviet
leader's promise to halt production of weapons-grade uranium and
shut down two more plutonium-producing reactors by the end of 1990.
   Nevertheless, she declared Gorbachev's third visit to Britain
``very successful, warm and friendly,'' echoing his assertion that
it had strengthened British-Soviet ties.
   The Gorbachevs' 40-hour British stay ended with a day steeped in
pageantry.
   The president gave an unusually brief, 27-minute speech in the
splendid setting of London's Guildhall, the 1,000-year-old seat of
city government filled with city leaders in wigs and robes.
   In remarks broadcast live in Britain and the United States,
Gorbachev called his proposals for cutting production of
radioactive material ``another major step toward the complete
cessation of production of fissionable materials for use in nuclear
weapons.''
   However, Mrs. Thatcher later ascribed little importance to the
moves, saying existing Soviet stockpiles would mean the cutbacks
``will have no effect in practice.'' A U.S. Defense Department
official said the weapons reactors could be started when the Soviet
military runs low.
   The Soviet step followed Gorbachev's December announcement to
the United Nations that the Soviet Union would soon cut 500,000
soldiers from its standing army and withdraw troops and tanks from
European and Chinese frontiers.
   Gorbachev lauded Britain for unilaterally eliminating chemical
weapons stocks. He said his country had built a facility for
destroying its own chemical weapons, and he would soon invite
British experts to inspect it.
   The president also said the West should drop plans to modernize
short-range nuclear missiles, but Mrs. Thatcher maintained a
nuclear deterrent was essential.
   After lunch at Windsor Castle, the Gorbachevs were driven to
London's Heathrow Airport, where they flew home to Moscow.

<TEXT>
   Papa looked very beautiful in his crimson robe,
but there was a terrible draft in Westminster Abbey, wrote the
little princess after her parents' coronation in 1937.
   The childhood essay of Queen Elizabeth II gets its first public
showing beginning Friday in the Queen's Gallery, where royal
treasures are displayed at Buckingham Palace.
   It's part of 271 exhibits called ``A Royal Miscellany'' showing
through Jan. 13, 1991.
   The exhibition includes everything from clocks and jewelry to
the embroidered linen overshirt worn by King Charles I as he knelt
to the headsman's ax in 1649.
   Visitors can view a lock of French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's
hair, a watercolor of Balmoral royal estate by Prince Charles, and
a copy of the Mainz Psalter _ a 1457 German collection of prayers
that was the first book printed in more than one color.
   Among the displays are the neat, proper letters of the
11-year-old princess Elizabeth. They are written in a lined
exercise book that would have cost tuppence, four cents at that
time.
   ``I thought it all very, very wonderful and I expect the Abbey
did, too. The arches and beams at the top were covered with a sort
of haze of wonder as Papa was crowned, at least I thought so,''
wrote the princess.
   Elizabeth, her sister Princess Margaret and their widowed
grandmother Queen Mary had a grandstand view of the ceremony from a
royal box in the abbey, where Elizabeth herself would be crowned in
1953.
   ``What struck me as being rather odd was that Grannie did not
remember much of her own coronation. I should have thought that it
would have stayed in her mind forever,'' Princess Elizabeth wrote.
   However, toward the end, the child found the service becoming
``rather boring'' as it was all prayers.
   ``Grannie and I were looking to see how many more pages to the
end, and we turned one more and then I pointed to the word at the
bottom of the page and it said `Finis.' We both smiled at each
other and turned back to the service,'' she wrote.
   ``The princess was probably asked by her tutor to record her
impressions of the coronation,'' said Oliver Everett, director of
the Royal Library at Windsor Castle, the favorite royal residence
21 miles west of London.
   Everett, a former diplomat, selected the essay and 270 other
items for the exhibition.
   ``The library is closed to the public, but the queen takes her
guests there. As the castle is being rewired and repaired, guests
cannot be shown round so we took the opportunity to send some
interesting things to the gallery,'' Everett said in an interview
at Wednesday's preview.
   Even the prophetic thoughts of King George III after the British
defeat by the American colonists in 1781 are displayed: ``America
is lost! Must we fall beneath this blow?'' he wrote.
   But he was consoled by the thought that ``it is to be hoped we
shall reap more advantages from their trade as friends than ever we
could derive from them as Colonies.''

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrived
Wednesday night from Cuba for a 40-hour visit that will mix hard
talk on human rights with traditional British pageantry.
   Flying from the sweltering Caribbean into freezing British rain
at Heathrow Airport, Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, got a
red-carpet welcome with a royal military band. Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher welcomed them with a warm smile on the tarmac
after the plane touched down at 11 p.m.
   After the Soviet national anthem was played, Gorbachev and Mrs.
Thatcher walked briskly under a pink umbrella past the honor guard
of the Royal Air Force. ``Natural massage,'' Gorbachev joked of the
rain.
   Gorbachev and Mrs. Thatcher made no statement before driving
together to the Soviet Embassy residence in London to chat over
coffee. Mrs. Gorbachev rode with Mrs. Thatcher's husband, Denis.
   Thatcher aides said the two leaders, accompanied by their
foreign ministers, toasted each other at the Soviet ambassador's
residence. ``The atmosphere was very good. They were very pleased
to see each other,'' said the aide, who spoke on condition he was
not identified.
   But they also got down to business, discussing Afghanistan and
southern Africa, British officials said. On the Feb. 15 withdrawal
of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, Mrs. Thatcher told Gorbachev he
``had fulfilled his promise before the world to depart.''
   About 100 people campaigning for Jewish refuseniks demonstrated
peacefully at an entrance to Kensington Palace Gardens where the
Soviet Embassy is housed. Gorbachev and Mrs. Thatcher arrived at
another entrance.
   Gorbachev's visit, which includes a lunch with Queen Elizabeth
II at Windsor castle, is a major step in Gorbachev's overtures to
Western Europe. But while Britain is laying on the sort of lavish
reception it used to reserve for its special allies, there were
signs of official anxiety that the Gorbachev charm is working too
well.
   Thursday was set aside for 2{ hours of talks at Mrs. Thatcher's
10 Downing St. residence, followed by a wreath-laying ceremony at
Westminster Abbey, a visit to a high-tech factory outside London
and a Downing Street banquet.
   Officials say Anglo-Soviet relations have never been better
since World War II, and Mrs. Thatcher, interviewed on Soviet TV
Wednesday, had warm words for Gorbachev. She recalled a previous
meeting at which she felt as though Gorbachev was trying to point
``a giant searchlight into the future.''
   ``I had a deep instinct that it was the beginning of a quite new
relationship,'' she said. ``He had this great vision... it really
has far more in common with the system we have worked toward over
the years and which has given us our prosperity and our freedom.''
   But the Thatcher government is also issuing pointed reminders
about Soviet human rights abuses and military might, and charges
that KGB agents are still spying and the Kremlin is still too
secretive about its chemical weapons.
   A full-page advertisement signed by 212 of the 650 members of
the House of Commons appeared in Wednesday editions of The Times of
London, urging Britain to boycott a human rights conference in
Moscow in 1991 unless Gorbachev measures up to a ``checklist.''
   ``Freedom to emigrate; freedom of religious and cultural
expression; freedom from discrimination; freedom of all prisoners
of conscience; freedom of speech; freedom to monitor these basic
rights,'' said the list.
   Nevertheless, opinion polls in Europe suggest Gorbachev's charm
offensive is getting results.
   A Market Opinion and Research International poll in Wednesday's
Times showed that only 17 percent of Britons consider the Soviet
Union a threat, compared with 42 percent in 1981.
   Only 35 percent of the 2,025 people questioned believed the
Kremlin wants to extend its power over other countries, down from
70 percent in 1981.
   Mrs. Thatcher first met Gorbachev in 1984, when he was the No.
2, and declared, ``I like Mr. Gorbachev. We can do business
together.''
   Since then, Gorbachev appears to have forged a warm relationship
with the doctrinaire anti-communist once dubbed ``The Iron Lady''
by the Kremlin.
   She visited Moscow in 1987, and Gorbachev was to have come to
London in December, but canceled the trip because of the Armenian
earthquake.
   Soviet officials have been on British radio and TV all week
talking about Gorbachev's reforms and the dawn of a new era in
East-West relations.
   The Gorbachevs will have lunch Friday with the queen, arriving
at Windsor Castle in a procession of carriages and cavalry escorts.
The elite Coldstream Guards will serve as guard of honor.
   Beforehand Gorbachev will give a major speech in the splendid
setting of London's ancient Guildhall, seat of city government for
1,000 years.
   Mrs. Gorbachev will go sightseeing with Education Secretary
Kenneth Baker, taking in landmarks such as St. Paul's Cathedral and
Tower Bridge.

   These twin exhibitions commemorate the 400th anniversary
of the birth of the Italian baroque painter Giovanni
Francesco Barbieri, known as Guercino. "Master Painter of the
Baroque," the first American exhibition devoted to the
artist's paintings, consists of 60 works. Highlights include
"Susanna and the Elders" (1617), from the Prado; and "Apollo
Flaying Marsyas" (1618), from the Palazzo Pitti in Florence.
The drawings on view in the accompanying show are from the
collection of Queen Elizabeth II at the Royal Library,
Windsor Castle. Included are a number of preparatory sketches
for paintings in the first show.
   National Gallery of Art: Fourth Street at Constitution
Avenue NW. Through May 17. (202) 737-4215.
   "Drawings From Windsor Castle," which was seen at the

<HEAD>Intruder Arrested In Buckingham Palace Mews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drunken youth penetrated security devices
designed to protect the royal family and was arrested about 200
yards from Buckingham Palace, Scotland Yard said early Monday.
   The Yard, headquarters of the metropolitan police, said the
incident occurred Sunday morning. It said no further action was
planned against the youth, who was released after being cautioned
for being drunk and disorderly.
   The Yard declined to give the youth's name, address or age. It
also would not detail how he got into the royal mews, which serves
as stable and garage for Queen Elizabeth II's 30 carriage horses,
coaches and cars.
   He was arrested in the mews, about 200 yards from the palace.
   The mews is normally entered from Buckingham Palace Road through
a huge pair of doors set in a high wall topped with spikes, barbed
wire, alarms and remote control cameras.
   The palace said the queen was not at Buckingham Palace at the
time of the intrusion.
   She was at Windsor Castle, 21 miles west of London, where the
royal family often prefers to spend weekends.
   Security at 650-room Buckingham Palace and its 45 acres of
grounds was improved after an unemployed drifter, Michael Fagan,
climbed a drainpipe in 1982 to reach the queen's bedroom, sat on
her bed and spoke to her before he was nabbed.
   A jury found Fagan innocent of stealing a bottle of Californian
wine which he drank during a break-in at the palace earlier in
1982. He was never charged with breaking in to the palace because
it was regarded as trespassing, a civil offense, and the palace
wouldn't take him to court.

   ALL THE Queen's troubles
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
from the row over her tax position and the future of the monarchy to fires
at Windsor Castle, from rumours about Royal marriages to an early winter
cold - provoked a unregal admission of humility yesterday.
She told an audience at Guildhall in the City of London that 1992 had, in
fact, been, an 'annus horribilis'.
In a rare appeal for personal sympathy, the Queen suggested to her critics
that scrutiny 'can be just as effective if it is made with a touch of
gentleness, good humour and understanding'.
But her speech, at a lunch celebrating the 40th anniversary of her reign,
may instead mark a low point in the fortunes of the House of Windsor.
An ITN poll this week showed 76 per cent believe the cost of the royal
family should be cut, while 61 per cent would restrict the publicly-funded
members of the royal family to just the Queen, Prince Charles and the Queen
Mother.
The Queen said that 'there can be no doubt, of course, that criticism is
good for people and institutions that are part of public life. No
institution, City, monarchy, whatever, should expect to be free from the
scrutiny of those who give it their loyalty and support - not to mention
those who don't'
She added: 'This sort of questioning can also act . . . as an effective
engine for change.'
Speaking to an audience that included the prime minister and Mr John Smith,
Labour leader, the Queen said: '1992 is not a year on which I shall look
back with undiluted pleasure. In the words of one of my more sympathetic
correspondents, it has turned out to be an 'annus horribilis'. I suspect
that I am not alone.'
Her short speech had been brought forward from after lunch to before because
her voice was weakened by a cold.
Afterwards, her most vociferous critics showed little more understanding. Mr
Tony Banks, Labour MP for Newham North West and a noted republican, said: 'I
know people in my constituency who can genuinely say it has been a bad year.
I don't believe she has had her house repossessed.'
But Mr Toby Jessel, Tory MP for Twickenham, said that there was 'far too
much malice and envy around'.
And, proving that the Queen still commands a majority among Her Majesty's
opposition as well as her government, Mr John Smith said: 'She is entitled
to defend herself and she did it rather wittily and rather charmingly - it
is probably true that she has had a horrible year.'

<HEAD>Queen Mother's Visit To London's East End Recalls Britain at War</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The woman who brought a queen's comfort to the
bomb-shattered East End during World War II returned to the rebuilt
district Wednesday to celebrate her 90th birthday.
   Nearly 50 years after the German blitz, the presence of Queen
Elizabeth the Queen Mother rekindled warm memories of a bitter time.
   During the war years, the then-Queen Elizabeth picked her way
through the rubble in high heels and the pastel dresses she still
favors today, offering words of ecouragement to East Enders. They
still remember.
   ``She really did cheer us up. People were down in their depths
at the time,'' said Myrtle Lester, who as an 11-year-old spent long
hours in a damp backyard bomb shelter.
   The visit to the East End was a sentimental high point in four
months of parades and pageants leading up to the birthday on
Saturday of the ``Queen Mum,'' as she is fondly known.
   She arrived in the riverside district aboard the royal yacht
Britannia, wearing a light blue dress and matching hat with a wispy
veil, a string of pearls and a beaming smile.
   Elderly East Enders mingled with youngsters waving Union Jacks
who turned out to greet her. Alice Poyser, 69, said she remembered
well the wartime visits of the queen and King George VI.
   ``We were pleased to see her. It felt like a mother talking to
us,'' she said. Mrs. Poyser said her family was bombed out of three
successive homes.
   Several people in the crowd recalled the queen's words after
Buckingham Palace was hit by a bomb: ``I'm glad we've been bombed.
It makes me feel I can look the East End in the face.''
   During the war, Prime Minister Winston Churchill advised her to
go to Canada for safety. She ignored him, and took lessons at
Buckingham Palace on how to use a rifle.
   Her daughters _ Elizabeth, now the queen, and Princess Margaret
_ stayed at Windsor Castle, 21 miles west of London, during the
conflict.
   The East End's shattered docks and factories have been replaced
by a huge redevelopment project that has brought new homes, shops
and offices.
   The Queen Mother unveiled a plaque honoring 76 people killed by
a bomb and revisited the shelters underneath All Saints' Church,
itself a bombing casualty in 1945. She also saw some of those she
met during wartime.
   Wednesday night, she was to be guest of honor at a birthday
dinner on the Britannia given by the queen and Prince Philip,
followed by fireworks over the Tower of London.
   The Queen Mother was born Aug. 4, 1900. Lady Elizabeth Angela
Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was the ninth child of the Earl and Countess
of Strathmore, whose family home was Glamis Castle in Scotland.
   In 1923 she married the Duke of York, second of four surviving
sons of King George V.
   She became queen, quite unexpectedly, when the duke's elder
brother, Edward, abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee
Wallis Warfield Simpson.
   Biographers say the Queen Mother never recovered from her
husband's early death from lung cancer in 1952. She still refers to
him as ``the king'' and declines public appearances on the
anniversaries of his birth, marriage and death.
   Despite her age, the Queen Mother is still one of the most
active royals. Only the queen and Princess Anne make more public
appearances.

FT  27 NOV 92 / Queen will start to pay income tax from April: Decision seen
as move towards a smaller, European-style monarchy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEEN ELIZABETH II has heralded the most sweeping reform of the British
monarchy since her accession 40 years ago by agreeing to pay income tax and
to support financially all but three members of her family.
Her decision amounts to a move towards a smaller continental European-style
monarchy. It was announced by Mr John Major just two days after the Queen
hinted that she recognised public dissatisfaction over the cost - and
behaviour - of her family. The prime minister said the move came at her
initiative.
The Queen is said to be the richest woman in the world with investments
alone estimated at Pounds 50m. From next April she will pay tax on her
private income at the 40 per cent top rate. She will probably also pay
inheritance and capital gains tax - but under arrangements still to be
decided because normally her wealth could be wiped out on her death.
Discussions are taking place between the Treasury, the Inland Revenue and
the Royal Household before a fuller statement early next year. The Prince of
Wales is likely to pay more tax on income from the Duchy of Cornwall. After
escaping paying the poll tax, the Queen will pay the council tax on her
Sandringham and Balmoral homes.
From next year only the Queen, the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh
will be paid incomes out of the 'civil list' voted by parliament. At present
the Queen receives Pounds 7.9m, the Queen Mother Pounds 643,000 and the Duke
of Edinburgh Pounds 359,000 from the civil list.
The salaries drawn by five other members of the royal family will be
reimbursed to the public purse. Buckingham Palace said the five - the
Queen's three younger children, her sister Princess Margaret, and her
90-year-old aunt Princess Alice - will go on performing public duties.
Although the Inland Revenue will keep details of royal finances secret, as
for any taxpayer, and even though taxes were paid by Queen Victoria, George
V and Edward VII, the move marks a watershed for the monarchy.
It was seen at Westminster as an attempt to restore the monarchy's
reputation after, in the Queen's words, an annus horribilis dominated by
rumours about royal marriages and rows over its extravagance. The political
debate over who should pay to restore the fire-damaged Windsor Castle may
have led to the changes being announced.
Moreover, the Queen, in whose name the Inland Revenue collects taxes has
become liable herself. Mr Rhodri Morgan, MP for Cardiff West, said she could
have created an extra 25 jobs for tax inspectors at the Inland Revenue's
high-security unit in Cardiff.
The announcement came in pre-scripted exchanges in the Commons between Mr
Major and Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, who had been briefed on Tuesday.
Mr Smith asked the prime minister if, 'in view of the evident public
concern', he had had discussions with the Queen about her finances.
Mr Major replied that 'affection and respect' for the monarch were
widespread and the sovereign was not liable to pay tax on her personal
income. 'But Her Majesty some months ago, before the summer recess,
indicated to me that she wished consideration to be given to changing these
arrangements.'
The Queen will not be taxed on sums voted by MPs to cover costs of items
such as royal flights and trains, which totalled Pounds 57m last year. But
she will pay tax on private income from the Duchy of Lancaster. The Prince
of Wales already pays tax on his private income and voluntarily contributes
25 per cent of income from the Duchy of Cornwall.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Behind the Queen's curtains: Buckingham Palace opens to the
public today. Antony Thorncroft took the tour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'They've lowered their guard at Buckingham Palace.
The press poured in, bereft of malice.'
I HAVE never seen such a subdued hack pack. The opening of most of the
finest state apartments at Buckingham Palace to the public from today seems
likely to re-establish the gap between sovereign and subjects. Nowhere in
the kingdom, nowhere in the world, is such a concentrated collection of
masterpieces displayed in such an exalted residential setting.
And since the monarchy is mainly theatre, the tour is a masterpiece of
dramatic timing. It begins pianissimo. If you dared speak in the
well-regulated splendour you might remark that the Grand Hall is quite
small, almost domestic, and the Grand Staircase scarcely over-powering.
But even in these foothills there are the clues to the secret of Buckingham
Palace. It is a shrine to ancestor worship. The walls of the staircase are
covered with portraits of Queen Victoria's forbears and family, both the
rogues, like her father, the Duke of York, and the characters, like the Duke
of Sussex in a kilt.
The palace is one monumental family album, with the same faces, especially
its founder George IV and his amiable mother, Queen Charlotte, looking down
in myriad guises. Sometimes the family are in fancy dress - there is Prince
Albert carved as a Roman soldier; sometimes they are pitiful - as in a
portrait of the apotheosis of the short-lived princes, Octavius and Alfred,
on their way to heaven; sometimes humanity peeps through, as in the portrait
of Queen Victoria at her coronation, a tiny apprehensive porcelain doll
receiving the hurrahs of her confident subjects.
No one is forgotten. There is a tiny octagonal vestibule given over to
portraits of Queen Victoria's daughters-in-law. The only members of the
family mysteriously absent are the Queen and her immediate relatives.
As soon as you reach the first floor you are thrown another dramatic theme:
this building is about majesty. Everything, every object, every vista, every
cornice, every fabric, proclaims wealth and splendour. You quickly accept
that the palace contains the finest collection of Sevres porcelain;
unequalled examples of French 18th century furniture by Weisweiler, Carlin,
and Reisener; and a picture collection stuffed with Rubens, Rembrandts, and
Van Dycks. Amid such ornate decoration the actual Throne Room can dare to be
quite sparse, bereft of thrones, but with two comfortable looking chairs
embroidered with an 'EII' and a 'P'.
After a surfeit of decorative grandeur the Picture Gallery becomes almost
pedestrian. I thought it one of the least successful rooms, with its
shrimp-pink wall-covering, grills to the electric fires barely hidden inside
marble, and the worthiness of the collection, the 18th century's homage to
the artists of the 17th. There are splendid things, the Rembrandt portrait
of Agatha Bas; the Rubens of St George; the Cuyp of a negro page. But you
look in vain for a decorative splash, something French and glitzy. It will
look better when the Canalettos return.
Having lulled the visitor into a dreamy acceptance of the luxurious the tour
ends with a jolt in the finest and happiest rooms, all designed by Nash,
with plenty of quirky detail. There is the extraordinary sculpted memorial
to that arch republican Milton in the Blue Drawing Room; the critical line
of portraits in the State Dining Room (bereft of its table and silver); the
fake door of looking glass and pier table in the White Drawing Room through
which the royal family materialises to startle its guests.
Then there is a lowering again as you descend to the Marble Hall, almost a
feeling of returning to a nether world after observing the glory of the
gods. It is a hushed finale.
Of course these are state apartments, absent of any manifestation of a
living majesty. But through the windows of the charming Music Room you see a
red-coated servant keeping a wary eye on three waddling corgies, and as you
stroll through the garden to the exit you call at the shop and buy the
chocolates, crockery and videos, plus the excellent guide to the palace
prepared by Apollo magazine, which, with the Pounds 8 entry fee, will help
the Queen raise approaching Pounds 3m in the next eight weeks towards the
restoration of Windsor Castle.
The palace, so austere from the outside, offers a stunning, unsettling
surfeit of an experience, eased by the charm of the attendants.

FT  26 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs propose study of palace costs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INQUIRY into the costs of maintaining royal palaces such as Windsor
Castle, which was partly destroyed by fire last week, was proposed last
night by a cross-party Commons committee.
The public accounts committee has asked Sir John Bourn, comptroller and
auditor general, to consider launching a 'value for money' study into the
Department of National Heritage and Royal Palaces owned by the state.
However, in spite of pressure from some Labour MPs, the committee has
decided that it will not - at least at this stage - look at wider issues of
the financing of the Royal Family and whether the Queen should pay tax. The
committee's responsibilities, in conjunction with the comptroller and
auditor-general, are traditionally to ensure efficiency in Whitehall.
In a private meeting last night, MPs on the public accounts committee
discussed the possibility of a wider inquiry into the Royal Family's
finances but no agreement was reached.
