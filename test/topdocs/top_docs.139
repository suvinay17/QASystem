   Felix Wankel, inventor of the rotary
engine, has died at age 86.
   Wankel died on Sunday, said Thomas Burkhardt, a close friend of
the German inventor.
   Wankel began work on a rotary engine in 1926 and began producing
the new motor at the West German NSU Motor Works in 1957.
   Through the years, Wankel also designed motors for the Japanese
auto companies Mazda and Toyota, as well as engine superchargers.
   The West German NSU Spider was the first car to be mass-produced
with the Wankel rotary engine, that was in 1964. The now-defunct
NSU company also produced the RO 80 Wankel rotary engine car, which
had a reputation for unreliability and was discontinued in 1977.
   There was much interest in Wankel's rotary engine in the 1960s
and early 1970s. According to West German automobile industry
figures, in 1971 Wankel was working with 24 different companies
around the world on plans to further develop his engine.
   But the first oil crisis of 1973-74 changed all that, bringing a
drastic loss of interest in investing in the automobile industry,
experts say.
   Mazda continued work on developing the Wankel rotary engine and
made the concept a successful one.
   According to industry figures, Mazda has produced more than 1.5
million cars with rotary engines including the popular RX-7 sports
car.
   In 1976 Wankel also developed a streamlined amphibious car he
called ``Zisch,'' German for ``whoosh,'' which was able to reach 62
mph with its 300 horsepower engine.
   Wankel's research offices are in Lindau, on the shores of Lake
Constance in southern West Germany.
   Wankel's wife died in 1978. They had no children.

   Like any car that has been around for a decade, the Mazda RX-7
has changed. The car is wider and more expensive. The outside
styling is more rounded, and the RX-7 has been transformed from a
spirited scooter to a more substantial sports car.
   But thankfully, some of the best features remain: the durable,
smooth rotary engine, the sporty handling and nimble responsiveness,
and the rear-drive design.
   The performance of the Mazda RX-7 GTUs test car clearly showed
that many of the selective changes over the years have helped keep
the RX-7 a viable competitor in the sports car field.
   The engine in the test car, teamed with five-speed manual
transmission, started easily and worked smoothly in both city and
highway driving. The GTUs is not the fastest sports car around, with
a rating of 7.7 seconds to go from 0 to 60 mph, but it had plenty of
good, steady zip. And there's a higher-priced, turbocharged RX-7
model that offers even quicker acceleration.
   I also appreciated the fact that the rear-drive design meant
there was no torque steer under hard acceleration as there is in so
many front-drive sporty cars. Though I noticed that the test car
gulped down the fuel, I was impressed by the high-revving rotary
engine, especially knowing it has earned a reputation for
reliability.
   A Mazda spokesman noted that RX-7s ``have done extraordinarily
well in endurance-related racing.'' Consumer Reports also ranks
highly the RX-7s of the 1982-87 model years. They consistently
earned a much better than average label in the magazine's survey of
car owners.
   The Mazda spokesman mentioned the loyalty among many RX-7 owners.
With about 41,000 members, the RX-7 clubs around the country are
rank as one of the largest collection of clubs honoring a single car
marque.
   Fit and finish on the test car was superb. The ventilation system
was powerful, and the seats _ redesigned for 1989 with more lateral
support _ were firm and sturdy, which I appreciated as I got
accustomed to the car's hard, sporty ride.
   There was only room for two in the GTUs test car, though Mazda
offers a two-plus-two GXL model.
   Behind the two front seats in the test car were two deeply
recessed storage boxes with locks followed by a flat hatchback area
with luggage straps to keep items from sliding around. The hatchback
lid popped all the way up with a touch of a lever that was to the
lower left of the driver seat.
   However, I found it a bit awkward to bend over the back of the
car body and reach way inside the hatchback area. Yet because of the
hatchback's sloping lid, the taller items I carried always had to be
placed up front, behind the seats, which also was the hardest spot
to get at.
   The RX-7 GTUs comes with automatic shoulder belts that were the
most sensitive _ and comforting _ I've seen. If I suddenly tried to
reach for the glove box, or even move forward to look to the right,
that driver belt would hold me in.
   The dashboard layout was clear, easy to read, with no digital
gadgets. The blinker was a little lever on the dashboard, like that
in the Ford Probe, and the lights that warn that the brake is on,
the hatch is open or that something is wrong under the hood were
uniquely grouped next to the clock in the middle of the dash.
   The RX-7, at $6,995 for its April 1978 debut in the United
States, was a mid-priced sports car in its early days and still
holds that position, though its price range today is from $17,300 to
$25,600.
   A Mazda spokesman said competitors include Toyota MR2, which
starts around $14,000, and the Chevrolet Corvette, which starts
around $31,000.
   Partly because of the higher prices for sports cars, partly
because of increased competition from sporty coupes that offer
seating for more than two passengers, and partly because of rising
insurance costs, sales of the RX-7 have been declining. They hit
56,205 in 1986, then fell to 38,345 in 1987 and 27,814 in 1988,
Mazda said. Sales of about 20,000 are expected this year.
   Because of the increase in insurance costs, some buyers are being
quoted prices for insurance on their sports cars that are higher
than their monthly car payments, a Mazda spokesman said.
   A typical RX-7 buyer has median age of 36, according to Rod
Bymaster, product manager of sports and sporty cars for Mazda Motor
of America. Sixty-five percent of RX-7 buyers are male, and half are
married, he said. Sixty-seven percent have a college degree or more,
and the median household income is between $55,000 and $60,000.
   Though Mazda now is promoting its newest two-seat car _ the
Miata, which starts at $13,800 _ the company said the RX-7 will
remain. The Miata is coming into the lower end of the sports car
market because the RX-7 has moved upscale, a spokesman explained.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: Hydrogen car moves on to the
horizon - John Griffiths finds Mazda pushing ahead with an emission-free
fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mazda, Japan's fourth largest car maker, is shortly to seek Japanese
government approval for an on-highway test programme for hydrogen-powered
cars, whose exhaust 'fumes' consist of non-polluting steam.
The company has concluded that hydrogen-powered cars are technically
achievable more quickly than is commonly believed within the industry.
Over the coming months, it plans to start negotiations with Californian
state authorities on making hydrogen cars acceptable under the strict new
exhaust emissions legislation that California is phasing in from 1997
onwards, and to explore possible systems for refuelling them.
Part of the Californian legislation, which is being considered for adoption
by up to a dozen other states, requires 2 per cent of manufacturers' sales
to be of 'zero emission vehicles' from 1998, rising to 10 per cent by the
early 21st century.
Virtually the entire motor industry has accepted the fact that the
legislation's time scale can only be met with battery-powered cars.
But while Mazda has already developed its own battery cars to meet the
legislation, Michinori Yamanouchi, senior managing director of Mazda Motor
Corporation, says that electric vehicles in general will be far too
expensive and limited in their performance to have anything but a restricted
future as urban runabouts or light commercial vehicles.
According to Mazda, the Wankel rotary petrol engine - which it, alone among
car makers, now produces - can be adapted more easily than conventional
petrol engines to run on hydrogen. Cars fitted with it could reach the
marketplace for a price about 20 per cent higher than a petrol-powered
equivalent - 'in other words for about the cost of air conditioning and
audio equipment', says Yamanouchi.
In contrast, he says, 'we estimate that even if electric vehicle technology
really advanced, their price would be twice that of a gasolene car at
minimum. And that price ratio would be the same even if a manufacturer were
to be making 10,000 units a month'.
Mazda is by no means alone in researching hydrogen-fuelled cars. Mercedes
and BMW of Germany are among those which have produced prototypes.
However, difficulties with combustion in adapted, conventional reciprocating
engines and on-board fuel storage, and scepticism about the ease with which
a hydrogen manufacturing and refuelling infrastructure could be set up have
led most manufacturers to suggest that viable hydrogen cars are still years
off.
According to Mr Yamanouchi, the design of the rotary engine eliminates the
premature combustion problems normally associated with using hydrogen as a
fuel in conventional engines.
Mazda has also launched a collaborative project with Nippon Steel
Corporation, Japan's largest steel maker, to set up a pipeline fuelling
supply system for the test programme, using as the feedstock hydrogen from
one of Nippon Steel's manufacturing plants, where hydrogen is a major but
mostly wasted by-product.
Yamanouchi expects the steel industry to be a future producer and marketer
of hydrogen in its own right.
Chemical plants, which generate hydrogen as a by-product, could be also
harnessed to localised supply networks. In Japan there will be a network of
hydrogen fuelling stations by the early 21st century, he predicts.
Mazda's vision of a fuelling infrastructure for hydrogen is based on it
being in gaseous form. BMW, in contrast, has based its prototype on the use
of hydrogen in liquid form, requiring insulation of both fuelling system and
the vehicle's fuel tank to allow temperatures close to absolute zero.
'If the determination is there, we can set up hydrogen pumps and pipelines
fairly easily in terms of technology and finance,' Yamanouchi says.
He is also relatively dismissive of concerns about the safety aspects of
hydrogen, should it leak into a boot interior, for example. It is
undetectable by sight or smell, but Yamanouchi insists that, being lighter
than air, it would disperse quickly - and it possesses a combustion point
higher than gasolene.
Mazda regards the biggest problem as how to store the hydrogen in sufficient
volumes in the vehicle. Its solution, adopted also for the prototype
Mercedes fleet, is a fuel tank filled with a metallic hydride capable of
soaking up large quantities of gaseous hydrogen and re-releasing it when
heated.
Fitting enough hydrogen into the tank is still a problem, however, as it is
a much less dense fuel than gasolene. Nevertheless, one prototype has
achieved continuous running for 200km at maximum speeds of 150kph.
Yamanouchi's predicts that in 30 years, petrol or diesel-powered cars will
account for just 10 per cent of the world's total car output, having been
supplanted mainly by hydrogen cars but also by a much smaller proportion of
battery powered urban vehicles.
As for California's forthcoming legislation, Mazda believes that the
problems of limited range and performance of battery-powered cars, and even
their refuelling infrastructure, will become much more apparent as its
enactment draws nearer. It believes that California's Air Resources Board
and other legislative bodies involved will face a sea of difficulties in
persuading Californian motorists to buy and use them. 'Already, I have heard
that the ARB is feeling itself as Hamlet in Shakespeare,' says Yamanouchi.
Mazda therefore expects the Californian authorities to welcome the proposals
for a hydrogen alternative.
It is considering talking to other manufacturers that have an interest in
the technology for a co-operative approach to introducing hydrogen cars to
California.
Among those most likely to be interested is Mercedes, which last year
updated its thinking on hydrogen vehicles in the form of the F-100 concept,
shown as Mercedes' 'car of the future' at the Detroit motor show.
Even Mazda, however, acknowledges that production of hydrogen - on the huge
scale required to provide significant substitution for petroleum - is a
large technical challenge.
Hydrogen may be the most abundant element in the universe, and the ninth
most abundant on earth, but making it from water - the most sensible route
on a large scale - involves electrolysis, using a direct external energy
source. Clearly, if the energy to provide this came from fossil fuels, the
whole exercise could be self-defeating from both the emissions and energy
conservation points of view.
For large parts of the transport-using world - not least sunny California -
solar energy could prove the answer. One group highly active in the field,
Texas Instruments, claims already to be generating solar electricity at
close to the domestic tariff rate of Southern California Edison, the
electric utility.

   TOKYO -- Forget highway frivolity. If the 1991 Tokyo Motor
Show is any indication, driving in the '90s is going to be
serious business.
   The previous Tokyo exhibition, in 1989, was a dazzling
display of power and whimsy. It included a bubblelike
single-seat car called the Daihatsu Sneaker, a Mazda
"microvan" called the Scrum and the Suzuki Escudome -- a
sport vehicle with a pop-out rear tent for going "back to the
nature."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   This year's version of the biennial show has its moments
of fun, including a display of the Avalon, a car of the
future from Toyota Motor Corp. The sleek open-air roadster
sports a stylishly grooved body that shuts up tight as an
oyster when the car isn't in use, forming what Toyota calls
"a cool and mysterious objet d'art." But the 1991 show
largely abandons flash and fantasy for cars that seem
tailor-made for "Save the Whales" bumper stickers. On display
is a politically correct lineup of experimental vehicles
powered by electricity, hydrogen, methanol and sunlight. The
Tokyo show's New Age theme: "Man, Car and Earth as One."
   Mazda Motor Co.'s HR-X coupe (the letters stand for
Hydrogen Rotary Experimental) runs on hydrogen gas that is
stored in a rectangular tank and fed into a rotary engine.
Mitsubishi Motors Corp.'s HSR-III (for Human Science
Research) strikes a "user-friendly" note by eliminating the
gas pedal and brake and putting those functions on the
steering wheel.
   Honda Motor Co.'s EP-X (for Efficient Personal
Experimental) takes a more traditional tack. It marries an
ultra-efficient three-cylinder gasoline engine to a
lightweight aluminum body to produce maximum fuel economy,
though Honda doesn't say just how much.
   So pervasive is the show's environmental emphasis that
manufacturers are stretching to make even their regular cars
fit in. Subaru, the auto-making subsidiary of Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd., gave its rakish looking, 240-horsepower SVX
coupe a coat of turquoise paint -- and dubbed the car the SVX
Greenish Air.
   Amid all this, some industry executives worried at
yesterday's press preview that emphasizing the environment
and vehicle safety may not breathe life into world auto
sales, now simultaneously slumping in the U.S., Japan and
Europe. "I wonder whether environmental friendliness will be
a sufficient motive for consumers to buy cars," said Yutaka
Kume, president of Nissan Motor Co. and chairman of the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers' Association. "I have some doubts."
   One thing hasn't changed this year: Tokyo remains the
world's premier auto show. While the Russians didn't mount a
display this year (their first and only showing was in 1989),
almost everybody else showed up. Some 4,500 reporters have
press credentials for the show -- compared with about 1,000
for baseball's current World Series. The U.S. and Europe sent
a flock of senior automotive executives, including the
chairman of Volkswagen AG and the presidents of Ford Motor
Co. and General Motors Corp.
   Both Detroit companies, which this week reported big
third-quarter losses, raised their profile at this year's
show and promised to start exporting right-hand-drive cars to
Japan. (The Japanese, like the British, drive on the left
side of the road.) "We're committed to a long-term effort to
delivering cars and trucks that will meet the expectations
and needs of Japanese consumers," declared Lloyd E. Reuss,
GM's president.
   In fact, Mr. Reuss said the company will make a
right-hand-drive version of its Impact electric car. The
Impact is scheduled to go on the market sometime in the
mid-'90s as the world's first mass-produced electric
passenger vehicle.
   But the plethora of electric and other alternative-fuel
vehicles at the show spotlighted a problem for auto makers.
No one is sure just what technology will take the fore in
making cars that don't pollute.
   Mazda bills its hydrogen rotary engine as "the ultimate
engine of the 21st century" because the world has a virtually
limitless supply of hydrogen, and burning it doesn't create
the carbon dioxide that contributes to global warming. But
the company concedes that the engine has enormous practical
problems that must be overcome before hydrogen-powered cars
get anywhere close to the market.
   Such concerns are why Honda is taking a more traditional
tack. The company, whose new VTEC-E engine in the 1992 Civic
hatchback gets 48 miles a gallon in the city, believes it can
develop gasoline engines that get still higher mileage but
cause less pollution.
   The company's EP-X -- its first-ever futuristic "concept
car" -- is a two-seater that puts the passenger directly
behind the driver, like in a small airplane. The arrangement
makes for a slender body that cuts wind resistance.
   Honda says it isn't sure what mileage the car will get
when equipped with required safety and anti-pollution
devices. And executives concede that the EP-X is far too
rough-riding a vehicle for mass production. Nonetheless, the
car shows the direction the company's future research efforts
will take. "For now, there's no shortage of oil itself," says
Honda President Nobuhiko Kawamoto.
   Among the few vehicles on display in Tokyo not adhering to
the exhibition's no-nonsense theme is the AVUS Quattro, an
aluminum sports car with a monstrous 12-cylinder, 60-valve
engine from Volkswagen's Audi subsidiary. It generates 509
horsepower and moves from zero to 60 miles an hour in three
seconds.
   Isuzu Motors Co., for its part, bucked the exhibit's
socially conscious themes with the Nagisa and the Terraza.
The former is a boat-shaped amphibious car that seems
designed for the next James Bond movie; the latter is a
luxury city sedan with a fifth wheel that runs parallel to
the rear axle and that drops into use to scoot the vehicle
into a tight parking space.
   And then there is Toyota's Avalon. Toyota's brochure
describes the Avalon as a "socializing cruiser" and suggests
it be used for a trip with friends. "What could be better
than an active weekend spent at a chic resort with another
couple with the same interests as yours?" the brochure asks,
adding: "That's the way it's done in the States."
   But the car lacks so much as a convertible top and can be
operated only in openair mode. What happens to the
socializing couples when it rains? "Well, we haven't really
thought that far," shrugs Hiroshi Kawase, the Avalon's chief
engineer.
   But the prize for the show's least practical vehicle
undoubtedly belongs to Harley Davidson Inc., the American
motorcycle maker. It proudly displayed a hulking bike whose
body is finished with black Japanese urushi lacquer that's
topped with an inlaid silver dragon. This delicately
decorated "hog," as Harleys are called, isn't for sale; but
the company says the estimated price would be $120,000.

FT  13 JUN 92 / Sport: Two speedsters with very different pedigrees -
Motoring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY WERE fast, compact and made in Germany but, apart from being hugely
enjoyable to drive, that was all they had in common.
The Ford Escort RS Cosworth is what aerospace people would call the ultimate
stretch of a basic machine. The Porsche 968 is the latest model from a small
company that once had a booming business making costly, top-quality sports
cars for motoring connoisseurs.
The Escort RS Cosworth came about because Ford is determined to win the
world rally championship. The rules for rallying's group A say 5,000 units
(2,500 from 1993) must be built in a year before a car can be approved for
competition use.
In essence, it is the complete four-wheel drive power train of a Sierra RS
Cosworth - itself a formidable motor sport machine - shoehorned into an
Escort body shell. Its two-litre, four-cylinder, 16-valve engine develops
227 horsepower. Driven brutally, the Escort leaps from 0-60 mph (0-96 kmh)
in 5.7 seconds - a Ferrari Testarossa takes 5.8 - and has a 140 mph (225
kmh) maximum. All of which is likely to be of academic interest to business
motorists who persuade their employers or partners to let them have one.
What the UK insurance companies have to say about this hottest of all
hatchbacks will depend on the driver's record and where it is to be kept.
Almost inevitably, it will be in Group 20, the highest of all. Even a
saintly member of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, with a life-long
no-claims bonus and a lock-up garage, will pay a hefty premium. The insurers
will decide each case individually. Ford has fitted it with a double-lock
security system and an engine immobiliser - and, yes, a police version is
already under development.
As everyday transport the Escort RS is pleasanter than you might think
possible. Before getting behind the wheel, I had eyed the bonnet top vents,
the all-too-obvious aerodynamic aids and ultra-squat tyres suspiciously.
Within 10 minutes, I had been charmed. Forget the aggressive looks. When
developing the car, Ford's special vehicle engineering department at Dunton,
Essex, ensured it would be easy and rewarding for normal people to drive.
Used responsibly, its slingshot acceleration makes overtaking - especially
on slippery roads - quick and safe. Steering response is instant and power
assistance ensures parking is effortless. The Escort RS glues itself to a
winding road and storms up sinuous hills. But it does not fidget or ride
uncomfortably at the sort of speeds possible only on an autobahn (although
not, I fear, for much longer). The gearshift is good and the clutch is not a
muscle-builder.
A lot of the credit for the Escort RS's civilised demeanour belongs to the
Pirelli P Zero Corsa size 225/45ZR16 tyres. They are as squat as the last
generation of Formula 1 racing tyres and safe for continuous use at more
than the car's maximum speed.
Normally, a very high performance tyre with a cross-section more than twice
as wide as high creates lots of road roar and thumping. Pirelli has managed
to make the Escort RS's specially developed P Zero Corsas ride with the
noise and comfort levels of a tyre three sizes smaller.
Standard and Motorsport versions of the Escort RS are Pounds 21,380. A
luxury model which costs Pounds 23,495 (Pounds 23,976 with hide trim) can
have a CD player and heated front seats as extras. Firm orders with deposits
have been given for 500 of the 700 Escort RS's to be sold in Britain this
year. Let us hope they can all get insurance.
The most remarkable things about the Porsche 968s are their prices, starting
at Pounds 34,945 for a hardtop coupe with six-speed gearbox. A cabriolet
with power hood is Pounds 38,724.
Had the 968 been introduced two years ago, prices probably would have been
10-15 per cent higher. But Porsche sales have been hit hard by the
recession. More realistic pricing is seen as one of the ways back to
prosperity.
Porsche's unique Tiptronic transmission adds another Pounds 2,152. It can be
used as a four-speed automatic or a manual gearbox with instant, clutch-less
changes. I reckon it would be worth every penny to an owner who commutes to
town during rush hour but likes to shift for himself on the truly open road.
Although the 968 clearly is derived from the 944, which was run out at cut
prices earlier this year, 82 per cent of its components are said to be new.
The engine is three litres with four cylinders. That makes it sound like
something from a truck. In fact, it is very smooth when spinning freely (it
has contra-rotating balance shafts) and produces more torque, or pulling
power at a given speed than any other naturally aspirated three-litre
engine.
When first I drove an open 968 cabriolet in Germany a year ago, I thought it
felt like being in a low-flying Tiger Moth, but quieter and much faster. In
sunny Berkshire a few days ago, I had to be more circumspect. But even at
speeds which do not put licences at risk, Porsche quality shines through.
The power-assisted steering is razor sharp. Reserves of roadholding and
handling are too great to be explored on public roads. The ABS brakes are
reassuringly powerful. Porsche claims top speeds of 156 mph (251 kph) for
the manual car, which has quite close ratios in its silky gearbox, and 153
mph (246 kph) for the Tiptronic.
An Escort RS would beat both to 60 mph (96 kmh) from a standing start - the
manual by nearly one second, the Tiptronic by just over two seconds. Does
that matter? I doubt it. Porsche buyers are no longer the city wide boys of
the loadsamoney days.
Porsche is only too aware of the temptations in the path of posh sports car
buyers. Competition includes the twin-turbo V6 Nissan 300ZX (Pounds 30,962)
and rotary engined Mazda RX-7 (Pounds 22,202). The arrival of the Mitsubishi
3000GT in Britain in August (mainland Europe in September) will not help.
Acquiring a Porsche always was more than just buying a new car. It still has
connotations of paying the entry fee into a club that is not open to drivers
of Nissans, Mazdas and Mitsubishis - or Escort RS Cosworths, for that
matter.
The UK is an important market to Porsche. The 968 - also with a group 20
insurance rating - is priced keenly by Porsche standards. It is expected
first to hold the fort and then to rebuild sales. It will be followed by a
relatively cheap (around Pounds 23,000 to Pounds 25,000 at today's values)
sports car, but this is still several years off.

<HEAD>Japanese Automakers Introduce New Sports Cars</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. on Thursday unveiled a
new two-seat roadster, a throwback to the 1960s aimed at a part of
the U.S. car market with no competition.
   The M-5 Miata is scheduled to go on sale in Mazda dealerships
nationwide this July. At a base price of less than $14,000, the
Miata is targeting a segment of the car market largely vacated. One
reason is the rising expense of imports, a result of the dollar's
lower value in recent years.
   Honda Motor Corp., another Japanese automaker, said it planned an
introduction of its new two-seat Acura sports car. At a reported
price of $55,000, it's at the other end of the price scale from the
Miata.
   The carmakers disclosed their plans at Chicago's annual auto
show, an important forum for rivals vying for a chunk of the
lucrative U.S. market. Officials from all major manufacturers have
been holding press briefing prior to the show's official opening
Saturday.
   Mazda also unveiled a new version of its RX-7 sports car with a
redeveloped rotary engine that boosts horsepower while improving gas
mileage. The changes also pushed up the RX-7's base sticker price by
about $1,000 to about $17,000, said George McCabe, vice president
for sales and marketing Mazda Motor of America Inc., the automaker's
U.S. arm.
   There are no U.S. or imported two-seat sports cars in Miata's
price range. Mazda officials said Miata, a front-engine, rear-wheel
drive car, was designed specifically for the U.S. market.
   McCabe said the company planned to import about 20,000 Miatas
this year, and boost that to about 40,000 annually after that.
   The two-seat sports car market has been shaky in the U.S. during
the past several years, McCabe said, dropping from 2.4 percent of
the entire car market in 1986 to 1.3 percent last year.
   He said Mazda thinks interest in the car remains, but the rising
prices have made the cars less affordable.
   Among domestic carmakers, Ford officials said Thursday they plan
a newly designed Lincoln Town Car, descriibing it as a rounder
version of the hugely successful top-of-the-line luxury model. They
declined to disclose the cost.
   The Town Car for 1990, which is nearing production, will retain
its traditional interior size and trunk space but it could be longer
than current models despite being built on the same platform, said
Robert Rewey, vice president for sales of Ford's North American
operations.
   Base prices for the 1989 Town Car range from $25,562 to $29,709.
The 1989 Town Car Signature V-8 engine remains for 1990. A new
standard feature is air bags on the driver's and passenger's side of
the front seat.
   Rewey also suggested Ford might produce a successor to the Ford
Escort and the Mercury Tracer. No date was set.

   Deere, a Moline, Ill., maker of farm, industrial and
lawn-care equipment, purchased the rotary operations in 1984,
said a spokesman.
   While the technology "holds significant promise" in both
military and commercial applications, the spokesman said,
"given the prospects for diminished funding" from the Defense
Department, "we made a strategic evaluation and elected to
exit the business."
   Tahoe said it has been developing a technology designed to
increase rotary-engine performance and reduce emissions.

<F P=106> [Article by Olivier Lauvige: "Secrets of the Renault Sport </F>
Semiautomatic Gearbox"] 
  [Text] In racing, it cuts gearshifting time in half. On a 
passenger car, it frees the driver from the "acrobatics" 
required for each shift. The scene is the Limousin Rally, on 10 
October 1993. Approaching a tricky hairpin turn, Jean Ragnoti, 
official driver for the Renault team, is manhandling the 
stickshift of his Clio-Williams and frantically stomping on the 
clutch for a fast downshift. At the same spot, and with the same 
type of car, his teammate Philippe Bugalski, presses lightly 
with his fingers on a "joystick" without letting go of the 
steering wheel, and downshifts three speeds in record time. His 
advantage? A semiautomatic gearbox born from a collaboration 
between Renault Sport and Magneti Marelli. Tested in races, it 
should soon be installed on certain mass produced cars. 
  It is in fact a device which activates a conventional 
gearbox 
in place of the driver. It consists of two components: one is 
mounted on the box and the other on the clutch. The shift 
linkage is replaced by an electric-hydraulic mechanism with five 
small actuators (two linear and three rotary) which select and 
engage the six speeds of an H-pattern gearbox. Also, the clutch 
cable is replaced by an actuator controlled either by a solenoid 
or by the left pedal, thus leaving the driver in control of 
clutch release at certain times, such as when starting the car. 
  The pressure needed for these operations is obtained from a 
150-bar hydraulic pump which is coupled directly to the 
camshaft. Gilles Lallement, head of development at Renault 
Sport, explained that "we opted for this solution in spite of 
the great complexity presented by its implementation. The fact 
is that the very high power of these components makes it 
possible to build actuators that are sufficiently compact and 
fast, characteristics that are essential to such an application." 
  The driver therefore no longer has to expend any effort to 
shift gears. He merely has to pull up on a small handle located 
near his steering wheel to upshift and pull down on it to 
downshift. Instructions are sent to a computer which also 
receives data concerning engine speed, the speed of each wheel, 
the hydraulic pressure... about thirty parameters altogether. 
The computer then calculates the shift sequence. 
<H5>  Adapting Engine Speed </H5>
  To shift up by one or several gears, the computer sends 
instructions to the injection system which then adapts the 
engine speed to the rotation speed of the driveshaft. As soon as 
this synchronization is achieved, the shift is allowed and the 
computer activates the sequence of rotary and translation 
motions needed to engaging the selected gear. The driver can 
thus go from first to fifth while still flooring the gas pedal. 
The strategy is somewhat different for downshifting: In this 
case the computer has to enable the clutch actuator before 
engaging the gear. 
  Patrick Landon, head of the Renault Sport racing department, 
states that "the advantages of this semiautomatic box are 
undeniable in racing." Notably, it cuts in half the time needed 
for shifting: from 0.28 seconds manually for an experienced 
driver to 0.13 seconds in automatic. This means a gain of 0.38 
seconds per kilometer on a custom car! 
  For the average motorist, shaving off a few tenths of a 
second from his commute may hardly seem worth it. But he may 
well be attracted to some of the advantages of this gearbox. 
Adapted to a passenger car, it reduces physical fatigue. It is 
estimated that in city traffic, a driver shifts an average of 
fifty times per kilometer. Pushing the clutch each time, his 
left foot expends a cumulated effort of 100 to 150 newtons, 
which over a distance of 12 kilometers corresponds to moving a 
load of about 7 tons! With only one leg... 
<H5>  No More Acrobatics </H5>
  In addition, the optimization of shift sequences increases 
the life of the gearbox while software safeguards prevent 
downshifting above 8500 rpm to protect against racing the 
engine. And finally, freed from the acrobatics imposed by any 
gear shifting, the driver can concentrate totally on steering 
his vehicle. 
  These advantages are enough for Magneti Marelli to undertake 
the implementation of a version which is intended for "Everyman" 
and which can satisfy the expectations of the luxury car driver 
without frustrating lovers of the stickshift. The possibility of 
adapting it to any existing box without modifications would 
enable car manufacturers to offer this automation as an option, 
at a price lower than that of a completely automatic box. One 
version has already been unveiled at the Frankfurt Salon on an 
Alfa Romeo. Volvo also is said to be thinking of installing it 
very soon on one its top of the line models. 
<H5>  An Enticing Market </H5>
  Other equipment makers are just as convinced of the success 
of "semiautomation" for European drivers. Thus Valeo is devoting 
intense efforts to implementing a similar system. Benoist Hue, 
marketing head of the clutch division, says that "we are already 
putting a mass produced electronic clutch on some Ferraris. And 
we have a number of projects underway to get it installed on 
European cars during 1995. But we will have to wait until the 
following year for completely robotized mass production of 
gearboxes." 
  This is an extremely attractive market for the French 
equipment maker who estimates that by the year 2005, 
semiautomatic gearboxes will have taken over some 12 percent of 
European production. It remains to be seen whether Old World 
motorists can live with a joystick in their hands instead of a 
shift lever...

<TEXT>
   An engineer inspired by the flight of
hummingbirds hovered 40 feet in the air Wednesday in a saucer-like
craft he said will revolutionize commuter travel.
   Paul Moller said his brief, noisy flight over a crowd of
wind-blown reporters was to demonstrate the technology his company
is developing to build a flying car for the 21st century.
   ``At some point in time, it will be used for that,'' Moller
said. ``You know the automobile is still good for that short
distance, but here to San Francisco, here to Reno, here to L.A.,
you're going to see something like this will be in common usage.
   ``It's going to take off very rapidly once the credibility is
established.''
   A former professor and founder of the aeronautics program at the
University of California, Davis, Moller has spent nearly 30 years
developing what's known in the field as a ``vertical take-off and
landing'' or VTOL aircraft.
   His company, Moller International, in a Davis research park
about 80 miles northeast of San Francisco, is working on robotic
aircraft for reconnaissance use by the military, as well as
commuter vehicles.
   Moller, 51, calls his machines ``volantors,'' referring to
quick, nimble flight like that of the hummingbird that awed him
since he was a 6-year-old child.
   The 10-foot wide, round, blue craft he flew Wednesday, the
M200x, hung in the air for about three minutes and made a slow spin
before landing in virtually the same spot where it took off.
   But its visual grace was accompanied with the deafening roar of
eight unmuffled snowmobile engines and a vortex of wind that pushed
it off the ground, slashed the grass below and tumbled camera bags
and the contents of a purse across the lawn.
   Moller wore a fire-retardant racing suit and a motorcycle
helmet. His machine was tethered by a thin cable to a construction
crane for insurance and safety reasons. But once unleashed, he
said, it would go ``as high as I'm willing to let it go.''
   While the M200x looks like a vehicle for George Jetson of
cartoon fame, a another model that Moller said his company will
produce and begin testing later this year is fit for James Bond.
Sleek and bubble-topped, it looks like a cross between a jet
fighter and the Batmobile.
   Moller said his M400 will be able to carry four passengers at
speeds up to 403 mph, as high as 31,000 feet and as far as 850
miles before refueling on low-octane gasoline. At a cruising speed
of 220 mph, he said, its fuel efficiency would be about 15 miles
per gallon.
   Like the saucer craft, the M400 will be powered by eight
gasoline rotary engines built with technology acquired from a
company that used them in snowmobiles. Mollar said he chose rotary
engines for their power, light weight and relatively low cost.
   The engines power fans that drive air down for takeoff and
hovering, then a series of vanes and ducts redirect thrust for
horizontal flight. Computers and gyroscopes control the vehicles'
pitch and roll.
   Moller said the M400 could be ready for sale to the public
within five to 10 years. He estimated the price for initial
hand-built models would be about the same as a helicopter or
airplane, then would drop to $20,000 or $30,000 once mass produced.
   Jack Allison, the company's marketing director, said on-board
computers could navigate the crafts using satellites to determine
their location and avoid collisions.
   ``Eventually we'll have electronic highways in the sky created
so that this type of vehicle can carry commuters in substantial
numbers and do so without any danger whatsoever to commercial
aviation and other general aviation,'' Allison said.

<LEADPARA>  HIGH-QUALITY garden tools can last a lifetime with proper care. The steel
heads on hoes, shovels, rakes, spades, trowels and picks should be kept clean,
sharp and rust-free; rotary mower blades should be sharpened and balanced
every few months.;    Here are tips to help keep tools in top shape:  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Garden  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  HOW TO KEEP GARDEN TOOLS IN TOP SHAPE FOR
TOP PERFORMANCE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Do It Yourself  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     (box)  CLEANING: Clean tools after each use and store them in a dry place.
Scrape off mud and dirt with a putty knife or similar tool, and wash off the
remaining dirt with a hose.;    Remove rust with a wire brush, sandpaper or a
rust-removing chemical, then apply oil with a brush or rag.;    To clean and
oil a hand tool in one easy operation, fill a 5-gallon bucket with sand and
add used oil drained from the crankcase of your mower or car. Thrust the tool
into the oil-soaked sand several times. The blade will emerge clean and oily.
Repeat the process occasionally during gardening season to prevent rust.;   
(box)  SHARPENING: Keep cutting and digging edges sharp to make gardening
easier and to prevent possible breakage caused by excess pressure on tool
handles.;    You can sharpen shears, sickles, pruning knives and other cutting
tools by grinding, filing, or using a special sharpening stone such as a
whetstone or slipstone.;    If a cutting edge is very dull or nicked, it
should be power-ground or filed to remove the nicks and restore the bevel.
Knives, scissors or axes should be finished to a sharp edge with a whetstone
or slipstone.;    To sharpen digging tools, place the tool in a vise and use a
coarse 1O-inch file to restore the original edge -- usually a 45-degree bevel.
On files, the bevel should be on the outside edge of the blade. A 60-degree
bevel is best for general use; a 30-degree bevel for cutting heavy weed
growth. On hoes and shovels, sharpen the corners as well as the cutting
edges.;    It's very important to keep axes sharp. Clamp the head of the ax,
edge up, in a vise. Use a medium-cut mill file, never a power grinder, which
may ruin the blade's temper. Hold the file flat against the head and draw it
upward toward the cutting edge, lifting off at the end of each stroke.;   
File both surfaces, rounding them to a convex profile. Retain this profile to
the corners of the blade; don't taper the corners. Check the edge by looking
down its length. Bright spots indicate dull areas. Keep filing until the edge
looks almost invisible. Finish by honing the edge with a round slipstone.
Slide the stone along one side and then the other in a circular motion.;   
(box)  SHARPENING ROTARY MOWER BLADES: Rotary mower blades should be sharpened
and balanced twice a season, or at least frequently enough to retain the
original cutting-edge angle.;    A dull blade will tear the grass instead of
cutting it and will also strain the engine; a badly nicked blade can cause
vibrations; an improperly sharpened blade may not provide enough lift to pick
up the grass and will cut the lawn evenly.;    To sharpen a rotary mower
blade, follow these steps:;    (check) Always disconnect the spark plug or
unplug the power cord first. Grasp the blade in a gloved hand or with a heavy
rag and loosen the securing nuts or bolts. If a bolt sticks, apply penetrating
oil to the bolt and tap the wrench with a hammer.;    (check) Remove the blade
and check the stiffener for cracks or bends. If you need to replace the
stiffener, use a manufacturer's recommended part -- a bent or homemade part
can cause vibration that will damage the engine.;    (check) Clamp the blade
in a vise and sharpen with a medium-cut flat file along the original angle of
the cutting edge. File in one direction only -- toward the edge. You can also
use an electric-drill sharpening attachment, available in hardware stores.;   
(check) Use a screwdriver or knife as a pivot through the center hole of the
blade to balance it. Check the balance one way, then flip the blade over and
check again. If the same end of the blade drops consistently, file some metal
from the rear of the heavy end (not from the cutting edge). This will lighten
the blade without harming the edge.;    (check) If the blade is balanced both
ways, reinstall it, making sure the lifts point upward toward the deck when
the mower is right side up.;    (check) A bent blade will make a ragged cut,
may scalp the lawn in spots and the vibrations may cause serious engine
damage, so it's best to replace it.  </TEXT>

<LP>
   DETROIT -- Mazda Motor Corp. wants to become known in the
U.S. as the Japanese auto maker that builds solid cars with a
touch of spice -- a pint-sized Toyota with attitude.
   That image began to take shape three years ago when Mazda
brought its Miata roadster to the U.S. with great success.
Now the auto maker hopes to complete the cast by introducing
new versions of five of its cars over the next six months. A
lot is riding on these vehicles, which will replace half of
the company's product line. "This sets the pace for us for
the balance of the decade," says Clark Vitulli, senior vice
president of Mazda's U.S. sales arm.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Indeed, the new designs are part of the company's drive to
break out of the second tier of Japanese auto makers in the
U.S. -- populated by the likes of Mitsubishi, Subaru, Isuzu
and Suzuki -- and cruise into the first tier with the
Japanese Big Three: Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp. and
Nissan Motor Co. "We want it to be the Big Four," says a
spokesman.
   So next week Mazda will introduce two of the new lines: A
bigger, more luxurious 929 that will compete in the "near
luxury" market segment, and the MX-3, a small sporty coupe
for the younger set that shares underpinnings with Mazda's
four-door Protege subcompact.
   Mazda's success building such niche vehicles has raised
its annual U.S. car sales by about 30%, to around 270,000,
since 1987, before it introduced the Miata. Mazda now holds
3.5% of the U.S. car market -- well behind Honda and Toyota,
which stand at nearly 10% and 9%, respectively, but not too
far behind Nissan's 5%.
   Now the company wants more -- specifically, to increase
its annual vehicle sales more than 40% by the mid-1990s to
500,000 cars, vans and trucks. It's a lofty target,
considering the signs of resurgence at General Motors Corp.
and the growth ambitions of nearly every other car maker. To
help it get there, Mazda is starting a major ad campaign this
weekend built around the theme: "The New Mazda."
   But what stays the same is Mazda's modest sales
projections for its new designs. The auto maker plans to sell
only 30,000 929s annually and about the same number of MX-3s.
Such low-volume sales may be problematic for Mazda's
long-term growth. They leave the company's product lineup
like a dinner table with appetizers and dessert but no main
course.
   "The product line needs a core product," says Maryann
Keller, an analyst at Furman Selz Inc. in New York. Unlike
its bigger Japanese rivals, Mazda lacks a bread-and-butter
car. "Where is the car that they can depend on year in and
year out for 40% of their sales?" she queries. "There's no
Corolla, there's no Accord, there's not even a Nissan
Sentra."
   Mazda officials are hoping to fill the bill next spring
when they bring out the new 626 compact sedan and MX-6 sporty
coupe. (Mazda will also issue a new RX-7, its time-honored
peanut-shaped two-seater that has a dedicated niche
following.)
   The success of the 626 and MX-6 is important because they
are made in the U.S. and thus not subject to import
restrictions. Flagging sales of both models, in spite of big
discounts, have kept Mazda's U.S. assembly line below
capacity even as the company's overall car sales have grown
slightly from last year despite the recession. Sales of
U.S.-made 626s dropped 26%, while U.S.-built MX-6 sales sank
18% through early September.
   The 626 and its two-door sister car will compete in the
large market for family-sized vehicles populated by Toyota's
Corolla and Camry, Honda's Civic and Accord and Nissan's
Sentra and Stanza, as well as several offerings from the Big
Three U.S. auto makers.
   "The current MX-6 is just bland," says auto analyst Chris
Cedergren of AutoPacific Group Inc. in Santa Ana, Calif. But
the new MX-6 will solve that problem, says Mr. Cedergren, who
has seen all of Mazda's new product lineup. With the new
cars, he says, Mazda has created cars that look good and
exude sophistication.
   Mazda calls its attempt to build cars that produce a
pleasant driving experience "kansei" engineering. Kansei --
loosely translated -- means in harmony with the five senses,
Mazda says, and kansei engineering is the technical steps
Mazda takes to make sure its cars feel good to drive. The
company tried to explain the concept in ads two years ago.
Failing to do that, its marketers settled for the slogan, "It
just feels right."
   Mazda dealers agree the new cars hit the mark. "They're
awesome," says Ruben Rodriguez, sales manager for Stockton
Mazda in California. "The entire line is going to be more
bold."
   Notwithstanding the early reviews, the models' success
isn't guaranteed. Unlike Mazda's two current hits, the MPV
minivan and the Miata, next week's entries are headed for
market segments that already have a lot of competition. When
it debuted in 1988, Mazda's MPV was one of the few
alternatives to Chrysler Corp.'s minivan. And the Miata
created a market all its own as a true convertible sports car
with a then unprecedented $13,800 base price.
   In contrast, the 929 must compete in a market crowded by
entries from Honda, Nissan, Mitsubishi, and even General
Motors' Pontiac Bonneville.
   So Mazda is trying to be different. The company that
brought the rotary engine to America (an innovation that
flopped) is equipping the 929 with a solar-powered auxiliary
ventilation system that blows hot air out when the car is
parked in the sun. Prices for the line will start around
$27,000 and climb above $30,000 for the fully loaded model,
positioning it above Honda's Acura Vigor but below its
Legend.
   In addition to carrying its own weight, the 929 must do a
warmup act for Mazda's luxury division, Amati, which is
scheduled to begin selling cars in 1994. The next "logical
step" for 929 buyers will be the Amati cars, says Stephen
Gurski, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York.
   The MX-3's mission won't be to attract buyers so much as
to keep them. Buyers of modestly priced but highly styled
sporty coupes are so fickle that they constitute the "car of
the month club," says AutoWeek magazine. Cars such as the
Ford Probe and the Mitsubishi Eclipse were hot for a year or
so but quickly faded when newer competitors came along.
   The MX-3 will cost between $11,000 and $14,000, higher
than the Toyota Paseo but on a par with most other
competitors. Mazda officials hope the MX-3's optional
six-cylinder, 130-horsepower engine, the only one available
in this quirky niche, will be enough to hold and keep buyers.
   Should Mazda's new cars prove to be the right horses, the
next question is whether the company has an adequate stable.
Only 28% of Mazda's dealerships are in stand-alone
facilities. The rest share space with other brands. Most
dealer showrooms feature only four to five cars. "So the rest
of them are going to be sitting out on the back lot where
presentation is a lot less glamorous," says Furman Selz's Ms.
Keller.
   She also questions the wisdom of offering more two-door
cars (four models in all) than four-door models (three of
them) when the market seems headed toward four-door cars.
Mazda replies that it has enough four-door models, and that
in any case, its cars aren't for everybody.

Yokohama] 
  [Text] 
<H5>  1. Introduction </H5>
  As the economic recession continues, a social re-examination 
seems to be taking place with regard to giving consumers the 
kinds of products and services that they really want. I believe 
that in times such as this there is more of a demand for 
authentic products and technologies. What I mean here by 
authentic is providing a basic value for goods purchased that 
gives the average customer a sense of satisfaction. 
  To meet these needs requires mature technologies that show 
an 
understanding of the consumer and what they want. The mature 
technologies referred to here are consumer technologies that 
essentially solve the problems that people consider important to 
them. For that reason, I think that we are entering a time in 
which research institutes that have stockpiled many different 
technologies will be asked to lead the way. 
  Therefore, in this paper, I would like to introduce the 
Mazda 
Technical Research Center, and in doing so, discuss what it is 
doing to address these new social trends. 
<H5>  2. Research Center Profiled </H5>
  The first technical research center that Mazda established 
to 
concentrate on new technologies was in 1985 at its headquarters 
in Hiroshima, and then in 1987, it added the Yokohama Technical 
Research Center in Yokohama. The basic "idea" behind opening the 
technical research center here in Yokohama was, to use the 
slogan at the time, "build an automobile culture." What this 
means is not treating the car simply as a means of travel, but 
treating it as one of the essential elements of society and 
culture that people need. 
  When the research centers initially received word of this 
new 
slogan, the research center at Mazda headquarters in Hiroshima 
decided to put its emphasis on new technologies that were 
directly related to the development of car types, whereas the 
research center in Yokohama decided it would focus on basic 
technologies in advanced fields oriented toward automobile 
technologies of the 21st century. At present, the two research 
centers are exchanging ideas and deepening ties with one another 
based on respective areas of expertise, and are steadily playing 
more important roles as the core places within Mazda for 
developing new technologies. 
  Next, before we get into specific research activities, I 
would like to discuss my own views regarding research. 
<H5>  3. Personal Views Regarding Research </H5>
  Research institutes are at the pinnacle of research and 
development, and have an important mission in developing and 
exploring consumer technologies. For that reason, I feel that 
research institutes have to reflect the long-term and 
medium-term needs of consumers in their research. 
  With that in mind, I would like to take the opportunity here 
to state the direction I believe that consumer trends are going. 
  Until now, companies have stressed high value-added cars 
that 
offer more in the way of diversity, performance, and 
functionality. In the future, however, there will probably be a 
shift from superficial "enjoyment" needs to more basic 
"enjoyment" needs. The need, for example, to maintain respect 
for human life, whether one's own or others, is growing ever 
more stronger in terms of both product safety and the 
environment. 
  For example, something has to be done about the more than 
10,000 people a year that die in auto accidents, and the other 
problems that exist such as environmental pollution caused by 
carbon dioxide and nitrous oxides, and also find other energy 
alternatives to petroleum. These problems are an immediate and 
future threat to ourselves, our families, and our children, and 
are cause for concern. 
  These are essentially problems that have to do with the car 
itself, so if we are to resolve these issues, we must steadily 
stockpile those technologies with an eye toward the future. 
  With that said, I would now like to introduce some areas of 
research to show the work we are doing in tackling some of these 
problems. 
<H5>  4. Research Activities Outlined </H5>
  In this section, I have divided the research activities into 
"environment-friendly" and "people-friendly" research, and 
focused in on particular research projects in each area from the 
perspective discussed above of addressing the basic needs of 
today's consumers. 
<H5>  4.1 "Environment-Friendly" Technologies </H5>
  What we mean here by "environment-friendly technologies" are 
those technologies for solving the environmental and energy 
resource problems we are likely to face in the 21st century. 
More specifically, it means those technologies concerned with 
developing energy alternatives to petroleum, and those 
technologies concerned with recycling that try to limit exhaust 
gas emissions by researching new combustion methods for reducing 
carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions, and making effective 
use of resources. 
  (1) Technologies for Developing Energy Substitutes 
  I would like to start by talking about the hydrogen 
rotary-engine automobile (HR-X). This car was developed to 
convey the image of an urban-type commuter car to be used in a 
21st century environment restored with light and greenery. 
Figure 1 [figure not reproduced] is a photograph of the HR-X 
car. A hydrogen rotary engine is a clean engine that burns 
hydrogen, and is revolutionary in the sense that it does not 
emit carbon dioxide nor destroy natural cycles. 
  More recently, we developed a prototype model of that car 
outfitted with a hydrogen fuel cell, and successfully test drove 
it for the first time. Figure 2 [figure not reproduced] is a 
photograph of the hydrogen fuel cell car. This car enabled us to 
clarify a number of technical issues having to do with 
outfitting a car such as this, and took us one step closer 
toward achieving the goal of a future society based on 
hydrogen-fueled cars. 
<H5>  (2) Technologies for Controlling Exhaust Gas Emissions </H5>
  In terms of research on engines, we are researching the 
composition of fuel mixtures and combustion mechanism using a 
variety of methods including both visual and computer-based. In 
trying to change the flame propagation process, we have been 
doing research on a peripheral combustion process that causes 
the spark ignition to occur from the periphery of the cylinder. 
Using this technique, we were able to reduce nitrous oxide 
emissions dramatically, and bring about a major improvement in 
lean burn combustion. That research received the Asahara 
Academic Achievement Award at the 42nd Japan Society of 
Automotive Engineers Conference. 
<H5>  (3) Recycling Technologies </H5>
  We are also doing research on materials in terms of 
recycling, which includes both metals and plastics, and in so 
doing, have developed a recyclable plastic composite made of a 
plastic fiber-reinforced liquid crystal polymer. We now have the 
ability to recycle plastic composites that were once virtually 
impossible to recycle, and are able to make more effective use 
of our resources. 
<H5>  4.2 "People-Friendly" Technologies </H5>
  What we mean here by "people-friendly" technologies are 
those 
technologies concerned with understanding the needs of the 
driver and passengers, and those concerned with improving safety 
in order to make the automobile society we live in more 
enjoyable and trouble-free. 
  (1) Preventive Safety 
  We are involved in a number of research projects on advanced 
technologies concerned with preventing accidents. One of these 
involves a "safe driving support system," and another a "road 
traffic communication system." 
  The safe driving support system is a system that acts as a 
back-up in case of driver error, and the communication system is 
a system for providing drivers with safety information about the 
roads. For example, in the safe driving support system project, 
we are doing research on automatic brakes and a white-line 
recognition method. 
  In Figure 3 [figure not reproduced], we show the test car we 
are using in our research on white-line recognition by image 
processing. Mounted in the trunk of the car is a high-speed 
computer programmed to recognize road features. 
  (2) Human Technologies 
  We are also making headway in research on a "driver 
simulator" in order to elucidate the driving psychology and 
behavior characteristics of drivers. In Figure 4, we show a 
general drawing of the driving simulator with a driver on board. 
The driving simulator is expected to be used as a tool for 
elucidating causes of auto accidents, and also as a tool for 
researching driving characteristics of beginners and older 
drivers. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-014L-29A>      Figure 4. General Drawing of Driving Simulator </FIG>

  We have also been doing research on ways to evaluate driver 
alertness by measuring brain waves so that we can take those 
habits into account when designing the inside of the car so as 
to make it harder for the driver to fall asleep. Figure 5 
[figure not reproduced] shows an experiment being conducted to 
ascertain the relationship between brain wave signals and 
delayed responses in humans due to decreased alertness (person 
being tested in photograph is author of article). 
  There are a lot of central functions in the human brain that 
remain unknown. I think that by creating an understanding of 
driver characteristics such as recognition, alertness, and 
fatigue by studying brain activities that we can offer new 
consumer technologies for improved safety. 
<H5>  5. Conclusion </H5>
  In the foregoing, we profiled the entire research center and 
discussed some individual research projects. 
  I think that the keys to providing consumers with what they 
want in terms of basic values are the technologies that we have 
been busy stockpiling. 
  In introducing the research center from this perspective, we 
want to thank the many technical engineers and researchers 
specializing in automobile technology for their help in shedding 
some light on the research projects being carried out within the 
center.

<HL> GE's Earnings Increased 23% In 3rd Quarter </HL>

   General Electric Co. reported third-quarter earnings rose 23% from last year's restated earnings on the strength of its plastics, financial services and medical systems businesses. 

   John F. Welch Jr., chairman of the industrial and consumer products, broadcasting and financial services concern, said third-quarter results "position us well to achieve our objective of a second consecutive year of strong double-digit earnings growth." 
Analysts said one sour note was lower profit from major appliances because of problems with refrigerator compressors. 

   Third-quarter earnings rose to $815 million, or 90 cents a share, from the restated $661 million, or 73 cents a share. 
Revenue fell 1% to $9.31 billion from $9.4 billion. 
However, GE said revenue rose 7% for the quarter after accounting for businesses it bought and sold beginning in 1987. 
Earnings were restated to reflect adoption of new income tax accounting rules. 

   Without the restatement, earnings rose 16%, which GE called a "more meaningful" comparison. 

   "Earnings were at the higher end of the range" expected, said Robert W. McCoy, an analyst at UBS Securities Inc. "Sales increased better than expected." 
However, he noted that troubles at GE's major appliance business hurt third-quarter operating margins for the entire company, although margins, at 9.6%, were still above the 9.4% of last year's third quarter. 

   GE shares rose 12.5 cents in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, to close at $44.125. 

   Profit at major appliances, GE said, "was considerably below" a year ago because of higher material costs, competitive pricing and a one-time provision for warranty costs on GE refrigerators that use the company's new rotary compressors. 
The compressor trouble is a major embarrassment for the company because the manufacture of rotary compressors and GE's decision to use rotary instead of reciprocating compressors in large refrigerators two years ago were promoted as a major technological innovation. 

   However, refrigerators bigger than 21 cubic feet too often don't cool properly, forcing GE to fix them under its five-year warranty plans. 
A spokesman for major appliances said GE won't abandon rotary compressors, but for the time being will put them only in its smaller refrigerators. 
"We'll continue to work on rotary technology," the spokesman said. 
GE originally switched to rotary compressors because they are generally cheaper to make. 

   Operating profit at National Broadcasting Co. fell because of the cost of covering the political conventions. 
But a spokesman said GE still expects the unit to post a "nice increase" for the year. 

   In addition to big operating earnings increases at GE's medical systems, plastics and financial services businesses, GE said cost cutting at the lighting, motors and electrical distribution and control businesses boosted third-quarter earnings at those units. 
Aircraft engine operating profit was "slightly ahead" of last year's strong third quarter, the company said. 

   For the nine months, earnings fell 5.6% to $2.38 billion, or $2.63 a share, from a restated $2.52 billion, or $2.76 a share. 
Revenue fell 3% to $26.53 billion from $27.28 billion. 
But after adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures, GE said revenue rose 4%.

   DEARBORN, Mich. -- Mazda Motor Corp. set the base price of
its new RX-7 sports car at $31,300, 11.2% higher than the
final price of its predecessor.
   Mazda is hoping that the RX-7, with its curvy lines and
powerful engine, will become its "image" car, which helps
explain its high price and Mazda's relatively modest sales
goals for the car. Mazda plans to sell only about 11,000
RX-7s a year. Last year the Japanese auto maker sold 7,000
RX-7s, but that was in the sixth and final year of the old
RX-7's basic design.

<TEXT>
   As Mazda officials formally launched the new RX-7 here
yesterday they reached the midpoint in a flurry of new
product launches they hope will give Mazda a new, sportier
image. In the spring, Mazda will launch its new 626 compact
sedan and its MX-6 sporty coupe. Last fall Mazda unveiled its
929 luxury sedan and its MX-3 sporty subcompacts.
   "We have in essence launched a completely new car
company," said Jan Thompson, vice president of Mazda's U.S.
sales and marketing operations.
   The target customer of the new RX-7 will be older, richer
and more likely to be male than in the past. Mazda projects
that 80% of the new RX-7's buyers will be male, up from about
half of the old buyers. Their median age will be 44 years
old, up from 35, and their average annual household income
will be $95,000, up from $59,000 for the prior version. Mazda
officials said the new target market is mostly a function of
the new car's higher price.
   Currently, Mazda is marketing the RX-7 with teaser ads in
magazines aimed at sports-car enthusiasts. Soon Mazda will
expand the teasers to broadcast and mainstream print media.
The car isn't due in dealerships until April 20.

   A Rotary Club chapter has made its own AIDS
documentary for distribution to 24,000 chapters worldwide that
chronicles the lives of three Rotarians affected by the deadly
disease.
   ``Our idea is to change the attitude in Wichita, Kansas,'' said
Dick Hasenpflug, chairman of the Rotary AIDS Project of the Los
Altos Rotary Club.
   Dushan Angius challenged the Rotary Club to get involved in AIDS
education last summer when he told the group his son, Steve, had
AIDS.
   ``When a son tells you he has AIDS, all you hear is `Gee Dad,
I'm going to die.' There's no way I could let it go that way,''
Angius said.
   The documentary, scheduled to be shown to the media today,
eventually will be distributed to 24,000 Rotary Clubs worldwide,
Hasenpflug said.
   ``Rotarians around the world tend to be leaders in their
communities and we think the Rotarian network gives a unique
opportunity to make an impact on community thinking,'' he said.
   The film initially was going to feature Steve Angius's story
alone. But as word of the project spread, two Rotary Club members
publicly acknowledged that they tested positive for the AIDS virus.
   Greg Betts, president of the Bayshore Rotary Club in neighboring
Palo Alto, volunteered to appear in the film.
   Walter Singer, a 67-year-old retired businessman, went one step
further. He allowed crews to film the meeting in December when he
told the Los Altos Rotary Club how he contracted the AIDS virus in
a blood transfusion during heart bypass surgery.
   ``It was an individual reaction, sort of a gasp,'' Hasenpflug
said. ``It was dead silent, a lot of hugging and holding. All of
these things you don't expect a lot of 60-year-old men to be
doing.''
   Singer said the courage of the Angius family and the public
support they received persuaded him to go public.
   ``The Rotarians are not exempt, which they thought they were,''
Singer said.
   The local Rotary Club's involvement with AIDS is a departure for
the conservative organization that usually avoids politically
controversial subjects, Hasenpflug said.
   ``We believe strongly that the AIDS project transcends
politics,'' Hasenpflug said. ``The political part of it is how
people catch it, and in my opinion, how people catch it is
irrelevant once they catch it. People need our support.''
   Hasenpflug describes the film as ``a very powerful piece'' that
avoids presenting facts about the disease and instead focuses on
the impact AIDS has on individuals.
   On the first day of shooting, crews filmed Steve Angius asking
his family to take him to the hospital. He died the next day, Nov.
25.
   ``Grown men cry when they watch this thing,'' Hasenpflug said.

<TEXT>     But now there's Rotary House, which opened this spring as the nation's
first hospice offering overnight and around-the-clock relief for weary
care-givers.;    Its aim is to reduce the risk of physical, mental or
emotional burnout for people like Robert and Janice Statham. Their 2-year-old
daughter requires constant attention because she has a severe metabolic
disorder.;    "There's tremendous stress on the family unit," said Barbara
Duffy, vice president of Valley Children's Hospital where Rotary House is
located.;    The never-ending demands and tension cause some families to break
up and some to abuse the sick child, she added.;    "We hope to be preventive;
That's what we're all about," Duffy said. "If they can have a week every so
often, or a couple of days, and become refreshed, then that child gets better
care at home.";    Parents or care-givers can use Rotary House up to 30 times
a year, leaving children for a minimum of eight hours and a maximum of seven
days at a time.;    Even with $220,000 seed money from Rotary Clubs, it costs
about $400 a day for respite care, which provides two nurses at all times and
other professional staff as needed. If parents cannot afford that much,
directors will try to work out a price they can pay.;    The atmosphere at
Rotary House is part of the process of easing stress.;    Plants and clay
animal figurines sit on the fireplace mantel of the cheery three-bedroom
house. The couches and easy chairs in the living room and the lawn in front
make people feel as if they're stopping by to see friends.;    "There's
absolutely nothing here that makes them think 'hospital,' and that's good,"
director Cindy Guertin said.;    Guertin tells of one woman who cares for her
16-year-old son at home and went without a vacation for 11 years. This year,
she had a full seven days off thanks to Rotary House and its trained staff.  </TEXT>

   American manufacturers of products ranging from
lawn mowers to wine coolers are being hit by extra costs due to
efforts in western Europe to create a single market among 12
countries, the U.S. Commerce Department reported.
   The department is distributing an analysis of 66 directives
proposed or adopted in the European Economic Community as part of
the plan to break down barriers to internal trade by 1992. Nearly
300 directives are included in the program.
   ``The Commerce Department believes that the completion of the
internal market should benefit U.S. companies doing business in
Europe,'' it said. ``However, there is a danger if the 1992 program
is implemented in less than open fashion.''
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills already has complained
about a proposal to guarantee a proportion of television time for
programs produced in Europe. That would limit the number of American
programs that could be used. U.S. officials call this a ``local
content'' requirement, to which free traders object on principle.
   Jacques Delors, the head of the Community's joint executive, was
in Washington last week explaining to President Bush and others the
French view that this is a cultural matter, not a trade matter.
   Community officials and their American critics are giving major
attention to the setting of European standards for industrial
products. Products that meet these standards will be freely saleable
in the 12 countries. Those that do not meet them, will not.
   U.S. companies want to take part in setting the standards. The
Europeans say that only American companies with subsidiaries in
Europe can do that. More talks are scheduled between U.S. and
European officials on this point, but some directives have already
been adopted.
   Take lawn mowers. A directive that goes into effect July 1, 1991,
limits the noise that can be made by motorized cylinder lawn mowers.
A rule in effect since 1987 has made U.S. manufacturers of rotary
lawn mowers either lower the speed of their equipment or redesign
the engines. Sales have not been hit _ U.S. exports of rotary lawn
mowers to the 12 countries went up 221 percent between 1986 and 1988.
   But the Commerce Department said lower speeds could hurt the
performance of American mowers and redesigning engines could bring
increased costs.
   Or take wine coolers. On Jan. 1, the 12 countries banned the use
of the 11.5 ounce bottle current in the United States, the report
said. The Community wants a bottle containing 14 ounces.
   ``The ... bottle would be either too fat or too tall for existing
U.S. production lines ...,'' the report complained. ``The U.S.
bottler would incur the added cost of changing production lines and
maintaining an inventory of another size bottle.''
   The report said the European directives also have or would affect
telecommunications, auto production and forklift manufacturers.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Motoring: Smart, sporty and it's an estate - BMW 5-Series
Touring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMART and luxurious estates have become an attractive alternative to
executive saloons. None comes smarter than the BMW 5-Series Touring, which
arrives in Britain next week.
BMW still cannot quite bring itself to call the Touring an estate car lest
it detract from the marque's sporting image, but that is exactly what it is.
The tailgate lifts to reveal a carpeted space that takes a couple of golf
bags and trollies with the rear seat in use, and something as awkward as a
large rotary mower with the seat down.
As the sill is wide, low and - unlike the 3-Series Touring - unobstructed by
rear light clusters, humping such things on board is not difficult. Four
retractable tying-down points come in handy when carrying things likely to
move around on their own.
It is not even necessary to raise the tailgate to get at the load space. If
you only want to drop in, say, some shopping, the rear window hinges up on
its own. Naturally, a sliding blind conceals from thieves what is put in the
load compartment. Removing the complete blind and roller, or lowering the
rear seat backs complete with headrests, is a one-handed job using touch
buttons.
In every way it is an urbane and civilised car. Unless you turn round and
take a look, you would not realise it was an estate, not a saloon. It feels
rock-solid on rough roads. Regardless of engine speed, there is no body
boom.
At present, two engines are offered: 2.0-litre or 2.5-litre, 24-valve
straight sixes with power outputs of 150 and 192 horsepower respectively.
These engines, introduced for BMW saloons 18 months ago, should return at
least 28 mpg (10.1 l/100km) in normal use and give a gentle driver more than
30 mpg (9.4 l/100km) on a journey.
They are said to cut servicing costs by nearly a quarter compared with the
old 12-valve units. Within a year, there will be 2.5-litre turbo-diesel
option.
A five-speed manual gearbox is standard with automatic transmission (also
five-speed) a desirable (if costly) Pounds 1,150 optional extra. BMW claims
the two-pedal cars have much the same consumption as those with manual
gears.
The 520i Touring I am now driving is everything you would expect a BMW to
be. The engine pulls silkily in high gear at low revolutions, and hums
sweetly at 5,000 rpm-plus in the gears.
As the Touring is significantly heavier than the saloon, standing-start
acceleration is adequate rather than kick-in-the-back. The 2.5-litre version
is, of course, more urgent. But providing you are willing to drop down into
fourth or third when necessary, the 2.0-litre car is a vigorous and refined
performer on a cross-country journey.
Every 5-Series Touring comes with ABS brakes, power steering, central
locking (with deadlocks on all doors), electric windows and door mirrors,
and a two-section powered sun roof.
Buyers of the priciest 520i and 525i SE (for special equipment) models can
delete the sun roof and, for only Pounds 350 extra, have air-conditioning
instead. This sensible option is not available on the cheaper ones. I think
it should be.
BMW GB reckons it will sell about 2,600 of the 5-Series Touring estates this
year at prices ranging from Pounds 20,950 for a manual 520i to Pounds 28,100
for a 525i SE automatic. Four-wheel drive versions - the first BMW has made
with right-hand steering - join the range in June.
They will have 2.5-litre engines and prices are expected to be in the Pounds
28,000 to Pounds 30,300 brackets.
What will the 5-Series Tourings be up against? Not just the market-leading
Volvos and the Audi 100, Citroen XM and Mercedes 200-300 estates you might
expect but also large hatchbacks (Granada/Scorpio, Rover 800 Vitesse and the
new Renault Safrane, for example). It will compete on price rather than
sheer carrying capacity; as a bulk carrier, a 5-Series Touring is no match
for the really big estates.
BMW GB also sees the Touring seducing some owners out of their Range Rover,
Shogun, Land Cruiser and Trooper recreational four-wheel drives. With its
up-market looks, a BMW 5-Series Touring has Smith's Lawn and Badminton
written all over it. And, with all-wheel drive, it would not need towing out
of a muddy car park, either.

FT  11 APR 92 / Gardening: A self-starter that makes the mowing easier -
Tools designed to help gardeners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE BEEN using one of the latest Flymo lawn-mowers, the RRL429 Powerdrive
Electrostart, which must surely be the smallest machine of its kind to have
electric self-starting at the turn of a key. The rotary blade gives a 15in
cut and would be suitable for the smallest of gardens; yet, because of its
speed and easy operation, it will also tackle quite large areas.
This machine has all the refinements of much larger lawn-mowers, including
rear pick-up of cut grass into a conveniently detachable box; a full-width
rear roller to give the admired stripe effect when the grass has been cut;
and screw-adjusted height setting with a scale showing the height that has
been selected. (This ranges from under 1in to a remarkable 7in, enabling
enable the machine to be used for trimming meadow-length grass.) The
four-horsepower, four-stroke Tecumsah engine has power to spare and is
quiet, too.
This is a wheeled rotary grass cutter, not an air-cushion machine, and is an
illustration of the way in which the old, rather pointless controversy
between the manufacturers of these two types of powered lawn-mower has been
ended peacefully. Each system has its uses in the right places and
circumstances.
This new little Flymo is likely to make many friends. It is supplied
complete with an electric charger which can be plugged into any mains socket
for occasional topping-up of the starter battery; but there is also a
charger built into the engine so that replenishment of the battery goes on
continuously whenever the machine is being used. The price, complete with
all this equipment and including VAT, is Pounds 475.
I believe that the greatest acceleration in garden machine sales is
occurring with shredders, those invaluable devourers of woody waste in the
garden which make it possible to dispense with bonfires. Power-driven
shredders will convert all prunings and hedge trimmings into
instantly-usable mulches for flowers beds and borders, or for spreading
around individual trees and shrubs.
The old idea that such woody waste was bad for plants and soil has been
exploded. Huge quantities of commercially-produced wood chips and shreds are
being used in public parks, National Trust properties, botanic gardens and
those of the Royal Horticultural Society, to name just some. I have been
using shredded bark for the first time this winter and am very pleased with
the results.
Home shredders will not cope with the heavy wood used in
commercially-produced chips and shreds but, according to the size and power
of the machine, they will deal efficiently and speedily with the prunings
and hedge trimmings which make up the bulk of the woody waste in gardens.
Some machines are powered by electric motors and some by petrol engines, the
former recommended for town gardens because of their relatively low noise.
Petrol is to be preferred in big country gardens in which it can be
convenient to take the machine to the work rather than the reverse.
The nylon cord rotary grass trimmer, or strimmer, is another tool that has
found favour with the gardening public. It has taken all the difficulty out
of cutting grass close to walls, trees and other hard objects. The
fast-rotating nylon cord is so flexible that, although it cuts through the
toughest grass and quite a lot of even tougher weeds, it is turned aside
harmlessly by any hard objects.
Again, there is a choice between electric motors and petrol engines, most of
the latter serving the dual role of grass trimmers and brushwood cutters
when fitted with some type of metal blade in place of the nylon cord.
In this development, they must be regarded as potentially dangerous tools,
suitable for use only by trained people and with full safety precautions.
But, for nylon cord trimming, the petrol-engined machines are just as safe
as the electrically-driven ones.
They have the advantage that they can go anywhere, irrespective of an
electric supply being available. Certainly, these large machines have solved
the rough grass-cutting problems of many large gardens and parks.
I have found that some of the very small, low-priced electric nylon cord
trimmers have inadequate power to deal with anything tougher than fairly
soft grass - but with more power, the densest grass and quite tough weed
stems can be slashed through. It is the speed of rotation of the nylon cord
that makes it effective as a cutter, and that is what an under-powered motor
cannot supply.
Some nylon cord trimmers have heads which can be rotated through 90 degrees,
making it possible to use them in the vertical position to cut lawn edges as
well as in the horizontal plane for the flat lawn. I find this a
considerable time saver.
Power-driven hedge trimmers tend to get a bad press on the score of danger
and, undoubtedly, too many accidents do occur. Yet I could not manage my
garden without one of these tools, and it is really a matter of taking all
the necessary precautions and of buying a well-designed machine with
adequate safety checks.
Again, you have the choice between electricity and petrol as the source of
power although, with electricity, there is the added risk of cutting through
the cable while using the machine. But proper earthing and cut-out devices,
plus a safe method of trailing the power cable over the shoulder, will
reduce any dangers to a minimum.
There are many small hand tools and other pieces of equipment which, while
seldom written about, will save a lot of time and trouble in the garden. One
is a pair of secateurs small enough to be slipped easily into the pocket so
as to be available at any time for jobs as varied as cutting string to light
pruning.
There is also an ingenious little tool called the Widger, which I thought
had dropped out of use until I came across it in the big sundries catalogue
of Joseph Bentley Ltd, Barrow on Humber. This is a metal and plastic dibber,
seedling transplanter, tiny trowel and weeder all in one; so small that it
can live in your gardening coat.
Lopping shears can be great time-savers but they must have strong handles
and powerful blades. Too many fail to cut easily and the handles bend when
cutting really thick stems.
It is worth spending up to Pounds 40 for a good pair of loppers. It does not
matter if the blades are of the anvil or the bypass type; I use both and
have no preference.
Hoes need careful choice to suit personal preferences for easy use and
movement. I still like the old Wilkinson Swoe, a dutch-type hoe with the
handle attached only at one end of the blade which, in consequence, can be
hooked firmly around tough weeds to cut them off or drag them out, and can
also reach behind plants to stir the soil.
I find a spring-toothed grass rake useful for much gathering of rubbish in
addition to that for which it is primarily intended; namely, the cleaning
and aeration of lawns. A pair of long-handled hedging shears can still be
the best tool for trimming grass in awkward places and, even if you have a
hedge trimmer, shears are a necessity for some jobs. When shopping for
these, hold them in the hands and test them for weight and balance before
deciding which ones to buy.
Many garden chemicals now come ready-packed in the small, flask-type
sprayers operated by a trigger. I keep a supply of spare flasks for special
purposes, one for glyphosate herbicide for the difficult weeds; another for
Weedol, especially for cooch and other grasses; and a third in spring and
summer for a harmless greenfly killler such as perimicarb. The plastic pumps
of these sprayers do not last for long, but they are cheap to replace and
most handy to use.
Finally, in a garden of any size you must have a wheelbarrow. For the rough
and heavy work, I use an ordinary navvy barrow; but for all other jobs I
like a barrow with a ball-shaped wheel which will ride easily over all the
bumps and up and down any steps.

<TEXT>
   The Rotary clubs launched a project Friday to
encourage members to help clean up the Earth, a sure sign that even
the ``sensible middle'' has gone Green, a federal official said.
   ``These people are not environmental radicals,'' said Richard J.
Smith, a special negotiator on environmental affairs for the State
Department, after addressing about 350 members of the Evanston,
Ill.-based Rotary International.
   ``These are a very solid, center group ... who are tremendously
influential (and) are beginning to think carefully about the
environment,'' he said.
   Rotary International claims some 1.1 million members in 25,000
Rotary clubs worldwide.
   The civic group traditionally has confined itself to service
projects such as the eradication of polio. In tackling the
environment, Rotary turns itself to what some may consider a more
political arena.
   But the group's world president, Paulo Costa, said the demand
for an improved environment is too urgent to ignore.
   ``The rush for development has pushed our ecosystem to the
breaking point,'' the Brazilian told the group. ``We have to change
our habits.''
   People at the conference planned workshops to develop specific
strategies for improving the environment through their clubs. Costa
urged members to begin by educating themselves of the problems in
their own backyards.
   ``Education is the true, real key,'' said Costa, who said the
threat to the rain forest in his nation first prompted him to
consider the new Rotary project.
   ``I see Rotary as an umbrella organization, a clearing house of
information,'' he said.
   Rotary members were encouraged to start environmental resource
centers, address ecology issues in their own communities, and use
environmentally sound practices in their everyday lives.
   They were also issued a list of ``101 ways you can help
`Preserve Planet Earth.''' Among the tips: sweep rather than hose
down sidewalks; clean air conditioner filters monthly; and fix
broken things rather than junking them.
   ``You represent the sensible middle _ and that's what we have to
engage if the job's to be done,'' Smith told the group.

GROUP FLIES MUCH-NEEDED GIFTS FROM VAN NUYS TO MEXICAN TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

SANTA ROSALIA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A dozen single-engine planes from Van Nuys Airport braved thorny cacti and 
federales worried about drug smugglers to land during the Thanksgiving weekend 
at this town's tiny airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
"What's going on in Santa Rosalia -- a convention?" asked a baffled customs 
official at the border in Mexicali as one plane after another filed plans 
Friday to journey 350 miles south down the Baja peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
After all, this impoverished little mining town with its rocky beaches is 
hardly a mecca for tourists. Officials said the only group that uses the local 
airstrip is drug smugglers, who occasionally manage to refuel here despite 
attempts by federal police to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
But it is exactly this lack of cachet that makes the village an ideal recipient 
of the clothing, medical supplies and toys the pilots have delivered every 
Thanksgiving weekend for the past eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"We're lucky we have a harbor here with plenty of fish, otherwise, the poor 
would starve," said Jose Luis Nuno, as he helped the pilots and their families 
unload plastic bags full of cargo Friday evening at the airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
Nuno said the local Rotary Club will sell the hundreds of pounds of clothing to 
the poor for a nominal fee and use the proceeds to assemble baskets filled with 
enough groceries to feed 70 local families for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Without doubt, your efforts will be good for the lower classes here," said Dr. 
Miguel A. Montano, Rotary Club president and a hospital administrator. 
</P>
<P>
The annual pilgrimage from Van Nuys Airport is something of an occasion in this 
town of 20,000. At the end of journey, a five-hour trip that requires skill to 
avoid overshooting the one paved runway and landing in the cacti, the 30 
Americans were welcomed with cold beer and pots of fresh ceviche, an appetizer 
of raw yellowtail caught earlier in the day and marinated with spices and lime. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a neat feeling to help out directly instead of just giving money to a 
charity," said Ron de Moraes, 43, a television director who lives in Simi 
Valley. "And the Mexican people are so generous to us." 
</P>
<P>
Although most of the pilots are volunteer members of a Van Nuys-based squadron 
of the Civil Air Patrol, Moraes and several others joined the entourage after 
seeing signs advertising "Operation Thanksgiving" on bulletin boards at Van 
Nuys Airport. The participants gather donations of clothing, toys and medical 
supplies during the year from friends and fellow workers. 
</P>
<P>
Ann Hagen, a retired medical technician from Malibu, spent much of her spare 
time this past year washing and repairing hundreds of used teddy bears and 
other stuffed animals in preparation for the trip. "I feel like Santa Claus," 
Hagen said Friday as she handed out toys to children at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
The relief effort was started in the early 1980s by the Huntington Park Rotary 
Club and adopted by the Van Nuys group a few years later, said Lou Milligan, 
66, a Van Nuys car dealer and the organizer of the trip. The pilots spend about 
$150 per plane for fuel, and most take advantage of the trip south to visit 
nearby resort towns on Sunday, Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
The only snag the operation has hit was in 1985 when border guards confiscated 
the group's entire cargo, claiming they were more capable of equitably 
distributing it than the Americans, Milligan said. Since then, the group had 
not been explicit about its purpose when crossing the border, he said. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, the visitors attended a buffet dinner the Santa Rosalia Rotary 
Club gives every year in their honor. After sampling more than 20 local 
specialties, including fresh tuna salad and marinated giant squid, the guests 
were given small gifts, such as abalone shells and black coral necklaces carved 
from a nearby reef. 
</P>
<P>
The youngest person in the group this year was 11-year-old Heather Loring of 
Burbank, whose parents brought her to "teach that not everyone lives in the 
same way, but we are all people" said her mother, Carol Loring, a financial 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
"Every day in Los Angeles, you come across people in need," Carol Loring said. 
"We try to give at home through our church, but we believe in taking every 
opportunity to help out." 
</P>
<P>
Heather Loring had a chance to observe daily life in Santa Rosalia during a 
brief tour Nuno conducted Saturday for the visitors. Much of the village, which 
is tucked between a group of arid hills, has dirt roads lined with wooden 
buildings built by the French when they discovered copper here in the 1880s. 
The town's pride and joy is a prefabricated galvanized-iron church designed by 
A. G. Eiffel, who also designed the Eiffel Tower in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
But even at the church, where children met for a catechism class Saturday, the 
town's poverty was evident in the figure of a old man with a cane who 
approached the Americans for money. Later, as the bus left the center of town, 
the visitors could see on the hillsides tin and plywood shacks that Nuno said 
lacked running water. 
</P>
<P>
The town's fortunes, which declined in the early 1980s when the copper ran out, 
have improved lately with the discovery of gypsum, which is exported throughout 
the world for drywall, Nuno said. But at least 10% of the town's residents are 
unemployed, Nuno said, and many of those who work earn only about $3.50 a day, 
enough just to survive in an area where a carton of eggs costs $1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Heather Loring may be too young to understand the economics of Santa Rosalia, 
but the trip clearly piqued her interest in Mexican culture, her mother said. 
On the way back to the hotel, the girl was practicing the Spanish alphabet with 
one of the pilots.

   Mazda Motor Corp. said Kenichi Yamamoto, its 65-year-old president, has stepped aside for health reasons. 

   Norimasa Furuta, a senior managing director who joined Mazda in 1985 after 29 years with Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, has been named to succeed him. 
Mr. Yamamoto will serve as chairman, which in Mazda and most Japanese companies is the less-powerful position. 

   The company said Mr. Yamamoto has been suffering from a "crick in the back" since July and has been receiving medical treament. 
He made the decision himself, the company said. 
Shuichi Miyakoshi, an analyst with Nikko Research Center, attached little significance to the change. 
"There seems to have been no major blunder in Mr. Yamamoto's mangement," he said. 

   Sixty-year-old Mr. Furuta served in several senior MITI posts before retiring in 1981. 
At Mazda, he has been in charge of business research, and then corporate communications. 
A company statement quoted him as saying the appointment was "a bolt out of the blue." 

   Mr. Yamamoto started at Mazda in 1946 as an auto transmission assembler. 
He later joined the engineering staff and was one of the chief executives in charge of the development of the rotary engine in the 1960s. 
Mr. Yamamoto, who was named president in 1984, has been trying to strengthen Mazda by emphasizing specialty cars. 
He also pushed the company to begin production in the U.S. Mazda produces cars in cooperation with Ford Motor Co.

   The sands of the Saudi desert are chewing
through helicopter parts much faster than expected, causing
problems for U.S. anti-tank Apaches and Cobras, Army officers say.
   The helicopters belong to the 24th Mechanized Division's air
brigade of Fort Stewart, Ga., which holds some of the most forward
positions of the growing U.S. force in northeastern Saudi Arabia.
   The helicopter crews have trained in California's Mojave Desert.
But despite similrities in the terrain, the sands of the Mojave
did not scour as the Saudi sand does, officers and maintenance
personnel said.
   The 24th's helicopters include the high-tech AH-64A Apache and
AH-1 Cobra gunships, OH-58 Kiowas used to scout enemy tank
formations; UH-60 Blackhawk and UH-1 Huey transporters and those
fitted for electronic warfare.
   Despite the maintenance burden, at least 70 percent of the
aircraft are operational at any given moment, said the brigade
commander, Col. Burt Tackaberry, 43, of Jacksonville, Fla.
   He said the rate had dipped into the 60 percent range when the
brigade first moved into its desert camp 10 days ago. But he said
it would not go that low again after flying hours were reduced.
   Defense Department ground rules prohibit mentioning exact
numbers or locations.
   Tackaberry said the brigade does not have its full supplies of
spare parts yet, but he was confident it could start fighting a war
if necessary. The U.S. force is facing off Iraqi troops following
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of neighboring Kuwait.
   The colonel said the Apaches have so many backup systems - three
radio systems, for example, and two types of night vision equipment
- that the failure of one would not knock the helicopter out of
combat.
   But desert sand is wearing out the surface of the rotary blades.
Also, fine sand sucked into the hot engines can melt into glass
that chips and ruts internal parts in the turbines.
   Sand clogs the starting valves and it gets between the twin
panes of the windshield, reducing visibility.
   ``The sand is at work and so are we,'' said Warrant Officer
Richard L. Paradis, 38, of Pooler, Ga., a member of one of the
brigade's two maintenance teams.
   ``We go through a lot of main rotor blades, a lot of tail
blades,'' he said. ``In the desert, we're using about five times as
much.''
   The main engines have to be pulled and cleaned after every 250
hours of flying time, something that does not happen under usual
conditions.
   Staving off wear and tear on the machines requires all sorts of
ingenuity.
   Coats of rubbery epoxy paint are to be added to the front edge
rotary blades to slow the corrosion. The maintenance teams are
experimenting with ways of keeping dust out of the engines, such as
fitting the engines with the tough, flat scouring pads used in many
kitchens.
   Navigation is also a problem. The crews who trained in the
Mojave are having to learn from scratch how to navigate in the
featureless terrain south of the border with occupied Kuwait.
   ``Occasionally you see a few dried up lake beds and camel
herds,'' said Capt. Kelly Marunde, 30, head of air traffic control
and the sole female company commander in the aviation brigade.
   ``But the herds move and the sand blows, so you can't really
rely on anything being there the next day.''

CUSTOM CAR SHOW CANCELED BY REDONDO'S CITY COUNCIL; 
</P>
<P>
CHARITY: CITY OFFICIALS FEAR A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR'S EVENT, WHICH ATTRACTED 
SOME GANG MEMBERS. THE SPONSORING ROTARY CLUB IS SEEKING AN ALTERNATIVE SITE.

Fearing what they term a "gang show," Redondo Beach City Council members have 
slammed the brakes on a local Rotary Club's third annual Custom and Lowrider 
Car Show. 
</P>
<P>
The sponsor, the North Redondo Beach Rotary Club, says the annual event, 
featuring hundreds of elaborate low-slung vehicles, generates thousands of 
dollars for local charities. 
</P>
<P>
But council members, citing unruliness and the presence of gang members at last 
year's show, voted 4 to 0 Tuesday to deny the club permission to stage the 
event Oct. 20 at Aviation Park. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a Rotarian . . . but I can't in clear conscience support this event," said 
Councilman Terry Ward. "This is just opening up what we're trying to fight in 
North Redondo, and that's gangs." 
</P>
<P>
Ward remarked that the show could have included "the spray paint event and the 
drive-by shooting event." 
</P>
<P>
Such comments angered North Redondo BeachRotary Club President Tom Fouts, who 
said council members and the police officers advising them painted an overly 
threatening picture of the car show. 
</P>
<P>
"I blame the Police Department to a large degree for characterizing practically 
everyone who goes to the show as a gangster," Fouts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
He said the council vote comes as a blow to his club. 
</P>
<P>
"We're extremely disappointed," Fouts said. "Last year we made about $25,000 on 
the show. That provided the resources for a vast part of our philanthropic work 
for the whole year." 
</P>
<P>
Last year's show unexpectedly attracted 600 cars -- three times the number of 
the year before -- after a car show that had been scheduled for the same day 
was canceled in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
According to a city report, alcohol was smuggled in, police officers broke up a 
number of near fights, and at one point spectators surged onto the stage and 
treated themselves to trophies and score sheets. No arrests were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Police said poor crowd control resulted in several near-misses in a car-hopping 
contest in which hydraulic suspension systems are manipulated to make vehicles 
bounce up and down. 
</P>
<P>
Gang members, they said, were at the car show in force. Said Phil Keenan, a 
detective with the city Police Department's gang unit: "We were a little bit 
overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
Keenan told council members that an orderly car show could be held this year if 
the city staffed it with 10 uniformed officers, two members of the gang unit, 
two supervisors and five reserve officers. 
</P>
<P>
The Rotary Club, meanwhile, had agreed not to hold two potentially unruly 
events, bikini and macho man contests. At Mayor Brad Parton's urging, council 
members decided against a car show under any conditions. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we want this in our community," said Parton, one of several 
officials who referred to the event jokingly as a "gang show." 
</P>
<P>
Rotary Club member Phil Toomey, a Redondo Beach attorney, criticized Parton for 
painting car show enthusiasts with "too broad a brush." Parton replied: "Maybe 
it's 5% (who are gang members). But that 5% could be problems." 
</P>
<P>
Fouts noted that the first time the event was held, in 1988, it was peaceful. 
He said the only reason the crowd got out of hand at last year's show was that 
the attendance was so much larger than expected. 
</P>
<P>
"The only real problems that occurred were late in the day," Fouts said. "We 
didn't have time to get the judging done because we were only geared up to 
judge 250 to 300 cars maximum. People didn't get proper recognition and they 
got impatient." 
</P>
<P>
Fouts said the Rotary Club is trying to find an alternate site for the show but 
it is uncertain whether arrangements can be made in time. One site he said the 
club is pursuing is Alondra Park. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Kay Horrell said Tuesday she attended the first Custom and 
Lowrider Car Show and considered it a success. But she said police reports that 
gang members commonly show up at such events have made her reluctant to let the 
local car show continue. 
</P>
<P>
"For some reason it attracted the wrong elements," Horrell said. "I'm fearful 
of these kinds of events in our community."

   It was with sadness that I read your "Chilling Tale" (page
one, May 7) about GE's disaster with the rotary compressor.
It's tragic that such a valiant effort to upgrade
manufacturing in the U.S. failed because of a layered
corporate structure that told the boss what he wanted to
hear.
   It also is astounding to learn that GE was the inventor of
the rotary compressor for appliances and in 1986 "designed a
revolutionary rotary compressor for refrigerators." When I
joined Frigidaire in 1955, it had been using the rotary
compressor exclusively in its "Fridges" for many, many years.
In 1967 we brought the new RI compressor into production
without a hiccup. This new unit had many technological
advances.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In those days, as today, it was customary for appliance
manufacturers to exchange factory visits. These exchanges of
ideas and technology have been a significant factor in
keeping America the world leader in major-appliance
manufacturing. Where else can you buy a 21-cubic-foot Frost
Proof Fridge for $687 when the first 1957 15-cubic-foot
models sold for $700?

   Thank you for the fine article on General Electric. Having
worked in both the refrigeration department and the corporate
manufacturing staff of GE, I can say you caught the flavor of
GE's operating style: Act as if there are no problems and do
not, above all, give the boss any bad news.
   This fiasco is, I am told by many GE graduates, a repeat
of a very similar problem in the early 1950s. The parts of
the compressor were different but the results were the same.
Sometimes we Americans are so busy shooting ourselves in the
foot that we don't have enough time for Japan-bashing.

   We were surprised to read that in December 1987, Tecumseh
Products Co. "had quit" the domestic refrigeration-compressor
business. GE must have been equally surprised by this
statement as we were an on-line supplier of compressors to
its Decatur, Ala., plant at that time.
   Throughout our history, the G.E. Motor Group has been a
key vendor to Tecumseh Products and continues to supply us
with motors for all types of compressors. Tecumseh is alive,
well and working hard to satisfy industry demand for
energy-efficient compressors.

   The GE refrigerator-compressor fiasco is a symptom of Jack
Welch's management style. In the 27 years I worked at GE and
at the countless technical meetings I attended, there was no
mention of Reginald Jones or Ralph Cordiner when they were
GE's CEOs. Decisions were made on technical and economic
merits. Mr. Welch's name and his "vision" now predominate
meetings, as if he were the guru of turbine-generators. No
wonder the Louisville management did not have the courage to
confront Mr. Welch with any negative news.
   Mr. Welch's 1987 vision for Schenectady's
turbine-generator business was emphasis on customer service
while concurrently nuking the Turbine Technology Laboratory
and hundreds of experienced engineers. These were the
engineers and scientists who provided the product
reliability, engineering, quality control, research and
development, manufacturing support and true customer-service
support to the business. We are now working feverishly to
contain the damage caused by Mr. Welch's actions because no
manager had the courage to tell him that his vision for the
business was flawed.

   Powder metal is not a new material as you implied. Powder
metallurgy (P/M) parts have been used in appliances and
automobiles for more than 50 years. The average passenger car
contains about 21 pounds of P/M parts in critical
applications in the automatic transmission and engine, a
four-wheel-drive light truck about 30 pounds. Powder
metallurgy is probably one of the fastest-growing sectors
within the world-wide metalworking industry, because of
unique parts properties and production efficiencies.
   Our investigation of the circumstances surrounding the
design of the new compressor leads us to believe that the
real culprit was an unfortunate overall design and inadequate
field testing. We also have learned that the lubricant failed
at a low temperature, causing subsequent part failures. To
the best of our knowledge, the same compressor, used in air
conditioners, currently contains two powder metallurgy parts
that are performing without any problems.
   In the design and manufacture of any product, the proper
selection, specifying and testing of any material are
critical. In this particular application, an incorrect P/ M
material in combination with the wrong lubricant seems to
have caused the failure.

<HEAD>Rotary Clubs Outside Canada, United States Can Accept Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rules change adopted by Rotary
International will allow Rotary clubs worldwide to join their U.S.
and Canadian counterparts in accepting women members.
   Rotary International's council on legislation, meeting in
Singapore, adopted a change in the service club's constitution and
bylaws that will allow the 23,900 clubs in 164 countries to admit
women starting July 1, club officials said.
   The new provision will not require that women be included, and
clubs in some countries are expected to continue to ban them.
   U.S. clubs began admitting women in June 1987 after the U.S.
Supreme Court upheld a California law requiring service clubs to
admit women. Canadian Rotaries followed last November after clubs in
Montreal argued that exclusion of women violated the country's laws.
   Nearly 11,000 of the 420,000 Rotarians in Canada and the United
States are women.
   But until this week, international documents of the club still
called it an organization for ``adult male persons,'' Mim Neal, a
spokeswoman at the club's Evanston headquarters said Friday.
   The legislative council, with members from around the globe,
voted 328-117 to change the constitution and bylaws. The new
membership provisions will be sent to all clubs.
   If 10 percent of the clubs oppose the change, the decision will
be reconsidered at the Rotary International convention in Seoul in
May, Ms. Neal said.

   The first Aeroflot plane to land at O'Hare
International Airport in 14 years touched down with more than 100
young Soviet professionals Tuesday night and was greeted by American
sponsors bearing yellow roses.
   The Soviet airliner landed about 6:30 p.m., nearly an hour late.
   Sergei Chelnokov, chairman of the Committee of Youth
Organizations of the Soviet Union, said his group was tired from the
15-hour flight from Moscow.
   ``But if you look in our eyes, you will see we are very excited
to arrive in this country on this very historic occasion,'' he said.
   The Soviet visitors, ages 28 to 40, planned to spend 2{ days in
the Chicago area as guests of Rotary International before traveling
to Philadelphia on Thursday for a seven-day U.S.-USSR Emerging
Leaders Summit and to Washington, D.C., for a four-day visit, Rotary
officials said. They were to return to the Soviet Union on Dec. 10.
   The roses, symbolizing friendship, were presented to the
visitors, few of whom spoke English.
   ``We want to provide a nice sort of prelude,'' Rotary spokeswoman
Martha Wilson said of the floral greeting. ``This (visit) kind of
complements real well what we're trying to do.''
   Members of the 80 Rotarian families that will open their homes to
the Soviets used nametags to match visitors with their hosts.
   ``I'm really excited about it,'' said Leon Liss of Lisle. ``We
might even show them a McDonald's and the Sears Tower.''
   Aeroflot charters to Chicago stopped in 1974 because of ``policy
differences'' between the Soviets and the United States, Rotary
officials said, and Aeroflot flights to New York and Washington,
D.C., stopped in 1982.
   Regular service between the two countries resumed in April 1986
as tensions between the two countries eased, said Nicolai Lisachev,
New York manager for Aeroflot. The Soviet airline now has two
regular flights a week from Moscow to New York, and one from Moscow
to Washington, D.C.
   Lisachev said no regular flights to Chicago are planned
immediately.
   The Soviet visitors, who include television anchorman Vladimir
Pozner, represent 16 professions, including the clergy and the
military, Ms. Wilson said.
   ``We want to give them an idea of what the Midwest is like,'' she
said from Rotary headquarters in suburban Evanston. ``We (also) want
to show off Chicago a little bit.''
   The Philadelphia meeting officially is sponsored by the American
Center for International Leadership and a Soviet organization called
the Committee of Youth Organizations. The groups asked Rotary to be
host of the Chicago visit, Ms. Wilson said.
   Wednesday's schedule included dinner _ with turkey and all the
trimmings _ at a downtown hotel, as well as a visit to the Art
Institute of Chicago. Mayor Eugene Sawyer was to speak to the group
at a luncheon.
   Jim Duffy, principal of Glenbrook North High School in suburban
Northbrook, and his wife, Mary, were two of the 80 Rotary families
preparing to play host to the Soviets.
   ``We're having roast beef for dinner,'' Mrs. Duffy said. ``But
also, I'm making a chocolate cake _ certainly typical of this
American family.''

   The first Rotary club in the Soviet Union has
been officially established after several years of
behind-the-scenes efforts, the president of the international
service organization said Sunday.
   A tired but happy Hugh Archer, president of Rotary
International, said three years of contacts between Soviet
ambassadors and Rotary officials from around the world led to his
final journey this weekend through the Soviet bureaucracy.
   ``It was difficult from the standpoint of intrigue, in getting
the word to the person who could help us,'' Archer said in a
telephone interview Sunday night after returning from to Moscow.
   ``Nobody there wishes to speak as an individual. What we had to
do was get a lot of people convinced that it was OK to have a
Rotary club started in Moscow.''
   Archer finally got approval from Soviet officials for a
provisional club that will initially be made up of about 25
business and professional people from Moscow.
   Rotary International, which has over 1 million members in more
than 100 countries, has forged growing links with Eastern Europe in
recent years. In June 1989, Rotary established its first clubs in
Poland and Hungary since World War II, said John O'Brien, a
spokesman for Rotary International, based in suburban Evanston, Ill.
   Archer first met with Soviet officials in December to explore
the possibilities of opening a club in Moscow. He also visited a
group eager to form a club in Tallinn, the capital of the Soviet
republic of Estonia.
   In a key discussion Saturday with Deputy Minister of Foreign
Affairs Vladimir Petrovsky, Archer said he received assurances the
club can meet and select members without surveillance or
restrictions and that it will be allowed to maintain contacts with
clubs in other countries and contribute financially to the
association.
   Rotary's constitution prohibits it from becoming part of another
organization or being restricted by government or political forces.
   ``It all follows from (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev
because of his reforms that sort of paved the way,'' O'Brien said.
``But Rotary has not gone cap in hand begging to open a club.
   The members of the provisional club in Moscow, who have been
holding informal meetings for the past six months, range in age
from 30 to 50. They include two lawyers, three businessmen, a
theater manager and the head of a translation service.
   Archer said the group was delighted when told of the agreement
and immediately began discussing ideas, especially exchange
programs with other countries involving Rotary members, as well as
high school and college students.
   He said the Soviets at first had trouble understanding that they
were expected to help people without receiving anything in return.
   ``The concept of service as practiced by Rotary and other groups
is that you enjoy it'' without expectation of compensation, Archer
said. ``I think they got that idea.''
   Rotary, founded in Chicago in 1905, is a not-for-profit service
organization consisting of business and professional men and women.
It sponsors educational and charitable programs and has a budget of
$56 million for 1989-90.

   Rotary International, the worldwide service
organization, opened its first club in the Soviet Union on Tuesday,
expanding its network to 169 nations.
   The Moscow club has 25 members, including businessmen, a theater
manager and the head of a translation agency, officials of the group
said.
   The organization has never had a club in Moscow. It was evicted
from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia after those independent states
were annexed by the Soviet Union during World War II, said Rotary
President Hugh Archer.
   It was also evicted from 19 other countries ``where heavy
socialist ideology was the one selected by the government,'' said
Archer, of Dearborn, Mich.
   ``In the U.S.S.R., being a socialist country, it too had that
impression that Rotary was not a welcome member in its society,'' he
said.
   In the past three years, Rotary began receiving inquiries from
Soviet officials and citizens. The political changes that have
occurred in Eastern Europe ``opened the door even wider,'' and the
organization was invited this year to open a Moscow club, he said.
   Rotary also plans to open branches in Leningrad, Kiev and
Irkutsk, the official Tass news agency reported.
   Viktor Mozolin, a lawyer and business law professor who is
president of the Moscow club, said its opening was ``connected to
the whole process of democratic reform in the Soviet Union.''
   When asked whether the Communist Party and other Soviet agencies
did not already perform the humanitarian and service activities that
Rotary sponsors, Mozolin said there would be the ``duplication of
some functions which belong in this country to the Communist Party,
as well as our Komsomol and the unions and maybe some other
humanitarian organizations .... But I don't think this will be a
repetition of the functions.''
   Komsomol is the Communist youth league.
   The club is seeking to ``join together people from different
professions and various political views,'' Mozolin said.
   Rotary, which brings together community and business leaders to
build international goodwill, opened clubs this year in East Germany
and Czechoslovakia, Archer said.

FT  30 APR 93 / Survey of Executive Cars (14): Higher premiums curb 'hot
hatch' sales - Insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH POULTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A YEAR ago, insurance companies dropped a bombshell which wreaked havoc in
the performance car market. A GTi was the car to be seen in during the
prosperous late 1980s, but cheap power in the wrong hands led to an
unprecedented spate of accident claims. The situation for insurers was
exacerbated by car theft raging out of control.
By 1992, insurance companies had had enough and used the introduction of the
Association of British Insurers' new 20-group insurance system to raise
premiums for performance cars and introduce draconian restrictions in
providing quotes for high-risk drivers and people living in high-risk areas.
This, combined with recession, pushed sales of some performance cars into a
nose-dive.
Particularly hard hit were the cheaper 'hot hatch' cars. New car sales in
this market almost halved in 1992, compared with 1991, mostly owing to
prohibitive insurance costs. But sales of expensive performance cars have
not suffered as badly.
People buying such cars as Ferraris, top-range Jaguars and Mazda RX-7s are
older and prepared to pay the higher insurance premium.
Mr Robin Foster-Taylor, insurance broker of F Rauch, says the insurance
companies are to blame for making performance car insurance too cheap and
easily obtainable during the late 1980s. He says: 'For several years,
premiums were unrealistically low as insurance companies fought for market
share. By charging low premiums, insurers encouraged people to buy
performance cars and claims were intolerably high. Premiums charged now
reflect the true cost of performance car insurance.'
It costs between Pounds 2,500 and Pounds 3,000 with a full no-claims
discount to comprehensively insure the Ford Sierra Cosworth, a favourite
target for car thieves. But sales continue at a lower level as people find
cheaper ways to get their performance kicks. Typically, on a Cosworth
private buyers will fit an immobiliser and alarm and opt for third party
insurance at Pounds 500 to Pounds 1,000. The biggest buyers are company car
drivers whose insurance company will turn a blind eye to the occasional
performance car slipped into a fleet policy of more than 30 cars.
What has happened, says Mr Foster-Taylor, is that the buyer profile has
changed. 'There are fewer inquiries from 21- to 24-year-olds and the buying
age for performance cars has increased to 30- and 40-year-olds.'
He adds that the worst is not over, as the cost of insurance has gone up
enormously in the past 12 months, with three to four premium increases a
year. 'You're looking at premium increases of at least 15 per cent and in
some cases some 30 to 40 per cent for GTis. Premiums will continue to affect
the market for some time to come.'
Yet the impact on sales is selective, with a clear distinction between
affordable boy-racer-type cars and up-market performance cars. This is
highlighted by the contrast between Mazda and Ford. Ford says its XR3i
represented between 10 and 12 per cent of Escort sales. This has now been
reduced to 5 per cent.
Mazda claims its RX-7, an out-and-out sports car, has not been affected at
all by insurance costs: 'This car is sold in limited numbers and is bought
as a conscious decision by buyers who are prepared to pay the extra
premiums.'
Peugeot's 205 GTi is another example of the cheaper hot hatch victim. The
company says that GTis have fallen from 15 per cent of 205 sales to 8 per
cent. 'Increased premiums had a considerable impact on 205 GTi sales, but we
expect the market will stabilise as manufactures take over some insurance,'
says Peugeot.
Porsche in Britain has seen profits fall hard, with sales of 944s dropping
from 1,612 in 1991 to 945 in 1992, but the company says this is mostly as a
result of the recession. 'Premiums for our cars were high anyway, but we
knew we were going to be hit badly with the 20-group system and prepared for
it. As a result of premiums going up, we relaunched our own Porsche
insurance which offers favourable rates to Porsche owners, with premiums set
for three years. Many customers have taken this up,' said a Porsche
representative.
Volkswagen says its buyer profile has changed, particularly with its
introduction of a V6 engine, to older people who want bigger car refinement
but in a smaller car than a Mercedes-Benz or BMW. 'GTi sales have fallen
slightly, as people wait for the new 16-valve model, but there's been no
noticeable reduction in sales of other performance cars such as the Corrado,
Passat and Vento with 16-valve and V6 engines.'
Audi also seems to have come through the insurance shake-up relatively
unscathed. A representative says: 'With our 80 range, we are selling as many
16-valves as diesels. The typical profile of an 80 buyer is professional,
male, married, 35 to 39, household income of over Pounds 30,000 and more
comfortable in terms of insurance.
'The Audi 100 buyer is more mature still, with most having built up
no-claims discount. Being in a lower risk group means insurance is not such
an issue.' The company sold more than 100 of its 150mph S4 models last year
and is launching an S2 performance version of the 80 estate.
Many performance car manufactures are hitting back with 'in-house' insurance
schemes which guarantee a quote and deliver insurance as part of a complete
sales package. The fitting of car alarms and immobilisers is widespread.
The makers are also considering refining their performance cars and making
them less obviously sporty, in an attempt to regain lost sales. As a Ford
representative points out, the market is far from dead: 'The performance
market has been reduced but it is still alive. It's just the way things are
done that has to be a little different now.'

<HEAD>Philly Roles Out The Red Carpet for Its Largest Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE LLOYD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rotarians and their families have converged
on the city in record numbers, and merchants are rolling out the
welcome mats for conventioneers who are spinning a bonanza for
business.
   By Monday, 16,037 Rotarians and their families had registered
for the 79th convention of Rotary International at the Civic
Center, making it the largest such convention in the city's
history. The Convention and Visitors Bureau estimates that they
will spend more than $7 million just for meals and lodging before
the five-day convention ends Wednesday.
   ``We've had a great day,'' Tricia Cuddy, manager of Cacharel, a
downtown French couture boutique, said Monday. ``We've had a lot of
activity, and out of eight purchases, three of them have been by
Rotarians.''
   At Convention Hall on Monday, Prince Bertil of Sweden praised
Rotary International as being ``kind and generous'' for devoting a
day of its convention to Sweden, and said the organization's
programs are important.
   ``Since the founding of this colony ... the history of American
and Swedish relations has been one of mutual frienship and
respect,'' Bertil said.
   The convention set aside Monday as Swedish Celebration Day in
observance of the 350th anniversary of the founding of a Swedish
colony in America.
   Bertil was joined by retired Swedish tennis champion Bjorn Borg
and Jan Carlzon, president and chief executive officer of
Scandinavian Airlines of Stockholm, Sweden.
   Bertil appeared as representative of his nephew, King Carl XVI
Gustaf, who served as patron of the service organization's
PolioPlus Campaign in Sweden. The PolioPlus Campaign is to raise
funds to purchase polio vaccines for children around the world.

FT  24 JUL 93 / Special Report on Second Cars: Why it can pay to go foreign
 -Financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECOND cars normally are bought out of taxed income, which makes first cost
a matter of great importance. So, how can you limit the amount of capital
that has to be invested - or borrowed - to buy what is bound to be a
depreciating asset?
If saving pennies is important, it can pay to think foreign - to faraway
places where cars with strange-sounding names are made. Have you, for
example, ever heard of a Kia, Hyundai, Proton or Sao Penza? Possibly not.
But should you be in the market for a brand-new second car, make a note of
the names.
Kia and Hyundai are Korean; Proton is Malaysian; and Sao Penza, despite
sounding like a minor Portugese saint, is South African. Just to complicate
matters further, deep down they have a lot of Japanese in them.
A Kia Pride is really the former Mazda 121 hatchback (which, incidentally,
was sold for some years in the US as a Ford Festiva. The explanation is that
Ford owns a large chunk of Toyo Kogyo, which makes Mazdas).
Both Hyundais and Protons make use of a lot of Mitsubshi technology,
although Hyundai is pioneering new models entirely of its own design. And
the Sao Penza is a born-again, old-model Mazda 323. Oriental provenance
apart, they also have very competitive on-road pricing in common.
A Kia Pride is a tall, thin car of super-mini size with generous head room,
three or five doors, and a choice of 1.1 or 1.3-litre engines. The controls,
including steering, are light, it rides pretty well and it is cheap - about
Pounds 500 cheaper than a comparable Rover Metro, for example. Prices start
at Pounds 5,499 for the four-speed, 1.1-litre three-door, and Pounds 6,899
buys the longer-wheelbase five-door with a 1.3-litre engine and five-speed
gearbox.
Hyundai's entry model is the X2 1.3-litre three-door with a four-speed
gearbox. It costs Pounds 6,498, which makes it more than Pounds 400 cheaper
than the most basic Renault Clio. But if you fancy driving a sporty-looking
two-door, a 1.5-litre, five-speed Hyundai S-Coupe is quite a bargain at
Pounds 9,938. And an up-market Hyundai Lantra 1.6 GLSi saloon, complete with
power steering and four electric windows, costs only Pounds 10,298,
undercutting the cheapest 1.4-litre Rover 400 (without power steering) by
nearly Pounds 500.
Proton 1.3 and 1.5-litre four-door saloons and five-door Aerobacks resemble
closely the Lancers that Mitsubishi stopped making in Japan several years
ago. All have five-speed gearboxes and power steering, standard on the
1.5-litre models, is a Pounds 350 option on all but the basic 1.3 litre.
Prices start at Pounds 6,990 for a four-door, and even a top-model automatic
Proton Aeroback 1.5 is less than Pounds 10,000.
The Sao Penza is a South African-built version of the old Mazda 323 - the
car that was so similar to the last model Ford Escort that it was even sold
as one in some south-east Asian markets. It has a 1.3-litre engine, five
gears, and is equipped simply. Build quality is up to Japanese standards but
the cost is low - Pounds 6,623 for the three-door, Pounds 6,479 for a
five-door.
There are even cheaper new cars. The rear-wheel driven Russian Lada is based
on the Fiat 124 that died in the 1970s. It is unrefined, but owners say it
is reliable, long suffering and easy to service. (You have only to look at
Russian roads to see why these qualities are much admired back home).
A Lada Riva 1.5 four-door at Pounds 3,905 is a lot of car for the money. If
you do not expect too much - and do not plan to change it too soon - it is
likely to prove good value. The much more up-to-date, front-wheel driven
Lada Samara has its rough edges, too, although the engine (1.3 or 1.5) is
quite sweet and seems tireless.
Prices start at Pounds 4,580 for a five-speed 1.3-litre three-door. At that
kind of figure you cannot really complain about heavy brakes and rather
sloppy handling.
I have saved the best until last: the Skoda Favorit. Forget the jokes about
the old rear-engined Lada (sample: what do they call a Skoda Convertible? A
skip). The 1.3-litre Favorit is a smartly-styled, front-wheel driven
five-door hatchback or estate car.
Volkswagen owns Skoda, and it shows in the build quality. But Skoda prices
remain highly competitive, ranging from Pounds 4,849 to Pounds 6,372.

FT  29 JUL 93 / Technology: The little engine that could - A machine that
offers power from less fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An engine that provides high power on low fuel consumption is the object of
a never-ending quest for the car industry.
Mazda, the Hiroshima-based car maker, claims to have made great strides in
that pursuit with an engine that raises fuel efficiency by 10 to 15 per
cent, compared with conventional engines without losing power.
The new engine is known as the Miller-cycle engine, after Ralph Miller, an
American engineer who came up with the theory in 1947.
According to Mazda, its Miller-cycle engine
will combine the fuel efficiency of a 2,000cc engine with the power of a
3,000cc engine.
The improvement means that each car using a Miller-cycle engine will emit
600kg less carbon dioxide in a year, which, in effect, is equivalent to
planting 100 trees, according to Kouichi Hatamura, manager of the Powertrain
Engineering Promotion Group at Mazda.
Given the growing concern with environmental protection, 'the key to future
competitiveness lies in how much an engine reduces the amount of CO it
emits,' Hatamura believes.
Mazda's faith in the importance of creating an environmentally friendly
engine kept the company's development team working long after others had
given up on putting it to practical use in cars.
In the 1980s, no less than General Motors of the US, and Nissan of Japan,
among others, put a lot of work into developing the Miller-cycle engine.
The problem facing car makers is that increasing the power of a car usually
leads to lower fuel efficiency. Specifically, the power of a car to turn its
wheels, known as torque, increases in proportion to the amount of air and
fuel that is injected into the engine.
The energy that creates torque results from the movement of the piston in
the engine's cylinders that compresses the air and fuel mixture in an upward
stroke. The pressure on that air-fuel mixture causes combustion. Energy is
released in the piston's next movement known as the expansion stroke. The
larger the expansion stroke, the greater the engine's torque.
One way to increase torque is to push more air and fuel into the same amount
of space. The problem is that although it allows high fuel efficiency, it
tends to raise the temperature of the engine and create abnormal combustion,
known as knocking.
Mazda'a Miller-cycle engine overcomes that problem by keeping the intake
valves through which the air and fuel mixture enters the cylinder open for
part of the compression time. This prevents the temperature from rising too
much and thereby avoids knocking.
The intake valve is left open until the piston rises one-fifth from the
bottom and some of the air-fuel mixture flows out of the cylinder at this
time. The valve is then closed for a shortened compression stroke.
However, the shorter compression stroke means that the pressure is reduced.
And when this happens, expansion is reduced as well.
So Mazda had to find a way of keeping the pressure high so as not to reduce
the amount of expansion, which would in turn have reduced the torque.
What it needed was a new type of compressor to do the job.
Working with Ishikawajima- Harima Heavy Industries, the company adapted the
Lysholm compressor - found in some ships and in industrial use - for use in
cars.
With the Lysholm compressor, twice the pressure of conventional compressors
can be applied to the air-fuel mixture when it is pushed into the cylinder.
Since the mixture is already compressed, even with a reduced compression
stroke by the piston, expansion is not reduced.
The compressed air-fuel mixture also contributes to the fuel efficiency of
the engine.
Mazda plans to introduce its new engine in some of its higher-end cars in
about a year. It will be the first time in more than 40 years for the
Miller-cycle engine to be brought to practical use in cars.

<HEAD>Democratic Fax Machine Alerts Media About Republican Robinson's Speech</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 9th graf, `He said...' to make clear that comment is from
Blakely.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT CHARTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly two weeks after U.S. Rep. Tommy
Robinson defected to the Republicans, a facsimile machine belonging
to the Arkansas Democratic Party was used to publicize a speech he
was to make.
   ``I see a little humor in that,'' Robinson said Wednesday.
   A news release sent by fax to The Associated Press on Monday
said Robinson, identified in the release as a Republican, would
speak Wednesday at the West Little Rock Rotary Club.
   It said reporters could contact Kip Blakely for more information
and gave a telephone number.
   The number was for the headquarters of the state Democratic
Party, where Blakely is executive director. He is also in charge of
Rotary Club publicity.
   Blakely confirmed Wednesday that he sent the release.
   ``It really is a real deal. It did come from us. I'm a member of
that club and on the board and one of my responsibilities is
advising the press. We asked Congressman Robinson about three
months ago to come and speak to us,'' Blakely said.
   Robinson switched from Democrat to Republican on July 28, saying
he was no longer comfortable as a conservative southerner in his
old party.
   Blakely said he saw no problem with using a Democratic Party fax
machine to get news coverage for a Republican, and said he uses the
machine to relay weekly releases about the Rotary Club's guest
speakers to newsrooms in Little Rock.
   ``It was not like it was long distance,'' Blakely said, adding
that there was no cost to the party for the local call.
   ``Certainly I appreciate the free publicity,'' Robinson said,
``but I don't know if that will put him in good standing with the
Democrats. I think it's a very kind gesture on their part to let
people know about my speech by way of their fax machine.''
   ``I like Kip Blakely and I don't have anything against Arkansas
Democrats. One day they will make the same decision I have made,''
Robinson said Wednesday.
   Blakely was joshed by Ken Coon, chairman of the Arkansas
Republican Party.
   ``We make mistakes ourselves sometimes. I guess Kip secretly
wants to change,'' Coon said with a laugh Wednesday. ``I appreciate
the publicity. We need all the help we can get.''
   Blakely said he joked about Robinson during last week's Rotary
meeting. ``Tongue in cheek, I stood up and asked Mr. President
whether it would be the honorable thing for the congressman to
address us since we scheduled him when he was with one party and
switched to another,'' he said.
   On Tuesday, Robinson was introduced to a meeting of civic clubs
at Benton as: ``A Democrat, Tommy Robinson ...''
   The man giving the introduction said the information came
directly from a biography supplied by Robinson's office.
   Robinson replied with a grin: ``I will check with my staff when
I get back to the office this afternoon about the bio they sent
out.''

<LEADPARA>  SOME THINGS in the Rotary Club landscape are as unchangeable as the face of El
Capitan.  Rotarians still sing ("You are welcome at our Ro-ta-reeee"); greet
dignitaries ("Will all the district governors and their spouses please come to
the head table afterward to get their picture taken"); exchange flags, plaques
and pins with visitors; and do good works.;    All these traditions were
observed Thursday when Richard King of Fremont (second tenor and America's
highest ranking Rotarian) introduced Paolo Costa (first tenor and president of
Rotary International) to a crowd of 200 Rotarians and their spouses at King's
home club, Niles Rotary in Fremont.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Sharon de Sousa (mezzo soprano) even sang Costa's theme song, "Honor
Rotary," in Portuguese, the official language of his native Brazil and the
heritage language of many local Rotarians.;    An architect and business
executive from Santos (a suburb of Sao Paulo), Costa and his wife, Rita,
traveled the globe since he took office last July. King and his wife, Cheri,
have accompanied them for 140,000 miles, keeping a pace that King called
"exhausting.";    But some things do change in the Rotary world. Costa travels
with a new environmental message: Preserve planet Earth.;    Speaking as a
Brazilian "and a citizen of the world," Costa said in an interview after his
club speech, "What happens in one country affects all countries. . . . The
Alaska oil spill affected the water and animals of several nations." He is
mobilizing Rotary's unique network of 25,000 service clubs in 173 countries to
think green. (Rotarians have already planted 32 million trees worldwide in
recent months.) Though he hopes to raise money for a new "Green Cross" program
to protect the environment, Costa urged, "Don't put this in dollars, put this
in conscience.";    To promote his campaign, Costa has been meeting with
leaders in 38 countries and the United Nations. A scheduled meeting with
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev Jan. 16 may be postponed because of the
Persian Gulf crisis. (Geography note: There are now Rotarians in Moscow. There
are no Rotarians in Iraq.);    Costa also presented Paul Harris Fellowship
medallions (each representing a $1,000 contribution for scholarships to study
abroad) to Mae Avila, in honor of her late husband, Harry Avila Sr., donated
by Harry Avila Jr; to real estate agent Dick Irwin; to Barbara Rankin, given
by her husband, Ken Rankin, business administrator of Fremont Christian
School; and to Keely Warren, given by her father, Dick Warren, CEO of
Washington Hospital.;    On other matters Portuguese, Avila reports that
through the magic of matching grants, Niles Rotarians and their counterparts
in Horta (Fremont's sister city in the Azores) last year provided $10,000 for
equipment at an orphanage and special education school there.;    Digging in
locally, Rotarians will plant 120 trees on the Ohlone College campus within
the next few months.; (hbox);    WAY WITH WORDS: Architect Cathy Simon of the
San Francisco firm that designed the Fremont Main Library noted recently that
Portland, Ore., artist Larry Kirkland was responsible for placement of the
three significant words from poet T.S. Eliot -- "Knowledge, Wisdom,
Information" -- that march in handsome gold letters inside the rotunda. "But
not the fourth word," she cautioned.;    The fourth word is "exit." It's white
on green glass.;    And that brings us to the next library item -- an exit.
Bob Ammon, hard-working treasurer of People for A Permanent Library, presented
the library with a check for $23,754 a week ago, the last of the group's
$104,692 fund-raising effort. After six years, the group -- which helped build
the library and set up its gift fund -- now closes its book.;    Ammon also
turned in another library hat, that of Fremont Library Advisory Commissioner
-- a post he's held off and on for seven years. "Mayor Bill Ball told me, 'But
I already reappointed you,' " Ammon said with a laugh. "Guess I'll just have
to un-appoint myself.";    Anyhow, the job is open on the nine-member
commission. (No pay, but lots of lively presentations at the meetings held
every other month, says chairwoman Pat Lane.) If you're a library buff who
wants to serve, send a letter of interest to the Fremont City Clerk, 39100
Liberty St., Fremont 94538, or call Sandi Pantages, Fremont Main Library

<HEAD>Company Replaces Push-Button Phones With Rotary Dials to Fight
Drugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A telephone company is taking a
technological leap backward in an effort to fight the drug problem.
   U S West has replaced push-button pay phones with rotary models
at about 18 Twin Cities locations to make it harder for drug
dealers to conduct business with telephone pagers, U S West
spokesman Mike Breda said.
   Because most pagers don't work unless the call comes from a
push-button phone, drug dealers with pagers can't use the rotary
phones.
   Pagers have become a way of life for dealers, who often fear
their telephone lines are tapped.
   ``Everybody's got them,'' Lt. James Singer of the St. Paul
police narcotics unit said of the pagers.
   Customers order drugs by telephoning a dealer's pager and then
punching in a phone number or a pre-arranged code, police say. The
dealer responds by calling back or showing up with the drugs.
   In the past, Minneapolis and St. Paul police regularly asked the
telephone company to remove pay phones in drug-infested areas or to
adjust the phones so they don't accept incoming calls. But removing
public phones can hurt people who can't afford private telephones.
   ``We have noticed a decrease in traffic in at least a couple of
locations where we changed the phones,'' said Minneapolis Council
member Jackie Cherryhomes. ``I don't think it is going to win the
battle against drugs, but if you can affect it in any way, that's
important.''
   However, U S West's tactic may not work for long. At least one
paging company now offers a pager in which the caller can use any
phone.
   At least one paging company has taken steps to try to halt the
use of pagers for illegal purposes, said Steven Miorana, general
manager of MinnComm Paging in Minneapolis.
   A typical drug dealer will receive more than 1,000 pages per
month, he said. MinnComm now charges an extra 20 cents per call
after 500 calls to discourage excessive use, he said.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Motoring: A hot hatch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why have a family hatchback that looks exactly what it is when you could
have one, still with five doors and four seats, that could be taken for
Pounds 30,000-worth of high performance coupe?
That is the rationale behind Mazda's new 323 which goes on sale in Britain
on August 17, priced from Pounds 11,995 upwards.
The launch of the 323 is another sign of Mazda's determination to become the
chief niche marketeer in the world. It knows it will never be a VW or Ford,
Toyota or Fiat in production volume so it is aiming to fill gaps.
Britain is the first European country to get the new 323. For the time
being, there are just three models - a 1.5-litre four-cylinder in GL and GLX
trim and a 2-litre V6 GLX. Three-door hatchback and four-door saloon
versions will follow later in the year when a 1.8-litre engine will also
become available.
There was a lot of design input into the new 323 from Mazda's research and
development facility in Frankfurt, as there had been earlier with the Xedos
6 and 9 models. The result is that the 323 feels a thoroughly European car
with all the finesse one expects of a Japanese product.
Mazda says its objective for the 323 was to combine sportiness with
refinement, individuality with concern for safety and environmental
protection. Don't they all say that nowadays? Of course they do. But, having
sampled 323 fastbacks with both engines, I can confirm their sporty handling
and mechanical refinement. As for their looks, I reckon nothing touches them
in their class.
I first drove the 1.5-litre GLX (Pounds 12,595). The engine, although
smaller than the old 323's 88 horsepower 1.6-litre, is slightly more
muscular, producing a silky 90 horsepower at 5,500rpm. Torque (pulling power
at a given engine speed) is unchanged. The 1.5 GLX rode comfortably and
demanded little gear changing in urban areas, handled nimbly on country
roads and cruised quietly on the motorway.
Delicate controls, effortless power-assisted steering and minimal
road-induced tyre noise made it a most relaxing car to travel in. The
driving position was comfortable although tall people of mature years may
find both front and back seats on the low side for easy entry and,
especially, egress.
I rated the performance and acceleration more than adequate. Mazda claims a
108mph/ 174kph maximum speed and 0-60mph (0-96kph) acceleration in 11.9
seconds. Fuel consumption should be up to 36mpg (7.85 l/100km) in normal
use.
The 323 V6 I tried next was a hotter property altogether, with 147
horsepower at 6000rpm and wide 50 series tyres on 16in alloy wheels.
It is much more expensive (Pounds 17,495), which puts it into VW Golf V6
territory. Top speed is a claimed 129mph (207kph), with 0-60mph (0-96kph)
acceleration in 9.4 seconds. Only uncharacteristically light-footed owners
should expect to see more than 31mpg (9.1 l/100km).
Naturally, it felt far more eager than the 1.5-litre 323 but - as usual - I
preferred the smaller engined car, which has taller and more resilient 70
series tyres on 13in wheels.
Squat and sporty tyres increase cornering power and make for nervously
responsive steering but they exact a comfort penalty. Although it was fine
on a smooth motorway, the V6's ride was much more knobbly at low speeds and
there was a lot of tyre roar on coarsely textured surfaces.
All 323s have power-operated front windows, mirrors and radio aerial, a
pollen filter and seatbelt pre-tensioners. Driver's and front passenger's
airbags are standard on the 1.5i GLX and 2.0i V6 but not on the 1.5i GL. A
five-speed manual gearbox is standard on all 323s.
Mazda says the boot has class-leading volume but it looked too narrow to
pass my 'two sets of golf clubs in their trolleys' test and has an
exceptionally deep rear sill. Neither of which, I suspect, will do anything
to harm sales of this most glamorous looking hatchback.

Rotary International, an independent business and charitable organization, will 
open its first club in Moscow this week and hopes to start chapters in half a 
dozen other Soviet cities, the organization's president said today. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five Muscovites, including two lawyers, a theater manager and a 
professional translator, will meet officially for the first time after three 
years of difficult negotiations seeking guaranteed independence for the club. 
</P>
<P>
"The (Soviet) government wanted to appoint the Rotary club members but we 
backed away from that," said Hugh Archer from Rotary's headquarters here. "They 
also wanted us to join the Committee for Youth Organizations but we refused to 
have connections." 
</P>
<P>
There are also groups ready to start clubs in Leningrad, Kiev, Irkutsk and the 
Baltic republics of Lithuania and Latvia.

   The Lake Geneva Rotary Club's Farm
Drought Relief Fund got its first contribution from an unlikely
source _ the Grateful Dead.
   On June 29, Mayor Spyro Condos sent a bill for $1,200 to Alpine
Valley Music Theatre. Condos said so many people _ 60,000 _ had
been drawn to the area for Grateful Dead concerts last month that
Lake Geneva had had to hire extra police to help control crowds.
   In response, Condos said Monday, the band sent the city $2,000,
including $500 for the police department reserve fund and $1,500
for the fund to help farmers get livestock feed.
   Condos presented the $1,500 to Rotary officials Monday night,
during the club's benefit concert by Woody Herman's Young
Thundering Herd. Dave Tasse of the Rotary Club said Tuesday that
exact figures were not available yet, but that the benefit
attracted several hundred people and raised several thousand
dollars for the fund.
   The $15-a-ticket concert marked the club's first benefit to earn
money for the fund, said Rotary spokesman Daniel Curran.

   Ford introduced another 1989 model, the Mazda-engineered and
Mazda-built Ford Probe, in May. The two-door hatchback has a
standard three-valve-per-cylinder, four-cylinder 2.2-liter engine
with an optional turbo-charged 2.2-liter GT version. Transmission
is five-speed manual or four-speed automatic. The GT also has
automatic adjustable suspension, fog lamps and optional anti-lock
brakes and CD player. This reasonably priced car has been sold out
for months and Mazda is squeezing all it can from its Flat Rock
assembly plant.
   Ford also will offer a high-performance version of its Taurus
midsize sedan later in the year. The Taurus SHO _ for Super High
Output _ will have a 24-valve, 3.0-liter, 220-horsepower
fuel-injected V6 engine developed by Ford and Yamaha, five-speed
manual transmission, standard air conditioning and other touches.
   Ford has restyled its Ranger compact pickup and Bronco II
compact sport-utility vehicle for 1989. Both get standard rear
anti-lock brakes and a new 2.3-liter dual-spark plug engine.
   LINCOLN-MERCURY: The 1989 Mercury Cougar shares all features of
the Thunderbird, and like the Super Coupe, the high-performance
Cougar XR7 is supercharged. The 1989 Lincoln Continental luxury
sedan will be the first domestic-made car with airbags on both the
driver and passenger side. The '89 Lincoln Mark VII coupe has a
5.0-liter, 225-horsepower V8, anti-lock brakes and keyless entry
system.
   CHRYSLER=
   CHRYSLER-PLYMOUTH: After nearly a decade, Chrysler is replacing
its venerable, stodgy, fuel-efficient front-wheel-drive K-car with
the more updated Plymouth Acclaim. Acclaim is a roomy, if sparse,
four-door family sedan with a 2.5-liter four-cylinder base engine
and optional 2.5-liter turbo or 3.0-liter V6 with four-speed
automatic transmission. Acclaim's styling is smoother and more
rounded than the K-cars but still conservative. Its suspension
includes gas struts and provides increased control and comfort.
   Chrysler also adds an optional turbo-charged four-cylinder
engine for is Voyager minivan along with the existing optional V6
by Mitsubishi.
   Plymouth's Mitsubishi import, the Colt, is completely restyled
for increased aerodynamics. The two-door Colt hatchback has an
optional turbo-charged engine.
   Plymouth also will get a sporty, Probe-fighting Laser subcompact
coupe during 1989. Laser will be made at Diamond-Star, a joint
venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi.
   DODGE: Dodge's version of the Acclaim is the Spirit. Dodge also
shares the Colt and sells it under the same name. Like Voyager, the
Caravan minivan gets an optional turbo engine. Most Dodge trucks
get standard rear anti-lock brakes. A new 5.9-liter, in-line
6-cylinder Cummins diesel engine is optional on many 1989 full-size
Ram trucks. The Mitsubishi-built Raider sport-utility vehicle gets
an optional six-cylinder engine. The Dakota midsize truck also gets
a more powerful engine for 1989.
   JEEP-EAGLE: The Mitsubishi-built Summit sedan (a version of the
Mitsubishi Mirage) joins the Eagle lineup. For 1989, Jeep Cherokee
and Wagoneer have optional four-wheel anti-lock brakes, while
Wrangler comes in a new Islander version that offers bright new
colors and a 2.5-liter four-cylinder or 4.2-liter six-cylinder
engine. Jeep-Eagle also will get a version of the Plymouth Laser,
possibly in 1989.
   NISSAN: Two new models will allow Nissan to re-enter the
competition. The rear-wheel-drive 240SX sports coupe has a
multi-valve four-cylinder engine and comes in notchback and
fastback versions. The upscale Maxima sedan gets a V6 engine and a
Nissan-Bose sound system, optional on some versions. Both offer
options including heads-up display, which projects critical
dashboard information such as speed onto the windshield so the
driver doesn't have to refocus by looking from the road to the
gauges.
   MAZDA: 1989 offerings include a rear-wheel-drive minivan.
   MITSUBISHI: Chrysler's Japanese partner will sell two all-new
products through its own dealerships. The 1989 Mirage is a
subcompact sedan that has an optional turbo-charged, 16-valve
four-cylinder engine. The Galant is a compact upscale sedan; its
top model has a 16-valve engine and electronically controlled
suspension, along with optional anti-lock brakes. In early 1989,
Mitsubishi will introduce its Diamond-Star Eclipse sporty coupe as
a 1990 model.
   Mitsubishi's new four-door Montero compact sport-utility vehicle
has a V6 engine and four-wheel-drive. It is longer and wider than
its two-door predecessor, which also gets a the 3.0-liter V6 that
Mitsubishi shares with Chrysler.
   PEUGEOT: The French automaker is fighting for a U.S. comeback
with two luxury-oriented models, the new front-wheel-drive 405
midsize sedan and the larger, restyled 505 sedan and station wagon.
Engines on the 405, Europe's Car of the Year for 1988, include a
four-cylinder multi-valve version. The 505 comes with
four-cylinder, V6 or turbo-charged four-cylinder engines. Anti-lock
brakes are standard on most 505 models and optional on some 405s.
   PORSCHE: The German luxury-sports car maker adds anti-lock
braking, Blaupunkt digital cassette stereo, electric-tilt removable
sunroof, central locking and alarm system and electric seat
adjustment as standard equipment on its 944, 944 S2 and 944 Turbo
models. The alarm system and other touches also come on 911 and 928
models.
   VOLKSWAGEN=
   AUDI: Audi replaces its 5000 luxury sedan line with the 100 and
200 series, both available in a Quattra all-wheel-drive version.
All have five-cylinder engines, with a 130-horsepower version on
the 100 and 162-horsepower edition on the 200. All Audi models,
including the smaller 80 and 90 sport sedans, now come with the
``Audi Advantage,'' a package that includes a three-year
bumper-to-bumper warranty, free routine maintenance for three years
and guaranteed trade-in value.
   VOLKSWAGEN: VW brings three new models from Europe during 1989.
The aerodynamic, all-wheel-drive Passat midsize family sedan and
wagon, the wide-track GTI Rally specialty performance hatchback and
the Corrado, a $20,000 sports car all will reach these shores
during 1989 but probably sell as 1990 models.

   PORSCHE: The German luxury-sports car maker adds anti-lock
braking, Blaupunkt digital cassette stereo, electric-tilt removable
sunroof, central locking and alarm system and electric seat
adjustment as standard equipment on its 944, 944 S2 and 944 Turbo
models. The alarm system and other touches also come on 911 and 928
models.
   VOLKSWAGEN=
   AUDI: Audi replaces its 5000 luxury sedan line with the 100 and
200 series, both available in a Quattra all-wheel-drive version.
All have five-cylinder engines, with a 130-horsepower version on
the 100 and 162-horsepower edition on the 200. All Audi models,
including the smaller 80 and 90 sport sedans, now come with the
``Audi Advantage,'' a package that includes a three-year
bumper-to-bumper warranty, free routine maintenance for three years
and guaranteed trade-in value.
   VOLKSWAGEN: VW brings three new models from Europe during 1989.
The aerodynamic, all-wheel-drive Passat midsize family sedan and
wagon, the wide-track GTI Rally specialty performance hatchback and
the Corrado, a $20,000 sports car all will reach these shores
during 1989 but probably sell as 1990 models.

   Rubber duckies are no fun, a Department
of Environmental Management official said Tuesday.
   The DEM outlawed plastic ducks in Rhode Island waterways after a
race in Warwick sent 7,000 toy ducks floating down the Pawtuxet
River.
   The Warwick Rotary Club, which sponsored the contest to call
attention to pollution in the river, charged spectators $3 to enter
a 3-inch pink or yellow plastic duck in a one-mile race.
   ``This is not a good idea for a lot of environmental reasons,''
Stephanie Powell, of the DEM's division of groundwater and
freshwater wetlands, said Tuesday.
   ``If you have thousands of pieces of plastic being dumped into a
river there's no way they're going to be picked up. A lot of these
plastics would end up on the riverbanks, in the marshes.''
   Powell also said the plastic ducks do not break down and could
endanger marine life.
   But Jack Frazier, Rotary Club president, said volunteers picked
up the ducks and all but four or five were accounted for.
   The DEM has not received any complaints, Powell said.
   The race raised $11,500 for the Rotary Club's environmental
fund, which goes to local environmental groups, Rotary officials
said.
   The real lucky duck was Tom Defelice of Warwick, who won a
vacation for four at Disney World in Florida after his duck crossed
the finish line first in 51:15.

   Mazda Motor Corp.'s new two-seat
convertible is being billed as a sports car for the masses.
   The Japanese automaker introduced the car Thursday, saying its
base price of $13,800 leaves it alone in a segment of the market
that had been populated by the Pontiac Fiero and other cars not so
long ago.
   Mazda is counting on consumers to make the distinction between a
sports car, which its new Miata MX-5 is, and a ``sporty'' car, like
the RX-7 or Nissan's 300ZX or 200SX.
   ``It's our belief that many of those sporty-car buyers would like
a sports car,'' said George McCabe, vice president for sales of
Mazda Motor of America Inc. ``It's a sports car for the masses.''
   Prices for ``sporty'' cars have been pushed into the $20,000
range because of currency exchange rates and the addition of an
array of electronic gadgetry, leaving a gap in the market at the
lower end.
   Options on the Miata could push it into the $16,000 range,
officials said.
   Mazda began full-scale development of a two-seat car without a
lot of the electronic additions on the more-expensive models in
1986. Development costs were held to a modest $100 million because
it shares some features with the Mazda 323.
   Mazda plans limited production of the car. The company expects to
sell about 20,000 during the last half of this year and twice that
many during 1990. The assembly plant in Japan has a
60,000-car-a-year capacity.
   For now, the car is being marketed only in the United States,
with distribution in Japan and Europe possible next year, officials
said.
   The rear-wheel-drive car carries a 116-horsepower, four-cylinder,
1.6-liter engine. And that could pose a problem with insurance
companies, officials said.
   ``It's true that insurance has really impacted the sports car
category in the last couple of years,'' McCabe said at a news
conference. ``We don't expect the insurance companies will view the
Miata in a negative light.''

SOUTH BAY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;

<P>
NEW FUND TO HELP NEEDY YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In memory of Patrick Cragin, the Fleming Junior High School principal who died 
last month, the Lomita-Torrance Airport Rotary Club has established a Memorial 
Youth Fund to aid needy children in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Money from the fund will be used to help finance some of the club's existing 
youth programs, as well as to start new youth-related projects, said Kendrick 
Ching, president-elect of the club. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of his death, Cragin, 48, who was principal at Fleming for two 
years, was working with law enforcement and city officials in the South Bay to 
organize sports and educational activities to keep children off the street, 
Ching said. The fund in his honor will be used to continue such activities for 
children between the ages of 10 and 16, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The club has already received about $2,000 in donations, Ching said. Anyone 
wishing to make a donation or propose a new youth program should contact the 
Lomita Rotary Club, PO Box 578, Lomita, 90717.
