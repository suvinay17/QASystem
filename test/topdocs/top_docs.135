   These days you can hardly turn on your television or scan your newspaper without being reminded of the Vietnam War.
And the thrust of much of it is that we were the "bad guys" who pulverized Indochina.
This is in spite of the fact we now know what the Communists of North Vietnam did to South Vietnam and its people after we fled.

   The last war in which we were the "good guys" was World War II -- although in Germany and Japan today there are rumblings of "revisionist views" in which it is said that Hitler did much good for Germany and that we were as murderous as the Japanese, what with the fire-bombings of Tokyo and the atom bomb.

   Either way, these two wars and the Korean conflict are much in our national consciousness.
All are recent enough to linger in the memories of millions -- both those who served in them and those who waited at home and sorrowed for those who were there.
Reruns of "The Longest Day," commemorating the landing in Normandy, and "Victory at Sea," that stirring account of our navy at war, still show up on late night television.

   But there was another war of our century that is hardly ever mentioned these days and which has almost disappeared from our national memory.

   That is the war of 1914-18, first known as the European war and then, after others including the U.S. were drawn into it, as the Great War or the World War.
Only much later did a roman numeral need to be attached to it to identify it in our minds and the history books.

   The near disappearance of World War I from our national consciousness is usually explained by the fact that it happened long ago.
It's been almost 70 years since Armistice Day marked its ending.
There are very few left who fought in it and not too many who even have memories of it.
And much else has happened since then.

   But, curiously, wars fought even longer ago are better remembered.
Recently on TV there was a series on George Washington and his role in our Revolutionary War.
Books on the Civil War of the last century (including coffee table picture books) fill shelves at local bookshops; "Gone With the Wind," both book and movie, has become popular folklore.
Indeed, the Civil War has become a booming industry and the arrangement of grounds at Manassas can still stir controversy.

   So I'm not so sure that the passage of time explains the fading of that first World War.
Even a youthful septuagenarian like myself remembers it.
When about four years old, I was taken by my mother to the railroad station where she and other ladies served coffee and doughnuts to laden troop-trains headed for embarkation to Europe.
I remember the windows with gold stars on them.
I remember the epic movie "The Big Parade" (with John Gilbert) playing at the local theater.
Even now I still know a few veterans who came back from those fields where poppies grew until we tore them up again in 1945.

   I think the fading of that war a pity.
For it was a pivotal event in the history of the world and, more particularly, in the history of our own country.

   It was the first war in which the whole of nations were involved and the first in which the distinction between soldiers and civilians vanished.
All who lived through it in Germany, France and Britain were in a true sense veterans, as were those who lived through World War II.
So will whole populations be if we ever have another.

   The First World War, too, marked an irreversible change in the role of the U.S. in the world.
We became involved in those "foreign entanglements" George Washington warned us against.
For the first time the new world, in Winston Churchill's phrase, had to come to the rescue of the old world.
And now, 70 years later, the U.S., whether we wish it or no, carries the burden of the whole world.

   After World War I we tried to leave the world to look after itself while we retired into splendid isolation.
Doing so, we helped bring on World War II. Hitler thought he could ignore us.
Tojo thought that if he flung down the gauntlet we would not have the strength to pick it up.
Even Admiral Yamamoto, architect of the attack on Pearl Harbor and one who comprehended our latent strength, thought to do his conquering quickly and doubted our will to pay the price of reconquering.

   Only Churchill, perhaps because he was half American, knew instinctively that, once in, the new world would not withdraw.
And ever since we have not been able to.

   Today, in our presidential campaign, neither candidate talks of isolation.
Neither doubts our inescapable entanglement in the whole world; they differ only in their views of how best to meet that challenge.
From Latin America to Africa to Asia to Europe again, we have no exit.
We are not involved in Nicaragua or the Persian Gulf because we want to be; we are there because there is no one else to take up the burden.
And neither of those who would be president knows where next the burden will fall.

   I am not arguing we should have stayed out of World War I.
Had we done so Europe would have bled itself into total exhaustion.
Even as it was, that war paved the way for Lenin and his Communists.
Without our role, all of Europe -- not just half of it -- probably would lie under the yoke of the Soviet Union.
So it would be even now, no doubt, if we laid down that burden.
At the very least much of the world would be in chaos, and that would hardly bring us peace.
No, all I am saying is that World War I was pivotal in the history of our century.

   Most historians agree that the 19th century didn't truly end until the Guns of August sounded in 1914, ushering in the 20th with its devastating wars and changing mores.
The Roaring '20s could never have occurred in that old, dead era.

   So while it is right that we should hold in memory World War II, Korea and Vietnam, and honor those who fought these wars, we should not let that "first" Great War fade from our national consciousness.

   The nation where World War II began will
mark the 50th anniversary of the German invasion beginning Thursday
with a series of events nearly overshadowed by the startling
political events under way.
   Joining Communist President Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski at official
events will be Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and newly named Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first non-Communist to head a
Polish government in 45 years.
   Planned commemorations include an internationally broadcast
concert by Leonard Bernstein, speeches at Westerplatte, where the
war's first shots were fired, and an international prayer for peace
led by a televised message from Polish-born Pope John Paul II.
   The war has an enduring poignancy in Poland, which fought against
Hitler from the conflict's start on Sept. 1, 1939, to the victory in
Europe on May 9, 1945.
   More than 6 million Poles died, a fifth of the population and a
higher percentage than any other nation. The toll included 3 million
Jews, deported to death camps such as Auschwitz and Treblinka that
the Nazis built in the once-obscure Polish villages by those names.
   At war's end, 40 percent of Poland's national property was lost
and Warsaw was empty and leveled. In the capital, stucco facades of
homes still show the scars of battle.
   To some, the war's toll continued at the hands of the Communist
government that took power backed by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.
   ``We will pay homage to all victims of the war, we will pay
homage to its heroes and we will express the will to live in
peace,'' said Wlodzimierz Lozinski, a spokesman for Jaruzelski.
   The commemoration begins one week after Communist and Solidarity
lawmakers joined to elect Mazowiecki prime minister. The Solidarity
editor heads the first non-Communist government in the Soviet bloc.
   The events begin tomorrow night with a parade to Victory Square
and a changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
   Jaruzelski, who went to Siberia with his family after the Soviets
invaded and later joined the Polish army organized under the
Soviets, will lead the ceremony.
   On Friday, Jaruzelski, Walesa and others will gather in the
Baltic port of Gdansk at the 75-foot granite memorial honoring the
defenders of Westerplatte, where the German battleship
Schleswig-Holstein fired on a garrison of 182 Polish soldiers to
start the war.
   War veterans from Poland and the Allies will participate,
including about 70 survivors of the attack.
   Bernstein will conduct a concert Friday evening at Warsaw's Grand
Theater with actress Liv Ullmann and others in a televised benefit
for the U.N. agency UNICEF.
   Bernstein will open with lines from W.H. Auden's poem,
``September 1, 1939,'' and Samuel Pisar, one of the youngest
survivors of Auschwitz, will narrate reminiscences accompanied by
photographs and film of the destruction of Warsaw. Ms. Ullmann will
narrate Arnold Schoenberg's cantata ``A Survivor From Warsaw.''
   An International Day of Prayer for Peace will bring together
representatives of world religions for conferences and contemplation
on Thursday and Friday.
   ``The lessons we draw from World War II must be drawn for the
whole world, for international reconciliation and understanding,''
said Wladyslaw Klaczynski, an organizer.
   The pope is to address his countrymen Friday evening via a
television screen set up in the Royal Castle Square at Warsaw's Old
City, rebuilt after the being razed by the Nazis.
   Jewish groups representing the few thousand Jews who remain from
a population that numbered 3.5 million before the war, will mark the
anniversary with a photo exhibition, ``Jews in Struggle for
Poland,'' and a service at Warsaw's lone synagogue conducted by the
country's only rabbi, Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz, who arrived this
spring from Israel.
   There will also be wreaths laid at the monument to the Warsaw
Ghetto uprising and at Umschlagplatz, where Jews were loaded into
railroad boxcars for transport to the death camps.
   Solidarity, the independent union born in Gdansk, has scheduled
masses and concerts, including one by bands of miners and shipyard
workers.
   West Germany will send a five-member delegation of parliament
members.
   It had been expected that West German President Richard von
Weizsaecker might visit for the anniversary. But the tentative plans
were dropped because of lingering diplomatic tensions between Poland
and West Germany, concerning among other things a stalled West
German aid package to Poland.
   The United States will be represented by Secretary of Veterans
Affairs Edward Derwinski, the highest ranking Polish-American in the
Bush administration. The Soviet Union, France, Great Britain are
among the other nations invited to participate.

   Poland's only rabbi said Thursday he won't
join leaders of other religions in a prayer for peace marking the
50th anniversary of World War II's start because of a Roman Catholic
convent at Auschwitz.
   Organizers had pointed to the participation of the rabbi _ a
survivor of the Nazi death camp _ as evidence that Jews were not
boycotting the event, led by Roman Catholics and bringing to Warsaw
representatives of many other faiths.
   ``I personally will not participate in the joint prayers. When I
go to Auschwitz I cannot pray there because I am disturbed by a
cross and the Carmelite convent there,'' said Rabbi Menachem
Joskowicz.
   ``One cannot be barred from prayer at Auschwitz and at the same
time participate in joint prayers in Warsaw,'' said the rabbi, who
arrived in Poland in June.
   The World Prayer for Peace was designed to foster understanding
among religions. Polish-born Pope John Paul II is to give an address
via a giant TV screen in Warsaw's Royal Castle Square on Friday, the
anniversary of the German invasion of Poland that started the war.
   ``This is a moment for peace and reconciliation, a meeting of
international friendship ... a day of peace, brotherhood of all the
world's relgions,'' said Roman Catholic Monsignior Pietro Rossano,
rector of the Pontifical Lateram University in Rome.
   But Jewish-Catholic relations have been strained by the decision
by the archbishop of Krakow to abandon a 1987 accord to move the
Carmelite convent from the perimeter of Auschwitz, and by a speech
by Cardinal Jozef Glempany.
   International Jewish leaders were invited to the event but said
they could not come, said Mario Marazziti, a prayer day organizer.
   Marazziti said the convent controversy ``may be one of the
reasons but not the only reason'' for the lack of greater Jewish
participation.
   There are no Jews on the list of religious representatives for
the event.
   Marazziti said three representatives of the Jewish community were
attending the conference but they were academic rather than
religious leaders.
   Jacob Neusner of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton
Unversity called the convent dispute a ``heartbreaking conflict''
between Catholics and Jews that shows the need for religions to
learn to accommodate each other.
   Marazziti said he received confirmation Aug. 20 that Joskowitz
would attend the prayer and had only heard informally that he would
not.
   The Rev. Wieslaw Nieweglowski, a prayer organizer for the Polish
Catholic episcopate, said he did not know about the rabbi's refusal
to take part.
   On Wednesday, Andrea Riccardi of the Catholic Community of St.
Egidio that organized the prayer day denied Jews were boycotting and
pointed to the rabbi's participation.
   Joskowitz said he would instead lead services Saturday at
Warsaw's only synagogue in memory of the 5,000 Jews who died
fighting with the Polish army during the war. Events also are
scheduled at the monument to the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and at the
Jewish cemetery, large sections of which have become overgrown.
   Organizers of the peace prayer scheduled a trip to the
international monument at Birkenau, the main extermination camp for
Jews in the Auschwitz complex.
   Jewish groups and others view the convent as an intrusion of
Christian religious symbols at the World War II death camp complex
built in southern Poland mainly to exterminate Jews. Among the 4
million killed there, at least 2.5 million were Jews, and Joskowitz
called the site ``our biggest Jewish cemetery.''
   Protests increased after the passing of a Feb. 22 deadline for
moving the nuns to an interfaith prayer center farther away. In one
incident, an American rabbi and six students were roughed up while
being removed from the grounds.
   On Saturday, Glemp delivered a speech intended to quiet
international criticism after the Krakow archbishop's Aug. 10
announcement on the convent. Instead, the controversy seemed fueled
by Glemp's statement that anti-Semitism would disappear if Jews
abandoned ``anti-Polonism,'' or anti-Polish sentiments.
   ``I cannot believe that Cardinal Glemp thought what he was
reported to have said,'' said Joskowitz, recalling a recent cordial
meeting with him.
   ``I cannot speak for him but if I were him I would make some
declaration which would correct it. This would ... extinguish in
time the glimmer of anti-Semitism.
   ``I don't want Poland to become the country from which the flame
of anti-Semitism would start. ... It is easy to extinguish it now
when it is only a little glimmer but such a glimmer may in the end
burn the whole house,'' said the rabbi.
   Only several thousand Jews remain in Poland from a pre-war
population of 3.5 million. About 3 million Jews were among the 6
million Poles killed during World War II, and most of the rest have
emigrated.
   ``There are so few of us left in Poland and it would be a pity if
those few also left. I personally came after 45 years because I
wanted the Jewry to rise again on this ruin,'' said Joskowitz, who
survived the Lodz ghetto and Auschwitz to emigrate to Israel in 1947.
   ``I would not like to leave it all again if anti-Semitism starts
... in which case these few thousand Jews in Poland would lose their
rabbi,'' he said.

   Communist and Solidarity leaders joined to
mark the 50th anniversary of the Nazi invasion, and Pope John Paul
II called on all peoples to not use war to solve disputes.
   As Europeans commemorated the beginning of World War II Friday,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany expressed sorrow and regret
for the ``unspeakable suffering'' caused by the Nazis.
   In London, about 200 people gathered at the St. Pancras railway
station to remember their evacuation to the countryside to escape
Hitler's relentless ``blitzkrieg'' bombings.
   Rude Pravo, the Communist Party daily newspaper in
Czechoslovakia, called the conflict ``mankind's most terrible war.''
   Pope John Paul II participated in his homeland's ceremonies,
appearing on a large television screen overlooking Warsaw's Victory
Square in a broadcast from the Vatican.
   ``The memory of World War II, and the local conflicts that have
been going on for the past 50 years ... oblige all of us to persist
in the aim to eliminate war from all parts of the world, so it
ceases to be a tool for resolving disputes,'' the pontiff said in
his native tongue.
   The pope's speech was part of an international Day of Prayer for
Peace in Warsaw, attended by leaders of the Roman Catholic Church
and other religions. But Poland's only rabbi stayed away to protest
the presence of a Catholic convent outside the Auschwitz
concentration camp in southern Poland.
   On Friday evening, Leonard Bernstein conducted an anniversary
symphony concert at the Grand Theater.
   Solidarity leaders joined Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski
in a display of national unity at the Baltic port of Gdansk as the
country honored the small Polish garrison that the Nazis attacked on
Sept. 1, 1939, to start World War II.
   On one side of Jaruzelski was Solidarity leader Lech Walesa; on
the other was newly elected Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a
longtime Solidarity adviser.
   ``We should never again be weak, quarreling or isolated,'' said
Jaruzelski. ``Tomorrow, Poland must be stronger than today, through
its economic potential and most of all through mutual effort,
agreement and national reconciliation.''
   Sitting in the front row were 53 veterans of the legendary
garrison that endured the guns of the German warship
Schleswig-Holstein and staved off a determined infantry assault for
seven days.
   World War II killed more than 50 million people, including 6
million Jews exterminated by the Nazis. By the time the fighting
ended in 1945, the United States had forever changed warfare by
dropping nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   Kohl, in a speech to the West German Parliament in Bonn, singled
out the first nation to fall in the war.
   ``We seek understanding between the German and Polish peoples,''
he said. ``This is our duty and it accords with the yearning of both
nations.
   ``It is true that too many people in Germany and some abroad were
blinded and deceived by that tyrant,'' Kohl said of Adolf Hitler.
   ``Who among us can say with a good conscience that, confronted
with such evil, they would have summoned the strength to be martyrs?
And who among us can judge what it meant at that time to risk not
only one's own life but the lives of one's family as well?'' he
asked.

FT  02 MAY 92 / Bomber Harris: 'a tactless choice'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Norbert Burger, Mayor of Cologne, explains why a statue of the RAF's wartime
Bomber Command chief, Sir Arthur Harris, should not be unveiled by the Queen
Mother on May 31.
THE PRESENT period of European history should make us think twice about
raising monuments to heroes of past wars. The members of the European
Community have agreed to scrap borders between each other. We want to live
in friendship with our neighbours. This is a unique achievement in European
history.
We must, of course, accept that Adolf Hitler in 1939 started a war
unprecedented in its scope, its brutality and its outcome. We must hope that
the Second World War will indeed remain unprecedented. In the past
half-century the face of the world and the face of Europe have been
transformed. Enmity between Britain and Germany has given way to friendship.
Contacts between British and German people flourish on every level. One good
example is the partnership between Liverpool and Cologne, a link which
celebrates its 40th anniversary this year. Together with a delegation from
Cologne I paid a visit just a few weeks ago to our English partner city on
the Mersey. We have particularly strong ties in culture, art and sport. It
is a symbol of how things have changed for the good.
I do not anticipate that this friendship will be spoiled by the planned
unveiling of the statue. of Sir Arthur Harris. But I cannot say I am happy
about it. I heard about the plan last year. I wrote in October 1991 to Sir
Christopher Mallaby, the British ambassador in Bonn, and to Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, then German foreign minister, to say that it would be wrong to put
up such a monument. I had the feeling that old wounds which had healed could
be torn open again.
I want to clear up any misunderstandings about this. I have no intention of
suppressing memories of the war. I certainly do not want to unleash tones of
revanchism. There is absolutely no doubt that Hitler's Germany started the
war. Germany takes responsibility for it. I made this point clear recently
when opening an exhibition commemorating the '1000-bomber attack on Cologne'
on May 31 1942. My words were: 'We must not forget: Carpet bombing aimed
above all against civilian populations was first planned and carried out by
Germans.' Nazi Germany's attacks on Warsaw, Rotterdam, Belgrade and, above
all, Coventry, provide the evidence for this.
In the night of May 30/31 1942, Cologne was the target of around 1,000
British aeroplanes, which dropped more than 100,000 incendiary bombs and
around 1,000 high-explosive bombs, above all on the city centre. According
to the official figures, 470 people died during the night. More than 5,000
were wounded and around 100,000 were left homeless. In addition to this,
Cologne lost a great deal of its substance. The city lost its face. Many
historic buildings were destroyed.
Sir Arthur Harris, the supreme commander of Royal Air Force Bomber Command,
was responsible for the military and strategic planning of this first 1,000
bomber attack. I am very worried that this monument will idealise a man who
was partly responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians and
for the destruction of many cities.
It is a moot point whether attacks on civilian populations made strategic
sense. I believe that the victory over Hitler's Germany came not because of
bomb attacks on civilian targets, but through the fronts opened in the
Soviet Union, Africa and France, and as a result of the air battle over
Britain. But even if the bombing offensive is ascribed a different
significance, it has to be acknowledged that no other inventor or executor
of instruments or actions of mass destruction has had a monument raised in
his name. And rightly so.
No monument has been erected to Einstein on account of the development of
the atom bomb. And certainly this has not been done for the generals and
bomber crews who dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It could be
argued that these actions ended the war more quickly and avoided further
innocent victims. None the less, no-one - perhaps because of guilty
consciences - wanted to put up monuments to those who carried out the
bombing.
All this explains why I am against the statue. We are trying to build a
Europe of peace and friendship. It is particularly unfortunate that this
monument is being unveiled precisely on May 31 - the anniversary of the
attack on Cologne.
It is much more sensible to use this day to commemorate all the victims of
the Second World War with an ecumenical church service. Such a service is
taking place in Cologne and there is also one in Canterbury, to which I have
been invited. We must extend the hand of friendship to each other. And we
must build a peaceful future for the whole of Europe.

<TEXT>
   Europe today paid solemn tribute
to the millions of victims of World War II, which started 50 years
ago on Sept. 1 when a German warship opened fire on a tiny Polish
garrison.
   Adolf Hitler's troops quickly overran Poland, and the war spread
around the globe. In the end, 50 million people had died.
   By then the Nazis had shocked the world with the extermination of
6 million Jews, and the United States had forever changed warfare by
dropping nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.
   Many of Belgium's 6 million Dutch speakers woke up to a broadcast
of Hitler declaring war on Poland. BRT state radio opened its
foreign news report with a tape of the original declaration and
Germans cheering for their fuhrer.
   In London, a reunion was planned of some of the people who were
evacuated during Hitler's savage Blitzkrieg bombings of the city.
   Italy's leading daily, the Milan-based Corriere della Sera, told
its readers that ``Europe paid the price of its lacerations with the
loss of its political supremacy.''
   West Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl told a special Parliament
session in Bonn: ``We feel sorrow for the unspeakable suffering
which was caused to human beings and nations in the name of the
Germans and by the hand of the Germans.''
   ``We mourn for the many innocent victims from within our own
people,'' Kohl added.
   As he spoke, a group of young Poles sat in the visitors' gallery.
The group had been invited as a sign of reconciliation between West
Germany and Poland, which suffered more than any other country from
the Nazi atrocities.
   There still are nagging questions over West Germany's
relationship with Poland. Kohl has been under pressure from the
opposition Social Democratic Party to visit Poland, as he has
promised to do, and provide more financial aid to Warsaw.
   ``By delaying his visit, the chancellor is wasting good chances
to give a clear expression to the reconciliation process between
Poles and Germans,'' party leader Hans-Jochen Vogel said Thursday.
   The Communist Party daily in Czechoslovakia, Rude Pravo, called
the fighting that spread to all corners of the globe ``mankind's
most terrible war.''
   In Communist East Berlin, Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer called
today a day of ``recollection and sorrow'' during a speech to the
500-member People's Chamber.
   Fischer also repeated the commitment ``to do everything in our
power to insure that war and fascism never again threaten our lives
and the lives of our children.''
   Corriere della Sera called Hitler's Blitkrieg ``the technology of
a new Genghis Khan,'' the dreaded Mongol conqueror of central Asia.
   It noted that Hitler had the support of the ``German masses,''
also pointing out that European political clout plunged after World
War II.
   Some of the most closely watched events were scheduled in Poland.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski was to speak at Westerplatte on the
Baltic coast, where the first shots were fired.
   ``We will pay homage to all victims of the war, we will pay
homage to its heroes and we will express the will to live in
peace,'' said Wlodzimierz Lozinski, a spokesman for Jaruzelski.
   American conductor Leonard Bernstein was to lead an
internationally televised memorial concert in Warsaw, and Pope John
Paul II was to address fellow Poles in Warsaw by a TV hookup.
   But an event to bring together members of the world's dominant
religions to pray for peace appeared likely to be marred by a
boycott by Poland's only rabbi.
   Rabbi Menachem Joskowicz said he would stay away because the
Roman Catholic Church has not removed a convent from the Auschwitz
concentration camp that many consider offensive to the memory of the
2.5 million Jews killed there.
   Fifty years after the outbreak of World War II, there are still
many unresolved issues traceable to Adolf Hitler's dictatorship.
   They include the role of secret protocols in the 1939
non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union.
   The agreement allowed the Soviets to take over the Baltic
republics of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, and Western accounts say
the pact paved the way for the start of World War II.
   Recent Soviet reforms have emboldened residents of the Baltics,
now the site of a growing independence movement.
   The Kremlin on Thursday called World War II ``the most horrible
and destructive of all wars.'' The commentary from the official
Soviet news agency Tass then quickly lept to how the ``lessons of
the past'' should lead the West to agreeing with Moscow on arms
control issues.
   In Bonn, ultra-conservative Finance Minister Theo Waigel said he
did not deny ``one iota of German guilt'' for the war. But he added
that ``a one-sided view of history with the conclusion that only the
Germans are burdened with guilt would be unbearable and would lead
to dangerous condemnations.''
   Ultra-conservatives have long asserted that Soviet dictator Josef
Stalin also shares some of the blame for the outbreak of the war.

   On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the
start of World War II, Poles from Lech Walesa to President Wojciech
Jaruzelski remembered the conflict with sadness Thursday and vowed
``War Never Again.''
   ``They fell on the field of glory!,'' shouted soldiers assembled
for a torchlight ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in
Warsaw.
   In a symbolic roll call, an officer read out a list of groups of
the fallen _ soldiers, sailors, pilots and the millions of civilians
killed in camps and forgotten forests _ and the honor guard replied:
``Honor to their memory''
   ``War never again!,'' the officer shouted.
   ``Never! Never! Never!,'' the guard responded.
   The alarm read on the day of the Nazi attack by then-Mayor Stefen
Starzynski was replayed, and the wail of sirens as the German
bombers approached once more sounded in the twilight.
   Jaruzelski, wearing his army general's uniform, saluted as he
approached the tomb to lay flowers portraying the white Polish eagle
in a sea of red.
   Beside him was Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the longtime
Solidarity activist who last week became Poland's first
non-communist government leader in 45 years.
   On Friday, Jaruzelski will speak at Westerplatte on the Baltic
coast, where the first shots were fired, and Leonard Bernstein will
lead a memorial concert in Warsaw.
   But a key event bringing together members of the world's
religions to pray for peace appeared likely to be marred by a
boycott by Poland's only rabbi. He said he is staying away because
the Roman Catholic Church has not removed a convent from the
Auschwitz death camp that many consider offensive to the memory of
the estimated 2.5 million Jews who died there.
   The World Prayer for Peace project began Thursday with a solemn
convocation at Warsaw University led by Polish primate Cardinal
Jozef Glemp and attended by leaders of many world religions,
including Orthodox Christians, Protestants, Hindus and Buddhists.
   Glemp was joined by Jaruzelski, who noted Poland was the first
country visited by the war and remembered the 6 million Poles who
died.
   ``War destroys man and his material and spiritual heritage, but
it is man alone who sets it ablaze,'' the general said.
   ``Opposing war means ... (engaging in) dialogue, tolerance and
mutual respect, including endorsing the sovereignty of states and
the rights of nations to self-determination.''
   Glemp spoke of Poland's difficult past _ ``a country that
suffered greatly ... preserving always its deep religious and
spiritual values.''
   The primate, who has been criticized for insensitivity to Jews,
said Poland was a tolerant country where Catholics and Jews had
lived together. He said Jews were the most numerous religious
community besides Catholics in Poland before the war and ``suffered
the greatest persecution.''
   ``In terrible death camps organized by the Nazis, Jews were
killed for the sole fact that they were Jews,'' Glemp said.
   He departed briefly from his text to say he had made the same
point Saturday, in a homily about Polish-Jewish relations that later
was criticized by some Jewish and Catholic leaders as being
insensitive to Jews.
   Elsewhere, Castle Square in downtown Warsaw was decorated with a
huge sign in English reading ``War Never Again,'' and in Gdansk,
Walesa referred to the war Thursday as ``that great human
stupidity.''
   The conflict began at 4:45 a.m. on Sept. 1, 1939. The German
battleship Schleswig-Holstein opened fire on a garrison of 182
Polish soldiers on the Westerplatte peninsula in the port of the
Free City of Danzig, and German troops fired on the city's main
Polish post office.
   At dozens of points along the Polish frontier, the Nazi
``blitzkrieg'' _ lightning war _ began without warning, an invasion
by 1.5 million German troops that was to obliterate the last
organized Polish army units by Oct. 5.
   Britain and France, after demanding the Germans withdraw, honored
treaty obligations and declared war on Hitler on Sept. 3.
   Poles continued to fight _ in Poland in the underground Home
Army, in the West as pilots in the Battle of Britain or in Gen.
Wladyslaw Anders' army that crossed Africa into Italy, and in the
East under Soviet auspices. Poles were among the Allied troops who
entered Berlin on May 9, 1945.
   The Solidarity-dominated Polish Senate adopted a statement on the
war that said the anniversary should be a day of ``new horizons of
reconciliation.''
   Nearly one out of every five Poles died. Victims included 3
million Polish Jews swallowed up in the Holocaust, 15,000 Polish
officers believed massacred on Stalin's orders at Katyn and
elsewhere in the Soviet Union, 200,000 residents of Warsaw who died
in the capital's doomed 1944 uprising, and boy and girl scouts who
organized underground resistance units.

   Pope John Paul II, speaking to Poles Friday
via TV from the Vatican, recalled the horrors that gripped the
capital of his native land 50 years ago with the Nazi invasion of
Poland.
   The pope's speech was part of an international ``Day of Prayer
for Peace'' in Warsaw, attended by leaders of the Roman Catholic
Church and other religions, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of
the start of World War II. But Poland's only rabbi stayed away to
protest the presence of a Catholic convent outside the Auschwitz
concentration camp in southern Poland.
   ``On Sept. 1, 1939, with the invasion of Poland, began a long and
painful period of suffering of humanity, of Christians and Jews, of
everyone,'' the pontiff said, his image appearing on a large TV
screen overlooking Warsaw's Victory Square.
   ``Fifty years later, what sounds on Warsaw streets is not the
echo of heavy soldier's boots ... but the light and friendly steps
of pilgrims, men and women professing different faiths, who come
from all parts of the world. They have no power other than the power
of memories, which stimulates reflection and fervent prayer for
peace,'' the pontiff said in Polish.
   ``The memory of World War II, and the local conflicts that have
been going on for the past 50 years, and those which still
tragically continue, obliges all of us to persist in the aim to
eliminate war from all parts of the world, so it ceases to be a tool
for resolving disputes,'' he said.
   In Warsaw, banners of black changing into Poland's white and red
colors hung from the windows of the Royal Castle, painstakingly
rebuilt in the 1970s after being leveled during the war along with
much of Warsaw.
   Around the square hung a rainbow banner decorated with a dove and
``Peace'' written in many languages. A huge billboard proclaimed:
``War Never Again.''
   Photographs of the destruction of Warsaw were shown on a TV
screen set up for the pope's address, and smoke was released from
the castle tower to recall its burning in September 1939 after being
struck by a German bomb.
   On Friday evening, Leonard Bernstein conducted an anniversary
symphony concert at the Grand Theater.
   Earlier, Solidarity leaders joined Communist President Wojciech
Jaruzelski in a display of national unity at the Baltic port of
Gdansk as the country honored the small Polish garrison that exactly
50 years ago bore the first fierce Nazi onslaught of World War II.
   On one side of Jaruzelski was Solidarity leader Lech Walesa; on
the other was newly elected Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a
longtime union adviser.
   A third senior Solidarity adviser, Senate Speaker Andrzej
Stelmachowski, stood a few steps behind the president, who used the
occasion to stress the theme of national understanding.
   ``On this day of great national memories we look not only into
the past but also into the future, into the near future and that
which is still far ahead,'' said the president.
   ``We should never again be weak, quarreling or isolated,'' said
Jaruzelski. ``Tomorrow, Poland must be stronger than today, through
its economic potential and most of all through mutual effort,
agreement and national reconciliation.''
   Sitting in the front row were 53 veterans of the legendary
garrison that endured the guns of the German warship
Schleswig-Holstein and staved off a determined infantry assault for
seven days.
   ``I shot ... at the enemy. It was my duty,'' said Wiktor
Bialous-Bielas, 73, wearing his uniform and holding a sword as he
recalled the morning 50 years ago when the war began.
   World War II began with the battleship's opening salvo on
Westerplatte, a Polish outpost in then pro-German Free City of
Danzig, at 4:45 a.m. on Sept. 1, 1939.
   Isolated from the rest of Poland, the stubborn resistance of the
182 Polish soldiers on Westerplatte served as an inspiration for
Poles who continued the battle against Hitler until the march into
Berlin nearly six years later.
   Jaruzelski and Mazowiecki returned to Warsaw after the ceremony,
while Walesa attended a Solidarity Mass celebrated by Gdansk Bishop
Tadeusz Goclowski in a wooded glade nearby.
   Earlier, Walesa, Mazowiecki and Senate Speaker Andrzej
Stelmachowski _ another Solidarity activist _ visited the workers'
monument erected by the union in 1980 in front of the Lenin
Shipyard, where it was born.
   Mazowiecki laid red and white flowers at the towering columns
dedicated to workers killed during riots along the Baltic coast in
1970.
   The Solidarity leaders then bowed to the crowd and Walesa led the
singing of the Polish national anthem.
   Stelmachowski, viewing the former political prisoners celebrating
their victories against Communist control, said: ``I still have an
impression that I am playing a strange part in a very strange
theater.''

<TEXT>
   Polish Cardinal Josef Glemp said in an interview
published Saturday that an agreement to move a convent away from
Auschwitz should be renegotiated because the cardinals who signed it
didn't understand the issue.
   Glemp, the Roman Catholic prelate of Poland, said that moving the
Carmelite convent would be a ``scandal'' and ``offensive'' because
the nuns who live there are entitled to pray for Christians who died
at the Nazis' Auschwitz death camp.
   He criticized fellow Polish Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, saying
he acted too hastily and ignored Polish public opinion when he and
others signed a 1987 international accord to move the convent.
   Macharski, speaking Saturday at Birkenau near Auschwitz, urged an
end to ``hostility and hatred of Judaism.''
   Macharski addressed several thousand people who marched about a
half mile along the railroad tracks from Birkenau to the former of
the Auschwitz giant crematories. The procession was part of a World
Day of Prayer for Peace organized by the church to mark the
anniversary of the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany.
   In Chicago, several Jewish leader rejected invitations to attend
an interfaith service planned for Glemp's visit to Chicago scheduled
for Sept. 21-25.
   Rabbi Shlomo Levine, president of the Chicago Board of Rabbis,
said, ``I cannot in good conscience be part of an event honoring
him.''
   Rabbi Herman Schaalman, a former president of the board, and
Barry Morrison, regional director of the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith, said they would not attend the Sept. 25 service and
reception.
   Glemp's impromptu interview, given to Italian reporters in Poland
on Friday, appeared in several Italian newspapers.
   The reports contained the primate's first published remarks on
the matter since he stirred controversy last month by saying Polish
anti-Semitism would disappear if Jews would abandon their
anti-Polish sentiments.
   He also offended many Jews by suggesting Jews helped spread
communism, and by saying some Jews collaborated with Nazis during
World War II or as businessmen neglected and detested Poles.
   In the remarks published Saturday, Glemp said the Auschwitz
controversy could be settled. He was quoted as saying, ``Oh, we will
resolve it ... with patience. One needs to reflect a bit. There are
some Jewish circles who have let themselves be carried away by
nerves.''
   Jewish groups say the convent and its Christian religious symbols
offend the memory of the 2.5 million Jews who died there. Several
Jewish protesters recently entered to convent grounds to demand that
the convent be moved.
   Glemp spoke to reporters from Rome's La Repubblica and Il
Messaggero newspapers, Milan's Il Giornale, and the Catholic daily
Avvenire during a reception in Warsaw. Glemp was among the religious
leaders participating in joint prayers for peace on the 50th
anniversary of the start of World War II.
   Friday's ceremony was boycotted by Poland's rabbi, Menachem
Joszowicz, because of the presence of the Carmelite convent a few
feet from the fence surrounding the death camp.
   In an accord signed in Geneva in 1987 by Catholic and Jewish
leaders, the nuns were supposed to have moved by Feb. 22 to an
interfaith prayer center to be built several thousand yards away.
But the deadline passed without anything happening, and the center
has yet to be built.
   On Aug. 19, Macharski _ Polish-born Pope John Paul II's successor
as archbishop of Krakow _ said he was suspending the accord because
of ``aggressive'' demands and protests by Jewish activists at the
convent.
   When a reporter said the accord was signed by top church
officials, Glemp responded: ``No, by Cardinal Macharski and a group
of men who are not competent (in the matter),'' La Repubblica said.
   In addition to Macharski, French cardinals Jean-Marie Lustiger
and Albert Decourtray and Belgian Cardinal Godfried Danneels signed
the 1987 agreement.
   ``I want this accord to be renegotiated,'' Glemp was quoted as
saying. ``It has to be done by competent people and not by just any
cardinal who doesn't understand the things. ...''
   ``It's a scandal to expel the nuns from the convent,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``What do we have to do? Put them in tents? Who do
the nuns offend by praying next to the wall of the concentration
camp?''
   ``Our people don't understand. The Jews should understand that
devoting oneself to a life of prayer near the place where Christians
were martyred doesn't offend their feelings.''
   Asked if the ecumenical center would ever be built, he said there
was no money for it right now because of the nation's economic
crisis.
   When asked if Jews, including Americans, could help pay for it,
he said, ``Yes, I think so. But first there is a need to
re-establish a bit of calm.''
   Theo Klein, former president of the Representative Council of
Jewish Institutions of France and one of the signatories of the 1987
agreement, said in an interview on Radio Monte-Carlo:
   ``If he wants to renegotiate the accord, he will have to
renegotiate with himself. I don't see how any Jewish authority would
accept to renegotiate this accord with Monsignor Glemp.''

   After years of silence and anti-Semitism,
Poland is re-evaluating its relationship to the Jews, once the
country's largest minority and now mostly a memory in abandoned
synagogues and forsaken graveyards.
   On April 14, Poles will begin a weeklong observance of the 45th
anniversary of the heroic rising of Warsaw Jews against the Nazi
occupiers.
   The commemoration, which will bring the largest delegation ever
from Israel, follows a rare public self-criticism issued last month
by Poland's communist party about anti-Semitic purges 20 years ago.
   Both the Warsaw anniversary and the party's self-criticism have
rekindled a simmering debate about whether Jews and Poles, who
lived side by side for most of Poland's 1,000 years of recorded
history, will ever be able to repair their sundered relationship.
   Poland once was known for its tolerant attitude to the Jews.
   From the Middle Ages to the 19th century, it guaranteed Jews
legal privileges and limited self-government. The Polish king was
regularly prayed for in synagogues around the world.
   By the beginning of World War II, Poland's 3.5 million Jews
comprised 10 percent of the population, the backbone of its middle
class. About 40 percent of Warsaw was Jewish.
   But as a result of the Nazi Holocaust and subsequent waves of
emigration, the number of Jews living in Poland today has fallen to
about 10,000 out of a population of 37.5 million.
   A visit to Warsaw's only synagogue on a Saturday morning shows
just 40 worshipers, mostly elderly men. There are no rabbis in
Poland.
   The 45th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising _ the
monthlong resistance to the Nazi drive to liquidate the ghetto's
last 70,000 inhabitants _is being treated by the government as an
opportunity to honor Polish Jews and stress the mutual suffering of
Poles and Jews under the Nazis.
   But the official apology for the 1968 purges is a reminder of
the persistent strains of anti-Semitism that have marred
Polish-Jewish relations through the centuries.
   In March, Trybuna Ludu, the official newspaper of the Polish
United Workers (communist) Party, for the first time acknowledged
that anti-Semitism was a decisive factor in the 1968 purge and that
innocent people were harmed.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban, himself of Jewish descent,
said in an interview after the party statement that anti-Semitism
no longer exists in public life and among the younger generation
``it is practically nonexistent.''
   But Warsaw psychologist Kostek Gebert, a member of a budding
movement of Jews who in recent years have returned to their
ancestors' faith, said the official view is too rosy.
   ``Polish culture, the Polish identity is permeated with
anti-Semitism and I can't see any imaginable way of this fact being
corrected,'' Gebert said.
   ``The point is that in Poland a respectable person can be
anti-Semitic,'' he said. In other countries, he said, anti-Semitism
is like syphilis. ``You can have it but a gentleman doesn't show it
off.''
   During World War II, nearly 3 million Polish Jews were killed by
the Nazis. The death camps of Auschwitz-Birkenau, Treblinka,
Majdanek, Belzec, Chelmo and Sobibor were all on what is now Polish
territory.
   But although Poland was the site of much of the killing, most
Poles bridle at the view, common outside Poland and reflected in
the French documentary film ``Shoah,'' that Poles to some degree
were accomplices in the Holocaust.
   The dominant viewpoint here is that both Poles and Jews were
victims of the Nazis, and that Poles did what was within their
power to thwart the tragedy.
   Indeed, of the gentiles honored by Israel as Righteous Among
Nations for assisting Jews during the war, 1,700 were Poles, more
than in other country. And it was the Polish underground that
smuggled evidence of the existence of the death camps to London
during the war.
   But for all the examples of Poles coming to the aid of Jews,
examples can be found in recent history of Polish cruelty to Jews.
   Europe's last pogrom claimed dozens of Jewish lives in the
southern Polish city of Kielce in 1946. The 1968 purges forced
13,000 Jews from the country. During the 1980-81 Solidarity labor
upheaval, anti-Semitic charges were leveled against union activists.
   Nevertheless, there are signs that Poland is trying to put away
its anti-Semitic legacy.
   For the April 19 anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the
government is creating a memorial route.
   The government is also sprucing up Jewish monuments and
cemeteries around the country and establishing a kosher kitchen for
the 4,500 foreign visitors, principally from Israel and the United
States, expected for the Warsaw anniversary.
   Reflecting a desire to clarify attitudes about Jews in Polish
history, about 100 Polish scholars attended a meeting of historians
in Jerusalem in early February on the Holocaust.
   ``The Polish side ... presented the view that we had not done
enough and that we must admit that we are guilty of at least the
sin of indifference towards those who had been condemned,'' said
historian Krystyna Kersten, describing the conference in the
underground newspaper Tygodnik Mazowsze.

   Prayers and songs filled the air Tuesday
as thousands remembered the Jewish men and women who fought Nazi
Germany and died in the Warsaw ghetto 45 years ago.
   Late in the day, anti-Israeli Arab students marched to the main
monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and a PLO delegation laid a
wreath.
   The ceremony in which prayers, songs and flowers were offered in
memory of the dead took place at midday on the broad plaza in front
of the Ghetto Fighters Monument.
   At 4:30 p.m., about 25 Arab and African students arrived at the
same site carrying banners criticizing Israeli conduct in the
occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. They were
joined by a delegation from the Palestine Liberation Organization
diplomatic mission to Poland.
   As police looked on, the PLO group laid a wreath of white
lillies two yards from the wreath presented by the state of Israel.
   The wreath, draped with a colorful Arab scarf, said, ``From the
fallen in the Palestinian uprising to the heroes of the Warsaw
Ghetto Uprising.''
   Exactly 45 years ago Tuesday, heavily armed squadrons of Nazi
troops entered the walled Jewish quarter of Warsaw, bent on the
quick annihilation of the last 70,000 inhabitants. Instead, they
were routed by the starving, poorly armed residents, who started a
doomed three-week struggle.
   Before the main cerresenting
veterans groups, Jewish communities worldwide and Polish
organizations laid wreath after wreath of flowers at the foot of
the monument, a bold relief of armed fighters crouched together
facing their foes.
   The monument, near the city's heart, was the very first erected
in the destroyed left bank of Warsaw after the war.
   As a crowd of about 4,000 Poles and Israelis stood side by side
under the leaden sky, a cantor sang Kaddish, the Jewish song of
mourning. And Rabbi Isser Frankel of Tel Aviv prayed for the
victims of the ghetto and the Nazi Holocaust in Poland.
   Later, when the Polish officials and military honor guard
withdrew, Israelis in the crowd burst into singing of their
national anthem, Hatikvah (The Hope).
   Poland and Israel do not have full-fledged diplomatic relations.
   Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon, in Poland on a visit
considered private, addressed the crowd and expressed thanks to
Polish authorities for the ceremony.
   He also spoke of the Holocaust in which 6 million Jews were put
to death in World War II, 3 million of them Polish Jews.
   ``We have to remember, yes, but not a paralyzing memory,'' he
said in English. ``Not only remember the past, but we should derive
a new determination from that tragedy to continue living.''
   An assembly at Warsaw's Palace of Culture and Science took place
later in the day, with speeches marking the anniversary.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski was absent from the main
ceremony, but met Tuesday with a delegation of the visiting Jewish
leaders.
   About 3,000 people from Israel and around the world have come to
Poland for the observances beginning April 14, fewer than the 4,500
originally expected.
   Jewish visitors to Poland objected five years ago when
Palestinian diplomats were allowed to lay flowers at the main
ceremony marking the 40th anniversary of the ghetto uprising.
   This year, Polish officials did not invite diplomats to take
part in the ceremony at the monument. But representatives of
several nations held private wreath-layings later in the day.
   The last diplomatic group was led by deputy chief of the PLO
mission in Warsaw, Shawki Al-Omari.
   Julius Spiegel of New York City watched the scene and said
afterward he had no objections to the wreath-laying.
   ``They have a right. I have no sympathy for terrorism, of
course, but I have some sympathy for the Palestinian people. I
think it was quite dignified,'' he said.
   The Polish state-run news agency PAP, meanwhile, distributed a
text of a letter from PLO Ambassador Abdullah Hijazi to Polish
officials likening Nazi fascism in World War II to Israeli
``fascism'' in the occupied West Bank.
   The letter expressed ``deepest respect for the fallen of the
Warsaw ghetto.''

   At Potsdam, where world leaders reshaped Europe at the end of
World War II, events brought East and West together again Tuesday,
to survey a Europe that is reshaping itself.
   At Potsdam, in the summer of 1945, the ``Big Three'' _
Churchill, Stalin and Truman _ reordered the postwar world.
   At Potsdam on Tuesday, the secretary of state, James A. Baker
III, met East Germany's new communist premier, Hans Modrow, with
far less certainty that they could fix, or even anticipate, the new
world order.
   Potsdam is a lakeside suburb of Berlin. It was the seat of power
of the Hohenzollern family, which ruled Prussia before World War I.
It was where word was flashed to Harry Truman that the atom bomb
had been successfully tested in the New Mexico desert.
   Truman told Winston Churchill about the bomb and Churchill
replied, ``This is the Second Coming, in wrath.'' Josef Stalin told
Truman that the Soviet Union would enter the war against Japan.
   At Potsdam, the three men agreed to the division of Germany and
accepted the Russian occupation of East Europe. It was to be a
temporary expedient, but, until the remarkable autumn of 1989, it
became a lasting arrangement.
   The hot war had not ended but the Cold War had started.
   Now _ maybe _ it is ending, at Potsdam, at the Berlin Wall, and
on the streets and in the parliament halls of East Europe. Mikhail
Gorbachev says it is already over but President Bush says he is not
prepared to go that far.
   Baker and Modrow met, just as Bush and Gorbachev met 10 days
earlier off Malta, to size up the direction of a world in flux.
   The secretary and the premier could not hope to take charge of
where it was going. People in the streets of Berlin had brought
down the wall with willpower and hammers and chisels. Berliners
brought down Erich Honecker, the old hardliner, and even Egon
Krenz, Honecker's more conciliatory successor.
   While Baker and Modrow met, Gorbachev was in Moscow staving off
an attempt in the Soviet Parliament to install a multiparty system
in the Soviet Union.
   In Czechoslovakia, the parliament formally accepted the
resignations of that country's ousted hard-line Communists, who sat
by with stony faces. From Sofia came word that the fever had spread
to yet another bloc country; Bulgarian Communist Party leader Petar
Mladenov offered to renounce the party's ``leading role'' and
engage in dialogue with his critics.
   One day's news from the East.
   Truman had not been in office four months and World War II had
not yet ended in the Pacific when he secretly boarded the USS
Augusta for the eight-day trip to Europe and his first meeting with
Stalin, whose arrival at Potsdam was delayed by a slight heart
attack, and with Churchill, who brought along opposition leader
Clement Attlee because it was uncertain who would win the election
at home.
   Britons had gone to the polls but the soldier vote had not been
gathered. Churchill and Attlee broke off the talks to await the
returns at home. When the vote was in, the wartime prime minister
had been ousted by a war-weary nation. Attlee returned to the
conference alone.
   The three leaders conferred over a 16-day period, agreeing on a
``provisional'' division of Germany that has lasted 44 years.
Truman asked for free elections in Hungary, Rumania and Bulgaria.
   Stalin said no deal. According to historians Samuel Eliot
Morison, Henry Steele Commager and William Leuchtenburg, the Soviet
replied, ``Any freely elected government in these countries will be
an anti-Soviet government, and we cannot allow that.''
   The Soviets took over the Baltics and vast stretches of Poland;
they installed communist governments in East Germany and all the
lands they occupied when the fighting ended. Arrangements that were
intended to be temporary hardened.
   On Tuesday, the United States and East Germany conferred again
about the future.
   After seeing Baker, Modrow said, ``We started a dialogue with
each other today.'' But it was clear that the last word in this
dialogue will be spoken by the people.

   If War in Gulf Starts, U.S. and Others
   Are Likely to Raid Pro-Iraq Terror Cells
   ----

   WASHINGTON -- If war starts in the Persian Gulf, police in
countries across the world, including the U.S., plan raids on
suspected pro-Iraqi terrorist cells they have had under
surveillance for months.
   It's understood that the raids are intended to disrupt and
harass suspected terrorist groups that Western officials
believe are prepared to carry out Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein's threat to take any war into countries around the
world.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   American intelligence officials say, however, that no such
raids can round up all terrorists poised to move when war
starts. They expect the onset of war to set off an immediate
wave of terrorist bombings of American, other Western and
moderate Arab targets by members of groups either controlled
by or sympathetic to Iraq.
   Many of the expected incidents are likely to occur in the
Middle East, Europe and North Africa, these officials say.
But threats have been made or detected in such far-flung
places as Brazil, the Philippines and Australia.
   Most ominously, government counterterrorism officials are
bracing for possible bombings inside the U.S., which has for
years managed to repel and deter attacks by Mideast
terrorists.
   Terrorism experts in the Bush administration will discuss
the terrorist side of a potential war only in general terms
and only on condition they aren't identified. They wouldn't
comment on the subject of rounding up suspected terrorists.
   But one official said that "our guess is that the
terrorists have already done the operational planning for
many of the incidents and that they are just waiting now for
the war." Another official said that counterterror forces,
for their part, "are fully cranked up and ready."
   The contemplated police raids would be preventative, and
many of those rounded up would have to be released fairly
quickly for lack of evidence they had committed crimes. But
anti-terrorism agencies around the world hope the actions
will break up at least some early plans for attacks and
frighten terrorist leaders.
   James Schlesinger, a former defense secretary and director
of central intelligence, predicted yesterday that "there will
be a wave of terrorism and sabotage" if war starts. He added
that Western Europe would be a prime target and that "I
suspect that there may be a number of intermittent attacks in
this country."
   Since shortly after Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, the U.S.
government has repeatedly claimed that it has spotted
suspected terrorist operatives scouting out and photographing
possible targets at American installations abroad. The State
Department said so again yesterday. And the administration
has issued several specific terrorist warnings.
   But as the possible start of war gets nearer, concern is
rising.
   Two developments are particularly worrisome, officials
say. There are some signs that Iraqi agents have begun to
make use of the established network of commercial fronts that
Libya established in the 1980s to organize and coordinate
terrorism. And there are signs that non-Arab terrorist groups
are in contact with Iraq, leading to fears they too may join
in the expected terror campaign.
   Among the main Arab groups likely to be involved in the
attacks, officials say, are the Abu Nidal organization, the
Palestine Liberation Front, and a band led by Abu Ibrahim, a
shadowy master bomb maker. All are believed to operate out of
Baghdad.

<P>
The beat of Persian Gulf war drums has suddenly become very loud. Reiterating
that Saddam Hussein is another Hitler, the Administration is now hinting that
the mistreatment of U.S. hostages in Iraq and Kuwait will be used as a pretext
for war.
</P>
<P>
The United States is again sliding inexorably into a war the Congress has not
sanctioned. Since 1945, American Presidents have committed U.S. troops to two
major wars (Korea and Vietnam) and a host of lesser conflicts (most recently
Panama, Grenada and Lebanon) without asking Congress to declare war. Dusting
off the imperial presidency's supposed prerogatives, the Bush Administration
has categorically refused to promise that it will seek congressional
authorization before initiating hostilities against Iraq. Congress should act
now -- before it is too late -- and prohibit the use of U.S. forces in
offensive actions against Iraq unless Congress expressly approves.
</P>
<P>
By making the President commander in chief while reserving to Congress the
power to declare war and ratify treaties, the Framers issued -- in
constitutional scholar Edward S. Corwin's oft-quoted observation -- an
invitation for the two branches to struggle for supremacy in conducting foreign
policy. Nevertheless, until the end of World War II, it was clearly understood
that a President could not commit U.S. forces to a major conflict without the
consent of Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Cold War's exigencies upset the delicate constitutional balance. To meet
the perceived communist threat in a world that was viewed as bipolar both
geopolitically and ideologically, the United States became a national security
state -- permanently mobilized for war in order to contain communism worldwide.
Executive-branch authority increased dramatically while congressional power
eroded (and, to a large degree, was abdicated voluntarily). In a nuclear world,
it was said, the President needed a free hand to respond quickly to global
crises.
</P>
<P>
In the Persian Gulf crisis, however, there are no compelling arguments for
allowing the Administration to start a war without first obtaining
congressional consent. Americans and their elected representatives have the
time to debate Washington's Persian Gulf policy, a debate too important to be
left to street demonstrations staged by aging 1960s radicals. The Persian Gulf
crisis is not a Cold War superpower confrontation with all the possibilities of
sudden escalation to the nuclear level that such a clash could entail. There is
no imminent danger to America's territorial integrity, to its physical and
economic security or even to the global balance of power. Thus, none of the
conditions cited during the Cold War as support for unconstrained presidential
authority to use the military apply in this case. This crisis has dragged on
more than three months, and there is time to reflect before making the fateful
decision for war in the gulf, a conflict that may not end quickly and will
assuredly cost many American lives.
</P>
<P>
A sober assessment of U.S. policy objectives in the gulf is needed. Will
vanquishing Iraq really bring stability to that perennially volatile region?
Will the anti-Iraq coalition hold together if the United States strikes Iraq
first? What impact will an American-initiated war have on moderate Arab
governments -- and on Arab populations? How will Washington's policy affect
U.S.-Israeli relations?
</P>
<P>
Beyond the issues pertinent to the immediate crisis, Bush's whole notion of a
"new world order" needs to be scrutinized. In the post-Cold War era, it is far
from clear that America must remain the world's policeman, or that it can
afford to do so. In this sense, the Persian Gulf crisis provides the
opportunity for a new, full-scale "Great Debate" about America's purposes and
world role.
</P>
<P>
Wars are easy to start but often difficult to end. Thus the hard questions --
the nature of America's security interests, the feasibility of Washington's
objectives and the relationship of military means to policy ends must be asked
before the shooting starts.
</P>
<P>
In its historic 1966 hearings, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee asked the
right questions about U.S. policy in Vietnam. But it was too late to halt the
march of folly in Southeast Asia, because vast numbers of American troops had
already been committed to combat. Congress should not make that mistake again.
Morally and constitutionally, it is time for Congress to assert its
foreign-policy prerogatives -- especially the power to declare war -- in the
Persian Gulf crisis.

<TEXT>
   For the millions of people who were born
after World War II, the solemn ceremonies marking the 50th
anniversary of the German invasion of this nation amounted to a
history lesson.
   For the Poles who lived through the carnage, the memorials
marking the Sept. 1, 1939, outbreak of the war have brought back a
flood of memories.
   ``I survived,'' said Alexandra Sikorska, who served as a courier
for the Polish resistance.
   She said she cried watching televised memorial ceremonies from
Westerplatte, the Baltic peninsula in Gdansk where a German
battleship fired the first salvos of the war at a small Polish
garrison.
   ``Young people were taking a pledge, and I remembered I was young
too then. All my life seems strange because my young days were at
that time,'' she said.
   Mrs. Sikorska, 70, said when the war began she built barricades
against Nazi tanks with paving stones. Then, she carried messages
for the resistance.
   ``I was always thinking that I would be taking part in everything
until the very end,'' she said, her medal of valor dangling from her
collar as she stood in Warsaw's Castle Square during a peace
ceremony marking Friday's anniversary.
   A bronze memorial filling half a city block is being completed to
honor the valiant but doomed stand against the Germans during the
Warsaw Uprising of 1944. Two hundred thousand people in the city
died in the fighting, and the reprisal massacres that followed.
   Nationwide, 6 million Poles died in the war, including 3 million
Jews, and much of Poland was reduced to rubble.
   Proudly wearing combat medals at the ceremony were two men who
started the war as Poles and ended it as citizens of territory
annexed by the Soviet Union.
   ``In September 1939, my friend and I were the first to fight the
Germans. We had active duty that day,'' said Jozef Zamojdzin, still
speaking his native Polish.
   They fought ``not to allow the enemy to tread on Polish soil,''
said his friend, Stefan Sidoromek, ``But we had to face enormous
violence and we were not able to overcome it.''
   They eventually joined the Polish army that the Soviets allowed
to be reformed on their territory after the Germans attacked their
former ally.
   Both men showed honors from the battle of Monte Cassino, one of
the Polish army's many heroic efforts through Africa and Italy.
   ``A soldier is a soldier in order to defend the homeland, and to
be victorious,'' Zamojdzin said.

   Leaders of the once-banned Solidarity
movement flanked President Wojciech Jaruzelski today as he paid
homage to the small Polish garrison in this Baltic port that bore
the first fierce Nazi onslaught of World War II.
   In the remarkable and apparently unplanned display of national
unity, joining Jaruzelski at the 50th anniversary ceremony were
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and newly elected Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a longtime Solidarity activist.
   ``On this day of great national memories we look not only into
the past but also into the future, into the near future and that
which is still far ahead,'' Jaruzelski said.
   ``We should never again be weak, quarreling or isolated,'' he
said. ``Tomorrow Poland must be stronger than today, through its
economic potential and most of all through mutual effort, agreement
and national reconciliation.''
   Jaruzelski and Mazowiecki were to return later to Warsaw, where a
day of world prayer for peace was planned. Also scheduled was an
internationally broadcast concert for peace led by American
conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein at the city's Grand Theater.
   As Jaruzelski spoke at Westerplatte, standing by were 53 veterans
of the legendary Polish garrison on the small peninsula who endured
the guns of the German warship Schleswig-Holstein and staved off a
determined infantry assault for seven days.
   World War II began with the battleship's opening salvo on
Westerplatte, a Polish outpost in then pro-German Free City of
Danzig, at 4:45 a.m. on Sept. 1, 1939.
   At dozens of points along the Polish frontier, the Nazi
``blitzkrieg'' began without warning. A lightning-fast Panzer-led
invasion by 1.5 million German troops obliterated the last organized
Polish army units by Oct. 5.
   Britain and France, after demanding the Germans withdraw, honored
treaty obligations and declared war on Hitler on Sept. 3.
   The stubborn resistance of the 182 Polish soldiers on
Westerplatte, isolated from the rest of Poland, served as an
inspiration for Poles who continued the battle against Hitler until
the march into Berlin nearly six years later.
   Mazowiecki was scheduled to be at the ceremony today, but
Walesa's presence was apparently a spontaneous decision. ``Simple
courtesy requires it,'' he said.
   Walesa, Mazowiecki and Senate Speaker Andrzej Stelmachowski _
another Solidarity activist _ earlier visited the workers monument
erected by the free trade union in 1980 in front of the Lenin
Shipyard where it was born.
   Mazowiecki was in Warsaw on Thursday to continue delicate
negotiations on forming his new government while Solidarity marked
the ninth anniversary of the accords that founded the East bloc's
first legal independent union.
   Today, several hundred supporters sang ``May He Live 100 Years''
to the prime minister as he walked to the monument with Walesa,
their hands raised in the V-for-victory sign.
   Mazowiecki laid red-and-white flowers at the towering columns
dedicated to workers killed during riots along the Baltic coast in
1970.
   Then they bowed to the crowd and Walesa led the singing of the
Polish national anthem.
   As the leaders made their way back to their cars en route to
Westerplatte, the crowd started chanting ``Mazowiecki, Mazowiecki''
and reached out to touch the prime miniser.
   Stelmachowski, taking in the sight of the former political
prisoners now celebrating their victories against Communist control,
said: ``I still have an impression that I am playing a strange part
in a very strange theater.''
   In Warsaw meanwhile, Walter Momper, the governing mayor of
Berlin, visited the monument to the final desperate uprising in the
Jewish ghetto in 1943.
   ``For us as Germans, it is always necessary that we come here and
remember what happened to the ghetto,'' said Momper.
   The Solidarity-dominated Polish Senate adopted a statement on the
war that said the anniversary should be a day of ``new horizons of
reconciliation.''
   ``More than 6 million Polish citizens lost their lives on the
battlefield, as victims of premeditated extermination, or in slave
labor in Nazi concentration camps and Stalin's Gulag,'' the Senate
said.
   Nearly one out of every five Poles living in 1939 died in the
war. The victims included 3 million Polish Jews, 15,000 Polish
officers believed massacred on Stalin's orders at Katyn and
elsewhere in the Soviet Union, 200,000 residents of Warsaw who died
in the capital's doomed 1944 uprising and boy and girl scouts who
organized underground resistance units.

   Thousands of people from around the world
joined Polish officials today in offering flowers and prayers to
the memory of fallen anti-Nazi warriors of the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto
Uprising.
   The 45th anniversary ceremony took place on a broad plaza in
front of the Ghetto Fighters Monument in Warsaw, where the sounds
of gunfire echoed on the morning of April 19, 1943.
   Heavily armed squadrons of German Nazi troops that day entered
the walled Jewish quarter bent on quick, final annihilation of the
last 70,000 inhabitants. Instead, they were routed, and the
starving, poorly armed residents held off Nazi troops for three
more weeks.
   ``We have to remember, yes, but not a paralyzing memory,''
Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon told the crowd of about
4,000 people in English. ``Not only remember the past, but we
should derive a new determination from that tragedy to continue
living.''
   Navon, whose visit to Poland is considered private, expressed
thanks to Polish authorities for the ceremony. The two countries do
not have full-fledged diplomatic relations.
   Six million Jews were put to death in the World War II
Holocaust, 3 million of them Polish.
   Earlier today, about 100 Arab and African students carrying
Palestinian flags briefly marched through the city, also to
commemorate the Ghetto fighters.
   The students drew parallels between the ghetto battles and the
4{-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank
and Gaza Strip. The protesters distributed leaflets to passers-by,
recounting what they said were Israeli cruelties.
   Before the official ceremony, Henryk Jablonski, chairman of the
Polish veteran organization Zbowid which organized the observance,
planted an oak tree on the plaza as a symbol of hope.
   Then, to the beat of military drums, delegations from veterans,
Jewish, and Polish groups laid wreath after wreath of flowers at
the foot of the monument, a relief of armed fighters crouched
together facing their foes.
   The monument, near the city's heart, was the first erected on
the destroyed left bank of Warsaw after the war.
   As Poles and Israelis stood side by side around the square, a
cantor sang Kaddish, the Jewish song of mourning. Rabbi Isser
Frankel of Tel Aviv prayed for the victims of the ghetto and the
Nazi Holocaust in Poland.
   Later, when the Polish officials and military honor guard
withdrew, Israelis in the crowd burst into singing of their
national anthem.
   About 3,000 people from Israel and around the world came to
Poland for the observance week, which began Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Construction is to begin Monday on a
religious center to house Roman Catholic nuns who have outraged
many Jews by refusing to leave a convent at the edge of the
Auschwitz death camp.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and Edgar Bronfman, president
of the World Jewish Congress, are to announce the start of building
after meeting in Warsaw, spokesmen said.
   The groundbreaking will come nearly a year after the Feb. 22,
1989, deadline for moving the nuns under a 1987 accord reached by
Catholic and Jewish religious leaders in Geneva.
   Jewish groups and others view the presence of the small group of
Carmelite nuns as an offensive intrusion of Christianity at the
death camp, built by the Nazis mainly to exterminate Jews because
of their religion.
   Despite the Geneva agreement, the Polish church _ with backing
from other quarters in overwhelmingly Catholic Poland _ balked at
moving the nuns from a former theater used by the Nazis as a
warehouse to store Zyklon B cylinders for the gas chambers.
   After international outcry grew, the Vatican intervened and
announced its support for the construction of the religious center.
It will be a quarter-mile from the death camp on a nine-acre site,
the official news agency PAP said Sunday.
   The presence of the Auschwitz convent represents a ``most, most
serious issue'' to the international Jewish community, which is
prepared to assist in transforming post-Communist Poland's
shattered economy, said Marem Stern, political consultant to the
World Jewish Conference.
   ``It is not that we are anti-Polish ... but it is an issue that
has to be solved, and quickly because with this whole opening of
Poland we have a lot of Jews who are ready to come here and
invest,'' Stern said in a Sunday interview.
   Bronfman will tell Mazowiecki that help is ready, ``but he will
also have to explain that he will not do anything until this is
solved,'' Stern said.
   The convent issue touches on deeply sensitive issues in Poland,
where a pre-World War II Jewish population of 3.5 million has been
reduced to several thousand.
   About 3 million Polish Jews were killed during the war. Most of
those who survived subsequently emigrated, the last wave of
departures taking place after an anti-Semitic political purge in
1968.
   Known officially as the Center for Information, Dialogue,
Education and Prayer at Auschwitz, the new building will include
meeting rooms, exhibition and conference halls, a library and
accommodations for nearly 100 people, PAP said.
   A separate section of the building will house the convent, the
Rev. Marek Glownia said in a statement. The archdiocese of Krakow
appointed Glownia to lead the center and oversee construction.
   The Vatican has pledged financial support for the construction,
and funds also will be raised by foundations and churches elsewhere
in Europe.

   Four thousand teen-agers from 36
countries, carrying the memories of 6 million Jews killed by the
Nazis, made a ``March of the Living'' Sunday from the Auschwitz
concentration camp to the crematoria of Birkenau.
   Writer Elie Wiesel, diplomats and Israeli parliamentarians
joined the young marchers for the two-mile walk marking Holocaust
Memorial Day.
   The march at the camp in southern Poland was in memory of those
who died in Nazi death camps as well as in the Warsaw ghetto
uprising that began April 19, 1943.
   The sunny day turned eerily cloudy and light rain started as
Wiesel stood at a podium before a gray stone monument to recall his
youth at Auschwitz:
   ``I see them, forever I see them. ... Years and years ago I saw,
I cannot tell you what I saw. I'm afraid that if I told you we
would all wake up in tears and would not be able to stop. I see a
young girl ... ,'' he said before stopping, apparently unable to
continue, and silently leaving the podium.
   Many cried as the students, all wearing blue shirts, some
carrying Israeli flags and others bouquets of flowers, walked along
the train tracks that ended at the cremetoria.
   Dandelions waved in the wind-swept grass now covering the rubble
of the camp. Torches were lighted, poems read and mournful violin
songs played before a reading of the kaddish, a Jewish prayer for
the dead.
   Television cameras positioned in former Nazi watchtowers
broadcast live to Israel, where solemn Holocaust remembrance events
were under way.
   As the march began, Galia Haber, a Jerusalem high school
student, recalled seeing the number the Nazis tattoed on her
grandmother's arm at Auschwitz.
   ``I remember when I saw her I thought of a supermarket with
numbered goods and I thought, did somebody buy her? ... It's very
sad to think that my grandmother, whom I love so much ... once was
just a number,'' she told Israeli radio, which broadcast the march
live.
   Shawn Tepper, 17, of Miami Beach, Fla, held hands with a row of
other young American Jews and said the experience was overwhelming
but ``proved to everyone that we are alive, we are together and we
are strong.''
   Sunday's event was the second ``March of the Living.''
Participants said it had special significance because of the drive
toward German unification and Israel's rapid renewal of ties with
Eastern European countries that once had flourishing Jewish
communities.
   The Nazis built the Auschwitz complex in southern Poland as the
main engine of Hitler's ``Final Solution.'' Estimates of the death
count vary, but recent research has put the toll at about 1.5
million, more than 90 percent Jews.
   There were 1,500 participants in the first ``March of the
Living,'' held in 1988 to mark the 45th anniversary of the Warsaw
ghetto uprising. In the battle, several hundred Jewish insurgents
staged a desperate three-week struggle against the Nazi drive to
liquidate the last 75,000 inhabitants of the walled ghetto.
   U.S. and Israeli organizers plan to hold the march every two
years.
   About 3 million Polish Jews perished during World War II. Most
of the approximately 500,000 who survived from the prewar
population subsequently emigrated, many during an anti-Semitic
purge in 1968, and there are now only several thousand Jews in
Poland.

   Rush hour traffic came to a two-minute
standstill today as the wail of air raid sirens opened Israel's
annual memorial day for the 6 million European Jews slain by the
Nazis in World War II.
   The nation's radio stations played melancholy tunes throughout
the day. Restaurants and houses of entertainment were shut by law
for 24 hours ending at sundown today.
   More than 100 memorial ceremonies were scheduled throughout the
country.
   Holocaust Day, officially called Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance
Day, is commemorated on the anniversary of the start of the Warsaw
Ghetto uprising of 1943, when Polish Jews used pistols to fight
Nazis in tanks.
   This year, the commemoration comes amidst a four-month spate of
anti-Israeli violence in the occupied territories that has claimed
the lives of 144 Palestinians and two Israelis.
   The conflict played a prominent role in an emotional speech
given by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir at a memorial ceremony at
Jerusalem's Yad Vashem monument Wednesday night.
   ``We again face the phenomenon of eternal hatred for the eternal
people ... When will the nations learn that they can never overcome
us and decide to leave us alone,'' Shamir said.
   ``Even today when we dwell in our own land, evil-hearted and
unfeeling people shoot poison arrows at our youngsters and they
wander the countryside, turning it into a valley of death,'' he
added.
   His statement was seen as an allusion to the killing of a
teen-aged Jewish settler during a clash in the West Bank village of
Beita last week as well as other attacks against Israelis in the
occupied areas.
   A Foreign Ministry official said Israel would seek
clarifications from Poland today about reports a government
spokesman in Warsaw criticized Israel's tactics in the occupied
territories and linked it to the Holocaust.
   The Polish spokesman, Jerzy Urban, said on Tuesday at a news
conference that Israel's ``brutal behavior'' was an ``offense to
the memory'' of the defenders of the Warsaw Ghetto.
   Despite the controversy, 2,000 Israelis, including teen-agers,
two Cabinet ministers and six legislators, flew to Warsaw this week
for observances of the 45th anniversary of the Warsaw Ghetto
revolt, which took a month to crush.
   Although the generation of Holocaust survivors has dwindled in
numbers, interest in the tragedy has been rekindled in young
Israelis in part because of the war crimes trial of retired Ohio
autoworker John Demjanjuk, which was televised nationwide. Judges
are expected to issue a verdict next week.
   Demjanjuk is accused of operating the gas chambers at the
Treblinka death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland, where 850,000 Jews
perished. He claims he is a victim of mistaken identity.
   The renewed interest in the Holocaust was dramatized by a
well-attended concert Wednesday night staged by two popular rock
singers, Shlomo Artzi and Yehuda Policker, whose parents survived
concentration camps.
   Policker's new album, ``The Stop for Treblinka,'' is about the
trains used to ship Jews to the death camps.
   In an editorial, Al Hamishmar daily wrote: ``This year's
Holocaust Day distances us another year from those days of horror
but does not weaken their memory.''
   ``Survivors' children have absorbed the memory of the terror and
loss. It inhabits the world of every Israeli and has become an
inseparable part of the nation's memory and mission.''

<TEXT>
   Remains of about 100 Jews killed by the
Nazis during World War II were reburied Tuesday in a ceremony
attended by 15 rabbis from around the world.
   The bones were discovered near the site of the old Jewish Ghetto
in Warsaw last summer during a construction project which since has
been abandoned.
   Historians determined that the site was a mass grave used by the
Nazis for Polish Jews who were shot or died of starvation in the
ghetto. Some non-Jewish Poles also were believed to be buried there.
   In the ceremony carried out during a light snowfall, about 100
wooden boxes of remains were carried by several dozen people from a
temporary storage area to a specially build crypt at the site.
   The rabbis removed the bones from the boxes, wrapped them in
white cloths and lowered them into pre-formed concrete cubicles. The
entire site is to become a monument to the victims of genocide.
   The ceremony, attended by Warsaw Mayor Jerzy Boleslawski and
other dignitarites, was organized by the Polish Veterans
Organization and by the Nissenbaum Foundation, which restores and
preserves Jewish monuments in Poland.
   ``We want to express our appreciation to the Polish government
for its courageous stand in preserving this entire area,'' said
Rabbi Hertz Frankel of New York, speaking at the ceremony.
   ``We participate in sorrow and mourning of our elder brothers,
who gave us the commandment, 'Thou shalt not kill,''' said Bishop
Henryk Muszczynski of Warsaw, who also took part in the prayers of
mourning led by the rabbis.
   Before World War II, Poland was home to 3.5 million Jews. About 3
million were slaughtered by the Nazis. Most of the rest left Poland
after the war, and today the Jewish population is estimated at about
10,000.

<LEADPARA>  FIFTY years ago the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. In a few hours on a Sunday
morning they woke Americans from their isolationist slumber and launched a
costly war Japan couldn't win.;   When the fighting ended four years later,
much of Japan had been incinerated, a deadly nuclear cloud hung over two
cities, hundreds of thousands of civilians were dead, the economy was in
ruins, the emperor was reduced from head of state to figurehead, and the
country was occupied by American soldiers.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  AN APOLOGY? WHY?
JAPAN'S SURRENDER IN 1945 IS MORE MEANINGFUL THAN
ANY MEA CULPA OF TODAY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Are Japanese people sorry their nation attacked Pearl Harbor? Many are. Do
they owe us an apology? No.;   The 50th anniversary has stirred up
understandable feelings in Americans who lived through the attack or lost
loved ones in it. In two hours, 2,403 Americans died, and millions of lives
were changed. But Japan lost the war. Surrenders are worth more than
apologies.;   Besides being meaningless, war-related mea culpas have a
never-ending quality. A full accounting, for example, would have to deal not
only with Japanese guilt, but also with American excesses: Most of the
Japanese killed in the firebombing of Japan's major cities and the nuclear
flattening of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were civilians.;   Was that much loss of
innocent life necessary to win the war? Military historians have been debating
that for five decades. President Bush rejects suggestions that Washington
should apologize for President Harry Truman's decision to drop atomic bombs.
But by the same logic that leads some to demand an apology from Japan for
Pearl Harbor, four years from now -- on the 50th anniversary of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki -- others doubtless will argue that this nation owes Japan an apology
for those dreadful disasters.;   World War II ended in August 1945. Japan's
surrender was unequivocal. There would be no point to an apology from the
Japanese people in 1991. They didn't start the war. The only meaningful
apology would have to come from the leaders who gave the orders to attack.
Most are long gone.;   To the extent that 1991's renewed attention on Pearl
Harbor makes people everywhere sorrowful for the suffering caused by wars, we
say that's a positive thing.;   To the extent that some Japanese lawmakers
succeed in adopting contrite resolutions, that's fine too, if it makes them
feel better. But it has little practical value for today's U.S.-Japanese
relations.;   If focusing on Pearl Harbor makes it more difficult for some
Japanese fascists to deny their nation's responsibility for the war, and for
some educators to soft-pedal it, good.;   But the truth of the matter is,
examining our military past does not necessarily provide practical clues for
dealing with our economic present. The Japan of today makes Sonys and Toyotas,
not Zero fighter-bombers. And it is both our chief economic rival and, in
Asia, our main ally.  </TEXT>

<P>
West German officials Friday marked the 50th anniversary of the start of World
War II by acknowledging that Germans bear full responsibility for the cataclysm
that cost more than 50 million lives.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, an East German official praised the Soviet Union for
resisting Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler during the war and warned the Bonn
government not to attempt to reunite the nation, which was partitioned in the
war's aftermath.
</P>
<P>
West German leaders paid particular tribute to Poland, Nazi Germany's first
victim of the war, but appeared to differ over how to reconcile the two
countries. Germany's invasion of Poland on Sept. 1, 1939, began World War II.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a special nationally televised session of the Parliament, West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared that "Hitler wanted, planned and
unleashed the war, (which) reached a dimension of horror that had never been
seen before and must never be seen again."
</P>
<P>
Seated in the audience were the Polish ambassador to West Germany and a group
of Polish young people.
</P>
<P>
Kohl called for reconciliation between West Germans and Poles. He said:
"Terrible things were done to the Polish people in the name of Germany and by
German hands. The wounds the Second World War opened have not healed even
today."
</P>
<P>
But differences in how to go about healing those wounds surfaced in Friday's
speech-making by other West German leaders.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Boundary Disagreement
</P>
<P>
The opposition Social Democrats called on the government to reassure the Poles
that West Germany has no claims on prewar territory that was given to Poland
after the war.
</P>
<P>
Right-wing members of Kohl's governing coalition, among them Finance Minister
Theo Waigel, have insisted that until a permanent peace treaty is signed,
Germany's legal boundaries are those of 1937. This area includes much of what
is now western Poland.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Kohl skirted the issue by supporting the 1970 Warsaw Treaty that
recognizes the postwar boundaries. But he did not specifically reject all
claims to prewar German territory.
</P>
<P>
Former Chancellor Willy Brandt criticized the government on the Polish issue by
accusing right-wing officials of interfering with anniversary trips that Kohl
and President Richard von Weizsaecker had planned to take this summer.
</P>
<P>
The trips were not made, partly because Bonn and Warsaw could not agree on the
amount and specifics of an economic support package for Poland.
</P>
<P>
Brandt, a former leader of the Social Democratic Party, who spent the war in
exile in Sweden, said: "Unfortunately, the fatal impression arose this summer
that the road to Warsaw was shorter from London, Paris and even Washington than
from Bonn." This was a reference to Polish visits by British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, French President Francois Mitterrand and President Bush.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Kohl took note of the debt to Jews who perished in the
Holocaust. He said West Germany's improved relations with Israel and with Jews
around the world indicate that "bridges can be built over an abyss."
</P>
<P>
"Most countries of Europe suffered heavily at Germany's hand," Kohl said. "Many
of them are now our partners, even our friends."
</P>
<P>
In a remark apparently addressed to the political far right, Kohl, who was 9
years old when the war began, paid tribute to Germans who fought in the war.
</P>
<P>
"Most of them," he said, "were honestly convinced that they were serving their
country loyally. There were countless examples of bravery and humanity that
deserve respect."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Refugee Crisis
</P>
<P>
He did not mention the current crisis over East Germans trying to emigrate to
the West. But in East Berlin, Foreign Minister Oskar Fischer told the East
German Parliament that the Bonn government "must take leave of its baseless
presumption of the right to represent all Germans and to exercise guardianship
over them.
</P>
<P>
"It must give up all claims on foreign territory," he said, "and end
irresponsible talk about re-establishing the German empire within the 1937
borders."
</P>
<P>
Fischer said World War II could have been avoided if the Western nations had
overcome their fear of communism and allied themselves earlier with the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
East German leader Erich Honecker, 77, who is said to be recuperating from
gallstone surgery, did not attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Polish-born Pope John Paul II addressed his countrymen via
television from the Vatican. Poles who gathered in Warsaw's Victory Square saw
the pontiff's image on a large screen as he deplored the "long and painful
period of suffering of humanity" during World War II and urged all peoples to
"eliminate war from all parts of the world," wire reports said.
</P>
<P>
Jewish leaders boycotted the Warsaw ceremony to protest the presence of a Roman
Catholic convent at the site of the Auschwitz concentration camp, where
millions of Jews and others were killed by the Nazis.

   With Saddam Hussein's intransigence closing the last
avenues to a peaceful solution of the Kuwait crisis, it's
time to review why the impending war is necessary. In brief,
because we have a monster loose in a crucial corner of the
globe we share.
   The future is at stake. If Saddam's aggression fails,
potential pirates around the world will be forced to think
twice before invading their neighbors and disrupting the
world's commerce and diplomacy. But if he succeeds his
ambitions will grow, and barring some miracle we will face a
future choice between succumbing to his intimidation and
fighting a larger and bloodier war.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   We all know that battle means American deaths, not to
mention vast expenditures. But in truth, war started August 2
when Saddam ordered his troops to pillage Kuwait; our
resulting blockade is already an act of war. The issue in
today's United Nations deadline is not whether to start a
war, but whether an offensive is necessary to conclude one.
   The attack on Kuwait was unprovoked, a gross violation of
international law and common-sense morality. The gratuitous
cruelty was shocking even by the standards of this jaded
century, though not surprising from a man who in his own
country had already used poison gas on an ethnic minority. As
we learn more of Saddam, it confirms the picture of a
megalomaniac proud of his own amorality.
   The world has known other monsters, of course, and the
United States need not go to war to punish them all. But
Saddam sits astride the Persian Gulf and its immense oil
reserves. The United States cannot allow this region to fall
under the domination of a hostile power. It was a Democratic
President, after all, who proclaimed "The Carter Doctrine,"
that the Gulf was within "the vital interests of the United
States."
   It could scarcely be more obvious that Saddam's ambitions
extend far beyond Kuwait. He had previously started a war
with Iran, declaring a treaty "null and void." Despite the
punishment of that protracted war, he emerged with a larger
army. He has devoted his oil revenues, what he could borrow
and the labor of his people into constructing a military
machine. As neighbors like the Saudis, Egyptians and Turks
quickly recognized, an Iraqi success in Kuwait would be
followed by further aggression elsewhere.
   The analogy with Hitler is of course not complete, since
Iraq is not one of the most advanced nations of our times.
But it has already launched a space satellite, and is working
feverishly on development of nuclear weapons. If Saddam ever
conquered or dominated the whole Gulf, he would be able to
use oil not only for revenues but for blackmail -- rewarding
nations that cooperated with his nuclear program and
punishing others. Saddam has also tried to use anti-Western
resentments to mobilize the Arab masses, an effort that would
be much enhanced by success in Kuwait. A nuclear-armed Saddam
at the head of the Arab world would be a threat of global
proportions.
   It's true that we could try to avoid war by adopting a
purely defensive posture in Saudi Arabia. This obviously
would give Saddam time to develop his nuclear potential, and
to try resuming his expansion by subverting the Saudi regime.
It also would risk a change in the attitude of the Soviet
Union, a possibility that events in Lithuania make all too
clear. President Bush decided that the less risky course was
to establish a deadline, and to take the offense if
necessary. In this judgment he has by now been supported by
the United Nations, the majority of the Congress and,
according to the polls, a substantial majority of the
American people.
   It's also true that battle is always risky. Equipment can
fail, foes can mount surprises and generals can make
mistakes. We surely hope that an attack would be well
planned: Exploiting our air power to cut off Iraqi troops,
but without indiscriminate bombing threatening to civilians.
Contemplating an eventual ground assault if necessary, but
avoiding a frontal attack on fortifications just to give the
Army and Marines a part of the action. Facilitating the
surrender or defection of Iraqi troops likely to be less
deluded than their leader, and quite vulnerable in the desert
if our planes can interdict their water supplies. With good
planning and decent fortune, we can hope that this will not
be a lengthy or costly engagement.
   It's true, finally, that Saddam is not about to invade the
United States. Neither was Hitler. Though Pearl Harbor ended
our internal political divisions, the retrospective lesson
was that we could not escape involvement. The world is too
small, and the United States too large. This is even more
true today. While "new world order" may sound a bit
grandiloquent, the invasion of Kuwait was the first
largescale piracy of a post-Cold War era; its disposition
will prove an important precedent on whether that era is one
of greater order or greater chaos.
   The reason for spending blood and treasure in battle is to
avoid even worse choices and even greater sacrifices in the
future. As today's deadline passes, we face an Iraqi leader
with demonstrated ambition and ruthlessness, threatening
undeniably strategic territory at a moment of historical
crux. If this is not the time to stand and fight, when?

<HEAD>Officials Warn Against Unofficial Observances Of Anniversary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Polish authorities on Friday warned
organizers of an unsanctioned ceremony to mark the 45th anniversary
of the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto Uprising that the gathering would be
considered illegal, an organizer said.
   The warning came on the second day of a weeklong official
anniversary to honor the victims of the Nazi Holocaust during World
War II. It is the largest such event ever organized in Poland.
   On Friday, meanwhile, a Polish scholar told a scientific
conference that she is ashamed of anti-Semitic behavior in Poland
in 1968 and asked why more Polish officials, including some
conference organizers, have not come forward to accept
responsibility.
   About 4,500 people from around the world, including 2,000 from
Israel including Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon, have
come to Poland for the Ghetto Uprising Anniversary, honoring the
fighters who resisted the final Nazi onslaught against the ghetto
for three weeks in April and May of 1943.
   In addition to the official observances, a group of 46
intellectuals and opposition activists has called for an unofficial
ceremony Sunday in front of the Warsaw Ghetto Fighters' Monument
and in the old Jewish Cemetery.
   The group is led by Marek Edelman, a longtime opposition
activist who is the last surviving commander of the uprising
remaining in Poland. Edelman says he is boycotting the official
observances because he considers them a cynical attempt by the
government to win favor in the West.
   Jacek Kuron, an organizer of the unsanctioned ceremony and an
adviser to the outlawed trade union Solidarity, said he was taken
to a Warsaw prosecutor's office for the warning talk by
plainclothed police.
   ``I was told that the event which I am co-organizing on Sunday .
.. is illegal ... so the authorities cannot assure protection and
the (organizing) committee will be morally and legally responsible
for any possible provocations which might take place,'' Kuron said.
   Kuron said the committee intends to proceed with the observances
anyway, including a wreath-laying ceremony at the Ghetto Fighters'
Monument and the dedication of a memorial in the Jewish Cemetery to
two Polish-Jewish socialists executed by the Soviet Union during
World War II.
   The alternative observances have come under heavy attack in the
official media, which has charged the organizers with being
anti-Soviet ``hyenas'' trying to take advantage of the anniversary
to call attention to themselves.
   Meanwhile, on the second day of a two-day historical and
scientific conference on the struggle of Jews and Poles under the
Nazi occupation, Irena Maciejewska drew applause at the conference
when she referred to the politically inspired anti-Semitic purge
that took place in Poland in 1968.
   Mrs. Maciejewska, who was delivering a paper on the Warsaw
Ghetto Uprising in literature, said that when she cooperates with
one official institution co-sponsoring the conference, the Jewish
Historical Institute, she finds herself ``in the company of people
who injured the good name of Poland in 1968.''
   To applause from the audience of several hundred people, she
added: ``As a university person I painfully remember that time and
as a Pole I should be ashamed of it.''
   The Polish United Workers (Communist) Party, in a newspaper
article last month, said anti-Semitism played a role in 1968 in
political purges that caused thousands of Jews to lose jobs in
government, journalism, the army and academia.
   Opposition activists criticized the statement as being too mild
and for not identifying individuals involved, some of whom they
charged still hold prominent positions in Poland.

<HEAD>Monument to Death Camp Victims Dedicated in Poland</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The city today dedicated a gleaming
monument to 300,000 Jews deported to Nazi deaths camps as its mayor
declared ``the struggle and courage of the Warsaw Ghetto will not
be forgotten.''
   `It is here where the kingdom of night reigned at its
cruelest,'' Miles Lehrman, chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Council, told the crowd of 3,000 gathered in Warsaw at the site of
the World War II deportations.
   The dedication came in observances of the 45th anniversary of
the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, when fighters from Jewish district's
last 70,000 people put up a desperate three-week resistance to the
final Nazi onslaught.
   The government has shown a mixed reaction to anniversary
observances. It initially branded as illegal a commemorative rally
including speakers from the outlawed trade federation Solidarity.
However, it did not intervene when the rally took place Sunday.
   In addition, authorities plan a huge observance of the
anniversary of the uprising, which began April 19, 1943. It will be
held Tuesday at the city's Ghetto Fighters Monument.
   Today, a military honor guard joined the crowd at Umschlagplatz
square for the morning dedication ceremony in sunny, breezy
weather. The crowd included Poles, Israelis, and other Jews from
around the world _ some children of concentration camp victims.
   The Umschlagplatz memorial was unveiled by Henryk Jablonski,
head of the Polish veterans association, which has organized the
official anniversary observances.
   Umschlagplatz, on the edge of the walled Jewish ghetto
established in Warsaw by the Nazis in 1940, was the square where
Jews were loaded into boxcars for the fatal trip to the Nazi camps
at Treblinka and Majdanek.
   ``Let subsequent generations remember about the tragedy of 45
years ago. The Jews of Warsaw, peace to their memory,'' Warsaw
Mayor Jerzy Boleslawski told the crowd.
   Israeli flags fluttered as a long line of people carrying flower
wreaths moved toward the monument, a marble rectangle inscribed
with the names of some of the victims of the 1942-43 deportations.
   Polish officials said today that a service station a few yards
from the monument would stay closed. It had offended the monument's
designer, Hanna Szmalenberg, and some of the foreign visitors.
   Three million Polish Jews and 3 million non-Jewish Poles were
killed from 1939-45, mostly in deliberate executions and death
camps.
   At the end of the war, only a few hundred thousand of Poland's
pre-war Jewish population of 3.5 million remained. Today, the
country's Jewish population is less then 10,000, mostly elderly
people.

the Mercury News editorial pages staff.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "It is well that war is so terrible -- we would grow too fond of it," said
Gen. Robert E. Lee.;    We've just won a war that wasn't so terrible at all,
for our side, and it makes me happy and amazed and relieved and proud -- and
worried that this seemingly easy triumph will make us war-happy. Especially
those of us who didn't have to cross mine fields, or fly into anti-aircraft
fire, or wait for somebody to call and say "It wasn't me that got killed,
Mom," should not get too fond of war.;    The war was terrible for the Iraqis,
of course, but it was impossible to minimize our casualties and theirs
(except, of course, by not fighting at all, and ask the Kuwaitis how well that
works).;    The war was terrible for the families who lost loved ones, but of
the half million Americans who went to the Persian Gulf, only 100 or so
(depending on the fate of those missing in action) will come home in the body
bags that protesters promoted as the chief reason for opposing the war.;
"Nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at without result," Winston
Churchill wrote in 1898.;    Most of us weren't shot at, of course, but we
were prepared to see our nation's forces suffer terrible losses, and it didn't
happen. We killed them; they didn't get to kill us. It is exhilarating. And
dangerous, because it is exhilarating.;    The Vietnam War led to
post-traumatic stress syndrome; the gulf war surely will lead to post-triumph
euphoria syndrome. We are incredibly powerful. On the battlefield.;    I came
of age during the Vietnam War, and learned its sad lessons. Some of that old
wisdom held up pretty well.;    Vietnam taught political leaders not to play
general.;    Bush let Schwarzkopf be Schwarzkopf.;    Vietnam taught the armed
forces to avoid fighting without political support at home, not to escalate
gradually and to distrust the press.;    This time, everybody supported the
troops but that old eyeball-plucker Saddam. President Bush knew exactly what
he wanted -- the destruction of the Iraqi military and the utter humiliation
of Saddam Hussein -- and went for it.;    The press, which was vilified for
reporting from Baghdad and criticizing in Riyadh, ended up with Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf's thanks for, essentially, bad reporting that exaggerated U.S.
troop strength in the early days and for eagerly playing up the amphibious
landing that never was.;    (Once the reporting switched from Baghdad and
Riyadh to the front, the press reported totally from the point of view of the
allied forces -- "we" are advancing rapidly, "we" have seen light resistance,
etc. -- and ended up taking Iraqi prisoners and accepting the thanks of
Kuwaiti citizens, who thought they'd been liberated by CNN.);    Other lessons
of Vietnam proved false in the Persian Gulf.;    First Vietnam Lesson: The
United States can't win a Third World war; intervention abroad inevitably will
turn into a long, drawn-out, bloody disaster.;    Second Lesson: Our enemies
are fiercely dedicated and will never give up the struggle against us, no
matter how much suffering they must endure.;    Third Lesson: Our military
leaders are incompetent boobs, throwing away our soldiers' lives.;    Fourth
Lesson: A war can't be won from the air.;    Fifth Lesson: War is hell.;
The Persian Gulf War has rewritten the lesson book.;    First Kuwait Lesson:
We can do anything we want against a Third World army, even one that's very
large and well-equipped, and do it quickly and with few casualties.;    Second
Lesson: Our enemies speak loudly and surrender quickly.;    Third Lesson: Our
military leaders and our fighting forces are very competent; our weapons
work.;    Fourth Lesson: We can win most of a war from the air, destroying the
enemy's ability and will to fight, and then sending in ground forces to mop
up.;    Fifth Lesson: War is fun.;    Of course, coalition forces won a swift
and stunning victory because the Iraqis chose to fight a conventional battle
that allied forces were very well prepared to fight. Saddam was stupid.;
Other new world order wars might not be fought on our terms. Quick victory in
Kuwait doesn't imply, for instance, that the U.S. military could win "the drug
war" in Peru, or finish off the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, or tidy up Africa's
civil wars.;    It doesn't even mean we can stabilize the Middle East. Blowing
up tanks is easy; stability is hard.;    Still, it's hard to be humble. We
fought the biggest tank battle since World War II and didn't lose a tank or a
soldier. That's amazing. That's bizarre. That's not the way war is supposed to
be.;    And almost all the killing in this war -- by both sides -- was done at
a distance, without a glimpse of the faces of the killed. That makes it seem
less terrible.;    They warned us when the air war started not to be euphoric.
They warned us when the ground war started not to be euphoric. Now it's over,
and President Bush says it's no time to be euphoric.;    I think it is time to
be euphoric.;    OK. Time's over. Now what?  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Atomic Veterans Dedicate Peace Memorial But Japanese Speech
Scratched</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Veterans from the unit that dropped the
atom bombs met Saturday to dedicate a peace memorial, but the
gathering's tone was marred when a Japanese journalist was
scratched off the speaker list for saying the bombings weren't
necessary.
   A planned rendition of the Japanese national anthem also was
removed from Saturday's program.
   The memorial was dedicated to the 2,000 members of the 509th
Composite Group, and the nearly 200,000 people who died in the
atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   The dedication was held in conjunction with the 509th's 45th
reunion and about 400 people gathered at the monument adjacent to
the Wendover Visitor's Center.
   Veterans said they believe peace was bought with the lives
claimed by the bombings. A chaplain gave thanks for the bomb.
   ``We thank thee God for the atom bomb, through which peace came
to our world,'' said the Rev. William B. Downey in dedicating the
16-foot granite obelisk topped with a brass model of the ``Enola
Gay,'' the B-29 that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.
   ``Lord keep that peace,'' Downey said.
   The 509th trained at the now-abandoned Wendover Air Base in
nearby Utah in 1944-45, a few hundred yards from where the memorial
was dedicated.
   Group organizers had invited Hideaki Kase, a conservative
Japanese author and advisor to two prime ministers, to speak of the
significance of the event.
   Kase is a controversial figure in Japan because he has advocated
bolstering the military and rewriting the Japanese constitution _
drawn up under U.S. auspices after World War II _ to allow Japan to
send its troops overseas.
   Friday night, Kase said Japan was ready to capitulate before the
bombs were dropped, making the destruction of the two cities
unnecessary. During Kase's presentation, dozens of veterans and
their wives walked out and sang ``God Bless America'' in the
hallway.
   Christopher Turoff, 69, a bombardier in the group, was one who
stayed.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' he said later. ``He seemed to blame
the whole war on us.''
   Kase, who traveled to Wendover from Tokyo, said he was unclear
what portion of his speech offended his guests.
   ``What I talked about was that Japan was ready to give up the
war in early August,'' Kase said. ``That in retrospect the two
atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not necessary.''
   James Corliss, 69, who was flight engineer on one of the chase
planes on the Aug. 6, 1945, Hiroshima raid, said he was
``disgusted'' with Kase's rendition of history.
   ``He said we shouldn't have bombed at all,'' Corliss said. ``He
said we started the war.''
   Fearing a walkout at the dedication ceremony if Kase were
allowed to talk, reunion organizer George Marquardt told the
conductor of the Army band not to play the Japanese national anthem
and passed over Kase on the program.
   ``I feel awful about it,'' said Marquardt, a 70-year-old retired
major who now lives in Murray, Utah. ``But this is the 509th's
reunion. I couldn't have them walking out.''
   ``There would have been a riot,'' said Corliss.
   Kase said he was not offended by the last-minute decision to cut
him out of the program.
   ``I am a guest here,'' he said, ``You will have to ask them what
I said that was offensive.
   In an interview from Tokyo in the weeks before the event, Kase
said the bombings had been necessary because their demonstration of
power had prevented a major war since.
   Retired Gen. Paul W. Tibbets Jr., commander of the 509th and
pilot of the ``Enola Gay,'' which dropped the bomb on Hiroshima,
unveiled the memorial along with Marquardt and retired Gen. Charles
Sweeney, who piloted the bomber on the Nagasaki raid.
   Under Tibbetts' command, the 509th practiced high-altitude
precision bombing, flying long trips to California's Salton Sea
bombing range and the Caribbean Sea to simulate long, over-water
navigation.
   Only Tibbetts knew the group's true mission, and he demanded
unquestioning loyalty from those who didn't. All he told them was
that their efforts might save thousands of American lives and bring
the war to an early end.

VON SYDOW'S SCENES OF DESTRUCTION
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY MILLS
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"This movie is not entertainment," Max Von Sydow says, casting his eye over the
bloody costumes of dozens of Japanese people lying in a church courtyard. "It's
much more of a political statement."
</P>
<P>
Von Sydow, who received a best actor Oscar nomination last year for "Pelle the
Conqueror," is talking about NBC's "Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes," about the
aftermath of the Hiroshima bombing. It airs at 9 p.m. on Sunday, the 45th
anniversary of the day the United States dropped the first atomic bomb, on
Japan.
</P>
<P>
"The pacifist in me made me interested in this project," he says, explaining
his decision to portray a German Catholic priest working in Hiroshima on Aug.
6, 1945.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good that we're sometimes reminded of important events in
history. When Pope John Paul II visited Hiroshima recently, he says, 'We have
to look to the past to learn for the future."'
</P>
<P>
Von Sydow, who first came to worldwide notice 35 years ago through the films of
fellow Swede Ingmar Bergman, explains he's not just talking about bombs.
</P>
<P>
"Hiroshima has become a metaphor not just for nuclear war but for war and
destruction and violence toward civilians," he says. "It's not just the idea we
should not use nuclear arms. We should not start another war because it's
madness."
</P>
<P>
The scene today in Valencia, which is standing in for Hiroshima, occurs the day
after the bomb fell. With two wind machines at work blowing smoke and dust in
the actors' faces, the scene is eerily reminiscent of photographs taken of the
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Wearing a black cassock, Von Sydow busily attends the wounded.
</P>
<P>
The bomb on Hiroshima, which flattened 90% of the city, resulted in nearly
130,000 casualties. A second bomb dropped on Nagasaki three days later prompted
the Japanese to accept unconditional surrender, bringing an end to World War
II.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other movies that have examined America's decision to bomb Japan, the
focus of "Hiroshima: Out of the Ashes" follows the survivors. In the ensemble
film, Von Sydow shares billing with Judd Nelson (an American POW interned in a
Hiroshima jail), Pat Morita (a Hiroshima postman), Tamlyn Tomito (a
Japanese-American whose husband is in the Japanese Army) and Kim Miyori (a
mother of a missing child).
</P>
<P>
Von Sydow is reluctant to address the moral issues surrounding Hiroshima. "We
don't know what would have happened if America hadn't dropped the bombs," he
said. "It's easy to say that no bombs should have been dropped. But this was a
war situation, and dropping them was an attempt to end the war."
</P>
<P>
Although Von Sydow, 61, was too young to have fought in World War II, he did
see its effects first-hand. In 1945 he was a high school student in Sweden, a
country that remained neutral during the war. "That spring," he recalls, "the
concentration camps were opened, and members of the Red Cross went in and
brought a large number of prisoners to southern Sweden.
</P>
<P>
"I belonged to a folk dance group that visited these poor, miserable people and
performed for them. We were asked to learn a number of national anthems, and we
sang them. It was an extremely emotional experience. Many of these people were
in terrible shape. They looked like walking skeletons, but they were beaming
with joy as we entertained them."
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by such a reception, Von Sydow ignored his parents' plan for him to
enter college and instead pursued an acting career. "I was in such a hurry to
be an actor," he remembers. "Now I'm sometimes mad at myself that I didn't stop
and study for a couple of years."
</P>
<P>
Instead, he attended Stockholm's Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, began a stage
career and then had the good fortune to meet Bergman. His work in the
director's "The Seventh Seal," "The Magician" and "The Virgin Spring" brought
him to the attention of Hollywood. In 1965, Von Sydow came to America to play
Christ in "The Greatest Story Ever Told," and he has come back periodically
ever since.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the title role in "The Exorcist" and a small part in "Hannah and Her
Sisters," as Barbara Hershey's intellectual lover, most of Von Sydow's work in
Hollywood films has been villainous. "It's because I'm foreign," he explains in
his ever-so-lightly accented English, Rand foreigners are very often villains."
Since the success of "Pelle the Conqueror," an Oscar-winner in 1989 for best
foreign film, Von Sydow thinks he has a new image in the United States. "Now
I'm getting less villain offers and more normal people offers," he says.
</P>
<P>
Even as his Hollywood career prospers, Von Sydow, who has lived in Rome and
Paris for more than a decade, intends to move back to Sweden to pursue stage
work. "If they want me, I'll do one limited theater engagement there every year
and films the rest of the time," he says. "It's a daydream, but I hope it will
work."

NOW THAT WE'RE AT WAR, TURN UP THE HEAT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Commentary
Robert MacAfee Brown is a Presbyterian minister and theologian from Palo Alto.
This article is adapted from an open letter he wrote this week to people
working for peace.
See also related article on page 1E of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     (check) Step up the pressure.;    Until Jan. 16, our agenda was to keep the
war from starting. We were dealing with hypothetical deaths. Now we are
dealing with real deaths. Now it has been unleashed and we abhor what we see.
There are more reasons than ever to try to restore peace.;     A common goal;
Different people will use different means to reach that goal. There need to be
more rallies, more marches, more expressions of outrage, more letters to
Congress, more demonstrations in front of the White House and elsewhere. Some
of our actions will result from frustration, some from cool, rational
analysis. But all of our actions must make clear to our policy-makers that we
are not a docile or willing people.;    In the course of protest, we will be
asked, "Don't you care about the American soldiers in the Middle East?" Our
answer must be, "We care. We care too much about them -- and all other
soldiers -- to consign them to destructive desert warfare. We want them back
home, creating families rather than corpses.";    (check) Keep everything we
do non-violent.;    It will distort our message beyond recognition if we
appear to be saying that violence in the Mideast is all wrong, but violence at
home is all right. If our message is peace, our tactics must be peaceful. If
the true enemy is violence, we must be non-violent. Non-violence can include
civil disobedience, as Martin Luther King Jr. proved.;     Hatred is
destructive;  (check) Distinguish between anger and hatred.;    In this new
situation, anger is a virtue. Anger can be creative. It can motivate people to
change. It can cleanse. It can empower. Hatred can only be destructive. To
hate another is to deny that person full humanity. When we hate, we deny our
own humanity as well.;    To be angry at George Bush and his policies is
surely part of being for peace. But to hate George Bush is inappropriate. We
can be angry at what the system is forcing young men and women to do in the
Middle East, but we cannot hate them. They are trapped in a process they did
not create, and from which it will be almost impossible for them to
disengage.;    (check) Remain alert to how easily human rights and civil
rights are violated in wartime.;    It is a matter of national shame that the
Federal Bureau of Investigation has been interrogating Arab-Americans on the
assumption that they may be untrustworthy citizens. It recalls the ugly
treatment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.;    We must continue to
protest the curtain of military censorship that has already fallen on our
basic right to know what is really going on. It will little avail us to have
"victory" over a "tyrant" if the price of victory is adopting the tactics of
tyranny.;    (check) Scrutinize what the war is doing to our lives.;    We
want a world that is more caring: Let us care for one another now. We want a
world in which love is stronger than hate: Let us extend the circle of those
we love until no one in the human family is excluded.;     Turning to prayer;
Many people concerned for peace are now going to churches, mosques and
synagogues to pray -- for the first time in years. Is that just a cop-out, or
is it a fresh recognition that we need a relationship to something more
ultimate than ourselves?;    The peace movement is committed to the ultimacy
of love. That is basically what prayer is: not words, but a fusion of words
and deeds. To pray for peace is hollow if we do not work for peace. Working
for peace frequently requires the infusion of a new empowerment that words of
prayer can sometimes channel. Perhaps we can rediscover in prayer deep
resources of energy and love we had not known were there. Then we can continue
to work for peace with determination and with hope.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Principal Stalks Out On Japanese Delegation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A meeting between Japanese anti-nuclear
activists and officials of a high school whose symbol is a nuclear
mushroom broke up when the principal angrily declared that the
United States wasn't to blame for World War II, then left.
   Tuesday's meeting was called to discuss Japanese objections to
the Richland High School symbol, which celebrates the area's role
in the production of U.S. nuclear arms _ including plutonium in the
bomb that destroyed Nagasaki in World War II.
   ``We are not going to change our symbol because we believe it
has something to do with the heritage of our community,'' Principal
John Nash told a delegation of 35 Japanese who visited this town
adjacent to the giant Hanford nuclear reservation.
   ``I heard some things here that made me angry,'' Nash said. ``We
can go back to history and recall a lot of things about the war and
I could say some things here that would be very disruptive to you
people, but I'm not about to do this,'' Nash said.
   ``But I'm going to say one thing and you should remember this.
We did not start that war and I think that should end it.''
   Nash then walked out of the classroom, to the loud applause of
some residents in the south-central Washington city, leaving the
visitors to talk with faculty, students and reporters.
   ``It was not our intention to protest,'' said Masa Takubo, of
Washington, D.C., who served as interpreter. ``We wanted to present
our views and we wanted to understand his views.
   ``Unfortunately he had to leave in anger,'' Takubo said.
   ``I was embarrassed at my ex-principal,'' said Marcia Cilian, a
Richland High graduate. ``He interpreted it the wrong way. They
were not asking us to change it, just look at it another way.''
   Hours later, about 100 people who largely supported the Japanese
visitors attended an evening with them at the Richland Public
Library.
   However, Mary Baird, of Richland, defended the dropping of
atomic bombs on Japan at the end of the war, saying they prevented
even greater slaughter of Americans and Japanese.
   ``It's unfortunate that a nuclear war occurred, but I will not
accept the blame for my country,'' she said, noting that the
Japanese launched hostilities in the Pacific.
   The Japanese visitors have been in this country since May, when
they attended a United Nations special session on disarmament in
New York. Since then, they have been touring U.S. nuclear
facilities.
   Hanford was created by the Manhattan Project in World War II to
make plutonium for nuclear weapons. The jobs of up to 30,000
Richland residents are tied to the nuclear weapons industry, and
criticism of their role in that work is a sore point with many
locals.
   Earlier this year, an attempt by some teachers and residents to
eliminate the mushroom cloud symbol of the Richland High School
Bombers was overwhelmingly defeated in a student election, when
students voted instead to officially adopt the cloud as their
symbol.
   The widespread media attention given that election attracted the
Japanese delegation.
   Tuesday's meeting began quietly, with Nash escorting the
visitors into a classroom and welcoming them.
   But the meeting turned sour when Sakae Ito, a 77-year-old
survivor of the atomic attack on Hiroshima, made a lengthy speech
about military symbolism and asked Nash to change the school symbol
to something more peaceful ``like cranes or rainbows.''
   ``The mushroom cloud reminds us of the tragedy of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki,'' she said through the interpreter. ``I feel sorry and
sad people here support the mushroom cloud.''
   Nash replied that many athletic teams in the United States used
aggressive symbols and noted that students voted to make the cloud
their official emblem.
   ``I'm not going to change it,'' he said before walking out.

   Riot troops ringed the house where Adolf
Hitler was born and police said they arrested eight people Thursday
for marking the 100th anniversary of the dictator's birth with Nazi
slogans and stiff-armed salutes.
   Hundreds of police swarmed this city of 17,000 people to prevent
a repeat of the 1979 clashes between neo-Nazis and leftists that
marked Hitler's 90th birthday. No serious incidents were reported.
   Across the border in West Germany, foreigners closed their
stores and kept children out of schools because of fears of
neo-Nazi violence. Several members of anti-Nazi vigilante groups
were arrested for carrying weapons.
   Security was heaviest here, at the two-story yellow house where
Hitler was born on April 20, 1889. The house, a former inn now used
as a day-care center for handicapped children, was sealed off with
metal barriers manned by dozens of police and special riot squads
with dogs.
   About 50 to 100 onlookers stood nearby. Nearly all shops along
the street were closed, some barricaded with wooden boards.
   Police said unspecified numbers of people were being turned back
at the border by West German or Austrian border police.
   A police spokesman said two Austrians, three Italians, two West
Germans and an American were arrested and face fines of up to
$2,300 for their public behavior.
   The Italians, one Austrian and the American gave the Nazi
salute, said a police official who did not give his name. One West
German was arrested after he shouted Nazi slogans and spat at
reporters. Police said he was carrying a large knife.
   Another West German also shouted anti-Semitic slogans, including
``Jew, go and rot!'' and ``This will be a national holiday in 100
years' time!''
   Officials did not identify those arrested. They were charged
with misdemeanors.
   On Wednesday, four Americans, an Irishman and a West German were
ordered by police to change their black boots and brown shirts,
garb reminiscent of Nazi uniforms, police said.
   ``Judging by what could have happened today, I am happy with the
security measures taken,'' Braunau Mayor Gerhard Skiba said.
   Skiba defended an anti-fascist memorial he ordered put up in
front of the ``Hitler House'' two weeks ago.
   ``I did not ask the city council, because I knew that the
(right-wing) Freedom party and part of the (conservative) Austrian
People's party were against it,'' he said.
   The memorial is made of granite from the quarry once worked by
prisoners at the nearby Nazi concentration camp of Mauthausen.
``For peace, freedom and democracy ... Never again fascism,
millions of dead warn,'' reads the inscription.
   Braunau was quiet, but at least four elderly people attracted
clusters of people as they glorified the Nazi past.
   ``The first and second world wars were started because Germany
was economically strong, too strong, and neither East nor West
wanted such an economic power,'' said one.
   In West Berlin, police arrested nine people who were driving
around in cars, apparently to defend against anti-Nazi attacks.
Police said they were carrying tear-gas pistols, helmets, clubs,
knives and other weapons.
   West Berlin police also said a Turkish cemetery was vandalized
early Thursday, with more than 38 grave stones were overturned or
damaged.
   Peter Frisch, vice-president of the Federal Office for the
Protection of the Constitution in Frankfurt, said foreigners,
particularly Turks, are most vulnerable to attacks.
   Turks in recent years have flocked to West Germany in search of
jobs, triggering resentment among many working-class Germans.
   ``They (the Turks) have assumed the role that the Jews played in
the Nazi ideology,'' Frisch said on the North German radio station.
   In Hamburg districts that have large foreign populations, a
``considerable number'' of parents kept their children out of
schools,'' a school spokesman said.
   Neo-Nazi leaflets circulating in Hamburg recently threatened
violence against foreign schoolchildren.
   Some foreign shopowners closed their stores Thursday in Hamburg.
   In Oslo, Norway, the Dagbladet newspaper marked the day by
publishing a survey that asked 50 children what they knew about
Hitler.
   All said he started World War II, occupied Norway and other
countries for five years, killed millions of Jews and committed
suicide when losing the war.
   ``He was an evil man and probably insane,'' one youngster wrote.

   Conflict has heightened in the Roman Catholic church
over Polish primate Cardinal Jozef Glemp's refusal to honor an
agreement to move a convent away from the Auschwitz death camp.
   Three of the four cardinals who signed the pact with Jewish
leaders in 1987 insisted Sunday that it be carried out. They include
the leaders of France and Belgium's Catholics.
   The three were responding to Glemp's suggestion last week that
the accord be renegotiated.
   Prelates Albert Decourtray of Lyon and Godfried Danneels of
Brussels and fellow Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger of Paris said in a
statement that Glemp ``could only have been speaking for himself.''
   Cardinal Franciszek Macharski of Krakow, Poland, the other
cardinal who signed the agreement, said Aug. 19 that he was
suspending the accord because of ``aggressive'' demands and protests
by Jewish activists at the convent located in his diocese.
   Glemp later angered many Jews and non-Jews with a sermon Aug. 26
in which he said Polish anti-Semitism would disappear if Jews would
abandon anti-Polish sentiments.
   He asked Jews to understand that it offended Poles' religious
sensibilities and feelings of sovereignty to insist on removal of
the Carmelite convent, which in 1984 was set up just outside the
fence surrounding the former Nazi concentration camp.
   ``Dear Jews, do not talk to us from the position of a nation
elevated over all others and do not put to us conditions that are
impossible to meet,'' Glemp said in the sermon.
   Glemp offended many Jews by suggesting Jews helped spread
Communism, and by mentioning that some collaborated with Nazis
during World War II or as businessmen neglected or detested Poles.
   Pope John Paul II has not commented on the dispute. Vatican
officials said in Rome that the Polish-born pope believes the Polish
church must resolve it.
   Jewish groups say the convent and its Christian religious
symbols, including a 23-foot cross, offend the memory of the 2.5
million Jews who died there during World War II.
   Under the 1987 agreement between a Jewish delegation and the four
archbishops, the nuns were to have been moved by Feb. 22 to an
interfaith prayer center to be built several thousand yards away.
   Glemp was quoted Saturday in Italian newspapers as saying it was
``a scandal'' to move the convent:
   ``I want this accord to be renegotiated,'' Glemp was quoted as
saying. ``It has to be done by competent people and not by just any
cardinal who doesn't understand the things.''
   In their statement issued in Paris, Decourtray, Lustiger and
Danneels defended the agreement, which they said was ``patiently and
loyally negotiated over two years,'' and the capacity of the
negotiators on the two sides.
   ``If the Jewish delegation at the Geneva meetings, led by Mr.
Theo Klein, then president of the European Jewish Congress, is `not
competent,' who would be?'' they asked.
   ``And if four cardinals, including the archbishop of Krakow, are
not qualified to represent the Catholic side, who might be? The
Auschwitz camp is in the Krakow diocese. According to church law,
its archbishop has full authority there. The cardinals who
accompanied him belong to nations who, in the West, were among the
chief victims of the Hitler barbarism.''
   Many Poles argue that there is nothing offensive about nuns
praying at a site where large numbers of Roman Catholics, as well as
Jews, were killed.
   ``The Jews should understand that devoting oneself to a life of
prayer near the place where Christians were martyred doesn't offend
their feelings,'' Glemp was quoted as saying in the Italian
interview.
   Speaking to reporters Sunday in Lyon, Decourtray said he hoped
the dispute could be resolved without requiring intervention by the
pope, who was Macharski's predecessor as archbishop of Krakow.
   ``I'll say that I am a little shocked, a little hurt by Monsignor
Glemp's statements,'' Decourtray said. ``But I want a clear
understanding. Like Mr. Theo Klein, I want Auschwitz to become again
a sacred place.''
   In Warsaw, a spokesman for the Catholic Episcopate, Marek Pernel,
said today that Glemp had not seen the cardinals' statement that
there would be no immediate comment.
   The Glemp comments reported Saturday were the primate's first
published remarks on the convent issue since his Aug. 26 sermon.
   Seven Jews, including Rabbi Avi Weiss of New York City,
demonstrated July 14 at the convent.
   Glemp was quoted as saying, ``A squad of seven New York Jews
launched an attack against the convent, but did not kill the nuns or
destroy the convent only because they were stopped.''
   The seven demonstrators were roughly dragged away by workmen at
the camp.
   In Chicago, Jewish leaders have called for a boycott of Glemp
during his scheduled Sept. 21-25 visit.
   Only several thousand Jews remain in Poland from a pre-war
population of 3.5 million. About 3 million Jews were among the 6
million Poles killed during World War II, and most of the rest have
emigrated.

   Communist authorities have resurrected the
image of Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, the enigmatic revolutionary who
restored Polish statehood 70 years ago and deposed the government
eight years later.
   Once consigned to Stalinist oblivion, Pilsudski is now being
honored by those same authorities who once scorned him as a
reactionary dictator.
   The government also mounted a gala celebration today marking the
anniversary of the birth of the prewar republic. A parliamentarian
had asked that today _ Nov. 11, the main national holiday before
World War II _ be officially restored as a state holiday.
   Today's ceremonies in Warsaw included a rare televised Mass and a
military parade in Victory Square. It represented the most elaborate
celebration ever under communist authorities to mark the 1918
creation of the capitalist, anti-Soviet republic in Poland between
the two world wars.
   Earlier this week, Krakow authorities named a street for
Pilsudski and a Warsaw newspaper launched a drive to set up a museum
for the marshal in the house he owned in Sulejowek, outside the
capital.
   The cult of Pilsudski has never quite died out in Poland. Go into
the home of nearly every supporter of the banned Solidarity trade
union movement and you see on the wall next to the Solidarity emblem
and photographs of Polish-born John Paul II the bushy moustache and
fiery eyes of Pilsudski.
   In recent years the communist party, stressing its role of
guarantor of the nation's existence, has begun to embrace popular
national symbols such as Pilsudski. But historically, Pilsudski is
harder for communists to swallow.
   Although he started out as a socialist, he abandoned most leftist
trappings soon after taking power.
   One of his most-quoted remarks was, ``I rode the red streetcar of
socialism, but got off at the stop called `Independence.'''
   Pilsudski's orientation was anti-Russian. He dreamed of creating
a multinational Central European state that would be large enough to
resist both Soviet and German hegemony.
   One of his first acts was invading the Ukraine, capturing Kiev.
Polish forces eventually were forced to retreat by the Red Army,
which in turn seemed on the verge of crossing Poland and spreading
communism to Germany in 1920.
   But the Poles' brilliant counteraction in mid-August 1920 handed
the Red Army a humiliating defeat, still remembered in Poland as the
``Miracle on the Vistula.''
   Lenin sued for peace, giving up large chunks of previously
Russian territory that remained in Poland's hands until the Soviet
Union took it back at the start of World War II. Pilsudski and
``White Poland'' were deemed ``class enemies.''
   Pilsudski is considered a hero because he united the country and
defended its independence at the end of World War I.
   Poland had been erased from the map of Europe but not from the
minds of Poles during the previous 123 years, having been
partitioned by Prussia, Austria and Russia. World War I and the
Bolshevik Revolution saw the collapse of all three partitioning
powers, allowing Poland to regain independence.
   At the start of World War I, Pilsudski had raised a Polish army
and put it in the service of Austria against Russia. But he was
imprisoned by Austria's ally Germany when he refused to put his
legions under German command.
   When German ranks collapsed in a general panic at the end of the
war, Pilsudski was freed from the castle where he was held.
   After arriving in Warsaw on Nov. 10, 1918, local citizens gave
him the title of commander. He ordered the disarmament of remaining
German troops and declared the Polish Republic restored. Power was
legally transferred to his government Nov. 11 from a Regency Council
set up by the Germans.
   But his reputation lost some luster in 1926 when, impatient with
discord in the elected government, he came out of retirement to
stage a military coup in which 300 people were killed.
   Although nominally out of power, he became Poland's
behind-the-scenes dictator until 1935 when he died and was buried in
Krakow's Wawel Castle alongside Polish kings.
   His senior officers, calling themselves the ``Sanitation''
regime, continued to rule until German and Soviet invasions in 1939
again wiped Poland off the map.
   Postwar Poland saw a new social order, dominated by communists
supported by the Soviet Union. Institutions such as Warsaw
University, which had borne the name of Pilsudski, were renamed.
Nov. 11 was treated as an ordinary work day.
   But 40 years later, the pendulum has swung back, with Pilsudski
restored to the status of national hero.

   Samuel Pisar saw the 50th anniversary of
World War II as a time to celebrate the triumph over evil, but the
dispute over a convent near the Auschwitz death camp he survived has
cast a shadow on his efforts at reconciliation.
   At the request of composer Leonard Bernstein, Pisar has written a
personal reminiscence of the destruction in his native land that he
will read at a concert Friday to mark the anniversary of the 1939
invasion of Poland by Germany that began the war.
   ``I decided to tackle it out of solidarity and out of a need for
reconciliation, because I don't believe in hereditary enemies of
history,'' Pisar said.
   ``This 50th anniversary is a very good moment to celebrate our
triumph over evil and move to a more hopeful future. I am telling a
Polish story, but also a Jewish story,'' he said.
   Pisar will narrate the concert which is to be broadcast live to
more than 20 countries. He plans to relate his experience, which he
says epitomizes that of many who endured World War II.
   He was 10 when the war struck his home city of Bialystok in
northeastern Poland. His mother wanted to flee, but his father,
whose family had been in Bialystok for several generations, did not.
   Pisar was the only member of his family to survive the years that
followed. The Gestapo killed his father and he lost his mother and
sister to the concentration camps that claimed the lives of at least
6 million other Jews.
   Sent from Auschwitz to camps in Germany as a forced laborer,
Pisar escaped from Dachau and was liberated by the American Army at
the age of 16.
   Now a lawyer in Paris, Pisar has made three previous trips to
Poland, accompanying American senators, international bankers and
former French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
   This trip is more personal. Pisar brought his wife and three
children with him to visit his native city of Bialystok in
northeastern Poland and then to travel to Auschwitz.
   They have arrived to find that 50 years has not healed the
spiritual wounds of war, and that the historic tension between
Catholic and Jews still impedes reconciliation.
   The Roman Catholic hierarchy's decision Aug. 10 to abrograte a
1987 agreement to move a Carmelite convent away from the Auschwitz
camp and remarks Saturday by the leader of Poland's Roman Catholic
church has left many Jews, including Pisar, troubled.
   ``I am happy to be here and I feel that peace is fragile and the
spark of freedom that we witness here today and that is so
encouraging, is fragile and yet I feel a discomfort, I feel a pain,
deep physical pain,'' Pisar said.
   ``For some strange reason at this precise moment of history to
focus on tensions between Jews and Poles _ the two people that
suffered more than any others from the Second World War _ seems not
only unnecessary but ... why give Hitler, posthumously, such a
satisfaction?'' he said.
   As one of the youngest camps survivors, Pisar says he feels
compelled to speak out.
   ``I don't want any polemics with the cardinal, but with due
respect, his words, even if well-intended, were ill-chosen. I am
disappointed and surprised,'' Pisar said.
   He was referring to an address by Cardinal Jozef Glemp at the
Jasna Gora Monastery in Czestochowa, Poland's most revered shrine,
in which Glemp said there would be no anti-Semitism in Poland if
Jews abandon anti-Polish sentiments.
   Speaking about the convent, Glemp said the nuns wanted to be a
symbol of human solidarity with the living and the dead and that
asking them to leave would offend the feelings of Poles.
   Pisar acknowledged that not only Jews were killed in Auschwitz,
but he said the site belongs to no one and that he could not
tolerate the appropriation of the Holocaust by Christian symbols.
   ``Auschwitz is a place that belongs to everybody and no one,'' he
said. ``It is the greatest wound ever inflicted on our civilization
and its deserves respect ... silence.''
   ``I feel no anger to the Carmelite nuns. I think they are sincere
in their desire to pray. I respect that, but I think it would be
better if they prayed outside the perimeter of the death camp and I
think God would be able to hear them better if they did,'' he said.
   Pisar said he hoped that Pope John Paul II would use his moral
authority to stop the dispute before it festers.
   ``He can bring it to a stop, and I wish he would, and that the
dead would be left alone because it is really needed out of respect
for the dead and compassion for the living.'' He said.

   Anti-Semitism is increasing in Hungary,
a rabbi said Wednesday, and he called for ties with Israel during
the first parliamentary commemoration of Holocaust victims.
   Rabbi Alfred Schoener addressed a session of Parliament that
paid tribute to the 600,000 Hungarian Jews who died in the
Holocaust and to tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians who
perished in World War II.
   The commemoration came on the 45th anniversary of the start of
mass deportations of Hungarian Jews to death camps.
   ``I don't know whether there is more anti-Semitism in Hungary
today than before, but I must say it has become more open,''
Schoener said.
   Swastikas were painted on a synagogue wall, the windows of
Jewish seminaries were broken, and Jews were being insulted in the
streets, he said.
   ``We must not allow anti-Semitism to grow in our society which,
undergoing democratization, allows many things to happen,''
Schoener said.
   He also complained Hungarian school textbooks contain only
cursory mention of the Holocaust and ``for some reason the very
word `Jew' has been avoided in the media.''
   Schoener also criticized the absence of a memorial to the 6
million Jews killed by the Nazis in World War II.
   One way of remembering the deportations would be ``to establish
full diplomatic rlations with Israel, where many Holocaust
survivors and relatives of beloved ones still live,'' the rabbi
said.
   Hungary, along with the rest of the Warsaw Pact, broke off
diplomatic relations with Israel after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   Parliamentary speaker Matyas Szueroes reviewed wartime
atrocities and said the persecution of Jews and others considered
undesirable by the fascists were ``swept under the carpet'' by
Hungarian leaders after the war.
   ``Let us now discuss what we have not been able to discuss for
over 40 years,'' said the speaker.
   He proposed that Parliament draft legislation to commemorate all
wartime victims.
   ``Let us tell the world that we Hungarians and other
nationalities living in Hungary are resolved never to let this
happen again,'' Szueroes said.
   Four other parliamentarians took the floor to criticize official
unwillingness to come to terms with wartime tragedies.
   Deputy Laszlo Czoma mentioned a history book published in
Hungary in 1975 that discussed the loss of human lives in one
sentence. Another sentence was devoted to the wartime losses of
livestock, he added.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens of Israel
visited on Wednesday the site of the Auschwitz death camp, where
millions of Jews died at the hands of their Nazi captors.
   ``You cannot travel to any country of Eastern Europe _ and
certainly not to Poland _ without pondering the tragic fate of the
Jewish nation during the last war,'' Arens said in an interview
with the government daily Rzeczpospolita Wednesday. He was visiting
Poland to renew full diplomatic ties.
   ``While being here, our delegation wants to go to all those
places where Jews have been killed.''
   Arens credited Poland with giving Jews ``great assistance''
during World War II, when an estimated 3 million of 3.5 million
Polish Jews were murdered by the Nazis. Millions of other Jews were
brought from across Europe to their deaths at camps in Poland.
   The Auschwitz complex and the adjacent Birkenau camp, an
integral part of German dictator Adolf Hitler's ``Final Solution,''
were built to exterminate Jews, and then Poles and other Slavs.
   Estimates of the death toll at the camp in southern Poland range
from 2.5 million to 4 million, the vast majority Jews.
   A Roman Catholic convent at the edge of the camp has strained
Jewish-Polish relations and stirred international controversy.
   Arens discussed the convent with Polish officials Tuesday. The
government underlined its support for building an alternate home
for the nuns. Ground was broken last week for an interfaith prayer
center, which will include a new convent.
   Arens visited the Majdanek concentration camp near Lublin in
southestern Poland on Monday at the start of his four-day visit.
   On Tuesday, Arens and Polish Foreign Minister Krzysztof
Skubiszewski signed an accord establishing full diplomatic
relations after a 23-year break.
   Poland became the third Warsaw Pact country after Hungary and
Czechoslovakia to renew relations with Israel in the past six
months.
   Poland, like the entire Soviet bloc except Romania, cut off
relations in 1967 to support the Arab side in a Middle East war
that year.

<HEAD>Thousands Arrive to Mark Warsaw Ghetto Uprising Anniversary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of people began arriving this
week for the 45th anniversary of the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto Uprising,
when starving and poorly armed Poles held off the final Nazi
extermination drive for nearly a month.
   About 4,500 guests from throughout the world are expected for
the April 14-19 observances, including the largest Israeli
delegation ever to visit Poland.
   Poland severed diplomatic ties with Israel after the outbreak of
the Middle East War in 1967, when Israel seized the West Bank and
Gaza Strip from Egypt and Jordan. Low-level diplomatic ties resumed
in 1986, with the two countries establishing diplomatic section
offices in each others' capitals.
   The observances climax on April 19 with a ceremony at the Warsaw
Ghetto Fighters' Monument. The monument sits in a plaza in an
apartment complex built on the rubble of the former ghetto, which
was razed by the Nazis.
   Nazis marched into the ghetto early on April 19, 1943, expecting
to organize a rapid deportation and eradication of the last 70,000
inhabitants.
   But they were met with fierce gunfire from the young warriors of
the ghetto's Jewish Defense Organization. The standoff continued
until mid-May, when the Nazis claimed victory and began deporting
the surviving inhabitants to death camps.
   The anniversary events have been jointly organized by Polish and
Israeli committees.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban told reporters Tuesday that
Poland will observe the anniversary as an event marking ``tragic
European and Polish events (which) refer to our past, predating the
creation of the state of Israel and the Middle East conflict.''
   He said Poland remains ``in full solidarity with the
Palestinians (in the Israeli-occupied territories) fighting for
their human and national rights.''
   He called Israel's behavior in the territories ``brutal'' and
``an offense to the memory of the defenders of the Warsaw Ghetto
... Contradictory to the ideals'' for which they fought.
   The Israeli visitors include Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon,
a Labor Party member who serves as minister of education and
culture, and Abram Sharir, a Likud member who is minister of
justice and tourism. They are the highest-ranked Israeli officials
ever to visit Poland.
   Although their visits are considered private, ``the whole event
has some influence on Polish-Israeli relations,'' said an Israeli
diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In addition to Navon and Sharir, the Israeli delegation includes
six members of parliament and 2,000 Israeli citizens.
   Other notables taking part in the observance are Edgar M.
Bronfman, president of the World Jewish Congress; the Israeli actor
Topol; author Jerzy Kosinski; and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie
Wiesel, who has written extensively about the Holocaust.
   Poland also expects delegations from the United States, Canada,
Australia and Western Europe.
   Activities planned include an international ``March of the
Living'' on Thursday from the former Nazi concentration camp of
Auschwitz, in southern Poland, to the mass extermination center of
Birkenau nearby.
   A two-day historical and scientific conference on the struggle
of Poles and Jews under the Nazi occupation begins Thursday in
Warsaw.
   On Sunday, Polish television will broadcast an Israeli-organized
quiz program for young people on the history of the Warsaw ghetto.
   About 120 Poles are to be honored as ``Righteous Among Nations''
by the Israeli Yad Vashem Institute for the aid they gave Jews
during World War II.
   On Monday, a newly built monument at Umschlagplatz, where Polish
Jews were loaded onto trains for the trip to the Treblinka death
camp, will be dedicated.
   A group led by the last surviving commander of the uprising,
Marek Edelman, plans to hold its own observances on Sunday.
   The group includes several activists of the outlawed Solidarity
trade union federation and prominent cultural figures.

<DESCRIPT>  JAPAN; MOVIE; PROFESSIONAL; PROFILE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  WITH the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor looming at the end of the year,
Japan's greatest filmmaker has launched a bombshell at U.S. moviegoers.;
After five decades of directing, 29 feature films, two Oscars and every other
award the world of cinema can think to bestow, 80-year-old Akira Kurosawa has
finally made a movie about the subject that has been lurking in his mind like
a bad dream for 45 years: the atomic bomb.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  AKIRA KUROSAWA'S NAGASAKI DREAM
CONTROVERSIAL NEW FILM 'FORGIVES' U.S. FOR
DROPPING THE BOMB  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Film  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Post-nuclear family;  Kurosawa's new "Rhapsody in August" is a beautiful,
engaging and unforgettable story of one family's reaction to the nuclear
attack on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945. It is also a story that seems certain to
infuriate many Americans.;    That's what happened here the other day, when
the director previewed his newest creation for an audience of reporters, both
Japanese and foreign. At the ensuing press conference, Kurosawa ran into so
much hostility from the foreign press that he finally stopped taking
questions.;    The film starts out as if Kurosawa is going to portray the
United States as a murderous evil empire. "The Americans dropped the bomb on
us," one of the characters says early on, "and now they don't want to think
about it.";    But all of a sudden, a completely sympathetic American appears,
played by Hollywood heart-throb Richard Gere, who speaks Japanese for his
part. In the crucial scene between the strong Japanese heroine and a somewhat
wimpy Gere, Kurosawa quite clearly forgives America for dropping history's
only A-bombs on his country.;    Whose fault?;  For Japanese audiences, this
act of forgiveness is an interesting and perhaps touching development. But in
the West, it will provoke obvious questions: Is it really America that needs
to be forgiven for the tragedies of World War II? Why doesn't this movie ever
point out that Japan started the war? Why focus on Nagasaki and ignore what
Japan did at Nanking, Pearl Harbor, Bataan?;    "That would be a different
movie," Kurosawa explained at the press conference, reeling at the steady
media attack. "It was not my intention to make a movie about Pearl Harbor. I
wanted to tell the story of this family in Nagasaki, and to do that you have
to tell the story of the atomic bomb that was dropped there.";    "Rhapsody in
August" is more accessible than the exotic world of Kurosawa's film of last
year, "Dreams," and more entertaining than his Best Foreign Language Film
Oscar winner, "Dersu Uzala" (1975).;    "Rhapsody in August" is tentatively
scheduled to open in the United States the first week in December -- the
anniversary week of the Pearl Harbor attack. But it may not wait that long.
The film will be featured at the Cannes festival later this spring, and it's
scheduled to open in Japan in May. The resulting publicity may lead to an
earlier U.S. debut.;    Kurosawa buffs will find in "Rhapsody" all the
signature touches: the fascination with clouds and heavy rain, the beautiful
forest scenes, the Western music, the amplified background sounds, the
repeated symbolic motifs.;    Even people who aren't into the aesthetics of
artsy Japanese films will fall under the spell of Sachiko Murase, in a
riveting performance as the 80-ish grandmother, and the four fresh youngsters
who play her grandchildren. Despite the forbidding topic, much of the movie
has the same playful air as Kurosawa's samurai bounty-hunter movie "Yojimbo.";
   Caught up in history;    The time is August 1990, and four kids are
spending summer vacation at grandmother's farm outside Nagasaki. Like the
young people in most Kurosawa films, these trendy, happy-go-lucky kids know no
history. They have no interest in World War II or the atomic bombs that ended
it.;    Almost in spite of themselves, though, the four children get caught up
in their grandmother's tales of the war years. Gradually, they discover that
her husband and some of her siblings were killed in the atomic blast.;    The
kids also learn that summer that they have a rich Japanese-American cousin in
Hawaii. When it turns out that this cousin is coming to Nagasaki to visit
grandmother, everyone agrees not to mention the nuclear blast. Americans,
after all, won't want to hear about it.;    Richard Gere is cast as the
Japanese-American relative. Presumably there will be controversy aplenty about
his thoroughly apologetic American view of the war. He evidently doesn't
remember Pearl Harbor, but he sheds tears when he meets some disabled victims
of the bomb.;    And then he falls all over himself telling grandmother how
sorry he is that Americans dropped the bomb that killed her husband.;    "It's
OK," she says, in the climactic scene, with Gere and grandmother sitting on a
bench beneath an impossibly big full moon. "Don't worry about it. It's all
right now.";    And with that, America stands forgiven.;    Actually, it's the
American people, not the government, whom Kurosawa is forgiving in this film.;
   "I have dealt with this theme in my samurai movies," Kurosawa said. "I'm
trying to say that war is not a matter between the people of the two
countries. It's the politics, the leaders, who make war. When grandmother
says, 'It's OK, thank you,' it is an act of forgiveness between the people of
the countries.";    But will the movie-going people of the United States be
willing to forgive Kurosawa for his atom bomb movie? The combative
octogenarian says he frankly doesn't care.;    "All I want is for movie lovers
to come see my film," he said. "All I'm doing is expressing myself. If you
disagree with me, that's fine. Fire away!"  </TEXT>

Before the desperate Jewish resistance leaders smuggled him into the Warsaw
ghetto and a Nazi concentration camp, they apologized to the young, Catholic,
Polish underground member. "We are sorry," they told 28-year-old Jan Karski one
day in late September, 1942, "that you will have to take such memories as these
with you throughout your life."
</P>
<P>
He was used to danger, this Jan Karski, who served as a courier between the
underground in Poland and the Polish government-in-exile from 1939 to 1943.
Four times he had picked his way across Nazi-dominated Europe on secret
missions. Captured by the Soviets in 1939, he escaped. Arrested by the Gestapo
in 1940, he was tortured and tried unsuccessfully to commit suicide in order to
protect underground secrets. A daring rescue effort by the Polish underground
finally freed him.
</P>
<P>
All this was nothing to him; danger had become a way of life for the young man
whose life as a diplomat had been ambushed in 1939 by the whims of war.
</P>
<P>
But this secret mission proposed by the two Jewish underground leaders involved
danger of a different sort: The danger of being haunted by memories that cannot
be tamed and processed by the civilized, conscious mind. It is the stuff of
which nightmares are made. Still, the Jews felt that they had no choice but to
ask the young man. The silence must be broken, they said, and the world
informed of the terrible things happening in the Warsaw ghetto and in the
camps. And then they set forth their proposal:
</P>
<P>
We know Hitler has decided on the total destruction of the Jews in Europe. This
is our end. The Jews are totally helpless. The Poles may save individuals but
they cannot stop extermination. You must take our message to London and you
must try to get in touch with as many Allied leaders as possible. You must
convince them that only the powerful Western Allies can help now.
</P>
<P>
There is a pause and the voice telling you this story stops; a lighter flares
and the first of many cigarettes is lighted. Then the heavily accented voice
continues:
</P>
<P>
But we know England; we know the West. What you are going to tell them is
unprecedented. They may have doubts. It would help us if you could say that you
saw it with your own eyes. We could smuggle you into the ghetto in Warsaw. No
danger whatsoever to you. I will be your guide. And we could try to smuggle you
into the Belzec camp. This is dangerous but we wouldn't expose you to certain
death. Will you go?
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'I will go,' " recalls Karski now, stopping to tap out a cigarette in
an ashtray, a move that reveals the faint scars on his wrist -- remnants of the
suicide attempt almost half a century ago. He is sitting in the living room of
his tidy, white house in the suburbs of Washington.
</P>
<P>
But Karski is not here; he is back in the season of memory, back in the Poland
of World War II:
</P>
<P>
"And then we went. Twice I saw the ghetto. I . . . saw . . . horrible . . .
things," he says slowly. "The first time I couldn't take it. We left. But then
I said: 'I want to go again. I want to see.' It was not difficult to get in."
</P>
<P>
Nor out. Unless you were a Jew.
</P>
<P>
To get into the concentration camp, he dressed in a soldier's uniform. "I spent
20 minutes, 30 minutes in Belzec," says Karski, now 75 and a semiretired
adjunct professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. "I
couldn't take it," he says, blinking his eyes against the tears.
</P>
<P>
Karski had been charged by the leaders of the Jewish resistance to tell the
Western leaders about the impending extermination of an entire people and to
demand that they take steps to halt it. Accordingly, in 1943, he met with top
Allied leaders, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt and British Foreign
Secretary Anthony Eden. In the United States, he also had face-to-face meetings
with Justice Felix Frankfurter and other Jewish intellectuals and leaders.
</P>
<P>
His reports to them included information about the desperate situation of the
Jews in Poland. Afterward, he felt his "Jewish message" was largely ignored by
the Allied leaders. "I thought it might help; it didn't," he says. In 1943 he
was unable to return to Poland because of the danger involved. The following
year, he wrote a book about his experiences and delivered more than 200
speeches in this country, always speaking of "the Jewish tragedy."
</P>
<P>
"It was pure duty," he says now of his commitment to speaking out. "At the
time, I had to do it."
</P>
<P>
At war's end, however, Karski retreated into silence about his wartime
experiences. He made the United States his home and enrolled at Georgetown
University as a graduate student. After three years, he earned his doctorate in
government (he already had a double master's in law and diplomatic history
earned before the war) and began a 37-year career as a highly respected
professor at Georgetown. In 1985 he produced a massive book, "The Great Powers
and Poland, 1919-1945," which was hailed as a "truly remarkable work."
</P>
<P>
He was "bitter," he says, at war's end when the leaders of the Western world
expressed horror and surprise at what had happened in the concentration camps.
He argues that it was impossible for them not to know.
</P>
<P>
"But please don't write that Karski is the first one to inform the Western
leaders," he says. "That is a nonsense. There were Jewish escapees who had gone
to Switzerland and Sweden, passing secret reports. The Polish underground had
daily communication with London, reporting the situation of the Jews. And, most
important, the Allied governments had secret agents in every country. So to
argue the leaders did not know is a nonsense.
</P>
<P>
"But after the war American, British, French leaders, church officials -- they
go to Auschwitz, to Treblinka, to Buchenwald. Their comments were always the
same. 'We didn't know that such things were possible. We were not aware of it.'
(Gen. Dwight D.) Eisenhower visited a concentration camp, and the press
reported that Eisenhower was so moved that he 'lost power of speech' for a few
moments. Reading what those leaders were saying -- that it was a secret, they
didn't know -- I was disgusted. Disgusted. And I don't hesitate to use this
word. It was then I got out of this business of the war.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to be integrated into American life as soon as possible," Karski
says. "The same with my wife, Pola Nirenska. She is Jewish. All of her family
left in Poland perished. In the ghettos, in the concentration camps, in gas
chambers. We never discuss the war at home."
</P>
<P>
Later, however, deeper into the interview, he will explain his need to distance
himself from the past in a more emotional way: "I wanted to run away after the
war," he will say in a halting voice. "I saw too much. I saw too much misery,
hatred, ruthlessness, human losses." He will stop, search for the words. "I . .
. saw . . . horrible . . . things. What I learned from the war made me silent
for 30 years. I buried myself in the anonymous academic community."
</P>
<P>
In 1980, a phone call from a concentration camp survivor persuaded Jan Karski
to break his silence.
</P>
<P>
The caller was Elie Wiesel, survivor of Auschwitz and Buchenwald, an author and
professor at Boston University, who would be awarded in 1986 the Nobel Prize
for Peace.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Elie Wiesel, then the chairman of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Committee, was organizing a unique international conference to be held in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to bring together people from all over the world who had liberated
the (concentration) camps," says Wiesel. "Not the survivors, but the people who
had liberated us. The first people to have seen us, to have seen hell, were in
a very special category. So I brought to Washington liberators and also people
who tried to prevent the tragedy."
</P>
<P>
Karski was invited to speak at the International Conference of Liberators in
Washington in October, 1981.
</P>
<P>
"At first, I said I would not do it," Karski says, recalling his telephone
conversation with Wiesel.
</P>
<P>
"I am telling you that you will come," was Wiesel's response.
</P>
<P>
"And so I did go," says Karski now, imitating with affection Wiesel's insistent
tone. "I gave my report, it lasted 35 minutes, and they filmed it. Then came
the publicity."
</P>
<P>
"No speaker affected the audience as much as Karski," recalls Wiesel, "He
received an ovation."
</P>
<P>
At about the same time that the conference took place, Karski received a letter
from filmmaker Claude Lanzmann, who was working on "Shoah," a monumental
documentary of the Holocaust. After some reluctance, Karski agreed to be
interviewed. "It was my duty to do it," he says simply.
</P>
<P>
From eight hours of taped interviews with Karski, about 40 minutes were used in
the 9 1/2-hour film.
</P>
<P>
It was a very difficult experience for Karski. "A few times I broke down," he
recalls. "My wife could not stand it. She left the house." The end result, he
feels, "is the greatest film ever made on the Jewish Holocaust."
</P>
<P>
Wiesel makes an observation about Karski: "He is a man of absolute integrity,
of extraordinary force of character. But I had the feeling from the moment I
met him that he was a wounded person, that he carried secret, invisible wounds
in him. The moment we touched on a certain area, I saw he was fighting the
memories. I saw the tears in his eyes. I was very moved by the man."
</P>
<P>
There's a pause. Then: "But I think he feels that he failed," Wiesel says. "He
tried to speak and people didn't want to hear."
</P>
<P>
The past, someone observed, is a foreign country; they do things differently
there.
</P>
<P>
"I will tell you this -- Jan Karski is not my family name; it is an assumed
name," says the man sitting opposite you. He says his real name is Kozielewski,
and he grew up in a large, devout Catholic family. From his youth, he planned
to enter the diplomatic life. He smiles. "But then, most of my life turned out
to be not planned. Once the war started . . . " and here he searches for a
word, "accidents took over."
</P>
<P>
In Karski's home there is a room filled with awards, medals, plaques and
scrolls, each honoring one deed or another performed by the young underground
courier who, you might say, lived only in those few years between 1939 and
1945. There is a tree bearing the name of Jan Karski in the Garden of the
Righteous Gentiles at Yad Vashem memorial in Jerusalem. A poem appeared in 1988
in The Nation magazine, written by Paul Genega and titled "The Courier." It was
about Karski.
</P>
<P>
Now, strolling with his 80-year-old wife in the bright sunlight of his garden,
Karski is asked about his connection with the past, with the man who was
captured and tortured and smuggled into the ghetto and met with the great
leaders of the Western world. Is he still that Jan Karski?
</P>
<P>
"Now, I will tell you," he says, blinking in the sun. "Who is Karski for me? I
know thousands of people, and I will tell you frankly that the man who
interests me the least is Jan Karski." He laughs. "I don't have an attachment
to Jan Karski. I don't take him too seriously. I know him too well. What can I
say? Jan Karski did what he had to do."

<TEXT>
   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev spent
Friday in closed meetings with other Warsaw Pact leaders, and his
wife Raisa visited Auschwitz, where 4 million people were killed in
Nazi death camps.
   Gorbachev's proposals for new efforts to break a deadlock with
NATO over reducing conventional forces in Europe, already rejected
by the United States, were among the topics for discussion in the
first of two days of private talks.
   A brief official report of the proceedings said Gorbachev and
the other leaders addressed the opening-day session, but gave no
details. They met in the Council of Ministers Palace, where the
Treaty of Warsaw was signed in 1955 to formalize the political and
military alliance.
   The official news agency PAP later reported dinner toasts by
Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania and Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Ceausescu called for talks aimed at eliminating short-range
nuclear missiles in Europe _ those with ranges up to 300 miles,
which are not included in the U.S.-Soviet treaty to scrap
medium-range weapons, the agency said.
   Jaruzelski said Gorbachev's proposals for talks on reducing
conventional forces were ``valuable, original initiatives'' and
were discussed in the first day's session.
   Mrs. Gorbachev returned to southern Poland, which the Gorbachevs
visited earlier in the week, to memorialize those who died during
World War II in the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp.
   She laid bouquets of red carnations at Execution Wall and at the
Russian-language tablet that is part of an international monument
to the dead.
   Wiping a tear from her cheek, Mrs. Gorbachev said after touring
the camp that almost 50 years since the beginning of World War II
the camp still reminds the living of ``the hope, human fear and
bravery'' of its inmates.
   ``It should remind us all that what is most precious in this
world is the right to live and be free,'' she said in brief remarks
broadcast by state television.
   Soviet forces liberated Auschwitz, built by the Germans after
they occupied Poland at the beginning of the war, in January 1945
and it has been preserved as a museum. The gas chambers and
crematoria of Birkenau were largely destroyed by retreating German
forces, and the site is marked by a stone monument and tablets in
many languages.
   The combined camp was the center of Hitler's effort to wipe out
European Jews, millions of whom lived in Poland and Nazi-occupied
regions of the Soviet Union.
   Next to Poles, both Jew and Christian, more than 1 million
Soviet citizens made up the largest single nationality among the
victims. Soviet prisoners of war received particularly harsh
treatment in the slave-labor sections of the complex.
   News coverage of Mrs. Gorbachev's visit, the first event of the
six-day visit to Poland when she did not accompany her husband, was
restricted to Soviet and Polish media.
   The meeting of the Warsaw Pact's political-consultative council
is the first since the fourth Gorbachev-Reagan summit six weeks ago
in Moscow.
   It also was the Soviet leader's first opportunity to brief his
allies on the Soviet Union's national Communist Party conference at
the end of June, which reiterated his policy of encouraging
economic and social reform.
   When he arrived Monday, Gorbachev proposed that negotiators from
East and West meet informally to seek ways of breaking the impasse
that for years has blocked mutual reductions of conventional forces
in Europe.
   Washington issued a statement saying appropriate forums already
exist in Vienna and elsewhere for discussing arms reduction and
that any such talks should include representatives of all NATO
countries.
   The U.S. response was equally cool to Gorbachev's suggestion
that the Soviet Union would withdraw an unspecified number of its
military aircraft from Eastern Europe if NATO drops a plan to
redeploy 72 American F-16s from Spain to Italy.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea's official news media reported some
200,000 people attended an anti-American rally in Pyongyang Sunday
and speakers called for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South
Korea.
   In another report the state-run media said more than 100,000
North Koreans lined Pyongyang streets to welcome PLO chief Yasser
who previously visited Pakistan and China.
   Choe Mun Son, chief of the the Pyongyang committee of the ruling
Workers (communist) Party, addressed the rally.
   The official Korean Central News Agency, monitored in Toyko,
reported Choe said: ``Now that the Soviet Union has taken the
initiative in disarmament, the East-West situation is showing signs
of detente and foreign troops are withdrawing from other regions of
the world, the United States must withdraw its troops and nuclear
weapons from South Korea.''
   The agency said the rally marked ``June 25, the day of struggle
against U.S. imperialism.''
   On June 25, 1950, North Korean troops invaded South Korea,
starting a war that ended with an armistice on July 27, 1953.
   The United States has some 43,000 military personnel stationed in
South Korea under a mutual defense pact. North Korea claims they are
blocking a peaceful reunification of the country, divided since the
end of World War II in 1945.
   Choe told the rally the United States had started the Korean War
_ ``a most cruel and brutal, homicidal war.''
   ``Today, South Korea has turned into the biggest nuclear arsenal
in the Far East, a most dangerous hotbed of nuclear war in the world
due to U.S. imperialist moves toward nuclear war,'' Choe said,
according to the Korean Central News Agency - KCNA.
   The agency reported anti-American demonstrations were held
Saturday throughout North Korea.
   KCNA said Arafat was greeted at the airport by Vice President Li
Jong Ok and other officials. It said the airport was decorated with
portraits of Arafat and President Kim Il Sung.
   Earlier Sunday, Arafat's plane made a brief stop at the Beijing
airport and the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman was met
by Yang Fuchang, assistant to the foreign minister.
   China's official Xinhua news agency reported Yang conveyed the
greetings of China's communist leaders.
   The report referred to Arafat as president of the state of
Palestine. China has recognized a Palestinian government in exile.
   Arafat flew to Beijing from Pakistan, where he met with
government leaders Saturday in Islamabad and offered to mediate a
political solution to the civil war in neighboring Afghanistan.

   When Hiroshima remembers the atom bomb
it is with a flock of doves and a mournful tolling of bells. On the
central monument to the bomb victims is a prayer ``that this evil
shall never be repeated.''
   Forty-five years after the United States dropped the first
atomic bomb, Hiroshima continues to lay the grim realities of
nuclear war before the world.
   In Japan, most remembrances of the Aug. 6, 1945 bombing focus on
the horrors of the atom bomb and the 140,000 deaths it caused, and
rarely on the responsibility of the warring nations.
   When Hiroshima began refurbishing its Peace Memorial Museum last
year, 16 groups of citizens, bomb victims and labor unions demanded
the city include an ``aggressor's corner'' that would focus on
Japan's aggressive role in World War II.
   City officials refused. In a written statement, the city quoted
former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who said in 1988 that it
was unclear that Japan was an aggressor in World War II.
   ``The purpose of this museum is to bear witness to what happened
on August 6th in Hiroshima,'' said Yoshitaka Kawamoto, president of
the museum.
   The museum's exhibits say the atomic attack was aimed at
civilians.
   ``If we had a display about Japan's aggressive role, people will
think it is natural for aggressors to be atom-bombed,'' said Toru
Kataoka, manager of the Peace Culture Center, which is housed in
one of three major buildings at the Peace Park. ``It opposes our
basic policy on the museum, which is to pray for the victims.''
   More than 20,000 of those victims were Koreans, brought here as
slave laborers during Japan's 35-year colonization of the
neighboring Korean peninsula.
   They have seldom been recognized.
   When South Koreans built a monument in 1970 to honor their
countrymen who died in the blast, city officials said there was no
room in the Peace Memorial Park, citing the 20 monuments there
already.
   The Koreans kept up their pressure and in May, the city relented.
   In Hiroshima, the city's efforts to preserve the horrific
experience continue. Last year, the city collected more than $2.5
million in public donations to preserve the atom-bomb dome, the
hulking skeletal remnants of a building left standing near the
center of the blast.
   Preserving the dome is important ``because its ravaged state
sounds a warning about the potential for humanity to destroy itself
with nuclear weapons,'' Mayor Takeshi Araki said last year.
   Most Japanese observe the anniversary of the atomic bombings
mournfully, adding names to lists of those who have died in the
past year due to the continuing effects of radiation or other
injuries.
   This year, the victims will also be honored in the United States.
   At a desert ceremony west of Salt Lake City later this month,
members of the squadron that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima will
dedicate a 16-foot obelisk honoring their bomber group and ``all
who contributed to bring this dreadful war to an end.''
   The group will also honor those who died in the blast at
Hiroshima and at Nagasaki, where a second atom bomb was dropped
three days after the bombing of Hiroshima.
   Japan surrendered six days after the atomic bombing of Nagasaki,
ending World War II.

<HEAD>Gas Station Fuels Controversy During Ghetto Anniversary</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The designer of a monument to 300,000 Jews
who were sent to their deaths during World War II says an adjoining
gas station should be closed because it is insulting to the victims.
   The filling station abuts the sparkling new marble-and-stone
memorial at Umschlagplatz, the railroad siding which bordered the
walled Jewish ghetto during the war.
   The monument is being dedicated Monday as part of elaborately
planned observances marking the 45th anniversary of the doomed
Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, in which some of the last 70,000
inhabitants took up arms against the final Nazi eradication drive
on April 19, 1943.
   Workmen were busily trying to complete the 20-yard-by-6-yard
memorial this week, but whether the gas station next door will
reopen in a few weeks remained unclear and a source of controversy.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Stefan Staniszewski said Thursday
that official plans always have been to close down the the station
once the monument was built.
   But Roman Slawinski, director of the Warsaw branch of the state
gasoline monopoly CPN, said the station will reopen after the
anniversary ceremonies.
   He did not elaborate, but an official source demanding anonymity
said the station ``will start operations again until another
location is decided upon, and another station is built at the
expense of those building the monument.''
   According to the designer of the monument, Hanna Szmalenberg,
that is ``blackmail.''
   ``It shouldn't be there,'' she said. ``No other important
monument has a gas station nearby. It is insulting to the memory.''
   She said the station should never have been constructed at the
site and charged that putting it there in the first place was a
``political decision'' which stemmed from an anti-Semitic purge
which took place in Poland in 1968.
   Even though an Israeli donor has offered to pay for construction
of a replacement gas station, she said, CPN has been holding out
for more money.
   Ms. Szmalenberg, interviewed in the gas station lot Wednesday,
said she designed the $252,000 monument as an enclosed rectangle in
part because of the station's proximity.
   There often are long lines of cars at Polish gas stations, and
idling vehicles just a few feet from the monument could be expected
to disturb visitors, she said.
   In her design, she said, visitors will be able to step inside to
partially avoid the fumes and the traffic noise.
   Visitors will enter under a sculpted arch. Inscribed on the
walls inside are about 400 names, representing some of the victims
who passed through Umschlagplatz. Previously, a small tablet marked
the site.
   About 450,000 Jews from the city and the surrounding countryside
were crowded into the Warsaw Ghetto after the 1939 Nazi occupation.
The Nazis enclosed the quarter with a barbed-wired-lined brick wall.
   The railroad siding at the tightly guarded square of
Umschlagplatz _ German for ``deportation point'' _ was the only
exit for 300,000 Jews, who there were loaded onto boxcars bound for
the Treblinka and Majdanek death camps.
   Ms. Szmalenberg said she was skeptical of official promises that
the station later would be shut down for good.
   The pumps have been taken down but the office has not been
touched, standing only about a dozen yards from the monument.
   ``Even the Warsaw authorities are not strong enough to get the
gasoline people to change their mind,'' she said.
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban, asked about it on Tuesday,
said, ``I really don't understand _ and you must pardon me for this
_ what the problem is, because it concerns some technical details.''
   If the filling station poses an obstacle to the monument itself,
``then it goes without saying that it will be closed down for
good,'' he said. But if the station is just an impediment to the
ceremonies, ``it is a different matter.''

   The Soviet Union apologized Friday for one of the
grisliest crimes of the Stalin era: the murder of thousands of
imprisoned Polish officers shot during World War II and buried in
mass graves in the Katyn Forest.
   The confession ended nearly 50 years of official Soviet denial
and had been almost a prerequisite for improved Polish-Soviet
relations. The Soviet Union previously insisted that Nazi Germany
was responsible for the massacre.
   Polish and Western historians long have blamed the NKVD, Josef
Stalin's secret police, for killing more than 4,000 officers in the
Katyn Forest near Smolensk. They were captured by the Soviets at
the beginning of World War II.
   More than 10,000 other Polish officers were killed in camps
elsewhere. Their bodies have never been found, but in its statement
Friday the Soviet Union clearly tied together the fates of all
15,000 officers, some of the cream of prewar Polish society.
   The admission came 47 years to the day when the Nazis announced
the discovery of the Katyn graves. And it came one day after East
Germany's new Parliament apologized for the Holocaust and for the
deaths of millions of Soviets in World War II.
   The statement carried by the official news agency Tass was
issued as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with Polish President
Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   Poland had urged the Soviet Union to admit responsibility for
the mass slayings, saying such ``blank spots'' in history were a
barrier to better Polish-Soviet relations.
   Gorbachev gave Jaruzelski copies of the material from Soviet
archives pertaining to the Poles imprisoned in the NKVD camps, Tass
reported.
   In a speech at a dinner Friday night honoring Jaruzelski,
Gorbachev referred to the massacre, Tass reported. He said the two
leaders talked about ``those historical `knots' that even many
years later cast shadows on our relations. Many of them are undone
already.''
   ``Recently, documents have been discovered which indirectly but
convincingly testify that thousands of Polish officers who died in
the Smolensk woods half a century ago became victims of (Stalin's
secret police chief Lavrenti) Beria and his henchmen,'' Tass quoted
Gorbachev as saying.
   ``The graves of the Polish officers are near Soviet people's
graves, who fell from the same evil hand,'' he said. ``It is not
easy to speak about this tragedy but we must speak about it for
only through the truth there lies the way to genuine renewal and to
genuine mutual understanding.''
   The earlier statement said the ``Soviet side, expressing its
deep regret in connection with the Katyn tragedy, states that it is
one of the most horrifying Stalinist crimes,'' Tass said.
   ``It's good that criminals admit their crimes,'' Polish
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said in Gdansk. But other problems
remain, including war reparations, he said.
   The massacre has caused bitterness among Poles for years despite
the previous Communist government's loyal statements supporting the
Soviet Union.
   Jaruzelski is scheduled to visit a memorial at Katyn on
Saturday, following pilgrimages of Poles whose relatives and
friends died in the massacre.
   The officers were captured by the Soviet Union when it invaded
eastern Poland at the beginning of World War II, shortly after
Hitler sent his soldiers across Poland's western border to start
the war.
   They were shot in the back of the head and stacked in layers in
mass graves. The bodies were found in April 1943 by German soldiers
who captured the area during World War II. They were immediately
used for propaganda purposes.
   Stalin blamed the Nazis for the deaths. Soviet historians
recently began questioning that version, but it stood until the
Soviet Union admitted responsibility Friday. A U.S. congressional
committee in the early 1950s blamed the Soviets.
   Under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, the Soviet Union has
brought to light many of the deeds of Stalin and his henchmen, but
Katyn was one of the final affairs to be touched by the greater
openness.
   Records indicate that only 394 of the 15,000 captured Polish
prisoners were transferred to the Gryazovetsky prison camp. The
rest were turned over to the NKVD, the predecessor of the KGB, in
Smolensk; Voroshilovgrad in the Ukraine; and Kalinin northwest of
Moscow. All the officers disappeared from NKVD records, Tass said.
   Beria and others were executed after Stalin died in 1953.
   Historian Natalia Lebedeva, writing in the weekly Moscow News on
March 25, said the officers apparently were killed in a single
operation as the NKVD evacuated three camps. The Soviets might have
considered the Polish officers a threat as potential future leaders
of Poland.
   Ms. Lebedeva, who used Soviet central archives and Soviet army
records, called it a ``well-thought-through and carefully planned
operation.''
   In Warsaw, Polish relatives of the victims were pleased the
truth finally had come out, but expressed regret it took so long.
   ``I awfully regret that my mother could not live until this
day,'' said Wanda Zadrozna, crying as she recalled her father's
murder. ``There is a great regret that it took 50 years and the
wives of those people didn't live until this day.''
   ``But whatever happens now, it is good that the truth will be
finally written in history,'' she said.

FT  30 JUL 94 / Heroism and wickedness in Warsaw: Stalin's troops looked on
with folded arms as 20,000 Poles fought to the death - Walesa has invited
Russian and German leaders to commemorate the anniversary of the tragic
Warsaw uprising
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Few episodes of the second world war revealed so clearly the depths of human
wickedness and the heights of personal and collective heroism as the Warsaw
rising, whose 50th anniversary will be commemorated this weekend in the
Polish capital.
The rising, 63 days of increasingly desperate street fighting between
150,000 ill-armed volunteers of the Polish Home Army (the AK or Armia
Krajowa) and a pitiless Nazi annihilation force, took place while Stalin,
whose soldiers were encamped just across the River Vistula, looked on with
folded arms, and the western allies were preoccupied with the battle for
France.
'The decision to launch the rising represents for the Poles the most tragic
mistake in their recent history,' wrote historian Norman Davies, author of
God's Playground, the most authoritative contemporary history of Poland. Its
failure scarred a generation of Poles and set the scene for 45 years of
east-west mistrust and the cold war.
Given this background, the decision of Polish President Lech Walesa to
invite the presidents of re-united Germany and post-communist Russia, as
well as representatives of the war-time allied powers, to this weekend's
ceremonies has been controversial. Intended as a gesture of forgiveness for
crimes which Poles will never permit to be forgotten, the Russo-German
presence has been fiercely criticised by Mr Walesa's domestic political
opponents and nationalist critics.
Mr Roman Herzog, the recently elected German president, accepted under the
unfortunate misapprehension that the object of commemoration was an earlier
slaughter of the innocents, the desperate Warsaw Ghetto uprising of April
1943 when the last remnants of the Jewish ghetto fought a doomed battle to
prevent their transport to the death camps, while Russian President Boris
Yeltsin passed the invitation on to lesser officials. Prime minister John
Major is representing Britain but US President Bill Clinton, who toured
central Europe before the Naples summit, is sending Vice President Al Gore.
The international line-up may be lighter and more controversial than hoped.
But nothing can take away from the significance of the event being
commemorated.
Five decades ago Soviet forces under General Rokossowski had advanced to the
suburbs of Warsaw. German troops under General Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski
were evacuating stores and preparing to vacate the city. In his makeshift
underground headquarters General Tadeusz Bor-Komorowski, commander of the
Polish Home Army and the chief delegate from the Polish government in exile
in London were debating how and when to strike what they hoped would be a
decisive blow for liberation.
On the evening of July 29, Moscow Radio broadcast to Warsaw that 'the hour
of action has arrived.' This apparent invitation to take up arms against the
retreating Nazi's was accompanied by the first sighting of Soviet T-34 tanks
in Praga, a suburb just across the river Vistula from the historic town
centre.
The rising began at five o'clock on the afternoon of August 1 and ended two
months later with the surrender of the last pockets of Polish resistance. It
was followed by the forced evacuation of the surviving population and the
systematic destruction of 85 per cent of the city on Hitler's express
orders.
The outcome of the unequal battle was never in doubt after the hoped for
Soviet intervention failed to materialise and the first four days of
fighting failed to secure the airport, the railway station or the bridges
over the Vistula. Hitler, shocked and angered by the failed bomb plot
against him a few days earlier, ordered his commanders back to the city to
suppress the rising ruthlessly.
Fighting street to street, and cellar to cellar even continued in the sewers
which formed the main lines of communication for the beleaguered AK while
German ground troops backed by heavy artillery, dive bombers and tanks
remorsely tightened the net. To this day the track of a German 'goliath'
mini-tank lies embedded in the rebuilt walls of St John's cathedral in the
heart of the old city where mass will be said on Sunday in memory of those,
soldiers and civilians, who took part.
The last hope flickered and died on September 18 when a daylight air-drop of
food and arms by allied bombers left 90 per cent of the aid in German hands.
The bombers were forced to fly to the limits of their range from bases in
Italy because Stalin refused to allow them to use airfields in
Soviet-occupied territory.
It was a telling omen of things to come, which the allies turned a
half-blind eye to, preoccupied as they were with breaking out from the
Normandy beachheads and unwilling to 'antagonise Uncle Joe', the man whose
Red Army had torn the guts out of Hitlers armies in the east,
But the Poles had embarked upon the rising harbouring no illusions. Their
aim was to liberate the Polish capital from the Nazis and 'to mobilise the
entire population spiritually for the struggle against Russia.'
For the Poles already knew what being 'liberated' by Soviet forces meant.
Five years earlier, in September 1939, Poland had been violated by Hitler
and Stalin together under the terms of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact.
Poles, and the large pre-war Jewish population in particular, suffered
terribly under Nazi rule. But for non-Jews, political and physical
repression by the Soviet secret police, the NKVD, in the Soviet-occupied
east of Poland was in many ways worse than that imposed by the Gestapo.
To the Nazis the Poles were simply Untermenschen whose ideas and culture
were of no interest. For Stalin's commissars, by contrast, Poland's
nationalist traditions and 'bourgeois' culture were a threat to be
eliminated. Hence the cold-blooded murder of thousands of captured Polish
officers in Katyn forest, near Smolensk. Hence the mass arrest of Polish
intellectuals, priests and teachers and their execution or deportation to
Siberia.
The AK's decision to fight for a 'Polish solution' to Poland's future was
'taken for the most honourable motives by men who had fought selflessly for
their country's independence against all comers,' writes Professor Davies.
But 'the idea that Warsaw could have been held by the AK in the name of the
government in exile without a subsequent showdown with the Soviets was
belied by all previous experience,' he adds.
So it proved. But the tradition of stubborn resistance to foreign occupation
embodied by Warsaw's defenders lived on to re-emerge a generation later in
the anti-Soviet Solidarity movement. The defeat of 50 years ago turned into
the victory of 1989 when Poland became the first of Moscow's satellite
states to throw off the Soviet shackles. In so doing Poles started the
process which liberated not only central Europe but permitted the
re-unification of Germany and the re-emergence of a Russia shorn of its
Soviet imperial arrogance. That is the final testament to an immense
sacrifice.

<TEXT>
   A monument depicting Austria's shame and
suffering in World War II was unveiled Thursday and served as a
somber reminder of Hitler's persecution of the Jews.
   More than 1,000 people gathered in and around Albertina Square
behind the Opera House for the inauguration of the monument by
sculptor Alfred Hrdlicka.
   The most controversial figure in one of several scenes depicted
is that of a Jew scrubbing the pavement.
   It recalls how the Nazis made Vienna Jews scrub streets clean of
anti-Nazi slogans with toothbrushes after Hitler annexed his native
Austria to Germany in 1938. Crowds of cheering Austrians often
looked on.
   Chief Rabbi Paul Chaim Eisenberg said the bronze figure would
remind Austrians of their past, which often is an uncomfortable
topic to the many who see themselves only as Hitler's victims.
   ``If you stand still, shaken, before this monument, then that can
be atonement for those who walked unmoved past the living Jews
washing the streets then,'' Eisenberg said.
   Thursday's ceremony was the last of many events this year
recalling the annexation and the attacks on Jews by Nazi thugs in
November 1938 that began the Holocaust.
   The anniversary has produced mixed emotions, reflecting Austria's
dual role as victim and accomplice of the Nazis.
   Controversy about President Kurt Waldheim's World War II service
as a German army officer has been an important element in the
observance and he played little part in the memorial events.
   Waldheim has been accused of committing war crimes while he was
an intelligence officer in the Balkans and denies the allegations.
   An international panel of historians determined that Waldheim was
in areas where atrocities were committed, knew of them and did
nothing to stop them. The historians said they found no direct
evidence that he committed crimes, but left the question of guilt
open.
   Erika Weinzierl, head of Austria's Action against Anti-Semitism
campaign, said Thursday the monument ``challenges us to remember the
darkest epoch of our history.''
   As she spoke, a few dozen people in the crowd chanted inaudible
slogans and knelt on the pavement, scrubbing it like the Jews of 50
years ago.
   They tossed leaflets into the crowd saying ``the Fuehrer has
gone,'' but anti-Semitism and persecution of other minorities
remains. Some of the dozens of policemen guarding Thursday's
ceremony were seen detaining at least two people.
   The monument, which will not be complete until next year, has a
``Gate of Violence'' opening on the figure of the crouching Jew.
Farther on, Orpheus arises from the underworld as a symbol of Art
overcoming the forces of darkness.
   Hundreds of Austrians lost their lives in a 1945 bombing raid on
a house that stood on the site of Albertina Square and their remains
are buried under the park-like, triangular area.
   It also has a pillar bearing pats of the declaration of
independence made by non-Nazi politicians April 27, 1945, just
before the war ended.
   Hrdlicka's monument cost about $900,000 and has been a subject of
argument since it was commissioned in 1983. Many conservative
politicians boycotted the ceremony, which was attended by Chancellor
Franz Vranitzky, Mayor Helmut Zilk and leaders of the small Jewish
community.

Belgian radio listeners awoke to the chilling sound of Adolf Hitler declaring
war on Poland, and Germans mourned their grim legacy to the world as Europeans
today marked the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Jews, Poles, Russians, Germans and others gathered for memorials across the
continent to remember the great conflict that began with the Nazi invasion of
Poland. The events conjured somber memories of bomb shelters and concentration
camps, of scrambled boundaries and splintered families.
</P>
<P>
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in a speech to Parliament, expressed sorrow
and regret for the "unspeakable suffering" wrought by the Nazis. He also tried
to assuage lingering German guilt.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that too many people in Germany and some abroad were blinded and
deceived by that tyrant," Kohl said of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
"Who among us can say with a good conscience that, confronted with such evil,
they would have summoned the strength to be martyrs? And who among us can judge
what it meant at that time to risk not only one's own life but the lives of
one's family as well?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
In Communist East Berlin, ailing leader Erich Honecker missed the memorial
ceremony in the 500-member People's Chamber, where Foreign Minister Oskar
Fischer delivered the main address.
</P>
<P>
Fischer called for a day of "recollection and sorrow" and said the East German
leaders pledge "to do everything in our power to ensure that war and fascism
never again threaten our lives and the lives of our children."
</P>
<P>
Poland's leaders marked the occasion with a symbolic show of unity by the
Communists and the Solidarity labor movement they once crushed.
</P>
<P>
Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and
former Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, now the prime minister, appeared
together at a small Polish garrison in Gdansk that bore the first Nazi
onslaught on Sept. 1, 1939.
</P>
<P>
"On this day of great national memories we look not only into the past but also
into the future," said Jaruzelski, flanked by two men he once jailed.
</P>
<P>
"Let this be an oath in this sacred place," Jaruzelski said, his voice
trembling. "Poland stood the toughest trial of war with honor. On this
exceptional day we have the moral right to address all nations and governments
of Europe. We want to have friends close to us, and far away" -- an obvious
reference to the Warsaw Pact nation's efforts to reach out to the West.
</P>
<P>
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, eager to keep Poland in the Soviet sphere
as that nation flirts with reform, said in a message to Jaruzelski: "The Polish
people and their army were the first to bear the brunt of Germany's powerful
military machine.
</P>
<P>
"These tragic events were actually prompted by the inability of the states
threatened by fascism and militarism to rally together and set up a collective
security system."
</P>
<P>
In Belgium, BRT state radio woke up listeners with a spine-tingling flash from
the past: a tape of Hitler declaring war on Poland on the same day he had
launched the first attacks. The frenzied fuehrer's incitements were followed by
the cheers of adoring Germans.
</P>
<P>
In London, about 200 people gathered at the St. Pancras railway station to
remember their evacuation to the countryside to escape Hitler's "blitzkrieg"
bombings.

<HL> Letters to the Editor: The 'Real Mob' in Eastern Europe </HL>

<TEXT>
   If I read Paul Johnson's "Irredentist Perils in Faltering Soviet Empire" (editorial page, Aug. 23) correctly, he and I share a cautious preference for the pre-World War I arrangement of Eastern Europe.
And he is clearly right to suggest that the Treaty of Versailles had left many questions unanswered, to say the least.
But I note with sadness that he accepted a 1938 Berlin propaganda line.
He singles out Czechoslovakia as one of the countries that "ill-treated their minorities, often more savagely than the old empires."
This resulted, Mr. Johnson argues, in German irredentism, which then led "directly to the Anschluss, Munich and the crisis over the 'Polish Corridor,' the immediate cause of World War II."

   I do not propose to argue the issue of Czechoslovakia's treatment of the Sudeten Germans.
But to explain the Anschluss, the tragic debacle of Western democracies and decency in international relations at Munich, and the outbreak of the war itself without a single reference to Hitler's explicit desire to start the war is at variance with available documents as well as common sense.

   Further, it is true that nationalism in Eastern Europe outlived Moscow's effort to replace it with communist internationalism, i.e., with whatever serves the interests of the Soviet leadership.
But Mr. Johnson is utterly wrong to argue that in 1968 "Leonid Brezhnev had no difficulty in getting the Poles, Hungarians and East Germans to cooperate gladly in the invasion of Czechoslovakia."
The three armies sent only token units that remained as invisible as they could, given that they had arrived in tanks.
If Mr. Johnson had looked into the eyes of the Polish, Hungarian and East German soldiers he would have found no "gladness" whatsoever.
On the other hand, the one Warsaw Pact army that did show some zeal for the mission designed for it by the Soviet marshals, the Bulgarian army, is strangely missing on Mr. Johnson's list.

   Finally, Mr. Johnson fears "the nationalist mob is once more making its appearance in the streets of Eastern Europe."
But that is nonsense.
Nowadays, nationalism in Warsaw, Prague, Berlin or Budapest is first and foremost a rejection of the rule by Soviet Party bureaucrats and the humiliating presence of Soviet troops.
Czechs, Poles, and Hungarians have demonstrated on many recent occasions an understanding of one another's lot.
This is true among the intellectuals and it is rapidly growing in other social stratas.
In the near future, Eastern Europeans are unlikely to produce nationalistic mobs.
Instead, they share my own feeling that the real mob in Eastern Europe is the one wearing the Red Army uniform.

<HEAD>Sanctions at Heart of Gulf War Question for Many</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   More than two dozen countries dispatched troops to the Middle
East after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The troops' first aim was
to block a possible assault on Saudi Arabia. But now many wonder
whether the U.S.-led coalition should strike first - and if so,
when and under what circumstances.
   The Associated Press put that question to eight people,
including a Vietnam veteran, the wife of a hostage and two former
Defense Department officials. Here are their answers:

Security Policy in Washington:

   They certainly shouldn't wait any longer. And I think that the
object of the attack should be to remove Saddam Hussein from
control and neutralize his ability to use weapons of mass
destruction. ...
   With each passing day, the likely costs and degree of difficulty
of an attack increase. That's because Saddam Hussein is trying to
make his forces more resilient, feverishly trying to bring to bear
more capable weapons systems. If this crisis should result in a
perpetuation of his power, we'll see those costs increase
exponentially because then he will have weapons far more dangerous
than those currently available to him.
   Meanwhile, it's unclear how long it will take before the
sanctions even get his attention. Saddam Hussein is nothing if not
indifferent to the condition of his people.
   In short, I think it's reasonably clear that neither the Iraqi
people nor the military are going to be sufficiently affected by
the sanctions between now and the closing of what's called the
``window of opportunity'' for an attack, namely the end of March or
so. ...
   Time is not on our side. Saddam Hussein is playing a waiting
game and thinks he can succeed at it.

   I think the best way to proceed is to try to negotiate a
settlement. The first issue that brought us there was the invasion
of Kuwait, and that's the primary issue. The primary issue is, as
far as I'm concerned, negotiable in terms of the withdrawal of
Iraqi forces.
   The escalation has come since we started talking about an
offensive straight through into Iraq. I'm not sure I understand the
reason for that except Saddam Hussein is a, quote, ``madman'' and
in four years they'll have the power to construct a nuclear bomb. I
don't necessarily get the connection between those two facts and an
incredible amount of blood shed by poor boys from Boston,
Dorchester and Roxbury.
   As someone who works with veterans, I see that right now the VA
is unable to handle the problems of an aging veteran population or
the problems of the Vietnam generation of veterans, issues of Agent
Orange and post-traumatic stress disorder. And many of the states
who are sending these National Guard units are closing their
programs for veterans.
   In Massachusetts, you have the case where they're discussing
closing the soldiers' homes and the outreach centers for
Vietnam-generation veterans. Here we're sending these guys off to
war and at the same time we're cutting back all the support systems
for people who have gone through our previous wars. That kind of
inconsistency is something that carries throughout the whole policy
and what we're doing in the Persian Gulf.

   I want to know what gives our president the power to decide that
on a certain date we're going to start a war. What gives him the
power in the month of November to say that in January we're going
to start a war?
   I think it's a horrifying thing to be doing. What frightens me
is that the decision is in the hands of people who are not actively
involved. In all of Congress, there are only two people who have a
family member in Saudi Arabia.
   (U.S. troops) went to Saudi Arabia to prevent an attack ... but
(now) President Bush is leading the pack into war.
   Everything is being drummed up to keep the flames of war
brightly lit. First we heard about the oil ... then we heard about
Saddam being an evil aggressor ... and now we're hearing about his
possible atomic capabilities.
   We should be over there in a defensive mode and, at this time,
nothing more. It should not be an American military offensive as a
presidential option but as an act of Congress, and the people
Congress is supposed to represent.

   We ought to give the sanctions time to work and we should only
attack if we are provoked by Iraq. We ought to let Saddam Hussein
know we are there until hell freezes over. In six months, his
aircraft will run out of spare parts and there will be other parts
shortages as well. So what if it takes us a year or two or three?
It took us 40 years to win the Cold War. ... I don't even think we
should be beefing up our force there. I'd probably get the
deployment down to 150,000 - 200,000 maximum in the area and
announce a rotation policy for the troops. ...
   If there were a provocation and you did have a war, I would bomb
his military facilities, the chemicals, the nuclear and his
munitions factories. I'd cut off his supply lines and I might pick
out one of his divisions in Kuwait and bomb the hell out of it too
and then say, ``OK, now get out or we'll bomb another division, and
then another.''

   ``They should not attack. History has taught us that when other
countries tolerate invasion such as Japan's invasion of China and
Germany's invasion of Poland, it can lead to world war. But now
with the development of missiles and nuclear weapons, the meaning
of war has changed. It may result in the total destruction of
mankind. ... Secondly, United Nations efforts and international
economic sanctions have made great progress. ... World opinion can
end Iraq's occupation.
