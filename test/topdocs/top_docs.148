FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget: Fuel and excise duty dismay for car owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTORISTS were hit yesterday by increases in both fuel duty and vehicle
excise duty.
The taxation of the private use of company cars will also rise significantly
in the next financial year.
The company car taxation system will be drastically reformed from 1994/95
through a system based on car list prices rather than on engine size. This
will mean increases in tax bills for a large minority of drivers but smaller
bills for more than half. Thereafter, individuals' own choice of cars will
determine the size of their tax liability.
The government warned yesterday that the cost of motoring is set to rise in
real terms every year. It intends to raise road fuel duties by at least 3
per cent a year in real terms in all future Budgets as an incentive for
motorists to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles.
The price of a gallon of unleaded petrol rose yesterday by 12p to around
Pounds 2.29, while that of a gallon of 4-star rose by 15p to around Pounds
2.52.
Duties on all road fuels, including diesel, rose by 10 per cent and the
vehicle excise duty on cars was raised by Pounds 15 to Pounds 125.
These raise by Pounds 50 the average cost of motoring for a driver covering
10,000 miles a year.
Company car users face a further 8 per cent increase this year in tax scale
charges, which the chancellor claimed would raise company car taxation 'to a
level which fully reflects the true value of the benefit of a company car.'
In spite of the increases, the motor industry gave a cautious welcome to the
Budget, but car retailers warned of the impact on new car sales of the
chancellor's determination to increase the cost of motoring in real terms in
every future Budget.
The Automobile Association said the government's motoring tax proposals were
'more highway robbery'.
'With one hand the chancellor has taken more from the motorist in excise
duty than he needs to replace new car tax; with the other, he has made all
motorists subsidise new cars, and done little to benefit the environment or
industry.'
Mr William Ebbert, chairman of Vauxhall, said: 'The increase in both fuel
tax and vehicle excise duty further increases the cost of motoring, but, on
balance, affects the cost of usage more than ownership, which is our
preferred option.'
Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, said that the reform of company car taxation was 'extremely
welcome'.
The Retail Motor Industry Federation said the company car tax reforms were
'sensible' and would 'produce a fairer and more transparent tax system than
previously'.
The Freight Transport Association claimed that industry's costs had risen by
at least Pounds 230m a year with the 10 per cent increase in the duty on
diesel. 'In real terms this increase in fuel duty will mean that the cost of
operating a 38 tonne truck will go up by about Pounds 1,000 a year,' it
said.

Imported cars dominate both the best and the worst categories in the annual
survey of automobile gasoline mileage released today by the Environmental
Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
Overall, auto makers made little gain in gasoline mileage in the 1990 model
year although the number of cars -- mostly expensive super-luxury imports --
that trigger the federal "gas guzzler" tax dropped from 40 car types to 30.
</P>
<P>
"There is no significant difference in the fuel economy of the top 10 1990
models compared to the top 10 1989 models. Likewise, overall fleet average fuel
economy of all cars and light trucks . . . projected to be about the same," the
EPA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Renewed Attention
</P>
<P>
Fuel economy has gained renewed attention in Congress because of concern over
autos' role in causing global warming and air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Auto emissions, especially carbon dioxide releases, are a direct contributor to
urban smog, which has caused more than 100 metropolitan areas to fail federal
air quality standards. Carbon dioxide also is a major cause of the so-called
"greenhouse effect" that scientists say is expected to cause a warming of Earth
in coming decades.
</P>
<P>
According to the EPA survey, the mileage leaders were largely foreign-made,
with the Japanese dominating that end of the list.
</P>
<P>
For the fifth straight year the fuel-stingiest car was the Japanese-made Geo
Metro, sold by Chevrolet, followed by the Honda Civic CRX, Suzuki Swift and
Daihatsu Charade. The Geo Metro XFI model had 53 miles per gallon in the city,
58 on the highway, and 55 overall, the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
No U.S.-made car made the top 10 list. The Ford Escort had the best mileage of
any domestic car with 32 miles per gallon in the city, 42 on the highway and 36
overall.
</P>
<P>
The car with the worst mileage was the Lamborghini Countach, which got only six
miles per gallon in the city and 10 on the highway. Rounding out the list of 10
cars with the worst gas mileage were four models of the Rolls Royce, the
Ferrari Testarossa, BMW 750IL, Porsche 928 S4, Audi V8 and Maserati 228.
</P>
<P>
According to the EPA survey, all but two of the 30 car models subject to the
gas guzzler tax are luxury imports. The exceptions are two Cadillac models, the
Allante and the larger engine (350 cubic inches) Brougham, which have combined
city and highway mileage of 18 and 17 miles per gallon, respectively. They had
the worst gas mileage of any domestic car.
</P>
<P>
Several Chrysler cars that made the guzzler list last year escaped because of
mileage improvements in 1990 models. These included the Chrysler TC by Maserati
and the Chrysler New Yorker and Dodge Dynasty, successor cars to other Chrysler
models that fell under the guzzler tax in 1989.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taxed European Models
</P>
<P>
European models that are subject to the tax come from Maserati, Rolls-Royce,
Porsche, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Volvo, Audi and BMW.
</P>
<P>
The excise tax amounts to a penalty of $500 to $3,850, with the amount
increasing as gasoline mileage declines. It was enacted in 1975 to encourage
people to buy more fuel-efficient cars.
</P>
<P>
Auto makers are required to have an average fuel economy of 27.5 miles per
gallon for their fleets. Last year officials in the Reagan Administration urged
Congress to eliminate the fleet requirements. But the Bush Administration,
citing environmental concerns, has urged auto makers to continue pursuing
increases in the fleet averages and efforts to rescind the standards have
fallen by the wayside.

   Japanese automakers are still producing the
most fuel-efficient cars _ tiny compacts getting up to 55 miles per
gallon _ while the list of ``gas guzzlers'' is dominated by
expensive, luxurious European models, government fuel economy
figures showed Monday.
   The vehicle mileage survey, based on industry and government
tests on all 1990 model cars, trucks and vans, showed little change
over the previous year, although the number of vehicles subject to
the ``guzzler'' tax dropped from 40 to 32.
   The tax, which can add $3,850 to the price of a car, kicks in on
automobiles that get overall fuel efficiency of less than 22.5 miles
per gallon.
   Bob Larson, branch manager of the EPA testing lab in Ann Arbor,
Mich., said that, overall, the nearly 1,000 models tested averaged
24 mpg gallon in combined city-highway driving.
   They ranged from the top-rated Geo Metro XFI, a small
Japanese-made car sold by General Motors, at a combined 55 mpg,
including 58 mpg on the highway, to the two-seater Lamborghini
Countach, which managed only 6 mpg in city driving and 10 mpg on the
highway.
   The mileage results are based on tests conducted by the
manufacturer under laboratory conditions, with about 30 percent of
the tests verified by the EPA. Larson said the EPA figures have been
adjusted from original laboratory results to more closely reflect
driving conditions. The reductions were 10 percent for city driving
and 22 percent for highway driving, he said.
   Larson said that while the figures, displayed on automobile
window stickers, are adjusted to reflect driving conditions, results
still can vary because of driving habits.
   The latest statistics come amid an increased clamor in Congress
and among enivronmentalists to push automakers into hiking the fuel
efficiency of their cars and trucks not only to save petroleum, but
also to curb the release of automobile pollutants.
   In releasing the mileage figures, the Environmental Protection
Agency said the most fuel efficient cars on the list emit about
one-third of a pound of carbon dioxide per mile traveled, while the
worst ``gas guzzler'' releases about twice that.
   Carbon dioxide is a chief contributor to the so-called
``greenhouse effect,'' which many scientists predict will lead to a
significant warming of the earth if not checked.
   Each of the top 10 cars with overall mileage rating of at least
39 mpg were made outside the United States, mostly in Japan. The
stingiest U.S.-made car was the Ford Escort with an overall mileage
of 38 mpg.
   The top 10 cars for the best mileage were three versions of the
Geo Metro, two versions of the Honda Civic CRX, three versions of
the Suzuki Swift, the Daihatsu Charade and the diesel-powered
Volkswagon Jetta.
   The Lamborghini was among six tested cars that are subject to the
maximum $3,850 excise tax for poor gas mileage. The others facing
the maximum tax are the Ferrari Testarossa and four Rolls-Royce
models.
   Rounding out the 10 worst mileage cars were the BMW 750IL, the
Porsche 928 S4, the Audi V8 and the Maserati 228.
   The only domestic cars subject to the ``gas guzzler'' tax were
two Cadillac models, the Allante and the larger engine (350 cubic
inches) Brougham, which have combined city and highway mileage of 18
and 17 mpg, respectively and a $500 tax surcharge.
   Several Chrysler cars that made the guzzler list last year
escaped because of mileage improvements in 1990 models. These
included the Chrysler TC by Maserati and the Chrysler New Yorker and
Dodge Dynasty, successor cars to other Chrysler models that fell
under the guzzler tax in 1989.
   Automakers are required to have an average fuel economy of 27.5
mpg for their fleets, but that reflects laboratory results for cars
actually sold and, therefore, is higher than the average fleet
figures calculated by the EPA for use on widow stickers.

<HL> Imports Again Top Fuel-Efficient List Of Cars, EPA Says </HL>

   Cars made overseas, but sold through U.S. dealerships, again topped the list of the 10 most fuel-efficient cars, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

   The 1989 Geo Metro, from General Motors Corp.'s imported-vehicle division, topped the list for best mileage, with 53 miles per gallon in the city, and 58 miles per gallon on the highway.
No cars manufactured in the U.S. were among the top 10.

   Although the EPA has reported the fuel-economy data since 1974, the information lacks the impact it did during periods of fuel shortages.
"It certainly isn't as big a factor as it was five or 10 years ago," said Dennis Sperduto, auto-industry analyst at Argus Research Corp., New York.
"It depends on the buyer.
Someone with money isn't going to care about fuel economy these days."

   Cars marketed as the Geo Metro is have altered the way the EPA breaks down the fuel-economy lists.
Because of the increasing number of auto lines that spring, as the Geo Metro does, from U.S.-foreign joint ventures, the EPA no longer bothers to compile its list of the most fuel-efficient U.S. cars.
"The EPA stopped producing one because of the increasing confusion over what a domestic car is," a spokesman said.
The Geo Metro is manufactured by Japan's Suzuki Motor Co.

   U.S. auto manufacturers must meet minimum fuel-economy standards, as set by an arm of the Department of Transportation, but U.S. cars are heading back to their gas-guzzling days.
General Motors, for example, has argued that Americans want to buy larger luxury models, and has asked the agency to relax the minimum standard to 26 miles per gallon from 27.5 miles per gallon for the average mileage of all the cars it sells.

   The fuel-economy estimates evolved from the EPA fuel-emission tests to measure pollution control.
Manufacturers submit their test data, and the EPA confirms about 30% of the results in its own laboratory.

   Other high-mileage cars listed by the EPA include the Honda Civic CRX HF, at 50 city and 56 highway miles per gallon; a Geo Metro Lsi at 46 city and 50 highway; a Honda Civic CRX IF at 45 city and 52 highway, a Ford Festiva at 39 city and 48 highway, and a Daihatsu Charade listed at 38 city and 42 highway.

   Taking honors for the worst fuel economy was an Aston Martin Lagonda with a 5.3-liter engine and an automatic transmission.
It gets eight miles per gallon in the city and 11 on the highway.

   For the first time in three years, Ford Motor Co. won't ask the federal government to relax its fuel economy standards for cars, the head of Ford's automotive operations said.

   "We are planning to meet the 27.5" miles-per-gallon corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standard for 1989-model cars, Philip E. Benton Jr., president of Ford Automotive Group, said yesterday after presenting a quality award to Ford's Monroe metal stamping plant.

   Ford will hit the 27.5 miles-per-gallon target by offering more efficient engines and by heavily promoting sales of its smaller cars, Mr. Benton said.
The more high-mileage small domestic cars like the Escort that Ford sells, the higher its company-wide average miles-per-gallon rating, under the federal rules.
Meeting the 27.5 fuel standard probably will mean "rebates for Escorts," a company spokesman said.

   Ford also will use credits it has banked by exceeding mileage standards in previous years to boost its fuel economy figures for 1989, if necessary, Mr. Benton said.

   For the past three model years, Ford has joined General Motors Corp. and a consortium of auto importers in asking the government to ease the so-called CAFE standards for cars.
In response to the auto makers' appeals, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration rolled back the target to 26 miles per gallon from 27.5 for the 1986, 1987 and 1988 model years.
Chrysler Corp. opposed those efforts.

   GM earlier this month asked the government to re-evaluate the 27.5 miles-per-gallon target for 1989 and 1990, saying it put full-line auto makers like GM at a disadvantage.

   The government can fine auto makers that fail to meet the higher fuel economy standard.
That issue came up earlier this month when a federal appeals court decision in Washington D.C. effectively overturned an effort by the Environmental Protection Agency to retroactively boost its estimates of the average gas mileage of Ford and GM cars for the 1980 to 1984 model years.

   But a Ford spokesman said the company doesn't expect to pay any fine in connection with that ruling.

require a fleet average of about 40 mpg by the turn of the century,
industry officials have said.

   Automakers are showing little or no gain in
fuel economy for the fifth straight year, with 1991 model cars
having on average as much thirst at the gas pumps as they did in
1987, the government reported today.
   The Environmental Protection Agency released the new fuel
economy figures as the Senate considered legislation that would
require sharp improvements in automobile fuel efficiency over the
next decade.
   According to the EPA's annual fuel economy statistics covering
about 1,000 cars, the 1991 models - both domestics and imports -
show an overall average of 28.1 miles per gallon, slightly better
than last year and identical to the fleet average in 1987.
   While the most miserly cars such as the minicompact Geo Metro
attain more than 50 mpg, more than half of the cars on the list
achieved no better than 22 mpg. The increasingly popular passenger
vans and specialty vehicles could on average do no better than the
high teens.
   The manufacturers want to ``sell bigger engines, more muscle and
acceleration which they call performance,'' said Joan Claybrook,
president of Public Citizen, a Washington-based consumer
organization, and a frequent critic of the automakers.
   Auto industry executives have pointed to the significant
improvements in fuel economy of cars since the 1970s, when the
fleet average was only about 14 mpg, and attribute the more recent
figures to consumer demand for larger and peppier cars.
   Similar views are found in automobile showrooms.
   ``It's not the industry pushing performance. It's the consumer
that's been demanding it in the last few years,'' said Ray Turk, a
salesman at a Nissan dealership in suburban Maryland.
   Janice Walsh was one of those consumers the other day as she
prepared to take a sporty Nissan 300ZX for a test spin, taking
little notice of its skimpy 18 mpg mileage rating for city driving.
``I like a car that's fun,'' she said.
   Down the road at another dealership, retiree John Webb and his
wife said the 17 mpg city driving estimate on a Mercury Marquis
didn't bother them. ``When we travel we want a good-sized car and
lots of trunk space,'' said Webb. ``We really haven't talked about
mileage.''
   The EPA noted that between the mid-1970s and early 1980s
significant gains were made in making automobiles more
fuel-efficient. ``Since 1982, however, the overall fleet fuel
economy figures have increased only slightly, partly because stable
oil prices reduced the demand for fuel-efficient vehicles.''
   Since 1987 the fleet-wide averages have been virtually at a
standstill. They were 28.1 mpg in 1987, 28.6 mpg in 1988, 28.1 mpg
in 1989 and 27.8 mpg in 1990.
   As in previous years, the 1991 figures showed a wide range of
gas mileage, from the minicompact Geo Metro that gets 58 mpg on the
highway and only a few miles less in the city to the luxurious
two-seater Lamborghini Diablo that gets 9 mpg on city streets.
   Four of the 10 best performing cars were variations of the Geo,
a Japanese-made minicompact that is sold through General Moors.
The others were two versions of the Honda Civic CRX, two varieties
of the Suzuki Swift, a Daihatsu Charade and a diesel-powered
Volkswagen Jetta. All get at least 37 mpg in the city and 42 mpg on
the highway.
   At the other extreme were the Lamborghini, five versions of the
Rolls-Royce, two Ferraris and two BMWs - none of which attained
more than 12 mpg in city driving and generally only slightly higher
on the highways.
   Even within various size categories the fuel efficiency of
different cars varied widely. As expected, small economy cars
generally showed much better fuel economy than expensive and
performance-leaning luxury models.
   The EPA listed only 35 cars subject to the so-called ``gas
guzzler'' tax, which in the case of the Lamborghini Diablo amounts
to $3,200. But those figures can be misleading.
   The guzzler tax, which kicks in if a car gets less than 22.5 mpg
in combined city and highway driving, is based on raw test results,
while the EPA figures are adjusted downward by a mathematical
formula so the mileage figures more closely reflect actual driving
conditions.
   Using the adjusted EPA figures, 393 of the 728 cars, specialty
vehicles and passenger vans on the list attained gas mileage of
less than 22.5 mpg. All but a handful of the nearly 300 trucks on
the list also failed to meet the 22.5 mpg figure.
   Trucks, passenger vans and specialty vehicles are not covered by
the tax, which is assessed only on cars based on a sliding scale
depending on miles per gallon.

   The top 10 fuel-efficient cars in the 1990 lineup are foreign-made, according to an Environmental Protection Agency report.
But foreigners are also turning out the biggest gas guzzlers.

   The 1990 Geo Metro XFI, a subcompact made in Japan by Suzuki for General Motors Corp.'s imported vehicle division, topped the high-mileage list by getting 53 miles per gallon in the city and 58 mpg on the highway.
It is the fourth year the GM import rated first place.

   Eight other Japanese-made models and one from West Germany filled out the list of top gas savers.

   The worst gas guzzler in the EPA's annual rating isn't for sale in the U.S. -- Chrysler Italian Imports' two-seat Italian-made Lamborghini Countach.
A 1990 model of the $155,000 sports car was tested by the EPA and got 6 mpg in city driving and 10 mpg on the highway, but the manufacturer says a replacement line will be introduced in the U.S. this year.

   That means the worst gas guzzler on the road will be the 1990 British-built Rolls-Royce Bentley Continental, a $200,000 handmade convertible that gets 10 mpg in the city and 13 mpg on the highway.

   The annual EPA report for the first time touted that fuel-efficient cars will save the global environment as well as gasoline.

   The EPA, which has been collecting fuel-efficiency data on pre-production vehicles since 1974 as it tests air-pollution equipment, estimated that each Lamborghini annually would emit 15 tons of carbon dioxide, one of the so-called greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.
The fuel-efficient Geo Metro would emit only about 2.2 tons a year.

   Auto makers for the 1990 model year are required to produce fleets with an average fuel efficiency of 27.5 mpg, stricter than that required over the past four years.

   Other high-mileage cars listed by the EPA were two additional models of the Geo Metro, two models of the Honda Civic CRX HF, three models of the Suzuki Swift, the Daihatsu Motor Co. Charade and a Volkswagen Jetta.
The range of mileage was from 37 to 49 mpg in the city, and 39 to 52 mpg on the highway.

<TEXT>     Fourteen freight cars eventually slammed into each other in a spectacular
accident that will keep Highway 101 closed into today or beyond as officials
clean up toxic chemicals and check an overpass the cars rammed.;
California's second serious train derailment in two weeks renewed calls for
better regulation of how toxic materials are shipped.;    "The train cars just
broke apart like over-ripe melons," said Terrence Gilday, Ventura County
environmental health manager. "We have drums of hazardous material all over
the place, and it's still releasing fumes. It's going to be a mess for a
while.";    Traffic jams caused by the closing of 10 miles of Highway 101, the
main coastal link between Northern and Southern California, continued Monday
with reports of some detoured motorists being delayed up to 12 hours. Some
reported feeling ill from the toxic cloud.;    Hazardous-material experts
wearing blue "space suit" protective gear tried Monday to neutralize at least
15 ruptured drums containing aqueous hydrazine, a component of rocket fuel.;
 Vacationing campers and hundreds of residents in the posh oceanfront
community of Seacliff remained evacuated Monday. Three people were treated for
nausea after breathing fumes from the spilled hydrazine.;    One of those who
complained was Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-San Rafael, who reported feeling "ill and
nauseous" after driving by the derailment site.;    Ironically, Boxer had
called for a congressional hearing Wednesday on train safety issues because of
the derailment two weeks ago in the Sacramento River headwaters.;    The
Seacliff accident was almost a repeat performance of July 14, when another
Southern Pacific derailment dumped poison into the river, killing all life in
a 40-mile stretch of one of Northern California's most pristine trout
streams.;    Less of a threat;  Officials said the Ventura County derailment
doesn't pose the same environmental threat.;    Investigators suspect that the
Sunday derailment was caused by a frozen wheel bearing that got so hot it
melted the axle. A wheel then fell off, and witnesses said the dragging
container car spewed sparks and threw gravel for miles.;    Ventura County
firefighters responded to some 30 spot fires left in the northbound train's
wake, from Camarillo almost to the Santa Barbara County line.;    But
apparently the engineer couldn't detect the problem from the front of the
39-car train, which was three-quarters of a mile long.;    Emergency crews
responding to the fires had difficulty contacting the train crew, Gilday said.
"It was a matter of the train being faster than communication.";    Train
workers blame the accident on the lack of a caboose, which Southern Pacific
began phasing out seven years ago in an attempt to reduce the number of crew
members required on each train.;    Supports caboose;  "No one can refute the
fact that if there had been a caboose on the train, the accident would have
been avoided," said J. P. Jones, legislative director of the United
Transportation Union.;    In place of staffed cabooses, Southern Pacific says
it has placed heat detectors at intervals along its tracks to sense overheated
wheels and sparks. The ill-fated train passed one sensor 36 miles before the
derailment, and there was no sign of a wheel problem, spokesman Bob Hoppe
said. The train derailed two miles before the next detector could have warned
the engineer of a problem, Hoppe said.;    Southern Pacific, criticized for
taking an hour to notify the state Office of Emergency Services after the
Sacramento River spill, took one hour and 40 minutes to call the OES on
Sunday. By that time, local fire and environmental safety officials had
already evacuated residents and campers.;    The train carried 76 55-gallon
drums of diluted hydrazine. A brief breath of the ammonia-like chemical can
cause nausea and burning eyes. Longer-term exposure can cause burns, damage
internal organs and ultimately result in death, said Jay Young, a chemical
health and safety consultant.;    'Wonderful tear gas';  "Basically, your red
blood cells go to pieces," Young said. "If that stuff is blowing over a
highway, the road should be closed. It would make a wonderful tear gas if it
weren't so deadly dangerous.";    The highway may not reopen until Wednesday,
depending on cleanup and an assessment of the Highway 101 overpass damaged in
the derailment. It is suspected that as the heavy freight cars tumbled
underneath the freeway, they weakened the bridge supports.;    A decision
won't be made until late today at the earliest, "but it will probably be
Wednesday," said Cornell Kimball of the California Department of
Transportation.;    The derailment disrupted passenger service on the main San
Francisco-Los Angeles route, and Amtrak bused passengers between Santa Barbara
and Los Angeles, spokesman Bruce Heard said. Six Amtrak trains ply the route
daily, with several hundred people on board each train. It was unknown when
service might resume.;    Patricia M. Eckert, president of the California
Public Utilities Commission, arrived at the Seacliff site Monday afternoon for
a briefing and said she was "extremely concerned" about the second toxic spill
in two weeks.;    Procedure probe;  The PUC is investigating whether Southern
Pacific was following proper procedure for transporting hazardous materials.;
  The emergency came virtually on the eve of Santa Barbara's annual Old
Spanish Days fiesta, which draws up to 100,000 visitors daily. The five-day
celebration starts Wednesday.;    "Right now, we are virtually marooned," said
a fiesta spokeswoman, Diana Vandervoort. "We depend on the tourists, and a lot
of our suppliers come from the Los Angeles area.;    "It may be just a local
community party this year."; DETOUR DATA; Information on the status of Highway
101 near the derailment site is available by calling (408) 436-1404.; WHY
LATEST SPILL WAS LESS DEVASTATING; The Sunday derailment in Ventura County was
bad -- but not as devastating as the Sacramento River spill two weeks ago.
Here's why:; (box)The Ventura spill occurred on land, contaminating only
soil.; (box)Emergency crews responded within minutes to the Ventura spill,
evacuating residents within one hour. Sacramento River residents were
evacuated 12 hours after the accident.; (box)Ventura County had an emergency
hazardous spill plan. Siskiyou County did not.; (box)Only about 800 gallons of
toxic chemical spilled Sunday. More than 13,000 gallons of a
herbicide/pesticide flowed into the Sacramento River.; (box)Hydrazine, the
chemical that spilled in Ventura County, is well-known and researched. Vapam,
the weed killer that went into the river, is little understood.; (box)The
train car carrying hydrazine was labeled hazardous. The tanker carrying Vapam
was not.  </TEXT>

   WASHINGTON -- Japanese auto companies once again crowded
U.S. manufacturers off the U.S. government's list of new cars
and new trucks with the highest gas mileage.
   In tests of coming 1992 models by the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Geo Metro XFi ranked as the most
fuel-efficient car for the sixth year in a row. The
three-cylinder subcompact, made by Suzuki Motor Co. and sold
by General Motors Corp., got 53 miles per gallon in city
driving and 58 mpg in highway driving.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Second place was earned by a version of the 1992 Honda
Civic Hatchback VX, sporting a new "lean-burn" technology
that uses less fuel per combustion stroke. It got 48 mpg in
the city and 55 mpg on the highway.
   The remainder of high-mileage autos on the list also are
Japanese imports, though some Honda Civics will be assembled
in Canada. The list names certain versions -- all with
five-speed manual transmission -- of the Geo Metro, Honda
Civic and Suzuki Swift, with fuel economy ratings that ranged
down to 39 mpg in the city and 43 mpg on the highway.
   The annual rankings come as U.S. auto makers are lobbying
the Senate to block a bill by Sen. Richard Bryan (D., Nev.)
that would require fleets of new cars to get an average of 40
mpg by model year 2001. The current standard is 27.5 mpg.
   Among light-duty trucks, a Suzuki Samurai Soft-Top 4WD
topped the fuel efficiency list. It gets 28 mpg in the city
and 29 mpg on the highway. Suzuki, Geo and Subaru trucks
filled out the list, with mileage ranging from 24 mpg to 28
mpg in the city and 27 mpg to 29 mpg on the highway.
   The car with the worst fuel economy on the road for 1992
will be the 12-cylinder Italian Lamborghini DB132/Diablo,
which gets only nine mpg in city driving and 14 mpg on the
highway and carries a stiff U.S. gas-guzzler tax of $6,400 a
vehicle. Congress this year doubled the amount of gas-guzzler
taxes, which are charged on any car getting less than 22.5
mpg.
   Three Dodge truck models took the honors for gas-guzzling
light-duty trucks, rating nine mpg in the city and 13 mpg on
the highway. Gas-guzzler taxes aren't charged on trucks.
   Comparison shoppers can find a complete list of
fuel-economy ratings for new cars in an EPA guide that is
expected to be available at dealerships in about two months.
In addition, mileage ratings are listed on window stickers of
new vehicles. The EPA has been ranking cars for fuel economy
since 1974.

a toxic rocket fuel component, dumped in a Ventura County train derailment
Sunday.;    Plans to begin pumping out the contents of 64 giant barrels of the

<TEXT>     The chemical spill has closed off 10 miles of Highway 101 near the
ocean-front community of Seacliff, between San Barbara and Los Angeles, with
detours taking travelers up to four hours, authorities said. Authorities now
say it will be sometime Thursday before the key north-south route reopens.;
Only eight of the 55-gallon drums containing the dangerous hydrazine liquid
were punctured when cars from a Southern Pacific freight keeled over and
crashed, Taylor said.;    But 64 drums received some kind of damage when they
toppled from a shipping container atop a flatcar, he said. The toxic materials
will have to be removed from the damaged containers, transferred to larger
barrels and resealed, Taylor said.;    When the toxic cleanup is complete,
CalTrans workers will be able to determine the amount of damage done to a
overpass pillar on Highway 101 struck by a boxcar in the derailment, Taylor
said.;    Weary fire crews;  Crews wearing blue "space suit" protective gear
worked until after midnight, setting up for today's operation, he said. It's
not known when the work will be finished.;    Weary fire crews from Ventura
and Oxnard County were to be given a break in cleanup efforts today, with
firefighters with toxic conduct expertise due in from Los Angeles and Santa
Barbara County, Taylor said.;    Fumes from the toxic hydrazine still hang
over the spill area, he said. Some 300 residents evacuated from Seacliff won't
be able to return home until the full cleanup is completed, Taylor said.;
The derailed SP train threw sparks for 20 miles and started more than 30 fires
before the derailment.;    14 freight cars involved;  But no one aboard

engineer couldn't detect the problem from the front of the 39-car train, which
was three-quarters of a mile long.;    Emergency crews responding to the fires
had difficulty contacting the train crew, Gilday said. "It was a matter of the
train being faster than communication.";    Train workers blame the accident
on the lack of a caboose, which Southern Pacific began phasing out seven years
ago in an attempt to reduce the number of crew members required on each
train.;    "No one can refute the fact that if there had been a caboose on the
train, the accident would have been avoided," said J. P. Jones, legislative
director of the United Transportation Union.;    In place of staffed cabooses,
Southern Pacific says it has placed heat detectors at intervals along its
tracks to sense overheated wheels and sparks. The ill-fated train passed one
sensor 36 miles before the derailment, and there was no sign of a wheel
problem, spokesman Bob Hoppe said. The train derailed two miles before the
next detector could have warned the engineer of a problem, Hoppe said.;
Southern Pacific, criticized for taking an hour to notify the state Office of
Emergency Services after the Sacramento River spill, took one hour and 40
minutes to call the OES on Sunday. By that time, local fire and environmental
safety officials had already evacuated residents and campers.;    The train
carried 76 55-gallon drums of diluted hydrazine. A brief breath of the
ammonia-like chemical can cause nausea and burning eyes. Longer-term exposure
can cause burns, damage internal organs and ultimately result in death, said
Jay Young, a chemical health and safety consultant.;    "Basically, your red
blood cells go to pieces," Young said. "If that stuff is blowing over a
highway, the road should be closed. It would make a wonderful tear gas if it
weren't so deadly dangerous.";    The highway may not reopen until Wednesday,
depending on cleanup and an assessment of the Highway 101 overpass damaged in
the derailment. It is suspected that as the heavy freight cars tumbled
underneath the freeway, they weakened the bridge supports.;    A decision
won't be made until late today at the earliest, "but it will probably be
Wednesday," said Cornell Kimball of the California Department of
Transportation.;    The derailment disrupted passenger service on the main San
Francisco-Los Angeles route, and Amtrak bused passengers between Santa Barbara
and Los Angeles, spokesman Bruce Heard said. Six Amtrak trains ply the route
daily, with several hundred people on board each train. It was unknown when
service might resume.;    Patricia M. Eckert, president of the California
Public Utilities Commission, arrived at the Seacliff site Monday afternoon for
a briefing and said she was "extremely concerned" about the second toxic spill
in two weeks.;    The PUC is investigating whether Southern Pacific was
following proper procedure for transporting hazardous materials.;    The
emergency came virtually on the eve of Santa Barbara's annual Old Spanish Days
fiesta, which draws up to 100,000 visitors daily.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>More `Hang-the-Expense' Cars in 1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European automakers must think this is the
year for you to take the plunge on that sports car with enough
horsepower to achieve Earth orbit or on the luxury barge with
faucets for red and white wine in the back seat.
   They're offering more models than ever before, 40, that get
caught by the U.S. ``gas-guzzler'' excise tax, according to the
annual fuel economy ratings released by the Environmental
Protection Agency on Thursday for 1989 models.
   Five cars bearing U.S. names are also taxed. Two of them are
largely made in Europe and are aimed at the same hang-the-expense
market segment that the Europeans are going after. The other three
are the only entirely U.S. models ever to pay the tax, which they
also paid in 1987 but escaped last year.
   As usual, the Japanese are the mileage champs. For the fourth
straight year the fuel-stingiest cars are the Japanese-made Geo
Metro, formerly the Chevrolet Sprint, and the two-seater Honda
Civic CRX HF.
   The Metro's mileage was 53 miles per gallon in the city, 1 mpg
below last year's figure for the same car, and 58 on the highway
test, the same as last year. Geo is the new nameplate General
Motors Corp. is putting on the imports of its Chevrolet division.
   The Civic's figures are identical to last year's: 50 mpg city,
56 mpg highway.
   The gas-guzzler tax, unique to the United States, assesses a
penalty in the form of an excise that rises with declining fuel
economy. It starts at $500 and goes up to $3,850. It was enacted in
1975, when fears of fuel shortages were rampant, and aimed at
discouraging the unthrifty.
   In all, 45 models _ some of them identical except for trim _ are
official gas-guzzlers. Last year's list included only 24, and the
year before that the count was only 18.
   This year's includes five Rolls-Royces that escaped in previous
years through a now-closed loophole that exempted cars of more than
6,000 pounds gross vehicle weight.
   European models that will pay the tax come from Rolls and its
Bentley badge, plus Maserati, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche,
Aston-Martin, Jaguar, Volvo and BMW.
   The proliferation of guzzlers reflects a growing desire for
performance and status, analysts say.
   ``Around here it's almost a status symbol to have paid a $3,000
penalty tax,'' commented Garrett Stasse, auto editor of The
Register in Shrewsbury, N.J., in affluent Monmouth County.
   ``If you have a car in your lineup that does not live up to its
performance image, you're in more trouble today than if you have an
official gas-guzzler,'' said Ed Miller, a senior editor at Ward's
Automotive Publications in Detroit.
   Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety in
Washington, an advocacy group that frequently has opposed
relaxation of government fuel standards, said: ``We are going in
the wrong direction. We ought to be headed the other way and making
gas-sippers.''
   But manufacturers, he said, ``think they'll make more in profits
than they pay in penalties.''
   ``The tax really isn't objected to by the buyer'' of luxury
cars, said Kyle Johnson of GM's Cadillac division. ``It does not
alter GM's commitment to stay away from the gas-guzzler tax on
U.S.-built cars.''
   Johnson was commenting on the Cadillac Allante, a $50,000-plus
two-seater introduced last year to compete against the upscale
Europeans. A larger engine this year brought it under the tax with
a rating of 15 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the highway, adding
$650 to the sticker price.
   The other taxed U.S. entry is one model of the Chrysler TC by
Maserati, which had readings of 17 and 21. Other TC models escape
the tax, but not the one with the turbocharged 2.5-liter engine
(152 cubic inches) without the top-gear lockup feature on the
three-speed automatic.
   This car is built in Italy using many U.S.-supplied components.
The Cadillac Allante is built in the United States using an Italian
body.
   The other U.S. gas-guzzlers are the Chrysler Fifth Avenue and
its identical twins, the Dodge Diplomat and the Plymouth Grand
Fury. They get 16 mpg in the city and 23 mpg out of town, according
to EPA, compared with 17-23 last year and 16-21 in 1987.
   Repeat tests of the same car can yield slightly differing
results. ``The car has not changed,'' said Tony Cervone, a Chrysler
spokesman.
   The Fifth Avenue family is in its last year. Successors were
introduced last year: the Chrysler New Yorker and Dodge Dynasty,
rated at 18 mpg city and 26 mpg highway for 1989.
   In all, Japanese and Korean manufacturers captured the top 10
spots, as they did last year. Because Japanese-owned plants in the
United States and in Japan have in the past supplied the same cars
to the U.S. market simultaneously, EPA no longer lists the top
domestic models. But the top U.S.-manufactured car from a Big Three
company appears to be a Ford Escort recorded at 32-42.
   The biggest guzzlers this year are four Aston-Martin sports cars
new to the United States, all 8-11 and carrying the top penalty of
$3,850.

   The U.S. secretary of transportation said he wants a relaxation of congressionally mandated fuel-economy standards for cars, a move that would clear the way for auto makers to sell bigger cars and earn larger profits.

   Calling current fuel-economy rules "a dinosaur that should be extinct," the official, James Burnley, sided with the auto industry in the battle over efforts to require improved gas mileage.

   Mr. Burnley said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposes to lower the federal gas-mileage target for 1989 and 1990 model cars, possibly to as low as 26.5 miles a gallon.
The current target is an average of 27.5 miles a gallon for each car maker's fleet.

   Under current rules, an auto maker that fails to meet the target could be fined as much as $5 a car for every one-tenth of a mile that its fleet's average falls below the mileage target.
In other words, if a car maker missed the standard by one-tenth of a mile and sold 3.5 million cars, it could be fined $17.5 million.

   In a statement, Mr. Burnley linked the target-lowering proposal, made in response to a petition for relief filed by General Motors Corp., to the preservation of jobs.
GM, the largest auto maker, says it couldn't meet the 1989 target without significant layoffs and production cuts.
A group of foreign auto makers also petitioned for relief.

   "I want to make very sure that we're not putting U.S. jobs at risk over the next two years," Mr. Burnley said.

   Advocates of tougher fuel-economy regulation denounced the proposed relaxation.

   "When we need to decrease consumption of fossil fuels to reduce carbon dioxide and the 'greenhouse effect,' we need to be headed toward doubling fuel economy standards, not rolling them back," said Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Washington-based Center for Auto Safety.
The center has filed suits challenging earlier Transportation Department orders that relaxed the fuel-economy standards for the 1986, 1987 and 1988 model years.

   The latest round in the years-long debate over fuel economy comes as GM and Ford Motor Co., the second largest U.S. auto maker, are scrambling to meet a surge in demand for their larger models.
Selling more of these cars would mean bigger profits.
It also would mean missing the fuel-economy standard.

   Ford has said it could meet the current standard for 1989 cars only by introducing major sales incentives on its smaller models.
This is because customers "are asking for bigger cars," a Ford spokeswoman said.

   GM, meanwhile, wants to build larger cars to help reverse a slide in market share that followed its decision to reduce the size of its luxury models.
That move was part of GM's effort to meet fuel-economy standards in the early 1980s.
The company has predicted that the average fuel efficiency of its 1990 model cars will drop to 26.8 miles a gallon from its current 27.3 miles.

   Chrysler Corp., meanwhile, apparently has decided not to oppose GM's petition for relief, though it has done so in the past.
Chrysler, a spokesman said, already meets the mileage target.
"It's not an issue," he said.

   The highway traffic safety agency has scheduled a hearing on its gas-mileage proposal for Sept. 14.
The agency is also seeking public comment on the proposed change for the 1989 model year until Sept. 15.

<TEXT>     The Ford Escort LX wagon body is topping a reliable Mazda Protege
front-wheel-drive chassis. Escort styling reflects the aerodynamic style of
the successful Ford Taurus -- Escort's been dubbed a "baby Taurus" by some --
and combines the small size of the Escort with the extra space of a station
wagon.;   The Escort is powered by Ford's 1.9-liter, four-cylinder engine that
delivers 88 horsepower but feels much stronger. It carries a fuel-economy
rating of 25 miles per gallon in the city and 33 miles per gallon on the
highway. The Escort price is as attractive as its styling. A basic Escort LX
Wagon has a base price of less than $10,000. Fully equipped, it's still under
$12,000.;   Honda Accord;   Despite its foreign roots, the Accord station
wagon is built in Marysville, Ohio, and many of them are actually exported to
Japan -- where they're considered a status symbol. The Accord sedan is the
most popular car in America and Honda is waiting for its two Accord wagon
models, the well-equipped DX and more luxurious LX, to catch on with the same
intensity. There are two variations of the 2.2-liter, four-cylinder engine.
The "base-level" delivers 125 horsepower, and there's the more powerful and
slightly more expensive 140-horsepower version. Test drive both models and see
which version best suits your needs.;   The Accord wagon offers safety and
convenience -- it's the first Accord to offer a driver's-side air bag and the
wagon's tailgate extends all the way down to the rear bumper. When it's open,
this provides a low "lift-over" height for easy cargo loading. The price
ranges from $17,400 to $20,000, but this model even has air conditioning as
standard equipment.;   Subaru Legacy;   The Subaru is built in a plant shared
with Isuzu in Lafayette, Ind. Subaru has a strong reputation for building
durable, all-wheel-drive station wagons and the Legacy continues this
tradition. The wagon is available with either front-wheel drive, suitable for
everyday driving situations, or all-wheel drive, when extra traction is needed
in inclement weather.;   Power is supplied by a 2.2-liter, four-cylinder
engine rated at 130 horsepower. EPA fuel economy is 20 miles per gallon in the
city and 26 miles per gallon on the highway. Weighing in at just over 3,000
pounds, the Legacy wagon is very sure-footed, corners well and holds the road,
even in slippery conditions.;   Subaru cars have a reputation for styling
that's definitely out of the mainstream, but they are also noted for being
well-constructed and a good value. Prices for the all-wheel-drive version of
the Subaru Legacy station wagon range from $15,000 to $20,000 for the
top-of-the-line LSi model.;   Ford Taurus/Mercury Sable;   For the first time
in its '92 models, Ford has made the V-6 engine standard. The base engine is a
3.0-liter V-6, but we think you should also test drive the larger, more
powerful 3.8-liter V-6. We also recommend the optional anti-lock brakes. A
driver's-side air bag has been standard since the 1990 model year.;   Although
Ford has been able to showcase its expertise with electronic instrument
panels, you should also consider the more familiar and more readable analog
instruments. The Taurus and Sable wagons offer good size and value for a
reasonable price -- starting at $15,000 and moving up to about $20,000
depending on optional equipment.;   Buick Roadmaster; Estate Wagon;
Measuring more than 18 feet long and weighing in at a hefty 4,500 pounds,
Buick's Roadmaster Estate Wagon is the largest passenger car made in America.
It's an updated version of a traditional American station wagon and even has
the traditional rear-facing third seat made popular in the classic station
wagons of the '50s and '60s.;   This land yacht is powered by GM's 5.7-liter,
V-8 engine that has been updated with fuel injection for improved fuel
economy. It manages to deliver 16 miles per gallon in the city and 25 miles
per gallon on the highway.;   This is a luxury cruiser with real towing
ability. Anti-lock brakes are standard along with a driver's-side air bag.
Prices range from $23,000 to $25,000, depending on options.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>The Fuel Economy Debate: It Cloaks a Welter of Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's automakers, their regulators and
their critics agree on this: There is more to fuel economy than
saving gasoline.
   On a single mile per gallon, to hear the interested parties tell
it, hangs the U.S. trade balance, the ability of the domestic auto
industry to compete, the nation's energy independence, thousands of
highway traffic deaths, even the capacity of the Earth's climate to
support humankind.
   A welter of comment offered at hearings this past week lead to
those assorted conclusions. It now falls to the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration to weigh those competing interests
and issue a decision on where fuel consumption standards ought to
be set in the future.
   In many respects, fuel economy is a 1970s issue hitching a ride
on the concerns of the 1980s and the 1990s.
   Beginning in 1972, oil producing nations, mainly in the Middle
East, raised oil prices dramatically. Congress in 1975 responded
with legislation to reduce the nation's reliance on foreign oil by
forcing Detroit to build more fuel-efficient cars.
   The law phased in a minimum gas mileage each manufacturer on
average must attain. The corporate average fuel economy _ shortened
to CAFE and pronounced like a small eatery _ is calculated on the
basis of gallons of gasoline used by a maker's domestic car
production over the estimated life of the vehicles.
   The CAFE standard in 1985 reached 27.5 mpg. The next year it was
lowered to 26 mpg by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration after some of the automakers argued that, for
technological and commercial reasons, they could not meet the
stricter standard.
   The standard was scheduled to revert to 27.5 mpg with the 1989
model year. NHTSA in August proposed setting the CAFE standard
through 1990 somewhere between 26.5 mpg and 27.5 mpg.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. oppose setting the
standard at the higher end of the range. They said they could live
with a 26.5 mpg standard, but the question is one of trade and jobs.
   To meet a 27.5 mpg CAFE standard, the two largest U.S.
automakers said they would have to restrict production of large
cars.
   The result, they said, would be layoffs at large-car assembly
plants. The job losses would cascade through the manufacturers'
suppliers and into the general economy, ultimately numbering in the
hundreds of thousands.
   Analysts buy the argument that the stricter fuel-economy
standard would pinch GM and Ford.
   ``I think you would have more problems, because Americans want
to buy horsepower and big cars,'' said David Healy, an analyst with
the New York brokerage house Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``It
probably wouldn't be a disaster; it would be more of a pain for the
companies than it is now.''
   A pain for GM and Ford would be a boon for the foreign
automakers, particularly the Japanese, and detrimental to the U.S.
balance of trade, both the automakers and analysts said.
   Large and luxury cars accounted for about 19 percent of the 5.2
million domestic cars sold in the United States this year through
August, according to industry reports.
   All but one of those models were made by GM and Ford. Chrysler
makes one big car. Most imported cars are smaller vehicles.
   Even if the U.S. makers restricted big-car production, they
would still make some of the high-profit vehicles, thereby diluting
the average gas mileage of their fleets.
   To offset that production, ``they have to have a lower
performance (small) car than the importers, because the importers
don't have to balance their small cars aginst the higher fuel-usage
cars,'' said Thomas O'Grady, president of Integrated Automotive
Resources Inc. of Wayne, Pa.
   Therefore, even buyers of small cars would tend to gravitate to
higher-performance imported vehicles.
   Against that bread-and-butter question lie other issues, some
divorced from the orginal conservation intent of the law.
   Some want CAFE loosened to lower the highway death toll. The
Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market advocacy group,
argued that setting the standard at 27.5 mpg would lead to between
2,200 and 3,900 additional deaths over the life of 1989 cars
because people are more likely to be killed in crashes involving
smaller vehicles.
   Others want the mileage standards tightened in order to protect
the environment. The Energy Conservation Coalition, a group of 20
environmental and conservation grups, argued that loosening the
CAFE standard, by putting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,
would accelerate the greenhouse effect, a warming of the atmosphere
caused by a trapping of the sun's heat, with disastrous effects for
world's food-growing ability in the next century.
   The Department of Transportation, GM and others point to
gasoline prices averaging 97 cents per gallon, far lower than
forecast during the height of the oil crunch, and say the law has
outlived its original intent and should be scrapped.
   Still others, such as the Center for Auto Safety, a consumers
group often critical of the auto industry and its regulators, say
the conservation issue is still important, with oil imports
standing at 38.1 percent this year, against 36.8 percent when the
CAFE law was passed. A new energy crisis, they argue, is something
for which the nation should be prepared.
   The CAFE decision, the conflicting comment suggests, is a
question of public priorities, a balance between the economic
health of the auto industry and broader political, safety and
environmental concerns. A ruling is expected within a few weeks.

'90 JAPANESE CARS AGAIN TOP EPA MILEAGE LIST

<P>
Japanese auto makers are still producing the most fuel-efficient cars -- tiny
compacts getting up to 55 miles per gallon -- while the list of "gas guzzlers"
is dominated by expensive, luxurious European models, government fuel economy
figures showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle mileage survey, based on industry and government tests on all 1990
model cars, trucks and vans, showed little change over the previous year,
although the number of vehicles subject to the gas-guzzler tax dropped to 32
from 40.
</P>
<P>
The tax, which can add $3,850 to the price of a car, kicks in on automobiles
that get overall fuel efficiency of less than 22.5 m.p.g.
</P>
<P>
Bob Larson, branch manager of the EPA testing lab in Ann Arbor, Mich., said
that overall the nearly 1,000 models tested averaged 24 m.p.g. in combined
city-highway driving.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Push for More
</P>
<P>
They ranged from the top-rated Geo Metro XFI, a small Japanese-made car sold by
General Motors, at a combined 55 m.p.g., including 58 m.p.g. on the highway, to
the two-seater Lamborghini Countach, which managed only 6 m.p.g. in city
driving and 10 m.p.g. on the highway.
</P>
<P>
The mileage results are based on tests conducted by the manufacturer under
laboratory conditions, with about 30% of the tests verified by the EPA. Larson
said the EPA figures have been adjusted from original laboratory results to
more closely reflect driving conditions. The reductions were 10% for city
driving and 22% for highway driving, he said.
</P>
<P>
Larson said that although the figures, displayed on automobile window stickers,
are adjusted to reflect driving conditions, results still can vary because of
driving habits.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics come amid an increased clamor in Congress and among
environmentalists to push auto makers into hiking the fuel efficiency of their
cars and trucks not only to save petroleum but also to curb the release of
automobile pollutants.
</P>
<P>
In releasing the mileage figures, the Environmental Protection Agency said the
most fuel-efficient cars on the list emit about one-third of a pound of carbon
dioxide per mile traveled, while the worst gas guzzler releases about twice
that.
</P>
<P>
Carbon dioxide is a chief contributor to the so-called greenhouse effect, which
many scientists predict will lead to a significant warming of the Earth if not
checked.
</P>
<P>
Each of the top 10 cars with an overall mileage rating of at least 39 m.p.g.
was made outside the United States, mostly in Japan. The stingiest U.S.-made
car was the Ford Escort, with an overall mileage rating of 38 m.p.g.
</P>
<P>
The top 10 cars with the best mileage per gallon were three versions of the Geo
Metro, two versions of the Honda Civic CRX, three versions of the Suzuki Swift,
the Daihatsu Charade and the diesel-powered Volkswagen Jetta.

The Lamborghini was among six cars tested that are subject to the maximum
$3,850 excise tax for poor gas mileage. The others facing the maximum tax are
the Ferrari Testarossa and four Rolls-Royce models.
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the 10 worst mileage cars were the BMW 750IL, the Porsche 928 S4,
the Audi V8 and the Maserati 228.
</P>
<P>
The only domestic cars subject to the gas-guzzler tax were two Cadillac models,
the Allante and the larger engine (350 cubic inches) Brougham, which have
combined city and highway mileage of 18 and 17 m.p.g., respectively, and a $500
tax surcharge.
</P>
<P>
Several Chrysler cars that made the guzzler list last year escaped because of
mileage improvements in 1990 models. These included the Chrysler TC by Maserati
and the Chrysler New Yorker and Dodge Dynasty, successor cars to other Chrysler
models that fell under the guzzler tax in 1989.

   DETROIT -- The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the resulting
jump in gasoline prices couldn't have come at a worse time
for car makers, particularly the Big Three.
   The sudden return of recession fears, oil embargo threats
and accelerating gasoline prices is catching product planners
at American and Japanese auto makers leaning the wrong way --
toward bigger, more powerful and less fuel-efficient cars and
trucks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Detroit's cars are far more efficient than the gas
guzzlers of a decade ago, but Japanese auto makers still have
the edge if American consumers become mileage-conscious
again.
   Japanese car makers have the advantage not just in raw
miles-per-gallon numbers. They also have used their lead in
small engine technology to develop four-cylinder cars that
have the pep of an American six-cylinder. In short, they can
offer consumers more models that blend economy and
performance.
   What's more, Japanese car companies have quicker product
cycles than their U.S. rivals and thus could respond faster
to market changes or renewed regulatory pressure to cut
reliance on imported oil by raising fuel economy standards,
industry analysts say.
   "Everybody is in better shape than 10 years ago," says
analyst Christopher Cedergren of J.D. Power &amp; Associates, a
market research firm. "But the Japanese still are in better
shape than the American manufacturers."
   A slowdown in the U.S. economy also could give Japanese
car makers an even larger share of the U.S. market. "You'd
not only have a decline in total vehicle sales but you'd have
a bias toward smaller cars," said David Healy, an analyst
with Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
   A shift toward smaller cars could be particularly damaging
to General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., which derive much
of their profits from big cars. GM and Ford each spent
millions of dollars recently to restyle their large,
low-mileage, rear-wheel drive cars so they could remain
competitive -- and add to the corporate bottom line -- well
into the 1990s.
   Although gasoline prices surged after last week's invasion
of Kuwait by Iraq, it is still unclear what longer-term
impact the gulf crisis will have on prices and supplies. But
whatever happens, policy makers, already concerned about the
high use of imported oil, will have a stronger argument to
demand tougher automobile fuel economy standards.
   The car industry has been backsliding on fuel economy for
the past two years. After greatly improving between 1975 and
1988, the mileage of the average car dropped to 27.8 miles
per gallon in the current model year from 28.6 miles per
gallon in 1988, according to a study by the federal
Environmental Protection Agency.
   Japanese car makers accounted for much of that drop, the
EPA found. A decade ago, Japanese manufacturers sold almost
entirely small, fuel-sipping economy cars. But now, Honda
Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Corp. and some of
the smaller Japanese companies all are offering larger, more
powerful models in an effort to push into the mainstream of
the U.S. market.
   Nissan and Toyota unveiled luxury cars this past fall with
V-8 engines more powerful than any offered by Cadillac or
Lincoln. Toyota's 250-horsepower Lexus LS 400 gets 18 miles
to the gallon in city driving. That's only slightly better
than the 17 miles to the gallon achieved by the larger
Lincoln Town Car.
   But while the Japanese were pushing into the larger car
market, they also continued to refine their four-cylinder
engine technology.
   Consider the Toyota Camry and the Ford Taurus. The Camry's
four-cylinder base engine has 115 horsepower and delivers 26
miles per gallon in city driving. The Taurus's four-cylinder
base engine has a mere 90 horsepower and delivers only 20
miles per gallon in the city.
   U.S. auto makers have concentrated most of their new
product development efforts on building better six- and
eight-cylinder engines, says Mr. Cedergren.
   To be sure, Detroit has some products it could throw into
the breach. GM has a multi-valve, four-cylinder engine
similar to those found on many Japanese cars. And late this
fall, the No. 1 auto maker is scheduled to launch its new
Saturn line of compact cars that are expected to match
Japanese levels of performance and fuel economy.
   Ford, meanwhile, recently unveiled the new Ford Escort, a
subcompact jointly engineered with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp.
The high-mileage Escort has had disappointing sales, but that
could change if gasoline prices continue to rise.
   Chrysler Corp. continues to offer many cars powered by
four-cylinder engines. But the company's fortunes hinge in
large part on its minivans, most of which are powered by V-6
engines and get relatively low mileage.
   Even if the Persian Gulf quiets down in the next few
weeks, Detroit may still have reason to worry. Congress isn't
likely to act in this session to boost fuel economy
standards, but the sudden focus on the country's dependence
on foreign oil could ease the way for tougher regulation.
   Says top Chrysler lobbyist Robert Liberatore: "I could see
this whole mess in the Middle East raising the hue and cry
for conservation."

   The gas-guzzlers are back.
   The Environmental Protection Agency's annual survey of auto
gasoline mileage released Thursday shows more models than ever
paying the special gas-guzzler tax on fuel-hungry cars, most of
them expensive European luxury models.
   The mileage champs are unchanged for the fourth straight year.
The top two cars are again Japanese: a General Motors Corp. import
and a Honda.
   In the luxury gas-guzzler category for the first time are two
cars bearing American nameplates, the Cadillac Allante and the
Chrysler TC by Maserati. Both have heavy Italian input _ the
Cadillac's body and more than half the car by value is imported
from Italy and the Chrysler is assembled in Italy using many
U.S-supplied components.
   These are not the first U.S. cars to pay the tax. Chrysler
Corp.'s venerable Chrysler Fifth Avenue and its nearly identical
siblings, the Dodge Diplomat and the Plymouth Fury, were taxed in
the 1987 model year. They return to official guzzler status for
1989, the last year of their production run, after a year with
mileage ratings good enough to take them off the list.
   Many analysts have noted buyer indifference to fuel economy in
recent years of stable or declining gasoline prices.
   The new models, though, reflect an increasing concern with high
performance, according to one observer.
   ``If you have a car in your lineup that does not live up to its
performance image, you're in more trouble today than if you have an
official gas-guzzler,'' said Ed Miller, a senior editor at Ward's
Automotive Publications in Detroit.
   Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety in
Washington, an advocacy group that has frequently opposed
relaxation of government fuel standards, said: ``We are going in
the wrong direction. We ought to be headed the other way and making
gas-sippers.''
   But manufacturers, he said, ``think they'll make more in profits
than they pay in penalties.''
   ``The tax really isn't objected to by the buyer'' of such
luxurious chariots, said Kyle Johnson of GM's Cadillac Division.
``It does not alter GM's commitment to stay away from the
gas-guzzler tax on U.S.-built cars.''
   The guzzlers are proliferating. For 1987, 18 models paid the
tax. Last year, 24 models were taxed. This year 45 models are
assessed, counting five Rolls-Royces that escaped previously
because their gross vehicle weight exceeded 6,000 pounds, the
cutoff specified by the law. The 1986 tax law changes closed that
loophole.
   Other manufacturers with models subject to the tax are Maserati
under its own name, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Aston-Martin,
Jaguar, Volvo and BMW.
   The Geo Metro recorded 53 miles per gallon in the city and 58
mpg on the highway. Geo is the new nameplate from General Motors
Corp. for the various imports of its Chevrolet Division. The Metro,
built by GM's Suzuki Motors affiliate, was sold in previous years
as the Chevrolet Sprint.
   Second place went to the two-seater Honda Civic CRX HF, also for
the fourth year in a row, at 50 mpg city, 56 highway.
   Last year's ratings for the two cars were the same, with the
exception that the Sprint recorded 54 mpg in city traffic.
   Engineers say repeat tests can yield different numbers, and this
variability is probably what happened to the Fifth Avenue family,
said Chrysler Corp.'s Tony Cervone.
   ``The car has not changed,'' he said. Yet in the 1987 model year
it got 16 mpg in the city and 21 mpg on this highway; last year it
was 17-23 and this year it is 16-23.
   The tax, enacted in 1975 to encourage efficiency when fuel
shortages were feared, gradually tightened until reaching its
present form for 1986 models. It is $500, the minimum, for the
Fifth Avenue, Diplomat and Gran Fury.
   The Allante, a $50,000-plus two-seater, got an announced 16 mpg
in the city and 24 mpg on the highway last year and was not taxed.
It fell to 15 mpg city, 23 highway this year with the use of a
larger engine. Buyers _ GM hasn't found many _ will have to pay
$650 more.
   The taxed Chrysler TC by Maserati _ some models escape _ is the
turbocharged version using the 2.5-liter (152 cubic inches) engine
and without top-gear ``lockup'' in the automatic transmission. It
measured 17 mpg in the city and 21 mpg on the highway. Cough up
another $500.
   The most fuel-profligate cars this year are four sports cars
made by the British specialty manufacturer Aston-Martin and being
sold in the United States for the first time, all rated 8-11.
That's worth the top sticker addition of $3,850.
   Another 1975 law requires manufacturers and importers to meet
minimum mileage standards averaged over their fleets, or face heavy
fines. The current standard is 27.5 mpg, calculated from test
results before EPA applies deflation factors to the mileages it
publishes. The Transportation Department is considering a petition
from GM for a lower standard for 1989 and 1990, as the department
permitted for 1986 through 1988.
   The tax applies to 22.5 mpg and below on the same calculation.

   Janice Walsh was eager to take the Nissan
300ZX for a test drive. Like many potential buyers, she wants ``a
car that's fun,'' regardless of its gas mileage. Automakers are
giving her what she wants.
   Mileage statistics for 1991 model cars released Tuesday by the
Environmental Protection Agency show virtually no gains in average
fuel efficiency since 1987 with more than half the cars getting
fewer than 23 miles per gallon.
   While midsize and many of the ``performance'' cars such as the
Nissan 300ZX are getting much better mileage today than a decade
ago, the EPA said ``overall fleet fuel economy figures have
increased only slightly'' since 1982.
   Over the last five model years, the average fleet figures have
been stuck at about 28 mpg. The EPA said the 1991 models about to
be introduced average 28.1 mpg, a shade higher than last year, but
no better than figures for 1987.
   Down the road from where Ms. Walsh and her young son eyed the
Nissan that gets 18 mpg in the city, John Webb and his wife looked
over a Mercury Grand Marquis - a big car with a V-8 engine and a
cavernous trunk.
   ``When we travel we want a good size car and lots of trunk
space,'' said Webb, a retiree who says the Marquis fits the bill
although its city mileage is a thirsty 17 mpg.
   ``We really haven't talked about mileage,'' Webb said.
   The Persian Gulf crisis has prompted renewed efforts in Congress
to require automakers to improve fuel economy.
   But Tuesday, the Senate voted 57-42 to block legislation that
would require automakers to dramatically increase the average
mileage of their fleets to 40 mpg by 2001, a 40 percent increase
from today's average of about 28 mpg. The vote ended any chance the
bill will pass this year.
   President Bush had threatened to veto the bill if it had cleared
Congress and there was formidable opposition in the House as well.
   Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen and a frequent
critic of the auto industry, accused automakers of pushing ``bigger
engines, more muscle and acceleration which they call performance''
instead of trying to make cars more fuel efficient.
   ``They want to sell speed instead of fuel economy,'' said
Clarence Ditlow, head of the Washington-based Center for Auto
Safety. ``The performance cars are the higher priced cars and the
ones with more options and more profits.''
   But those in the auto business say they're only giving the
customer what he or she wants.
   ``It's not the industry pushing performance. It's the consumer
that's been demanding it in the last few years,'' argues Ray Turk,
the Nissan salesman at Herb Gordon AutoWorld in suburban Maryland
where Ms. Walsh was shopping.
   As in previous years, the 1991 models reflected a wide range of
mileage from the minicompact Geo Metro that gets 58 mpg on the
highway and only slightly less in city driving to the luxurious
two-seater Lamborghini Diablo that guzzles at 9 mpg on city
streets.
   In between are about 1,000 models and variations of models of
cars, trucks and vans.
   The EPA list includes only 35 cars subject to a gasoline
``guzzler'' tax that kicks in for cars getting 22.5 mpg or less and
in the case of the Lamborghini Diablo amounts to $3,200.
   But those numbers may be misleading.
   For tax purposes, only the raw fuel economy test scores are
used, not the lower EPA figures that are adjusted through a
mathematical formula to better reflect actual driving conditions.
Increasingly popular passenger vans, speciality vehicles and trucks
also are excluded.
   Using the adjusted EPA figures, more than half the cars listed
showed a fuel economy of fewer than 22.5 mpg with the average
mileage for increasingly popular passenger vans and 4-wheel drive
speciality vehicles coming in at fewer than 20 mpg.
   Four of the 10 cars with the best fuel economy were variations
of the Geo, a Japanese-built car sold through General Motors.
   The others were two variations of the Honda Civic, two versions
of the Suzuki Swift, the Daihatsu Charade and the diesel-powered
Volkswagen Jetta, all with mileage estimates of between 37 mpg and
49 mpg in the city and 43 mpg to 52 mpg on the highway.
   At the other extreme were the Lamborghini Diablo, five versions
of the Rolls-Royce, two BMWs and a pair of Ferraris. None of the 10
vehicles achieved more than 12 mpg in city driving.
   According to industry figures, those worst and best performers
account for only a small fraction of the vehicles likely to be on
the nation's highways. The industry estimates cars that get better
than 40 mpg account for less than 3 percent of sales, while the
luxury cars that make up the worst mileage performers are far fewer
in number.
   Energy conservation advocates and environmentalists said the
latest figures demonstrate the failure of the auto industry to push
fuel economy in marketing and research.

   A federal appeals court reversed two previous
court decisions and let stand Friday changes the government imposed
three years ago in the way automobile fuel economy is tested.
   Critics of the 1985 changes by the Environmental Protection
Agency had charged that the changes had allowed automakers to save
millions of dollars in penalties for failing to meet fuel economy
standards.
   A three-judge panel and later the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
had ruled in favor of a suit filed by the Center for Auto Safety,
challenging the EPA's 1985 decision, which eased methods used by
automakers to determine gas mileage for each of their car models.
   Those tests are used to determine fleet-wide fuel economy
figures that each automaker must meet under separate regulations.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration establishes the
fleet average, and if an automaker does not meet the average and
does not have credits from past years, it must pay a civil penalty.
   The full appeals court said Friday that the two previous
rulings, in 1986 and last May, were in error. As a result, the EPA
testing procedures imposed in 1985 will stand.
   The full, 11-member appeals court said that it had not been
determined that the Center for Auto Safety had standing to
challenge the regulatory change by the EPA, noting that the court
that issued the earlier decision had been sharply divided on that
issue.
   The ruling last May in favor of the Center for Auto Safety suit
came in a 5-5 vote.
   ``We now hold that as a majority of the ... court was unable to
satisfy itself that the court had jurisdiction, the court should
not have taken any affirmative action on the merits (of the
case),'' the court said Friday.
   The issue involves testing methods used by the automakers for
determining the fuel economy of each car model. The EPA in 1985
agreed to allow a series of technical changes in those methods
which critics said made it easier for the manufacturers to attain
higher mileage figures and, in turn, made it easier to meet
fleet-wide fuel economy requirements.
   As a result, the suit argued, manufacturers such as Ford Motor
Co. and General Motors Corp., which were having difficulty meeting
the fuel economy requirements anyway, saved millions of dollars in
penalties.
   ``The effect of today's decision is to let GM and Ford off the
hook from having to pay any penalties for failing to comply with
fuel economy standards in previous model years,'' said Cornish
Hitchcock, an attorney for the Center for Auto Safety.
   The automakers welcomed the appeals court decision.
   ``It reinstates EPA's original rule-making, which Ford believes
did account for the effects of changing test procedures on our
corporate average fuel economy,'' said Donald Buist, director of
Ford's automotive emissions and fuel economy office in Dearborn,
Mich.
   William H. Noack, a Washington-based spokesman for General
Motors, said the company ``welcomed the decision'' but said it
would have no effect on GM's fleet-wide fuel efficiency performance
for 1988 through 1990 models.
   Federal law requires a 27.5 miles per gallon fleet-wide fuel
economy standards for 1989-90 model cars, but NHTSA has proposed
lowering that to 26.5 mpg. It has lowered it to 26 mpg in each of
the past three model years, arguing that consumer demand for large,
less fuel efficient cars, make the 27.5 standard difficult for
automakers to reach.

<TEXT>     That is down from 27.8 mpg in 1991 and is the industry's poorest showing
since the mid-1980s, when a decadelong surge in mileage improvements leveled
off.;   "It's a slight decrease," said Eldert Bontekoe, manager for
certification and fuel economy for the EPA in Ann Arbor, Mich. "I wouldn't
jump up and down and say it's really big, but it does suggest some level of
decrease from last year to this year.";   Six of the 10 highest-ranked 1992
cars get 50 mpg or better, but they were rare exceptions. Topping the list was
the one-liter minicompact Geo Metro XFi, which gets 53 mpg in city driving and
58 mpg on the highway.;   Bringing up the rear was the luxurious two-seater
Lamborghini Diablo, which gets nine mpg in town and 14 mpg on the highway.;
The report comes as the Senate prepares to debate legislation to require each
automaker to improve its overall fuel efficiency by 40 percent within a
decade.;   The industry bitterly opposes the bill and contends that only minor
improvements can be made that quickly unless fleets are drastically
"downsized" to eliminate many larger and midsize models.;   But industry
critics say automakers can reach the bill's target using existing technology.;
  "These latest numbers are an indication that the manufacturers need to be
regulated for us to have competitive fuel economy with the rest of the world,"
said Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a consumer organization.;
Automakers are pushing larger cars because they are more profitable, Claybrook
said.;   A spokesman for the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, a trade
group representing the Big Three U.S. automakers, said it would have no
immediate comment on the EPA report.;   The government's first fuel-economy
standards in the 1970s coincided with the oil crisis, which sent buyers
scurrying to showrooms for smaller cars. The overall average leaped from 14
mpg in 1974 to 27 mpg in 1985. But since 1987, the fleet averages have
stagnated at about 28 mpg.;   As in previous years, the 1992 figures showed a
wide range of gas mileage.;   Four of the 10 best-performing cars were
variations of the Geo Metro, a Japanese-made minicompact sold through General
Motors. Two more were versions of the Suzuki Swift, virtually the same car as
the Metro. The remaining four were versions of the Honda Civic.;   At the
other extreme were the Lamborghini, five Rolls-Royce models, two versions of
the Aston Martin Virage Saloon, the Ferrari Testarossa and the Ferrari F40.
None did better than 12 mpg in the city or 17 mpg on the highway.  </TEXT>

   DETROIT -- Honda Motor Co. plans to introduce next fall a
subcompact that will get up to 65 miles per gallon in highway
driving -- the highest fuel economy ever recorded in the U.S.
   But for all of its expected efficiency, the new Honda
Civic Hatchback VX may wind up as more of a public relations
tool than a sales success. Highly fuel efficient cars such as
Honda's current CRX HF model or General Motors Corp.'s Geo
Metro XFi, which is the most efficient car on the road today,
account for a tiny slice of the market, despite growing
concern about the environment and fuel prices.

   Honda executives disclosed the fuel-economy capabilities
of the new Civic model during a Senate hearing on a proposal
that would force car makers to increase the average fuel
economy of their cars by 40% by the end of the century. But
Thomas Elliott, executive vice president of Honda's U.S.
sales arm, downplayed the potential market significance of
the car. He said the proposed mileage standards would limit
competition and result in higher prices for smaller, less
comfortable cars.
   Honda officials "don't believe consumers are ready to
accept" smaller vehicles that trade performance for fuel
economy, he added.
   Honda officials offered little additional information
about the 1992 Civic VX beyond its expected fuel economy of
65 miles per gallon on the highway, 50 miles per gallon in
the city. The officials did indicate, however, that the car
will have a small, four-cylinder engine.

<TEXT>
   U.S. automakers will have to improve fuel economy
to 27.5 miles per gallon on 1990 passenger models, Transportation
Secretary Samuel Skinner said Wednesday.
   ``I'm hopeful this will be an incentive to (auto makers) to
explore better ways to develop better engines and get better
mileage,'' Skinner said at a news conference after a speech to the
Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry.
   ``We've got to get beyond where we are today, in miles per
gallon, if we're going to deal with this energy crisis.'' He said
the United States is importing more than 8 million barrels of oil a
day for the first time since the 1970s.
   The new standard will be 1 mile per gallon more efficient than
the current 26.5 mile-per-gallon level for 1989 models set by the
Department of Transportation, and 1.5 miles per gallon higher than
the standard in the three previous model years, the department said
in a news release.
   It was 1975 when Congress passed the Energy Policy and
Conservation Act, giving the Transportation Department authority to
set the ``corporate average fuel economy'' standard for passenger
cars sold in the United States.
   The standard, known as the CAFE, is the average fuel economy
measured over the automakers' entire fleets.
   ``Although the standard is tough, Ford will comply,'' said
Donald R. Buist, a spokesman for Ford Motor Co. in Dearborn, Mich.
``For the longer term, alternative ways of measuring fuel-economy
progress should be considered.''
   William Noack, a spokesman for General Motors Corp. in
Washington D.C., said CAFE is a ``misguided regulatory program that
doesn't save energy but does endanger U.S. jobs'' by restricting
the number of family-size American-made cars manufacturers can
produce.
   ``We will, of course, do all we can do to meet the requirements
... even though it is hard to understand why there is such a law
that is harmful to U.S. full-line manufacturers and therefore to
U.S. jobs.''
   Noack said CAFE makes larger cars less available, giving
consumers one of three options: keep their less fuel-efficient
cars; buy trucks or vans _ also less fuel efficient but not covered
by CAFE; or buy larger cars made by foreign manufacturers.
   Though foreign-made cars sold in the United States are governed
by the CAFE standard, most foreign manufacturers have accrued
credits under the program by marketing highly fuel-efficient cars
in past years and can now sell bigger cars without penalty, he said.
   Ben Dunn, a spokesman with Chrysler Motors in Highland Park,
Mich., said ``Chrysler did not take a position on the petition to
roll back the 1990 CAFE standards,'' because the company has always
met the standard. Chrysler sells a larger proportion of small cars
and has higher fuel economy when averaged over its fleet.
   If automakers fail to comply with the CAFE standard, they would
``incur hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in fines, so
the statute enforces itself,'' Skinner said.
   The secretary, who was in Chicago as part of National
Transportation Week observances, said he could not estimate how
much of a saving in fuel the new standard would produce nationally.
   Bob Marx, a spokesman at Skinner's office in Washington, said
the figures were not immediately available.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pressure to save fuel could increase highway
deaths, an auto safety group said Wednesday in reporting new
evidence that small cars are less safe than bigger models.
   The study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety
concludes that, on average, small cars are deadlier than less
fuel-efficient autos, that Japanese cars are becoming longer and
safer while American cars are becoming shorter and more dangerous,
and that when a manufacturer reduces the size of a given model, the
model becomes more dangerous.
   In a broad study begun well before the Mideast crisis brought
new attention to ways of decreasing U.S. dependence on foreign oil,
the institute said safety too often is ignored in the debate over
auto mileage standards.
   Carmakers already are required to produce cars with an average
of 27.5 miles per gallon for 1990 models. One legislative proposal
would increase fuel economy 20 percent in passenger cars by 1995
and 40 percent by 2001.
   ``Fuel-economy standards create safety problems if they force
automakers to make cars smaller in order to increase the average
miles per gallon of their fleets,'' the institute said.
   The organization, which is financed by auto insurance companies,
researches a wide range of highway safety issues.
   Institute President Brian O'Neill said there are ways to save
more fuel without making cars smaller, including engine changes
that put less importance on power and speed and measures that
relieve urban congestion.
   But carmakers say they eventually have to make cars smaller to
meet the stringent mileage standards.
   ``I'm as good an environmentalist as the next guy, but I believe
we have to look at the complete picture,'' O'Neill said.
   Smaller cars are more prone to rollovers and damage that can
injure occupants, the institute said, offering the following
evidence:
   _Based on an analysis of death rates and fuel ratings for 47
four-door cars, on average, for every one mile-per-gallon
improvement in fuel economy, there is a 3.9 percent increase in the
death rate.
   _Overall, the death rate in the smallest cars on the road is
more than double the rate in the largest cars: 3 deaths per 10,000
registered cars for the smallest cars and 1.3 for the largest in
1989.
   _The frequency of damage claims for small, two-door cars is 35
percent higher than for large two-door cars.
   _Among the 29 two- and four-door cars with the highest frequency
of injury claims, 27 are small and two are mid-sized.
   The institute said that in the 1979 model year, the average
wheelbase of Toyotas and Nissans was 15 inches shorter than the
wheelbases of domestic Ford and General Motors cars, and the death
rate in Japanese cars was 56 percent higher.
   In the 1988 model year, as the average wheelbase difference was
reduced to approximately eight inches, the death rates in the
Japanese and U.S. cars were about the same, the institute said.
   The report said that fatalities in 10 of 11 GM models increased
after smaller models of the cars were produced.
   All GM body types except the 1982 A-type cars showed increases
in the number of deaths per 10,000 registered cars after the cars
were made smaller, the report said.
   The most dramatic increase was in 1986 E-type Buick Rivieras,
Cadillac Eldorados and Olds Toronados, which were compared with the
larger 1984-85 models. The increase in the rate of deaths was 67
percent, from 0.9 per 10,000 cars to 1.5, the report said.

FT  30 SEP 93 / US carmakers aim for 80 miles a gallon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US CAR manufacturers yesterday joined the federal government in a research
programme aimed at developing cleaner cars with three times the fuel economy
of today's models.
The programme will pool resources from General Motors, Ford and Chrysler
with those of the government's space, defence and nuclear weapons
laboratories, and will redirect government research spending.
'Our long-term goal is to develop affordable, attractive cars that are up to
three times more fuel-efficient than today's cars - three times - and meet
strict standards for urban air pollution, safety, performance and comfort,'
President Bill Clinton said at a White House ceremony yesterday to launch
the initiative.
Some critics complain the goal of around 80 miles per US gallon is
technologically impossible. But Vice-president Al Gore said researchers
needed to be imaginative. 'After all, considering that this country spends
tens of billions of dollars each year to upgrade and improve bombers and
fighters, it is amazing we are content to use a technology on our highways
that was developed in 1876,' Mr Gore said.
US carmakers are currently required to produce a fleet whose fuel
consumption averages 27.5 miles per gallon. The US Environmental Protection
Agency, in statistics produced this week, showed the overall average of cars
sold in the US is around 28.1 mpg, twice as efficient as the cars sold in
the 1970s but with little change in the last seven years.
Only two car models studied by the EPA, the Geo Metro XFI and the Honda
Civic HB, exceeded 50 mpg.
Others worry that the programme lacks any commitment for transferring
greater fuel efficiency from the laboratory to the production line.
Some environmentalist groups fear that the research project might, in fact,
be used by Mr Clinton to cover his retreat from a campaign pledge to
increase the average fuel efficiency required by law to 40 mpg by the year
2000 and 45 mpg by 2015 - a move fiercely opposed by the car companies.
An increase in fuel efficiency requirements is also opposed by many
environmental economists, who argue that the problem is not the availability
of fuel-efficient cars but the lack of incentive for anyone to buy them
while US petrol prices remain so low.
Petrol taxes are due to rise by 4.3 per cents a gallon on Friday following
this year's budget, but Mr Clinton's efforts to impose a stiffer tax on all
forms of energy were shot down in Congress.

<LEADPARA>  Hazardous-material experts hope today to begin working on the arduous and
dangerous task of getting rid of more than 3,500 gallons of aqueous hydrazine,
a toxic rocket fuel component, dumped in a Ventura County train derailment
Sunday.;    Plans to begin pumping out the contents of 64 giant barrels of the
chemical today were postponed while authorities double checked their "attack
plan," said Ron Taylor, spokesman for the Ventura County Fire Department. The
hope, he said, is to begin work later today.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The chemical spill has closed off 10 miles of Highway 101 near the
ocean-front community of Seacliff, between San Barbara and Los Angeles, with
detours taking travelers up to four hours, authorities said. Authorities now
say it will be sometime Thursday before the key north-south route reopens.;
Only eight of the 55-gallon drums containing the dangerous hydrazine liquid
were punctured when cars from a Southern Pacific freight keeled over and
crashed, Taylor said.;    But 64 drums received some kind of damage when they
toppled from a shipping container atop a flatcar, he said. The toxic materials
will have to be removed from the damaged containers, transferred to larger
barrels and resealed, Taylor said.;    When the toxic cleanup is complete,
CalTrans workers will be able to determine the amount of damage done to a
overpass pillar on Highway 101 struck by a boxcar in the derailment, Taylor
said.;    Weary fire crews;  Crews wearing blue "space suit" protective gear
worked until after midnight, setting up for today's operation, he said. It's
not known when the work will be finished.;    Weary fire crews from Ventura
and Oxnard County were to be given a break in cleanup efforts today, with
firefighters with toxic conduct expertise due in from Los Angeles and Santa
Barbara County, Taylor said.;    Fumes from the toxic hydrazine still hang
over the spill area, he said. Some 300 residents evacuated from Seacliff won't
be able to return home until the full cleanup is completed, Taylor said.;
The derailed SP train threw sparks for 20 miles and started more than 30 fires
before the derailment.;    14 freight cars involved;  But no one aboard
noticed because the train didn't have a caboose and the nearest rail heat
sensors were miles away.;    Fourteen freight cars eventually slammed into
each other in a spectacular accident.;    California's second serious train
derailment in two weeks, both by Southern Pacific, renewed calls for better
regulation of how toxic materials are shipped.;    "The train cars just broke
apart like over-ripe melons," said Terrence Gilday, Ventura County
environmental health manager. "We have drums of hazardous material all over
the place, and it's still releasing fumes. It's going to be a mess for a
while.";    Three people were treated for nausea after breathing fumes from
the spilled hydrazine.;    One of those who complained was Rep. Barbara Boxer,
D-San Rafael, who reported feeling "ill and nauseous" after driving by the
derailment site.;    Ironically, Boxer had called for a congressional hearing
Wednesday on train safety issues because of the derailment two weeks ago in
the Sacramento River headwaters.;    Repeat performance; The Seacliff accident
was almost a repeat performance of July 14, when another Southern Pacific
derailment dumped poison into the river, killing all life in a 40-mile stretch
of one of Northern California's most pristine trout streams.;    Officials
said the Ventura County derailment doesn't pose the same environmental
threat.;    Investigators suspect the Sunday derailment was caused by a frozen
wheel bearing that got so hot it melted the axle. A wheel then fell off, and
witnesses said the dragging container car spewed sparks and threw gravel for
miles.;    Ventura County firefighters responded to some 30 spot fires left in
the northbound train's wake, from Camarillo almost to the Santa Barbara County
line.;    But apparently the engineer couldn't detect the problem from the
front of the 39-car train, which was three-quarters of a mile long.;
Emergency crews responding to the fires had difficulty contacting the train
crew, Gilday said. "It was a matter of the train being faster than
communication.";    Train workers blame the accident on the lack of a caboose,
which Southern Pacific began phasing out seven years ago in an attempt to
reduce the number of crew members required on each train.;    "No one can
refute the fact that if there had been a caboose on the train, the accident
would have been avoided," said J. P. Jones, legislative director of the United
Transportation Union.;    Heat detectors;  In place of staffed cabooses,
Southern Pacific says it has placed heat detectors at intervals along its
tracks to sense overheated wheels and sparks. The ill-fated train passed one
sensor 36 miles before the derailment, and there was no sign of a wheel
problem, spokesman Bob Hoppe said. The train derailed two miles before the
next detector could have warned the engineer of a problem, Hoppe said.;
Southern Pacific, criticized for taking an hour to notify the state Office of
Emergency Services after the Sacramento River spill, took one hour and 40
minutes to call the OES on Sunday. By that time, local fire and environmental
safety officials had already evacuated residents and campers.;    The train
carried 76 55-gallon drums of diluted hydrazine. A brief breath of the
ammonia-like chemical can cause nausea and burning eyes. Longer-term exposure
can cause burns, damage internal organs and ultimately result in death, said
Jay Young, a chemical health and safety consultant.;    "Basically, your red
blood cells go to pieces," Young said. "If that stuff is blowing over a
highway, the road should be closed. It would make a wonderful tear gas if it
weren't so deadly dangerous.";    The highway may not reopen until Wednesday,
depending on cleanup and an assessment of the Highway 101 overpass damaged in
the derailment. It is suspected that as the heavy freight cars tumbled
underneath the freeway, they weakened the bridge supports.;    A decision
won't be made until late today at the earliest, "but it will probably be
Wednesday," said Cornell Kimball of the California Department of
Transportation.;    Passengers disrupted;  The derailment disrupted passenger
service on the main San Francisco-Los Angeles route, and Amtrak bused
passengers between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles, spokesman Bruce Heard said.
Six Amtrak trains ply the route daily, with several hundred people on board
each train. It was unknown when service might resume.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Government Sets Light Truck CAFE for 1992</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fuel economy standards for 1992 light trucks will
stay the same as for 1991 models, the government said Friday.
   Auto companies opposed tougher standards for 1992, saying people
are buying larger trucks that bring average fuel economy down.
Environmental groups had argued that the standard should be tougher.
   ``The biggest thing we can do to curb global warming is to
improve the fuel efficiency of our cars and light trucks,'' said
Sierra Club spokesman Dan Becker in Washington, D.C.
   The corporate average fuel economy standard for 1992 light
trucks will be 20.2 miles per gallon, the same as the 1991 CAFE
requirement and up from 20 mpg this year, the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration said.
   In addition to setting a CAFE requirement for cars, currently
27.5 miles per gallon, NHTSA annually sets a light truck standard
applying to pickup trucks, vans and utility vehicles that weigh up
to 8,500 pounds.
   NHTSA decided manufacturers couldn't achieve significant
improvements for 1992 through technological or marketing changes,
spokesman Jim Herd said.
   Ford Motor Co. backed the lower requirement because larger
trucks are selling faster than smaller, more fuel-efficient ones,
said David L. Kulp, Ford's manager of fuel economy, planning and
compliance.
   ``We felt that the market was going to hold us at this kind of
level. There are improvements being made in the trucks, they've
just been offset by some of the shifts to the larger products,''
Kulp said.
   General Motors Corp. spokesman John Anderson said the decision
recognized that tighter standards could reduce trucks' usefulness.
``Trucks have an enormous range of applications, from towing to
agricultural and construction uses,'' he said.
   The Environmental Action Foundation argued on behalf of groups
including the Sierra Club that standards should be raised, to 35
miles per gallon by 2000, said Dru Schmidt-Perkins, environmental
analyst for the group.
   ``They are already 25 percent less efficient than cars,''
Schmidt-Perkins said. ``And for the most part these are not farm
vehicles and not commercial vans, they are minivans and light
pickup trucks which do nothing more than haul briefcases and
groceries.''

<BYLINE>GM, Ford Warn Stricter Fuel Economy Standards Would Cost Jobs</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Failure to loosen fuel economy standards for
1989 and 1990 cars will cost American jobs and may drive carbuyers
into the showrooms of foreign manufacturers, the nation's two
largest automakers said Wednesday.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., at a public hearing,
urged the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to keep
the mandatory fuel economy level from reverting to 27.5 miles per
gallon in October.
   Both GM and Ford said they could not produce a mix of cars that
would have a corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, at that
level. Chrysler Corp., the third large U.S. automaker, projected it
will meet or exceed a 27.5 mpg standard next year and did not speak
at the hearing.
   The standard has been set at 26 mpg since 1986 under an
exception allowed by NHTSA.
   The fuel-economy law, adopted in 1975 to reduce imported
petroleum consumption at a time of rapidly rising prices, sets a
maximum level of fuel consumption each automaker's fleet of
passenger cars, on average, must meet.
   ``Ford's inability to meet the 27.5 mpg CAFE standard for 1989
and 1990 is not because of lack of effort, but instead is because
of substantial market and economic changes,'' said Donald Buist,
Ford's director of automotive emissions and fuel economy.
   With gasoline prices averaging below $1 a gallon, larger cars
are selling well as consumers look for luxury and performance
rather than concentrating on mileage, Buist said.
   The corporate average fuel economy is calculated on the basis of
sales, and public demand for less fuel efficient large cars drives
the average up, the automakers said.
   ``Overly stringent CAFE standards restrict domestic production
of larger cars and higher performance engines,'' Buist said.
``Foreign manufacturers, in particular the Japanese, are ready and
willing to meet this consumer demand with vehicles built or sourced
predominately in foreign countries. This could result in the loss
of thousands of U.S. jobs without any appreciable fuel economy
savings.''
   GM presented Transportation Secretary James Burnley with 5,000
letters from employees of and retirees from its Arlington, Texas,
assembly plant, their families and labor leaders urging him to
lower the CAFE standard to 26.5 mpg.
   A 27.5 mpg standard would force cutbacks in big-car production,
resulting in layoffs in Arlington and elsewhere that would cost GM
and its suppliers 60,000 jobs in 1989 and 110,000 jobs in 1990,
said Richard Klimisch, GM's environmental activities executive
director.
   Klimisch said GM has lost in its share of the market because
``we've gone too far with CAFE.''
   ``It doesn't do any good to put in new technology if you can't
sell the cars,'' Klimisch said.
   Opponents of looser standards urged NHTSA to raise the
fuel-economy requirement to 27.5 mpg as the agency has proposed.
   Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, a
consumers group, said if the standards were relaxed, ``the domestic
manufacturers would virtually become importers of everything but
large cars, given the projected worldwide glut of auto production
capacity.'' The result, he said, would be the export of U.S. jobs.
   The center proposed raising the standard to 55 mpg by the turn
of the century, beginning at 30 mpg in 1991.
   NHTSA said it expects to issue a rule on the 1989 and 1990
standards within weeks.
   GM said its 1988 average fleet mileage would be 27.5 mpg or 27.6
mpg. Ford projected average fuel economy of 26.5 mpg this year, and
Chrysler said its cars would average 28.5 mpg.

      For Car Buyers, 1990 Is
   Closer Than They Think
   WANT A CAR of the future?
A 1990 model car can be yours as early as this January.

   Typically, next-year models are introduced a few months before the year actually starts.
But just weeks after 1989 begins, Chrysler Corp. will roll out the Plymouth Laser and bill it as a 1990 model.
General Motors Corp. will launch its 1990 Chevrolet Lumina sedan in May.
Nissan Motor Co.'s new 300 ZX sports coupe and its minivan make their debuts next spring as 1990 models.

   Actually, Chrysler officials say, the company could have introduced the Laser this fall instead of waiting until next year, because production is running ahead of schedule.
But launching a 1990 model car before 1988 ends would have been absurd.

   Or worse.
A federal regulation prevents auto makers from introducing 1990-model vehicles more than 12 months before that year actually begins.
Auto makers stretch the rule to its limits to attract buyers looking to slow their cars' depreciation.

   Lemon Law Leaves
   Buyers With Sour Taste
   LEMON LAWS are supposed to protect consumers from lousy cars, but for New York state buyers, protection carries a high price.

   That's because New York is the only place where both Ford Motor Co. and GM tack a surcharge onto the base price of their vehicles to cope with the cost of complying with the state lemon law.
Since last year Ford has charged New York car buyers an extra $115.
GM charges $65.

   The charges reflect the cost of warranty provisions required by the lemon law, the companies contend.
The law requires basic warranty coverage for 24 months or 18,000 miles, and prevents manufacturers from charging a $100 deductible for warranty visits during that period.
Ford's basic coverage ends after 12 months or 12,000 miles.
GM requires a $100-per-visit deductible after that time, although its basic coverage extends for three years or 50,000 miles.
"No other state lemon law has extended our basic warranty coverage," Louis R. Ross, a Ford executive vice president, wrote to New York Gov. Mario Cuomo to explain the extra charge.

   But consumer groups don't buy that explanation.
The surcharge is "an attack on the lemon law by the manufacturer by making {the law} seem like it's a consumer burden," argues the Center for Auto Safety in Washington, D.C.

   The war has gone beyond words.
After Ford itemized the surcharge on each vehicle's window sticker, the New York state Legislature passed a bill prohibiting the company from identifying it as a "charge" due to the lemon law.
Then two industry trade groups sued the state, attacking the lemon law's constitutionality.

   Last May, the groups won a partial victory.
A federal court in New York ruled the state couldn't ban manufacturers from telling consumers the reason for the surcharge.
But decisions on whether New York can require car makers to extend their basic warranty coverage or whether it can ban deductible payments during the warranty period are pending.

   Station Wagons Fade
   As Minivans Surge
   AS MORE FAMILIES pile the kids into the minivan, more auto makers drop the family station wagon.

   Mazda Motor Corp., which just launched its first U.S. minivan, recently discontinued the wagon version of its 323 subcompact car.
GM's Chevrolet division won't have a station wagon in its new Lumina line of midsize vehicles, which includes a sedan, coupe and an "all-purpose vehicle."
The APV, which is another name for minivan, makes it debut next fall.
Chrysler's next generation of family cars, the Dodge Spirit and the Plymouth Acclaim, will come in a sedan version only.
They replace the Aries compact and Reliant "K cars," which included station-wagon versions.

   Chrysler doesn't think it's "prudent" to invest much money in new station wagons given the popularity of minivans, says copresident Bennett E. Bidwell.

   Total minivan sales are expected to surge 25% this year to about 744,000 vehicles, putting them above station-wagon sales for the first time.
By 1990 Americans are expected to buy more than one million minivans a year.
Station-wagon sales, in contrast, peaked at 1.3 million in 1973, and will drop below 730,000 this year.

   Station wagons won't disappear, however.
Chevrolet will continue to produce the midsize Celebrity wagon after it rolls out the Lumina line.
And Ford plans to keep its Taurus station wagon.

   A Hidden Cost
   Of Eased Fuel Rules?

   THE LOWERED federal fuel economy standard for autos will boost small-car prices, an economist predicts.

   George Hoffer of Virginia Commonwealth University argues that the recent easing of the gas-mileage standard "puts less pressure" on U.S. car makers to offer incentives to boost their small car sales.
Indeed, while Ford has offered price discounts on its subcompact Escort every year since it was introduced in 1980, there aren't incentives on the 1989 Escort yet.
And Chrysler has raised the price on its 1989 Dodge Omni subcompact a hefty 10%.

   In the past, auto makers discounted small cars to increase their sales and thus offset the low gas mileage of their more-profitable large cars.
Federal regulations set a minimum miles-per-gallon average for an auto maker's entire fleet, so the companies had to sell lots of small cars in order to sell the big ones.
But now they can sell fewer small cars, because the Department of Transportation eased the corporate average fuel-economy standard for 1989 model cars to 26.5 miles per gallon from 27.5 mpg.

   Lose Vote, Dooming Measure This Year

   WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers pushing legislation to tighten
fuel-economy rules for cars lost a procedural vote in the
Senate, dooming the bill's chances for this year.
   Separately, the Environmental Protection Agency released
data showing that nine of the 10 most fuel-efficient
1991-model cars are made in Japan.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Senate supporters of the bill fell three votes short of
the 60 needed to cut off a filibuster by opponents. The vote
was 57-42. The measure was opposed by the administration and
the auto industry.
   The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Richard Bryan (D.,
Nev.), would require auto makers to increase the fuel
efficiency of their fleets 20% in the model year 1995 and 40%
by 2001.
   Among other administration efforts against the bill,
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner two weeks ago called
a news conference to release studies asserting that the
measure would result in additional highway accidents and
deaths. And along with Energy Secretary James Watkins and
Environmental Protection Agency chief, William Reilly, Mr.
Skinner sent a letter opposing the measure to Senate leaders
this week.
   Sen. Bryan said in an interview that "the administration
really brought out its heavy artillery" to defeat the bill.
Nonetheless, he said the vote indicated considerable support
for tougher fuel-economy standards among lawmakers, and he
added that he looked forward "to waging a new battle" for the
bill next year.
   The auto makers were delighted by the Senate vote. A
spokesman for Toyota Motor Co. said, "It looks like the bill
is dead this year. We think {that is} great."
   The fuel-economy bill, once viewed largely as an
anti-pollution measure, gained new momentum as an oil-saving
proposal in the wake of the Mideast crisis. Proponents were
buoyed two weeks ago when they won an earlier procedural vote
by a wider margin than expected. Following that vote,
however, the White House stepped up its lobbying, which
helped to defeat yesterday's effort.
   Moreover, the bill's chances always were less certain in
the House, where it was pending before the House Energy and
Commerce Committee. Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman
of that panel, is a longtime champion of the auto industry.
   The EPA rankings listed the subcompact Geo Metro XFI as
the most fuel-efficient car, at 53 miles per gallon for city
driving and 58 mpg on the highway. The car is made by Suzuki
and sold by General Motors Corp.
   Eight other Japanese-made cars and one from West Germany
rounded out the top-10 list. They are the Honda Civic CRX HF,
GEO Metro, Geo Metro LSI, Suzuki Swift, Honda Civic CRX HF,
Geo Metro LSI Con, Suzuki Swift, Daihatsu Charade and the
Volkswagen Jetta.
   The 10 least fuel-efficient cars all come from Europe,
with the Lamborghini DB132/Diablo topping the list. It gets
nine mpg in the city and 14 on the highway, the EPA said.
Purchasers of this model have to pay a $3,200 gas-guzzler
tax.
   The EPA figures on fuel efficiency have been released
annually since 1974.

   Here are the Environmental Protection Agency's
fuel economy ratings for 1991 model cars, vans and light trucks.
   The first column gives the manufacturer and the model. A ``d''
after the name indicates the vehicle has a diesel engine; a ``g''
indicates the car is subject to the gas guzzler tax; and a ``p''
indicates the car uses premium gasoline.
   The second column shows miles per gallon in city driving; the
third column miles per gallon in highway driving; and the fourth
column miles per gallon combining both city and highway driving.
   The fifth column indicates engine displacement in cubic inches
and the number of cylinders.
   The last column indicates the type of transmission and the
number of gears. An ``A'' designation indicates automatic
transmission. An ``L'' designation indicates automatic transmission
with a fuel-saving device that eliminates slippage. An ``M''
designation indicates manuel transmission. For example, an ``A4''
means a four-speed automatic transmission; an ``M5'' means a
five-speed manuel transmission; and an ``L3'' means a three-speed
automatic transmission with a fuel-saving anti-slippage device.
   In some cases identical car listings with the same engine
displacement, cylinders and transmission may show slightly
different mileage because of equipment or other differences not
shown in the table.
   The mileage figures reflect test conditions. For some years the
EPA has adjusted the test results through the use of a weighting
formula so the mileage more closely reflects actual driving
conditions. The combined mileage is calculated on an assumption
that 55 percent of the miles driven are driven under city
conditions.
   The mileage tests are conducted by the manufacturer with about
30 percent confirmed in separate tests by the EPA. Some
manufacturers may not have completed tests in time and their cars
are not listed.

   DETROIT -- U.S. and Iraqi soldiers may be sweating it out
in the desert, but in Detroit it's party time.
   The 1991 model year begins Oct. 1, and auto makers are
wheeling out some of the biggest and brawniest cars in years.
There's General Motors Corp.'s Buick Roadmaster wagon, a
4,415-pound monster with a V-8 engine that gets 16 miles to
the gallon in city driving. Ford Motor Co. is pitching its
own new V-8 engines, and Chrysler Corp. is offering teasing
glimpses of a 10-cylinder super sports car called Viper.
Japanese auto makers are also revving up: Mitsubishi Motors
Corp. is introducing a new 300-horsepower turbocharged sports
car, the 3000GT.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The cars couldn't have arrived at a worse time, as far as
the on-again off-again energy debate is concerned. With oil
conservation once again on the American agenda, the auto
makers are finding themselves accused of chasing quick
profits at the expense of saving gas. "They are emphasizing
power and options and not efficiency," says Daniel Becker, a
lobbyist for the Sierra Club. "At the same time the U.S. is
becoming more and more dependent on foreign oil, the auto
makers have been backsliding on fuel economy."
   As early as today, the U.S. Senate may start considering a
bill that would require new car fleets to average about 34
miles a gallon in five years, and 40 miles a gallon or more
by the year 2001. The bill's complex formula could require
some manufacturers to hit even higher targets. The current
standard is 27.5 mpg, a figure meant to represent the average
fuel efficiency for a manufacturer's entire line of cars.
Small cars usually surpass that limit, large cars usually
fall short.
   The auto makers argue that the new targets are impossible
to meet because they are at least 20% higher than the
fuel-economy levels achieved by cars currently on the road.
Don't buy "the illusion that drastic increases in government
fuel economy standards are the answer to an oil crisis," the
car companies are saying in full-page newspaper ads. "They
are not."
   But auto makers could do better -- and have in the past.
New-car fuel economy was better two years ago than it is
today, and could improve again with some modest efforts.
Sharply higher fuel-economy standards, however, could prove
highly expensive to car companies and consumers alike. Auto
makers would have to rip up their current product programs,
which were crafted in the cheap-gas era of the late 1980s.
They would also have to build a far higher proportion of
small cars than they currently envision.
   New technology will help, but there isn't any easy
solution that will let Americans cruise around in big muscle
mobiles that get 40 miles to the gallon. Thus, many consumers
would have to settle for small cars instead of the Jeeps,
minivans and luxury cars that they have been flocking to in
recent years.
   "The largest cars would have to be very small," says
auto-industry consultant George Peterson. "In the case of
Ford, a large car would be an Escort," the company's
bread-and-butter subcompact. In Italy, average automotive
fuel economy is about 34 miles a gallon -- but 80% of the
cars on the road are subcompacts.
   The auto makers concede that, thanks to the Kuwait crisis,
fuel-economy standards will get higher, even if the proposal
before the Senate doesn't become law. The only question is,
how much higher?
   Many lawmakers haven't forgotten the last go-round in this
debate. In the mid-1970s, Big Three executives insisted they
couldn't build cars that averaged better than 14 mpg.
Congress ordered them to do it anyway. Now, many of those
same executives boast about the technical achievements that
have nearly doubled the average fuel economy of their cars.
   Still, Ford says it now costs the company $300 million to
$500 million per model for every additional one-mile-a-gallon
boost in fuel economy. And Big Three executives say they've
run out of technology to make steep gains. None of the Big
Three currently meets today's federal fuel economy standard
of 27.5 mpg. Without radical changes in car design, "we don't
know how to get to 35 miles per gallon by 1995," says Richard
Donnelly, head of GM's engine division.
   But people outside the industry have some hints. For
starters, the auto makers might reconsider the latest
consumer-driven trend to put "performance" -- speed and
acceleration -- ahead of fuel economy. "A lot of the
technology used in cars today isn't being used to milk
maximum fuel economy, but to increase driveability or
performance," says J. Dillard Murrell, who helped write an
Environmental Protection Agency study of declining fuel
economy.
   Cadillac, for example, notes that its bigger, 1991 V-8
engines get 26 miles a gallon in highway driving, one mile a
gallon more than last year's models. But GM's decision to
boost the engine's horsepower to 200 from 180 washed out a
potentially greater fuel-economy gain from changes in the
engine's design.
   Ford, for its part, decided to offer a big V-8 engine in
its Thunderbird this year for the first time in years. Ford's
goal was to have the V-8 model average 23.5 miles per gallon
in city and highway driving. The company found it could
exceed that goal by one mile per gallon, but chose not to.
Instead, it redesigned the car to make it accelerate from
zero to 60 miles half a second faster, and got about 0.4
miles less per gallon.
   "If you've got half a second improvement in performance,
you've got to give up something to get it," says J.H.
Kennedy, manager of specialty-car development at Ford.
   The auto makers remind their critics that they are simply
trying to satisfy the customer. Indeed, today's "horsepower
race" is a response to a drop in gasoline prices during the
late 1980s that put performance ahead of fuel efficiency on
the shopping list of most Americans. Sales of subcompact cars
have fallen 18% in the past year, while overall auto sales
dropped only slightly.
   Also, GM got badly burned in 1986 when it built several
radically smaller luxury cars -- Cadillacs, Buicks and
Oldsmobiles -- just as gasoline prices plunged. Sales of
those models plunged as well, idling thousands of workers and
lots of expensive machinery. Only after GM hastily made the
cars big again did sales start to recover.
   The car companies raise another point: At Washington's
insistence, they have shifted their focus from fuel-economy
to making cars safer and less polluting, and that can work
against saving gas. Making a car safer often means making it
heavier by adding steel door beams or airbag hardware. And
tuning engines to run cleaner often results in diminished
fuel economy, partly because extra anti-pollution equipment
adds weight.
   The car companies say they can't simply turn on a dime
now. Product plans are set years in advance. Thus, the auto
makers have been designing cars for the mid-1990s to meet
demand for bigger, more powerful cars.
   Consider GM's Buick Roadmaster wagon and its sister cars,
the Chevrolet Caprice and Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham. During
the early 1980s, GM expected gas would rise to $2 a gallon or
more by 1990. Production of the rear-wheel-drive -- and thus
heavier -- full-size Buick Estate Wagon was scheduled to end,
and the Caprice was to be replaced by a mid-sized,
front-wheel-drive model.
   But when gasoline prices dropped, strong sales of the cars
led GM to decide to keep them big. It invested hundreds of
millions of dollars to update the Caprice and its sibling
cars and commited two factories to build them. It took six
months just to retool one of the factories.
   Now, the new Roadmaster and Caprice are hitting the market
-- just in time for another oil shock. GM could redesign the
cars as smaller, front-drive models, but that would take
another three to five years and up to $1 billion.
   GM isn't alone in this dilemma. Of 37 North American car
plants operated by the Big Three, 29 now build cars that
average less than 27.5 miles per gallon. Like their
counterparts at GM, designers at Ford and Chrysler are
working now on models for the mid-1990s. From a
fuel-efficiency standpoint, many of these vehicles will be
only marginally more economical than current products.
   All this reflects the fact that the Big Three still rely
on mid-sized and large cars for the bulk of their U.S.
automotive profits. "GM and Ford have used large, luxury cars
as cash cows," says John Casesa, industry analyst with the
Wertheim, Schroder &amp; Co. securities firm. Giving those cars
up "could have a terrible impact on profitability," he says.
   Even Japanese firms will have trouble doing a 180-degree
turn on fuel economy. They sell lots of gas-sipping
subcompacts, and have better overall fuel economy scores than
the Big Three. But the Japanese have been invading the market
for mid-sized and luxury cars with startling success --
introducing some cars that slurp more fuel per mile than
their American rivals. Nissan Motor Co.'s Infiniti Q45, for
example, has a V-8 engine and averages 21.5 miles per gallon.
   Technological advances may help the auto industry lift
fuel economy. Multivalve engines, for example, have three or
four valves for each cylinder instead of the standard two,
which adds more air to the combustion mixture and thus makes
fuel burn more efficiently. A car now powered by a 2.5-liter
conventional engine could get the same performance with a
2-liter multivalve engine, says environmental consultant K.G.
Duleep. The smaller, lighter multi-valve engine would use 8%
less gasprovided the technology isn't used just to improve
acceleration, Mr. Duleep says.
   But even if GM, Ford and Chrysler put multi-valve engines
in all their vehicles over the next several years, engineers
at those companies say they couldn't meet fleet targets as
high as 35 or 40 mpg without substantially cutting the number
of large cars they sell.
   They point to the experience of Toyota Motor Corp. Its
Camry is a five-passenger, front-wheel-drive sedan that fits
the ideal car profile laid out by federal regulators. It
comes with a standard 16-valve, four-cylinder engine and an
electronically controlled transmission, and it has high
quality standards. Yet it averages less than 33 miles per
gallon.
   That's why Toyota officials moan about proposals to raise
standards to as high as 40 mpg. To hit that level, most
Toyotas sold in the U.S. would have to be tiny cars like the
39-mpg subcompact Tercel. Toyota's highly successful,
250-horsepower Lexus LS 400 luxury sedan, which sells for
$38,000, averages just 23.5 miles a gallon. "We would be an
all-Tercel company," says a Toyota spokesman.
   Moreover, blockbuster advances in fuel savings, such as
commercially viable electric cars or two-stroke engines that
get 40 or 50 miles to the gallon, aren't coming any time
soon. GM says it must solve a number of technical problems to
put its much-publicized Impact electric car on the road, even
in limited numbers.
   Vehicles powered by propane or methanol are in use in
parts of the country. But auto makers don't have the
machinery to mass-produce these cars. And it will take time
for alternative fuels to become universally available.
   Auto makers can cut the weight of cars using plastic or
aluminum instead of steel in bumpers, doors and other parts.
But these materials cost more than steel, and in some cases
entail sacrifices in appearance and durability. And in return
for higher prices, consumers would get only marginal
fuel-economy improvement -- unless cars also were made
smaller.
   But auto makers may have little choice as they reckon with
new oil prices. Chrysler recently postponed plans to build a
big rear-wheel-drive luxury car in the mid-1990s and will use
the money to develop a compact sedan instead. GM has decided
against putting a 5.7-liter V-8 engine in the Buick
Roadmaster wagon.
   Auto makers also are starting to revamp their marketing
pitches to tilt, once again, toward fuel economy. But if the
preferences of some industry observers are any guide, it will
be a tough sell in the absence of gas lines. Mr. Duleep, the
energy conservation expert, drives a 1989 Nissan Maxima, a
muscular car that gets just 19 miles to the gallon in the
city. Says Mr. Duleep: "I have to use up my share of gas
before everybody else does."

   Here are the Environmental Protection Agency's
fuel economy ratings for 1990 model year cars, vans and light trucks.
   The first column gives the manufacturer and the model. A ``D''
after the name indicates the vehicle has a diesel engine. A ``G''
after the name indicates the car was subject to the gas-guzzler tax.
   The second column shows miles per gallon in city driving.
   The third column shows miles per gallon in highway driving.
   The fourth column shows the overall combined miles per gallon.
   The fifth column gives the engine displacement in cubic inches
and the number of cylinders.
   The last column indicates the type of transmission and the number
of gears. For example, ``A4'' means a four-speed automatic and
``M5'' means a five-speed manual. Transmissions may carry identical
designations yet differ in some respect not shown here.
   Apparently identical listings may show different or identical
mileage ratings. This occurs because of something not shown on this
table, such as different types of transmissions or other equipment.
   For several years EPA has reduced the results of its mileage
tests by constant percentages in an attempt to more closely
correspond to results achieved on the road. The city mileage tests
are discounted by 10 percent and the highway tests are discounted by
22 percent. The combined mileage shown in this table is calculated
from the discounted city and highway ratings on the assumption that
55 percent of the miles driven are in the city.
   Turbochargers are not shown, unless indicated in the name of the
model.
   The size classifications are EPA's own, based on interior volume,
and do not confirm with size classifications in common use in the
auto industry.
   Some manufacturers may not have completed tests in time and their
cars are not listed.

   DETROIT -- Auto makers dodged the fuel-economy bullet in
the Senate clean air bill, but they still face an all-out
legislative fight over this potentially costly issue.
   Environmentalists are pushing for improved gasoline
mileage as a key step in slowing global warming, a climatic
change that scientists have linked to the burning of gasoline
and other fossil fuels. Auto makers, meanwhile, complain that
a tough fuel economy law will force them to radically shrink
their cars at a time when consumers are buying bigger, more
powerful models.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The car industry is going to fight like hell, but so are
we," says Daniel Becker, director of global warming and
energy programs for the Sierra Club. "And I think Congress is
going to conclude they need to tighten up C.A.F.E. {corporate
average fuel economy}."
   The auto industry won an important skirmish when it
blocked an amendment from the Senate bill that would have
effectively required greatly improved fuel economy. Such an
amendment was GM's "No. 1 objection" to the clean air bill,
says William H. Noack, director of General Motors Corp.'s
Washington office.
   But a fight is still looming. Yesterday, the Senate
Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation
overwhelmingly approved a bill, written by Sen. Richard Bryan
(D., Nev.), that would require each manufacturer to achieve a
20% improvement in corporate fuel economy by 1995 and a 40%
improvement by 2001. The bill uses 1988 as a base.
   Approval came despite lobbying from auto industry
officials; Ford Motor Co. Chairman Harold A. Poling
personally visited four key senators before the vote. The
Bryan bill "has the potential to eliminate the family car,"
argues GM's Mr. Noack.
   Senate leadership has already promised to give the Bryan
bill time on the floor later this year. And some senators
behind the clean air bill have indicated they support tougher
fuel economy standards, not only because of global warming,
but also because of concern about the trade deficit -- caused
in no small part by massive purchases of foreign oil.
   Currently, foreign and domestic car makers are required to
meet a 27.5-mile-a-gallon average for their U.S. fleets,
about twice what the manufacturers averaged in the mid-1970s.
But after years of increases, the average fuel economy of
cars sold in the U.S. began dropping two years ago -- 4%
since 1988, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.
   In the 1990 model year, Ford, GM and Chrysler Corp. expect
to average from 26.5 miles a gallon to 27.1 miles a gallon,
although all should avoid paying federal fines because of
credits accumulated in past years. The companies say their
numbers are down because they're selling more cars with
bigger engines and weight-adding options and safety
equipment.
   Even bigger drops in fuel economy have come from Japanese
car makers, who once sold only small cars but are now making
an aggressive bid for the heart of the U.S. market. This past
fall, Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. each introduced
luxury cars with V-8 engines. Partly because of this,
Toyota's corporate average is projected to drop to 30.5 miles
per gallon this model year, about 6% below the 1988 level of
32.6 miles. The imports are "moving aggressively backwards,"
complains Sen. Bryan.
   Now, the Bryan bill would require each manufacturer to
boost its individual fuel economy, first by 20% then by 40%
-- a change from the practice of requiring manufacturers to
meet a single, industrywide number or pay penalties. The
approach in the Bryan bill has incensed the Japanese, who say
it imposes an especially tough burden because their
fuel-economy averages already exceed those of the U.S. Big
Three.
   By contrast, Chrysler and Ford each prefer the
percentage-by-manufacturer approach over an industrywide
number, although they feel the numbers in the Bryan bill are
way too high. GM is opposed to C.A.F.E. standards, period,
company spokesmen say.
   For its part, the Senate clean air bill will add perhaps
$600 to the cost of a new car. But many auto executives
believe a tough fuel economy law will be much worse, perhaps
forcing them to stop building big cars entirely.
   Backers of tougher fuel economy insist the auto makers
could meet the standards without significantly cutting down
the size of cars. Sen. Bryan points to a U.S. Office of
Technology Assessment study that found car makers could
improve fuel economy merely through more extensive use of
existing technology, such as front-wheel drive, fuel
injection and multivalve engines.
   Ronald Boltz, Chrysler's vice president of product
strategy and regulatory affairs, disagrees, saying that
changes in technology will produce some of these gains, but
the rest must come from reduced weight.
   Since 1974, the auto industry has slimmed down the average
U.S. car to a little less than 3,000 pounds from more than
4,000 pounds. In many cases, car makers were able to trim
weight without reducing interior volume, but Mr. Boltz says
that won't be the case this time around. The Bryan bill would
force Chrysler to have an average fuel economy of 39.8 miles
per gallon by 2001, making its largest car a compact, he
says.
   To some senators, that is reminiscent of the mid-1970s,
when Ford warned that the first fuel economy law could
require a product line of "all sub-Pinto sized vehicles."

   WASHINGTON -- The drive for better car gasoline-mileage is
about to collide with auto safety.
   That is the conclusion of the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety and some government auto-safety officials, who
warn that tougher fuel-economy rules -- an increasingly
popular idea because of the Mideast turmoil -- will
inevitably result in smaller vehicles and higher death rates.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But environmental groups and some highway safety advocates
vociferously disagree. Saying that stricter mileage rules
would hurt safety is "totally untrue and bogus," asserts
consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
   The increasingly nasty battle over fuel-economy standards
could determine what kind of cars consumers will be driving
in coming years. It promises to come to a head this fall,
when Congress takes up legislation sponsored by Democratic
Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada that would require auto makers
to increase the fuel efficiency of their fleets by 20% in
model year 1995 and 40% by 2001.
   Contending that the legislation could hurt safety, the
Insurance Institute, which is funded by the insurance
industry, points to a number of studies to back up its
argument. One, just completed by the institute, found that 11
types of General Motors Corp. cars downsized since 1977 had
significantly higher death rates than than their earlier,
larger counterparts. It also found that while death rates for
Toyotas and Nissans in 1979 were 56% higher than for domestic
Ford and GM cars, the rates have gotten much closer as the
Japanese cars have gotten bigger and the American cars
smaller.
   A little-noticed 1989 study by the Transportation
Department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
showed similar results. Noting that "narrower, lighter,
shorter cars have higher rollover rates than wide, heavy,
long ones," the agency found that the reduction in car sizes
since 1970 has resulted in approximately 1,340 additional
deaths in single-vehicle rollover crashes each year. And a
study last year by a Brookings Institution researcher and a
Harvard University professor predicted that over the next 10
years, the fuel-economy rules would be responsible for up to
3,900 additional fatalities involving smaller 1989 models
alone.
   On the other side of the debate are some safety and energy
analysts, who deny that tougher fuel-mileage rules would
inevitably lead to another round of vehicle downsizing. They
say available technology could provide major mileage gains --
if only car companies were compelled to use it to make cars
more fuel-efficient rather than faster and more powerful.
   "At 45 miles per gallon, we aren't talking about
downsizing the vehicle, and therefore, safety doesn't enter
into it at all," says William MacGavern, staff attorney for
the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a lobbying group. He
says front-wheel drive, the use of four, rather than two,
valves per cylinder, improved aerodynamic styling, extra
intake and exhaust valves, and continuously variable
transmissions can turn gas-gulpers into gas-sippers without a
major slimming down.
   Nevertheless, if downsizing does occur, these analysts
say, smaller cars can be made safer by installing air bags
and other safety equipment. "You can build safety into small
cars if you want to do it," says Clarence Ditlow, executive
director of the Center for Auto Safety, a consumer group
often critical of car manufacturers.
   Similarly, Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, an
advocacy group, and a former NHTSA administrator, pointed out
that under her tenure, the traffic-safety agency built
experimental vehicles that got from 32 to 50 miles per
gallon, yet protected occupants in 50 mile-per-hour frontal
crashes. The vehicles were made of lightweight, high-strength
steel filled with foam.
   Sen. Bryan's bill would be the most sweeping change in the
fuel-economy law since the original standards were
established in 1975 in response to the first oil shock. Fuel
economy is much improved from 15 years ago but in recent
years has begun to lag; it slipped 4% from 1988 to 1990,
according to the Insurance Institute. Car makers currently
must meet a fleetwide average of 27.5 miles per gallon.
   The auto industry, which is adamantly opposed to tighter
fuel-economy rules, denies that technology alone -- without
downsizing -- would allow it to comply with the gas-mileage
requirements now pending in Congress. But industry officials
won't publicly discuss the safety implications of
fuel-economy rules, saying they could be sued if they admit
that their small cars aren't as safe as their big ones.
   Nevertheless, most people on both sides of the
fuel-economy debate acknowledge that, everything else being
equal, small cars aren't as safe as large ones. "You can't
repeal the laws of physics," says Brian O'Neill, president of
the Insurance Institute.
   The institute found that the 1989 fatality rate for the
smallest cars on the road was three deaths per 10,000
registered vehicles, compared with 1.3 deaths for the largest
cars. While a modest tightening of the fuel-economy standards
might not have a big impact on safety, much tougher rules
could lead to a "substantial increase" in the fatality rate
from what it would otherwise be, he contends.
   In the institute's study of the GM cars, researchers
concluded that, after downsizing, occupant death rates during
1985-1989 increased for 10 of the 11 types of cars examined,
and stayed the same for the 11th. For example, the rate for
the 1980-81 model F-cars (Chevrolet Camaros and Pontiac
Firebirds) was 2.3 deaths per 10,000 registered cars. After
downsizing in 1982, the rate for 1982-1983 Camaros and
Firebirds increased to 3.3. A GM spokesman said the car maker
hadn't examined the report in detail, but that large cars
offer an "extra measure of protection."
   Mr. Nader doesn't dispute that but says the "great
leveler" is air bags, and he notes that the Bryan bill
includes a provision encouraging manufacturers to equip small
cars with air bags. Mr. O'Neill counters that air bags, while
beneficial, don't work in every accident: They don't protect
occupants involved in side crashes, for example, or in
frontal crashes so severe that the passenger compartment is
crushed.

<TEXT>     And in Fremont, scores of workers assemble the virtually identical Geo
Prizm and Toyota Corolla. Prizm is a domestic, and Corolla is an import, the
Environmental Protection Agency says.;   These bizarre rulings come from CAFE,
an acronym for Corporate Average Fuel Economy. CAFE is a muddled 16-year-old
federal law that mixes efforts to improve automotive fuel economy with
protecting U.S. auto industry jobs.;   Instead, the law sometimes causes the
loss of American jobs and missed chances to boost fuel efficiency and even
gives Japanese carmakers a business advantage over U.S. competitors, auto
industry executives and union officials agree.;   CAFE's glaring defects are
in the spotlight now because the U.S. Senate is preparing to vote on new CAFE
proposals aimed at increasing fuel economy 32 to 40 percent over the next 10
to 15 years.;   The problems with CAFE reflect the kind of regulatory tangle
that can occur when the government pursues separate and possibly contradictory
goals with a single piece of legislation.;   Here's how CAFE entered such a
regulatory Twilight Zone:;   In 1975, the United Auto Workers union championed
a job-saving provision in the initial CAFE law that embodied something called
the two-fleet rule.;   The rule classifies any car that gets 75 percent or
more of its value from the United States or Canada as "domestic." Any car with
at least 25 percent foreign content is an "import." Both the domestic and
import fleets of any automaker must meet the federal gas-mileage standard, now
27.5 miles per gallon.;   The goal of the two-fleet rule was to protect and
expand small-car production jobs in the United States by preventing U.S.
automakers from importing large numbers of small cars to offset the poor
mileage of its U.S.-built gas guzzlers.;   But as the auto industry has become
increasingly global, U.S. and foreign car companies have used the two-fleet
CAFE mix in ways that were never intended:;   (check) Ford Motor Co. builds
the Mercury Tracer in Mexico and classifies it as domestic. Combining North
American parts with cheap labor meets the federal definition of a domestic
car.;   (check) Ford builds the Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis,
classic American-style cruisers, in Canada but buys enough foreign parts to
call them imports.;   It's all done in the interest of balancing CAFE
numbers.;   "Whenever you have two different goals in the same law, it forces
people into a position of playing games," said Jerry Curry, head of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. "Do we make parts in the
United States? Do we ship them to the United States? Do we make them in Mexico
and pretend?;   "It's all bad for the American worker," said Curry, whose
agency helps enforce CAFE. "You lose jobs when you out-source" parts to
foreign firms.;   UAW officials believe the CAFE two-fleet provision protected
some small-car jobs -- or at least slowed U.S. automotive job losses. Ford,
for instance, still makes the fuel-sipping Escort in the United States to
offset its larger domestic cars. But unionists also acknowledge the unintended
harm of the regulatory mixture.;   "We think for a while the two-fleet idea
worked," said Alan Reuther, the UAW's top lobbyist in Washington. "But the
companies in some sense started standing CAFE on its head. . . . Now the
gaming is costing jobs.";   Reuther blames the trouble on automakers' conduct
and the CAFE law's specific mileage goal, not the two-fleet provision.;   If
the government required percentage increases in fuel economy for each
company's separate fleets -- as suggested in a number of CAFE revision
proposals pending in Congress -- automakers couldn't play games as easily, he
said.;   The Crown Victoria case is the most glaring example of CAFE gaming.;
 By shifting a few parts from U.S. and Canadian suppliers to a foreign source,
Ford turned the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis into an import -- even though it
would continue to be made in North America. The company's more fuel-efficient
import fleet could better absorb the bigger car's 18 mpg in the city, 25 mpg
on the highway.;   But adding foreign parts cost domestic jobs. Ford estimates
it had to absorb 500 workers from the switch, and that doesn't include jobs
lost at outside suppliers.;   David Kulp, Ford's fuel economy planning
manager, said the Crown Victoria decision was a tough one caused by continued
consumer interest in the car. If the model could not be shifted to the import
fleet, Kulp said, Ford would have had to restrict or end its production.;
UAW economist Steve Beckman says that in addition to the cost in jobs, the
Crown Victoria shift hurt the nation's automotive fuel efficiency. The CAFE
two-fleet rule allowed Ford to change its parts supply instead of improving
the big car's mileage.;   In addition to causing such painful decisions by
U.S. carmakers, the CAFE rules encourage the Japanese to import auto parts
rather than buy them in the United States.;   Most major Japanese automakers
build cars in the United States, but so far none has a domestic fleet. And for
now, it's in their best interest to continue having only import fleets --
especially as they build larger cars.;   But to continue having only import
fleets, they must keep the content of the cars they build in the United States
below 75 percent domestic. To achieve this goal, American auto parts purchases
must be limited, some Japanese automakers note.;   Much of the trouble from
the CAFE two-fleet rule is caused by the complicated nature of domestic
content. It's hard, in a global industry, to determine which cars and parts
are foreign and which are domestic.;   Is an engine assembled in America from
Japanese parts domestic? Is a car assembled in Mexico from American parts
foreign? And how many of those parts have to be American before the car is
considered domestic?;   The CAFE law is so vague when it comes to defining
domestic and foreign that the EPA, which checks domestic content under CAFE,
has to examine most cases individually.;   One of the strangest examples is
the General Motors-Toyota joint venture factory in Fremont. That's the place
where the same workers make the same car, but GM counts its Geo Prizm model as
domestic and Toyota certifies its Corolla version as imported.;   This CAFE
magic is aided by yet another regulatory flip: Carmakers are allowed to
average the content of any domestically built car with any foreign-made
versions of the same model. Toyota imports Corollas from Japan and Canada, so
the entire U.S. car line's domestic content is less than the estimated 75
percent of the Fremont Corollas.;   Car-line averaging allows the Japanese to
protect their single-fleet advantage under CAFE. It also results in the Honda
Accord, the most popular single car in America and one that has been made for
years in Marysville, Ohio, being called an "import.";   Even though only about
a third of Accords sold in America are made in Japan, it's enough to make the
whole fleet imported.; CAFE QUIRK; U.S. fuel economy rules have spawned some
strange side; effects. On example: A quintessential Americcan car like the;
Ford Crown Victoria is classfied as an import for 1992. Why?; Because Ford
Motor Co. needed to boose mileage ratings for; its domestic car fleet to meet
Corporate Average Fuel; Economy standards. It imported more parts for the
Crown; Victoria so it could classify the car as an import. Of; the eight parts
here, six were previously made by Ford; plants in the United States or Canada
and one by a U.S.; supplier. One is a new part for '92.; Fuel tank

   DETROIT -- Ford Motor Co. is offering cut-rate financing
in an effort to boost disappointing sales of its new twin
subcompact models, the Ford Escort and the Mercury Tracer.
   Escort sales are running more than 20% behind last year's
pace, and are the big reason behind Ford's drop in market
share so far this year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The incentive financing program, which began Aug. 9 and
runs until Sept. 3, will allow Escort and Tracer buyers to
obtain 4.8% financing on loans up to 48 months. In 10
northeastern states, buyers will have the option of taking
$500 cash instead of the budget financing.
   The moves come on top of an earlier Ford program that
gives $500 to Escort and Tracer buyers who are purchasing
their first car. Fred Ricart, a Ford dealer in Columbus,
Ohio, said his Escort sales have dropped about 50% this year,
but he added that the new programs have already begun
reviving sales.
   Ford's share of the U.S. car market fell to 21% in the
first seven months of this year from 22.8% last year. Early
this year, Ford officials predicted the company would gain
market share in 1990, but now that goal is looking difficult
to achieve. If Ford's share of new-car sales does drop, it
will be the first such decline since 1986.
   Boosting sales of the fuel-efficient Escort and Tracer is
important for another reason as well: It helps Ford to keep
selling big cars with far lower gas mileage but far higher
profit margins. This year, Ford expects its cars to average
less than 26.5 miles per gallon, well under the federal
standard of 27.5 miles per gallon. Ford won't pay a penalty
because of credits earned from previous years, but the
credits will run out in a year or so.
   Ford invested $1.9 billion to develop the new Escort,
which is based on a similar model from its Japanese
affiliate, Mazda Motor Corp. When the 1991-model Escort first
appeared in April, it had trouble competing with the 1990
Escort, which had a lower base price and carried a $1,000
rebate as well.

   Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley today
told automakers they must achieve an average fuel economy of 26.5
miles per gallon for 1989-model cars _ higher than required this
year but less than mandated under a law Burnley has the power to
change.
   He said his action, cutting 1.0 mpg off the standard Congress
told manufacturers to meet for 1989 models, was designed to help
the U.S. auto industry compete abroad.
   Each automaker is required to post an average fuel economy of at
least 26.0 mpg for all of its 1988 models. That has been the
standard for the last three model years.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. had said they could not
meet the 27.5-mpg standard without significant layoffs.
   Burnley, making the announcement this morning, said:
   ``A standard of 27.5 mpg for model year 1989 would have clearly
put our domestic full-line manufacturers at a competitive
disadvantage compared to some foreign manufacturers, especially the
Asians, who have been building only small cars and can easily meet
the fuel economy requirements,''
   Arrayed against the automakers in public hearings last month
were a number of public issues groups, which sought even stricter
fuel-economy standards for reasons ranging from conserving gasoline
to reducing carbon-dioxide emissions.
   The fuel-economy law was adopted in 1975 to reduce gasoline
consumption at a time of rapidly rising prices.
   The law set a goal of 27.5 mpg beginning in 1985 but allowed the
Transportation Department, through the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration, to alter the standard.
   It was that provision that enabled the department to set the
standard at 26.0 mpg beginning in 1986 and at 26.5 mpg for the 1989
model year.
   Both GM and Ford had said a 27.5 mpg standard would have caused
layoffs at their auto plants because they would have had to cut
back on production of larger, less fuel-efficient cars.
   Ultimately, the job losses to the auto industry and its
suppliers would have numbered in the hundreds of thousands, GM and
Ford said.
   GM said Burnley's decision ``was in the best interest of
American workers and consumer choice'' and called the 1975 law
``outdated.''
   Ford said the agency's decision ``recognizes that consumer
preferences resulting from low fuel prices have placed a
particularly heavy burden on our efforts to comply with the 27.5
mpg standard.''
   Chrysler Corp. said it would exceed a 27.5 mpg standard and
complained that ``a meaningful gasoline tax would eliminate the
need for a CAFE-like regulatory system.''
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca has taken the position that his
company has successfully met the fuel-economy level set by Congress
and federal regulators should not change the rules to help
companies that have been less successful in making fuel-efficient
cars.
   The Center for Auto Safety, a consumers group often at odds with
the automakers and their regulators, said it intends to file a
lawsuit seeking to force NHTSA to allow the standard to return to
27.5 mpg.
   Burnley's decision ``is another cave-in by the Reagan
administration,'' said Clarence Ditlow, the center's director. ``It
is going to cost U.S. jobs as GM and Ford continue to make small
cars abroad.''

   The Transportation Department on Monday set
fuel-economy standards for 1989 passenger cars at 26.5 miles per
gallon of gasoline, a level the nation's two largest automakers say
they could meet without layoffs and production cuts.
   The department's decision kept the fuel economy average required
for each auto manufacturer from increasing to the 27.5 mpg enacted
by Congress in 1975. Since 1986, the automakers have been required
to meet a 26 mpg standard.
   A higher requirement ``would have clearly put our domestic
full-line manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage compared to
some foreign manufacturers, especially the Asians, who have been
building only small cars and can easily meet the fuel-economy
requirements,'' said Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley.
   The order issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, an agency within the Transportation Department,
said 26.5 mpg represented the level attainable by General Motors
Corp. and Ford Motor Co. in their domestic fleets of passenger cars
without ``harmful production restrictions and without any
significant restrictions on consumer choice.''
   ``Thus, no job or sales losses should result from GM and Ford,
as well as the manufacturers of most foreign vehicles sold in this
country, meeting the standard; indeed, that standard should help
preserve the ability of the two domestic companies to recapture
sales and jobs from competitors,'' the NHTSA order said.
   GM and Ford, which had warned higher fuel-economy standards
would force cutbacks of big-car production and cost the industry
hundreds of thousands of jobs, were quick to praise the order.
Consumer groups were critical.
   GM said the decision ``was in the best interest of American
workers and consumer choice.'' The company said the 1975 law that
established the corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE, standards
was ``outdated.''
   Ford said the agency's decision ``recognizes that consumer
preferences resulting from low fuel prices have placed a
particularly heavy burden on our efforts to comply with the 27.5
mpg standard.''
   The nation's third-largest automaker, Chrysler Corp., whose car
line is concentrated in the smaller, more fuel-efficient models,
said only that it would exceed 27.5 mpg in 1989 and said ``a
meaningful gasoline tax would eliminate the need for a CAFE-like
regulatory system.''
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca has argued that his company has
successfully met the fuel-economy level set by Congress and federal
regulators should not change the rules to help companies that have
been less successful in making fuel-efficient cars.
   The Center for Auto Safety, which favors stricter fuel-economy
standards, said through Director Clarence Ditlow that the
Transportation Department's decision was ``another cave-in by the
Reagan administration'' and vowed to go to court to try to force
the agency to let the standard increase to 27.5 mpg.
   Other critics, such as Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., and the
Energy Conservation Coalition, called for higher standards to
reduce the release of gases into the atmosphere, arguing that
automotive emissions contribute to a long-term warming of the
Earth's atmosphere through the greenhouse effect.
   ``As the evidence mounts that the Earth is getting warmer and
may experience unprecedented temperature increases, the U.S. should
be improving automobile efficiency to reduce greenhouse
emissions,'' Wirth said.
   The Reagan administration, GM and Ford contend that the
fuel-economy standards, enacted to reduce petroleum imports, have
outlived their usefulness.
   With gasoline prices now running about $1 a gallon across the
nation, the need to conserve is less pressing than it was in the
mid-1970s and consumers want to buy larger cars, the administration
and the automakers say.
   NHTSA's decision coincided with release of a public opinion poll
concluding that 90 percent of Americans believe the government
should require the automakers to build more fuel-efficient cars.
   The telephone poll of 1,000 registered voters Sept. 10-14 was
conducted for the Communications Consortium, a public relations
firm representing environmental groups. The margin of error was
about three percentage points.

<HL> Mileage Ruling
May Raise Penalty
For Ford and GM

   A federal appeals court here ruled that the Environmental Protection Agency must recalculate fuel economy figures for vehicles made since 1980 in a way that would result in increased federal penalties against Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp.

   The Center for Auto Safety, an industry watchdog group based here, said the decision could cost General Motors $250 million and Ford $50 million in penalties for failing to meet U.S. mileage standards.

   The ruling came in a challenge by the auto safety center to a June 1985 decision by the EPA to retroactively boost its estimates of vehicles' gas mileage.
The agency said the 1985 adjustments compensated for changes in testing procedures that had lowered mileage estimates.
Clarence Ditlow, director of the auto safety center, calculated that these changes had freed GM and Ford from about $500 million in penalties.

   In court, the center argued that the EPA must adjust its calculations for changes that increased fuel mileage as well as those that depressed it.
The three-judge panel agreed that the EPA must make adjustments to reflect that the agency tested cars with about 4,000 miles on them in 1975, and as much as 10,000 miles in later years.
Evidence shows that fuel economy generally increases in a new car until it has been driven about 25,000 miles, the court said.

   In Detroit, a GM spokesman said: "We have just received the court's ruling and until we've had a chance to study it, we won't have anything more to say."
A Ford official said the company wouldn't have an immediate comment.

   Chrysler Corp., the other large U.S. auto maker, isn't affected by the ruling because it has complied with the fuel-efficiency mandates.
Chrysler, in fact, has opposed demands by Ford and GM that federal officials relax standards or boost fleet test scores.

   The center's Mr. Ditlow called the ruling "a major victory."
He said, "Ford and GM will now have to hire engineers to meet the fuel-efficiency standards like Chrysler did, rather than rely on lawyers and lobbyists to lower the standards."

   Though the decision would penalize Ford and GM, the companies are expected to be able to trim their liability with credits for beating the 1987 and 1988 requirements for fleet fuel economy.
The Transportation Department recently lowered that requirement to 26 miles per gallon from 27.5 mpg.
The auto safety center's estimates of increased penalties don't take the credits into account.

   EPA officials didn't have any immediate comment on the decision.

<TEXT>     "It's important to let the American public know that their elected
officials may unknowingly be making a decision that will trade real human
lives for the hope of saving a few barrels of oil," said Diane Steed,
president of the Coalition for Vehicle Choice.;    The group includes 200
companies and organizations, including the Big Three U.S. automakers.;
Supporters of tougher standards predicted the effort to portray them as unsafe
would flop. "The big lie never works, and the auto industry is lying again,"
said Daniel Becker of the Sierra Club.;    Steed declined to say how much the
campaign would cost but said it was a two-week "first wave" of an extended
push to rally the public against fuel-economy legislation pending in Congress.
It will involve television, radio and print media advertising, she said.;
The Senate Commerce Committee has approved a bill that would require each
automaker to improve new-car fleets' average mileage 40 percent by the year
2001. Several pending House bills seek even bigger improvements.;    Under
current law, the cars a manufacturer produces in a given year must have an
overall average of 27.5 miles per gallon or better.;    Automakers say the
improvements that the bills demand could be achieved only by "downsizing"
their fleets to the point that many mid-size and luxury models no longer could
be made.;    One ad prepared for newspapers and magazines shows a caricature
of a compact car packed with luggage -- leaving no space for the frustrated
mom, dad and kids standing outside.;    "The family car of the future has
plenty of room. Unless you include the family," the caption reads.;    But the
campaign's focus is on safety. The 30-second television spot shows a
Department of Transportation crash test, with a 1991 Ford Crown Victoria
weighing 4,000 pounds and a 1991 Subaru Justy weighing 2,300 pounds slamming
into each other.;    The Justy, which averages 41 mpg, sustains far greater
damage than the Crown Victoria, which gets 23.5 mpg.;    "While smaller cars
can save gas, U.S. government safety experts say they could cost you something
far more precious," a voice intones. "Fuel economy is important, but safety is
vital.";    Supporters of tougher fuel-economy standards insist they can be
met without reducing car size.;    "The auto industry lied when they said they
couldn't put seat belts in cars or air bags or catalytic converters," Becker
said. "And now they say they can't make a car get 40 miles a gallon."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Chrysler's Black Friday: 4,000 Layoffs at Three Sites</HEAD>

   Chrysler Corp. announced the layoffs of 4,000
workers Friday in a series of moves that included ending production
of two subcompact cars in Detroit, eliminating a shift at a
carmaking plant in St. Louis and closing a supply plant in
Wisconsin.
   The moves are part of a Chrysler plan announced earlier this
year to slash $1 billion of the company's annual $26 billion budget
by the end of 1990.
   ``I guess (Chrysler Chairman Lee) Iacocca was serious when he
said he saw a recession coming,'' independent auto analyst Dave
Healy said from New York City.
   Chrysler said it would:
   _Furlough 1,700 hourly workers at its Jefferson Avenue assembly
plant in Detroit when it ends production of its slow-selling
Omni-Horizon subcompact cars in February 1990. The fate of 250
salaried employees at the plant was undetermined, spokesman Doug
Nicoll said.
   _Eliminate one shift, about 1,900 hourly workers, at its St.
Louis No. 1 assembly plant, which makes the slow-selling LeBaron
and Daytona sports cars.
   _Close its parts subsidiary Acustar and a wire-harness operation
in Coleman, Wis., permanently laying off 400 hourly and salaried
workers.
   The work force in Detroit was stunned by the news.
   Many United Auto Workers' Local 7 members at the Jefferson plant
began working there after being laid off from other Chrysler
factories, jobs they obtained by bumping workers with less
seniority. Local leaders said they would talk with international
UAW officials this weekend about reversing the company's decision
to close the plant.
   Chrysler at first indicated it would close the Jefferson plant
in 1992, the same year a $1 billion replacement plant in Detroit is
to open. The new factory will make sport-utility vehicles, and many
of the Jefferson workers could be recalled for training to work
there beginning in fall 1991, Nicoll said. The new plant will
employ up to 3,000 people.
   Industry analysts said the greatest impact of Friday's moves
would be on the company's ability to meet corporate average fuel
economy (CAFE) standards mandated by the federal government.
   The Omni-Horizon cars were not big moneymakers for Chrysler but
their average fuel economy of 26 miles per gallon in the city and
35 miles on the highway helped balance the No. 3 automaker's gas
guzzlers, some of which fell below the 1990 CAFE of 27.5 miles per
gallon.
   ``It raises the question of how they're going to meet the
government gas mileage requirements,'' Healy said. ``The
Omni-Horizon was getting long in the tooth. It had been around for
a long time, so for today, it probably wasn't a bad business
decision.''
   Analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in New
York said he thinks Chrysler may try to reclaim some of that lost
fuel economy by making a version of its compact Dodge
Shadow-Plymouth Sundance models.
   Chrysler said Friday it would shift its marketing emphasis to
the Shadow-Sundance line but Nicoll offered no details of what was
planned by way of incentives on the cars or new offerings.
   The St. Louis shift elimination followed the UAW rejection this
week of a four-day, 40-hour work week at St. Louis No. 2, where
Chrysler's popular minivans are assembled. Chrysler wanted to
eliminate overtime in its minivan production and said 1,000 to
1,300 of the workers facing layoff at St. Louis No. 1 could have
been absorbed into the minivan production under the rejected
scheduling proposal.
   ``The UAW guys voted with their pocketbooks. They didn't want to
give up the overtime,'' Phillippi said.
   The closing of the Acustar plant comes nearly two years after
Chrysler tried to sell its parts subsidiary. UAW outrage at the
time led Chrysler to abandon the attempts to dump Acustar and move
to outside sources for its parts.
   The closing of the wire-harness production plant will force
Chrysler to buy electronic wiring for its vehicles either from
competitors or from another outside source. Electronic wiring is
among the most labor-intensive jobs in automaking.

<HEAD>Advocacy Group Says 1990 Fuel Economy Standard to Stay High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal transportation officials have decided
the 1990 fuel-economy standards should remain at the previous year's
26.5 miles per gallon, says a private auto-safety advocacy group
that wants a higher ceiling.
   The Transportation Department and National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration would neither confirm nor deny Thursday's assertion
by the Washington-based Center for Auto Safety.
   The two agencies administer the corporate average fuel economy,
or CAFE, standards.
   Meanwhile, transportation secretary-designate Samuel Skinner said
he has yet to form a judgment on fuel economy.
   Center Director Clarence Ditlow said he learned of the decison
from sources in the Transportation Department's rule-making office,
the Energy Department, General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp.
   He disclosed the 26.5 mpg figure in a letter asking President
Bush to intervene in favor of a tighter fuel-economy sandard.
   The standard would not be formally set until the agency published
a notice in the Federal Register, the government's record of
official actions.
   Neither the Transportation Department nor its subsidiary agency,
the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, would comment on
the assertion.
   The fuel-economy law was adopted in 1975 to reduce gasoline
consumption at a time of rapidly rising oil prices and requires
automakers to design the mix of vehicles in their fleets so that the
average meets or betters the fuel-consumption standard.
   The law set a goal of 27.5 mpg beginning in 1985. However, the
law also allowed the government to reduce that if the higher level
would harm automakers or if it was technologically difficult to
attain.
   If transportation officials failed to act, the standard would
revert to 27.5 mpg, a level GM and Ford Motor Co. have said is
impossible for them to meet without layoffs at big-car plants.
   Skinner said at a hearing Thursday before the Senate Environment
and Public Works Committee that the administration was committed to
an aggressive environmental program, and that the fuel-economy
standards would be ``a key ingredient'' in that program.
   ``I don't consider myself in a position to have prejudged that
issue at all,'' he said.
   The standard was set at 18 mpg for 1978 cars, rose gradually to
27.5 mpg in 1985, and then was lowered to 26 mpg in 1986 at the
request of some of the automakers. It remained at 26 mpg through the
1988 model year.
   The 26.5 mpg level for 1990 is within the range of 26 mpg to 26.7
mpg GM said it could live with.
   Ford said a 26.5 mpg level would be appropriate but called for
``changes that would bring the fuel-economy law more in line with
today's market and economic conditions.''
   Chrysler did not return calls Thursday but has said previously it
could meet the 27.5 mpg goal set by the law.

<HEAD>Ford To Meet Fuel Economy Rules Rather Than Seek Reprieve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. will meet the 27.5
miles-per-gallon fuel economy standard for its 1989 fleet rather
than seek a reduction in the standard from the federal government,
a Ford executive said.
   Ford will meet the Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE,
standard drawn up by Congress in 1975 by selling more small cars in
1989, said Philip E. Benton Jr., president of the Ford Automotive
Group.
   CAFE is the average fuel economy rating of the vehicles each
automaker sells in the United States during a model year, which
begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30.
   That means that a company whose large cars sell better than its
small cars could be penalized because its average fuel economy is
too low.
   The U.S. Transportation Department lowered the standard from
27.5 mpg to 26 mpg three years ago at the request of Ford and
General Motors Corp., the nation's two largest automakers.
   Chrysler Corp., the third-largest U.S. automaker, argued against
the change because its fleet met the 27.5 mpg standard.
   Ford and GM had argued that low, stable gasoline prices had
increased demand for larger and luxury cars. The companies
threatened to cut big car production and lay off workers to meet
the standard rather than pay stiff fines for selling the larger
vehicles.
   GM and the Automobile Importers of America, which represents all
Japanese automakers and all but two European makers, have asked
that the 27.5 mpg standard for 1989 be reduced to 26 mpg standard
that was in effect for 1986, 1987 and 1988 models.
   Benton said Ford would break with the other automakers and added
that Ford is continuously reducing the weight of its cars and
engines.
   ``We're effecting change in that way and we also are using heavy
marketing actions. We're selling every small car we possibly can to
bring down the average,'' Benton said Wednesday.
   Ford also will use credits built up in previous years when its
fleet's average fuel economy exceeded the standards, he said.
   Benton was in Monroe to present a quality award to the Monroe
stamping plant.

<HEAD>Government Economist Sees Big Economic, Pleasure Loss In Smaller
Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy would lose $4.80 for every
gallon of gas saved in steering car buyers away from the
``convenience and pleasure'' of bigger cars, according to a
government economist.
   The economist, Andrew N. Kleit, a member of the Federal Trade
Commission staff, argues that car buyers should not be induced to
give up big cars and says just as much fuel would be saved by an
additional tax on gasoline of 2 or 3 cents a gallon.
   ``People clearly get pleasure from buying large cars and I don't
see anything illicit in that at all,'' Kleit said in an interview
about his report, ``The Impact of Automobile Fuel Economy
Standards.'' He said the report represents his own views and not
those of the FTC' Bureau of Economics which published it as Working
Paper No. 160.
   At the urging of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co., the
Transportation Department lowered the standard manufactures must
meet from an average of 27.5 miles per gallon for all their cars to
26 mpg for 1986 and 1987 cars. It was kept at 26 mpg for 1988, but
will revert to 27.5 mpg for the 1989 model year unless the
department acts again.
   Kleit's study of 1986 and 1987 models, which he says represents
his own views and not those of the commission, is being used by
people who are trying to abolish these Corporate Average Fuel
Economy, or CAFE, standards.
   Congress imposed the standards in 1975 because it was spooked by
the 1973 Arab oil embargo and long gasoline lines. The standards
were meant as a fuel-saving alternative to higher taxes on fuel or
imported crude oil.
   Higher standards are supported by environmentalists who want to
see less fossil fuel burned.
   Opponents of the higher standards include auto safety proponents
who estimate that a 1 mpg increase in the standard for 1989 cars
could mean an extra 220 to 390 deaths a year for a decade. Large
cars are generally considered safer than small ones.
   To have met the higher standard in 1986 and 1987, Kleit said in
an interview, about a million buyers would have had to switch from
large to small cars. The only way to do this, he said, would have
been to raise the price of the average domestic large car by about
$1,200 and lower the price of the average domestic small car by
about $800.
   He said buyers would not have spent the $3.3 billion they were
willing to put up for the satisfaction of owning and driving larger
cars _ ``that many dollars worth of convenience and pleasure,'' as
shown by the difference in the prices of large cars people bought
and small ones they would have bought.
   Profits to U.S. manufacturers would have been $111 million less
_ declines at GM and Ford partially offset by increases at Chrysler
_ so the loss to the economy would have been the sum of the two
numbers, more than $3.4 billion, Kleit said.
   About 712 million gallons of gasoline would be saved over the
lives of the cars, Kleit calculated. So the cost per gallon saved
would have been simply $3.4 billion divided by this number of
gallons _ $4.80 in round figures. Different assumptions could make
it anywhere from $3.71 to $6.21, he said.
   ``While CAFE policy can save gasoline, it does so at a
prohibitive cost to the economy,'' Kleit wrote.
   One of his critics, Tina Hobson, head of the Renew America
Project, a group advocating conservation and use of renewable
energy sources, said Kleit's work ignored ``the need to disconnect
macho from cars. ... We need to unlink car ownership from personal
satisfaction.''
   Alan Durning of the Worldwatch Institute, coauthor of a recent
paper urging more conservation, said of Kleit's proposition, ``It's
a bit of fancy footwork about a fine point.''

<HEAD>Bill Would Abolish Fuel-Economy Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation to abolish federal fuel-economy
standards was introduced Wednesday by Rep. Bob Carr, D-Mich., who
argued that the rules cause the economy to suffer in Michigan and
the nation.
   Carr's bill, which he first introduced last year, would end the
corporate average fuel-economy regulations that require automakers
to attain a certain minimum gasoline mileage on average throughout
their fleets of passenger cars.
   ``CAFE is a government regulation that is simply not needed,''
said Carr. ``The time has come to put it aside. Without such a
change, the two largest domestic automakers face the unfortunate
prospect of having to limit or stop selling some of the most popular
cars in America today.''
   The fuel-economy standard for 1989 models is 26.5 miles per
gallon, a slightly more stringent level than the 26 mpg standard in
effect from 1986 through 1988 but below the 27.5 mpg set as a goal
by fuel-conservation legislation.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is considering
what standard to set for 1990 models. President Bush's new
transportation secretary, Samuel Skinner, told a Senate committee
this week he would review any mileage standard set by NHTSA.
   Carr's bill died last year without action by the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, whose chairman, Rep. John Dingell, also a
Michigan Democrat, has said the fuel-economy standards appeared to
be working fairly well.
   Dingell has yet to take a position on the new legislation Carr
introduced Wednesday, the committee staff said.
   ``It's an educational process,'' said Jeff Eller, a Carr aide,
when asked about prospects for the bill this year. ``We now have a
base of members who understand why CAFE should be abolished.''
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have argued for an end to
the fuel-economy standards, saying it forces them to produce smaller
cars the buying public doesn't want in order to bring their fleets
within the mileage requirements.
   The result, they have said, is layoffs at large-car assembly
plants and a lessened ability of U.S. automakers to compete with
small-body imports.
   Chrysler Corp., with a higher proportion of smaller vehicles in
its lineup, has said it can meet the 27.5 mpg standard envisioned by
the law.

   Transportation Secretary James Burnley, in a move that delighted U.S. auto makers, lowered the gasoline-mileage requirement for 1989 model passenger cars to 26.5 miles per gallon from the congressionally set standard of 27.5 mpg.

   Mr. Burnley agreed with the domestic auto industry that the tougher standard would cost U.S. jobs and help foreign manufacturers.
Keeping the 27.5 mpg standard for the 1989 model year, which applies to the average mileage for a car maker's entire fleet, "would have clearly put our domestic full-line manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage compared to some foreign manufacturers, especially Asians, who have been building only small cars and can easily meet the fuel-economy requirements," Mr. Burnley said.

   Under the secretary's decision, U.S. auto makers will be able to sell bigger cars and earn larger profits than if the congressional standards hadn't been eased.
The decision angered some environmental groups and congressmen, who argued that it would worsen the nation's already daunting environmental problems.

   The 26.5-mpg requirement, while lower than the standard set by Congress, is slightly higher than the 1988 standard of 26 mpg.
In a 1975 energy-conservation act, Congress set the fuel-economy standards for 1985 and subsequent years at 27.5 mpg.

   But Congress also gave the Transportation Department the authority to change the standard in response to changing economic, technological and energy developments.
The department has made ample use of the authority; it lowered the requirement to 26 mpg for model years 1986, 1987 and 1988.

   The nation's big auto makers applauded Mr. Burnley's decision to relax the 1989 rule.

   General Motors Corp., the nation's biggest auto maker, had asked the Transportation Department to lower the 1989 requirement to 26.5 mpg.
Without the change, GM warned, it would be compelled to cut production and lay off as many as 4,000 workers at a plant in Arlington, Texas, where the company's largest and least fuel-efficient cars are made.

   GM hailed DOT's decision as being "in the best interest of American workers and consumer choice."
But the auto maker added: "The long-term issue is whether Congress will maintain the outdated law which threatens to constrain American auto makers, limit consumer choice of U.S. produced autos and export American jobs."

   Helen O. Petrauskas, vice president of environmental and safety engineering for Ford Motor Co., said: "The rule-making recognizes that consumer preferences, resulting from low fuel prices, have placed a particularly heavy burden on our efforts to comply with the 27.5 mpg standard."

   Advocates of stricter fuel-economy standards denounced Mr. Burnley's decision.
Rep. Tim Wirth (D., Colo.) called the lowering of the standard a "short-sighted effort to promote gas-guzzling dinosaurs" and a setback for U.S. attempts to conserve energy and combat the so-called greenhouse effect, a reference to a warming of the Earth's atmosphere resulting from a build-up of carbon dioxide and other gaseous pollutants.

   Mr. Burnley's decision is "simply wrong," said Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based public-interest group often at odds with the auto makers.
He said the auto companies were bluffing in threatening to reduce big-car production in the U.S.

   Mr. Ditlow estimated that the new standard could save the car manufacturers hundreds of millions of dollars in fines that might have been imposed had they failed to meet a tougher standard.

   Even small changes in the fuel-economy target add up to big bucks for the auto makers.
Under the 1975 law, an auto maker that fails to meet the target can be fined as much as $5 for every one-tenth of a mile that its fleet's average falls below the mileage standard.
For example, if a car maker missed the standard by one-tenth of a mile and sold 3.5 million cars, it could be fined $17.5 million.

   The Transportation Department also was criticized for not going far enough in easing the standard.
The Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market advocacy group based in Washington, contended that fuel-efficiency standards should be done away with because they increase highway deaths by encouraging the production and sale of lighter cars.
The department has asked Congress to repeal the fuel-efficiency law, but lawmakers have refused to do so.

<HEAD>Toyota Exec: Won't Be Able to Tell Import From Domestic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Distinctions between domestic and imported cars
will disappear in this decade, a Toyota Motor Corp. executive said
Thursday, and Ford Motor Co. introduced what it said ushered in the
age of the ``world car.''
   During the 1990s, engineering, design and manufacturing centers
will move freely around the world, focusing in Europe, Asia and
North America, said Robert McCurry, executive vice president of
Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc., the American marketing arm for
Japan's largest automaker.
   ``Protectionist sentiments will be out of step as trade deficits
begin to balance out,'' McCurry said during the second day of a
three-day media preview of the North American International Auto
Show in Detroit.
   A few hours before he spoke, Ford officials described their
``centers of excellence'' approach that led to the development of
the 1991 Ford Escort. The car was developed in association with
Mazda Motor Corp. of Japan, which provides some of the drivetrain
and other components for the successor to one of the best-selling
cars in the 1980s.
   ``It's a new way of doing business at Ford,'' said company
executive vice president Alex Trotman.
   The ``world car,'' along with its sister vehicle Mercury Tracer,
will be built in Wayne, Mich., and Hermosillo, Mexico, and Ford
expects to sell about 500,000 of them in North America and 950,000
worldwide annually.
   Sales of Escorts have been slipping lately. In 1987 and 1988, it
was the best-selling car in the United States. In 1989, it slipped
to third place, behind the Honda Accord and the Ford Taurus. But
Escort assembly plants were down for part of the year to change
over for new models.
   One of the reasons Ford executives hope the car will catch on is
the impact that it will have on the company's corporate average
fuel economy ratings, or CAFE.
   The federal government mandates that automakers must maintain a
fleet fuel economy average of 27.5 miles per gallon during the 1990
model year or face fines. There has been speculation the minimum
will rise in coming years.
   That gives automakers an impetus to sell small, more
fuel-efficient cars. But there's a gamble involved since small cars
don't provide automakers with as much profit on a per-car basis as
larger cars. And incentives, which have become a part of buying
cars these days, can cut further into the profit margin for each
car sold.
   ``These products don't provide the normal level of profit
because of the volumes we have to maintain for CAFE,'' said Kenneth
Dabrowski, program manager for international and small car programs.
   Ford Chairman Donald Petersen said the new Escort ``couldn't be
more crucial'' to Ford's CAFE rating.
   ``It's the foundation upon which the whole Ford Motor Company
CAFE is built,'' said Ford Division General Manager Tom Wagner.
   In addition to helping the company with its average fuel economy
ratings, auto analysts said Thursday it keeps Ford in the
lower-priced, entry-level market, a market segment that Chrysler
Corp. largely is leaving when it stops production of its Dodge Omni
and Plymouth Horizon cars next month. General Motors Corp. is in
the segment with its Geo line of small cars.
   The Escort-Tracer program involves a $2-billion Ford investment.
The level of Mazda's isn't known, but analysts speculated that it
must be in the neighborhood of $1 billion. Mazda builds its 323
Hatchback off the platform used in the Ford and Mercury vehicles.

<TEXT>     Frustrated officials have had to back away from every prediction since
Sunday's midday derailment of 14 cars of a 42-car Los Angeles-to-Oakland
train. Deadly hydrazine, used in rocket fuel, was spilled.;    The wreckage
was strewn along Old Pacific Coast Highway beneath the freeway, closing
Highway 101 and forcing big-rig trucks and other travelers over winding
mountain roads that have added hours to trips.;    Opening date unknown;
"There is no projected opening for the highway. We just don't know," said
Cornell Kimball, a spokesman for the California Department of Transportation.;
   At 5:30 a.m., the drums of hydrazine posing the toxic danger were finally
trucked away from the site of the accident, 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles.
But the leaking hydrazine soaked into the ground.;    "Air and soil tests
showed some hot spots and they cordoned off those areas while they neutralized
the area," said Hoppe. The duration of the neutralizing procedure was unknown,
he said.;    The closing of Highway 101 has been a boon to businesses along

said Chamber of Commerce President Steve Cushman.;    "I'm not surprised,"
said Hoppe. "But what can I say? We'd like to have that freeway open, too.";
 Truckers suffering;  The California Trucking Association said consumers are
suffering because of the derailment, which has forced about 5,000 truckers to
take longer routes. The extra cost is about $900,000 a day, the organization
said.;    "Trucks carry 98 percent of everything made, grown or sold in
California, and 12 percent of all the truck cargo into or out of the L.A.
basin normally goes down 101 through Seacliff," said CTA spokesman Thomas C.
Schumacher.;    Hoppe would only say, "Clearly we've inconvenienced a lot of
people.";    Four of the derailed cars carried hazardous materials, including
aqueous hydrazine, a jet fuel additive that is a suspected carcinogen and can
be deadly.;    Eight drums of hydrazine burst in the derailment, spewing 440
gallons of the chemical onto the ground.;    The derailment apparently
occurred when a bearing overheated and snapped an axle off a car, triggering a
chain reaction derailment, said Claire Austin, spokeswoman for the Federal
Railroad Administration.;    It was the second Southern Pacific freight train
derailment in California this month. On July 14, a tank car derailed in the
Sacramento River Canyon, spilling a pesticide that killed wildlife along a
45-mile stretch of the river.  </TEXT>

   DETROIT -- Ford Crown Victoria, Nissan Sentra and Honda
Civic. Can you name the domestic model?
   Those who picked the Ford, go to the back of the class.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The correct answer: They are all imports. But they also
are all domestic models. It just depends on which U.S.
government agency does the classifying.
   Confused? This is just the beginning.
   Consider the Toyota Corolla and Chevrolet Geo Prizm. These
cars are virtually indistinguishable, even at close range.
They're built on the same assembly line in Fremont, Calif.
But to get maximum advantage under U.S. fuel economy laws,
General Motors Corp. calls its Prizm a domestic model, while
Toyota calls the Corolla an import. When it comes to the
"voluntary" limit on imported Toyotas, however, the
California Corollas suddenly become all-American. As
"domestic" cars, they don't count against Toyota's quota.
   If this all sounds absurd, that's because it is.
   U.S. laws governing automotive trade and fuel economy are
the regulatory equivalent of a Model T. Washington bases key
elements of the laws designed to promote fuel-efficient cars,
protect American jobs and boost sales of U.S.-made vehicles
on distinctions between "domestic" and "foreign" models.
   But these distinctions are fast becoming anachronistic as
auto makers spread their operations around the globe.
Regulators simply can't keep up with the pace of change. U.S.
and Japanese trade negotiators recently called a time-out in
their talks because they couldn't agree on a definition of
what a "domestic" American car is for tariff purposes.
"Nobody knows what anyone is talking about," despairs
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher.
   Some pundits say the answer is to scrap the old apparatus.
"What America should be worrying about is the value that
Americans add to global products of whatever putative
nationality," says Robert B. Reich, a professor at Harvard
University's Kennedy School of Government. Squabbling over
the nationality of products, he says, is "an exercise not
unlike medieval scholastics, where people worried about how
many angels could fit on the head of a pin."
   But auto executives have their own solution: "gaming," or
manipulating the government's outdated rules for maximum
profit. And as auto makers weave around the wheezing
regulatory machinery, government policies for the
environment, energy, federal deficit and American workers are
subverted.
   For example, some 400 U.S. workers lost their jobs when
Ford Motor Co. switched to foreign suppliers for a dozen or
so parts for its big, V-8-powered Crown Victoria. But now
that the car's seats, fuel tanks and windshield glass are
being made in Mexico, Ford can call the Crown Victoria an
"import." That means the car's low fuel mileage will be
averaged with that of the fuel-stingy Festiva, which Ford
buys from Korean auto maker Kia Motors Corp. Ford also
forestalls paying penalties for falling short of the U.S.
"domestic" car fuel economy standard of 27.5 miles per
gallon.
   Ford officials say moving the Crown Victoria into the
import fleet allows the company to keep selling it, and thus
avoid even more job losses. "We're being permitted to take
advantage of uncoordinated rules," says Susan Shackson, Ford
director of government policy.
   Such bureaucratic gymnastics can yield huge savings for
car companies and consumers. Playing regulators against each
other has helped auto makers offer the large, less fuel
efficient cars many Americans like -- while ducking federal
financial penalties imposed on car fleets that exceed mileage
standards. Deft maneuverings also have enabled auto companies
to duck import taxes on Japanese-built utility vehicles and
Canadian cars.
   Such regulatory ruses have far-reaching effects. The flow
of vehicles and parts across the U.S. border has turned into
a flood, nearly tripling in the last decade to $124 billion
in 1990.
   What's more, billions of dollars in auto industry
investment turn on how government regulators see the world.
   Consider the congressional debate on whether to force the
auto industry to raise sharply the fuel efficiency of its
cars.
   In the aftermath of the Gulf War, Congress has weighed a
number of proposals to wean the U.S. economy off imported
oil. One plan would require auto makers to redesign cars to
lift their average fuel efficiency by nearly 25% to 34 miles
a gallon in 2001 from the current standard of 27.5. Another
would raise the standard to 40 miles a gallon.
   The original Corporate Average Fuel Economy law, known as
CAFE (pronounced like the French word for coffee), was
enacted between oil shocks in 1975. It called for auto makers
to raise the average mileage of their cars to 18 miles a
gallon by 1978, and to 27.5 by 1985.
   Fearing huge job losses if U.S. auto makers tried to meet
the goals by importing high-mileage small cars from Japan,
the powerful United Auto Workers union pressured Congress to
forbid companies to average the fuel economies of their
imported cars with their domestically produced vehicles. Thus
was born the "dual fleet" system, which allows manufacturers
to classify as domestically produced only the cars that have
at least 75% of so-called domestic content.
   But, instead of preserving U.S. jobs, the dual fleet
system is encouraging the Big Three to move jobs connected to
big-car production offshore. Japanese auto makers, meanwhile,
say they're discouraged from employing more Americans and
buying more American parts.
   Consider Nissan Motor Corp.'s Sentra subcompact. Nissan
says the vehicle has domestic content of nearly 75% -- a
level that would make it a domestic model. Last week the auto
maker said it will raise the amount it spends on parts made
by U.S. suppliers by 40% to $3.3 billion. But that doesn't
mean the Sentra will soon become a "domestic" car. That's
because Nissan needs the Sentra, which gets up to 39 miles a
gallon, in its foreign fleet to offset its lower-mileage
Infiniti Q45.
   "To make the Sentra a domestic vehicle would be akin to
shooting ourselves in the foot," says Timothy MacCarthy,
Nissan's director of government affairs. That means it's
unlikely Nissan will bring more Sentra jobs to the U.S., he
says. "It would be foolish for us to do any more."
   Nissan's not alone. Seven Japanese companies built some
1.3 million cars and trucks in the U.S. last year. Every one
of them was considered an import for CAFE purposes, and every
one was considered domestic for the purposes of the import
restraints.
   Meanwhile, the purpose for which CAFE was created -- to
get auto makers to build more fuel-efficient vehicles -- is
being defeated. The combined fuel economy for cars, vans and
light trucks sold in the U.S. is lower now than just three
years ago, and the nation uses as much foreign oil now as it
did in 1975.
   "The things happening now were not imagined by the people
who wrote the CAFE law," says Donald Bischoff, a National
Highway Traffic Administration official.
   CAFE rules often work at cross-purposes with trade policy.
Under the U.S.-Canada Free Trade agreement, for example, cars
must be at least 50% U.S.-content to avoid paying duties at
the Canadian border.
   But what qualifies as "domestic content" under the fuel
economy rules, administered by the Transportation Department,
may not qualify as domestic under the trade agreement, which
is enforced by the Customs Service.
   The Transportation Department says marketing expenses can
be included as domestic content for fuel-economy purposes.
Customs excludes such costs, defining domestic content mainly
by the origin of a car's parts.
   Confusion over the conflicting definitions recently caused
the Treasury Department to delay a decision on whether Honda
Civic hatchbacks assembled in Alliston, Ont., should be
treated as North American cars or cars imported from Japan.
Originally set to release their decision early this month,
Treasury officials now say they need longer to sort through
the situation. At stake is $20 million in tariffs that Honda
could be forced to pay if Treasury officials decide the cars
don't meet the content requirements.
   GM and Suzuki Motor Corp. are wrestling with Customs
officials over a similar issue. The car makers want to treat
depreciation on equipment at their Ingersoll, Ont., joint
venture plant as domestic content for the two trucks produced
there, the Chevrolet Geo Tracker and Suzuki Sidekick. In a
preliminary ruling the Customs Service has said no. At stake
is a 25% tariff on each vehicle unless the two auto makers
prevail.
   Auto executives fume that the left hand of the U.S.
bureaucracy doesn't know what the right is doing. Indeed, as
U.S. officials push policies that could increase the price of
a GM product (the Tracker), other officials are helping Honda
sell more cars overseas.
   Honda wants to export some of its U.S.-built cars to
Europe as American cars. As such, they would avoid European
import quotas on Japanese cars. When French officials tried
to exclude the Ohio-made Hondas as Japanese, U.S. government
officials intervened.
   "We stated to the world, to anyone who would listen, that
they are North American cars," says Timothy O'Leary, a
spokesman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office. Asked
if the Trade Representative had stated the same to the U.S.
Department of Transportation, which considers Ohio-made
Hondas foreign cars, an official says the Transportation
Department's system has nothing to do with trade
classifications.
   In fact, automotive trade laws have loopholes so big some
auto makers are able to drive thousands of trucks through
them.
   In an effort to protect domestic truck makers, the U.S.
levies a 25% tariff on imported light trucks. But some
Jeep-like "sport utility vehicles," those with four doors,
pay the lower, 2.5% tariff for cars even though they're
marketed as trucks. Toyota, for example, pays a 2.5% duty on
four-door versions of its 4-Runner off-road vehicle, which it
sells as a truck.
   Big Three officials complain that foreign truck makers are
costing the U.S. Treasury $500 million a year by calling
their four-door sport vehicles cars. Detroit lost a fight in
1989 to have these vehicles reclassified. Apparently
undaunted, the Big Three are continuing their battle to get
the laws changed to a more favorable position for them.
Democratic Rep. Dale Kildee, whose Flint, Mich., district has
a high concentration of GM employees, is pushing a bill that
would force auto makers that classify vehicles as trucks for
one purpose to classify them as trucks for all other
regulatory purposes.
   But as Mr. Kildee's bill languishes under congressional
skirmishing, the prize for the most creative use of the
conflicting rules probably goes to Britain's Rover Group
Ltd., maker of the Range Rover sport-utility vehicle.
   The British-made Range Rover lists for more than $40,000.
But buyers don't pay the 10% luxury tax on the amount above
$30,000. That's because Rover officials got the Internal
Revenue Service to put their product in the same class of
"multi-purpose vehicles" as a Winnebago camper, exempt from
the luxury tax.
   For fuel-economy purposes, the Range Rover is a truck.
Buyers must pay a $120-per-vehicle gas-guzzler penalty, but
they would pay even more if the Transportation Department
called the Range Rover a car.
   So does the Range Rover pay the Customs Service that 25%
tariff levied on imported trucks? No. It has four doors, and
thus Customs calls it a car.
   Range Rover spokesman William Baker says the company isn't
being devious. "In our case," he says, "the vehicle doesn't
fit neatly into one category or the other."
