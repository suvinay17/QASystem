<LEADPARA>  HERE in "The Land of Enchantment" you can ski on an Apache reservation, on a
ski area designed by Los Alamos rocket scientists, or on a 12,000-foot peak
just 16 miles from the margaritas and blue corn tortillas at the Coyote Cafe
in downtown Santa Fe.;   And that doesn't even include Taos, the state's
best-known ski resort and the one that most resembles a Swiss alpine village,
or Red River, the funky little ski area up the road from Taos that's a
favorite of Texans.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Compared to Colorado, Utah or the High Sierra, New Mexico skiing is still
relatively unknown. But that's changing. Given the historic architecture,
multicultural traditions, savory cuisine, beautiful art -- and some truly
big-league skiing -- the state is rapidly gaining popularity with skiers
around the country. In fact, last ski season, New Mexico posted a new high in
total skier days (1,157,604), and three individual areas (Taos, Santa Fe Ski
Area and Angel Fire) logged their best years ever. And this was accomplished
with only eight alpine ski areas and one cross-country area. The lack of snow
elsewhere last year helped bring many first-time visitors to New Mexico ski
areas. I was one of those and I was not disappointed.;   One of the best
things about skiing in New Mexico is that you almost certainly will spend some
time in Santa Fe. If you did nothing but discover this charming city of
museums, art galleries and nationally acclaimed restaurants, you would be
fulfilled. Volumes thicker than the substantial adobe walls of the local
buildings have been written about the charms of Santa Fe. 'Tis true, 'tis
true. But on to the ski slopes:;   Taos;   For the skier, most of what little
attention New Mexico has received has been given to Taos Ski Valley, the
legendary area developed in the European style by the late Ernie Blake, a
Swiss wunderkind who used to hide tiny bottles of martinis in the trees around
Al's Rug, the showcase expert trail that dumps out at the base lodge. Given
some of the steep chutes at Taos, consumption of liquid courage might be
understandable. At this area, believe it when you see a double black diamond
run. Blake, a ski pioneer revered in the industry, developed the ski area as
his vision of the perfect ski resort. Many think he came pretty close.;   The
ski area provides breathtaking steeps and deep bowls of fluffy powder. The
immense peaks and steep terrain are what first lured Blake to the area in the
early 1950s. Some 51 percent of the terrain is rated "expert." The peak
stretches to 11,819 feet, with a vertical drop of 2,612 feet. However, Blake
also carved out open bowls and wide gentle trails (25 percent intermediate, 24
percent beginner). Eight chairlifts serve some 72 runs.;   Taos Ski Valley
(base elevation 9,207 feet) is nestled in the Sangre de Cristo ("Blood of
Christ") mountains, 20 miles from the historic Spanish town of Taos. In Taos
you can visit hundreds of shops, galleries and fine restaurants. At the
800-year-old Taos Pueblo, Native American residents live in a style close to
the pastoral existence of a bygone day.;   With an average annual snowfall of
306 inches, a lack of snow is not usually a problem. However, this year Taos
Ski Valley will increase snowmaking by 30 percent, with man-made snow possible
on 85 percent of the beginner and intermediate trails. A quad chair will
replace the Kachina lift and substantially increase uphill capacity in the
popular Kachina Bowl. An adult lift ticket is $34, multi-day, $31. The area
plans to open Nov. 28 and operate through April 5. For lodging reservations,
call (800) 992-7669.;   Ski Apache;   The ski patrolmen don't wear eagle
feathers in their caps, but with trails aptly named Geronimo, Ambush and
Apache Bowl, you get the idea. Ski Apache is not really a different kind of
ski resort, except it boasts the only gondola in the state. Located in south
central New Mexico, smack in the middle of a Mescalero Apache Reservation
bordering the Lincoln National Forest, Ski Apache might be the state's most
pleasant surprise for skiers.;   The area features the largest lift capacity
in the state and is a pleasing variety of bowl and trail skiing that offers
enough black diamond excitement for the experts and some nice blue cruisers
for intermediates. General manager Roy Parker, a 29-year ski-industry veteran,
held key jobs at Vail and Aspen before being lured by the Mescaleros in 1964
to run the area that was then known as Sierra Blanca, named for the
magnificent 12,003-foot peak that dominates the view for miles around.;   The
ski area sits on the northwest flank of the peak and the reservation boundary
parallels the Elk Ridge run and the Apache Bowl triple chair lift. Outstanding
expert runs such as Wild Onion (so good it brought tears to my eyes)and
Screaming Eagle are not actually on tribal lands. Both are reached by riding
the gondola to the 11,400-foot Gazebo. You can ski in and out of the
reservation in seconds and you'll never know the difference.;   Ruidoso, 200
miles southeast of Albuquerque and 130 miles north of El Paso, is the gateway
to Ski Apache. The ski area is just 16 miles away on a road that offers a
breathtaking ride and a chance to spot an eagle along the way. Ruidoso means
"noisy water," and is dubbed the "Year-Around Playground of the Southwest." A
food tip: When in Ruidoso, don't miss the Mountain Bayou restaurant, owned and
operated by Angela McVickers and her husband, Allen. Angela is a West Texas
beauty who trained in New Orleans, and her crawfish, chicken gumbo and
blackened salmon could dance down Bourbon Street. Allen's babyback ribs take a
backseat to none.;   The base elevation of Ski Apache is 9,600 feet
(11,500-foot summit) and the average snowfall is 185 inches a year. Advance
runs account for 45 percent of the trails, with 30 percent intermediate. The
vertical drop is 1,900 feet. Snowmaking covers 45 acres on the lower one-third
of the mountain. There are seven chairs plus the gondola. A new 3,000-foot
quad chair will operate this season along Elk Ridge, which will open up
another 150 acres of skiing. Daily lift tickets are $31 for adults ($28
multi-day) and $19 for children.;   The Inn of the Mountain Gods is a
Four-Diamond Mobil resort nestled in the Sacramento Mountains at 7,200 feet.
The scenic and serene resort is in the heart of the 460,000 forested acres of
the Mescalero reservation and is owned and operated by tribe members. Most of
the 240 rooms and suites overlook beautiful Lake Mescalero and from every
angle, the stunning, snowcapped Sierra Blanca commands the view.;   According
to Mescalero stories, the mountain was the birthplace of two sons of the
"White Painted Woman." Legend says the two grew to be brave warriors who
killed off monsters threatening the survival of the tribe. The reservation was
established in 1873 and the resort was the dream of Tribal Chief Wendell
Chino, who chose the site so that it viewed the sacred tribal grounds. The
resort opened in 1975. The resort was to provide a training ground and job
center for members of the three Mescalero Apache subtribes -- Mescalero, Lipan
and Chiricahua.;   The resort is a delight. You can do nothing, or do a lot.
One day in early March, I skied about 10 great runs, grabbed a quick lunch and
scampered down the mountain to play nine holes of golf and a set of tennis
before cocktail hour.;   A double room November through mid-April at the Inn
of the Mountain Gods runs $80; $95 during the holidays. For more information
on ski packages and lodging, call the Inn at (800) 545-9011 or the ski area,
(505) 336-4356.;   Santa Fe Ski Area;   If I could only ski one area in New
Mexico, this would be it. And for two very simple reasons: The proximity to
the quintessential Southwestern town of the same name, and, some surprisingly
tasty runs (Parachute and Thunderbird in particular) on a mountain that boasts
a base elevation of 10,350 feet and a 12,000-foot summit. With a vertical drop
of 1,650 feet, an average annual snowfall of 250 inches and close enough to
Santa Fe to smell the green chili simmering at Josie's, this is my kind of
place.;   Forty percent of the 38 runs at Santa Fe are rated expert and the
same percentage are intermediate. An adult lift ticket is $30, $27 for
multi-day. A child's ticket is $18 or $15, multi-day. Lodging packages are
available with a four-night, three-day ski package as low as $160 per person.

   ANIMAS, N.M. (AP) - Officials of the Nature Conservancy say
there are at least 718 plant species on the Gray Ranch in southern
New Mexico, along with 150 species of birds, 75 species of mammals
and 52 species of reptiles and amphibians.
   Rare species include:
   -Mammals such as the Arizona shrew, Sanborn's long-nosed bat,
southern yellow bat, southern pocket gopher, white-sided
jackrabbit.
   -Birds such as Baird's sparrow, the elegant trogon, Gila
woodpecker, McCown's longspur, peregrine falcon, spotted owl,
thick-billed kingbird and white-eared hummingbird.
   -Such reptiles and amphibians as the bunchgrass lizard, Colorado
River toad, green ratsnake, ridgenose rattlesnake and Sonoran
mountain king snake;
   -Plants ranging from the Arizona rainbow cactus to the
Chiricahua Mountain larkspur, the green-flowered fishhook cactus,
night-blooming cereus, Apache pine, Schoff's yucca, Pinaleno
Mountain plummera, Thurber campion and white-flowered visnagita.
   ``In addition to rare animals,'' says Kate Brower, New Mexico
development coordinator for the Conservancy, ``there are pronghorn
antelope, mountain lion, black bear, badger, collared peccaries,
Gould's wild turkey, desert cottontail, golden eagle, greenback and
great blue heron, coatimundi and ringtail cats.

<TEXT>
   Two brothers who suffered broken bones in a
plane crash hiked for four days through the wet, cold Chiricahua
Mountains before being rescued, authorities said.
   Robert Rowe, 52, hampered by a broken wrist, nose and ribs, and
Carl Rowe, 37, who suffered a broken foot and wrist, hiked 14 to 16
miles through rugged terrain before finding a road and hailing a
ride to safety Thursday.
   Devorie Griffiths, co-owner of the Portal store and cafe in this
small town near the New Mexico state line, said the two men were
caked with dried blood when they hobbled into the store about 9
a.m.
   ``They were pretty cut up but they appeared to be in pretty good
spirits. They were glad to be out of there,'' she said. ``It's a
miracle they are alive.''
   The Rowes were flown by helicopter to Tucson Medical Center,
where they were listed in satisfactory condition today.
   The Phoenix men were flying their single-engine Cessna 182 into
canyons scouting for deer Sunday when they found themselves without
room to maneuver. Carl Rowe, who was the pilot, was forced to crash
land the plane.
   ``It was the best landing you could have made between two
trees,'' said Robert Rowe.
   It rained and snowed in parts of the Chiricahuas this week, and
a storm front had dropped nighttime temperatures into the 20s and
30s. The men drank from streams but had no food.
   Russ Griffiths, an emergency medical technician who helped the
men, said they were ``very cold and very wet. They appeared to be
in the early stages of hypothermia and we worked to stabilize them
so they would not go into shock.''
   ``They had been hallucinating. They said they saw people -
especially children - walking around in front of them,'' he said.
   Wreckage of the single-engine plane was spotted Wednesday by a
hunter, but the bad weather hampered efforts by searchers who had
been looking for the men since the plane was reported missing
Sunday night.

<LEADPARA>  When Patrick "Hooty" Croy arrived Wednesday at the ornate old courthouse here
in the foothills of the Gold Country, he and his supporters held little hope
he could win a reprieve from a life sentence in prison for smoking marijuana.;
   But at the end of an extraordinary hourlong proceeding, during which Croy's
attorney told Placer County Judge Richard Gilbert that the sentence was so
harsh it could undermine any faith Indians might have in the courts, it was
the judge who asked for mercy.;    "Don't come in here and tell me I'm some
racist arbitrary person," Gilbert said. " . . . Show me the leniency you would
have me give Croy," the judge said, his voice dropping almost to a whisper.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 4/5/91, pg. 2A);  Because of an editor's
error, some editions of Thursday's Mercury News included a headline
incorrectly summarizing court action against Patrick "Hooty" Croy. Placer
County Judge Richard Gilbert scheduled a hearing to reconsider his order
sending Croy back to prison for life after Croy violated his probation by
smoking marijuana.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "There should be mutual forgiveness," replied Croy's attorney, Tony Serra.
"Give us another hearing.";    It was granted, and Croy, a Shasta-Karuk Indian
whose acquittal on murder charges and release from death row last year became
a symbol of justice for Indians, left the courtroom beaming, his clenched fist
raised in salute to friends and relatives.;    Judge sets April 30 hearing; 
Gilbert made no promises but indicated he would rescind his earlier order
sending Croy to back to prison for life if Croy could find a private halfway
house where he could serve his probation with some supervision. Gilbert set a
hearing on the issue for April 30.;    Placer County Assistant District
Attorney Thomas Beattie, who a day earlier had bragged confidently to a
reporter that Croy had almost no chance of changing the judge's mind, drew
loud gasps in the courtroom with an objection that giving Croy another chance
"would be like giving a dog a second chance to bite.";    Beattie's words
seemed to linger in the air, echoing in the same Auburn courthouse where an
all-white jury in 1979 had judged Croy guilty of murder.;    Serra later
called Beattie's comments "the embodiment of all the racist bias we've been
fighting for five years.";    Acquitted in cop's killing;  Croy was accused of
murder in the shooting death of Yreka police officer Jesse "Bo" Hittson during
a 1978 gunbattle at a desolate moonlit hillside in Siskiyou County. After the
1979 trial, which was moved to Placer County because of extensive publicity,
the California Supreme Court overturned Croy's conviction in 1985.;    At a
retrial last May, a San Francisco jury acquitted Croy of murder. He won his
freedom -- only the second death row inmate to do so under California's
current capital punishment law -- after presenting a "cultural defense" based
on the state's long history of racism against Indians.;    Serra successfully
argued that Croy, shot twice in the back, believed that sheriff's deputies
still harbored a frontier mentality toward Indians and wanted to kill him.
Croy shot Hittson once through the heart in self-defense, Serra said.;    
Life term suspended;  But the high court had not thrown out Croy's conviction
on conspiracy to commit murder. After the acquittal on the murder charge,
Judge Gilbert sentenced Croy to life in prison on the remaining charge. He
suspended execution of the sentence, however, and placed him on probation for
10 years. By the time Croy was released at age 33, he had served 12 years in
prison.;    When drug tests in December and again in January showed that Croy
had smoked marijuana, Gilbert ordered him back to prison to serve his life
sentence.;    On Wednesday, Serra rebuked the judge for the harshness of the
sentence and called it unprecedented.;    The order "sends out a message to
the community throughout this country that the courts are openly not fair to
Indian people," Serra charged.;     Judge visibly shocked;  Gilbert, visibly
stung by the accusation, said he had prayed Croy would be able to succeed on
his own but feared he would not.;    After the hearing Wednesday, Serra and
other supporters acknowledged that the celebrity status and massive popular
support that helped Croy gain his freedom may also have made it harder to
adjust later when, as the judge put it, the "glitter goes away.";    Bobby
Castillo, a friend of Croy's and a Chiricahua Apache Indian, said he, too, had
served many years in prison and knew how difficult it was to adjust to life
outside.;    "The first two years out were even harder than being in prison,"
Castillo said. "I was with Hooty after the first time he smoked marijuana and
he was feeling really bad. He was very lonely. You know you can be free and
still feel lonely.;    "This court wants Hooty to be assimilated into white
society. But we need to take Hooty back and be an Indian again. We need to
take him on the red road."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Beatrice: A Name For Royalty But Not For Commoners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Duke and Dutchess of York did not set a trend
by naming their daughter Beatrice _ at least not among parents who
announced the birth of a child in the Times of London last year.
   Alice and Charlotte were the most popular girls' first names
chosen by those parents, says Helen Beard, the paper's social editor.
   ``The royal birth on Aug. 8 seems to have had no effect on the
commoners' choice, at least among Times-reading parents,'' she wrote
on Monday.
   Lists of most popular names have become a favorite feature in the
paper at this time each year.
   One list _ all-names _ comprises the names that most often appear
in cases where parents give their children two or more forenames.
The second list _ first-names _ comprises only the most popular
choice of first forename chosen by parents.
   Ms. Beard wrote: ``A total of 5,531 births were gazetted (in
1988), of whom 2,659 were girls and 2,872 were boys; (in 1987), out
of a total of 5,477, boys were in a majority of 134.
   ``James again led both the first-name and the all-names leagues
for boys. Elizabeth was still way ahead in the girls' all-names
list; but she failed even to obtain a place (among the top 10) in
the first-name league, which is now jointly led by Alice (for the
first time) and Charlotte.
   ``In the all-names leagues, Henry supplanted Christopher, while
Rose, Alexandra and Lucy ousted Emma, Jane and Emily. Katherine is
back among the first names (out goes Rebecca). The list of boys'
first names and their order are little changed, but Christopher,
Robert and Henry squeezed out George and Benjamin.''
   The Times has a daily circulation of about 450,000 in this
country of 56 million people.

SHAKING YOUR FAMILY TREE: THERE'S A LOT AT STAKE IN NAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was not until the 16th Century in England and later in this country that we 
began to acquire middle names. 
</P>
<P>
These began as an additional Christian name given at confirmation ceremonies in 
the Old Country. German immigrants were the first to consistently use middle 
names in this country. In America, a boy was often given his mother's maiden 
name as a middle name. 
</P>
<P>
Middle names at first honored a maternal line; they gave an alternative to a 
common or disliked "first name" or perked up a plain name, according to Leonard 
R. N. Ashley in his new book, "What's in a Name?" (Genealogical Publishing Co., 
1001 N. Calvert St., Baltimore, Md. 21202, $21.45 postage paid). He cites 
examples of William French Smith and William Tecumseh Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley, one of the foremost scholars on names, believes that girls should be 
given middle names that connect them to maternal as well as paternal relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"It is particularly American," he says, "to reduce middle names to initials. 
The U.S. armed forces expect you to have three names: a first name, a middle 
name and a last name. If you have no middle name you'll go down in the records 
as NMI (no middle initial)." 
</P>
<P>
When choosing a middle name for your child, Ashley suggests you first see how 
the mother's maiden name sounds with the father's, and keep in mind the 
initials that will result. You might think twice about naming a child 
Christopher Isherwood Anderson, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
Using a middle name is one way to avoid the dreaded Jr., which some 
psychiatrists say gives the child a sense of being a carbon copy, not an 
original, and a name to live up to (or live down) that is not truly his. Some 
studies have shown that a child named after one of his parents stands a greater 
chance of being abused. In a Veterans Administration mental hospital, Junior 
turned up three times more often than in the general population. However, that 
1971 study is disputed, Ashley says. 
</P>
<P>
"Ideally we should abandon the 'Sr.' and 'Jr.' business just as the British 
have given up the Elder and the Younger," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Ashley has some other thoughts to consider about personal names: 
</P>
<P>
* Names exert great power. 
</P>
<P>
* Few men have grown into greatness whose names are subject to ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
* Be as considerate with the names of others, including your own children, as 
you want people to be with yours. 
</P>

Beneath the Disneyland Monorail they stood Tuesday, listening respectfully to 
the same Apache blessing that their warrior ancestors, Geronimo and Cochise, 
had heard before going into battle against the U.S. cavalry a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
Facing heavenward with closed eyes, medicine man Reppert Cassadore -- 
great-great grandson of "the Apache Kid," a 19th-Century warrior -- beseeched 
the good will of Indian spirits for the 60 Apaches who gathered around him. 
</P>
<P>
When the prayer was over, the Indians, many of them elderly people off their 
San Carlos Reservation in Arizona for the first time, blinked in wonder at the 
strange new sights. They were with 78 other Apaches from the White Mountain 
Reservation in Arizona for a long-anticipated day at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
"To them, it's a thing they will always remember -- that they can tell their 
grandchildren that Disneyland is real," said Reno Johnson, chairman of the 
White Mountain Apache Nation. 
</P>
<P>
The Apaches arrived in Anaheim on Monday night, journeying 13 hours in a bus 
across the Southwestern deserts that their forefathers used to travel bareback. 
The itinerary for their four-day stay in Orange County also included a 
first-ever visit to the beach and a day at Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
Although there were many children on the two reservations who wanted to go 
along, Elizabeth Classay, a San Carlos reservation Apache who organized the 
trip, said this was intended only for the elderly Indians because most had 
never ventured beyond the reservations. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I would be here," 95-year-old Mae Dewey marveled as Mickey 
Mouse sidled up and planted a kiss on her weathered cheek. 
</P>
<P>
Classay added: "They are getting too old. This is the first -- and maybe their 
last -- trip (to the outside world)." 
</P>
<P>
The two reservations, which sprawl over more than 2 million acres of alpine 
forests and high desert plateau, were established by the U.S. government during 
the Apache Wars of the 1870s and 1880s. Many of the older residents said they 
are descendants of Geronimo, whose band of warriors staged raids on 
stagecoaches and wagon trains out of the San Carlos Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
The Apache Wars ended Sept. 4, 1886, when Geronimo surrendered himself and 16 
warriors to Brig. Gen. Nelson A. Miles in Skeleton Canyon, near the Mexican 
border. Geronimo and 394 of his tribesmen were subsequently sent into exile in 
Florida and, for more than 20 years, were kept in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
The modern-day Apaches make a living off the land, raising cattle and hunting 
the deer, elk and bear that inhabit the higher mountain ranges of the 
reservations, Cassadore said. But he added that the reservations, like many 
others in the United States, are also plagued by high unemployment and 
alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the visiting Apaches left all of those worries at home. Each had paid 
$290 to go on this week's trip. The money was raised by the San Carlos and 
White Mountain Apache tribes selling native-made cradle boards, jewelry and 
burden baskets, Classay said. 
</P>
<P>
The Apaches stepped off two charter buses from their nearby high-rise hotel and 
into a land of fantasy. Disneyland characters, including Mickey Mouse, Minnie 
Mouse and Winnie the Pooh, greeted them. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing colorful native dress that drew stares from camera-toting tourists, 
they were then loaded aboard a convoy of antique model trucks so they could 
participate in the Main Street Parade. 
</P>
<P>
After enduring a seemingly endless photo session in front of the Sleeping 
Beauty Castle, they got around to the really important business: going on the 
rides. 
</P>
<P>
Ranging in age from early 50s to 95, the Indians mostly steered clear of 
high-adventure rides such as Splash Mountain. However, 74-year-old Alice Wesley 
didn't realize until after she had already been fastened in that the Matterhorn 
Bobsled ride was not exactly suited for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"Ohhh, it almost gave me a heart attack," she wailed afterward. 
</P>
<P>
The attraction called It's A Small World was a little less intimidating. Old, 
lined faces lit up as the ride carried them past colorful, dancing Disney 
puppets all singing "It's a Small World." 
</P>
<P>
"Ohhhh. Look!" Arlene Holmes, a recreation director for the San Carlos 
Reservation, said with laughter as a puppet Indian chief in full headdress came 
into view. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the older Indians could not speak much English. But their enthusiasm 
was marked by their repeated use of the word kayah, which Classay said is 
Apache for golly. 
</P>
<P>
Mae Dewey, who is the oldest person on either reservation, felt quite 
comfortable easing out of her wheelchair and getting on an artificial steed on 
the Disneyland merry-go-round. 
</P>
<P>
"It brings back the memories of when I was a little girl and I used to gather 
acorns in the mountains," Dewey said later. 
</P>
<P>
Seeing Dewey and her companions in their red, pink, blue and yellow native 
dress, a vacationing couple from England introduced themselves and then 
attempted to present their little daughter. Dewey, eyes twinkling in delight, 
reached out to shake the shy girl's hand -- and then suddenly pulled her close. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't be afraid," Dewey said with a laugh as the girl stared in fright. "I'm 
tame now."

<HEAD>Archaeological Site Shows First Evidence of Dental Carvings on
Child</HEAD>

   Archaeologists say the tombs of a
mysterious city have yielded the first example of the use on
children of an ancient art: carving or engraving teeth as a sign of
beauty.
   Evidence of the engraving was discovered on the teeth of a young
boy's skeleton found in the ruins of Montezuma's Balcony, whose
civilization was far more advanced than any previously thought to
exist in the region.
   Montezuma's Balcony is 310 miles north of Mexico City outside
Ciudad Victoria, capital of northeastern Tamaulipas state. Its name
is derived from that of Moctezuma, the Aztec king.
   Tamaulipas, which spent more than $53,000 on the project, plans
to open the site to the public this year.
   Two canyons and a mountain surround the remote, 12-acre city. It
is reached by a steep, rocky road that veers two miles off the main
highway to 86 huge slabs of stone named the ``grand stairway.''
   Only from the top of the stairway can the remains of more than
100 circular structures be seen, each up to 50 feet in diameter,
built from stacked and fitted rocks.
   More than 100 skeletons were found in basements, along with
ceramic fragments, food-grinding utensils, pipes, necklaces,
arrowheads, knives and small figurines.
   The remains of the boy, no older than 5, showed evidence of the
carving, called dental mutilation, in his two upper incisors and
one lower incisor.
   ``This is a very rare find,'' said Jesus Narez, director of the
Montezuma's Balcony restoration project. ``Until now, we have never
detected dental mutilations in a person this young.''
   In primitive cultures, dental mutilation is believed to be
practiced only on adults. It still is done by some Brazilian,
Indonesian and African communities.
   ``We think it hurts a lot, but . . . peyote, which was commonly
used in those times, was probably used to put the child to sleep or
dull the pain,'' Narez said.
   Several other things make Montezuma's Balcony unique, said
Narez, curator-investigator of the architectural and cultural
collections of northern Mexico at the National Museum of
Anthropology and History in Mexico City.
   He said two groups of people lived there: the Grassiles, thin
and fine featured, and the Robustus, big-boned and heavy.
Archaeologists chose the names.
   ``At least for now, we think they lived there together, but
radiocarbon testing is being done to determine if they were there
at the same time or if one group followed the other,'' Narez said.
   According to Narez, the city's 3,000 people probably lived
between the years 600 and 1400. The elite occupied in the
structures and were buried in their basements, and the others lived
in wooden huts, he said.
   References to Montezuma's Balcony appeared in a researcher's
report in the mid-1800s, and there was another report in the 1940s.
Work on the site began in 1988 and was completed in August.
   Although their culture was higher than others in the area, the
Montezuma's Balcony residents were not as advanced as the
Teotihuacans, Zapotecs or Mayas of southern Mexico, who built
pyramids and cities in the same period.
   Northern tribes like the Huastecas the warrior-like Chichimecas,
led more primitive, simpler lives than the people of Montezuma's
Balcony, Narez said.
   ``We never thought we'd find these types of buildings so far
north,'' he said, adding that huge pieces of rock used to build the
Montezuma's Balcony structures were moved with the aid of planks
and rope.
   ``A tribal group with limited organization would not have had
sufficient social structure to construct these buildings,'' he
said. ``They must have had chiefs, priests, workers and so on.''
   He said the site probably was chosen because only the side with
the ``grand staircase'' would have to be guarded.
   Circular structures are typical of Huastecas. Dome-like huts of
palm and wood built over basements were believed to lesson the
impact of hurricanes and cyclones.
   Montezuma's Balcony may have been part of a commercial corridor,
Narez said, because artifacts like pipes and necklaces show
influences of tribes from farther north like the Kaddo, Adena,
Apaches and Mississippians.
   He said how its people became extinct had not been determined.
   ``We can only guess at this point,'' he said. ``Climate changes
may have made it hard to get enough to eat. There may have been
frequent fighting with the Chichimecas. There may have been
illness.''

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission apologized for his conduct on an Apache reservation in
Arizona, but argued that his intentions in interviewing a
14-year-old girl there were practically heroic.
   Chairman William B. Allen, in letters released Monday by the
commission, compared himself to Lenny Skutnick, who in January 1982
dived into the icy Potomac River to save victims of an Air Florida
airliner crash in the capital.
   Allen, on orders from other commission members, wrote to Lalita
Altaha and her parents. ``I'm just an ordinary Skutnick, who dove
into the cold water when the time came,'' he said in both letters.
``I am happy I was able to do that much.''
   But the commission chairman also said he regretted the events of
Feb. 7 and apologized in another letter to the chairman of the
White Mountain Apache Nation.
   Allen and commission consultant Barry Goodfield, accompanied by
an NBC television crew, had taken the child into their car and
interviewed her after picking her up at a reservation school.
   The girl complained in the interview that she was ``an outcast''
on the reservation. She had been reared by a white family that
adopted her and took her off the reservation as a baby. A tribal
court nullified the adoption, and the girl recently was returned to
her natural parents.
   Her natural mother, Thurza Altaha, angrily brushed off Allen's
questions when he and Goodfield arrived at their home with the
girl. Mrs. Altaha called tribal police to complain that the men had
abducted the girl from her school bus.
   Tribal police got Gila County sheriff's deputies to arrest Allen
and Goodfield as they were returning to Phoenix. Deputies
confronted the civil rights official with drawn guns. Both men were
released without charges after being held for several hours.
   Allen said he went to Arizona to look into child custody matters
involving Indians. Goodfield, a psychologist who works with the
commission, also had been advising Normand and Nadine Desrocher in
their efforts to retain custody of Mrs. Altaha's daughter.
   Last week, the other seven members of the civil rights panel
demanded that Allen apologize for his actions on the reservation.
   Some commissioners also had called for his resignation, saying
he had embarrassed President Bush. Allen, in turn, suggested the
commission was an embarrassment to the president and suggested they
all resign. Four of the eight commission members are appointed by
the president and the other four by Congress; all serve staggered
six-year terms.
   Allen last week said he would not resign unless Bush personally
asked him to do so. White House spokesman Stephen Hart said Bush
had no intention of asking Allen to step down and would not have a
vacancy to fill on the commission until November.
   Bush can appoint a new chairman from among commission members
anytime he can get a majority of the commission to approve the
appointment.
   Allen, in his letter to tribal Chairman Reno Johnson, said he
had already expressed ``deep regret'' for events of Feb. 7 after
his ``false arrest.''
   ``I apologize to you again. And I would repeat it tomorrow and
the day after,'' Allen wrote, adding, ``I would insist, however,
that wherever I err I do so in the honest fulfillment of my
obligations to my country.''
   In an apology to the girl's parents, he said: ``I came as a
member of the Commission on Civil Rights, seeking information in a
matter which in my judgment is of grave importance to the safety of
the rights which you enjoy under the Constitution.
   ``I regret that my attempt to understand came at the cost of so
much publicity and confusion to you and your family.''
   On Friday, tribal attorney Claudeen Bates Arthur accused Allen
of having ``a racially discriminatory attitude about Indian
children'' and called for his resignation.
   She said Allen seemed to think it was all right ``to do this to
an Indian child on an Indian reservation, whereas you wouldn't find
such conduct acceptable in middle-class white society.''

   There is a small village north of
Albuquerque where people wait all summer to hear a siren's wail.
   It is a call to action for the Indians of Pueblo Jemez, renowned
for their ability to fight wildfires. Somewhere, there is a fire,
and the first ones to reach the town's community center will be
hired to fight it.
   ``Everybody, whether they're naked or eating or whatever, has to
run. That's when the physical training comes in handy,'' said
Lawrence Tosa, who coordinates the Jemez crews.
   Similar crews from Navajo, Hopi, Apache, Zuni and smaller tribes
are called upon each year as fires flare across the country.
Wildfires that closed Yosemite Park for the first time in its
history were battled by crews that included Apaches from eastern
Arizona.
   Other recent California fires have been fought by Northern
Cheyenne, Acoma, Santo Domingo, Taos, Mescalero and Navajo crews,
said Dennis Orrick, fire intelligence officer for the state
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.
   The Indians do everything from digging fire lines to lugging
water pumps.
   ``They're invaluable to us. If they were not available, we'd
have real difficulty finding other people to fill that void,'' said
Lee Singer, public affairs officer for the Cibola National Forest.
   ``They're really known for their ability to work, their
endurance,'' said Ray Kirgan, a fire management officer for the
Bureau of Indian Affairs.
   ``They come from the mountain region. They are hunters, they do
woodcutting, they've fought bears in the woods. They know how to do
the work without being told. It's almost automatic,'' he said.
   Kirgan, 51, should know. An Apache firefighter for 30 years, he
still can pass the strenuous step test, a physical fitness
requirement.
   Indians always have been firefighters on their own land, but it
wasn't until after World War II that they turned to firefighting
for the U.S. government as a source of income.
   ``People were back from the war and employment was down,'' said
Kirgan. ``They were living off the land and they were trying to get
some income. So they started organizing.''
   The Mescaleros Apaches of southern New Mexico were the first
Indian firefighters to be exported when they were sent to help
battle a California fire in 1948, Kirgan said. The Bureau of Indian
Affairs trained them, gave them hard hats and sent them to work
alongside the Forest Service crews.
   They were so good that ``other states just started calling,''
Kirgan said. In New Mexico each spring, 150 to 200 Mescalero
Apaches apply for firefighting jobs. About 50 are hired and go
through three days of training; they then are on call 24 hours a
day. If called to a fire, they may work 12- to 16-hour shifts for
14 days without a break. Base pay is $7.98 an hour.
   It's seasonal, undependable and dangerous work, but for Indians
like Clemente Toledo, summer firefighting is an important source of
income.
   ``You make more money in fewer hours, at a faster pace,'' said
Toledo, 32, who grows corn and chili on his farm and works at odd
construction jobs. Like most Indian reservations and pueblos, Jemez
suffers high unemployment.
   Toledo, slim and muscular, is a crew boss responsible for
coordinating about 15 men at a fire. In five years, he has been
sent to fires in Northern California, Tennessee, West Virginia and
elsewhere.
   He spent 29 days in Oregon in 1988: ``There was a lot of work, a
lot of hours, and the food was great. We were there for 29 days. On
my two days of R&amp;R, I toured the coastline, ate pizza and got
T-shirts made for the crew.''
   The Jemez crews, known as the Eagles, achieved national fame in
the 1950s and 1960s when they were recognized as the top
firefighters in the country.
   There has been one major change since that time: In Jemez and
elsewhere, women began joining the firefighting ranks in the late
1970s.
   Reyes Panana, 29, a mother of three who has been separated from
her husband for more than a year, joined the Jemez roster this fire
season after waiting for several years. She's one of 15 women
firefighters.
   The issue of women's rights didn't influence her decision to try
her hand at firefighting, she said. She just needed a job.
   And the men don't treat the women firefighters any differently,
she said.
   ``We enjoy ourselves when we get back to camp. We talk to each
other. We share. We work together,'' she said.
   When her grandfather died in 1982, Panana, a ninth-grade
dropout, looked for a way to feed and clothe her children. She took
up pottery, which she sells to tourists. But pottery doesn't bring
in much money; firefighting does.
   ``At first, my kids were scared for me to go to a fire. . . .
They started crying that first fire,'' she said.
   They had heard about the deaths of four Jemez firefighters in a
1986 car accident at an Idaho forest fire, and ``They thought I
wasn't going to come back,'' she said.
   ``Now they're excited because of the money I've been bringing
home and the things I've been buying them. I bought them bunkbeds,
clothes and shoes.''
   Tosa said his firefighters don't get hazard pay or benefits, and
he wishes they did. But, he's quick to add, ``If they went out
there for the money, they would sit around all day doing nothing
and get the same money.
   ``They are professionals. They have pride in what they're doing.
It's a family sort of attitude. They all put in the same effort,''
he said.
   ``The only reward I really hope for and pray for is to bring all
my people home standing on their own two feet. And the faces I see
on payday.''

   Hundreds of U.S. and Mexican firefighters
on Sunday battled fires that burned thousands of acres of brush and
timber on both sides of the border and raced across an Apache
Indian reservation, officials said.
   A forest fire that started in Mexico charred 6,000 acres, about
3,500 on the U.S. side of the border near Nicksville, and damaged
two structures in a park picnic area, said U.S. Forest Service
spokesman Jim Payne in Phoenix.
   The blaze, which Payne called ``a raging monster out of
control,'' also had threatened ranch homes in the Coronado National
Monument, about 50 miles south of Tucson, before they were saved by
crews who started backfires.
   Nearly 200 miles north, a second fire that was sparked by
lightning Friday in logging slash on a reservation near Cibecue had
covered more than 500 acres of timber and brush by early Sunday,
Payne said.
   South of the border, the largest fire _ more than 10,000 acres _
had been burning for more than a week in the Sierra Pinta Mountains
of Mexico's Sonora state, Payne said. Four U.S. forest officials
crossed the border to serve as advisers in fighting the blaze.
   The fire near Nicksville was burning mostly on state and federal
land in the national monument and the Coronado National Forest at
elevations above 7,000 feet, he said. Authorities were unsure what
started the blaze.
   The blaze damaged a restroom and a ramada, the Western version
of a gazebo, in a picnic area within the national monument area,
Payne said.
   About 300 firefighters battled the blaze on the U.S. side
Saturday, said Coronado National Forest spokesman Dennis
Brandolino, but another 500 to 700 firefighters were expected
Sunday from New Mexico, Idaho and nearby states. Mexican
firefighters were battling the flames on their side of the border.
   Three planes made a dozen runs to drop about 30,000 gallons of
fire retardant on the border blaze, said Joe Perea, the fire's
air-service coordinator from Moutainair, N.M.
   Intermittent high winds whipped the Cibecue fire, where about
280 firefighters were on the line Saturday night, said
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest spokesman Ken Palmrose.
   The blaze at the 6,000-foot level was burning ``heavy pine, fir
and some (scrub) oak in the canyon bottoms,'' eating away at
chaparral and other types of brush on the ridges, Palmrose said.
   The fire was being managed by an ``interagency overhead team''
with representatives from the federal Forest and Park services and
the Bureau of Indian Affairs, with consultation from the White
River Apache Tribe, Palmrose said.

   The Supreme Court, in a ruling welcomed in
Western states, said Tuesday states may tax businesses for oil and
gas extracted from Indian reservations.
   In a 6-3 decision in a case from New Mexico, the justices said
such taxes neither illegally infringe on the rights of Indians nor
do they amount to illegal multiple taxation.
   The court upheld New Mexico's authority to tax oil and gas taken
from the Jicarilla Apache reservation there. The levies were
challenged by Cotton Petroleum Inc., which also pays taxes to the
tribe for the extracted minerals.
   ``Today's ruling is a substantial and rather profound victory
for the state of New Mexico,'' said Gov. Garrey Carruthers.
   New Mexico collects about $19 million a year in such so-called
severance taxes from oil and gas and coal production on Indian land
in New Mexico.
   The court ruling also is good news for officials in Arizona,
Montana and Utah. There are some 150 cases in the four states in
which businesses with Indian mining leases say they are victims of
illegal multiple taxation _ by a state and a tribe.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, rejected
arguments that the New Mexico tax interferes with tribal economic
development by prompting producers to look off Indian reservations
for mineral deposits.
   He said a 1938 federal law, the Indian Mineral Leasing Act, does
not specifically pre-empt the power of states to tax oil and gas on
Indian lands.
   ``Any impairment to the federal policy favoring the exploitation
of on-reservation oil and gas resources by Indian tribes ... is
simply too indirect and too insubstantial to support'' a claim the
state tax is pre-empted, Stevens said.
   He also said that Cotton Petroleum, which has a lease with the
Apaches for oil and gas on the reservation, is not subject to
unfair double taxation.
   ``It is, of course, true that the total taxes paid by Cotton are
higher than those paid by off-reservation producers,'' he said.
``But neither the state nor the tribe imposes a discriminatory tax.
The burdensome consequence is entirely attributable to the fact
that the leases are located in an area where two governmental
entities share jurisdiction.''
   The high court in 1982 ruled that the Jicarilla Apaches may
impose their own severance tax on oil and gas extracted from their
reservation.
   Stevens noted Tuesday that New Mexico provides services to
Cotton Petroleum on the reservation.
   There is no constitutional requirement that the services the
company receives be equal in value to the amount of taxes it pays,
Stevens added.
   The Constitution does not demand that ``benefits received from a
tax authority by an ordinary commercial taxpayer ... must equal the
amount of its tax obligations,'' he said.
   Finally, Stevens said, the Apache tribe is not a ``state,'' and
therefore Cotton Petroleum is not subject to multiple state
taxation.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said New
Mexico is increasing its revenue ``at the expense of tribal
economic development.'' That violates federal policy, expressed in
laws and regulations, to protect Indian self-determination, he said.
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall.
   Cotton Petroleum challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some
15,000 acres of land on the Jicarilla Apache reservation.
   The company pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6 percent
of its production, and New Mexico levies taxes on the company
amounting to 8 percent of its production.
   Cotton Petroleum noted that oil and gas producers in the state
with deposits taken from non-Indian land only pay 8 percent in
taxes.
   The company said it paid $2.3 million in taxes to New Mexico
from 1981 through 1985 but received only $89,000 in services from
the state.
   The Jicarilla tribe was not a direct participant in the case. It
filed a friend-of-the-court brief expressing its opposition to the
state taxes.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Upheld a 1986 federal law imposing ``safety user fees'' on
pipeline companies that transport natural gas and hazardous
liquids. In a case from Oklahoma, the court said the law does not
give the executive branch too much of Congress' power to impose
taxes.
   _Tossed out a dispute from Minnesota over the federal
government's power to ban newspapers from publishing lists of
winners in privately run lotteries. The court said the case is moot
because the government no longer intends to enforce the ban.

Disclosure that William Barclay Allen, chairman of the Civil Rights Commission, 
was briefly arrested last month in Arizona after personally intervening in a 
child custody case has led the commission's seven other members to demand that 
he apologize to all concerned, and he has agreed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
The case involved Lalita Altaha, a 14-year-old Apache girl who had been adopted 
as an infant by a non-Indian couple, but was returned last year to the White 
Mountain Apache reservation in Arizona under a court order directing that she 
live with her natural mother. 
</P>
<P>
Without the knowledge of other commission members, Allen, and a nine-man party 
including two U.S. marshals and an NBC camera crew, took the girl off a school 
bus on the reservation on Feb. 7. Allen was later held for a short time for 
kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Stormy Meeting 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't gotten over the shock yet," said Mary Frances Berry, a member of the 
Civil Rights Commission, as she reported on the outcome of a stormy closed 
meeting the commission held Friday after a public session at which Allen called 
on all of the other members to resign. 
</P>
<P>
"I proposed a motion specifying that we could not approve or condone the 
chairman's actions and requiring that he write everyone involved, including the 
U.S. marshals and the Arizona police, stating that he was not acting within his 
authority," Berry continued. 
</P>
<P>
"He finally agreed that he had not exercised the best judgment and said he 
would write the letters, starting early this week," Berry said during an 
interview Saturday. She said that while Allen did not vote, the seven other 
members of the frequently divided commission supported this approach. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Allen Responds 
</P>
<P>
Allen, a political science professor at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont, 
Calif., said in a telephone interview from his home there Saturday that he had 
no problem with apologizing "insofar as my behavior might have contributed to a 
circus atmosphere . . . an atmosphere that I did not design, that was not my 
intention and that I did what I could to end." 
</P>
<P>
Berry said commission members learned first from Arizona legislators of the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued Feb. 9 by Reno Johnson Sr., tribal chairman of 
the White Mountain Apache Nation, Allen and the group, which included Dr. Barry 
Goodfield, a psychologist and a consultant to the commission, took the girl off 
a school bus and questioned her as cameras rolled. Five of the men later 
persuaded her to join them in a car, which her mother pursued. The girl was 
released near her mother's home, Johnson reported. 
</P>
<P>
After the mother, Thurza Altaha, complained to police, Johnson continued, 
Arizona Department of Public Safety officers stopped the two vehicles in which 
Allen and his party were riding and arrested the occupants "at gunpoint." They 
were jailed and held until Allen had satisfactorily identified himself, 
Johnson's statement said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Says He Arrived Late 
</P>
<P>
Allen said Saturday that he had intended only to ask the girl whether her 
wishes had been taken into consideration. He said he had planned a brief 
private meeting with the girl but arrived late, after she had boarded the 
school bus. 
</P>
<P>
The meeting was then held on a sidewalk by the bus, in view of the television 
camera crew, Allen said. He blamed Goodfield for suggesting to the girl that 
she could leave the reservation. Allen's account of the events, which he 
summarized in a four-page typed memo and amplified in a 22-page statement he 
read at Friday's commission meeting, made no mention of the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
In it, he said the interview led him to believe that Lalita "felt restrained 
against her will on the reservation, preferred to dwell with her foster parents 
and never had an opportunity to express the preference before a competent 
government entity." He quoted the girl as saying: "I am an outcast here." 
</P>
<P>
According to Johnson's summary, Lalita was adopted at the age of 5 months by a 
Texas couple, Normand and Nadine Desrocher, but the adoption was invalidated in 
1982 by the Arizona Court of Appeals. Last April, Johnson said, an Arizona 
court sentenced the Desrochers to three years of probation and ordered that 
they have no contact with the girl. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Demands Explanation 
</P>
<P>
On March 1, Robert A. Destro, a Democrat who is one of four commission members 
named by former President Ronald Reagan, wrote Allen to demand "a full formal 
explanation" of his "unilateral foray" onto the reservation. Destro raised 20 
questions about the incident, among them why Allen had omitted any reference to 
his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to Destro on March 3, Allen left most of the questions unanswered 
but said he would reply to them all in open session at the next commission 
meeting, which took place Friday. At that meeting, according to Berry's 
account, the commission majority objected openly to Allen's intervention. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of responding as these matters were raised and apologizing for his 
actions, Berry said, Allen attacked his colleagues. "He said we had no 
credibility," she said, "that we should all quit."

   KEYSTONE, Colo. -- A baffled skier bursts through
snow-covered trees and staggers to a stop on the heavily
wooded Porcupine run here at the Outback, Keystone Resort's
new advanced ski area. "Is there a run around here
somewhere?" he shouts. Another lost soul bounces over a large
mound of snow and crashes unceremoniously in a cloud of
powder. "Who's idea of fun is this?" he inquires angrily.
   Everyone may not be ready for them, but advanced ski areas
like Keystone's Outback are all the rage now. Ski areas
around the country are scrambling to add advanced and extreme
terrain, spending millions of dollars in the process.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new tough terrain results from improved skis and boots
that increase skier proficiency, declining lawsuits from
injured skiers, and better children's ski schools that
produce better skiers at earlier ages. Add the rising
popularity of snowboards -- surfboards for steep snowy slopes
-- and demand for tough runs seems inevitable. "Since the
advent of the snowboard, people like to pose in midair and
look very fast," says H. Devereaux Jennings, of trade group
Ski New England.
   But the advanced-terrain boom may not last long. Skeptics
note that the skiing population is aging. Older skiers, they
contend, want more intermediate cruising runs, not
knee-crunching bumps and powder. They want friendlier
services at the mountain, cushier lodging, better day care
and classier shopping, says Jerry Jones, a ski consultant
from Vail, Colo. The resorts should know this, he says, but
"they aren't looking at their own research."
   For the time being, though, extreme is in. Over the past
decade, hundreds of advanced slopes were added at
Killington's Bear Mountain in Vermont and at several resorts
in Colorado and Utah. And a host of advanced slopes have been
added in the past year.
   Crested Butte in Colorado built a new lift this year to
serve 170 acres of double-black-diamond slopes, the most
difficult ski terrain, adding to 380 existing acres of
advanced and extreme skiing. Sunday River in Maine increased
its daredevil terrain this year, and Beaver Creek, Vail's
sister resort in Colorado, added Grouse Mountain, a seven-run
black and double-black area it advertises as "1,800 vertical
feet of churning, burning, hair-raising, mogul-covered
slopes."
   And now Keystone has weighed in with its 300-acre Outback,
adding gladed slopes and steep, bumpy runs. "The sizzle of
the steak," John Rutter, Keystone's mountain manager, calls
them. "When you look at the really great ski mountains, they
all have these kinds of runs."
   The advanced runs, Mr. Rutter says, attract the coveted
local weekend skiers who viewed the Summit County resort as a
place for out-of-staters on rental skis to dally down a
beginner slope called Schoolmarm and cross their ski tips on
Checkerboard Flats -- named after Keystone's owner, Ralston
Purina Co. In focus groups, locals would flatly deny skiing
there.
   Locals prefer tougher runs with names like Plunge, Devil's
Crotch, Widowmaker, Psychopath and High Anxiety -- all runs
at other resorts. "Keystone had plenty of intermediate and
beginner terrain," Mr. Rutter says. "We needed to have
pizzazz" to attract the locals. Since the Outback opened --
at a cost of $32 million, including a restaurant -- ski
visits from locals have risen 8% from a year ago, he says.
   That strategy also worked for Sunday River, which was
known for its beginner and intermediate slopes, says a
spokesman for the resort. "We needed a showpiece expert trail
very badly." So the resort added an area that included its
White Heat trail in 1988 and beefed it up this year with
Shock Wave and Vortex, two more double-black-diamond trails.
Now the resort's average skier is advanced intermediate.
   Other ski areas are adding expert terrain because they
don't have any other choices. Most resorts sit in national
forests where only certain areas are permitted for ski use.
For Beaver Creek, the only area of the mountain open for
expansion was the slope where Grouse Mountain now sits.
"Frankly, we're working with what we've got," says Mike
Beckley, director of mountain operations at Beaver Creek, who
adds that skier surveys taken on the mountain also indicated
an untapped demand for more challenging slopes.
   Crested Butte, a small resort, couldn't afford to add
high-speed lifts and mountain-top restaurants. But it had
easy access to slopes that plunge away at 45-degree and
50-degree pitches, which qualify as "extreme" runs, and could
open them inexpensively, says Robert Gillin, resort vice
president. "We ran for daylight," he says. "This is the part
of the market where we have a natural advantage."
   Many resorts are simply convinced that demand for
demanding runs is hot. Winter Park, an area owned by the city
of Denver, plans to build a ski lift next summer to serve
Parsenn Bowl, which it calls an intermediate to advanced area
"with extreme conditions." This year, the resort's snow
tractors are filling to capacity, taking 12 people every hour
to the above-treeline bowl on Saturdays and Sundays. Last
year, only a few people ventured up.
   And while few resort executives will acknowledge its
importance, a recent reduction in liability suits also is
having an effect. In 1975, when a skier won a $1.5 million
suit against a Vermont resort, "it set the industry on its
ear," says Mr. Gillin of Crested Butte. "Ski areas began
marking off difficult areas, and difficult sections of the
mountain were taken out of inventory." But several states
have imposed limits on ski-resort liability.
   But adding more difficult terrain isn't necessarily going
to increase an area's popularity, says Mr. Jones, the
consultant. Radical skiers accustomed to Vail's famed back
bowls aren't going to switch to Keystone, which has only a
handful of double-black runs, he says.
   Not all ski operators are convinced that a lot of today's
skiers want tough runs. Statistics from the United Ski
Industries Association, they note, indicate that
18-to-24-year-olds accounted for 23.9% of skiers in 1990,
down from 28.1% in 1986.
   Snowbird, a Utah resort known for its "steep and deep"
terrain, wants to add runs that will increase its family
appeal, says a spokeswoman. The resort used to advertise that
50% of its terrain is blackdiamond, but quit emphasizing that
this year, she says. "Our long-term expansion will be done so
we're more accommodating to the intermediate skier," she
says. In addition, the resort has beefed up day-care programs
and its spa.
   At Park City, a Utah resort owned by Alpine Meadows Inc.,
better grooming and snowmaking, not advanced ski runs, have
increased traffic, says Nick Badami, president of Alpine
Meadows. In the 1970s, Park City added a tougher section of
the mountain to change its image as a mountain for wimps, he
said, "but it was a marketing ploy, to be honest with you."
   Adds Mr. Badami: "Extreme (territory) is good to have in
your brochure, but you're not going to have a lot of people
skiing on it. . . . The dollars in skiing are in intermediate
terrain."
   The theory is that with the aging skier population comes
weaker knees, thinner bones and a penchant for hot toddies by
the fire. Bernie Goldman would beg to differ. The 65-year-old
insurance underwriter in Denver can't get enough of the
toughest runs. "My wife says I'll kill myself," he says, "but
I'll die happy."

   The majestic rock you see pictured, rising 1,500 feet from the Trans-Pecos plain, is El Capitan, pride of the Guadalupe Mountains. 
Because its limestone face is too "soft" to hold the pitons that mountaineers use to hoist themselves in difficult places, it has been scaled rarely, and only by experts. 
I did not climb it. 

   I did, however, climb that small-appearing bump at the far right of the frame. 
That's Guadalupe Peak and, believe it or not, it's about 700 feet higher than El Capitan. 
It's all a matter of perspective. 

   Now, you might ask why our illustration features El Capitan while this story is about gentler-sloping Guadalupe Peak. 
The answer is that El Capitan makes a better picture. 
Gotta sell those newspapers] 

   You also might be curious about why a sensible fellow like me would want to climb a mountain of any height or configuration. 
That answer is a bit more complicated. 
Part one is that scaling Guadalupe Peak requires stamina but no technical skill; it's really just a vertical hike. 
Part two is that Ray Sokolov, who proposed the expedition, is the editor of this page. 
In other words, he's my boss. 

   In August, 1985, Ray and I hiked up 14,421-foot Mount Massive in Colorado, or, more accurately, about 14,300 feet of it. 
That was long enough ago for me to forget the blisters and sore muscles, but not long enough to have forgotten the beauty of the place and my pleasure over making it as far as we did, so I assented. 
The same thinking process, I suppose, explains why some women have more than one child. 

   We picked Guadalupe Peak because at 8,751 feet it's the highest in Texas (]), it's climbable by an average person (me), and its situation in a northern finger of the Chihuahua Desert provided an unusual mix of mountain and desert scenery. 
The Texas location also allowed us to inveigle some local talent from Texas Monthly magazine, an estimable publication, to mosey up from Austin, interpret local speech and share expertise in general, as we raced them to the summit. 

   Besides, we would fly into El Paso, just across the border from Juarez, and the Mexican food there is wonderful. 
That last point was especially persuasive. 

   More information came in a chat with Bob Valen, chief of interpretation for Guadalupe Mountains National Park. 
He explained that the range, running about 50 miles northward from West Texas into New Mexico, is geologically interesting because it isn't composed of volcanic igneous rock, like the Rockies, but the sedimentary variety, caused by the accumulation of lime deposits. 

   The lime came from the shells of zillions of aquatic beasties; millions of years ago, Guadalupe Peak and El Capitan were, first, part of an ocean reef, and, then, cliffs on the shore. 
Valens noted that sea could replace desert here again, but surmised that it might be a bit premature to start building a marina. 

   More recently, the mountains were home to the Mescalero Apache, who believed their gods dwelled on its summits, and the peaks were skirted by the Butterfield stagecoach route. 
They contain no precious metals, but around 1900 a man named Long found a chest of gold coins in a cave in one of their canyons. 
No dummy, he used them to buy a ranch in cool, green Oregon. 

   Our expedition began with a disappointment for me. 
I was met late last Monday afternoon at the El Paso airport by Ray and the Texas Monthly guys, senior editor Steve Harrigan and art director D.J. Stout. 
The three had arrived earlier and lunched in Juarez, and, still burping, didn't feel like a repeat. 

   Ray tried to assuage my hurt by offering me a bag of a barbequed pork rinds to eat on the ride to our lodgings in White's City, N.M., 135 miles thence. 
All Texans, including George Bush, loved 'em, he assured me. 
One handful, though, was enough to both confirm my general opinion of Bush and make me suspect that my companions didn't want to give me a head start, stomachwise, the next day. 

   That day dawned soon enough, hot and clear, and we were at the trail head, elevation 5,800 feet, at 7:45 a.m. Harrigan's contribution to the expedition became clear: Something of a naturalist, he identified the local flora as we climbed, and our pauses to admire it gave us chances to catch our breath without appearing to seek them. 

   Stout, young and exuberant, supplied thrills by venturing to the edges of rocky precipices. 
The rest of us told him we'd voted, 2-to-1, to go after him if he fell. 

   The abundance of desert plant life -- mainly sticklike cholla cactus, plump prickly pear and sharp-leafed agave -- was in contrast to the apparent absence of fauna. 
I inquired of Valen about this later, and was told that while the Guadalupes are home to many animal species, including raccoon, skunk, mule deer and, even, mountain lion, they were mostly nocturnal feeders with more sense than to be out in 90-degree sunshine like us. 

   Sweaty but triumphant, we reached the top around 11 a.m. to find a glorious view of the arid landscape, a metal pyramid bearing the symbols of the U.S. Postal Service and American Airlines that (strangely, we thought) honored pioneer aviators, and a box containing a log for recording climbers' impressions. 
We scanned its contents, and along with the usual stuff ("Made it]") found some poetry by a woman named Belinda, who'd been there just the day before. 

   "Mountain, I want to be in you. 
Together we could grow wild and natural things," Belinda wrote, among other, much -- steamier, lines. 

   The way down was easier on the lungs than the way up, but harder on the legs, and the rocks underfoot felt sharper. 
That's the main part I'd forgotten from last time. 
But down we loped, blooming blisters or no, and in much better time than it had taken to ascend. 
Gravity favored us, and beer beckoned. 
And there was the thought that, if we hurried, we might catch up with Belinda. 

   For the record, Mr. Klein, as lead climber for the Journal team, pushed his way past the others, trampling the lunch of two hikers in his black army boots, and won the race to the summit. 
The Texas Monthly pair made it first to the parking lot. 
Who won? 
The dispute has been submitted to the Pulitzer Prize Alpine Committee for arbitration. -- Ed.

<HEAD>Court Rules States May Tax for Oil and Gas Taken from Indian Reservations</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts grafs 22-26, In other action, with other cases.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court ruled today that states may
tax companies for oil and gas taken from Indian reservations.
   Voting 6-3, the justices handed Western states an important
victory in upholding a New Mexico tax on oil and gas taken from the
Jicarilla Apache reservation there.
   The court said the state levy does not trample on Indian rights
and is not unfair to a petroleum company _ even though the company
must pay taxes to the state and the tribe.
   The court rejected arguments that the state tax interferes with
tribal economic development by prompting producers to look off
Indian reservations for mineral deposits.
   New Mexico officials told the court the dispute is of great
concern in the West. They said there are more than 150 cases of
companies with deposits on Indian land protesting such double
taxation in Arizona, New Mexico, Montana and Utah.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said Congress
has not specifically pre-empted the power of states to tax oil and
gas on Indian lands.
   ``Any impairment to the federal policy favoring the exploitation
of on-reservation oil and gas resources by Indian tribes ... is
simply too indirect and too insubstantial to support'' a claim the
state tax is pre-empted, Stevens said.
   Stevens rejected arguments by Cotton Petroleum Inc., which has a
lease with the Apaches for oil and gas on the reservation, that it
is subject to unfair double taxation.
   ``It is, of course, true that the total taxes paid by Cotton are
higher than those paid by off-reservation producers,'' he said.
``But neither the state nor the tribe imposes a discriminatory tax.
The burdensome consequence is entirely attributable to the fact
that the leases are located in an area where two governmental
entities share jurisdiction.''
   Stevens also noted that New Mexico provides services to Cotton
Petroleum on the reservation.
   There is no constitutional requirement that the services the
company receives be equal in value to the amount of taxes it pays,
Stevens added.
   The Constitution does not demand that ``benefits received from a
tax authority by an ordinary commercial taxpayer ... must equal the
amount of its tax obligations,'' he said.
   Finally, Stevens rejected an assertion that the Apache tribe is
a ``state'' and therefore Cotton Petroleum is subject to multiple
state taxation.
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Harry A. Blackmun said New
Mexico is increasing its revenue ``at the expense of tribal
economic development.'' That violates federal policy, expressed in
laws and regulations, to protect Indian self-determination, he said.
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood
Marshall.
   Cotton Petroleum challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some
15,000 acres of land on the Jicarilla Apache reservation.
   The company pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6 percent
of its prpoduction, and New Mexico levies five taxes on the company
amounting to 8 percent of its production.
   Cotton Petroleum noted that oil and gas producers in the state
with deposits taken from non-Indian land only pay 8 percent in
royalties.
   The company said it paid $2.3 million in taxes to New Mexico
from 1981 through 1985 but received only $89,000 in services from
the state.
   Today's ruling upholds a 1987 decision by the New Mexico Court
of Appeals.
   The Jicarilla tribe was not a direct participant in the case. It
filed a so-called friend-of-the-court brief expressing its
opposition to the state tax.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Upheld a 1986 federal law imposing ``safety user fees'' on
pipeline companies that transport natural gas and hazardous liquids.
   The court reversed the ruling of a federal magistrate in
Oklahoma that the law, which allows the secretary of transportation
to impose user fees to pay for pipeline safety programs,
unconstitutionally gives the executive branch too much of Congress'
power to impose taxes.
   _ Tossed out a dispute over the federal government's power to
ban newspapers from publishing lists of winners in privately run
lotteries.
   The justices ruled 6-3 that a controversy from Minnesota has
become moot because the government no longer intends to enforce the
ban.
   The Indian reservations case is Cotton Petroleum vs. New Mexico,
87-1327.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Civil Rights Commission Chairman William
Barclay Allen said Wednesday that President Bush will have to come
to him directly if he wants him to resign.
   The White House said Bush has no intention of asking Allen to
quit but made clear that a replacement was being readied.
   ``It would make no sense for me to do it (resign voluntarily),''
Allen said in the wake of reports that Bush planned to replace him
with Arthur A. Fletcher, a moderate Republican and one of Bush's
early black political supporters.
   Allen said he has been trying to meet with Bush since the
election, but has received no response from the president or anyone
else at the White House. His term does not expire until 1992.
   During the Regan administration the civil rights panel was
criticized in Congress for adopting positions such as opposing
affirmative action programs. Allen was appointed by former President
Ronald Reagan following the death in June 1988 of the panel's
previous chairman, Clarence Pendleton.
   Allen has fueled the controversy about the commission by getting
entangled in an adoption case involving a 14-year-old Apache girl.
   White House deputy press secretary Stephen Hart said there would
be no vacancies on the commission for Bush to fill until November.
   Hart said Fletcher was ``an old friend (of Bush's) and he would
be the president's leading candidate for an opening on the
commission.''
   As for Allen, Hart said, ``The president has no intention of
asking him to resign.'' The spokesman said there had been no
discussions at the White House yet of organizational or policy
changes at the commission.
   ``It is easy for the president to name a chairman from the
sitting commissioners any time he wants,'' Allen said after
testifying before a House Appropriations subcommittee.
   He said that at a commission meeting Friday he suggested all the
members resign so the president and the Congress could set their own
civil rights agenda through new appointments. He said the other
commissioners didn't agree with him, so it would be meaningless for
him to resign alone.
   Other commission members rebuked Allen after controversy erupted
following his televised visit Feb. 7 to the White Mountain Apache
Reservation in Arizona where he was looking into a custody dispute
involving a 14-year-old Indian girl.
   The girl had been adopted and taken off the reservation as a
baby. Her mother sued to have her returned, and Allen, along with a
psychologist and an NBC television crew, went to the reservation to
interview the girl.
   Tribal authorities were outraged, calling the incident an
invasion of their sovereignty.
   In response to questioning from Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., at the
subcommitteee hearing, Allen said he went to the reservation to
gather information for the commission's study of whether tribal
leaders and the Bureau of Indian Affairs were protecting the civil
rights of the Indians.
   He said the study has been under way since 1985 following a
commission vote to investigate.
   He said he did not know the news crew was going to be there, nor
he did expect the psychologist to try to take the girl back to her
adoptive parents.
   He said he was writing letters of apology to all concerned.
   ``I apologized that evening to (Apache tribal) Chairman (Reno)
Johnson as I was coming out of the county jail,'' he said.
   Allen was arrested on kidnapping charges and held for questioning
for several hours after the girl's mother complained to authorities.
   Kolbe said he would ask for a complete investigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1969, the year man took his first steps on the moon, a young Kiowa poet 
named N. Scott Momaday stunned the literary world when he was awarded the 
Pulitzer Prize for a novel called "House Made of Dawn." 
</P>
<P>
Momaday, then an English professor at UC Santa Barbara, was so shocked he 
thought someone was playing a joke on him. His own publisher couldn't recall 
the obscure book. 
</P>
<P>
But some American Indians weren't too surprised. They knew the poet was 
destined for glory. His last name in the Kiowa language, Mammedate, means 
Skywalker, or One Who Walks Above. 
</P>
<P>
Two decades later, Momaday has written a second novel, "The Ancient Child" 
(published Oct. 25 by Doubleday), about the spiritual journey of an American 
Indian artist exploring his heritage and the mythology of his people. 
</P>
<P>
The early reviews have praised the book as a dazzling new work. And demand for 
the literary novel has been surprisingly high, considering the author has been 
out of the national spotlight. "The Ancient Child" is already in its third 
printing with more than 20,000 copies published. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased with the sales -- we can't go back to the printer fast 
enough," said Lisa Eskow, publicist for Doubleday. "We expect the book to 
continue selling quite strongly." 
</P>
<P>
Why has the 55-year-old Momaday, an important voice in American letters, been 
silent for so long? "I don't think of myself as a novelist. I'm a poet," said 
Momaday, relaxing in the living room of his large adobe house during a break in 
his book promotional tour. "It's been 20 years since I wrote 'House Made of 
Dawn,' and I think of it as an aberration. I still feel poetry is the highest 
form of literature." 
</P>
<P>
After his dazzling debut, Momaday wrote two books of poetry and two memoirs. 
None won the same widespread praise nor attention as "House Made of Dawn." 
Momaday admitted he struggled to match the artistic power of his first work. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in a state of disbelief when I heard about the Pulitzer," said Momaday. 
"It also put extra pressure on me. I had a hard time getting on with the next 
book. What could I have possibly done that would have topped it?" 
</P>
<P>
Most critics wrote highly of "House Made of Dawn." Although he thought the 
novel's narrative was flawed, Baine Kerr in the Southwest Review called it "a 
brave book" in which Momaday "mythicized Indian consciousness into a modern 
novel." 
</P>
<P>
Others condescended to it, suggesting that the fiery politics of the '60s 
swayed the Pulitzer Prize judges to select a nonwhite author. In the New York 
Times Book Review, John Leonard wrote that Momaday's book was honored because 
it was a "safe" choice, "a pet instead of a work of art." 
</P>
<P>
Momaday's friends scoff at the criticism his early work received. 
</P>
<P>
"Scott was obviously a person of great capacity and promise," said novelist 
Wallace Stegner, who taught Momaday in the 1960s when the poet was a 
creative-writing fellow at Stanford University. "It was clear he could more 
than hold his own among any writers -- minority or non-minority." 
</P>
<P>
Momaday believes the poor reviews and doubts about his novel's artistry arose 
from an ignorance of his American Indian background, a mystical culture of 
animal spirits, gourd dances and creation rituals. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of the reviews were perceptive and responsible; some were not," said 
Momaday. " 'House Made of Dawn' must have been very difficult to understand for 
writers from a more privileged experience. The Indian world is one of which 
most people know nothing." 
</P>
<P>
Like authors from James Joyce to Ralph Ellison, Momaday wrestles with questions 
of language, identity and racial ancestry in a civilization that seems to 
destroy cultural tradition rather than preserve it. 
</P>
<P>
His themes from old Indian tales and his haunting lyrical style reflect the 
cadences of Kiowa and Navajo prayers and chants. His dreamy stories and 
characters jump back and forth across time. 
</P>
<P>
Some feel Momaday's strongest writing is not in his Pulitzer Prize-winning 
novel, but in his memoirs, "The Way to Rainy Mountain" (1969) and "The Names" 
(1976). In those meditative works, Momaday makes a pilgrimage to the Devil's 
Tower rock in Wyoming, a great landmark in Kiowa myth. 
</P>
<P>
Momaday's new novel continues his journey across a magical landscape. Its hero, 
an Indian artist named Set, discovers he is the reincarnation of a Kiowa child 
of legend who turns into a bear. The bear chases seven sisters and a brother up 
Devil's Tower, but the siblings escape into the sky, forming the stars of the 
Big Dipper. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it's an unusual novel -- much different from 'House Made of Dawn,' " said 
Momaday. "It's a love story, a mythic tale. . . . It even has dime novel 
elements. And it has the old, old idea of a man searching for his identity." 
</P>
<P>
"The Ancient Child" is a largely autobiographical novel. Like Set, his 
character, Momaday is a painter who has had shows in several galleries in the 
Southwest ("I didn't make Set a brain surgeon for a reason," said Momaday, 
laughing). Like Set, Momaday believes that dreams and visions are pathways to 
one's blood ancestry and racial memory. And like Set, Momaday believes the 
violent power of the "bear spirit" dwells inside him. 
</P>
<P>
"With certain animals in the Indian cosmology, you can acquire power and 
benefit from knowing them," said Momaday. "But the bear is hostile, a 
confrontation that can only be expressed as a struggle." 
</P>
<P>
Usually the bear is dormant, said Momaday. But it often surfaces in bursts of 
anger and destructiveness, he said. Or it may flood him with a new artistic 
vitality. 
</P>
<P>
Animal spirits aside, Momaday and his publisher are pushing "The Ancient Child" 
as a quintessential American work. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine it being written in any other country," he said. "No other 
country has Indians, Wild West legends, Western landscapes . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Momaday's red adobe home is pure Americana. It squats amid sagebrush and cacti 
in a gently rolling desert area of Tucson, a short drive from the University of 
Arizona where Momaday teaches classes in literature and oral tradition. 
</P>
<P>
His cream-colored Airedale, Sabadotarde (Saturday afternoon) gallops across the 
tiled floor to greet visitors. Momaday is a tall man with slow, graceful 
movements. He wears jeans and a black shirt like Marlon Brando to hide his 
large belly. 
</P>
<P>
"Make me look a lot lighter," he said, joking with a photographer. 
</P>
<P>
The living room and den resemble a private gallery of Indian and Western 
artifacts and Momaday's own etchings and paintings. On one wall hangs an old 
Apache shield made of dried horsehide, human hair and a yellowed bear tooth. It 
looks dull and faded. 
</P>
<P>
"These things are full of power," said Momaday. "I think of them as personal 
flags, coats of armor belonging to one man, representing one man, and he must 
be true to it. 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose I hold onto these things because I'm a writer, and the imagination 
and the culture are so important to me," he said. "Somehow, I manage to keep 
one foot in those worlds." 
</P>
<P>
Momaday's facial features are clearly American Indian. But his deep, resonant 
voice -- sounding theatrical and Anglo upper-crust -- clashes with his 
appearance. He and his German wife, Regina Heitzer, have a 9-year-old daughter, 
Lore. 
</P>
<P>
"This bicultural identity came naturally to me," he said, sipping a soda water. 
"I was born into two cultures and brought up in two. I learned to exist in both 
worlds fairly early. Even though, at times, I was the only Indian in school, I 
was proud of my identity. And I got into a lot of fights with kids because of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
His father, a full-blooded Kiowa, and his mother, part-Cherokee, were 
educators, artists and writers who taught their son about the gifts of language 
and culture -- white and Indian. The family lived on and off Navajo and Kiowa 
reservations in Arizona, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Momaday attended reservation 
and Catholic schools and then college at the now-defunct Augusta Military 
Academy in Virginia. The student Momaday was well-prepared when he arrived at 
Stanford in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
People soon noticed the young writer from New Mexico. The late critic and poet 
Yvor Winters took Momaday under his wing. Francis McCullough, a classmate and 
editor of the school's literary journal, The Sequoia, would later publish 
Momaday's first novel as an editor of Harper &amp; Row. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Momaday's supporters believe his writing and celebration of the Indian 
oral tradition is a beacon to Anglo writers and readers lost in a soulless 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"The trouble with most Americans is we don't speak from within a tradition; we 
all speak from outside and try to trample tradition," said novelist Stegner, 
who lives in the Los Altos Hills near Stanford. "Scott has managed to find a 
mythological foundation for his writing, and it's served him well." 
</P>
<P>
In the world according to Momaday, his life reflects his art over and over, 
like the seasons. Each summer, he tries to make it to Oklahoma City to join the 
few living Kiowa for the gourd dance, the tribe's celebration of creation and 
mythology. 
</P>
<P>
"When the drums start rolling and the eagle-feather fan is in my hand, it's as 
if I'm going back 200, 300 years, and my father and grandfather and 
great-grandfather are dancing next to me," said Momaday. "It takes hold of you. 
It's intense and mystical, a kind of restoration. 
</P>
<P>
"I sense I am where I ought to be, and where I have always been."

   Yes, children with first names like Toto and Samatha could
outnumber Pieros and Marias by the year 2000 in a country
increasingly influenced by television and soccer.
   An Italian Catholic magazine, in a national survey, found that
names linked to religious tradition are dropping in favor of names
of popular soccer and television stars.
   Francesco Ruppi, the archbishop of Lecce, in southern Italy,
called for a return to tradition.
   ``Baptize your children after the names of their grandfathers
... Give your children the joy of celebrating their name-day,'' the
archbishop said.
   Prospettive nel Mondo, a Rome-based Catholic monthly magazine,
reported that a recent survey showed that out of 100 girls born in
the past year, only two were named Maria. There were three
Elisabeths and one Catherine.
   Out of 100 boys there was only one Piero (Peter) and two
Giovannis (Johns).
   Instead, there were more Totos, Diegos and Lothars - named after
World Cup soccer stars Schillaci, Maradona and Matthaeus.
   Most Diegos - 23 out of 100 children - were in the area of
Naples, the southern Italian city where the Argentine star plays
with local major league team Napoli.
   Salvatore ``Toto'' Schillaci, the popular forward of the Italian
national team and of Juventus of Turin, was the leading scorer in
this summer's World Cup, earning him nationwide celebrity status.
   Schillaci, in keeping with the trend, named his own baby
daughter Jessica.
   Matthaeus, who plays in Italy with Internazionale of Milan, led
West Germany to the World Cup title in July.
   There's also an increasing number of Silvios and Rauls, named
for Italian television tycoon and A.C. Milan president Silvio
Berlusconi and Raul Gardini, head of the Ferruzzi agro-industrial
group and owner of Rome's Il Messaggero basketball team.
   Many children were named after the popular figures of soap
operas, such as Sue Ellen, Pamela and J.R. (called Geiar in Italy)
of ``Dallas.'' Others were given names of movie heroes, such as
Rocky.

<TEXT>
   Judging from Tony Hillerman's books,
you might think he's Navajo, and many Navajos are surprised to
learn he's not.
   That's because Hillerman has captured American Indian cultures,
particularly Navajo, as no other novelist.
   In 1987, he was given a ``Special Friend of the Navajo'' award
to go with his Edgar Allan Poe Award for best mystery of 1973,
``Dance Hall of the Dead.'' His last two books, ``A Thief of Time''
and ``Talking God,'' have been best sellers, and he now has a $1.25
million contract with Harper &amp; Row.
   His latest book, ``Coyote Waits,'' is scheduled for June _ just
in time to start making his first movie. Hillerman has a
three-picture deal with Robert Redford. Filming starts this summer
on an adaptation of his 1982 novel, ``The Dark Wind.'' Hillerman
serves as consultant.
   The author, Redford, producers Sarah Pillsbury and Midge Sanford
and film executive Bonnie Lee toured the reservation in a rented
station wagon with Redford driving, discussing which of Hillerman's
Navajo police mysteries should be the first film.
   ``Dark Wind,'' in which Navajo and Hopi cops solve drug-related
murders, was chosen because of its mixture of two Indian cultures.
It will be directed by Errol Morris (``The Thin Blue Line'').
   ``It seemed to me that since so many people who go to movies are
the kind of people who think all Indians are alike, it would be
good to put two quite different tribes in,'' he said.
   ``I had taken for granted Redford was going to start with `Thief
of Time.' He wants to direct that one himself,'' said Hillerman,
leaning back against the antique pigeonhole desk he got from an old
hotel office. Above is the ``Friend of the Navajo'' plaque and a
framed drawing of Navajo ceremonial masks.
   On his left, above his word processor, is a map of Indian
country _ eastern Arizona, western New Mexico and southern Utah and
Colorado _ and a window overlooking a back yard terraced with old
railroad ties and bricks.
   His is a modest brick home in an average Albuquerque
neighborhood.
   Redford, reached while filming in the Dominican Republic, said
he likes working with the 64-year-old author.
   ``He is very unfettered by either success or too much trouble
around him,'' Redford said. ``He travels his own route and at his
own pace. He's rare in that he has that wonderful sense of
structure of storytelling and a very clear eye as to the real
nature of the Navajo.''
   Born Anthony Grove Hillerman on May 27, 1925, in Sacred Heart,
Okla., the son of a storekeeper, young Tony was his high school
class historian but never gave much thought to writing.
   ``I kind of liked to write and I read a lot, but I didn't know
real human beings were writers,'' he said. ``I mean writers and
writing were not something in the imagination of a kid growing up
out there.''
   The idea took seed when a wounded Hillerman returned on
convalescent furlough from France during World War II. A land mine
explosion had shattered his left leg and severely burned his left
eye. The leg still bothers him sometimes, and he never regained
full use of the eye.
   Beatrice Stahl, a feature writer for The Daily Oklahoman in
Oklahoma City, had done a story based on Hillerman's letters home,
and now she wanted to interview him. ``So I went down there and
talked to her. She told me I ought to be a writer.''
   He took her advice and studied journalism at the University of
Oklahoma. He graduated amid a flood of war-delayed students in
1948, and he couldn't find a job on a newspaper.
   ``So I took a job with an advertising agency writing radio
commercials. It was just a try-out job doing ads for Cain's Better
Coffee and Purina Pig Chow,'' he said.
   At Oklahoma he met his wife, Marie. They now have six grown
children.
   He also took a job driving a truck hauling oil field supplies.
One stop was the Navajo reservation in New Mexico. On one run, he
saw Navajos on horseback in ceremonial attire for the Enemy Way, a
soul-cleansing ritual that follows combat. They, too, were
returning veterans.
   ``Of course most of them served in the Pacific,'' he said.
   Something about them touched him, and he never forgot. From then
on, he said, New Mexico was his ultimate destination.
   When Hillerman got the chance to be bureau manager for United
Press International in Santa Fe, he grabbed it. He served as
executive editor of The New Mexican in Santa Fe after leaving the
wire service.
   During the Santa Fe stint, he covered a story in which a
Jicarilla Apache police officer was shot to death. The
investigation showed the fallen officer had coolly shifted his
revolver from his wounded arm to his good hand and had shot one of
his assailants before dying. The Indian was the model for Navajo
detective Lt. Joe Leaphorn, mainstay of Hillerman's novels.
   Hillerman had sold some non-fiction through a New York agent.
When he offered her the manuscript in the late 1960s for his first
Leaphorn novel, ``The Blessing Way,'' she told him: ``Just get rid
of all the Indian stuff.''
   ``Probably it was fairly good advice, but it wasn't what I
wanted to do,'' he said. An editor at Harper &amp; Row liked it, Indian
stuff and all. It was published in 1970.
   Navajos tell Hillerman they like his books because they're true
to Navajo culture, and the Navajos come out winners. In fact, he
said, many Navajos express surprise upon learning he's not a Navajo
himself.
   ``I run into that when I sign books around the reservation,'' he
said.
   Despite the mystery, witchcraft and violence of his books,
Hillerman bristles at any suggestion the reservation might be a
dangerous place.
   ``In the Navajo culture, all goals are toward harmony, being
peaceful, working together. People who turn against this are the
worst kind of people,'' he said when asked to define a Navajo witch.
   What does he like most about the Navajo?
   ``I like their emphasis on taking care of the family,'' he said.
``I like the dignity they give their women. I like their attitude
about material possessions. They just don't attach any importance
to them. There's the idea that if you own too much, you probably
aren't taking care of your family.
   ``I like the emphasis they have on beauty, aesthetics _ so many
Navajos seem to have a good eye for the sunset, the pleasing design.
   ``I like their sense of humor, their stoic endurance of whatever
comes down. They endure.''

<HEAD>Commissioner Rebuked Over Visit to Indian Reservation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Civil Rights Commission demanded Friday
that its chairman apologize for his actions on an Indian reservation
in Arizona last month, according to a published report.
   The chairman, William B. Allen, went to the White Mountain Apache
Reservation on Feb. 7 to look into a custody dispute involving a
14-year-old girl. Allen, a psychologist and a television crew
interviewed the girl, outraging tribal authorities who called the
incident an invasion of sovereignty.
   The New York Times reported in its Saturday editions that the
commission rebuked Allen during a closed meeting Friday, and ordered
him to write letters of apology to all involved.
   One member of the commission who attended the meeting said Allen
acknowledged he had exercised bad judgment, The Times reported.
   Allen has said he went to the reservation because he wanted
first-hand knowledge of whether the girl, Lalita Altaha, had had a
chance to express her own wishes in the custody dispute.
   The girl was adopted as an infant by a white couple, Nadine and
Normand Desrochers, but last year a court ordered that she be
returned to her natural mother, Thurza Altaha, who lives on the
White Mountain reservation.
   According to The Times' account, Allen learned of the case from
psychologist Barry Goodfield, who is a consultant to the commission
and who also had advised the Desrochers family. Allen told the
commission he went to the reservation with Goodfield, two U.S.
marshals and a camera crew which was making a documentary on Indian
adoption cases.
   Allen told the commissioners that they approached a school bus on
which Lalita was riding and asked for her, and that she agreed to
speak with them. They spoke with the girl for about 30 minutes, then
drove her in Goodfield's car to her home, where they had a ``tense''
exchange with Mrs. Altaha, Allen said.
   As Allen, Goodfield and the others were driving away from the
reservation, they were stopped by Gila County sheriff's deputies at
the request of tribal police and deteined for questioning. They were
released four or five hours later, said Sheriff Joe Rodriguez.
   Tribal chairman Reno Johnson later called the incident ``an
incursion that ... clearly violates the sovereignity'' of the tribe.
   At the commission's meeting Friday, Allen defended his actions as
an attempt to determine how tribal courts handle custody cases. The
commission then went into private session and demanded he write
letters of apology indicating that his activities were not approved
by the commission or condoned by its members, The Times reported.

   The U.S. Forest Service announced Wednesday
the addition of ``nine picturesque roads'' to a scenic byways
system in the national forests.
   Chief F. Dale Robertson said the designations cover 560 miles of
highways in seven states. The scenic byways system was established
with the announcement on July 25 of a 26-mile stretch of U.S.
Highway 64 in southeastern Tennessee in the Cherokee National
Forest.
   The nine new designations include:
   _Arizona. White Mountains Scenic Highway through 123 miles in
the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in eastern Arizona.
   Apache Trail, 78 miles along state Highway 88 on the Tonto
National Forest, less than 30 miles from Phoenix.
   Coronado Trail, 123 miles of U.S. Highway 666 from Clifton to
Springerville through the Sitgreaves National Forest.
   _California. Carson Pass Highway, 59 miles on state Highway 88
from Dew Drop to Woodfords through the Eldorado and Toiyabe
national forests in northern California.
   _New Hampshire. Kancamagus Highway, 28 miles on state Highway
112 through the White Mountain National Forest from Conway to
Lincoln.
   _New Mexico. Sandia Crest Road, 11 miles on state Highway 536
through the Cibola National Forest in central New Mexico.
   _Utah. Ashley National Forest, 45 miles on U.S. Highway 191 and
state Highway 44 from Vernal to Manila.
   Logan Canyon Highway, 39 miles on U.S. Highway 89 from Logan to
Bear Lake.
   _Wyoming. Snowy Range Highway, 29 miles on state Highway 130
through the Medicine Bow National Forest in southeastern Wyoming.

<LEADPARA>  For three weeks, 9-year-old Marco Hernandez nursed an obsession with faucets.;
   The sinks and toilets of his friends and neighbors consumed him weekdays
from school's end to bedtime. Weekends, he was out inspecting plumbing all day.  </LEADPARA>

ENVIRONMENTAL BATTLE
MEXICO CITY KIDS PLUG WATER LEAKS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "I've seen a lot of leaks," he says, gravely.;    Since late May, Marco and
about 70,000 other preteens have worked as voluntary water inspectors, the
latest vanguard in Mexico City's urgent race to save water before supplies dry
up. In the crowd of environmental catastrophes that make up this monstrous
capital -- the world's most populous and most polluted urban area -- vanishing
water has caused even more alarm than poisonous air. The problem long ago made
California's notorious water crisis look like child's play.;    Against
appalling odds, however, are a few glimmers of hope. The children's crusade,
which officials say attracted the broadest voluntary involvement ever seen in
this city, is one of several dramatic environmental measures that have lately
marked the presidency of Carlos Salinas de Gortari.;    Environmental prize;  
 On June 7, Salinas won a United Earth award, an environmental prize sponsored
by the great-grandnephew of philanthropist Alfred Nobel. The news raised
eyebrows, coming in the midst of the worst pollution season ever seen here.
Yet it recognized recent efforts by Salinas, including his promotion of
low-lead gas and the Day Without a Car program, and his decision to shut down
the 18th of March oil refinery, long condemned as a major polluter in the
capital.;    The government is just beginning to take equally dramatic action
to stem its alarming depletion of water supplies.;    Mexico City's main water
problems are its 30,000 industries and enormous population. At 20 million
residents, that population is more than two-thirds the size of California's,
and growing by as much as 1 million a year.;    Factories and people have
steadily overused a main water source, the Lerma River, forcing the government
to bring in water from 78 miles outside the city. They are also using up
underground aquifers so fast that parts of the capital are actually sinking by
as much as 12 inches a year.;    Aztecs blamed;    "It's truly alarming," says
Salvador Gonzalez, who helped plan the children's inspection program. "We can
live without electricity, but not without water.";    A lot of the blame for
Mexico City's predicament lies with the Aztecs, who in the early 14th century
chose to build their civilization on a marshy island in this mountain-ringed
plateau more than 7,000 feet above sea level. Legend has it that the Aztec
leaders were guided to the site by their god, Huitzilopochtli, whose image was
a hummingbird.;    The deity allegedly told the Aztecs they would recognize
the promised land when they came upon a lake with a small island, where an
eagle perched on a cactus was devouring a snake. The leaders found their
eagle, cactus and snake in the Valley of Mexico, and the image now adorns the
Mexican flag.;    Spaniards drained lakes;    Yet the Aztecs couldn't have
imagined how much their new city of Tenochtitlan would grow, depleting its
precious resources. The Spaniards who took over in the 16th century drained
the valley's lakes and built canals. As the city grew, that water was steadily
used up by its people.;    Today, 10 percent of Mexico's national supply of
electricity is devoted just to bringing water to city residents from
surrounding lowlands, and up from wells within the city.;    Mexico City's
water consumption is roughly 70 gallons per person per day. That's similar to
levels in the United States, but officials here say it can't continue.;   
Unlike California, Mexico has not yet rationed water or fined residential
water wasters, though there are plans to start next year. So far, authorities
have simply urged more care.;    Seeking help in spreading the word, officials
this year turned to grade schools.;    60 percent wasted;    "Close to 60
percent of our water consumption is wasted," says Tomas Goyeneche, a spokesman
for a city water-efficiency program. "The adult already has bad training in
using resources, but children can still learn.";    Children, it seems, can
also teach. Armed with baseball caps and buttons identifying them as official
H2O Superinspectors, tens of thousands of them knocked on doors through most
of May and early June. They looked for leaks, offered advice and handed out
pamphlets on water conservation and rubber gaskets for on-the-spot repairs.
They also distributed surveys for homeowners to answer, with each completed
form an extra point in their favor in a capitalwide competition.;    "The kids
were received mostly very well," says Goyeneche, "whereas I can imagine, an
adult might have gotten mad at another adult telling him not to use a hose to
wash his car.";    Walkman, Nintendo prizes;    Walkman cassette players and
Nintendo games already have been awarded to winners in participating schools
and neighborhoods. And next week, Marco Hernandez, who has visited 489 homes,
will be given a personal computer for coming in first citywide.;    Marco and
the other superinspectors, all 9 to 10 years old, have urged their friends and
neighbors to take shorter showers, replace their toilets with smaller models
and turn off sink faucets while brushing their teeth.;    "We want these
children themselves to learn a whole new way of using water," says Rosalba
Salazar, a neighborhood coordinator for the water-efficiency program.;   
Marco is a shining example of the new Mexican she has in mind.;    The boy,
who wants to join the military when he grows up, says he'll keep inspecting
homes this summer, even though the contest has ended.;    Meanwhile, city
officials keep trying to come up with more ways to save water.;    Residents
have clamored for repairs in old pipes, whose leaks are blamed for 15 percent
of daily water use. Environmentalists are calling for strict rationing.;   
Yet most analysts agree that the only truly effective step would be to reduce
the Valley of Mexico's out-of-control population growth. And so far, there's
no sign of that happening.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Firefighters finished digging a fire lane around a blaze that
burned tens of thousands of acres in Nebraska, and officials in New
Mexico tried to steer endangered trout to waters free of ash from a
nearby forest fire.
   Crews were released from sites in several Western states
Wednesday as wet weather helped firefighters bring several blazes
under control.
   ``We have rain ... it's cooler and we've got firefighters going
home. Isn't that good news?'' asked U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman
Merle Young in Utah, where three fires burning on more than 20,000
acres were subdued.
   The number of firefighters battling active blazes was expected to
fall to around 5,000 today from more than 11,000 as recently as
Tuesday, the Boise Interagency Fire Center reported. Firefighters
were winding up work in Arizona, New Mexico, California, Colorado,
Wyoming, Utah and Nebraska.
   ``Every fire that we have has been contained or will be contained
today or Friday,'' Arnold Hartigan, spokesman at the Boise center,
said this morning. ``We're doing very well with the fires.''
   The weather forecast also continued to be good, with more rain
and higher humidity in most regions, he said.
   In Colorado, a half-inch of rain fell in Boulder Canyon, helping
crews fighting a 2,000-acre fire that destroyed 37 homes and damaged
19 other buildings. The blaze was contained, or surrounded,
Wednesday and declared under control this morning. A 2,600-acre fire
in Mesa Verde National Park was controlled without damaging ruins
left by 13th century Anasazi Indians.
   But a 2,000-acre blaze in Colorado's Poudre Canyon was still to
be contained, officials said, and they weren't planning on anything
more than a brief respite.
   ``If we had two days of 98 degrees, we'd be right back where we
were Sunday,'' said fire information officer Ed Nesselroad.
   Officials in California pushed back the target for containing a
2,900-acre fire in rough terrain near Big Sur to Friday evening,
said Maeton Freel, a Forest Service spokesman. More than 900
firefighters had contained a little more than half of the blaze,
which investigators believe was started by an arsonist, he said.
   A wildfire that temporarily shut busy Interstate 15 between the
San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains east of Los Angeles was
partially contained before it could threaten a housing development,
authorities said. About 100 firefighters battled the blaze in
100-degree heat and 35 mph winds.
   Crews in northwest Nebraska used heavy equipment and shovels to
encircle a grass and tree fire in an area eight miles wide by 22
miles long.
   ``We have fully contained the fire,'' said Jerry Larson, deputy
state fire marshal. ``Full control could be a couple of days and an
exact estimate on burned acreage can be made after that.''
   After flying over the area, Larson scaled back the size of the
fire to between 50,000 and 100,000 acres from more than 100,000
acres. The Forest Service confirmed at least 48,000 acres had
burned, he said.
   The lightning-caused fire destroyed 14 unoccupied structures but
spared buildings in historic Fort Robinson, an old cavalry post
where Sioux Chief Crazy Horse was killed by his jailers.
   The blaze burned nearly half of 22,000-acre Fort Robinson State
Park, but officials planned to reopen it Friday, said state parks
chief Charles Duncan.
   ``I'm sure we'll get some people in here out of curiosity, but
this is still a beautiful place,'' he said.
   In southwest New Mexico, rainfall on Tuesday washed ash from a
10,000-acre blaze in the Gila National Forest into Diamond Creek,
threatening Gila trout, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Andrea
Garcia said.
   Biologists began luring the trout into a mile-long section of
clear water in the creek on Wednesday and planned to transfer the
fish to nearby holding areas today with helicopters and mules.
   Most fire crews headed home from the Gila fire, which was
contained Monday, as well as from two fires contained Wednesday in
El Malpais National Monument, which burned a total of about 5,400
acres, said Nancy Neskauskas of the state forestry office.
   In Arizona, firefighters hoped to contain today the last large
fires, a 800-acre fire near Lake Havasu City in the west-central
part of the state. Others began leaving for other states still
threatened by fires, and 360,000 acres in the Coconino and
Apache-Sitgreaves national forests in the northern and eastern
sections of the state were reopened to the public.
   ``We're winding down,'' said U.S. Bureau of Land Management
spokesman Gordon Warren.
   In eastern Utah, crews began going home after the 4,500-acre Ryan
Creek fire near the Colorado line was contained Wednesday evening.
Firefighters extinguished two other fires that burned nearly 18,000
acres, but officials still battled a 100-acre fire in steep terrain
in Desolation Canyon.

   The parents of two young people who
disappeared last year in New Mexico said Tuesday that a mysterious
photograph found in a Florida parking lot appears to show their
children, bound and gagged.
   Michael Henley, now 10, vanished on a turkey hunt with his
father in April 1988 in the mountains south of their hometown of
Milan, N.M. Tara Calico, now 20, disappeared five months later
while bicycling on a country road near her hometown of Belen, N.M.
   Michael's parents and Ms. Calico's mother flew to this Florida
Panhandle city to meet with police Tuesday. The mystery photo was
found June 15 in a store lot where a white van had been parked, but
the parents did not learn about it until the picture was shown
Friday on the nationally syndicated television show ``A Current
Affair.''
   After spending two hours viewing the photo and talking with
investigators, Michael's mother, Marty Henley, said she is almost
certain the boy shown tied up in the Polaroid snapshot is her son.
   ``He looks scared, real scared, but he looks healthy and I'm
grateful for that,'' Mrs. Henley said, but added, ``I don't want to
get my hopes up too high.''
   Her husband, also named Michael, was more cautious, saying he
wanted FBI experts to compare photos, but agreed the resemblance
was striking.
   ``If it's not Michael, it's a little boy who looks very much
like Michael,'' Henley said.
   The mother of Ms. Calico, Pat Doel, said she was convinced the
young woman shown in the photo was her daughter.
   She said she was relieved her daughter appeared to be healthy,
and said she wanted that message to get through to the abductor.
   ``Strange as it may seem, I would thank him for keeping her
alive,'' Ms. Doel said. ``I would thank him for taking care of her,
seeing that she's fed, seeing that she's clean. I hope he values
her life as much as we do.''
   The parents said they were frustrated that the photo _ which
could have been taken as early as April, according to police
experts _ was not enough to locate the children.
   ``It's frustrating for us to think perhaps we've got this close
and can't go any further,'' Ms. Doel said.
   Port St. Joe Police Chief Carl Richter said the FBI has agreed
to use other photographs of the children and compare them with the
photo in its Washington laboratory to confirm the identifications.
He said that police also had received dozens of other tips, but the
Henley and Calico cases were considered the only serious ones.
   He said the parents and investigators, while pleased to find the
photo, were worried about the consequences of the discovery.
   ``It could be devastating,'' Richter said. ``Whoever has the
children, if he hears about it, they may retaliate _ it's a
possibility.''
   The FBI in Albuquerque has said it is already providing
technical help to local authorities, and that as soon as an
abduction is confirmed, the agency will officially enter the case.
   The parents said they did not know when they would return to New
Mexico.
   They were alerted to the picture by friends who saw ``A Current
Affair,'' and they appeared on the show Monday. At first they were
unsure about the identifications, but Ms. Doel said that after
taking time, growth and lack of makeup into consideration, she was
convinced the girl was her daughter.
   Ms. Calico is shown in the photo beside the book ``My Secret
Audrina'' by V.C. Andrews, which the mother identified as her
daughter's favorite.

FT  27 MAR 92 / Charges fly in health leak row: Agenda eclipsed by naming of
girl portrayed in Labour broadcast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEROCIOUS row over who leaked the name of the sick child whose case was a
model for Labour's controversial political broadcast last Tuesday drove
other general election issues off the agenda yesterday.
Amid scenes of near pandemonium in the camps of both main parties, the
Conservatives and Labour vied repeatedly to take the high moral ground by
charging their opponents with cynically abusing a family's privacy for their
own political ends.
But after a series of increasingly acrimonious and rowdy news conferences
which first put Labour on the defensive, the day ended with the Tories in
the spotlight when Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, conceded
that party officials had 'helped the consultant' at the centre of the case
to contact a newspaper.
By early evening, Tory officials had felt obliged to issue a 'categorical
denial' that Mr Major had known anything of the party's contacts with the
child's family, the consultant or the media. They added: 'We did not know
the name of the child. When the consultant rang us, he did not give us the
name of the child.'
The Conservatives also admitted that they had received, but overlooked, a
fax alerting them to the imminent broadcast from the child's grandfather, a
Tory activist, nine days before the programme went out. While Central Office
insisted that this carried no mention of the girl's name, Mr Peter
Lee-Roberts confirmed last night that he had named his son-in-law.
Jubilant Labour officials refused to accept the disclaimer, however. Hinting
the Tories were responsible for the leak they demanded a public apology to
Mr Kinnock from Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative chairman, for his remark
that the Labour leader's endorsement of the broadcast had raised 'serious
questions about his leadership'.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's health spokesman, later called for Mr Waldegrave's
resignation.
The beneficiary from the bitter, two-party dogfight may turn out to be Mr
Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrats' leader, who lambasted both his rivals
for descending into 'personal vituperation and abuse' while failing to offer
'a single positive idea' for the National Health Service.
There seems little doubt, however, that the row has damaged the standing of
both main parties as the Tories have charged Labour with inaccuracy and
scaremongering, while their opponents counter-claimed that the Conservatives
were dodging the issue of NHS underfunding by 'smearing' Mr Kinnock.
Yesterday began with Labour in disarray when Mr Kinnock was swiftly
embroiled in a renewed dispute over who had identified Jennifer Bennett, the
five-year-old whose wait for ear surgery was highlighted in the broadcast.
His defence of Labour's actions turned to embarrassment, however, when his
denial that Miss Julie Hall, his press officer, had disclosed the girl's
first name to journalists was contradicted by Miss Hall herself. She
acknowledged that she had divulged the girl's first name, but had given no
further details.
Efforts to trace the 'mole' then concentrated on the two national
newspapers, The Independent and the Daily Express, which first ran stories
identifying the girl.
Last night Sir Nicholas Lloyd, the Express editor, denied that his newspaper
had obtained the name of the girl or her family from Conservative Central
Office. But he acknowledged that the paper did obtain the name of the
consultant involved 'from a Conservative source probably connected with
Central Office'.
Adding that The Independent had had the name of the consultant and the name
of the family, he said: 'I am quite confident they got those from Labour
Party sources.'
But The Independent insisted it had found the Bennetts by means separate
from the parties, the consultant, or the family. In a further twist, Sir
Nicholas later contradicted a Tory claim that the Express had known the
family's name when it first called the consultant.
As reporters continued to dig for more details of the leaks last night, the
central debate over the future of the NHS appeared to have been all but
ignored.
Labour said it had received more than 1,000 calls from sympathisers, many of
whom had volunteered stories of lengthy delays in hospital treatment.
However, several examples of these were also subject to criticism when
reporters discovered factual inaccuracies in those Labour publicised.
The Conservatives, meanwhile, attempted to make the case for their NHS
reforms by producing a number of doctors strongly supportive of the changes.
The impact of the leak row on opinion polls remained unclear last night.
Pundits believe it will be the weekend at the earliest before its effect, if
any, shows through.
It emerged last night that Mr Kinnock has issued a libel writ against The
Sun in connection with a statement in the paper today on the affair.

SKY CITY, N.M. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An autumn chill hangs over Sky City, a sun-hardened citadel of clay and rock 
that is said to be the oldest continuously occupied community in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day, hundreds of Indian dancers and potters displayed their talents 
as the Acoma Pueblo community observed the 350th annual San Esteban Feast Day 
with sprinklings of cornmeal to bless the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, most Acomas returned to their homes in the valley below. But a few, 
mostly potters, are staying on for the windy winter atop this sandstone 
stronghold 7,000 feet above sea level. 
</P>
<P>
"Up here on top of the mesa, there are 12 to 15 families that live all year 
long," said Camille Pasquale, a potter who helps guide tourists through the 
ancient fortress, which survived a 16th-Century Spanish invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Survival cost dearly -- 100 men killed, scores enslaved and many others 
punished by having a foot severed. 
</P>
<P>
It's quiet now. The stillness soaks up sound. Voices 10 feet away vanish like 
steam. A little boy, following his dog down narrow lanes, shyly sneaks glances 
at strangers. Every other doorway displays pottery. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, the tribe chooses "field chiefs" who live here with their families, 
each generally representing one of the Acomas' 14 clans. 
</P>
<P>
The Acomas say they have been here more than 1,000 years. They first settled on 
neighboring Enchanted Mesa, which was later abandoned, and then 800 years ago 
moved to Sky City, a 367-foot-high mesa that was declared a national landmark 
in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Water is still carried in, not piped. No wires bring in phone calls or 
electricity. No gas lines here. 
</P>
<P>
Like the ancient timbers used in the village's 17th-Century San Esteban Mission 
Church, the firewood for heating and cooking is hauled here from as far away as 
Mt. Taylor, 40 miles to the north. 
</P>
<P>
San Esteban Feast Day, the Acomas' big fall celebration, marked the end of the 
hot weather and the summer tourist season that brought in 200 to 300 visitors a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
On Sept. 2, a procession carried the carved wooden statue of St. Stephen from 
his church on the southwest corner of the mesa to a shrine on the central 
plaza. The shrine, as always, was decorated with cuttings of corn, aspen and 
wild daisies, flanked by guards bearing muskets dating back more than a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the shrine, tribal leaders formally accepted the Acomas' offerings of 
food to the saint. 
</P>
<P>
Then the white-buffalo dancers, each carrying a multicolored lightning bolt, 
began their celebration, their bells and silver jewelry jangling. Three men in 
white animal skins, skirts and brown leather leggings and three women in 
wrapped white buckskin leggings and floral print shifts, black skirts and white 
sash vests danced to the beat of a single drummer. 
</P>
<P>
Following them, a succession of other troupes entered in turn from different 
corners of the square, two by two, each performing in front of the shrine -- 
the women with large red dots on their cheekbones, the men with rust-colored 
swabs, for protection. Fox pelts dangled from their belts. Fir boughs adorned 
their sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
The church dominates the southwest corner of the mesa. The Acoma women helped 
Franciscan missionaries complete it from 1629 to 1640, just as they prepare it 
every year for the fiesta. 
</P>
<P>
"The women and children brought the sand from the valley up in baskets," said 
Fran Torivio, a Sky City guide and cashier at the Acoma office below. 
</P>
<P>
The walled courtyard in front of the church is a cemetery. The wall is topped 
with weathered adobe busts of warriors. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the soldiers that guard the cemetery," Pasquale said. 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers are restored annually before the fiesta with new potsherds for 
their eyes, and new smiles carved into the clay. 
</P>
<P>
Acomas would lock themselves in the church when under attack by Navajos or 
Apaches, usually around harvest time, Torivio said. 
</P>
<P>
Tourists still can climb down the ancient stairway carved in the mesa's 
northwest face, or they can ride a tour bus. 
</P>
<P>
Acomas say their ancestors arrived here from Mesa Verde in what is now southern 
Colorado. According to legend, they were told by Iatiku, mother of all Indians, 
to seek a mesa resembling the tip of an ear of corn, which symbolizes Iatiku. 
</P>
<P>
When they saw Enchanted Mesa, they believed they had arrived at the center of 
the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
By various accounts, Enchanted Mesa was abandoned after earthquakes or 
rainstorms destroyed its ancient staircase, stranding a few residents on top. 
Some died jumping or falling, others starved. Most were already down on the 
valley floor, farming. They began anew at Sky City, leaving ruins on Enchanted 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Acomas say they've been at Sky City since about 1200. 
</P>
<P>
In 1540, Spaniards came looking vainly for gold in the fabled Seven Cities of 
Cibola. It is said that the golden glint of mica window panes reflecting the 
sunset attracted the Spaniards here. 
</P>
<P>
"They thought this was the seven cities of gold, and they could see shining 
stuff in the rocks, but it's all sandstone," Torivio said. 
</P>
<P>
Juan de Onate, Spanish governor of New Mexico, claimed the area for the king. 
The affable Acomas greeted him warmly in 1598, but eventually decided to 
resist. 
</P>
<P>
When Onate's nephew, Juan de Zaldivar, stopped here shortly afterward for 
provisions, he and 12 of his men were massacred. Zaldivar's brother, Vicente, 
with a force of 70 men, quickly avenged their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the 100 Acoma men slain, 60 young girls were taken to Mexico as slaves, 
and the young men and women who remained here also were kept in servitude. Each 
adult man had a foot severed. 
</P>
<P>
In the succeeding century, the Indians sometimes took their frustrations out on 
priests, throwing a couple of clerics off the cliff behind the church. But the 
area has been peaceful since 1690. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish is not a language the Acomas generally speak, although many have 
Spanish surnames. They speak Keresan, an ancient Pueblo tongue, and English. 
</P>
<P>
Most Acomas today live in villages such as Acomita and McCartys in the 30 miles 
between Sky City and Interstate 40, about 50 miles west of Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
"Our total population is about 4,000 people, but they live in other villages 
because our other villages have electricity and running water," Torivio said. 
"That's where we have all the modern homes. That's where we have the TV, the 
shower and the microwave." 
</P>
<P>
In the old days, Acoma potters got their clay from the mountains and mixed in 
ground-up shards from old pots. They made their pots by hand and fired them in 
wood-fueled adobe kilns. 
</P>
<P>
Though many potters today use ready-made ware fired in electric kilns, the 
designs are still authentic Acoma. The Acoma style is known for its fine-line 
designs, painted with yucca-stem brushes. 
</P>
<P>
The yucca stem is chewed so that a few fibers form a primitive brush. The fewer 
the fibers, the finer the brush line. The thin, repetitive lines represent rain 
-- until recently the Acomas' only source of water, collected in natural rock 
cisterns around the mesa. 
</P>
<P>
During the peak tourism periods of summer, 20 to 30 potters sell their wares 
here, including Sky City's oldest resident, Concepcion Faustine, who is at 
least 80. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here since 1909," she said in halting English. Mostly, she speaks 
Keresan. This day, she is selling Indian fry bread and small handmade pots 
painted with brown and black designs. 
</P>
<P>
Potters still pray to Clay Woman before starting a pot. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Torivio, no relation to Fran Torivio, majored in business administration 
at the College of Santa Fe and now she and husband Mike run the family 
pottery-making business. 
</P>
<P>
"He makes the pots for me, and I do the design," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But being a field chief, a clan representative chosen to live for a year at Sky 
City, has cut into Mike's pottery-making, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jackie and Mike Torivio have a house in McCartys. 
</P>
<P>
"I go down weekly to check my answering machine and get the mail and do 
laundry, all the things that we don't have up here," she said.

   The kidnapping of a 6-year-old girl ended with the
suspect lying in the bottom of ditch and the victim's aunt standing
over him with a cocked .38-caliber pistol, authorities said.
   The aunt rescued the young victim and captured the assailant
Monday when she went looking for them, and, by chance, found them
on Lookout Mountain south of Golden near Buffalo Bill's grave,
police said.
   ``I wasn't going to shoot him or anything,'' Marla, identified
only by her first name, told The Denver Post, which described the
incident in today's editions. ``I was scared as he was.
   ``When I saw (my niece) Audrey, I didn't say anything,'' she
said. ``I just pulled the gun out and I cocked it and told him to
get out.''
   Donald Dale Lewis, 26, was being held without bail in the Denver
City Jail for investigation of first-degree kidnapping,
first-degree sexual assault and sexual assault to a child.
   Lewis, who police say is on parole for sexually assaulting a
2-year-old, was being held at gunpoint by the victim's 27-year-old
aunt when police arrived and took him into custody.
   Some last names were not contained in the Post's story because
the newspaper has a policy of not naming sexual assault victims.
   Police said the little girl was playing on the sidewalk in north
Denver with a 5-year-old cousin just before 1 p.m. Monday when a
man grabbed her, dragged her into a van and sped away. The girl's
mother and a different aunt chased the van on foot for a couple of
blocks, then called police.
   Marla said her two sisters came to her house about 1:30 p.m. to
tell her the girl had been kidnapped.
   ``I said, `We'll go look for her,''' the slightly built woman
recalled. ``I had just got out of the shower, and I went and got my
gun and I got my bullets.''
   Because of the ruckus that had been raised at the scene, Marla
figured the kidnapper would be heading out of town.
   ``I told her (the mother) we'd go to this one place, so we drove
up to Lookout Mountain.''
   While the girl's mother was calling her own mother in Elk City,
Okla., from a pay telephone atop the mountain, Marla and the other
aunt saw a van matching the description of the kidnapper's vehicle.
Marla jumped back in her car to follow it while the other aunt
stayed to tell the mother what was happening.
   Soon the van pulled over and the driver waved her by, she said.
   ``But, I got out of the car and had the gun in my pocket. And I
walked up to the car and I saw (the girl) there, and that's when I
pulled the gun out and I told him to get out of the car and told
him to get in front of the van and lie down.
   ``He lay down in the ditch in front of the van.''
   She then told her niece to get out of the van and into her car
and lock the doors. She told passers-by to call the police.
   ``I just held him there until the police came. When the police
came I just walked over to the car and hugged (the girl).''
   Marla recalled that when police arrived, she had to tell them
she didn't know how to uncock the pistol. The officer had her put
the gun on the ground.

<HEAD>Biologists Rescue Rare Trout From Ashy Creek; Fires Contained Elsewhere</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 4th graf, `The creek ...,' to restore dropped word `began.'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SILVER CITY, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Biologists on Thursday used long-handled
nets to scoop an endangered species of trout from a creek polluted
with ash from a nearly beaten wild fire. Firefighters mopped up
blazes in five other Western states.
   The Gila trout, lured into a clear section of Diamond Creek a day
earlier, were collected along a three-quarter mile stretch and put
in holding tanks on the sides of mules or horses to be taken
eventually to an Apache fish hatchery.
   ``They are hoping to remove at least 300 of the fish from the
creek and more if possible,'' said Andrea Garcia, a U.S. Forest
Service spokeswoman.
   The creek was becoming choked by ash from a lightning-caused fire
in Gila National Forest that burned more than 10,000 acres before
being contained on Monday. The blaze began June 30 and burned 50
miles northeast of Silver City.
   The fire should be controlled in two to four days, Ms. Garcia
said.
   Fires in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nebraska and Utah were
largely contained Thursday. Firefighters mostly mopped up and
monitored hot spots.
   Ash kicked up by the New Mexico blaze had settled in Diamond
Creek, choking off oxygen and possibly boosting the water's
alkalinity.
   The netted fish were to be transported in 250-gallon aerated
tanks aboard two trucks to a hatchery run by the U.S. Bureau of
Indian Affairs on the Mescalero Apache Reservation in south-central
New Mexico, said Ms. Garcia.
   She said the fish are fairly hardy.
   Gila trout once were widespread in mountain streams in the Gila
River Basin. But timber cutting, overgrazing, irrigation and the
introduction of rainbow trout have diminished their numbers.
   The fish has been on the federal endangered species list since
1967.
   The rescue was undertaken by the state Department of Game and
Fish, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service.
   In Utah, fire bosses took a wait-and-see attitude Thursday on the
state's only active wildfire, a 100-acre blaze in an inaccessible
area of Desolation Canyon, 140 miles southeast of Salt Lake City.
The fire was within a mile of an Uintah and Ouray Indian reservation
and threatened important deer and elk winter ranges, said Bureau of
Land Management district manager Gene Nodine.
   ``If the fire does make a major run, we would have to wait until
it reached a more accessible, less hazardous area to actively
suppress it,'' he said.
   Humidity rose significantly in eastern Utah, helping firefighters
subdue a 4,500-acre fire 28 miles from Grand Junction, Colo. Thirty
miles to the northwest, firefighters demobilized after battling a
15,500-acre fire for more than a week.
   In California, a fire near the Ventana Wilderness in the Los
Padres National Forest was 70 percent contained. More than 1,500
firefighters were on the firelines at the blaze, which burned 3,087
acres. Three other fires were contained.
   Five of six fires that have blackened nearly 9,000 acres in
Colorado have been declared contained. The sixth, a 2,000-acre blaze
fire in north-central Colorado near Fort Collins, was 95 percent
contained, officials said.
   In Nebraska's northwest corner, the Fort Robinson fire, which
destroyed 10,000 acres of the 22,000-acre Fort Robinson State Park,
was contained with full control expected by Friday, said Fire Chief
Bill Gartner. The blaze destroyed 14 structures and injured nine
people, none seriously.
   Arizona firefighters battled a 225-acre fire next to the Mogollon
Rim in east-central Arizona and expected to contain it on Saturday.
Every other major fire in the state was declared contained
Wednesday. Some 3,000 acres burned.

   Freezing cold iced the West today, bringing snow to the seaside
city of Monterey, Calif., while rain pelted the Midwest and
Northeast as harsh weather ushered in the first official day of
winter.
   The Arctic storm that chilled Western states most of the week
butted against warm humid air over the South to create a band of
freezing rain from central Texas to the Great Lakes, with up to an
inch of rainfall possible.
   Rain was forecast from Louisiana to southern Maine and the
entire state of Ohio was under a flood watch today.
   Snow fell from the Midwest to the California coast overnight and
temperatures dipped as low as wind-chilled 80 below in a mountain
pass near the Idaho-Montana border.
   Thousands remained without power in the Seattle area for the
fourth day and some who resorted to burning barbecue briquettes
were hospitalized with carbon monoxide poisoning.
   All of Montana had subzero temperatures today, with lows down to
45 below. ``We still have cold air coming down from the north,''
said Randy Calaway of the National Weather Service in Great Falls.
   In Nevada, temperatures fell below zero as far south as a town
called Caliente, the Spanish word for hot. Fountains on the
glittery Las Vegas Strip beat back fingers of ice in 20-degree
temperatures.
   Ice and snow prompted New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers to close
state offices in Santa Fe today, giving more than 6,000 state
workers an early holiday.
   Eight inches of snow fell at Gallup, N.M., where a recreation
center was converted to an overnight shelter for stranded
travelers. Gallup Police Chief Frank Gonzales issued an appeal to
citizens to help drunks found outdoors.
   ``Different people calling us report drunks laying out on the
sidewalks and that the snow is covering them,'' Gonzales said. ``I
wish they would help us by taking them inside, and we could pick
them up then.''
   In Wyoming, temperatures down to 40 below caused an electrical
transmission line to contract and snap early today, leaving an
estimated 10,000 people in the Jackson area without power. The
outage prevented the Jackson Hole Ski Resort from operating.
   San Francisco had a record low for the date Thursday at 34
degrees, falling one degree below the 1908 mark. In Monterey, to
the south, the snow was a rare occurrence.
   ``I think it was really great. I really like snow,'' said Althea
Heard-Thompson, a restaurant manager who described the 15-minute
snowfall as ``really light, large flakes'' that melted quickly.
   In Los Angeles, free blankets offered on Skid Row were gone by
noon Thursday, and all city shelters were filled. In downtown San
Diego, a homeless man apparently trying to keep warm suffered
severe electrical burns after crawling into a transformer box,
police said.
   The storm system was blamed for at least 13 deaths since
Tuesday, in Washington, Iowa, Oregon, California and Oklahoma.
   Snow fell heavily in the Sierra Nevada, with up to 1{ feet at
Mammoth Mountain ski area, where less than a week ago the resort
opened a soup kitchen for seasonal workers left jobless by lack of
snow.
   In Colorado, snowfall closed Wolf Creek pass and the Wolf Creek
ski area. But the weather thrilled ski industry officials.
   ``This is clearly a holiday bonus,'' said Cathy Kruzic,
spokeswoman for Colorado Ski Country USA. ``It's wonderful
powder.''
   Washington state, first hit by the Arctic storm, got no relief
today.
   ``We're packed wall-to-wall,'' said Calvin McVey, director of
the 206-bed Gospel Mission homeless shelter in Seattle, where
another 145 people slept on the floor.
   About 18,000 homes and businesses remained in the dark overnight
and utility spokeswoman Teri Van Duine said some could be without
power for the weekend.
   Five people came to Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle
with carbon monoxide poisoning after using charcoal briquettes
indoors or improperly ventilated portable heaters and generators,
spokeswoman Rena Shawver said.
   Sinking temperatures and winds gusting to nearly 60 mph snapped
power cables in Utah and up to 2 feet of new snow prompted
avalanche warnings.
   Physicians say the wind-chilled temperatures are not to be taken
lightly.
   ``Below a minus 25 degrees wind chill, that's when it's
dangerous,'' said Dr. Robert Harms, an emergency room physician at
a Sioux Falls, S.D. hospital. ``If you have exposed skin, it can
freeze in one minute or less.''
   Weather-related traffic deaths killed four people in Northern
California, five in Oregon and one in Oklahoma. In Washington, a
man was fatally crushed by a falling tree and a homeless man froze
to death in Seattle.
   An 11-year-old girl in Iowa was killed when the truck she was
riding in lost control on an ice-covered highway and was hit by a
truck.
   On the eastern side of the Arctic front, heavy rain caused the
Ohio River to flood low-lying roads.
   Two teen-agers rescued a 79-year-old woman near Whipple, Ohio,
when her car stalled in 5 feet of water. A Marietta attorney said
he may have to hire a boat to get guests to his daughter's wedding
Saturday because of flooded roads.
   Fifteen people were evacuated from their homes in northeastern
Arkansas early today when a line of strong thunderstorms caused
flooding in the towns of Paragould and Bono.

   When Chuck Yeager uses the phrase, "the right stuff," he's talking about the way golden trout tastes when you cook it over an open fire with wild onions, pulled fresh out of the ground. 
In "Press On: Further Adventures in the Good Life" (with Charles Leerhsen, Bantam, 247 pages, $17.95), he confesses that he still doesn't know what Tom Wolfe meant by the phrase when he made it the title of his best-selling book about pilots. 
"Tom Wolfe made a lot of money off it, but it's not something I've ever heard a pilot say." 

   Still, Tom's a nice guy, says Mr. Yeager, though maybe a bit too abstruse: "I never understood a lot of what he was driving at. 
Once, a few years ago, he sent me a bunch of his books to read, but I never got past the titles, they were so weird. 'Velvet Gloves and Mauve Something' was one, I think. 
I prefer Louis L'Amour any day." 

   Mauve doesn't fit into the color scheme of Mr. Yeager's life. 
Blue, brown and green are his shades, though the plane he broke the sound barrier in was orange. 
"Press On" is mostly a series of fun and exhilarating stories about Mr. Yeager in the out-of-doors. 
The best chapter is the first, in which he describes his life-long love affair with a mountain range, the Sierra Nevada. 
"My annual trip into the Sierras is now the central event of my life," he says. 
Once he took relaxing camping trips in those mountains, time off from the exhaustion of flying, but now his journeys have become more rugged, with 18-mile-a-day hikes up bloodying terrain, and only what dinner you can catch. 
"They have evolved into more like military missions," Mr. Yeager writes. 

   Mr. Yeager savors his paradoxes: that his vacations seem like slave labor, that pain and challenge are resources out of which his happiness is made, that killing animals is consistent with environmentalism, rightly understood. 

   He is really advocating a lifestyle in this book more than systematically recording a life. 
He has not led a model existence -- restless and independent, he apparently didn't have much time for his young children -- but it has been a great life for storytellers, both for Tom Wolfe and for himself. 
"Press On" is cleansing reading for those of us stuck with lives too much dominated by those Mauve Somethings.

   The funniest comic strip these days is "Calvin and Hobbes" by Bill Waterson. 
It is about a six-year-old terror named Calvin -- a little maniac the way we all hope we were as six-year-olds. 
His best friend is a tiger named Hobbes, though when other people are around, Hobbes turns into a stuffed tiger doll. 

   The genius of "Calvin and Hobbes" is that it captures kids the way they authentically are, not as the cute little creatures adults see -- the ones who say the darndest things. 
It is not perverse in Mr. Waterson's view that a little boy would have a tiger for a buddy; it is perverse that other people would see this tiger as a rag doll. 
For Calvin the world of make-believe is the real world. 
The annoying part is that it keeps getting interrupted by the world of grown-ups. 
First thing you know a giant prehistoric monster has risen from the ocean, heading for power lines, leaving a trail of destruction in its path. 
The monster comes upon its archrival Megalon and spews out a mighty ball of fire. 
Next thing you know, Calvin's mom is chasing him back up the stairs, trying to get him back in the bathtub. 

   Literati complain because best-seller lists are dominated by books of comic strips. 
If they are all as good as "The Essential Calvin and Hobbes" (Andrews &amp;McMeel, 255 pages, $12.95), you will be hearing no complaints from me.

   Relatives of two New Mexico youths who
vanished last year said Sunday they're pretty sure their children
were shown gagged in a mysterious photograph that appeared on
national television last week.
   The ``tabloid'' television news show ``A Current Affair''
broadcast Friday in New Mexico had a segment on the mystery
picture, a Polaroid snapshot found June 15 in the Florida Panhandle
city of Port St. Joe.
   The relatives of Tara Calico and Michael Henley Jr. believe the
picture is the first evidence that the missing youths are still
alive, perhaps in captivity in Florida.
   Tara was 19 when she disappeared in September while bicycling on
a country road near Belen, about 30 miles south of Albuquerque in
central New Mexico.
   Michael Henley Jr. was 10 when he disappeared on a camping trip
with his father in the Zuni Mountains south of Grants, about 70
miles west of Albuquerque in April 1988.
   The picture shows a young woman and boy with gags taped across
their mouths, lying with their arms behind them. They are shown in
a white van, Cibola County (N.M.) Sheriff Ed Craig said Sunday.
   ``It's the best lead we've had in 16 months,'' Craig said. Until
now, he said, there had been no sign of a kidnap in the boy's
disappearance. It was generally assumed he had become lost in the
wilderness.
   Reportedly, the woman who found the photo in a store parking lot
said a white van had been parked over the spot where the picture
was found.
   ``If I had to say yes or no, I would say yes, but I am
qualifying it until I see the photo,'' Tara's mother, Pat Doel,
said Sunday.
   The search for Ms. Calico had been swift and thorough, she said,
and ``we felt we would have found her body. We didn't. We covered
every inch of ground around here.''
   She said she is taking pictures of Tara with her Monday to Port
St. Joe, about 30 miles southeast of Panama City, to inspect the
Polaroid snapshot.
   Sheriff Craig showed a videotape of the ``Current Affair''
segment to Michael's father, family and friends Sunday at sheriff's
headquarters in Grants, N.M.
   ``The majority of the family believes that that's Michael,''
Henley Sr. said after the viewing. ``Michael's best friend believes
that's Michael. His sister believes it's Michael.''
   Henley said his wife also believes the photo is of their son,
but he isn't so sure. ``I don't know,'' he said. ``Maybe it's just
because I don't want to see my son like that.''
   After ``A Current Affair'' was telecast Friday in New Mexico,
relatives called Mrs. Doel saying the girl in the photograph
resembled her daughter.
   Like Henley, Mrs. Doel said she wasn't sure at first if the girl
was Tara.
   ``She used to keep herself fixed up, and had a permanent in her
hair,'' she said. ``Before the perm, without the makeup ... I got
out the old pictures, and it's her.''
   A friend of Ms. Calico, Cynthia Tafoya, agreed.
   ``It's her. Everything ... the features, everything,'' Ms.
Tafoya said.
   She said there is a clue in the photograph _ a book by the
author V.C. Andrews. Ms. Tafoya said the book was Ms. Calico's
favorite. ``We used to trade (Andrews' books) all the time,'' Ms.
Tafoya said.
   Sheriff Craig and Valencia County Sheriff Lawrence Romero, who
investigated Tara's disappearance, said they will contact Florida
investigators.

At Whitefish, Montana, they still laugh at the events of December, 1947,
when more than a thousand local people from the Flathead Valley made their
way to the slopes of Big Mountain to witness an historic event: the opening
of the first ski-lift.
Ed Schenck and George Prentice, the principal investors in what was
originally known as the Hell Roaring Ski Corporation (named after a nearby
mountain) had spent half the night getting the lift ready.
This is Schenck's account: 'We sat down with the book of instructions and
tried to puzzle out how to adjust the T-bars. The directions said to turn
the retracting spring 11 times. Working by candle and flashlight, we did
this.
'Next morning, the motor coughed, and the first skiers took off. 'Oh no]'
George howled, and turned his reddening face away.
'Instead of riding up the hill with the T-bar supporting them under their
hips, these first riders were dangling 10 feet in the air and spinning round
and round. It was like a Bob Hope movie.
'The retracting spring had evidently been wound up sufficiently at the
factory. But since most of the skiers hadn't seen a T-bar lift before, they
didn't know anything was wrong. So George and I kept straight faces and
finished the day]'
Things have progressed in the ski industry in Montana since then. For those
who find Colorado and even Utah expensive and touristy (as all good places
tend to become) Montana may indeed live up to its reputation as 'The Last
Best Place'. A surprising number of local skiers are refugees from Colorado.
With more than 60 trails served by nine lifts, a vertical drop of 2,300ft
and a longest run of 2.5 miles, plus night-skiing and Snow Cat skiing, The
Big Mountain - Montana's biggest ski area - provides as much good skiing as
most of its better known counterparts. And a lift ticket costs Dollars 32
(Pounds 21) - Dollars 10 cheaper than the norm in Colorado.
The Big Mountain, 19 miles from Glacier Park International Airport in
north-west Montana, is isolated from other ski areas in the north-west. But
in the south west of the state an assortment of resorts enables visiting
skiers with a rental car to try a good cross-section.
If you hanker after steep but manageable terrain, head for Bridger Bowl up
in the Crazy Mountains (named after the sole woman survivor of an Indian
massacre who wandered the area and finally went mad) and the Bangtail
Mountains (named after the wild horses whose tails, knotted with frozen
snow, could be heard in winter banging against their thighs).
Bridger (lift ticket Dollars 24) is a smallish cult resort just to the north
of Yellowstone National Park which attracts skiers in search of off-piste
thrills. There are good nursery slopes (50 trails altogether) but they are
not what the local powder hounds, or 'Ridge Hippies' come for.
The main quest for these hounds is The Ridge, an extreme area with terrain
verying between challenging and suicidal, leading to The Nose, The Apron and
the North and South Bowls, ony reached by a short sharp hike. (There is a
rope tow to the top, but it is exclusively for the use of the Ski Patrol.)
With runs like Must Turn Left, Sometimes A Great Notion and Avalanche Gully
(none of which is shown on the official trail map) to choose from, it is
best to ski The Ridge with someone who knows what they are doing and where
they are going. I was accompanied by Doug Wales, Bridger's marketing
director.
Mercifully, Doug did not take me into the steep and narrow Hidden Gully
entrance into the Apron since I found the Apron itself challenging enough to
make me go wandering in the Crazy Mountains myself.
Yellowstone has another big ski area on its doorstep: Big Sky - reached,
like Bridger, from Bozeman. It too has recently opened up one area just for
advanced skiing - Lone Mountain, at 11,166ft, where the new Challenger lift
serves only single and double black diamond runs.
Contrary to Bridger Bowl, which has to remind skiers that it has ordinary
cruising runs and beginner slopes, Big Sky needed the Challenger lift
because it had a reputation for not enough advanced terrain.
With 65 miles of mainly beginner and intermediate skiing predominantly on
Andesite Mountain, and even some European-style gondolas - a rarity in the
US - Big Sky is still essentially a resort for the average family skier to
cruise all day (lift ticket Dollars 38).
Another resort in the region worth visiting is Red Lodge, rejoicing in
better days now that it has changed its name from Grizzly Peak. Any bear
attack anywhere in the Rockies used to send skiers into a panic, even during
winter when bears - if any - would be hibernating. The mountain itself still
retains the name Grizzly Peak.
Skiers at Red Lodge frequently enjoy a classic temperature inversion that
enables then to ski at almost 10,000ft in relative warmth of temperatures
above freezing, while the nearest big town, Billings might be several
degrees colder.
With a Dollars 24 lift ticket, Red Lodge has 35 trails, a vertical drop of
just over 2,000ft and has plans to build North America's first ski resort
funicular to get skiers on to the slopes from the car park and from the
quaint little town of Red, often used as the setting for western movies.
When Ed Schenck first arrived in Montana he recalls that a 'committee
dressed in coonskin caps and snowshoes took me up to inspect the skiing
country. They were as eager to please as rental agents in a ghost town.
'When we finally struggled to the top, we found breathtaking, vast, open
snowfields where you can ski in any direction, seven-foot deep snow topped
by soft powder, and sunshine - all the things a skier dreams about.'
Those dreams have now become practical possibilities.

<HEAD>Court Will Take Up New Mexico Tax Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
limiting the power of states and Indian tribes to impose duplicate
taxes on oil and gas taken from Indian lands.
   The court said it will hear a petroleum company's challenge to
taxes imposed by New Mexico officials.
   Cotton Petroleum Corp. and its affiliate, United Crude Co.,
challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some 15,000 acres of the
Jicarilla Apache reservation in New Mexico.
   The corporation pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6
percent of its production. In addition, New Mexico levies five
taxes amounting to about 8 percent of the corporation's
on-reservation production.
   Cotton Petroleum challenged the two biggest state taxes on the
grounds they illegally overlap the taxes imposed by the tribe. The
corporation said oil and gas producers in the state with deposits
on non-Indian land are taxed only 8 percent of their production.
   The corporation said the dual taxation interferes unlawfully
with interstate commerce. It also argued that the state taxes are
excessive because the corporation receives limited services from
the state.
   For example, Cotton Petroleum said that from 1981 through 1985
it paid $2.3 million in taxes to New Mexico but received only
$89,000 in services from the state.
   The New Mexico Court of Appeals upheld the state taxes last
September.
   ``There is no requirement that benefits conferred must equal
taxes extracted,'' the appeals court said, adding that the levies
do not interfere improperly with interstate commerce.
   New Mexico officials said the dispute is a matter of great
concern in western states.
   They said there are more than 150 cases in which companies with
oil and gas deposits on Indian land are protesting such double
taxation in Arizona, New Mexico, Montana and Utah.
   The case is Cotton Petroleum vs. New Mexico, 87-1327.

<HEAD>Cultures Mingle in Arab Desert as American Indians Perform</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA SMILEY</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   War whoops pierced the desert stillness.
Tom-toms kept the beat as dancers circled under the starry sky and
the campfire flickered their shadows on the adobe walls.
   The American Indian had come to Arabia.
   The fascinated onlookers were Bahrainis, who also have tribal
origins, but dance to different drums.
   The occasion was a cross-cultural pow-wow during a visit by the
American Indian Dance Theatre, a 15-member troupe touring the Middle
East and Europe under the auspices of the U.S. Information Service.
   The Americans, representing eight Indian tribes from Apache to
Zuni, said they were delighted by the Arabs' enthusiasm at their
performances, featuring traditional dances in authentic dress.
   ``We show them the vibrant colors, our beadwork, the songs,
dances. In a sense, they're just like us, they have their tribal
songs and dances that are new to us, just as ours are to them,''
said Marty Pennecoose, 31, a Southern Ute who now lives in Salem,
Ore., and works as a high-iron construction worker.
   The desert gathering, arranged by the U.S. Embassy, was a private
affair held in the ruins of an 80-year-old sheik's palace, within
sight and smell of Bahrain's oil and gas fields.
   The 50 or so guests sat on rugs in the sand, eating Middle
Eastern food, including four roast lambs, to watch an all-male
Bahraini dance group perform.
   The Indians later staged an impromptu performance. Long hair and
braids flew as the dancers, wearing jeans, cowboy boots and sneakers
instead of tribal costumes, mingled with the Bahrainis in their
white dishdashi robes and Arab headdress.
   Pennecoose said it was ``a learning process, going to these
different countries, experiencing their surroundings and cultures,
things that we'd only see in books.''
   ``We want to show the rest of the world what we have to offer,''
he said. ``It's a good thing, what we're doing, dancing around the
world.''
   Arlie Neskahi, 32, a Navajo and lead singer, said he found
cultural similarities as well as differences.
   ``Our people are shepherds, and I grew up eating lamb and goat,''
said Neskahi, who wore an Arab head scarf wrapped in the style of
Yemen, one of the group's earlier stops.
   ``My father always told me it takes all the colors of the rainbow
to make it beautiful,'' he said.
   ``We want to share our cultures with other people who don't know
anything about us,'' said Chester Mahooty, 60, a Zuni Indian from
New Mexico and the troupe's senior member.
   ``The people here think that John Wayne is the most popular, not
the Indians. We have to tell them the truth.''
   It was that stereotype that the company's founder and producer,
Barbara Schwei, said she wanted to dispel.
   ``I felt there was definitely a need to express the American
Indian culture to people because there is such a lack of
information. I thought it was time for a company done properly,
playing first-class theaters all over the world.'' Schwei, with
director and choreographer Hanay Geiogamah, picked the dancers
during visits to Indian pow-wows and festivals in the southern and
northwestern United States.
   The members are drawn from both American and Canadian tribes.
   Geiogamah, a Kiowa Delaware from Oklahoma, said the result is ``a
kind of new pan-tribal idiom'' that helps Indians preserve and
expand an important art form.
   Mahooty, who adorns himself with huge turquoise breastplates and
rings, said American Indian dances emphasize a religious
relationship with nature.
   Many are acted-out prayers to the ``Great Creator,'' mother
Earth, or mountain spirits, for rain, good harvest or hunting.
``Eagle dances,'' common from the northern plains to the
southwestern pueblos, pay homage to the soaring bird that Indians
believe has direct contact with deities in the sky.
   For one Bahraini it was a new look at a people ``we know only
from cowboy films.''

FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Temperatures soar in health quarrel - Day of
Claim and Counter-Claim over 'Leak'; Voters not swayed by row; Prime
Minister joins the fray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a day of extraordinary allegations over the 'leak' that disclosed the
identity of Jennifer Bennett, the girl who was the subject of Tuesday's
Labour election broadcast, some facts had become clear while others remain
in heated dispute.
Jennifer's name apparently found its way into the newspapers through a
combination of two factors. The first was inquiries by The Independent which
had discovered Jennifer's identity and questioned the consultant involved.
The second was Conservative Central Office's suggestion to the consultant,
after he contacted it, to get in touch with other newspapers, and the
party's own call to the Daily Express.
The sequence of events seems to have been as follows:
End of February: Labour begins work on the election broadcast, The Story of
Two Girls with the Same Problem, in consultation with Mr John Bennett,
Jennifer's father.
March 15: Mr Peter LeeRoberts, Jennifer's grandfather and a former
Conservative mayor of Faversham, Kent, sends a fax to Central Office warning
about the broadcast. The Tories have repeatedly stressed this did not
include the name of the child. But her grandfather insisted Mr Bennett's
name was mentioned.
According to Labour, Mrs Margaret Bennett, the mother, also telephones the
Tories.
March 24: Midday. Mr Robin Cook, shadow health secretary, shows journalists
a preview of the broadcast. In Manchester, Ms Julie Hall, Mr Neil Kinnock's
press secretary, tells journalists in an off-the-record briefing that the
child's first name is Jennifer. She does not divulge any more details.
That afternoon, The Independent learns the identity of the girl and the
consultant, Mr Alan Ardouin, from its 'own journalistic sources'. The paper
said yesterday that these were neither the main parties, the hospital
consultant, Jennifer's family, another news organisation, the film crew nor
the film's producer.
2pm-3pm. The newspaper telephones Mr Ardouin. He rings back when he has the
details of the case. The Independent understands that he has not spoken to
any other newspaper.
6.15pm. Mr Ardouin contacts Central Office, and is 'helped', in the words of
Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, to contact newspapers.
7pm-8pm. The consultant telephones the Labour party to refute the
allegations in the film. Labour says this is the first time it is aware that
Jennifer's name is now in the public domain. The Daily Express, and The
Independent in its later editions, run stories naming the child.
March 25: The political row about the film mounts throughout the day.
Yesterday: 9.30am. Mr Kinnock calls on the source of the leak to come
forward and denies it was anyone within the Labour party.
9.40am. Ms Hall interrupts the press conference to acknowledge that she gave
the name Jennifer to journalists before the film was shown, but claims this
would have been insufficient for them to establish her identity.
Mr Peter Hitchens, the journalist who broke the story in the Daily Express,
says he is 'not in reception of leaks from the Labour party' and that he
received the information from a 'second-hand' source. He says 'nobody could
possibly have known who this girl was unless the leak came from within the
Labour party organisation which made the film'.
Mr John Major, the prime minister denies that the Conservatives leaked the
name of the girl: 'Most certainly not.'
12.30pm. Sir Nicholas Lloyd, editor of the Daily Express, alleges that
Jennifer was first named to The Independent, 'probably by Labour party
sources'. The Independent denies it received the information from a
political source.
3.30pm. Mr William Waldegrave admits that Mr LeeRoberts's fax was received
nine days before the broadcast but claims it was ignored. He adds that when
Mr Ardouin made contact with Central Office before the broadcast 'I think we
helped the consultant get in touch with the newspapers'.
5.30pm. Central Office clarifies that it advised Mr Ardouin to contact the
newspapers, and also telephoned the Daily Express to inform it of this. The
Express then rang Mr Ardouin. Central Office denies that it revealed - or
even knew  - Jennifer's name.

<HEAD>State Taxes On Oil, Gas From Reservations Argued</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States do not trample on Indian rights by
taxing companies that produce oil and gas from tribal reservations,
New Mexico officials told the Supreme Court Wednesday.
   Attorney General Harold D. Stratton of New Mexico said the state
taxes do not discourage production or prompt producers to look off
the reservations for deposits.
   ``The taxes in no way hindered economic development,'' he said.
   But Daniel H. Israel, a lawyer for Cotton Petroleum Corp., said
the state taxes have ``a chilling effect'' on the ability of the
tribes to lease their land to private businesses.
   ``Inevitably, off-reservation development is more attractive
because of the lighter tax burden,'' he said.
   The justices, who heard 60 minutes of arguments, are expected to
announce a ruling in the case by July. The outcome is likely to be
important to Western states seeking guidance on what power they have
over tribal resources.
   Cotton Petroleum challenged taxes on oil and gas taken from some
15,000 acres of land on the Jicarilla Apache reservation in New
Mexico.
   The company pays taxes to the tribe amounting to about 6 percent
of its production and New Mexico levies five taxes on the company
amounting to 8 percent of its production.
   Cotton Petroleum challenged the two biggest state taxes on ground
they unlawfully overlap the tribal levies, violating constitutional
interstate commerce protections. The company noted that oil and gas
producers in the state with deposits taken from non-Indian land only
are taxed 8 percent of production.
   The company also said the state taxes are pre-empted by the
Constitution, because they conflict with federal laws aimed at
promoting Indian self-determination.
   The company said it paid $2.3 million in taxes to New Mexico from
1981 through 1985 but only received $89,000 in services from the
state.
   The New Mexico Court of Appeals upheld the state taxes last year.
   Stratton has said the case ``may very well set the course of
Indian-state jurisdiction in the future.'' He said there are more
than 250 cases nationwide that could be affected by the outcome.
   One issue the justices could decide is whether a tribe is
entitled to be treated in some instances as a state.
   Israel said Wednesday the court should afford that treatment to
Indian reservations ``in a limited sense only.''
   He argued, for example, that the Jicarilla tribe should have
``primary power with regard to its resources,'' thus limiting New
Mexico's authority.
   But Stratton said that approach could open the way to widespread
confusion.
   ``How we could treat tribes as states troubles me,'' he said,
noting there are some 250 reservations nationwide.
   The Jicarilla tribe is not a direct participant in the case,
although it has filed a so-called friend-of-the-court brief
expressing its views.
   The case is Cotton Petroleum Corp vs. New Mexico, 87-1327.

<HEAD>Chicago Struggles to Cope With Measles Outbreak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,100 measles cases have been reported
in Chicago as it copes with the worst outbreak in the resurgence of
the disease this year.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said 1,123 measles cases
were reported to Chicago health officials through Aug. 23, and that
78 percent have occurred in preschool children. In the United
States, 9,650 measles cases have been reported in the United States,
compared with 2,151 in the 1988 period.
   The Chicago outbreak ``is similar to others among inner-city
populations in the United States in that it involves primarily
unvaccinated black and Hispanic preschool-aged children,'' the CDC
said. Blacks and Hispanics account for 94 percent of the Chicago
cases.
   Chicago authorities have set up at least seven new vaccination
clinics, which have administered at least 21,000 doses of measles
vaccine. Door-to-door teams have given at least 2,000 more doses,
and the CDC said vaccination clinics have also been set up in four
hospital emergency departments.
   Measles, a once-common childhood disease, was believed on the
verge of eradication in this country in the early '80s _ just 1,497
cases were reported in 1983 _ but case counts have increased since.

<HEAD>Federal Wildlife Officials to Split Whooping Crane Colony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAUREL, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal wildlife officials plan to split the
world's only captive colony of whooping cranes this November to
reduce the chance the flock could be wiped out by disease or natural
disaster.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said 22 of the 54 endangered
birds at the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center would be shipped to
the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis.
   ``The service has been concerned about having all of their eggs
in one basket, literally,'' said David Trauger, the center's deputy
director. ``The service felt it was the prudent thing to do, to
separate the breeding flocks, and there's enough breeders now to do
that.''
   The center started in 1987 to breed the rare birds under a joint
program with Canadian wildlife officials. The Wisconsin foundation
was selected as the home of the new flock after considering several
groups across the nation.
   Although the foundation has not bred whooping cranes, it has
successfully bred 13 of the 14 other existing species of cranes in
the world.
   Scientists hope that by successfully breeding whooping cranes in
captivity, they will be able to establish another flock in the wild.
An attempt to do that failed in 1975 when an experimental flock at
the Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho failed to produce
enough eggs to sustain the colony.

<HEAD>Apache Reservation Car Death Rate Seven Times Nation's</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Indian Health Service has determined that the
2,600-square-mile White Mountain Apache Reservation in eastern
Arizona has a car-crash death rate seven times that of the nation as
a whole.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said 24 people were
killed in crashes on the reservation in 1985-86, a rate of 129 per
100,000 people. That's nearly seven times higher than the U.S. rate
of 19 per 100,000 and three times the national rate for Indians and
Alaskan Natives of 43 per 100,000.
   Vehicle death rates go up as population density goes down, and
the rural location of the Arizona tribe, population 9,300, ``may
account in part for the elevated ... death rate,'' the CDC said.
   Pedestrians accounted for seven of the 24 fatalities, and the CDC
said new streetlights were installed along pedestrian routes in
December.

PALM SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Riding in a golf cart isn't the only way to enjoy the outdoors in this desert 
resort town. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors can saddle up for leisurely horseback trips on trails that wind 
through unspoiled landscape to America's most magnificent palm oases. 
</P>
<P>
Although Palm Springs' rustic dude ranches have been replaced by golf courses 
and luxurious hotels, Smoke Tree Stables still keeps a corral of horses near 
the pristine Agua Caliente Indian canyons. 
</P>
<P>
Smoke Tree is the last public stable in Palm Springs. Would-be cowboys and 
cowgirls have been renting horses there since 1929, and city fathers recently 
gave owner Rod Johnson permission to keep his stable open for at least 10 more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Horse Trails 
</P>
<P>
The area has about 135 miles of horse trails that offer visitors close views of 
desert plants and wildlife. Hourlong rides go through mostly dry Palm Canyon 
Wash at the base of Smoke Tree Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
But longer and more interesting outings lead to streams and shady palm groves 
in remote Andreas, Murray and Palm canyons. You can stay in the saddle for two 
or four hours on the canyon rides, all guided by wranglers from the stable. 
</P>
<P>
To get to Smoke Tree from Los Angeles, drive east on Interstate 10 to the Palm 
Springs turnoff, California 111. 
</P>
<P>
Follow the highway (also called Palm Canyon Drive) south through town. Soon 
after it swings east, turn right at Sunrise Way. Take La Verne Way and then go 
left on Toledo Avenue to the stable entrance at No. 2500, where the street 
meets Murray Canyon Drive. 
</P>
<P>
(Don't turn in at Smoke Tree Ranch, a residential development.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riders of All Ages 
</P>
<P>
Smoke Tree Stables welcomes riders of all ages. Parents can ride with a small 
child in the same saddle. Hours are 8 a.m. until dusk. One-hour rides are 
offered on the hour for $15; no reservations required. 
</P>
<P>
More popular are the two-hour trips to Andreas Canyon that depart at 8 a.m. and 
10 a.m. and at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. They cost $33.50, including the equestrian 
entry fee to the Indian reservation. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the experience and desire of the riders the horses will walk, trot 
or lope along the trail at the command of the wrangler who guides the trip. 
</P>
<P>
From the stable the path enters a sandy wash between Smoke Tree Mountain and a 
flood-control dike bordering the Canyon Country Club golf course. Then it 
narrows and crosses a couple of streams that carry the runoff of melted snow 
from higher elevations before entering Agua Caliente tribal land. 
</P>
<P>
After stopping at a booth to pay the admission fee, the wrangler leads horses 
and riders through a landscape of palo verde trees, creosote bush, jumping 
cholla and other cactus. Willow leaves rustle in the desert breeze and birds 
flit from their hiding places at the sound of hoofs striking rocks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Into the Canyons 
</P>
<P>
The trail twists toward a canyon of California fan palms, botanically named 
Washingtonia filifera in honor of the first President. Many have survived for 
several centuries, including some with blackened trunks from a fire in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
The horses usually pause to drink from an icy stream that nourishes the oasis 
of palms, cottonwoods, sycamores and thick undergrowth. There's not much time 
to linger before heading back to the stable, but you may find Indian caves and 
grinding rocks near the picnic tables. 
</P>
<P>
On a four-hour horseback excursion to Murray Canyon, another oasis on Indian 
land, riders can dismount for a bring-your-own picnic lunch among the palms. An 
option is to forgo lunch and continue on a longer trail that circles back to 
the stable. 
</P>
<P>
The Murray Canyon trip must be arranged in advance and requires four or more 
riders. It costs $63.50 each, including admission to the reservation. For the 
same price, horsemen can mount up with a wrangler for a four-hour outing to 
Palm Canyon, the area's largest palm oasis. 
</P>
<P>
For more information on Palm Springs trail rides, call Smoke Tree Stables at 
(619) 327-1372. 
</P>
<P>
Before or after your equestrian adventure, take an even closer look at desert 
plant life by visiting Moorten Botanical Garden. This is the 50th anniversary 
of a remarkable collection of desert plants that has grown to 3,000 varieties. 
</P>
<P>
From the stables, follow Murray Canyon Road west to South Palm Canyon Drive, 
then turn right (north) to No. 1701. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Moorten and her late husband, known as Cactus Slim, established the garden 
around their home as a result of botanical and geological expeditions that 
began in the 1930s. They collected plants locally, in Mexico and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
A walk around the grounds is like a world tour, with specimens from a Baja 
boojum to an African thorn tree. Especially fascinating in the enclosed 
"cactarium" are plants with names such as "Snowball," "Old Man's Whiskers," 
"Mink Tail" and "Devil's Fingers." 
</P>
<P>
The thick vegetation has turned the property into a bird sanctuary, especially 
for about 200 mourning doves. Also look for the white temple doves from Egypt 
that are part of wedding ceremonies held frequently at the garden. 
</P>
<P>
Pat and her son, Clark, welcome visitors every day. Admission costs $1.50 and 
includes a map for an informal tour of the grounds. The garden opens at 9 a.m., 
Sundays at 10 a.m. Some of the Moorten's home-raised cactus plants are for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
Two blocks north is California 111, which you can rejoin to reach Interstate 10 
for the trip back to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Palm Springs is 230 miles.

<HEADLINE>  SPRING SKIING: CORN SNOW, T-SHIRTS AND A
GOOD TAN  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Venture -- Celebrating the Active Life  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     We're talking rites of spring here: skiing on silken carpets of corn snow;
checking out the action on the sun decks; gliding through the trees with the
greatest of ease.;    What follows is a suggested itinerary for the spring
skier at some of the most popular areas in the northern Sierra. Call ahead to
be sure your favorite area will be open.;     ALPINE MEADOWS: Alpine Meadows
flaunts its spring skiing by staying open until Memorial Day -- and with good
reason. The resort has terrain that faces nearly every point on the compass,
practically guaranteeing good snow somewhere on the mountain until late
afternoon.;     SQUAW VALLEY: Savvy skiers at Squaw Valley begin their spring
mornings on the intermediate slopes of Sun Bowl, accessible from the Cornice
II chair, and the advanced Sundance (formerly Tower 16) run.;    After 10
a.m., check out the East Face of KT-22 for advanced skiers, and Emigrant, Gold
Coast, East Broadway and Mainline for intermediates. Granite Chief has a
variety of exposures that begin softening after 10, and Shirley Lake and
Headwall reach prime conditions about noon, according Bob Cushman, assistant
ski patrol director.;     KIRKWOOD: The Elevator Shaft, a run not nearly so
fearsome as its name suggests, should be the first stop for corn snow buffs.
The intermediate slope, which can be reached from the Sunrise chair, has a
southern exposure and softens by about 10 a.m., said Kirkwood spokesman Mike
Allen.;     SUGAR BOWL: Mount Disney with its wide variety of exposures is the
best bet for spring skiing, according to Don Belden, Sugar Bowl's mountain
manager.;    By 10 a.m. the snow should be excellent on the East Face of
Disney, with its variety of glade and tree skiing. By noon, head for the runs
off the nose of Disney, and afternoon is the best time to hit the groomed runs
that veer down the western exposure of the mountain, Belden said.;    
HEAVENLY VALLEY: The Nevada side of Heavenly Valley is the best for morning
skiing, said Scotty Atchinson, a ski patrol supervisor. The lower part of the
Nevada side is closed for the season, so ride to the top of the California
side and ski the trails off the Dipper chair  </TEXT>

FT  17 DEC 94 / Travel: By bus in Guatemala - Mark Hodson has an eventful
journey by public transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK HODSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jose sat beside me wearing red and white pin-striped trousers and black
leather chaps. He had a long straight Mayan nose and dry black skin like
crumpled linen. On his head, at a slight angle, sat a straw boater.
He was taking the bus home from market, along with his wife and two young
daughters and a chicken in a cardboard box. They lived in Todos Santos
Cuchumatan, in the mountains of north-west Guatemala.
Jose was a Nam Indian, a true descendant of the ancient Maya yet, like his
village, his name was Spanish. The conquistadors had made the arduous trek
to Todos Santos even before a road was built to connect it to the outside
world.
The Spaniards converted the inhabitants to Roman Catholicism, gave them new
names and a distinctive local costume. Legend has it that the men of Todos
Santos were so taken by the finery worn by one particularly flamboyant
Spaniard that they all copied it.
Today, the villagers still make the straw hats by hand and a boy does not
properly become a man until he is allowed to wear the red shirt with its
brightly patterned cuffs and upturned collars.
The bus pulled out of Huehuetenango with a few nervous coughs and a loud
roar. I shared a seat built for two with Jose and his family. One of the
girls was allocated to me and she sat on my lap for the entire journey
staring silently up at my alien face.
As we approached a police checkpoint the conductor told everyone to crouch
on the floor. There were 20 or 50 people standing in the aisle and they all
obliged, the men gently laying down their machetes, the women heaving babies
on to nearby laps.
We made it through but at a second checkpoint we were stopped and a
policeman noticed the bus was illegally overloaded. A small fine was
negotiated and we were off again.
For anyone over 5ft 6in tall, the seats were horribly cramped - the bus had
been designed to carry American schoolchildren. Above the windscreen,
between a blaring tape deck and a picture of the Virgin Mary, a faded sign
warned: 'No Swearing, No Horseplay.'
After 20 minutes we ran out of road and started to climb a lush mountain,
rarely getting out of first gear and hardly topping walking pace. The
driver, a man in his 40s with sunglasses, a greasy quiff and a row of silver
teeth, handed over the wheel to his conductor so he could chat up a woman
passenger.
An hour later we reached the peak and pulled up at a lonely truck stop
10,000ft above sea level. The men filed off, loosened their chaps and
relieved themselves against the side of the bus.
They did not speak much. Spanish remains their second language and they
would smile and exchange pleasantries but little more.
After a light lunch of Coca-Cola and dried cakes we were back on the road
crossing a stark barren plain. We dropped into a steep valley.
We could see Todos Santos spread out below us when we heard another bus
behind, hooting and snarling as it tried to pass on the narrow dirt road.
Our driver refused to pull over even when he stopped to set down passengers.
The other driver jumped out of his cab and ran up to our bus, swinging a
machete, stamping his feet and howling obscenities.
Our driver pulled away, stopping on the next bend to let the other bus pass.
As it did so a young man stood in the doorway of the other vehicle, and
waved the machete. With a flash of steel he slashed one of our tyres and we
ground to another halt.
Todos Santos was a picture of peace and tranquillity. Around the whitewashed
colonial church half a dozen young men leant in doorways, talking in
whispers and coyly posing in their brilliant costumes. Families sat outside
their adobe huts weaving: women at the looms, children bundling up cotton
and men sewing little bags.
The villagers had set up a workers' co-operative and their tiny shop was
packed with colourful weavings, each with a tag showing the name of the
person who had made it.
Next day, I saw a funeral. Half a dozen small children were walking down the
main street in single file, each holding a peace lily and solemnly staring
ahead. Behind them a boy of about 14 supported the rough-hewn coffin of a
child across his shoulders as if he was carrying his own cross.
He was followed by a dozen women in dazzling red blouses and skirts. None
displayed any emotion. It was exquisite and heart-breaking.
There was just one restaurant in town which served the same meal of
scrambled eggs, black beans and tortillas for breakfast, lunch and dinner,
and a hostel with horse-hair beds in draughty rooms that got hellishly cold
at night. I lasted two days before I got back on that bus.
This time we broke down after just 45 minutes. A second bus took us back to
Huehuetenango where I found I had missed the connection east to Sacapulas
and would have to wait until morning.
Next day at 11am I was back on the road with another lunatic at the wheel
who hurled us around the winding mountain roads until after two hours we
shuddered to a halt when the transmission shaft snapped. I sat at the side
of the road dreaming of cold beer, watching a herd of oxen overtake us and
thinking that even by Guatemalan standards three breakdowns on the trot must
be considered pretty bad luck.
A United Nations truck pulled up but the driver refused to give us a ride so
we had to wait two hours for the next bus. When it came it was already
nearly full but the driver seemed so pleased to see a rival broken down that
he made sure everyone squeezed on.
By the time we reached the little crossroads town of Sacapulas at the foot
of the Cuchumatan mountains it was almost dusk. I had missed the last
connecting bus to the village of Nebaj and was looking for a cold drink when
a lorry driver offered me a lift.
He was leaving immediately so I clambered up the back of his open truck,
clinging to the edge as we thundered high into the hills. I turned and
through the swirling dust saw a warm golden sunset over the valley. I looked
down to find myself standing on a mountain of wooden crates filled with
beer.
Journey Latin America (081-747 8515) take escorted groups through Guatemala,
Mexico and Belize, staying in budget hotels and using public buses. Prices
for 20-day trips start at Pounds 1,210 including flights, but not
accommodation.

TRIP OF THE WEEK: A ROARING RIDE THROUGH REDWOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE GRIMM and TOM GRIMM, The Grimms are Laguna Beach free-lance 
writers/photographers and authors of the updated Away for a Weekend. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FELTON, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The train whistles that echo through the redwood forest here bring visitors 
back to the 1800s, when sturdy little steam engines hauled carloads of timber 
down from the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
These days, the historic locomotives are carrying sightseers up the steep 
grades to view virgin stands of Sequoia sempervirens, the tallest species of 
trees in the world. Just hop aboard the Roaring Camp &amp; Big Trees 
Narrow-Gauge Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
The one-of-a-kind railway makes a scenic 12-mile round-trip journey beneath a 
canopy of coastal redwoods in the Santa Cruz Mountains. The excursion takes 
about 1 hour and 15 minutes, but you can get off to picnic in the woods and 
then catch a later train back to the depot. 
</P>
<P>
The Roaring Camp station is seven miles north of Santa Cruz in this rural town 
that was named after a lawyer, Charles Felton, who later became a U.S. 
congressman and senator. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly 1,800 acres of the adjacent forest have been preserved as Henry Cowell 
Redwoods State Park, where you can explore 20 miles of trails and camp among 
the evergreens. The park also has a nature display center and a riverside 
picnic area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mexican Land Grant 
</P>
<P>
The redwoods were part of a Mexican land grant, Rancho Canada del Rincon. Some 
of them came into the possession of a boisterous Kentucky mountain man, Isaac 
Graham, who established a rough-and-tumble place called Roaring Camp. 
</P>
<P>
After his death, loggers wanted the property, but Joseph Welch, a San Francisco 
businessman, bought the land to protect the big trees. 
</P>
<P>
However, the lumbermen succeeded in getting right-of-way through Welch's 
redwoods and built a narrow-gauge railroad from Felton to Santa Cruz in 1875. 
Later, a connecting line was added from San Jose over the mountains, and 
tourists by the train load came from San Francisco to see the awesome trees. 
</P>
<P>
Welch operated a rustic resort for visitors to his Big Trees Grove, where some 
redwoods tower more than 250 feet. After his death a portion of the property 
became a county park. In 1954 it was absorbed into a state park, with 
surrounding land donated by the Henry Cowell family. 
</P>
<P>
Another section of Welch's untouched forest was later leased by his descendants 
so that the old narrow-gauge railway could get up steam again. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the dreams and determination of a Los Angeles train buff, the late F. 
Norman Clark, Roaring Camp &amp; Big Trees RR made its debut in 1963. More than 
250,000 people now ride the old-time trains annually. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Derelict Engines 
</P>
<P>
Get here from Los Angeles by driving U.S. 101 and California 1 north to Santa 
Cruz, then exiting north on River Street/California 9 to Felton. Turn right on 
Graham Hill Road and go about a half mile to the right-hand entrance to Roaring 
Camp. 
</P>
<P>
You'll pass a century-old depot awaiting restoration, and a train yard filled 
with derelict engines and rail cars. After reaching the parking lot ($3 on 
weekends in the summer; free at other times), walk through the covered bridge 
and past a duck pond to the ticket office at trackside. 
</P>
<P>
Excursions depart at 11 a.m., 12:15, 1:30, 2:45 and 4 p.m. daily through Labor 
Day, Sept. 4. The same schedule applies on weekends and holidays through the 
rest of September, but on weekdays the only departure is at noon. No 
reservations are required. 
</P>
<P>
During the rest of the year trains depart at noon, 1:30 and 3 p.m. on weekends 
and holidays, plus a noon run on weekdays. Christmas Day is the only time that 
the railroad doesn't operate. 
</P>
<P>
Round-trip fares are $10.50; ages 5 through 17 pay $7.50. The ride is free for 
children under 5. Call (408) 335-4400 (recording) or (408) 335-4484 for 
additional information. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Squeal of the Wheels 
</P>
<P>
If the train is returning from a trip, you'll hear its whistle and the squeal 
of wheels on the tracks as it descends through the trees. Listen for the roar 
of escaping steam as the engine is "blown down" to keep pressure from getting 
too high in the boiler. 
</P>
<P>
While passengers climb aboard for the next excursion, the spout of an 
old-fashioned water tower is pulled down to refill the engine. Then the steam 
whistle blows and the train circles a grassy meadow before huffing and puffing 
to get up some of the steepest railroad grades in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the railroad's steam locomotives are being used -- a 1910 Shay called 
Sonora and an 1899 Heisler named Tuolumne. They pull four open-top cars with 
bench seats and a covered car at the rear. Passengers needn't worry about soot 
from the smoke stack because the old engines burn oil instead of coal. 
</P>
<P>
Vandals set fire to a corkscrew trestle several years ago, so the train must 
stop to back up into a siding that switches to a spur and bypasses the burned 
section of track. As the train crawls up the mountainside the conductor tells 
the history of the Roaring Camp railroad and describes the tree-filled scenery. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ring of Redwoods 
</P>
<P>
Everyone is invited to get off at Cathedral Grove to stand in a ring of 
towering redwoods and hear about the tree's life cycle. The conductor also 
talks about its relatives -- the giant Sequoia in the Sierra Nevada and the 
dawn redwood in China. 
</P>
<P>
If you've brought food and drink you can disembark at Bear Mountain to picnic. 
The train trip up to the picnic area takes about 50 minutes, while the downhill 
ride over the same tracks gets you back to the depot in just 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
From Roaring Camp you also can depart on the Santa Cruz, Big Trees and Pacific 
Railway Co. diesel train, which began excursions to the Santa Cruz Boardwalk in 
1987. Two round trips are made daily through Labor Day, then only weekends and 
holidays through Oct. 29. Tickets are $16 (weekdays $12), children $8.50. 
</P>
<P>
You can browse in the Roaring Camp General Store for railroad books and 
souvenirs. Visitors also hiss and boo villains during melodrama shows presented 
three times daily on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Toasted Marshmallows 
</P>
<P>
A chuck-wagon barbecue is available from noon to 3 p.m. on weekends through 
October. The menu ($7.95 to $13.95) features charbroiled hamburgers, chicken, 
ribs and steaks, plus salad, beans, beverages and marshmallows to toast on the 
campfire. 
</P>
<P>
Just across the tracks a path leads into the state park and mile-long Redwood 
Grove Trail. Pick up a self-guiding leaflet to the giant trees that have been 
named for U.S. Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
You can reach the Henry Cowell Redwoods State Park campground and its 112 sites 
by driving south on Graham Hill Road. Make reservations through Mistix by 
calling toll-free (800) 444-7275. The reservation fee is $3.95, plus $10 a 
night (no hookups for RVs). 
</P>
<P>
For information about lodgings and restaurants in the area, call the Santa Cruz 
County Conference and Visitors Council at (408) 425-1234. 
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Felton and Roaring Camp railroad through the 
redwoods is 760 miles.

BIRATNAGER, Nepal 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was February, and Katmandu was filled with sturdy-legged trekkers. "When you 
get to San Diego we'll show you a good time," I overheard one American tell a 
Sherpa during breakfast at Mike's, the charming garden restaurant where 
Westerners gather daily for a $2 omelet-and-muffin feast. 
</P>
<P>
It was my final city meal before starting an eight-day trek. I didn't know it 
then, but those trekkers were the last I would see until my return to Katmandu. 
Despite the surging popularity of hiking in the Himalayas, 50,000 of the 54,000 
trekkers in Nepal in 1988 headed for just two destinations -- the Everest or 
Annapurna regions. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid the hordes, six writers were joining Steve Conlon, head of Above The 
Clouds, a Massachusetts-based adventure travel company, to try a new route 
along a ridge called Milke Danda in eastern Nepal, a region just recently 
opened to trekkers by the government. 
</P>
<P>
As we flew to the city of Biratnager, from which a bus was to drive us six 
hours north to our starting point, I could not take my eyes off the thrilling 
view from the airplane window. Cho-Oyu, Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Kanchenjunga 
-- the snowy tips of some of the highest peaks on the planet poked through the 
cloud bank below us. 
</P>
<P>
I had waited 12 years to see these majestic mountains again. In 1978 I had done 
an exhausting trek. Now my excitement at returning to the Himalayas was tinged 
with nervousness. Had I trained hard enough? Would I be able to enjoy the 
views, rather than slog along, panting, my eyes staring down at my boots as I 
had the time before? 
</P>
<P>
It was night when our bus dropped us off at the end of the paved road. We had 
climbed from near sea level to 7,000 feet -- still the "hills" by Himalayan 
standards. A row of green tents beckoned. We ate a quick traditional dinner 
(including daal bhat, the rice dish that is the staple of the Nepalese diet) 
inside a candle-lit dining tent and crawled into our sleeping bags. 
</P>
<P>
Morning dawned clear and cold. Far in the distance, across row after row of 
brown hills, we could just make out the tops of Makalu and Everest. I peeked at 
the itinerary: This day would be "an easy one," Steve had written, "gentle 
uphill along the ridge . . . with the Himalayas always before us. . . ." I was 
so eager for a closer look at the mountains that I hardly noticed how steep the 
"gentle uphill" was. 
</P>
<P>
But for Nepal it was fairly easy. That's because the Himalayas are so vertical 
that they make hiking in the Sierra or Rockies seem like a stroll in Central 
Park. Nevertheless, my physical fears were unfounded. Smart companies realize 
that not everyone wants to emulate Sir Edmund Hillary; a growing number of 
treks require less than two weeks of walking and skirt the vertical climbs via 
ridge trails. 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the burgeoning number of adventure travel outfits are competing to 
lure the experienced trekker back for a second or third Himalayan experience. 
Thus, unusual routes in out-of-the-way places such as Milke Danda, the 
primitive Dolpo region and the neighboring country of Bhutan, are showing up in 
more and more trekking catalogs. 
</P>
<P>
We climbed a rocky but well-worn path bordered by strands of huge rhododendron 
trees. "In the spring the whole place is red with their blossoms," remarked 
Maitalal, a Nepalese friend of Steve's. But it was not yet spring. Well before 
our lunch stop, an ominous, clammy fog rolled in, obscuring everything more 
than three feet in front of us. 
</P>
<P>
And so began what we dubbed our "In the Clouds" trek. For the next eight days 
the fog, unusual for February, enveloped the east Nepal Himalayas. It was just 
our bad luck. October through April is considered prime time, weatherwise. But 
the January "mini-monsoon," which causes fog and rain for a few days throughout 
the country in mid-winter, had arrived late. It seemed as if the mountain gods 
were pouring pea soup from the heavens. "Now I know why the book about 
Shangri-La was called 'Lost Horizon'," I wrote morosely in my diary. 
</P>
<P>
Each morning I would unzip my tent flap and see only mist, not Makalu. Frost 
carpeted the trail in the morning. The bushes were coated with rime. Wind-blown 
ice particles turned tree branches into eerie frozen feathers. At times I felt 
I could well be in North Dakota, except for the herds of yaks that wandered 
through our camp at night, the bells around their necks announcing their 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
For a mountain lover like me it was by turns depressing, surreal and comic. 
When we got to our campsite, a broad meadow, on Day 4, Steve pointed east, 
saying, "If it were clear you would see Kanchenjunga (the world's third-highest 
mountain) right over there." We dutifully stared into the blankness. 
</P>
<P>
Then at precisely 2:51 p.m. a patch of blue appeared in the sky. Something 
white was on the horizon! Was it Kanchenjunga or merely an illusion? 
</P>
<P>
I scurried up the nearest ridge for a better look. Within a minute the fog 
pulled down the curtain again. Determined to catch whatever tiny glimpses 
Mother Nature decided to offer me, I perched on a rock, scanning the void. For 
two solid hours I sat there in a trance, imagining that at any moment 
Kanchenjunga might appear through the shifting vapors. Perhaps, I thought, I 
could become a Buddhist and see the mountains with my inner eye. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, my meditation cheered me up. And as the days passed I learned that 
visiting an untrekked, unspoiled area could mean more than views. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, we were not surrounded by other tourists. One friend who had 
made an Annapurna trek told me that some campsites looked like tent cities. 
Writer Jeremy Bernstein came across a Mexican restaurant in that area, and he 
described a town in the Everest region as "crawling with trekkers of every 
size, shape and nationality." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe east Nepal soon will be overrun, too. But during our eight days we did 
not see any other trekking party. Indeed, the only Westerners we met were two 
anthropologists who were living there. 
</P>
<P>
Because I could not see the scenery I paid attention to the people. And they 
returned the favor. 
</P>
<P>
Some villages were desperately poor. (Nepal is one of the world's most 
poverty-stricken countries.) Barefoot, begrimed, coughing children huddled 
around smoky fires inside tiny wood shacks, yet their parents were consistently 
welcoming, always ready to pour us cups of tea. Not a single child tugged at 
our skirts begging for rupees, as many apparently do in areas more frequented 
by tourists. 
</P>
<P>
As we descended the ridge we saw classic scenes: water buffaloes pulling crude 
plows through terraced planting fields, women washing their beautiful long 
black hair at public water spigots. 
</P>
<P>
We saw bizarre ones, too, such as a barefoot prisoner (we were told he had 
murdered his mother) shackled to a policeman, being led on foot to the nearest 
town. At one schoolhouse we visited tiny classrooms where elementary grades 
children were learning to read. Then classes came to a halt as Steve spoke to 
the youngsters in Nepali. At another, scores of children gathered around while 
he pulled a paperback atlas from his pack and showed them where "America" is. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the village of Chainpur we strolled through the weekly market. Rural 
people, many of them women with elaborate gold rings through their noses, set 
up shop in an open-air square selling all kinds of goods: huge cakes of brown 
sugar, tasty tangerines, plastic bracelets. I bought what looked like a 
grapefruit for 2 rupees (a fraction of a penny), sliced it with my knife and 
took a bite. Surprise! It was a gigantic, very tart lemon. 
</P>
<P>
At the final campsite our Sherpa cook baked a farewell cake. In whipped egg 
whites on top was a message: "See you again." There's a good chance of that. 
The most rewarding aspect of the journey was the one I did not train for. 
Despite the fog this trek gave me a fascinating glimpse into a poor but proud 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
I had come to see the Himalayas; instead, I saw Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
Getting Here: I flew Lufthansa from New York via Frankfurt to Katmandu, a trip 
that happily avoids a night layover in the New Delhi airport. Lufthansa, 
Singapore and Thai International are among the airlines that fly from the West 
Coast to Katmandu. It is also possible to fly to Bangkok or Hong Kong and make 
connections to Katmandu. 
</P>
<P>

outfits charge considerably less. You can also bring your own gear, hire your 
own porters and guide through small Katmandu agencies, and do an independent 
trek for as little as $25 a day.

MEXICO ARCHEOLOGICAL DIG YIELDS 1ST-EVER CARVING OF DECORATIONS ON CHILD'S 
TEETH 
</P>

CIUDAD VICTORIA, Mexico 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Archeologists say the tombs of a mysterious city have yielded the first example 
of the use on children of an ancient art: carving or engraving teeth as a sign 
of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of the engraving was discovered on the teeth of a boy's skeleton found 
in the ruins of Montezuma's Balcony, where civilization was far more advanced 
than any previously thought to exist in the region. 
</P>
<P>
Montezuma's Balcony is 310 miles north of Mexico City outside Ciudad Victoria, 
capital of northeastern Tamaulipas state. Its name is derived from that of 
Moctezuma, the Aztec king. 
</P>
<P>
Tamaulipas, which spent more than $53,000 on the project, plans to open the 
site to the public this year. 
</P>
<P>
Two canyons and a mountain surround the remote, 12-acre city. It is reached by 
a steep, rocky road that veers two miles off the main highway to 86 huge slabs 
of stone named the "grand stairway." 
</P>
<P>
Only from the top of the stairway can the remains of more than 100 circular 
structures be seen, each up to 50 feet in diameter, built from stacked and 
fitted rocks. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100 skeletons were found in basements, along with ceramic fragments, 
food-grinding utensils, pipes, necklaces, arrowheads, knives and small 
figurines. 
</P>
<P>
The remains of the boy, no older than 5, showed evidence of the carving, called 
dental mutilation, in his two upper incisors and one lower incisor. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a very rare find," said Jesus Narez, director of the Montezuma's 
Balcony restoration project. "Until now, we have never detected dental 
mutilations in a person this young." 
</P>
<P>
In primitive cultures, dental mutilation was believed to be practiced only on 
adults. It still is done in some Brazilian, Indonesian and African communities. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it hurts a lot, but . . . peyote, which was commonly used in those 
times, was probably used to put the child to sleep or dull the pain," Narez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Several other things make Montezuma's Balcony unique, said Narez, 
curator-investigator of the architectural and cultural collections of northern 
Mexico at the National Museum of Anthropology and History in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
He said two groups of people lived there: the Grassiles, thin and fine 
featured, and the Robustus, big-boned and heavy. Archeologists chose the names. 
</P>
<P>
"At least for now, we think they lived there together, but radiocarbon testing 
is being done to determine if they were there at the same time or if one group 
followed the other," Narez said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Narez, the city's 3,000 people probably lived between the years 
600 and 1400. The elite occupied the structures and were buried in their 
basements, and the others lived in wooden huts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
References to Montezuma's Balcony appeared in a researcher's report in the 
mid-1800s, and there was another report in the 1940s. Work on the site began in 
1988 and was completed in August. 
</P>
<P>
Although their culture achieved more than others in the area, the Montezuma's 
Balcony residents were not as advanced as the Teotihuacans, Zapotecs or Mayas 
of southern Mexico, who built pyramids and cities in the same period. 
</P>
<P>
Northern tribes such as the Huastecas and the warrior-like Chichimecas led more 
primitive, simpler lives than the people of Montezuma's Balcony, Narez said. 
</P>
<P>
"We never thought we'd find these types of buildings so far north," he said, 
adding that huge pieces of rock used to build the structures were moved with 
the aid of planks and rope.

FT  17 DEC 94 / Travel: By bus in Guatemala - Mark Hodson has an eventful
journey by public transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK HODSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jose sat beside me wearing red and white pin-striped trousers and black
leather chaps. He had a long straight Mayan nose and dry black skin like
crumpled linen. On his head, at a slight angle, sat a straw boater.
He was taking the bus home from market, along with his wife and two young
daughters and a chicken in a cardboard box. They lived in Todos Santos
Cuchumatan, in the mountains of north-west Guatemala.
Jose was a Nam Indian, a true descendant of the ancient Maya yet, like his
village, his name was Spanish. The conquistadors had made the arduous trek
to Todos Santos even before a road was built to connect it to the outside
world.
The Spaniards converted the inhabitants to Roman Catholicism, gave them new
names and a distinctive local costume. Legend has it that the men of Todos
Santos were so taken by the finery worn by one particularly flamboyant
Spaniard that they all copied it.
Today, the villagers still make the straw hats by hand and a boy does not
properly become a man until he is allowed to wear the red shirt with its
brightly patterned cuffs and upturned collars.
The bus pulled out of Huehuetenango with a few nervous coughs and a loud
roar. I shared a seat built for two with Jose and his family. One of the
girls was allocated to me and she sat on my lap for the entire journey
staring silently up at my alien face.
As we approached a police checkpoint the conductor told everyone to crouch
on the floor. There were 20 or 50 people standing in the aisle and they all
obliged, the men gently laying down their machetes, the women heaving babies
on to nearby laps.
We made it through but at a second checkpoint we were stopped and a
policeman noticed the bus was illegally overloaded. A small fine was
negotiated and we were off again.
For anyone over 5ft 6in tall, the seats were horribly cramped - the bus had
been designed to carry American schoolchildren. Above the windscreen,
between a blaring tape deck and a picture of the Virgin Mary, a faded sign
warned: 'No Swearing, No Horseplay.'
After 20 minutes we ran out of road and started to climb a lush mountain,
rarely getting out of first gear and hardly topping walking pace. The
driver, a man in his 40s with sunglasses, a greasy quiff and a row of silver
teeth, handed over the wheel to his conductor so he could chat up a woman
passenger.
An hour later we reached the peak and pulled up at a lonely truck stop
10,000ft above sea level. The men filed off, loosened their chaps and
relieved themselves against the side of the bus.
They did not speak much. Spanish remains their second language and they
would smile and exchange pleasantries but little more.
After a light lunch of Coca-Cola and dried cakes we were back on the road
crossing a stark barren plain. We dropped into a steep valley.
We could see Todos Santos spread out below us when we heard another bus
behind, hooting and snarling as it tried to pass on the narrow dirt road.
Our driver refused to pull over even when he stopped to set down passengers.
The other driver jumped out of his cab and ran up to our bus, swinging a
machete, stamping his feet and howling obscenities.
Our driver pulled away, stopping on the next bend to let the other bus pass.
As it did so a young man stood in the doorway of the other vehicle, and
waved the machete. With a flash of steel he slashed one of our tyres and we
ground to another halt.
Todos Santos was a picture of peace and tranquillity. Around the whitewashed
colonial church half a dozen young men leant in doorways, talking in
whispers and coyly posing in their brilliant costumes. Families sat outside
their adobe huts weaving: women at the looms, children bundling up cotton
and men sewing little bags.
The villagers had set up a workers' co-operative and their tiny shop was
packed with colourful weavings, each with a tag showing the name of the
person who had made it.
Next day, I saw a funeral. Half a dozen small children were walking down the
main street in single file, each holding a peace lily and solemnly staring
ahead. Behind them a boy of about 14 supported the rough-hewn coffin of a
child across his shoulders as if he was carrying his own cross.
He was followed by a dozen women in dazzling red blouses and skirts. None
displayed any emotion. It was exquisite and heart-breaking.
There was just one restaurant in town which served the same meal of
scrambled eggs, black beans and tortillas for breakfast, lunch and dinner,
and a hostel with horse-hair beds in draughty rooms that got hellishly cold
at night. I lasted two days before I got back on that bus.
This time we broke down after just 45 minutes. A second bus took us back to
Huehuetenango where I found I had missed the connection east to Sacapulas
and would have to wait until morning.
Next day at 11am I was back on the road with another lunatic at the wheel
who hurled us around the winding mountain roads until after two hours we
shuddered to a halt when the transmission shaft snapped. I sat at the side
of the road dreaming of cold beer, watching a herd of oxen overtake us and
thinking that even by Guatemalan standards three breakdowns on the trot must
be considered pretty bad luck.
A United Nations truck pulled up but the driver refused to give us a ride so
we had to wait two hours for the next bus. When it came it was already
nearly full but the driver seemed so pleased to see a rival broken down that
he made sure everyone squeezed on.
By the time we reached the little crossroads town of Sacapulas at the foot
of the Cuchumatan mountains it was almost dusk. I had missed the last
connecting bus to the village of Nebaj and was looking for a cold drink when
a lorry driver offered me a lift.
He was leaving immediately so I clambered up the back of his open truck,
clinging to the edge as we thundered high into the hills. I turned and
through the swirling dust saw a warm golden sunset over the valley. I looked
down to find myself standing on a mountain of wooden crates filled with
beer.

But some time during junior high, many of these same kids began to think the 
uniforms looked too uncool, and scouting became a social liability. 
</P>
<P>
Pressure from friends and busy schedules crowded out scouting for most. Yet 
those who stayed involved say the drawbacks are minimal compared to the 
rewards. 
</P>
<P>
Richa Varma, 14, a freshman at El Toro High School, quit Girl Scouts after the 
sixth grade but decided to rejoin this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I missed it," she said. "There was so much to do, and it was so interesting. I 
love camping. You meet new people, and I just enjoyed it a lot. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first joined (again), I didn't tell anybody. But as soon as I started 
selling Girl Scout cookies at school, people would say, 'You're still a Girl 
Scout?' There are some people out there who are like, 'You're in Girl Scouts! 
Get away! Don't be such a baby.' But it's something I like to do, and if they 
can't accept that, that's their problem." 
</P>
<P>
Karin Carlson, director of program services for the Girl Scout Council of 
Orange County, said: "If they can tough out the peer pressure, there are so 
many opportunities that open up to them for leadership, for service, for 
travel." 
</P>
<P>
High school students in scouting, called seniors, do more than go camping and 
sell cookies. Scouting combines community service with training in such diverse 
areas as surfing, cooking and career planning. Similarly to the younger Scouts 
who earn badges for activities, senior Scouts participate in special projects 
to earn patches that show they have mastered certain skills. 
</P>
<P>
Senior Boy Scouts work toward achieving Eagle status, the highest honor in 
scouting, while senior girls aim for the Eagle's equivalent, the Gold Award. 
</P>
<P>
To earn the rank of Eagle, a Boy Scout must plan and organize a 100-hour 
service project. David Jedynak, 18, a Mission Viejo High senior, expects to 
earn his Eagle honor next month after setting up a project to resurrect a dying 
trail in Trabuco Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Jeeps roamed the Trabuco Canyon Trail 25 years ago, but weather and plants 
eroded the path, making it almost too narrow in places to walk. For his 
project, Jedynak and his fellow Scouts cleared trees, moved rocks and chopped 
down plants to make it a usable foot trail again. 
</P>
<P>
Scouting has also allowed Jedynak to backpack in the sand dunes along the 
California-Arizona border, where the third movie of the Star Wars trilogy, 
"Return of the Jedi," was filmed. 
</P>
<P>
On one rock-climbing trip that placed the Scouts in a 300-foot vertical cave, 
Jedynak had a chance to practice rescue techniques when one of the climbers 
fell. With his troop, he has also canoed 14 miles in Mission Bay in San Diego, 
helped with a local children's Easter egg hunt and collected food and shoes for 
children in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
Jedynak said that besides the satisfaction he has gained by serving his 
community, he has experienced personal rewards. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, he was named Orange County's outstanding senior patrol leader for his 
commitment to planning and organizing his troop's activities. As a result, 
Orange County developer William Lyon invited him to lead the flag salute at a 
$5,000-a-plate charity dinner at a country club in Coto de Caza. 
</P>
<P>
Jedynak is near the top of scouting, and he has had to face the negative 
reactions of others all along the way. Peer pressure was greatest in junior 
high school, he said, although he adds it was never particularly troublesome. 
</P>
<P>
"It didn't bother me because I was proud of what I was doing," he said. "I was 
a leader, and I did get chosen to go to this fancy lunch at this very, very 
fancy country club. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"It hurts a little bit when you see people (putting down scouting). The biggest 
way that it hurts is they don't know what they're talking about. They haven't 
been in Scouts, and they're missing things. It's like, 'You wouldn't say that 
if only you knew what it was like.' " 
</P>
<P>
Maarten VanGestel, a 14-year-old freshman at El Toro High, agreed: "Some people 
do have that attitude, but then I tell them what we do, and they don't say 
anything anymore. They've never climbed Mt. Whitney, gone rock climbing or 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
VanGestel, who has climbed Mt. Whitney, has also camped in the Sierra Nevada, 
learned first aid and become a certified lifeguard through scouting. He used 
his lifeguarding skills at a wheelchair sports camp at Saddleback College last 
spring vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"Scouting has helped me learn leadership, and I've made a lot of friends 
through scouting," VanGestel said. 
</P>
<P>
Girl Scouts "is like a whole different set of friendships," said Cheri Keller, 
a 16-year-old junior at Mission Viejo High. "We're all really close, and it's 
like a second family." 
</P>
<P>
Through scouting, Keller said, she has participated in several service 
projects, such as working with the Red Cross to assemble friendship kits -- 
shampoo, conditioner and hairbrushes -- for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives you self-confidence and makes you more aware of what's going on in 
the community," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Between community service, interest projects for patches and camping trips, 
scouting can sometimes interfere with school activities. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of competition out there from school activities and all," the 
Girl Scout Council's Carlson said, "but the girls we get are usually involved 
in sports or honor society or something else, and they have learned to juggle 
all of that." 
</P>
<P>
This year, a senior scouting event in Newport Harbor that will instruct girls 
in maritime skills such as rigging and Morse Code will be held on the weekend 
of El Toro's prom. 
</P>
<P>
Often, El Toro High's Varma said, Scouts "have to choose between Girl Scouts 
and something else." 
</P>
<P>
Varma, who originally left scouting because she anticipated a busier schedule 
in junior high, said: "My parents were happy when I dropped out. They thought I 
was taking too much on. 
</P>
<P>
"There are times when I wish I wasn't in (Scouts) so I could do other things, 
but I think it's worth it. To be really committed to Girl Scouts is just 
something that makes me feel good about myself." 
</P>
<P>
Jason Miller, 16, a sophomore at El Toro High, said scouting has helped build 
his self-image. 
</P>
<P>
"I've learned that I can do a lot more than I thought I could do," he said. "I 
never thought I could hang on the side of a cliff face while rock climbing, but 
I've done that in scouting. And I never thought I'd get used to leading people, 
but I've done that in scouting." 
</P>
<P>
Added Jedynak: "I learned things about myself, things about leadership, how to 
deal with people, dealing with the public, all these different skills that 
there would have been no chance for me to get anywhere else. I couldn't have 
gotten it from varsity sports or marching band or anything like that.

   SANTA ANA, Calif. -- Everyone knew Doc Noss was a
character, but the story he told one day in 1937 was the
topper: While hunting on isolated Victorio Peak in New
Mexico, he had found 16 thousand gold bars. And not only
that: The gold was guarded by 27 skeletons lashed to wooden
posts.
   Two generations later, a model of Victorio Peak is
enshrined in a plastic cube in one corner of Terry Delonas's
cramped office here. "We want to open every cave in that peak
and solve this once and for all," says Mr. Delonas, the
42-year-old son of Doc's stepdaughter. "I don't want my
brother's children or my own offspring haunted by this for
another generation."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The story of the treasure of Victorio Peak is, in its own
way, a sweeping saga of America, wrapping together Jesse
James, nuclear weapons -- even Watergate. Now, finally, Doc's
mystery may be solved. With approval from the U.S. Congress
-- necessary because Victorio Peak is part of the top-secret
White Sands Missile Range -- the family can once again search
for the treasure. Digging could begin within months.
   The sombrero-shaped peak has plagued Mr. Delonas's family
for three generations and has been his obsession for a
decade. "There was a high level of frustration at watching my
grandmother being ignored and laughed at for decades," he
says. "When she died, I took up the gauntlet."
   In that time, he has abandoned a career in advertising,
borrowed money from relatives, driven a battered truck and
lived in rented rooms, all in the hope of mounting one last
search for the treasure. He has also persuaded friends and
acquaintances to pledge more than $1 million to hire lawyers,
lobbyists and engineers for the effort in return for a share
of the possible profits. He is general partner of the Ova
Noss Family Partnership, named for his long-suffering
grandmother.
   "I guess I'm not convinced there is something out there,
but I am convinced that they have the right to find out,"
says Santa Ana financial consultant Edward Carpenter, an
investor in the project. "They have the right to purge this
devil from their family."
   Still, like his grandmother before him, Mr. Delonas
remains a target for skeptics such as former New Mexico state
historian Myra Ellen Jenkins. After investigating the
Victorio Peak legend for two decades, she describes the story
as "absolutely ludicrous" and its source, Milton "Doc" Noss,
as "a con man."
   Doc, a traveling foot doctor who may or may not have had a
medical license, was known for his dead-eye marksmanship,
dark good looks and drunken binges. When he found the cache,
he said it consisted of Spanish artifacts, old Wells Fargo
chests and 100 tons of crude gold bars. "We can make John D.
Rockefeller look like a tramp," he is said to have told his
wife at the time.
   Doc supposedly hauled out between 80 and 200 gold bars,
burying most in the surrounding desert, but selling a few to
pay expenses. With private ownership of large amounts of gold
illegal at the time, local lawmen soon heard about this. An
Albuquerque-based agent of the U.S. Secret Service, in charge
of investigating gold cases for the Treasury Department,
looked into rumors that Doc was using the proceeds to buy
guns for Mexican revolutionaries. While that proved to be
false, Secret Service agents investigated Victorio Peak
rumors well into the 1960s.
   Meanwhile, an engineer Doc hired to widen the shaft
accidentally dynamited it shut in 1939. Doc subsequently
abandoned Ova and her children from her previous marriage.
Mrs. Noss and her children continued trying to reopen the
shaft after World War II. Doc Noss returned in 1949 with a
new bride and a Texas businessman who had agreed to bankroll
his efforts to reopen the cavern. Their partnership ended
badly a few months later: The Texan shot and killed Doc,
allegedly after Doc failed to deliver some gold bars as
promised. Self-defense, said the Texan.
   Chased from the site by the Army in 1955, Ova continued
battling the military for access. After some airmen from
nearby Hollowell Air Force Base claimed they had discovered a
cave full of gold at the peak, the Army and the Secret
Service secretly began digging in August 1961. For five days,
the airmen -- joined by military police, several military
officers and a Secret Service agent -- tried unsuccessfully
to find the cave again. One of the airmen later passed a lie
detector test.
   Work by the military continued intermittently until that
November, when two local cowboys wandered onto the effort.
They tipped off Ova Noss, who raised Cain with state
officials and got the dig stopped.
   In 1963, the Army allowed an expedition, including Mrs.
Noss, to search for the gold, but that expedition went broke
before its permit expired. Frustrated by frequent security
breaches by fortune hunters, the Army declared the case
closed.
   And it might have stayed that way if not for an apparently
offhand comment made by former White House counsel John Dean
during the 1973 Watergate hearings. Testifying about politics
in the Nixon White House, Mr. Dean said that attorney F. Lee
Bailey had asked former Attorney General John Mitchell
earlier that year for advice on how some unnamed clients
could legally remove a cache of gold bars hidden in the
Victorio Peak area.
   Although the Senate panel didn't delve further into the
issue, the mention on national television stirred up renewed
interest in the legend. That led the Army to allow a 1977 dig
by a contentious group of competing claimants that included
the Ova Noss family, Apache Indian leaders who believed
ancestors had hidden the treasure and a group claiming the
gold had been stashed away by their ancestor, Jesse James.
   That dig, too, proved fruitless. Such failures were a deep
disappointment for Mr. Delonas. Victorio Peak had been the
focal point of his childhood. His mother, aunts and uncles,
all stepchildren of Doc Noss, had all worked on the mystery.
Instead of reading comic books as a boy, Terry had listened
to his grandmother's treasure tales and sat in on her
meetings with lawyers and mining engineers. He had tagged
along when she stomped off to buttonhole local politicians or
barge in on missile range commanders.
   "You just could not be as close as I was to that woman and
not be driven to finish the game," says Mr. Delonas, who sold
his small New Mexico mail-order business after his
grandmother died in 1979 and devoted himself to carrying on
her legacy.
   Hoping to raise money, make political contacts and
possibly drum up Hollywood interest in the Victorio Peak
legend, he moved here to Southern California. To make ends
meet, he worked at various times as a supermarket controller,
a savings and loan advertising executive and a member of a
radioactive waste clean-up crew at a nuclear power plant. Mr.
Delonas is unmarried; his only brother has helped the cause
financially.
   During his free hours, Mr. Delonas relentlessly contacted
potential investors, senators and Pentagon officials. He
crisscrossed the country tracking down old documents and
videotaping interviews with aging associates of Ova and Doc.
More than a dozen people claimed to have seen parts of the
treasure trove.
   But other evidence, including a deposition from a state
mining engineer who said he had secretly had a bar tested
while Doc was drunk, seemed to indicate that at least some of
the "gold" bars Doc sold were actually brass or copper.
   Mr. Delonas is confident that better financing and
improved technology will allow the new dig to succeed where
others have failed. Unlike previous digs that relied on dusty
recollections, the current effort has involved the use of
sophisticated ground radar equipment to map potential
openings inside the mountain. Last year, that equipment
detected what appears to be an underground cavern in the
location Ova and Doc described.
   Mr. Delonas worries that another fortune hunter may have
located and removed the gold long ago. In rare moments, he
also fears that he could turn out to be the latest victim of
a spectacular con dreamed up decades ago. But he figures that
he and his family win no matter what. "We would love to make
a discovery," he says, "but even if we don't we've
accomplished our mission and laid to rest this mystery that
has plagued my family for three generations.
   "As a family, we rest in peace after this."
