<HEAD>Anne Frank Letters Sold At Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two letters and a postcard written by Anne Frank
and her sister, Margot, were sold to an anonymous bidder at an
auction Tuesday for $150,000.
   The young Jewish Holocaust victims mailed the notes along with
two photographs to American pen pals in 1940, a month before Nazi
Germany invaded the Netherlands, prompting the Franks to go into
hiding.
   The successful bidder said he represented ``a number of
institutions'' but would not specify further, said Will Bennett,
spokesman for Swann Galleries, the auction house. However, the
bidder did say he would announce on Wednesday the name of the
institution where the letters will be kept, Bennett said.
   Also on the auction block were pages from Thomas Edison's
notebooks, Marilyn Monroe's certificate of conversion to Judaism,
and a collection of Greta Garbo correspondence.
   Bidding for the Frank collection was over in five minutes. Swann
had predicted bidding would exceed $30,000 but could not estimate
how high it would go because nothing written by Anne Frank had ever
been auctioned.
   Among the bidders for the letters was actress Whoopi Goldberg,
one of hundreds who participated in the auction by telephone. About
250 people attended the sale in person.
   The correspondence between the two sisters and their pen pals in
Iowa was dated April 27 and April 29, 1940. It described the girls'
life at home and school in Amsterdam. Margot wrote that ``having a
frontier with Germany and being a small country we never feel safe.''
   A month after the letters were sent, Germany invaded the
Netherlands. The Franks went into hiding but were later discovered
and sent to concentration camps. Anne's diary, published in 1952,
carries a poignant account of their life in hiding.
   The Franks' pen-pals were sisters from Danville, Iowa: Juanita
Wagner, 11, who was Anne's age, and Betty Ann Wagner, 15, who was
Margot's age. The Wagner sisters wrote back, but never heard from
the Frank girls again.
   After the war, they wrote again, and Anne's father replied,
explaining that he was the only one in his family to survive the war.
   The Wagner sisters, now living in California, decided earlier
this year to sell the letters. ``We had been discussing what I was
going to do to retire. I've never really saved very much,'' said
Betty Ann Wagner, who was reached by telephone at her home in the
Los Angeles area.
   Miss Wagner also said she plans to donate part of the money from
the sale to Wayfarer Ministries, a non-profit organization she
founded nine years ago to ship books to missionaries.
   She and her sister hope to travel to Amsterdam to visit the house
where Anne hid with her family, Miss Wagner said. ``We'd worried
about her during the war but never dreamed that she was suffering.''
   Also sold at the auction were several Marilyn Monroe autographs,
including her certificate of conversion to Judaism, which took place
just prior to her marriage to playwright Arthur Miller. The
certificate was bought by a private collector for $7,000, Bennett
said.
   A handwritten letter of condolence from Emily Dickinson to the
husband of a friend who died brought $8,000 from a dealer, he said.
   Seventy-six pages of handwritten notes by Thomas Edison brought
$32,000. Edison compiled the manuscript, which concerns his travels,
jobs and inventions, for use by his official biographers, Bennett
said.
   A collection of correspondence from Greta Garbo was bought by a
collector for $9,500, Bennett said.

   Two women who were pen pals with Anne Frank and
her sister have sold the correspondence at auction for $150,000 and
plan to use the money to retire and to fund an organization for
Christian missionaries.
   The anonymous buyer, who also paid a 10 percent fee to the
auction house, will give the letters to the Simon Wiesenthal Center
in Los Angeles, according to The New York Times.
   The women had hoped the buyer would put the letters, which are in
English, in a setting where they can be viewed publicly.
   ``We enjoyed them for 48 years, and we're just hoping that maybe
the world will get to see them,'' said Betty Ann Wagner.
   Miss Wagner and her sister Juanita wrote to Anne and her sister,
Margot, in 1940 at the suggestion of a teacher in their
then-hometown of Danville, Iowa. At the time, Anne and Juanita were
11; Margot and Betty Ann were 15.
   Anne and Margot sent back two photographs, a postcard and two
letters describing their life in Amsterdam, Holland. Margot wrote
that ``having a frontier with Germany and being a small country we
never feel safe.''
   The Wagners wrote back, but never heard from the Franks again.
   A month after the letters were sent, Germany invaded the
Netherlands. The Franks, who were Jewish, went into hiding in the
attic of a house in Amsterdam but were later discovered and sent to
concentration camps. Anne's diary, published in 1952, carries a
poignant account of their life in hiding.
   ``We'd worried about her during the war, but never dreamed she
was suffering,'' said Miss Wagner, reached at her home in the Los
Angeles area.
   She added that she and her sister, who also lives in California,
hope to visit the house in Amsterdam where the Franks hid.
   After the war, the Wagners wrote to the Franks again. Anne's
father replied to say that he was the only one in his family to
survive the war.
   Rhonda Barad, director of the Wiesenthal center's eastern region,
said the letters would be exhibited at a new museum in Los Angeles
when it is completed next year.
   ``We wanted the letters,'' said Barad, whose organization is
named for the famed Nazi hunter. ``The focus of the center is to
teach tolerance and that's what Anne Frank's diary and her life
represent.''
   Miss Wagner said she plans to donate part of the money from the
sale to Wayfarer Ministries, a non-profit organization she founded
nine years ago to help Christian missionaries around the world.
   The auction house, Swann Galleries, had predicted that bidding
would exceed $30,000 but could not estimate how high it would go
because nothing written by Anne Frank had ever been auctioned before.

<HEAD>Replica Of World's First Motion Picture Studio Rededicated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MELANIE MADER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rededication of a replica of the
world's first motion picture studio, where Thomas Edison produced
such films as ``The Great Train Robbery,'' has some movie buffs
hoping more films will be made there.
   Friday's ceremony at the recently renovated studio kicked off a
five-year fund-raising campaign.
   Supporters of the Edison National Historic Site want to raise at
least $5 million to help build an auditorium where students and
others could perform in films and to make the more than 400,000
artifacts at the site easily accessible to visitors.
   Special movie-making demonstrations are planned over the weekend
to mark the 100th anniversary today of Edison's filing legal
protection for his kinetograph, the forerunner of the modern-day
motion picture camera.
   Edison dubbed the studio ``Black Maria,'' an old slang term for
a black police paddy wagon, which it resembles. Besides the Black
Maria, the historic site is home to Edison's library, laboratory,
research and development complex and Victorian mansion.
   ``One of the great things about the site is that Edison's
inventions are here. They work. Visitors can participate and
touch,'' said Fahy Whitaker, who supervises the site's staff for
the National Park Service.
   At least 12,000 students a year, mainly from New Jersey, tour
the Edison site and learn about filmmaking, Ms. Whitaker said.
   ``Part of our plans are to have a movie made here. But we're not
sure what,'' Ms. Whitaker said.
   Edison, also famous for his work at a Menlo Park lab, is said to
have built the West Orange laboratory in 1887 to develop inventions
quickly and cheaply. There he also perfected the phonograph and the
alkaline battery.
   Friday's visitors watched as actress Ruth Warrick of ABC-TV's
``All My Children'' and other volunteers portrayed a scene from
``The Great Train Robbery'' inside the studio.
   The original black tar paper studio, a separate building next to
others that house Edison artifacts, was designed and constructed by
the inventor in 1893 at his West Orange laboratory. Edison tore
down the first studio in 1903; the reproduction was constructed 50
years later.
   Like the original, the replica has a roof that opens to provide
sunlight for filming.
   Money for the studio renovation was donated by the National Tour
Association, the largest group-travel organization in the United
States.
   ``What we wanted to do is take a site lesser known or lesser
used in the national park system and focus on it so people
understand that the national parks are more than Yellowstone,''
said Jim Host, the group's executive vice president.

PEOPLE: EDISON PORTRAYER TRIES TO GET KIDS TO TURN ON TO SCIENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
Thomas Edison is alive and well. Just ask Drew Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
Better yet, ask most of the elementary school students in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell the kids I'm 143 years old and that makes them worry about me," said 
Wilson, 65, who talks to an estimated 25,000 students a year in his one-man 
Thomas Edison show at school assemblies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm up there to leave them fired up and ready to do something, to be 
inventors, just like Edison," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time Wilson challenges them to win his Great Idea Award. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's invent something; let's come up with a great idea," he urges and at the 
same time points out that Edison had 1,093 patents. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not up there just to give them 45 minutes of distraction," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson acknowledged that he sometimes has a difficult task. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tough to reach a bunch of little kids. They have an attention span of 
about a minute and a half," he said during an interview in the back yard of his 
Mission Viejo home. 
</P>
<P>
But the former commercial art teacher, who has experience in community theater 
with his wife, Bonnie, experiences a good time during the talks that he 
sometimes gives five times a week. 
</P>
<P>
He often invents stories when the children question him about being Edison, who 
died Oct. 18, 1931. 
</P>
<P>
"I tell them I have a time machine that helps me make the crossover from myself 
to Edison," he said. "Young kids don't have trouble with that. It's when we 
turn them into adults that things fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
Although he retired from teaching four years ago, "I'm going to keep this going 
as long as I can," he said. "This is too much fun. It's not work, it's sheer 
pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has researched his alter ego extensively, partly because of his 
admiration of Edison since his own school days. 
</P>
<P>
"I like most everything about the man, including his sayings, especially, 
"Genius is 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
During some of his talks, Wilson moves from the stage into the audience to give 
the children a close-up look at his vintage seersucker suits, like the ones 
Edison wore, and his shock of white hair, which he parts on the left side as 
Edison did. 
</P>
<P>
"I look enough like Edison to get my point across," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Quite naturally he works for the Southern California Edison Co. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a free rein about what I'm going to say in my talk," said Wilson, an 
antique-car buff and an Angels baseball fan. "Mostly I want to interest the 
children in science." 
</P>
<P>
But he adds: "I honestly believe reaching out to kids is as close to 
immortality as I'm going to get. Some are going to take part of what I told 
them and do something great. Who knows what they might build someday?" 
</P>
<P>
Besides schools, Wilson also addresses community and professional 
organizations, such as the Edison Electric Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said his dream is to play Edison on television. 
</P>
<P>
He continues to act, most recently on television's "Divorce Court," playing the 
part of a husband having an affair and being threatened with divorce. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the kids who saw the show came up to me and asked if Mr. Edison was 
going to get a divorce," Wilson said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
Yet another letter has arrived about an Orange County person with an unusual 
name. 
</P>
<P>
This one is Frontis D. Evins III of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like the name when I was growing up," said Evins, who went by the 
nickname Dubby. "But I like it now." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, he hopes someday to have a son named Frontis D. Evins IV. 
</P>

   When Philip B. Petersen was convicted in
1986 of stealing more than $200,000 worth of historical documents
from the Thomas A. Edison National Historic Site, he promised to
give all the artifacts back.
   Petersen, 68, admitted Friday that he hadn't kept his word.
   The former Stanford University professor pleaded guilty to
selling more artifacts from the museum, admitting that he had hidden
some of his booty from federal agents investigating the heist three
years ago.
   Petersen, of Redwood City, Calif., faces up to 20 years in prison
after entering the plea in U.S. Federal District Court.
   Federal officials said Petersen visited the museum in West
Orange, N.J., about 30 times between 1974 and 1976 on the pretense
that he was conducting historical research on Edison's invention of
the phonograph.
   In 1985, officials seized $200,000 worth of letters, artifiacts,
sketches and equipment from Petersen's home after being tipped by a
North Carolina collector who had bought several documents from him.
   Petersen pleaded guilty to stealing the documents, and was
sentenced to two months in prison and five years probation. He is
currently in the third year of that probation, officials said.
   The plea agreement required Petersen to turn over all of the
stolen artifacts to federal officials. But officials recently were
tipped by a California collector that Petersen had asked to be put
in touch with Japanese customers who might be interested in Edison
artifacts.
   In a raid last October, federal agents recovered more than 180
Edison-related items from Petersen's house.
   ``The first time around, because there was such a large amount of
items recovered, it was impossible to tell if there was anything
left,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin McCarthy. ``We believe
this is it, though.''
   Fahy Whitaker, superintendent of the West Orange historic site,
said many of the items recovered in the two FBI raids were ``one of
a kind things.''
   ``They all add to our understanding of Edison and how he
worked,'' Ms. Whitaker said. ``We're happy we've gotten these back,
but we know there is more out there. He sold a lot of it.''

For four weeks, 38 fifth-grade students used paint and brushes to create their 
own images of a parade on three 4-by-8 feet sheets of plywood. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, their moment had come. They gathered at the Pasadena Hilton to see 
the unveiling of the murals, designed and painted solely by the students with 
the direction of Los Angeles Muralist Glenna Boltuch Avila. They used the theme 
Fantasy Parade, depicting parade scenes as seen through the eyes of the 
students, Hilton spokeswoman Marge Gammon said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pasadena Hilton -- in cooperation with the Adopt-A-School Program, the 
Armory Center for the Arts and the Thomas Edison Elementary School -- sponsored 
the mural painting program, Gammon said. 
</P>
<P>
Students from Thomas Edison Elementary School in Altadena were chosen to create 
the murals to teach them a new art form and to brighten the front of the hotel, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
The murals will be on display for about a month, while the Hilton's new lobby, 
lounge and restaurant are under construction. After the renovations are 
completed, the murals may be placed inside the hotel, Gammon said. Luz

PEOPLE: WEIGHT LOSER TURNS WEIGHT LIFTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Three years ago Gretchen Buerki powered her way through an arduous diet to lose 
35 pounds, dropping her to 130 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Then she turned around and deliberately put it all back on. And more. 
</P>
<P>
"I started my weight loss program with aerobics and a little weightlifting to 
tone my body," the Fullerton High School teacher said. "I didn't know it would 
take me to weight-lifting competition." 
</P>
<P>
She currently is in heavy training to compete in her age and weight division in 
the 1990 International Power Lifting Competition on July 22 in Leningrad and 
July 24 in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
Deciding to put the weight back on in order to compete was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was thin, I liked it," said Buerki, a graduate of Scripps College in 
Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
But the 47-year-old Fullerton resident, who stands 5 feet, 7 1/2 inches, 
decided she liked power lifting better. Now her trainer wants to see her at 180 
pounds in order to help her lift heavier weights. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it today as much as I did when I started three years ago," said Buerki, 
who didn't take weight lifting seriously until 1987, when she entered her first 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
There were nine women competing in that contest. 
</P>
<P>
"I ended up ninth, but it showed me I could do it and I liked that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Buerki said people at the La Mirada Athletic Club, where she lifted weights as 
part of her diet training, were impressed and urged her to enter competitions. 
</P>
<P>
"But I told them I was too old and there was no way I wanted to do that," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
However, while lifting weights with other women in the gym, "I found I was very 
strong and could lift weights very well." 
</P>
<P>
Buerki, a resource specialist who teaches children with learning disabilities 
in reading, writing and spelling, entered some contests and then started 
setting weight-lifting goals for herself. 
</P>
<P>
Her first goal was 100 pounds and now her goal is to break the dead-lift record 
of 165 pounds for women ages 45 to 49. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of all, I always want to do my personal best, because if you break the 
record there will always be someone who can outlift you," she said. "I don't 
want to compare myself with others." 
</P>
<P>
No matter what she does in weight lifting, Buerki has a big group of 
supporters, especially the students at her school. 
</P>
<P>
"The kids at school really love it," she said. "They ooh and aah and like to 
feel my biceps, and they really seem to respect what I do." 
</P>
<P>
Of her weight lifter's physique, she said: "I don't feel any less feminine. I'm 
still a very feminine person." 
</P>
<P>
She is married to Robert Buerki, 48, a business consultant, and has a daughter, 
Noel, 19. "She's my biggest fan and my husband is my biggest booster," Buerki 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Weight lifting may lead to other pursuits, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel someday that power lifting will open other thoughts in my mind, 
including helping others as their personal trainer or something," she said. 
"It's kind of a whole new world opening up for me and I don't know where it 
will take me." 
</P>
<P>
Neil Maken repairs antique phonographs and collects Thomas Edison artifacts in 
his Huntington Beach home business called Yesterday Once Again. 
</P>
<P>
So when Phillip B. Peterson, 68, a former Stanford University professor, wanted 
to sell him some extremely rare Edison autographs, Maken became suspicious and 
called the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
It was later discovered that the Edison autographs and other items were stolen 
from the Thomas A. Edison National History Site in West Orange, N.J., and 
Peterson was sentenced to three months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI had wired Maken to record a meeting with Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot of fun working with the FBI," Maken said. "It's an experience 
most of us never have." 
</P>
<P>

   It's a story fit for the movies.
   Two of this country's greatest inventors, George Eastman and
Thomas Edison, got together one day to discuss the motion picture
industry they were helping create.
   Eastman already had invented the process to make long rolls of
film and Edison had patented his movie camera. Both were comparing
notes and seeking refinements.
   At one point, Eastman, founder of the Eastman Kodak Co.,
supposedly asked Edison how wide the camera film should be. Edison,
holding thumb and forefinger about an inch apart, said, ``About so
wide.''
   That width, 1] inches, better known as 35mm, became and remains
the standard size for the black celluloid that's been used for a
century to hold the dramas, comedies and happy endings that appear
on the silver screen.
   Who knows if the story is true. It's been told so many times,
altered and edited, that it's impossible to determine exactly when
or even if the conversation occurred, said Kodak spokesman Henry
Kaska.
   ``You just have to say, `Legend has it ...,''' Kaska said.
   This year Kodak is celebrating its 100th anniversary making movie
film, which in terms of miles manufactured is the photo giant's
leading film product.
   ``1889 is the year we sold our first length of motion picture
film _ to Thomas Edison, that much we're sure of,'' Kaska said.
   Edison opened a production company and released 5,000 movie
titles _ shorts of vaudeville acts or boxing matches _ by 1900. He
is credited with starting the entertainment form.
   Kodak always has maintained a subtle role in the movie business,
supplying generations of filmmakers, from pioneers like Edwin S.
Porter, D.W. Griffith and Cecil B. DeMille to today's kingpins like
Stephen Spielberg and Francis Ford Coppola.
   For many years, Kodak was the only practical supplier of film to
the burgeoning industry and today the company still dominates.
   Its low profile dates to the days of Eastman, who refused to
enter the movie production business and insisted on accepting cash
in advance for movie film, never a share of profits.
   ``George Eastman didn't trust filmmakers. If a film lost money,
he didn't want to lose with it,'' said Chris Horak, curator of film
at the International Museum of Photography in Rochester, where Kodak
is based.
   Moviemakers constantly visited the company offering a percentage
of their profits to Kodak in exchange for free film, but always have
been rejected.
   That policy remains in effect.
   Horak said the no-free-film rule also applies to a Kodak program
that supports young filmmakers who can't afford to buy film.
   ``They give them money and tell them to buy the film,'' Horak
said.
   Kodak's movie division also maintains a low profile within the
company because the division generates about $350 million a year in
sales, a fraction of the company's $17 billion in annual sales.
   Nonetheless, Kodak remains the overwhelming favorite among
moviemakers worldwide, said Jean Turner, associate editor of
American Cinematographer.
   The magazine, published by the American Society of
Cinematographers, has been interviewing moviemakers for 70 years and
nearly all have said they use Kodak film.
   ``We do 12 issues a year and talk to at least three
cinematographers in each issue. I would say we usually find one or
two that don't use Kodak film. In 1988, we didn't have anyone,''
Turner said.
   Horak said without Kodak in the early 1900s, there wouldn't have
been a thriving movie business. Today Kodak is by far the leading
seller of all movie film in America, although Fuji Photofilm Co., of
Japan, and Agfa-Gevaert AG, of West Germany, have started winning
acceptance.
   ``The foreign film has gained in quality over the past couple of
years and as a result I think more people are starting to think
about using it,'' said Fred Austin, vice president of Deluxe
Laboratories Inc. in Hollywood, Calif.
   DeLuxe printed about half of all the Hollywood movies last year,
and Austin said about 80 percent of the film it uses is Kodak-made.
   Fuji and Agfa films are attractive, Austin said, because a studio
can usually get a discount by buying a certain amount of film, a
practice Kodak refuses to offer.
   So, while filmmakers may insist on using Kodak film to shoot
movies, a studio may insist on another film to make the 1,000 copies
sent to movie theaters worldwide.
   ``More and more over the years, it's the bottom line that
counts,'' said Austin.
   There are primarily two kinds of movie film: negative film, used
in the camera when a movie is shot; and print film, which runs
through a theater screen projector.
   The moviemaking process is identical to taking camera
photographs, involving a negative converted to a print.
   The average movie, at 90 feet of film a minute, is about about
90,000 to 120,000 feet long. However, much more is used en route to
the final product.
   Kodak estimates filmmakers use at least 20 times more negative
film than the finished product requires, which means an average
movie might use 1.8 million feet of film.
   If 1,000 prints are needed, a studio must buy 90 million feet of
print film.
   Kodak sells its most popular negative film in a 400-foot roll
priced at about 34 cents a foot. Its most popular print film comes
in a 4,000-foot roll costing about 6 cents a foot.
   Fuji sells its most versatile negative film for about 31 cents a
foot.
   Increased competition may be one reason Kodak is blowing its horn
about its long history in movies.
   Although the company has won five Oscars, three Emmys and two
special scientific awards for technical breakthroughs in the movie
industry, Kodak still feels a little taken for granted, company
officials said.
   Kodak's role in the movie business is not unlike Texaco's or
Mobil's role in the automobile industry, said Joerge Agin, vice
president and general manager of Kodak's Motion Picture and
Audiovisual Products Division.

   From the days when inventor Thomas
Edison's light bulb first lit the nights of 1879, Americans have
been regarded as naturally inventive and creative.
   Much of that innovation derives from the work of scientists and
engineers at General Electric's Research and Development Center,
which traces its roots to the Edison Electrical Light Company formed
in 1878 to support the experiments of Thomas Edison.
   GE scientists brainstormed the magnetic resonance imager, which
uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create pictures of internal
organs without X-rays.
   Real diamonds were concocted in one of their laboratories, not
pulled from the depths of the earth.
   In 1979, GE was the first company to pass the 50,000th patent
mark.
   But GE's _ and America's _ technological lead is being threatened
by the Japanese who, up until now, have had a reputation as clever
copycats.
   Since the end of World War II, the Japanese have borrowed
American inventions, improved them and turned them into inexpensive
household staples. Color television sets, transistor radios and
videocassettee recorders were all original American ideas the
Japanese have capitalized on.
   All that is changing.
   The Japanese are no longer content to pick the brains of American
scientists and engineers for new technology, says Roland W. Schmitt,
president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy and former
vice president of corporate research and development at GE.
   The Japanese are trying to be innovators, Schmitt says.
   Their aggressive patenting efforts prove that. Japan now acquires
more patents worldwide than any other country.
   Schmitt says the United States still leads the way in developing
new technology. ``But Japan is now in a stage where they're starting
to do this,'' he said.
   Japanese business executives say it's only natural for their
companies to develop their own technology.
   ``Any company that hopes to continue making progress will require
innovation, be it through its own or transferred technology,'' said
Kazuya Hosaka, manager of Hitachi Ltd.'s patent office in Tokyo.
   Many in this country question whether the Japanese can be
pioneering.
   The Japanese acquire hundreds of patents each year, they're quick
at turning inventions into products and their students study science
and technology in an education system considered superior in those
areas.
   But they're strangled by a culture that frowns upon risk-taking
and prizes collective action over individual effort. Their
scientists and engineers aren't trained to be pioneering.
   Americans, meanwhile, are encouraged to be creative.
   ``We educate our scientists to be pioneers,'' Schmitt said.
   A recent study for the National Science Foundation showed that in
1987, three Japanese companies garnered the most U.S. patents:
Hitachi with 873, Canon with 850 and Toshiba with 830.
   GE, which until 1986 had held the No. 1 spot for 25 years, was
fourth with 782 patents.
   GE executives at the company's R&amp;D center, located in a sprawling
complex of buildings overlooking the Mohawk River, dispute the
results of the patent study done by Computer Horizons, a consulting
company. They argue GE would still rank as patent leader if the
study had included patents granted to RCA, which GE acquired in 1986.
   ``Whoever did the study obviously didn't know RCA was a
subsidiary of GE,'' said James C. Davis Jr., manager of patent and
legal operations at GE.
   Top GE officials, though, see the study as a warning.
   ``It doesn't mean we shouldn't be concerned,'' said Walter Robb,
vice president of corporate research and development at GE. ``There
are still three Japanese companies in the top four.''
   Moreover, the Japanese are beating the United States is their
ability to rapidly commercialize inventions, such as the VCR.
   ``We get out of the starting block fast,'' Schmitt said. ``But we
lose it on the long stretch. We've lost the ability to do the long
haul.''
   America's best hope in its competition with Japan may be its
education system. The United States is far ahead of Japan in an area
vital to technological and scientific development: the encouragement
of creative thought.
   Yet serious problems exist in America's education system.
   ``We have fewer and fewer students with an interest in science
and technology,'' said Schmitt, a former chairman of the National
Science Board.
   He believes that for the United States to remain No. 1 in science
and technology it must, in some ways, imitate the Japanese.
   ``The Japanese understand that manufacturability and customer
preferences are integral parts of the innovation process, not
afterthoughts,'' Schmitt said. ``I see no reason why we Americans
can't renew our skills at the application of science and technology
while maintaining our strength as pioneers.''

   Your Oct. 13 page-one story on the renewed plight of Western Union says that Western Union had lost its chance to be in the telephone business by turning down Alexander Graham Bell's offer to it of his invention, because it supposedly felt that voice communication would never replace the telegraph. 

   Such is hardly the case. 
Bell's father-in-law, Gardner G. Hubbard, wealthy and well-connected, obtained financing to start the American Bell Telephone Co. in Boston, which even had a subsidiary in New York called the Telephone Co. of New York. 
This is where Bell's patents went. 

   Western Union indeed wanted to get into the telephone business. 
It acquired Thomas Edison's microphone patent and then immediately sued the Bell Co. claiming that the microphone invented by my grandfather, Emile Berliner, which had been sold to Bell for a princely $50,000, infringed upon Western Union's Edison patent. 
When Bell established that the Berliner patent caveat was registered 10 days before Edison's application, Western Union dropped the lawsuit and agreed never to enter the telephone business -- the basis for the company's current plight.

   Norbert Rillieux and Jan Matzeliger helped
revolutionize American history with their inventions, but the two
men scarcely rate a footnote in the annals of Yankee ingenuity
simply because they were black.
   Historian Portia James is setting matters straight with an
ambitious new Smithsonian Institution exhibition that celebrates
the genius of America's unsung black inventors.
   The show, which opens Sunday, pays belated tribute to 40
inventors whose creations include a trouser-stretching device for
eliminating wrinkles, a machine for producing paper bags, a press
for baling cotton and a mechanical traffic signal patented in 1923.
   ``The exhibition says a lot about their urge to create, and how
important it was for blacks to feel they were part of the growth of
American technology,'' said Ms. James, the show's curator. ``It was
their assertion of black participation in the Yankee innovative
spirit.''
   The exhibition at the Smithsonian's Anacostia Museum of
Afro-American history and culture is titled ``The Real McCoy:
African American Invention and Innovation, 1619-1930.''
   The show's name is taken from an invention by mechanical
engineer Elijah McCoy _ a grease cup designed for lubricating rail
locomotives while they sped down the tracks. Admiring train
engineers nicknamed it ``the real McCoy.''
   On display are the two devices created by black inventors which
probably have had the greatest lasting impact on American society,
said Ms. James, a native of Detroit who is the Anacostia Museum's
resident historian.
   One of them, developed by the New Orleans inventor Rillieux in
1830, is a vacuum evaporation machine that made refined sugar
widely affordable. It later was used to produce such foods as
evaporated milk and cocoa powder.
   The other is Matzeliger's shoe-lasting machine, patented in 1883
by the inventor from Dutch Surinam. The machine radically changed
the American shoe industry by eliminating the need for costly
hand-stitching of soles to the soft leather uppers of shoes.
   The museum duly recognizes one of the few prominent black
inventors, George Washington Carver, with a sampling of the
products he derived from peanuts, soybeans and sweet potatoes in
his laboratory at Alabama's Tuskegee Institute.
   But it also highlights such unknowns as Lewis Latimer of Queens,
N.Y., the only black associate on Thomas Edison's laboratory team,
who patented a carbon light bulb filament. Another is Garrett
Morgan of Cleveland, who invented both the stop-go traffic signal
and an industrial ``safety hood'' or gas mask which he used to
rescue workers trapped by a tunnel explosion under Lake Erie.
   Ms. James notes that African slaves introduced the banjo to
American music, and that Boston clergyman Cotton Mather learned of
inoculation against smallpox from his North African slave Onesimus.
   The exhibition honors New York tailor Thomas Jennings, the first
black believed to have received a patent, for his dry cleaning
process in 1821. On display are three wood planes designed in the
1770s by Cesar Chelor, a freed slave from Wrentham, Mass., who is
believed to be the earliest black toolmaker in America.
   Ms. James said her research for the exhibition took three years
because of the scarcity of historical records.
   Material came from old newspapers and magazines published for
the black community and from an exhaustive record of pre-1900
patents awarded to black inventors that was compiled by Henry
Baker, an early black U.S. patent examiner, she said.
   Ms. James' research yielded the tale of Oscar J.E. Stuart, a
Mississippi planter who tried to obtain a patent in 1857 for a
labor-saving ``double cotton scraper'' invented by his slave, Ned.
   Stuart argued that ``the master is the owner of the fruits of
the labor of the slave both intellectual and manual,'' but the
federal government granted neither man a patent.
   Undaunted, Stuart began manufacturing Ned's creation and issued
advertising circulars containing this testimonial from a fellow
plantation owner:
   ``I am glad to know that your implement is the invention of a
Negro slave _ thus giving the lie to the Abolition cry that slavery
dwarfs the mind of the Negro. When did a free Negro ever invent
anything?''
   As for the ingenious slave, Ms. James says, ``Ned disappeared
from history, and nothing is known of what became of him.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ He's been called the ``Wizard of Weston,'' a
professional inventor who doesn't believe in wasting his time on
products that won't sell. But one of the problems inventors have,
says Stanley Mason, is selling their ideas to the companies that
employ them. To help remedy that, he's teaching a course on
creativity to a group of graduate business students.

   Inventor Stanley Mason, who lays claim to
the world's first microwave cookware, the squeezable ketchup bottle
and the granola bar, among other things, says he's seen a lot of
million-dollar ideas get lost because of a lack of vision in
corporate America.
   Like the disposable diaper he designed and the company ignored.
   Mason, who's been called ``the Wizard of Weston,'' hopes to do
his part to remedy that shortsightedness with a course on
creativity he's teaching to graduate business students at the
University of Connecticut's Stamford campus.
   The white-haired, 67-year-old inventor has a laboratory in a
two-story barn where elaborate _ and secret _ experiments are in
progress. There are blackboards and long conference tables for
brainstorming sessions.
   Mason isn't trying to turn his students into Thomas Edisons, but
he does think he can impart some of his curiosity and ability to
think creatively, which he credits for the 30 patents he holds.
   ``In large companies, people are divided up into departments
that are so insular, they don't understand what goes on in the next
office,'' Mason said during a recent interview at Simco Inc., the
product development company he founded in 1973 after a corporate
career that included stints with Hunt Foods Inc., the Glenn L.
Martin Co., Armstrong Cork Co. Inc., American Can Co. and U.S.
Steel Corp.
   ``They don't understand the totality, the continuum, the
interaction between products and consumer. It's possible, with
patience, to teach people how to think in a creative way, how to
take a tentative point of view about everything, how not to be so
damn sure about everything.''
   Norman C. Parrish of Moraga, Calif., president of the National
Congress of Inventor Organizations, calls Mason ``one of the most
widely respected inventors'' in America.
   Mason's work, he says, is ``valuable enough that Johnson &amp;
Johnson and companies of that caliber give him essentially open
contracts to come up with new products for them.''
   Most people make the mistake of thinking that being an inventor
simply means dreaming up a great idea, Mason says, but the
successful inventor is someone who recognizes the market for a
product that doesn't yet exist, and figures out how to provide it.
   ``Edison's greatest invention was not the electric light or the
phonograph,'' he says. ``His greatest invention was the product
development laboratory.
   ``Edison was a real psychologist. He knew what could sell. He
didn't invent things that couldn't sell. He didn't waste his time.''
   Mason's 15-week course consists of a series of three-hour
seminars that include lectures by successful entrepreneurs and
exercises designed to stretch the students' minds.
   For one recent assignment, he sent students into a Norwalk store
and told them to pick out a product that they as consumers thought
needed improvement. They returned to the classroom, divided up into
three companies, and spent the rest of the night playing ideas off
each other.
   ``It sort of frees one's way of thinking,'' says David Chang, a
research chemist at Clairol Inc. who is working toward his master's
in business administration. ``It will be very, very helpful to
people in technical management.''
   Mason has experienced the frustrations of corporate life
firsthand.
   In the 1970s, when he developed Masonware, which he says was the
first cookware for microwaves, Mason was told by a major American
corporation there was no market for it. Today, such cookware is a
$350 million-a-year business, he says.
   When he developed the granola bar as an alternative snack
product for Nestle S A in the 1970s, the company decided it wasn't
interested. Quaker Oats Co. and others eventually came out with
their own.
   Then there was the disposable diaper debacle. Mason was
exasperated trying to put a square diaper on his son's round bottom
_ not to mention the drudgery of laundry and those painful pricks
from safety pins.
   So when he was working for a major paper-products company, he
designed a disposable diaper lined with soft, absorbent paper,
shaped like an hourglass to fit a baby's bottom, and substituted
sticky tape for pins.
   The company patented the invention and Mason got $100 for his
efforts. The company, which he didn't want to be identified, sold
the patent rights to another corporation, which also failed to act
on the idea.
   Since then, shaped disposable diapers have become a
billion-dollar product line.
   Such lack of vision helps explain why half the patents issued in
America last year went to inventors outside the country, Mason says.
   ``Product development is a risky business,'' he says. ``There's
no security in working in product development in any U.S. company
because if the product doesn't work, they kill the messenger.''
   According to one survey, the average tenure for research
directors at American corporations is only 13 or 14 months, Mason
says.
   ``I've worked for lots of companies _ I've been fired from lots
of companies,'' he says.
   Today, Simco's clients include 40 Fortune 500 companies, such as
Johnson &amp; Johnson, Kimberly-Clark Corp., Proctor &amp; Gamble Co.,
Hunt-Wesson Foods Inc. and Primerica Corp.
   It has a full-time staff of about eight employees, plus about
125 associates, mostly academics, who provide creative input on
various projects, such as Mason's latest venture: How to get
petroleum substitutes, including fuel, from Chinese tallow trees.
   That project has been funded in part by the National Science
Foundation, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the state of
Hawaii.
   Among his other inventions: the first plastic underwire bra for
Playtex, a super-strong Velcro for Velcro Fastening Systems, a
burglar alarm that hangs on a doorknob and square milk jugs that
save shipping space.
   Mason dates his first invention to his youth, when he sold a
slingshot-like weapon to scores of friends. His inventive spirit
was nurtured by his father, an electrician who developed the first
electric chair for the state of New Jersey, Mason says.
   His first real job was as a teen-ager at the Trenton Free Public
Library, which also served as one of 12 regional depositories for
patents issued by the U.S. Patent Office. He'd spend hours poring
over other people's inventions, and realized that's what he wanted
to do with his life.
   ``Part of what I do is feed my unconscious and conscious brain
with lots of things,'' he says. ``It's furniture you move around in
your head and the more that you have there, the more connections
take place.''

<TEXT>
   BACK IN 1984, TV viewers were amused by a clever new commercial in which a man in a bar hollered "Gimme a light," but was served a flaming torch instead of a mug of beer. 
That, of course, marked the start of Anheuser-Busch's memorable "funny lights" commercials for Bud Light. 
Since then, there has been everything from a bug light to train headlights, and the ad campaign has consistently ranked as one of the 10 most popular on the air. 
Anheuser-Busch gives it much of the credit for Bud Light's sales growth of 32% in 1985 and 23% last year. 

   But now, more than 50 light gags later, the idea is wearing thin, and the company faces the inevitable question of what to do for an encore. 
It isn't an easy feat for a marketer, especially when the advertising is supposed to make people laugh. 
Consider Wendy's International Inc., which hasn't come close to duplicating the success of its "Where's the beef?" campaign. 
Or Stroh Brewery Co., which hasn't produced any blockbuster ads since its Alex the Dog commercial a few years ago. 

   "Humor is a very difficult act to follow, especially when you have a rigid one-joke format like the Bud Light ads," says Roy Grace, chairman of Grace &amp; Rothschild, a New York ad agency. 
"It's a little easier to keep a campaign going with more sophisticated humor like the Bartles &amp; Jaymes ads or the ongoing banter between James Garner and Mariette Hartley in the (old) Polaroid ads." 

   ANHEUSER-BUSCH is tackling the problem of its overworked joke in two ways. 
It is creating new ads that stick with the "funny lights" concept but freshen up the formula by moving beyond the typical bar scene. 
In addition, the brewer is expanding an offbeat marketing campaign for Bud Light that has been a hit in Hollywood and other trendy circles. 

   The unlikely star of this new campaign is a waddling English bull terrier named Spuds MacKenzie, who was expected to be only a short-term promotional gimmick for the college and young adult market. 
But "the original party animal," as Spuds is called, proved so appealing that he graduated this year to prime-time network TV. 
In the commercials, he hangs out on the beach and in nightclubs with a bottle of Bud Light and an adoring flock of beautiful women who chant, "Go, Spuds, go." 
The pooch wears a bow tie and dinner jacket and travels in a limousine in one spot; another ad shows him sporting sunglasses and a Hawaiian shirt and riding a skateboard. 
It's hardly the usual yuppie and macho beer advertising. 

   But Anheuser-Busch executives stress that Spuds will only supplement, not replace, the "funny lights" campaign. 
After all, they say, confusion about lights is an effective and entertaining way to deal with one of their major marketing challenges: persuading people to ask for the Bud Light brand in bars. 
When people simply order a light beer, bartenders are apt to serve top-selling Miller Lite. 

   THE CREATIVE STYLE of the light jokes will be evolving throughout 1987. 
"The funny lights campaign has begun to show its age, especially with people who got megadoses of it on sports programs," says Thomas Sharbaugh, group brand director at Anheuser-Busch. 
"But we still think we can get more mileage out of it if we come up with less predictable situations." 
Instead of taking place in a bar, for instance, a recent ad is set in a swimming pool where a fire-breathing monster answers the call for a light. 
Another new ad shows Thomas Edison in a library explaining how he invented the electric light. 
"Well, it's very nice, Thomas," his companion says. 
"But I wanted a Bud Light." 

   Spuds MacKenzie represents a far bigger change for Bud Light's image. 
What makes Spuds so intriguing is the fact that he was never intended to be anything more than a pin-up poster. 
It was a lucky accident that began when a young art director at the DDB Needham ad agency dreamed up the dippy dog in 1983. 
"But we didn't really understand the idea when we first saw it," says John Greening, management representative at DDB Needham. 

   Later, though, when the agency was considering a poster promotion for Bud Light, it decided to give Spuds his big break. 
The poster showing the party animal in a "Delta Omega Gamma" fraternity sweater sold briskly, leading to Spuds calendars and then last year, the first Spuds ads. 
They ran in California where, Anheuser-Busch executives say, the competition was heating up and Bud Light needed a jolt to increase its awareness level with consumers. 
Well-received in the West, Spuds finally made his bow on prime-time network TV during the Super Bowl. 

   IN ADDITION to advertising, Spuds is generating a bonanza of free publicity for Bud Light. 
The dog is scheduled for a cameo role in a Martin Mull movie and was invited last month to a party in Los Angeles for the Bangles rock group. 
What's more, Spuds merchandise is a growth business in itself. 
In a recent three-month period, a Spuds T-shirt brought in $1 million of orders. 
Also for sale: Spuds tattoos, hats, dog tags and an $875 costume. 

   "In our Spuds ads, we want to position Bud Light as the choice of with-it, young adults," says Anheuser-Busch's Mr. Sharbaugh. 
"But he has turned out to be one of those odd-looking things with an aura that people of all ages and life styles are drawn to." 

   There's always the chance, though, that Spuds could be just a short-lived fad. 
"It's novel beer advertising, but I don't think it has staying power," says Frank Assumma, management supervisor at the Backer &amp; Spielvogel ad agency, which creates commercials for Miller Lite. 
"There are only so many ways to dress up a cute dog. 
But who knows? 
Maybe they'll make it talk."

American Genesis: A Century of Invention and Technological Enthusiasm 1870-1970 
by Thomas P. Hughes (Viking: $24.95; 349 pages) 
</P>
<P>
The central thesis of Thomas P. Hughes' "American Genesis" is simple and 
compelling. The most distinctive, impressive and important achievement in 
American history is not our political system, he says, but our technology. 
</P>
<P>
We are a nation of builders. We have created modern technology and the culture 
that supports it. "Inventors, industrial scientists, engineers, and system 
builders have been the makers of modern America," Hughes writes. "The values of 
order, system, and control that they embedded in machines, devices, processes, 
and systems have become the values of modern technological culture." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes argues that the modern world is the product of a hundred years of 
invention from 1870 to 1970. It was started by a stellar group of independent 
inventors -- Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell, Lee De Forest and Orville 
and Wilbur Wright, among others -- who inexplicably emerged in the same place 
and at the same moment in history. 
</P>
<P>
In short order, these rugged individuals gave way to scientists at research 
laboratories sponsored by General Electric, AT&amp;T and other industrial 
giants. It was a subtle but important change. Big companies tend to favor 
conformity over originality, improvements in existing products over boldly 
innovative new ones. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Research Organizations 
</P>
<P>
The next stage saw the development of system builders, people like Henry Ford 
and Frederick W. Taylor, the creator of scientific management, who organized 
technologies into units of control. Electric power grids resulted, Hughes 
notes, and so, ultimately, did the Manhattan Project, which created the atomic 
bomb. 
</P>
<P>
"America's creating, building, and systematizing genius reached its zenith in a 
nuclear enterprise, or technological system, that was a culmination of almost a 
century of ever-expanding invention, industrial research, and system building 
that extended from Pearl Street, Edison's first lighting station in New York, 
to . . . Los Alamos." 
</P>
<P>
No one can gainsay the material benefits that the century of invention has 
bestowed on us. But there was a less-obvious Faustian bargain in the process. 
</P>
<P>
The early shift from independent inventor to industrial scientist presaged the 
loss of individuality that order, organization and control would eventually 
impose on everyone. Most of us today are cogs in the great economic machine. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Japanese Implications 
</P>
<P>
Hughes doesn't say it, but he might have noted that Japan's ability to beat us 
at our own game stems in large measure from the greater willingness of Japanese 
people to be those cogs. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, writers like Lewis Mumford and Jacques Ellul began to call 
attention to the downside of progress. 
</P>
<P>
"Instead of seeing and sentimentalizing the United States as essentially a 
nation of democratic politics and free-enterprise economics, the writers and 
philosophers of a counterculture probed the depth and extent of the 
mechanization and systematization of America," Hughes writes. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked what problems arose from the man-made characteristics of built 
America, from -- as Frederick W. Taylor said -- no longer putting man first, 
but putting the system first." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes, a historian of science at the University of Pennsylvania, writes with 
sweep and detail. He links diverse phenomena like the military-industrial 
complex and modern art and architecture with his overall vision that order and 
control were the inevitable result of technological progress. His is an epic 
tale told with a rhythm and cadence that match it. 
</P>
<P>
The subtheme of the individual versus the world recurs throughout the story. 
Though it was individuals who kicked off the century of invention, they were 
quickly supplanted by company men, who have remained in the driver's seat ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Death of an Inventor 
</P>
<P>
Particularly poignant is Hughes' retelling of the life of Edwin Armstrong, the 
visionary engineer who invented FM radio, only to be fought by RCA and other 
entrenched interests, who did not want their substantial investment in AM radio 
disturbed. After years of legal battles, Armstrong died a suicide in 1954. 
Hughes takes his story as symbolic of the era. 
</P>
<P>
But in the end, he does not abandon hope for a change of direction that will 
bring new values to the fore while retaining the benefits that mass technology 
has bestowed. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes recognizes that the current system and the forces behind it have 
tremendous momentum going for them. But, he insists, "Technology can be created 
and can be deployed that would heighten the quality of life, not simply the 
quantity of goods." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe so. But Hughes' haunting book makes a better case for the problem than it 
does for the solution.

Fortunetellers' Tales and Other Spring Fictions
---
By David Brooks</HL>
<DD> 02/03/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Imagination is running riot, as usual, in the world of new fiction. 
Here, for example, are a few of the spring's more diverting plot kernels: A woman, buried in the rubble of a department store, has a love affair with an advertising executive trapped nearby ("Strangers," by Rosie Thomas). 
A woman is marooned on an island with a man named Robinson Cruso, and then, back in London, feuds with a novelist named Daniel Foe when he won't write her story accurately ("Foe," by J.M. Coetzee). 
A woman lies in a coma and makes witty observations to herself as her family sues for the right to pull the plug on the machine that's keeping her alive ("Extraordinary Means," by Donna Levin). 

   How do you decide which, if any, of those stories is worth reading? 
Most readers never venture into the unknown. 
They stick to the familiar names -- Robbins, Greeley, Forsyth -- even if that means passing by some remarkable and entertaining novels. 

   Fortunately, the familiar names often come through for us. 
Steven King's latest best seller, "The Eyes of the Dragon" (Viking, 326 pages, $18.95) is a medieval legend -- and not the horror tome millions have come to expect from Mr. King. 
It is told with the eloquence -- and humility -- of an aged fireside storyteller. 

   Mr. King's style begs you to underestimate him. 
He tells a simple tale about a prince wrongly imprisoned and denied his throne by an evil magician. 
But he folds in the sort of rich familial relationships that highlight the best children's fables. 
And his plot is so carefully constructed, and expertly paced, it is like watching those great old Disney animations. 

   There are other authors, not quite as renowned, who tell ambitious stories with wit and verve. 
Through them, the reader can push back the intimidating forest of contemporary fiction. 
Susan Richards Shreve is one of these writers, judging by "Queen of Hearts" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 354 pages, $17.95). 
Ms. Shreve's protagonist is a beautiful fortuneteller, the granddaughter of a mysterious vagabond who immigrated to a small Massachusetts town and made her living singing and soliciting in the local tavern. 
The young woman shares a mystical bond with her dead grandmother, and is by novel's end almost a reincarnation. 
The townsfolk are attracted and repelled by these far-seeing women. 
They don't know whether to build them a monument or to burn them at the stake. 

   Ms. Shreve has a genius for oddball characterizations: a small boy is obsessed with lion taming; a man, unable to mature, spends his days hunting river snakes and fending off his dead mother's spirit; a failed fortuneteller retreats to an attic music room. 
These are not cliche people-are-sick-beneath-their-calm-small-town-veneer weirdos; they are subtly odd, and in the midst of this refreshingly eventful plot, they are original and intriguing. 

   Unfortunately, Ms. Shreve's talents fail her when her catastrophe-laden plot slows, or when she must create mainstream characters. 
If they are not perverse, Miss Shreve's characters are likely to be flat and colorless. 
Her men are presented as social problems -- drunks, wife beaters, homophobes -- not individuals. 

   The hero in Thomas McMahon's "Loving Little Egypt" (Viking, 273 pages, $16.95) is not magical, but he can do magical things. 
Mourly Vold is a near-blind boy with a gift for electrical engineering and mechanics. 
In 1921, he discovers how to destroy the American phone system by making clicking noises with his tongue. 
He tries to warn phone company executives that the system is flawed, but they won't listen until he begins to disrupt the system. 
Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison and William Randolph Hearst enter the picture, either on Mourly's side or against him. 

   The plot is awkward and arrives at a painfully contrived solution, but that doesn't matter, because the subject of this book is the inventive process itself. 
Mr. McMahon is a professor of applied mechanics and biology at Harvard. 
A hundred books about the creative process cannot convey the excitement and beauty of mechanical tinkering that Mr. McMahon portrays here. 
He draws a stark contrast between the madcap Bell, who is all inspiration and wonder, and Edison, a narrow-minded grind who ruthlessly pursues technological development. 
Mr. Edison is the book's villain.

States Play Expanding Role
In Funding Technology Firms

   EVERETT ELLIN turned to state grants because he couldn't bring himself to try his luck with venture capitalists again. 
His first few encounters with those financial backers were "brutalizing," he says. 

   The Santa Fe, N.M., entrepreneur's strategy proved effective. 
Over a period of four years, he and his Scantech Corp. managed to obtain $550,000 in grants from technology programs in Ohio and Pennsylvania to develop a filmless X-ray technology. 
The grants enabled Scantech to complete much of its early work and helped raise almost $750,000 in new capital through a small private placement in six states. 
This year, after completing work on a second X-ray machine for use in industry, Mr. Ellin raised $200,000 more in a stock offering limited to New Mexico residents. 

   For a growing number of technology entrepreneurs, states are providing the initial capital to get their projects off the ground. 
But unlike venture-capital seed funds, which often demand a high price for investing in risky, early-stage companies, the state programs don't demand equity. 

   "They are funding technical feasibility well before the seed funds," says Pittsburgh entrepreneur Bruce DaCosta. 
Unlike venture funds, the state programs "allow for a great deal of freedom and creativity on the part of the entrepreneur," he adds. 
More important, entrepreneurs have used such grants to develop projects and receive additional funds from venture capitalists. 

   IN THE LAST FOUR YEARS, for example, Pennsylvania's Ben Franklin Partnership has provided almost $80 million to state-based technology projects, which have then gone on to receive $280 million in private capital. 
The Massachusetts Technology Development Corporation has provided more than $10 million in seed and early-stage financing to over 40 companies which have received $180 million more in private capital. 
"We are acting as catalysts for technology entrepreneurs making the transition from a small R&amp;D project into a product-oriented technology enterprise," says John Hodgman, president of the Massachusetts agency. 

   Under Ohio's Thomas Edison Program, an entrepreneur can receive $10,000 to $50,000 to establish the technical feasibility of a project. 
Once that is established, the program provides $50,000 to $250,000 to develop the project further. 
The grant doesn't go directly to the entrepreneur but to an Ohio-based university, which becomes a research partner with the company. 

   In terms of the money small, emerging businesses really need, "the total pool of capital the states are providing is insignificant," argues David Birch, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
But the symbolism -- states' commitment to the process of small-business development -- is very important, he asserts. 

   Indeed, the states' greatest contribution "is often that of introducing people to each other whose professional paths wouldn't cross -- and to provide some financial incentives to do so," says Anne Eskesen of the Innovation Development Institute, a Swampscott, Mass., concern that monitors federal and state grants. 

   AT SCANTECH, for example, the idea of a filmless X-ray machine came out of an invention by two University of Pittsburgh physicists in 1977. 
But it wasn't until 1983 that Mr. Ellin, a high-technology consultant, saw its potential and acquired the licensing rights to the technology. 
While the Pittsburgh physicists continued to work on a medical application, Mr. Ellin recruited two Ohio State University scientists to develop an industrial use. 
In the process, he received a total of $350,000 from Ohio's fledgling Thomas Edison Program. 
The funds went directly to the university, Mr. Ellin says, but they financed research and experimentation for which Scantech couldn't dream of paying. 
In 1986, Scantech's Pittsburgh group received $200,000 from Pennsylvania's Ben Franklin Program to develop a dedicated, digital chest X-ray machine. 

   "For state programs, the real emphasis is technology and the potential it has," says Mr. DaCosta, adding, "They don't have the market orientation that venture capitalists have." 
In 1986, Mr. DaCosta and his Iconnex Corp. received $100,000 from the Ben Franklin program to develop computer software for mechanical engineers. 
After the initial feasibility work was complete, the program provided him an additional $175,000 to continue. 

   In August, Iconnex successfully raised almost $3 million from a group of venture capitalists, including the venture unit of EG&amp;G Inc., Pittsburgh's Fostin Capital Corp. and Cornerstone Ventures, San Jose, Calif. 
But without the grant money to develop the prototype, "it would have been difficult to raise money from professional investors," Mr. DaCosta says. 

   ---
   EVEN THOUGH most technology programs are funded by state governments on an annual basis, the market crash doesn't jeopardize their future, administrators say. 
"Most of the capital for these projects comes from sources which have already committed the money," notes Paul Rice, who manages venture capital investments for Michigan's public retirement system. 
"The bottom would have to drop out of the market before we would withdraw from such commitments," Mr. Rice adds. 

   States see these programs as an integral part of their economic-development strategy, argues Jacques Koppel, executive director of the Ben Franklin Partnership. 
In fact, Mr. Koppel says "If the economy goes into a downturn, the programs might receive even greater emphasis."

<HEAD>At Autograph Auction, Jimmy Carter Gets Lost In Shuffle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Babe Ruth's autograph sold for $600 and first
lady Barbara Bush's went for $350. But former President Carter's
autograph couldn't bring down the gavel, even at a bargain price of
$75.
   ``No bid,'' the auctioneer said Thursday night at a Herman
Darvick Autograph Auction.
   ``Very popular president,'' one observer said sarcastically as
some of the nearly 100 people who crowded into a Manhattan hotel
chuckled.
   Oliver North was far more popular. An autographed copy of the
former national security aide's high school yearbook sold for $450.
The yearbook shows North with a printed quote: ``I am not only witty
in myself but the cause that wit is in other men.''
   Another big seller was a Greta Garbo signature on an amended
movie contract signed March 4, 1939. The document sold for $3,850.
   ``She has the most valuable autograph of any living person,''
said Herman Darvick, whose firm specializes in celebrity signatures.
   A signed Thomas Edison patent went for $7,700 and a Benjamin
Franklin autograph was sold to a doctor from Pennsylvania for
$11,000.
   The Babe Ruth signature was splayed across a photograph of the
Bambino shaking hands with an unidentified man in a business suit.
Two campaign-related letters by Mrs. Bush, on her personal red,
white and blue stationery, were sold as one item.
   An autographed picture of President Ronald Reagan and then Vice
President Bush sold for $750. But an autographed picture of Carter
with President Gerald Ford, another slow seller, went for $140.
   ``It's hard to explain,'' Darvick said of Carter's dismal
signature value. ``He's just not selling anything, in books, checks
and letters.''
   Actually, an item billed as a ``Rare Jimmy Carter White House
Card'' which was projected to bring between $700 and $800, did sell
_ for $150. The card bore a vignette of the south portico of the
White House and was signed in facsimile by Carter.
   But mostly, the Carter autographs drew silence, like lot No. 98,
an autographed copy of Carter's book, ``Why Not The Best?''
   ``Do I hear $75?'' asked the auctioneer. ``If not, we'll pass.
... Pass on 98.''
   Former President Richard Nixon enjoyed considerably more
commercial appeal, with a letter to a reporter signed ``Dick''
selling for $500.
   Darvick said John F. Kennedy has the most sought after
presidential signature, followed by Reagan and Nixon.
   ``Kennedy became senator in 1953. Ten years later he was dead. He
had machines that signed his autograph. He's very rare in
authenticated material,'' Darvick said.
   Referring to Nixon's Watergate notoriety, Darvick said, ``It's
like going to a wax museum. People don't want to see the presidents.
They want to see the ax murderers.''

   Today's Highlight in History:
   On May 19, 1536, Anne Boleyn, the second wife of England's King
Henry VIII, was beheaded after she was convicted of adultery.
During their marriage, Anne had given birth to a daughter, who
later became Queen Elizabeth I; however, Anne fell from Henry's
favor by failing to produce any male heirs.
   On this date:
   In 1780, a mysterious darkness enveloped much of New England and
part of Canada in the early afternoon. The cause has never been
determined.
   In 1906, the Federated Boys' Clubs, forerunner of the Boys'
Clubs of America, were organized.
   In 1921, Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act, which
established national quotas for immigrants entering the U.S.
   In 1926, inventor Thomas Edison was prevailed upon to speak on
radio during the dinner of the National Electric Light Association
in Atlantic City, N.J. (Confronted with the microphone, Edison
said: ``Why, I don't know what to say. This is the first time I
ever spoke into one of these things. Good night.'')
   In 1935, T.E. Lawrence, better known as Lawrence of Arabia, died
following a motorcycle accident.
   In 1943, in an address to the U.S.Congress, British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill pledged his country's full support in
the war against Japan.
   In 1958, the United States and Canada formally established the
North American Air Defense Command.
   In 1964, the State Department disclosed that 40 hidden
microphones had been found in the U.S. embassy in Moscow.
   In 1967, the Soviet Union ratified a treaty with the United
States and Britain banning nuclear weapons from outer space.
   Ten years ago: French and Belgian paratroopers began entering
the mining town of Kolwezi in Zaire to rescue more than 2,500
Europeans caught in the fighting between Zarian government troops
and rebel forces.
   Five years ago: About 20,000 people marched in solemn silence to
a cemetery in Warsaw, Poland, to mourn Grzegorz Przemyk, a
teen-ager who died after being taken into police custody May 12,
three days before his 19th birthday.
   One year ago: Two days after 37 American sailors were killed
when an Iraqi warplane attacked the U.S. frigate Stark, President
Reagan defended the American presence in the Persian Gulf, and said
the tragedy of the Stark ``must never be repeated.''
   Today's Birthdays: PBS newscaster Jim Lehrer is 54. TV
personality David Hartman is 53. Author Nora Ephron is 47. Rock
singer-composer Peter Townshend is 43. Singer-actress-model Grace
Jones is 36. Singer Joey Ramone is 36. Baseball catcher Rick Cerone
is 34.
   Thought for Today: ``Being frustrated is disagreeable, but the
real disasters of life begin when you get what you want.'' --Irving
Kristol, American editor.

   Today is Saturday, May 19, the 139th day of 1990. There are 226
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On May 19, 1536, Anne Boleyn, the second wife of England's King
Henry VIII, was beheaded after she was convicted of adultery. (Anne
had fallen from Henry's favor because their marriage did not result
in any male heirs; however, she did give birth to a daughter, who
later became Queen Elizabeth I.)
   On this date:
   In 1780, a mysterious darkness enveloped much of New England and
part of Canada in the early afternoon. The cause has never been
determined.
   In 1906, the Federated Boys' Clubs, forerunner of the Boys'
Clubs of America, were organized.
   In 1921, Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act, which
established national quotas for immigrants entering the U.S.
   In 1926, inventor Thomas Edison was called upon to speak on
radio during the dinner of the National Electric Light Association
in Atlantic City, N.J. (Faced with the microphone, Edison said:
``Why, I don't know what to say. This is the first time I ever
spoke into one of these things. Good night.'')
   In 1935, T.E. Lawrence, better known as ``Lawrence of Arabia,''
died in England following a motorcycle crash.
   In 1943, in an address to the U.S. Congress, British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill pledged his country's full support in
the war against Japan.
   In 1958, the United States and Canada formally established the
North American Air Defense Command.
   In 1964, the State Department disclosed that 40 hidden
microphones had been found in the U.S. embassy in Moscow.
   In 1967, the Soviet Union ratified a treaty with the United
States and Britain banning nuclear weapons from outer space.
   Ten years ago: Angry homeowners at Love Canal in Niagara Falls,
   N.Y., detained two Environmental Protection Agency officials for
nearly five hours, demanding the federal government evacuate the
neighborhood because of toxic chemical contamination.
   Five years ago: Residents of the Philadelphia neighborhood
ravaged by fire in a police confrontation with the radical group
``MOVE'' gathered for Sunday services to seek solace.
   One year ago: The NCAA announced sanctions against the
University of Kentucky's basketball program for recruiting and
academic violations. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average passed the 2,500 mark, ending the day at 2,501.10.
   Today's Birthdays: PBS newscaster Jim Lehrer is 56. TV
   personality David Hartman is 55. Author Nora Ephron is 49. Rock
singer-composer Peter Townshend is 45. Singer-actress-model Grace
Jones is 38. Singer Joey Ramone is 38. Baseball catcher Rick Cerone

   Thought for Today: ``If every nation gets the government it
   deserves, every generation writes the history which corresponds
with its view of the world.'' -- Elizabeth Janeway, American author.

RESIDENTS SEEK LIQUOR LICENSE DENIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORI GRANGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents and an elementary school principal Tuesday urged a state judge to 
deny a liquor license to a businessman who wants to move his liquor store 
slightly closer to their south Glendale neighborhood, saying they fear litter 
and traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
In a hearing before Administrative Law Judge Paul Hogan in Los Angeles, 
residents of the 400 block of West Colorado Street and the principal of Thomas 
Edison Elementary School protested a request by Sang Jong Cheun, owner of 
Colorado Liquor at 412 1/2 W. Colorado St., to have his liquor license renewed 
at a new location -- 470 W. Colorado St., about 475 feet to the west. 
</P>
<P>
Cheun wants to move his business because his current lease is not being 
renewed, a business associate testified Tuesday. Protesters said they hope that 
denial of a liquor license will move the liquor store out of the neighborhood 
entirely. 
</P>
<P>
They said that despite the short distance involved, Cheun's move would add 
another liquor store to a half-block cluster that already has two convenience 
stores, a market, a drugstore and a restaurant that sell beer and wine. 
</P>
<P>
Those businesses, as well as Cheun's store and others farther east on Colorado, 
have contributed litter and traffic to the already congested neighborhood, said 
Dorothy Myers, who lives across the street from Cheun's proposed location. 
</P>
<P>
"We have enough trouble in the area already," said Myers, who submitted to the 
state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control a petition signed by 35 
residents opposing the move. 
</P>
<P>
The move also may encourage people to drink in nearby Pacific Park and threaten 
or give liquor to children who attend Edison, located about two blocks away on 
Lomita Avenue, said Myers and Edison Principal Mary Arevalo. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Cheun nor his attorney could be reached for comment. But an ABC 
investigator testified Tuesday that Glendale police had no objections to the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
The ABC, which grants liquor licenses, in January denied Cheun's request 
because of the potential effect on residents, Edison Elementary and Pacific 
Park, said Mary Ann Presswood, an ABC attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan is expected to make a decision within 30 days but can only issue a 
recommendation, which means that even if he rules in favor of Cheun, the 
department can stand by its denial, Presswood said. If the department's final 
decision is unfavorable to Cheun, he can appeal to the department's appeals 
board or take the issue to court, the attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
Myesook Cheun, Sang Jong Cheun's sister and a business associate, told Hogan 
that trash collection at the store's new location would be diligent and that 
the store would strictly enforce the age limit for purchasing liquor. 
</P>
<P>
But Arevalo told the judge that children walking to school would be endangered 
by the extra traffic and older students might be enticed to drink by the 
presence of an additional liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Reese, assistant director of Glendale's Parks and Recreation Department, 
testified against the request, saying the new location might increase litter 
and the number of people drinking in Pacific Park.

   Inventor Thomas Edison and 11 presidents
were among the 65 people honored this year by the University of Hard
Knocks, which issues diplomas to successful people who never earned
a college degree.
   The mock university _ founded 40 years ago by Jim Comstock,
editor of The West Virginia Hillbilly newspaper _ for the first time
issued posthumous degrees.
   Edison, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln were the top
honorees, said Wayne Fugate, a reporter for the Hillbilly and a
former graduate of the University of Hard Knocks.
   Those among the living who were honored came from as far away as
Jakarta to participate in Saturday's ceremony, Fugate said.
   Former Sen. Jennings Randolph, D-W.Va. _ the university's
``mascot'' and a former graduate _ presented diplomas to 45
honorees, including Arnaud de Borchgrave, editor-in-chief of The
Washington Times.
   The commencement was held at Alderson-Broaddus College, but as
Comstock _ a Marshall University graduate _ likes to say of his
college of hard-earned knowledge, ``The world is its campus.''

   Frank Nicholls says there's
something lacking in a pint of beer served in British Columbia bars
_ 4 ounces of beer.
   Nicholls, an electrician, says he's done his homework, sampling
pints in dozens of pubs in the province, and has concluded that most
of them don't give patrons a proper-sized Canadian pint.
   ``I could sue every pub in Vancouver _ right now,'' says
Nicholls, 38.
   Nicholls says most city pubs and clubs sell 16-ounce pints based
on the 128-ounce U.S. gallon. However, the federal Weights and
Measures Act uses the British Imperial gallon, which is 160 ounces.
Under federal law, it is illegal to call anything under 20 ounces a
pint.
   A government official agrees with Nicholls that calling a
16-ounce glass a pint is technically illegal.
   ``That's absolutely right,'' says Archie Patterson, Vancouver
district manager for Weights and Measures. ``The U.S. pint is not
legal.''
   But though most watering holes in the province could be charged
under federal law, Patterson says Ottawa has more important things
to worry about.
   ``We've not really been pushing in that area,'' he said.

DISTRICT PREPARES FOR YEAR-ROUND CLASSES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With final plans for the Anaheim City School District's new year-around 
schedule just about in place, administrators and educators are taking steps to 
make sure that the students will keep up their end of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
Parent-teacher meetings have come and gone, letters in English and Spanish have 
been mailed to every parent affected, and huge banners are draped in the 
entrance to a number of schools in the district. 
</P>
<P>
But the final test of the plan's success won't come until July 3, when the 
first classes begin. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Schuck, who has coordinated the program for the 21-campus district, 
said that she is worried but that once the year-round schedule begins, the 
system should run itself. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a major change, and that's difficult," Schuck said. "It's not only a 
school district changing, but it's a community changing." 
</P>
<P>
Schuck cited the growing need for child care as the main concern facing the 
parents and the community. 
</P>
<P>
Six of the district's schools will begin yearlong schedules this summer -- 
Thomas Edison, Benjamin Franklin, Melbourne A. Gauer, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham 
Lincoln and Palm Lane. Three more are scheduled to begin sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
The six schools were chosen primarily because they are the most impacted. The 
new "12 weeks on, four weeks off" schedule will allow the district to enroll up 
to 33% more students. 
</P>
<P>
Schuck added that those six schools also have the highest number of 
limited-English-speaking students, and the continuous schedule will help those 
students retain what they are learning. 
</P>
<P>
Parents and teachers are a little shaken by the upcoming change, which leaves 
only one week between the end of this school year and the beginning of next, 
but they tend to agree that it will be a move for the better. 
</P>
<P>
"It might pose a small problem this first year, but once they're in the groove, 
I don't think it'll be a problem," said Jackie Lampher, president of the 
Anaheim Elementary Education Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Lampher said that the teachers are generally prepared for the change and that, 
like the students, they could have chosen a new school if they were 
uncomfortable with the new schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Garcia, treasurer of the Parent Teachers Assn. at Thomas Jefferson 
School, said that because the school consists of primarily Latino students, the 
PTA held extra meetings for the Spanish-speaking parents. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just kind of like a shock at first, but we've gotten used to it," 
Garcia said. LISA MASCARO

JAMES FLANIGAN: HEAT IS ON IN WORLD MARKET FOR LIGHT BULBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You hear it everywhere these days, talk of the "global economy." It's the 
latest buzzword of business, and even Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev 
referred to a "single" world economy in his speech to the United Nations last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
That sounds good, but what does it mean? Is the "global market" anything more 
than hype? Does it benefit anybody? 
</P>
<P>
The answer is as near at hand as your light bulb -- the everyday product of an 
industry suddenly stirring with competition. 
</P>
<P>
General Electric, the leading U.S. producer of light bulbs, has just formed a 
joint venture with Toshiba of Japan that will increase GE's business in the Far 
East. Philips Industries of the Netherlands is intensifying its assault on the 
U.S. lighting market. The Sylvania division of GTE is battling for market share 
as light bulbs flood in from West Germany, South Korea, Taiwan, Hungary and 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Everybody, it seems, is reaching out for a piece of a world market that totals 
$8.5 billion in lighting sales. And the best part is that their competitive 
battles work for you. 
</P>
<P>
Competition is bringing light bulb prices down and new products to market in an 
increasing stream. 
</P>
<P>
GE is pooling research efforts with Toshiba, Japan's light bulb leader, and the 
two are building a $25-million plant near Cleveland to make fluorescent lights 
-- half of which will be exported to Japan. GE also has an energy-saving light 
bulb so impressive that Southern California Edison is recommending and 
distributing it to customers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Philips -- which leads in Europe and sells in Japan through a joint 
venture -- is pushing light bulbs here with a $12-million ad campaign, 
incentives for supermarket operators, and a special-offer bulb that lasts 
one-third longer than standard light bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
Sylvania is responding with advanced technology long-life bulbs, and 
fluorescent lights that screw into lamps as incandescent bulbs do -- providing 
an easier-to-use product for business customers. (Residential customers 
generally prefer softer, incandescent light.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Such a Wonderful Business' 
</P>
<P>
So, clearly, global competition is the mother of invention. But the business 
wasn't always so competitive. Legend has it that GE and Philips long ago had an 
informal agreement to split the world, Philips selling in Europe and GE selling 
here. But legends aside, the reality was that distance and war kept markets 
separate until five years ago when Philips bought Westinghouse's lighting 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"It's such a wonderful business," a GE vice president mused at the time, "I 
don't see how Westinghouse could have let it go." The Dutch giant has since 
built U.S. lighting sales to roughly $500 million -- which trails GE's roughly 
$1.5 billion U.S. sales. 
</P>
<P>
Light bulbs are a highly profitable business -- with automated, volume 
production. "GE's operating profit margins are over 20%," estimates analyst 
Albert Turner of Chicago's Duff &amp; Phelps research firm. That means that the 
humble light bulb, invented 110 years ago by Thomas Edison, is as profitable as 
the newest gee-whiz computer. 
</P>
<P>
But the technology didn't stop with Edison, and that's the key to lighting's 
potential today. Look no further than the fluorescent lights that glow in 
offices, but not in American homes. Homes in Europe and Japan use more 
fluorescent lighting than American houses do because it's a big energy saver. 
</P>
<P>
A fluorescent bulb lasts 20,000 hours, compared to 1,000 for an incandescent 
bulb, and provides three times the light for the same amount of power. The only 
problem is that fluorescent light is harsh to the eye and makes people look 
funny. But bulb makers are working on the problem, and Americans will see new 
types of light on to market. 
</P>
<P>
And there is opportunity elsewhere as others begin to light up their lives as 
Americans have. (U.S. light usage, 37% of the world's total, is greater than 
all of Europe or Asia.) For most of this century, the business has grown 
through the introduction of artificial light -- a thought put poetically by an 
old man in Ireland's remote Aran Islands who, when asked the most important 
change he had seen in fourscore years, replied: "Oh, the coming of the sudden 
light." 
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, the global market will spread that light.

7-YEAR-OLD TWISTS WAY TO AWARD

<P>
Hair is important, even to a 7-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Stefani Green created "Stefani's Curler Kit for Kids," an invention 
that earned the Rossmoor Elementary School pupil top statewide honors in the 
"1990 Invent America" competition. 
</P>
<P>
Stefani, who enters the second grade this fall, was selected as first-grade 
winner, beating out about 100,000 California entries. She received a $200 U.S. 
savings bond for her efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"She was the best first-grade entry that we got from the entire state," said 
Diane George, spokeswoman for Invent America, a national program launched in 
1987 by then-Vice President George Bush, who now serves as honorary chairman. 
"When you consider the 26,000 entries we got from the greater Los Angeles area 
alone, her achievement is all the more remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
The Invent America program is more than just a chance to compete and have fun. 
It is designed to get children to think creatively at an early age, George 
said. 
</P>
<P>
When Stefani's science teacher, Claudia Ross, announced last spring that the 
school would be holding an "invention convention" instead of the annual science 
fair, the blond-haired, brown-eyed youngster's mind began to race. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about what I could invent, then I thought about how I like to 
curl my bangs but always burn my forehead," Stefani said. "That's when I got my 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
Stefani's invention is a fan-shaped device made of heat-resistant plastic that 
is fastened to the curling iron. The device prevents the hot parts of the 
curling iron from touching the forehead or neck -- two areas Stefani said are 
particularly at risk when curling hair. 
</P>
<P>
Like other entrants in the contest, Stefani built a model of the device from 
cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
Although her first journey into the territory of Thomas Edison and Alexander 
Graham Bell was a success, Stefani said she doesn't plan on doing much 
inventing in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"It was sort of aggravating and took a lot of concentration," she said. "It's 
exciting I guess, but what I really want to be is a dolphin trainer." GREG

<HEAD>Teen-Age Inventor Seeks His Fortune Through Uncommon Windshield
Wiper</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH SHOGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While many other 18-year-olds are thinking about
college courses, Alonzo J. Haney III is thinking about windshield
wipers and the idea of becoming a millionaire.
   Haney invented a windshield wiper that already has caught the
eye of General Motors Corp. He also has his own company, HMI Inc.,
which he says is backed by more than $1 million in investments.
   Not bad for a teen-ager who earned ``C's'' in high school
science.
   Haney, who goes by the nickname Chip, puts himself in some
respectable company _ with inventors like Thomas Edison.
   ``They're inspirational, they defy odds and I guess that's what
I am doing right now,'' he said in an interview Thursday at his
company's spacious Chicago office.
   ``When I look out this window, I think a lot about what space of
the sky I want to go after next,'' said the youth, who lives in the
suburb of North Chicago.
   His path to fortune began simply. He was driving his car to pick
up his mother from work one rainy day in October 1986 when he
noticed the windshield wipers didn't work well.
   ``I took out a pad of paper and a pen and I started to sketch
out new ideas of a better wiper blade,'' Haney recalled.
   That night, the made the first prototype out of a garden hose at
home.
   Haney says his wiper can scoop rain, ice and snow off a
windshield and toss the debris as far as four feet. It is specially
designed to hug the windshield more closely than traditional
wipers, he said.
   When he found out he would have to pay about $10,000 to hire an
attorney to file a patent application, Haney decided to do the
research and application himself.
   His patent was approved, and Haney marched into GM's executive
offices in Detroit the day after he graduated from high school last
year to persuade the giant automaker to use his wiper on GM cars.
Company officials have promised to test it.
   Haney is putting the final touches on a contract with Alofs
Manufacturing Co. of Grand Rapids, Mich., which will make and
distribute his invention.
   ``We're hoping to have it (the contract) complete and signed
next week,'' said Alofs owner Eugene DeFouw.
   DeFouw said Haney's earnings would be based on the number of
wipers sold. In addition to GM, he said, a few Japanese automakers
have expressed interest. Meanwhile, he has invented 28 other
products, five of which have patents pending, he said.
   ``I spend about 18 hours a day thinking about what I want to
make,'' Haney said. ``I don't date, I don't have time for that
right now.''
   In his office hang two paintings, which Haney said tell a lot
about what motivates him.
   One depicts a young black man, shirtless and hunched over,
struggling to be taken seriously.
   ``Now I can be accepted as an equal, but 40 years ago, you
wouldn't have found me in this office,'' said Haney, who is black.
   Another painting is of a man playing polo.
   ``I love polo because it's very challenging and not everyone can
do it _ just like not everyone can be 18 and own a company,'' Haney
said.
   Joseph N. Stephenitch, who taught Haney in business classes at
Warren Township High School in suburban Gurnee, said the youth
``has a scary grasp of business.''
   Haney's mother Patricia, 43, also is proud of her son.
   ``But it does worry me that he's not with his own age group,''

   DNX, a small Princeton, N.J., biotechnology company, said Ohio University is receiving a patent on a technique for inserting new genes into animals, to which DNX will have exclusive rights. 

   The patent covers the so-called microinjection process whereby bits of genetic material are injected by microscopic instruments into a single-cell animal embryo shortly after fertilization. 
The injected genes are incorporated into the developing animal to create a "transgenic" animal, one which bears genes of other species. 
The inserted genes are then passed on to succeeding generations. 

   Most transgenic animals produced so far are mice bearing "foreign" genes, created mainly for research purposes. 
However, attempts are being made to introduce new genes into livestock to give the animals better growth or disease-resistance traits. 
Attempts also are being made to insert human genes that produce medically valuable proteins into mice, sheep, goats or cows. 
The human proteins could then be extracted from the animals' milk in commercial quantities. 

   The microinjection method was used to produce the first patented transgenic animal, the "Harvard Mouse," a laboratory mouse bearing foreign cancer genes. 

   DNX said the new patent, which was applied for a decade ago, will be issued this week to Ohio University naming Thomas Wagner of the university's Edison Animal Biotechnology Center in Athens, Ohio, and Peter C. Hoppe of the nonprofit Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, as co-inventors. 

   DNX was formed in March 1988, by the merger of Transgenics Corp., of Princeton, and Embryogen Inc., of Athens. 
Embryogen was formed under a state of Ohio program to commercialize the university's biotechnology research. 
DNX gained Embryogen's exclusive rights to inventions from the Edison center. 
DNX is financed by a number of venture capital firms and counts the Ohio University Foundation among its stockholders.

   Napoleon Bonaparte and Thomas Edison were ``short'' sleepers.
   Albert Einstein was a ``long'' sleeper.
   Not everyone needs the same amount of sleep, says a University
of Rochester sleep disorders specialist _ and not everyone needs
eight hours of sleep a night.
   Yet, says Dr. Donald Greenblatt, ``the great majority of adults
sleep between seven and nine hours, and there is evidence that
people who fall within this range live longer than those who sleep
fewer, or more, hours.''
   Napoleon and Edison, Greenblatt says, needed only four to six
hours of sleep; Einstein often slept 14 to 16 hours.
   The sleepiest creatures on Earth, says the sleep doctor, are
sloths, bats and armadillos, which doze as much as 20 hours of the
day. Horses function well on five hours, and giraffes and elephants
sleep only four hours, he says.
   His advice for the most restful sleep:
   _ Keep a regular schedule, getting up and retiring at about the
same time each day.
   _ Exercise in the late afternoon; exercising too close to
bedtime may keep you awake.
   _ Sleep in a cool, quiet room.
   _ Don't take sedatives or alcohol before bed. Though they may
cause you to fall asleep sooner in the short run, they can cause
``rebound'' insomnia when their effect wears off.
   _ Sleep only until refreshed.

killed when a coal waste landslide engulfed a school and several
houses in south Wales.
   In 1967, thousands of demonstrators opposed to the Vietnam War
tried to storm the Pentagon after a peaceful rally in Washington by
some 50,000 protesters.
   In 1971, President Nixon nominated Lewis F. Powell and William
H. Rehnquist to the Supreme Court, following the resignations of
Justices Hugo L. Black and John M. Harlan.

<TEXT>     Press leaks about the "Edison Project" portray it as a joint venture
between Tennessee media baron Christopher Whittle and American industry to
create a "new American school" -- one that relies heavily on video and
computer technology for about the same cost of a traditional public school.
Whittle will formally unveil his plan today at a Washington, D.C., news
conference.;    Some educators speculate the only way Whittle can turn a
profit is by using the same tool that makes Channel One tick -- television --
to replace the costliest cog in education's machinery: the classroom teacher.;
   "The only way that he can make it is if he uses a lot of technology and
fewer teachers," said Stanford education professor Michael Kirst. "You'd have
distance-learning, where their teacher isn't even there.;    "He's off in
Nebraska somewhere, but teaching you via television.";    Not that Kirst
rejects the idea: "What's interesting to me is that no entrepreneur has ever
come into the education field and tried to used to massive amounts of
technology and machines.";     Critic answers;  But the idea of plug-in
teachers doesn't turn on Del Weber, president-elect of the California Teachers
Association.;    "All of the research indicates the most effective instruction
takes place with a smaller class size and human beings -- namely teachers --
who can give the youngster individual attention," he said. "Nothing takes the
place of another human being.";    Whittle hinted at his vision in a 1990
issue of his now-defunct Tennessee Illustrated magazine:;    "When Edison
invented electric illumination, he didn't tinker with candles to make them
burn better. Instead, he created something brilliantly new: the light bulb. In
the same fashion, American education needs a fundamental breakthrough, a new
dynamic that will light the way to a transformed educational system.";     $60
million in seed money;    According to press reports, Whittle plans to start
his breakthrough by investing $60 million over the next two years to hire 100
"innovators" from education, business, science and other fields to come up
with the school of the future. Then he'll spend about $2.5 billion to build
the first 200 schools.;    The money would come from all over: corporate
partners; by selling course materials to other schools; from peddling space in
textbooks to advertisers. There is also speculation that advertising space
would be sold in school hallways and -- just like Channel One -- during video
programs shown to students.;     Apple is hesitant;    The most logical
corporate sponsors would be electronics giants like IBM or Apple. But an Apple
spokeswoman questioned whether her firm would join an enterprise that could
threaten its existing inroads in public education.;    "Apple's approach has
always been to work in partnership with educators," said a spokeswoman who
asked for anonymity. "Over the years, we've been very supportive of
educational research and technology.;    "If Whittle decided they were going
to take on educational reform on their own, I'd have to say we'd hesitate to
be a part of that.";    Whittle compares his brainchild to the intensive
effort of the Manhattan Project that built the atomic bomb, or space
pioneering of the Mercury astronauts.;    But critical educators suspect a
more earthly motive: making a buck.;    Their fears focus on Whittle's
controversial Channel One, the TV news show that was launched in 1989 and now
reaches 8,700 schools in 47 states. Channel One provides schools with an
average of $50,000 in free video equipment, which can be used for anything the
school chooses. The only stipulation is that the school show Whittle's
10-minute new program in its entirety, including the two minutes of
commercials at the end for products such as Burger King and Nike.;    But
critics say that the show -- which has been banned by California schools chief
William Honig under threat of having a school's funds withheld for lost
instructional time -- turns students into "a captive market" for advertisers.
And they worry that Whittle's schools will do the same.;    "From what I've
heard about the 'Whittle Academies' is that they're going to be a brilliantly
conceived marketing vehicle," said William L. Rukeyser, special assistant to
Honig.;    "This is taxpayer subsidy to watch M&amp;M ads.";    But Whittle has
supporters at East San Jose's Overfelt High School, which has continued to run
Channel One -- risking the loss of $30,000 to $50,000 in state funding.;   
"Schools have to be aggressive in getting business involved in our schools,"
said Art Darin, associate principal of Overfelt. "We cannot continue without
business partnerships. There must be a dramatic change in the way our
educational system operates.";    Whittle's plan is being announced amid
growing dissatisfaction with the U.S. educational system. President Bush
recently called for intensified efforts to improve the nation's schools --
including letting parents choose where their children, and their tax dollars,
go to school -- and newly appointed Secretary of Education Lamar Alexander is
a longtime adviser to Whittle and an investor in the company.;    But
educators are concerned that such private school enterprise would "skim" the
best students, making the public schools a dumping ground for children with
academic, social and developmental difficulties.; WHITTLE'S PLAN FOR NEW
SCHOOLS; (box) Whittle wants to build 200 new schools for $2.5 billion using
no public money, though advertising would play a part in the venture.; (box)
He plans to spend $60 million over two years to hire innovators to design the
"school of the future."; (box) Some educators fear such private schools would

Did Western Union
Hang Up on Bell?</HL>
<DD> 01/30/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Your account of how Western Union supposedly scorned Bell's telephone as a toy (second section, Dec. 15) repeats a long-running myth. 

   In researching the telephone's centennial for a 1976 article, I learned there is no hard evidence of an offer of the Bell patents to Western Union for $100,000. 
The only mention of it appears nearly 40 years afterward in a recollection by Bell's assistant, Thomas Watson. 
His story has been kept alive through wide circulation of a purported "report" to Western Union's president in which a committee charged with evaluating the invention calls it "hardly more than a toy" and scorns the idea of putting phones in every home and office as "idiotic on the face of it." 

   This report has enough flaws to suggest it was very likely fabricated, either as a joke or as a confused reminiscence. 

   The reality was quite different. 
Western Union's President Orton was an electrical expert so familiar with Bell's experiments that he was shrewd enough to put Edison on his payroll in 1875. 
A few months later he gave him a copy of a German report of a primitive "telephone" made in 1860. 
Edison missed beating Bell to the invention of a working phone by only a few months. 
However, he did invent a better transmitter that made Bell's invention practical for commercial use. 

   Thus, while Bell's invention could be considered a "toy" from a commercial standpoint, Western Union seems undeserving of the ridicule it has received.

   Inventors whose developments have affected
nearly every American in one way or another, and led to major
changes in society, will be added to the National Inventors Hall of
Fame.
   Special ceremonies have been scheduled for March 27 to honor the
developers of oral contraceptives, computer memory, television
receivers and elevators, the U.S. Patent Office announced Friday.
   The four new members will be inducted in ceremonies at the
Patent Office in Arlington, Va. They bring to 72 the membership in
the Hall of Fame, which was opened in 1973 with a plaque honoring
Thomas A. Edison.
   New members of the Hall of Fame are:
   _Elisha Graves Otis of Halifax, Vt., who patented the elevator
in 1861.
   _Frank B. Colton, born in Poland, who received patents for oral
contraceptives in 1954 and 1955.
   _Louis W. Parker, born in Budapest, Hungary, who is credited
with developing the television receiver.
   _An Wang, a native of Shanghai, China, who developed the
magnetic pulse controlling device, the principle on which computer
memory operates.
   Graves becomes the latest inductee selected for development of
products that have become nearly universal.
   Others whose work is similarly well known include Edison for his
electric light, the Wright brothers for airplanes, Charles Goodyear
for vulcanized rubber and Rudolf Diesel for the internal combustion
engine.
   Colton joins Carl Djerassi, an Austrian-born chemist who was
inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1978 for his pioneering work on
oral contraceptives.
   Parker's television receiver glows in nearly every American home
today, and in the Hall of Fame he joins William D. Coolidge, who
invented the vacuum tube; Vladimir Zworykin, who developed the
cathode ray tube used for television pictures and Philo T.
Farnsworth, who developed the scanning, contrast and focusing
systems for television.
   In the development of computers, An Wang joins several other
pioneers already in the Hall of Fame. They include calculating
machine pioneer William Seward Burroughs; George R. Stibitz who
developed modern complex computer systems; Robert N. Noyce, a
pioneer in developing semiconductor devices; Jack S. Kilby who
developed miniaturized circuits and Jay W. Forrester, a leader in
early digital information storage.

   A government, trying to beat foreigners to market with a
new technology, encourages competing companies to collaborate
and subsidizes their development efforts.
   It's a tale often told in Tokyo. But the latest chapter
takes place a bit farther west -- in Ohio.

   The new setting delights Rick A. Wynveen. Founder and
president of Life Systems Inc., a small space and defense
contractor in Cleveland, Mr. Wynveen says an Ohio state
government program has put new life into Life Systems.
   For years, Life Systems has had trouble commercializing
some of its most promising technology. The 22-year-old
concern's growth and profit were constrained by its
dependence on erratic government work. But now, with a
government program helping it and its rivals develop a new
technology and markets, Life Systems hopes to soon become a
partner in a nerve-stimulation business that could multiply
its sales. "We never could have done this without {the
government program}," Mr. Wynveen says.
   Life Systems' benefactor, Ohio's state-run Thomas Edison
Program, is one of the oldest and most advanced of more than
700 state and local government-funded programs that surfaced
in the last decade to help small companies bring new
technologies to market. By sharing and eventually
transferring technology to member companies and providing
them with contacts, the programs encourage small companies to
pursue risky technologies that otherwise wouldn't be
developed -- or would be left to the Japanese to develop. "In
an ad hoc, grass-roots sense, this is our response" to
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry, says
Christopher Coburn, former head of the Ohio program and now
with the Battelle Memorial Institute.
   Of course, these small programs lack the central
coordination and funding that MITI provides Japanese
companies. They also have a mixed record of success. Ohio's
Edison program had to close one of its nine technology
centers, for applied information technology, when member
companies decided it wasn't worth their dues. In another
case, a growth hormone concern, Embryogen Inc., thanked the
Ohio program by leaving the state.
   Yet such programs have clearly helped small-business
owners such as Mr. Wynveen. The 58-year-old chemist worked as
a project manager for TRW Inc.'s life-support systems for
space and defense applications in the 1960s. But he says that
when the company told him in 1969 that it would gradually
dismantle the business, he decided to form a rival business.
That same year, Mr. Wynveen invested his personal savings of
$25,000 in the venture, took on two partners and opened a
two-room office in Beachwood, Ohio. For a research lab, he
used his partner's basement.
   Nine months later, Life Systems won a NASA contract to
devise a system to dechlorinate water aboard a space center.
Since then, revenue has grown to $12 million. Now, Life
Systems employs 100.
   But Life Systems found that working for the government was
no moon walk. Contracts would pile up all at once and then
disappear, causing big revenue swings for Life Systems and
forcing cutbacks. The government also limited profit margins
to 8%. By the late 1980s, with defense budget cuts looming,
Mr. Wynveen sought to tap the private sector.
   But Life Systems couldn't find commercial customers. Its
labs overflowed with new technologies -- devices that remove
chemical warfare agents from air and turn carbon dioxide to
oxygen and sewage to drinking water. But it never found
buyers for more than five units of any invention. "We knew
how to develop the technology," Mr. Wynveen says. "Our
problem was we didn't know if anybody would want it."
   Life Systems looked for a product with more commercial
appeal, and found it in "functional electronic stimulation."
Borrowing concepts first developed by researchers at
Cleveland's Case Western Reserve University, Mr. Wynveen's
company in 1988 began to design a system that would allow
paralyzed people to move their limbs using a control box
linked to surgically implanted electrodes.
   The market was potentially broad, but Life Systems
couldn't risk investing in 10 years of development if the
market didn't materialize or fell to the Japanese first.
   That's where the Edison BioTechnology Center came in. A
unit of Ohio's Edison program, the center seeks to form a
self-supporting biotechnology industry in northeastern Ohio.
The center in 1989 won a $5 million grant from the federal
Veterans Administration to develop the new technology along
with local hospitals, companies and academics; since then, it
has funneled technical and market support to Life Systems and
rivals as well.
   Using federal, state and county funds, the center is
turning local hospitals into teaching facilities to spread
the word about the new technology. It finds vendors to supply
Life Systems and its rivals and helps member companies sort
through red tape at government agencies. It conducts market
surveys for members, finds them academic advisers and
monitors government regulations. The center also built a
"technology library" to aid development.
   The efforts have been rewarded. While only three patients
have received the implanted devices, hospitals have committed
to 30 implants in the next few years.
   Life Systems also says the BioTechnology Center helped it
get a $2 million Veterans Administration grant July 22 that
calls for it to manufacture 200 devices over the next four
years. Now, Life Systems is seeking potential partners that
will join it in buying the commercial rights to the
technology from the center. Dorothy Baunach, president of the
BioTechnology Center, says Life Systems is the front runner
for the transfer, expected in six months.
   Even so, the technology has a long way to go. The industry
still must persuade enough doctors to use the unfamiliar
device, and it must stand up in the government's clinical
trials. Also, the market will shrivel quickly if the
government and insurance companies decide not to reimburse
patients for the procedure. Life Systems and its rivals must
also fend off Japanese and European producers, for whom
government nurturing is nothing new.
   But such fears are secondary to Life Systems and other
small businesses now competing in markets they wouldn't have
approached without government help. "Biotechnology is an area
where the United States is still in the lead," Mr. Wynveen
says. "This is a way to hold on."

<TEXT>     While Mr. Fender did not invent the electric guitar, he did revolutionize
and perfect it. Called both the Henry Ford and the Thomas Edison of the
instrument, Mr. Fender's solid-body guitars and amplifiers set the industry
standard for excellence.;    "Fender was a phenomenon," said Peter Schuelzky,
general manager of the Guitar Center in Hollywood. "He created the guitar (to)
which all other manufacturers try to conform. . . . Nobody has been quite as
successful.";    Electric guitars made Mr. Fender, a tinkerer and inventor by
nature, a millionaire.;    In 1954, he created the Stratocaster, a
revolutionary instrument hailed as a near-perfect fusion of electronics,
ergonomics and technology on one side, and design and aesthetics on the
other.;    "The Stratocaster is like the Rolls-Royce," said Dick Dale, 53,
known as "king of the surf guitar" for pioneering the surf rock sound in
Southern California in the late-1950s and early '60s. "It can never be

Beyond Tycoon-Thrashing

<DD> 03/31/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>

   Thomas DiBacco thinks American business has gotten a bad deal. 
Not necessarily from public opinion. 
Americans "have viewed business positively from the perspective of their times," he notes in his introduction. 
But rather from historians who either have ignored or attacked the business community, aided by "untoward events of recent times" such as the Great Depression, the creation of the military-industrial complex, and the character of American imperialism. 
As a result, "the good that business people have done over the years has been interred with their bones." 
With "Made in the U.S.A.: The History of American Business" (Harper &amp; Row, $19.95), Mr. DiBacco intends to set the record straight. 
In some 275 pages of text he undertakes, therefore, to provide an account from the landing of the Pilgrims to contemporary corporate philanthropy, a description emphasizing the central role of business in American life as a source of skills, ideals, values and goals. 

   The narrative itself is easy to read, divided into 20 chapters that mix conventional and unusual subjects with trendy titles. 
"Exciting Infrastructures" is the tag for antebellum transport and communication changes; "Rocky and Andy" describes not two rock stars, but John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie. 

   The chapters mingle brief biographical sketches, statistical summaries, selective quotation, and absorbing, occasionally amusing and sometimes provoking vignettes of business and technical genius at work. 
The cast of characters includes not only the traditional business pantheon -- Benjamin Franklin, Cyrus McCormack, George Pullman, Samuel Slater, Thomas Edison -- but a set of extraordinary innovators whose lives and personalities have not survived the passage of time: James Ritty, developer of the cash register, William Colgate of soap fame, Oscar Hammerstein, the impresario whose career as an opera magnate was built on the invention of a cigar-making machine, James B. Duke, the tobacco millionaire, Charles Strite of the pop-up toaster, and James C. Penney, founder of the store chain. 
Their stories, and the histories of a broad range of tools, appliances, conveniences, packages and fundamental inventions, are indeed frequently ignored in conventionally organized summaries of American life. 
Mr. DiBacco demonstrates their significance, and reveals the critical role of merchandisers in changing (and frequently improving) the quality of life enjoyed by a majority of the population. 

   But despite its effective syntheses and anecdotal appeal, "Made in the U.S.A." is not a persuasive book. 
It is not persuasive, first of all, because it ignores the work of a group of historians that has, in fact, studied American business and technology, and helped popularize their contributions: Daniel Boorstin, Alfred Chandler, Robert Bruce, Erik Barnouw, Brooke Hindle, Merritt Roe Smith, among them, none of whom is mentioned in the rather brief bibliography. (The book also ignores the work of a series of somewhat more critical historians, who have moved well beyond tycoon-thrashing in their writings.) 

   "Made in the U.S.A." is also not persuasive because of its errors and rather selective explanations. 
The 1896 election victory of William McKinley over his "mountebank" opponent William Jennings Bryan was not "razor thin," but rather the largest margin in 20 years, a landslide in contemporary terms. 
The treatment of American Puritanism and the exploration of its theological principles is oversimplified, even in a popular text. 

   "Made in the U.S.A." is not persuasive because of its omissions. 
Frick and Carnegie are described, but Homestead is buried in a single quotation; Rockefeller's philanthropies receive a well-deserved commentary, but not the Ludlow Massacre, an instance of labor violence; we get Herbert Croly, an apologist for bigness, but not its critic, Louis D. Brandeis. 
Also conspicuously absent are tycoons such as Jay Gould, Jim Fisk, Daniel Drew and Charles T. Yerkes, who did not count political honesty among their chief virtues. 
It seems unfair to attack the old muckraking historians of Matthew Josephson's day without even mentioning one of their principal targets: the corruption of politics by business interests. 

   If the history of commerce, invention and business culture has been badly served, it is not necessarily because academic historians have been hostile to the bosses. 
Such complaints have been perennial also among students of American invention, entertainment and recreation, journalism, design, advertising, sport, health and medicine. 
It is difficult to integrate such special areas into the larger history of the U.S. Within the last couple of decades, however, a series of pioneering works, armed with new conceptions and orientations, has demonstrated exciting possibilities. 
Recent studies of "consumer culture," for example, have transformed the passive victim of manipulative advertising into a more active and aggressive partner whose exercise of choice reflects value structures more powerful and more pervasive than those purveyed by manufacturers or merchants. 
Treated as a quick tour through some byways of our national history, "Made in the U.S.A." is an adequate and even entertaining guide, but as a serious effort to reformulate the history of American business culture it doesn't, as Mr. Heinz might say, "cut the mustard."

<LEADPARA>  Edwin H. Land, whose invention of the instant camera changed the

<HEADLINE>  POLAROID'S EDWIN LAND DIES AT AGE 81  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  The Associated Press contributed to this report.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     For decades, as head of Polaroid Corp., Land provided the ideas and impetus
for a long line of innovative photographic products.;    It was in response to
his 3-year-old daughter's bewilderment at why a camera could not instantly
produce pictures that Land conceived the idea of the instant camera in 1943.; 
  A mostly self-taught physicist, Land said he thought about her question, and
"within an hour, the camera, the film and the physical chemistry became so
clear to me.";    As Polaroid's longtime guiding light, he oversaw the
development of products that included the first Polaroid Land Camera of 1948
and a long succession of other devices in the field that he termed instant
photography.;    "Land inspired everyone he worked with," Polaroid President
I. MacAllister Booth said. "He taught us new science, new industry and a new
way of working.";    Under Land, Polaroid's products gained wide acceptance.
In the 1960s, a Polaroid marketing executive estimated that half the
households in the United States had Polaroid cameras.;    That pioneering by
Land, who held 533 patents by the time he retired in 1982, reflected what he
said was a basic trait in himself and other inventor-scientists.;    An urge
to contribute;  "As I review the nature of the creative drive in the inventive
scientists that have been around me, as well as in myself," he wrote, "I find
the first event is an urge to make a significant intellectual contribution
that can be tangibly embodied in a product or process.";    Over the decades,
Land lavished energy and creativity on the art of running a technologically
innovative company. He spurred inventiveness among his colleagues at Polaroid,
and he repeatedly led efforts to overcome urgent technical problems that
arose.;    Under his guidance, Polaroid, which has been based in Cambridge
since 1940, flourished after it began selling its instant-photography
products.;    The company ran into notable problems in the 1970s, including
some involving the technically elegant SX-70, an instant camera with complex
optics.;    In good times and bad, Land's life was tightly intertwined with
the life of the company and of a predecessor, Land-Wheelwright Laboratories,
which he co-founded in 1932. Besides being Polaroid's chairman, Land was its
president from 1937 to 1975. He stepped down as chairman in 1982.;    As a
freshman at Harvard in 1926, he launched his first experiments on ways to
polarize light -- a process that filters out diffuse light waves that cause
glare. Land soon left Harvard to pursue his research independently and start
Land-Wheelwright in Cambridge.;    Land's research launched two major
industries: instant photography and the use of plastic sheets for polarizing
light in items like sunglasses and digital readouts.;    His instant-picture
process entailed exposing the film and then developing the negative at the
same time that the print was made: Rollers squeezed the exposed film up
against the paper that would become the print.;    Instant development;  As
the rollers moved the negative and the paper along, they also broke open a
small sealed pod attached to the paper. The pod held developing chemicals that
the rollers spread between the negative and the paper.;    At first the system
yielded sepia images; in 1950 it was altered so that the pictures came out in
black and white. In 1959, a long-held ambition of Land's was fulfilled: He
announced that an instant color-photograph system had been devised at
Polaroid.; LANDMARKS; Edwin H. Land collected more than 500 patents in his
lifetime, second only to Thomas Edison. Among them:; (box)The first instant
camera, the Polaroid Land camera, in 1948, starting the era of 60-second
photography.; (box)Polaroid sunglasses.; (box)Polarized glass for windows.;

   We would create thousands more good inner city jobs tomorrow, if
the Democratic Congress would stop blocking Jack Kemp's enterprise
zones program.
   We discovered something in New Jersey _ every time we take an
unemployed person and give them a job, we take a Democrat and turn
him into a Republican!
   But good jobs will not matter if our children do not have the
skills to fill them.
   As a child, I had a terrible stutter. I also had dyslexia. I
overcame those problems, but I couldn't have done it alone. I went
to a good school. I had good teachers.
   Today, a lot of children across America struggle with problems.
With a little help from a good school or a great teacher, today's
stuttering child could be tomorrow's keynote speaker _ today's
potential dropout could become tomorrow's Thomas Edison.
   That's why Republican governors are leading a revolution in
American education. Orr in Indiana. Branstad in Iowa. Hunt in
Alabama. Martinez in Florida.
   The Democrats' response is always the same _ spend more money.
But Republican governors understand that money won't make a
difference unless we change other things as well.
   No more automatic passing of students from grade to grade. If
you can't write or read or count, you don't deserve a high school
diploma. Mediocrity can never be tolerated in teaching.
   From now on, hard work and creativity must be rewarded every
single day.
   When schools fail year after year, let's admit it is the fault
of adults, not children. Stop blaming the children. Fix the schools.
   And children cannot be educated if their minds are clouded by
drugs. Kingpins who make millions by selling drugs to children are
merchants of death.

   Here are some highlights of Kodak's 100
years in the movie industry:
   1889 _ George Eastman invents flexible roll film. It's 200 feet
long and today would be long enough to make a movie just over two
minutes long. Thomas Edison is his first customer.
   1899 _ Long rolls of film _ 1,000 feet _ are introduced. Long,
dramatic films become practical.
   1929 _ First film is made especially for sound motion pictures.
   1931 _ Kodak wins its first Oscar. The company will receive four
more for technical achievements.
   1946 _ First color print film is introduced. This is the
forerunner of the movies seen in theaters today.
   1948 _ Kodak introduces triacetate safety-base film to replace
nitrate-based film which was flammable, potentially explosive and,
when stored improperly, deteriorated into a powder.
   1974 _ Eastman Color Negative II film 5247, the company's most
versatile movie film, is introduced. It remains the most popular
negative movie film sold in the world.
   1982 _ Kodak introduces a negative film that allows
cinematographers to use less light when filming. The new film cuts
production costs.
   1989 _ Kodak introduces a film said to perform even better in
low-light situations and produce sharper images.

   Paul McCartney, Dick Clark, Miles Davis and
the late Vladimir Horowitz and Nat King Cole will receive lifetime
achievement awards at this year's Grammy Awards ceremonies.
   McCartney, Clark and Davis have agreed to appear Feb. 21 at the
Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles for the Grammy telecast, said
Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording
Artists.
   McCartney's impact on music as a songwriter and member of the
Beatles, as well as his continuing growth as a solo performer were
cited as reasons for his award.
   Davis played a crucial role in the development of jazz since the
1940s, the academy said.
   Horowitz was included because many consider him the 20th
century's greatest classical pianist, and Cole was cited as a
leading singer of the 1940s and 1950s.
   The inclusion of Clark was a surprise because he produces the
American Music Awards, which competes with the Grammys. The shows
are a month apart and many artists will appear on only one show,
fearing overexposure.
   ``We don't view these shows as competitive and when you look at
the big contribution Clark has made to the recording industry,
especially in exposing new talent, there is no question he is
deserving,'' Greene said.
   Clark will receive the Trustees Award because he is a
non-performing contributor to music. Past recipients include
inventors Thomas Edison and Robert Moog.

      After Years in Eclipse,
   Here Comes the Sun
   THE OLDEST lighting source on Earth is making a comeback. 

   Architects began losing interest in sunlight shortly after Thomas Edison built the first practical incandescent lamp, in 1879. 
Electric lighting is indeed convenient, and it never sets or goes behind a cloud. 
But with the price of electricity climbing, more architects are installing systems that carry sunlight deep into a building's core. 
And there's a bonus that some architects say is more important than money: Natural light makes people feel better and work better. 

   But it's cost that usually attracts a builder's attention. 
At Broadmoor, a daylit Audubon Society nature center in Natick, Mass., designed by the Boston architect Gerard Ives, the lighting bill is one-sixth those at other society centers. 

   Because of the savings, utilities are beginning to offer incentives for customers to use daylighting. 
Southern California Edison, in Rosemead, has given grants for more than 300 buildings in the past three years. 
According to Gregg D. Ander, an architect and project manager at Edison, any building with a heavy lighting load can benefit. 
"We've done offices, retail stores, schools, industrial buildings -- you name it," he says. 

   There's more to daylighting than just adding windows, skylights and clerestories. 
Mr. Ives says the biggest challenges are to prevent glare and overheating. 
Another problem, says Harvey Bryan, an associate professor of architecture at Harvard University, is to coordinate electric and natural light. 

   Daylighting also brings changes that not everyone welcomes. 
Illumination in a daylit building varies with time, season and weather. 
"Building managers often like systems they don't have to touch," says Mr. Bryan. 
"With daylighting, you have to adjust the blinds or maybe pull down a shade once in a while." 

   Telltale Ring Signals
   That Special Call
   UNWELCOME telephone calls -- for example, from salesmen who seem to sense the exact moment you sit down to dinner -- have been a resilient problem, but help may be on the way. 

   A few years ago, call-screening devices seemed to offer a solution. 
The machines typically intercepted calls and asked the caller to tap in a code provided by the customer before they rang the customer's phone. 
But the idea didn't catch on, possibly because the price was high and passing out the codes a nuisance. 

   Now another approach is being tried, this time by the telephone companies themselves. 
Operating companies in Florida, Mississippi and New Jersey are test marketing service packages that give the customer some control over incoming calls. 
In one package, for example, the customer can store six phone numbers. 
The phone will then either ring distinctively if those numbers call, or the call can be shunted to a recorded message without even ringing the customer's phone. 

   A more powerful feature, Automatic Number Identification, has raised eyebrows among civil libertarians. 
It displays the caller's number, so the customer can ignore calls he doesn't recognize -- or does. 

   When Designers Think
   To Include Handicapped
   DESIGNING a product for able-bodied people so it's also useful to the handicapped sometimes requires only imagination, not much money, as can be seen in a couple of recent innovations. 

   Standard software for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh line includes a file called "Easy Access" for people who can't type with both hands or have trouble manipulating the mouse. 
With the program, a command that usually calls for pressing two or more keys simultaneously can be invoked by pressing them one at a time. 
Another feature allows the cursor to be moved by tapping numeric keys. 
Apple declined to state the cost, but the programs are extremely simple. 

   Similarly, WearEver-ProctorSilex Inc.'s ceramic baking dishes have molded-in braille dots that tell the capacity. 
According to Marshall B. Johnson, corporate industrial designer at the Chillicothe, Ohio, company, adding the dots cost "practically nothing." 

   Odds and Ends
   GLASNOST TRICKLES down, as a top Soviet designer heads for the U.S. to sign an agreement of cooperation with his American counterpart. 

   This month Yuri Soloviev, president of the Society of Soviet Designers, will meet in New York with Peter H. Wooding, president of the Industrial Designers Society of America, to discuss "matters of mutual interest." . . . 
The great leveler? 
Using electronic mail in group decision-making tends to diminish the importance of the participants' status, according to a study of students at Clarkson University, in Potsdam, NY. 
The researchers concluded that electronic media are better for exchanging information than for "situations where the implementation of the decision depends on the distribution of power or implementing authority." 
The study also found that people are less inhibited communicating on electronic media than in face-to-face discussion.

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   When I graduated from college, my first job was at a suburban newspaper. 
It is now defunct, but at that time it was a reasonably viable operation that put a few young, and low-salaried, people into the writing business every year. 

   One of my first assignments was the standard interview with a person who had reached a significant post-octogenarian birthday and might have some words to pass along to the younger population. 
It is also an assignment no other reporter wants, so it usually goes to the new guy. 

   I was told to see a man named Tannenburg on his 95th birthday, an event that was being attended by dozens of children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and assorted in-laws from all over the country. 
After reading the bio sheet, I thought that his background was excellent for a feature story. 
He had fought in the Spanish-American War, survived the San Francisco earthquake, remembered seeing William Howard Taft, and actually met Thomas Edison. 

   The meeting with Tannenburg started off on a promising note. 
He was mentally sharp and his hearing and eyesight were quite good. 
He spoke in loud, clear tones and was, for all the world, a man totally in control of his faculties and quite capable of giving a young reporter a corking good story. 
Then he started on the cardboard. 

   "Never throw away a piece of cardboard," he said, as though anticipating a question about advice to the world. 
He went into an impromptu recitation of the many uses of cardboard in everyday living: wrapping packages, reinforcing, padding, burning, decorating and "fixing things." 
I tried to steer him into the Spanish-American War and recollections of Taft and Edison, but he would have none of it, preferring to explain the myriad ways that he had used cardboard that very week. 

   By this time there was no diverting him and it was clear that turn-of-the-century memories would remain in the past. 
I was ushered into a spare room where Tannenburg kept his cardboard supply -- bundles of tan and gray sheets, tied with string and ready for immediate application to that better life that we all seek. 
He was clearly ready, at a moment's notice, to wrap, repair, reinforce and pad. 

   As it turned out, I wrote the story from the bio sheet, adding a few observations about his personal appearance and some quotes from the relatives. 
The Tannenburg experience has never left me. 
This man had walked the earth for almost a century, had seen two world wars, a major depression, a complete shift in the balance of world power, and more than a dozen presidents -- yet to him it all crystallized in the necessity of having lots of cardboard available. 
I occasionally shudder with the frightening thought that maybe Tannenburg was right in his assessment of the meaning of it all. 

   This, then, is Tannenburg's Encapsulation of Life: "Never throw away a piece of cardboard." 
It makes sense; it does, indeed.

   Today is Sunday, Feb. 19, the 50th day of 1989. There are 315
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Feb. 19, 1803, Congress voted to accept Ohio's borders and

Yugoslavia, hours after twin brothers Phil and Steve Mahre placed
first and second in the men's slalom event.
   One year ago: A group calling itself the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of U.S.
Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, who was in charge of a United
Nations truce observer group in Lebanon.
   Today's birthdays: Former jockey Eddie Arcaro is 73. Singer
Smokey Robinson is 49. Britain's Prince Andrew is 29. Actress

<HEAD>Hotel Del Coronado Celebrates 100 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Hotel del Coronado, a lavish
Victorian seaside resort with a star-studded past, will celebrate
its centennial next weekend with an extravangaza befitting its most
gilded days.
   Built in 1888 for $1 million, the hotel is one of the world's
largest wooden structures and the nation's only working commercial
hotel with a national monument designation.
   Famous for its Queen Anne design, the Del, as the hotel is known
locally, has served as host to 10 presidents, royalty from around
the world and countless celebrities.
   Businessman Montgomery Ward, actors Charlie Chaplin and Mary
Pickford, and President Abraham Lincoln's son, Robert Todd, are
among those who signed its registry. Thomas Edison was the
five-story hotel's lighting technician.
   The picturesque resort of red-roofed turrets atop a white
gingerbread exterior on a peninsula south of San Diego also has
been a backdrop for a number of films and television shows.
   ``The Hotel Del is something fantastic,'' said silent screen
star Anita Paige, who stayed at the hotel while filming ``The
Flying Fleet'' in 1927. ``I've been to Europe since and their only
competition is in France.''
   A posh weekend party celebrating the 100th birthday of the
wooden castle's Feb. 19, 1888, opening begins Friday night.
   Some 750 guests, including dozens of celebrities and movie
stars, have paid $5,000 a couple to participate in the full
weekend. Proceeds will be donated to charity.
   At Friday night's festivities for 2,000, a disc jockey
resembling a hip Edison will spin records in one room as musicians
and dancers perform in others.
   Marilyn Monroe look-alikes and original Munchkins from the movie
``The Wizard of Oz'' will wander the paneled hallways. The film
``Some Like it Hot,'' starring Miss Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony
Curtis, was filmed on location at the hotel in 1958, and Oz author
L. Frank Baum, a frequent hotel guest, allegedly based his book's
Emerald City on the Del.
   Saturday will feature a harbor tour with America's Cup victor
Dennis Conner, a celebrity tennis tournament and a ball, followed
by a turn-of-the-century style picnic Sunday with hot air balloons
and a Navy air show.
   Comedians George Burns and Phyllis Diller will be among the
weekend's entertainers.
   But as current owner Larry Lawrence tells it, the hotel itself
nearly didn't make it to the party. When he bought the 399-room
hotel in 1963, it had fallen prey to termites and neglect.
   ``There was no electricity in many places, no water above the
second floor,'' said Lawrence, the hotel's sixth owner. ``It was
infested with termites and rats. This was a property that had
everything but the bulldozer gutting it down.''
   More than $40 million later, the hotel stands with its
stateliness restored. It has new foundations, plumbing, heating,
electricity and an $8 million fire protection system.
   A steel frame was implanted to bolster the Crown Room, a
monumental dining room with a sugar pine ceiling that rises 33
feet. The hotel also was expanded.
   In 1970, the Crown Room was the site of the largest state dinner
outside Washington, D.C., with then-President Richard Nixon,
outgoing President Lyndon Johnson, Mexican President Gustavo Diaz
Ordaz and 800 others.
   Today, about half of the hotel's guests are corporate
executives. With 1,400 employees serving 700 suites, guests pay a
premium for service, Lawrence said. The hotel's average rate is
$200 a day.
   It all began as a dream of railroad tycoon Elisha Babcock and
piano magnate H.L. Story, who envisioned while hunting on the
barren peninsula a resort that would be ``the talk of the Western
world.''
   It was designed by three brothers, former railroad architects
James, Merritt and Watson Reid, and built largely by unskilled
Chinese laborers. It became the largest structure outside of New
York City to be electrically lighted, powered by the first power
plant in California.

   Thought for Today: ``There is a Law that man should love his
neighbor as himself. In a few hundred years it should be as natural
to mankind as breathing or the upright gait; but if he does not
learn it he must perish.'' -- Alfred Alder, Austrian psychoanalyst
(1870-1937).

</P>
<P>
You might remember Polly, played by "The Cosby Show's" Keshia Knight Pulliam, 
from last year's "Polly," a Disney musical special loosely based on Eleanor H. 
Porter's children's classic "Pollyanna." Pulliam played a girl who comes to 
live with her rich aunt (played by Phylicia Rashad, also of "Cosby") after her 
parents are killed in a car accident. The new Polly Comin' Home! continues 
where the story left off, with the 12-year-old heroine and her friends working 
to ease racial tension in her small town. In the process, Polly even helps her 
aunt rekindle a romance! The TV movie also stars Dorian Harewood and Barbara 
Montgomery of "Married People." 
</P>
<P>
"Polly Comin' Home!" Sunday at 7 p.m., NBC. For families.

Madeline's Christmas is a new animated special based on the classic children's 
books by Ludwig Bemelmans. Here, the precocious Madeline, who lives at a 
boarding school in Paris, is the only girl in the school who isn't in bed with 
a cold. She finds herself faced with the awesome responsibility of spreading 
holiday cheer, but winds up getting help from a special visitor. Christopher 
Plummer narrates the charming tale.
