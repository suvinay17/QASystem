<F P=106> [Article by toz: "Atomic Cluster Formation Facilitates </F>
Production of Nanostructures"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--Specific production of nanostructures is 
hardly possible with the masking techniques used until now, if 
one wants to produce future electronic switches with structural 
widths below about 50 to 60 nanometers. To be sure, using 
converted grid-tunnel electron microscopes scientists have been 
able to place single atoms in a specific spot on silicon 
surfaces. But this technique is slow, because only one atom at a 
time can be worked on, and it would be very expensive. 
  However, new research results by Swiss and North American 
scientists now indicate that there are various ways to build up 
metals, oxides or possibly other compounds as well in a 
controlled manner for functional electronic structures on 
silicon or metals. 
  A Swiss group of physicists at the EPF Lausanne (Institut de 
Physique Experimental, CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland) is using a 
guided separation process which leads to clustering or 
depositing on various surfaces. The surfaces absorb individual 
atoms, which by means of very precise regulation of the 
prevailing substrate and material temperatures gather into 
larger aggregations and finally into clusters. 
  In so doing the individual atoms act similar to 
crystallization nuclei in crystal growing. In these processes 
the atomic surface structure also plays an important role for 
the depositing processes, a "shaping, defining" role, so to 
speak. The physicists describe their work principle as 
"diffusion-controlled aggregation." In these processes the laws 
of depositing follow the kinetic behavior of the various 
materials. 
  It has been possible in the laboratory to deposit, among 
other things, several hundred Angstrom-long, strip-like lines of 
copper atoms on surfaces of palladium foils and cluster-sized 
silver particles on bases of platinum. 
  The results by the Swiss physicists are not yet suitable for 
immediate practical application. But they have discovered 
principles with which it is now possible to build suitable 
structures for simple, and later on also more complicated, 
three-dimensionally conceived, electronic components. 
  U.S. scientists at the NIST National Institute of Science 
and 
Technology in Gaithersburg (Maryland) have taken another 
approach. They use laser light in order precisely to deposit 
individual atoms. With their method they were able to build 
several three-dimensional tracks of chromium atoms on a silicon 
base, for example, which are a little more than 30 nanometers 
high and are spaced about 213 nanometers apart. 
  Right now their method functions with metal atoms which are 
directly applied with the laser beam on the bases. In so doing 
the excited metal atoms "ride" on the laser beam, which 
simultaneously also excites the base, so that when they meet 
aggregations similar to those constructed in the Swiss 
experiments are created. This method works quite fast: In one 
minute it was possible to apply 0.7 nanometers of chromium onto 
a relatively large surface of 0.4 by 1 millimeter with a laser 
in the spectral range of 425 nanometers. 
  For the moment the method permits only application of 
straight line structures. But the developers are working on 
being able to produce more complex structures as well. This 
method has the advantage that it is no longer necessary to work 
with many steps of lithographic masking processes and 
considerably more expensive x-ray or ultraviolet light. In the 
subsequent work one will also use two or more laser beams in 
order to apply structures from not just one but several 
materials. 
  At the moment, the still unsatisfactory stability and 
relatively uneven speed of the laser beams has turned out to 
represent a bottleneck. It is believed that this problem can be 
satisfactorily solved in about two to three years. It would then 
be possible to produce structures with widths of six nanometers. 
In this way "nanoelectronic" switches could then actually be 
produced which are about 100 times smaller than today's 
microelectronic switches. 
  Meanwhile, applications have been made for several patents 
for the laser method. The government institute cannot use these 
patents itself and therefore wants even now to conclude 
utilization agreements with interested industrial enterprises 
which are prepared to participate financially and with manpower 
in the future development work, reports NIST (National Institute 
of Science and Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899, USA).

   Scientists at AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories said they invented a
more powerful optical microscope that should vastly improve
the examination of living matter, including tiny structures
inside cells.
   Until now, only electron microscopes have been able to see
such tiny structures, but they couldn't view living cells,
because living matter can't survive their powerful electron
beams.

<TEXT>
   Bell Labs, the research arm of American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., already has received inquiries from microscope
manufacturers about licensing the new technology, one of the
scientists said.
   The new microscope uses a laser and optical fiber to
resolve an image only 12 nanometers in diameter, one-fourth
the size that can be seen in the most powerful existing
optical microscopes. The new microscope uses a light beam
that's 20 nanometers wide and 10,000 times brighter than
earlier light sources. A nanometer is a billionth of a meter,
or about four hundred-millionths of an inch.
   The development, reported in the current issue of Science
by Bell Labs' scientists Eric Betzig and Jay Trautman, is
part of a decade-long race to perfect optical microscopes
that will eventually be able to see objects the size of
molecules.
   Optical microscopes, which have been around for 300 years,
work by shining light upward through an object into the
microscope. Objects that bend the light waves become visible
as shadows. But objects smaller than the lengths of the light
waves don't diffract light and remain invisible.
   Electron microscopes, by contrast, pick up far tinier
objects, some the size of atoms, because electrons have
shorter wavelengths than light waves used in optical
equipment. But they have the drawback of killing living
matter.
   The new Bell Labs microscope is a type known as a
"near-field" microscope, in which the microscope and its
light source are brought extremely close to the object. The
width of the light beam that shines up through the object
determines how small an object can be seen. Previous
near-field microscope experiments have produced spots of
light 50 nanometers wide by shining light through hollow
glass tubes known as micropipettes.
   However, the light beam would weaken as it bounced off the
wall of the pipette until it reached the opening at the tip
of the pipette. When the light beam emerged, some of the
light would spread around the object instead of piercing it,
thus impairing resolution. Moreover, the light source, if
drawn too close to a sample such as a cell, would scramble it
like an egg.
   For these reasons, the Bell Labs scientists decided
against using a micropipette as a conduit for delivering the
light beam. Instead, they took a strand of extremely clear
optical fiber tapered to a tiny tip. They coated the tapered
portion of the fiber with an aluminum glaze, being careful to
leave the very tip bare. For the light source, they affixed a
laser to the opposite end of the fiber.
   They found that the tapered point helps to concentrate the
light as it travels toward the bare tip, which is "perfectly
clear," says Mr. Betzig. The light beam that emerges is only
12 nanometers wide, and the tip can be brought close enough
to follow the contours of a living cell with practically no
dispersion of light -- and no scrambled eggs.
   The microscope operates as a scanner, converting the light
received from the specimen into data that a computer takes
and reassembles into an image displayed on a video screen.
   Besides examining cells and their internal structures, the
new microscope can be used to visualize details on such
electronic devices as magneto optic storage disks and to
study lithographic patterns etched into photo-resist
materials. Tests show the unit will even perform
"fluorescence contrast" so that cell parts stained with
fluorescent dyes can be examined.
   A near-field microscope using the Bell Labs design would
cost about $20,000, whereas electron microscopes can fetch as
much as $1 million, says Mr. Trautman. One hurdle remains,
however: The microscope produces only extremely slow-motion
video images. "Right now, we can scan two frames a second vs.
TV's 30 frames a second," says Mr. Betzig. "But we're working
on improving that."

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Max Planck Researchers in Heidelberg </F>
Achieve Structural Widths of 80 Nanometers"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt. Researchers at the Max Planck Institute 
(MPI) for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg are currently 
investigating a gas-field ion source (GFIS) that can generate 
particularly fine, highly intense ion beams. This device, called 
the GFIS cannon, now makes it theoretically possible to produce 
and investigate structures in the nanometer scale range, with an 
eye to applications in materials science, environmental control, 
and medical/biological research. 
  The ion beams are generated in a very high electrical field 
to an extremely fine peak. A special peak geometry (superpeak) 
makes the ion beam extremely narrow and the radiation about 
1,000 times "brighter" than is the case in normal field emission 
peaks. The life of the "superpeak" can now be extended to the 
point where even industrial utilization is feasible. 
  Professor Siegfried Kalbitzer, director of the Nuclear Solid 
State Physics and Materials Science Working Group at the Max 
Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, notes in the MPI journal 
SPIEGEL that this ion source has already been able to achieve an 
image point diameter of about 80 nanometers and that it seems 
possible eventually to reach a diameter of 10 nanometers. 
  "While classical semiconductor technology currently plans 
structural elements having the finest structures at 100 
nanometers, structures at 10 nanometers will open completely new 
avenues," Kalbitzer predicts. One first simple application of 
focussed ion beams, which has already been tested in Heidelberg, 
is the generation of optical patterns in semiconductors (silicon 
or silicon carbide). When a thin, transparent layer of such 
crystals is irradiated with a sufficiently high dose of heavy 
ions, the ions destroy the crystals in the irradiated areas. the 
material in those areas becomes formless (amorphous). 
  Amorphous silicon has optical properties that are different 
from crystalline. When the light wavelengths are right, a clear 
"bright-dark" contrast, suitable for storing the patterns, is 
observed. Crystals only reform in an amorphous spot at 
temperatures of 600ÎC. When the ambient temperatures are in 
the normal range, information can be stored for a long time. 
  Kalbitzer calculates that a beam diameter of 100 nanometers 
will permit up to 10 billion bits to be written in one square 
centimeter of storage area. This is about a hundred times 
greater capacity than the current storage densities. A 100 
cm[.sup]2[/]-area disk is therefore able to record a billion 
data points or a text volume of 100 million DIN-A4 pages. Should 
it ever become possible to approach the structural realm of 10 
nanometers, even far greater storage densities would of course 
be possible. 
  Ion beam technology can also find applications in 
micromechanics and microchemistry. The Heidelberg researchers 
have shown that a neon ion beam can be used to etch fine 
patterns in thin copper wires, for example. Because secondary 
electrons, which can be captured on a screen, are released in 
this process, it therefore becomes possible to observe and even 
control the progress of microtechnical processing. 
  Moreover, this kind of system permits highly precise cutting 
procedures to be performed, as, for example, preparative cuts on 
organic molecular compounds, microorganisms, and all sorts of 
specimens. In Kalbitzer's opinion, the exposure of photoresists 
with ion beams would be a very interesting experiment, in that 
the desired patterns could be written in substantially shorter 
times through the use of ion beam lithography. This becomes even 
more advantageous, the larger the wafer surfaces to be described 
and the higher the structural densities become.

  [Text] Assistant Professor Masahiro Asada and others in a 
Tokyo Institute of Technology research group succeeded in making 
an experimental quantum box laser and confirmed its oscillation. 
Theoretically, it is predicted that this future-type 
semiconductor laser will make ultra-low current oscillation 
possible. This laser is different from the conventional element 
which consists of layers of ultra-thin semiconductor film. The 
new structure lines up minute semiconductor particles that are 
30 nanometers in size. With this structure, the electrons can be 
used for radiation without waste. Right now it is necessary to 
supply a large current under an ultra-low temperature condition 
and the laser is not at the point where its full potential can 
be realized. However, it can be expected in the future that the 
performance level can be raised if the manufacturing technology 
is improved. 
  Minute semiconductor particles are lined up. 
  The experimental laser consists of a plane surface 
indium-gallium-arsenide film with many particle forms of 
gallium-indium-arsenide lined up in a grid pattern and embedded 
in it. This film itself is sandwiched between indium-phosphorus 
films. The diameter of a single particle is 30 nanometers, the 
thickness is 12 nanometers, and the space between adjoining 
particles is 70 nanometers. 
  These kinds of semiconductor particles are called ``quantum 
boxes'' since the electrons are confined in these particles one 
by one just as if they are in boxes. The conventional 
semiconductor laser is a thin film with electrons held in it. 
The electrons can be trapped in a much smaller space when this 
is chopped up into boxes and it is predicted that the radiation 
efficiency will be exceptionally advanced. 
  For this reason, in comparison with semiconductor lasers 
actually in use at the present time, it is possible that these 
lasers will be able to oscillate with only several tenths or 
less of the current. Since the current consumption is small, the 
result is that heat generation and such will not be a problem 
even if a number of them are grouped together and it is expected 
that the laser will be useful in the development of optical 
communications and optical computers. 
  In experiments with the experimental laser at 196 degrees 
below zero Celsius, light pulses were oscillated at about 1.3 
microns. It was also confirmed that the quantum box confined the 
electrons well. However, the current necessary for oscillation 
is 1.1 amperes, which, when compared with the current required 
by a conventional semiconductor laser, is rather larger.

<F P=106> [Article by "JB": "Holographic Grating for Environmental </F>
Analysis and Laser Work. Optoelectronic Devices Can Become 
Smaller and Less Expensive/Resolution of 0.3 Nanometer"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--Holographic gratings are optical 
microstructures that can be used in numerous ways in optical 
measuring systems and in laser equipment. The Berlin Institute 
for Optics GmbH [Limited Liability Company] (Rudower Chaussee 5, 
12484 Berlin) has developed new kinds of holographic gratings 
that can be used in spectrometers for environmental analysis and 
for optimization of the application of high-power lasers. 
  As Dr. Christel Budzinski reports, optical microstructures 
like holographic gratings can be fabricated by processes that 
come from microelectronics. They include photolithography and 
dry etching. Holographic gratings can help to reduce the size of 
optoelectronic devices. The cost of these devices can also be 
lowered by the use of gratings. 
  Spectrometers in the field of environmental analysis are an 
application possibility. Incident light is split up spectrally 
and analyzed in spectrometers. These instruments have to be 
especially lightweight and compact if they are used in 
satellites for remote sensing, for determination of the state of 
terrestrial vegetation, for example. 
  A grating from Berlin specially developed for this purpose 
can help here. The spectrometer required operates in the 
spectral region of 650 to 800 nanometers. An image of a strip of 
the earth's surface (swath) is formed by means of a lens in the 
entrance slit and is then directed to the grating, where the 
spectrum is split into individual colors. The spectrum is then 
picked up by a photodetector array (CCD) and can be analyzed. 
  Atmospheric gases and changes in them as well as the state 
of 
vegetation can be detected in this way by estimating the red 
shift of chlorophyll margins. The holographic grating is the 
chief component. It defines the precision of the measurements. 
The spectral resolution, that is, the precision with which 
individual wavelengths can be differentiated, is especially 
decisive. 
  The resolution comes to 0.3 nanometer for the grating 
developed for the remote-sensing spectrometer. This also enables 
the spatial resolution of measured values in a modified 
spectrometer. Thus, the values for a swath can be associated 
with individual elements of the earth's surface, and this 
enhances the strength of the evidence of environmental analysis. 
  Laser technology is an additional application possibility 
for 
holographic gratings. CO&lt;inf&gt; 2&lt;/inf&gt;  lasers above all have 
recently taken on importance in medicine and in the working of 
materials. This type of laser is very efficient and can be 
handled with precision. 
  This precision is closely associated with the diameter of 
the 
laser spot. The smaller the diameter of the beam, the higher the 
energy density and the more finely detailed the work that can be 
done. Now holographic gratings can help to reduce the laser 
spot's size. However, conventional gratings fabricated by 
photolithography do not have especially high stress tolerance. 
  The gratings are ruined even at lower laser outputs. That is 
why the scientists in Berlin have fabricated holographic 
gratings by means of a molding process and with copper as the 
substrate. These gratings have substantially higher stress 
tolerance and thus can contribute to higher precision when 
working with high-power lasers.

  [Text] Tokyo, June 14 KYODO -- Toshiba Corp. said Tuesday 
[14 Jun] it will begin global marketing of a new red-light 
semiconductor laser diode that significantly increases the 
storage capacity of optical disk systems. 
  The TOLD9151mb operates at a wavelength of 685 nanometers, 
compared with the 780 nanometers currently used in optical disk 
systems, Toshiba said. A nanometer is one-billionth of a meter. 
  The smaller spot size allows almost double the volume of 
information to be stored on the same size disk, it said. 
  Mass production of the device, at some 60,000 units per 
month, will begin at the end of the year. Toshiba has begun 
shipping samples of the laser diode at a price of 15,000 yen per 
unit.

<F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Jimin (1728 4949 3046)] </F>
  [Text] Beijing, 30 Mar (XINHUA) -- Science and technology 
personnel at the Beijing Laboratory of Vacuum Physics, an 
affiliate of the Chinese Academy of Sciences [CAS], made an 
outstanding achievement after only months of effort: They 
succeeded in removing and implanting silicon atoms with relative 
ease, thus enabling our country to penetrate the world's front 
line of high technology research conducted in the nanometer 
range. 
  The good news won words of praise from inside and outside 
China. State Councillor Song Jian asked relevant departments to 
relay congratulations from the State Council to the researchers. 
CAS President Zhou Guangzhou was deeply gratified at the 
achievement. Nobel Laureate Binnig and Doctor Ke-er-dun [2688 
1422 7319], a world-renowned expert in the nanometer field, 
separately sent letters highly estimating the achievements with 
such praise as "a world-level achievement" and "a very beautiful 
experimental result." 
  Shifting a single atom was once a dream of mankind. Atoms 
are so small that if we arrange 100 million of them in a row, 
their collective length will amount to only about 1 cm, and we 
will still have difficulty picking them up. Starting in the 
1990's, a few countries, including the United States, startled 
the world by succeeding in shifting an atom in the low 
temperature range of 269 degrees Celsius below zero. The 
technique involved, which is extremely attractive due to its 
potential applications and commercial value, can push mankind's 
ability to reorder the world from the micrometer to the 
nanometer range (one nanometer is equal to one billionth of a 
meter), and foretells a revolutionary leap in future production 
methods. 
  Initially, our scientific and technological circles, which 
lacked the means to conduct experiments, could only watch 
impatiently as others scored successes. In August 1993, the 
Beijing Laboratory of Vacuum Physics imported an ultravacuum 
tunnel scanning microscope [chao gao zhen kong sao miao sui dao 
xian wei jing 6389 7559 4176 4500 2217 4178 7143 6670 7359 1792 
6975], which is used for observing the surface topography of 
substances. To modify equipment for atomic manipulation, the 
laboratory added a special microcontroller, and even used 
aluminium lunch boxes to form a series of shields along the 
scanning path. Led by Professor Pang Shijin, researchers worked 
day and night and successively made significant progress in 
experiments conducted under normal temperatures: 
  They wrote the smallest possible characters. Other countries 
have displayed their abilities to manipulate atoms by utilizing 
a shape similar to the Chinese character "xie [write 1400]." 
How good is the vacuum laboratory when it comes to "writing?" 
The laboratory removed atoms from the crystal lattice of the 
silicon surface with a probe attached to the ultravacuum tunnel 
scanning microscope, and purposely traced out the Roman letters 
"PRC" and the Chinese characters "zhong guo [China 0022 0948]" 
on the surface. Each stroke of the Chinese characters has an 
average width of two nanometers, and was produced by removing 
three to four silicon atoms that were arranged side by side. It 
is believed that these characters are the smallest in the world. 
  Atomic insertion is regarded as being more significant than 
removal. For example, when in the future we wish to fine-tune 
an apparatus at the nanometer level to change or enhance its 
performance, we have to implant foreign atoms to form an alloy 
with the existing substance. Photographs produced by 
researchers at the vacuum laboratory indicated that the 
researchers were successful. White spots on the photographs 
showing that the inserted atoms are the result of a pile-up -- 
an increase in the atomic radius which results in a clear atomic 
lattice being obscured. The researchers claimed that the 
process of atom insertion has not yet been reported inside or 
outside the country. 
  The researchers more or less figured out the patterns of 
atomic arrangements pertaining to the bounded domains [chou jie 
3985 3954] of atoms on a silicon surface. They discovered that 
basically two kinds of defects can occur in the geometric 
patterns of atomic lattices: "Z-shape" and "ladle-shape" 
defects. Using these findings, the physics vacuum laboratory 
has introduced over 30 types of possible patterns of atomic 
arrangements on a silicon surface. It is believed that the 
laboratory has scored a first in the world in this respect.

  [Text] Sharp developed technology for oscillation with a 
high-output semiconductor laser which emits 680 nanometer red 
light. By attaching a transparent layer, which acts as a window, 
to the laser's end surface, Sharp was able to achieve the 
world's highest output (295 milliwatts) by preventing heat 
generation, which occurs when the end surface of the crystal 
absorbs light and deteriorates. This achievement will raise the 
reliability during the recording and reading of data on optical 
discs. Sharp will continue to prevent the deterioration of 
interior elements and such and also plans to apply this 
technology to short wavelength lasers, which are suitable for 
high density recording. 
  The most distinguishing feature of the newly developed laser 
is the window which was grown by the MOCVD [metal organic 
chemical vapor deposition] method on a laser element composed of 
aluminum, gallium, indium, and phosphorus. The window has a 
composition similar to that of the laser element. Because it is 
possible to control the light absorption at the end surface, it 
is possible for the laser to have a long life span. When 50 
milliwatt lasers were compared, the one with the window was able 
to extend its lifetime by more than 10 times that of the one 
without the window. 
  When a semiconductor laser's output is increased, the laser 
element's end surface absorbs light, heat is generated, and the 
crystal structure breaks down. Up until now, the optical output 
for a red laser came to a halt at 200 milliwatts. 
  The red semiconductor laser is used for compact disc [CD] 
reading and for minidisc [MD] reading and writing. A 700 
nanometer type with an output from 30-50 milliwatts has been put 
to practical use. The volume of information, which includes 
imagery and voice and such, increases the need for the 
commercialization of shortwave lasers that can record with 
higher speed and more density. The company intends to apply this 
element design to short wavelength lasers with high output.

   The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based maker of measurement and inspection equipment wouldn't be more specific. 

   Nanometrics said results are expected to improve because of higher order and shipment levels, and because of a $750,000 payment it received from Japan's Hitachi Ltd. in a licensing agreement. 
Nanometrics said it granted a license to Hitachi to manufacture and sell, in the U.S. and other countries, scanning electron microscopes using Nanometrics's patented technology.

<F P=106> [Article by Arnold Noeldechen: "Research Priorities: GMD </F>
Wants to Push Neural Information Development in the Federal 
Republic--Nanoelectronics is Also Moving Ahead--Light Pulses 
Control a Transistor Made of Organic Molecules"] 
  [Text] Neural information science plays an important role 
in Germany for the development of new image evaluation systems 
including medicine and robot systems. Neural information science 
will also become important for future telecommunication systems, 
as Dr. Christoph von der Malsburg (Ruhr-University Bochum) 
pointed out at a seminar of the Society for Mathematics and Data 
Processing (GMD) at Birlinghoven Castle (53757 Sankt Augustin). 
  According to Professor von der Malsburg, the development of 
neural information science constitutes a switch from Boolean 
logic to an "algorithmic world" to control self-organizing 
systems. Neural information science tries to use the brain's 
data processing functions for technical communication 
processes--a field which GMD wants to emphasize in the future. 
  An interesting practical application is an image processing 
system which is able to recognize persons on photos, even when 
the photos have been disguised or when they were taken under 
different illumi nation or viewing angles. For recognition, such 
a photo is covered with a coarse grid and the image content of 
each grid cell is defined by an algorithm. 
  The system is based on a mathematical formula which 
describes 
how small, spatially arranged waves are changed by a 
perpendicular sine wave. This allows the mathematical 
determination of the image content of all grid cells. 
  Pictures which were distorted by rotation or other means can 
be quickly compared with the original photo using the distorted 
grid and the previously defined image content, so that the 
identity can be established even from distorted pictures. The 
system can be used for checking personal identities and 
signatures. 
  However, it is also suitable for highly automated measuring 
systems to avoid rear-end collisions. With this system, robots 
can "recognize" and sort out individual parts, even if they are 
scattered around randomly. Another possible application is the 
automatic sorting of waste which would be very beneficial from 
an ecological point of view since manual sorting does not make 
sense because of the high labor cost and slow sorting speed. 
  In addition to neural information science, GMD is pushing 
ahead with numerous research projects for the integration of 
computer hardware to avoid falling behind the United States or 
Japan on an international level. Dr. Gerhard Abstreiter, a 
professor at the Walter-Schottky-Institute of the Technical 
University Munich, claims that continued development of 
microelectronics towards "nanoelectronics" with its even finer 
structures will not be restricted by physical and technical 
limitations in the next 20 years. 
  He says that the necessary manufacturing techniques will not 
require a completely new technology, but can be accomplished 
with advanced processes which are already being used today. They 
are sufficient for layer thicknesses around five Angstrom and 
for producing structures around 60 nanometers. 
  Such ultra large-scale (ULSI) circuits would have to take 
into account quantum-mechanical effects. Research of his 
institute in this field has already resulted in novel quantum 
devices, and it is possible to produce n-type transistors for 
functional logic circuits in the nanometer range. 
  According to Dr. Manfred Pilkuhn (Physical Institute of the 
University Stuttgart) the continued integration beyond the 
nanometer range towards the molecule and atom range will require 
the use of biological reactions in order to implement molecular 
circuits measuring only a few nanometers. This includes, for 
instance, the principle underlying photosynthesis, i.e. the 
controlled transfer of a charge under light. 
  The physicists in Stuttgart have presented a molecular 
transistor which consists only of organic molecules and where 
the transfer of the charge can be controlled by light pulses. A 
combination of fulgides called a switching molecule can "block" 
the transfer of a charge using ultraviolet light. The transfer 
is made possible again by light in the visible spectrum. 
Naphtacyanines in a polyethylene matrix receive and store the 
transmitted charge. This molecular switch was supported and 
developed in Stuttgart as part of special research program 329. 
  With the minute size of these structures around ten 
nanometers, such switch structures can also be used as data 
storage for binary information with the potential for memory 
densities similar to those of the human brain. 
  As Professor Pilkhun's experiments have shown, the required 
printed circuits in the molecular range can be produced quite 
easily using long molecular chains consisting of polythiophenes, 
for instance. Since the photolithographic process cannot be used 
in the molecular range, the researchers will attempt to replace 
it with application techniques using the Langmuir-Blodgett 
process. However, Pilkuhn admits that it is not easy to build up 
the desired structures in this manner. 
  Another unresolved problem is the attachment of molecular 
circuits to circuits using nano- or microelectronics. Pilkuhn 
thinks it is possible to work with optical controls using 
semiconductor lasers instead of the conventional electrical 
connections. Experiments in this area are underway at the 
University of Stuttgart. 
  One can only hope that the GND will have more success with 
its research projects in neural information science and advanced 
electronics than with the development of parallel computers. 
Some observers think that the Suprenum project could have given 
German industry a considerable edge if they had succeeded to 
develop the related software in time. However, the public should 
also be informed about the economic success, the so-called 
spin-off, so that the general public understands that research 
in Germany pays off. 
  According to the Federal Ministry for Research, GMD's head 
organization, this year DM1.5 billion will be available for 
research in information science with DM 1.04 million coming from 
the budget of the Federal Ministry for Research. Private 
industry, however, finances about 95 percent of the research 
itself and thus manages almost completely without government 
support. On the other hand, the Federal Ministry for Research 
supports nearly all research institutions, universities, and 
research associations employing about 3,000 scientists.

   British scientists reported progress in understanding an
unexpected discovery about silicon that researchers hope may
be a breakthrough in electronics materials.
   The discovery, reported a year ago, is that an old,
little-used form of silicon, called porous silicon, can be
made to glow. If exploited, scientists hope that the
discovery will someday make cheap silicon usable for making
lasers and electronic displays that are currently made from
such expensive, difficult-to-fabricate materials as gallium
arsenide. Light-emitting silicon chips might also be the
basis of super-fast optical computers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In this week's issue of the journal Nature, British
scientist L.T. Canham and a colleague, A.G. Cullis, report
new experiments in which they've increased the intensity of
the light glow coming from silicon and gained some clues as
to why the light emission may be peculiar to porous silicon.
   Like many materials, silicon can absorb energy and re-emit
it as light. But the silicon ordinarily used in electronics
re-emits only a weak beam of invisible infrared light, which
is one reason why silicon has a dull, gray or black
appearance rather than the sheen of many metals.
   Porous silicon is a thin film of silicon that has been
electrochemically etched. The silicon film doesn't etch
uniformly, so it is riddled with tiny pores and channels.
   In their report, Messrs. Canham and Cullis say they gained
new evidence that the light emission in porous silicon stems
from a so-called quantum size effect, that is, an effect
related to the size of the etched channels. They etched four
samples of porous silicon, each with a different width of
pores and channels. Of the four samples, the most intense
light beam -- a bright red glow -- came from porous silicon
with the narrowest channels. Narrowest in their terms is
about three nanometers; a nanometer is about four
100-millionths of an inch.
   The researchers say that if they can understand why porous
silicon glows they may be able to answer a much bigger
question -- whether light emission from porous silicon can be
stimulated by an electric current. So far, the experiments
have used only beams of laser light to induce the silicon to
glow. Electronic devices such as communications lasers or
light-emitting diodes or even futuristic computer chips
employing light signals are useful largely because they
convert electrical signals to light signals and vice versa.

A new generation of microscopes, more powerful than scientists would have
believed possible before the 1980s, is enabling researchers not only to
'see' individual atoms but also to pick them up and move them around.
These microscopes will be vital instruments for the coming era of
'nanotechnology', in which miniaturisation will produce atomic-scale
structures thousands of times smaller than those used in microelectronics
today. On that scale, all the words in the Bible could be written on the
point of a pin.
(A brief explanation of the terminology used in nanotechnology: the word
comes from the Greek nanos for dwarf. The fundamental unit of the field is
the nanometre, one billionth of a metre.)
The first of the new instruments, the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope, was
invented in 1981 by Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at the Swiss
laboratories of IBM, the American computer group. The STM was a wonderful
leap of scientific imagination, recognised unusually promptly with a Nobel
Prize for Physics in 1986.
Conventional microscopes work by focusing beams of radiation or particles.
Optical instruments are limited by the wavelength of visible light, which is
about 500nm; even a perfect lens cannot focus on a point smaller than this,
so they cannot see atoms. To achieve greater resolving power, microscopists
moved to electron beams and X-rays, which have much shorter wavelengths, but
they use penetrating high-energy radiation which is unsuitable for imaging
atoms on surfaces.
Binnig and Rohrer decided to use 'electron tunnelling', one of the slightly
bizarre consequences of quantum theory. When a low voltage is applied to two
conducting materials which are extremely close together but not touching,
electrons 'tunnel' through the gap; the resulting electric current is highly
sensitive to the distance between them.
The instrument built by the IBM researchers had a stylus with the sharpest
possible tip - a single atom - which scanned a metal surface. The variations
in tunnelling current revealed the ups and downs of the atoms on the
surface.
The STM could only give images of materials that conduct electricity. The
next step was the Atomic Force Microscope invented by Binnig and colleagues
in 1985 to look at non-conducting materials. The AFM scans a tip attached to
a thin metal cantilever across the sample, and gives an image based simply
on the repulsive forces between the atoms at the end of the tip and those on
the sample's surface.
More recently, the STM and AFM have spawned a variety of other instruments,
known generically as Scanning Probe Microscopes, which produce atomic images
based on thermal, magnetic, optical and other interactions between the tip
and sample. By speeding up the scanning rate, scientists have even made
'atomic movies', showing how atoms move around on heated surfaces.
An estimated 3,000 SPMs are now operating worldwide, for a vast range of
applications, and the number is increasing. Most are used for research into
surfaces, helping scientists understand processes such as corrosion. They
are also moving on to production lines in the electronics industry,
inspecting semiconductors and other materials for surface quality.
In biology, SPMs have imaged the double helix of the genetic material DNA
and distinguished the chemical 'letters' which hold our genetic code. If the
technique can be speeded sufficiently, it may be possible to read genes by
microscope, instead of using chemical-based analysis.
But much of the excitement about SPMs concerns their potential for
manipulating atoms. Researchers at IBM's Almaden laboratories in California
showed the way in 1990 when pushed atoms of xenon across a nickel surface
with an STM tip, one by one, and arranged them to spell the company's
initials in atomic letters 5nm high.
Such demonstrations show that, in principle, data could be stored in
ultra-compact 'atom-scale memories'.
Decades of work will be required to bring atom-scale devices based on SPMs
to practical fruition. In particular, the speed with which atoms are moved
and scanned will need to increase millions of times.
But it is far from certain that SPMs are the main route to an atom-scale
future. Alternative methods of nano-construction are already further
developed, such as laying down atoms by molecular beams in a vacuum. These
are less sensitive than SPMs but far faster.
The future for the new generation of microscopes may lie more in observing
nano-structures and assembling prototype devices than in mass production.
However they have transformed the way scientists see the world in miniature.

  [Text] Mitsubishi Electric Corporation (MELCO) has 
developed the world's first single crystal thin film for 
application in semiconductors using a carbon material, 
``fullerene (C60).'' Fullerene has been getting much attention 
recently as a new electronic material. A lcm x lcm single 
crystal thin film was produced by depositing ionized molecules 
on a substrate. The new thin film has high heat and radiation 
resistances and can be made into large scale integrated 
circuits, thus enabling development of a new semiconductor 
substrate. Si and GaAs semiconductors have been available up to 
now. MELCO expects the new single crystal thin film to be useful 
for more complex material research on fullerene which is still 
unknown in many respects. 
  Mica (potashmica) at 200ÎC was used as the substrate 
material to develop a fullerene single crystal thin film. 
Fullerene molecules were deposited on this substrate by the 
ionized cluster beam (ICB) method. The ICB method calls for 
ionization of clusters such as molecules and atoms first, then 
accelerating the ion movement by applying voltage, and finally 
depositing the ionized clusters onto the substrate. Using this 
method, fullerene molecules can be uniformly aligned. Proper 
control of ionization and acceleration conditions made 
production of a large single crystal thin film possible, and 
this is the key to practical application for semiconductor 
materials. 
  It was confirmed through transmission electron microscope 
(TEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) that 15 nanometer thick 
single crystal thin film was formed on the entire mica 
substrate, lcm x lcm. It was also confirmed that fullerene 
molecules employed epitxial crystal growth, which is the 
formation process in which the film molecules are uniformly 
lined up according to the crystal orientation of the substrate. 
  At present, the molecular beam deposition method is used 
mainly to form fullerene molecule film. However, this method is 
useful only for polycrystal thin film formation. Formation of 
single crystal thin films has been reported, but the size is 
limited to a little over 100 nanometer each side at a maximum. 
  MELCO confirmed for the first time in 1992 that fullerene 
molecules can be used for semiconductor materials. Their Central 
Research Laboratory and Materials and Electronic Devices 
Laboratory have been jointly conducting research on commercially 
viable size single crystal thin film. MELCO will try to develop 
a transistor device using this single crystal thin film in the 
future. MELCO claims that this new single crystal thin film will 
be useful for more complex material research on fullerene. 
Polycrystal thin films turned out to be not as useful for this 
purpose. 
<H5>  Wide Application Potential--Useful for Optical Material </H5>
  (Commentary) The history of research on fullerene is quite 
short. Up to now, research has been focused mainly on the search 
for new types of fullerene and basic properties. The newly 
achieved result not only contributes to proper measurement of 
fullerene molecule properties but also shows how they might be 
used in semiconductors. The research on new carbon materials has 
gone beyond the basic science stage and made progress in 
materials development which consciously aims at applications. 
  ``Carbon nano tubes,'' ultra fine straw-like substances, 
have 
also been found. This is also a new kind of carbon material, 
which belongs to the same group as the fullerene molecules. The 
fullerene molecules are shaped like a hollow soccer ball, while 
carbon nano tubes are characterized by a tube-like shape with 
layers of carbon atom thin skins. R&amp;D on the new carbon 
materials is still at the primary stage, but the application 
potential is already considered to be extremely high. In 
addition to semiconductor materials, optical materials, high 
performance catalysts, and micro machines are under 
consideration to name just a few. Because of their unique 
shapes, the new carbon materials are a big challenge for 
researchers.

<F P=106> [Article by GMN: "Laser Monitor for Checking Coating </F>
Thickness; New Laser Systems Monitor Coating Processes On-Line"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--New kinds of laser sensors that can be 
used to inspect materials in particular are currently being 
developed in the Department of Metrology of the University of 
Saarland. As Prof. Alexander W. Koch explained, surface 
structures, component movements, surface rough spots, and 
vibrations, as well as coating thicknesses and optical constants 
of thin surface films, for example, can be analyzed with these 
sensors. 
  Especially the thin coating technique is playing an 
increasingly more important role in environmental and medical 
technology in particular. There is a large number of possible 
coatings that endow the underlying materials with new 
properties. Laser measurement techniques have also proven to be 
very well suited to the examination of optically transparent 
coatings. With them the laser light on the interface between the 
surrounding medium and the coating is in part reflected and in 
part refracted into the coating. 
  The light fractions interfere with one another, dependent on 
the changes in the optical path. He further said that, since the 
difference between the optical paths can only be vaired by a 
change in coating thickness when the material properties are 
constant, they have with this technique a sensitive in-situ 
monitor for the thickness of the coating. The resolution 
maximally amounts to somewhat more than 10 nanometers. 
  When two interferometers are combined in a dual-beam 
experiment, their beam paths form different angles with the 
surface of the coating. If the coating is thicker, there are 
different periodicities of both monitor signals. Both 
interferometers detect the difference between the optical paths 
with high local resolution at the same point on the coating. 
  A comparison of both monitor signals also further provides, 
in addition to the thickness of the coating, the refractive 
index of the coating. Furthermore, Koch explained, computer 
simulations of the signal sequences allow for conclusions as to 
absorption coefficients and the homogeneity of the coating.

<TEXT>     The problem with seeing with light is that light is kind of big. Repeat:
Light is big. It comes in waves with several hundred nanometers in between the
crests while the average atom is only about a fifth of a nanometer across. So
the atom is like a grain of sand washed to and fro in a tsunami-size surf of
light.;    That's where electron microscopes are handy. Electrons can bounce
off an object and leave an image on a piece of film. This image can show
objects only a few dozen atoms across. Why can't electron microscopes make
images of individual atoms? Because these electrons pack quite a wallop, and
when they hit one lonely atom they can easily obliterate it. Or change it
drastically.;    James Trefil, co-author of the new book Science Matters:
Achieving Scientific Literacy, told us, "It's like you have a long dark
tunnel, and you want to see if there's a car down at the end of it, and the
only way you can find out is by sending another car down the tunnel and
listening for a crash.";    In the past decade, a new device, the
scanning-probe or scanning-tunneling microscope, has made it possible to make
images of atoms themselves. The tip of a teensy wire floats over the even
smaller object and picks up the electrical charge at its surface. When the
probe is directly above an atom, the current is stronger, and when it is to
the side or between two atoms, the current is weaker. From this it is possible
to make an image showing the contour of the object.;  GUESS AGAIN; JODIE

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] Mitsubishi Electric has developed short-wavelength, 
high-output oscillation technology using a solid-state YAG 
laser. It was difficult to obtain the high-output 
short-wavelength laser light because the wavelength conversion 
element, which transforms the YAG laser light (infrared light) 
into short-wavelength light, tends to cause crystal destruction. 
The company avoided crystal destruction by bringing about a 
``gentle frequency conversion.'' It achieved this by lengthening 
the frequency conversion element and increasing the optical beam 
size of the YAG laser by an order of millimeters 10 times that 
of conventional types. Using this technology, Mitsubishi 
achieved the oscillation of 24 watt green laser light. 
Furthermore, it is said that not only green laser light but also 
blue laser light and other high output oscillations are possible. 
  The solid state laser which oscillates short-wavelength 
laser 
light consists of an excitation light source, a YAG laser (a 
yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser doped with niobium), a nonlinear 
optical material which is the wavelength conversion element, and 
other components. The excited YAG laser emits 1064 nanometer 
infrared light which, after passing through the wavelength 
conversion element, oscillates green, blue and other 
short-wavelength light. However, the wavelength conversion 
element crystal was too brittle to withstand the strong infrared 
light. 
  The company enlarged the spot size of the infrared light 
entering the wavelength conversion element by an order of 
millimeters for the purpose of dispersing the energy and, at the 
same time, it lengthened the wavelength conversion element. 
Several crystals were connected together because the maximum 
size for the wavelength conversion element crystal is 10 
millimeters. The optimal phase matching of their adjoining parts 
has been designed in order to minimize conversion loss. 
Accordingly, even when high output infrared radiation enters, 
the destruction of the wavelength conversion element crystal 
does not occur. 
  Employing this technology, and using a KTP (potassium 
titanate phosphate) wavelength conversion element which halves 
the wavelength, a 24 watt (electric power input 4.9 kilowatts) 
green laser light (532 nanometer wavelength) generation was 
attained. This is double the output achieved up until the 
present time and it is said that it is possible to have an 
output of more than 100 watts. Moreover, this technology can be 
applied to other wave conversion elements, such as 
KNb&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt;  (potassium niobium&lt;inf&gt; 3&lt;/inf&gt; ) which converts 
the wavelength to one third -- a blue wavelength.

  [Text] Sony (Norio Oga, Chairman) succeeded in developing 
the world's first continuous wave oscillation [CW] room 
temperature blue semiconductor laser. The Sony research group 
announced this result at the commencement of a meeting of the 
Applied Physics Society on 28 March at Meiji University in 
Tama-ku, Kawasaki. According to the announcement, Sony succeeded 
in the continuous oscillation of a 489.9 nanometer blue (range) 
laser at a room temperature of 23ÎC. The development of a 
blue (bandwidth) laser was the main goal because blue was the 
only one of the three primary colors--red, green, and blue--that 
remained [to be achieved in a room temperature CW semiconductor 
laser]. Up until now, this laser was the target in a fierce 
development contest carried on primarily between the United 
States and Japan but, with this achievement, Sony has charged 
ahead to take the lead. When the laser is put to practical use 
[commercialized] it can be expected that there will be a 
widespread sphere of applications, including high-capacity 
optical recording equipment, high-performance color printers, 
full-color three- dimensional displays, etc. 
  For semiconductor lasers, room temperature continuous 
oscillation is only the first step toward practical application. 
It has always been the plaintive wish to achieve blue (range) 
room temperature oscillation ever since the 1970s when, using a 
double-hetero structure, the first room temperature CW 
semiconductor laser was achieved. 
  This time, Sony used a II-VI group 
zinc-magnesium-sulfur-selenium quaternary compound as a cladding 
layer to confine the light and, by exerting their ingenuity, the 
Sony researchers succeeded in the lowering of the resistance. 
The threshold current value obtained during room temperature 
continuous oscillation was 93 milliamperes at 6.3 volts. Ever 
since the 3-M company in the United States used a II-VI group 
compound not including magnesium to achieve room temperature 
pulsed oscillation with a 525 nanometer blue-green color, the 
II-VI group suddenly was in the limelight and research 
organizations of the world became engaged in fierce competition 
for development. By including magnesium in the quaternary 
compound in independent research, Sony reported room temperature 
pulsed oscillation of a blue laser in May 1993 and room 
temperature continuous oscillation of a blue-green laser in July 
1993, thereby reversing the leading role in this field. 
  When it is put to practical use [commercialized], the blue 
semiconductor laser, because of its short wavelength 
characteristic, will lead to the realization of a drastic 
advancement in optical recording density as well as medical 
uses, metrology, full-color three-dimensional displays, etc.

<F P=106> [Article: "Major Opportunities for Tiny Structures"; </F>
Subhead: "Micro- and Nano-Structure Engineering: Fantastic 
Innovations on Prototype Scale"] 
  [Text] Mainz, 8 April 1994--Micro- and nano-structure 
engineering is calling attention to itself with fantastic 
innovations on the prototype scale that will in fact decisively 
alter our technical environment and even the quality of our 
lives in a few years. New growth markets are beginning to 
develop for micro-structure products and industrial nations are 
preparing for a new technology race with support programs 
measuring in the billions. In the following article, professor 
Wolfgang Ehrfeld of the Institute for Microengineering [IMM] in 
Freiburg, describes the current situation. 
  Critical functional elements of modern engineering are 
growing increasingly smaller, attaining molecular dimensions, 
and at present it is even possible to manipulate individual 
atoms. Concurrently, the level of integration is increasing. In 
microprocessors and memory chips many millions of transistors 
are combined on a single tiny silicon chip and the 
billion-threshold, the gigabit chip, no longer appears to be so 
far removed. Together, miniaturization and integration are the 
engine for engineering progress. Micro- and nano-structure 
engineering is becoming the basis of our future security. 
  Internationally, microsystems that combine micromechanical, 
microoptical, microacoustic, microthermal and other 
microfucntional elements with microelectronics, constitute the 
technological basis for modern products. There are markets for 
microstructural products everywhere: automation, information and 
communications engineering, automotive engineering, aerospace, 
chemical process engineering and entertainment electronics 
deserve mention here along with medicine and bioengineering. 
  Research is still unambiguously uppermost in the case of 
nanostructures, thinking here of molecular storage devices or 
so-called "quantum devices." When considering films of a few 
layers of molecules or atoms, however, that are decisive for the 
operations of many chemical and biological sensors, for 
optoelectronic components or for diverse, technically relevant 
interface phenomena, then nanoengineering -- quite apart from 
the scanning tunnel microscope and its various derivatives -- is 
already a significant economic factor. 
  The technological basis for the manufacture of 
microstructural products developed from semiconductor 
engineering, precision mechanics and optics. It is possible to 
produce high-precision three dimensional microstructures using 
anisotropic etching of single-crystal materials, dry etching 
processes with low-pressure plasmas, with electron, ion and 
laser beams or using depth lithography with x-ray beams. It is 
possible, using casting, stamping, electroplating or other 
shaping processes, to replicate such microstructures, if 
necessary, with nanometer precision, over and over again and to 
transfer them into other materials. 
  The compact disk [CD] is an example of the success of this 
type of replication design, wherein semiconductor 
microlithography, thin-film engineering and ultra-precision 
injection molding are in synergy. Using lithography, 
electroforming, casting [LIGA] engineering, developed in 
Germany, based on a combination of depth lithography, 
electroforming and shaping, the two-dimensional CD replication 
process is extended into the third dimension of microstructure 
engineering and an inconceivably broad diversity of products is 
developed, as demonstrated by the IMM in Mainz at the research 
and technology innovation market of the Hannover fair on the 
basis of microsensors, micromotors, microoptical systems, etc. 
  The extensive menu of microsystems engineering is 
exemplified 
through many other examples: Friedrich-Schiller university in 
Jena is displaying as a microsystem optical chips for laser 
doppler anemometry and magnetic sensors based on squids for 
accurate administration of ion rays in tumor therapy; 
Hamburg-Harburg technological university [TU] is presenting 
chemical gas sensors; and Bayreuth university is displaying the 
effectiveness of nanotechnology by means of materials research 
using combined scanning power and friction microscopy. 
  Absent materials research, micro- and nano-structure 
engineering are inconceivable and in this case the innovation 
market demonstrates many new approaches. We may mention here: 
Mossbauer spectroscopy (Goettingen university); the use of RFQ 
accelerators (Framkfurt university); high-resolution computer 
tomography (federal department for materials research); 
time-resolution materials research using the emissions electron 
microscope (Mainz university); analysis of extremely thin films 
using the Brewster angle microscope (Goettingen NFT GmbH) and 
differential reflectometry (Vilseck ATZ. 
  To be sure, this is only a tiny portion of the broad 
technological basis for micro- and nano-structure engineering. 
But it is one approach to engineering progress in products, 
materials, testing processes, production engineering and 
applications in virtually all sectors of modern engineering. 
  Already in existence today as prototypes on the laboratory 
scale are: chemical analysis systems that are no larger than a 
sugar cube; micromotors that have been engineered together with 
ultrasound sensors and micromechanical instruments for vascular 
and neurosurgery in catheter systems having a one to two 
millimeter diameter; microsensor rays for the most diverse 
measurable quantities; and a multitude of micromechanical, 
microoptical or fluid engineering components. Using modern 
production methods of microengineering it is possible to produce 
various inexpensive connections for monomode glass fibers for 
optical data transfer with submicrometer precision and 
integrated switch or multiplex functions as well and photonics 
microcomponents are being developed for optical computers. 
  As fantastic as such applications may seem at present, it is 
also equally certain that in the foreseeable future our daily 
lives will be inconceivable without them. Still, microsystems 
for medicine, the new energy-saving injection system, that can 
be realized only with microengineering methods, the microsensors 
in tennis rackets or in the safety bindings of skis and many 
other micro-, and in the future, nano-structure products, can be 
produced inexpensively only if there are professional production 
equipment, product-specific materials, semi-finished products 
and fabricated products, design tools and a plethora of services 
in the hardware and software sectors and, of course, also in 
marketing and sales. 
  The federal ministry for research and technology has already 
allocated 400 million German marks [DM] for the support of 
microengineering and another 600 million is supposed to be 
forthcoming in the follow-on program, as the minister for 
research reported in February. Combined projects, in which a 
number of firms and research facilities are each participating, 
are foremost in this context and are supposed to accelerate 
progress through cooperation and a division of labor. 
  Compared to the outlays by other industrial nations or the 
total amount that the European Union [EU] plans to allocate to 
microsystems engineering in the fourth framework program, a 
support volume of a total DM1 billion is very significant. But 
even in the U.S. and the Far East, the key function of micro- 
and nano-structure engineering has been acknowledged for a long 
time and they have developed their own strategies for success. 
It is not just the amount of the support total, but rather the 
strategic approach that is decisive in a broad spectrum 
technology in which producers of microstructural products have 
to cooperate closely with their users as well as suppliers of 
production equipment, materials manufacturers and special 
services firms. 
  In microengineering, both Japan as well as the U.S. have 
demonstrated that they have better concepts of cooperation and 
innovation than Germany or Europe. Still, international 
technological competition in micro- and nano-structure 
engineering has just begun. A visit to the research and 
technology innovation market and an exchange of ideas with the 
exhibitors may contribute to progress through cooperation in a 
key technology.

replacing conventional semiconductor lasers, Toshiba said in
Tokyo.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The new device emits a laser with a maximum optical output
power of 106 milliwatts, or mW, at a wavelength of 690
nanometers, or nm. Conventional devices, used as light
sources to read and write data for storage products such as
electronic document filing systems and CD-ROMs, emit an
invisible laser beam with 30mW of output power and an 830nm
wavelength.
   Toshiba said demand is increasing for devices with higher
output power and a shorter wavelength in order to store data
at a higher density and read the data more accurately. The
higher the density becomes, the more power is required for
writing and reading data.

<F P=106> [Article by Arno Noeldechen: "Hoechst AG Is Gambling on </F>
Process Engineering and Chemical Research Projects With 
Fullerenes; Hopes for a Future Market, but Up to Now Still No 
Commercial Applications Feasible; Cooperation With University 
Research Laboratories"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt--According to Utz-Hellmuth Felcht, a 
member of the board of directors of Hoechst, Inc., who is in 
charge of research, economic successes, or even breaking even on 
costs, is not the goal of the company's current activities in 
this field of research. But now, in a generally poor economic 
situation, the chemical company is making an effort to learn to 
understand a very promising, potential material of the future in 
terms of its reactions and to keep in mind applications of it 
that will prove interesting for the company in the long run. 
  The company at present produces worldwide fullerene C-60 and 
C-70 in lots of several kilograms for many universities and 
industrial research laboratories. In so doing, the process that 
Wolfgang Kraetschmer and Donald R. Huffman developed in 1990, 
with graphite electrodes in an arc light, is used. 
  The company generally asks for a "cost contribution" for 
very 
pure fullerene (99.4 percent pure) of $135 per gram; the 
contribution for larger quantities is negotiated or they are 
given away if a financially badly off university laboratory 
decides to collaborate with the company. The current production 
of fullerenes is certainly not yet a cost-effective business. In 
this way, Hoechst wants to ensure the later commercial 
evaluation of the possibly useful results of its research. 
Twenty university teams are at present collaborating with 
Hoechst in Germany, as the company recently let us know. 
  Comparable collaboration between universities and industry 
is 
rare in this country. But chemists do not find it so difficult, 
since they themselves are scarcely in a position to make use of 
their inventions and discoveries under their own control. The 
chemical company had no difficulty in incorporating test lot 
production into its Knappsack plant as early as in 1992 with a 
converted plasma unit. Since then, it has developed an improved 
separation process that should be ready for patenting, the 
capacity of which in continuous operation is close to the limit 
of the currently required amounts of fullerene. 
  Fullerenes are completely new materials with properties that 
neither graphite nor diamonds, as pure modifications of carbon, 
exhibit. Moreover, the ball-shaped fullerene molecules are 
extremely stable from the kinetic point of view, but then again 
very unstable in thermodynamic terms. And because of their 
thermodynamic behavior, they can be readily transformed into new 
kinds of compounds. 
  As explained by Swiss Prof. Francois Diederich of the Swiss 
Technical College in Zurich, because of their hollow, 
ball-shaped structure, fullerenes can be modified in four 
different ways, all of which they have already been able to 
verify with experiments. In the process, the inclusion of 
molecules in the cavity itself did not prove to be very 
effective since they are hardly ever released again. 
  The cage-like structure on the existing double bonds of the 
carbon atoms can be forced open and then many other molecules 
can be incorporated into and added onto it. Individual carbon 
atoms can also be successfully replaced with other atoms, boron, 
for example. As a fourth possibility, new atoms can be packed in 
between the cavities of the fullerene balls, which are only a 
few nanometers in size, and new kinds of crystalline compounds 
obtained. Scientists are today already speaking of a "fullerene 
chemistry," with which dozens of possible applications are 
heralded in at least the fields of electronics, chemistry 
itself, and new materials. 
  Because of their physical properties, chemically altered 
fullerenes can lead to new kinds of semiconductors in molecular 
or nanoelectronics. Because of their electrical and nonlinear 
optical properties, photoconductors and utilization of their 
optical-electrical behavior are conceivable. Fullerenes are 
genuine electron conductors that, unlike other organic 
molecules, transmit charges via defective electrons, so-called 
electron holes. That is why they are regarded as electrolyte and 
electrode materials for lightweight accumulators and batteries. 
Light activates fullerenes and the electron conduction leads to 
a useful electroluminescence. They are also studying their 
superconducting properties. But the results of this research are 
not yet far enough advanced to arouse hopes for a new class of 
high-temperature superconductors. 
  In the field of chemisty fullerenes can be readily altered 
to 
become catalysts. Because of their molecular size, which is 
equivalent to that of anthracene molecules and is in the 
nanometer range, luminous new colors for printing or 
photocopying technology are especially conceivable. 
  Up to now several pharmacological effects of fullerenes have 
been noted. With attached active groups, they can also be used 
for new medicines on the molecular biological scale or only as 
carrier molecules for radio isotopes or other active substances. 
  Encapsulated, in the form of so-called nanocapsules, they 
appear to be less well-suited to this because their molecular 
structure is probably too stable, which is why the encapsulated 
active substances are hardly released again. But precisely 
because of this, they are well-suited to the production of new 
kinds of contrast agents for X-ray diagnosis or tomographic 
display procedures. Antiviral and antibacterial action, which 
can, morever, be controlled by light induction, opens up new 
ways of creating antibiotics. Fullerenes or their crystal 
compounds, fullerides, with metals or other elements, will 
probably not appear on the market so quickly as new kinds of 
active substances since they would have to be produced cheaply 
in large quantities for that purpose. And that has not yet 
become apparent for the moment. 
  Some of the application possibilities fall within Hoechst's 
own production categories and will possibly open up new fields 
of operation for the company, in pharmaceuticals or antibiotics. 
Hoechst, which with sales volumes of more than DM8 million 
(first half of 1993: DM4.523 million) occupies a leading 
position in the world market for pharmaceuticals, is on the 
lookout for new pharmacological substances. 
  To be sure, Hoechst today already supplies high-temperature 
superconductors for research and industry but, if it is 
demonstrated that fullerenes can be produced more cheaply and 
can retain their superconducting state under the influence of 
magnetic fields as well--as scientists think they will on the 
basis of the initial experiments--market opportunities clearly 
exist in this field. 
  Because of the wealth of possible applications, it is still 
too early to determine which fullerene compounds they will 
actually be able to market as well in 10 or more years time. But 
the company does have good prospects of becoming a leading 
supplier.

  [Text] For a long time the view that it is not possible to 
produce silicon-based optoelectronic devices was regarded as 
sacred lore. Unlike gallium arsenide, silicon does not 
luminesce when excited optically by electric current. This 
would now appear possible. 
  Scientists at the Juelich Research Center's Institute of 
Coating and Ion Technology have accomplished a major step in 
this direction. For the first time, porous silicon layers have 
been used to fabricate complex superlattice structures of a kind 
particularly suitable for filters or semireflecting mirrors in 
combination with a light-emitting porous silicon coating. 
  Porous silicon, which is produced in an electrochemical 
etching process, has a spongy structure. Although the process 
for producing porous silicon layers has been known since the 
mid-fifties, it was only three years ago, when a British 
research team observed intensive photoluminescence, that great 
interest in this material system sprang up worldwide, whereupon 
a frantic search for potential electroluminescence began, 
several teams finding it with some speed. In 
electroluminescence, electric current is used to trigger light 
emission. All optoelectronic devices, such as light-emitting 
diodes and semiconductor lasers, are based on this mechanism. 
  Since then, more than 10 different models have been 
proposed, 
some based on the assumption that complex silicon-oxygen and 
silicon-hydrogen molecules exist. However, the Juelich Research 
Center, using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, performed a 
chemical analysis on freshly prepared porous layers detecting no 
sign of oxygen, and this finding is confirmed by infrared 
studies conducted jointly with the Physics Institute at the 
Rhine-Westphalian College of Technology in Aachen. Trials known 
as inelastic light scattering experiments performed in Juelich 
clearly confirmed that nanocrystallites are present in the 
porous layers. It is even possible to establish frequency 
distribution functions for the nanocrystallite diameters in the 
light of these results. A comparison of recorded 
photoluminescence spectra with the distribution functions has 
for the first time correlated the intensity of the 
photoluminescence with the number of nanocrystallites having a 
diameter of about 2.5 nanometers. These findings, which have 
been confirmed by other research teams, have demonstrated that 
the luminescence is definitely caused by the silicon 
nanocrystallites present in the porous layers. 
  Porous silicon normally emits light in photo- and 
electroluminescence over a broad spectrum comprising many colors 
in the visible range, although the user would obviously prefer 
to have more sharply defined light emission that could also be 
modified. The scientists at Juelich have now presented a 
completely new concept that uses what are known as porosity 
superlattices as filters. These porosity superlattices consist 
of a periodic sequence of layers of differing porosity. By 
selecting them according to the right parameters -- the 
thicknesses of the single layers ranged from 10 to 500 
nanometers (nm) with porosities up to and exceeding 83 percent 
-- they were able to produce narrow-band filters and, for 
example, use them to reduce the breadth of the photoluminescence 
band by a factor of more than 10. 
  These porosity superlattices also present an extremely high 
reflection factor of up to 95 percent in the visible spectral 
region, where only about 30 percent is observed with normal 
silicon layers. Porosity superlattices can be produced in the 
same process step as the active electroluminescence layer. 
Initial trials show, moreover, that porosity superlattices with 
lateral structures measuring about 150 micrometers can be 
produced. This is more or less the pixel (picture element) size 
of a flat video screen. In view of its extremely high 
light-emitting efficiency, porous silicon is currently applied 
on top of other, for instance silicon layer system, coatings. 
The application potential of porous silicon is enormous, far 
greater than can be fully appreciated at the present time.

   Chill Descends
   On High-Tech
   Exports to East

   LONDON -- A slight chill has returned to East-West
technology trade, slowing the Western drive toward
liberalization that began after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
   In closed-door meetings this month in Paris,
representatives of the U.S. and 16 allies are writing new
rules governing which computers, telephone exchanges and
other high-technology products can be shipped eastward. The
result, expected at the end of the month, "will be a further
liberalization, but nothing nearly as extensive" as people in
Western industry had expected, says Eric Hirschhorn, an
official of a high-tech industry lobbying group in
Washington.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   A senior German government official in Bonn agrees: "We
really don't feel that we will succeed now in fulfilling the
very ambitious targets" for trade liberalization that many
Western governments had set for themselves last summer.
   Several factors are behind the chill. One is the turmoil
in the Soviet Union's Baltic republics that's giving greater
weight to U.S. conservatives' arguments that the West
shouldn't reward the Soviets with greater trade privileges
now. Also, there's continuing concern, chiefly among U.S. and
British electronic spy agencies, that the West may have
already moved too far toward authorizing some exports.
   At a Paris meeting last June, the U.S. and its allies,
flushed with euphoria from the Cold War's end, agreed on
sweeping measures to liberalize exports in several categories
of high-tech gear. Western businesses were allowed to export
to the East most personal computer models and many types of
machine tools and telephone exchanges, including
high-performance, fiber-optic communications equipment.
   But in Paris this month, European government and industry
officials say, the U.S., Britain, Australia and Canada have
teamed up to urge a freeze -- and on one product, a rollback
-- in liberalization in communications. Arguing for greater
liberalization are Germany, Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Spain
and the Netherlands.
   For 42 years, the U.S. and its main allies have regulated
the flow of technology to the East to protect Western
security. Operating from Paris, the Coordinating Committee
for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, sets guidelines.
Each Cocom-member government then incorporates the guidelines
in its national export laws or regulations.
   At this month's meeting in Paris, an added measure of
liberalization is expected to be authorized by Cocom
officials. Among other things, says one U.S. official
scheduled to attend the talks, export controls will likely be
ended for all PC models, including the most advanced
generation using Intel Corp.'s i486 chips. Also, the group
will likely pare down its detailed, 118-item list of
controlled goods to eight broad categories of embargoed
products.
   But what disappoints many Western exporters is what they
probably won't get from the meeting, especially in
telecommunications. Big-business groups in Germany, Britain,
France, Japan, the U.S. and some other Cocom countries plan
soon to issue a joint statement protesting what they see as a
slowdown in liberalization.
   U.S. officials acknowledge they are disputing with some
allies how much further liberalization should go. Among the
most controversial issues are specialized lasers used as
transmitters in fiber-optic telecommunications cables. The
U.S., Britain, Canada and Australia want to roll back last
year's agreement liberalizing exports of lasers that emit
light at wavelengths of as much as 1,370 nanometers.
Communications lasers now being installed in the West
typically operate at wavelengths of as much as 1,550
nanometers, and consequently transmit far more telephone
calls and data over a single optical cable.
   Although an arcane issue, it epitomizes this month's Cocom
debates in Paris. Arguing for liberalization, Christopher
Padilla, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Corp.'s
government-affairs manager in Washington, says the disputed
lasers "aren't state-of-the-art and are used in basic
civilian communications" in the West, posing little security
risk if exported.
   But U.S. and British officials, in particular, worry that
allowing the installation of such high-performance
fiber-optic networks would make it harder for them to
eavesdrop on Soviet communications.

  [Text] Tokyo, Jan. 12 KYODO -- Mitsubishi Electric Corp. 
has developed a method to create an extremly thin film of 
single-crystal fullerene (C60) that can be vapor-deposited on 
base materials for possible practical use in semiconductors, a 
company spokesman said Wednesday [12 January]. 
  He said that only much smaller crystals for scientific 
experiments have so far been made. 
  He said the 1 square-centimeter, single-crystal 15 
nanometer-thin (one nanometer equals one-billionth of a meter) 
film, made by using the so-called ionized cluster beam (icb) 
method, is highly resistant to heat and radioactivity and has 
the potential for integration. 
  Details of the discovery will be announced at an academic 
meeting on fullerene to be held Thursday in Tokyo. 
  Mitsubishi Electric found in early 1992 that the next 
generation of carbon materials could be used for semiconductors. 
  The spokesman said the company will now try to develop a 
transistor device using the fullerene thin film. 
  Analysts say the material may also be applied to optical 
materials and catalysts, he said.

   Scientists at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s Bell
Laboratories said they have developed the world's smallest
semiconductor lasers.
   AT&amp;T said the lasers are so tiny (about five microns in
diameter) that at least 10,000 would fit on the head of a
pin. AT&amp;T and its rivals have been racing to boost
transmission power of fiber-optic communications equipment
and to miniaturize devices that comprise such gear to reduce
cost and make them easier to service.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "This is a very novel semiconductor laser structure," said
Erich Ippen, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology
professor who specializes in lasers and optics. "The use of
high-density microscopic lasers as interconnects is
potentially quite important" for linking information systems
in the future, he said.
   AT&amp;T is looking at using "these beautiful little
structures" as communications devices for optical switches
and connectors for linking computers and the devices within
them, said Richart Slusher, chief of Bell Labs' Optical
Physics Research department, Murray Hill, N.J. However, AT&amp;T
scientists must first show that the new devices can be made
as inexpensively as current electrical connectors and that
they are compatible with silicon-based electronic equipment,
he added.
   Pictures supplied by AT&amp;T show the microscopic devices,
dubbed "microdisk lasers," look like thumbtacks when viewed
through a scanning electron microscope. The head of each one
of these "tacks" is 400 atoms thick, or one-thousandth the
diameter of a human hair. Dr. Slusher said the devices are
Bell Labs' "biggest breakthrough" since so-called
surface-emitting lasers were developed about three years ago.
Such lasers use two microscopic mirrors to concentrate a
light beam on the laser chip's interior surface before
shooting the beam in the form of a cone.
   The new lasers were designed by Bell Labs' researcher Sam
McCall to operate in the so-called "whispering gallery" mode,
named for the sound effect associated with St. Paul's
Cathedral in London, where a person can whisper and be heard
clearly along the wall of the dome. In a similar fashion, Dr.
McCall's lasers are said to shoot their light pulses or
photons along the edge of the disk-shaped laser, or the path
of least resistance, AT&amp;T said.
   Each laser, which is crafted of indium gallium arsenide
"sandwiched" between indium gallium arsenide phosphide, took
about nine months to develop, said Dr. Slusher, who noted
that Dr. McCall worked on the team that developed AT&amp;T's
surface-emitting devices.

  [Text] The Semiconductor Technology Center of Matsushita 
Electric Industrial Co., Ltd. developed the world's first 
surface-emission laser optoelectronic integrated circuit (OEIC) 
which can operate 10 times as fast as a conventional matrix-type 
surface-emission laser. The center designed a unique system in 
which transistors are mounted on lasers (transistor-on-laser) 
and lined up 64 lasers in an array-formation in a cell that is a 
480 micron square. Each laser has a built-in transistor as its 
driver. As a result, this accomplishment makes 10 gigahertz 
high-speed operations functionally possible and it will open up 
the way to the attainment of optical computers and optical 
switchboards. 
  Innovations in the CPU [Central Processing Unit] and such 
have advanced the speed of computers. However, transmission 
delays become a problem when there is an interchange among them 
on networks. It has been pointed out that there are limits to 
the present method used to amplify the signal by converting 
optical communications into electricity. 
  Therefore, there is a strong need for optical switches and 
such which will make ultra high speed circuitry possible for the 
switching of optical signals, without conversion, between 
optical fibers. The surface-emission laser is expected to be one 
of the basic technologies to make this possible. 
  Although a chip has been developed which has integrated over 
a thousand elements in the surface-emission laser, the 
conventional product uses a matrix form of circuitry which needs 
a large electric current to change the frequency of the laser. 
Moreover, the circuit distance from the driver transistor is so 
great that it makes high-speed operations difficult. 
  In this instance, the device developed by Matsushita 
Electric 
has 64 0.98 nanometer wavelength surface-emission lasers each 
integrated with a driver transistor. This structure uses a 
unique method of putting the transistor on top of the laser. By 
doing this, Matsushita made it possible to increase the 
high-speed operations to more than 10 times that of the 
matrix-type and also made it possible to increase the density 
and reduce the area to one third of the latter type. A special 
quality is that it is feasible to increase the speed up of 10 
gigahertz and it is expected that this development will 
drastically promote the utilization of optical computers and 
optical switches.

<LEADPARA>  SCIENTISTS are beginning to gain the ability to manipulate matter by its most
basic components -- molecule by molecule and even atom by atom.;   That
ability, while now very crude, might one day allow people to build almost
unimaginably small electronic circuits and machines, producing, for example, a
supercomputer invisible to the naked eye.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Some futurists even imagine building tiny robots that could travel through
the body performing surgery on damaged cells.;   Such molecular-level
computers and robots are decades away and might never be practical. Even so,
molecular manufacturing promises to lead to great advances in electronic
devices, new materials of all sorts and the understanding of nature.;   "The
ability to manipulate and to observe and measure things on that scale is
tremendously exciting," said Dr. John Armstrong, chief scientist at the
International Business Machines Corp. "We will have the ability to make
electronic and mechanical devices atom by atom," he said, emphasizing his
belief that only critical parts of circuits, not entire computers, could be
built this way because of the complexity involved.;   IBM, in fact, became one
of the first companies to demonstrate precise control over atoms last year
when it positioned 35 atoms of the element xenon to spell out its corporate
logo.;   The emerging field, which draws on advances in physics, chemistry, 
biology and computer science, is called nanotechnology because the structures
being built would be measured in nanometers, or billionths of a meter. A
nanometer is about the size of three atoms.;   Today's finest microelectronic
circuits have features about one micron wide, or a millionth of a meter.
That's about 1 percent of the diameter of a human hair.;   Researchers in a
field known as micromechanics have built gears, motors and other mechanical
devices that are measured in the tens or hundreds of microns and are so small
they can be accidentally inhaled. But nanometer-scale devices would be smaller
still, one-thousandth their size.;   Today's microelectronic circuits rely on
billions of electrons flowing from place to place. A nanotechnology circuit,
by contrast, might differentiate between a zero and a one by a single molecule
changing its position or its shape.;   Today's chemistry is done, essentially,
by putting the ingredients in a test tube or vat, heating and shaking, and
relying on the random motion of atoms to form the desired compounds.;   "It's
like trying to assemble a radio by putting the components in a bag and
shaking," said Dr. Ralph Merkle, a scientist at the Xerox Palo Alto Research
Center who is working on nanotechnology.;   It works well for simple
compounds, he said, but it would be hard to imagine ever building a
molecular-sized robot this way.;   So some scientists believe the true
revolution will come by precisely snapping atoms and molecules into place,
sort of a miniature version of the way radios and other products are built.
This idea is called molecular nanotechnology or molecular manufacturing.;  
"Nanotechnology is a very fancy buzzword for the chemistry of the next
century," said Dr. Nadrian Seeman, a professor of chemistry at New York
University. "To a certain extent, we're going to emulate the way things are
done in cells.";   Until now, nanotechnology, particularly molecular
nanotechnology, has been less a science than the vision of one man, Dr. K.
Eric Drexler, a 36-year-old visiting scholar at Stanford University.;  
Drexler, who fashioned his own Ph.D. program in nanotechnology at MIT, has
outlined his ideas in two books, "Engines of Creation" (Anchor
Press/Doubleday) in 1986 and this year's "Unbounding the Future" (William
Morrow &amp; Co.), written with Chris Peterson and Gayle Pergamit.;   Drexler and
Peterson, his wife, formed the Foresight Institute, a non-profit organization
in Palo Alto, which sponsored a nanotechnology conference here this month that
drew about 150 researchers.;   Drexler predicts that tiny machines controlled
by nanocomputers and powered by nanomotors will one day swim through the blood
vessels fighting viruses, or grab chlorine atoms out of the sky to protect the
ozone layer.  </TEXT>

  [Text] Pulsed laser beams can be used in many ways for 
material processing. The effects on the material induced by a 
laser pulse are produced in a very short period of time and in 
small areas. Exact knowledge about these effects is important 
for optimal laser utilization. However, there are two goals in 
observation. First, the observation procedure must possess high 
magnification. It should also possess high temporal resolution 
in order to be able to represent the effects of individual laser 
pulses. Professor Oleg Bostanjoglo and his colleagues from the 
Optical Institute of the Berlin Technical University (Strasse 
des 17. Juni 135, 10623 Berlin) have now developed a high-speed 
electron microscope (EM) linked with a pulsed laser which 
possesses the necessary properties. The device makes it possible 
to depict precisely laser-induced crystallization and 
vaporization processes. According to Bostanjoglo, large effects 
can be produced in small target areas by irradiating material 
with pulsed lasers. The high heating and cooling rates lead to 
the formation of new phases and structures in the irradiated 
materials which are not attainable using other methods. The 
technical utilization of the laser is only in its infancy, but 
has already led to important applications. These include the 
boring of very small holes, the labeling of components, the 
hardening of metal surfaces and employment in digital optical 
read/write memory. Until now the electron microscope has been of 
only limited use in the investigation of microscopic effects, 
since while it is sensitive to structure and possesses high 
resolution spatially, in conventional use it possesses only low 
temporal resolution. The Berlin scientists have thus converted a 
commercial electron microscope into a high-speed apparatus.In 
principle, rapid-exposure photographs can be made in two ways. 
In continuous operation the sample is constantly irradiated by 
the electron beam, that is both during and after the laser 
bombardment. With the help of a 
scintillator-storage-oscilloscope combination as a detector the 
individual phases can then be observed with high temporal 
resolution. The second possibility is that of producing 
rapid-exposurejphotographs of laser processing with the help of 
an image enhancer. These photographs are produced by pulses 
either from the source of illumination or from the image 
enhancer.In order to investigate the direct effect of the laser 
beam on the sample, a Nd:YAG laser is combined with the 
high-speed EM. The laser*beam pulse is focused on the sample in 
the EM by a laser objective and a deflecting mirror which has a 
hole for the electron beam. The laser beam and the electron beam 
run in parallel in the same direction and thus make it possible 
to investigate the laser effects in real time in a controlled 
way. The Berlin high-speed electron microscope makes it possible 
to take rapid-exposure photographs with illumination times from 
five nanoseconds. The interval between pictures is between 30 
nanoseconds and a few microseconds. Both reflective EM 
investigations of massive materials and transmission EM 
observations of thin layers can be carried out. The individual 
pictures can be combined into a "film" in order to observe the 
dynamics of laser-induced material transformation. 
Investigations with the high-speed EM have thus far been 
directed towards research on crystallization processes in 
semiconductors, structural changes in metals during laser 
processing, and laser-induced vaporization of thin layers. These 
researchers aim to achieve a better understanding of laser 
processing procedures like removal, alloyage, recrystallization, 
grain formation and vitrification. The projects are being 
supported by the German Research Association.

   Researchers at International Business Machines Corp. have
plucked individual silicon atoms from a surface and placed
them in precise locations, raising the possibility of
electronic devices that could be built an atom at a time.
   The feat, reported in today's issue of Science, a weekly
journal, follows a demonstration last year in which IBM
scientists pulled individual atoms of xenon gas around to
form patterns, such as the company's famous logo, on a metal
surface.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While both demonstrations used the same tool, an
IBM-invented microscope, to manipulate atoms in precise ways,
IBM said the new silicon technique was particularly relevant
to its dream of building electronic circuits with parts that
measure only one atom or one molecule across.
   By comparison, the circuitry in today's top-performance
computer chips is measured in microns, or millionths of a
meter -- at least 1,000 times coarser than atomic-scale
devices, which would be measured in nanometers, or billionths
of a meter. In theory, smaller circuitry permits faster, less
expensive and more complex computing.
   A scientist at American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s Bell
Laboratories cautioned, however, that such advances remain
far in the future. "This is a fine piece of work, but it's
just one step further along the road," said researcher
Russell Becker, who has demonstrated a similar but
less-reliable technique with germanium atoms. "No one should
think that they'll be making {electronic devices} this way
next year."
   Indeed, much remains to be figured out, including
mass-production techniques and even the form of the miniature
parts themselves. At such tiny scales, electric particles
obey the esoteric rules of quantum physics, meaning that
conventional transistors can't easily be used. Instead,
scientists are noodling around with different types of new
devices, which go by names such as quantum wells and quantum
dots.
   In addition to electronic applications, IBM said its new
method could point the way toward modifying existing
molecules by shunting their component atoms around, or even
make it possible to build customized molecules, atom by atom.
Since the method isn't limited to silicon, these capabilities
might be useful in pharmaceutical and genetics research,
which currently use different ways to customize molecules.
   IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., said its latest demonstration
was important because it showed that the so-called scanning
tunneling microscope, or STM, can be used to break atoms free
of strong chemical bonds to other atoms -- not just to pull
around atoms of "noble" elements such as xenon, which
interact very weakly with their surroundings.
   The STM, for whose invention two IBM scientists shared a
Nobel Prize in 1987, is normally used in physics and
materials laboratories to produce images of individual atoms
and molecules. The microscope has a very slender tungsten tip
that, when energized by a tiny electric current, can trace
the atomic surface contours of many materials.
   Researchers at IBM and elsewhere have recently discovered,
however, that the tip can also manipulate other atoms by
picking them up, dropping them and dragging them. In an
interview, IBM scientist Phaedron Avouris, one of the authors
of the Science report, compared the STM tip to "a primitive
robotic arm."
   In the latest experiment, a combination of electrical and
chemical forces allows the tip to wrench silicon atoms away
from their brethren on a solid surface. The tip is then
moved, and the atoms are dumped at a predetermined location.
"Since we have to yank atoms out of the solid, the amount of
control is not so high" as in the xenon experiments, conceded
Mr. Avouris, who said the entire process took only a fraction
of a second.
   On the other hand, he noted, his demonstration had
immediate relevance because it used silicon, the building
block of today's electronic devices, rather than xenon.
"Obviously, we had microelectronic applications in mind," he
said.
   The latest demonstration was done in IBM's laboratory in
Yorktown Heights, N.Y., while the earlier work with xenon was
done independently in an IBM lab in San Jose, Calif.

  [Text] A superconducting device is a device that uses 
superconductivity, in which electrical resistance is zero, and 
which is characterized by high-speed operation and small 
consumption of electric power. This project is a search for a 
three-terminal device using high-temperature superconductivity 
of oxides. The goal is to use superconductivity to realize 
transistor operations that are the foundation of electronic 
devices in use today. 
  Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corporation and Sumitomo Electric 
Industries are individually doing research on devices with 
compositions similar to field effective transistors (FET), which 
control current by voltage applied at the gates. 
  Hitachi and Toshiba are considering devices with a structure 
of a semiconductor or other normal conductor sandwiched between 
superconductors. When joined together, the surface of the normal 
conducting layer also becomes superconducting to some degree, 
and superconductive current is exuded. This is called a 
proximity effect. This effect is controlled by gate voltage or 
charge input, and switching is carried out. 
  Research is at the stage of joining superconductor and 
normal 
conductor, then doing a detailed study of the resulting 
performance. Hitachi is using a holmium-barium-copper oxide 
superconductor and a praseodymium-barium-copper oxide (PBCO) 
normal conductor, and is taking measurements at very low 
temperatures. It learned that the travel distance between the 
electron pair that carries superconducting current changes with 
voltage or temperature, and is conducting theoretical studies to 
explain this. 
  Toshiba is using yttrium-barium-copper oxide (YBCO) to 
sandwich a PBCO layer. It is measuring performance when the 
thickness of the PBCO layer is changed. It also is accumulating 
techniques for joining the layers, such as lining up crystalline 
orientation to make thin film. 
  Neither Hitachi nor Toshiba has realized operation of a 
three-terminal device. It is difficult to make high quality thin 
film from superconducting oxides, and, furthermore, fundamental 
points such as how thick the film should be to make a good 
device need to be discovered. 
  On the other hand, Sumitomo Electric Industries is not 
studying the proximity effect; it is researching a device that 
uses the superconductor itself as a channel (path for passing 
current). It is looking for optimum design conditions based on 
using YBCO for the superconductor, strontium titanic acid for 
the substrate and insulation, and gold for electrodes. 
  The three terminal device was produced experimentally, and 
experiments at extremely low temperatures confirmed that gate 
voltage transforms superconducting current. Degree of 
transformation is still too weak, but it is thought that 
improvements can be made by raising the quality of the film or 
making it thinner. 
<H5>  [5 Nov 93 p 4] </H5>
  A bipolar transistor is composed of three layers -- emitter, 
base and collector. The center part, the base, holds the key to 
performance. If resistance in this part is small, electrons flow 
rapidly and high-speed operations are possible. A team from Oki 
Electric's device technology laboratory produced an experimental 
model of a transistor using a superconductor for the base layer, 
and succeeded in amplifying current. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-JST-010LC-61A>           Superconductivity </FIG>



  On top of a crystalline substrate of strontium titanate 
(STO) 
to which 0.1% niobium had been added, a thin film of 
barium-rubidium-bismuth oxide was layered, and then covered with 
a film of indium. the STO substrate is the emitter, the BRBO is 
the base and the indium is the collector. 
  BRBO beomes superconducting at absolute temperature 28Î 
(-245ÎC), so it was cooled slightly below that, to 20Î 
(-253ÎC) and then tested for operation. The current 
amplification factor was 0.94 (the closer to 1 the better) at 
base grounding and 10 (the bigger the better) at emitter 
grounding, the first time that practical levels were achieved by 
a superconducting transistor. 
  The thickness of the base layer was under 50 nanometers (1 
nanometer is one-billionth of a meter). Although it is not easy 
to make flat thin film with oxide superconductors, this was 
achieved by free use of control technology in which the 
molecular beam epitaxy method was used to vaporize 
simultaneously four types of elements. Also, when indium was 
layered onto BRBO, a thin oxide film formed on the boundary 
surface, and it was found that this acted as a good link between 
the base layer and the collector layer. 
  measurement and evaluation of performance, such as operating 
speed and power consumption, are still to come. It is estimated 
that operating frequency of the experimental model is about 
10,000 hertz, but the goal is the high-speed operation of 1 
billion hertz. It would not be worth using superconductors if 
this performance level could not be achieved. The smaller the 
base the better for high-speed operation, and the device 
structure must be reduced from its present size of 0.5 
millimeters (mm) square to 5 microns (1 micron is .001mm) square 
in order to achieve this goal. 
  On the other hand, the Sanyo Electric Company also is doing 
research on the same type of device. The difference with the Oki 
Electric device is that a superconductor is used for the emitter 
layer as well and an insulator is set up as a barrier between 
this and the base layer to bring out sharpness. 
  A barium-potassium-bismuth oxide (BKBO) superconductor and 
gold are layered onto a substrate of STO to which neodymium has 
been added, and this is being used to confirm the basic 
operation of a three-terminal device. The important point is the 
insulation film between the BKBO and the gold. In the past, the 
oxide film which forms naturally was used, but Sanyo is trying 
to improve performance by artificially creating a thin film of 
magnesium oxide. 
<H5>  [8 Nov 93 p 5] </H5>
  Research also is proceeding on combining superconductivity 
with tunnels and other quantum effects. 
  The ``dielectric base transistor'' proposed by Fujitsu, Ltd. 
is one of those. As expressed by the name, this uses the 
superconductor STO for the base layer. The emitter and collector 
layers are YBCO superconductors. Instead of simply layering 
these three, thin interlayers made of other superconductors are 
sandwiched between the emitter and base, and the base and 
collector. 
  The purpose of adding interlayers is to create conditions 
for 
the resonant tunnel effect to occur and to bring out negative 
resistance and other special qualities. Normally, quantum 
devices have layers of compound semiconductor thin film, but in 
this case, the same kind of device will be designed with oxide 
thin film. Both the superconductor's very high-speed operation 
and low power consumption and the quantum effect's multi 
functionality are being sought, a very ambitious undertaking. 
  So far, a clear cut quantum effect has not been brought out, 
but a transistor with neodymium-gallium oxide interlayers was 
produced experimentally in FY90, and the basic operation of 
transformation of the current flowing from the emitter to the 
collector caused by the base layer's potential was confirmed at 
extremely low temperatures. 
  However, only a small current flowed between the emitter and 
the collector, even when strong voltage was applied, and the 
change in current also was slight. Of course, this is only 
natural since a dielectric, which does not pass electricity, is 
being used, but dielectric interlayers are essential in order to 
elicit the quantum effect. To solve this dilemma, the search has 
continued for materials that facilitate electron permeation and 
are compatible with YBCO. 
  Thin films of various types of oxides, such as 
lanthanum-aluminum oxide and cerium oxide, were sandwiched 
between STO and YBCO and tested for performance. It was found 
that the same voltage increased current by 2-3 digits when 
magnesium oxide was used. 
  With the latest test model, which has magnesium oxide thin 
film interlayers that are 1 nanometer thick (a billionth of a 
meter), current nearly at the practical level flowed when about 
10 volts were applied at extremely low temperatures. It has a 
long way to go when compared with a conventional transistor that 
operates with millivolt-level voltage, but it can be said that 
the shape of a usable device finally has come into view. 
  Whether the main goal of quantum effect can be elicited is a 
problem for the future. Oxides are even more difficult than 
compound semiconductors to laminate into thin film, and there is 
also little research history on this subject. The process of 
trial and error probably will continue in order to achieve the 
goal of developing a peerless new device. 
<H5>  [9 Nov 93 p 5] </H5>
  In an effort to combine superconductivity and quantum 
effect, 
the NEC basic research laboratory is proposing to make a single 
electron transistor (SET) with superconductors. 
  SET is a transistor that operates by controlling each 
electron individually. It is one of the devices of the future on 
which active research has intensified in recent years. When 
extremely tiny ``islands'' are made with semiconductors, a 
quantum effect called the coulomb blockade occurs, in which 
electrons jump individually, not in groups, from one island to 
the next. If memory or calculation functions are carried out 
with the movement of one electron, the device can be extremely 
small and consume almost no power. 
  What would be the advantage to combining this with 
superconductors? It is believed that this would improve 
operating speed, increase stability, etc., although there are no 
definite prospects for realizing these. With superconductors, 
two electrons form a pair to carry current. It would be 
extremely difficult to handle electrons individually, but a 
``single electron pair transistor,'' in which groups of electron 
pairs are controlled, may increase stability. 
  Of course, even the regular SET still is in the basic 
research stage, and it would not do to skip ahead to a 
superconducting SET. A team from NEC has made a tunnel junction 
of aluminum and alumina (aluminum oxide) and its first goal was 
to control a single electron in a normal conducting state. 
  A microstructure with 100 nanometer line width and 50 
nanometer square junction area was cooled to extremely low 
temperatures. One side was made the gate and electrons were fed 
into the electrode on the opposite side. The team was able to 
observe the change in potential that showed when each electron 
entered the electrode. In the future, the group plans to raise 
slightly the temperature at which experiments are conducted, 
make a junction with superconductors and accumulate basic data. 
  On the other hand, Mitsubishi Electric's basic semiconductor 
research laboratory is pursuing the possibility of a 
micro-vacuum tube that uses superconductivity. 
  Thanks to advances in microprocessing technology, it has 
become possible to use semiconductors to make small structures 
resembling vacuum tubes. Although large-scale vacuum tubes are 
anachronistic, micro-vacuum tubes are being looked at with 
renewed interest because it is thought that operating functions 
different from those of solid state components might be obtained 
if electrons are released from the surface of a semiconductor 
into a vacuum. 
  Mitsubishi Electric's goal is to make a tunnel junction with 
superconductor and insulator layers so that vitality-filled 
electrons are released sharply. As of now, basic studies are 
being carried out, such as on the conditions needed to produce 
high-quality, bismuth-based superconducting thin film surfaces 
and on the characteristics of the experimentally produced 
junctions. In the future, a micro-vacuum tube with the 
capability of large current switching may be produced.

  [Text] Tokyo, March 22 KYODO -- A team of researchers at 
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) said Tuesday [22 
March] it has developed a new thin film for possible use in a 
magnetic disk with the memory capacity nearly 100 times that of 
conventional ones. The researchers made the breakthrough by 
discovering a magnet with a diameter of 8 nanometers 
(one-billionth of a meter), contained in a cobalt-chrome alloy 
crystal, they said. 
  Conventional magnetic films are made up from an alloy 
crystal 
60 nanometers in diameter, according to the researchers. 
  The discovery of the new alloy film is expected to pave the 
way for the production of the increased capacity magnetic disk, 
the primary storage medium for computers, which they said will 
be put into practical use in a few years. 
  The current magnetic disk with a diameter of 2.5 inches has 
a 
memory capacity the equivalent to 10-day's volume of a major 
Japanese-language morning newspaper.

  [Text] The Japan Technology Transfer Association (JTTAS) 
will establish a research forum for exchanges between industry 
and academia on super fine particles. Focusing on the unique 
characteristics possessed by particles on the order of several 
nanometers (10[.sup]-9[/] m), the possible uses of these 
particles in industry are being sought. After collecting 
contributions the participating industries, periodic research 
forums scheduled to begin in October will be sponsored. 
  The Commission on Nano Structure Material Function and 
Applied Research, established as an executive office by JTTAS, 
is chaired by Yuichiro Nishina, professor in the Research 
Institute for Iron, Steel, and Other Materials, Tohoku 
University, and draws its working members from researchers in 
industry, government, and industry, such as the University of 
Tokyo, Kyushu University, Tsukuba University, Tokyo City 
University, Keio University, the Agency of Industrial Science 
and Technology (AIST), and private industry. 
  Compared to typical fine particles, super fine particles 
with 
dimensions of several nanometers have a higher ratio of atoms 
and molecules that constitute the particle's surface. By 
slightly changing the number of atoms and molecules, the 
physical and chemical nature of the particles changes 
dramatically. As a result, this research field has attracted 
attention in recent years. So in addition to being adopted in 
the Ministry of Education's Basic Research Program, AIST also 
began a project which has the aim of establishing technology 
that manipulates individual atoms and molecules. Information on 
the goal of developing new materials using super fine particles 
will be exchanged between industry and academia at the research 
forum. 
  In advance of the forum, a public seminar (admission 
charged) 
will be held in Tokyo on July 7, and the participating 
industries are invited. JTTAS, a corporation authorized by AIST, 
manages, for example, exchanges between industry and academia 
and the services of talented people that accompany each kind of 
technical issue. 
  For information about the research forum, contact the 
executive office by telephone at (03)-3597-8200.

<TEXT>
HOW do you cram more data on your optical disc? The answer could be a
technique developed by Toshiba in Japan which, the company says, will more
than double the data recording density of today's optical disc-based
recording systems.
Using a visible red laser diode, made from indium gallium aluminium
phosphide (InGaAlP), researchers have managed to squeeze 72 megabytes of
data - enough to record about 14m words - on to one square inch of disc
space.
The laser operates at the relatively short wavelength of 690 nanometres,
producing a smaller beam size which enables data to be recorded at a higher
density.

  [Text] Frankfurt--Over the period 1989-1996 the Joint 
European Submicron Silicon Program, JESSI for short, will 
receive total funding of 3 billion ECU. Where JESSI has been 
employed so far the results have been top-rank. This is the 
opinion recently expressed by JESSI's chief executive, Hans 
Meyer, at a meeting of the Technical-Literary Society (TELI) in 
Munich. He said that some partial projects have led to 
technology transfer between partner companies during the last 
few months. 
  Meyer explained the knowledge and the advances that had been 
achieved with JESSI so far: in the new generations of MOS 
transistors, tunnel effects can arise at the submicrometer level 
which reduce the chip's performance. These can now be combatted 
with two proven production steps, namely the nitride-gate-oxide 
process and the Large Angle Tilted Implanted Drain (LATID) 
process. 
  A further innovation involves the transfer of circuitry 
structures onto the chip by optical lithography. In 
wafer-stepper tools the demands for precision grow with 
increased wafer size. As JESSI researches have shown, even the 
available steppers can operate with an accuracy of 0.5 
micrometers. In this case wave lengths of 365 nanometers are 
being used. With even shorter wave lengths, an accuracy of 0.1 
micrometers is said to be attainable. 
  Progress in development is also being reported for storage 
chips of the EPROM type (Erasable Programmable Memory). As has 
already been reported, JESSI distributed the first blueprints 
for a 16-megabit EPROM to partner companies. They were produced 
using 0.6 micrometer technology. 
  JESSI was created by the European Research Coordinating 
Agency (EUREKA) to work jointly on basic technologies for 
electronic chips and chip production. At the moment 185 
institutes and companies are involved, participating in 71 
individual projects.

  [Text] The Japan Technology Transfer Association (JTTAS) 
will establish a research committee for industry/academic 
exchange on ultrafine particles. The committee will focus on the 
special properties of nanometer-sized fine particles and seek 
potential uses for them in industry. The committee is expected 
to begin in October after enrolling participating companies, and 
it will hold regular research conferences. 
  JTTAS will house the business office of the ``Nanostructure 
Materials Function and Use Research Committee,'' which will have 
professor Yuichiro Nishina, Metal Materials Research Laboratory, 
Tohoku University, as its chair and have a coordinating 
committee comprised of researchers from academia, government, 
and industry including Tokyo University, Kyushu University, 
Tsukuba University, Tokyo Metropolitan University, Keio 
University, AIST and private corporations. 
  In ultrafine particles, whose dimensions are measured in 
nanometers, a higher ratio of atoms and molecules comprise the 
surface than with conventional particles, so even a slight 
change in the number of atoms or molecules causes a major change 
in the physical and chemical properties of the particles. 
Research in this field has attracted growing attention in recent 
years. For example, it has been selected by the Ministry of 
Education as a basic research program, and AIST has also 
launched a project for establishing techniques to manipulate 
individual atoms and molecules. The new research committee will 
promote information exchange between industry and academia with 
the goal of developing new materials using ultrafine particles. 
  As a prelude, the committee will hold a public seminar (free 
of charge) in Tokyo to enroll participating companies on 7 July. 
JTTAS is a non-profit corporation under the auspices of AIST, 
and it works to promote exchange between industry and academia 
and helps find human resources for various topics in technology. 
Inquires may be directed to the business office (03-3597-8200).

<F P=106> [Article by Franz Frisch: "6,000 Rpm in a Grain of Rice: A </F>
2-mm Motor Goes Into Series Production -- Leading-Edge 
Technology from Mainz"] 
  [Text] The engine has been running continuously for weeks 
as a fatigue test, its rotor making 6,000 revolutions per 
minute. What is so special about it is that it has a diameter 
of only 2 mm, the size of a grain of rice. It is to be launched 
in 1994 as the world's first electric motor manufactured using 
modern microengineering techniques to come onto the market. 
  Silicon chips first fired information technology, and now 
miniaturization is also moving into conventional fields such as 
mechanical and electrical engineering and metrology. 
  Contrary to what has happened in microelectronics, Europe 
still has its nose out in front in this technology of the 
future, which makes it possible to produce a vast range of 
microscopic components. Over the last 15 years, its inventor, 
Professor Wolfgang Ehrfeld, has been granted about 50 patents 
for what is known as the LIGA (standing, in German, for 
lithography, electroplating, and molding) process. 
  The first micromechanical motor thus comes not from Boston 
or 
Tokyo, but from Mainz, where Ehrfeld set up the Institute of 
Microengineering (IMM), a 120-strong research corporation 
sponsored by the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate, in 1991. 
  Like semiconductor chip circuits, these mini-components are 
first designed in large scale then projected onto the material 
in an extremely reduced scale. The three-dimensional structures 
formed by exposure to parallel x-rays, which are now available 
worldwide in synchrotron centers (such as DESY [German Electron 
Synchrotron] in Hamburg). 
  Simple micromechanical products are already in industrial 
use: Ehrfeld, who first worked at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research 
Center, began setting up the microengineering division at the 
STEAG AG group in 1988. In 1990, this division turned into the 
Dortmund company, Micro-Parts, which now has 60 employees and 
exports microtechnology -- to Japan as well. Outstanding 
examples are its perfectly formed nozzles with diameters ranging 
from 20 to 100 micrometers for inkjet printers. 
  The IMM in Mainz goes for more complex applications ranging 
from a plug for optical communication systems that is only 1 
centimeter wide, is easily inserted, and accurately connects 12 
ultrathin glass fibers on 1 micrometer, to a device the size of 
a cigarette packet for measuring thin films on chips. 
Electronic circuits can even be conjured onto mini-components 
made of silicon. 
  The demand for microtechnology solutions, which are on 
average 100 times smaller than their conventional counterparts, 
is showing a marked increase: Joint projects with industry in 
Mainz rose from 11 to 45 in 1993 alone. 
  Over the three years of the IMM's life to date, Ehrfeld has 
consolidated its leading position. For example, he has managed 
to raise the surface quality of ceramic microstructures 100-fold 
(previous roughness: 3 micrometers, compared with Ehrfeld's 
current 30 nanometers). Gold-coated diamond membranes give 
unprecedented precision for x-ray masks -- the negatives for 
lithography. Jena-based Jenoptik GmbH and the IMM have jointly 
developed an automated machine for producing LIGA structures, 
the first two models of which have been sold to France and the 
United States. 
  As the head of the IMM is aware that the technological lead 
that it has acquired over the United States and the Far East can 
only be maintained if research and development reach critical 
mass, he has established a European network of firms and 
research institutes in 12 European countries. The EU [European 
Union] has awarded this joint project a grant of approximately 
3.5 million German marks.

Mr. Coates had relinquished the president's position to Mr. Moorman in January 1986. 

   Mr. Coates said Mr. Moorman resigned after the two men "discussed the future direction of the company." 
Mr. Coates, the company's founder, said he "effectively" asked for Mr. Moorman's resignation because the company wants to focus on marketing, and Mr. Moorman's background is in manufacturing. 
Mr. Moorman couldn't immediately be reached. 

   Nanometrics said the chief operating officer's post won't be filled. 
Mr. Moorman's resignation as a director reduces board membership to five.

Atomic-Scale Modification and Machining: Good News Transmitted 
From Nation's Nanometer Science &amp; Technology Research''] 
  [Summary] Beijing, 4 Feb -- in 1992, scientists from the 
CAS Institute of Chemistry pioneered domestic research in direct 
nanoscale lithography -- they succeeded in ``writing,'' with a 
10-nm line width, the two characters ``Zhongguo'' and the three 
letters ``CAS'' on a graphite surface via a domestically made 
scanning tunneling microscope (STM) [see JPRS-CST-92-017, 24 Sep 
92 p 25 and JPRS-CST-93-013, 27 Jul 93 pp 10-11]. Now, 
scientists from the CAS Beijing Vacuum Physics Laboratory 
(BVPL), researching a new atomic surface modification technique, 
have succeeded in room-temperature direct manipulation of Si 
atoms on a surface with a single-crystal silicon (SCS) atomic 
arrangement. Average line width for these lines drawn on the SCS 
surface via the STM probe is 2 nm (3-4 Si atoms). An STM image 
of some sample lines, shown in the accompanying micrograph, 
clearly reveals these lines forming the three characters ``Mao 
Zedong,'' as well as the neatly laid-out Si-atom lattice in the 
background. These are the world's smallest characters 
``written'' on a Si surface to date: average character size is 2 
millionths of a cm [i.e., 20 nm]. 

<FIG ID=JPRS-CST-006-03A>      STM Micrograph of Characters ``Mao Zedong'' Written on Si-Atom Surface Via STM by CAS BVPL Scientists; 500 Angstroms </FIG>

  The BVPL scientists were also able to move, or transplant, 
Si 
atoms from one straight line to form another, raised straight 
line. Finally, these scientists were able to neatly transplant 
the atoms on the Si surface along a lattice orientation to form 
a new straight line in a technique they called ``sequenced 
transplantation.'' 
  These three breakthrough achievements in atomic-scale 
surface 
modification and machining represent a major advance in a high 
technology generally recognized as being of major significance 
in the coming century, especially in areas such as high-density 
information storage, nanoscale-device and quantum-well-device 
development, and new materials synthesis.

   LONDON -- Researchers at International Business Machines
Corp. have demonstrated a tiny switch that depends on the
motion of a single atom, making it the smallest electronic
device in existence.
   While any practical application is likely to be more than
a decade away, the advance shows that such minuscule devices
aren't beyond the reach of current technology. Coupled with
other recent breakthroughs, the new "atom switch" raises the
possibility that electronic circuits may someday be built
with parts measuring only an atom or molecule across.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   By comparison, the circuitry in today's top-performance
computer chips is measured in microns, or millionths of a
meter, at least 1,000 times coarser than atomic-scale
devices, which would be measured in nanometers, or billionths
of a meter. In theory, smaller circuitry permits faster,
less-expensive and more-complex computing.
   The technological feat, reported in today's issue of
Nature, a British science journal, is the latest trick to be
performed by an IBM-invented tool known as the scanning
tunneling microscope. The STM, for which two IBM scientists
shared a Nobel Prize in 1987, was initially used to produce
images of individual atoms and molecules, but it's emerging
as an all-purpose instrument for manipulating individual
atoms with startling precision.
   Scientists at IBM and elsewhere have previously used the
STM to move around atoms on a surface to form patterns such
as the IBM logo, as well as to pluck atoms from a surface and
deposit them elsewhere, much like a robotic arm. The
microscope has a very slender tungsten tip that, when
energized by a tiny electric current, can trace and
manipulate the atomic surface contours of many materials.
   Donald Eigler, one of the authors of the Nature report,
said in an interview that the new switch builds on previous
STM research done at his lab in San Jose, Calif., including
the IBM logo stunt last year. Working at an extremely low
temperature, he has been using the STM to move atoms of xenon
around on a nickel surface.
   Mr. Eigler said he and his colleagues recognized almost
immediately that they might make a switch using the STM but
were stymied by the thought that it should look something
like a transistor, the building block of today's electronic
circuits.
   Finally, he said, they realized that a much simpler device
might be made that would merely shuttle a xenon atom back and
forth between the STM's tip and the metal surface. "Once that
idea got through my thick skull, the principle took only a
half-day or a day's work to demonstrate," he said. "It was
quite simple."
   When the xenon atom is on the tip of the STM, more
electrical current flows between the tip and the surface than
when the atom is on the surface. That gives the switch "on"
and "off" positions that can be used to transmit or store
digital information, the language of ones and zeros that
makes computers tick.
   "There are very few times in the life of a scientist when
he realizes that he's seeing something that no one has ever
seen," said Mr. Eigler of the first time he saw the switch
working. "That's the highest high there is for a scientist,
and this was one of those moments for me. It's the stuff that
keeps scientists going," said Mr. Eigler, who spoke from
Switzerland, where he is attending a conference to mark the
10th anniversary of the STM's invention. He said he's giving
a presentation on his atom switch tomorrow.
   Of course, huge obstacles remain -- not least the fact
that Mr. Eigler's tiny switch needs a vacuum around it,
operates at extremely low temperatures and has an expensive
STM attached, making it impractical as an everyday electronic
device. In a related article in Nature, Stanford University
scientist C.F. Quate notes that even if many problems were
solved, using Mr. Eigler's atom switches to store information
would still be prohibitively slow.
   To overcome the speed barrier, Mr. Quate calls for
research into "massively parallel" systems that could operate
many atom switches at a time. He holds out the tantalizing
possibility that the contents of the Library of Congress
might one day be stored on a 12-inch disk.
   Mr. Eigler endorsed the idea of parallel systems but also
suggested that some molecules may already exist that could
act as the kind of switch he has demonstrated, making
possible mass-production of "buckets" of atom switches. "Of
course, the truth is that we don't know whether this
technology will be stillborn or not," Mr. Eigler said. "But
the only way to find out is to go after it."

<F P=106> [Article by Rene Raaijmakers: "Advance of Communication </F>
Lasers in Space Industry. No Need for Radio Frequencies in 
Future Satellites"] 
  [Text] Noordwijk--In 1997, for the first time in history, 
two satellites will transmit using light. It will only be a 
test, but data transfer using infrared lasers instead of radio 
waves ultimately promises great advantages. 
  In an artist's impression or on a photograph of a hovering 
man-made moon, two significant components are instantly 
noticeable: the solar panels and the dish antenna. Such a view 
could drastically change if satellites start using optics for 
communication. The dish would disappear altogether and the 
solar panels would become smaller. Volume and weight savings 
are within reach, and those are powerful criteria in competitive 
space exploration. The European Space Agency (ESA) will 
therefore start experimenting with lasers and optical receivers 
within the next three years. 
<H5>  Optical Data Transfer </H5>
  ESA is taking the first step with the launching of the 
French 
earth observation satellite, Spot-4, at the end of 1996. 
Shortly after that, at the beginning of 1997, Artemis will be 
launched into space. Artemis is an advanced geostationary 
satellite by which various new telecommunications systems will 
be tested. These two will be the first to make use of optical 
data transfer. In addition to the usual dish antennas, with a 
diameter of almost three meters, each satellite will be 
specially equipped with a telescope 25 centimeters in diameter. 
  An optical receiver with this diameter would at the moment 
be 
no lighter than the dish antennas. But when lasers with a 
higher capacity are used in the future, the mass of the optical 
modules could well decrease. "There are as yet no advantages 
with these first attempts. But by the second or third 
generation we make a profit," said Gotthard Oppenhauser, payload 
manager Data Relay Technology Mission (DRTM) at ESTEC in 
Noordwijk. Spot-4 will send remote sensing data back to the 
earth via Artemis. The Spot observation satellite orbits at a 
high speed only 700 to 800 kilometers above the earth's surface 
and can as a result remain in contact with an individual ground 
station for no longer than 10 minutes. The Silex optical 
modules on board Artemis and Spot-4 will, however, enable a 
direct connection between the observation satellite and the 
control room in Toulouse (France). Contact is possible as long 
as Spot-4 is within view of Artemis, which will hover 36,000 
kilometers above the earth. Every 50 minutes, Spot will 
disappear behind the earth's sphere and will in practice be in 
direct contact with Artemis for only about half of its orbit. 
<H5>  Greatest Challenge </H5>
  This also means that the satellites will continually have to 
search for each other. They will send out strong signals with 
19 high capacity lasers, each of 500 milliwatt. This 
"searchlight" cannot be relied upon for communication, but only 
for identification. For the actual transmission, a 
100-milliwatt semiconductor laser will be installed. Both kinds 
are (aluminum gallium arsenide) semiconductor lasers with a wave 
length of about 800 nanometers. This wave length was chosen 
because it is suitable for the most sensitive receivers. There 
will be two reserve 100-milliwatt lasers on board. 
  The greatest challenge in the ESA project is the development 
of a very accurate tracking system. For communication purposes, 
a continuous connection is necessary between the stationary 
Artemis and the Spot-4, which will be moving at a speed of 
30,000 kilometers an hour. The Silex modules on board Artemis 
and Spot-4 must be able to track each other at an accuracy level 
of 0.50 millidegrees. This means that at a distance of 36,000 
kilometers, a deviation of a maximum of 100 meters would be 
allowed. Sensors and electronics must constantly read, 
calculate, and correct the deviation. The laser signals from 
Artemis will also be received at an optical ground station on 
Tenerife. At an altitude of 2,500 meters, and thus almost free 
of diffused light, a telescope one meter across will be erected 
during the second half of 1995. The optical antenna has already 
been made by Carl Zeiss Jena, with support from the German space 
institute DARA, and was completed in November 1993. At the 
moment it is undergoing extensive testing. 
<H5>  A Promising Future </H5>
  The Silex terminals of which the lasers will form a part 
were 
developed by ESA in collaboration with the French space 
laboratory CNES [National Center for Space Studies]. The 
transmission speed is 50 megabits per second. With these 
optical modules, communication is also possible in principle 
over a distance of 40,000 kilometers at a speed of 100 megabits 
per second, but the electronics on the Spot-4 are still a 
limiting factor. Radio waves for satellite communications (with 
a wave length of 15 and one centimeters) generally also reach a 
transmission speed of 100 megabits per second. 
  In principle, however, lasers can be modulated with a much 
higher data speed. For satellite applications, however, a 
higher capacity is also necessary. "We are doing it with a 
simple but robust method," said Oppenhauser. "We are merely 
switching the lasers on and off 50 million times a second." 
  In the future the question to consider will be: greater data 
speed with more capacity, or a smaller telescope. In any case, 
Oppenhauser expects a ten-fold improvement in the sensitivity of 
the optical detection by use of more sensitive modulation 
methods very soon. 
  Not much energy is required for the laser transmission. The 
present lasers work at 100 milliwatt, while satellites for radio 
transmission need to be able to produce 30 Watt very quickly. 
It will therefore be possible to have smaller solar panels in 
the future. 
  A consortium of some 20 companies under the leadership of 
Matra Marconi Space will handle the production of the Silex 
terminals. The first commercial optical modules will be 
installed on the DRS1 and DRS2 (data relay satellites) which 
will probably be launched in 1998 and 2003 respectively.

  [Text] The Agency of International Science and Technology's 
[AIST] Electrotechnical Laboratory (Sotaro Tomiyama, Laboratory 
Chief) established technology to directly observe atoms and 
molecules inside a vacuum. This technology uses laser radiation 
to ionize atoms and molecules, which exist in very small amounts 
in a vacuum, so that the distribution of atoms and molecules in 
space can be detected by imagery. This is the world's first such 
detection device. Combined with ``atom counting'' technology, 
this device enables the counting of atoms one by one. This makes 
it possible to measure the molecular density in an ultrahigh 
vacuum which, up until this time, has been impossible. They 
believe they can play a role in the development of new 
functional elements, recording elements, and information 
elements--the results of atomcraft, which builds up atoms one on 
top of the other. 
  This technology is one of the achievements of a project 
called ``the study related to ultrahigh vacuum generation, 
measurement, and utilization'' using science and technology 
promotion funds. This is a pioneering success by the surface 
control research laboratory of the ETL's ultimate technology 
department. This laboratory has been taking on the challenge of 
creating technology to count gaseous molecules and atoms one by 
one. 
  At present, the technology has advanced to a point where it 
can create an ultrahigh vacuum with a pressure of 
10[.sup]-11[/] pascals, which is that of the environment of 
an artificial satellite in geostationary orbit in space. This 
means that the number of molecules per cubic centimeter is about 
1,000. Therefore, it is necessary to measure precisely an 
ultrahigh vacuum in this state. In particular, it is essential 
to know the absolute number of molecules (gaseous molecular 
density) for the manipulation of molecules and atoms in the 
submicron world. 
  For that reason, it is essential to have the technology to 
know the volume of the space and to detect 100 percent of the 
atoms and molecules in the space. The laboratory has already 
ionized atoms and molecules by striking them with a laser 
radiation-source and established technology for counting the 
generated ions. However, this technology could only count the 
number of atoms and molecules, and could not know the volume of 
space in which the ions were being generated, so it was not 
possible to measure the density (the number of atoms per unit 
space). 
  The developed technology is a detection system that can 
directly observe the ionization sphere made by the laser 
radiation source. It is the first technology to make it possible 
to observe, by video imagery, the ion generation sphere. 
  The laser used for ionization is a picosecond pulse YAG 
laser 
operatingat the second harmonic generation level (wavelength of 
532 nanometers and pulse width of 35 picoseconds). This laser 
radiation was focused into the vacuum by a lens and 100 percent 
of the atoms and molecules [within the focal area] were ionized 
by it. The laboratory has succeeded in directly measuring 
hydrogen molecules within an ultrahigh vacuum.

How do you make everyday materials give out light without heating them?
Scientists have recently produced two new solutions in the form of plastics
and silicon that glow when an electric voltage is applied.
Both have immense commercial potential. Light-emitting plastics could make
paper-thin screens for televisions and computers. These would be far tougher
and more adaptable than either the cathode ray tubes used for conventional
televisions or the new generation of liquid crystal displays.
Light emission from silicon, the main material of electronic chips and the
semiconductor industry, could lead the way to the super-fast optical
processors that have been a dream of the computer industry for a long time.
Such devices, running on photons (pulses of light), would be much more
efficient and compact than the present generation of computers which use
electrons (pulses of electricity) to process data.
UK researchers have played a leading part in both advances. Leigh Canham and
colleagues at the Defence Research Agency, Malvern, discovered how to make
silicon glow. Richard Friend, Andrew Holmes and other scientists at
Cambridge University have led the development of light-emitting plastics.
Both groups have taken out strong patent protection, and the Cambridge
scientists have set up a company, Cambridge Display Technology. If the
discoveries live up to expectation, they will bring in significant royalty
income; but there seems little chance that what remains of the UK
electronics industry will be able to make either plastic displays or optical
computers on a large scale for world markets.
The common factor behind the two developments is a new understanding of the
way electrons behave on what scientists call the nano-scale. (Its name comes
from the nanometre, a unit of length equal to a millionth of a millimetre.)
The trick is to construct special conditions under which electrons release
energy as light, rather than the usual heat.
Leigh Canham's process for making light-emitting silicon is deceptively
simple. He treats a conventional silicon wafer, used for making chips, with
highly corrosive hydrofluoric acid. This eats away more than 80 per cent of
the material.
The porous silicon sponge left behind is, in effect, a web of extremely fine
silicon wires, each 70,000 times thinner than a human hair. When electricity
passes through such thin wires, some of the electrons lose energy by
emitting visible light. The colour of the radiation varies with the
thickness of the silicon.
Canham explains: 'The conventional semiconductor industry uses lithographic
equipment costing millions of pounds. Our structures can be made in a
bucket. It is really cheap and fast to process silicon wafers in this way.'
Even so, there are several essential production tricks - for example, how to
prevent the silicon sponge collapsing as the acid dries - which would not be
obvious to an imitator with a bucket of hydrofluoric acid.
Until now, researchers have had to use more complex and expensive materials,
such as gallium arsenide, as light sources for experiments in optical
computing. If silicon itself can give off light reliably - and, despite the
progress so far, this has yet to be proved - then the outlook for
opto-electronics will be far brighter.
Although optical computers are, potentially, the most important application,
Canham says light-emitting silicon could also lead to a new display
technology, particularly for high-resolution screens connected directly to
silicon circuitry. It could then be competing with the new light-emitting
plastics.
These are a development from the electrically conducting plastics discovered
in the 1970s. When you apply a voltage to ordinary plastics, nothing
happens. But they can carry electricity like a metal if they have a special
molecular structure in which mobile electrons can run along the long polymer
chains.
The Cambridge group first achieved light emission in 1990 by sandwiching a
conducting plastic, PPV, between oppositely charged electrodes. The positive
terminal removes electrons - which is equivalent to pumping positively
charged 'holes' into the plastic. When electrons from the negative electrode
fall into these holes, they give off energy in the form of photons.
Over the past four years, the Cambridge scientists and their main
competitors at the University of California have manipulated the structure
of their light-emitting plastics to improve their efficiency - now at 4 per
cent, compared with 10 per cent for an ordinary light bulb - and tune their
wave-lengths to give a range of colours. The main problem still to overcome
is that PPV and its derivatives break down and stop glowing with long-term
use.
Although the scientists do not understand fully the reasons for this
instability, they are confident it can be overcome. And just as porous
silicon could encroach on the main potential market for plastics - displays
 -the converse is also possible. If the plastics can be made compatible with
integrated circuits, they will be potential light sources for optical
computers.
So, a photo-finish is likely early next century in the race between
light-emitting silicon and plastic to achieve large-scale commercial
production.

  [Abstract] The present work is a continuation of a study of 
the synthesis of regular nano-structures on the surfaces of 
solid matrices as possible materials for nano-electronics and 
its study using scanning tunnel microscopy. Pyrographite plates 
were used as substrates in accordance with the specifics of 
scanning tunnel microscopy. Nanometer-size structures were 
formed on the surfaces by chemical modification of transition 
metals and phosphorus with halogens. The first results indicated 
that pyrographite treated with vanadium oxychloride had the most 
structure ordering. Therefore, the present work was devoted to 
studying the surface composition of vanadium 
oxychloride-modified pyrographite using X-ray photoelectron 
spectroscopy. It was demonstrated that the carrier gas used 
(air, nitrogen, or helium) plays a significant role in the 
concentration of elements on the surface layer as well as the 
shape of the V 2p[.sub]3/2[/], C1 s, O 1s lines in the 
photoelectron spectra. A comparative analysis of the spectra of 
modified pyrographite with the bulk oxygen compounds of vanadium 
led to the hypothesis on the structures formed on the 
pyrographite surface are similar in nature to that of hydrated 
vanadium oxide. The concentration and degree of polycondensation 
of surface structures are determined by the oxygen content in 
the carrier-gas. Figures 3; references 6 (Russian).

<F P=106> [Unattributed article: "French Develop Materials With </F>
Several Properties"] 
  [Text] Frankfurt. Every material has some characteristic 
physical properties. According to recent research performed by 
French material scientists, it will be possible in future to 
plan materials so that they possess several properties which can 
be built into them in a deliberate and controlled way. Thus it 
will be possible in a single material to combine magnetic 
properties with specific non-linear optical properties which do 
not occur in nature and which it has hitherto been impossible to 
produce. The basic principles for the production of such new 
materials were discovered and investigated at the Laboratoire de 
Chimie Inorganique of the French Universite Paris Sud. 
  In the view of the French scientists, the combinatorial 
possibilities are unlimited, and this means that it will in 
future be possible to go about creating completely new materials 
on the basis of requirement profiles. One of the first such 
materials they were able to obtain was crystallizing compounds 
which combine a very high magnetic value with the capacity to 
double the oscillation of light frequencies, that is, to produce 
light oscillations of the second upper harmonic oscillation in 
passing through the layers. At the same time the material 
possesses permanent magnetic properties. 
  The combination of these two important properties is brought 
about by deliberate construction of interconnected molecular 
structures, of which one component is responsible for the 
magnetic properties and another for the non-linear optical 
properties. 
  But in order to achieve this, the atomic lattices of the 
individual components must be made to interconnect. In the 
process, the structure of an inorganic compound determines the 
alignment and the intercalation of an organic compound. The 
developers say that the design gives rise to interconnected 
hybrid compounds which consist of both organic and inorganic 
molecules. 
  For continuing experiments the scientists are using "DAMS," 
short for dimethyl amino-N-methyl stilbazoline, as an organic 
compound. Because of its structure, it possesses non-linear 
optical properties if there is no domain formation with symmetry 
centers in the dipolar-type compound. In order to prevent this, 
these organic, color-bearing molecules are combined as 
chromophores with cations of a manganese salt and anions from 
phosphide sulfide. In the process a complex hybrid compound 
arises (MnO.86S3(DAMS)0.26), whose inorganic components take 
care of the incorporation of the organic molecules in the 
requisite interstitial structure, and thus causes the molecular 
orientation for the optical behavior. 
  The new material created is permanently magnetic up to a 
temperature of 40 ÎK and doubles incident laser light over a 
relatively wide frequency range. The new material is available 
in crystalline form, but at the moment the question of whether 
it can be drawn out into thin films for frequency filters, for 
example, or applied to glass substrates in a few atomic layers, 
has not yet been thoroughly investigated. 
  The scientists are consciously refraining from investigating 
any practical applications more thoroughly yet, preferring to 
research the principles according to which the formation of such 
combinations of properties must proceed. For if these rules are 
known, a very large number of coumpounds can be synthesized 
which unite several properties, perhaps even opposing ones. 
  In some ways this method of synthesis may represent a 
complement to the sol-gel procedure which is commonly used today 
to build up new compounds from nanometer-sized components. In 
comparison with materials currently in use, which are designed 
to optimize a single property, the developers speak of a new 
generation of "two-dimensional" materials. If more than two 
properties can be combined in a material, "multidimensional" 
materials are also theoretically possible. For further 
information: Universite Paris Sud, Laboratoire de Chimie 
Inorganique, F-91405 Orsay, France.
