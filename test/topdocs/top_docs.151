   Watch out, Tony the Tiger, here comes a copycat.
   General Mills Inc. is quietly producing a sugar-coated
version of Wheaties that looks and tastes remarkably like the
country's best-selling presweetened cereal, Frosted Flakes
made by archrival Kellogg Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The appearance of Wheaties Honey Gold signals the latest
round in a battle for the breakfast bowl between the two
companies. Whereas in the past the rivals seldom copied each
other, both are now blatantly using knockoffs to win points
in the $7 billion domestic ready-to-eat cereal market.
   General Mills recently introduced a three-grain version of
Kellogg's Rice Krispies called Triples. Perhaps
coincidentally, a sugar-coated version of Rice Krispies
brought out by Kellogg in the mid-1970s is reappearing in
some grocery stores in Minneapolis, General Mills' hometown.
   Kellogg also greeted General Mills' recent entry into the
European market by rolling out its own version of Honey Nut
Cheerios, called Honey Nut Loops, a line extension of Froot
Loops.
   Wheaties Honey Gold leaves little doubt that the cereal
giants are getting away from their flirtation with "healthy"
cereals high in fiber, a fad that culminated in the oat bran
boomlet.
   "The game of selling more fiber and more oats has changed
to a renewed emphasis on the children's area," says John
McMillin, food analyst at Prudential Securities. "During the
oat bran craze the kids were forgotten."
   Kellogg failed twice to woo children with "nutritious"
cereals, first with graham-flour-based S.W. Graham and more
recently with Bigg Mixx, a four-grain presweetened product.
"It's just not there," Kellogg Chairman William E. LaMothe
admitted recently, referring to Bigg Mixx's attraction.
   A Kellogg spokeswoman says the company typically doesn't
comment on competitors' products, but she acknowledges that
the new General Mills cereal "certainly looks" like an
attempt to mimic Frosted Flakes. Although Frosted Flakes
features a cartoon character, Tony the Tiger, Kellogg
successfully expanded the product's appeal beyond kids with
an ad campaign featuring adults, whose faces are hidden,
admitting that they also eat the presweetened flakes.
   A General Mills spokesman says the sweetened version of
Wheaties will be pitched as an "all-family cereal. The target
is people who like what Wheaties stands for but like a
presweetened cereal."
   The word "Wheaties" is turned sideways on the box,
allowing "Honey Gold" to dominate. Unlike its namesake, the
cereal contains corn as well as wheat.
   General Mills hasn't yet announced the new cereal,
although it began taking orders from the grocery trade
yesterday. The product is being produced in the company's new
plant in Covington, Ga., and securities analysts touring the
facility late last week took home boxes of the new cereal.
   While line extensions account for most of the "new" food
items introduced each year, they're still unusual in the
cereal business, where research scientists have been
remarkably creative in using three basic techniques --
flaking, puffing and biscuit-baking -- to fashion new
cereals.
   But the trend seems to be toward the tried-and-true to
gain market share. Kellogg's latest cereal, a presweetened
offering called Double Dip Crunch, is a sugar-coated version
of its Crispix product. And Frosted Flakes, the nation's No.
2 selling cereal with a 5.3% share, is itself a line
extension -- a sweetened version of Corn Flakes, Kellogg's
best-seller world-wide, which has a 5.6% share of the U.S.
market.
   Wheaties Honey Gold jazzes up General Mills' oldest brand;
Wheaties, introduced in 1922, has a 1.5% market share. The
company made lightning strike twice when it dipped its
best-seller, Cheerios, in honey. It followed that with Apple
Cinnamon Cheerios. Together the three have an impressive 8.9%
share, or about $623 million in annual sales.
   Overall, Kellogg has about a 38% share, and General Mills
a 28.4% share of the U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market.
   General Mills says Wheaties Honey Gold will first appear
in the eastern half of the U.S. in mid-September. The company
says it hasn't signed off on advertising plans for Wheaties
Honey Gold, but a spokeswoman says basketball superstar and
Wheaties pitchman Michael Jordan won't be pulling the new
cereal from his locker in TV commercials.

   Tony the Tiger says Frosted Flakes are grrrreat, but attorneys
general from five states claim he isn't telling the full story.
   The officials allege Kellogg Co. used deceptive and misleading
health claims about Frosted Flakes and two other cereals. A company
spokesman denied the accusations.
   In documents filed Friday in federal court in Des Moines, Iowa,
the attorneys general responded to Kellogg's claims made in a
lawsuit filed in August against the Iowa attorney general and
secretary of agriculture.
   The lawsuit and counterclaims stem from an investigation into
Kellogg's advertising that began two years ago.
   The officials from Minnesota, California, Florida, Texas and
Wisconsin also made several counterclaims, among them that
Kellogg's lacks ``reasonable substantiation'' for claiming Frosted
Flakes is a healthy snack food superior to some fruits. Television
commercials for the cereal feature the cartoon character Tony the
Tiger.
   Regarding Special K, the officials said Kellogg's misrepresented
the cereal's benefit by saying those who eat it can ``keep the
muscle, lose the fat.''
   They said such representation failed to disclose that ``for the
vast majority of consumers and even for those on a diet, eating one
serving of Special K would have virtually no effect on preventing
the loss of muscle as the majority of dieters are in no danger of
losing muscle, and for those who are, a serving of Special K would
be insignificant...''
   Kellogg's claim that a cereal formerly named 40&plus; Bran Flakes had
a particular benefit because it contained the ``maximum amount of
fiber plus iron'' for people over 40 failed to say the cereal was
not formulated particularly for people over 40, the officials said.
In addition, there was no proof that people over 40 needed the
ingredients contained in the cereal more than younger people, they
said.
   Kellogg no longer markets its bran flake cereal under the 40&plus;
name.
   Joseph Stewart, Kellogg's senior vice president for corporate
affairs, said the company, based in Battle Creek, Mich., stands
behind its advertising.
   ``The federal authority over advertising exists and these
individuals are attempting now to regulate advertisements
state-by-state,'' he said.
   Kellogg has promoted Special K as a high protein cereal for more
than 35 years, he said, and claims the cereal can help retain
muscle while losing fat when eaten as part of a regimen that
includes exercise.
   Frosted Flakes has 11 grams of sugar while an apple, for
example, has 14 grams of sugar, Stewart said.
   He said Kellogg officials at first sought to negotiate with Iowa
officials, but now contend the accusations amount to harassment.

<HEAD>Ralston-Purina Puts Adult Incentive in Kids' Cereals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ralston Purina Co. is giving away $29,000 sports
cars in a promotion designed to sell more cereal, but it steered
away from high-fiber ``adult'' products in selecting vehicles for
the giveaway.
   The St. Louis-based food marketer chose six children's cereals
with names like Freakies, Fruit Islands and Ghostbusters for the
promotion.
   Ralston isn't the first to recognize the potential in marketing
children's cereals to adults.
   The leader in the $5 billion ready-to-eat cereal market, Kellogg
Co., has been doing it for years in advertising its Frosted Flakes
and Frosted Mini-Wheats brands, among others. Frosted Flakes
commercials have shown adults ``confessing'' to a powerful
attraction for the taste of the cereal and drawing the window
shades while they indulge.
   General Mills Inc. advertises the ``unsinkability'' and low
sugar content of its Cheerios brand in advertising aimed at adults
and spins stories about the latest adventures of the Cheerios kid
in commercials aimed at children.
   Quaker Oats Co. found a few years ago that its Cap'n Crunch
cereal was so popular at campus cafeterias that it devised a
special version of a ``Find the Captain'' promotion for college
students.
   Ronald Strauss, who follows the cereal business for the
investment firm William Blair &amp; Co. in Chicago, said cereal makers
have increasingly tried to market their products as something for
all the family.
   ``The demographics are changing. The average age of the
population is getting older and there are simply not as many
teenyboppers out there anymore,'' he said.
   Celeste Clark, a spokeswoman for Kellogg, which is based in
Battle Creek, Mich., said advertising pre-sweetened cereals to
adults reminds them of the good tastes they enjoyed while they were
growing up.
   Frosted Flakes, for example, has been available for more than 35
years and was initially marketed to children, she said.
   But many of those who ate it years ago may now have children of
their own and may be receptive to trying it again, she said.
   Kellogg began advertising Frosted Flakes to adults five years
ago with the light-hearted approach that aims at reassuring them it
is appropriate for adults to eat it, and Ms. Clark said the cereal
now leads the category.
   Strauss said his figures confirm that, with Frosted Flakes
capturing about 6 percent of the retail value of the ready-to-eat
cereal market in 1986.
   Ms. Clark said Kellogg has also fouind that while health
concerns are driving some adults toward cereals with fruits, nuts
and grains, a key factor in determining what cereal people buy is
still its taste.
   Kathryn Newton, a spokeswoman for General Mills in Minneapolis,
said advertising children's cereal to adults makes sense because
adults make the purchases for all of them.
   That was the principle motivation behind the Ralston sports car
promotion, said spokeswoman Sandra Harrington.
   Ralston Purina began offering tiny sports car models in about 11
million boxes of six of its children's cereals in February. Ten
boxes of cereal contain a scale-model red Corvette, and those who
find the models can turn them in for the real thing, a 1988
Chevrolet Corvette valued at about $29,000.
   The promotion has been advertised nationally in newspapers and
network television commercials, the company said. Sales results are
not yet available.
   ``We were looking for something that would appeal to parents as
well as kids,'' Ms. Harrington said.
   She said the company doesn't know if the promotion will prompt
adults to try the cereals, but hopes that it will at least get them
to buy it for their children. ``Maybe this will be the difference
between having them pick up pour cereal or buying something else,''
she said.

   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. -- Kellogg Co. said it asked a federal
court in Iowa to block the Iowa attorney general from acting
against the company's health claims in advertisements for
Special K, 40 + Bran Flakes and Frosted Flakes cereals.
   Kellogg said it filed its suit to end what it views as
"harassment" by Iowa Attorney General Thomas J. Miller and
the attorneys general of seven other states. The officials
raised questions two years ago about the Kellogg ads. Since
then, Kellogg said it has engaged in "long and fruitless
discussions" with the attorneys general and provided
thousands of pages of documents substantiating its claims.

   "We think it's time to bring this to an end and let the
courts decide," said Joseph M. Stewart, senior vice president
for corporate affairs. "We stand behind our advertising. . .
. They (the attorneys general) continue to say our
advertising is misleading."
   Mr. Miller, the Iowa attorney general, couldn't be reached
for comment. Kellogg said the attorneys general hadn't
produced a single consumer complaint or scientific study to
support their allegations.
   Kellogg said the issue involves its claims that Special K
is a high-protein cereal and can help dieters or exercisers
"keep the muscle, lose the fat;" that 40 + Bran Flakes is
rich in fiber and iron and is beneficial to those 40 and
older and that Frosted Flakes is "good for you" and has less
sugar than many snack foods.

   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. -- Kellogg Co. soon will introduce its
first presweetened cereal for kids in 15 years, a four-grain
flaked product called Bigg Mixx.
   The ready-to-eat product includes rolled oats, rice,
toasted corn flakes and whole-grain wheat, flavored with
brown sugar and cinnamon. One variety also comes with
raisins.

   Most of Bigg Mixx's $22 million rollout budget will focus
on a fanciful creature -- part chicken, wolf, moose and pig
-- that will speak for the product. The character, named for
the cereal, joins Tony the Tiger and Toucan Sam in Kellogg's
marketing menagerie.
   The last successful presweetened item from the world's
largest maker of ready-to-eat cereals was Frosted Krispies, a
1975 rollout.
   Kellogg's hopes for a new hit with kids and their parents
last year was S.W. Graham, a graham-flour cereal with a
nostalgia advertising campaign. But when initial sales didn't
meet expectations, the company quietly took it off the
market.

<HEAD>Kellogg Holds Prices on Best Sellers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co., which has seen
private-label brands take a bite out of sales of its most popular
cereals, is making its latest price increase a bit easier for
consumers to swallow.
   The world's largest cereal maker said Tuesday it has raised
prices on most of its products an average of 3.7 percent, but is
exempting Corn Flakes - for the second straight year - and Frosted
Flakes, two of its biggest sellers.
   Because those cereals and some smaller brands were omitted from
the increase, the net price increase is about 2.8 percent, Kellogg
spokesman Richard Lovell said Tuesday. The increase took effect
Saturday.
   William E. LaMothe, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive
officer, told industry analysts last week that since 1987,
private-label versions had increased their market share to 6.2
percent from 3.6 percent, largely at the expense of Corn Flakes,
Frosted Flakes, Rice Krispies, Raisin Bran and Froot Loops.
   LaMothe told the analysts that ``in response to very competitive
conditions, including competition from unbranded products, we'd be
very conservative in our increases,'' Lovell said.
   Over the last couple of years, Kellogg has seen its market share
dip from about 41 percent to 38 percent of the approximately $7
billion ready-to-eat domestic cereal industry. The industry has
been relatively flat this year after a few years of hefty sales
growth, analysts said.
   Kellogg's increase is well below the average 5.9 percent
increase rival General Mills Inc. announced Oct. 19. However,
analysts noted, Kellogg raised its prices an average of 2.2 percent
last spring, while General Mills' last increase was in November
1989.
   Ralston-Purina Co., which makes about half of all cereal sold to
private companies for sale under their own labels, also is gaining
ground with such novelty children's products as Teen-age Mutant
Ninja Turtles and Batman cereals, said John C. Maxwell Jr., cereal
analyst for Wheat First Securities of Richmond, Va.
   But, Maxwell said, Minneapolis-based General Mills is in the
best position for the 1990s with the popularity of oat-based
cereals such as Cheerios still on the rise.
   ``If it doesn't say bran or oats on the label, people aren't
buying,'' Maxwell said. ``Unless Kellogg develops new products to
offset the decline (in older brands), they're going to be in
trouble.''
   However, LaMothe told analysts last week that new products,
because of their increased cost and riskiness, probably would not
be a key to regaining market share.
   Analyst Edward Eyring of Argus Research Corp. in New York said
his company recently has taken a more bullish view of Kellogg and
thinks the relatively conservative price increase is a ``step in
the right direction.''
   ``We think Kellogg has untapped potential,'' he said. ``We have
confidence that the company will be able to successfully tap the
international market for cereals as it intends to do and weather
the competitive pressures that private brands are putting on it.''

   This hasn't been Kellogg Co.'s year.
The oat-bran craze has cost the world's largest cereal maker market share.
The company's president quit suddenly.
And now Kellogg is indefinitely suspending work on what was to be a $1 billion cereal plant.

   The company said it was delaying construction because of current market conditions.
But the Memphis, Tenn., facility wasn't to begin turning out product until 1993, so the decision may reveal a more pessimistic long-term outlook as well.

   Kellogg, which hasn't been as successful in capitalizing on the public's health-oriented desire for oat bran as rival General Mills Inc., has been losing share in the $6 billion ready-to-eat cereal market.
Kellogg's current share is believed to be slightly under 40% while General Mills' share is about 27%.

   Led by its oat-based Cheerios line, General Mills has gained an estimated 2% share so far this year, mostly at the expense of Kellogg.
Each share point is worth about $60 million in sales.

   Analysts say much of Kellogg's erosion has been in such core brands as Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Frosted Flakes, which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume.
Kellogg is so anxious to turn around Corn Flakes sales that it soon will begin selling boxes for as little as 99 cents, trade sources say.

   "Cheerios and Honey Nut Cheerios have eaten away sales normally going to Kellogg's corn-based lines simply because they are made of oats," says Merrill Lynch food analyst William Maguire.
"They are not a happy group of people at Battle Creek right now."
Kellogg is based in Battle Creek, Mich., a city that calls itself the breakfast capital of the world.

   Another analyst, John C. Maxwell Jr. of Wheat, First Securities in Richmond, Va., recently went to a "sell" recommendation on Kellogg stock, which closed Friday at $71.75, down 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
"I don't think Kellogg can get back to 40% this year," he said.
"Kellogg's main problem is life style.
People are reading the boxes and deciding they want something that's `healthy' for you -- oats, bran."
Mr. Maxwell said he wouldn't be surprised if, over the next two years or so, General Mills' share increased to 30% or more.

   In announcing the plant delay, Kellogg Chairman William E. LaMothe said, "Cereal volume growth in the U.S. has not met our expectations for 1989."
He said construction wouldn't resume until market conditions warrant it.

   Kellogg indicated that it has room to grow without adding facilities.
The company has five other U.S. plants, including a modern facility at its Battle Creek headquarters known as Building 100, which is to add bran-processing and rice-processing capacity next year.

   General Mills, meanwhile, finds itself constrained from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity.
A large plant in Covington, Ga., is to come on line next year.

   A Kellogg officer, who asked not to be named, said the Memphis project was "pulled in for a reconsideration of costs," an indication that the ambitious plans might be scaled back in any future construction.
Initial cost estimates for the plant, which was to have been built in phases, ranged from $1 billion to $1.2 billion.

   A company spokesman said it was "possible, but highly unlikely," that the plant might never be built.
"As we regain our leadership level where we have been, and as we continue to put new products into the marketplace and need additional capacity, we will look at resuming our involvement with our plan," he said.

   The new facility was to have been the world's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant, and Kellogg's largest construction project.
The company had retained the Fluor Daniel unit of Fluor Corp. as general contractor.

   But in recent weeks, construction-industry sources reported that early preparation work was slowing at the 185-acre site.
Subcontractors said they were told that equipment orders would be delayed.
Fluor Daniel already has reassigned most of its work crew, the sources said.

   Last Friday's announcement was the first official word that the project was in trouble and that the company's plans for a surge in market share may have been overly optimistic.
Until recently, Kellogg had been telling its sales force and Wall Street that by 1992 it intended to achieve a 50% share of market, measured in dollar volume.

   Although he called current market conditions "highly competitive," Mr. LaMothe, Kellogg's chairman and chief executive officer, forecast an earnings increase for the full year.
Last year, the company earned $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion.

   As expected, Kellogg reported lower third-quarter earnings.
Net fell 16% to $123.1 million, or $1.02 a share, from $145.7 million, or $1.18 a share.
Sales rose 4.8% to $1.20 billion from $1.14 billion.

   The company had a one-time charge of $14.8 million in the latest quarter covering the disposition of certain assets.
The company wouldn't elaborate, citing competitive reasons.

   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. -- Before being elected Kellogg Co.'s
next chairman and chief executive officer on Friday, Arnold
G. Langbo ate a breakfast of Fiberwise cereal and fruit.
   It was a fitting start for the incoming leader of the
world's biggest cereal maker. "I eat a lot of cereal," Mr.
Langbo says.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   His task is to see that millions of others do as well. As
head of a company with unparalleled world-wide market shares,
with ample cash and a newfound willingness to spend whatever
it takes, the 54-year-old executive is eager to proceed.
   "The exciting issue for the '90s is geographic expansion,"
he says, noting that Kellogg recently entered what had been
East Germany and also revealed plans for plants in Latvia and
India.
   China may be next. Mr. Langbo, who as chairman intends to
continue his current oversight of the company's international
operations, says Kellogg hopes to build a plant in the
People's Republic soon. Reluctant to give details, he would
say only that "we're moving right along."
   And he indicated that changing China's eating habits could
be challenging. Kellogg makes ready-to-eat, or cold, cereal,
while the Chinese are "used to eating something that's warm,
soft and savory" for breakfast, Mr. Langbo noted.
   He will succeed William E. LaMothe as chairman and CEO
upon Mr. LaMothe's retirement on Dec. 31. Like his
predecessor, who spent his entire career at the company, Mr.
Langbo began 35 years ago as a Kellogg sales representative
in his native British Columbia, Canada.
   After directors dismissed the company's President Horst W.
Schroeder in 1989, Mr. Langbo, who by then was running
international operations, was promoted to president and
joined the board.
   He was a popular choice. "People are very loyal to him," a
former colleague said. "He's a positive stroker."
   While overseas offers what its chairman-elect calls "great
opportunities," Kellogg is spending heavily to defend its
leading 37.5% share of the U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market.
   Indeed, in its third quarter ended Sept. 30, Kellogg's
selling and administrative expenses soared $100 million from
a year earlier. Further increases are likely in the current
quarter, the company said. Mr. Langbo indicated in an
interview that a big chunk of those dollars would go into
television advertising, including network, local (spot) and
cable.
   In the U.S., Kellogg also is seeking to fend off
private-label intruders on four of its biggest brands -- Corn
Flakes, Frosted Flakes, Raisin Bran and Rice Krispies -- with
deep-discount promotions. One allows customers to get two
boxes for the price of one during a limited time period.
   Meanwhile, Kellogg is seeking to economize overseas with
commercials that can be adapted to many markets. Mr. Langbo
said one coming commercial for Frosted Flakes can be used in
two dozen countries. As a result, "We saved tremendous
amounts of money."
   Although Mr. Langbo promised several new cereals in the
next year, he wouldn't be specific other than to indicate
that Kellogg will do substantial research before bringing new
products to market because of huge promotional costs
involved. However, he added that consumers shouldn't be
surprised to see products that use grains typically not in
breakfast bowls today.
   Mr. LaMothe, who began as a salesman loading a station
wagon with cereal cases 41 years ago in Brooklyn, says he
intends to remain on Kellogg's board, as is the custom with
former chairmen.
   "I'm still going 90 miles an hour here," he said Friday.
Mr. LaMothe is perhaps best-known in the food industry as an
evangelist for cereal as a health food. Some say it is more
than coincidental that his initials are WEL.

   Horst W. Schroeder, Kellogg Co.'s president and heir-apparent to its chief executive officer, resigned unexpectedly, citing "personal reasons."

   Kellogg had no further explanation for the 48-year-old executive's sudden departure, which comes as the world's largest cereal company fights to regain market share.
The company issued its three-sentence announcement yesterday at the same hour that rival General Mills Inc. reported nearly a three percentage-point increase in its share of the U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market -- a gain made largely at Kellogg's expense.

   Mr. Schroeder, who was named president and chief operating officer only last December, couldn't be reached for comment.
A company spokesman said Mr. Schroeder hadn't come to work, indicating that his letter of resignation apparently was submitted to the chairman and chief executive, William E. LaMothe, over the weekend.

   The spokesman said that Mr. LaMothe had neither sought nor anticipated the resignation.
But, the spokesman added, "in his 40 years he's seen other things like this and he's not alarmed."
Mr. LaMothe couldn't be reached.

   Mr. Schroeder's appointment as president and chief operating officer -- positions that were vacant for two years -- had been interpreted as a prelude to Kellogg's chairmanship for Mr. Schroeder.
The current chairman is 62, and traditionally company officers retire at age 65.

   Moreover, because Messrs.
LaMothe and Schroeder had appeared at a major news conference together just last month -- they announced proposed industry standards on the touchy issue of health claims for food -- analysts suggested that some recent event had altered Mr. LaMothe's view of the West German as his successor.
Several mentioned reports that Mr. Schroeder's direct, no-nonsense manner had upset subordinates, who may have made their feelings known to the chairman.

   "He wasn't getting the right relationship with people below him, with those ultimately responsible for market share and for beating General Mills," said William Maguire of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Another analyst, John McMillin of Prudential-Bache Securities, said that Mr. Schroeder "wouldn't have left unless he thought he was in jeopardy of losing the CEO's job."

   Kellogg's board is to meet later this week, and some on Wall Street expect that Mr. LaMothe will use that occasion to elaborate on his chief lieutenant's departure -- and perhaps name a successor.
Among those prominently named for the presidency are two executive vice presidents: Gary E. Costley, who is in charge of the U.S. Food Products division, and Arnold G. Langbo, head of Kellogg International.

   Until a successor is named, Mr. LaMothe will assume the responsibilities of the president's office, Kellogg said.
Part of Mr. Schroeder's tasks was to oversee marketing strategy for the $4.3 billion company, which, with a market share of nearly 39%, continues to dominate the domestic cold-cereal market.

   But while Kellogg was at the forefront in promoting cereals as healthy foods, General Mills has done better at cashing in on that belief -- particularly in feeding the nation's oat-bran craze with its war horse Cheerios.
Yesterday, General Mills announced it had achieved a 27% market share during its first quarter ended Aug. 27, up from a 24.6% in fiscal 1989.

   "Much of this gain reflects growth of the three Cheerios brand products," General Mills said.
Cheerios and the spinoff Honey Nut and Apple Cinnamon varieties, with a combined 10% market share, recently knocked off Kellogg's Frosted Flakes as the biggest selling brand in the country.

   Kellogg has been scrambling to recover, and in addition to several oat-based cereals recently announced Heartwise, a cereal containing psyllium fiber.
But on that score as well, General Mills was out in front, with its Benefit flakes introduced last April.
Psyllium is said by the cereal makers to be instrumental in reducing levels of blood cholesterol.

   While such health-oriented cereals as Common Sense oat bran have been doing well for Kellogg, stalwarts such as Corn Flakes, Rice Krispies and Frosted Flakes have been giving up share.
"The poor performance of the company recently in terms of market share . . . may have disrupted relations between Mr. LaMothe and Mr. Schroeder," said Nomi Ghez, food analyst at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.

   Although he came from a financial background, Mr. Schroeder made points at Kellogg by pushing the Mueslix brand cereal concept several years ago -- despite a chorus of doubters within the company.
An adaptation of an old-line European cereal, Mueslix is a mix of dense flakes mixed with dried fruits and nuts.

   Mr. Schroeder joined Kellogg in 1970 after working as an accountant in Hamburg, West Germany.
He spent most of his 19 years with Kellogg on the international side.
Because of solid sales gains in that division, Mr. Schroeder was promoted to president of Kellogg North America in 1986.
He was elected a director of Kellogg this past April.

   A West German by birth, Mr. Schroeder remains a citizen of that country.
Immigration and Naturalization Service records show that Mr. Schroeder has lived and worked in the U.S. under a so-called green card since 1985 and that he has not applied for American citizenship.

   For knockdown rivalry, forget the Rose Bowl or the Cotton
Bowl. This year's toughest competition is taking place in the
cereal bowl.
   "Buy one, get one free." . . . "For a limited time,
Cheerios or Wheaties or Kix just 99 cents each." . . . "Buy
two boxes of Rice Krispies or Raisin Bran and get a stuffed
toy for Christmas." . . . "How about a free gallon of milk
for your cereal? No? Some bananas then."

<TEXT>
   An avalanche of cereal come-ons has descended on consumers
as the industry giants -- Kellogg Co. and General Mills Inc.
-- go head to head for a bigger share of the lucrative $7.5
billion-a-year business. Indeed, even as they annually raise
prices in the 3%-to-5% range, so that some cereals are
approaching $5 a box, market leader Kellogg and archrival
General Mills are virtually giving away some product to snare
business. (Between them, they already hold two-thirds of the
domestic market, with Kellogg ahead 38% to 28%.)
   In this clash, the two behemoths aren't shy either about
bashing each other's products. Current boxes of Total Corn
Flakes from General Mills proclaim the product "more
nutritious and better-tasting than Kellogg's Corn Flakes."
Kellogg counters with streamers on packages of Just Right
saying its "taste beats Total." (Kellogg says it has research
proving that claim but declines to disclose it.)
   "Kellogg is spending like it's on the warpath," says
analyst John McMillin, who follows the cereal industry for
Prudential Securities. In the third quarter alone, Kellogg
shelled out an estimated $100 million more on marketing than
it had a year earlier. Sales jumped 11.4% and earnings 6.2%.
   There is no indication that Kellogg will let up soon. Mr.
McMillin believes Kellogg is as intent on forcing General
Mills to pay more attention to its business at home --
General Mills recently ventured overseas, where Kellogg is
king -- as it is on gaining domestic share points.
   "As the market leader, we are going to protect and
increase that leadership -- doing whatever it takes," says
Kellogg senior vice president Joseph Stewart. Noting that
"the cereal business has always been intensely competitive,"
General Mills vice chairman Arthur Schulze says his company
seeks to build market share by "focusing on the consumer's
breakfast needs rather than on our competition." Grocers
often put cereals on special, he says, because next to soft
drinks they are a store's largest-selling branded-food item.
   Whatever the rationale, U.S. consumers are the winners.
Where company founder W.K. Kellogg once snared customers with
advertisements warning he couldn't make enough corn flakes to
meet their demand, today's pitches stick primarily to price
promotions. Discount coupons, some worth $1 and more, lard
Sunday newspaper supplements, for instance.
   "We're seeing aggressive pricing," says a spokesman for
Dominick's Finer Foods, a Chicago-based supermarket chain.
Promotions, he adds, are "more frequent and deeper."
   The explanation is simple: A single share point, or 1% of
total sales, means $75 million in revenue. Brands can thrive
on less than that. And where profit margins run 20% and more,
incremental sales mean bottom-line gains.
   Against the Big Two in the cereal wars, "the real losers
are the small guys," contends Bonnie Wittenburg, food analyst
at Dain Bosworth in Minneapolis. She thinks Quaker Oats Co.
and RJR's Nabisco Brands unit, each with less than 10% of the
domestic market, are particularly vulnerable. Kellogg's
recent announcement that it will introduce a low-fat granola
soon is seen as a shot at Quaker, whose much-smaller product
line includes a granola.
   At the same time, all national brands are under attack
from their primary customers: the nation's supermarkets. Many
chains have their own house-brand cereals; Cincinnati-based
Kroger Co., for example, has 20 varieties. "The national
brands are priced pretty high. That's left plenty of room for
private-label people like us to come in with dramatically
lower prices," says a Kroger spokesman. "As a result, our
sales have increased rather sharply."
   Many private-label products are blatant knockoffs of
leading national brands, advertised as being cheaper without
sacrificing taste. In Hy-Vee Food Stores Inc. outlets across
Iowa, an oat-based cereal called Tasteeos closely resembles
-- and is placed on shelves next to -- General Mills'
Cheerios. Whereas Cheerios may cost $3.26 for 15 ounces,
Tasteeos costs about half that, $1.69. Hy-Vee also stocks
apple-cinnamon and honey-nut versions of Tasteeos, mimicking
Cheerios' line extensions.
   Cereals are such profitable staples that supermarkets
sometimes offer discounts on their house brands. North
Carolina-based Food Lion Inc. stores celebrated a grand
opening in Dallas earlier this month with a two-for-one sale
on its private-label cereals. Tactics like that put
price-slashing pressure on the national brands. At Food Saver
stores in Des Moines last week, Kellogg was selling boxes of
Rice Krispies for just 84 cents, with an in-store coupon.
   Others also nibble at the majors' market shares.
British-based Weetabix recently introduced a line of
"natural" cereals named Grainfields in the New York
metropolitan area. On the West Coast, an "environmentally
correct" multigrain cereal called Rainforest Crisp boasts of
buying nuts grown in Brazil's jungles, thereby discouraging
their destruction.
   To fill niches and maintain momentum, the big cereal
companies keep up a parade of new products. Typically, they
are either extensions of established brands, such as
Kellogg's forthcoming frosted bran flakes, or copies of
rivals' successes, like General Mills' pre-sweetened Wheaties
Honey Gold, which is strikingly similar to Kellogg's
best-selling Frosted Flakes.
   Few cereals are sold solely on their stated qualities.
Even adult or all-family varieties offer added incentives,
ranging from free liters of soda pop to tips on golfing.
In-store salespeople augment in-box promos. In Safeway Inc.
stores in the Tucson, Ariz., area, a Kellogg pitchman
recently gave away baseballs autographed by Tony the Tiger.
Kellogg also is using its sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic
team to generate videotaped Winter Olympics highlights,
bobsled-team pins and similar bonuses.
   But retailers curb some in-store promotions. Kellogg's
offer of free milk or fruit with multiple-box buys was nixed
by Shaw's Supermarkets, a New England chain, because "you
have to keep track of what a customer has purchased,"
explains a Shaw's spokeswoman. "It's labor-intensive" and can
slow the checkout process, she adds.
   To nail down buying intentions before consumers get to the
store, manufacturers are making cents-off coupons
increasingly attractive. Weekend newspapers often contain
cereal coupons worth $4 or more in all.
   Couponing is a proven merchandise mover. "Cereals you sell
a case a week of you now sell 12 or 15," says Frank Kamberos,
an owner of Treasure Island Food Stores in Chicago. One
cereal-company spokesman says the stepped-up couponing
activity in part reflects a pullback from network television
as that medium's reach becomes less certain.
   But others see a correlation between the ever-rising price
of breakfast flakes and today's increased discounting
activity. Says Ms. Wittenburg: "Couponing softens the blow."

   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. -- A long-simmering battle over cereal
ads between Kellogg Co. and state regulators escalated as the
food company sued an assistant attorney general in Texas for
slander.
   The suit, filed last week in Circuit Court of Calhoun
County, Mich., alleges that Stephen Gardner, chief of the
Dallas consumer protection office of the Texas attorney
general, "maliciously engaged in a media assault" against
Kellogg.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The action marks the latest skirmish in the cereal wars
between the food company and attorneys general of several
states. The states, including Texas, have questioned the
advertising and label claims of Kellogg cereals such as
Special K, 40+ Bran Flakes and Frosted Flakes.
   Among other things, Kellogg took exception to a Feb. 27
New York Times article in which Mr. Gardner is quoted as
saying, "Kellogg constantly lies about its products. I don't
believe anything Kellogg tells me."
   Asked about the lawsuit Friday, Mr. Gardner said "truth is
a defense" against slander. "They are liars."
   Dan Morales, Texas attorney general, said in a statement
that the suit was "an attempt to intimidate and harass a
state employee doing his job."
   Joseph M. Stewart, Kellogg's senior vice president for
corporate affairs, said Kellogg had never filed such a suit
before, but that Kellogg officials believed they had to
"defend our good name." He also said Kellogg stands by its
ads.
   In August, Kellogg asked a federal court in Iowa to block
that state's attorney general from acting against its health
claims for the three cereals. The company said at the time it
sued to end what it called "harassment" by the attorneys
general of eight states.
   Since then, several states, including Texas, have
intervened and raised counter claims against Kellogg.

<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co. has filed a lawsuit
against the Texas attorney general's office and health department
after the agencies threatened to seize its controversial
psyllium-based cereal, Heartwise.
   The move comes one week after the Battle Creek-based cereal
maker sued the Iowa attorney general's office, contending it has
harassed the company for two years over health claims on Special K,
40&plus; Bran Flakes (now called Bran Flakes) and Frosted Flakes.
   In the Texas case, the state health department has threatened to
order Heartwise pulled from store shelves if the company does not
alter the product's labeling and include potential risks of the
grain psyllium, which the company maintains can help lower
cholesterol.
   Assistant Texas Attorney General Stephen Gardner said the
product may be ``detained'' as early as Tuesday unless the company
agrees to the changes.
   Kellogg is challenging that in a suit filed Thursday in U.S.
District Court in Dallas.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked Kellogg last year to
provide data showing that psyllium, a soluble fiber that is used in
laxatives, is safe in foods and to back up its health claims. The
agency has not ruled yet.
   ``The only people who view psyllium as safe in food is
Kellogg,'' Gardner said. ``We notified them that they violated the
law in failing to warn of potential risks, such as allergic
reactions in some people, and by making claims about lowering (the)
risk of heart disease.''
   Gardner said he didn't know if there had been any consumer
complaints about the cereal, which was introduced last year.
   General Mills Inc. pulled its psyllium-based cereal, Benefit, in
January, citing poor sales.
   Kellogg maintains it never claimed Heartwise alone could reduce
risk of heart disease, but that as part of a complete nutritional
diet it may reduce elevated cholesterol, spokesman Joseph Stewart
said. He termed Texas' criticism of the product's name, a heart
symbol and mention of two hospitals on the box as ``nit-picking.''
   ``It's a disservice for these people to be harassing and
nit-picking in an attempt to keep this information from the public
on the basis it is misleading,'' Stewart said.
   ``The assistant attorney general's threat is an irresponsible
and politically motivated attack on our right to communicate
scientifically supported health information about our products to
consumers.''
   Gardner denied Stewart's allegations of political motivation and
said neither he nor Attorney General Jim Mattox were running for
office.
   Gardner said that in discussions earlier this week, Kellogg
refused the state's proposal that the company pay a $25,000 fine
without having to admit any violation of the law.
   Only Texas has questioned the Heartwise advertising. But the
same cereal health claims in question in Iowa are also being
questioned in seven other states, Stewart said.
   Stewart would not say whether the company had plans to file any
more lawsuits.
   ``Instead of being involved in this harassment, it's best to let
the courts decide,'' he said.

   The raisin wars have begun.

   Kellogg Co., based in Battle Creek, Mich., fired the first shot yesterday with a $100-million-plus lawsuit against General Foods Corp. and its advertising agency.
The provocation: nine television and print advertisements over the past two years allegedly implying that Post Natural Raisin Bran is more natural than Kellogg's Raisin Bran.

   "False and misleading," Kellogg huffed in a statement.
No comment, replied spokesmen for White Plains, N.Y.-based General Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., New York, and Grey Advertising Inc., also of New York.

   Kellogg, the No. 1 raisin bran maker, attacked No. 2 Post's ads on three fronts.
First, it said they "inaccurately claimed that the raisins . . . are natural and unprocessed."
According to the lawsuit, those raisins are coated with glycerol and coconut oil.

   Second, Kellogg said that in visual raisin vs. raisin displays, Post doctors its own raisins to look better.
"The extraneous cereal that would cling to the raisins has been cleaned off," a Kellogg spokesman charged.
He said Post bran flakes do cling to the Post raisins -- because of the glycerol and coconut oil coating.
He declined to elaborate on whether cereal also clung to Kellogg raisins and whether that was good or bad.

   The final alleged infraction is that Post advertising -- including television spots by country singer John Denver -- inaccurately imply that Post raisin bran has less sugar.
"Join me for breakfast . . . my way.
Welcome to my morning, Welcome to my day," invites Mr. Denver in one ad as he pulls up to a bowl of Post raisin bran.
"You know, people used to think what made a great raisin bran was just a couple of scoops of raisins," he adds in a veiled jibe against a Kellogg slogan.

   "Taste Post's Natural raisin bran," he continues.
"Post uses naturally sweet raisins.
They don't sugar coat them like some other raisin brans do."

   That is true, acknowledged Kellogg.
But Post does use sugar in the bran, according to the Kellogg spokesman.
"So when you compare a serving of their cereal vs. a one-ounce serving of Kellogg cereal, both products have the same amount of sugar," he added.

   Kellogg, in the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Kalamazoo, Mich., said it wants $100 million in punitive damages, as well as treble the unspecified amount of actual damages.
It also wants "corrective advertising," and a "permanent injunction prohibiting General Foods from disseminating false or misleading advertising."

   This is actually the second legal battle this year involving Kellogg and a raisin product.
Last spring, General Mills Inc. sued Kellogg over trademark infringement involving oatmeal raisin crisps and apple raisin crisps.
Kellogg filed a countersuit and those claims are still pending.

<HEAD>Kellogg Introduces New Cereal It Claims Lowers Cholesterol</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co., trying to take advantage of
consumers' increasing concerns about health, on Wednesday entered
the growing market for foods that purportedly lower cholesterol.
   Kellogg at a news conference unveiled a new cereal, Heartwise,
which contains oat bran and psyllium. The two grains are high in
soluble fiber, which is believed to help the body rid itself of
cholesterol.
   High levels of cholesterol have been shown to increase the risk
of heart disease.
   In introducing its new product, which is expected to reach stores
in the fall, Kellogg is challenging one of its biggest competitors,
General Mills Inc., whose Benefit cereal contains the same
ingredients.
   Kellogg said it would spend $40 million in the first year to
advertise and promote the new cereal. It will be marketed nationwide.
   A variety of oat bran products have exploded onto the market
since researchers said the grain could help reduce cholesterol
levels. But psyllium, a grain grown mainly in India, is a relative
newcomer in terms of foods connected with healthy hearts, although
it has been used for years in laxatives such as Procter &amp; Gamble
Co.'s Metamucil.
   The outer husk of psyllium contains soluble fiber that has been
shown to reduce cholesterol, the cereal makers claim.
   General Mills' promotion of Benefit has been challenged by
Procter &amp; Gamble, which was ordered by the Food and Drug
Administration to refrain from advertising health claims for
Metamucil. Procter &amp; Gamble contends psyllium is a drug and should
be regulated by the FDA.
   However, the FDA, instead of declaring psyllium a drug _ and
thereby forcing companies to undergo lengthy approval procedures _
is developing a regulation governing health claims on product labels
including foods such as cereal.
   Other cereals made by Kellogg, based in Battle Creek Mich.,
include Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies.
   Heartwise will be targeted to consumers age 35 and older, but
Kellogg is planning an advertising campaign that promotes the
cereal's benefits for children as well as adults.

   Kellogg Co., the nation's largest
maker of ready-to-eat cereals, plans a 5 percent cut in its U.S.
white-collar work force of about 2,900 by year's end, the company
said.
   The approximately 145 jobs to be cut will be achieved
selectively, mainly through attrition, said Kellogg spokesman Neil
Nyberg.
   ``We'll be examining all our U.S. operations and making
determinations about how our organization needs to be best staffed
to meet competitive challenges,'' he said.
   Kellogg has 1,400 salaried employees based at its Battle Creek,
Mich., headquarters. The total U.S. work force of the country's
largest cereal maker is 9,000.
   Kellogg's cereal market lead has been eroded this year by No. 2
General Mills Inc., and company officials have said they expect
1989 earnings, due out this month, to show the first decline in
annual earnings in 37 years.
   Kellogg's brand cereals include, among others, Rice Krispies,
Frosted Flakes, Special K and Froot Loops.
   Nyberg said Wednesday the reductions began in late 1989.

   Snap, crackle, ouch]
   Prices of breakfast cereals are going up about 4%, or 12
cents on a $3 box, and consumers will start paying more soon.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the past two weeks, three of the biggest makers of
ready-to-eat cereals in the U.S. have notified the grocery
trade of higher prices. The latest was General Mills Inc.,
which yesterday said it is raising prices an average of 4%
immediately.
   That move follows a 3.7% average price increase by
market-leader Kellogg Co. over the weekend. Quaker Oats Co.
kicked off this year's round of increases -- annual price
gains are becoming an industry tradition -- with a boost
averaging about 5%.
   As yet, Ralston Purina Co., the Post division of Philip
Morris Cos.' Kraft General Foods unit, and the Nabisco Brands
unit of RJR Nabisco haven't followed suit. "We're studying
what everybody's doing," said a Nabisco spokesman.
   If the entire industry boosts prices an average of 4% and
consumers don't balk at the increase, it would mean at least
$300 million in additional sales in the $7.5 billion domestic
ready-to-eat category. In the past, consumers have gulped at
rising prices, but continued to buy their breakfast staple
nonetheless.
   "We felt it necessary to do it now to maintain our margins
in the face of rising costs," a Quaker spokesman said, citing
ingredients, packaging and labor. Quaker has a 7.4% share of
the U.S. cold-cereal market. Its price increases don't
include hot cereals, a category the company dominates.
   General Mills Vice Chairman Arthur Schulze, defending his
company's increase, said that oats -- a primary ingredient in
several of its cereals -- cost 15% more than last year, while
wheat is up 17%. Raisins, almonds and other food ingredients
also have risen, as has the price of recycled paper,
increasingly popular as a packaging material, Mr. Schulze
said.
   "It shouldn't be surprising these advances occur about the
same time because we all are looking at the same costs," he
said. "We all rely on grain as our principal ingredient. . .
. When we see dramatic increases in costs we inevitably
adjust our prices."
   Last year the company, which has a 29% share of the
domestic market, raised cereal prices 5.9%.
   Market-leader Kellogg, with about a 39% share, this year
raised prices across the board; in November the company had
exempted Corn Flakes and Frosted Flakes, apparently to
protect those core brands against share erosion.
   While the increases by Kellogg's range from 3% to 5%, Corn
Flakes will go up only 2.4%. A company spokesman noted it was
the first price increase for the flagship product since April
1989.

   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. -- Kellogg Co. reported record results
for the first quarter, reflecting continued strong overseas
sales and an accelerating turnaround in the U.S.
   The world's largest cereal company said earnings rose 69%,
to $163.1 million, or $1.35 a share, from $96.3 million, or
79 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales increased nearly 18%,
to $1.42 billion from $1.2 billion. But the company cautioned
against multiplying by four to calculate full-year figures as
it forecasted an "extremely challenging" year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   While an intense sales effort domestically was paying off,
last year's first quarter was soft. Moreover, officials
acknowledged that competition from Ralston Purina Co. and
other private-label competitors has kept Kellogg from raising
prices as much as it might like on such core brands as corn
flakes and raisin bran.
   The company also said that its biggest children's cereal
introduction in several years, Bigg Mixx, wasn't meeting
expectations. "It's just not there," said William E. LaMothe,
chairman and chief executive officer. Kellogg introduced the
product with much fanfare last year.
   Mr. LaMothe said early sales of the company's newest
cereal, Cinnamon Mini Buns, were encouraging. But he said
that high marketing costs associated with rollouts would
result in more rigorous testing of future cereals; two may be
introduced domestically this year, and one is likely to be a
presweetened product, he said.
   Arnold Langbo, Kellogg's recently named president, said at
the annual meeting here Friday that Kellogg had boosted its
share of the domestic ready-to-eat cereal market to 38.8% in
the first quarter from 37.5% in the previous quarter.
   The gain came partly at the expense of runner-up General
Mills Inc., whose tonnage share Kellogg said had slipped to
23.8% from 24.3%. Ralston, the Nabisco unit of RJR Nabisco
Inc., and the Post unit of Kraft General Foods, a subsidiary
of Philip Morris Cos., also gave up market share, Kellogg
said.
   The company credited the end of the oat-bran fad, which
had made General Mills's Cheerios the nation's top-selling
brand, for some of its bottom-line improvement in the U.S.
   Overseas, Kellogg remains undisputed king, with what Mr.
Langbo said was a 51.1% share. The company sells in 130
countries, and Mr. Langbo said it is developing omnibus TV
commercials that can be easily customized for each market,
thus reducing marketing costs.
   In response to inquiries from shareholders, Mr. LaMothe
said Kellogg's board was studying the possibility of a stock
split, although he said no decision had been made. Kellogg
closed last Friday at $95.50, unchanged, in composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.

   General Mills Inc., which concedes that the health-claims controversy over its new Benefit cereal has hurt sales, is revising the product's advertising pitch.

   Two-minute television spots, known as "advertorials" because of their informational approach, were scheduled to begin running last night in major Midwestern markets where the cereal is sold.
The advertorial format allows a company to convey much more information than it can in a typical 30-second commercial.
General Mills positioned the spots around evening news shows.

   As part of its marketing makeover for Benefit, General Mills this week ran full-page newspaper advertisements and it held a news conference in New York on Tuesday to back up Benefit's cholesterol-lowering claim.

   Moreover, to gain attention and credibility, the company hired former tennis pro Arthur Ashe to appear in the television spots.
Mr. Ashe, the victim of a heart attack in 1979 that halted his career, says his cholesterol level at the time was an ominous 264. {Mr.
Ashe previously did ads for Bufferin, which cited studies indicating that aspirin can help prevent second heart attacks.}

   Benefit derives its name and health claim from the large amount of soluble fiber it contains.
The new print ads note that the soluble fiber in Benefit is eight times that of oat bran, which it contains.
But it also has beet fiber, rice and psyllium husks.
It is the psyllium that has brought Benefit under fire from rival cereal makers and has raised questions at the Food and Drug Administration about health claims on foods.

   "We're concerned that there's been a lot of unfavorable publicity," General Mills vice chairman Arthur Schulze said, adding that it has hurt sales of the new cereal.

   Before introducing Benefit last April, General Mills paid for a 14-week dietary experiment, done at the University of Minnesota, with 38 men thought to have high cholesterol levels in their blood.
When put on a low-fat diet, those who ate bowls of Benefit every day for six weeks experienced greater declines in their cholesterol counts than did those who ate corn flakes {a mainstay at General Mills' chief rival, Kellogg Co.}

   According to General Mills, the test found that the low-fat diet alone lowered every subject's cholesterol about 3%, but that those who also ate Benefit achieved an additional 6% decline while the corn flakes eaters had none.
The Minnesota study is believed to be the only one showing a direct link between psyllium consumption and reduced cholesterol.
Numerous others have correlated high fiber with lower cholesterol.

   Boxes of Benefit advertise it as "the high soluble fiber cereal shown to reduce cholesterol when part of a low-fat diet."
But the words "reduce cholesterol" are in much larger type that the rest of the message.
Each box also contains warnings about possible allergic reaction to psyllium, and recommends that children don't eat as much of the cereal as adults.

   Psyllium is the primary bulk ingredient in such laxatives as Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s Metamucil. {Procter &amp; Gamble has protested General Mills' claim for Benefit since it has been unable to win FDA approval for a similar cholesterol-reducing claim for Metamucil, which is regulated as a drug.}

   The FDA is expected to notify General Mills within a few days that it wants more information about the claims.
Mr. Schulze said the company decided not wait for the letter before changing its emphasis to "a more educational campaign.

   "In no way have we backed off on our claims," he said.
"The product is in the public interest."

   Late last month Kellogg introduced a psyllium-fortified cereal called Heartwise, and attacked General Mills without name, suggesting that the industry adopt standards for appropriate health claims for foods.
Then last week Quaker Oats Co. issued its own proposed set of standards.
Quaker, which is big on oat-bran products, also went out of its way to say it "will not add psyllium to a cereal product until either the FDA definitively deals with the subject or a credible base of scientific research says it is proper to do so."

   Alluding to the competitors' outcrys, Mr. Schulze said General Mills believes "it's the responsibility of the FDA to establish policies on this matter."

General Mills Inc. plans to spend about $65 million for the national
introductions of Basic 4 and Triples -- breakfast cereals that it hopes will
generate tasty profits.
</P>
<P>
The promotional cost, estimated at $35 million for Triples and $30 million for
Basic 4 over at least a year, is in line with the national rollout costs for
cereals.
</P>
<P>
Introducing a cereal costs $20 million to $30 million, said a spokesman for
rival Kellogg Co. in Battle Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
The expense of national rollouts and the proliferation of brands already on
supermarket shelves, from 90 to more than 200 depending on the store, caused
cereal introductions to slow in the past year, said William Maguire, an analyst
with Merrill Lynch Research in New York.
</P>
<P>
"The industry has come to realize the high cost of new-product introduction and
realized that when you go to the market place . . . you've got to introduce a
product that has some potential," said Kellogg's Joe Stewart, senior vice
president of corporate affairs.
</P>
<P>
Add to rollout costs the budgets for promoting existing brands -- figures not
disclosed by the cereal companies for competitive reasons -- and marketing
costs for breakfast cereals are tremendous.
</P>
<P>
But the payoffs are great. U.S. retail cereal sales total anywhere from $5.5
billion to $7 billion a year, according to industry sources and stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, if a cereal achieves even a 1% share of such a large market,
"you have a very successful cereal," said Craig Shulstad, a spokesman for
General Mills, based in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
"If you're looking at 1%, that translates into sales of $70 million in the
first year," he said. "That $70 million is a good return on an investment of
$35 million."
</P>
<P>
Shulstad said cereal is purchased by 95 of every 100 households. At any time, a
household has more than one brand, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cereal consumption grew at about 3% a year from 1985 to 1989. In per-capita
terms, the growth in consumption was even stronger, said John Bierbusse, an
analyst with A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
But consumption slowed in 1990, Bierbusse said, partly because cereal price
increases in the previous five years outpaced the consumer price index. Another
factor, he said, was a loss in volume by industry leader Kellogg.
</P>
<P>
"Their brand-name products have faced competition from General Mills, most
notably, in selling products that have either better nutritional positioning or
are more elaborate and have better price value," he said. "At the other end of
the spectrum, their more mundane branded products, things like Corn Flakes and
Raisin Bran, have suffered some market share erosion to private-label products
who compete on the basis of price."
</P>
<P>
When measured in terms of tonnage sold, Bierbusse said, Kellogg has a 38%
market share, followed by General Mills with 24%; General Foods Corp., 11%;
Quaker Oats Co., 7%; Ralston Purina Co., 6%; Nabisco Brands Inc., 4.5%; private
labels, 6%, and all others, 2.5%.
</P>
<P>
Bierbusse said "it is a fact that the industry leader has not been able to
introduce a successful new-product for the last several years."
</P>
<P>
Kellogg's Stewart said the company is active in new product introductions.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to Oat Bake, "introduced at the height of the oat craze," Common
Sense Oat Bran and Ken Mei Rice Bran, introduced recently.
</P>
<P>
Stewart said the key factor for success in the industry is the quality of a
company's cereals, "the ability to provide customers with that value," rather
than the quantity of brands available.
</P>
<P>
The characteristics of a successful cereal have changed little since Kellogg
introduced its Corn Flakes in 1906, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It has to taste right. It has to offer value to the customer, and it has to be
in line with the perceived consumer need on health, fitness -- whatever that
consumer is looking for," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Kellogg is "extremely optimistic" about the cereal market's future,
despite limited growth this year. Growth in the near future may be limited, he
said, adding that health considerations position cereal to do well over the
long term.
</P>
<P>
"When you consider the health ramifications and the fact our society is moving
from a treatment society to a disease-prevention society, then these
grain-based products will play an increasingly meaningful role in a healthy
diet," he said.

   Kellogg Co., citing "intense competition" in the U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market, said third-quarter earnings would be below last year's record $145.7 million, or $1.18 a share.

   As a result, stock of the world's largest cereal maker fell $2.25 a share, to close at $71.375, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.
At one point the stock was off more than $3.

   Kellogg said it still expects higher earnings for the year and that it remains optimistic about long-term growth prospects.
Last year, the company had net income of $480.4 million, or $3.90 a share, on sales of $4.3 billion.

   Although it still has about 37% of the domestic cereal market, Kellogg lately has been giving up share to its chief rival, General Mills Inc., which has been better able to capitalize on the oat-bran craze.

   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. food analyst Nomi Ghez said Kellogg's earnings projection for the quarter just ended reflects a combination of "very tough competition and some mistakes they made."
While General Mills rolled out another Cheerios-brand variety, Kellogg misread the country's appetite for oat-bran, she said.

   "Instead of going after more good-for-you cereals, they decided to go after nostalgia," Ms. Ghez said, noting that Kellogg's big product introduction for the year was to have been the graham-flour-based S.W. Graham cereal.
Moreover, she said, Kellogg "didn't put enough promotional money behind basic products," so has seen declines in such staples as Corn Flakes.

   Following Kellogg's announcement, the analyst reduced her third-quarter estimate to $1 from $1.20.
For the year she estimates earnings of $3.95.

   Last month Kellogg said that its president, Horst W. Schroeder, had suddenly resigned.
He had been widely regarded as the company's next chief executive officer.

<HEAD>Kellogg Co. Claims New Cereal Reduces Cholesterol</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout, including company plans and refusal to comment;
no pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co. is expected to enter the
fray over an ingredient that purportedly reduces cholesterol on
Wednesday when it introduces its ``Heartwise'' cereal.
   Heartwise contains oat bran and psyllium, which is used in
General Mills' Benefit cereal. Psyllium is a grain grown mainly in
India. The outer husk of psyllium contains soluble fiber that has
been shown to reduce cholesterol, the cereal makers claim.
   Promotion of Benefit by General Mills Inc., which also makes such
cereals as Cheerios, Wheaties and Lucky Charms, was challenged by
Procter &amp; Gamble Co., which was ordered by the Food and Drug
Administration to refrain from advertising health claims for its
Metamucil laxative, which contains psyllium. Proctor &amp; Gamble
contends psyllium is a drug.
   Instead of declaring psyllium a drug _ which would force
companies to undergo lengthy approval procedures _ the FDA is
developing a regulation governing health claims on product labels.
   Kellogg, whose cereals include Corn Flakes and Rice Krispies, has
scheduled a news conference Wednesday in New York at which it says
experts in disease prevention will discuss cholesterol and a product
will be introduced.
   However, the company would not comment on reports in the trade
publication Advertising Age that it is expected to reiterate its
stand on making strong health claims for its products. Inquiries
were referred to Jeffrey L. Christmas of the New York public
relations firm of Hill and Knowlton, who said the company would not
confirm or deny the reports today.
   Heartwise, which will be targeted to consumers age 35 and older,
will reach stores this fall.

   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. -- More news from the Russian
revolution: corn flakes. Kellogg Co. says it will build a
cereal plant in Riga, the capital of Latvia, to supply Russia
and other Soviet republics, as well as the newly independent
Baltic states. The plant initially will make two of Kellogg's
best-sellers, corn flakes and Frosted Flakes, probably using
grains grown in the Ukraine, a company spokesman says.
   Until now Kellogg, the world's largest cereal maker, has
had only limited product distribution in the region. But
three years of talks with Latvians blossomed recently, as
political events made the investment more realistic.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company says it entered into the manufacturing and
marketing joint venture with Adazi Inc., a cooperative owned
by its 5,500 Latvian employees. Adazi, which will provide
land for the factory, already produces potato and dairy
products as well as furniture and plastic packaging.
   Kellogg will hold majority control in the venture, and
will supply management and technical know-how for the plant,
expected to open in 1993.

<HL> Kellogg Agrees It Won't Run Some Cereal Ads --- Pact With New York State Covers Rice Krispies Ads Promoting B Vitamins </HL>

   Kellogg Co. agreed not to run certain advertisements for Rice Krispies in New York after the attorney general there accused the company of false advertising.

   New York Attorney General Robert Abrams alleged that Kellogg's ads promoting the high vitamin B content of its Rice Krispies cereal were misleading.
The ads in question implied that the B vitamins would give consumers added physical energy and vigor, the attorney general alleged.
Kellogg said it discontinued the ads in question last September as part of the company's normal marketing strategy.

   While the Battle Creek, Mich.-based food company denies any wrongdoing, it agreed not to run those ads again in New York and to pay the attorney general's office $10,000 to cover costs of the investigation.
A company spokesman declined to comment whether Kellogg has plans to run the ads in other states.

   The New York settlement is part of a recent effort by states to examine health claims made in food ads.
The National Association of Attorneys General recently set up a task force to look at such ads.

   Moreover, a group of eight states is jointly investigating dozens of food companies for making misleading health claims, including ads that mislead consumers into believing that some foods are low in such substances as cholesterol, sugar and fat, according to Barbara Tuerkheimer, an assistant Wisconsin attorney general.

   Such efforts worry the ad industry, which argues that regulation should be done by the federal government, not by the states.
"If you have attorneys general coming up with different results in different states, then it would make it impossible to run national ads," said Wally Snyder, senior vice president of the American Advertising Federation.

   In the Kellogg case, the company ran ads that, according to Mr. Abrams, misled consumers into believing that additional B vitamins would give them extra energy and that fatigue signaled a deficiency of the vitamins.
Kellogg argued that consumers weren't misled, and that, in fact, B vitamins "convert food into energy usable by the body."

   "Unfortunately, what many people think of when they think of food giving them energy is pep and enthusiasm," says Phyllis Stumbo, a research nutritionist at the University of Iowa's medical school.
"While vitamin B is required to get energy from food, that doesn't mean you're going to feel energetic."

   Separately, Kellogg in recent weeks quietly recalled 30,000 cases of Rice Krispies the company said were accidentally overfortified with iron during production.
A Kellogg spokesman said the error gave the cereal "an off flavor."

   Kellogg said the error presented no health hazard, so it didn't announce the recall publicly.
Instead, it ordered its field force to pick up the suspect boxes.
The company couldn't say how many packages were affected as the production involved several sizes.
Nor would it say how many have been recovered.

   The cases were produced in Kellogg's Memphis, Tenn., plant and were stamped with the markings "better if used before" June 22, 23 or 24, 1989, with a letter M following the dates.
Rice Krispies typically has a one-year recommended shelf life.

   A similar episode subsequently occurred at the Battle Creek plant, on two batches of Frosted Mini-Wheats biscuits.
In that instance, 2,400 cases, or about 28,800 packages of cereal, were sprayed with excessive amounts of vitamin A.
The company said consumers might experience a tingling or burning sensation in the mouth after eating the product.
Those boxes, stamped "better if used before" Aug. 2, 1989, include the codes BC117 or BC118.

   That error occurred on two production lines only on the late-night shift, the company said.
A spokesman said that while that mistake might cause "a short-term discomfort," it wasn't a health hazard.
But he acknowledged that Kellogg had reported both production mistakes to the Food and Drug Administration.
Kellogg said it was investigating how both incidents could have occurred.

   One oatmeal box promises to reduce cholesterol.
A rival package says its ingredients promote healthy skin, aid digestion and even help heal wounds.
Another cereal alludes to cancer prevention.

   As cereal companies make their section of the supermarket sound more like a drugstore, government regulators, medical groups and consumer advocates are raising objections.
General Mills Inc., for example, can't sell its new Benefit cereal in Texas until it substantiates the product's reputed cholesterol-lowering properties.

   In an effort to mollify the regulators, Kellogg Co. issued a call yesterday for the industry to police itself.
The biggest U.S. cereal maker proposed a marketing guide that seeks to differentiate between advertised "health messages" and "health claims."

   The Battle Creek, Mich., company says manufacturers should provide a "health message" about a total diet that may include the product.
An inappropriate "health claim" would be one that touts a specific product or ingredient as preventing or treating a disease.
"Any statement regarding a specific food that goes beyond the concept of a total diet . . . should be subjected to {the Food and Drug Administration's} regulatory approval process," Kellogg contends.

   Kellogg urged that even health "messages" be used only where they can be supported by what it called "adequately substantiated scientific studies" -- a concept it didn't immediately define.

   "This is unquestionably an indirect shot at General Mills," says John McMillin, food analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., noting the questions raised about the study cited in General Mills' advertising for Benefit.
As for how one can distinguish between a "claim" and a "message," he says, "it's a very fine line."

   Kellogg also seemed to send a mixed message.
Even as it proposed the industry standard, the company rolled out a new cereal called "Heartwise," a name that seems to make a health claim.
Kellogg says Heartwise has more soluble fiber than any other ready-to-eat cereal.
That's important, Kellogg contends, because "health experts" recommend that Americans eat more fiber as part of a good diet.

   The health-claims issue currently is being tackled by the FDA and Congress, which are drafting new food-labeling laws.
But several states, weary of that protracted process, are starting to act on their own.
In Texas, where General Mills just this week met again over the Benefit issue, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Gardner says he has misgivings about any health claim or message.
"Heart attacks are way too serious to put on cereal boxes or in 30-second TV spots," he says.

   General Mills isn't the only cereal company to come under Mr. Gardner's scrutiny.
He has been talking with Quaker Oats Co. for more than a year over the cereal maker's claims that oatmeal reduces the risk of heart disease.
"Quaker is hyping a product," he says.
"If you have cholesterol problems, you don't see Quaker.
You see your doctor."

   Ronald Bottrell, a spokesman for Quaker in Chicago, cites several studies that found that "both oatmeal and oat bran, as part of a low-fat diet, helped contribute to a cholesterol reduction."
He especially notes one study, done at Northwestern University Medical School, which Quaker helped to fund.
As for Kellogg's call for self-policing, Mr. Bottrell says, "Food manufacturers should be able to show a link between their products and any health-related effects they could have -- provided it is based on reliable scientific research."

   In Minneapolis, a General Mills official took issue with Kellogg's proposal.
"My feeling is that the consumer is not going to see a difference between a health message and a health claim," said Vice Chairman Arthur Schulze.
"It looks like they've made a distinction without a difference."

   Self-regulation may be in for a grilling.
According to Norine Olson-Elm of the Minnesota attorney general's office of consumer affairs, "We're not scientists, but we can rely on experts as well as companies can, and we will be doing that."

   The FDA plans hearings around the country, beginning in October, on food labeling.
"We expect health claims will be the most contentious issue," says agency spokesman Jeff Nesbit.
"Our plan is, by early next year, to propose a regulation that covers the entire range of food labeling . . . .
Consumers want a change."

   Indeed they do, says a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association, which is developing its version of the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval in response to requests from perplexed shoppers.
Called "HeartGuide," the program will review various foods for their ability to help reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Those items that pass association guidelines -- manufacturers will pay for the product evaluation -- would bear an endorsement sticker.

   Kellogg Co. settled lawsuits with six states over
advertised health claims for two breakfast cereals.
   Under the settlement, the company agreed to pay
California, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Texas and Wisconsin
$30,000 each, for consumer or nutrition education programs.

   Kellogg and the states -- known informally as the "Food
Cops" because of their vigorous attempts to curb what they
regard as health hype -- had sued and countersued over
advertising for Special K and 40+ Bran Flakes. One ad
upsetting the states had said that consumers eating Special K
could "keep the muscle, lose the fat."
   A company spokesman said the statements in dispute no
longer are being used, so the settlement won't require
changes in current advertising. Kellogg, based in Battle
Creek, Mich., characterized the $180,000 payment as "a
portion of our savings in legal costs."

   The oat cereal war is heating up.
Kellogg Co., which makes neither an oatmeal nor any other cooked cereal, is introducing a ready-to-eat product that can be heated as well as eaten right out of the box.

   Moreover, the product, called Oatbake, bears a striking similarity to rival General Mills Inc.'s oat-based powerhouse, Cheerios.
The cereal will come in rings about the size of a dime, a spokeswoman said.

   A combination of whole-kernel oats, corn and wheat bran, Oatbake will come in two varieties -- Raisin Nut and Honey Bran.
Among Kellogg's recent efforts to capitalize on oats' nutritional popularity was Cracklin' Oat Bran cereal.

   While Oatbake is designed primarily for eating cold, the cereal's boxes will include directions for heating Oatbake with milk, either in a microwave oven or on the range top.
The company said yesterday it expects "significant incremental consumption as a hot cereal" as well as a snack.

   Kellogg said it would roll out the product this fall with its largest cereal advertising and promotion budget ever.
The company wouldn't disclose any figures, but noted that it would exceed the $33 million spent to introduce Mueslix in 1987.
Most ad dollars will go into television, the company said.
Leo Burnett Co., Chicago, will produce the spots.

KELLOGG TO FIRE NEW SALVO IN OAT BRAN WAR;

CEREAL GIANT'S SECOND NEW PRODUCT TO DEBUT

<P>
Kellogg Co. will put the crackle back into the oat bran war this morning when
it introduces its new cereal Heartwise, a bran-and-psyllium breakfast food and
its second new product in as many weeks.
</P>
<P>
Heartwise and Oatbake, which was introduced last Thursday, are an effort by the
Battle Creek, Mich., cereal giant to work its way back into the nation's
breakfast bowls and gain ground lost to General Mills Inc., maker of oat-based
Cheerios and Benefit.
</P>
<P>
In addition to oat bran, Benefit also contains a controversial grain called
psyllium, which is grown in India and is high in soluble fiber. General Mills
was the first to manufacture a bran-and-psyllium cereal, introducing Benefit
last April. Kellogg became a quick No. 2 with Heartwise.
</P>
<P>
"What is happening here last week and this week is that Kellogg is positioning
itself to benefit from the demand for oat-based products," said Harry Segalas,
analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York. "General Mills has been gaining
share because they're very well positioned."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Aggressive Marketing Campaign
</P>
<P>
The oat bran craze began about two years ago, with a diet book called "The
Eight-Week Cholesterol Cure" by Robert E. Kowalski, said Timothy S. Ramey, food
industry analyst for County NatWest Securities USA in New York.
</P>
<P>
"One of the things the book had in there was that oat bran reduced cholesterol
levels," Ramey said. "It had been substantiated a year earlier by a scientific
study. This guy was the first to market the idea. Quaker then picked it up and
started touting it."
</P>
<P>
When "The Eight-Week Cholesterol Cure" was published, General Mills already had
an oat-based product on the market: that staple of early morning eating called
Cheerios. In April, the company introduced Benefit.
</P>
<P>
General Mills followed with an aggressive marketing campaign that touted the
cereal's cholesterol-reducing properties, crediting soluble fiber-filled oat
bran and psyllium. Studies have linked soluble fiber and a low-fat diet with
reduced cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
"There is a very strong demand for cholesterol reduction in the diet and a
tremendous explosion in the oat bran cereals in the past two years, the last 12
months in particular," said Lawrence Adelman, food analyst at Dean Witter
Reynolds in New York. "An important part of cereal consumption in the last few
years has been very dramatically driven by health considerations."
</P>
<P>
It is just those considerations -- coupled with General Mills' market share --
that have driven Kellogg to double the number of oat-based cereals that it
offers, industry watchers say. Oat-based cereals such as Benefit and Cheerios
account for about 40% of General Mills' cereal volume, Adelman said, compared
to only 10% for Kellogg.
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that General Mills is gaining some share and Kellogg has
lost some share, a moderate shift," he said. "But Kellogg is coming back like
gang busters."
</P>
<P>
Until last Thursday, Kellogg's bit of the bran bonanza consisted of Common
Sense Oat Bran and Cracklin' Oat Bran. Six days ago, the company introduced
Oatbake, a whole oats cereal that can be eaten hot or cold, Ramey said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FDA Developing Rules
</P>
<P>
And this morning, Ramey said, Heartwise will burst upon the bran world during
-- appropriately enough -- a breakfast news conference at New York's Waldorf
Astoria Hotel. A Kellogg's spokesman would only confirm that company Chairman
William E. LaMothe will introduce a new product and make a "major policy
announcement."
</P>
<P>
But before the announcement and the product introduction, "leading members of
the scientific community, in the area of disease prevention . . . will discuss
recent research findings on lowering blood cholesterol," according to a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
Kathryn Newton, a spokeswoman for General Mills, said she knew nothing about
Heartwise, except that it sounds a lot like her company's controversial cereal
Benefit. Soon after Benefit was released, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. asked the
Food and Drug Administration to pull the psyllium-based cereal from market
shelves.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the FDA is developing a regulation governing health claims on product
labels.
</P>
<P>
Psyllium is also a part of Metamucil, Procter &amp; Gamble's fiber laxative.
Procter &amp; Gamble had asked the FDA to allow the company to make
cholesterol-lowering claims for Metamucil, but the agency said more tests are
needed.
</P>
<P>
Procter &amp; Gamble contends that Benefit is actually a drug and should meet
drug-testing requirements.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Donald B. Hunninghake, director of the Heart Disease Prevention Clinic at
the University of Minnesota, supervised the General Mills studies on its
Benefit cereal. According to the study, a two-ounce serving of Benefit --
coupled with a low-fat diet, resulted in a 5.9% decrease in blood cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of how (oat bran and psyllium) lower cholesterol, I don't think
scientifically we know for sure," Hunninghake said.
</P>
<P>
But it's easy to see what they do for cereal sales.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. ready-to-eat cereal market is enjoying phenomenal growth this year,"
Segalas said, who estimates that oat-bran cereals account for about $1.5
billion of the $7-billion cereal industry.
</P>
<P>
"The volume for the industry is at a 5% clip," he said. "The reason is that
there's been a very strong demand for oat-based products. Historically this
market has grown at a 3% to 4% annual rate. "

<TEXT>     Here at home, my problems began in the cereal aisle. I had never given much
thought to the cereal aisle. But all of a sudden I felt confused. It was the
Cheerios. Actually it was the fact that they also had Honey Nut Cheerios.;   I
picked the Cheerios because they are healthy. Then I thought about all the
times you buy something healthy and your kids don't eat it. So I put the
Cheerios down and got the Honey Nut Cheerios.;   And I was content with my
selection until, on my way to decide between fresh-squeezed or
from-concentrate or country-style orange juice, I saw the Shredded Wheat.;   I
always liked Shredded Wheat. So I picked up a box. But then I remembered
gagging on big chunks of it when I was a kid. So I put them down and got the
spoon-size Shredded Wheat. And I was about to leave when I saw frosted
Shredded Wheat.;   Now I had a headache. I thought about going to another
aisle for some Bayer. But it was really more of an Excedrin headache. Maybe I
should just go with the Bufferin. But they say Tylenol is safer. Or Advil.;
I didn't know what to do. I started up the aisle, then I turned back. That's
when I realized the whole aisle was cereal. On one side, anyway. I felt
intimidated.;   The other side was mostly dog food.;   While looking at Cycle
1, 2, 3 and 4, and trying to determine my own dog's stage in life, I began to
sweat. I looked back at the cereal and saw a new one. It's called Common
Sense. I felt better.;   But as I reached for it, out of the corner of my eye
I saw Just Right. I didn't know whether to go with the fruit and nuts Just
Right or fiber nuggets Just Right.;   It was something of a religious
experience when I saw Life. Because really, the cereal aisle is all about
life. And cinnamon life.;   I imagined the great American heartland, all those
farmers out there working the earth, reaping the harvest, their tractors
chugging over fields of Fruity Pebbles. And Cocoa Pebbles. And Dino Pebbles.;
 I found myself wondering how they puff rice. Do they use the same process to
make Puffed Wheat?;   What's better for you, Fiber 1, Basic 4, or Product 19?
And what's worse, Lucky Charms, Trix or Marshmallow Alpha Bits?;   They say
bran is good. But they don't specify Raisin Bran, 100% Bran, Fruitful Bran,
All Bran, Bran Flakes, Cracklin' Oat Bran, or the aforementioned Common Sense
Oat Bran.;   You should probably just go with Total. Or are you better off
with Total Corn Flakes?;   I imagined walking down this aisle with people who
have never been out of the Soviet Union. I was personally embarrassed by Froot
Loops.;   Yo, Boris, you in the mood for Captain Crunch, or you wanna go with
the Peanut Butter Crunch?;   They have a cereal called Prince of Thieves.
Robin Hood is on the box.;   Remember Rice Krispies? Now there's Fruity
Marshmallow Krispies. And Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Cereal. And Tiny Toon
Adventure Cereal.;   They have Count Chocula. And a fruity cousin, Franken
Berry. But you do not begin to realize the richness of culture, the depth of
society, the integrity of marketing, until you see that there's a special
cereal for the parent who's completely lost control.;   Cookie Crisp. I guess
they couldn't call it Common Sense Cookie Crisp.;   Fix yourself a bowl of
cookies, Junior. And here, why not pour some Cinnamon Mini-Buns in there,
too?;   I spent two hours in the cereal aisle. I bought Honey Bunches of Oats
because the picture showed what looked like fiber nuggets. At breakfast, my
son looked at the box and then looked at me and said:;   "Is this the only
cereal we have?"  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
Most people do not eat barley - they drink it in beer or whiskey. But David
and Victor Lewis, who run an independent research and development operation
for food products and processes called Byron Agricultural, of Sydney, intend
to change that.
Waxy barley - so called because it has opaque waxy-looking grains - may be
just what the fibre-conscious, cholesterol-cutting public wants. The barley
contains high levels of beta-glucan, a soluble fibre which has been shown to
help reduce cholesterol levels.
David Lewis has developed a process for making expanded products (like
puffed wheat and rice) from waxy cereals. Rex Oram, a plant breeder at
Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation
(CSIRO), provided Lewis with waxy barley to try out his process. One type
worked well and they named it Waxiro.
Kellogg Australia entered into a deal with CSIRO and Lewis to use the grain
in its cereal products. 'The key thing is that Waxiro is high in soluble
fibre, as high as oat bran,' says Geoff Houldsworth, Kellogg's product R&amp;D
manager. 'But this is a whole grain. It is much nicer to eat a whole grain
than bran.'
Kellogg made a barley oat bran-flake known as Balance, although the
marketing still focuses on the oat content. The flake product is relatively
easy to make because the whole grain and bran bind together easily. Waxiro
also has a relatively low fat content - 1 per cent compared with 9 per cent
for oats, and is cheaper than oat bran.
An interesting aspect of the technology is the use of enzymes. 'We've found
we can get unique effects on crispness and texture of grains by using
enzymes at very low moisture content,' says David Lewis.
The method is a straight-line process, not a batch process, and uses similar
enzymes to those which convert the starch in barley to malt. This is what
makes the flakes light, he says, and allows them to be made with whole grain
products.

<HEAD>Kellogg Recalls Frosted Mini-Wheats With Too Much Vitamin A</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kellogg Co. has announced a 25-state
recall of about 29,000 boxes of Frosted Mini-Wheats Biscuits cereal
that may contain too much vitamin A and cause a burning sensation
in the mouth.
   The giant cereal maker also said Thursday it had withdrawn an
unspecified number of boxes of Rice Krispies cereal at distribution
points because they may contain ten times more iron than normal.
   The levels of vitamin A found in 16-ounce and 20-ounce boxes of
Frosted Mini-Wheats coded BC117 and BC118 with the expiration date
of Aug. 2, 1989, may cause short-term discomfort such as a burning,
tingling sensation in the mouth, but will not cause any major
health risks, company spokesman Joe Stewart said.
   The levels of iron found in Rice Krispies with the code dates
June 22-24, 1989, and the letter ``M'' are at 100 percent of the
U.S. recommended daily allowance, but would not produce any health
threat, Stewart said. The product normally contains 10 percent of
the U.S. RDA of iron.
   In both cases, the cereals may not taste right, Stewart said.
   Stewart said he knew of three or four complaints to the company
about the Frosted Mini-Wheats from Michigan consumers since
Wednesday. At least one consumer experienced a burning sensation
after eating the cereal.
   The cereal normally contains 25 percent of the U.S. RDA of
vitamin A, and some of the recalled boxes have contained as much as
four times that amount, Stewart said.
   The Detroit district of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
said it had been advised of the recall and the withdrawal.
   Kellogg advised consumers with the affected Frosted Mini-Wheats
not to eat any of the product and return the entire package top
with the code dates to the company.
   In the case of the Rice Krispies, the company stopped
distributing the affected product Aug. 10, but no consumer recall
will be ordered, Stewart said. He said any consumer dissatisfied
with the product may follow the directions listed on the box for
return of the product.
   The states affected by the recall of the Frosted Mini-Wheats
are: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,
Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Maryland, Montana,
Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin.

   A multimillionaire who nearly died from a
heart attack 22 years ago has spent $2 million on a crusade to
pressure food industry giants into making healthier products, but
the companies say his criticisms are misguided.
   Phil Sokolof, 65, placed advertisments in newspapers this week
depicting nine products he says are portrayed as healthy foods, but
are ``poisoning'' Americans with saturated fats.
   They include Nabisco's Triscuit crackers, Procter &amp; Gamble's
Crisco shortening, Kellogg's Cracklin' Oat Bran cereal, Pepperidge
Farm's Goldfish crackers, Keebler's Club crackers, Sunshine's Hydrox
cookies and non-dairy coffee creamers Coffee Swirl from Kraft,
Carnation's Coffeemate and Borden's Creamora.
   Saturated fats have the effect of boosting the blood's
cholesterol level, according to scientists. An excess of
cholesterol, a waxy compound, can clog arteries, thereby
contributing to heart attacks.
   The American Heart Association recommends a daily diet with no
more than 30 percent of calories from fats and no more than 10
percent from saturated fats.
   Sokolof, the owner of a construction equipment company, blames
high cholesterol for the near-fatal heart attack he suffered in 1966
at the age of 43. His father and a brother-in-law died of heart
attacks.
   ``There were no warnings,'' he said. ``I was thin. I exercised. I
didn't smoke. The only thing wrong was I had high cholesterol.''
   In 1985, he wrote a $1 million check to establish the National
Heart Savers Association. He has spent another $1 million to spread
his warning about high cholesterol.
   Heart Savers is registered in Nebraska as a non-profit
organization. Sokolof has provided 99 percent of its funds and is
the only staff member, he said.
   Sokolof said his brush with death, combined with a 1984
government study on cholesterol, prompted his effort.
   ``It is a crusade. It is from the heart,'' he said Thursday.
   But the targeted companies said the advertisements that ran
Tuesday in The New York Times and New York Post were unfair and
misrepresented their products.
   ``It's irresponsible,'' Joseph Stewart, a senior vice president
for Kellogg's in Battle Creek, Mich., said Thursday. ``For someone
to claim it is the poisoning of the American public is a gross
exaggeration.''
   Sokolof's biggest beef is with companies that portray their foods
as healthy by proclaiming ``no cholesterol,'' ``low salt,''
``non-dairy,'' and ``made with 100 percent vegetable shortening.''
   ``McDonald's still serves 30 million people a day, but when you
eat a McDonald's hamburger, you expect to get eight or 10 grams of
fat,'' he said. ``Other people are selling foods that are inferred
to be a health food.''
   The chief culprits, Sokolof said, are palm and coconut oils,
which are highly saturated even though they are vegetable oils.
Companies use the oils because they are the most expeditious way to
extend shelf life, he said.
   Particularly upsetting to him is Cracklin' Oat Bran cereal.
   ``They (Kellogg's) came to market with Oat Bran because everyone
wants to eat oat bran to lower their cholesterol,'' Sokolof said.
``But it has coconut oil in it, which has 100 percent more saturated
fat than lard. It is worse than cholesterol.''
   He also singled out Crisco, advertised as an all-vegetable
shortening with no cholesterol. ``It has no cholesterol, but it does
have palm oil, which is high in saturated fat and again worse than
cholesterol,'' he said.
   Cholesterol itself is only found in animal products, including
meat and dairy items like cheese, whole milk and eggs.
   Kellogg's Stewart said Sokolof's ads ``confuse legitimate efforts
to educate people about the cholesterol problem.'' Fats, he said,
are a necessary part of a healthy diet.
   If consumers believe Sokolof, he said, they should eliminate
every product that contains fat, including cheese, whole milk, beef,
chicken and pork.
   ``They all have saturated fat,'' he said.
   Sokolof counters that Kellogg's is making light of the fact that
the cereal contains 3.7 grams of coconut oil serving.
   ``If you eat it for one meal of your life, that would be fine,''
he said. ``But they are providing food for millions of people who
eat it every morning. You are talking about thousands of gallons of
fat. You're talking vats of fat.''
   Ann Wainright of Pepperidge Farm said her company recently began
using 100 percent soybean oil in all its breads.
   ``The elimination of coconut and palm oils in our cracker and
cookie products is a high priority,'' she said.
   Joe Simrany, vice president of marketing for Sunshine, said
Sunshine had removed coconut oil from most of its products and wants
to eliminate all tropical oils.
   ``National Heart Savers was aware of these efforts, but
apparently they chose to ignore them,'' Simrany said. ``Recently,
even in Hydrox, we have eliminated palm oil.''
   Sokolof said he will continue placing ads.
   ``Kellogg's isn't going to listen to me, but if they get enough
flak from the American people, they are going to change the
formula,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quaker Oats Co., embroiled in an oat bran
dispute with Texas officials, wants industrywide guidelines that
would allow food companies to advertise product health claims
without prior government approval.
   Health benefit claims on packages and in advertising would have
to be substantiated scientifically, said Luther C. McKinney, the top
legal officer for Chicago-based Quaker.
   The claims could be reviewed ``on a case-by-case basis'' by the
federal Food and Drug Administration, he said Monday.
   McKinney's proposal came during an address to the Food and Drug
Law Institute Seminar, in which he also critcized the Texas lawsuit
over Quaker's oatmeal advertising.
   ``The Texas state attorney general does not want us to
communicate health messages to the citizens of his state,'' said
McKinney.
   A spokesman for the Texas attorney general who was familiar with
the lawsuit could not be reached for comment Monday evening.
   Last Thursday, Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox alleged in a
lawsuit filed in Austin that Quaker ads claiming its oatmeal can
reduce cholesterol and, in turn, lessen the risk of heart attack are
``replete with exaggerations, half-truths and misinformation.''
   ``Let me state unequivocally that we dispute his allegations. Our
advertising for our oat products is truthful and is supported by
valid, reliable scientific evidence,'' said McKinney.
   McKinney said the lawsuit ``does a disservice to consumers
because it would prevent us from articulating a very important
reason why consumers should eat oats.''
   He conceded that oat bran health claims were ``very important''
to the sales of oatmeal and other oat cereals ``if we're going to
compete in this very tough environment.''
   In addition, McKinney accused competitor Kellogg Co. of
``marketing by inference'' because the Battle Creek, Mich., cereal
maker has said it will not make health claims _ only health messages
_ about its new high fiber cereal, Heartwise.
   The dispute over Heartwise involves its use of psyllium, a grain
from India that is high in soluble fiber. Soluble fiber has been
linked to reduced blood cholesterol levels.
   Psyllium is about 80 percent soluble fiber compared to oat bran's
10 percent.
   General Mills Inc. also is promoting a cereal containing
psyllium, called Benefit. Its ads for the product make outright
claims about cholesterol reduction.
   But critics say psyllium, an ingedient in some laxatives, should
be considered a drug and not included in food products without FDA
approval.
   ``I can understand Mr. McKinney's concern here, in that pysllium
is a natural grain that has ten times the soluble fiber as oat bran
_ and that's the issue,'' Joseph M. Stewart, a Kellogg senior vice
president, said in a telephone interview.
   McKinney reserved most of his criticism for Mattox, however,
saying ``those supporting a ban on public health claims for food are
essentially advocating consumer ignorance.''
   Noting that more than 60 million people in the United States have
cholesterol levels above the recommended level, McKinney asked,
``Where should they get such information? From a library? From a
health magazine? That's an elitist solution to the problem, if you
ask me.''
   In one ad Quaker states that ``in recent clinical studies, where
oats were a daily part of a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, total
serum cholesterol levels dropped an average almost 10 percent. Other
medical studies show such a drop could reduce your risk of heart
attack by nearly 20 percent.''
   But Texas claims Quaker's own tests showed that only a 3 percent
reduction in risk could be realized if oatmeal was added to a
low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. And that reduction is applicable only
to women who eat 25 percent more oatmeal than Quaker recommends as a
regular serving.
   Quaker maintains its ads have been backed up by scientific
studies and cleared, after an investigation, by the Federal Trade
Commission.
   Following complaints about Quaker's ads from a Washington-based
consumer rights group, the FTC investigated for a year and
``concluded that our ads were not misleading,'' said McKinney.

FT  04 OCT 94 / Europe reaches for its cereal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French are abandoning their croissants, Belgians their rolls and
Italians their habit of nothing but espresso. Across Europe, people are
swapping their traditional breakfasts for a bowl of processed grain and cold
milk. The European market for breakfast cereals has grown in recent years to
be worth some Pounds 1bn annually.
Even during recession, most countries have increased consumption. For
example, sales in France, the second largest European market for cereal
after the UK, increased by 21 per cent in the year to May 1993.
Europe has become an increasingly competitive market for cereal
manufacturers. The recent acquisition of two cereal companies by the Dutch
food and drinks company BolsWessanen, giving it almost 10 per cent of the
European cereal market overnight, has brought into the open what industry
insiders have known for some time.
To compete seriously, companies must have the market share and financial
muscle to back new products with heavy advertising. This year, Kellogg is
estimated to be spending Pounds 6m in the UK alone to support its Corn Pops
brand.
Harrison &amp; Crosfield, the UK conglomerate which sold, the companies to
BolsWessanen, admitted it would not compete in this league by shedding what
had been for it a successful, but peripheral, business.
The European breakfast cereals market is controlled by a few large
companies. According to the Food Industry Bulletin, Kellogg dominates with
more than 50 per cent, followed by Weetabix at 9.5 per cent and Cereal
Partners Worldwide, a joint venture between Nestle and General Mills, with 6
per cent.
The arrival of CP in 1989 is widely credited with setting off the real
explosion in the market. Within three years, through aggressive marketing
and new product launches, it had won sales of some Dollars 348m (Pounds
225m). Naturally, Kellogg fought back. When CP launched its Golden Grahams,
Kellogg came back a few weeks later with its own Golden Crackers. When CP
introduced Clusters, Kellogg responded with Nutfeast.
The battle even threatened a veteran campaigner, Tony the Tiger, of Frosties
fame. CP lit upon Huey, Dewey and Louie, Donald Duck's nephews, as the
cartoon warriors, for its Trio cereal in France.
But the biggest beneficiaries of the battle between the cereal giants appear
to have been the manufacturers of own label products. Own labels claim 11.5
per cent of total European cereal sales, second only to Kellogg. The
European market for private label products is widely acknowledged to be
growing at a faster rate than the branded sector.
It is partly due to the increasing number of adults who are turning to
cereal as a healthier breakfast option. In the UK, for example, the own
label market is largely an adult market, focusing on mueslis and bran
products.
'Staples deliver more steady virtues,' says Mr Mike Batten, marketing
manager of the UK private label manufacturer, Telford Foods. 'They may have
shown a dip in market share at times, but have stable volumes.' And with the
prospect of an ageing population, 'staples and bran are good bets for the
future'.
In the UK, own label sales are estimated to be outperforming the overall
breakfast cereal market's growth of 2 per cent a year.
'Private labels need size to compete,' says Ms Nomi Ghez, an analyst with
Goldman Sachs in the US. 'Who wants to fight for a share of a market which
only has sales of about Dollars 40m?'
But BolsWessanen, now with 50 per cent of the European private label market
and the financial muscle to back this up, could force Tony the Tiger, and
his rivals, Huey, Dewey and Louie, to sing even louder for their breakfasts.

<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Growing international sales of
ready-to-eat cereal helped Kellogg Co. post a 4.2 percent increase
in second-quarter profits, the world's largest cereal maker said
Friday.
   Kellogg, which makes cereal in 16 countries and sells it in more
than 130, said gains in those sales made up for sagging U.S.
results.
   Kellogg reported net income of $135.7 million, or $1.13 a share,
in the three months ending June 30, up from $129.7 million, or
$1.06 a share, in the second quarter of 1989.
   Net sales edged up to $1.26 billion from $1.23 billion in the
1989 period, the company said.
   ``The performance of our U.S. ready-to-eat cereal business was
down during the quarter,'' said William E. LaMothe, chairman and
chief executive officer. ``Growth of the category has slowed and
competition remains intense.''
   Competitors with popular oat-bran products narrowed Kellogg's
U.S. cereal market lead in 1989. LaMothe said the company expects
new products to widen the lead again.
   Kellogg introduced two health-oriented oriented cereals,
Heartwise and Oatbake, last fall, launched Kenmei Rice Bran in
January, and introduced Bigg Mixx multigrain cereal, marketed
mainly to children, in May.
   For the first six months of the year, Kellogg said it had net
earnings of $232 million, or $1.92 a share, on net sales of $2.47
billion, compared with $289.2 million, or $2.36 a share, on net
sales of $2.37 billion in the first half of 1989.

<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration, responding to a rush among food companies to cash in on concerns about cholesterol, raised questions about the addition of the grain psyllium to products before its safety has been assured.

   The agency, as expected, wrote letters to General Mills Inc. and Kellogg Co., ordering them to show why they should continue to market cereals containing fibrous psyllium husks.
But the FDA stopped short of requesting that the cereals be taken off the market.
Both companies said they would cooperate with the government in the controversy, which comes amid heightened concern about health claims made by food makers.

   General Mills was the first manufacturer to seize on psyllium's reported therapeutic effect on blood cholesterol levels by introducing a cereal called Benefit last April.
The boxes advertise that, as part of a low-fat diet, Benefit can help reduce cholesterol.
Benefit also contains sugar beet fiber, and the FDA told the company to justify using that as well.

   Kellogg has marketed two cereals containing psyllium, Bran Buds and Heartwise, the latter an apparent response to General Mills, its chief rival in the ready-to-eat cereal business.

   The FDA didn't address the issue of psyllium's effect on cholesterol, something that disappointed Procter &amp; Gamble Co., maker of the laxative Metamucil, which contains large amounts of psyllium.
The FDA has refused to let P&amp;G make a link between Metamucil and cholesterol in its ads.
When General Mills did that with Benefit, P&amp;G cried foul, arguing that the General Mills cereal "is a drug pretending to be a food."
P&amp;G said that either the FDA should prevent General Mills from making the claims or allow Procter &amp; Gamble to make them as well.

   "We hope the FDA will take further action to eliminate the inconsistency in allowing these cereals to make cholesterol reduction claims while Metamucil cannot," P&amp;G said in Cincinnati yesterday.

   The FDA agreed that the amounts of psyllium in both Benefit and Heartwise may define it as a drug.
The agency noted psyllium is described in government documents as "an evacuant to prevent constipation from impacted stools."
It said that sharply increasing the amount of soluble fiber, such as psyllium, in a diet "has the potential for harmful intestinal effects including depletion of beneficial colonic bacteria, constipation, fecal impaction or altered nutrient intake or absorption."

   Accordingly, "we have serious concerns about the introduction of significant amounts of psyllium seed husks in food without an appropriate safety review," the FDA concluded.
Anticipating that other companies want to jump on the psyllium bandwagon, the FDA said it was "concerned about the cumulative exposure of the population to psyllium from all potential food sources, and strongly questions whether the available information justifies this potential exposure."

   Both Kellogg and General Mills were asked to submit data to demonstrate the safety of psyllium as a source of dietary fiber in cereals.
So far, the only FDA approval of psyllium in food has been for minute quantities in frozen desserts.
In Benefit, psyllium makes up about 8% of the weight, and the FDA told General Mills it was unaware of any data that would justify the use of psyllium at that level.

   In Minneapolis, a General Mills spokesman said, "We think we have the data gathered, and we've already begun work to prepare those documents for submission.
We feel very comfortable with responding to their request."

   While the spokesman said the psyllium controversy had damped sales of Benefit, he added that the FDA's expressed concern wouldn't affect the product's continued rollout.
"We don't anticipate doing anything differently," he said.

   Benefit is available in about one-third of the states.
Texas has refused to allow its introduction because of misgivings about the product's health claims.

   In Battle Creek, Mich., Kellogg said: "We are confident psyllium is safe.
Psyllium is a natural grain that has been consumed by humans for generations.
We welcome the opportunity to provide the FDA with additional scientific data."

   American consumers who want to know exactly
what's in their food may have to go shopping overseas to find out,
says a consumer advocacy group.
   The Center for Science in the Public Interest said Thursday that
U.S. food companies are providing some foreign consumers with food
labeling details the firms have opposed in the United States as too
costly and intrusive.
   ``The labels of almost all processed foods sold in Thailand,
including well-known American products ... disclose the percentage
of each major ingredient contained in the product,'' said CSPI in a
written statement.
   Such labeling would reveal, for example, the percentage of oil
in peanut butter, sugar in a candy bar or flour in a cake.
   Among the products cited by the center as containing more
detailed labeling abroad was Kellogg's Frosted Flakes breakfast
cereal.
   Joseph M. Stewart, spokesman for the Michigan-based Kellogg Co.,
said percentage labeling could mislead consumers who are trying to
reduce their intake of certain dietary substances. ``We don't eat
on a percentage basis,'' he said.
   For instance, Stewart said, a 12-ounce can of cola contains 39
grams, or 11 percent, sugar. By comparison, the 11 grams of sugar
in a one-ounce serving of Frosted Flakes would equal 39 percent of
its content.
   The difference is explained by the lighter weight of the flakes
when compared to the weight of the water in the cola, Stewart said.
   ``At the moment you decide to eat the one with 11 percent sugar
over the one with 39 percent you will have committed the sin of
percentage labeling,'' said Stewart.
   Stewart said Kellogg was complying with Thai government
regulations but opposed such requirements by the U.S. government.
   ``I never expected to find American products with that kind of
labeling,'' said Bruce Silverglade, CSPI legal director, in a
telephone interview.
   Silverglade said he discovered the detailed labeling in a Thai
grocery store last summer when he went in to purchase bottled water.
   Alan Goldberg, a spokesman for the Grocery Manufacturers of
America, said the food trade group opposes percentage-ingredient
labeling on U.S. food products. ``And we will continue to based on
propriety information and trade secrets,'' said Goldberg.
   ``It's not in the consumer interest to put that kind of clutter
and detail on labels,'' said Roger Coleman, a spokesman for the
National Food Processors Association.
   ``To do this kind of labeling does nothing but add to the cost
and confusion for consumers,'' said Coleman.
   ``It is ironic that as U.S. food companies work to keep this
information secret at home, they have been providing the very same
information to consumers overseas,'' said Robert Parrish, a CSPI
staff attorney.
   Consumer, food industry and governmental groups already are
wrangling over legislation that would strengthen and make mandatory
nutrition labeling _ the amount of calories, proteins, fats and
other micro-ingredients _ for all foods.

<HEAD>Kellogg Takes Nabisco to Court Over Shredded Wheat Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kellogg Co. is taking Nabisco Brands
to court over shredded wheat, contending Nabisco is trying to crush
Kellogg's plans to introduce a more nutritious cereal.
   Kellogg has been planning since June to put its Whole Grain
Shredded Wheat on the market this month with the claim it's ``very
simply, the most nutritious shredded wheat you can buy.''
   The company contends the shredded wheat has 33 percent more
dietary fiber and more thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, iron, vitamins
B6 and B12, folic acid, magnesium and zinc _ with no sugar or salt
_ than the famous shredded wheat manufactured for 89 years by New
Jersey-based Nabisco Brands, a division of RJR-Nabisco.
   But on July 27, attorneys for Nabisco told Kellogg that it, too,
had developed a more nutritious shredded wheat _ with nearly
identical nutritional value as the new Kellogg product _ that would
be on the market in mid-August.
   Nabisco sent a letter to Kellogg, saying the Battle Creek
company must ``take immediate steps to avoid any false claims of
nutritional superiority for its fortified shredded wheat cereal on
packaging, advertising, point of sale and any other materials
whatsoever.''
   Instead, Kellogg filed suit Aug. 3 in U.S. District Court in
Kalamazoo.
   The company contends Nabisco had known since early June that
Kellogg was preparing to spring the new shredded wheat onto the
market, but said nothing. Kellogg had been sending samples and
promotional materials since that time to various test markets.
   ``That Nabisco should wait for 89 years and a competitive
challenge from Kellogg before manufacturing its own unsugared,
fortified shredded wheat biscuit was itself suspicious,'' the suit
says. ``But ... Kellogg has learned other facts which clearly
indicate that Nabisco set out to copy both the features of and
marketing strategy behind Kellogg's new cereal in a cynical attempt
to prevent vigorous competition in a sector of the market for
ready-to-eat cereals that it has dominated for so long.''
   Nabisco spokesman Mark Gutsche said Friday the company denies
the charge and called the lawsuit ``a reaction to Nabisco's own
threat of legal action.''
   He said the company's new cereal, Spoon Size Plus Shredded
Wheat, a fortified version of its regular product, already has been
sent to grocers.
   ``Nabisco is absolutely confident that Kellogg will be stopped
from confusing consumers that its new cereal is the most nutritious
shredded wheat,'' he said, reading from a prepared statement.
   Kellogg spokesman Neil Nyberg said the company is asking the
court to rule that its product claims are legal and that Nabisco
may not sue Kellogg over those claims.

<HEAD>Texas Slaps Embargo on Kellogg's Heartwise Cereal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA PERLMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas officials have imposed a distribution embargo on Kellogg
Co.'s Heartwise cereal in Texas in a dispute over labeling.
   On Tuesday, the Texas Health Department ordered warehouses to
halt distribution of the cereal. It accused Kellogg of deceptive
labeling and of failing to warn consumers about potential allergic
reactions to psyllium, a whole grain touted by Kellogg as a
cholesterol fighter.
   Texas is the only state that has sought to ban sales of
Heartwise, which was introduced last year by the Battle Creek,
Mich.-based cereal maker and has prompted a federal inquiry into
the safety of psyllium.
   Last week, Kellogg filed a federal lawsuit in Dallas against the
Texas Health Department and the attorney general's office to try to
ward off the embargo and allow the company to retain its current
labeling on the product.
   ``For the state of Texas to detain Heartwise on the basis of
their belief that it's an unapproved drug is totally ridiculous and
a total disregard for the science behind psyllium,'' Kellogg
spokesman Joseph Stewart said.
   Kellogg maintains that psyllium, a grain grown mainly in India,
has been scientifically shown to help reduce cholesterol when used
as part of a complete nutritional diet. The soluble fiber is used
in laxatives and its inclusion in Heartwise has led to a
controversy in the food industry about whether the cereal should be
considered a drug or food.
   The Food and Drug Administration is currently reviewing data on
psyllium's safety and the company's cholesterol-fighting claims.
   ``I think this goes back to the labeling of foods with drug-like
claims,'' said Dan Sowards, chief of the food branch for the Texas
Department of Health. ``The FDA ... has said products that
continued to make health claims would be subject to scrutiny.''
   Sowards said his department has asked Kellogg to change the
product's name and remove heart symbols from the box as well as
references to hospital endorsements. It also has asked for
inclusion of warnings about potential allergic reactions to
psyllium.
   Sowards said data given to the FDA by Kellogg include at least
50 cases of allergic reactions to the grain and some of them
required hospitalization.
   Kellogg maintains Heartwise has been shown to be safe. Most
grains, including wheat, cause allergic reactions in a very small
percentage of people, Stewart said.
   Three independent university studies released in April found
psyllium to be more effective in fighting cholesterol than wheat or
oat bran cereals.
   Stewart said the embargo's timing _ less than a week after the
lawsuit was filed _ shows that it is ``politically motivated and
not out of any concern for public safety.''
   He said the company is worried about the controversy's affect on
the cereal's sales, which have been disappointing.
   John McMillin, a food analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities of
New York, said those worries are justified.
   ``This just might be the nail in the coffin for Heartwise,''
McMillin said. ``It is my own feeling that the state of Texas has
no business doing this ... but consumers, and the state of Texas,
seem to perceive this as a drug and not as a food.''
   General Mills Inc. pulled its psyllium-based cereal, Benefit, in
January, citing poor sales.

   General Mills Inc. says its new Benefit meets
all the requirements of a breakfast cereal: You pour milk over the
flakes in a bowl and eat them with a spoon.
   But Procter &amp; Gamble Co. contends that Benefit, which General
Mills says has been shown to reduce cholesterol when used in a
low-fat diet, is actually a drug and should meet drug testing
requirements.
   P&amp;G, which sells over-the-counter medicines, has asked the Food
and Drug Administration to pull Benefit off the market, something
General Mills says it has no intention of doing.
   ``It's a cereal that's made from grain. It's consumed like a
cereal. It's no different from any other cereal that's on the
marketplace that contains soluble fiber and has the ability to
lower cholesterol,'' General Mills spokesman Craig Shulstad said
Wednesday.
   The FDA is reviewing Procter &amp; Gamble's June 8 request and is
expected to respond soon, said Chris Lecos, press officer for the
agency.
   Benefit contains oat bran, rice and psyllium, a grain grown
mainly in India. The outer husk of psyllium contains soluble fiber,
which has been shown to reduce cholesterol.
   Psyllium also is an ingredient in Cincinnati-based Procter &amp;
Gamble's Metamucil, a fiber laxative. P&amp;G had asked the FDA to
allow the company to make cholesterol-lowering claims for
Metamucil, but the agency said more tests were needed, company
spokesman Bill Dobson said.
   According to General Mills, which is based in the Minneapolis
suburb of Golden Valley, tests conducted in 1987 on men with
average and above-average cholesterol levels found that Benefit
reduced cholesterol levels an average of 9 percent when 2 ounces
were eaten daily as part of a low-fat diet.
   Benefit accounted for about two-thirds of the reduction, the
company said.
   The Benefit package touts the cereal's claims of reducing
cholesterol, a fatty substance that can build up in inner artery
walls. The deposits can narrow blood vessels, decrease the blood
flow and may lead to a heart attack or stroke.
   Kellogg Co. made a similar claim in 1984 when it linked
consumption of All-Bran, a high-fiber cereal, with reduction of
cancer risks.
   The FDA could have declared the cereal a drug, forcing Kellogg
to undergo lengthy procedures for drug approval. But FDA
Commissioner Dr. Frank Young said such action, which could have
entailed seizing All-Bran, would have been ridiculous.
   Instead, the agency decided to come up with a regulation that
would allow health claims on labels _ a process that is still under
way.
   P&amp;G _ which also makes toiletries, soap, detergents and other
household and food products _ claims General Mills is playing by a
different set of rules from drug manufacturers in being allowed to
make health claims without FDA approval.
   P&amp;G's Dobson said the company recently submitted to the FDA the
results of additional tests on the cholesterol-lowering effects of
Metamucil, and more tests may be required. An earlier study found
Metamucil reduced cholesterol about 15 percent, he said.
   Dobson said it's unfair for P&amp;G to have to substantiate its
cholesterol-lowering claims for Metamucil, while General Mills can
make the same claims for a food product without getting FDA
approval.
   General Mills, which also makes Cheerios and Wheaties cereals,
began distributing Benefit in Minneapolis-St. Paul and Milwaukee in
late April and early May.
   The company has expanded distribution to 28 percent of the
country, primarily in the Midwest, but has announced no plans on
expanding marketing nationally, Shulstad said.

   As consumer pressure on children's food marketers grows,
the American Academy of Pediatrics is calling for a ban on
all food commercials aimed at kids.
   The academy's attack, made yesterday at a pediatrics
conference in Chicago, is the latest attempt to rein in
marketers of sugary cereals and candy. According to the
academy, commercials hyping sugary foods may lead to obesity
and high cholesterol. "Advertising food products to children
promotes profit" for the food companies, the group charged,
"rather than health" for the country's youngest consumers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The call for an outright ban on food commercials is the
most extreme step yet against kiddie-food companies by
consumer activists. It intensifies the spotlight that has
already been trained on candy and cereal companies for the
past few months. Just last month, the Center for Science in
the Public Interest, an activist group, grabbed headlines
after reporting that an overwhelming 96% of Saturday morning
food ads were for sugary cereals, candy, cookies or junk
food.
   So far, congressional support for a ban on kiddie-food
commercials appears to be weak, even among legislators trying
to crack down on abuses by children's advertisers. "It seems
to me this proposal doesn't stand up as far as rights of free
speech," says Rep. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), who helped introduce
the center's study and has been calling for kids' advertisers
to stress nutrition in ads and public service messages.
   Yet Mr. Wyden warns that if advertisers don't regulate
themselves, Congress may do it for them. "Kids right now are
getting a skewed picture of nutrition -- a picture
overwhelmingly built around sugar and fat," he charges. "If
this problem isn't addressed, I would see growing pressure in
Congress to at least legislate some ground rules. To me
that's the last option, {but} I haven't ruled that out."
   Kiddie-food advertisers are clearly nervous -- and they
very well may modify their marketing practices to try to
appease critics lest they suffer even more bad publicity. At
General Mills, which makes sugar-laden Lucky Charms, Trix and
other products as well as more healthful fare like Cheerios
and Wheaties, "we are in complete disagreement with their
recommendation. Breakfast cereals can help improve the diets
of children," a spokeswoman says. She says General Mills'
research shows that children get 30% of their vitamins and
minerals from breakfast, and just 17% of their calories.
   Yet the cereal maker leaves room for change. "We have done
a lot in {nutrition} education, and we're certainly open to
doing more. We've done a lot on our packages, and we'd be
open to other options," the spokeswoman says. "We all have to
work together -- the industry and the government."
   "Information and education are the best answers, not bans
on advertising," agrees a spokesman for the Grocery
Manufacturers of America, a trade group whose members produce
85% of the country's packaged foods.
   Other food companies, though, lash out against the academy
without leaving room for compromise. Quaker Oats, for one,
says its sugary Cap'n Crunch cereal is positioned "as part of
a balanced breakfast. We should be able to advertise it in
the way we are." At Kellogg, which made Tony the Tiger a
household name for Frosted Flakes, "We have no plans to
change our advertising as a result of the recent activity," a
spokeswoman says. "Historically, Kellogg has always included
nutrition information."
   Certainly, not all food ads for kids promote
teeth-rotting, fat-laden, nutritionally bereft fare. Kellogg
touts the importance of a good breakfast in a 30-second spot
that doesn't even shill for any particular cereal brand. And
a few healthy food products do manage to grab some air time
most Saturday mornings, like milk.
   Rep. Wyden, who is chairman of the small-business
subcommittee on regulation, says he is "hopeful" that food
advertisers will "move aggressively" to do more to promote
good nutrition on their own. He is meeting in the next few
weeks with representatives from the National Association of
Broadcasters and the Grocery Manufacturers of America to try
to work out some voluntary measures. Consumers "are making it
clear they want more information about good dietary practices
and information, especially for kids. I told the food
industry, `The ball is in your court,'" he says.
   According to the Academy of Pediatrics, food commercials
accounted for 71% of network ads in 1987, with cereals making
up almost 30% of that and cookies, candy and snacks
accounting for another 34%. Most of the kiddie-food
commercials "promote high-caloric density foods that may
contribute to the energy imbalance that results in obesity,"
the academy charges. It says both obesity and high
cholesterol have been associated with TV viewing.
   The academy's attack is part of a wider-ranging assault on
the children's television industry. The commercialization of
kiddie TV "exploits children," it charges, because "young
children are unable to distinguish between programs and
commercials and do not understand that commercials are
designed to sell products."
   Food advertising in particular is a problem, according to
the Academy, because "children are unprepared to make
appropriate food choices. . . . Parents rather than children
should determine what children should eat."

   EPB Wins Account


   Weight Watchers International named Earle Palmer Brown to
handle its $30 million weight-loss system ad account, giving
the Bethesda, Md., agency a high-profile boost.
   Weight Watchers, a unit of H.J. Heinz, picked the midsized
shop after conducting a review that had trimmed the
contenders down to a David-vs.-Goliath duel between Earle
Palmer Brown and the much larger Chicago-based agency Leo
Burnett. Burnett already handled a number of Heinz brands.
   Incumbent DDB Needham, a unit of Omnicom Group, dropped
out of the pitch last month, apparently deciding it was
unlikely to win the account. DDB Needham continues to handle
the estimated $27 million Weight Watchers frozen foods
account, also a Heinz unit.
   The account will become Earle Palmer Brown's largest and
will give it the national platform to help establish it as a
national agency, not just a regional player. The agency,
which has 12 offices, has total billings of about $400
million.
   Weight Watcher's switch comes as growth in the market for
diet centers, while still healthy, is slowing. After
increasing 43% in 1988 and 22% in 1989, sales of weight-loss
programs grew 12% last year and are expected to grow 8%
through 1995, according to research firm Packaged Facts.

   L.A. Agency Shuffle


   Stephen Hayman resigned as executive vice president and
general manager of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding's Los Angeles
office, touching off a management shuffle at two big Los
Angeles ad agencies.
   Mr. Hayman, who is 44 years old and hasn't taken a new
job, will be succeeded at Foote Cone by Rich Edler, 47, who
is executive vice president and managing director of
McCann-Erickson's Los Angeles office. McCann, a unit of
Interpublic Group, named Rona Pashkin-Boyer to succeed Mr.
Edler in that post. Ms. Pashkin-Boyer, 45, has worked in a
number of McCann's European operations, most recently as
general manager of the agency's Paris office.
   Mr. Hayman said he was leaving because "a lot of the fun
had gone away." "The business got more and more difficult
over time, and I sort of lost my passion and enthusiasm," he
said. He said he planned to take some time off before looking
for another job -- perhaps "something totally outside
advertising and marketing."

   Ad Notes. . . .


   NORTHWEST: As expected, Northwest Airlines pulled its ad
account from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising and
McCann-Erickson, splitting it among four other agencies.
Billings for the total account are estimated at about $80
million. WPP Group's J. Walter Thompson won the largest
portion, domestic and international consumer advertising.
Ogilvy &amp; Mather, also a WPP Group unit, will create ads for
Northwest's shuttle, assuming the airline's negotiations to
buy the Trump Shuttle are successful, and will handle another
undisclosed assignment, for total billings industry
executives estimate at $12 million. FCB/Leber Katz Partners,
a unit of Foote, Cone &amp; Belding, will handle an estimated $15
million direct-marketing campaign aimed in part at frequent
fliers. McElligott Wright Morrison White will do
corporate-image work, with undetermined billings, for the NWA
Inc. unit. In a highly unusual arrangement, senior executives
from all four agencies will work together with Northwest on
crafting a global advertising message, said Christopher
Clouser, Northwest's senior vice president of corporate
communications and advertising.


   DRUG ACCOUNT: Sandoz Pharmaceuticals pulled the ad
assignment for its Tavist-D allergy and cold drug from Lord,
Dentsu &amp; Partners and is expected to pick a new agency
shortly. The drug, currently sold by prescription, is
awaiting Food and Drug Administration approval to be sold
over-the-counter. Lord Dentsu, a joint venture of Young &amp;
Rubicam and Dentsu, had handled the assignment on a project
basis; if the drug gains FDA approval, billings are expected
to be $20 million or more.


   WHO'S NEWS: Stavros Cosmopulos resigned as chairman and
creative director of Cosmopulos, Crowley &amp; Daly, Boston, to
pursue an independent consulting practice. Mr. Cosmopulos
also was a co-founder of the big Boston agency Hill,
Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos.

   Kellogg Co. is likely to post an increase in fourth-quarter profit in the "double digits," William E. LaMothe, chairman and chief executive officer, said.

   Mr. LaMothe wouldn't elaborate on the projection.
He added, however, that Kellogg is "hopeful" it will report more than a 10% increase in net income for 1986 compared with last year, and that it expects to report a similar jump in sales, "maybe a little higher."

   For the year-ago fourth quarter, the breakfast cereal concern had profit of $54.2 million, or 44 cents a share, on sales of $718 million.
For all of 1985, net was $281.1 million, or $2.28 a share, on sales of $2.93 billion.

   As for 1987, Mr. LaMothe said "our plans call for a similar or better performance," referring to the growth in profit expected this year.
He said in an interview that several factors, including strong international sales, publicity over the health value of high-grain products and changing demographics, are contributing to Kellogg's results.

   Mr. LaMothe said the company's products have traditionally had good per-capita consumption among people under 21 years old, less in middle-age groups, and strong consumption among people 50 years old and older.
He said that with life spans lengthening, the company's products are in greater demand.
"We see that happening basically around the world," he said.

   Mr. LaMothe said Kellogg plans to continue emphasizing health and nutrition as a part of its image and that Kellogg also plans to add new products to take advantage of the health trend.

   One product the company introduced nationally this year, a mixture of grains called Just Right, has "done very well," Mr. LaMothe said.
The product has gained about 1% of the market, and Kellogg views it as a success.
The company's best-selling cereal is still its corn flakes, which has 6% of the market.

   Mr. LaMothe said the company will spend slightly more than 1% of sales on research and development this year and that capital spending in 1986 will be "close to $300 million and we will exceed that next year."
In 1985, the company had $245 million in capital expenditures.
He said the new capital spending will include expenditures for added capacity and new technology.
Kellogg is planning an expansion of its facilities in Battle Creek and is modernizing some operations in Europe.

   Kellogg recently developed a mass-production method of putting fruit into a wheat biscuit, which resulted in the company's Raisin Squares and Apple Squares products.

   The company has also been spending on new technology in its plants.
Mr. LaMothe said, for example, that the company recently replaced one procedure of adjusting flaking mills by hand with a computerized system.
Before, he says, there was much variation in production, but now "we have much, much better control with more efficiency."

   Mr. LaMothe said the price of the company's supplies of basic grains in North America are expected to remain relatively stable in the near term, while the price of fruits and sugar are expected to edge up.
He said this will lead to some retail price increase for the company's products.
"I think we will see some movement, not a great deal," Mr. LaMothe said.
The increase "could run anywhere" from 2% to 5% "depending upon what product you're talking about."

   In an advertising battle against a
rival cereal maker's health claims about oat bran, Kellogg Co. has
launched a $40-million campaign touting the cholesterol-cutting
powers of psyllium.
   Ads Monday in USA TODAY and U.S. News &amp; World Report, also
scheduled to run in Time and Newsweek magazines, show a red boxing
glove holding a stalk of psyllium grain. ``If you think oat bran is
tough, meet the new champ,'' the caption reads.
   Kellogg is taking a poke at General Mills Inc., which analysts
say has used an emphasis on oat bran to increase its cereal market
share to 27 percent from about 22 percent in the past year.
Kellogg's share has slipped to 38.6 percent from more than 40
percent.
   ``Anything that changes the emphasis from oats is in Kellogg's
best interest due to their under representation in the oat bran
category,'' said John McMillin, a food industry analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities in New York.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration ordered both Kellogg and
General Mills in September to document the safety of psyllium, a
grain grown primarily in India. An FDA spokesman said the agency is
reviewing Kellogg's response.
   ``We're so confident that (psyllium) is safe that an ad like
this is just natural for us,'' Kellogg spokeswoman Celeste Clark
said. The ads are part of a $40-million campaign for the Heartwise
cereal introduced in August.

<LEADPARA>  Television food advertisements aimed at children should be banned because they
exploit youths and contribute to obesity, the American Academy of Pediatrics
said today.;    The group said children are bombarded with ads for products
such as sugary breakfast cereals aimed at profit-making rather than health.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DOCTORS' GROUP OPPOSES FOOD ADS AIMED AT
KIDS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     In a policy statement to be issued at a downtown conference, the group said
the ad ban is necessary because young children cannot distinguish between
programs and commercials and don't understand that commercials are designed to
sell products.;    "Not only do we believe that food ads should be eliminated
but also parents' control of the television set should be increased," said Dr.
William Dietz, lead author of the statement and an associate professor of
pediatrics at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston.;    But a
spokesman for a trade organization representing 80 percent of the nation's
major grocery manufacturers called the recommendation "overkill.";     "There
is not a serious problem with food advertising to children," said Jeff
Nedelman of the Grocery Manufacturers of America in Washington.;
Television has been linked to the two most prevalent nutrition problems in
U.S. children -- obesity, which affects one in five youths, and high
cholesterol levels, found in about a third of all children, Dietz said.;
"Television viewing promotes inactivity and food consumption," partly through
a heavy dose of food ads, he said.;    Children demand that their parents buy
the products they see advertised, and parents often bow to the pressure, he
said.;    "What we have is a tightly woven net of commercialism that now
surrounds children's television, in which it often begins with toys like the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and ends with a cereal for the toy, Dietz said.;
   About half of all food ads are aimed at children, and most of those ads are
for sugary breakfast cereals, Dietz said.;    Spokesman Pat Farrell of St.
Louis-based Ralston Purina Co. said the company's rice-based Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles cereal is nutritious.;    A one-cup serving is about one-third
sugar, but it's also fat-free and vitamin-fortified, Farrell said.;    "It's
clear that the authors of the proposed ban don't understand the role of
ready-to-eat cereals in providing children with a healthy, low-fat breakfast,"
said George Franklin, spokesman for Kellogg Co.;    Kellogg's products include
Froot Loops cereal, which is 47 percent sugar, said Michael Jacobson,
executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.;    The
Battle Creek, Mich., company was founded in 1906 by the Kellogg brothers, who
created breakfast cereals "as an alternative to the fat-laden, heavy
breakfasts at the turn of the century," Franklin said.  </TEXT>

   Kellogg Co. today is expected to fuel the controversy over health claims for foods.

   The Battle Creek, Mich.-based company will unveil a cereal called Heartwise, which contains husks of psyllium, a grain reputedly beneficial in lowering blood cholesterol.
General Mills Inc., Minneapolis, ballyhooed the grain's properties in recently introducing its Benefit cereal, which contains psyllium fiber.

   Texas and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. have raised questions about some health claims made by General Mills.
P&amp;G's Metamucil laxative contains psyllium, but so far the FDA hasn't allowed the company to advertise the fiber's cholesterol-lowering properties.
Right now, the only use of psyllium the agency has approved is as an ingredient in frozen desserts, in very limited quantity.

   Kellogg, as part of today's announcement, is expected to spell out its policy on the relationship of foods and health claims.
In recent months the company had to modify advertisements implying that vitamins in Rice Krispies enhanced physical vigor.

   Referring to Heartwise, Prudential-Bache food analyst John McMillin said he believes that Kellogg will "sell this new product in the context of an overall diet.
They're going to say, eat psyllium and live your life right and you'll have lower cholesterol levels."

   Kellogg's Net Rose
   4.6% in 2nd Quarter
   On International Sales

   BATTLE CREEK, Mich. -- Kellogg Co., citing "substantially"
improved sales from international operations, said
second-quarter earnings rose 4.6%, reversing a trend of lower
earnings experienced in the past three quarters.
   The cereal maker said it earned $135.7 million, or $1.13 a
share, on sales of $1.26 billion. In the year-earlier
quarter, it earned $129.7 million, or $1.06 a share, on sales
of $1.23 billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Earlier, the company's chairman, William E. LaMothe, said
the quarter would be one of "very heavy investment" in
marketing as well as product development. Therefore, the
results weren't expected to match last year's earnings.
   In New York Stock Exchange trading Friday, Kellogg shares
rose 87.5 cents to close at $69.50.
   Kellogg said sales volumes of ready-to-eat cereal in its
international operations increased substantially in the
quarter. A spokesman for the company said "international is
becoming an increasing percentage of our business. Last year,
sales from outside the U.S. contributed 37% of the sales of
the organization and it is continuing to grow." The company
also said the results were helped by cost-containment
measures taken throughout the company.
   Despite the improvement in those operations, Kellogg said
the performance of its U.S. ready-to-eat cereal business was
down because of "intense" competition and slowed growth.
   In the first six months, earnings fell 19.8% to $232
million, or $1.92 a share, on sales of $2.47 billion.
