   Mitsubishi Estate Co., a major Japanese real
estate concern, announced Monday it will buy 51 percent of
Rockefeller Group Inc., the private real estate and entertainment
company controlled by descendants of John D. Rockefeller Jr.
   The $846 million cash purchase will give Mitsubishi majority
control of Radio City Music Hall Productions Inc., the Cushman &amp;
Wakefield Inc. real estate firm and Rockefeller Center, the
landmark, 22-acre Manhattan development built by Rockefeller.
   Last month, Rockefeller Group confirmed media reports that it
was seeking an outside investor to buy part of the company. The
reports indicated that some Rockefeller family members, who control
the company through trusts, wanted more income from their
investments. Most of the family members' inheritance is tied up in
real estate and other corporate holdings.
   But the independent trust committee that manages the family's
trusts said the money from the sale to Mitsubishi would be
reinvested in other company operations. William G. Bowen, chairman
of the trust committee, said one objective of the sale was to
diversify the company's holdings, which are concentrated in real
estate.
   ``Our agreement with Mitsubishi Estate preserves the abiding
commitment to Rockefeller Center and New York City, which my father
made more than 50 years ago, and which present generations of the
family continue to feel,'' David Rockefeller, Rockefeller Group's
chairman, said in a statement.
   Richard A. Voell, Rockefeller Group's president and chief
executive, said the purchase of the 627,000 shares in the company
by Mitsubishi ``ensures the company's ability to continue to invest
in Rockefeller Center to enhance its stature as the most modern and
prestigious commercial complex.''
   He said Rockefeller Group's board, its advisers and the trust
committee considered other options, such as a recapitalization
funded by debt, before they decided on the sale.
   Four years ago, Rockefeller Group refinanced Rockefeller Center
by taking out a $1.3 bilion mortgage on some of the rentable space,
then selling shares in that mortgage to the public through a real
estate investment trust. The company also manages Rockefeller
Center.
   The Rockefeller family fortune was built by John D. Rockefeller,
founder of Standard Oil Co., and was estimated at $900 million by
1911.
   His son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., created five trusts for his
children in 1934. Those trusts are the principal owners of
Rockefeller Group, with descendants of John D. Rockefeller Jr. the
main beneficiaries.
   The Rockefeller Center complex includes the General Electric
Building, formerly known as the RCA building, Radio City Music Hall
and the Time-Life building.
   Rockefeller Group's other businesses include: Rockefeller Center
Development Corp., Rockefeller Center Management Corp., Rockefeller
Group Telecommunications Services Inc., Radio City Music Hall
Productions Inc., and Cushman &amp; Wakefield, in which the company
holds an 80 percent stake.
   Mitsubishi Estate is one of Japan's largest real estate
companies. Its other major U.S. investments include partnerships
that built a $500 million office building at Citicorp Plaza in Los
Angeles and a 2,300-acre resort complex at Palm Desert, Calif.

   In yet another Japanese takeover of an American
institution, Mitsubishi Estate Co. plans to pay $846 million for
control of the company that owns Rockefeller Center and Radio City
Music Hall.
   The announcement late Monday by Mitsubishi, one of Japan's
largest real estate companies, follows last month's takeover of
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. by Japan's Sony Corp. for $3.4
billion. It also continues a trend of major Japanese real estate
purchases in the United States.
   Rockefeller Group Inc., which owns and manages the 19-building
Rockefeller Center complex in Manhattan, is a legacy of a family
whose name stands for American capitalism. The family, which
controls the private company, traces its fortune to John D.
Rockefeller, who founded the Standard Oil Co.
   Managers of trusts that control the family's holdings said they
decided to sell 51 percent of their shares in Rockefeller Group to
diversify the company's investments, which also include the
nationwide Cushman &amp; Wakefield commercial real estate brokerage.
   Last month, Rockefeller Group confirmed media reports that it
was seeking an outside investor to buy part of the company. The
reports indicated that some Rockefeller family members wanted more
income from their investments. Most of the family members'
inheritance is tied up in real estate and other holdings.
   But the independent trust committee that manages the family's
holdings said Monday the money from the sale to Mitsubishi would be
reinvested in other Rockefeller Group operations, and would not be
paid out to family members.
   William G. Bowen, chairman of the trust committee, said one
objective of the sale was to diversify the company's holdings,
which are concentrated in real estate.
   ``The sale of a large block of shares to Mitsubishi was approved
because it offered a most unusual opportunity to enhance the
long-term prospects of the Rockefeller Group and Rockefeller Center
while simultaneously rebalancing the trust portfolio,'' Bowen said.
   In a statement, David Rockefeller, Rockefeller Group's chairman
and son of John D. Rockfeller Jr., said, ``Our agreement with
Mitsubishi Estate preserves the abiding commitment to Rockefeller
Center and New York City which my father made more than 50 years
ago, and which present generations of the family continue to feel.''
   Rockefeller Group officials said the company's board, its
advisers and the trust committee considered other options, such as
a recapitalization funded by debt, before they decided on the stock
sale. The closing date of the deal was not announced.
   Four years ago, Rockefeller Group refinanced Rockefeller Center
by taking out a $1.3 bilion mortgage on some of the rentable space,
then selling shares in that mortgage to the public through a real
estate investment trust.
   In the year 2000 the trust has the option of converting those
shares into ownership stakes in Rockefeller Center that would put
71.5 percent of the complex in the public's hands.
   The Rockefeller family fortune was was estimated at $900 million
in 1911, when the Standard Oil trust was busted into several
companies. Today, Forbes magazine estimates the combined family
fortune at over $5 billion.
   John D. Rockefeller's son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., created five
trusts for his children in 1934. Those trusts are the principal
owners of Rockefeller Group, with descendants of John D.
Rockefeller Jr. the main beneficiaries.
   The 22-acre Rockefeller Center complex includes the 65-story
General Electric Building, formerly called the RCA Building, which
contains the Rainbow Room and NBC's headquarters; Radio City Music
Hall, home of the Rockettes; a famed outdoor ice-skating rink; the
Time-Life building, and The Associated Press Building, headquarters
of the news service.
   The Art Deco center, built in the 1930s, is one of the nation's
first large-scale urban developments. Its buildings are the home of
many well-known corporations, such as Time-Warner Inc., McGraw-Hill
Inc. and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc.
   Rockefeller Group's other businesses include: Rockefeller Center
Development Corp., Rockefeller Center Management Corp., Rockefeller
Group Telecommunications Services Inc., Radio City Music Hall
Productions Inc., and the 40-office Cushman &amp; Wakefield, in which
the company holds an 80 percent stake.
   Mitsubishi Estate, which is publicly traded and has historical
ties to the auto company of the same name, is one of Japan's
largest real estate companies. Its other major U.S. investments
include partnerships that built a $500 million office building at
Citicorp Plaza in Los Angeles and a 2,300-acre resort complex at

   In yet another Japanese takeover of an American
institution, Mitsubishi Estate Co. plans to pay $846 million for
control of the company that owns Rockefeller Center and Radio City

   The announcement late Monday by Mitsubishi, one of Japan's
largest real estate companies, follows last month's takeover of
Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. by Japan's Sony Corp. for $3.4
billion. It also continues a trend of major Japanese real estate
purchases in the United States.
   Rockefeller Group Inc., which owns and manages the 19-building
Rockefeller Center complex in Manhattan, is a legacy of a family
whose name stands for American capitalism. The family, which
controls the private company, traces its fortune to John D.
Rockefeller, who founded the Standard Oil Co.
   The old 12-building Art Deco portion of Rockefeller Center,
including Radio City Music Hall, most likely will not be controlled
by Mitsubishi past the year 2000. Public shareholders of a real
estate investment trust are expected to take control that year.
   For Mitsubishi, the more valuable assets are the Time-Life
Building and a 50 percent interest in the McGraw-Hill Building,
which are in the newer portion of Rockefeller Center; as well as
the nationwide Cushman &amp; Wakefield commercial real estate brokerage
and prime real estate parcels in New York and New Jersey.
   Last month, Rockefeller Group confirmed media reports that it
was seeking an outside investor to buy part of the company. The
reports indicated that some Rockefeller family members wanted more
income from their investments. Most of the family members'
inheritance is tied up in real estate and other holdings.
   But the independent trust committee that manages the family's
holdings said Monday the money from the sale to Mitsubishi would be
reinvested in other Rockefeller Group operations, and would not be
paid out to family members.
   William G. Bowen, chairman of the trust committee, said one
objective of the sale was to diversify the company's holdings,
which are concentrated in real estate.
   ``The sale of a large block of shares to Mitsubishi was approved
because it offered a most unusual opportunity to enhance the
long-term prospects of the Rockefeller Group and Rockefeller Center
while simultaneously rebalancing the trust portfolio,'' Bowen said.
   In a statement, David Rockefeller, Rockefeller Group's chairman
and son of John D. Rockefeller Jr., said, ``Our agreement with
Mitsubishi Estate preserves the abiding commitment to Rockefeller
Center and New York City which my father made more than 50 years
ago, and which present generations of the family continue to feel.''
   Rockefeller Group officials said the company's board, its
advisers and the trust committee considered other options, such as
a recapitalization funded by debt, before they decided on the stock
sale. The closing date of the deal was not announced.
   Mitsubishi's 51 percent ownership of the older portion of
Rockefeller Center is likely to diminish to about 14 percent in the
year 2000.
   Four years ago, Rockefeller Group refinanced Rockefeller Center
by taking out a $1.3 billion mortgage on the historic portion of
the center east of Avenue of the Americas. It then sold shares in
that mortgage to the public through a real estate investment trust.
   In the year 2000 the trust has the option of converting those
shares into ownership stakes in the older portion of Rockefeller
Center that would put 71.5 percent of the complex in the public's
hands.
   Conversion of the shares appears likely because the properties
involved in the trust already are worth $1.8 billion, according to
an appraisal at the end of last year.
   The conversion would leave just 28.5 percent of the older
portion of Rockefeller Center under the joint ownership of
Mitsubishi Estate and the Rockefellers.
   The Rockefeller family fortune was estimated at $900 million in
1911, when the Standard Oil trust was busted into several
companies. Today, Forbes magazine estimates the combined family
fortune at over $5 billion.
   John D. Rockefeller's son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., created five
trusts for his children in 1934. Those trusts are the principal
owners of Rockefeller Group, with descendants of John D.
Rockefeller Jr. the main beneficiaries.
   The 22-acre Rockefeller Center complex includes the 65-story
General Electric Building, formerly called the RCA Building, which
contains the Rainbow Room and NBC's headquarters; Radio City Music
Hall, home of the Rockettes; a famed outdoor ice-skating rink; the
Time-Life building, and The Associated Press Building, headquarters
of the news service.
   The original part of the center was built in the 1930s in an Art
Deco style as one of the nation's first large-scale urban
developments and is classified as a National Historic Landmark. The
center was later expanded with a row of modern skyscrapers west of
Avenue of the Americas.
   Its buildings are the home of many well-known corporations, such
as Time Warner Inc., McGraw-Hill Inc. and Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Inc.
Among the newer buildings, the Exxon Building was sold about three
years ago to Japan's Mitsui &amp; Co. for $620 million and is now being
vacated by Exxon, which is moving headquarters to Texas. The
Celanese building is owned by JMB Realty of Chicago and the
McGraw-Hill Building is half-owned by McGraw-Hill.
   Rockefeller Group's other businesses include: Rockefeller Center
Development Corp., Rockefeller Center Management Corp., Rockefeller
Group Telecommunications Services Inc., Radio City Music Hall
Productions Inc., and the 40-office Cushman &amp; Wakefield, in which
the company holds an 80 percent stake.
   Mitsubishi Estate, which is publicly traded and has historical

Mitsubishi Estate Co., one of Japan's leading real estate concerns, announced 
here today that it has invested $846 million for a 51% stake in the Rockefeller 
Group, making the firm a major partner in such American icons as New York 
City's Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall. 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Rockefeller Group said that, although the purchase gives 
Mitsubishi Estate controlling interest in the group, the tie-up is expected to 
be treated as a "partnership" without any significant changes in management 
objectives or personnel. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the deal is steeped with symbolic significance. It marks the transfer to 
a foreign buyer of control over high-profile vestiges of the historic 
Rockefeller family's economic might, built by the legendary John D. Rockefeller 
in the late 19th Century through his powerful Standard Oil trust. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Estate's purchase follows a string of acquisitions of landmark U.S. 
properties by Japanese investors. In downtown Los Angeles, Mitsubishi Estate is 
one of the developers of the Citicorp Plaza high-rise complex at 8th and 
Figueroa streets, and Japanese investors have acquired other big chunks of 
prime real estate elsewhere in Los Angeles, New York and other major U.S. 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
The Mitsubishi-Rockefeller deal also was announced amid controversy over other 
conspicuous Japanese investments in the United States, including Sony Corp.'s 
re cent agreement to buy Columbia Pictures for $3.4 billion. It is not clear 
whether the Rockefeller deal will engender the same kind of negative backlash, 
however, because the mechanics of the transaction appear to differ from many of 
the recent Japanese acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Rather than directly purchasing property, Mitsubishi Estate obtained 627,000 
shares of common stock in the Rockefeller Group, which was privately held by 
various Rockefeller family trusts controlled by an independent trust committee. 
The group owns and manages 14 office buildings in New York, including 
Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Woodhull, a real estate analyst for Merrill Lynch Japan Inc. in Tokyo, 
said the fact that Mitsubishi Estate purchased shares in the buildings, rather 
than the properties themselves, might serve to shield the company from 
criticism that it is "buying the heart of America," one of the charges leveled 
at Sony during the highly emotional reaction to its planned Columbia takeover. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Burstein, the New York author of "Yen: Japan's New Financial Empire and 
Its Threat to America," raised similar points, adding that the form of the 
purchase "is a response and reflection on the Japanese side that Americans 
don't want the perception that their companies and businesses are being sold 
lock, stock and barrel to Japanese investors." 
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a very intelligent and sane approach. The money is going to 
come to this side of the Pacific. That's sort of inevitable. The question is: 
What is the way to (invest) that doesn't get American backs up?" 
</P>
<P>
Amy Trotta, spokeswoman for the Rockefeller Group, said that a 51% stake in the 
group was sold to Mitsubishi Estate because that was the amount of the shares 
that needed to be sold off to meet the "fiduciary duties" of the Rockefeller 
family trust, which had too much capital concentrated in one part of its 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
With the purchase, however, Mitsubishi Estate apparently indirectly acquired 
only a 14.5% share in Rockefeller Center. The Rockefeller Group divested itself 
of 71.5% of the center in 1985 in a public offering of shares, and it retained 
only a 28.5% interest at the time of the Mitsubishi deal, according to Trotta. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no business address in the world that has the same cachet as 
Rockefeller Center," Jotaro Takagi, president of Mitsubishi Estate, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old Rockefeller Center is a 19-building, 22-acre Art Deco complex 
that includes such landmarks as the Radio City Music Hall and the old RCA 
building, now known as 30 Rockefeller Plaza. The center, opened during the 
Depression, has been immortalized in songs, such as George and Ira Gershwin's 
1937 ditty, "They All Laughed," which goes: "They all laughed at Rockefeller 
Center, now they're begging to get in." 
</P>
<P>
Rockefeller Group's holdings include Rockefeller Center Management Corp., which 
runs Rockefeller Center; Rockefeller Center Development Corp., which owns 
developments in New York and New Jersey, and Rockefeller Group 
Telecommunications Services, which provides telecommunications services for 
tenants of Rockefeller Center and other customers. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Rockefeller Group owns Radio City Music Hall Productions, an 
entertainment production company that not only stages the annual Christmas 
spectacular at Radio City Music Hall but also planned such extravaganzas as the 
anniversaries of the Eiffel Tower and the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Another holding is an 80% interest in New York-based Cushman &amp; Wakefield 
Inc., one of the nation's largest real estate brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockefeller family empire dates to John D. Rockefeller, America's first 
billionaire, who was born in 1839 in modest circumstances. He rose from a job 
as a bookkeeper to build what became known as the Standard Oil trust, which 
eventually was broken up in 1911 by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
John D. Rockefeller's son, John Jr., went on to build Rockefeller Center. The 
Rockefeller Group that has held the center has been controlled by the trusts 
that John Jr. established in 1934 to provide for his six children and their 
descendants, now numbering about 85. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes magazine recently estimated the family's fortune at more than $5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Estate is a member of the Mitsubishi Group, one of Japan's leading 
conglomerates, and is the custodian of much of the vast landholdings assembled 
by the former zaibatsu, as pre-World War II family-owned industrial monopolies 
are known. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi typifies the business practices -- interlocking directorates, 
cross-shareholdings and tight group loyalties -- that are currently being 
criticized by U.S. officials as posing structural impediments to free trade 
with Japan. Mitsubishi and five other major financial-industrial combines 
together control 25% of the Japanese economy, according to a report issued 
earlier this year by the Japan Fair Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Sales for the real estate company in the fiscal year ended March 31 were about 
$2 billion, while after-tax profits totaled $250 million.

<HEAD>Rockefeller Group Seeking Ways To Raise More Cash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rockefeller Group Inc. confirmed Monday it was
seeking ways to raise more cash for the family members who are
majority shareholders, after a published report indicated part of
the firm could be up for sale by month's end.
   The company's management has been authorized by the board of
directors ``to explore strategic alternatives for
recapitalization,'' said Vince Silvestri, a spokesman for
Rockefeller Group, whose vast holdings include the 19-building,
22-acre Rockefeller Center in Manhattan.
   But Silvestri said he couldn't comment on a report in Monday's
Wall Street Journal that said Rockefeller Group was trying to sell a
large stake in the family-owned company to outside investors for
more than $1 billion.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources familiar with the
proposal, said Rockefeller Group may seek between $1.3 billion and
$2 billion for 40 percent to 80 percent of the company. It said
family members were hoping to raise cash without losing control over
the management of company assets.
   The company is preparing a prospectus that will be available by
the end of the month to a limited group of potential investors,
according to the Journal.
   The plan would represent another step by Rockefeller Group to
raise cash for a generation of Rockefellers whose inheritance is
largely locked up in real estate and other corporate holdings.
   Four years ago, Rockefeller Group refinanced Rockefeller Center
by taking out a $1.3 bilion mortgage on some of the rentable space,
then selling shares in that mortgage to the public through a real
estate investment trust. The company also sold a 15 percent equity
interest to outside investors and some properties around the country.
   ``Among those alternatives being considered are longer financial
restructuring, the sale of shares or a possible joint venture
arrangement with selected investors ...,'' said Silvestri.
   He said proceeds would be used in part ``to provide greater
liquidity for current shareholders.''
   The Rockefeller family fortune was built by John D. Rockefeller,
founder of Standard Oil Co., and was estimated at $900 million by
1911.
   His son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., created a series of five trusts
for his children in 1934. Those trusts are the principal owners of
Rockefeller Group, with descendants of John D. Rockefeller Jr. the
main beneficiaries.
   As the family now moves into the sixth generation the need for
cash to finance various business efforts has increased.
   Besides the Rockefeller Center complex, which includes the
General Electric Building, formerly known as the RCA building, Radio
City Music Hall and the Time-Life buildings, Rockefeller Group
operates several businesses.
   They include: Rockefeller Center Development Corp., Rockefeller
Center Management Corp., Rockefeller Group Telecommunications
Services Inc., Radio City Music Hall Productions Inc., and Cushman &amp;
Wakefield, in which the company holds an 80 percent stake.

   Rockefeller Group Inc. is seeking to sell a major stake in the family-owned company to outside investors for more than $1 billion, according to people familiar with the proposed transaction. 

   Sources said the company, which owns Rockefeller Center in Manhattan among other assets, is seeking between $1.3 billion and $2 billion. 
Various proposals that have been discussed would involve the sale of from 40% to 80% of the company, the sources said. 

   The plan represents another in a series of moves to raise cash for a generation of Rockefellers whose inheritance is tied up in real estate and other corporate holdings. 

   Rockefeller Group's investment banker, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., is preparing a prospectus which will be available by the end of this month to a limited group of potential investors, people close to the transaction said. 
Family members are hoping to be able to raise the cash without losing control over the management of company assets, the sources said. 

   Richard A. Voell, Rockefeller Group's president said: "The board has authorized us to explore different strategic alternatives or a recapitalization of the company." 
He said the alternatives include a long-term financial restructuring of the company or a sale of shares. 

   Mr. Voell said the goal of any such transaction would be to raise more capital for the company and provide liquidity for current shareholders. 
He said the investor or buyer must "share the long-term interests of the company." 

   Japanese firms and institutional investors who are aware of the offer are said to be interested already, in large part because Rockefeller Group's real-estate portfolio includes the "trophy" properties such investors crave. 

   Built during the Great Depression, the core of Rockefeller Center is known for its Art Deco-style buildings which overlook a famous ice-skating rink, a Christmas tree in the winter and a gilded statue of Prometheus. 
The center includes 30 Rockefeller Plaza (formerly the RCA building, now the General Electric Building), where National Broadcasting Co. is a major tenant. 
In addition, there are more modern structures, including the Time-Life and McGraw-Hill buildings. 

   In addition to Rockefeller Center, the company's assets include 80% of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, the national real-estate brokerage and consulting firm; Rockefeller Center Development Corp., which controls prime New York and New Jersey properties; Radio City Music Hall Productions Inc.; Rockefeller Center Telecommunications Services; and a financial-services unit. 

   Among recent moves to raise cash for the Rockefeller family, Rockefeller Group refinanced the 19-building Rockefeller Center in 1985 by taking out a $1.3 billion mortgage on some of the rentable space and then selling shares in that mortgage to the public through a real-estate investment trust. 

   The publicly held REIT has an option to convert its mortgage to a 71% ownership stake in the mortgaged property by the year 2000. 
The mortgage held by the REIT applies to six million of the 15 million square feet of rentable space in Rockefeller Center. 

   Also in 1985, Rockefeller Group sold a 15% equity interest to outside investors. 
More recently, it sold properties around the country. 

   The company's Rockefeller Center Development Corp. unit manages and operates the 22-acre center, and sources familiar with the latest plan said the company wants to continue to manage the complex because of the center's link to the Rockefeller family name and image. 

   The sources said the company may seek a group of investors who together would control a majority stake in the company, but who individually would own less than any member of the Rockefeller family. 

   But sources said this time it may not be easy to find investors willing to comply with Rockefeller Group's stipulations that the real-estate, entertainment and communications businesses remain under one umbrella. 

   The company also controls a vacant midtown Manhattan site on the west side of the center where a proposed skyscraper may be built. 
The development unit also controls a 678-acre site in Mount Olive, N.J., about half of which is slated for office development. 

   The Rockefeller family fortune was built by John D. Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil Co., who amassed by 1911 a fortune of $900 million, the equivalent of many billions in today's dollars. 
His son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., created a series of five trusts for his children in 1934, funding each with about $50 million. 
Today, the trusts are the principal owner of Rockefeller Group, and the descendants of John D. Jr. are the beneficiaries. 
As the descendants proliferate, the family pie is being sliced into more and more pieces. 
Many of the fourth generation are middle-aged and saddled by financial obligations. 
And even some of the fifth generation are in their 30s and eager for cash to finance their business efforts.

   Mitsubishi Estate Co., a major developer and property owner in Japan, has agreed to pay $846 million to acquire a 51% stake in Rockefeller Group Inc., Rockefeller officials said. 

   Rockefeller Group owns the 22-acre, 19-building Rockefeller Center in midtown Manhattan. 
Mitsubishi is a partner in Citicorp Plaza in Los Angeles and Pacwest Center in Portland, Ore., and owns most of the land beneath Tokyo's Marunouchi central business district, often referred to as the Rockefeller Center of Tokyo. 

   In 1985, Rockefeller Group sold a mortgage on the core of Rockefeller Center to the public in the form of a real estate investment trust. 
The trust has an option to convert its shares to a 71.5% equity stake in the center by the year 2000. 
Analysts say a sale of Rockefeller Group shares should not affect the trust's value. 

   If the trust exercises its option as expected, Mitsubishi will gain only a minority stake in the most prestigious section of the center, which was built during the Great Depression. 
Among the Rockefeller Group holdings not encumbered by the trust are the Time &amp; Life building, a majority stake in the McGraw-Hill building, a prime development site on the Manhattan's West Side and certain development rights. 

   Sources familiar with the transaction say officials at some Rockefeller units are unhappy with the deal. 
Managers of Rockefeller's Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc., a national real estate brokerage, have reportedly structured a company buy-out plan which was rejected by its parent. 
Cushman President Arthur J. Mirante II had no comment on reports of the buy-out effort or the Mitsubishi acquisition. 
But the sources say Rockefeller was seeking at least $200 million for the real estate services firm, a price that would make a buy-out impractical for the managers. 
Cushman's management is made up of top brokers who are considered the firm's major asset and whose cooperation is regarded as vital to its success. 
Sources estimate Cushman will have 1989 revenue of more than $275 million. 

   Rockefeller Group said in September it would seek investors to purchase as much as 80% of the firm, a holding company for Rockefeller family interests. 
Mitsubishi has agreed to acquire 627,000 shares of Rockefeller common stock held by trusts established by John D. Rockefeller in 1934. 

   When people "understand the resources of Mitsubishi they'll see it represents an exciting future for the company," said Richard A. Voell, president of Rockefeller Group. 

   William G. Bowen, chairman of the committee that oversees the family trusts, said the deal meets the committee's objective of diversification of the family's assets. 

   David Rockefeller, chairman of Rockefeller Group, said the company talked with many potential investors in Japan, the United States and Europe. 
But Mr. Rockefeller said he has a 20-year association with Mitsubishi from his days as chairman of Chase Manhattan Corp. 

   Koyata Hosokawa, executive vice president of Mitsubishi, said the company has spent years studying the U.S. real estate market. 

   Sources say Rockefeller Group had distributed a "fact book" to international real estate investors including Mitsui Real Estate Development Co. of Japan and Canada's Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. 

   Before yesterday's announcement, many observers wondered whether a Japanese buyer would be willing to acquire a piece of such high-profile American real estate. 
It is understood that Japanese buyers shied from bidding on the 110-story Sears Tower in Chicago because purchasing the world's tallest building might stir anti-Japanese sentiments in the U.S. 

   Rockefeller Group's management unit will continue to manage Rockefeller Center, a stipulation insisted upon by Rockefeller Group.

   Mitsubishi Estate Co., which is buying a
controlling stake in the company that owns Rockefeller Center, says
it wants to be a good corporate citizen and will do nothing to add
to frictions over the purchase.
   ``Americans might feel as if they were being invaded by
Japanese, especially because they have special feelings toward
Rockefeller Center, which has been a landmark in New York,''
acknowledged Kiyoaki Hara, Mitsubishi's managing director.
   The Japanese company is paying $846 million to buy a 51 percent
stake in Rockefeller Group Inc. Rockefeller Group's most famous
asset is the 22-acre Manhattan development, with its skating rink,
annual Christmas tree, Radio City Music Hall and office towers.
   The purchase, announced Monday, comes a few weeks after Sony
Corp. agreed to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. for $3.4
billion, another deal that stirred concerns over rising Japanese
investment in the United States.
   Indeed, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., waxed political about
the deal on the Senate floor Tuesday in Washington.
   ``This year when they turn on the lights to that Christmas tree
in Rockefeller Center, we Americans are going to have to come to
grips with the reality that that great national celebration is
actually occurring on Japanese property,'' Lieberman said.
   The older 12-building Art Deco portion of Rockefeller Center,
including Radio City Music Hall, most likely will not be controlled
by Mitsubishi past the year 2000. That property is under a $1.3
billion convertible mortgage. The mortgage owners, a real estate
investment trust, have the right to convert their holding into a
71.5 percent ownership of of the property after 2000.
   After the expected conversion, Rockefeller Group would own only
28.5 percent, with Mitsubishi owning 51 percent of that, or about
14 percent.
   For Mitsubishi, the more valuable assets are the Time-Life
Building and a 50 percent interest in the McGraw-Hill Building,
which are in the newer portion of Rockefeller Center; as well as
Rockefeller Group's nationwide Cushman &amp; Wakefield commercial real
estate brokerage and prime real estate parcels in New York and New
Jersey.
   Mitsubishi Estate, one of the related Mitsubishi companies
involved in everything from cars and banking to shipbuilding and
home electronics, said in a statement it did not plan to send
executives to join in Rockefeller Group management, which will
continue to manage Rockefeller Center.
   Mitsubishi Estate, which was established in the 1890s, is
Japan's second-largest real estate company, with sales of $1.9
billion in fiscal 1988. The largest, Mitsui Real Estate Development
Co., had sales of $5.9 billion in the last fiscal year.
   Hara said the deal would enable Mitsubishi, trailing in overseas
real estate business, to catch up with its rivals, Sumitomo and
Mitsui, which also have made major inroads into U.S. commercial
real estate.
   Rockefeller Group has been controlled by a family whose name
stands for American capitalism. The trusts that manage the family's
interests said they sold their majority stake in the company to
diversify its holdings.
   Richard Voell, president and chief executive officer of
Rockefeller Group, issued a statement saying the purchase by
Mitsubishi would ``enhance the financial strength of RGI. It
ensures the company's ability to continue to invest in Rockefeller
Center to enhance its stature as the most modern and prestigious
commercial complex.''
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe told reporters that
buyouts become controversial only when Japanese are involved.
   ``When British, Dutch and other European countries have been
engaged in similar acts, no particular attention was given to that.
... People have to look over these differences of nationality and
cultural background to see if it is truly an acceptable transaction
in accordance with normal standards of economic transactions,''
Watanabe said.

   TOKYO -- Mitsubishi Estate Co. paid $416 million to boost
its holding in the company that partly owns and manages New
York's Rockefeller Center to 80% from 57.6%.
   The Japanese property company, one of the world's richest
developers with vast tracts in Tokyo's central business
district, bought the additional stake from Rockefeller family
trusts as part of an October 1989 agreement outlining terms
of its original purchase.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   That acquisition came to symbolize Japan's financial
strength and ability to buy U.S. property in the late 1980s.
Sensitive to the criticism the purchase aroused, a spokesman
for Mitsubishi Estate emphasized that the company's latest
purchase was made at the behest of the Rockefeller family
trusts, who exercised their right under the original
agreement to dispose of an additional shareholding.
   "This was a put option on the part of the Rockefellers,"
the spokesman said. "It was not the option of Mitsubishi
Estate."
   He said Mitsubishi Estate has no intention of altering the
management of Rockefeller Group Inc., which owns 28.5% of and
manages Rockefeller Center at the heart of midtown Manhattan.
The remainder is publicly held. Rockefeller Group also
comprises Rockefeller Group Telecommunications Services Inc.,
Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc. and Radio City Music Hall
Productions Inc.
   "Things stay the same, the management stays the same," the
Mitsubishi Estate official said.
   The latest transaction completes the second step of
Mitsubishi Estate's acquisition of Rockefeller Group. The
Japanese company originally paid $846 million for 626,812
shares, or 51%, of Rockefeller Group's stock. Last July, it
bought another 80,566 shares, or 6.6%, for $111 million.
   Friday's acquisition of 275,856 shares, or 22.4% of the
Rockefeller Group, is the final transfer of stock envisioned
under the original sale agreement. The Mitsubishi Estate
spokesman said the company has no intention at the moment of
increasing its holding further. He said the latest purchase
would be covered out of the Tokyo-based company's working
capital.
   A property analyst at a foreign securities company in
Tokyo said the purchase "won't make any material difference"
in Mitsubishi Estate's earnings, which derive mainly from
rents in Japanese office buildings.

<HEAD>Rockefeller Center Sale Spotlights Changes in Family that Shaped

   When he announced his family's plans to sell
Rockefeller Center, David Rockefeller said the deal ``preserves the
abiding commitment'' to New York City his father made 50 years ago,
``and which generations of the family continue to feel.''
   But the sale to one of Japan's largest real estate companies
underscored a change in the relationship between the Rockefellers
and New York, and offered a reminder that the city will have to
face the next century with relatively little assistance from a
family that helped it through this one.
   New York has had many rich and powerful families such as the
deLanceys, the Astors and the Vanderbilts, but none shaped the city
like the Rockefellers.
   The family's accumulated works range from the stone towers of
the Cloisters, a museum in the shape of a monastery in northern
Manhattan, to the gleaming steel ones of the World Trade Center
downtown.
   In between there is Lincoln Center, the Museum of Modern Art,
the Museum of the City of New York, Rockefeller University,
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the Asia Society, Chase
Manhattan Plaza.
   ``Where else,'' asks historian Henry Hope Reed, ``can we find so
large a contribution by one family, and a contribution so diverse?''
   Not Japan, apparently. Last weekend, at a conference on
philanthropy at the Rockefeller estate in Pocantico Hills, Japanese
experts explained that the Japanese do not have the philanthropic
tradition that the Rockefellers epitomize; they traditionally look
to government for such services.
   Japan's Mitsubishi Estate Co. said Monday it would pay $846
million to buy a 51 percent stake in Rockefeller Group Inc.
Rockefeller Group's most famous asset is the 22-acre Rockefeller
Center in midtown Manhattan, with its skating rink, annual
Christmas tree, Radio City Music Hall and office buildings. The
Associated Press Building, the news service's world headquarters,
is located in the center.
   News of the purchase was accompanied by assurances the center
will be maintained with the attention for which the Rockefellers
are renowned.
   But New York knows what a difference an individual can make in
the life of a city, because of the examples of John D. Rockefeller
Jr., the man who built Rockefeller Center during the Depression.
   He began life as the son of the nation's richest man, who was
notorious for ruthlessly eliminating competition to monopolize the
U.S. oil-refining industry at the turn of the century.
   As Peter Collier and David Horowitz note in their book, ``The
Rockefellers,'' the son created a philanthropic empire as
impressive as the father's business one. For Junior, ``giving was a
profession, a vocation,'' in which he helped his father spend $500
million and then gave away another $500 million himself.
   Although his gifts were widespread _ he preserved thousands of
acres of Western wilderness and restored colonial Williamsburg, Va.
_ New York City was his focus.
   ``The city was his passion, making it a better place,'' said
Paul Gunther of the Municipal Art Society. ``The physical evidence
is everywhere. Those things would not have been built without him.''
   He built the Cloisters and the Riverside Church, a re-creation
of a French Gothic cathedral. He contributed $1 million to Union
Theological Seminary and built International House for foreign
students.
   In December 1946, hours before the United Nations was set to
establish its headquarters outside New York City, Rockefeller
agreed to pay $8.5 million for a site on the East River, which he
gave to the world body.
   ``Why, Pa, that's most generous!'' his son Nelson, later to
become governor of New York and then vice president, told him.
   Rockefeller's children followed his lead, playing dominant or
vital roles in the creation of Lincoln Center, the World Trade
Center and numerous other projects.
   Today, there still is a vast Rockefeller commitment to
philanthropy. But John D. Jr.'s two surviving sons are in their
70s, and three years ago Fortune magazine concluded that the family
``is retreating from a tradition of massive giving.''
   The family's fourth generation, the 22 men and women who call
themselves the Cousins, range in age from 22 to 61. By some
accounts they give away as much as $40 million a year. But the
original family of eight that lived under one roof has multiplied
and scattered across the nation, and their charitable concerns
have, too.
   Few of the cousins live in New York now, and the city is not a
primary focus of their philanthropy, said Gunther.
   The city also has changed. ``It was a lot easier to assemble
land and get things built in (John D. Jr.'s) days,'' said George
Taylor Jr., a family spokesman.

   Mitsubishi Estate Co., the company buying a
majority stake in the owner of Manhattan's famed Rockefeller
Center, is not a Sony, or anything like it.
   Sony Corp., the consumer electronics manufacturer that is buying
Columbia Pictures for $3.4 billion, is seen in Japan as a brash,
innovative upstart.
   Mitsubishi Estate is an aristocratic collector of rents that
belongs to the Mitsubishi group, considered a grand, rather gray
old lady among Japanese business circles.
   The company's planned $846 million investment in the symbolic
heart of Manhattan was characterized by analysts on Tuesday as an
attempt to branch out from Mitsubishi's conservative base.
   Although the company's profitability is high, it trails other
Japanese property firms in overseas investment and overall growth.
   For its New York foray, Mitsubishi sought an equally prestigious
partner. As brand names are important to the Japanese tourists
mobbing the boutiques at Rockefeller Center, the same holds for
companies like Mitsubishi.
   ``They were looking for a top-tier name,'' Tadashi Kato, an
analyst at Prudential Bache Securities, said.
   Japanese stock market investors don't know much about
privately-held Rockefeller Group except the name, but Mitsubishi
stock closed up 150 points at 2,680 yen Tuesday on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange after the deal was announced.
   The Mitsubishi name rings of 19th-century oligarchs, wartime
tycoons and the postwar government-business establishment.
   Mitsubishi managers are known as quintessential organization men
in a country of organization men. Its blue-suited employees
traditionally have been considered the cream of the elite, the kind
of solid, well-heeled men people want their daughters to marry _ a
far cry from some of the Japanese real estate wheeler-dealers
famous in the United States but infamous at home.
   The Rockefeller and Mitsubishi empires began as products of the
same era, the robber-baron days of the late 19th and early 20th
centuries. Yataro Iwasaki started the Mitsubishi fortune in
shipbuilding, John D. Rockefeller in oil. With Japan's wartime
expansion, Mitsubishi grew into one of Japan's leading
``zaibatsu,'' or business combines.
   Both empires fell victim to trust-busting. Mitsubishi's
209-company combine was broken up and family influence virtually
eliminated in the postwar dissolution of the zaibatsu by the
occupying Americans.
   Mitsubishi group no longer is controlled by a single holding
company, but its 41 companies maintain relations through a system
of cross-shareholding known as ``keiretsu.'' Companies operate
independently and often compete against each other, but in times of
need all know they can depend on Mitsubishi Bank for help.
Mitsubishi Trust owns 7.3 percent of Mitsubishi Estate, and
Mitsubishi Bank owns 4.1 percent.
   Group companies produce everything from gasoline to chemicals,
steel, automobiles, paper, electronic equipment, weapons and
aircraft, with a trading company buying and selling worldwide.
   Mitsubishi Estate ``is seen as a gentlemanly company in a
business that in Japan is seen as ungentlemanly,'' says James
Doherty, analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities.
   The company owns much of Tokyo's equivalent of Rockefeller
Center and midtown Manhattan _ the prestigious Marunouchi business
district next to the Imperial Palace, a stone's throw from the
glittering Ginza.
   Sitting on the most valuable contiguous piece of real estate in
the world, Mitsubishi collects rents at less than half market value
and still is the most profitable real estate company in Japan,
analysts say.
   Mitsubishi says it has the largest portfolio of office buildings
in Japan, 25 million square feet with a book value of more than $5
billion. Jardine Fleming estimated the real value at well over $70
billion at the beginning of 1988.
   But the long history of its Marunouchi property, which
Mitsubishi originally recovered from swampland on imperial orders
in the 19th century, is part of its problem.
   ``It's like it's this big diamond just sitting there,'' says
Alan Woodhull, analyst at Merrill Lynch.
   City regulations forbid Mitsubishi from tearing down existing
mid-rise buildings in Marunouchi for more efficient high-rises. The
company can't raise rents of long-term tenants to market levels in
part because of legal restrictions, in part because some of those
tenants are Mitsubishi group companies.
   Mitsubishi still hopes to get permission to redevelop
Marunouchi. Meanwhile, it has started a huge reclaimed land project
in Tokyo Bay off Yokohama, where it is building Japan's tallest
skyscraper.
   Overseas, it plans to expand business that has lagged far behind
other Japanese companies. Mitsubishi has invested only 5 percent of
its assets outside Japan, the company says.
   Mitsubishi's overseas holdings include the 777 Tower building in
Los Angeles' Citicorp Plaza and a 1,000-acre Sunrise resort project
in Palm Desert, Calif.
   Analysts say Mitsubishi is likely to take a hands-off approach
to its 51 percent share in the Rockefeller Group, which includes
the management of the Rockefeller Center Development Corp., the
Cushman and Wakefield real estate firm and Radio City Music Hall
Productions.
   ``A company like Mitsubishi doesn't mind low yields. If they
don't get a quick return, that wouldn't faze them at all,'' said
Doherty.

   Major U.S. and Japanese concerns, including Nippon Life Insurance Co., Mitsubishi Estate Inc. and JMB Realty Co., have voiced interest in acquiring a stake in Rockefeller Group Inc., according to individuals familiar with the proposed Rockefeller sale. 

   John C. Cushman III, the flamboyant Los Angeles real-estate developer and broker, said he, too, would like to be part of a group investing in the Rockefeller Group, a private holding company owned by Rockefeller family trusts. 
Mr. Cushman, who has extensive connections with Japanese real-estate investors, said he is trying to put together a transaction with a domestic company and a foreign investment group, which he wouldn't name. 

   Earlier this month, Rockefeller Group said it will pursue a recapitalization plan. 
Sources say the company's decision to offer between about 48% and 80% of the company to outside investors is intended to raise an estimated $1 billion to $1.3 billion for the family. 

   The company's real-estate holdings include the landmark Rockefeller Center in New York, which it also manages. 
In addition, it operates a real-estate development company, an entertainment unit, a telecommunications business and a financial-services division. 
It holds about 80% of Cushman &amp; Wakefield, a national real-estate services concern based in New York. 

   Mr. Cushman, the California broker, is a descendent of founders of Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc., where he worked for about 15 years. 
He left the New York brokerage concern in the late 1970s after unsuccessful attempts to take it over. 
"I've known the Rockefeller family for years and have great respect for them. 
They are aware of my interest," he said. 

   Richard A. Voell, president of Rockefeller Group, said, "We've received scores of calls from investors in Japan, the United States and Europe." 
He said the response came following a report in The Wall Street Journal earlier this month describing the company's plans to raise cash. 
He wouldn't comment on names of interested parties. 

   Mr. Voell and his financial advisers stressed that when a "fact book" on the transaction is completed -- sometime in the next several weeks -- it will be offered to only a limited, pre-selected group of potential investors. 

   Rockefeller's board has retained the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. to consider alternatives for providing a debt or equity infusion into the company. 
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. is the investment banker for the Rockefeller family trustees. 

   Ray Mikulich, Shearson managing director, said he wouldn't confirm or deny interest by such companies as Nippon Life, of Tokyo, one of the world's largest institutional investors; Mitsubishi Estate, a major Tokyo developer and international property owner; and JMB, a diversified U.S. real-estate concern based in Chicago. 

   Mr. Mikulich said he has received inquiries from individuals and corporations seeking a stake in the entire company as well as just certain assets. 
He added that while Shearson is scrutinizing many alternatives, the Rockefeller Group's primary objective is to offer a stake in the entire company.

There is a difference that goes just a bit beyond the Radio City Music Hall and 
the Rockettes. Even in the forest of towers that is Manhattan, Rockefeller 
Center is something special. It consists of 19 buildings covering 22 acres 
between Fifth and Sixth avenues and 48th and 52nd streets. The core of 
Rockefeller Center was opened in the depths of the Great Depression -- to many, 
a promise of American dynamism to come. 
</P>
<P>
The centerpiece was, and is, the Art Deco 70-story RCA Building, still the 
sixth tallest in New York. For those visitors who for some reason did not 
travel to the top of Empire State, the RCA Building offered a special 
attraction, a splendid view of the Empire State Building. Others know 
Rockefeller Center for its ice skating rink, graced during the holidays by its 
famous Christmas tree. The glamorous shops of Fifth Avenue are nearby. 
</P>
<P>
The center also symbolized the massive wealth of the Rockefeller family. But 
times change. The Rockefellers needed a little cash recently to meet trust 
obligations so they sold majority control of the office complex to Mitsubishi 
Estate Co. in an $868-million deal. The Japanese government was said to be 
upset that Mitsubishi contributed to the impression that it was buying up 
America so soon after the Sony deal with Warner Communications. But while many 
New Yorkers complained, Mayor Ed Koch said not to worry: "Radio City Music Hall 
will go on forever." That's not quite true, either. Since General Electric took 
over RCA and its network subsidiary RCA, what used to be the RCA Building is 
now the GE Building. How does Mitsubishi Center strike you?

<P>
Yataro Iwasaki was a man with an eye for real estate. In 1890, the founder of 
the Mitsubishi Zaibatsu -- a large industrial combine that later spawned a 
loose family of 41 companies with combined annual revenue approaching $200 
billion -- bought a tract of swampy land adjacent to the Imperial Palace. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Iwasaki's little corner of Tokyo is potentially the most valuable turf 
in the world. It lies beneath the concrete bedrock of the premier business 
districts of Marunouchi and Otemachi. 
</P>
<P>
Nearly a century after the entrepreneur bought his 87 acres from the central 
government, most of the land is still in the hands of his corporate heirs and 
its value has skyrocketed so high during the postwar real estate boom that 
nobody seems to know exactly how much it is worth. The book value is $5 
billion, but analysts say that figure is so low that it is meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
Now the foremost landlord to Japan Inc. is about to become America's most 
conspicuous property owner. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Estate Co., formed out of the real estate division of Iwasaki's 
Mitsubishi conglomerate in 1937, announced in Tokyo and New York on Monday that 
it plans to acquire a 51% stake in the Rockefeller Group, the real estate 
investment arm of the Rockefeller family trusts. 
</P>
<P>
The $846-million investment would give Mitsubishi Estate at least nominal 
controlling interest in Rockefeller Center, which includes Depression-era Art 
Deco landmarks in Midtown Manhattan such as Radio City Music Hall and the RCA 
Building. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi's financial gambit may stir up unpleasant emotions in those who are 
concerned about the flood of Japanese and other foreign investments in the 
United States, but these critics might have a hard time arguing that the 
Mitsubishi-Rockefeller deal represents any kind of clash of cultural values. 
</P>
<P>
In a curious way, Iwasaki and his Mitsubishi men have a lot in common with John 
D. Rockefeller, founder of the Standard Oil trust, and the scions of his 
all-American zaibatsu. 
</P>
<P>
So apparent was this affinity that Raymond F. Pettit, senior vice president and 
chief financial officer for the Rockefeller Group, told reporters in Tokyo that 
Mitsubishi was chosen over nine other Japanese and foreign suitors because of a 
certain "chemistry" at the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
In Mitsubishi Estate, the stewards of the Rockefeller legacy saw the kind of 
stolid and conservative investor that would make a long-term commitment to "the 
quality, the traditions and the values associated with the Rockefeller family," 
William G. Bowen, chairman of the Rockefeller Trust Committee, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
Iwasaki, like the original Rockefeller, had a relatively humble start -- for a 
samurai. The son of a minor feudal clan on the island of Shikoku, he struck out 
in business in 1870 with a shipping and mail courier service plying the coastal 
waters between Tokyo and Osaka. He would later win government concessions for 
mail routes to the United States and China, and would merge with his bitter 
rival. 
</P>
<P>
Japan in the late 19th Century had only recently emerged from nearly three 
centuries of feudal isolation and was engaged in an intense national effort to 
build military might and catch up with the industrialized West. A handful of 
capitalists such as Iwasaki played major roles in their country's rapid 
development by taking over state-owned industries and forming huge industrial 
and financial conglomerates, the zaibatsu. 
</P>
<P>
By 1890, the year Iwasaki made his farsighted real estate purchase in Tokyo, 
Mitsubishi had diversified into finance, mining, shipbuilding and heavy 
machinery. The company grew into one of three major zaibatsu, along with Mitsui 
and Sumitomo, and was tightly held by the Iwasaki clan until the 1920s, when 
public shares were first issued. 
</P>
<P>
The subsidiary Mitsubishi Heavy Industries would later build the Zero fighter 
planes that tormented U.S. fleets in the Pacific during World War II and would 
launch the world's largest battleship, the Musashi. Like the rest of corporate 
Japan, Mitsubishi was an integral part of the war machine. 
</P>
<P>
"We must perform our duty with a clear-cut resolve to serve, above all things, 
the interests of the state," Koyota Iwasaki, a descendant of the founder who 
became president of the trust company controlling the zaibatsu, told a 
gathering of top Mitsubishi executives two days after the Dec. 7, 1941, attack 
on Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Where the stories of the Iwasakis and their fellow zaibatsu families differ 
from those of the Rockefellers or the Carnegies is that it took three or four 
decades for the concept of anti-monopolistic regulation to reach the Japanese 
islands, and only then at the insistence of postwar U.S. occupation 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Supreme Court broke up Rockefeller's Standard Oil Co. in 1911. The 
American-inspired dissolution of the Japanese monopolies after the war was only 
half completed, however, when they were allowed to reassemble as loosely 
structured industrial groups, now known as keiretsu. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi's case is typical of how the zaibatsu have survived. Gone are family 
control and the trust company that was once at the top of the pyramid. But 
Mitsubishi Corp., the general trading subsidiary, reassembled itself 
immediately after the American occupation ended in 1947 and now "coordinates" 
the activities of the group. The heads of the 41 companies in the group meet 
monthly to map out strategies in what is euphemistically called a presidents' 
club. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries also reunited after a breakup to reestablish itself 
as Japan's leading defense contractor. Most notably, it is the company that 
will take the lead in developing the fighter jet of the next generation, the 
FSX, subject of much controversy earlier this year. American critics nearly 
scuttled a U.S.-Japan development program, warning that Mitsubishi Heavy would 
use U.S. military technology to gain international dominance in the commercial 
aerospace industry (a charge that Mitsubishi denied). 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Estate, like the other companies in the group, is operated 
independently yet remains 20.9% owned by Mitsubishi Group affiliates -- 
demonstrating the classic pattern of cross-shareholdings and interlocking 
directorates that U.S. officials say can generate the kind of clannish business 
relationships that become "structural impediments" to free trade. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi companies have not been singled out in ongoing trade negotiations, 
but serious question might be raised as to whether an American company could 
ever make an investment in Japan comparable to Mitsubishi Estate's proposed 
stake in the Rockefeller Group. As such, the deal is likely to match Sony 
Corp.'s $3.4-billion bid for Columbia Pictures as a symbol of imbalance in 
economic relations between the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockefeller venture will not be Mitsubishi Estate's first move into the 
U.S. market, but it is its most obvious. The company developed a 102-acre 
residential tract in Jupiter, Fla., 16 years ago, but now refuses to disclose 
financial details. It joined partnerships constructing an office building in 
Portland, Ore., in the early 1980s, and is involved in a 1,000-acre resort 
project in Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
The company's only major undertaking to date has been its investment, with two 
other partners, in the 777 Tower building at Citicorp Plaza in Los Angeles, a 
$500-million project that will have 3 million square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Back home, Mitsubishi Estate has a reputation among industry analysts as a 
conservative and cumbersome giant that has missed many opportunities in 
overseas real estate while its rivals were acting more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
The security represented by the company's holdings in the Marunouchi and 
Otemachi districts, where it owns 32 major buildings and still has title to 
about 50 acres, perhaps accounts for the complacency. Add 39 office buildings 
in other parts of Tokyo and elsewhere in Japan, for a total of 25 million 
square feet of office space, and Mitsubishi stands out as Japan's largest 
commercial landlord. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, rental income makes it by far the country's most profitable real estate 
concern. It takes in about $269 million a year in after-tax profit on more than 
$2 billion in gross revenue. 
</P>
<P>
The company is also beginning to assert itself with high-profile development 
projects, such as the 75-story Landmark Tower it plans to start building soon 
at the Minato Mirai complex in Yokohama. It will be Japan's tallest building. 
</P>
<P>
Yet real estate analysts say the company faces some tough bureaucratic 
wrangling before it can capitalize on its so-called latent assets in the 
Marunouchi and Otemachi business districts. Mitsubishi has been unable to 
persuade Tokyo metropolitan authorities to revise density limits for the area, 
so the eight- to 10-story office blocks now lining the streets may represent 
the maximum development for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
The core of the city, meanwhile, may move west to the urban hub of Shinjuku, 
where a cluster of skyscrapers stands and city authorities envision erecting a 
new financial district on landfill islands in Tokyo Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Iwasaki's 99-year-old investment in Tokyo real estate is hardly losing 
value. Results of recent surveys suggest that the cost of commercial land is 
leveling off, but not even the most pessimistic analyst predicts a crash. At 
last reckoning earlier this year, the National Land Agency calculated the 
market price of land in the Marunouchi district as holding firm at more than 
$22,000 a square foot, a rate that might make the Empire State Building seem 
cheap -- if it were for sale.

   The Supreme Court has agreed to resolve a
dispute that could put at risk the federal protection for the
pensions of 30 million U.S. workers.
   The justices said Monday they will decide what authority the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., a federal agency, has to order
employers to revive scraped pension plans.
   A federal appeals court limited such authority by setting aside
the agency's order that LTV Corp. and a subsidiary, LTV Steel Co.,
restore three pension plans with unfunded liabilities of $2.3
billion.

   Nearly half of the lake acreage in 34 states
is badly polluted or likely soon to become that way, the
Environmental Protection Agency said today.
   The EPA's latest survey of lake water quality shows that serious
pollution problems have impaired about one-fourth of more than 12
million acres of lakes examined in those states. Pollution
threatens similar impairment in another 20 percent of the lake
acres.
   While the causes for the lake pollution varied, three-fourths of
the pollution was attributed to agricultural and urban runoffs.
Another 11 percent was blamed on industrial or sewage releases and
the remainder to natural causes.
   Meanwhile, the EPA was named in a lawsuit Monday charging that
the agency has failed to develop national standards for toxic
pollution of public waterways.

   The Bush administration is exploring with the

   The Washington Post in today's editions said a meeting between
President Bush and Gorbachev might be held as early as December at

   Two U.S. officials confirmed tentative discussions were under
way with Moscow, but declined to discuss the substance of the Post
report. ``It's on the right track,'' said one official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The planning is evidently being conducted in exceptional

   Last month, as the Rockettes strutted their stuff at Radio
City Music Hall's Christmas Spectacular in New York, lawyers
for two of America's wealthiest families were fighting over
the dancers in Delaware.
   The ongoing legal battle pits the Pritzkers of Chicago
against the Rockefellers of New York -- families whose
fortunes are estimated at more than $4 billion apiece. The
fight began in October 1989 when cash-strapped Radio City, a
Rockefeller Group company, sought help in funding an "Easter
Extravaganza" modeled on its popular Christmas show.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Pritzkers were naturals as investors. Radio City
relies on the Pritzker-controlled Ticketmaster Corp. to sell
seats for its performances. Ticketmaster's chairman, Fred
Rosen, and Radio City's president, James McManus, have known
each other for years.
   After brief negotiations with Mr. McManus, Pritzker-owned
Red Sail Co. and a group led by New York-based Delphi Capital
Corp. together pledged $5 million for a partnership with
Radio City that was to last 14 years. For that money, the
partnership got rights to a substantial portion of the
profits from the Easter show at Radio City and won permission
to tour Rockette shows and sell Rockette souvenirs.
   John Pritzker, Red Sail's chairman, saw endless
possibilities for profiting from the troupe. At the outset,
the partnership says, Radio City's Mr. McManus estimated the
returns from the Easter show alone at $130 million over 14
years. There would also be Rockette dolls, sweatshirts,
leotards and hosiery. And the partnership looked forward to
taking the Rockettes on tour, particularly in Japan.
   "It's easy to sell Rockette stuff in Japan," Mr. Pritzker
says, adding, "It's like selling water to somebody who hasn't
had any in a week."
   But four days after the contract was inked, Rockefeller
Group announced that Mitsubishi Estate Co., a member of
Mitsubishi Group, had bought a controlling interest in it --
and thus in its Radio City unit. The Pritzkers say in a
lawsuit filed last year in Delaware that by early 1990, when
Rockefeller Group executives finally learned about the deal
Radio City's Mr. McManus had signed with the Pritzker group,
they told the Pritzkers to forget about the contract. With
well-heeled Mitsubishi in the picture, they wouldn't be
needing the Pritzkers' money. Mitsubishi, the partnership
says it was told, wanted to tour the Rockettes in Japan by
itself.
   In court papers, Jonathan Green, Rockefeller Group's
general counsel, acknowledges the accord with the Pritzkers
had become "an embarrassment" to Rockefeller Group and
Mitsubishi.
   The Pritzker partnership says that almost from the start,
Rockefeller Group has made life miserable for it by "padding"
the show's budget with undocumented expenses for overtime and
costumes. Radio City, it says, has also refused to tour the
Rockettes, and Rockefeller Group executives won't return its
calls.
   "I don't want people to be of the impression that we're
trying to shake down the Rockefellers," says Mr. Pritzker,
the 38-year-old scion of Jay Pritzker, the Chicago magnate.
"It won't change our lifestyle dramatically if we win this
case," he adds, "but these guys have been absolutely
unconscionable. We'd all like to get out of this thing, but
we're not going to walk away."
   A Rockefeller Group spokesman confirms that there is
litigation but declines to comment beyond that. A lawyer for
Mitsubishi Estate declines to comment.
   The Rockettes, for their part, seem unaware of the fuss.
One breathless dancer, rushing out of an evening performance,
says, "I don't know what you're talking about." Bruce
Michael, the Rockettes' producer, says, "I have no knowledge
of any of this." Nor does he care, he says, because "the
Rockettes are doing very, very well" as is.
   Indeed, the 50 or so Rockettes are doing fine. Since the
dancers made their debut in St. Louis in 1925, they have
become the best-known precision troupe in the world.
   But Mr. Pritzker says he thinks the Rockettes could do
much better. Touring the Christmas and Easter shows, he says,
would give the women more work and make his group and Radio
City millions. And he believes that the combination of Radio
City, the Rockettes and the Pritzker family's holdings should
make this "one of the great marriages of all time."
   The Pritzkers are a close-knit family that has built one
of the world's most successful business empires over the last
three decades. Their holdings include Hyatt Corp., the hotel
company, and Ticketmaster, the nation's largest computerized
ticketing service whose biggest client is Radio City. They
also own a group of arenas where the Rockettes might perform
and a merchandising company that could make and sell
Rockettes dolls.
   Much of the Rockefeller's family fortune went into
Rockefeller Group. When the family needed cash in the
mid-1980s, it sold a 60% interest in Rockefeller Center to
the public. Then, in 1989, it sold a 51% interest in
Rockefeller Group to Mitsubishi. Last year the Japanese
conglomerate boosted that stake to 80%.
   In April 1990, the Easter show returned to Radio City
after an 11-year hiatus. The 90-minute show opened to rave
reviews. Variety said that it could be called "the greatest
show on earth" -- if, that is, "the expression didn't already
belong to someone else." In its first year, the show had a
profit of $550,000.
   But behind the scenes, the legal battle was flaring. At a
meeting in April 1990, Mr. Pritzker says that Rockefeller
Group's Mr. Green threatened to sic "a battery of lawyers" on
the Pritzker group if it didn't voluntarily relinquish its
14-year rights to the Easter show and to touring the
Rockettes. Mr. Green says in a deposition he doesn't remember
issuing that warning.
   The next month, Mr. Pritzker and his father, Jay, met with
David Rockefeller, Rockefeller Group's chairman, to discuss
the matter. "Dad and I were in awe" of the family's current
patriarch, the younger Mr. Pritzker says. "The Rockefeller
persona was bigger than life." He says Mr. Rockefeller was
"very gracious" and assured the Pritzkers that the situation
would be "taken care of."
   It apparently wasn't. The Pritzkers say that Rockefeller
Group is now using "scorched earth" tactics to send them
packing. Last year's budget, they say, was nearly twice as
high as expected; they say that they were charged some
$162,000 for new costumes, even though a Radio City spokesman
concedes that none were purchased, and that $147,000 was
allocated for overtime last year, compared with none in 1990.
Radio City has refused to allow the Rockettes to tour the
Christmas and Easter shows, the Pritzkers say, and hasn't
contacted them at all about this year's show.
   In the worst blow of all, last November Radio City
withheld all but $79,000 of the $522,000 of profit from the
1991 show to which the Pritzkers believe their group is
entitled. Rockefeller Group, they say, told them that the
money was needed to cover legal expenses related to the
lawsuit. In the lawsuit, the Pritzker Group is asking that
Rockefeller Group be ordered to live up to the terms of the
agreement and pay unspecified damages.
   In the meantime, nearly two dozen lawyers in New York and
Delaware are involved in the case. Although the partnership
has offered to take $20 million to settle the suit,
Rockefeller Group has refused.
   "If someone called to ask if they should be partners with
the Rockefellers, I'd stay away," Mr. Pritzker says.

FT  18 NOV 94 / International Company News: Rockefeller denies reports of
mortgage default on centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Rockefeller Group, which owns the Rockefeller Centre office complex in
Manhattan, yesterday denied reports that it could soon default on its
mortgage payments on the centre.
Rockefeller Group is 80 per cent controlled by Mitsubishi Estate of Japan
while the other 20 per cent of Rockefeller Group is in the hands of the
Rockefeller family.
In a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
holder of the Dollars 1.3bn mortgage on the complex - the real estate
investment trust Rockefeller Centre Properties (RCP) - warned there was
'substantial concern' about the ability of Rockefeller Group to meet its
mortgage payments. Due to the depressed state of the New York commercial
property market, Rockefeller Centre's rental income has not been able to
cover its mortgage payments for years.
Yesterday the Rockefeller Group said the next monthly Dollars 46.5m interest
payment on the mortgage had been paid, and it remained committed to
'maintaining the Rockefeller Centre as the premier commercial property in
the world'.
Although Mitsubishi and the Rockefeller family have made up the Dollars 300m
annual cash shortfall on the Rockefeller Centre's books for the past five
years, the SEC filing raised doubts about Mitsubishi's willingness to
continue covering the large losses.
If Mitsubishi pulled out of its commitment to cover the losses and the
property defaulted, ownership of the centre would revert to RCP as the
mortgage holder.
Although property analysts have long doubted whether Mitsubishi would cut
its losses because of the damage such a move would inflict on its
reputation, the SEC filing indicated that RCP believed the Japanese group
may be close to changing its mind.
When Mitsubishi bought majority control of the landmark art-deco complex for
Dollars 1.4bn in 1989, it was one of the most high-profile Japanese
investments in the US. Soon after that deal the New York property market
collapsed and the 19-building complex is estimated to be worth less than
Dollars 1bn.

O. Stillman Rockefeller, 30-year-old heir to the Rockefeller and Carnegie 
fortunes, today was flown back to New York City for treatment of shark bites he 
suffered off a Fiji island owned by the estate of the late publisher Malcolm 
Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
The son of former banker James S. Rockefeller and his wife, the former Nancy 
Carnegie of the steel family, returned to the United States accompanied by a 
medical team, according to a spokesman for Forbes magazine. 
</P>
<P>
He was being treated at a New York area hospital. His condition was not 
immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
Rockefeller was guest on Forbes-owned Laucala Island resort when the shark 
attack occurred Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Rockefeller, one of America's most eligible bachelors, belongs to the 
Greenwich, Conn., branch of the Rockefeller family established by William 
Rockefeller, brother of the original John D. Rockefeller of oil empire fame. 
</P>
<P>
He is a second cousin of Michael Rockefeller, son of late Vice President Nelson 
A. Rockefeller, who disappeared in Papua New Guinea in 1961. His fate remains a 
mystery but it was widely believed at the time that he was eaten by crocodiles.

   Some heirs to great family fortunes dabble in
art collecting. Others become renowned philanthropists.
   Ola Stillman Rockefeller is posing for underwear ads.
   Rockefeller, 30, is the newest pitchman for Jockey International
Inc. The company unveiled the magazine ad campaign at a news
conference Tuesday with the aid of baseball great Jim Palmer, who
is perhaps the best-known Jockey model.
   Rockefeller, according to material provided by his public
relations agency, has a ``recent penchant for art.'' He has
collaborated on collages with Mark Kostabi, a New York artist who
has mounted public relations stunts to promote his artworks.
   Rockefeller said Jockey came to him with the idea of posing for
the ads.
   ``I kind of hemmed and hawed,'' he said in an interview. ``I
really wanted to do it but then I thought, `Is my grandfather going
to kill me or cut me off or something?' But I eventually decided to
do it. I'm just sort of winging it.''
   He said his grandfather, James Stillman Rockefeller, former
chairman of First National City Bank of New York, opposed the plan
until the younger Rockefeller said he would give the proceeds to
Memorial-Sloan Kettering Hospital, a family charity.
   ``In some ways I am trying to create my own identity,''
Rockefeller said. ``Sometimes it's hard if you're the son of or
descendant of _ you're expected to play a certain role.''
   Rockefeller said he hopes the exposure he gains through the ads
_ in which he is tastefully garbed in plaid undershorts and a
T-shirt _ will help further his art aspirations.
   Rockefeller, whose great grandfather was a brother to John D.
Rockefeller, the founder of Standard Oil Co., said he's been
wearing Jockey underwear since he was 14.
   One of Rockefeller's cousins, James Stillman Rockefeller Rose,
said Rockefeller's plan to pose for the ad ``sort of came out
suddenly.''
   ``The only reason the family let him get away with it is that
he's donating the procedes to Sloan-Kettering,'' Rose said in a
telephone interview.
   Several years ago, Rockefeller announced he would launch a line
of men's clothing featuring the family crest. The clothes never
materialized, ``thank God,'' Rose said, adding that the family was
dismayed by the intended use of the crest.
   Rose, 30, described his cousin as the non-traditional member of
an otherwise low-key family.
   Rose, who helps manage a family-run investment company, said
that despite the trust funds _ the total of which dwindles with
each generation _ most members of his generation of the
Rockefellers are employed.
   ``We've have a much stronger work ethic than a lot of our
cousins on the other side of the family do, out of necessity and
training,'' he said.

<HEAD>When Dynasty-Owned Businesses Are Sold, Sentimental Value Comes

   The Rockefellers have sold control of the
Manhattan landmark bearing their name to a Japanese firm, and
several grandchildren of Campbell Soup Co.'s founder want that
company auctioned to strangers.
   You might ask how they can they sell the family businesses _
especially those with famous names. As time goes on, it becomes
easy.
   Emotional ties to a family-owned firm, hatched from scratch and
sweat by entrepreneurial ancestors, can weaken with each passing
generation until the company's asset value outweighs its
sentimental value and the corporation becomes an albatross to its
owners.
   For $846 million, the Rockefellers turned over a controlling
interest in Rockefeller Group Inc. to Mitsubishi Estate Co. In
relinquishing control, the Rockefellers parted with New York's
Rockefeller Center, the most visible and tangible symbol of their
family fortune, and also surrendered exclusive rights to the
Rockefeller name.
   Meanwhile, three grandchildren of Campbell founder John T.
Dorrance Sr. have split with other relatives and want the company
sold. The dissident Dorrances, while their names aren't emblazoned
on soup cans, also are willing to sever their connection with a
brand name familiar to millions worldwide.
   In some ways, the Rockefellers and Dorrances are like many other
heirs of successful business entrpreneurs. Having grown away from
the family company, they want to take their inheritance and move on.
   David Rockefeller Jr. is the great-great grandson of John D.
Rockefeller and the great-grandson of John D. Jr., the founder of
Rockefeller Center. He said recently that his generation has its
own priorities.
   ``I don't know how far the family, as individuals, would have
wanted to go if they had been asked to pump capital funds into
keeping up these buildings, compared to supporting charitable
causes or pursuing their own careers,'' Rockefeller said in an
interview in the magazine Manhattan Inc.
   ``Frankly, I'm not so sure that if it came down to that, that
they would have said, `The way we want to spend our money is to
buff up the marble down at the Center,'' Rockefeller was quoted as
saying. He refused to be interviewed for this story.
   It's nothing new for the descendants of a company founder to
sell off the family business and its well-known name _ the Fields
of Chicago did it twice.
   Marshall Field III, grandson of retailer Marshall Field, sold
the family's famous department store in 1941, and turned instead
toward journalism, building the Field Enterprises Inc. media empire.
   But more than 40 years later, in 1983, Marshall III's own
grandsons, Marshall Field V and Frederick Field, dissolved the
second family company after a dispute and went separate ways.
   Marshall Field V's current holdings include Field Corp., which
owns Funk &amp; Wagnalls Inc. and other publishers. Frederick Field is
among the investors in the group that bid recently for BAT
Industries PLC, the British conglomerate with properties that
ironically include Marshall Field.
   On the other hand, the Philadelphia-based department store
company Strawbridge &amp; Clothier, founded in 1868, is still
controlled by the Strawbridge and Clothier clans. Just about all
other big department stores across the country have long since been
sold off by their founding families.
   Strawbridge &amp; Clothier also has dealt with dissident relatives
who wanted out. In 1984 a group of Strawbridges decided to sell
their 17 percent stake. The company, facing a takeover, bought the
shares to retain family control.
   Even in some of the biggest corporations, founding family
descendants are active. Nearly 190 years after DuPont Co. was
created, members of the DuPont family still have ties to the
chemical company. Several are board members.
   In 1988, two great-grandsons of Ford Motor Co. founder Henry
Ford became the first of their generation elected to the board of
the automaker, still 40 percent owned by the Ford family. Both men
are also Ford executives.
   Some families have reasserted total control over their
businesses. Southland Corp.'s founding Thompson family, for
example, took the company private in a 1987 takeover, borrowing
money to repurchase the stock.
   Other families who preside over publicly held corporations want
to be sure they maintain control over their companies. So they've
issued different classes of stock with voting rights that puts most
power in family hands.
   Such an arrangement helped the Bryan family that owns Media
General Inc. defeat a takeover bid by investor Burt Sugarman in
1988. The family held about 71 percent of the company's Class B
shares, which controlled six of the nine seats on the Media General
board, allowing the family to easily defeat Sugarman's attempt to
win the other seats.
   But sometimes, when a company is losing money, a family must
choose the bottom line over emotional ties. In 1982 E.W. Scripps
Co. decided to sell United Press International, which had been
losing money for years.
   UPI was a project of company founder E.W. Scripps, who believed
in 1907 that American newspapers needed competing wire services.
Scripps Co. executives and members of the Scripps family decided 75
years later the subsidiary's losses were too much to carry any
longer.
   Ted Scripps, an E.W. Scripps grandson who shared his ancestor's
belief in competition among the wires, lobbied against a sale and
sought a way for Scripps Co. to keep UPI. But relatives told Ted
Scripps the family couldn't afford it.
   There are times when a company can become the pawn in a family
feud. That was the case in the Field family and in the notorious
1980s fight among members of Kentucky's Bingham family, owners of a
media empire.
   It began when Sallie Bingham challenged her brother as head of
the family business and then found herself off the board of
directors. After two years of bickering _ including a threat by Ms.
Bingham to sell her 15 percent stake _ her father, patriarch Barry
Bingham Sr., put an end to the fight and the family ties to the
business, selling its two newspapers, television station and
printing company.
   Bingham, who died in 1988, was forced to break his bonds with
newspapers his father bought in 1918.
   ``It is not easy for me to see The Courier-Journal and
Louisville Times pass from my family into other hands,'' he said in
announcing the sale in May 1986.
   But, he added, ``Change is an inevitable rule of life.''

THE ROCKEFELLERS An American Dynasty by Peter Collier and David Horowitz 
(Summit Books: $14.95) 
</P>
<P>
 Collier and Horowitz are a rare subspecies of celebrity biographers: They 
write about families (the Kennedys, the Fords). "The Rockefellers," first 
published in 1978, recounts the familiar history of John D. Rockefeller Sr. 
(about whom it was said that, although he didn't break any laws, he was the 
cause of many laws being enacted), Standard Oil and perhaps the greatest 
American fortune. 
</P>
<P>
John D. Sr. passed his mantle to his son, John Jr., who set out, by acts of 
philanthropy, to repair the family reputation in the national consciousness. 
Successive heirs would govern states and vie for presidential office. 
</P>
<P>
The authors, having gained access to letters and documents and even gained the 
cooperation of family renegades, have done an admirable job of piercing the 
mystique and the mythology that surrounds the family. They manage to make the 
Rockefellers both human and in many cases sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
And yet the book suffers from an accumulation of detail. The Rockefellers are 
less interesting as individuals than they are as embodiments of national myth.

FT  14 APR 93 / People: Fleming scoops up a Rockefeller
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Rockefellers may not be as rich as they once were, but the name still
has a cachet in financial circles. Hence the appointment of David
Rockefeller, head of the fourth generation of the family, as a non-executive
director of Fleming Overseas Investment Trust, is quite a coup for London
merchant bankers Robert Fleming.
Lord Mark Fitzalan Howard, the Fleming director in charge of the group's
investment trust operations, says that his bank has been associated with the
Rockefeller family for many years. The two parties used to have a joint
venture which invested in unquoted securities and Rockefeller Financial
Services, which looks after the family's extensive business and
philanthropic interests, has an office in Fleming's headquarters.
Despite his name, David Rockefeller, 51, is a relatively recent convert to
big business. After studying economics at Cambridge University and law at
Harvard, he worked as assistant manager of the Boston Symphony Orchestra for
five years before becoming executive vice-president of The Real Paper, a
liberal weekly based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. During his newspaper
sojourn he also moonlighted as a singer with The Boston Camerate.
However, after a short spell as an adjunct professor at Columbia
University's School of Arts in New York he joined the family firm as a
consultant in 1982. Ten years later, he was elected chairman of Rockefeller
Financial services succeeding his father, once chairman of Chase Manhattan
Bank.
The Rockefeller family fortune, estimated by Forbes magazine at Dollars
5.5bn, is shared out among the near 100 members of the family of John D
Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil and the world's first billionaire.

   Rockefeller Center Properties Inc. said it plans to buy an undisclosed amount of its $1.2 billion current-coupon and zero-coupon convertible debentures outstanding due 2000. 

   Rockefeller Center Properties, a real estate investment trust formed in 1985 after the sale of assets by various members of the Rockefeller family, said the purchases would consist of $335 million face amount of current-coupon debentures and $952 million principal amount of its zero-coupon debentures due Dec. 31, 2000. 

   The current-coupon bonds are convertible into the company's common stock at a rate of 4.59 shares for each $1,000 principal amount, or $11.82 a share. 
Interest on the securities is payable annually at 8% to Dec. 31, 1994, and at 13% thereafter. 
The zero-coupon bonds, which don't pay interest, are convertible into the company's common at a rate of 46.06 shares per $1,000 principal amount, or $21.71 a share. 

   Both debt issues are trading at discounts of about 10% from their effective initial offering prices two years ago. 
"We believe the capital market hasn't recognized the fair value" of the securities, said Richard Scarlata, a vice president at Cushman &amp; Wakefield Realty Advisors Inc., which advises and administrates the Rockefeller real estate investment trust. 
Mr. Scarlata didn't disclose the amount or timing of its debenture purchases. 

   In New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Rockefeller common stock closed at $18, up 12.5 cents.

<HEAD>Rockefeller Center Unveils National Landmark Plaque</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new plaque declares the national landmark
status of Rockefeller Center, a complex of office buildings in
midtown Manhattan where some 65,000 people work.
   The plaque referring to the 13 oldest buildings in the
19-building center was unveiled Monday by National Park Service
head William Penn Mott Jr., who called the center ``a masterpiece
of city planning, architecture, landscape architecture and cultural
progress.''
   The buildings cited were built between 1931 and 1940 under the
direction of John D. Rockefeller Jr. They include the 70-story RCA
Building and Radio City Music Hall.
   Those buildings plus two others have already been designated
city landmarks, meaning they cannot be torn down or altered without
approval from the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission. The
federal designation, announced in December, carries no restrictions.

   No one blinked when West Germans bought A&amp;P or
when Britons bought Burger King, not even when Swiss bought Mighty
Dog canned dog food. But Japanese buy Rockefeller Center and
suddenly you're hearing jokes about office workers having to take
their shoes off at the door.
   In reality, all was normal at the midtown Manhattan complex
Tuesday: The Rainbow Room did not replace its French wines with
sake; the American Festival Cafe did not introduce sushi; sumo
wrestlers did not shove aside the skaters on the ice rink; the
Rockettes were not kicked out of Radio City by Godzilla.
   But listen to Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who rose on
the floor of the Senate to warn: ``This year when they turn on the
lights to that Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center, we Americans
are going to have to come to grips with the reality that that great
national celebration is actually occurring on Japanese property.''
   Well, sort of. Mitsubishi Estate Co. is going to buy a
controlling interest in the company that owns Rockefeller Center
for $846 million, and it is the latest in a series of major
Japanese real estate purchases in this country.
   But the original 12-building portion of Rockefeller Center,
including Radio City, may not be controlled by Mitsubishi past the
year 2000, when public sareholders of a real estate investment
trust could take control.
   Meanwhile, the center will continue to be managed by the same
organization that has swept the sidewalks and polished the brass
for 50 years. The new owner will, at any rate, have to obey U.S.
laws, pay U.S. taxes, and generally observe U.S. customs if it
hopes to succeed in a competitive real estate rental market.
   Still, there seem to be jitters whenever Japanese citizens or
companies buy American these days.
   ``Many people have said to me, `Isn't there going to be a public
backlash about Japanese investment?''' Richard Voell, president of
the Rockefeller Group, said Tuesday.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch said he, too, had noticed an
``undercurrent'' of talk that the sale ``is a threat because the
new equity participants happen to be Japanese or not American
citizens.''
   And what did the mayor think about that?
   ``Ridiculous!'' bellowed Koch. ``It's called xenophobia, or,
`Gee, we're alone. Let's keep everybody out.' That's a worldwide
phenomenon and you would expect that it would exist in every
country, but that it would exist to a far lesser degree in ... an
international city like New York. ...
   ``I believe there is absolutely nothing wrong with foreigners''
investing in the city, the mayor added. ``Who cares? I mean, what
difference does it make?''
   Koyata Hosokawa, executive vice president of Mitsubishi Estate,
said American opposition to Japanese investment was ``an
unfortunate sentiment, but it's not a sentiment which (the
Japanese) are particularly troubled by.''
   The largest foreign investors in the United States are not the
Japanese, but the British, who last year invested twice as much as
the Japanese and held assets worth twice as much.
   Although Japanese investors have bought a few well-known
buildings, such as the Exxon building in Manhattan, their
acquisitions largely have been unremarkable. Fearing an
anti-Japanese backlash, the Tokyo government discouraged Japanese
companies from bidding on Chicago's Sears Tower, the world's
tallest building, when it was offered earlier this year.
   ``You know, it's funny, a British or a West German company can
buy something here and you don't hear much about it,'' said
Moriyuki Sawamoto, head of the New York office of a Japanese
economic research firm. ``But if it's a Japanese company, that's
right up in the headline.''
   To Sawamoto, the Rockefeller Center deal seemed like the most
logical thing in the world. Mitsubishi is a conservative, long-term
investor that's willing to pay top price for a world-famous complex
with a peerless location.
   ``No one forced the Rockefeller Group to sell,'' he said. ``They
went to Mitsubishi.''
   Sawamoto was a student at Vanderbilt University 32 years ago
when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. He remembers how Americans,
accustomed to a decade of global supremacy, were suddenly scared
and frightened by one little satellite.
   ``These days you are not Number 1 at everything, but you can
still be the Number 1 nation,'' he said. ``You shouldn't be too
excited or threatened by day-to-day events.''

   New York Real Estate Slump May Catch Up

   NEW YORK -- Like the fabulous collection of buildings they
represent, shares in Rockefeller Center Properties have been
solid. Amid a real estate bust in New York, shares in the
real estate investment trust -- sold to the public at 20
apiece in 1985, during the height of New York's property boom
-- have given ground only grudgingly. They closed yesterday
at 18 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange, and investors have
in part offset their losses with a steadily rising dividend
-- last year totaling $1.89 a share.
   But now, according to analysts, investors' luck may be
running out. Many real estate experts say it's only a matter
of time before the depressed New York market catches up with
Rockefeller Center. And the time they have in mind is 1994,
when leases covering about half of the art deco midtown
Manhattan office complex expire.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Back in 1985, these lease expirations were seen as an
opportunity to cash in on what seemed certain to be an
ever-inflating market. Now they're a ticking bomb, as rents
on many New York properties are being renegotiated severely
downward.
   RCP says the Center, even in the current slump, has been
re-leasing space at more than $40 a square foot -- well above
its current average rent of $33.98. Thus, it's possible that
revenue will rise -- not fall -- in 1994.
   But New York is mired in a continuing recession, with
midtown rents averaging about $31 a square foot a year today,
according to Lloyd Lynford, president of the real estate
research firm REIS Reports. He and some other analysts doubt
that Rockefeller Center will be able to fetch anything close
to $40 in 1994. One tenant, Chemical Banking, recently
announced a merger with Manufacturers Hanover for the express
purpose of cutting costs.
   Rockefeller Center Properties doesn't own the Center;
rather, it holds a $1.3 billion loan it made to the
property's owners. The buildings and land are owned, via
partnerships, by Rockefeller Group -- which once belonged to
Rockefeller family members and now is owned 80% by Mitsubishi
Estate Co. and 20% by the family.
   The Center, built in the Depression and famous for its
architecture and Christmas tree, is known to tourists as the
home of Radio City Music Hall and an outdoor skating rink.
But most of its 6.2 million square feet are offices, prized
for their prime location and for the efforts of managers to
keep the property as up to date technologically as possible.
In 60 years, none of that has changed.
   What has changed is that New York City, like other areas,
has plunged into one of the worst real estate slumps in
history. Midtown vacancies, 5% at the time of the offering,
have surged to 17% or so. And while vacancy at the Center is
far lower, it has climbed, ominously, to 4.1% from 1.7% in
1985.
   "When they put their projections out in 1985, everybody
was expecting office rents to reach $50, $60 or $70 per
square foot by 1994," says Kenneth Campbell, president of
Audit Investments. "That's not going to happen."
   Thus far, shares of the REIT have been propped up by the
dividend. Cornelius Sewell, of Argus Research, recommends
RCP, yielding about 10.4%, as "a good income stock." And
investors have tended not to pay too much attention to the
Big Apple's realty slump because, for the moment, the value
of the REIT is tied only indirectly to the value of
Rockefeller Center.
   Since its dividends are backed by the mortgage payments,
the REIT has been treated like a bond with a rising coupon.
But in the year 2000, stockholders in the REIT have the
option of converting their shares into a 71.5% ownership of
the property.
   "When you bought it six years ago it was a bond," says
Mike Kirby, a principal in Green Street Advisors, an
institutional research firm that recommends selling RCP. "As
time passes, it becomes more like a stock. People will
suddenly wake up one day and say what's the property worth?"
   Though the year 2000 isn't exactly around the corner,
leases that are resigned in 1994 are likely to influence the
property's value for years to come. A spokeswoman for the
REIT agrees, saying 1994 "is the critical year. That will
really drive the dividend."
   The REIT, which is managed by a unit of Rockefeller Group,
was underwritten by Goldman Sachs and was structured from the
start to rely on future growth. The REIT was scheduled to get
a big jump in interest from the property as soon as the
Center's revenue exceeded $312.5 million-forecast in the
prospectus for 1995. By that year, the prospectus forecast,
dividends would jump to anywhere from $3.10 to $5.02 a share.
   The chances of that coming true now seem remote. As of
now, neither earnings nor cash flow from operations is enough
to cover even the current dividend. And in 1995, the interest
rate on $240 million of the REIT's own debt is scheduled to
jump to 13% from 8%. Thus, in that year, some analysts expect
the dividend to be cut -- not raised. Moreover, given that
the REIT has about $850 million of its own debt, investors
may increasingly have to worry not only about yield -- but
about their principal.
   "You should never underestimate Mitsubishi Estate's and
the Rockefellers' desire and ability to bring value to the
property," says Wertheim Schroeder &amp; Co. managing director
Bradford Klatt. "They have a heavy incentive to make it
work." True, but in a sinking market not even Rockefellers
can hold up prices.
   As the original prospectus said, "Unless the Property
appreciates significantly by 2000, little or no value will
remain for holders of common stock." A spokeswoman says that
remains true, adding, "If you're in real estate you've got to
be optimistic."

   In one corner, there's Sen. John D.
Rockefeller IV, heir to one of America's biggest fortunes and
holding a $2.1 million PAC-packed war chest, seeking nomination to
a second six-year term.
   In the others stand an art professor who refuses to campaign and
a self-proclaimed inventor-lawyer who doesn't do interviews.
   Jay Rockefeller has spent $300,000 so far in the race to the May
8 Democratic primary. The art professor, Paul Nuchims, has spent
less than $500.
   A fourth candidate withdrew, saying he couldn't afford to
challenge Rockefeller.
   The winner faces Republican John Yoder, 39, a Harpers Ferry
lawyer and a onetime aide to former Chief Justice Warren Burger, in
November.
   Yoder has dubbed Rockefeller ``PAC man of the year.''
   But Rockefeller claims the money won't sway him.
   ``I think the one really clear thing about Jay Rockefeller that
the people of West Virginia understand extremely well is that the
only boss that Jay Rockefeller has, the only accountability he has,
is to the people,'' he said in a recent telephone interview.
   Rockefeller, 52, great-grandson of Standard Oil founder John D.
Rockefeller and nephew of Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller,
moved to Appalachia in 1964 to fight poverty, then moved into
politics. A former two-term West Virginia governor, he narrowly won
election to the Senate in 1984.
   Rockefeller cites among his accomplishments in office pushing
for drug education in schools and enactment of a law requiring U.S.
automakers to develop vehicles that run on methanol, which is made
partly from coal _ which is important to West Virginians.
   As a freshman senator, Rockefeller generally has voted as a
liberal, opposing the Strategic Defense Initiative and aid to the
Nicaraguan Contras but supporting the minimum wage increase and
60-day notice for plant closings.
   In West Virginia, he has been attacked for advocating Japanese
investment in the United States, which critics say jeopardizes
America's independence.
   To that, he answers: ``When foreign investment, from whatever
source, puts West Virginians to work, then I say it can be good for
West Virginia.''
   But the biggest complaints about Rockefeller since he entered
state politics have focused on his money. His campaigns have earned
him a name as a free-spending scion who buys his way into office.
   He spent $9 million in his 1980 gubernatorial run and $12
million in the 1984 Senate race.
   This time, he has raised $2.1 million, including $800,000 from
political action committees, according to campaign financial
statements.
   Nuchims, 55, of St. Albans, says his biggest donation to date
was $50. He said he's opposing Rockefeller just ``to get the ideas
out to the people.''
   A one-time gubernatorial candidate, Nuchims has refused to
campaign, choosing instead to exhibit his politically oriented
artwork.
   ``I do not wish power or glory, but somebody has to exude some
modicum of leadership for the state. West Virginia is, economically
and leadership-wise, bankrupt,'' he said.
   Chairman of the art department at West Virginia State College,
Nuchims says he supports a national education policy, competency
testing for teachers and restriction of foreign investment.
   The other candidate, Ken B. Thompson, of Morgantown, did not
return numerous telephone calls and has no listed campaign
headquarters. He did, however, tell one newspaper by mail that he
is a former U.S. State Department aide, a lawyer and an inventor.
   Rockefeller chaired the Bipartisan Commission on Comprehensive
Health Care, also called the Pepper Commission, which recommended a
jobs-based universal health insurance plan.
   It called for full coverage for everyone within five years and
said employers would have to provide insurance or contribute to a
public plan.
   But the commission refused to include recommendations on how to
pay the estimated $23 billion cost.

HOLLYWOOD'S HOT -- but really hot -- producer, Don Simpson, is making his 
acting debut in James Toback's coming controversial movie, "The Big Bang." This 
one received an ovation at the recent Telluride Film Festival and is all about 
real people baring their souls on the subjects of life, death, sex, and the 
universe. 
</P>
<P>
Simpson has grown rich and famous as a producer. He and partner Jerry 
Bruckheimer did "Flashdance," "Beverly Hills Cop," and "Top Gun." But Don 
recently lost about 40 pounds and became a health and fitness nut. 
</P>
<P>
So now he'll also play the role of the racing driver Aldo Benadetti in the 
coming Tom Cruise film, "Days of Thunder." Filming begins Nov. 17 in North 
Carolina, Florida and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
MALCOLM FORBES, Marella Agnelli and Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat laid on 
cocktails in the Forbes gallery in New York for their coming "Masquerade" gala 
happening Dec. 1 to honor AmFAR's Elizabeth Taylor. I had two dates for this 
one -- Hollywood's rising personal manager Keith Addis and his brand new 
partner, Nick Wechsler, who co-produced and produced "sex, lies and videotape," 
as well as "Drugstore Cowboy." These guys have formed a management-production 
company that will be an L.A. organization of note. (Addis manages Sting, Jeff 
Goldblum, Mimi Rogers, Steve Guttenberg and people like that.)

HERE's the real reason why David Rockefeller sold the famous Rockefeller Center 
to the sons-of-Mitsubishis. There are more than 100 accredited heirs to the 
sprawling Rockefeller fortune. Once upon a time, theirs was a name to conjure 
with all over the United States and they were the "masters of the universe" of 
their day. Today, the Rockefellers are considered "pikers" when it comes to 
wealth and are only middling rich by Nouvelle Society standards. 
</P>
<P>
Those in charge felt the tax situation would be onerous upon the deaths of 
Laurence and David Rockefeller. They felt that the other heirs need money NOW 
to protect their futures. 
</P>
<P>
Did the Rockefellers sell cheap? Some insiders think so. These smarties 
estimate that the real value of Rockefeller Center is around $4 billion. The 
Rockefellers sold to the Japanese for only $846 million. 
</P>
<P>
FINALLY CAUGHT up with Faye Dunaway on TNT-TV's "Cold Sassy Tree." Lo and 
behold, this is Faye's most subtle and moving performance in years. She has 
admirably subdued herself. (Those electric gestures and that high voltage 
personality have at times been an albatross around her talented neck. She was 
just too much for audiences to take -- or to take seriously.) 
</P>
<P>
In "Cold Sassy Tree," the star is in complete control. This is miles away from 
the pyrotechnics of "Mommie Dearest" and is a finer piece of work than her more 
recent, acclaimed, but largely unseen movie, "Barfly." 
</P>
<P>
If Faye Dunaway is lucky and gets more good scripts, she could begin to make 
those younger stars -- Streep, Turner, Pfeiffer, Foster -- just a little bit 
nervous.

   Senators exposed their personal finances to
public view today _ sort of _ disclosing such minutiae as $2,000
speech fees, a $60 refund for football tickets and the gift of a
``Lenox Octagonal Server.''
   There were the usual disclosures of millionaire status for many
members of what has been called the world's most exclusive club,
but Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia was not among
them. His assets were reported to be between $22,000 and $70,000.
   Every member of Congress is required to file an annual
disclosure form listing honoraria, gifts, assets, income and
liabilities. In most cases, members need only report the finances
in broad dollar ranges, such as $15,001 to $50,000. They are not
required to list their homes or furnishings.
   The wealthiest men in the Senate include, as usual, three with
the best-known names: John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va., an heir to a
vast oil furtune, Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and John Heinz,
R-Pa., of the ketchup family. Another is John C. Danforth, R-Mo., a
member of the family that formed the giant Ralston-Purina company.
   Among the others in the well-populated millionaire's club in
1987 were William Armstrong, R-Colo.; Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., Lowell
Weicker, R-Conn.
   At the opposite end of the scale, Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.,
listed as his only assets the cash value _ less than $5,000 _ of a
life insurance policy and $7,037 retirement equity earned as a
member of the Maryland House of Delegates.
   Although he was not required to do so, Sarbanes listed the value
of his Baltimore residence in the $100,000 to $250,000 range and
disclosed he owes less than $10,000 on the 20-year, 7.75 percent
mortgage he placed on it in 1970.
   Also among the least rich, Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii,
listed assets of $19,000 to $70,000 and liabilities of $10,000 to
$15,000. Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis., had assets of $21,000
to $45,000 and liabilities in the $20,000 to $30,000 range.
   One of the senators who usually is in the millionaire's group,
former astronaut John Glenn, D-Ohio, asked for an extension of time
for his filing for the second straight year.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., appeared eligible for membership
based on the reports, which are only guideposts to actual wealth.
Cranston listed assets of $901,507 to $1.229,496 but his
liabilities _ also listed in ranges _ were $65,002 to $150,000.
   Kennedy listed at least $596,747 income but not his assets. He
also listed no honoraria.
   Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., filing his first report, had assets
in the range of $1.9 million to $3.3 million and liabilities of $1
million to $1.8 million. He listed income of $681,488 to $694,488.
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., put down assets in the range of $1.2
million to $2 million and liabilities of $590,000 to $1.1 million.
Assets in the names of his dependent children totaled $1 million to
$1.3 million and more.
   Sen. Quentin N. Burdick, D-N.D., listed assets of $457,000 to
$1.2 million with no liabilities; Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C.,
listed asets in the $900,000 to $1.9 million range with liabilities
of $375,000 to $565,000. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., had assets of $1.2
million to $1.6 million and higher and liabilities of $165,000 to
$400,000.
   Senate Republican leader Robert Dole of Kansas did better than
his Democratic counterpart, Byrd. Dole reported assets of between
$275,290 and $579,277, mostly invested in mutual funds, Keogh plans
and rental property in his hometown of Russell, jointly owned with
his daughter.
   Dole, who had been a contender for the Republican presidential
nomination until he quit the race in April, reported income between
$310,310 and $329,995, including his $99,500 Senate salary.
   He was popular on the speaking circuit, even while running for
the presidential nomination, taking in $106,050 for nearly four
dozen speeches, three articles and a videotape. He kept $26,050 and
gave $80,000 to charity.
   Dole also received $50,000 royalties from a joint autobiography
with his wife, Elizabeth, and $30,000 for a daily radio talk show
with Sen. Edward Kennedy. Mrs. Dole, a former Secretary of
Transportation, had income between $221,538 and $301,025, received
more than $100,000 from a blind trust and $50,000 from the book.
   Byrd's outside income consisted mostly of honoraria for
speeches, most of them at the $2,000 limit, but also one to a
Baptist church for $200 and one to a high school for $100. He alwo
wrote an article for the Los Angeles Times that brought him $250.
   Byrd receives a salary of $99,500 a year. His income for
speeches and the article totaled $41,050. He gave $2,043 to
charity, putting him just under his personal limit of $39,800. The
rest of his income was from interest in checking, savings and IRA
accounts.
   He listed a single gift, the Lenox server. Sen. Thad Cochran,
R-Miss., also listed a single gift: a framed illustration of the
Battle of Corinth worth $175, from the Chamber of Commerce of
Corinth, Miss. Sen. Sanford put a $275 silver statue from the
Durham Chamber of Commerce on his form.
   Former presidential candidate Paul Simon of Illinois, a
Democrat, listed assets of $361,978 and liabilities of $219,243.
His income for the year was $121,850, of which $22,826 was in
honoraria.
   His filing included a $3,000 expense reimbursement from his
campaign, a $1,250 reimbursement from Northwest Airlines for lost
luggage, a $60 ticket refund from the Chicago Bears of the National
Football League and royalties of $478 from 11 books he has written.
   One of the Senate millionaires is Alan Dixon of Illinois, whose
income was $143,141 to $191,324. His assets include $487,000 in
real estate _ homes in Washington and Belleville, Ill., a lot at
Rose Hill Plantation in South Carolina and half-interests in a
Florida condominium and land at Lake Kinkaid in southern Illinois _
as well as stocks, bonds, notes, mortgages, three cars and savings
of nearly $317,000.
   Rockefeller, the senator with the oil-plated name, listed at
least $390,000 as income, assets of at least $882,008. But as an
heir to the Standard Oil fortune and one of the richest men in
Congress, Rockefeller is far wealthier than these numbers suggest.
Most of his wealth is held in three trusts. Two were established by
his grandfather, John D. Rockefeller Jr. The other is a blind trust
Rockefeller established when he became governor of West Virginia.
   Rockefeller's wife _ Sharon Percy Rockefeller, the daughter of
former Sen. Charles Percy, R-Ill. _ also is wealthy. Her income is
listed as at least $258,115, with assets of at least $617,010.
Their four children are beneficiaries of trusts worth at least
$1,045,010.

   Along with several hundred jobs, Exxon Corp. is
moving 107 years of history when it relocates its corporate
headquarters to Texas from midtown Manhattan.
   Since its creation in 1882 as Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey,
Exxon has grown from a domestic kerosene maker into the world's
largest multinational oil conglomerate, with 1988 sales of $87.5
billion and more than 180,000 employees worldwide.
   On Thursday, Exxon announced it was moving its corporate
headquarters and 300 jobs to Dallas, joining a number of other
major companies that have left the Northeast in recent years for
the Sunbelt.
   Standard Oil of New Jersey was one of 40 separate petroleum
companies organized in 1882 under the Standard Oil Trust formed by
John D. Rockefeller.
   The original Standard Oil Co. was formed by Rockefeller in 1870
and incorporated in Ohio. In 1911, the Standard Oil organization
was dissolved under U.S. antitrust laws and the various companies
under the trust became independent.
   Standard Oil of New Jersey opened its first headquarters in
lower Manhattan, across New York harbor from its main facilities
that at that time included a paraffin plant, a barrel factory and a
refinery capable of processing 2,000 barrels a day of crude oil
shipped from oil fields in western Pennsylvania.
   In 1919, the company bought 50 percent interest in Humble Oil
and Refining, which eventually became Exxon U.S.A. based in Houston.
   In 1972, Standard Oil of New Jersey changed its name to Exxon
Corp. Before changing its name, the company marketed gasoline and
other products under a variety of trademarks, including Standard,
Esso, Humble and Carter. Many of its overseas affiliates still use
the name Esso.
   Since its founding, Exxon has expanded to 100 countries
worldwide, exploring, producing, refining and marketing oil. Its
businesses also include coal, hydrocarbon energy, natural gas,
rubber, minerals mining and nuclear energy and high technology.
   Exxon now owns or has interests in 25,000 miles of underground
pipelines _ enough to circle the earth at the equator _ and
maintains one of the world's biggest fleets of oil-transporting
vessels.
   It has refineries in 25 countries. Its five U.S. refineries are
capable of processing about 1.5 million barrels a day of crude oil
into some 1,000 products, ranging from motor fuels to special
lubricants for use in outer space.
   Exxon's leadership history includes such corporate figures as
Rockefeller himself, who served as chairman from 1899 to 1911.
   The place of Lawrence G. Rawl, who has been chairman since
January 1987, in company annals has been marked by one of the most
tumultuous periods in Exxon's history.
   A March 24 oil spill by an Exxon tanker in Alaska's Prince
William Sound was the nation's worst such disaster ever, and has
subjected the company to harsh criticism by politicians,
environmentalists and consumer groups.
   Exxon's home base shared in the ignominy in May, when people
claiming to be Alaskans protested the spill by dumping oil into the
fountain outside the midtown Manhattan skyscraper that houses the
company's corporate headquarters.
   The company offices are in a landmark, 54-story skyscraper known
as the Exxon Building. Exxon and Rockefeller Group Inc. sold the
building in 1986 to a large Japanese insurance conglomerate, Mitsui
&amp; Co. for $610 million _ at the time the largest single real estate
transaction in Manhattan history.

   The dollar ended higher Tuesday against key
currencies in quiet trading, and some dealers said the $846 million
deal by Mitsubishi Estate Co. of Japan for control of New York's
landmark Rockefeller Center helped support the U.S. currency.
   Gold prices fell following a mixed performance overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $374.70 a troy ounce, down $3.10 from late
Monday. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid of
$373.30 an ounce, down $3.35.
   Currency dealers said internal market influences largely pushed
the dollar higher. But they said higher share prices on Wall Street
and the Rockefeller Center purchase also supported the dollar,
particularly against the Japanese yen.
   ``It's a large amount of money and obviously it has to be
converted,'' from yen to dollars, noted Robert Ryan, a senior
trader at Bank of New York.
   Mitsubishi agreed to pay $846 million to buy a 51 percent stake
in Rockefeller Group Inc., whose most famous asset is Rockefeller
Center.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 142.15 yen, down from Monday's 142.17
yen. It traded at 142.69 yen late in London, and at 142.87 yen in
New York, up from 141.87 yen late Monday.
   The dollar was stronger against the British pound. One pound
cost $1.5775 late Tuesday in London, cheaper than Monday's $1.5785.
Sterling fetched $1.5805 in New York, down from $1.5825 late Monday.
   However, the pound continued to rebound against other currencies
in Europe following its plunge Friday after Chancellor of the
Exchequer Nigel Lawson's abrupt resignation. Lawson's successor,
John Major, stressed Tuesday that he intended to follow current
policies, fight inflation and maintain a strong pound.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8420 West German marks, up from 1.8340; 1.6160
Swiss francs, up from 1.6050; 6.2510 French francs, up from 6.2265;
1.1740 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1735; and 1,352.50 Italian lire,
up from 1,346.00.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.8410 West German marks, up from 1.8360; 1.6142 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6065; 6.2445 French francs, up from 6.2325;
2.0730 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0727; 1.1742 Canadian dollars,
down from 1.1747; and 1,349.75 Italian lire, up from 1,348.00.
   Gold closed in London at $377.75 an ounce, up from $376.75
Monday. The late bid price in Zurich, Switzerland, was $375.00 an
ounce, down from $376.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $375.95 an ounce, down
from $378.85.
   Silver prices declined. On New York's Comex silver bullion for
current delivery closed at $5.180 a troy ounce, down from $5.243.
Silver fell in London to $5.21 an ounce from $5.22.

   Rockefeller Center was still a muddy
construction site when Christmas was first celebrated around its
now-famous tree.
   That was in 1931, in the midst of the Depression, when
construction workers happy to be employed got their Christmas Eve
paychecks around the tree they had set up in the dirt.
   Two years later, the formal tree lighting tradition at the
midtown Manhattan site began when the tree was decorated with 700
lights and placed in front of the then-8-month-old RCA Building. In
1936, the Rockefeller Plaza outdoor ice skating rink was opened.
   This year's tree lighting, with more than 18,000 multicolored
lights, takes place at 5:30 p.m. Dec. 5 and will be nationally
televised later that evening.
   The tree is a 75-foot Norway spruce from Raritan Township, N.J.
   Other Christmas attractions at Rockefeller Center are the
display of trumpeting angels in the adjacent Channel Gardens and
the ``TubaChristmas'' concert, set for Dec. 11.
   The Christmas show at Radio City Music Hall runs from Nov. 11
through Jan. 4.

DAVID ROCKEFELLER TO BUILD OFFICE PROJECT IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A partnership led by David Rockefeller said Thursday that it will build its 
first Southern California project here -- a $100-million complex across the 
street from Anaheim Stadium that will include two 13-story office buildings and 
a 150-room hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by a stone wall and several rings of trees, the 12-acre Central Park 
Towers project is intended to look like a scaled-down version of New York 
City's Central Park. It will be more lavishly landscaped than most of the 
office buildings in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of the usual tinted glass that most Orange County office buildings 
sport, the office towers by Rockefeller &amp; Associates Realty will probably 
have exteriors of precast concrete designed to look like marble. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockefeller partnership is a development and investment company based in 
San Francisco. Its predecessor developed that city's big Embarcadero Center 
office and hotel complex. David Rockefeller, one of the wealthy family's more 
prominent members, is the chairman and major owner. Most of the other investors 
are his New York business associates. 
</P>
<P>
The project comes at a time when the nation's top banking regulators have 
warned lenders to be wary of overbuilt real estate markets, Orange County among 
them. The office vacancy rate in Orange County exceeds 20%. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rockefeller partnership is betting that it can exploit a lull in 
construction around the stadium and open the complex when that office market 
gets tighter several years from now. 
</P>
<P>
The firm said it picked Anaheim -- a less prestigious business address than 
Irvine or Newport Beach -- because the office markets in those cities are not 
expected to improve as quickly as Anaheim's. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership has agreed to buy the Anaheim property from several owners for 
$12.7 million. The sale is expected to close this summer. Construction of the 
578,000-square-foot office development is scheduled to begin next spring and to 
finish during 1993. 
</P>
<P>
The project has yet to be approved by the city, but Rockefeller &amp; 
Associates officials said they do not anticipate any major problems when it 
goes before the City Council in September. 
</P>
<P>
Whether both office towers will be built at the same time depends on the number 
of tenants that can be signed up before construction, said Timothy B. Good, an 
Irvine developer and a partner in the project. 
</P>
<P>
Good said the partners are negotiating with four hotel companies to run the 
small hotel and that a deal is near. Original plans called for the hotel to 
have 350 rooms, Good said, but it was scaled down when he found that big hotel 
companies had saturated the Anaheim market and were not interested in running 
another big full-service hotel. This hotel is to be an all-suite facility 
designed for extended stays. 
</P>
<P>
Central Park Towers will also include a big restaurant and several smaller 
eateries and shops. The stadium area, once an industrial neighborhood, does not 
have many shops or restaurants, so office developers usually provide them. 
</P>
<P>
The partnership spent a year looking at Southern California before deciding on 
Orange County, said Bill Hatch, president and managing partner of Rockefeller 
&amp; Associates. It is still studying other investments, which it will not 
disclose, in the county. Rockefeller &amp; Associates also bought a business 
park in La Jolla in San Diego County this spring. 
</P>
<P>
(Rockefeller &amp; Associates is not part of the family's Rockefeller Group, 
which owns Rockefeller Center in New York City. That company made news last 
year when it sold 51% of itself and its landmark Manhattan building to 
Mitsubishi Estate Co. of Japan.) 
</P>
<P>
In Anaheim, at least three major developers have already obtained city 
permission to build office towers around the stadium, which is home to the 
California Angels baseball and the Rams football teams. 
</P>
<P>
But at least some of those buildings probably will not be constructed, Good 
said, because finding money to build has recently become much harder. 
</P>
<P>
"The amount of office space coming on the market won't be nearly as great as 
you might think," he said, "because players in the capital markets are getting 
hard to find as dinosaurs." 
</P>
<P>
Thrifts are out of the picture after the savings and loan debacle, the banks 
are leery of real estate, and big investors -- pension funds and insurance 
companies -- are also being more cautious. Some, in fact, are trying to sell 
buildings they already own in Orange County because the market is so soft. 
</P>
<P>
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., recently 
cited Orange County as one the places bank regulators believe is overbuilt. 
Local and state officials, however, said federal officials failed to consider 
the area's continuing population growth and its strong absorption rate (the 
rate at which new space is leased). 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there are still plenty of tenants, real estate brokers said. But 
developers have built so many buildings that they must offer low rents and 
other incentives to persuade tenants to sign a lease. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still a tenants' market right now, and landlords are giving up quite a 
lot in the way of concessions, but it's not as bad as it was a year and a half 
ago," said Mike Martin, a partner in the brokerage Lee &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
The Central Orange County market is already tightening up, brokers say, and 
office rents are getting higher. 
</P>
<P>
The competition for tenants is a big problem in the Newport Beach and Irvine 
neighborhoods around John Wayne Airport, where big developers have preferred to 
build. Add the traffic jams and the high cost of housing in those cities, Hatch 
said, and the Anaheim market begins to look more appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1986, older cities such as Anaheim and Santa Ana, with their run-down 
urban neighborhoods, were generally passed over as sites for office towers. 
Then, until 1988, developers built office towers in those areas. The developers 
stopped building, though, when most of the offices were not leased quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Among the developers were some of the biggest in the county -- Hutton 
Development, the Koll Co., Hillman Properties. Most of them have city 
permission to build even more towers near the stadium, although none has 
announced plans to do so yet. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Rockefeller perceives a window of opportunity here," said John Owen, a 
vice president at Cushman &amp; Wakefield in Orange County, a commercial real 
estate brokerage owned by the Rockefeller Group. "A lot of space came on the 
market in 1988, and there's a hesitancy for the next guy to jump in and build 
now." 
</P>
<P>
Backed with Rockefeller's financial muscle, loans to build the project will be 
easy to obtain, Good said. 
</P>
<P>
He and Dave Dawson, another developer, are limited partners in the project. 
David Rockefeller is putting up all the money from partnership and will own the 
vast majority of the project. Good, who conceived Central Park Towers in his 
former job with McKellar Development and Dawson, former chairman of the 
Stanford Ranch planned community near Sacramento, will receive an unspecified 
small percentage of the ownership for helping develop and market Central Park 
Towers. 
</P>
<P>
There is the risk that another wave of construction will dump another large 
amount of office space and high vacancy rate on the central county market 
several years from now. 
</P>
<P>
That's OK, Hatch said. "We build and own projects for the long term," he said. 
"And central Orange County is a lot more valuable than people give it credit 
for. We see it eventually developing into an extremely important, high-quality 
location."

   The city's best-known harbinger of Christmas,
the tree at Rockefeller Center, was set aglow Monday to the oohs
and ahs of thousands of spectators who were undeterred by cold and
rainy weather.
   The 20,000 multicolored lights adorning the 75-foot Norway
spruce that towers over the skating rink were turned on about 5:30
p.m.
   The half-hour ceremony accompanying the tree lighting featured
singer-actress Liza Minnelli as host, with appearances by skating
champions Judy Blumberg, Michael Siebert and Olympic gold medalist
Robin Cousins; Minnelli's sister, singer Lorna Luft; and a segment
from the Radio City Musical Hall Christmas Spectacular.
   Clara ``Mother'' Hale, founder of Hale House, a home for infants
born to drug-addicted mothers, delivered a Christmas message.
   The tree, selected from a private home in West Norwalk, Conn.,
arrived at Rockefeller Center on Nov. 16. For the past two weeks,
workers have been readying the tree, stringing more than 5 miles of
lights.
   The tree, the 58th to appear at the site, will remain until Jan.

   6. NORTH CAROLINA _ Republican James G. Martin, of Raleigh, was
born Dec. 11, 1935.
   Term: 4 years.
   First elected: 1984.
   Election history: In 1984, Martin, as a six-term congressman,
overpowered Democrat Rufus L. Edmisten, the state's attorney
general, gaining 54.3 percent of the vote and winning election as
North Carolina's second GOP governor in this century. Incumbent
Gov. James B. Hunt Jr., serving a second term, North Carolina's
legal limit, was required to retire from office. Before running for
governor, Martin had been elected to the U.S. House in 1972 and won
new terms in 1974, 1976, 1978, 1980 and 1982.
   
   
   7. NORTH DAKOTA _ Democrat George A. ``Bud'' Sinner, of
Bismarck, was born May 29, 1928.
   Term: 4 years.
   First elected: 1984.
   Election history: In 1984, Sinner, a state legislator and
farmer, who had lost a 1964 campaign for a U.S. House seat, emerged
the winner of a tough and often bitter fight for governor. Sinner
drew 55.3 percent of the vote, defeating Republican Gov. Allen I.
Olson. Sinner had failed in 1972 to receive his party's endorsement
to run for governor; instead, the Democrats picked Arthur A. Link,
a congressman, as their nominee, and Link was elected governor in a
close race against Republican Lt. Gov. Richard Larsen. Link won a
second term in 1976, but was beaten by Olson in 1980.
   
   
   8. RHODE ISLAND _ Republican Edward D. DiPrete, of Cranston, was
born July 8, 1934.
   Term: 2 years.
   First elected: 1984.
   Election history: In 1984, DiPrete, after many years in Cranston
government including service as mayor, was elected governor with 60
percent of the vote, giving the GOP a rare victory in Rhode Island
gubernatorial races in the period since World War II. DiPrete
whipped Democrat Anthony J. Solomon, the state's general treasurer,
for the office given up by Democratic Gov. J. Joseph Garrahy, who
retired. DiPrete, drawing 64.7 percent of the vote, picked up a
second term with his victory in 1986 over Democrat Bruce G.
Sundlun, a broadcast executive. Before becoming governor, DiPrete
was elected Cranston's mayor in 1978 and won re-election in 1982.
   
   
   9. UTAH _ Republican Norman H. Bangerter, of Salt Lake City, was
born Jan. 4, 1933.
   Term: 4 years.
   First elected: 1984.
   Election history: In 1984, Bangerter, following a decade in the
Utah Legislature including duty as House speaker, attracted 55.9
percent of the vote and won election as the state's first
Republican governor in 20 years. Popular Democratic Gov. Scott M.
Matheson retired instead of seeking a new term, and the party
picked Wayne Owens, a former congressman, as its gubernatorial
candidate. Bangerter, meantime, emerged with the GOP nomination by
beating Dan Marriott, a four-term congressman. In the showdown,
Bangerter whipped Owens by more than 76,000 votes out of nearly
630,000 cast.
   
   
   10. VERMONT _ Democrat Madeleine M. Kunin, of Montpelier, was
born Sept. 28, 1933.
   Term: 2 Years.
   First elected: 1984.
   Election history: In 1984, Kunin, a Swiss-born writer and
teacher who served in the Vermont Legislature and twice was elected
lieutenant governor, narrowly won the gubernatorial race. She
emerged with 50.026 percent of the vote, edging Republican John J.
Easton Jr., a two-term state attorney general, by just 3,674 votes
out of 233,753 cast for the field of five candidates on the ballot
and assorted write-ins. She had been elected lieutenant governor in
1978 and was re-elected in 1980, then lost the 1982 gubernatorial
race to Republican Gov. Richard A. Snelling, who retired instead of
running again in 1984. In her bid for re-election in 1986, Kunin
drew 46.992 percent of the vote, topping Republican Peter Smith,
Vermont's lieutenant governor, and independent Bernard Sanders,
Burlington's mayor. Because Vermont law requires a majority vote
for governor, the Legislature made the decision in January 1987,
giving her the victory with 139 votes to 39 for Smith and one for
Sanders.
   
   
   11. WASHINGTON _ Democrat Booth Gardner, of Olympia, was born
Aug. 21, 1936.
   Term: 4 years.
   First elected: 1984.
   Election history: In 1984, Gardner, a former state senator who
had been elected Pierce County executive in 1980, won the
governor's office with 53.3 percent of the vote, ousting Republican
Gov. John Spellman. Gardner, an heir to the Weyerhaeuser timber
fortune but a man who would rather drive a not-very-new car and buy
his suits right off the rack, won the Democratic gubernatorial
nomination by beating state Sen. James McDermott, who had been the
party's 1980 nominee. Gardner overpowered Spellman by 124,999 votes
out of 1,888,987 cast.
   
   
   12. WEST VIRGINIA _ Republican Arch A. Moore Jr., of Charleston,
was born April 16, 1923.
   Term: 4 years.
   First elected: 1968.
   Election history: In 1968, Moore, a congressman since 1957, was
elected governor with 50.9 percent of the vote, beating James M.
Sprouse, the state Democratic chairman, for the office given up by
Democrat Hulett C. Smith. Smith could not seek a new term that
year. Moore was re-elected in 1972, with 54.7 percent of the vote,
beating Democrat John D. ``Jay'' Rockefeller IV, West Virginia's
secretary of state at the time. Moore was in his second consecutive
term, the state's legal limit, and could not try again in 1976. In
1978, Moore ran for the U.S. Senate and lost to incumbent Democrat
Jennings Randolph. Moore lost the 1980 gubernatorial race to
then-incumbent Rockefeller. In 1984, the two-term limit forced
Rockefeller to give up the governor's office; instead, he ran for
the U.S. Senate and won. Moore again was elected governor in 1984,
drawing 53.3 percent of the vote in topping Democrat Clyde M. See
Jr., speaker of the West Virginia House. Before becoming governor,
Moore lost a 1954 race for a U.S. House seat, then came back to win
election to the House in 1956 and re-election in 1958, 1960, 1962,
1964 and 1966.

   Could an American do in Tokyo what Mitsubishi did
with a stroke of its pen in New York _ gain controlling interest in
the landmark Rockefeller Center?
   The answer is sure ... well, maybe ... but, if. ...
   For one thing, not much real estate is available in central
Tokyo to buy and what's available is far more expensive than
similar real estate in the United States.
   ``If the building were worth having, nobody would sell it,''
says James Doherty, a real estate analyst at Jardine Fleming
Securities.
   Vacancy rates in central Tokyo are below 0.5 percent and land
prices are as high as 35.3 million yen per square meter _ $22,940 a
square foot, or $992 million an acre.
   The Mitsubishi Estate Co. of Japan paid $846 million for a 51
percent share of the Rockefeller Group, which owns the 22-acre
Rockefeller Center in the prime midtown area of Manhattan.
   If Rockefeller Center were in central Tokyo, its 22 acres would
be worth about $21.7 billion at going Japanese real estate prices,
and 51 percent of that comes to about $11 billion.
   Mitsubishi paid the $846 million not for the land but for the
majority share in the Rockefeller Group.
   That's how the Japanese are accustomed to operating, said
Doherty, and it's how an American or another foreigner probably
would have to operate in Tokyo to make a deal like Mitsubishi did
in New York.
   ``It's easier to buy companies than to buy land,'' Doherty said.
   But Tokyo, which was razed by an earthquake in 1923 and by
Allied bombing in World War II, doesn't have prestigious landmarks
like Rockefeller Center.
   ``There just aren't many buildings with much status,'' says
Noriko Hama, a researcher at the Mitsubishi Research Institute.
   ``People might be shocked if a foreigner bought the Kasumigaseki
Building,'' Japan's first skyscraper, ``but it wouldn't be for sale
anyway,'' she said.
   Lawyers and analysts active in mergers and acquisitions in Japan
say it isn't government regulations, as many foreigners believe,
that prevent foreigners from buying Japanese real estate or
companies, but the realities of the marketplace _ plus the age-old
insularity of the Japanese, as well as those things foreign eyes
don't see and foreign ears don't hear.
   Among the realities of the marketplace are high stock prices and
a system of share-crossholdings that locks about 70 percent of all
stocks in the hands of stable shareholders who often are corporate
allies. In addition, not many shares are in circulation.
   So far, foreign corporate buyouts of listed companies in Japan
number exactly one _ the recent acquisition of Sansui Electric Co.
by the British conglomerate Polly Peck International PLC.
   The tendency in Japan's corporate world to do business only with
trusted allies has traditionally limited both domestic and foreign
participation in mergers and acquisitions.
   Such deals, says lawyer Kanji Ishizumi in his 1988 book
``Acquiring Japanese Companies,'' have customarily been arranged as
rescues by associated firms or banks of companies in trouble.
   Selling to an outsider, especially for speculative purposes,
Ishizumi says, is ``as much a betrayal as a captain of a ship
deserting his crew in a storm.''
   Ishizumi recommends that foreign buyers cultivate informal ties
with businessmen and even government officials before attempting
any takeover activity to avoid a backlash.
   Without that type of ``nemawashi,'' or groundwork, investors
face the same rejection that Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens has run
into in his battles to win a seat on the board of Koito
Manufacturing, even though he holds a 26 percent stake in the
company. Toyota Motor Co., with a 19 percent share, has three seats.
   ``It is necessary to build a trusting relationship first,'' said
Tamotsu Aoyama, a Koito director. ``In Japan, it is not possible to
just say, `I'm a major shareholder,' and get a seat on the board
right away.''
   But foreign investment is growing here, nevertheless. Mergers
and acquisitions experts predict a boom as foreign pressure against
exclusionary business practices makes it increasingly difficult for
Japanese corporations to shut out foreign competitors.
   In the fiscal year that ended March 31, foreign investments in
Japan were up 46.5 percent over the previous year to $3.24 billion,
according to the Finance Ministry.
   It says investment by U.S. firms took 54.7 percent of the total,
jumping 89.1 percent over the previous year to $1.77 billion. The
United States meanwhile attracted $21.7 billion in direct
investment from Japan, up 47.6 percent from fiscal 1987.
   Federal Express, Merck Pharmaceuticals, Motorola, Bayer and
General Electric Co. are among many foreign companies that have
made small inroads.
   Pickens' stake in Koito and Polly Peck's takeover of the ailing
Sansui Electric Co. indicate traditional barriers to foreigners are
crumbling, says Howard Chao, an attorney with the Tokyo office of
O'Melveny and Myers.
   ``Foreign acquisitions are heating up in Japan,'' Chao added.
``There are indications it will open up more and more.''
   Likely targets for foreign takeovers, analysts say, are
companies in straits similar to Sansui. Once one of Japan's top
three audio equipment makers, Sansui has not paid a dividend for
five years and faced the threat of no longer being listed on the
stock exchange if not rescued from its debt by March.
   Polly Peck's $108.8 million, 51 percent stake in Sansui gained
the British company entry into Japan's competitive electronics
market.
   In another deal, two regional supermarket chains, Chujitsuya Co.
and Inageya Co., turned to the U.S.-backed firm of Nomura
Wasserstein Perella Co. to underwrite a share issue and help fend
off a takeover bid by property giant Shuwa Corp., said Doherty.
   ``It wouldn't be difficult to imagine an asset-heavy company
worn down by takeover attempts being grateful for a foreign `white
knight' to come along ... although one would have to be seen very
clearly as a savior from a fate worse than death,'' he said. ``The
market is moving toward this.''
   Pickens bought many of his shares in Koito Manufacturing from
the Tokyo-based Azabu Group, a group of companies affiliated with
Azabu Motors Co. that is well-known for arbitrage activities.
   ``Acquisitions of Japanese companies are almost never tender
offers, they are usually furtive, creeping accumulations of stock
holdings by such groups,'' said Chao.

   Buying 51% of Rockefeller Group Inc. is right up Mitsubishi Estate Co.'s alley in one sense: The huge Japanese real estate company is entering a long-term relationship with a similarly conservative U.S. owner of tony urban property. 

   But in another sense, the $846 million purchase is uncharacteristically nervy, industry analysts say. 
The usually cautious giant will become the majority owner of the company that owns New York's beloved Rockefeller Center at a time when tensions over Japanese purchases of U.S. property are at an all-time high. 

   Officials of Rockefeller Group and Mitsubishi Estate prefer to focus on the affinities, nearly dismissing the threat of a backlash from the U.S. public. 
"We think there will be positive as well as negative reactions," says Raymond Pettit, senior vice president and chief financial officer of Rockefeller Group. 
"On balance, we think it will be positive." 

   But some Japanese government officials and businessmen worry that the prominent purchase is just the sort of deal that should be avoided for the time being. 
In particular, they criticize the timing, coming as it does on the heels of Sony Corp.'s controversial purchase of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. 

   "Officially, yes, we encourage the free flow of direct investment," says a Foreign Ministry official. 
"But they didn't have to choose this particular moment." 

   During the past year, government officials and leading business organizations have repeatedly urged Japanese companies to refrain from flashy real estate purchases in the U.S. 

   Since the mid-1980s, Japan's other major real estate purchases in the U.S. include Dai-Ichi Seimei America Corp.'s $670 million purchase of an office building at 153 East 53rd St. in Manhattan in 1987 and Mitsui Fudosan Inc.'s $610 million purchase of the Exxon Building, part of Rockefeller Center, in 1986. 
In Los Angeles, Arco Plaza was sold to Shuwa Corp. for $620 million in 1986, and Sumitomo Life Insurance Co. paid $300 million for Atlanta's IBM Tower last year. 

   Altogether, annual Japanese investment in U.S. commercial real estate grew from about $1.3 billion in 1985 to about $7.1 billion in 1988. 

   Many Japanese companies have taken the warnings by the country's leaders to heart and sought development partnerships rather than landmark properties. 
Critics say Mitsubishi Estate's decision to buy into Rockefeller reflects the degree to which companies are irritated by the pressure to act for the good of Japan. 
"Those who have no money and aren't buying think it's right to refrain, but those with money who want to buy for themselves pay no attention," says an official of the Japan-U.S. 
Business Council. 

   But to Mitsubishi Estate, the acquisition has just the elements that should win support from both sides. 
First of all, it is a friendly acquisition in which Rockefeller sought out Mitsubishi Estate and asked it to buy a majority share. 
Secondly, the two companies found a similarity in their business and development philosophies and intend to cooperate in a range of activities from real estate to telecommunications. 
Finally, Mitsubishi Estate has no plans to interfere with Rockefeller's management beyond taking a place on the board. 

   "We'll continue to work with them, in keeping with the reputation of the company, and we'll rely very much on their leadership," says Mitsubishi Estate President Jotaro Takagi. 

   Rockefeller may well have found its match in Mitsubishi Estate, a company of long history, strong government ties and sound resources. 
In asset terms, Mitsubishi Estate is the largest real estate firm in Japan. 
The core of its holdings is 190,000 square meters of incredibly expensive property in the Marunouchi district, the business and financial center of Tokyo, often jokingly called "Mitsubishi Village." 

   The Mitsubishi family company acquired that property from the government some 100 years ago when it was a portion of samurai residential land running from the moat of the Imperial Palace east toward the hodgepodge of tiny shops and twisted alleys that made up the merchants' district. 
At the time, Japan had just opened its doors to the world after about 250 years of isolation and needed a Western-style business center. 
Mitsubishi built the government's dream development, the story goes, in exchange for the official decision to locate Tokyo's central railway station there. 

   That was just an early step in a relationship with government that has earned the Mitsubishi group the dubious moniker of "seisho," literally government-business, a title that has the pejorative connotation of doing the government's bidding, but also suggests the clout inherent in maintaining such close ties. 

   Mitsubishi Estate is one of the dozens of companies in today's Mitsubishi group. 
It's known for its cautiousness in part because it has had little need for bold overseas ventures: In the year ended March 31, 57.4% of its total revenue came from office building management. 
Its earnings can rise 10% to 12% annually simply from the natural turnover of tenants and automatic rent increases, says Graeme McDonald, an industry analyst at James Capel Pacific Ltd. 
For the latest fiscal year, the company's net income jumped a robust 19% to 35.5 billion yen ($250.2 million). 

   For Mitsubishi Estate, the Rockefeller purchase will catapult it firmly into the overseas real estate business, the one area where it has lagged notably behind Japanese competitors such as Mitsui, which had purchased the Exxon Building. 

   "Japanese companies need to invest in overseas real estate for diversification," says Yoshio Shima, an industry analyst at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Corp. 

   Rockefeller isn't the first overseas purchase for Mitsubishi Estate -- it has already played a leading role in designing Los Angeles's Citicorp Plaza. 
But the Rockefeller investment is its largest. 
Nonetheless, it will barely make a dent in Mitsubishi Estate's finances, analysts say. 

   Mitsubishi Estate hasn't decided how it will raise the funds for the purchase, which are due in cash next April, but the Marunouchi holdings alone are estimated to have a market value of as much as 10 trillion yen to 11 trillion yen. 
Moreover, as a member of the Mitsubishi group, which is headed by one of Japan's largest banks, it is sure to win a favorable loan. 
Analysts say the company also could easily issue new convertible bonds or warrants. 

   Meanwhile, at home, Mitsubishi has control of some major projects. 
It is the largest private-sector landowner of the Minato-Mirai 21 project, a multibillion-yen development in the port city of Yokohama, about an hour outside Tokyo. 
The project is one of a select group of public projects opened to U.S. firms under a U.S.-Japan construction trade agreement reached last year. 
The centerpiece of that complex, the Landmark Tower, will be Japan's tallest building when it is completed in 1993. 

   Mitsubishi is also pushing ahead with a controversial plan to redevelop Marunouchi into a business center of high-tech buildings, a project budgeted for 30 years and six trillion yen.

<TEXT>     Can America's richest politician run for the White House as a Democratic
defender of poor kids, the uninsured sick and the hard-pressed middle class?; 
  It's a strong guess that Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV, D-W.Va. -- "Jay" to
you -- is going to try.;    He's a gangly, 6-6, earnest, naive man who served
(critics say "bought") two terms as West Virginia governor. By mid-September
he'll probably leap into the thin Democratic field challenging Bush in '92.
Then comes the riddle: Will Democrats tumble for a super-rich progressive
carrying the baggage of the Rockefeller name?;    Sure, we've had big-buck
presidents -- Jack Kennedy in 1960 for one. And the Senate is stuffed with
millionaires. But the Rockefeller fortune, thanks to the 19th-century founder
of Standard Oil, makes them look like paupers.;    Jay Rockefeller listed his
assets at $4.1 million on his Senate form. Forbes magazine's estimate is more
eye-boggling: $150 million.;    On early forays around the country, pushing
for his pet project, national health care, Sen. Rockefeller is trying to
defang the Richest Guy in Politics image with laughter.;    "Other kids grew
up playing with plastic blocks," he said Wednesday. "My blocks were 48th
Street, 49th Street, Fifth Avenue . . .";    And: "Others found success by
working hard. I just inherited it. And you know, I've never regretted it.";   
OK, he's no Jay Leno. In truth, Rockefeller did work hard as a VISTA volunteer
in the West Virginia hills. He was a decent governor, even if his first two
campaigns cost him $25 million from his own wallet. (Bumper stickers for rival
Arch Moore said, "Make Him Spend It All, Arch." Rockefeller rooters retorted,
"At Least It's His.");    When he faced AFL-CIO members here Wednesday,
Rockefeller sounded like a flat-out presidential candidate. He made the
fiercest attack on Bush of any Democrat this year. But when he tongue-lashed
Bush as the protector of the American upper class, well, it had a peculiar
ring for a Rockefeller.;    Like Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., earlier,
Rockefeller skewered Bush for using race as a political distraction. But
Rockefeller was tougher. You can't get more personal than calling a president
a liar.;    "Bush is lying to the American people and his own conscience, if
he has one, about quotas," Rockefeller said. "He loves to talk about quotas,
just as he was proud of that Willie Horton ad. That diverts attention, makes
people angry. It elected Jesse Helms. That's a helluva deal.";    Rockefeller
was warming up: "No wonder he plays politics of greed and fear. If George Bush
had to run on his record, he'd be run out of town. I watched Reagan-Bush
savage West Virginia for eight years. I'm sick of the charade -- talking about
quotas, ignoring our problems at home as we lose jobs overseas, because it
doesn't affect their kind.";    Their kind?;    Rockefeller ignored his family
millions as he raked Bush as a silver-spoon Yalie fat cat.;    "He doesn't
really care about day-to-day problems of American families," said Rockefeller.
"His whole life has been privilege and staying away from trenches and hard
work and small, tough communities.";    It was startling to hear a Rockefeller
rip into country-club Republicans, accusing Reagan-Bush of jacking up the
wealth of America's top 1 percent by 121 percent.;    "That's who they
(Republicans) protect," seethed Jay Rockefeller. "That's where they get their
campaign contributions. That's who they play golf with. That's who they go to
Palm Springs with, these people.";    These people?;    True, the Rockefellers
were America's most generous philanthropists. The clan has included some good
politicians, notably Jay's uncle Nelson. But savaging the Republican rich
sounds strange coming from a fourth-generation Rockefeller.;    Will
Rockefeller's paradox sell on the campaign trail? His boyish, do-good
sincerity has appeal. He's no phony, attested by his work with the bipartisan
National Children's Commission and his Senate health crusade for 37 million
uninsured Americans.;    But Rockefeller may be naively ahead of the political
curve. He's preaching populism when budgets are tight, voters are cynical of
big government. Joe Sixpack may shrug, "Let Rockefeller pay for his programs
-- I can't.";    He also seems to be fumbling his way onto the national
campaign scene, a rookie not quite ready to hit reporters' curve balls. But
Democrats may forgive Rockefeller's gaucheries. He showed Wednesday he can
generate white-hot anger at the incumbent president.;    His ultimate needle
to Bush: "He only went into the gulf war to dewimp himself.";    I hope Jay
Rockefeller runs, even if he has to pick up the tab. The '92 campaign needs
the novel entertainment of a Rockefeller raging against the pampered upper
crust.;    Maybe Jay Rockefeller and Bush would contend in a po' boy contest.

   The North Tarrytown Board of
Trustees has approved a zoning change that clears the way for
turning John D. Rockefeller's home into a museum.
   But it will be at least a year before the public can tour the
four-story Georgian mansion in the Pocantico Hills area, said Robert
Snyder, president of Greenrock Corp., which manages the Rockefeller
family's estates.
   The zoning change was approved Wednesday night. Mount Pleasant
changed its zoning in June. The property straddles the towns.
   The 86-acre property is part of the 250-acre Rockefeller park,
which was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976. The
mansion houses an art collection and has an outdoor sculpture garden
and a coach barn.
   Nelson Rockefeller left the property to the National Trust for
Historic Preservation when he died in 1979 and stipulated that a
plan be developed to open it to the public and preserve its history.

   NEW YORK -- David Rockefeller Jr. was elected chairman of
Rockefeller Financial Services Inc., succeeding his father at
the helm of the holding company for the Rockefeller family
business interests and philanthropies.
   The company said the election of Mr. Rockefeller, 50 years
old, who had been vice chairman, "represents a significant
step in positioning Rockefeller Financial Services so that it
can most effectively serve future generations of the
Rockefeller company." His father, former chairman of Chase
Manhattan Corp., had been chairman of the family company
since 1981. A spokesman for the company said the elder Mr.
Rockefeller, 76, will continue to work on his special
interests, including serving on an advisory committee for New
York Mayor David Dinkins and on some philanthropies.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Governor's Estate Not Liable For Attica Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attica Correctional Facility inmates have
no claim against Nelson Rockefeller's estate for deaths that
occurred during a violent prison uprising in 1971, a federal judge
has ruled.
   A former state corrections commissioner, former state police
officials and New York National Guard officials remain defendants
in the $2 billion lawsuit.
   Although Rockefeller, then governor, gave state police the
go-ahead to retake the prison from rebelling inmates on Sept. 13,
1971, he can't be held legally responsible for the 39 deaths that
resulted, U.S. District Judge John Elfvin said Friday.
   Rockefeller had ``no personal involvement in unlawful or
indiscriminate use of force,'' Elfvin found. ``There is no question
regarding his role and its legality.''
   Attorneys representing 1,281 Attica inmates filed the lawsuit 14
years ago. They can appeal the ruling to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
   Elfvin's ruling is seen as a major disappointment to the inmates
because none of the other defendants approach Rockefeller's wealth.
   The ruling is a victory for Rockefeller's heirs, who have been
prevented by the suit from inheriting an estate worth more than
$66.5 million. The former vice president and governor died of a
heart attack in 1979.
   Elizabeth Fink, lead attorney for the inmates, was out of her
Brooklyn office and unavailable for comment, her secretary said.
   Twenty-nine Attica prisoners and 10 people taken hostage by the
inmates were killed when authorities stormed the western New York
prison five days after an inmate revolt.
   Elfvin pointed out that he was only ruling on Rockefeller's
involvement in the retaking of the prison and not on the question
of whether improper force was used.
   After negotiations broke down, Rockefeller gave permission for
police to storm the prison but to use firearms only if their lives
or the lives of hostages were endangered. Other than that,
Rockefeller had no actual role in the planning of the assault,
Elfvin said.

   The Japanese government has urged caution by
companies considering purchases of U.S. corporations and
properties, but the suggestion appears to be having little
influence.
   Mitsubishi Estate's purchase of a majority stake in Rockefeller
Group Inc. _ owner of New York's famed Rockefeller Center _ on the
heels of Sony Corp.'s $3.4 billion buyout of Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. has heightened concern in the United States over
Japanese control of U.S. assets.
   Japanese companies and government officials are acutely aware of
the controversy and public relations officers are working overtime.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe expressed concern this
week about a possible American backlash and suggested that
businesses weighing U.S. investments could ``come up and ask our
opinion.''
   But analysts say government influence over such decisions is
waning.
   ``Clearly there is no grand national coordination. It would be
in the (Japanese) national interest if everyone cooled it for a
while, but who wants to be the first to hold back?'' says Japanese
business expert James Abegglen.
   As individual firms charge ahead, business associations are
working to reduce ``investment friction.''
   The Council for Better Corporate Citizenship, led by Sony
Chairman Akio Morita, disseminates information on how to
participate in community activities and avoid racism and sexism to
smooth relations in overseas subsidiaries.
   Industry analysts say some major real estate firms are avoiding
buying landmark U.S. buildings because of the attention they
attract. Companies in many industries are increasingly sensitive to
public relations. Japanese executives of American subsidiaries of
Mitsui Real Estate Development Co., one of the most aggressive
Japanese developers in the United States, are active in raising
money for the United Way.
   Tokyo analysts were surprised that a conservative company like
Mitsubishi would risk possible negative reaction to a high-profile
deal involving Rockefeller Center, especially so soon after the
Sony-Columbia deal.
   But some suggested the company may believe its conservative
image and prestigious name would reassure critics that it had
Rockefeller Center's best interests at heart.
   It was the Rockefeller Group that was eager to conclude the deal
and wanted Mitsubishi to take a majority stake, even though the
Japanese firm wanted to proceed at a slower pace, said Mitsubishi
spokesman James Rudy.
   The Rockefeller Group also approached Mitsui Real Estate, Nippon
Life Insurance Co. and several other firms about investing before
Mitsubishi concluded the deal, said spokesmen for the Japanese
firms. Although the companies declined to comment on their reasons
for not pursuing the deal, several major newspapers reported they
were concerned about possible backlash.
   The Japanese press gives heavy coverage to American reaction to
Japanese business activities.
   Immediately after the announcement of the Mitsubishi deal,
Japanese camera crews were on the streets of New York interviewing
Americans for their reaction. Japanese news organizations phoned
American correspondents in Tokyo to ask what ``nuance'' they were
giving their stories.
   When the Sony-Columbia deal was featured on the cover of
Newsweek, it was picked up by local media and prompted criticism of
American ``overreaction.''
   ``We cannot help feeling that some (American reactions) are
overly emotional,'' commented the national newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Outspoken lawmaker Shintaro Ishihara blames American ``racism'' in
part.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Watanabe noted after the Mitsubishi
deal that similar purchases by British and Dutch investors did not
raise the same unease among Americans.
   But at the same time they criticize American reactions, many
Japanese businessmen and government officials are acutely aware of
and even sympathetic to American sentiments about Japanese
investment.
   ``It is important that Japanese corporations act in
consideration of these feelings,'' the Asahi Shimbun said after the
Sony-Columbia deal.
   The paper said one reason for American resentment is that
``while Japanese firms can take over U.S. firms easily, the reverse
is not true.'' It suggested the situation should be changed.
   Some Japanese are surprised there is not stronger reaction
against foreign buyouts. The reaction to Mitsubishi's purchase
among New Yorkers appeared to be largely positive. Mayor Edward
Koch welcomed the deal.
   Japanese national television broadcast comments from New Yorkers
on the street saying, ``It's a good thing _ we need the
investment,'' ``It's a free country,'' and ``It's your money _ you
can do what you want with it.''
   On hearing these comments, one Japanese newscaster shook his
head in disbelief.
   ``Would we say the same thing if a Korean or a Hong Kong
conglomerate came and bought up a piece of Marunouchi (the prime
business district in Tokyo owned by Mitsubishi)?'' he asked.

<HL> Exxon, Rockefeller
Group to Sell Site
For $610 Million

   Exxon Corp. and Rockefeller Group Inc. said they agreed to sell their jointly owned midtown Manhattan office tower to Mitsui Fudosan (New York) Inc. for $610 million. 

   Exxon said the sale of its interest will result in a nonrecurring gain of about $246 million, or 34 cents a share, in the fourth quarter. 
The sale to Mitsui Fudosan, a subsidiary of Tokyo-based Mitsui Real Estate Development Co., is expected to be completed by the end of the month. 

   The 53-story structure, known as the Exxon Building, was put up for sale in early November. 
Closely held Rockefeller Group is the Rockefeller family's investment arm. 

   The pact with Mitsui Fudosan, signed late Tuesday, was for considerably less than Exxon and Rockefeller Group hoped they would get for the property. 
Real estate industry sources said the two companies had expected to fetch more than $700 million for the building. 

   Bids were substantially lower because the building contains a lot of asbestos, the removal of which is expensive. 
The owners also were anxious to sell the property before year's end because the new tax law, effective Jan. 1, will impose a higher capital-gains rate. 

   Exxon will receive half the selling price. 
The oil company also will receive an amount that wasn't disclosed for giving up part of its current lease, which is below market value, on 76% of the building. 
Rockefeller Group will continue to manage the building for the next 10 years. 

   Other top bidders for the property included Shuwa Investment Co. and Fisher Brothers, a New York-based real estate concern. 
Shuwa, which recently bought the headquarters of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.'s American Broadcasting Cos. unit, had bid about $550 million and was widely expected to up the ante. 

   But industry sources said the family-owned Japanese concern, which has spent billions on U.S. real estate, dropped out of the competition last week. 

   Mitsui-Fudosan is paying about $270 a square foot for the building. 
Real estate appraisers estimate it will cost an additional $20 a square foot, or about $40 million, to clean out the asbestos. 

   That price is still well below the more than $500 a square foot that owners of other prime Manhattan properties have fetched recently from Japanese buyers. 
One Japanese concern recently purchased the Tiffany building in New York for $945 a square foot. 

   Many U.S. real estate investors have complained in recent months that the strength of the yen against the dollar has given Japanese buyers a major advantage in purchasing U.S. properties. 

   Some found the Exxon Building transaction sobering. 
"At about $300 a square foot, it's a bid U.S. buyers could compete with," said one real estate investor. 
"Now maybe prices the Japanese are paying will start to come down."

   Benjamin Spencer, grandson of the late
philanthropist John D. Rockefeller III, committed suicide in a motel
room, a medical investigator said.
   Spencer, 24, left notes for his family and friends, and several
empty drug bottles were found in the room Thursday, police said.
   The cause of death appeared to be an overdose of prescription
drugs, said Dr. Kris Sperry, of the Office of the Medical
Investigator, who performed an autopsy Friday. Sperry added,
however, that test results were not yet available.
   Spencer's body was found by a housekeeper at the Howard Johnson
Plaza, police said.
   A neighbor who asked not to be identified said Spencer had
appeared unhappy recently.
   ``I knew him enough to say that this doesn't come as a complete
surprise,'' the neighbor said. ``I know he wasn't sleeping; he was
up at three or four in the morning. And when he would come down to
visit, even to get him to smile _ the easiest social things _ was
hard.''
   Spencer's mother, Hope Aldrich, is the daughter of Rockefeller,
who died in 1978. She lives in Santa Fe and publishes a weekly
newspaper.
   Besides his mother, Spencer is survived his father, John Spencer
of Vermont; and two brothers, David and Theo.
   Rockefeller was the grandson and namesake of the founder of the
Standard Oil Co.
