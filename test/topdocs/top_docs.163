   DENVER -- This hardly looks like a place that needs a new
airport. The one major airfield here served seven million
fewer passengers in 1990 than in 1986. The second biggest
airline serving Denver, Continental, is teetering in Chapter
11, and a whole corridor of gates is literally roped off for
lack of use. And far from falling apart, the airport got a
$200 million face lift that was completed in 1987.
   Yet city officials in Denver are planning to mothball the
airport in two years, in favor of a brand new one. And it
won't be just any airport. At a cost of $2.4 billion, it will
be the most expensive in history and will sprawl over 53
square miles, twice the size of Manhattan.

   Across the U.S., the nation's airports are in the midst of
a building binge that flies in the face of a plateauing
demand for airline travel. The airline industry is reeling
from record losses in 1990 that forced four of the nation's
12 major carriers to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court
protection. After years of double-digit gains, air traffic
has been flat for three years, and analysts don't expect any
big upturn for years.
   Yet cities from Pittsburgh to San Jose, Calif., are adding
giant terminals and runways as if the roaring '80s were still
around. Confident that a big rise in airline traffic is in
the offing, they are raising millions to improve unused
facilities. And they are lavishing money on things such as
wood-paneled conference rooms, stainless-steel palm trees and
tax-abatements -- at the same time that urban highways and
bridges are crumbling.
   All told, airports -- owned by local and state governments
-- plan to pour as much as $50 billion into construction in
the next five years, double what they spent throughout the
1980s. Newark International Airport has started a $2 billion
expansion and renovation, though traffic has plunged 24% in
five years and its biggest carrier is the hobbled
Continental. Memphis plans a new $177 million runway, despite
a 23% decline in traffic since 1986. Atlanta breaks ground
this fall on the nation's largest international terminal and
is scoping out sites for a second airport. Never mind that
Concourse C, which holds one-fifth of the airport's gates,
has been empty for nine months, boarded up and patrolled by
security guards.
   "It does make you wonder," says Andrew Goetz of Denver
University's Center for Transportation Studies. "What's going
on here?"
   Travelers will get stuck paying for part of this --
although they may not realize it. For the first time, most
airports will soon charge every U.S. passenger a $2 to $12
tax for each round-trip, collecting upwards of $1 billion a
year solely to fund new construction. But the charges will be
listed only in cryptic codes on tickets. As airports raise
rental rates to cover bond payments, airlines also may pass
on the costs to travelers in other special surcharges.
   Thousands of bondholders also may be at risk. To finance
the expansion, airports have floated a staggering $30 billion
in bonds, which typically cover 75% of construction costs.
They are counting on a weak revenue source -- landing and
space-rental fees from often struggling airlines -- to pay
them off. If the airports are wrong, they may default or turn
to a city or county to step in, and local taxes could go up
to cover the obligations.
   "What's going to happen when a weak carrier goes broke and
can't pay the fees?" asks Theodore Harris, an aviation
consultant in Virginia. "It's a prescription for disaster."
   Already, the building craze is beginning to exact its
toll. Memphis's airport has had to cut staff 12% in part
because of soaring debt payments. In the last 10 months, the
Standard &amp; Poor's rating service has put the bond issues of
five airports on its Credit Watch list (though it has since
taken two off the list). And the expansion boom has proven a
bust in cities abandoned by some of their major carriers.
Clearwater, Fla., for example, has a new terminal, a new
baggage claim area -- and no flights at all on some days
earlier this year.
   "You could shoot a cannonball through some of these places
and not hit anyone," says Robert Young, an attorney fighting
Denver's project. "We're building the ghost towns of
tomorrow."
   To be sure, some of the construction clearly is required
for modest upgradings of aging or overcrowded airports. But
most of the building binge is fueled by unbridled boosterism
and easy money. The funds are happily raised by underwriting
firms that profit on new bond issues. Many bond issues get
glowing marks from bond-rating firms that sometimes don't
update their public reviews of the increasingly bleak market
for air travel. Cities, meanwhile, often see airports as a
way to promote tourism, attract jobs and put their names on
the map, all at the same time. They view multimillion-dollar
expansions and renovations as the way to attract the
airlines.
   When Larry Hedrick, the airport director in Columbus,
Ohio, asked the city to approve construction of five new
gates a few years ago, he got a surprising mandate: "They
said to build 10. They had a real positive attitude about the
future here." So far, six of those gates have been completed:
One isn't used, the other five operate at only about half of
capacity, and Columbus has assumed $15.5 million more of bond
debt. But city officials say it's a good investment: They
believe traffic will eventually pick up, and when it does,
the gates will be ready.
   Underlying the building boom is the questionable notion
that the current slump is just a temporary, cyclical blip. By
the time construction is completed, airports say there will
be plenty of new customers -- airlines -- for the expanded
operations, and that they will be healthy enough to pay for
all the new services.
   Travel experts say that sanguine scenario is outdated. Air
travel zoomed in the 1980s because discount carriers kept
cropping up, and cheap fares were prevalent. Now monopoly
routes and high prices are commonplace, and the chances of
another PeopleExpress and $9 fares are remote. Only a few
mega-carriers dominate the skies. They aren't strong enough
to set up major hub operations at more than a few sites. And
they are particularly unlikely to set up at airports which a
rival carrier already dominates.
   Yet airport officials continue to offer bullish
predictions of a surge in air travel to justify their
expansion designs -- and to sell bonds to pay for it all.
   In raising funds for a new $300 million terminal,
Atlanta's major airport, Hartsfield, forecasts a hefty 30%
increase in passengers by the end of the decade. It predicts
two major airlines will use it as a hub. Yet traffic is off
20% this year alone. The airport did have two hub tenants:
Eastern and Delta. But it lost Eastern when the airline went
out of business. That left Delta to amass 80% of the city's
traffic. "No one can go in there with Delta so strong," says
Alfred Checchi, co-chairman of Northwest Airlines, which
rejected the idea of moving a hub there.
   But once a forecast flops, airports are reluctant to
adjust their predictions downward. When Pittsburgh's airport
authority issued bonds in 1988 for a new terminal -- which
will cost more than half a billion dollars -- investors were
told to expect steady growth in passengers in each of the
next 10 years. By 1990, though, traffic had fallen 5%. Yet
when Pittsburgh put out a second bond offering last year to
raise still more money for the terminal, it didn't adjust its
forecasts. And this year? The passenger count is down once
again, dropping 6%.
   "Forecasting is more an art than science," explains Alan
Stewart, an assistant director at the airport authority.
   At $690 million for 76 gates, the Pittsburgh terminal is
running double the cost per gate of some airport projects.
Amenities include arches that "bring to mind the great
Edwardian rail stations," according to a brochure; $2 million
worth of sculptures, murals and "meditative gardens"; and a
planned 60-foot-high ceiling in a main terminal room the size
of two football fields.
   "It's really great to have a vaulted ceiling -- until you
start paying the higher air-conditioning bills," says James
Murphy, an aviation consultant in Alexandria, Va. "It's easy
to get carried away."
   Piling on too many plush features can work against luring
airlines. Though they initially may be drawn by the fringe
benefits, airlines don't like paying the accompanying higher
rents. With its neon-streaked elevators and steel palm trees,
the Las Vegas McCarren Airport has to charge airlines $89 a
square foot for baggage-claim space -- one of the highest
rates of any airport in the U.S. Several carriers even sued
the airport briefly over the charges. In the end, passengers
paid for much of the airport's revamping: Several carriers
imposed a $7.50 departure charge at Las Vegas for several
years.
   Airports insist they must take on risky expansions to hold
on to the airlines they've got. Yet they are left at the
mercy of a troubled airline when it belly-flops or reneges on
the promise to set up a hub. "It's the price of
deregulation," says John Duba, an administrator at Kansas
City's Aviation Department. Before deregulation in 1979, the
federal government dictated airline routes. Now it is more
difficult to predict an airport's needs.
   Kansas City knows the hazards well -- it got burned four
times. Its airport was built in the 1970s to serve as a hub
for TWA, which later pulled out and located at St. Louis.
Then the airport opened its doors three times to airlines
promising to build hubs. Braniff International Corp. set up a
hub first, then went out of business. In came Eastern, which
later dropped out and sold its space to the reorganized
Braniff Inc. Then Braniff Inc. went belly-up in 1989.
   That left the airport $4 million in the hole for
renovations and unpaid bills owed by Braniff. These days
about 180,000 square feet of space, or almost one-third of
the airport, is vacant. Still, Kansas City International
Airport is building a $45 million additional runway. "O ye of
little faith," the airport's Mr. Duba responds to those who
doubt the wisdom of expanding. "If you don't build, then you
won't be able to attract the airlines."
   Some of the expansions are being forced by airlines that
hoard unused gates. Lambert-St. Louis Airport plans to add
eight more gates for $45 million next year, even though its
hub carrier, TWA, doesn't use many of its gates at full
capacity. TWA holds 25-year leases on 52 of the airport's 78
gates and refuses to give any of them up. Competitors at the
airport, meanwhile, are out of space and demanding more room.
   "We asked TWA about its gates," says Donald Aubuchon,
assistant airport director. "They said, `no.'"
   None of the risks seem to be making airport officials
hesitate. And nowhere are they more eager to expand and to
spend than in Denver.
   To win United Airlines's support for the $2.4 billion
project -- the first totally new airfield in the U.S. since
1974 -- the airport authority promised to assume more than
$40 million of United bond debt, finance the construction of
the airline's private club for VIPs, and spend half a billion
dollars on improvements that will benefit United, as well as
Continental. But Denver may have lost sight of such obvious
problems as location: The new site is an $80 round-trip cab
ride from downtown.
   When the airport was proposed, Denver officials told the
public a new airport was needed because of strong growth in
air traffic. But that thinking turned out to be wrong.
Federal experts had first projected that 54 million
passengers a year would fly in and out of Denver by 1995.
They later reduced the forecast by a third -- but only a full
year after Denver had issued bonds and started construction.
Now local officials are pressing a different justification
for the new airport: to cut airport travel delays. The
current airfield, Denver Stapleton Airport, was notorious in
the 1980s for flight delays because of bad weather and
cramped conditions. But, with traffic down, delays fell more
than 10% between 1988 and 1990. This year, delays ticked up
slightly; still, seven other major airports have delay rates
that are far worse -- and aren't building entirely new
airfields.
   Undaunted, local promoters have mounted a major campaign
to win support for their behemoth project. At the huge
construction site, against a backdrop of newly laid concrete
and freshly churned earth, the city has set up an observation
stand -- binoculars included -- for visitors to take in the
vast panorama of giant cranes and bulldozers toiling away.
   And at the existing airport 18 miles to the west,
electronic billboards rattle off an endless stream of glowing
statistics: "66 million cubic yards of earth moved . . .
2,000 people working at the site . . . Under budget and ahead
of schedule. . . ."

   Officials at two airports assessed millions of
dollars in damage Wednesday after a storm packing winds of 99 miles
per hour scattered private aircraft like toys.
   Sixty-four planes were damaged _ 42 at McCarran International
Airport here and 22 at Sky Harbor Airport in nearby Henderson _
when hurricane-force wind ripped through the Las Vegas Valley on
Tuesday evening. Ten aircraft were heavily damaged or destroyed at
McCarran; 13 were destroyed at Sky Harbor.
   No injuries were reported.
   No commercial aircraft were damaged although some commercial
flights were barred from taking off or landing until the storm
passed, McCarran spokeswoman Vicki Donaldson said.
   Damage was ``well into the millions'' and could reach as high as
$14 million, Ms. Donaldson said. Damage also was estimated in the
millions at Sky Harbor.
   Two aircraft used by Scenic Airlines Inc. for Grand Canyon tours
were blown into each other. The roof of the Scenic terminal, on the
northern edge of the sprawling McCarran field, suffered heavy
damage.
   A hangar belonging to Circus Circus Enterprises was nearly
demolished, with one private jet left resting atop another.
   One airplane was blown some 200 feet at McCarran, airport
spokesman Sam Ingalls said. A number of aircraft were flipped, and
two corporate hangars were destroyed, he added.
   A large door on a hangar housing a $1 million Lockheed jet
belonging to entertainer Wayne Newton was blown away but the jet
was undamaged.
   ``We have no idea where the door went,'' one of Newton's pilots,
Mike Cotton, said Wednesday.
   Damage at the airports was the only significant loss reported.
There was some minor flooding and downed power lines, police
spokesman Matt Alberto said. About 35,000 homes and businesses were
without power for a period.
   Some residents were rattled by the fierce wind and rain.
   ``It was out of control. We could not see out of the windows of
our agency,'' said Karen Kerr, who was working at Golden Valley
Travel. ``The winds were blowing so hard. All of our phones and
electricity was out for about three hours.''
   National Weather Service instruments recorded winds up to 90
miles per hour before lightning knocked out service at about 6 p.m.
That is the highest windspeed recorded in the Las Vegas Valley,
said Charlie Schlott of the weather service's airport office.
   George Feick, supervisor of the Federal Aviation
Administration's control tower at McCarran, said FAA equipment
registered one gust at 99 mph.
   ``I've been here a few years and that's the highest windspeed
I've ever seen,'' Feick said. ``It was pretty nasty, the tower was
swaying quite a bit.''

   A thunderstorm gusting to 99 mph destroyed or
damaged at least 55 planes at two airports and wrecked two hangars,
causing more than $14 million in losses, authorities said today.
   The storm Tuesday evening also knocked out power to 40,000 homes
and businesses.
   About 10 planes were heavily damaged, several were overturned
and one was blown about 200 feet at McCarran International Airport,
spokesman Sam Ingalls said. Two corporate hangars were demolished,
he said.
   Damage was estimated at $14 million by Vicki Donaldson, an
airport spokeswoman, although Ingalls cautioned that was an initial
assessment.
   At Sky Harbor Airport in nearby Henderson, 13 private planes
were destroyed and others damaged, spokeswoman Teddy Macknic said.
Losses will run in the millions of dollars, she said.
   No injuries were reported from the storm, which hit about 5:30
p.m.
   ``It was out of control,'' said Karen Kerr, who was working at a
travel agency when the storm hit. ``The winds were blowing so hard.
All of our phones and electricity was out for about three hours.''
   The National Weather Service clocked winds up to 90 mph before
lightning knocked out electricity about 6 p.m. That was the highest
wind speed recorded in the Las Vegas Valley, said Charlie Schlott
of the weather service's airport office.
   George Feick, supervisor of the Federal Aviation
Administration's control tower at McCarran, said FAA equipment
registered one gust at 99 mph.
   By 10 p.m. power was restored to all but about 15,000 customers
near the airport and the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, said the
Las Vegas Valley power company.

   A brisk batch of cool air swept across the eastern half of the
nation today, breaking record low temperatures from New England to
Texas.
   In Las Vegas, fierce winds registering at 99 mph overturned
private airplanes at McCarran International Airport, and an
accompanying storm caused power outages and minor flooding late
Tuesday.
   The cool air was ushered in by a large high pressure system,
dropping early morning temperatures into the 50s and 60s across the
eastern half of the nation, and into the 40s over the northern and
central Appalachians.
   Record low temperatures were set in Chattanooga, Tenn., with a
reading of 57 degrees; in Hartford, Conn., with a reading of 50
degress; in Houston with 66 degrees; in Mobile, Ala., with 63
degrees; in San Angelo, Texas, with 60 degrees; and in Youngstown,
Ohio, with 44 degrees.
   Temperatures were warmer across the Gulf Coast and the western
third of the nation.
   Florida was hit by scattered showers this morning, with
thunderstorms over the coastal waters of the south Atlantic and
Gulf Coast states.
   Earlier Tuesday evening, a thunderstorm in northeast Florida,
near the Putnam and Volusia County line, produced 1-inch hail and
wind gusts over 60 miles an hour. Lightning set a house on fire in
Putnam County.
   The severe thunderstorm struck Las Vegas with wind gusts to 99
miles an hour Tuesday night, turning over 80 airplanes at the Sky
Harbor and McCarran airports. No injuries were reported.
   Today's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the Carolinas to Florida and the eastern half of the Gulf
Coast; showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon and evening
across the intermountain region and the northern and central
Rockies, and most numerous over the Great Basin area.
   Temperatures were forecast to be in the 70s from the Great Lakes
and the eastern half of the Ohio Valley across the Appalachians to
the northern and Middle Atlantic Coast; in the 60s or 70s along the
Pacific Coast; in the 90s over the Florida Peninsula and from the
southern half of Texas across the southern Plateau to the interior
valleys of California; above 100 degrees over the Desert Southwest;
and in the 80s across the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 43 degrees at Bradford,
Pa., to 94 degrees at Phoenix, Ariz.

<TEXT>     McCarran International Airport here serves as a second hub for the
Phoenix-based airline. America West provides 36 percent of the service at
McCarran and ranks as the airport's No. 1 carrier.;    Beauvais, speaking to
the Las Vegas Review-Journal editorial board, said Las Vegas service could be
reduced from 145 flights daily to 120 or 125. Service from Las Vegas to
Atlanta, which was scheduled to begin Aug. 30, is now in doubt, he said.;
Other cuts might include shorter flights between Las Vegas and various
California markets, he said.;    America West filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection June 28. It has not made its $1.5 million payment due July 1 for
leased space at McCarran. Airport spokesman John Hanks says the airline, which
has another $500,000 payment due on Monday for landing fees, has requested a
30-day extension.;    The reorganization includes negotiating fees with
airports it serves, Beauvais said. The airline does not expect a major change
in McCarran's fees for space rental and landing fees.;    "We don't anticipate
an extension being granted without some commitment from their side on the
future of all payments," Hanks said.;    The airline is also negotiating with
Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix on $2.2 million it owes in monthly fees.;
Beauvais said Las Vegas is a "dynamic" market for the airline and figures
prominently in America West's long-range expansion plans when it emerges from
Chapter 11.;    The fleet size and level of service for the airline will
depend on a plan being formulated in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix,
Beauvais said. The reorganization plan is expected to be completed within two
months.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out Portion of McCarran-Walter Act</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge ruled today that portions of a
1952 law allowing deportation of aliens for advocating world
communism are unconstitutional because they violate immigrants'
First Amendment rights.
   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson also threw out a
congressional exception to a subsequent law, which gave free speech
rights to all immigrants except members of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Congress, he said, already has passed sufficient laws dealing
with terrorism and his decision didn't diminish the government's
power to deport aliens for reasons unrelated to their speech.
   ``We do not minimize the government's concerns with foreign
policy or national security interests,'' Wilson said, reading his
decision in a crowded courtroom. ``Nor do we in this day and age
deny the real and lethal threat that terrorism poses for our
nation.''
   ``Our decision today, however, will not significantly deplete the
government's arsenal in combatting terrorism,'' he said.
   By invoking the McCarran-Walter provisions, he said, ``the
government is trying to stifle certain ideas from entering our
society from certain aliens.''
   ``Our society, however, was built on the premise that only
through the free flow of ideas can our nation grow and prosper,'' he
added.
   Wilson addressed both the 36-year-old McCarran-Walter Act and a
1987 statute, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. The latter
act gave aliens the same First Amendment rights as citizens when it
came to deportation proceedings, but made several exceptions such as
the denial of First Amendment rights to members of the PLO.
   The four provisions of the McCarran-Walter Act which he ruled
unconstitutional provide that aliens may be deported if they
advocate or are affiliated with a group that advocates the doctrines
of world communism, totalitarian dictatorship or the unlawful
destruction of property.
   The PLO exception that was struck down provided for deportation
of PLO members who advocated the same ideologies.
   The judge ruled in the case of eight immigrants who appealed
deportation proceedings begun under the McCarran-Walter Act after
they were arrested by federal agents and held without bail.

<HEAD>Judge Allows Suit Against Government Filed By Palestinians, Kenyan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven Palestinians and a Kenyan can sue the
U.S. government for allegedly targeting them for prosecution
because of their political beliefs, a federal judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson, in allowing trial to
proceed, criticized the government Wednesday for filing new charges
against two of the Palestinians under a law allowing the exclusion
and deportation of aliens deemed undesirable.
   The Justice Department has been trying for 2{ years to deport
the eight, accusing them of having ties to a terrorist group, the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   But none of the eight has been charged with criminal acts and
all have denied membership in the organization.
   The government first attempted to deport them under a section of
the McCarran-Walter Act that allowed deportation of people for
affiliations with groups advocating world communism,
totalitarianism or property destruction.
   In December, Wilson declared those provisions of the act
unconstitutional.
   The government then accused six of the defendants of visa
violations and two of violations under the section of the
McCarran-Walter Act dealing with undesirable aliens.
   The eight, along with several immigrant rights groups, responded
by suing the government.
   The judge said he was disturbed by the government's tactics.
   ``I don't see how this new section of McCarran-Walter is all
that different than the one we ruled on,'' Wilson told government
lawyers. ``Are we going to have to deal with each section of the
McCarran-Walter Act piece by piece?''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Thursday struck down
portions of a 1952 law allowing the government to deport aliens for
espousing anti-American beliefs, saying the provisions violate
immigrants' free-speech rights.
   U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson also threw out an exception
to a 1987 law that recognized free speech rights for all immigrants
in deportation proceedings but members of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Wilson said Congress already has passed a powerful array of laws
dealing with terrorism and his decision would not ``significantly
deplete the government's arsenal in combating terrorism.''
   The ruling came in a two-year-old case involving seven Jordanians
and a Kenyan who were arrested, held without bail and subjected to
deportation proceedings under the McCarran-Walter Act. A federal
immigration judge released them and the government eventually
dropped McCarran-Walter proceedings against all but two, although it
sought deportation of the others on technical grounds.
   A government attorney said Wilson's ruling would be appealed.
   Wilson on struck down sections of the 1952 McCarran-Walter Act
providing for deportation of an alien who advocates _ or is
affiliated with a group that espouses _ world communism,
dictatorship or unlawful destruction of property.
   ``The ideological provisions of the McCarran-Walter Act do not
withstand First Amendment analysis,'' he said.
   He said the McCarthy-era statute was ``overbroad'' and could
cause deportation for something as simple as wearing a political
button.
   He cited the landmark 1969 decision in Brandenburg vs. Ohio, in
which the U.S. Supreme Court held that the government can only
prohibit speech directed toward inciting imminent lawless action.
   The judge also ruled that the PLO exception to the 1987 Foreign
Relations Authorization Act violated guarantees of due process and
equal protection under the law.
   ``In this case, the government is trying to stifle certain ideas
from entering our society from certain aliens,'' the judge said.
``Our society, however, was built on the premise that only through
the free flow of ideas can our nation grow and prosper.''
   The Arab-American Anti-Discrimination committee had sued the
Justice Department on behalf of the immigrants, and the battle was
joined by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for
Constitutional Rights, based in New York.
   One of the original defendants, Khader Hamide, 34, called the
decision a victory for Arab and Palestinian immigrants.
   ``We feel as a community now we can speak our minds on the
Palestinian issue,'' Hamide said. ``We can speak our minds on the
uprising on the West Bank and in Gaza and express our opinions
freely without the fear of being put in jail.''
   David Cole of the Center for Constitutional Rights said the
judge's ruling on the PLO exception to the 1987 law means that
``Congress cannot make politically motivated distinctions in
providing First Amendment rights to aliens.''
   Paul Hoffman, of the ACLU, noting the government's decision to
appeal, said the case would most likely be decided by the U.S.
Supreme Court.
   ``When it is decided, I think it will be one of the handful of
major First Amendent cases that have ever come down in this
country's history,'' he said.

NEW U.S. CHARGES ARE FILED AGAINST TWO PALESTINIANS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Two-and-a-half years after they were arrested and jailed for alleged
subversion, the Justice Department has filed new charges against two Los
Angeles-area Palestinians, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney disclosed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"At the 11th hour, the government has filed new charges against our clients in
a last-ditch attempt to bolster its faltering case," said Paul Hoffman, legal
director of the ACLU's Los Angeles office.
</P>
<P>
Like the original case, the new charges in Immigration Court are being brought
under the McCarthy-era McCarran-Walter Act, and are designed to deport the
aliens, Khader Hamide, 35, of Los Angeles, and Michel Shehadeh, 33, of Long
Beach. No criminal charges were ever filed against them.
</P>
<P>
Hoffman said the government charged Hamide and Shehadeh with "membership in, or
affiliation with, an organization that advocates or teaches the duty or
necessity or propriety of the unlawful assaulting or killing of government
officials."
</P>
<P>
The organization referred to by the government is the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, an affiliate of the Palestine Liberation Organization.
The PFLP has a history of terrorist activities overseas and in Canada.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Judge Steps In
</P>
<P>
Last December, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson overturned the
McCarran-Walter Act's political provisions under which Hamide and Shehadeh were
charged, declaring them unconstitutional. The government has appealed to the
U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
As a result, their immigration cases were placed on hold by U.S. Immigration
Judge Ingrid K. Hrycenko until the federal appeal is decided. Hrycenko's
decision to delay the deportation hearings also was appealed by Washington.
</P>
<P>
Wilson, however, did not have before him the new charges, which were
transmitted to the immigrants' lawyers last Friday night by federal attorney
James A. Hunolt, a member of the Justice Department's Washington team
prosecuting Hamide and Shehadeh.
</P>
<P>
Hoffman contends, however, that the new charges are no different than the old
ones, and simply came from a paragraph in the McCarran-Walter Act preceding the
sections that Wilson declared unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An End Run'
</P>
<P>
Another lawyer for the aliens, Marc Van Der Hout of San Francisco, said this
maneuver amounts to a ploy by the government to circumvent the decision by
Wilson, who declared that aliens have the same free speech rights as American
citizens.
</P>
<P>
"This essentially is a desperate attempt on the government's part to do an end
run around the clear ruling of the district court," Van Der Hout said.
</P>
<P>
Government prosecutors could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
Hamide and Shehadeh -- along with five other Palestinians and a Kenyan -- were
arrested in January, 1987, and jailed for about two weeks on subversion
allegations under the McCarran-Walter Act, a law that has been used to deport
or exclude aliens deemed undesirable. At that time, they were accused of
advocating world communism, totalitarian dictatorship and the unlawful
destruction of property.
</P>
<P>
All eight, who then faced deportation proceedings, denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Washington subsequently changed the subversion allegations against Hamide and
Shehadeh, alleging that they advocated "the unlawful damage, injury or
destruction of property" under another McCarran-Walter section. The new charges
are in addition to this, immigration attorney Van Der Hout said.
</P>
<P>
Three of the aliens facing visa violations have since received, in effect,
waivers to remain in the United States. But three others still face visa
violation action. Their cases are scheduled to continue today in Hrycenko's
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
Today's immigration proceeding almost certainly will serve as a forum for the
immigrants' lawyers to ask Justice Department attorneys why the new allegations
were filed, Van Der Hout said.

   Something strange has been going on in bookstores for a number of years.
Erle Stanley Gardner could have titled it "The Case of the Missing McCarry."

   I picked up some fresh evidence the other day at my local shop, no small emporium, where the latest in everything from Ludlum to literary biography can be had for a price.

   Under the sign "Mystery," multiple copies of 13 John Le Carre novels were stacked in the "L's."
A little further down the alphabet, there were shelfloads of McBain, MacDonald and MacInnes.
But not a trace of Charles McCarry.
His absence stuck out, as Raymond Chandler wrote in a different context, like "a tarantula on a slice of angel food."

   Mr. McCarry's first five novels are among the best espionage tales of our time.
Each has been published to glowing reviews, been devoured by enthusiastic fans and then become hard to find.
Hero Paul Christopher, a Central Intelligence Agency officer, went to Harvard, published some poetry, is handsome, athletic and not uninterested in beautiful women.
The plots unfold against the landscape of contemporary tragedies -- Vietnam, Berlin, Eastern Europe -- and they have attracted enough readers in England and France to put Mr. McCarry's name on best-seller lists, but there has been no megaseller here.

   Perhaps in exasperation, Mr. McCarry (once a CIA officer himself), has abandoned contemporary spydom.
"The Bride of the Wilderness" (New American Library, 438 pages, $18.95) is an old-fashioned historical adventure novel jammed with incident, thronged with characters, packed with carefully researched detail.
The wildly romantic story, awash in blood and driven by sexual obsession, brings the first Christophers, ancestors of the CIA's Paul Christopher, to the U.S. and settles them in the wilderness at the start of the 18th century.

   Mr. McCarry writes as well as ever. When Fanny, the beautiful teen-aged heroine, sails into Boston harbor, she hears church bells "very feeble, not like English bells." Then the bells stop:
   "America was as silent as the grave.
Fanny had never been in such a silent place, and she realized that she was only on the edge of it.
How far could the bells be heard when they were rung on Sundaya mile, two miles if the wind was right?
Beyond that point, Fanny thought, it must be just as silent as it had been before the English came.
We are at the edge of an enormous place, the largest, emptiest place on earth and there is nothing in it but silence.
It is to the ear what darkness is to the eye."

   In fitting romantic tradition, America becomes for Fanny an ordeal beyond a lesser woman's endurance, capped by the triumph of passionate love.
If that sounds corny, it is.
Mr. McCarry is writing true to the romantic genre he has chosen.
His story is so fast-paced that, as they say of London weather: If you don't like it, wait a minute.
It will change.

   For all the romantic adventure of the novel, Mr. McCarry breaks with one tradition -- he sprinkles no perfume on 1700 life in London or America.
London streets are deep in mud.
Disease flourishes.
Baths are scarce and odors widespread.

   Mr. McCarry has stored up lore and used it well.
At a London school a master concentrates his students' minds by making them hop while reciting Latin verse.
Football games are brutal affairs from which men may return maimed, or, as in the case of Fanny's father, not return at all.

   Cruelty abounds.
Blood flows into London's mud, across ship's decks, into New England snows.
Children often are the victims, their brains bashed out against trees, or their bodies left buried in the snow.
Mr. McCarry's prose makes the gore bright and the pain real.
I flinched a few times.

   Perhaps "The Bride of the Wilderness" will bring Mr. McCarry a wider audience, but I like Mr. McCarry better when he is writing about the adventures, betrayals and follies of our own age.
Historical romance is a narrow genre: plenty of room for fabulous characters and plot twists, but not much for subtext.

   What makes Mr. McCarry's earlier books excellent is his clear, cold eye for the ambitions and treacheries of modern governments, not to mention contemporary friends and lovers.
The secret world of espionage becomes paradigm for the wider life of the world.
What he writes about our world resonates as a story about life in 1700 cannot no matter how thorough his research.

   Mr. McCarry, who is an editor at National Geographic in Washington, in recent years had unusual opportunities to study Washington's highest levels.
He collaborated with former Secretary of State Alexander Haig on his memoir, "Caveat," and with Donald T. Regan, former Treasury secretary and White House chief of staff, on his best-selling "For the Record: From Wall Street to Washington."

   Once again, Mr. McCarry is missing where he might be expected to be found.
His name doesn't appear on the cover of either memoir, although he is credited on the acknowledgment pages.
I hope that some of what ghost-memoirist McCarry learned will inform future McCarry novels.

   House Panel Approves Bill to Repeal
   Some Antitrust Exemptions for Insurers
   ----
   By Paul M. Barrett
   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

<LP>
   WASHINGTON -- A House Judiciary subcommittee approved
legislation that would repeal crucial aspects of the
insurance industry's 45-year-old exemption from federal
antitrust law.
   The Democratic-supported bill, approved yesterday by a 9-6
party-line vote, would eliminate insurers' exemptions for
price-fixing, attempting to monopolize markets, allocating
territories among rival firms, and forcing consumers to
purchase packages of unrelated types of policies. These
practices are generally viewed by lawyers and economists as
among the most egregious antitrust violations.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Although it is only an early step in the legislative
process, the subcommittee action was significant. The
legislation would amend the McCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945,
which has provided the $500 billion insurance industry with
broad protection from federal antitrust enforcement. Only
once before, in 1988, has such a modification of
McCarran-Ferguson received subcommittee approval, and that
bill died without moving further.
   Under the current legislation, sponsored by Judiciary
Committee Chairman Jack Brooks of Texas, insurers would be
allowed to continue certain types of information-sharing on
claims and other economic trends that would be deemed illegal
in other industries. Moreover, insurers would remain
insulated from federal enforcement in states where state
officials actively regulate the industry.
   The bill would "prohibit only the most pernicious offenses
-- like price-fixing -- unless the states take real
responsibility for regulating the industry," Rep. Brooks
said. The prohibitions would take effect after a five-year
"transition period."
   The full House Judiciary Committee, which Mr. Brooks also
chairs, is expected to consider his bill this summer. If it
receives the committee's approval, as expected, a tough floor
fight could follow this fall. The Senate is moving more
slowly on a different bill designed to repeal aspects of
McCarran-Ferguson.
   Some lawmakers have tried for years to repeal the
McCarran-Ferguson exemptions, arguing that they limit
competition and drive up premium prices. But the insurance
industry, which claims the exemptions permit "stability" and
thus reduce rates, has skillfully orchestrated sufficient
opposition to block such efforts.
   While insurers generally continue to oppose modification
of McCarran-Ferguson, some major firms have lately conceded
that they would survive with less special protection.
   Wilson Taylor, chairman of Cigna Corp., for example, said
in a speech to an insurance trade group that it is time to
"shake off the status quo and take some bold steps toward
change and compromise" on McCarran-Ferguson, among other
issues.
   John P. Mascotte, chairman of Continental Corp., said,
"I'm not calling for repeal {of the antitrust exemptions},
but it is time to carefully re-examine McCarran-Ferguson and
see what the industry needs in the way of regulation and then
ask if McCarran is the most effective way of doing that."
   Before the House subcommittee approved the Brooks bill
yesterday, it voted 14-1 against a proposal by Rep. Tom
Campbell (R., Calif.) to repeal McCarran-Ferguson entirely.
Mr. Campbell, a former Stanford University law professor and
something of a maverick on antitrust issues, ultimately voted
against the Brooks bill.
   In recent years, the Federal Trade Commission, which
shares antitrust authority with the Justice Department, has
recommended total repeal of McCarran-Ferguson. James Rill,
the Justice Department's antitrust chief, is known to favor
repeal of at least some of the McCarran-Ferguson protections,
but the Bush administration hasn't taken a public position on
the politically charged issue.

   Bally Manufacturing Corp., which owns gaming
properties in Nevada and New Jersey, announced plans Tuesday to
build an estimated $10 million gaming equipment plant in Las Vegas.
   The plant will manufacture gaming machines and lottery terminals.
Completion of the 150,000-square-foot facility at the Huges Airport
Center near McCarran International Airport is scheduled by mid-1990.
   The plant initially will provide jobs for up to 300 people.
   ``It makes sense to be a gaming manufacturer in a gaming state,''
said Bally President Roger Keesee.
   Keesee said rail and air transportation were added factors in
selecting the Las Vegas site.
   Bally is a $2 billion company that designs, makes and markets
leisure and recreation products. Chicago-based Bally operates casino
hotels in Las Vegas and Reno, Nev., and has two properties in
Atlantic City, N.J.

U.S. SAYS IT TAPPED CALLS OF PALESTINIAN DEFENDANTS, LAWYERS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
A clandestine arm of the federal judiciary eavesdropped on telephone
conversations between Los Angeles-area Palestinians charged with subversion and
visa violations and their attorneys who are fighting to keep them from being
deported, the government has disclosed.
</P>
<P>
In revealing the surveillance, the Justice Department said, in effect, that no
constitutional rights were violated because "none of those conversations
involve privileged attorney-client communications."
</P>
<P>
The lead attorney for the Palestinians, Dan Stormer of Los Angeles, branded the
surveillance "unlawful." He said defense lawyers will make an effort in federal
court to force the government to produce information that laid the foundation
for the wire taps.
</P>
<P>
But the government said such exhibits must remain sealed because they "contain
extremely significant documents concerning sensitive intelligence sources and
methods used by U.S. intelligence agencies (and) would damage the national
security of this nation."
</P>
<P>
Stormer charged that the government misused its eavesdropping powers,
authorized under the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, when it tapped
the Palestinians' phones and picked up conversations with their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"Under common law, the Constitution's Sixth Amendment (which spells out the
rights of the accused in criminal prosecutions) and state and federal evidence
codes, the conversations between an attorney and a client are protected,"
Stormer said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, the Surveillance Act is aimed at individuals involved in
criminal activity and "acting on behalf of a foreign power. Our clients have
not engaged in any unlawful acts. They've only engaged in their First Amendment
right of freedom of speech."
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department memorandums, which also described the use of informants
and video taping of one of the defendants, were filed last week in U.S.
Immigration Court in Los Angeles in response to requests by defense lawyers.
</P>
<P>
A Justice Department spokeswoman said Saturday that the department will have no
further comment on the surveillance disclosures.
</P>
<P>
The volatile case, which pits the Justice Department against civil rights and
Arab-American groups, involves eight aliens who were accused under the
McCarran-Walter Act of belonging to a Marxist faction of the Palestine
Liberation Organization with a history of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
All eight -- seven Palestinians and a Kenyan -- have denied membership in the
faction, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). None were
charged with any criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers raised the surveillance issue in June, 1987, in an Immigration
Court filing alleging that they and their clients "have experienced unusual and
inexplicable noises and clicking sounds during their telephone conversations."
</P>
<P>
The government filings do not say whether the aliens are still under
surveillance or how many conversations were monitored.
</P>
<P>
The wiretaps were authorized under the Carter Administration law designed to
allow covert gathering of information for national security purposes. Wiretap
orders were issued by the U.S. Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which
operates in a closely guarded courtroom in the main Justice Department building
in Washington, which is closed to defendants.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Began in 1985
</P>
<P>
In the government papers, a U.S. immigration attorney, Michael P. Lindemann,
said the FBI carried out the surveillance as far back as July 31, 1985, when it
began recording the telephone numbers called by one of the defendants, Julie
Mungai, 30. She is the Kenyan-born wife of Khader Hamide, 34, of Los Angeles,
one of the case's two leading defendants.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, Lindemann said in a declaration, government lawyers "viewed a
brief portion of one video tape, without sound, taken in the course of one
surveillance."
</P>
<P>
Government memorandums said that monitoring also took place by "consensual
electronic surveillance," which involves the use of informants.
</P>
<P>
Lindemann said "that while attorneys of record in this case have been
overheard" talking to the Palestinians, whose phones were tapped, "only a
single conversation was in connection with this case, and that single
conversation did not involve attorney-client communication and was not
otherwise privileged." In any case, he said, the material would not be used in
the deportation proceedings.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Deportations Delayed
</P>
<P>
Although the eight aliens were arrested and briefly jailed in January, 1987,
legal maneuvering has delayed their deportation proceedings, now scheduled to
resume in May.
</P>
<P>
Charges against six of the eight have been reduced to miscellaneous visa
violations; and proceedings against two of these six were then halted when it
appeared that they would be granted amnesty.
</P>
<P>
But deportation hearings are scheduled to proceed against two of the
Palestinians whom the government alleged are local PFLP leaders -- Hamide and
Michel Shehadeh, 32, of Long Beach. Both have been charged under
McCarran-Walter with "unlawful damage, injury or destruction of property."
</P>
<P>
Complicating the government's case, however, is a major free-speech decision
last December in Los Angeles by U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson, who
ruled that the McCarran-Walter Act's political provisions were
unconstitutional. The government is expected to appeal.

   Airports, in a takeoff on the friendly skies, are trying
to profit by becoming more friendly on the ground.
   The main things that drive passengers batty -- lousy
airline service, surly ticket agents and bad weather -- are
beyond an airport's control. But airport officials are
realizing, more and more, that they can ease a traveler's
pain, or make it worse. "When you're delayed, are you forced
to spend $5 on a hot dog? Or do you have a pleasant
experience?" asks Robert Bunnell, a vice president at Airport

   It's not always obvious, but airports are beginning to
offer consumers ways to spend their time there pleasantly or
productively. Several have opened business centers where
executives can fax on the fly. In Pittsburgh and Boston,
kiddie travelers can romp on slides and merry-go-rounds. Many
airports are jazzing up their retail shops and clamping down
on notoriously high food prices. Some even tried electronic
golf driving ranges.
   "Airports have fallen behind in providing creature
comforts, and they're going to catch up in the next five
years," says Steven Reiss, the Alexandria, Va.-based

movies and exercise clubs will become common at airports, he
predicts.
   Moreover, with airline delays increasing what is known as
passenger "dwell time" in terminals, it is in the financial
self-interest of airports to serve up appealing distractions.
   In the past, many airports have fallen short with cramped
spaces, tacky souvenir stands and unappetizing food. "They
haven't always placed the needs of the traveler first,"
concedes Patrick Moscaritolo, director of Boston's Logan
International Airport. Tom Moriarity, a senior associate with
the Washington office of Halcyon Ltd., a real-estate
consultant with headquarters in Hartford, Conn., says,
"Airports are changing to keep pace with the public, which is
more knowledgeable and has higher expectations" than before.
   The drive to make airports more attractive is spurred by
the increasing recognition among local communities -- which
usually own the airports -- that airports are important
marketing tools in attracting new businesses, expanding
convention trade and increasing domestic and international
air service. The operators believe improved services will
help them compete with other airports for passengers while
also bringing in more money.
   Business travelers are prime targets. Since 1983, for
example, Tele-Trip Co., a unit of Mutual of Omaha Insurance
Cos., based in Omaha, Neb., has opened two dozen business
centers at 20 airports, including Hartsfield Atlanta
International Airport, Baltimore-Washington International
Airport, New York's La Guardia Airport and Los Angeles
International Airport. Most of the centers offer secretarial
and notary services, conference-room rentals and
overnight-mail service. Sending faxes -- which costs $6 for
the first page and $2.50 for each additional page -- is the
most popular service.
   Harried parents with traveling tots are getting more
attention, too. At the Greater Pittsburgh International
Airport and Boston's Logan Airport, they can find refuge in
"Kidsport," special areas equipped with toy rocket ships,
child-sized furniture and nursing areas. "Sometimes the room
gets trashed, and toys and books disappear," says Pat Boyle,
a spokesman for the Pittsburgh airport. "But then we'll get a
gushy letter from some parent, who says, `Thank God it was
there.'"
   Stapleton International Airport in Denver is about to open
a similar play area developed in cooperation with the local
Children's Museum. At Las Vegas's McCarran International
Airport, a baby-changing room that can be used by fathers or
mothers is a popular new feature.
   Not all novel ideas work. One merchant operated electronic
driving ranges, called "Take Off and Tee Off," where
travelers could practice their golf swings between flights at
Pittsburgh and Denver. But the ranges closed for lack of
interest. The idea may get another try in the new Denver
airport, set to open in the fall of 1993.
   Meanwhile, other innovations are taking off. Food is a
good example. The anonymous coffee shop serving mystery meat
is giving way to food courts, which feature several small
eateries, and food carts, which offer increased variety with
a modest inventory. Both are popular in malls.
   Price controls are spreading, too. Airports used to award
contracts to the concessionaires that offered to pay the
airport the highest percentage of gross receipts, a practice
that critics say encouraged overcharging the public to drive
up revenue.
   But, tired of hearing consumer complaints about $2 cups of
coffee, many airport officials are structuring "agreements so
that exorbitant prices aren't charged," says Richard Haury,
program manager for the new Denver airport and a senior vice
president at Irving, Texas-based Greiner Engineering Inc.
Many airports, including Portland (Ore.) International,
Boston Logan and Washington National, require prices to be
close to off-airport prices. In return, some charge lower
rents.
   Washington National officials also scrapped the
traditional approach of relying on a single concessionaire to
run all the airport's watering holes. They instead hired a
developer who subcontracts space to competing restaurateurs
-- with spectacular results. At a year-old food court at the
USAir terminal, sales are clipping along at an impressive
$3.30 per departing passenger (a standard way of measuring
airport sales). That compares with an average $1.12 spent at
the airport's restaurants before the food court opened.
   "What it says is, if you give people quality and products
at reasonable prices, people will spend the money," says
Clyde Bingman, manager of commercial programs for the
Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which runs
Washington National and Washington Dulles International
Airport.
   Another food trend is the greater use of brand names.
"Instead of generic pizza, you might get Pizza Hut," says
Halcyon's Mr. Moriarity. The brand names assure travelers
they are getting value for their dollar, adds Mr. Bingman.
Haagen-Dazs Ice Cream, Au Bon Pain and Sbarro are
increasingly finding homes in airports.
   Not to mention singles' bars. Anton's Bar and Grill at
Washington National is a popular nightspot. "What more could
you want?" says HNTB's Mr. Reiss. "You've got security,
anonymity, food, cocktails. . ." and if you don't like
another customer, "all you have to say is, `Sorry, got to
catch a plane.'"
   In airport retailing, some national chains are becoming
interested in what they see as an affluent, untapped market.
Encouraged by the success of their two stores at John F.
Kennedy International Airport, officials at Bloomingdale's
Bloomie's Express plan to open four more stores in airports
this year and seven next year. Nature Co., which is owned by
CML Group Inc. of Acton, Mass., is "interested in pursuing"
an expansion into the airport market, says Jennifer Kaiser,
the company's director of public relations.
   European airports have been far ahead of American ones in
turning their airports into quasi-shopping malls, with
Copenhagen and Amsterdam leading the list. Both have large
offerings of duty-free goods. Frankfurt, Rome and Zurich
airports also have assorted retail and food outlets.
   Some U.S. airports are emphasizing stores featuring items
made locally or of local interest. "People really want
regional merchandise, not necessarily a mug stamped with a
logo with that city," says Sharon Bergman, senior director of
retail for Concession Air, one of the nation's biggest
airport concessionaires and a unit of Buffalo, N.Y.-based
Delaware North Co.
   Thus, passengers can buy sourdough bread at San Francisco
International Airport, cajun food at New Orleans
International Airport and fresh lobsters at Boston Logan.
Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, which will open a
major new terminal in November, will feature merchandise made
in Arizona or elsewhere in the Southwest.
   The Portland airport has married both retail trends: Nike
Inc., whose corporate headquarters is nearby, has a store
there, and so do several small local retailers who are
pushing made-in-Oregon items and hiking supplies.
   Such local items enhance efforts by airport designers to
instill a sense of place in bland airport terminals. At the
McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, aluminum palm
trees are intermingled with 565 slot machines. The new
Phoenix terminal will display $2 million in art with
Southwestern motifs. It's not always easy for a community to
decide what identity to stress at the airport. "Some people
say Denver is a cowboy town," says Greiner's Mr. Haury, "yet
others say Denver is mountains."
   Airports today ignore consumer needs at their own peril,
says Boston's Mr. Moscaritolo: "People can always fax or
teleconference. There are alternatives to getting on a
plane."

<HEAD>Judge: Cannot Deport Aliens For Espousing Anti-American Beliefs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alien supporters of a Marxist Palestinian
group may not be deported because even non-citizens have the First
Amendment right to espouse anti-American beliefs, a judge ruled in
gutting a McCarthy-era law.
   ``In this case, the government is trying to stifle certain ideas
from entering our society from certain aliens,'' U.S. District Judge
Stephen V. Wilson said.
   ``Our society, however, was built on the premise that only
through the free flow of ideas can our nation grow and prosper.''
   Wilson's ruling Thursday struck down four provisions of the 1952
McCarran-Walter Act that allowed the government to deport aliens who
advocated or were associated with groups espousing anti-American
ideologies including communism.
   He said the sections of the law passed during a time when Sen.
Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., was whipping up Cold War fears against
communism were ``overbroad'' and could cause deportation for
something as simple as wearing a political button.
   ``Now I feel I can speak freely. I did not an hour ago,'' said
Khader Hamide, 34, one of the eight defendants the government had
sought to deport for allegedly supporting the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist member of the Palestine
Liberation Organziation.
   In his ruling, Wilson also threw out an exception to a 1987 law
that recognized free speech rights in deportation proceedings for
all immigrants except members of the PLO.
   Wilson acknowledged world concern over terrorist threats but said
his decision would not interfere with Congress' ability to enforce
laws already in place to deal with terrorism.
   ``Our decision ... today will not significantly deplete the
government's arsenal in combating terrorism,'' said Wilson, whose
ruling applies only to central and southern California.
   Michael P. Lindemann, the Justice Department's lead attorney in
the case, said the ruling would be appealed. He declined further
comment.
   Paul Hoffman of the American Civil Liberties Union, which helped
in the defense, said the long-term effects of Wilson's ruling would
not be evident until all appeals are resolved.
   However, he predicted the case will be resolved by the U.S.
Supreme Court and could create a landmark precedent in First
Amendment law.
   The case involved seven Jordanians of Palestinian descent and a
Kenyan who were arrested two years ago, held without bail and
subjected to deportation proceedings under the 36-year-old law. An
immigration judge released them after prosecutors refused to present
their allegations in public, demanding a secret forum that was
refused.
   The government eventually dropped McCarran-Walter proceedings
against all but two, although it sought deportation of the others on
technical grounds.
   Wilson cited the landmark 1969 decision in Brandenburg vs. Ohio,
in which the Supreme Court held that the government can only
prohibit speech directed toward inciting imminent lawless action.
   The judge also ruled that the PLO exception to the 1987 Foreign
Relations Authorization Act violated guarantees of due process and
equal protection under the law.
   The Arab-American Anti-Discrimination committee sued the Justice
Department on behalf of the immigrants, joined by the ACLU and the
New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights,
   ``We feel as a community now we can speak our minds on the
Palestinian issue,'' said Hamide, 34. ``We can speak our minds on
the uprising on the West Bank and in Gaza and express our opinions
freely without the fear of being put in jail.''
   David Cole of the Center for Constitutional Rights said the
ruling on the PLO exception means that ``Congress cannot make
politically motivated distinctions in providing First Amendment
rights to aliens.''

<HEAD>Sends Shudder Through Buildings In Las Vegas, 105 Miles Away</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first announced nuclear weapon test
of 1988 rocked the Nevada desert Monday and sent a shudder through
some high-rise buildings in Las Vegas, 105 miles from ground zero.
   The device produced an explosive punch up to 11 times as
powerful as the atomic bomb that devastated Hiroshima.
   The test was conducted three weeks after a team of Soviet
nuclear scientists visited the top secret Nevada Test Site _ a
visit that could lead to the monitoring of each other's tests and a
possible test ban.
   And it came the same day the second round of U.S.-Soviet
negotiations on nuclear testing began in Geneva with the Soviets
calling for agreement by June on anti-cheating provisions. That
would permit ratification of two superpower treaties limiting the
yield of test blasts.
   The test, code named Kernville, was delayed two hours because of
unfavorable wind conditions, then another 10 minutes because of
technical problems, according to Department of Energy spokeswoman
Barbara Yoerg.
   The experiment was buried 1,800 feet below the surface of Pahute
Mesa, about 105 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   Managers of tall buildings in Las Vegas were warned in advance
not to have workers in precarious positions at the time of the
blast, a standard warning when tests are close to the upper test
limit of 150 kilotons of explosive force.
   Motion was recorded on DOE seismographs at the Riviera Hotel on
the Las Vegas Strip, the Regency Towers Apartments here, and
Scotty's Castle in Death Valley, Calif., southwest of the test site.
   A telephone operator at the high-rise Fitzgerald Hotel in
downtown Las Vegas said hanging plants swayed in the seconds after
the 10:10 a.m. PST detonation. But a controller at McCarran
International Airport control tower reported feeling no motion.
   Ms. Yoerg said she felt no ground motion at the control point,
41 miles from ground zero.
   The blast measured 5.4 on the Richter scale of ground motion at
the National Earthquake Information Center, Golden, Colo.
   ``Everything was fully contained. That makes it a successful
test,'' she said.
   Ms. Yoerg said the test was ``weapons-related'' and sponsored by
Livermore National Laboratory in California.
   It brought to 675 the total number of announced blasts at the
Nevada Test Site since testing began there in 1951. It was the
470th test announced by the United States since the limited test
ban treaty of August 1963, she said.
   The most recent previous test was Mission Cyber, fired on Dec.
2, 1987. There were 15 announced tests last year and 12 announced
tests in 1986. Not all tests are announced for security reasons,
the DOE says.

   A plane that crashed into a foggy
mountaintop, killing a Las Vegas church leader and eight family
members on a holiday trip to Disneyland, failed to clear the ridge
by less than 200 feet, authorities said.
   The wreckage of the chartered twin-engine Cessna 402 was found
Monday near the top of a 2,270-foot ridge overlooking Hagador Canyon
in the Santa Ana Mountains of Southern California.
   The plane crashed Sunday, scattering bodies and debris over a
100-yard area in the Cleveland National Forest 45 miles southeast of
Los Angeles.
   ``There were toys in the airplane, including two little stuffed
Mickey Mouses,'' said Mickey Worthington of the Riverside County
coroner's office.
   The dead were tentatively identified as Michael Cranson, 36, a
Las Vegas police officer; his wife, Raeann, 33; their five children
_ Shauna, 15; Stephanie, 14; Nicole, 12; Joshua, 11; and Kyle, 7 _
James Montano, 24, and Cynthia Montano, 23. The Montanos were
identified in Las Vegas as Raeann Cranson's sister and
brother-in-law.
   Also killed in the crash was the pilot, identified as Hassan
Berro, co-owner of Las Vegas Flyers charter line.
   ``They found Michael, and they found his police badge,'' said
Merrill Pugmire, who is bishop of the family's Mormon Church stake
in Las Vegas.
   The plane left McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas on
Sunday morning and went down about 20 miles short of its
destination, Orange County John Wayne Airport. The plane vanished
from radar screens that afternoon.
   ``The bodies and baggage were ripped apart and scattered over the
peak,'' said KNX-AM reporter Bob Tur, who discovered the wreckage
during a helicopter flight. He said the fuselage was twisted, broken
into several pieces and partly buried.
   Cranson was president of a Mormon young men's group and had been
active in youth work and Scouting, he said.
   ``They were very excited, they had been planning this as a family
weekend get-together,'' said family friend Lora Dee Christensen, who
spent Monday morning at the Cranson home. ``They were very devoted
to their church and always very concerned about each other. They
were just a beautiful family.''
   The crash was under investigation by the National Transportation
Safety Board, whose crew arrived at the crash site late Monday.

JUDGE HOLDS UP U.S. BID TO DEPORT 'SUBVERSIVES'
</P>

Government efforts to deport a group of immigrants once charged with subversion
ran into more roadblocks Friday in Immigration Court as Justice Department
attorneys admitted that they had wrongly charged one of the defendants with
fraud in a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
Immigration Judge Ingrid K. Hrycenko ruled that deportation efforts aimed at
two lead defendants -- Khader Hamide, 35, of Los Angeles, and Michel Shehadeh,
33, of Long Beach -- cannot proceed until a federal court decision affecting
their cases is resolved.
</P>
<P>
Hamide and Shehadeh face subversion charges under the McCarran-Walter Act. The
act, passed during the McCarthy era of the 1950s, allows the deportation of
aliens for advocating world communism, totalitarian dictatorship or the
unlawful destruction of property.
</P>
<P>
Last December, U.S. District Judge Stephen V. Wilson in Los Angeles overturned
several of the act's political sections and declared that aliens have the same
broad free speech rights as U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
Until the McCarran-Walter decision is resolved -- whether through the appellate
process or simply by having the government throw in the towel -- Hrycenko ruled
that their cases "will not proceed."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
8 Immigrants Jailed
</P>
<P>
Hamide and Shehadeh were among eight immigrants -- seven Palestinians and a
Kenyan -- arrested in January, 1987, and jailed for almost two weeks on charges
that they belonged to a Palestinian group with a history of terrorism. All
denied the charges, and none were charged criminally.
</P>
<P>
Charges were eventually dropped against three other immigrants. But three more
still faced lesser deportation charges -- and for the first time in 27 months
the government proceeded against them this week.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, a three-man team of Justice Department attorneys from Washington
moved against Bashar Amer, 27, of Glendale. He is charged with not maintaining
his academic status -- that is, not taking 12 units a semester, as generally
required by immigration rules, at Chaffey College in Rancho Cucamonga between
1985 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, immigration officials subpoenaed Amer's college records. But when
Justice Department attorney Stewart Deutsch produced the subpoena for the court
on Friday, it said that Amer was being investigated in connection with "a fraud
against the United States."
</P>
<P>
A surprised Hrycenko asked Deutsch how that could be possible when the charge
against Amer was that he had not taken enough college credits to remain in the
country.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Maybe It's Sloppiness'
</P>
<P>
"There is no fraud," Deutsch admitted. "That is an error."
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's solely sloppiness," said Hrycenko. She continued Amer's hearing
until July so that the government could change the charge.
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based immigration official who signed the erroneous subpoena,
John Brechtel, assistant district director for investigations, could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
Amer's lawyer, Marc Van Der Hout of the National Lawyers Guild, said he had "no
reason to think (the fraud charge) wasn't intentional" in light of the
government's continuing efforts to deport the immigrants.

<TEXT>
   Contrary to your July 8 page-one article "Unaccustomed Risk," the insurance industry is not free of antitrust curbs.
The McCarran-Ferguson Act simply delegates antitrust authority to the states in the same way that other key financial institutions such as banks or securities are regulated.
This public-policy determination opts for a regulatory structure rather than free application of federal antitrust laws.

   Moreover, the charge that McCarran allows price fixing to be "perfectly legal" is untrue.
Rather, McCarran gives the states the authority to regulate insurance prices.
Some state laws require the states to set rates, while others require state approval for certain rates.
Some permit free and open competition.
The point is that in every state, anticompetitive and discriminatory practices are prohibited.
Insurance rates are developed exactly as state laws require, and no state requires -- or permits -- insurers to fix prices.

   While the article focused on property/ casualty insurers, the McCarran proposals that have surfaced in the House Judiciary Committee are equally troubling to the life- and health-insurance business.
Because the language of the proposed bill is imprecise and excessively broad, it would subject the joint activities of all insurers to antitrust challenge.
In addition, it would raise the prospect of unnecessary, duplicative and possibly conflicting regulation at the hands of the Federal Trade Commission.

   The cancellation of policyholders in West Virginia was based on legislation that would have destroyed the ability of medical-malpractice insurers to exercise their own judgment regarding applicants' insurability.
In effect, the state was given the right to determine who was considered an acceptable insurance risk.
No insurer can long survive if it is forced to accept applicants without regard to the risk that they pose.
After a good-faith effort by insurers to reach a reasonable solution, a special session of the West Virginia Legislature amended the legislation.
Despite the restrictive regulatory provisions that remained, several insurers rescinded their cancellation notices.

   Further, the alleged boycott of pollution coverage is unfounded.
Elimination of pollution coverage from commercial general liability policies was a necessary and inevitable reaction to increasingly broad court decisions.
Insurers continued to cover pollution liability under a separate policy to eliminate possible judicial misinterpretation of contract language that could create exposure for which no premium had been collected.

   Your story did not mention the benefits to insurance buyers resulting from insurers' permissible collective activities.
The industry's collective activity under state regulation enhances buyers' ability to comparison-shop, and increases the affordability and availability of insurance in the marketplace by increasing individual insurers' confidence that their prices bear a reasonable relationship with their expected claim costs.

   The benefits of the industry's limited antitrust exemption under the McCarran-Ferguson Act are recognized by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which "unequivocally concluded that repeal of the limited exemption of McCarran would be severely detrimental to state regulation and the interests of the insurance-buying public."

   In addition, the Risk &amp; Insurance Management Society, the association of corporate insurance buyers, declared in April: "RIMS recognizes that Congress gave insurance companies a limited antitrust exemption . . . to develop common policy forms so the public interest would be served."
And the organization said: "RIMS suggests that repealing or modifying this act would not have prevented the last market crunch and will not moderate future cycles."

   Jeffrey M. Yates, executive vice president of the Independent Insurance Agents of America, has said: "If McCarran-Ferguson is repealed and we no longer have standardized policy forms, insurance consumers would never be sure what coverages they were getting.
Agents would be charged with the formidable task of evaluating some 3,500 inconsistent policy forms, making it nearly impossible to compare coverages."

   These are not the self-serving conclusions of insurance companies.
Rather, they are the considered views of the country's most knowledgeable public officials, business-insurance buyers and independent insurance professionals.

   A company that started building a $60 million,
magnetically levitated passenger rail system in Las Vegas has
abandoned the project, leaving behind concrete track pillars and an
unfinished station.
   Magnetic Transit of America Inc. cited financial difficulties
and ``reasons beyond our control'' for pulling out of the elevated
rail project Thursday.
   ``It has become increasingly evident that termination is the
only responsible business decision to be made,'' said MTA President
John Kapala.
   MTA had built a dozen track pillars and a station at the
Children's Museum in the new downtown library as part of its plan
to run a 1.1-mile magnetically levitated system through the
downtown area.
   The company was rebuffed in its efforts to link the proposed
system with the Las Vegas Strip, the glitzy heart of the casino
district. Kapala said that was ``a very important element'' in the
decision to scrap the project.
   City Councilman Arnie Adamsen said the West German company
pulled out purely for business reasons.
   Adamsen said the company intended the system to be a
demonstration of the new technology and hoped to eventually link it
to the Strip, McCarran International Airport and other parts of the
Las Vegas Valley.
   ``It wasn't going to be a revenue producer,'' Adamsen said. ``It
was presented to me as the first leg of a transportation system in
the valley.''
   Adamsen said city officials, who obtained a $1.6 million grant
from the federal government to build the Children's Museum station,
made it clear to MTA officials in meetings this week that it is the
company's responsibility for paying an estimated $4 million to
remove what has already been built.
   The company had constructed 12 concrete columns and some 7,000
square feet of platform at the museum station. It said it invested
$10 million in the project.
   Construction on the system began in 1988 but was halted in June
as the company began reassessing the project.
   Skeptics had said from the project's inception that it would
carry few riders between the Cashman Field convention center and
ballpark complex and downtown and would have to be part of a bigger
system linked with the airport and Strip to succeed.

   Some travel companies don't bury restrictions in their ads.
They just don't disclose them at all.

   Even though they may be violating a federal regulation, some companies are running ads for low international air fares without mentioning key restrictions.
In some cases, for example, the companies charge extra for using credit cards.
One offers a car-rental special that's valid only if two people travel.
And many of the fares are non-refundable and apply only for a few weeks.

   The companies are known as ticket consolidators, because they typically buy blocks of tickets wholesale from airlines.
They insist they disclose restrictions when customers call, and thus don't need to outline them in print.

   "Most people know to look for these things," says Fred Kunzmann, owner of KTS Services of New York, which didn't mention in a recent ad that it charges a $100 cancellation fee on some discounted fares.
Another consolidator, Airborne Vacations, says its one-inch ads are too small to list restrictions.

   But since the ads don't mention limitations, they "attract people who assume there aren't any," says Barbara Opotowsky, president of the New York Better Business Bureau.
It recently investigated 24 local ticket consolidators, and convinced some of them to describe some restrictions.

   Most ticket consolidators, though, don't.
At the Department of Transportation, officials say they were unaware of the practice, but that consolidators could be violating unfair and deceptive trade-practice regulations.
"They can't just advertise as if there are no restrictions," says Sam Podberesky, an assistant general counsel for the agency.

   Co-Pilot for a Day
   Ben Smith has flown a dozen times in the co-pilot seat for Provincetown-Boston Airlines.
And he doesn't know the first thing about flying.

   PBA is one of a few commuter carriers that still operate some planes with one pilot and put passengers in empty co-pilot seats.
The Federal Aviation Adminstration allows this on planes with fewer than nine seats; it says such planes require only one pilot because they're easier to operate.

   "If the other seat is empty, why not use it?" asks an FAA spokesman.

   But some safety experts say chatty passengers can distract the pilot; clumsy and overanxious "co-pilots" could too.
"Some yahoo could grab the throttle," says John Galipault, president of the Aviation Safety Institute in Worthington, Ohio.
PBA calls that highly unlikely, and says the practice hasn't caused any mishaps.

   "Most people want to sit up front" to watch the pilot, says a PBA spokesman.
In fact, Mr. Smith, owner of the Point Way Inn in Edgartown, Mass., says he often volunteers to sit in the co-pilot seat to get a unique perspective on takeoffs and landings.

   "The only thing I wonder about is, if this guys gets a heart attack, will I have to fly the plane?"
Mr. Smith says.

   All Lots Full
   There's a new hassle to flying.
It's called parking.

   Once a problem only on holidays, airport parking is now a daily struggle in many cities.
Pick any Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday, and the main lots at Chicago's O'Hare and New Jersey's Newark airports will probably be packed.
At Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, parking volume is up 23% from a year ago; the airport now has to turn away drivers from some long-term lots two or three times a week.

   And even with 24,200 spaces -- the most for any U.S. airport -- Los Angeles International Airport is "approaching a pretty tight crunch," says parking manager Roy Yoneda.

   The problem isn't confined to just the large airports; parking volume is up 40% at both Chicago's Midway and Las Vegas' McCarran airports this year.
To cope, Midway added a new lot last spring, and McCarran began using employee-parking spaces.

   Obviously, the rise in air travel in recent years is largely to blame.
"Most airports didn't plan for this," says Marie Witmer, director of technical services for the Institutional and Municipal Parking Congress, a trade group.
"Parking never gets top billing, until it's a problem."

   Some airports have started to build new lots.
But most major expansion efforts won't be completed for at least another year.
In the meantime, travelers must risk missing flights because they can't find spaces, or must wait in long lines to get through exit toll booths.

   At Newark, though, long lines can pay off; drivers are occasionally let through the booths without paying.
Says Vincent Bonaventura, Newark airport's general manager: "We lose revenue, but it clears up the line."

A tape recording of conversations between controllers and a pilot has shed no
new light on the Feb. 19 crash of a private plane that killed 10 Las Vegans
bound for John Wayne Airport.
</P>
<P>
Federal Aviation Administration officials played the tape Friday at a news
conference at McCarran International Airport. The tape indicated no problems
and ended with pilot Hassan Berro confirming that he was 4 miles east of
Corona, Calif., and headed for John Wayne under visual flight rules.
</P>
<P>
The plane crashed moments later in heavy clouds, near the top of a 2,270-foot
ridge in the Santa Ana Mountains.
</P>
<P>
Las Vegas Metro Police Officer Michael Cranson, his wife, their five children
and Cranson's sister-in-law and brother-in-law were killed along with the
pilot.
</P>
<P>
The officer was taking his family on a trip from Las Vegas to Los Angeles when
the crash occurred.
</P>
<P>
The tape between Berro and controllers at Norton and Riverside indicated no
problems and ended with the controller telling the pilot that radar service was
terminated and the plane was to continue under VFR into the Orange County
airport.

A Southern California pilot escaped serious injury when his small plane crashed
about a mile short of the runway at Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The plane skidded across vacant lots and halted about 20 feet from a concrete
wall. Authorities said the pilot, Donald Morrill, 57, of Highland, near San
Bernardino, radioed the tower that he was running low on fuel. He was
hospitalized in stable condition with face and ankle injuries. The plane was
flying from Utah to California.

   LOS ANGELES -- The brisk knocking jolted Khader Hamide
from bed at 7 a.m. Immigration and Naturalization Service,
the visitor said. Mr. Hamide, a longtime legal alien and
aspiring U.S. citizen, inched open the door. Shoved from the
other side, it flew wide, and the room filled with initials:
FBI, INS, LAPD.
   Mr. Hamide was a terrorist, they said, handing him an
arrest warrant. Outside, police had blocked off the street; a
helicopter hovered overhead. Handcuffed, Mr. Hamide and his
wife, Julie, were taken away in separate cars.

<TEXT>
   At a half-dozen locations in the Los Angeles area that
Monday morning in January 1987, scores of federal agents
crashed in on seven suspected Palestinian terrorists,
including a Kuwaiti engineering student on his honeymoon, who
awakened to pointed guns. An eighth suspect was arrested
later while taking a college chemistry exam.
   For 23 days, six of the detainees sat in maximum security
cells. The INS sought their deportation under the Cold
War-era McCarran-Walter Act, alleging they belonged to a
group promoting world communism -- specifically, the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, or PFLP, a violent
Marxist splinter group of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   More than four years later, and still unresolved, the case
of the "LA Eight" has come to symbolize the conundrum
confronting free societies faced with the threat of
terrorism: How can a government protect the public from
political violence without trampling the rights of those it
suspects of aiding or carrying out terrorist activities? In
this case the answer may be hidden in the twilight zone
separating advocacy of a Palestinian state with support for
terrorism to achieve that goal.
   The question, says Brian Jenkins, a terrorism specialist
at the security firm of Kroll Associates, is, "What is the
tradeoff between public safety and civil rights?"
   None of the LA Eight have been deported. The courts have
refused to hear evidence that prosecutors say must be kept
secret to protect the identity of informants. But the
government has been tenacious. When the immigration law was
changed last year, the government changed the charges against
Mr. Hamide and another man for the third time in four years.
   Civil libertarians argue that the case cuts to the heart
of the constitutional ideal of America, to the free speech
and due process rights accorded even those with radical
ideas. No one has accused the eight of any crimes, and all
deny belonging to the PFLP or having anything to do with
terrorism.
   But the government contends that its ability to protect
national security is threatened if it can't deport aliens it
knows to be involved with terrorist groups, even if it dare
not reveal its evidence. "Do we wait for these people to blow
up the federal building?" asked William B. Odencrantz, INS
regional counsel in San Francisco at the time of the arrests.
The government contends, in filings in U.S. court in Los
Angeles, that once deportation proceedings begin, "the
guarantees of the Bill of Rights are constitutionally
irrelevant."
   There is no doubt the LA Eight are passionately
pro-Palestinian. Mr. Hamide, 37, moved to the U.S. from the
Israeli-occupied West Bank in 1971 to go to college. His
wife-to-be arrived from Kenya four years later for the same
reason. They met in the MBA program at the University of
Oregon. She later worked as an accountant; he sold sun shades
for windshields and sometimes worked as a waiter.
   But politics is Mr. Hamide's life, as he says it is for
most Palestinians. "We eat, drink and sleep politics," he
says. "Every Palestinian gathering turns into a political
discussion. You don't choose to be a political person as a
Palestinian -- you are a political person." Mr. Hamide voiced
his views publicly, writing letters-to-the-editor or
appearing at small college forums. He also worked in the
presidential campaigns of Jesse Jackson. All the while, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation was taking note.
   After a delay of several years, the INS had told Mr.
Hamide he could be sworn in as a U.S. citizen the last week
of January 1987. He was arrested instead.
   Mr. Hamide thought one of the arresting agents looked
familiar. Have we met before, he asked. The man replied that
he had lived next door to Mr. Hamide's Glendale, Calif.,
apartment. For eight months they had shared a thin wall.
"They knew every time I had sex with my wife," Mr. Hamide
says.
   In papers filed in U.S. court here, the government has
admitted tapping the phones of the defendants and their
lawyers. It won't say whether the monitoring continues, but
Mr. Hamide thinks it does. "You never get used to that," he
says.
   The INS, a part of the Justice Department, says the 1987
arrests culminated a three-year FBI probe into a shadowy
network that raised funds for terrorism abroad and threatened
to serve as a springboard for violence in the U.S. According
to the FBI, Mr. Hamide was the California head of an active
but furtive recruiting and support system for the PFLP.
Although the PFLP hasn't been linked to terrorism in the
U.S., its international record is long. It includes the 1976
plane hijacking that was foiled by Israeli commandos at
Entebbe airport in Uganda.
   After the arrests, an INS lawyer acting on orders from the
attorney general sought to block bail for the LA Eight by
introducing secret evidence linking them to the PFLP.
Immigration Judge Roy Daniels in Los Angeles refused to hear
anything in a closed session, and the government declined to
reveal its material in open court, saying that would breach
national security. Mr. Hamide and four others were released
on their own recognizance; the others posted low bonds.
   All eight were first charged under the 1952
McCarran-Walter Act, an effort to guard against subversion
from Soviet-backed communism. It said aliens could be
deported if they belonged to a group advocating "world
communism" or other "totalitarian" doctrine. The law has been
used to bar thousands of foreigners because of their beliefs,
actual and reputed, but hasn't been used often to expel
people. According to the INS, 230 people were deported under
the law in the 1950s and 18 in the 1970s.
   But with the fear of terrorism rising, 31 people were
deported in the 1980s under the statute. It was amid this
atmosphere, and growing concern about possible
Libyan-sponsored terrorism and disruption of the 1984
Olympics in Los Angeles, that the case of the LA Eight
unfolded.
   Three months after the arrests, the INS dropped the
original charges. It instead sought to deport six of the
eight on visa violations, ranging from taking too few classes
to working without a permit. Mr. Hamide and Michel Shehadeh
were also charged with belonging to a group promoting
destruction of property.
   In December 1988, U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson in
Los Angeles dismissed the charges, saying the cited provision
of the McCarran-Walter Act was in discord with free-speech
guarantees. The INS filed new McCarran-Walter charges against
Messrs. Hamide and Shehadeh, this time accusing them of
belonging to a group that advocates assassinating public
officials. Judge Wilson again dismissed the charges, but his
ruling was overturned last July by the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals on the ground he had acted prematurely.
   Enactment of the 1990 Immigration Act a year ago killed
the ideological provisions of the McCarran-Walter law by
explicitly giving aliens the same free-speech rights as
citizens. But the INS filed additional charges against
Messrs. Hamide and Shehadeh in April under the new law's
provision allowing deportation of those who give "material
support," such as financing, to terrorists. The INS didn't
say what aid the men provided. "We think they're deportable
under the 1990 act for terrorism," says a Justice Department
spokesman. "That's all we want to say."
   The case of the LA Eight drags on. Mr. Hamide has toured
the country speaking about his case. Bashar Amer, a
pharmacology student, fought and won the government's
challenge to his visa status, but now faces an INS appeal.
   Aiad Khaled Barakat and Naim Sharif filed for amnesty
under the 1986 immigration act in June 1987. Last year they
sued to find out what was happening. In March the INS replied
that it had secret evidence that they belonged to the PFLP
and that they had 30 days to disprove membership or be denied
amnesty. Messrs. Barakat and Sharif then filed a second suit,
challenging the grounds the INS used to deny them amnesty.
   Whatever the truth of the charges against them, the lives
of all eight have changed radically. Mr. Barakat owned a
masonry business, making good money and working on the
blueprints for a dream house. He says he lost contracts the
three weeks he was in jail, and the company later failed.
After being laid off from a construction job in Virginia, he
adds, he now works as a short-order cook.
   Amjad Obeid, the Kuwaiti whose honeymoon was interrupted
by the INS raid, says he missed the funeral of a sister.
Because of his arrest, he can't return to the U.S. should he
ever visit Kuwait.
   Mr. Shehadeh says that his seven-year-old son sometimes
woke up screaming after seeing his father dragged off by the
FBI, and that his wife lost her job at a day-care center
because of the taint of terrorism. "At the beginning, friends
start avoiding you," he adds. "They didn't believe {the
charges} but they knew we were under surveillance."
   For Mr. Sharif, who moved to the U.S. in 1978 and was
working in a plant nursery at the time of his arrest, the
case sometimes seems to shadow every relationship. Co-workers
jibed him, asking for bombing tips or ways to assassinate the
boss. He lives with his parents, his brother and his family.
He says he is afraid to start his own home with possible
deportation hanging over his head.
   "I never believed that this could happen in the United
States," he says.

LAS VEGAS MAGLEV RAIL PLAN ABANDONED;
</P>

TRANSPORTATION: INCREASED COSTS, DELAYS ARE BLAMED FOR THE DECISION. ORGANIZERS
SAY SOUTHLAND PROJECTS COULD BE HIT BY SIMILAR PROBLEMS.

<P>
A plan to build a mile-long magnetic levitation rail line in downtown Las Vegas
to demonstrate the utility of the new technology has been abandoned, the victim
of unexpectedly high costs and bureaucratic delay.
</P>
<P>
The demise of what would have been the first maglev line in the Far West comes
as uncertainties are being expressed about the feasibility of much larger
proposed maglev projects, including a Las Vegas-to-Anaheim high-speed line and
one between Los Angeles International Airport and Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
Although the Las Vegas plan was not linked to those, its organizers say they
encountered many of the problems that could dog the larger efforts.
</P>
<P>
In a magnetic levitation system, trains riding on a slight cushion of air are
propelled along a guideway by electromagnetic forces. Plans call for speeds
exceeding 200 m.p.h. on high-speed lines, but the maximum speed on the short
Las Vegas line would have been about 45 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview this week from his offices in Pittsburgh, John Kapala,
president of Magnetic Transit of America, a subsidiary of AEG-Westinghouse
International, said the decision to break off construction in Las Vegas,
leaving a few barren columns and a single nearly completed station, was made by
German entrepreneurs who recently bought into AEG.
</P>
<P>
"We have been working on this program for five years," Kapala said. "There were
a lot of delays that increased the costs of the program. It took a long time to
get the approval of the Nevada Public Service Commission. We also had trouble
with rights of way and local approvals. . . . It just got to the point where it
was no longer economically viable to proceed."
</P>
<P>
Kapala said the cost originally was projected at $56 million. He would not say
what the projected cost was at the end, but knowledgeable sources in Las Vegas
said it was more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
Just as with the proposed maglev projects in California, the Las Vegas train
was supposed to be funded entirely through the private sector, with the
government contributing only rights of way.
</P>
<P>
Recently, some private promoters have said that because of the tight economy,
now is not the best time to solicit investments for largely untried new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
But promoters say fast government approvals are needed to keep costs from
soaring because of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Only two weeks ago, at a meeting of the California-Nevada Super Speed Train
Commission, which is charged with the Las Vegas-Anaheim high-speed train, an
official of the Bechtel Corp., the franchisee designated to build that project,
warned that expedited legislative and other approvals are needed if that line
is to secure investors.
</P>
<P>
Before Bechtel could go ahead, approval of the California and Nevada
legislatures would be necessary. The company has been given about a year to
study the feasibility of the Las Vegas-Anaheim line.
</P>
<P>
Kapala said that Las Vegas city authorities were as helpful as possible to the
would-be builders of the one-mile line, but county officials and the business
community on the Las Vegas Strip were less helpful. A proposed eventual
extension of the downtown line down the middle of the strip did not win
support.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the area itself, Las Vegas, the county, the businessmen, are in
unison on how to proceed with traffic projects, and until they are, I don't
think anyone will be successful," said Kapala.
</P>
<P>
A Japanese-owned firm, the HSST-Nevada Corp., has proposed a larger local
maglev project serving the strip and the McCarran Airport.
</P>
<P>
Most city officials declined comment on the downtown line. Tom Graham, the
city's director of design and development, said only, "The company had rights
to terminate, if it was determined it wasn't feasible, and they so determined."

Tuesday.;    Ruling in a case brought by California and 18 other states
against 32 U.S. and foreign insurance companies, the U.S. Court of Appeals in
San Francisco found that a lower court had erred in dismissing the case. The
lower court had ruled largely on the grounds that the insurers were exempt
from antitrust suits under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which Congress passed in
1945. The act provided what had been considered sweeping exemptions to the
insurance industry from antitrust law.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Lawyers for the states and other legal experts said the ruling marked a

key provisions.;    The appeals court said insurers lose their antitrust
exemption when they work in concert with foreign insurers or with other
companies not covered by the act to fix prices or control the market.;    And
it said that in this case the insurers had lost their antitrust exemption by
organizing a boycott by reinsurers of insurance companies that were balking at
changes the defendants were seeking in the way liability insurance is sold.
Boycotts are specifically excluded from the actions allowed under the McCarran
Act.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Blast Measures 5.6 on Richter Scale, Felt in Las Vegas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A nuclear weapons test rocked the Nevada
desert today, registering 5.6 on the Richter scale and causing a
swaying motion in high-rise buildings here, 100 miles from ground
zero.
   John Minsch, a spokesman for the National Earthquake Information
Center in Golden, Colo., said the reading indicated the test was
one of the larger ones conducted at the desert site.
   The device was detonated 40 miles from Mercury, a tiny town on
the Nevada Test Site where Soviet nuclear scientists are based
while preparing for a joint U.S.-Soviet test next month.
   A controller in the tower at McCarran International Airport in
Las Vegas said the tower rocked slightly seconds after the blast,
at 8:05 a.m.
   A telephone switchboard operator at Fitzgerald's Hotel in
downtown Las Vegas said a guest on the 29th floor called to ask why
she felt ground motion.
   And a receptionist at the Lionel, Sawyer law firm, atop a
high-rise office building downtown, said she felt a ``dizzy,
swirling feeling'' at the time of the blast. She said a hanging
plant in the office began swaying.
   All three declined to give their names.
   Motion was recorded on Energy Department seismographs atop
several hotel-casinos on the Las Vegas Strip and downtown. Motion
was also recorded at Scotty's Castle in Death Valley, Calif., west
of the test site.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.An earthquake or explosion of 3.5 on the Richter scale
can cause slight damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5
considerable damage, 6 severe damage.
   The test was delayed five minutes while controllers checked out
a malfunctioning signal.
   Energy Department spokesman Chris West said the test appeared to
be normal, with no indications of any problems. West, who was in a
control center 25 miles from ground zero, said monitors at the site
indicated no radiation had escaped the ground.
   He said slight ground motion was felt in the control center.
   Today's test was the eighth conducted this year, and the sixth
conducted with Soviet scientists on site.
   The Soviet scientists arrived earlier this year to begin
preparing for next month's joint verification experiment. The
Soviet scientists will monitor a U.S. test in mid-August and U.S.
scientists will monitor a Soviet test a month later.
   The experiments are designed to determine the ability of each
country to monitor the size of the other's tests. Such monitoring
capabilities are critical in test limitation treaties.
   The DOE had issued a warning to managers of high-rise buildings
in Las Vegas not to have workers in precarious positions at the
time of today's detonation. Such warnings are issued only when the
test is near 150 kilotons, the upper limits allowable under
U.S.-Soviet treaties.
   The nuclear device was buried 2,000 feet beneath the surface of
Pahute Mesa, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   The most recent previous test was June 22, when two nuclear
devices were detonated simultaneously in a rare experiment.

   Your Nov. 11 page-one article on the U.S. attempt to
deport the "LA Eight" for their alleged affiliation with the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine characterizes
the case as symbolizing a "conundrum": "How can a government
protect the public from political violence without trampling
the rights of those it suspects of aiding or carrying out
terrorist activities?" In fact, the case presents no such
conundrum, because the U.S. has admitted from the outset that
these individuals have committed no crimes whatsoever.
   No less an authority than William Webster, then-director
of the FBI, has given the LA Eight a clean bill of health.
Testifying in Congress shortly after their arrest, he stated
that they had committed no crimes whatsoever, and that if
they were U.S. citizens the U.S. could do nothing against
them. If they had aided or carried out "terrorist
activities," they would be guilty of several criminal
offenses, but according to the FBI, they had not.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service's recent
actions in the case underscore the lack of evidence that the
LA Eight have committed or assisted in any terrorist acts. In
October, an immigration judge ordered the INS to choose
whether to proceed under the new immigration law's
"terrorism" provisions, or under the old McCarran-Walter Act
provisions, which base deportation not on terrorist acts but
on advocacy of ideas. (Although Congress repealed the
McCarran-Walter Act last year, it let pending cases proceed
under the repealed act.) Notwithstanding the INS's loose
charges of "terrorism," the agency chose to proceed under the
advocacy charges.
   Thus, the conundrum posed by this case is not how to deal
with terrorists, but how to deal with a government that uses
accusations of terrorism as a cover for deporting people
solely for their political ideas.

A light plane making an emergency approach to Whiteman Airport in Pacoima hit
power lines and crashed onto a San Fernando street Wednesday night, seriously
injuring the pilot and his passenger and disrupting power to nearly 3,000
residents, authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two-seat Cessna 152 crashed eight minutes after pilot Anthony Ast, 31,
radioed the Burbank Airport tower to report a loss of engine power, said Wayne
Pollack, air safety investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
Pollack said the plane appeared to have nose-dived onto Truman Street -- at
Wolfskill Street -- after striking a group of 4,000-volt power lines about
11:10 p.m. Firefighters had to cut through the wreckage to free Ast and
passenger Petra Yearwood, 32, according to a Los Angeles City Fire Department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The plane was returning to Whiteman from Las Vegas, where the couple had gone
on a pleasure trip, Pollack said. No one on the ground was injured.
</P>
<P>
Electricity was disrupted for about 30 seconds to 2,000 San Fernando residents
after the crash, and 854 customers were without power for slightly more than
two hours, said Rosalie Gnam, area manager for the Southern California Edison
Co.
</P>
<P>
Ast underwent surgery Thursday morning at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission
Hills and was listed in stable condition with a broken ankle and cuts, hospital
spokeswoman Maggie Cessar said. Yearwood suffered a broken spine and ankle and
multiple cuts, Cessar said.
</P>
<P>
Ast is a resident of Simi Valley, according to his pilot's certificate.
Officials had not determined Yearwood's hometown.
</P>
<P>
The crash occurred on a stretch of road lined by small businesses and light
industry, about two miles northwest of Whiteman Airport.
</P>
<P>
Pollack said it would be several months before safety inspectors determine the
cause of the crash. He said that a preliminary review of the wreckage showed
that there was very little fuel in the wing tanks, but it had not been
determined if the plane had run out of gas.
</P>
<P>
The plane had taken off from McCarren International Airport in Las Vegas at
8:15 p.m., Pollack said. He said Ast holds a commercial pilot's license and is
a certified flight instructor and aircraft mechanic.
</P>
<P>
Pollack said the registered operator of the aircraft is Sunquest Aviation,
which rents planes at Whiteman Airport.

<HL> Insurers Threatened by a Nearsighted Debate </HL>

<TEXT>
   The Justice Department is now working with Congress on new legislation to strip the insurance industry of its exemption from federal antitrust laws under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.
This follows attacks on the act from Federal Trade Commission Chairman Daniel Oliver and vitriolic defenses of the status quo from the insurance industry and its regulators.
Rarely has so much energy been devoted to a debate so irrelevant.

   McCarran-Ferguson was enacted in 1945 to preserve state control over insurance regulation in response to a Supreme Court decision holding insurance part of interstate commerce and therefore subject to federal action.
The act declares that "no act of Congress shall be construed to invalidate, impair or supersede any law enacted by any state for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance."
It goes on to state that various antitrust laws "shall be applicable to the business of insurance to the extent that such business is not regulated by state law."

   In view of this language, it is not at first blush surprising that state regulators are at the forefront of those opposing repeal or even modification of McCarran-Ferguson.

   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners recently released a position paper, passed unanimously by the state regulators, asserting that modification of the act would have no effect on the availability or affordability of liability insurance.
They correctly argue that the liability-insurance crisis was more likely caused by excessive price competition -- which seems to be recurring now -- rather than oligopolistic price-fixing.

   The commissioners go on to say that elimination of the antitrust exemption will subject the industry to years of uncertainty and instability from costly litigation and conflicting judicial interpretations.
They further contend that repeal ultimately will create a regulatory vacuum into which the federal government will be drawn.

   Finally, the commissioners argue, state laws already provide for enforcement actions against conspiracies to refuse to provide coverage or to set floors on insurance prices.
The position paper concludes that repeal "could have an opposite, deleterious effect, including lessening competition by reducing the number of insurers currently in the market and imposing insurmountable barriers on entry into the industry."

   A 22-company McCarran-Ferguson task force set up by the National Association of Independent Insurers, meanwhile, predicts the industry actually will contract if any of the proposed legislation is passed.

   The industry and its regulators believe they are being punished for the erratic insurance price swings of recent years.
That view is probably correct.
Even the Reagan Justice Department's free marketers have not pressed similar action against antitrust immunities enjoyed by organized labor, agricultural cooperatives and various sports leagues.
But aside from the partly valid concern that repeal of McCarran-Ferguson could create an onslaught of litigation, it is far from clear that enough force is left in the act as it now stands to warrant even worrying about it.

   James Stone, president of the Plymouth Rock Assurance Corp. and former Massachusetts insurance commissioner, says that if the act is ever repealed or amended, he would view that as "symbolic."
He predicts that any legislation will provide for exemptions for small companies, exchanges of claims-loss data and preservation of state regulation.
Assistant Attorney General Charles F. Rule has made these prerequisites for any bill the administration could support.

   Furthermore, it is not clear that even fear of a new litigation wave is justified.
McCarran-Ferguson was passed, in large part, to encourage insurance competition by making it possible for small companies to share loss data.
In recent years, however, it has been subjected to steady erosion by the federal courts.

   The antitrust immunity has been severely narrowed by a three-pronged court test that limits the "business of insurance" to those situations involving the contractual relationship with the policyholder, the spreading of risk, and the absence of third parties outside the industry.
Since no industry activity could meet all three tests, the antitrust immunity could be construed away entirely by a holding that insurance activity must meet all three requirements.
Recent applications by the Supreme Court of the antitrust "business of insurance" tests to state law pre-emption questions also raise the question of whether the act can continue to be an effective barrier protecting state regulatory authority.

   Proponents of a greater federal role note that many life-insurance products are already federally regulated by being subject to Securities and Exchange Commission registration.
They argue the industry increasingly is faced with competition from other financial-service businesses that are, at least in part, federally regulated.
Furthermore, it is far from certain that the national and increasingly international scope of the industry can be dealt with adequately by 50 different state regulators.

   On the other hand, those who believe more federal regulation is needed ignore the fact that some federal regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, have demonstrated no more independence or competence in dealing with complex financial issues than have state insurance regulators.
If the insurance industry wants it to be, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners can become an effective regulatory force.
A vastly augmented staff for reporting and auditing would give it the ability to help state insurance departments provide the strong financial monitoring the industry desperately needs.
Federal action is not so much dangerous as unnecessary and irrelevant.

   The McCarran-Ferguson debate is nearsightedly procedural.
The discussion deals with who will govern rather than how they will.
In an environment where state legislatures are considering measures that would put the insurance industry into an economic and legal straitjacket, that is a debate the industry can ill-afford.

   Federal Trade Commission Chairman Daniel Oliver's call for repealing the insurance industry's longstanding exemption from federal antitrust laws signals tougher Reagan administration oversight of insurance companies.

   The Justice Department also has decided to endorse -- or at least not try to block -- such legislation, according to administration officials and a draft version of testimony to be presented to a Senate Judiciary subcommittee tomorrow.

   The moves will provide a boost for legislation repealing the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which exempts the industry from most federal antitrust regulation.

   Such legislation already enjoys widespread support on Capitol Hill because it offers lawmakers a way to show they are trying to solve the problems of high insurance premiums and difficulty in obtaining certain kinds of liability coverage.

   In the past, Reagan administration officials have toyed with the idea of supporting such legislation as part of a strategy to make comprehensive overhaul of liability laws more appealing to consumer groups and lawmakers.
But now, the administration for the first time appears willing to end its support for McCarran-Ferguson and work with proponents seeking to repeal it.

   "I ask you to join me in seeking repeal" of the exemption, Mr. Oliver told a consumer-group conference Friday.
"Let's remove the industry's special protection," he said, and "remove the blinders Congress placed on the FTC so we can look" at potential antitrust problems.

   Although Mr. Oliver's comments weren't specifically cleared by the White House, commission officials said the remarks indicated the administration is taking a more flexible position.

   A number of House and Senate Democratic leaders support repeal of McCarran-Ferguson, and consumer groups also are pushing the legislation.

   Industry spokesmen and Justice Department officials have argued that affordability and availability problems won't be eased by ending or scaling back antitrust exemptions.
But Congress isn't likely to go along with a more sweeping White House-backed proposal limiting damage awards.

   For example, Sen. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has said he intends to hold hearings this year to try to draft a "more balanced bill" that will provide better protection to consumers than the administration's proposal.
"We should look at the issue more carefully," Sen. Biden said in a recent interview.
"But I'm doubtful of resolving it.
It's such a contentious, deeply divisive issue."

   The insurance industry is so protected by a
federal antitrust exemption that a few executives are able to
exercise immense control over rates and who should receive
liability insurance, the Texas attorney general told a Senate panel.
   ``The leaders of the property and casualty insurance industry
meet constantly to discuss their profits, their losses and their
objectives for the future,'' Jim Mattox told the Senate antitrust
committee on Tuesday.
   ``They sit aroud the table in the board rooms of ISO (Insurance
Services Office) and they do what no other industry can do - by
meeting together, talking together, planning together, strategizing
together - and I might say, conspiring together,'' he said.
   Mattox and his counterparts in New York and Massachusetts are
urging Congress to strip the insurance industry of its antitrust
exemption.
   Robert Abrams of New York, president-elect of the National
Association of Attorneys General, said Congress ``should repeal the
anomalous and anachronistic McCarran-Ferguson Act, thereby
requiring the insurance industry to operate within the same basic
competitive framework which has served American business and
consumers so well.''
   The McCarran-Ferguson Act, passed in 1945, grants the antitrust
exemption. A number of states have filed suit alleging that dozens
of insurance companies conspired under the exemption to create the
liability insurance crisis of 1985-86, which made coverage
unavailable or too costly for many governments and businesses.
   Mattox, Abrams and James A. Shannon of Massachusetts also called
for the replacement of the data-gathering function of Insurance
Services Office (ISO), the primary industry rate and trade advisory
organization, with the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic
Analysis or another existing federal agency.
   They also recommended the establishment of strong American
reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance markets in an effort to
halt the flow of money overseas where, they said, almost all the
reinsurance companies are located.
   Reinsurance is insurance purchased by insurers to help pay
claims that they in turn must pay. Similarly, retrocessional
coverage is insurance for reinsurers.
   Craig A. Berrington, general counsel of the American Insurance
Association which represents 183 property-casualty companies, said
there is no need to repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act because state
insurance agencies have the tools to regulate the industry in their
states.
   He said the lawsuits raise ``important public policy questions
about the role of state regulation of insurance, the true causes of
the liability crisis and the extent of competition in the insurance
business.''

   Fire still smoldered today at a 400-foot
crater in the ruins of a rocket fuel plant destroyed by
earthquake-force explosions that flattened an industrial park,
leaving one person dead, one missing and injuring more than 250.
   ``This thing could have been much worse. ... We may have a
miracle on our hands here,'' Gov. Richard Bryan said late Wednesday
after blasts shattered windows 10 miles away in Las Vegas and
tweaked seismographs 200 miles away.
   The detonations destroyed or severely damaged 12 buildings at
the site of the Pacific Engineering and Production Co. of Nevada
plant and an adjoining marshmallow factory.
   The blasts _ at least three powerful concussions and a string of
lesser explosions _ peeled off roofs, upended cars and even rocked
a jetliner in flight. More than 250 people were injured, four
critically, most from flying glass.
   The tattered body found in the ruins was identified today as
Bruce Bernard Halker, 56, vice president of operations at Pacific
Engineering. A search continued for another possible victim.
   ``We have a missing person but we're not sure what it is. Maybe
the person just left and hasn't contacted anyone,'' said Clark
County Deputy Fire Chief John Pappageorge.
   Bryan said he was declaring the blast zone and its environs a
state disaster area, and would seek federal disaster relief for
this southern Nevada desert community of 54,000.
   ``All the windows are smashed in and the roofs are peeled
back,'' the governor said. ``In one shopping center, all the glass
is blown out and the top part of the building caved in. The force
had to be enormous.''
   This morning fire still smoldered at the ruined plant, said
Pappageorge, but it was not threatening or causing firefighters any
problems. The blasts left a crater 400 feet across.
   ``Right now there are no fumes that are emitting from the ruins
that we're aware of,'' Pappageorge said on the CBS ``This Morning''
program. ``The last measurement that was taken, the particles were
measured at zero.''
   He said of the low death toll: ``Unbelievable would be the word.
As my first thoughts when I arrived out there was there would
probably be several hundred. But it's remarkable there was only
one.''
   The explosions also spewed a 5-square-mile plume of toxic smoke
into the sky, but winds carried the cloud away from populated areas
and it eventually dissipated. By nightfall, evacuated residents
were back at home.
   Pacific is one of two manufacturers of ammonium perchlorate, an
oxidizer in fuel for the space shuttle's solid rocket boosters and
the Minuteman and Titan missiles. The other is Kerr-McGee, also
near Las Vegas.
   The explosions and fire were caused by an equipment malfunction,
said Pacific president Fred Gibson Jr. No monetary estimate of the
damage was available.
   The first explosion at 11:53 a.m. measured about 3.0 on the
Richter scale and the second at 11:57 a.m. had a magnitude 3.5,
said Bob Finn, spokesman for the California Institute of
Technology, 200 miles away in Pasadena.
   ``I find that absolutely amazing. That is extremely powerful,''
said Finn.
   ``It flipped cars over, knocked pedestrians to the ground and
windows in the whole town shattered,'' said Susan Russo, 37, of
Henderson, who was in her pickup truck when the blasts occurred.
   ``It felt like somebody sent me back to Vietnam,'' said Rick
Rieckmann, 41, a maintenance welder who was one of four plant
workers hurled through a wall in the first blast.
   ``It blew us out of the building. It sent us through a
fiberglass wall and into the desert,'' Rieckmann said. None of the
four was seriously hurt.
   Gamblers briefly abandoned gaming tables at several casinos on
the outskirts of Las Vegas, but ducked back inside after it was
clear the danger had passed.
   A Las Vegas-bound jetliner approaching McCarran International
Airport was rattled by the blasts, said America West passenger John
Conrad, 62, of Westlake Village, Calif.
   ``We felt a little jolt. The second explosion looked like a
mini-atomic bomb,'' he said. ``There was a tall column of smoke
going up 20,000 feet.''
   The Pacific plant employed about 300 workers, and about 200 of
them on duty Wednesday fled seconds before the first blast, Fire
Chief Roy Parrish said.
   ``Employees tried to put the fire out but it got out of control.
... Most of the employees had exited the building or were in the
foothills when the first explosion occurred. Seconds later, there
was a second explosion that completely demolished the building,''
Parrish said.
   Kidd &amp; Co., based in Ligonier, Ind., expanded to the Gibson
Business Park and opened its 36,500-square-foot marshmallow plant
about two years ago. It employed 85 people, but only 25 to 35 were
on duty at the time of the blast.

   America West Airlines June Traffic
   Rose 30% on Half-Price Ticket Sales

   America West Airlines said its June traffic soared 30%,
but the financially troubled airline attributed the increase
largely to half-price ticket promotions earlier in the year.
   Those 50% fares will end up costing the carrier money
because so many of them are being redeemed during the
industry's busy summer travel season. America West filed for
Chapter 11 protection two weeks ago because of a massive cash
drain.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Phoenix, Ariz., carrier is widely expected to report a
loss for the second quarter, even though traffic for the
quarter was also up by about 30%. The consensus of Wall
Street analysts as of Monday put the airline's second-quarter
loss at 50 cents a share, versus last year's profit of 29
cents a share.
   America West said June traffic rose to 1.22 billion
revenue passenger miles from 936.3 million last year. A
revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one
mile, the principal measure of airline business. Load factor,
or the percentage of seats filled, jumped to 70.4% from 63.7%
a year ago.
   Cut-rate fares offered throughout the industry have lured
fliers back into airplane seats, but not in enough numbers to
offset the cost of the heavy discounts. America West's
promotional fares, which generated $140 million in cash
according to the carrier's bankruptcy filing, were more
heavily discounted and had fewer restrictions than those
offered by other airlines.
   The carrier said it expects similarly high traffic levels
for the rest of the summer. In the days immediately after
America West filed for Chapter 11 last month, the airline
said its load factor exceeded 75%, a particularly high
number. "We are seeing similar patterns in early July," said
Mark Coleman, the airline's senior vice president of market
planning.
   That's good and bad news for the airline. In an affidavit
filed along with its bankruptcy filing, America West
President Michael Conway complained that the 50% passengers
"are not generating any fresh revenues for America West." The
airline anticipates that substantially all those passengers
will have used their tickets by this fall.
   Although America West has said it plans to cut costs and
has announced new routes and a pay freeze, it hasn't yet made
public the kind of deep cost-cutting plans it will need once
summer travel drops off after Labor Day.
   The airline is apparently stepping up its efforts to
conserve cash. America West has been negotiating with
representatives of its two hub airports to string out July
rent payments.
   A spokesman for McCarran International Airport in Las
Vegas said America West is in default of a $1.5 million lease
payment due July 1, and is likely to default on a separate
$500,000 payment due July 15. The airport board intends to
meet July 16 to consider America West's request for a 30-day
extension on the payments. At Phoenix Sky Harbor airport,
America West and airport officials said the company made a
$500,000 payment and is in negotiations for the remainder of
the $1.8 million July rent, which was due yesterday.
   America West said the negotiations are moving along
satisfactorily.
   In a statement, America West said the airline is
negotiating to "reaffirm its airport obligations." The
negotiations are moving along satisfactorily, the statement
said.
   For the first six months of 1991, America West's traffic
was up 25.5%, to 6.64 billion revenue passenger miles from
5.29 billion. The year-to-date load factor rose to 66% from
62.2%.

   Cars were sent careening off highways,
windows shattered and a jetliner was jolted in the air by the chain
of atomic bomb-like blasts that tore through a rocket fuel plant
here.
   ``I was sitting in a booth eating pizza and the windows blew
out,'' Officer Michael Peterson of the Nevada Highway Patrol said
Wednesday, after the explosions erupted from the industrial park 10
miles from Las Vegas.
   ``We thought the whole building was going down,'' he said.
``Everybody took off right away.''
   Cars traveling on Highway 148 were knocked off the road by the
concussion, and motorists were injured, said Capt. Terry Edwards of
the Clark County Fire Department.
   ``People in their vehicles on this road were injured and their
cars were damaged,'' he said. ``They just went off the road and
wrecked.''
   Authorities said more than 250 people were injured and one
person was killed by the explosions, which struck just before noon
Wednesday at the plant that manufactures ingredients for space
shuttle rocket fuel.
   The blasts, which made gamblers briefly flee at least one
casino, were recorded by seismographs at California Institute of
Technology in Pasadena, 200 miles away.
   ``It flipped cars over, knocked pedestrians to the ground, and
windows in the whole town shattered,'' said Susan Russo, 37, a
Henderson resident who was in her pickup truck at the time of the
blasts.
   Gaming tables were briefly abandoned at Sam's Town on Boulder
Highway, but 15 minutes later it appeared there was no danger and
hundreds of gamblers went back inside, said resort spokeswoman
Shelley Roberts.
   A Las Vegas-bound America West jetliner approaching McCarran
International Airport was rocked by the blasts, said passenger John
Conrad, 62, of Westlake Village, Calif.
   ``We felt a little jolt. The second explosion looked like a
mini-atomic bomb,'' he said. ``There was a tall column of smoke
going up 20,000 feet.''
   There were no injuries aboard Flight 46, which originated in
Burbank, Calif.
   ``First we saw these very intense, hot flames. It didn't mean
much to us at first. We thought they were burning tires or
something. Then, there was another slight jolt,'' he said.
   Several large windows and sliding glass doors at the airport _
less than 10 miles from the blast site _ were shattered by the
explosion, and some ceiling tiles were knocked loose, said airport
spokesman Roy Clawson.
   Pacific worker Joe Hedrick, 30, said he heard a series of four
explosions over several minutes, with the fourth blast sounding the
most powerful.
   Hendrick, tearful and distraught, with cuts on his arms, said he
an two co-workers were assembling a pollution control device when
they heard a pop and the room filled with smoke.
   ``The smoke was so thick it could choke you. It smelled like
plastic,'' Hedrick said. The pop was followed by a blast that blew
metal and fiberglass wall panels off the building.
   Hedrick said he fled in his truck and was about 2 miles from the
plant when another explosion shattered the windshield.
   ``You've seen pictures of a nuclear detonation with a cloud that
runs across the ground. It looked like that,'' Hedrick said of the
final blast. ``The further we drove it seemed the blasts kept
coming.''
   The plant is in an isolated desert area on the western fringes
of Henderson, southeast of Las Vegas. The industrial complex dates
back to World War II when titanium was processed there.

   Today is ``Tax Freedom Day,'' the day the
average American taxpayer finishes paying off taxes.
   The Tax Foundation calculates the average American will have to
work 124 days this year _ the same as in 1987 and 1988 _ just to
pay federal, state and local taxes. Today is the 124th day of the
year.
   Tax Freedom Day has never fallen later in the year. This year's
date is also the same as in 1981, before President Reagan and
Congress agreed on a 23-percent across-the-board cut in individual
income tax rates.
   Economists for the foundation, a nonpartisan Washington research
group, say the value of that tax cut has been offset by more than a
dozen subsequent federal tax increases and by higher state and
local taxes caused partially by cuts in federal programs.

<NOTE>First Grant Given to Town Near Base That Will Be Closed</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The town of Rantoul, Ill., is receiving the
first federal planning grant to help cope with the upcoming round
of military base closings.
   The Defense Department said Wednesday that the community next to
the Chanute Air Force Base will receive $73,045 ``to help organize
a base reuse committee to start planning the civilian conversion of
the base property.''
   In addition to the federal money, Rantoul is contributing money
and services worth $11,300 and the state of Illinois $10,000 to
support the effort.
   The grant to Rantoul is the first since Congress approved a long
list of base closings last month under a special procedure set up
last year. Chanute Air Force Base is one of 86 bases now set for
closure under the program, which was prompted primarily by budget
concerns.

<LEADPARA>  Insurers and attorneys general from 19 states squared off Friday in the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to determine the scope of
federal antitrust exemptions afforded to insurance companies.;    At issue was
whether 32 insurers -- including Aetna Life &amp; Casualty, Hartford Insurance and
Lloyd's of London -- could effectively force the rest of the industry to
restrict certain types of coverage by virtue of antitrust exemptions under the
McCarran-Ferguson Act.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ARE ANTITRUST RULES FOR INSURERS TOO LENIENT?
COURT TO WEIGH SCOPE OF EXEMPTIONS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Normally, collusive activity in industry is barred by federal law. But
insurers operate under special rules that allow them to share forms and
price-setting information provided they do not take part in a market boycott
or force compliance through coercion or intimidation.;    In this case,
several states and about two dozen private companies alleged that insurers had
conspired to limit liability coverage in the mid-1980s by changing policy
forms that were commonly used in the industry.;    Although insurers deny the
allegations, Friday's arguments did not deal with the merits of this
individual case. Instead, three appellate judges were asked to determine how
broadly the McCarran-Ferguson exemptions should be interpreted. They also were
asked to decide whether U.S. laws could be used to restrict the activity of
foreign insurers, such as Lloyd's of London.;    Attorneys from both sides
expressed confidence on the final outcome of the case, but they stressed that
the issue was not likely to be completely resolved soon. The justices have an
indefinite amount of time to decide the case, and attorneys said they expect
that the loser will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.;    "This is years away
from resolution," said Thomas Greene, supervising deputy attorney general in
California's antitrust division.;    The case, which was originally filed in
1988, was spurred by the mayor of Lafayette, who complained that he was unable
to find liability coverage for the small Northern California town in 1985,
Greene said.;    The California attorney general's office began a two-year
investigation and determined that Hartford Insurance, in an attempt to limit
its own risk, illegally persuaded other major players in the industry to
shrink the scope of liability coverage in the mid-1980s. That allegedly led to
a nationwide insurance crisis, in which companies and cities found they could
not get adequate protection for certain risks at a reasonable cost.;    The
California attorney general filed suit. About 18 other states and several
private companies joined in while the case bounced through the court system.;
  Friday's hearing was to overturn a ruling by U.S. District Judge William
Schwarzer that said the insurers could not be prosecuted for the alleged
conspiracy because they were protected by McCarran-Ferguson.  </TEXT>

   WASHINGTON -- The House Judiciary Committee approved
legislation that would narrow the insurance industry's
antitrust exemption. The move sends the measure to the House
floor for a vote as early as February.
   The bill, approved 19-14, would do away with the
industry's most prized possession, its broad exemption from
federal antitrust strictures granted under a 46-year-old law
known as the McCarran-Ferguson Act. Consumer groups contend
that the law, which allows insurance companies to share
actuarial information, also lets them fix prices and shield
themselves from antitrust suit.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Similar to a bill the committee approved last year, it
would prevent the insurance industry from fixing prices,
monopolizing markets or engaging in other anticompetitive
behavior.
   Consumer lobbyists predicted that the bill would be
considered by the full House in February, and shortly after
that by the Senate. "This is the year of the insurance
consumer," said Linda Lipsen, legislative counsel for
Consumers Union, which pushed for the bill.
   Defenders of the industry said the bill could make
insurers less stable financially and could actually impose
tougher antitrust rules on insurers than on other industries.
"They will have less actuarial information," said Rep.
Hamilton Fish of New York, the committee's senior Republican.
"We are affecting the accuracy of the decisions that they
make."
   The antitrust exemption is particularly critical to
property and casualty insurers. The American Insurance
Association, which represents 254 large property-casualty
companies, broke with the industry earlier this year, to try
to negotiate a version of the bill that the industry finds
less onerous. David Pratt, the group's lobbyist, held out
hope that a compromise might still be struck before the House
takes up the bill. "The heartening thing for us is that we do
have time," he said.
   But Rep. Jack Brooks (D., Texas), chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, sounded resolute about passage. "This is
the bill that the insurance industry loved when it was
offered as an alternative to the repeal of the
McCarran-Ferguson law," he said. "There is always the clear,
straightforward alternative: simply repeal
McCarran-Ferguson."
   An outright repeal of the law would be worse, insurers
say. It would subject the industry to Federal Trade
Commission consumer provisions, as well as antitrust law.
Insurance advertising, for example, could fall under FTC
scrutiny, which is barred now. Relationships between
insurance companies and insurance agents that spell out the
sorts of products that agents may sell could be regulated, as
well.
   The bill includes an amendment backed by Rep. Dan Glickman
(D., Kansas) that would allow some small and medium-size
companies to continue to share some actuarial information.
"These small companies fill gaps in the market," Rep.
Glickman said. The amendment, he said, would make it less
likely that they would be merged or consolidated out of
existence.
   At least two similar bills have been introduced in the
Senate, but action isn't expected until after the House
finishes its work on the measure.

<HEAD>On-Time Record Improves In January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southwest Airlines had the best record while
Eastern Airlines and Northwest Airlines shared the burden of having
the poorest on-time performance in January, according to the
monthly government statistics on flight delays.
   The Transportation Department figures released Wednesday showed
about three out of every ten flights arrived at least 15 minutes
late during the month, slightly fewer than in December.
   Southwest, which consistently has been among the best on-time
performers, had 85 percent of its flights arrive on time during
January, followed by America West and Pacific Southwest Airlines,
both of which had a better than 80 percent on-time performance.
   Eastern airlines had the worst record, with 61.5 percent of its
flights arriving on time, followed close behind by Northwest's 61.6
percent. Piedmont Airlines, which also had the highest baggage
complaint rate during the month, was third from the bottom with a
62.4 percent on-time record.
   Overall the 14 airlines that are monitored in the monthly report
had 69.2 percent of their flights arriving within 15 minutes of
schedule, compared with 66.4 percent in December.
   The government considers a flight to be on time if it arrives
within 15 minutes of schedule. The 14 airlines that are required to
submit monthly on-time statistics are not required to report delays
attributed to mechanical problems. Delays due to weather are
counted.
   During January, there were 148 chronically late flights, meaning
they were late at least 80 percent of the time. Four of those
flights _ two for Continental and one each for Northwest and Delta
Airlines _ were late each time the planes flew.
   Meanwhile, consumer complaints to the Transportation Department
dropped sharply in February, compared with the previous month, but
still were higher than the number recorded in February 1987, the
department said.
   The complaint statistics are released with the on-time
performance statistics, although they cover different months.
   There were 2,235 complaints received by the department's
consumer affairs office about airline service during February,
compared with 3,610 in January, a decline of 38 percent. The
department received 1,574 such complaints in February 1987.
   The three airlines that had the most complaints lodged against
them in the two previous months _ Continental, Eastern and
Northwest _ led the list again in February. There were 14.79
complaints per 100,000 passengers involving Continental, 11.3
complaints involving Eastern and 10.64 complaints involving
Northwest, the deparment said.
   After Southwest, the airlines with the best on-time performance
in January were America West, which also was No. 2 in December, and
Pacific Southwest Airlines, which soared from last among the 14
airlines in December to having the third best record in January.
   America West had 83.9 percent of its flights arrive on time in
January while Pacific Southwest improved its record from 57.6 in
December to 81.6 in January. American Airlines (75.7 percent) had
the best record among the larger carriers, but Pan American World
Airways dropped from having the second best record in December to
seventh in January.
   The best arrival rate among the 27 airports from which reporting
is required came at Las Vegas' McCarran International Airport and
the Phoenix Sky Harbor airport with just over 78 percent of the
flights arriving on time. The worst arrival rate, 59.1 percent, was
reported at Orlando International Airport in Florida.
   During January, the number of baggage complaints received by the
airlines remained virtually the same as the previous month with
11.58 complaints per 1,000 passengers flown. Piedmont Airlines had
just over 18 such complaints, the most of any of the airlines,
while Southwest had the least at 4.65.

</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Las Vegas Sun publisher Hank Greenspun, who built a communications empire and
helped transform Las Vegas from a small desert town into an entertainment
mecca, died Saturday of cancer. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
Greenspun died at his home in Regency Towers at the exclusive Las Vegas Country
Club after a yearlong battle with the disease.
</P>
<P>
He was a man of contrast, reckless and reasoning, combative and compassionate,
a news writer and a news maker.
</P>
<P>
The New York-educated lawyer was a decorated World War II combat officer, a
one-time publicist for mobster Benjamin (Bugsy) Siegel's Flamingo Hotel, a
pioneer real estate investor and developer, and a crusading newspaper
publisher.
</P>
<P>
Greenspun founded Las Vegas' first television station, first competing daily
newspaper and first cable television company.
</P>
<P>
A man of action and influence who once was a Republican candidate for governor
of Nevada, Greenspun mingled with world leaders and superstars.
</P>
<P>
He played a behind-the-scenes role in Middle East affairs for Israel, where he
became a national hero, cited by then-Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion for
extraordinary service during the 1948 War of Independence.
</P>
<P>
Greenspun executed a daring gun-smuggling operation that delivered surplus U.S.
arms to Israel during its struggle. He was convicted of Neutrality Act
violations in 1950 and fined $10,000, but President John F. Kennedy pardoned
him, and in his 1966 autobiography, "Where I Stand," Greenspun said it was "the
proudest thing I've ever done."
</P>
<P>
He hobnobbed with celebrities and attended the wedding of Frank Sinatra and Mia
Farrow when the rest of the news media was shut out.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Friend of Howard Hughes
</P>
<P>
His friendship with Howard Hughes led to the billionaire's move to Las Vegas in
1966 on Greenspun's invitation. Hughes bailed the city out of a recession,
whitewashed its mobster reputation and bought more than $100 million in hotels
and land.
</P>
<P>
Articulate, dynamic and fearless, Greenspun was a favorite interview subject
for the national media in search of Las Vegas exposes and often appeared on
network television.
</P>
<P>
His widely read front-page column, "Where I Stand," which he pounded out on a
battered Underwood typewriter, was feared and loved, ruthless and
heart-rending.
</P>
<P>
He both attacked and defended politicians, suspected mobsters, the federal
government, organized labor, judges, lawmakers and citizens as he played a
major role in shaping the skyline, reputation and policy of Las Vegas as it
grew from a small desert town into the state's largest city and a worldwide
tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Showed Compassion
</P>
<P>
Greenspun never backed away from a good fight, whether the foe was a powerful
politician, law enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service or a business mogul.
He was compassionate toward the disadvantaged and downtrodden, employing many
handicapped people, supporting local charities and doling out toys from a
closet in his office to children who stopped in off the street.
</P>
<P>
His battle scars were numerous. He triumphed over an advertising boycott of his
newspaper instigated by U.S. Sen. Pat McCarran, and when Sen. Joseph R.
McCarthy publicly denounced him as an "ex-communist," Greenspun turned the
tables and accused McCarthy of being a Nazi sympathizer with communist
leanings.
</P>
<P>
During the 1972 Watergate scandal, burglars broke into Greenspun's office at
the Las Vegas Sun and tried to open his safe. The publisher believed the
intruders were White House "plumbers" seeking documents he possessed relating
to a $100,000 contribution from Hughes to President Richard M. Nixon to lift a
Justice Department order blocking the tycoon from buying any more Las Vegas
hotels.
</P>
<P>
E. Howard Hunt later testified that he and G. Gordon Liddy had, indeed, planned
a burglary of Greenspun's safe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Defends Claiborne
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1980s, the Sun boldly defended Nevada federal Judge Harry Claiborne
throughout the investigation and trials that led to Claiborne's historic ouster
from the bench.
</P>
<P>
Born Herman Milton Greenspun in Brooklyn, N.Y., Aug. 27, 1909, Greenspun
graduated from St. John's School of Law and aspired to be a trial lawyer but
changed his mind after a client admitted stabbing a man to death, saying he
could not defend such people.
</P>
<P>
Greenspun fought in France as a captain in General George S. Patton's 3rd Army.
He was awarded the Croix de Guerre with silver star, Conspicuous Service Cross
for the State of New York, four battle stars and a commendation from Gen.
Dwight D. Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife, Barbara; sons, Brian and Danny; daughters Janie
Gale and Susan Fine; a brother, David; a sister, Alice Goldberg, and nine
grandchildren, all of Las Vegas.

<LEADPARA>  Insurers, which have long contended their industry is exempt from antitrust
law, can be sued for certain price-fixing activities, a federal appeals court
ruled Tuesday. Ruling in a case brought by California and 18 other states
against 32 U.S. and foreign insurance companies, the U.S. Court of Appeals in
San Francisco found that a lower court had erred in dismissing the case. The
lower court had ruled largely on the grounds that the insurers were exempt
from antitrust suits under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which Congress passed in
1945. The act provided what had been considered sweeping exemptions to the
insurance industry from antitrust law. Lawyers for the states and other legal
experts said the ruling marked a significant change in the way the courts have
interpreted the McCarran Act's key provisions.  </LEADPARA>

   Witnesses urged Congress on Wednesday to lift
restrictions that allow the government to keep foreigners out of
the United States because of their ideological beliefs.
   Under the McCarran-Walter immigration law, foreigners may be
kept out for ideological reasons. Other laws allow the federal
government to restrict foreign travel by Americans through limits
on the way the dollar can be spent.
   Novelist Larry McMurtry told the House Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on courts, intellectual property and the
administration of justice that if the McCarran-Walter act
``abridges the rights of Americans to engage in face-to-face
discussions and debate with foreign colleagues.''
   Choichiro Yatani, a Japanese who teaches psychology in the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, said he was jailed for 44
days and threatened with deportation over suspicions he was a
communist. He said his status in the country ``remains tenuous and
my name remains on the immigration `lookout list.' ''
   A bill by Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., would allow foreigners to
visit the United States regardless of their ideas or what they
might say here.
   The Justice Department has told Frank in a letter that it wants
to keep the authority to prevent the entry of foreigners it
considers undesirable.
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., has introduced a bill to end the
currency restrictions that have been used to limit travel by
Americans. He noted that as Americans do not spend their own money,
they are free to travel to Cuba.
   ``This means that Americans can and do travel to Cuba as guests
of a Cuban government eager to present a positive image of life in
Cuba. I find it highly compromising for Americans to be able to
travel to Cuba only on Castro's tab,'' Berman said.
   Loren F. Ghiglione, president of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, criticized Vice President Dan Quayle and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III for the administration's
refusal to admit Cuba's Fidel Castro and Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega
to address the society's meeting last month.
   Quayle had suggested that Ortega could have been interviewed in
Nicaragua.
   ``If I as the editor of a 7,000 circulation newspaper may be
permitted a somewhat personal response to the vice president's
suggestion, I would remind the committee that the U.S. press is
unlike that of any other nations,'' Ghiglione said in prepared
testimony.
   `It is essentially local-provincial, not national. Half the
country's dailies have a circulation of 20,000 or less. While I and
other small-town editors have made reporting trips to Nicaragua,
the Middle East, southern Africa and other newsworthy parts of the
world, we do not have the resources or clout to travel to Nicaragua
and interview Mr. Ortega on a regular basis.''
   Ghiglione said Americans are hindered in criticizing censorship
elsewhere by what he called ``oppressive and restrictive censorial
authority ... within the United States.''
   Baker, in defending the decision to keep Castro and Ortega from
speaking to the ASNE meeting, said he did not believe the decision
amounted to censorship. He said the government was exercising ``a
certain amount of discretion'' in not issuing visas for the two
Marxist leaders.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ When Hollywood producers take their cameras to
Nevada, as they are doing more and more these days, they rely on a
former New York model to pave the way and round up a cast of
extras. She's Christine O'Rourke, who operates the only movie
location management company in the state.

   It takes a lot of chutzpah to close down
a busy section of Interstate 15, orchestrate a simulated shootout
in a crowded airport lobby, or fake the firebombing of a casino on
the Las Vegas Strip.
   But for a former New York model, such challenges have become
routine.
   Christine O'Rourke, who saw dreams of a modeling career derailed
19 years ago, now runs the only licensed movie casting and location
management company in Nevada.
   In that role, she finds her ingenuity tested almost daily by
Hollywood producers, taking part in the production of films such as
``Rain Man,'' which won the Oscar as the best picture of 1988,
``Midnight Run,'' ``Heat,'' ``Starman'' and the television series
``Crime Story.''
   Her toughest assignment was setting up a scene in which a casino
was firebombed _ a near impossible feat in a city where gaming
executives are skittish about even having photographs taken in
their establishments.
   The firebombing was shot for one of the episodes of the TV
series ``Crime Story.''
   ``We had to clear everything through security, deal with fire
codes, get clearance of city and county officials, etc.,'' O'Rourke
recalls, sitting in an office lined with autographed photos of
stars with whom she's worked. ``We had to practice the scene, then
shut down the entire casino operation to make it work.''
   Another scene involved tossing a Molotov cocktail in a
restaurant.
   ``It takes a lot of finesse to get an owner to let you do
something like that,'' she says, laughing.
   She found herself enlisting the aid of the governor's office in
closing a section of I-15, the main artery between Las Vegas and
Los Angeles, to film a scene for ``Starman.''
   On other occasions, has cleared a mountain of legal and public
relations problems to close down sections of the Las Vegas Strip
and downtown's Glitter Gulch.
   ``You've got to get the approval of every casino owner who's
affected,'' she explains. ``You've got to go to all the property
owners, even the guy who runs the hot dog stand and the owner of
the pawnshop. If just one of them says no, it's my job to convince
them it would be good for them.''
   O'Rourke handled the Nevada locations and casting of extras for
``Rain Man.''
   But she found ``Midnight Run'' one of her toughest challenges,
especially a scene filmed at McCarran International Airport in Las
Vegas.
   ``These people were sticklers for realism,'' she recalls. ``They
wanted real cops, real FBI agents. They said, `If you can't get us
real cops and FBI men, we'll find someone who can.'''
   O'Rourke found herself calling powerful Clark County Sheriff
John Moran in the pre-dawn hours one day to enlist his aid in the
search for extras. She delivered, and the airport scene, involving
400 extras, was one of the more dramatic segments of the hit film.
   The airport scene was not without its problems.
   She blocked off the ticketing counters at the busy facility,
filming overnight when traffic was lightest.
   ``We had signs up to indicate we were filming, but it still
caused a scene when someone shouted, `Look out, he's got a gun,'
and everyone started pulling guns,'' she says.
   Martin Sheen needed soldiers in his upcoming movie
``Nightbreaker.'' The extras were to portray American servicemen
used in atmospheric nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site in the
1950s. Veterans have contended they were subjected to radioactive
fallout from the testing, a charge denied by the government.
   The sensitive nature of the film ruled out government agencies
as a source for the extras. So O'Rourke recruited high school and
college ROTC students to provide the needed manpower.
   She enlisted the aid of the principal at her children's
elementary school when a producer wanted two Eskimo kids, a
Russian-looking youngster, and a 10-year-old Mr. T look-alike.
   The heady world of Hollywood was something of a natural
progression for O'Rourke, 38, who began modeling in her hometown of
San Jose, Calif. at the age of 15. She headed for New York City two
years later, modeling for magazines such as ``Seventeen.''
   That career came to a halt when she married at the age of 19. A
divorce, then a move to Las Vegas nine years ago found her
searching for a new career while trying to support her children,
Patrick, 13, and Tara, 12.
   She started Spectrum Services, her location and casting company,
on less than $100.
   The use of Nevada locations in filming motion pictures is
growing annually, with direct film revenues to the state topping
$50 million last year _ 10 times the revenues generated five years
ago.
   Much of Nevada's recent success in wooing Hollywood producers
can be attributed to Robert Hirsch and his state Motion Picture
Division.
   Las Vegas offers many attractive features for filmmakers,
O'Rourke says.
   ``This is a 24-hour town,'' she says. ``You can film anytime of
the day or night. There's a lot of lore and history. It's an
attractive area.
   ``And Nevada is something of a last frontier. It's the last
state where you can come in and do a tremendous amount of things
without a lot of red tape.''

ANAHEIM-LAS VEGAS HIGH-SPEED TRAIN LINE FACES DELAY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The proposed Anaheim-Las Vegas high-speed magnetic levitation train line will
be subject to delays that will put off its completion at least two more years,
to 1999, it was revealed here this week.
</P>
<P>
But that was not all the unsettling news delivered at a meeting of the
California-Nevada Super Speed Train Commission.
</P>
<P>
As representatives of Bechtel Corp., which was designated in August as the
franchisee to build the project, addressed the commission, it became clear that
many of the line's specifications -- including routes, stops and ridership --
are far from complete.
</P>
<P>
Bechtel's project manager, Tom A. Marlow II, also revealed that German
certification of the maglev technology to be used will not occur until April or
May. It had been expected last September.
</P>
<P>
Marlow said that German transportation firms involved in testing the maglev
train developed by the Trans-Rapid International scientific group have been
distracted by German reunification and by ambitious plans for a $58-billion
modernization of the railroads in the former East Germany. Consequently, they
have put off meetings with Bechtel until early next year.
</P>
<P>
Magnetic levitation uses electromagnetic force to lift trains above a fixed
guideway and propel them at speeds up to 300 m.p.h. The technology has been
slow in coming on line, and there are suggestions that the force levels may
raise health concerns.
</P>
<P>
Although Marlow and other Bechtel officials emphasized their company's
dedication to the Anaheim-Las Vegas project, they said that, in addition to the
technology, many key operational details will not be settled until the end of
1992.
</P>
<P>
Marlow said that the final route of the proposed line has not been determined.
While the train will stop in Anaheim, it may continue to other Southern
California points to connect with other transportation systems or to attract
investors.
</P>
<P>
He said the same is true with the site of the Las Vegas terminus. Clark County
supervisors have sought to locate the train station in Las Vegas near McCarran
International Airport, off the Strip. But Marlow said it may be better to
terminate the route at a downtown station.
</P>
<P>
Marlow explained that Bechtel is also closely watching plans for a commuter
rail network in five Southern California urban counties. Officials hope to
begin operating it by the end of 1992.
</P>
<P>
"Inter-modal links for our trains are very important," said Marlow. "They will
impact our business substantially. We've got to find some investors, and they
will want to know, first of all, that the riders will be there."
</P>
<P>
Bechtel plans to commission an independent ridership study that will examine
alternative routes and show would-be investors that the project is financially
feasible. That should begin next spring, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the outset of Monday's meetings, Marlow alarmed commissioners by telling
them that Bechtel did not wish to enter into a final franchise agreement until
after the completion of all feasibility studies, about two years away.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, he yielded to commission objections to the delay, saying
Bechtel would propose the terms of such an agreement, setting forth its
obligations, by the commission's next meeting, Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
Several commissioners expressed concern that so many details of the project
remain up in the air.
</P>
<P>
"We're still selling the sizzle of this project, but we don't know what the
steak is," said former Ontario Mayor Howard J. Snider.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know the route," he explained. "It has not been identified precisely.
We're talking about new time frames. When people ask us where we're going, what
are we going to say?"
</P>
<P>
Another commissioner, Rolfe G. Arnhym, executive vice president of the Palm
Springs Chamber of Commerce, said he was concerned at the message coming out of
the meeting, which he characterized as one of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
Bechtel's manager of corporate communications, Rick Laubscher, responded that
his company feels that when anyone questions the progress of the project, "Our
answer is going to be, 'Yes, we're moving forward.' "
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Don Roth, an Orange County supervisor who has long been an
optimist about the project, said the delays "put our commission in somewhat of
a precarious position."
</P>
<P>
Roth said the commission may have to seek further public funds to keep itself
going, or perhaps solicit private grants from foundations or businesses other
than Bechtel.

Oakland Athletics right fielder Jose Canseco was briefly detained by police at
McCarran International Airport after reportedly causing a disturbance on a
flight from Los Angeles to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
Police took Canseco aside after he got off the flight late Tuesday night and
questioned him for about 20 minutes before letting him go, said Metropolitan
Police Lt. Ron Fisher.
</P>
<P>
Fisher said the pilot had radioed ahead and alerted police that Canseco was
being unruly with a flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
"Apparently he didn't do some of the things she told him to do, like putting on
his seat belt," he said. "The flight attendant told the officers she had
interpreted some of the things he had said back to her as threats. His side was
that the flight crew was lying about the accusations."
</P>
<P>
Fisher called the incident no big deal and said police stationed at the airport
commonly respond to similar incidents.

   An American Bar Association study panel on
Tuesday recommended federal regulation of the insurance industry.
   The 12-member ABA commission called for repeal of the 43-year-old
McCarran-Ferguson Act, in which Congress generally left insurance
regulation to the states.
   The commission, in a 183-page report, also urged that an agency
with subpoena powers investigate whether improper industry collusion
manipulates insurance availability and cost.
   The commission concluded that some collusion among insurers is
permitted under federal law, and said it was unable to assess
whether improper collusion has occurred.
   The commission's report will be presented to the ABA's
policy-making House of Delegates when it convenes in Denver in
February. The ABA is the nation's largest organization of lawyers.
   George Klotzbaugh, an American Insurance Association attorney,
termed the report's call for repeal of the McCarran-Ferguson Act
``misguided.''
   ``The report professes to support continued regulation by the
states but the changes it recommends ... would dictate to the states
how they have to regulate,'' he said. Klotzbaugh added that federal
antitrust law would become the chief regulatory tool.
   Trial lawyers and the insurance industry have been fighting for
years over who is to blame for the skyrocketing costs of liability
insurance.
   In recent years, numerous states have sued insurers and other
defendants, accusing them of illegally conspiring to limit the
availability of commercial liability insurance.

   (During its centennial year, The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history.)

   PRESIDENT TRUMAN'S LAST OFFICIAL ACT, four days before he left the White House on Jan. 20, 1953, had his usual give-em-hell style.
It angered Democrats, particularly in oil-rich Texas.

   His executive order set aside as a federal petroleum reserve the undersea area up to 150 milles off U.S. coastlines.
The prior May 29, Truman had vetoed a bill that would have given California, Louisiana and Texas title to offshore oil and gas, then reportedly valued at $100 billion.

   Truman had said he wouldn't turn the "vast treasure over to a handful of states, where the powerful private oil interests hope to exploit it to suit themselves."

   The vetoed bill had been sponsored by Sen. Pat McCarran, the renegade Nevada Democrat with whom Truman had fought since his Senate days.
His daughter, Margaret, later wrote that her dad disliked McCarran "both personally and politically."
Another biographer uses the word "despise."

   After Truman left, the oil lobby and offshore oil states resumed their fight and won in 1953 the Submerged Lands Act, which restored to the states underwater oil and gas rights -- but only for distances 3 to 10.5 miles offshore.
President Eisenhower, signing it May 22, said: "I deplore and I will always resist federal encroachment upon the rights . . . of states."
But an act of Aug. 7, 1953 (the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act) kept U.S. ownership of oil-gas assets up to 150 miles beyond those state boundaries.

   Since 1954, the outer shelf properties have produced $189 billion of natural gas and oil, generating $84 billion in revenue to the U.S. Treasury.
There are billions of barrels of oil and trillions of cubic feet of gas down there that remain for drillers.
But both federal and state restrictions on new auctions of offshore leases have been growing since 1981 because of environmental concerns.

<TEXT>
   The State Department has relented and given
permission to one of Vietnam's leading economic policy-makers to
visit the United States, Rep. Chester G. Atkins and the American
Civil Liberties Union said Tuesday.
   Nguyen Xuan Oanh, a member of Vietnam's national assembly and an
advocate of economic liberalization, originally was denied entry
into the United States under a law permitting the State Department
to bar foreigners on grounds of national interest.
   Oanh, 66, a U.S.-trained economist who has held high-ranking
positions in both the U..S.-backed administration in South Vietnam
and the communist government that unified Vietnam in 1975, applied
in March to come to the United States to speak at Harvard and other
universities.
   The department has sought to limit visits by Vietnamese,
particularly those involved in the economy, to keep Vietnam in
economic isolation as long as it maintains an estimated 120,000
troops in neighboring Cambodia. The United States has had no
diplomatic relations with Vietnam since 1975.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the department changed its mind on Oanh because recent legal
rulings prohibit the widespread use of ``national interest'' under
the McCarran-Walter Immigration Act to deny visas.
   Atkins, a Massachusetts Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, said, ``The State Department's original indication that
it would deny him a visa under the misbegotten McCarran-Walter Act
was a mistake, and I am gratified that the administration has
changed its mind.''
   Atkins said Oanh is ``an advocate of moving his country out of
its economic isolation and toward some limited free-market
policies.''
   He and seven other members of Congress said in a letter to
Secretary of State George P. Shultz that despite U.S.
non-recognition of the Vietnamese government ``it is possible and
we believe healthy to understand some of the latest policy
developments there.''
   ``Dr. Oanh is a very sophisticated, highly trained academic who
is likely to take back some very keen insights about the United
States,'' the legislators said. ``Allowing a few tentative steps
toward an academic exchange can only suggest the possibilities that
one day would accrue to Vietnam once impediments to normalization
are resolved.''
   Kate Martin, director of the ACLU's national security litigation
project, said her group was involved on Oanh's behalf with the
State Department legal office.
   The United States has hinged improvements in relations with
Vietnam on withdrawal from Cambodia and the best possible
accounting for the estimated 1,700 Americans still listed as
missing from the Vietnam War.
   The next opportunity for a high-level U.S.-Vietnamese meeting
will come in early June, when Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach
comes to New York to attend a United Nations disarmament conference.
   There were no plans for any U.S. official of equal or near-equal
rank to meet Thach, although a session is expected between Thach
and retired Gen. John W. Vessey, who is President Reagan's special
representative on behalf of the missing U.S. servicemen.

<HL> Ceilings on Phone-Company Earnings
Are Being Chipped Away by Regulators
---
By Johnnie L. Roberts
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 04/21/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>

<TEXT>
   State utility regulators are chipping away at the ceilings that historically have been placed on phone-company earnings.

   Recently, a few states have approved cuts in the price of phone service that will let companies earn more than their allowed rate of return.
As a result, phone-company shareholders could be in for larger rewards than in the past.
At the same time, customers are getting big reductions in their phone bills, and there is the promise of stabilized prices for basic phone service for at least the rest of the decade.

   In New York earlier this month, utility regulators, politicians, consumer groups and Nynex Corp.'s New York Telephone Co. unit were the first to reach such a milestone agreement.
Wisconsin, where an Ameritech unit operates, proposed a similar plan last week.
Another proposal is working its way through the Vermont state legislature.

   The move to this type of agreement began last year in California, when Pacific Telesis Group proposed a plan that would let it earn above its allowed rate and retain some of the excess.
For several reasons, the Pacific Telesis plan was withdrawn, but it could be resubmitted this year.

   Like many other changes in the telephone industry, the new rate plans are partly the result of the rapid evolution of technology and deregulation.
"Most state regulators realize that traditional regulation doesn't work well in the phone industry anymore," says Louise McCarren, chairman of the Vermont Public Service Board.

   The new rate plans are emerging from regulatory reviews of phone-company earnings levels following the adoption of the nation's new tax structure.
The regional Bells are paying a lower tax rate than previously, which is producing an earnings windfall.

   For half a century or longer, regulators have pursued "rate-based" regulation.
Under that approach, they decided what the return on equity should be for the phone companies, and expenses were then estimated.
Regulators then could determine the revenue the phone company needed to collect to earn its allowed rate of return.

   Regulators and academicians "have been talking about alternatives to rate-base regulation for 100 years," says John Bain, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
"The existing process is costly, time consuming and probably not accurate."

   Under the New York plan, phone bills for customers of New York Telephone will fall as much as a total of $700 million for the years through 1990.
The phone company's rate of return remains at 14%.
But it may keep half of any profit that exceeds that level while sharing the other half with customers.
Heretofore, the company might have been ordered to return the full amount to customers.

   After reading of the New York plan, the chairman of the Wisconsin Public Service Commission proposed a similar plan for Wisconsin Bell, an Ameritech unit.
The regulators reduced the allowed rate of return to 13.5% from 14%.
However, the plan allows the phone company to retain all profit it earns up to 13.75%.
It must share 50-50 any profit from 13.75% to 14.5%.
The plan represents "a loosening of some of the strict constraints of rate-base regulation," says Richard Witte, Wisconsin's division staff manager for regulatory affairs.

   Because some phone companies are already earning their allowed rate of return, profit growth has slowed.
So, any opportunity for the companies to exceed the allowed rate could be a boon for shareholders.

   Vermont dubs its alternative the "social contract" approach.
Under the proposed legislative measure, the price of basic local phone service basically would remain stable for a certain period.
Prices of all other services would be deregulated.
The crowning feature is that New England Telephone Co., the Nynex unit that operated in Vermont, won't "have its rate of return constrained at all," says Ms. McCarren of Vermont Public Service.

   She says the approach places the maximum amount of competitive tension on the phone company.
Because there is no regulated ceiling on profit, the company has the incentive to provide new services and products and to operate efficiently.
At the same time, Ms. McCarren adds, the company can no longer count on regulators to rescue it through price increases on basic phone service if its competitive ventures don't pay off.

   Many industry analysts concur that such plans provide an incentive for the phone companies to become more efficient and to offer new products and services.
But some don't believe all state utility regulators will embrace the trend.
Robert Morris III, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., contends the proposals will be restricted to the Northeast and Midwest.

   WASHINGTON -- A House subcommittee approved a bill that
would cut the heart out of the insurance industry's antitrust
exemption.
   The bill was approved, 10-5, by a panel of the House
Judiciary committee, split along party lines, with Democrats
supporting the legislation. Chairman Jack Brooks, (D.,
Texas), said that he expects the committee to complete work
on the bill next week and send it to the full House.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Under the 46-year-old McCarran-Ferguson Act, insurers have
been exempt from antitrust law in order to allow companies to
share actuarial information. But the subcommittee bill would
specifically ban price-fixing, monopolies, tying the purchase
of one insurance product with another, and carving up
competitive territories. The industry would still be allowed
to continue to share data, but it would be barred from
sharing data analysis.
   The Judiciary Committee approved a version of the bill
late last year, but the full House didn't vote on it before
adjourning for the session. "The difference here is that we
are seven months earlier in the process than we were last
year," said Linda Lipsen, a lobbyist for Consumers Union and
an advocate of the bill. "If we can forge ahead, we are
likely to see this on the president's desk."
   Some insurance trade groups, which have vehemently fought
the bill for years, took the unusual step of negotiating with
the committee staff to try to draft a version that the
insurance industry could accept. "The staff reports to me
that considerable progress has been made in these talks, and
I think it would be to everyone's advantage to complete this
effort," said Mr. Brooks.
   Insurance lobbyists said they plan to continue pressing
for changes in the bill. Although the Judiciary Committee may
vote as early as Tuesday, the full House is unlikely to vote
on the matter before February, insurance lobbyists predicted.
   At least two similar bills have been introduced in the
