Perhaps it's a sign of better times in tough old Glasgow that this year's 
biggest uproar was about the past. 
</P>
<P>
Critics attacked an exhibition about the city's 800 years, which stressed its 
relations with the world, for "sanitizing history." 
</P>
<P>
Glasgow's Glasgow, as it was called, closed last month and was the city's 
biggest attraction in 50 years, drawing a half-million visitors. The show may 
have lost more than $8 million in its 30-week run, which the city will have to 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was the centerpiece of the yearlong festival celebrating the 
city's year as the European Capital of Culture, bestowed by culture ministers 
of the 12-nation European Community. 
</P>
<P>
Below the central railway station, unused for 60 years, the show assembled 
3,200 artifacts of Glasgow history, industry and social life. 
</P>
<P>
They ranged from a model of the yacht Shamrock V, with which Glasgow grocery 
tycoon Sir Thomas Lipton made five unsuccessful tries for the America's Cup, to 
the suitcase of an emigrant who paid 2 pounds (then $10) for passage to Canada 
in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Documentary films lauded Glasgow's greatness as the second city of the British 
Empire, an industrial cornucopia that poured out textiles, locomotives, weapons 
and, by 1913, about 60% of the world's ships. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the exhibition was a great success," said Robert Palmer, director of 
the cultural year. "A space which was dripping wet, unusable and derelict was 
renovated, and that space and the new Arches Theater there seem certain to 
become a permanent part of the city's life." 
</P>
<P>
An unusual partnership of business and a socialist council budgeted 50 million 
pounds ($80 million when the year began) to make Cultural Capital 1990 a 
success. About $7 million went for Glasgow's Glasgow. 
</P>
<P>
Sniper fire was aimed at it regularly, however, by the daily Glasgow Herald and 
Workers' City, a group of left-wing and anarchist artists and workers. The 60 
or so active Workers' City members champion the class struggle against what 
they regard as Glasgow's yuppie ascendancy. 
</P>
<P>
Although unemployment remains above 14%, the cultural capital designation 
recognized Glasgow's self-regeneration from industrial blight, slums, ill 
health and violence to a humming center of commerce, tourism and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
The poor have been moved out of the city center and their tenements demolished, 
but to Workers' City they are no better off in the bleak, damp tower blocks 
erected for them on Glasgow's periphery. 
</P>
<P>
"In the interests of privatizing Glasgow and presenting it as a place without 
problems, the Glasgow's Glasgow exhibition buries our history of industrial 
struggle," said Brendan McLaughlin, owner of the Scotia Bar, where Workers' 
City meets.

   Perhaps it's a sign of better times in
tough old Glasgow that this year's biggest uproar was about the
past.
   Critics attacked an exhibition about the city's 800 years, which
stressed its relations with the world, for ``sanitizing history.''
   Glasgow's Glasgow, as it was called, closed Nov. 5 and was the
city's biggest attraction in 50 years, drawing half a million
visitors. The show may have lost more than $8 million in a 30-week
run, which the city will have to cover.
   City Hall will announce the cost in February when it presents
the entire bill for the city's year as the European Capital of
Culture.
   The exhibition, promoted as ``Everything Glasgow gave to the
world ... and more,'' was the centerpiece of the year-long festival
celebrating the title bestowed by culture ministers of the
12-nation European Community. Athens, Florence, Amsterdam, Berlin
and Paris were chosen in earlier years.
   Jill Campbell Mackay, public relations director for the cultural
year, said the title Glasgow's Glasgow ``meant how the city
perceived itself as perceived by the outside world.''
   Under 22 arches of storage space below the central railway
station, unused for 60 years, the show assembled 3,200 artifacts of
history, industry and social life.
   They ranged from a model of the yacht Shamrock V, with which
Glasgow grocery tycoon Sir Thomas Lipton made five unsuccessful
tries for the America's Cup, to the suitcase of an emigrant who
paid 2 pounds (then $10) for passage to Canada in the 1920s.
   Documentary films lauded Glasgow's greatness as the second city
of the British Empire, an industrial cornucopia that poured out
textiles, locomotives, weapons and, by 1913, about 60 percent of
the world's ships.
   ``I think the exhibition was a great success,'' said Robert
Palmer, director of the cultural year. ``A space which was dripping
wet, unusable and derelict was renovated, and that space and the
new Arches Theater there seem certain to become a permanent part of
the city's life.''
   An unusual partnership of business and a socialist council
budgeted 50 million pounds ($80 million when the year began) to
make Cultural Capital 1990 a success. About $7 million went for
Glasgow's Glasgow.
   Commercial sponsors contributed cash, materials and assistance
valued at about $1.2 million.
   U.S. Ambassador Henry E. Catto visited the show June 20 and
called it the ``most imaginative exhibition of its kind I have ever
seen.''
   Sniper fire was aimed at it regularly, however, by the daily
Glasgow Herald and Workers' City, a group of left-wing and
anarchist writers, poets, folk musicians and workers. The 60 or so
active Workers' City members champion the class struggle against
what they regard as Glasgow's yuppie ascendancy.
   Glasgow is renowned for fierce partisanship. Alone among British
cities, it is regarded as having come close to revolution - in
1919, during a general strike.
   The red flag was raised in George Square when 20,000
demonstrators demanded a 40-hour work week. While the sheriff read
them the Riot Act, ordering them to disperse, a bottle hit him on
the head. Forty people were seriously injured when horse and foot
police charged the crowd.
   A photograph of tanks and troops assembled at the Cattle Market
was part of Glasgow's Glasgow.
   Although unemployment remains above 14 percent, the cultural
capital designation recognized Glasgow's self-regeneration from
industrial blight, slums, ill health and violence to a humming
center of commerce, tourism and the arts.
   The poor have been moved out of the city center and their
tenements demolished, but to Workers' City they are no better off
in the bleak, damp tower blocks erected for them on Glasgow's
periphery.
   ``We have been accused of being pro-poverty, but it isn't
true,'' said Brendan McLaughlin, owner of the Scotia Bar, where
Workers' City meets.
   ``In the interests of privatizing Glasgow and presenting it as a
place without problems, the Glasgow's Glasgow exhibition buries our
history of industrial struggle.''
   John Murray, the show's marketing executive, said: ``We had the
slums, the drink, the gambling, the crime, the sickness and death
alongside the shipyards, the factories, the scientists and the new
industries.''
   In hopes of making a profit, Glasgow District Council set an
admission charge of 4 pounds (then $6.50) when the show opened in
April.
   After public and press criticism, the price was reduced in July
to a pound (about $1.60). Total attendance was 501,105, largest for
such a show in Glasgow since the Empire Exhibition of 1938
attracted 12{ million visitors from around the world. That one lost
money, too.
   ``No exhibition makes money, but the cost of subsidizing
Glasgow's Glasgow was only half the cost of others in Europe,''
said Doug Clelland, the architect who devised it.
   Clelland is proud of the exhibition's appeal. ``We did three
exit surveys and found 30 percent of the people visiting it had
never before set foot in a museum or gallery,'' he said.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (8): A lot to offer - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOURISM has been one of the key elements in the renaissance of Glasgow.
In 1982 there were 700,000 visitors to Glasgow, many of them day trippers.
By 1990 the number had risen to 3m. Of these, 1.5m were staying visitors
with an average stop of two nights. Around 500,000 were from abroad.
It has been estimated that the total tourist 'spend' in that year was Pounds
217m accounting for 10 per cent of tourist spending in Scotland as a whole.
In terms of foreign visitors, the amount spent was Pounds 109m or half the
total. This accounted for almost 20 per cent of the Scottish average.
Glasgow became the third most popular short break destination in the UK
after London and Edinburgh.
According to the Greater Glasgow Tourist Board 22,000 people in Glasgow were
employed in tourism in 1990 out of a labour force of 350,000. This figure
does not include the self-employed and represents 6.3 per cent of the
workforce.
How has this transformation come about? Admittedly, 1990 was exceptional,
marking Glasgow's designation as the EC City of Culture and last year,
visitors again dropped back a little.
But the City of Culture year was only a stage in a concerted drive by the
Labour-dominated city council to diversify the city's economy.
First, it would spruce up the city centre. Second it would develop retailing
at all levels. Third it would win inward investors from financial services,
government departments and high technology companies. Finally, there would
be an attempt to exploit its rich cultural heritage to attract visitors.
Glasgow claims to have the largest cultural infrastructure in the UK outside
London and has some 200 cultural and performing arts organisations.
The authorities' attempts to increase tourism received a lift from set-piece
events such as the Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988 visited by more than 4m
people in five months.
Then there was the City of Culture year in 1990. Some 3,700 events of
different sizes were staged throughout the year. A report on the year's
impact on Glasgow, by Professor John Myerscough, an economist specialising
in the economic impact of culture, concluded that: 'The initiative generated
a positive net economic return to the regional economy of Pounds 10.3m to
Pounds 14.1m. Extra employment arising from Glasgow 1990 was estimated at
5,350'5,580 person years.' The year of culture also attracted about 600,000
extra visitors. But although culture spearheaded the campaign to develop
tourism it was not the whole story.
The much brighter image of Glasgow had attracted the general leisure tourist
before 1990. The shopping/hotel/ restaurant infrastructure was well
developed by 1990. The speciality shopping in Prince's Square and the
Italian centre are both appealing to an international audience.
Americans started to add Glasgow to London, Stratford and Edinburgh on their
list of cultural destinations. International visitor numbers were further
boosted when, under the government's open skies policy for Scotland, Glasgow
airport won the right to operate transatlantic flights, ending the monopoly
held by Prestwick. There are now daily flights between Glasgow and
destinations in the US and Canada.
Glasgow is increasingly seen as a starting place for trips to the Highlands,
to the Robert Burns country in Ayrshire and Dumfriesshire, to Loch Lomond
and the golf courses of St Andrews and Gleneagles.
The Greater Glasgow Tourist Board claims that 'Greater Glasgow is the only
destination in Western Europe that can boast 13,000 beds, a purpose-built
conference and exhibition centre and international airport all within 15
minutes of each other'.
The Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre can house concerts for 10,000
and has seen performers as diverse as Pavarotti and Paul Simon in recent
years. But its main function is to house trade shows and conferences in its
five halls.
Business visitors are another important element of Glasgow's tourism drive.
There are a number of four star business hotels like the Holiday Inn and
Forte Crest. Next April the city will get its first 5-star hotel with the
opening of the Glasgow Hilton.
The 300-room hotel costing over Pounds 36m will include a grand ballroom for
up to 1,000 people, a specialist conference centre and 11 boardrooms.
Mr Ronald Roy , the chief executive of the Greater Glasgow Tourist Board and
Convention Bureau, reckons the importance of business tourism should not be
underestimated. He says, 'rounded up I estimate that about half the Pounds
200m-odd Glasgow earns from tourism comes from business visitors,
particularly conferences'.

FT  15 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Cancellations at Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There has been bad news for users of transatlantic air services from
Scotland in the past few weeks. First, American Airlines announced that its
daily service from Glasgow to Chicago would in future only operate in the
summer. Flights would finish this year on November 2.
Next, Northwest Airlines said it was ending its daily Glasgow-Boston service
altogether on October 25, after flying from Scotland for 14 years.
These decisions reverse the gradual expansion of transatlantic services from
Glasgow that began in 1990, when the government stopped forcing
intercontinental flights to use Prestwick airport, 30 miles south-east of
Glasgow. At that time, American Airlines and British Airways, which had
refused to use Prestwick, launched services from Glasgow, with American
flying daily to Chicago and BA three times a week to New York. Northwest and
Air Canada moved to Glasgow from Prestwick, and last year United Airlines
began flying daily from Washington DC.
Aviation specialists believe the latest decisions to cancel flights reflect
airlines' determination to improve returns on their assets rather than seek
market share. American Airlines complained that, while summer holiday
traffic was good, there were not enough year-round business travellers to
give a satisfactory yield per seat and make the service profitable overall.
Northwest also blamed low yields, and claimed there was excess capacity on
transatlantic routes from Glasgow.
One difficulty is that business or first-class passengers do not necessarily
want to fly from their local airport. The convenience is offset by the fact
that there are a much greater number of transatlantic services from London's
Heathrow and Gatwick airports, giving passengers a range of options in case
of delay or cancellation. And many of these flights go direct to the
traveller's ultimate North American destination.
Mr Bob Buntin, Northwest's general manager for Scotland, says that its
Glasgow flights have had good capacity utilisation, but claims this is only
because fares are low. 'We have been trapped for some time at the low end of
the market,' he says.
BAA, which runs Glasgow airport, hopes to persuade the remaining year-round
transatlantic carriers, United, Air Canada and British Airways, to increase
their services to take up any slack. British Airways says it will increase
its frequency to New York from four flights a week to five, probably from
January.

FT  01 OCT 93 / MoD rethink means 700 new jobs for Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW has finally won the battle for the Ministry of Defence's new
personnel centre, which will bring the city up to 700 jobs.
It appeared several times that a guarantee to base the centre in the city
might be snatched away after it was announced in January that Glasgow was
the recommended site for the unified personnel centre to handle all Army pay
and pensions.
The proposal was to bring together a number of smaller offices around
Britain and create 700 jobs in Glasgow while safeguarding 400 existing jobs.
But then Stockport, Greater Manchester, entered a bid proposing a suitable
building which would cost Pounds 4m against Pounds 20m for one in Glasgow.
The decision to look seriously at the Stockport proposal angered Mr Ian
Lang, Scottish secretary, particularly as Rosyth lost the Pounds 5.5bn
Trident submarine refitting contract to Devonport.
After looking again in Glasgow, a cheaper, existing building at Kentigern
was proposed and consultations started.
But in July the MoD was inundated with a stream of representations and
intense lobbying from MPs proposing alternative sites around the country.
Ministers preferred the Kentigern proposal and had seen nothing to dissuade
them from housing the centre in Glasgow.
Some 225 defence and aviation jobs are to go in Scotland. GEC-Marconi
Avionics, which employs over 4,000 people in Edinburgh and Fife blamed the
decline in UK defence orders.
In Fife, 300 new jobs are to be created with Solectron Corporation taking
over Philips Circuit Assemblies in Dunfermline.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (7): Posh Gorbals - Slum Transformation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW, like most other big British cities, made big efforts after the
Second World War to disperse its population from the centre to the suburbs.
One result was a fall in population - from 1.12m in 1939 to only 700,000
today. Another was the so-called doughnut effect: Glasgow has a rich centre
and a poor periphery. The metaphor does not work completely since not all
council tenants were moved to the peripheral estates, where until the 1970s
most housing was built by the public sector for rent.
But most recent inner city residential developments have been privately
developed. In the Merchant City, attractive but derelict warehouses and
factories close to the City Chambers (city hall) were handed over to private
developers by the city council and made into residential units which are
either unsuitable for families or beyond the pocket of working class people.
In 1980s terminology, it was 'yuppified'.
Now, however, an ambitious pilot scheme, backed by the Glasgow Development
Agency, the Glasgow District Council and Scottish Homes, the housing
enabling body, aims to develop a low cost housing community close to the
city centre.
The project, called the Crown Street regeneration project, is to take place
in part of the notorious Gorbals, which is a microcosm of Glasgow's changing
fortunes over the past 100 years.
The Gorbals, on the south bank of the River Clyde only five minutes from the
city centre, was once a respectable middle class area. Then from the 1860s
the once fashionable four storey tenements in the area were occupied by
Irish immigrants and Highlanders driven to the big city by famine and
clearances. So overcrowded were the buildings that a system known as
'ticketing' was introduced, which stipulated the numbers who could live in a
four storey building. By the 1880s one seventh of Glasgow's population lived
in ticketed buildings.
With industrialisation people continued to pour in. By the early 1900s, the
still elegant stone facades of Hutchesontown in the centre of the Gorbals
concealed a hidden Glasgow. Families ate, slept, gave birth and died in one
room.
The cheap housing attracted further immigrants from Ireland and Eastern
Europe and from Pakistan. These added their own cultures to the distinctive
street life of the area. But the area became best known for the violence of
the so-called razor gangs. By the 1950s the Gorbals had the worst slums
north of Naples.
The post-war planners in Glasgow decided to start from scratch. The first
area in the city to be tackled was Hutchesontown/ Gorbals. The Hutchesontown
Redevelopment Plan was finally approved in 1957. The area was to be a green
city of tower blocks.
It was not a success. The communities felt cut off and alienated. Within a
short time the tower blocks - built using the 'tracoba' method of system
building imported from Algeria - suffered from dampness and condensation.
Lifts broke down. The dampness proved incurable. By 1982 the last residents
were moved out. Five years later Hutcheson E - the most notorious of the
blocks - was demolished.
There are 40 acres standing empty in Hutchesontown owned by the city
council. It is here that the Crown Street regeneration project will take
place. The plan is to build 1,000 four storey tenements. The first two
floors will be three and four bedroom maisonettes with gardens back and
front. The top two floors will form single level one and two bedroom
apartments.
Twenty five per cent of the dwellings will be for rent with the rest for
owner occupation. The entire project will cost Pounds 80m. Scottish Homes
has put up Pounds 9m as seed money (in England it would be defined as city
grant.) Because the council owns the land, and there is a high level of
subsidy, the housing that is not for rent will be cheap. Maisonettes will
start at Pounds 50,000 and flats at Pounds 32,000.
Mr Mike Galloway, the director of the project which is only at the stage of
examining design tenders, says, 'what we are attempting here is
revolutionary. We are going for urban regeneration without gentrification.
We are going to build a genuine lower middle class community here. There
will be shops and community centres. We even have plans for a budget hotel.
People from different walks of life will want to live here because it is so
close to the city centre.'
The peripheral estates which have tens of thousands of residents are a
different problem. The estates, consisting of a mixture of three to four
storey blocks of flats and tower blocks, have become almost as infamous as
the Gorbals. They are characterised by high unemployment (30 per cent in
some cases), by alienation and loss of community spirit, by vandalism, drugs
and other symptoms of deprivation.
It is unfair to say, however, that because the estates are out of sight they
are out of mind. Professor Alan MacGregor of Glasgow University sits on the
partnership committee for the Castlemilk estate, to the south of the city.
This is one of four partnership areas in Scotland designated by the
secretary of state for Scotland - joint ventures between central government
and local community organisations.
Professor MacGregor says, 'Over 10 years hundreds of millions of pounds will
be channeled into the estates in all kinds of areas, housing, training,
employment and training. One of the things we are doing is to improve links
between Castlemilk and East Kilbride where there are good employment
prospects after the recession.'
In other areas organisations such as the Glasgow Development Agency, the
Glasgow District Council and the Confederation of British Industry in
Scotland are involved in initiatives on the estates. Professor MacGregor
says, 'it is early days for the initiatives. But it is not true to say that
the city council is spending money on tarting up the centre and on the arts
that it should be spending on the estates. It is doing both.'

FT  14 MAY 93 / MoD centre for Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW should be the location of the army's new centralised personnel
centre, the government announced yesterday, James Buxton writes. Two months
ago there were fears in the Scottish city that the centre, which would have
created 700 new jobs, would go to Stockport, near Manchester, despite
Glasgow having been designated as the army's preferred location in January.
The army, however, intends to locate the centre in the Ministry of Defence's
existing building, rather than occupying a large, recently completed office
building in the city centre which has been standing empty for more than a
year.
The latest recommendation on the centre, which the army wanted to group
together the administration of all army pay and personnel matters, is
subject to consultation and a final decision will be made in July.
Mr Archie Hamilton, armed forces minister, said that the army had decided
that the most economical option was to house the centre in Kentigern House
in Glasgow at a cost of Pounds 6m.
This would be cheaper than occupying a new building in Glasgow at a cost of
Pounds 25m, or taking a building in Stockport which would cost Pounds 15m.

<DATELINE> Glasgow, Scotland  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As a city official tells it, the worst thing that ever happened to Glasgow was when a pair of local boys made good and wrote a best-selling novel some 50 years ago. 
The book, "No Mean City," was set in Gorbals, Glasgow's South Bronx, where everyone, it seems, lived in stinking tenements and brandished straight-edge razors, slashing each other when things got dull. 

   These days, no one lives in Gorbals, which looks like a vast, deserted parking lot. 
But the memory lingers. 
"These guys write this bloody book and convince the entire Western world that Glasgow is full of razor gangs," the official sighs. 

   What's a city to do? 
In Glasgow's case, convince the entire Western world that it's full of culture. 

   Glasgow isn't Belfast, but it's not exactly the first British city you think of in connection with high culture. 
Yet a few months back, Glasgow stunned much of Britain by getting itself chosen as European City of Culture for 1990. 

   True, a lot of people have never heard of the European City of Culture award, which was launched in 1984 through efforts by actress Melina Mercouri, Greece's cultural minister at the time. 
But European Community countries, which each year submit nominations for the prize, regard it as a high honor capable of boosting civic morale and, more important, tourism. 
To date, winners have included Amsterdam, Florence and, the initial recipient, Athens (surprise, surprise), with Berlin and Paris on tap for '88 and '89 respectively. 

   Glasgow officials, a realistic, down-to-earth bunch, admit that their city is the wild card in that lineup. 
But they're determined to demonstrate the selection was no fluke. 
If the city fathers have their way, the award and accompanying blizzard of trimmings (concerts, art shows, building refurbishments, even a new symphony hall) will have an effect similar to that of those international cultural expositions in the 19th century. 
"If 1990 doesn't leave a permanent impact on the city, it won't have achieved its objective," says Robert Palmer, head of the festivities. 

   Glasgow does deserve a celebration, perhaps less for its culture than its amazing resurrection. 
Britain's north is studded with industrial dinosaurs like Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle, which were hit hard by heavy industry's decline. 
For years, Glasgow was leader of the pack, with more blight, more filth, more unemployment. 
Its postwar architecture was less than thrilling; dozens of lovely old Victorians were uprooted for a sprawling freeway. 
More bulldozing was planned. 

   Then, in 1968, a violent storm hit Glasgow, rendering those "No Mean City"-style tenements uninhabitable. 
"We think of that storm as divine intervention," chuckles a city official. 
Glasgow planned to knock down the tenements and build concrete high-rises, but with people homeless, there wasn't time. 
So they were rehabilitated, with new roofs, new interiors and sandblasts for their sooty walls. 

   That effectively ended Glasgow's flirtation with East German architecture. 
In the post-storm years, dozens of wonderful old buildings got facelifts and, along the way, Glasgow not only cleaned up its act, it became a leader in British gentrification. 
It now boasts more than 800 listed buildings, including its magnificent City Chambers, a breathtaking ode to high Victorian excess, with vast domed ceilings, countless carved fireplaces and, according to local lore, more marble than the Vatican. 
A major campaign to scrub down the city's blackened buildings should be finished by 1990. 
And with industrial pollution gone, they should stay pale and pretty for years. 

   But Glasgow's self-esteem hit its 20th-century height in 1983, with the opening of the Burrell Collection, a splendid art-through-the-ages museum. 
Housed in a big, airy building, it's one of the few British museums in which the setting is as intriguing as the contents. 
Nearly everything, from the Tang horses to the Degas pastels, was collected by William Burrell, a rather dour Glaswegian shipowner with an eye for beauty and a buy. (He liked big 15th-century European tapestries because, as he put it, you get your money's worth.) 

   The Burrell Collection convinced boosters here that Glasgow had a great untapped potential -- tourism. 
Plenty of locals still consider this a big joke. 
"Who the hell wants to come to Glasgow?" muses a cab driver as we head for the train station in pouring rain. 
But Glasgow is surprisingly well equipped for cultural tourists, the ones who revel in history and get heart palpitations at the sight of vintage buildings. 
Though all the rough spots haven't been smoothed yet, the city's already had sufficient success to serve as a model for Liverpool, Newcastle and those other northerners rich in little but the past. 

   Of the bunch, Glasgow is the pearl. 
Architecturally, it is to the Victorian era what Bath is to the Georgian. 
Though it isn't a thrilling walking city, within a few blocks of the City Chambers are enough old Victorians to leave the stroller gaping, dizzy in a forest of turrets, ironwork and, best of all, stained glass (ever so convenient for blotting out urban blight). 

   Glasgow was also home to Charles Rennie Mackintosh, that inspired turn-of-the-century architect who shocked sober Victorians with mischievous grace notes such as bright green doors and eerily elongated lines. 
His most enduring design is probably the Glasgow School of Art, his alma mater, which manages to be both impish and pragmatic. 
A short hop from those rococo temples of Victoriana, it stands in quiet dignity on a hilltop, the first modern building in the land. 

   There's plenty more, from the Hunterian Museum with its huge collection of Whistlers (a highlight is a collage of his paintbrushes) to Miss Toward's tenement house, with its gaslights and closet bed. 
One of the nicest things is that you can stroll through a museum or ogle a building in peace; there's never a crowd. 
The big 1990 festivities may change all that. 
Glasgow could certainly use the attention. 
But it's not such a bad place right now.

   Glasgow, Scotland -- It's time to get out of the freezing
rain in the Barras, Glasgow's weekend junk market. It is also
time for lunch, which here is called dinner. The first tea
shop I find is cheap and cheerful. Inside, solitary men, and
ginger-haired ladies wedged into booths with their bundles
and freckled kids, already are tucking in: fried bread, eggs
and square sausages, scones, white and pink cakes, fish and
chips, in fact chips with everything. Dinner is washed down
with an orange syrup called Irn Bru, and perhaps followed by
a Kensitas Club (a brand known only to Glaswegians, who smoke
more cigarettes than any other Britons). The food tastes
great and it's not hard to believe that this city has claimed
the highest rate of heart disease in Europe. And the people
generally look unwell; I am beginning to make sense of the
Scots poet Mick Imlah's observation, "If people were
buildings, there would still be slums in Glasgow."
   Two prams for the price of one, eight cans of spaghetti
for a pound: Back out in the rain, the discount shops and
hawkers are doing brisk trade. Though nothing like it was --
a 1904 municipal report on housing conditions records 11
adults living in a room 10 feet square, and people sleeping
in layers (some on top of the bed and others underneath) --
Glasgow is poor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   From this corner, the city's new status as this year's
Cultural Capital of Europe seems implausible and irrelevant,
even frivolous. In another part of town, however, the
distinct hiss of the cappuccino machine can now be heard.
Glassy new shopping arcades feature designer boutiques and
galleries. Wine bars with names like Berlin and Cafe Qui are
appearing as alternatives to Glasgow's undecorous
harddrinking pubs, where as recently as the 1970s women were
forbidden (and where even now they will be made to feel
mighty unwelcome if they dare enter). Drinking has been
astutely upheld as one of Glasgow's primary cultural
attractions. For this year only, European practice obtains:
Alcohol may be sold through the night, while the rest of
Britain is kept to its kindergarten curfew of 11 p.m.
   This is the new Glasgow, but everywhere in it the old one
stubbornly resides. Dramatic chiaroscuro buildings of creamy
and coal-blackened limestone suggest (if one imagines that
the only partial sandblasting is deliberate) what is perhaps
an ambivalence here about the city's changing image. This
used to be a place where things were made; is it now to be
merely one in which they are on display? Most of the
shipyards down on the river Clyde are gone, and most of the
redundant docks have been filled in; one quay has become the
site of a 300-room hotel and an enormous bright-red
exhibition center. Nearby, a remaining crane, which used to
sweep 100-ton locomotives onto ships, is an impressive
monument to the vanished industry that made Glasgow.
Occasionally a sculpture -- a tiny parcel in the distance --
is hung from it: That's really putting culture in
perspective.
   Though many individual Glaswegians are characteristically
wry and self-mocking about their new status, the official
version is serious to the tune of $66 million, which is being
spent on special events, festivals, championships, publicity.
If some of this year's Culture is sprayed on (sometimes
literally, as in the conversion of buses, with daubs of
paint, into "public art"), there are plenty of long-lived
reasons for thinking of Glasgow as something other than the
place where football hooliganism was invented. The Scottish
National Orchestra, the Scottish Opera and the Ballet live
here; as do the Citizens' Theatre and the Tramway, where
Philip Glass's "Mahabharata" played last year. The Burrell
Collection, an impressive bequest of paintings and objects
from a native collector, is one of several good museums.
Charles Rennie Mackintosh gave the city a few great modern
buildings (as well as a style that appears, somewhat
doggedly, as a motif in all sorts of placesit has even
inspired the stained plastic fixtures of Glasgow's fast-food
joints). But even as you are cheerfully being directed to any
of these sights, you get the feeling that the Glaswegian
hopes you won't be too impressed by his or her institutions,
and even less so by this year's planned 2,000 cultural
events, whose language -- publicity-speak -- and
international flavor (23 countries are contributing acts of
their own), may not say a lot about what is valued locally.
It was, however, with real, unrehearsed enthusiasm that I was
led by one self-appointed guide up a featureless residential
street to the house of Miss Agnes Toward. A typist for a
shipping firm for 45 years, Miss Toward lived with her mother
in a modest and tidy flat. She baked pies, listened to the
wireless, went to church, voted Conservative and saved
everything. When she died, the sparsely furnished rooms in
which she lived out her decent life were recognized as an
instant museum. There's not much to see in this diorama of
spinsterhood, but its very preservation suggests that what is
really being celebrated here is the ordinary citizen.
   Walking through the city, you will pass many buildings
wrapped in scaffolding. It is stirring to look up from the
street and, through the windows, see only sky. Glasgow may
think that it is preserving its facades while radically
remaking its innards; the opposite, however, would seem
truer.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Promised Glasgow army jobs in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW is to continue fighting to persuade the army to locate its new
personnel centre in the city, creating 700 jobs, after Mr Archie Hamilton,
the armed forces minister, confirmed that the army was considering an
alternative site in Stockport, near Manchester.
Amid accusations from Scottish politicians of all parties that the
government was reneging on a decision made only six weeks ago, Mr Hamilton
said the ministry had only recently become aware of a existence of a
suitable building in Stockport which would cost Pounds 4m against Pounds 20m
for the one earmarked in Glasgow.
He indicated that it was likely that the army would settle for Stockport,
although the recommendation was still subject to review. It was important
that the taxpayer received value for money.
In January the army said it was recommending Glasgow as the site of its new
unified personnel centre to handle all army pay and pensions. It said it
would lead to the closure of several smaller offices around Britain, but 700
new jobs would be created in Glasgow and 400 existing MoD jobs in the city
would be safeguarded.
It was expected that the centre would be located in Tay House, a large new
office building standing empty in the heart of the city.
Mr Hamilton said the ministry had always made clear that the original
recommendation was subject to a period of review. During that period the
ministry's consultants had become aware of a suitable vacant building in
Stockport. which they had not known about.
The decision to give Stockport serious consideration has infuriated Mr Ian
Lang, the Scottish secretary, who next week will announce the government's
plans for improved constitutional arrangements for Scotland, which are
widely expected not to satisfy the opposition parties.
The Glasgow development agency, which was helping the army find a location
for its new centre, said yesterday it had offered the army several
buildings, some of which were cheaper than the one eventually chosen. 'We
were always told that they wanted a modern building to take them into the
21st century,' the agency said yesterday.
It believes that the Pounds 4m building in Stockport is a 1970s structure.
'We will go back and make our submission all over again,' the agency said.
Meanwhile there were indications yesterday that the government will next
week announce the transfer of some of the civil servants concerned with
regulating the North Sea oil industry from London to Aberdeen. But the
proposed transfer appeared to amount to less than that urged by Scottish
politicians.
Mr Bob Middleton, convener of Grampian regional council, which includes
Aberdeen, said he understood that a cabinet committee had agreed on Thursday
that between 30 and 40 civil servants' posts would be moved from London to
Aberdeen.
That is fewer than the 80-odd civil servants in the petroleum engineering
division of the Department of Trade and Industry's energy section, whose
transfer to Aberdeen has long been a demand of businessmen and politicians
in north-east Scotland.

FT  12 OCT 94 / United ends its Glasgow service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
United Airlines is to withdraw its daily service between Glasgow and
Washington DC at the end of November, only 18 months after it was launched.
It is the third airline in three months to announce the withdrawal or
curtailment of transatlantic flights from Scotland.
United said it was losing money on the route and wanted to redeploy its
aircraft in more profitable markets. It said it had achieved high
peak-season load factors, but yields were low because of the shortage of
passengers paying premium fares. It sells fewer than two business class
seats a day in Scotland and five in the US.
The departure of United Airlines will leave only British Airways flying all
through the year from Glasgow to the US. Later this month Northwest Airlines
will cease its daily Glasgow-Boston service after 14 years, and American
Airlines is to operate its daily Glasgow-Chicago service in the summer only,
ending its all-year service on November 2.
The airlines' decisions are a serious blow to long-running efforts by BAA,
which runs Glasgow airport, and the development body Scottish Enterprise to
attract transatlantic services to Glasgow. It was felt direct flights would
benefit Scottish consumers and make it easier to attract US companies to
open plants in Scotland.
United said too many Scots preferred to fly to the US via London or
Continental airports. Mr David Coltman, vice-president for transatlantic
services, added: 'Scottish business travellers are very cost-conscious. They
will put up with restrictions such as staying over a weekend in order to get
a lower fare.'
Manchester airport is also seeing a reduction in long-haul services this
winter, with BA ending flights to Los Angeles and American Airlines making
its New York service summer only. South African Airlines is ceasing to fly
from Manchester to Johannesburg.

FT  25 APR 94 / Business Travel:: Highland link by BA and Loganair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Air travellers to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland will notice changes
from July 11. There will be fewer flights by British Airways' 64-seat ATP
turbo-prop aircraft, and more by Loganair's 36-seat Shorts 360s.
The white and red livery of Loganair's fleet will also gradually be
repainted in BA colours, and its cabin staff will don BA uniforms.
The changes, which will mean a small increase in frequencies on some routes
but with smaller aircraft, are the consequence of Loganair becoming a
franchisee of BA.
It will remain a separate company (and may also be bought by its management
from Airlines of Britain, owner of British Midland), but will operate
services for BA as British Airways Express. Loganair flights will get BA
prefix codes and join BA's reservations system.
BA's ATPs will stop serving Glasgow-Aberdeen, Glasgow-Belfast International,
Glasgow-Inverness, Inverness-Kirkwall, Kirkwall-Sumburgh, Edinburgh-Aberdeen
and Aberdeen-Inverness routes. Loganair as BA Express, using Shorts 360s,
will take over Glasgow-Belfast and Glasgow-Aberdeen, and will increase
frequency on Glasgow-Inverness, Inverness-Kirkwall and Kirkwall-Sumburgh.
Neither company will fly Edinburgh-Aberdeen or Aberdeen-Inverness (though
Air UK and Business Air serve the former, and Business Air the latter).
BA will continue to fly to Benbecula and Stornoway in the Western Isles and
to Shetland and Orkney, while BA Express will go on serving its many island
destinations.
The arrangement safeguards Loganair as a business and preserves its thin
routes, while enabling BA to give up loss-making routes and deploy more ATPs
on services linking Glasgow and Edinburgh with Manchester and Birmingham.

FT  04 FEB 92 / Glasgow shows return of up to Pounds 14m as EC city of
culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW'S economy, tourism and culture received a strong boost in 1990 when
it was the EC's European city of culture.
The year, during which Glasgow provided an uninterrupted stream of cultural
events, is reckoned to have created more than 5,000 temporary jobs and
produced a net return to the regional economy of between Pounds 10m and
Pounds 14m.
The European city of culture accolade passes to EC cities in turn. Glasgow
says it was the only city to provide an all-encompassing programme running
for 12 months. Other cities to hold the accolade have provided concentrated
programmes of arts events.
This year the city of culture is Madrid. Last year it was Dublin.
A report by Mr John Myerscough, a consultant specialising in the economic
impact of cultural events, says there was an 81 per cent increase in visits
by tourists to arts events compared with 1986.
During the year attendance at theatres, galleries, halls and museums rose by
40 per cent.
The report says the cost to the public sector of creating between 5,300 and
5,600 jobs during the year was Pounds 7,286 per job, which compared
favourably with other job-creating initiatives.
The net gain to the economy of up to Pounds 14m took into account
public-sector support of Pounds 36m. The private sector contributed Pounds
6m, and total spending was Pounds 400m.
Mr Myerscough said Glasgow now needed to main-tain the momentum created by
the year of culture and to promote the city as a cultural tourist
destination, especially for the short-breaks market.

IN THE middle of January, General Sir David Ramsbotham, adjutant-general of

The aim was to celebrate the decision by the army to locate its new
personnel centre handling army pay and pensions in the city, creating 700
jobs.
The idea involved closing several smaller offices around Britain. In
addition to the new jobs, some 400 existing ministry of defence jobs in the
city would be safeguarded. The MoD would do everyone a favour by occupying
Tay House, a large new office building standing empty in the heart of the
city.
But the celebrations proved premature. In early March, Mr Archie Hamilton,
the armed forces minister, said the army was now considering an alternative
building at Stockport, near Manchester. Its consultants had overlooked it
originally but the MoD had to face the fact it was on the market for Pounds
4m against the Pounds 20m the Glasgow site would cost.
The apparent about turn by the MoD infuriated Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary, and dismayed and puzzled the Glasgow Development Agency which had
persuaded the army that Glasgow was the army's best choice. Mr Hamilton said
it had always been stated that the original decision was 'subject to review
and further consultation'. He indicated that Stockport was likely to win the
re-opened contest.
The GDA still believes it has a good chance of saving the project for
Glasgow, believing that the costs of refurbishing the Stockport building and
the other advantages of Glasgow mean that its case outweighs that of
Stockport. No final decision has been made.
But the affair has been a poor demonstration of the government's stated
policy of showing greater consideration to Scotland. The policy was summed
up in a white paper issued in March entitled Scotland in the Union: a
partnership for good.
It said that since 1979 more than 4,000 civil service jobs 'are recorded as
having been moved or being about to move to Scotland'.
The day the white paper came out the government announced that the
department of trade and industry would move part of its oil and gas division
from London to Aberdeen. This was a partial victory for leaders of the
Aberdeen oil services industry who have been arguing for several years that
the government should move the Petroleum Engineering Directorate (PED) (once
part of the former department of energy) to Aberdeen.
The PED handles drilling and production licence applications by oil
companies. Scottish Enterprise, in a detailed study in 1991, endorsed the
theory that by moving the whole PED to Aberdeen enormous benefits would
follow. Oil companies, it said, would transfer the staff who dealt with the
PED to the northern city, and engineering design companies would follow
them.
The split in oil industry expertise between London and Aberdeen would end.
Aberdeen would become the unchallenged centre of European oil expertise.
Exports of services and equipment would increase and the UK share of the
world offshore oil market might double. Eventually, an extra 15,000 jobs
might be created in the UK.
Many people said at the time that Scottish Enterprise was spoiling a good
case with exaggeration. The Scottish media did not help, repeatedly saying
that the 15,000 new jobs would all be in Scotland or even in Aberdeen alone,
rather than in the whole of Britain.
There was evidently intense reluctance by the oil industry civil servants to
move north. After much prevarication the government commissioned a study of
the issue by Ernst &amp; Young.
The Ernst &amp; Young report, released last month, will have made uncomfortable
reading for Scottish Enterprise. It said there was 'no clear case' for
moving the whole of the PED to Aberdeen. It would mean a loss of business
efficiency to the DTI. The impact on the location of other organisations
would be 'small'.
It acknowledged that there would be a 'small gain' in promoting an
agglomeration of industries and skills in Aberdeen, which 'should improve
the UK international position in offshore supplies and services'.
The government has decided to move 60 geologists and engineers of the PED
from London to Aberdeen to provide services previously only available in
London. The Aberdeen office would take 'the nationwide lead in the issue of
field development consents' and process development applications from
companies based in Aberdeen. If more oil companies moved the office would be
expanded to 80 staff.
It was a partial victory for Aberdeen but also an overdue dose of realism.
The civil servants start moving towards the end of this year.

FT  07 AUG 93 / Staff muck in to support Scotland's forgotten airport: There
are no passengers, but Prestwick insists it has a future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE 400,000 people who live in Ayrshire have one thing in common it is a
passionate loyalty to Prestwick Airport.
There is a widespread belief that the airport, near Ayr on the Firth of
Clyde, is one of the world's finest. It has a long runway, an impressive
passenger terminal and the area's mild climate means it is hardly ever
forced to close.
Yet for the past year and a half it has had no regular passenger flights,
scheduled or charter. Much of the terminal is deserted. Even Mr Matthew
Hudson, the airport's chief executive, jokes: 'Business? We haven't got any
business.'
Prestwick's decline accelerated in 1990 when the government abolished the
legal requirement for transatlantic flights from Scotland to use Prestwick.
The number of flights using the airport was already dwindling: passengers
were reluctant to use it because, being 30 miles south-west of Glasgow, it
was seen as too remote for much of Scotland. As soon as transatlantic
flights were free to use Glasgow, services to north America were launched
from there.
Prestwick's monopoly had been maintained because of the influence wielded by
Ayrshire MPs, led by Mr George Younger, who was Tory MP for Ayr and is now
Lord Younger of Prestwick.
Now Ayrshire is having to prove its loyalty to Prestwick with money and hard
work.
In April last year the airport was bought from BAA, the airports operator,
by a consortium of Ayrshire business people and local authorities, chaired
by Lord Younger. It now belongs to PIK Holdings, a company named after
Prestwick's international call-sign.
Although there are no passenger flights, Prestwick has substantial air
freight business. Federal Express, the US freight company, operates daily
services and has taken a 10 per cent stake in PIK. Air Canada and TNT also
use the freight terminal.
The airport is used by British Aerospace which builds aircraft at Prestwick
and owns the runway. Its pilot training college can generate hundreds of
daily air movements by trainer aircraft.
Ryder Systems, the US company, has a plant adjoining the airport that
overhauls aero-engines. The airport is used by Bond Helicopters. There is
also a naval air station, HMS Gannet, whose previous commander Mr Paddy
Healey left the Navy to become PIK's managing director. But that is about
all.
Mr Hudson, a Canadian lawyer who moved to Ayrshire, says: 'We've had to
reinvent the way an airport is managed. What we've done enables us to
survive and be profitable at a very low level of turnover.'
New working practices were brought in. PIK made all 71 BAA employees
redundant and built up a new workforce, re-hiring some of the former staff
and engaging new ones on different conditions. The number of unions was cut
from about eight to one. All 137 staff have to be able to perform at least
two jobs.
'The crash rescue team works on the apron, shifts luggage when necessary or
cuts the grass,' says Mr Hudson. 'My secretary sometimes goes and works in
the duty-free store when aircrew want to purchase anything.'
Instead of contracting out handling and other services, PIK has taken over
everything itself. 'We do all freight and passenger handling,' says Mr
Hudson. PIK has taken over air traffic control from a Civil Aviation
Authority subsidiary, and runs its own duty-free sales.
Holiday flights from Prestwick should start again next year. The tour
company Direct Holidays is to operate flights to destinations including
Florida, Turkey and the Algarve. PIK has also set up its own travel agency.
Prestwick believes it can compete successfully with Glasgow because it
charges airlines Pounds 15 less a passenger, due in part to its
cost-reduction programme. It can also offer much cheaper carparking for
travellers than Glasgow. 'We want to make Prestwick into Scotland's
favourite holiday airport,' says Mr Hudson.
Now that Ayrshire has to take responsibility for Prestwick the community is
pulling all the stops out.
One of the airport's long-standing weaknesses is that although the
Glasgow-Ayr railway passes little more than 100 yards from the terminal,
there is no railway station.
Now a station is likely to be built at a cost of Pounds 2m, financed with
help from Strathclyde Regional Council and Kyle and Carrick District
Council, which is already a shareholder in PIK.
British Rail is also expected to agree to a scheme giving free rail travel
to the airport to rail travellers from anywhere in Scotland who display a
ticket for a Prestwick flight.
Mr Hudson explains that BAA had no motivation to promote Prestwick because
it owned Glasgow and Edinburgh airports. He believes BAA normally made
annual operating losses of about Pounds 3m at Prestwick.
PIK says it made a profit in its first year of operations. 'The accounts are
not yet audited, but we should make pre-tax profits of between Pounds
600,000 to Pounds 800,000 for the year to March 31 on turnover of about
Pounds 4.5m,' says Mr Hudson.
'We made a profit in the first half and have already handed out Pounds 250
to each of our staff in profit-related pay,' he adds. 'This is a community
endeavour.'
Even sceptics believe that whatever the next few years hold for Prestwick,
the airport's long-term survival is assured.
A politician involved with the airport explains: 'It will be politically
impossible ever to build a new runway at Glasgow. So when Glasgow eventually
runs out of space, Prestwick will come into its own.'

FT  06 FEB 92 / BAA launches programme to improve services at Glasgow
airport
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the airports operator, launched a Pounds 60m investment programme
yesterday to improve international passenger services at Glasgow airport.
The development will be the second stage in the extension and improvement of
the airport. The first stage, also costing Pounds 60m, is due to be
completed in June to provide 70 per cent more space for passengers.
The second stage will include an international pier for up to eight widebody
airliners, taxiways and aprons and an extension to the terminal to improve
international passenger services. Work is to be completed by 1996.
Glasgow has seen an increase in international traffic after the government's
'open skies' policy for Scotland, introduced in 1990. Last year more than 4m
passengers went through Glasgow, of whom almost half were international
travellers. The expansion programme will increase annual capacity from 5.5m
passengers to 10m.
BAA is negotiating the sale of Prestwick airport, Ayrshire. International
traffic has fallen there and switched to Glasgow because of the 'open skies'
policy.

FT  08 JUL 92 / Observer: Title brewing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One cannot question the loyalty of George Younger, the former defence
secretary. Who else would prefer to adopt the title of an obsolete Scottish
airport rather than some pretty glen?
Lord Younger of Prestwick, as he will soon be known, has always been
uncommonly faithful to the under-utilised airport in his former constituency
of Ayr. In the 18 years he was an MP, he led the lobby which persuaded the
government to keep Prestwick's monopoly on transatlantic flights to and from
Scotland.
Because the airport was highly inconvenient for much of the Scottish
population, its traffic dwindled to the point when on some winter days there
were no passenger flights at all; the development of air services from
Scotland was retarded by a decade, often to the benefit of airports like
Manchester.
However, Younger lost his battle in 1990 when the government finally allowed
neighbouring Glasgow to break Prestwick's transatlantic monopoly.
As a result BAA sold Prestwick earlier this year to a consortium, backed by
the local authority, with Younger a prime mover.
Prestwick is now developing its freight business and hoping for the day when
Glasgow becomes too congested. However, if Prestwick really proves a white
elephant, Younger won't necessarily be tagged for life. He should eventually
succeed to his father's title Viscount Younger of Leckie, the name of the
family home, a long, long way from Prestwick.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (3): The importance of image - Glasgow puts a brave
face on recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION has cast a pall of uncertainty over Glasgow, and yet in strictly
relative terms the city is suffering less from the downturn than many
others.
The recession came late to Glasgow, as it did to the rest of Scotland.
Unemployment in Glasgow was still falling just over a year ago when it was
rising fast in southern Britain, and at that time the city's commercial
property market was only beginning to experience a downturn. Even now
unemployment is only 1.5 per cent higher than in October 1990.
The good news, however, is purely relative because overall unemployment in
Glasgow is high at 15.5 per cent, with male unemployment at 21.6 per cent
and the rate of joblessness in some areas running at 30 per cent or more.
Much of Glasgow is still doing reasonably well, but the improvement of
recent years has not brought unemployment down to a level most people would
consider acceptable.
The continuing recession is having a depressing effect on morale. Mr Stuart
Gulliver, chief executive of the Glasgow Development Agency, says the task
of medium term development is made more difficult by the stodgy economic
climate. 'You go along to a company to offer assistance with improving the
skills of its workforce and you find employees being made redundant almost
while you are speaking to them.'
But the emphasis on Glasgow's long term recovery and the initiatives being
taken to accomplish it sometimes distract attention from the fact that the
city is a fundamentally vibrant place. Although its population is now less
than 700,000 and slowly dropping, it is the centre of services for an area
of more than 2.5m people, and Scotland's largest consumer market.
Being a centre of service industries may not have the prestige that Glasgow
once enjoyed as a big manufacturing centre, but manufacturing in the city
has been in decline since the second world war. Even 10 years ago some
100,000 people were employed in manufacturing in Glasgow while now the
number is 55,000.
Yet some of the survivors of that industrial holocaust are doing well. There
are now only two shipyards on the Clyde but both have virtually full order
books. Kvaerner Govan, the Norwegian-owned merchant ship building yard, last
year won orders worth Pounds 300m for four chemical tankers and with other
ships under construction has a full order book until 1995.
Across the Clyde, Yarrow, part of GEC, earlier his year won a Pounds 400m
contract to build three frigates for the Ministry of Defence. At Cathcart,
Weir Group, which had to be rescued from impending collapse in 1981, is
virtually unaffected by recession as one of the world's leading pump
manufacturers and is making rising and substantial profits.
However other engineering companies are doing less well: Barr &amp; Stroud, an
offshoot of Pilkington which makes optical equipment for defence, has halved
its workforce to under 1,000 in the past two years. The Rolls-Royce
components plant at Hillington has shed 750 jobs in the past year.
Glasgow is also a centre of food and drink processing, with a large
biscuit-making plant of United Biscuits and several whisky operations,
including important parts of United Distillers and the headquarters of Whyte
&amp; Mackay, as well as textile makers including Coats Viyella.
Both the GDA and the district council are anxious to attract new
manufacturers to Glasgow. However, they accept that manufacturing companies
are primarily attracted to the nearby new towns of East Kilbride and
Cumbernauld rather than Glasgow.
Nevertheless, a joint effort is being made by the GDA and the district
council to create factories on appealing sites with private sector help and
lure medium-sized manufacturing operations to the city.
The prime objective, however, is on expanding the service industries of the
city. Glasgow firms provide professional services such as legal work,
accountancy, advertising and public relations.
Glasgow is a second tier financial centre. Its branch of the International
Stock Exchange has the only remaining trading floor in Britain and Glasgow
is the headquarters of Allied Provincial, a chain of provincial stockbrokers
which operate all over Britain. The fund management company Murray Johnstone
has more than Pounds 3.4bn under management. The Clydesdale Bank which has
its headquarters in the city has been reviving steadily since 1987 when
Midland Bank sold it to National Australia Bank. However it recently shed
700 jobs at its head office, bringing staff numbers there down to 2,400, as
part of an efficiency programme to take full advantage of automation.
Last year, Glasgow became home to one of the FT 100 companies when Scottish
Power, formerly the South of Scotland Electricity Board, was privatised. It
too has been shedding staff as efficiencies are made.
Another significant development on the corporate front was the recent buyout
by its management of George Outram, publishers of The Herald, the west of
Scotland's leading daily newspaper, and the Glasgow Evening Times. Outram
was sold for Pounds 74m by Lonrho and is now called Caledonian Newspaper
Publishing.
Glasgow is the centre of the Scottish media industry and the home of
Scottish Television, a quoted company, which pulled off a coup by
successfully bidding only Pounds 2,000 to retain its franchise.
For several years the Scottish Development Agency and its successor, the
GDA, have worked with the private sector to improve office accommodation in
the centre of the city and attract companies needing a Scottish
headquarters, or even fully fledged head offices. Some 18 organisations
established offices in Glasgow between 1986 and 1991, promising a total of
7,300 jobs.
These included BP Exploration's headquarters for northern Europe (600 jobs
moving from southeast England), a British Airways tele-sales office
(creating 350 posts) and two offices of the Department of Social Security
(creating a total of 900 jobs).
However, 2,000 of the 7,300 promised jobs were in the Census Office for the
processing of the 1991 census of Britain; the luring of this office to
Glasgow was a considerable coup for the city, but the jobs are naturally
temporary, and numbers employed are now falling.
Worse, BP Exploration said this month that it was moving its Glasgow
operation to Aberdeen over the next year or so, at a cost to Glasgow of 350
jobs. The process of attracting incoming companies to Glasgow is now
virtually stalled by the recession and many of the jobs that have been
created are for women, so the policy has little direct effect on the high
male unemployment.
Glasgow has shown its customary energy in promoting itself as a tourist
destination based largely on the attractions of its cultural resources and
events. In 1990, 3m visitors came to Glasgow, the year it was European City
of Culture, a venture which created a positive net economic return to the
regional economy of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 14m.
Progress is thus being made but the high level of male unemployment is
shorthand for misery and frustration on the periphery of the city which the
enriching of the centre can only partially cure.
Professor Alan MacGregor of Glasgow University has a sober conclusion on
Glasgow's economic progress in the past few years. 'There has not been a
recovery in Glasgow's position, but the city has created a positive image
that is a base for recovery,' he says. 'What you can say is that we're in
better shape than we were before to move forward if the economy improves.'

FT  13 JUL 93 / Arts: Lessons from the low life - Mary Rose Beaumont reviews
Peter Howson in Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY ROSE BEAUMONT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may sound somewhat premature for an artist to have a major retrospective
at the age of 35, but Peter Howson has no difficulty whatever in filling the
vast halls of Glasgow's McLellan Galleries with astonishing conviction. The
earliest work in the exhibition is a small but vivid crucifixion; painted at
the precocious age of six, it is prophetic of the subject of many of his
mature paintings, in which a single figure is tied to a post, a humiliation
actually undergone by a schoolfriend of the young Howson. This unpleasant
event left an indelible memory of human cruelty which has never been
exorcised and is indeed one of the constant motifs in his work.
Howson attended the Glasgow School of Art from 1975-77. He did not flourish
and left, ironically, to join the Scottish Infantry, which confirmed his
early experience of male brutality, later recorded in several shocking
pictures. Before returning to the School of Art, he did various menial jobs
which gave him a unique insight into the low life of Glasgow, a fruitful
source of inspiration ever since. His repertoire of characters, observed
during those years, include boxers, dossers, derelicts and drinkers, all
failures and rejects of our society.
Scottish Expressionism came to the fore during the 1980s, and Howson, along
with other graduates of the Glasgow School of Art, sprang to prominence in
an exhibition called New Image Glasgow which alerted the world to a new,
feisty, urban-based art, inspired to an extent by German Expressionism, but
with a compassion for the underdog which was peculiar to Scotland.
Baudelaire would have been delighted with this late 20th century celebration
of 'the heroism of modern life'.
Howson has been accused of excessive caricature. I think exaggeration is a
better word, exaggeration of features and gestures to make his point: the
bully boys look more bestial, the depraved look more delinquent, and the
depressed look suicidal. Mob hysteria, such as at a football match, and Nazi
salutes given by those taunting a trussed and helpless victim, are warnings
against the kind of mindless violence with which we are becoming
increasingly familiar. So-called 'Patriots', as we know, are easily
transformed into right wing extremists.
Howson's most impressive achievements are his triptychs, which have rightly
been called apocalyptic. The world is his stage and human conflicts and
desires his subjects. Violence on a global scale is endemic in these works,
yet he can present sympathetically the predicament of a single individual:
in 'The Three Faces of Eve', 1990, the three panels trace the downfall of a
young woman from innocent childhood through the stew of a grotesquely
decadent nightclub to her degradation and probable death in a graveyard. One
is swept along by the narrative, marvelling at the technical skill with
which the artist has deployed the complex compositions.
Portraits are important to Howson. He has portrayed himself in many moods
and aspects, but perhaps his most sustained achievement is the set of 25
etchings entitled 'Saracen Heads', 1988, a gallery of exquisitely drawn
heads of types encountered in the Saracen pub close to his studio in
Glasgow's East End. A series of 'Gallowgate Guests', 1991, in mixed media on
paper, investigates another terrifying array of mostly evil-looking people,
many of whom, like the pig-faced patriot have appeared in the paintings (to
September 5).
At the Glasgow Print Studio Adrian Wiszniewski is showing a new suite of ten
prints in a variety of techniques entitled 'Sex and Matisse'. The prints
play on a variety of themes by or of Matisse - a bather, an odalisque, a
musical instrument in an interior and a photograph of the wheelchair-bound
old man directing an assistant (an odalisque up a ladder) on the placing of
his paper cut-outs. Wiszniewski also had in mind Madonna's book Sex, the
titles of his prints wittily playing on the crossover between artist and
artiste, between camp and vamp.
Wiszniewski has abandoned his erstwhile dreaming youths for wall paintings
covered with huge abstract marks made with a house painter's brush.
Cursively written neon signs give full rein to his visual jokes and puns,
such as 'If In Doubt, Use Black', a hoary art school cliche, or 'This Happy
Void', a phrase with which the artist aims to counteract the prevailing fin
de siecle gloom with bouncing optimism.
The most recent work is in cut and painted perspex. Here too, the titles are
important: 'Coffee and Cream' is a small white square set over a larger one
in 'Cafe au lait'. A set of glorious carmine rectangles arranged according
to the Fibonacci system is entitled 'Rosebud', a not so oblique reference to
Citizen Kane. These seem to me to be key works, perhaps a turning point in
Wiszniewski's career (to July 24).
The William Hardie Gallery is showing Some Very New Paintings by David
Hockney. The paintings are designated simply as 'The First (or Twenty First)
VN Painting', and what is VN about them is that they are brilliantly
coloured, almost entirely abstract paintings in the same mode as those
currently on show in the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition. The works stem
from Hockney's designs for Richard Strauss's Die Frau Ohne Schatten,
performed at Covent Garden last autumn. As the hero of the opera is Barak
the Dyer, Hockney conceived the settings in terms of colour, light and
texture, which has translated very effectively into easel paintings. Those
who think of Hockney as a consummate draughtsman and figurative painter will
hate these VN paintings, but those who are prepared to follow him onto the
stage will enjoy them for their lush ebullience (to August 27).

FT  22 JAN 94 / Arts: Cultural tug-of-war divides Scots - The row over
Scotland's new National Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The room was designed to seat 250; in the event, 1,000 turned up. University
lecturers in tweed jackets stood alongside old ladies in mackintoshes, young
women tending babies and at least one judge of the court of session at the
meeting earlier this week to protest against the decision by the National
Galleries of Scotland to locate a new gallery not in the Scottish capital,
but in Glasgow.
It was the climax of a controversy which has been the chief talking point of
Scotland's chattering classes since early December. Each day there have been
broadsides in the letters and features pages of The Scotsman. Last week its
Glasgow rival The Herald devoted four pages to the issue. Next week it will
be debated in the House of Lords.
The controversy involves not just art but Scottish nationalism and the
perpetual rivalry of Scotland's two biggest cities.
It concerns a plan to create a National Gallery of Scottish Art, intended to
tell the history of Scotland and its art. It will take paintings by Scottish
artists from two Edinburgh galleries, the National Gallery of Scotland on
The Mound, and the Gallery of Modern Art. It will also absorb the entire
Scottish National Portrait Gallery, also in Edinburgh, which will close. The
new institution will be built at Kelvingrove Park in Glasgow.
The idea of creating a National Gallery of Scottish Art was launched in 1991
by Timothy Clifford, the ebullient Englishman who is director of the
National Galleries of Scotland, and by Angus Grossart, the terse merchant
banker who is chairman of the galleries' trustees.
It sprang from a desire to relieve the serious shortage of space in the
Edinburgh galleries, which means that paintings by Scottish artists have to
be taken down to provide space for exhibitions, while hundreds of Scottish
paintings lie in store.
The Portrait Gallery's collection of paintings of leading Scotsmen and women
over the centuries would form the nucleus of the new gallery, blended with
other paintings by Scottish artists such as Raeburn, Wilkie and Cadell from
the National Gallery and the Gallery of Modern Art. It would tell the
history of Scotland visually. Landscape paintings would illustrate
Scotland's geology and topography.
At the time Clifford said Edinburgh was the most logical place for the new
gallery, but added: 'It is up to Glasgow to come up with wonderful
proposals. We are ready to be seduced.'
That is exactly what happened. Whereas Edinburgh reacted sluggishly, Glasgow
with typical assertiveness offered the trustees several locations, promised
to lend the new gallery some of its best paintings and commissioned
architects such as Sir Norman Foster and Terry Farrell to produce designs.
Glasgow consistently made the running: a consultants' study showed that on
economic grounds Glasgow was the best location: the sites were cheaper, the
population was bigger and the existing Kelvingrove art gallery and museum
had higher attendances than the Edinburgh galleries.
The ten trustees repeatedly postponed a decision. But in the end the
economic arguments for Glasgow, reinforced by the knowledge that the
trustees represent Scotland rather than Edinburgh (several of them come from
Glasgow) made Kelvingrove inevitable. It was announced on November 30.
People in Edinburgh reacted with horror to what had happened. The decision
meant that some of the best-loved paintings would leave Edinburgh for
Glasgow. Raeburn's famous picture of the Reverend Robert Walker skating on
Duddingston Loch - which the gallery uses as its logo - would go for some
years to Kelvingrove.
The rights and wrongs of a National Gallery of Scottish Art had been debated
intermittently since 1991. Now the arguments against it came pouring out.
They boil down to two.
First, the new institution would mean herding Scottish art into a ghetto. As
Julian Spalding, director of Glasgow's Art Galleries, said in 1991 (he has
since changed his mind) the most successful galleries in other countries try
to cross-fertilise the art of different nations rather than separating them
into compartments.
By the same token it would severely weaken the National Gallery. Though the
gallery has listed those Scottish paintings that will stay, art historian
Duncan Macmillan says the Scottish collections should be the heart of the
National Gallery. 'Without them it becomes the National Gallery of Nowhere
in Particular, or perhaps the International Gallery of Anywhere Else but
Scotland.'
Secondly, the new institution means destroying the Portrait Gallery, created
in 1889 and one of only three in the world. Paul Scott, a leading
campaigner, calls it one of the most treasured possessions of the Scottish
people: it should be kept intact and remain in the Scottish capital. It is
this which arouses the strongest feelings.
At this week's public meeting Clifford defended his plan and Spalding
pricked a few consciences when he asked: 'If the Portrait Gallery was
closing and if Edinburgh had been successful in the bid it made (to have the
new gallery) would you all be here tonight?'
Edinburgh campaigners say they do not object to a new gallery being built
somewhere else, even Glasgow, but with a different configuration. But they
voted overwhelmingly for the trustees to reconsider or resign. None of the
trustees was present.
Yet even if the trustees stick to their decision it is far from certain that
the new gallery will go ahead. The Scottish Office has said that it will not
contribute to the Pounds 20m cost. Glasgow may stand a better chance than
Edinburgh of qualifying for EU funding but this is far from certain.
Grossart talks of tapping private donors and getting money from the National
Lottery or the Millennium Fund. But it is difficult to believe that the
government, which will control those funds, would direct them to a project
which so many people oppose.
Increasingly eyes are turning to Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary. He has
the final say and could veto the scheme or order a review. To many people,
possibly including some of the trustees, that might come as a relief.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (4): Buildings for commerce - New offices spring up
to house the service sector economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR several years the private and public sectors have collaborated in
improving and expanding the office stock in the heart of Glasgow, as part of
the policy of making it a centre of service activities and attracting new
businesses.
The Glasgow office property market began taking off from 1987 as developers
became aware of the city's new potential. A surge of activity began as
developers rebuilt or heavily refurbished the office buildings in the
business core of the city around St Vincent Street.
Part of the pressure came from local businesses such as solicitors,
accountants, stockbrokers and advertising agencies who were expanding
rapidly and found that their existing offices were both too small and
inappropriate for the computer age.
The Scottish Development Agency, which in Glasgow was the forerunner of the
Glasgow Development Agency, had been trying for several years to persuade
developers to look at new sites in Glasgow. It had identified areas of
derelict or semi-derelict property adjacent to the core of the city to which
it envisaged the city's office area expanding, and thus attracting company
headquarters or large branch offices to Glasgow.
As Mr Ted Webster, senior partner of the chartered surveyors Richard Ellis,
used to point out in the late 1980s, improving the accommodation of
indigenous Glasgow businesses was essential to the process of attracting
incomers. 'You've got to have the local business community well-housed
before you can get many people to come in from outside,' he said.
From the late 1980s many buildings around St Vincent Street and West George
Street were refurbished or rebuilt, often behind their original facades if
these were subject to preservation orders. Office rents in the central
business area, which comprises about 8m sq ft of office space between George
Square and Charing Cross (the total rises to 12m sq ft including the Park
area immediately to the west), increased from about Pounds 8 per square foot
for space in prime locations in 1987 to reach a sustained average peak of
about Pounds 18 in 1989.
According to Mr David Rooney of the chartered surveyors Lambert Smith
Hampton, the market reached its zenith in that year, with some deals being
done at Pounds 20. It was not until the end of 1990 that the recession began
to be felt seriously in the Glasgow property market.
Now the market presents a more depressing picture. New development starts
have come to an end and Richard Ellis calculates that about 650,000 sq ft of
office space is available for rent, with a further 224,000 sq ft due for
completion before the end of the year.
Whereas the annual take-up of quality office space was running at 500,000 sq
ft in the late 1980s, it fell to 350,000 sq ft in 1991 and only 165,000 sq
ft had been let in the first five months of this year.
Mr Rooney says that Glasgow is experiencing the tail-end of the 1980s boom
as the last projects initiated in that period come to completion, and 'no
one has the appetite to start new construction on the gap sites'. Much of
the overhang consists of second hand office accommodation, 10 to 30 years
old, which has been vacated by businesses trading up to more modern
premises.
This accommodation will be difficult to shift for the time being, he
believes, as rents are being driven down by aggressive negotiators.
Yet people in the property industry are not as gloomy as one might expect.
Mr Webster says: 'It is not a sign of ill-health to have empty buildings. If
there wasn't any, people looking for space would go away again.' Glasgow, he
points out, traditionally has a stable office property market with demand
growing steadily because of the size of the city's hinterland and its large
potential workforce, but not outpacing supply, which grows because of the
relative ease with which new developments can get underway.
The largest single empty building, Tay House, which covers 160,000 sq ft
with a wing built on a bridge across the M8 motorway, would be suitable for
any company seeking a large amount of high quality space for immediate
occupation.
The decision of BP Exploration announced this month to leave its
headquarters in St Vincent Street in the next year or so will free more high
quality office space, although some space has already been taken by Abbey
National.
Mr Ken Campbell of Knight Frank &amp; Rutley says there is now 'a brake on the
market which I see running for the next 12 months. But we are not in free
fall: there is no resemblance here to London.'
The most significant new development in the Glasgow's office property scene
is the Broomielaw project. For years the business district has been
gradually expanding south from St Vincent Street towards the river Clyde.
The Broomielaw project leapfrogged straight to the riverfront; it involves
creating nearly 1m square feet of top quality office space in an area which
in 1987 consisted of semi-derelict warehouses and shops.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Nestle job sweetener in Dijon is a bitter taste for Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIJON is getting its own back on Glasgow. In an ironic reversal of Hoover's
switch of jobs from the French town to Glasgow, another multinational is to
close the bulk of its Scottish plant and indirectly move jobs to Dijon.
Nestle Rowntree, the Swiss-owned food conglomerate, said yesterday it would
close the chocolate bar production part of its plant in Glasgow over the
next two years with the loss of 550 jobs. The production of its Breakaway
and Blue Riband brands will be relocated to the company's Fawdon plant near
Newcastle upon Tyne.
As a result, the company will move UK production of its Lion bar from
Newcastle upon Tyne to its new Dijon plant where the European production of
Lion will be concentrated on a large, technically advanced production line.
Nestle Rowntree said it would look for a buyer for the 140-year-old Glasgow
plant, which would continue to make Gray Dunn chocolate biscuits. If a buyer
could not be found, the plant would be closed. The announcement came less
than a fortnight after Hoover's decision to shut its Dijon vacuum cleaner
plant and shift production to Glasgow.
Union leaders in Scotland last night denounced the Nestle Rowntree move as a
political manoeuvre to placate the French.
'I would need a lot of convincing that this is pure coincidence,' said Mr
John Glass, deputy divisional officer in Glasgow of the Union of Shop,
Distributive and Allied Workers, whose members will lose jobs as a result of
the Nestle Rowntree plant closure.
Mr Mick Casey, a company spokesman said: 'I cannot stress strongly enough
that there have been no political trade-offs. The Dijon connection is pure
coincidence. We have to make our products as competitively as possible.'
A spokesman for the parent company in Switzerland said: 'We are not in
business to satisfy the national ego of anybody. We are here to make money.'
He added that the decision to close the Glasgow plant originated in 1990
when the company closed its Noisiel plant outside Paris and moved to Dijon
to 'take advantage of economies of scale'.
Nestle Rowntree will shortly announce that it is moving the production of
Quality Street chocolate from Dijon to Halifax in the west riding of
Yorkshire. The company insists there will be no overall loss of jobs in the
complex shifting of production.
Mr Glass said the union was told of the Glasgow closure in a letter at 2pm
yesterday. 'There is no justifiable reason for closing the Glasgow plant. We
intend to fight it all the way,' he said.
Mr Graham Millar, the company's UK managing director, said: 'Everyone at
Glasgow has worked extremely hard to try to ensure the factory's viability
but Nestle Rowntree has to remain competitive and that means fully utilising
our more modern facilities at other locations.'
Nestle Rowntree will provide Pounds 250,000 in assistance to help their
Glasgow workers who are to lose their jobs.

FT  15 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Glasgow versus Glyndebourne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr THOMAS MCLAUGHLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read with interest David Murray's review of the new Glyndebourne
production of Mozart's Don Giovanni (Arts, July 12). The last time elements
of this audience voiced noisy disapproval also involved a Mozart piece -
Peter Sellars' version of Die Zauberflote. When this production came to
Glasgow in 1990, however, it received a most enthusiastic welcome at the
city's Theatre Royal.
It is to be hoped that director Deborah Warner will take heart from this. An
imaginative treatment of a much-loved Mozart masterpiece, even if
controversial, may find a more sympathetic reception from a different
audience.
Perhaps Ms Warner should persuade Glyndebourne Touring Opera to take her Don
Giovanni into its repertoire. I live in hope that she might measure the
reaction of the opera lovers of Glasgow against the louts of Glyndebourne.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (1): Alive and kicking - After stemming the decline
of the 1960s and 1970s, Glasgow is fighting to avoid the worst of the
present recession. At the same time, it is trying to create and consolidate
a new basis for its future prosperity
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GLASGOW last winter formally sent into retirement its famous slogan
Glasgow's Miles Better, which, enlivened with the cheery face of Mr Happy,
had for a decade been pasted to the side of buses in both Glasgow and
London, and, translated into foreign languages, taped proudly to the luggage
of Glaswegians travelling abroad.
The decision to drop the slogan was a symbolic moment of transition. It
showed that Glasgow thinks the world has now accepted that it has pulled
itself out of the decline to which it seemed to be condemned in the 1960s
and 1970s, and that it is time for the next stage in the city's recovery.
Yet there seems to be a widespread realisation in the city that the next
stage is not likely to be particularly easy, nor are its outlines very
clear. The greater sobriety of the new slogan, Glasgow's Alive, (said to be
more convenient than its predecessor for putting on to almost any document
originating in Glasgow) has a durability that may be required during the
long haul ahead.
The revival of Glasgow has so far been one of the success stories of urban
regeneration in Britain. In the 1970s the economic base of this once great
shipbuilding and manufacturing city was declining at an alarming rate; its
population fell by 33 per cent between 1961 and 1981, not just through
organised dispersal to new towns but by emigration motivated by despair. The
city had an intimidating reputation for grime and crime.
A turning point came in 1975 when the new Strathclyde regional council
persuaded the government to abandon the creation of another Scottish new
town and divert the money to the regeneration of the decayed east end of the
city. Gradually a coalition of forces - the Scottish Development Agency, the
Labour controlled regional and district councils and the private sector -
developed a strategy for recovery, which involved pouring in very large
quantities of public money. Much of this came from a Pounds 350m EC
integrated development grant negotiated by Strathclyde regional council.
Glasgow was perforce to become a largely post-industrial city, concentrating
on developing its service activities. The initial aim was to improve the
centre of the city, not least by property development, new retail complexes
and extensive stone-cleaning, making the centre one of the main generators
of wealth.
Glasgow would also exploit its already strong cultural assets to become a
tourist destination and develop its distinguished university base to become
an exporter of graduates and knowledge.
What made the policy work was the existence of a form of collective
leadership that was lacking in Liverpool, a city with comparable problems,
which took such a different path to Glasgow in the 1980s. Glasgow's Labour
politicians became almost Conservative in their fiscal rectitude and grasp
of commercial reality; the city's business leaders are committed people who
for the most part live in the city rather than escaping to the countryside
in the evening.
The landmarks of revival are the Glasgow's Miles Better slogan which struck
a happy note with Glaswegians when it was launched in 1983 ('people just
flooded into the City Chambers to pick up the stickers,' says Mrs Jean
McFadden, leader of the district council); the Glasgow Garden Festival of
1988; and the city's year as European City of Culture in 1990, which
culminated in the opening of the Pounds 28.5m Royal Concert hall.
Yet despite all the achievements, unemployment in Glasgow never dropped
below 14 per cent in the recent upturn and has lately risen to 15.5 per
cent, with no less than 21.6 per cent of the male workforce out of work.
Manufacturing is still declining despite the fact that Glasgow has some good
engineering and shipbuilding companies: it now occupies only 16 per cent of
the work force.
The population is still falling, although the drop from 765,000 in 1981 to
654,000 in the 1991 census may have been exaggerated by as much as 35,000 by
poll tax non-payers not registering in the census.
Above all, while the centre and the west end of Glasgow are now rather
smart, and surrounding areas like the east end, Govan and even the Gorbals
are improving, there are still great areas of wretched accommodation,
poverty and misery in the peripheral areas of Easterhouse, Drumchapel,
Castlemilk and Pollok.
Last year, the Scottish Development Agency was wound up and replaced with a
network of local enterprise companies under the umbrella of the new Scottish
Enterprise. Glasgow gained the Glasgow Development Agency, which has a
budget this year of Pounds 67m to spend on training, property and
environmental improvement and assistance to business.
Mr Stuart Gulliver, its thoughtful, chain-smoking chief executive, exudes
what the agency calls the 'new mature realism' about Glasgow. 'Any
turnaround of a city like Glasgow takes about 25 years, a full generation.
So far we've done 10 years and transformed the urban landscape, laying a
patina of improvement across the city. There's far more to be done.'
He is frustrated that the recession, which came late to Glasgow, is putting
a brake on development and forcing businesses to concentrate on survival
rather than long-term improvement. He admits that the agency's prime target
group among the city's 50,000 unemployed has to be the top 30 per cent -
'the walking wounded who have their work ethic intact'.
He fears that the bottom 30 per cent - 'second or third generation
unemployed, living in a world of drugs and crime' - are beyond reach of an
organisation like the GDA.
About these people Mr Robin Boyle, formerly at Strathclyde university's
centre of planning, wrote recently: 'Glasgow's poor are simply no longer
part of the city. In economic, political or social terms, their alienation
from urban life is almost complete.
'Years of isolation bred hopelessness; the reponse of the very poorest has
been to withdraw into a personal world of survival, far removed from city
centre renewal, waterfront housing and new shopping centres.'
Mrs McFadden, who recently replaced the powerful Mr Pat Lally as Labour
leader on the council, voices a similar anxiety. 'I've always said Glasgow's
Miles Better only referred to the centre of the city. It was a sick joke for
people living in damp houses in Easterhouse.'
Like many leading people in the city she expresses a longing for a revival
of manufacturing in Glasgow. The great expansion of jobs in services, she
says, is 'very worrying because these jobs do not pay as well as those in
manufacturing, tend to involve women rather than men and, especially in
tourism, are vulnerable to recession'.
Where does Glasgow go now? The city council and the GDA have formed a strong
partnership which will continue the strategy of developing service
industries such as tourism, and attracting more companies to set up branch
or head offices in the city, and, it is hoped, factories.
Mr Gulliver says a long term policy of upgrading skills and performance
throughout the businesses of the city is essential.
Michael Kelly, who as Lord Provost launched the Glasgow's Miles Better
campaign and now runs a public relations agency while also advising other
British cities on how to stage recovery, believes a big new initiative is
needed to succeed the garden festival and the city of culture ventures.
'I've suggested we celebrate the ending of World War two, possibly in
conjunction with other European cities'.
He rejects the idea that this approach to reviving a city is purely cosmetic
and does not produce lasting effects. 'Why do women use cosmetics? Because
they are effective.'
But the calm Mrs McFadden says Glasgow no longer needs spectacular new
events to follow up the garden festival and the city of culture year. 'We
don't need a big event every so often any more. A lot of the groundwork of
recovery has been done. What Glasgow needs now is constant marketing to
proclaim our advantages and attract both visitors and companies.'

FT  02 MAY 92 / Arts: All eyes on Mayfest - A preview of the Glasgow
galleries participating in this month's festivities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE few years since its inception, Glasgow's Mayfest has become an
important fixture in the British cultural calendar. Natural civic pride and
rivalry apart, it is hardly yet the equal of Edinburgh as an international
festival of the arts, but who would now say, with enthusiasm on the one
side, and complacency on the other, that a full reversal of the relative
positions was impossible?
So far as the visual arts are concerned, the issue is already nicely
balanced. Glasgow may not yet boast the major exhibitions which Edinburgh's
museums have always the good sense to offer at festival time, with the city
full of visitors. But that effort is usually qualified by a wish to distance
it from the Festival as such, opening particular shows well beforehand and
running them on long afterwards. As for the Festival authorities, their
current advance literature is innocent of any reference to the visual arts
at all.
But Mayfest has always integrated the visual element into its programme.
This year there may be no single outstanding offering, but across the
spectrum, from public to private, some 15 galleries are participating, with
all but two of them open by this weekend, and a further eight listed in
association.
To try the flavour, I visited four shows, one of which, at the Collins
Gallery (22 Richmond Street: until June 6), with the opening due on Friday
night, was on Thursday morning but a flurry of carpentry, paint and
wallpaper and a gleam in the artist's eye. 'Access', by Jim Buckley, is to
be an installation that takes further the images he first developed in his
sculpture. This he based on the old peepshow principle, making boxes with
interiors that proposed their own imaginative scale and reality.
Here, in one darkened gold-papered room, Buckley has set into the wall four
large display transparencies taken from the boxes he showed in Kunst Europa
in Germany last year, the images imagined, richly decorated, sanctuary-like
interiors. The other room, white and light, holds seven peepholes through
which to view photographic details of actual architectural interiors found
in the city itself.
Cyril Gerber was the first dealer to bring modern and contemporary art to
Glasgow, and he stands naturally at the heart of Mayfest. At his personal
gallery (148 West Regent Street: until May 23) he shows Benjamin Creme, a
Glaswegian painter now 70 but long neglected. The work here is of the 1940s,
when Creme was taken up by the emigre Polish painters Josef Herman and
Jankel Adler then living in Glasgow, and the 1950s when he was in London and
one of the circle of Minton, MacBryde, Colquhoun and others. The figure
drawings and paintings are especially interesting, sophisticated in their
modernism, after Braque and Matisse, yet direct and personal in feeling and
character.
Up the road at his Compass Gallery (178 West Regent Street: until May 21),
Gerber is showing the recent work of a most distinctive Scottish
print-maker, Elspeth Lamb. With her 'Cornerstones', she offers us the fruit
of a recent visit to Mexico where she was particularly taken both by the
popular festivals of the Day of the Dead and the ancient architectural
carvings and hieroglyphs of Chichen Itza, Teotihuacan and Quetzalcoatl.
But what makes her show remarkable is not so much the imagery as the medium
by which she has developed and quite literally expressed it. Making the
paper herself, saturating the pulp with pigment, she at once simplifies and
concentrates the image while impressing it into the very fabric of her
material. The paper is itself the image: and rich and dense and beautiful
too.
The Transmission Gallery (28 King Street) is a co-operative run by a
changing committee of five artists to show not their own but the work of
artists they would wish to see. Throughout May it offers a group show - a
collaborative relief-cum-lightwork by Paul Maguire and Simon Starling,
consisting of three isometric cubes, small, medium and large, described by
white neon tubes; four cibachrome prints of a leather holster, by Michael
McDonough; and a set of of ironically dispassionate photographs of taped and
sand-bagged windows, taken in Zagreb last November by Donald Urquhart.
Small, black and white, the format insistent in its simple frontality, the
plastic bags oddly disturbing in the way they are heaped and trussed, they
are rather impressive.

Northwest Airlines is to end its non-stop daily service between Glasgow and
Boston from October 25. It says it has been losing money because of excess
capacity on transatlantic services from Glasgow and low yields due to
insufficent business passengers.
Northwest's withdrawal after 14 years is the second blow to transatlantic
services from Glasgow within weeks. Last month American Airlines said it
would not operate its daily Chicago service between November and mid-May.
Northwest offers alternative services for Scottish travellers from London
Gatwick and Schiphol, Amsterdam, connecting with Air UK.

<TEXT>
You are in Glasgow, with an hour between meetings. What to do?
Dr William Hunter has an assured place in medical history as a famous
obstetrician and the first great teacher of anatomy in Britain. Even Adam
Smith, Edmund Burke and Edward Gibbon went to his lectures. His wide-ranging
collections of specimens, coins and medals, and his fine library of books
and manuscripts, have enriched the University of Glasgow, while his
paintings form the nucleus of the Hunterian Art Gallery, one of the choicest
of all university collections.
Thanks are due to the doctor for the three magnificent paintings by the
incomparably subtle Jean-Simeon Chardin: A Lady Taking Tea, The Cellar Boy
and The Scullery Maid. But the real strength of the Hunterian focuses on the
turn of this century, and the influential Glasgow architect and designer
Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the American-born artist James McNeill
Whistler.
The windows and front door from the long-demolished Mackintosh House in
Glasgow were incorporated into the facade of the new museum in 1980, and its
four principal interiors carefully reconstructed as Mackintosh originally
conceived them. Bequests of furniture and other applied arts, drawings and
designs have made the museum the pre-eminent Mackintosh archive.
The Whistler holding - the contents of his studio at his death - comprises
some 80 oils, including 11 full-length portraits, 120 pastels and several
hundred prints and drawings. Its only rival is the Freer Gallery in
Washington.

<HEAD>Samford Professor Sought In Death Of Debate Team Member</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A university professor wanted in the
stabbing death of a student he coached on the debate team wrote a
letter admitting to the killing, police said.
   A murder warrant was issued Monday for William Lee Slagle, 42, a
Samford University professor sought in the Sept. 21 slaying of
20-year-old Rex B. Copeland, Shelby County Sheriff Buddy Glasgow
said.
   Authorities received a handwritten letter Monday in which Slagle
admitted killing Copeland, Glasgow said.
   ``He sort of apologized about what had happened,'' he said.
   The pair had argued about preparation for a debate in Iowa,
Glasgow said. Slagle ``didn't feel like he was studying enough,''
the sheriff said.
   ``I know these folks are serious about their debating and it
could lead to a heated argument,'' Glasgow said, ``but it doesn't
sound like something worth killing for, does it? I think there'd be
more to it.''
   Copeland was found dead in his apartment Sept. 22. He had been
stabbed several times in the chest.
   Investigators have been trying for about a week to question
Slagle, and have been told he left town, Glasgow said. His mother
lives in San Antonio and he has a brother in Dallas, the sheriff
said.

<HEAD>Jumbo Jet Diverted Because Of Fear Of Luggage Tampering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Toronto-bound jumbo jet with 214 people on board
made an emergency landing at Glasgow Airport after a passenger said
she thought someone had tampered with her luggage in the hold,
police and airline officials said today.
   ``It was a false alarm,'' said Glasgow Police Inspector Robert
Nicholson. ``There was a bit of concern, but everything turned out
to have a happy ending.''
   The British Airways jet took off from London's Heathrow Airport
at 4:45 p.m. Friday and had been airborne an hour when a Canadian
passenger told a flight attendant she was worried that her checked
luggage had been tampered with before she boarded a connecting BA
flight in Cairo, the airline said.
   Airline spokesman Bill Burchill said the flight attendant
informed the captain, who decided to turn back and make an emergency
landing.
   The Boeing 747 jet was about 30 minutes over the Atlantic at the
time and had to dump fuel before touching down in Glasgow at 7:45
p.m., he said.
   After the jet landed, inspector Nicholson said all baggage on the
plane was isolated, examined ``and found to be in order.'' The
airline said there were 197 passengers and a crew of 17.
   The plane took off from Glasgow at 9:35 p.m. without the woman
and her two companions, who spent the night at a local hotel to help
police complete their inquiries, Burchill said.
   The woman, who was not identified, and her friends were expected
to fly to Toronto today on a British Airways flight from London, he
said.
   ``The woman felt a certain amount of disquiet,'' Burchill said.
``We have no idea at all why she waited until the plane was
airborne'' to inform the airline of her concern.
   Flight 093 landed safely in Toronto, he said.

FT  05 JAN 94 / Rifkind attacks Scottish gallery plan for Glasgow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary and Edinburgh MP, yesterday joined
objections to last month's decision by the National Galleries of Scotland to
move much of its collection to a new gallery in Glasgow.
He said that aspects of the plan were 'unacceptable and do not deserve
public support'.
The National Galleries of Scotland intends to create a gallery of Scottish
art in Glasgow. It would display many of the paintings by Scottish artists
now in the National Gallery and the National Gallery of Modern Art in
Edinburgh. It would also feature all the paintings in the Scottish National
Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh, as well as pictures not currently on display.
When the new gallery was proposed in 1991 there was no suggestion of it
being anywhere but Edinburgh. But Glasgow offered accommodation more cheaply
and consultants said a Glasgow gallery would receive more visitors.
The plan has been attacked by leading figures in Edinburgh. Mr Ian Lang, the
Scottish secretary, has said the government will not contribute to its
Pounds 20m cost.
Mr Rifkind attacked the plan because it would entail removing the most
important Scottish paintings from the National Gallery and closing the
Scottish National Portrait Gallery.

FT  01 DEC 93 / Arts: Glasgow wins Scottish gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As anticipated, Glasgow has won the battle with Edinburgh to house the new
National Gallery of Scottish Art. It will rise in Kelvingrove Park and
should be ready in time for the Millennium. Indeed Millennium money,
directed via the national lottery, will be expected to provide much of the
Pounds 25m cost.
The National Gallery of Scottish Art will provide a home for a national
collection of pictures, decorative arts, and other objects associated with
the Scottish heritage. It will give expression to Scottish national feeling
and be the Scotland's project to celebrate the Millennium.
Glasgow won the fiercely fought contest with Edinburgh for the site mainly
because a consultants report suggested it would attract more visitors, some
750,000 a year. It was also successful because its local council fought
harder for the project. At the start, Edinburgh actually wanted to charge
the trustees Pounds 3m for their preferred local site, Dean Lodge, opposite
the Gallery of Modern Art.
In response Glasgow offered a choice of five locations, all free, and
promised loans to the new Gallery of its Charles Rennie Mackintosh
interiors, and works by the early 20th artists, the Glasgow Boys. It also
suggested that a site in Glasgow might attract an EC grant of Pounds 10m.
Among the architects with plans for the new Museum is Richard Rodgers.
Timothy Clifford, director of the National Galleries, welcomed the choice.
'It will be the most exciting development for the visual arts in Scotland.'
He will use the extra gallery space to show some of the 70 per cent of stock
usually kept in the vaults. However paintings by the leading Scottish
artists, such as Ramsay and Raeburn, will still hang in the National Gallery
on the Mound in Edinburgh.
The choice of Kelvingrove puts a question mark over the future of the
National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. It will be expected to provide many
of its most popular pictures, and might seek a new role as a gallery devoted
to photography, sculpture or architecture.

FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (11): Reaching for the stars - Stewart
Dalby asks whether more hotels are needed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE face of it, Cardiff seems to have plenty of hotels.
If you emerge from Central station and look skywards slightly to the right,
your eyes are met by the masthead of the Holiday Inn (182 rooms). It is
unusual to see a Holiday Inn in a British city centre: they tend to be built
on the periphery of towns, close to motorways.
Two hundred yards from the Holiday Inn, past the ice rink, is the
International Hotel (143 rooms), built by Brent Walker at a cost of Pounds
7.5m, and opened last September.
If, instead of crossing St Mary's Street to the Holiday Inn in Mill lane,
you turn left down St Mary's Street, you quickly come to the Royal Hotel (63
rooms). Continue past St David's Hall, and you come to the Angel Hotel (91
rooms). Situated between Cardiff Castle and the Arms Park rugby ground, the
Angel describes itself as the city's premier hotel.
Close by is the Park Hotel (119 rooms) and the Crest Hotel (157 rooms).
Farther out, near to the motorway, are the Post House (150 rooms) and the
Moat House (144 rooms).
All of these are three- or four-star hotels. Most could be described as new
'business' or old 'town' hotels. They all charge between Pounds 50 and
Pounds 80 a night.
If a couple of places not mentioned are included, the total number of
bedrooms in quality hotels is around 1,000 to 1200. If one were to include
two-star hotels, Cardiff probably has some 6,000 rooms available.
How much accommodation does a city need? Albeit a capital city, though one
which is not yet an established business-and-services centre, nor on the
well-mapped circuit for cultural and heritage tourists? For the moment, the
answer would seem to be: about what it has got.
The occupancy rate of the Holiday Inn, for example, is 70 per cent, spread
through the week. It is full of business people during weekdays, while
weekends are a moveable feast. If there happens to be a rugby international
at Cardiff Arms park, the hotel is full to overflowing; if there is not, it
can be empty.
According to Jack Nicholas, general manager of the Holiday Inn, a good
weekend trade was beginning to build in family tourists taking advantage of
heavily discounted room prices. But this was thwarted by the Gulf war and
the recession. The past few months have seen a decline in weekend bookings.
Most of Cardiff's other quality hotels probably have occupancy rates similar
to that of the Holiday Inn, though the International Hotel has an occupancy
rate of 50 per cent, being a new hotel still building up business.
If supply seems to be roughly in line with current demand, the situation
could soon change, even though a Copthorne hotel is being built, for Cardiff
has aspirations to become both an important business-and-services centre and
a cultural tourist city, in the manner of York, Chester or even Glasgow.
For most people, the transformation to a services or business city is linked
with the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. When the barrage is built
across the bay, Cardiff could become a maritime city with some 5m sq ft of
extra office space, many tourist and leisure facilities, and 30,000 new jobs
in buildings that will be put up on what is now largely derelict land. The
development corporation believes it will be 10 to 15 years before these
targets are realised.
Before then, other developments could ensure a greater demand for hotel
rooms. Opposite the International Hotel is the half-finished World Trade
Centre, being developed by Brent Walker. Technical problems have delayed its
completion. But with a city grant and a soft loan from the European
Investment Bank, it should now be finished by the middle of next year.
It will have exhibition space and conference facilities for 5,000 people.
Brent Walker also bought the ice rink in 1989. It has managed to change its
use designation (though it is home to a successful ice-hockey team, which
will continue to use it), and it can now be covered over and used, for
example, for rock concerts. It seats 4,000. Despite Brent Walker's well
publicised financial problems of the past year, these projects are
proceeding, and will mean a greater demand for hotel space.
So, too, may the efforts being made by Cardiff Marketing, a private company
supported by local councils and the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation. The
thought underlying Cardiff Marketing's efforts is that, if Glasgow can be
publicised into life, then why not Cardiff? It is, after all, a capital city
with a rich cultural identity.
It is estimated that 2m visitors went to Cardiff last year, but fewer than
100,000 went to tourist centres for information. The potential is therefore
considerable. The city may even get a five-star hotel.

FT  25 AUG 92 / Arts: Life, near-death, sin and wickedness - Glasgow
Exhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY ROSE BEAUMONT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ART Gallery and Museum, Kelvingrove, Glasgow, celebrates John Bellany's
50th birthday with a sumptuous exhibition entitled 'A Long Night's Journey
into Day' (until Sunday). Bellany has created his own legend from the time
when, as a student at the Edinburgh College of Art, he hung his paintings on
the railings outside the Royal Scottish Academy as a protest against the
prevailing stuffiness inside. His art and his life are inextricably bound
up, and he has acted out his life on the canvas as tempestuously as did Van
Gogh. The work is the man and vice versa.
The exhibition is divided into three parts. The first room consists of 18
oil paintings from the 1970s announcing the themes which have consumed him
throughout his life: sin and guilt, stemming from his strict Calvinist
upbringing, and man's innate wickedness, with which he was confronted on a
visit to Buchenwald in 1967.
In these paintings, Bellany's chief theatre of operation is the bed, upon
which birth, sex and death are enacted, usually by surrogates  - symbolic
creatures nearly all drawn from the sea, reflecting his childhood in the
fishing village of Port Seton, Lothian. Lobsters and skates perform
unnatural acts with a peculiar joylessness; a dog is ensconced in the lap of
a naked woman who sits on a sofa resembling a deliquescent lump of meat  -
shades of Francis Bacon. 'You're 30 Today, John' is a lugubrious comment on
la comedie humaine, the shrouded figure of the artist supported by a fish
and a monkey.
The next room is the kernel of the exhibition. By 1984 he had become
seriously ill, though he never ceased painting, sustained by his wife Helen,
whose calm strength is celebrated in an iconic portrait of a modern madonna.
By 1987 he shows himself holding a watch: time is clearly running out. The
following year he underwent a life-saving liver transplant. The watercolours
he painted of his post-operative self, oxygen-masked, tubed and stitched,
are emotionally raw and profoundly moving.
The third room is alight with optimism. 'You're 50 Today, John' epitomises
the distance travelled in the intervening 20 years. The man is substantial,
instead of shrinking, and saturated blues and oranges replace rancid greens
and yellows. Bellany affirms his faith in painting as a means of portraying
ultimate truths, aligning himself in the tradition of the Old Masters, such
as Rembrandt, Titian, Rubens and Delacroix, whom he has never ceased to
revere.
He returns in 1992 to his roots in Port Seton, reworking themes first
painted in the 1960s of fish gutting and curing, now celebrated in radiant
colours. A sardonic sense of humour, and a lively sense of the absurd,
redeems the lushness of the imagery from any danger of sentimentality.
Tony Cragg's sculpture is being exhibited at the Centre for Contemporary
Arts (ex Third Eye Centre) and at the Tramway. Cragg is probably the most
form-inventive sculptor working on the international scene and the scope and
variety is admirably demonstrated in the echoing barn-like space of the
Tramway.
The earlier pieces are reassuringly familiar  - the jostling, wall-mounted
crowd scene made from bits of coloured plastic of 1984, the hugely oversized
eyebath in cast iron of 1986, the bronze turnip-lantern heads, cast from
sugar beets (1987) and the elegant 'Minster,' a post-modern version of the
Towers of Trebizond, which graced the roof-terrace of the Hayward Gallery in
1987. Thereafter, we are towed along in the wake of his fertile imagination.
Cragg represented Britain at the Venice Biennale in 1988 and won the Turner
Prize in the same year; yet the vast majority of his exhibitions have been
outside the UK and Glasgow is the only venue for this show. Cragg's declared
aim is 'the creation of objects that do not exist in the natural or in the
functional world, which can reflect and transmit information and feelings
about the world and my own existence.' Preconceptions as to how we perceive
the world about us are thereby overturned.
There is no hierarchy of materials in Cragg's work. He is equally at home in
bronze, steel, glass, wood, stone and plastic, but in each case any
suggestion of the mimetic is undermined by a certain perversity in the use
of that material. 'Branching Form,' in steel, is like a diagram of blood
vessels in three dimensions; 'Bodicea,' in wood and steel, resembles a sea
slug heaving itself over an object on the sea bed.
He uses gigantism to make a pyramid of rubber stamps in steel, ironically
entitled 'Subcommittee', and a Sony Walkman evolves from a three-foot-square
block of black limestone, alternately shiny and matt, with all the knobs,
leads, grooves and batteries clearly delineated.
Though resolutely committed to modernism, Cragg can still indulge in
art-historical appropriation. 'Spyrogyra' is a spiral of spiked steel on
which are impaled a number of odd-shaped, sand-blasted bottles, a somewhat
threatening reference to Duchamp's 'Bottle Rack' of 1913. The difference
lies in the opposition of Cragg's carefully assembled piece and Duchamp's
cheeky 'found object,' presented as a work of art because it was declared to
be so by the artist.
Perhaps the most accessible pieces are the traditional bronzes, huge
distorted blow-ups of laboratory equipment yielding zoomorphic and
anthropomorphic associations which allow the viewer, as Cragg would like,
'to get involved with the sculpture.' The exhibition runs until September 6.

FT  19 MAY 93 / People: Englishman goes to market for Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
For the first time, an Englishman is to become chairman of what remains of
the Glasgow stock exchange.
Anthony Vine-Lott, 45-year-old managing director of Barclays Stockbrokers,
is to succeed Robert White of the Edinburgh stockbroker Bell Lawrie White as
chairman of the Scottish regional advisory group of the London Stock
Exchange.
Glasgow is one of the more active of the dwindling number of regional
branches of the Stock Exchange. It has the only firms of market-makers
outside London (two of them) and handles most settlements for Glasgow-based
stockbrokers, such as Allied Provincial.
The exchange, which employs about 20 people, claims to be second only to
London in the volume of business it handles.
Meanwhile, Barclays Stockbrokers is probably the biggest user of the Glasgow
exchange. It employs about 300 people in the city and does all share
transactions for retail customers of the bank's branches, as well as
handling back office work for a number of regional stockbrokers.
It claims to transact 10 per cent of all retail business in the UK.
Vine-Lott is one of the new breed of stockbrokers who came into the business
from the technology side rather than from dealing, having been a senior
executive of Wang UK in the early 1980s.
He helped design an electronic dealing system for Barclays de Zoete Wedd
before becoming md of Barclays Stockbrokers in 1988.
But he only works two days a week in Glasgow, spending the rest of the week
in London, and his home is in Kent.
He sees the Scottish regional advisory group as 'a local lobby group
sponsored by the exchange' which should work as a conduit to pass
information to members of the stock exchange and to obtain their views to
pass back to London. He wants to widen the role of the committee to
represent the views of quoted Scottish companies and Scottish fund managers
on stock exchange matters.

FT  24 DEC 94 / Arts: An old flame from Portugal - Antony Thorncroft salutes
Lisbon, bowing out as this year's European City of Culture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
So it's farewell Lisbon, 1994, hello Luxembourg, 1995. The European City of
Culture moves with the calendar and the artistic flame has been passed on
from Portugal's capital to the Grand Duchy.
Cities of Culture, an EC institution, attract little criticism; they also
attract little interest. It would take a cultural junkie to remember which
city glowed with creativity in 1989 (Paris) or 1992 (Madrid). Only Glasgow
(1990) and Antwerp (1993) managed to change their popular image by having a
heavy attack of the arts.
In Lisbon, the ending of the cultural year affected citizens in two ways: a
small group scattered around the Teatro San Carlos for the worthy
congratulatory speeches - while thousands milled on the banks of the Tagus
listening to Portugal's top rock band, watching fireworks, and patronising
the bars that were kept open all night.
In the immediate future there will always be a small audience for the high
arts in Lisbon. Venues which hummed with performances for most of 1994 will
return to weekly concerts and the short opera and dance seasons, but the
audience will grow now there is an infrastructure in place to support it.
The main tangible benefit is the way the authorities were forced to invest
in new, or revamped, theatres, concert halls and museums.
There were the usual sulks between a right-wing government and a left-wing
city council about footing the bill, but in the end more than Pounds 30m was
conjured up. The funds did not permit any splashy new structures, but the
main concert hall, the Coliseu, now gleams with the intimacy of a musical
bull ring and two of Lisbon's main museums, of modern art in the Chaido and
of Old Masters along by the river, are marvellous examples of how old
buildings can be decked inside with modern trimings without destroying the
historic exterior structure.
As Portugal, seaward-gazing and introspective, gradually absorbs European
culture, the refurbished buildings will tempt a larger audience. Not
surprisingly, with all the special exhibitions, there were 50 per cent more
gallery visitors during 1994. In all, about 1.5m tickets were sold for more
than 1,000 events, even though the organisers had to reduce seat prices by
20 per cent to attract decent audiences.
There were the usual grouses: that too much money was spent bringing foreign
creative artists to Lisbon and not enough on encouraging local talent; that
the events charmed the sophisticated minority while the man on the tram was
untouched. But visits from orchestras such as the LSO and the Philharmonia,
the Concertgebouw and the Czech Philharmonic; from dance companies such as
Pina Bausch and Merce Cunningham; plus the opportunity to see for the first
time opera productions of Peter Grimes, The Makropoulus Case, and Julio
Cesare must have opened the ears and eyes of many first generation EC
Portuguese.
There were setbacks, such as the cancellation of an exhibition by Portugal's
leading artist, the London based Paula Rego, and a poorly received Carmen.
Perhaps the biggest row was over the poor reception given to Wim Wenders'
movie Lisbon Story. The city wanted the best European director to capture in
fiction this significant moment in the history of Lisbon. Wenders was
tempted with a budget reported to be in excess of Pounds 1m, but produced an
over-long work which was as unimaginative as it was self-regarding. Shooting
tourist Lisbon, he missed exciting developments such as the rediscovery of
Lisbon's early 19th-century architectural grandeur in the 'Seventh Hill'
sector.
Lisbon worked as a city of culture because it gave a new angle on a
little-known but fascinating capital. Lisbon is at its best when being
itself, untouched by other-Europe: in the Museu dos Azulejos, attached to a
spectacular convent with a church, in which secular 18th-century scenes of
Lisbon in blue and white tiles compete with gilt baroque for wall space; and
in the special exhibition of fado at the Museu de Etnologia.
This describes how the spontaneous music of the street, the disregarded,
despairing 19th-century voice of the brothels and the beggars, became
gentrified as a tourist attraction in the 20th century. Its climax comes in
a darkened room where the greatest fado singer of all, Amalia Rodrigues,
sings of abandonment.
It is a cultural experience of unrelenting power and passion, and quite a
contrast to the formality which attaches itself to these cultural years. The
statistical guru John Myerscough has evaluated the impact of cultural
capitals. It is mixed: in Dublin only 5 per cent of those asked could
remember an event they had attended; in Glasgow, 61 per cent of citizens
voted it a success. Lisbon is happy that 48 per cent of the locals came down
in favour; 32 per cent against.
Capitals of culture are a good idea, but the idea alone is not enough. They
need planning, a rationale, and money, too. They work best in over-looked
cities like Lisbon.

FT  20 AUG 92 / Arts: Walter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE most ardent supporter of C P Taylor would not claim Walter is one of his
best plays. One reason why it is included in the tribute to him in this
year's festival may be that the work pays homage to his native Glasgow.
Glasgow did not encourage Taylor as a playwright. It was the Traverse
Theatre in Edinburgh that discovered him. Afterwards he moved south to
Northumberland, where he wrote his best work. Still, Glasgow was a formative
influence.
Taylor was born there in 1927, the son of a Jewish family which had fled
from tsarist Russia. The Walter of the play is based on a music hall
comedian called Walter Jackson (originally Jacobson). Jackson, like Taylor,
had Jewish parents. He began performing in Glasgow in 1932.
After the war, Jackson became relatively well known beyond music hall. He
appeared in television soaps and did straight acting at the Glasgow
Citizens'. But just as his new career was taking off he died aged 60 in
1977.
The version that appears in a collection of the seven Taylor plays being
performed at this year's festival takes less than an hour to read, but
stretches to two and a half hours on-stage. For all the love and care that
have gone into Hamish Glen's production at the St Bride's Centre, it remains
heavy going.
Walter, the music hall comedian, is left far behind. The play is about the
sex life of a man who wonders how far he remains Jewish. He has left a
Jewish wife for a Jewish mistress, then abandoned her and is now living on
the banks of Loch Lomond with a young Gentile girl who speaks with a Geordie
accent. She wants him to move to Northumberland because the Scots do not
like the English crossing their border and Scotland is full of 'bloody Jews,
communists and film directors'.
The sex life does not seem very satisfactory; nor is the play. There is a
nice joke about Catholics being lovely when they are sober and terrible when
drunk, and Protestants the other way round. Tom Watson plays Walter with
tremendous determination and one admires Tracey Wilkinson as the Geordie
girl. But none of the cast is on fertile ground.

FT  07 APR 92 / Election 1992: Jobs top Govan voters' concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT tops most voters' concerns in Govan, an inner-city district of
Glasgow with a large amount of run-down housing and drug-related crime.
Unemployment is 14.6 per cent, slightly better than elsewhere in Glasgow.
Govan is a marginal in a city of safe Labour seats. Mr Jim Sillars won the
seat for the Scottish National party in a 1988 by-election, overturning a
Labour majority of almost 20,000, shaking Labour out of complacency about
its hold over Glasgow. Mr Ian Davidson, a Strathclyde regional councillor,
is working hard to win the seat back this week. Both parties claim to offer
the best deal on jobs.
Glasgow has a history of sectarianism and Govan has slightly more Protestant
voters than Catholic. Traditionally, Catholic voters incline more towards
Labour than the SNP.
Mr Sillars predicts an increased SNP majority, Labour says it will take the
seat back, and the posters seem evenly divided. This is still a seat to
watch.
THE Church of Scotland yesterday entered the election debate with a strongly
worded attack on the government's social and economic record. The annual
report of the church and nation committee says the human cost of
unemployment is unacceptable and last year's comment by Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, that unemployment was 'a price worth paying' to bring down
inflation, was 'hollow and cynical."

FT  06 MAR 92 / BA sets up regional business after union deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS is setting up a business to run its domestic regional
services called British Airways Regional. This follows agreement with BA's
unions to reduce annual staff costs on its regional network by Pounds 8.25m
from the beginning of next month.
BA said the cost-cutting package would improve profitability and safeguard
about 1,000 jobs in its domestic regional services based at Birmingham,
Manchester and Scotland.
The agreement comes after several months of negotiations. It does not
include BA's shuttle services between London Heathrow and Manchester,
Belfast, Glasgow and Edinburgh, as well as services between Heathrow,
Newcastle upon Tyne and Aberdeen and transatlantic services from Manchester
and Glasgow.
British Airways Regional will operate 23 BAe One-Eleven jet aircraft at
Birmingham and Manchester and 13 BAe ATP turboprops based in Scotland.
Mr Robert Ayling, BA's director of marketing and operations, said the launch
of British Airways Regional was a new phase in the company's short-haul
operations which marked a further 'significant step in BA's determination to
control costs'.
Up to 500 staff at the Swindon headquarters of Galileo, the international
travel booking network owned by a consortium of European airlines, could
lose their jobs after the company's merger with its US equivalent Apollo.
Mr Pieter Bouw, president of Galileo and chairman of KLM, the Dutch airline,
said yesterday that most of the cost savings after the merger would be
through job losses. He said that most of these would be in data processing
at Swindon.
Galileo said that 500 of the 800 staff at Swindon were 'technical'. The
remainder are in marketing.
The technical headquarters of the combined operation, which supplies
on-screen travel booking to more than 25,000 travel agents around the world,
will be in Denver, Colorado.

<F P=106> [Article by Rajeev Syal: "Killer Heroin Reaches London After </F>
Eight Die in Glasgow"] 
  [Text] A cache of heroin so powerful that police warn it 
could kill after a single "fix" has been found in London after 
similar batches have claimed the lives of addicts in other parts 
of Britain. 
  The new batch surfaced in Camden, north London, and is twice 
as strong as most heroin bought on the streets. Its discovery 
comes amid growing concern about a rise in the quantity and 
purity of heroin being sold around the country. 
  Last week, eight people died in Glasgow after using 
unusually 
pure forms of the drug. Nine have been killed in Bristol during 
the past six months in similar circumstances, and seven died 
last year in King's Cross, close to where the latest batch of 
heroin was found. 
  The discovery was reported by Release, the drug advice 
agency, which has been told by local counsellors that it is 64 
percent pure--street heroin is usually 35-40 percent pure. "The 
users have not got the tolerance for such high strength, and we 
see the tragic consequences," said Simon Kirkham, group 
spokesman. 
  Powerful drugs interfere with the part of the brain that 
controls breathing. Death arises from congestion in the lungs. 
  Police are trying to trace the source of the London batch, 
and said they were taking the threat it poses very seriously. It 
was found only three days after the latest death in Glasgow. 
  Police in Glasgow have offered an amnesty to people active 
in 
the drug world in an attempt to find the rest of the lethal 
batch, which they believe to be as much as 74 percent pure. 
  But drug counsellors and relatives of those who died in 
Glasgow dispute the official view that high-grade heroin is to 
blame. They insist that drug cocktails and overdoses may have 
killed many of the addicts. Two years ago Glasgow was the scene 
of 20 unexplained deaths which were blamed on high-quality 
heroin. 
  The National Criminal Intelligence Unit believes danger 
arises when inept or inexperienced drug dealers fail to mix 
heroin properly. "Some young dealers may not be used to handling 
the drug, which can be highly dangerous," a spokesman said. 
  In Bristol, laboratory tests last week showed that heroin 
believed to have caused at least four of the nine abuser deaths 
was 63 percent pure. Police fear the purity of the drug reflects 
the large amount of heroin in the British market. 
  Inspector Peter Wills, of Avon police, said drug dealers 
normally mixed the drug with similar looking substances such as 
baking powder, talcum or dried baby milk to maximise profits. 
"Whereas a street dealer would mix the drug with other 
substances if there is a drought--thus increasing his own 
profit--when there is a lot of heroin on the streets, they do 
not need to," he said. 
  Heroin seizures have increased dramatically throughout the 
country in the past year, particularly in Avon, Manchester, 
London and inner-city areas. In Gloucestershire there was a 400 
percent increase, while seizures went up by 600 percent in 
Northumbria and 1,000 percent in Nottinghamshire.

FT  06 JUN 92 / BP division to close Scots HQ: Anger over government
assurances - 350 jobs to be lost - Labour seeks meeting with ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum's exploration arm yesterday announced it was to close its
Glasgow headquarters with the loss of 350 jobs, prompting a row over alleged
breaches of guarantees given when BP took over the offices from Britoil, the
former state-controlled oil company.
About 300 workers will be transferred over the next year to Aberdeen, where
the majority of BP's 5,000 Scottish employees are based and which will
become an integrated headquarters for exploration and production across
Europe. A further 350 people will be made redundant.
Mr John Browne, the chief executive, said that the move was prompted by the
need to cut costs, and the shift towards smaller and less economic fields in
the North Sea.
BP Exploration is the largest operator in the UK sector of the North Sea
with an output of nearly half a million barrels of oil a day.
Mr Fergus MacLeod, industry analyst at County NatWest in Edinburgh, said the
action was expected, and was likely to save BP about Pounds 50m a year.
The St Vincent Street offices in Glasgow passed to BP when the company
acquired Britoil in a Pounds 2.5bn takeover in 1988. Sir Peter Walters, then
BP chairman, gave written assurances to Sir Peter Middleton, then permanent
secretary at the Treasury, including that Glasgow would become the business
headquarters of the combined BP/Britoil upstream business in the UK. The
assurances were repeated in the Commons by Mr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said yesterday's announcement
was a 'flagrant breach' of those guarantees. 'The guarantees were worthless
and the deal sold on a false prospectus. This raises major issues of
political honour and the way this government deals with multinationals.' He
is to press for a meeting with ministers.
Mr George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead, said BP were 'corporate
liars'.
The government initially retained a 'golden share' in Britoil, but redeemed
that in 1990. Ministers said at the time that they were happy BP had
fulfilled its pledges on Britoil.
BP said Abbey National Life had agreed to lease two of the Glasgow
building's six floors as a life assurance centre and was considering whether
to take further space.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ewan Marwick, ceo of Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, has died in a car crash in
Moscow. He was one of the best known figures in Scottish business.
Marwick, who was 41, had run the chamber since 1982. He was a high profile
figure, and an energetic lobbyist. He spearheaded a long-running campaign to
persuade the government to remove Prestwick airport's status as the sole
gateway for transatlantic flights from Scotland. The campaign was finally
won in 1990, against considerable opposition from some Conservative
ministers, and several new air services immediately began between Glasgow
airport and the US.
Marwick was also a leading campaigner to have non-domestic rates in Scotland
reduced to English levels. The government began harmonising Scottish and
English business rates in 1989, but Scotland's disadvantage has not yet been
eliminated.
In 1990 Marwick stood unsuccessfully as the Conservative party candidate in
the Paisley North by-election, and nurtured ambitions to go into national
politics.
Graduated in economics from Edinburgh university, he began his career
advising Shetland Islands Council, before joining the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors in Scotland as assistant secretary.
He was in Russia on a mission to advise the Rostov-on-Don region on economic
development.

FT  12 SEP 94 / Business Travel: Striking a blow for the airlines - When the
industrial action is over, some passengers may not return to UK trains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES JENNINGS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While it may be a pain in the neck for business travellers, for UK airlines
the signal workers' strike on one or two days a week since mid-June has been
a godsend. British Midland claims to have carried 27,000 extra passengers in
the past three months, compared with the same period last year; while
British Airways is reporting an extra 9,000-10,000 passengers a week on its
domestic routes - a 10 per cent increase on numbers 12 months ago.
No one yet knows how many of these newly won passengers will stay with the
airlines once the strike is over. As British Midland's spokeswoman says: 'So
far, the figures suggest that they've mostly been travelling on strike days.
There's no evidence - yet - that people are fundamentally changing their
habits.'
What the airlines do know, however, is that it gives them a new group of
customers to whom they can advertise their product. BA recognises that many
business travellers' first experience of the airline will be on a domestic
route. 'It is,' according to the company, 'our shop window. It's where we
sell BA.'
To this end, the airline has been introducing incentives, including a
no-reservation shuttle service on the London-Glasgow and London-Manchester
routes; automated ticket dispensers; and complimentary food and drink on all
flights, no matter how brief. 'You get a four-course meal and a drink on the
London-Glasgow route. It's a masterpiece of timing,' proclaims BA.
But British Midland's latest manoeuvre in the battle for business travellers
is perhaps more interesting. This week sees the introduction of the Diamond
Pass: a season ticket entitling the holder to five return journeys to any of
the airline's destinations within a period of three months from the date of
issue.
The price is Pounds 699: which means that, on some routes, a British Midland
pass holder could save as much as Pounds 221 over the equivalent five
first-class rail tickets.
'We've had this planned since the start of the year,' says British Midland.
'It's not a response to the rail strike, and we're not trying to capitalise
on it.' It does, however, throw a new element into the business traveller's
equation of time, convenience and cost.
Even without British Midland's new initiative, ticket prices on some routes
are already creeping towards parity. Although an InterCity first-class
return from London to Manchester stands at Pounds 130, against Pounds 180
for an equivalent BA ticket, a first-class InterCity return from London to
Glasgow is Pounds 184, while on BA or British Midland, the equivalent is
Pounds 224. For London to Newcastle, the figures are even closer - Pounds
180 for InterCity, Pounds 206 for BA/British Midland.
Throw in considerations such as time and convenience, and InterCity's
advantage shrinks further. London to Manchester by train takes two and a
half hours, plus half an hour, say, to get to the station; the plane takes
50 minutes, plus, say, an hour and a half to reach Heathrow and check in.
Glasgow, on the other hand, takes five and half hours by rail, compared with
an hour and a quarter by air.
This is where British Midland's strategy looks most effective. Leaving aside
the logistical questions (such as whether you are going from city centre to
city centre, or outskirts to outskirts), if you can save on price as well as
time on the longer routes by going by air, the logic of train over plane
evaporates.
As BA puts it: 'We've seen a steady growth in the number of business
travellers flying over the last few years, and although we're not doing any
special research to find out who's going to change from rail to air after
the strike, the fact is that some people are bound to change for good.'
Luckily for InterCity, there are not enough airports to turn the UK into
another United States, where businessmen fly everywhere. But with every day
of strike action, InterCity must view the future with rather less certainty.

FT  25 JUN 92 / Glasgow (6): Attractions galore - Land and subsidies bring
in the investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW has for the past 10 years been vigorously trying to attract new
businesses. The city on the Clyde urgently needed to replace some of the
thousands of jobs lost in shipbuilding and engineering.
The city has concentrated on building itself up as a service centre based on
retailing, tourism, financial services, scientific research and providing
companies with regional headquarters. It would also like to encourage
manufacturing but has not done as well as a number of other places in
Scotland.
Professor Alan MacGregor, of the social and economic research department at
Glasgow university, says: 'People still think of Glasgow as an industrial
city but it has not been an industrial city for a long time now.
Manufacturing occupies only 16 per cent of the workforce. Apart from
anything else there is not the land available for manufacturing.
'Manufacturers nowadays generally want greenfield sites. There have been
lots of manufacturing companies drawn to places close to Glasgow like East
Kilbride. But in the city itself, like other cities, there is not the room.'
In setting out its stall to attract service companies, Glasgow has a
formidable array of attractions. It is a development area so that companies
qualify for Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) from the Scottish Office
Industry Department.
Through Strathclyde region, Glasgow receives assistance from the European
Social Fund directed at people through training programmes, and from the
European Regional Development Fund which is aimed at infrastructural
improvements. There is also EC money available for former coal and steel
producing areas.
This all amounts to a considerable subsidy to Glasgow, some of which filters
through to individual companies. The Economic Policy Unit of the City
Council estimates that Regional Selective Assistance alone can account for
30 per cent of fixed project costs.
On top of this, much of the work of the Scottish Development Agency, before
its winding up in 1991, was devoted to Glasgow. It offered a range of
practical and financial assistance and was able to build, rent and sell
offices and factories at low cost.
The SDA has now become Scottish Enterprise, which operates through a network
of local enterprise companies of which Glasgow's is the Glasgow Development
Agency. The GDA can still act as an enabling body in the property sector.
As an example the GDA recently bought 35 acres of the land on which the
Glasgow garden festival was held in 1988 at a cost of Pounds 5m. The GDA
will look for a private developer for the land when the property climate
improves. By putting land into a project as a form of equity the GDA can
make the scheme more economical for the developer.
There has been heavy investment in Glasgow's infrastructure. Mr Stephen
Ince, the economic development officer at the City Council, says: 'We
estimate that Pounds 2.4bn is likely to be invested from 1991 and over the
next three or four years, mostly in offices, shops, transportation and
communications.'
Much of the office stock in the city centre has been renewed in the past few
years, and new offices built. The council's economic policy unit claims that
Glasgow's office rents are typically only 35 per cent of those in central
London and Paris, and 50 per cent of the rate in Madrid, Milan and
Frankfurt.
Wages are similarly low, with non-manual male and female wage rates between
only 70 per cent and 74 per cent of the greater London rate. The potential
savings of operating in Glasgow increase because of the high degree of
labour market stability in the city.
The council estimates that annual staff turnover in service industries in
Glasgow is less than 7 per cent, compared with 20 per cent in London and 15
per cent in the south-east of England.
As for high quality staff there are two universities - Glasgow and
Strathclyde - with 8,000 students graduating from these and the polytechnics
and further education colleges each year.
Communications is another important factor influencing relocation decisions.
Here too Glasgow, scores highly. It is relatively free of congestion for a
big city. Glasgow is the only major city with a motorway running through its
centre.
The suburban rail network, underground and bus links form one of the most
comprehensive in Britain. There are inter-city rail connections to all major
UK cities. Glasgow airport is less than 15 minutes from the city centre. It
provides flights to 60 domestic and international destinations including
more than 190 flights a week to London.
Finally the city prides itself on its quality of life. Like many towns and
cities in Britain, Glasgow can claim that employees can live in pleasant
surroundings only a few minutes from work, with no problems parking on
arrival, and get swiftly out into the countryside, compared with the hour or
so it takes to get to work London. Glasgow also sees itself as a
cosmopolitan city with a vibrant cultural life, including concerts, ballet,
opera and restaurants.
With all this, Glasgow has been successful in attracting new service
companies ranging from regional headquarters of financial services groups to
government departments to software systems and engineering.
In spite of this month's decision by BP Exploration to pull out of Glasgow
over the next year or so, the city has attracted 17 concerns involving just
under 7,000 net new jobs between 1986 and 1991 (see table).
Unemployment at 14.5 per cent amounts to just under 60,000 jobs.
Unemployment is traditionally high in Glasgow but these new jobs in services
have made a significant dent in what the overall total might be especially
when taken together with new jobs in tourism.
The table shows that Glasgow is on the way to becoming a second tier
financial services centre.
It has won a fair share of government department relocations and is laying
the basis for a research and development network which can lock into the
universities.

FT  20 FEB 92 / Appointments: Glasgow smiles on part-time job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Edwin Glasgow QC has been appointed chairman of the financial reporting
review panel, the new watchdog of accounting standards, in place of Simon
Tuckey QC who has just become a high court judge.
Glasgow, 46, was called to the bar in 1969 and took silk in 1987; he is
known for tough but courteous cross-examination. His broad-based practice,
covering common law and commercial litigation, has brought him into the
public eye. He acted on behalf of the football clubs in the public inquiries
after both the Bradford fire in 1986 and the Hillsborough disaster in 1989;
he also represented Ernest Saunders in the DTI inquiry into the Guinness
affair in 1987, and is currently acting on behalf of the Chief Constable of
Surrey in the Guildford Four inquiry.
The part-time job as chairman of the review panel involves co-ordinating the
work of its 22 members, who scrutinise accounts which are at variance with
accepted standards and have the power to order directors to change faulty
accounts at their own expense.
The panel has recently made its presence felt by making comments on the
accounting policies of four British companies - Ultramar, Williams Holdings,
Shield Group and Forte - and writing to 240 more which have made minor
reporting errors.
Glasgow says that he is expecting a 'very busy first year and will give up
as much time as necessary to ensure the job is done thoroughly. In
appropriate cases, a firm but fair line will be taken.'
He may have developed a passion for accounting during actions for and
against a number of large accountancy firms. But he must hope that earlier
earnings will tide him over; his time on the panel will only provide an
honorarium believed to be a few thousand pounds a year.

FT  14 JAN 94 / People: Cicutto flies in to Glasgow for NAB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Clydesdale Bank, the Glasgow-based clearing bank which is a subsidiary of
National Australia Bank, has appointed Frank Cicutto, a high-flyer from the
parent company, to replace Charles Love, the ceo who died just after
Christmas.
Cicutto, 43, is currently state manager for New South Wales and Australian
Territory, the largest unit in NAB, with more branches and greater assets
than Clydesdale. He took up office in Glasgow yesterday but will not move
from Sydney to Glasgow until the second half of February.
Love, who was 48, died suddenly during a skiing holiday in France. He had
been ceo at Clydesdale for little over a year having previously held senior
posts with TSB. He had recently launched a project to create two branch
banking processing centres and a telephone centre for the Clydesdale in
Scotland, a project which will involve up to 800 job losses but will not
mean closing branches.
Cicutto has been with NAB for 26 years. His recent appointments include
general manager of the group's credit bureau and head of the bank's US
operations, based in New York. He had not visited Scotland before this week.
Cicutto is the first Australian to be ceo of Clydesdale, which NAB acquired
in 1987 from the Midland Bank. All previous ceos have been British and there
are only a handful of Australians working in the bank. However, he says he
does not expect to encounter any hostility for not being Scottish and that
he intends to carry on with the strategy launched by Love. 'The direction is
very clear and I am very comfortable with it,' he says.
