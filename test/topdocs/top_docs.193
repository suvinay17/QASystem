Mark Tucker was determined to conquer Mt. Everest, and if it meant serving as a
cook to do it, then so be it.
</P>
<P>
"I'd take whatever position was available, just to get on the team," he said.
</P>
<P>
So when the Chinese government whittled back the number of Mt. Everest permits
it would issue Tucker's climbing team, he volunteered for kitchen duty -- a
minor inconvenience, he said, for a chance to scale the 29,028-foot mountain in
windy, subfreezing weather.
</P>
<P>
And on May 9, after six weeks of slaving over canned beans, Tucker became the
first Orange County resident to reach Everest's summit, joining an elite group
of fewer than 300 people who have conquered the mountain.
</P>
<P>
It is a climber's ultimate dream.
</P>
<P>
"As a climber, you're always going, 'What's higher? What's higher?' " said
Tucker, 33, who returned to Huntington Beach on Tuesday night. Nothing on Earth
is higher than the Himalayan peak, wedged between the border of Nepal and
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Tucker undertook the climb with the International Peace Climb, a Seattle-based
organization. Forty-seven expedition members representing the United States,
the Soviet Union and China reached the summit in an effort led by Jim
Whittaker, who in 1963 became the first American to achieve that feat.
</P>
<P>
Originally, they hoped to reach the summit on Earth Day, April 22, but weather
conditions did not allow it. The team's mission, in part, was to clean up
debris left by previous climbers.
</P>
<P>
The climb took six weeks, most of which was devoted to stocking seven way
stations along the mountain with food and medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
Some days, the windchill factor pushed temperatures to minus-100 degrees
Fahrenheit. "You couldn't have any skin exposed," Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
When at last all systems were go, the climbers returned to base camp and rested
for a few days. Then they headed back toward the summit.
</P>
<P>
After six weeks of preparation for the momentous event, the climbers reached
their prize in a mere six or seven days.
</P>
<P>
Back on level ground, the climbers were treated to a tour of China that
featured banquets honoring their achievement.
</P>
<P>
Tucker's all-consuming avocation is likewise his profession. He works as a
guide, mostly at Mt. Rainier in Washington, escorting less experienced
climbers.
</P>
<P>
He is a wanderer who has no permanent residence, aside from the Huntington
Beach house he grew up in. "I've got the greatest parents you could imagine --
I couldn't do what I do without them," Tucker said. "I use their home as a
base. When I'm low on money, I can come back here and hang out for a while."
</P>
<P>
Although he has managed to live life as he likes it -- outdoors -- Tucker said
he sometimes yearns for stability, and even a bit of predictability.
</P>
<P>
"Quite often I get a little depressed, and envious of my brothers because
they're settled down with families and routines. They have homes; I have a
truck. I've just never been able to slow down."
</P>
<P>
Tucker figures he has another seven years of sportsmanship before he needs to
worry about a mid-life career change. Until then, there are other mountains to
climb, even though he has realized his most fantastic dream.
</P>
<P>
"Mt. Everest is the highest, but quite a few mountains are more technically
difficult," Tucker said. "California has some of the greatest mountains in the
world. I'll never run out of challenges." SUSAN CHRISTIAN

<HEAD>University Climbing Team to Re-measure McKinley</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of scientists is going on a
Mount McKinley expedition to determine among other things: How high
is high?
   The team from the School of Engineering at the University of
Alaska-Anchorage will carry sophisticated measuring equipment up
North America's tallest peak.
   With the help of a satellite, the equipment will try to
re-measure the height of Alaska's most popular attraction,
currently recorded at 20,320 feet.
   But all that is of secondary interest to the scientists.
   Ron Cothren, an assistant professor of engineering, said the
team actually wants to measure the mountain's gravitational
attraction.
   ``What difference does it make if the mountain is a foot or two
higher?'' Cothran said Monday. ``What this will really do is give
us a feel for the effect of the mountain's mass. Right now, we have
no idea what kind of attraction McKinley has.''
   The experiment is being conducted with the National Geodetic
Survey and the U.S. Geological Survey. Equipment will be installed
and left at the mountain's 18,000 foot level, Cothren said.
   The team is to go Thursday to the climbers' base camp and leave
from there when weather permits.
   The experiment probably won't make the mountain officially
taller or shorter _ certainly no more than 100 feet each way,
Cothren said.
   Mount Rainier in Washington state was re-measured with the
satellite technique recently and was found to be 1{ feet taller
than its official measurement.

   Mount McKinley still is North America's
tallest mountain, but it is not as tall as people have been saying
for years.
   Using extremely sensitive gravity meters and satellites,
scientists from the University of Alaska-Anchorage have determined
the mountain is 20,306 feet high.
   That's 14 feet less than what Bradford Washburn calculated in
1954. But it still is 456 feet taller than the runner-up, Mount
Logan in Canada.
   ``I wish it had gone up 14 feet,'' said Jeff Yates, assistant
coordinator of the project. ``It's kind of an intangible thing from
a climber's standpoint. People just like the bigger mountains.''
   A few more measurements might vary the new measurement slightly,
but not more than a foot, Yates said.
   The scientists say that because of its great mass, McKinley
exerts enough gravitational pull to distort standard surveying
techniques like those used by Washburn to calculate the mountain's
height.

   The bodies of two climbers missing on
Mount McKinley were found by rescue helicopters hovering near the
16,000-foot level of North America's tallest peak, a National Park
Service spokesman said.
   The bodies of Michael Koshuta, 33, of Centreville, Va., and
Stuart Jones, 29, of Washington state were spotted Tuesday
afternoon, said spokesman John Quinley. No hometown was immediately
available for Jones.
   The men were declared missing Tuesday, one day after a troubled
Japanese climbing party that suffered the season's first fatality
was airlifted off the mountain.
   There was no effort to remove the bodies from the 15,800-level
because of the slope of the mountain and the threat of avalanche.
Officials will decide later when it will be safe to return, Quinley
said.
   The men were roped together and appeared to have died after a
fall, the spokesman said. They were last sighted June 1 at the
16,100-foot level. Mount McKinley is 20,320 feet tall.
   Koshuta and Jones were experienced mountaineers who had climbed
elsewhere in the Denali Range, Quinley said. There were no
immediate clues as to what caused the accident or when it happened.
   The two climbers were scheduled to complete their descent four
days ago. Three food caches they left along their planned route
down the mountain hadn't been touched, Quinley said.
   Denali National Park rangers began looking for them Monday as
rangers and two Army Chinook helicopters rescued three frostbitten,
ill Japanese climbers and lowered the body of a fourth Japanese to
14,000 feet. The helicopters began looking for the missing
Americans on Tuesday.
   The body of Hairoaki Ito, who died Sunday of altitude sickness,
was expected to remain at 14,000 feet until friends could arrange
for its removal or until an Army helicopter is called to the area
on other business, Quinley said.

   Vernon Tejas awoke uneasily in the
darkness of his snow cave, high on Mount McKinley. It was his 20th
day climbing the continent's highest peak, and he was the only
living soul for miles.
   But now someone, or something, seemed to be in the cave with him.
   ``It could have been just the wind,'' the 35-year-old Alaskan
recalled. ``But I was pretty convinced right then and there that
Naomi was in there with me.''
   On Feb. 12, 1984, Naomi Uemura became the first mountaineer to
scale Mount McKinley alone in winter. He vanished in a storm on the
way down, and some veteran climbers believe the Japanese explorer's
spirit still roams the mountain.
   Tejas called out ``Good morning!'' in Japanese. The roaring wind
outside gave the only reply, and Tejas settled back, convinced the
spirit was benign.
   The wind eased the next day, March 7, and Tejas climbed to the
summit, where he planted a Japanese flag to honor the man who
blazed the way for him. Then he did something Uemura failed to do.
He came back.
   Mount McKinley, elevation 20,320 feet, is considered North
America's ultimate mountaineering challenge. The vertical reach
from base camp on the Kahiltna Glacier to the summit is 13,200 feet
_ about 2,000 feet greater than the climb up Mount Everest.
   Each May and June, hundreds of climbers flock to McKinley.
Unbearable arctic weather forces more than half to turn back short
of the summit.
   In winter, the unbearable turns unbelievable. Temperatures can
dip to minus 58 degrees, and storms rake the mountain with
hurricane-force winds.
   Only four teams have made it to the top in winter since the
first expedition in 1967; two of them lost climbers. Uemura was one
of two climbers to die in a recent flurry of solo winter attempts.
   In all, McKinley's slopes are littered with the memories of more
than 50 dead climbers.
   Tejas knows all the grim mileposts _ crevassed areas named for
climbers they swallowed, a slope dubbed the Autobahn for the many
Germans who have fallen there _ and he uses them as warning signs.
   ``I want to challenge myself to live as fully and completely as
possible,'' he said. ``A lot of people will say, `You're doing
something that jeopardizes your ability to live.' But by living on
the edge, I can define life a lot easier. It doesn't make you love
it any less. It makes you love it more.''
   Tejas returned as something of a local hero. As he sat recently
in a sunlit Anchorage cafe, strangers kept interrupting to
congratulate him.
   They stopped partly because of his accomplishment, partly
because Tejas is hard to miss. His head, at its lower elevations,
is forested by a bushy black beard; the summit is bare, shaved
daily except for a neatly braided rattail.
   Tejas (pronounced TAY-hoss) stands 5-foot-8 and has a
personality that lives up to his hairstyle. A veteran of 13
successful McKinley climbs, most of them as a guide for Genet
Expeditions, he bounces boisterous yodels off the bergschrund and
readily pulls a fiddle from his pack to scratch out folk tunes.
   He came to Alaska in 1973, a flatlander from Houston. Within
three days, he stood slack-jawed in Denali National Park, watching
as clouds unveiled McKinley's towering north face. Tejas fell in
love.
   He worked construction jobs and lived in a tent to save money
``to get into climbing big time.'' He first climbed McKinley in
1978; the next year he was invited back to guide.
   In 1986, he led the first successful winter climb of Canada's
Mount Logan, North America's second-tallest peak. Two months later,
back on McKinley, he took part in a daring rescue, climbing over
the summit ridge and rappelling 600 feet to reach two altitude-sick
Korean climbers.
   National Park Service rangers discourage solo climbs of McKinley
and tried to dissuade another climber who started up the same day
as Tejas. That climber, with no previous arctic experience, was
flown out with frostbitten toes after five days.
   Tejas was not warned.
   ``I think Vern is a very special case,'' said Ralph Moore, a
mountaineering ranger who lauds Tejas as a cautious climber and a
meticulous planner. ``With Vern, it was a very calculated risk. He
knew what he was getting into.''
   Tejas proudly notes he can still count to 20 on his fingers and
toes, each digit intact and unfrozen. To prevent slips into
crevasses on his solo climb, he strapped a 16-foot extension ladder
to his body _ ``my aluminum albatross,'' he calls it.
   Tejas was flown to McKinley on Feb. 16 by glacier pilot Lowell
Thomas Jr. He carried 170 pounds of gear and enough food for 16
days. But as he packed a toboggan, he decided he had too much. He
left behind his tent and 20 pounds of food.

   Brigitte Muir is cooling off to warm up
for a planned assault on Antartica's tallest mountain.
   Mrs. Muir, 32, who hopes to become the first woman to climb the
highest peaks on each of the world's seven continents, plans to
spend 40 hours with her four-man support crew plan at 22 below zero
temperatures in a fish market freezer starting Saturday afternoon.
   ``The freezer will simulate Antarctic conditions for my support
team as we prepare to climb Mount Vinson, which at 5,140 meters
(16,863 feet) is Antarctica's highest mountain,'' she said
Wednesday.
   Since reaching the summit of Mt. McKinley, North America's
tallest mountain, in 1988, Mrs. Muir has conquered Mt. Kilimanjaro
(Africa), Mt. Aconcagua (South America), Mt. Kosciusko (Australia)
and Mt. Elbrus (Europe).
   ``After climbing Mount Vinson, I will then tackle the big one -
Mt. Everest,'' she said. ``An American woman has already climbed
all but Mt. Everest, so I've got to do Mt. Vinson this year and Mt.
Everest early next year, so I can take the record before her.''
   Joining her in the freezer will be her husband, cameraman John
Muir; freelance photographer and writer Jonathan Chester, cameraman
Glenn Singleman and sound recorder Michael Gatehouse.

<TEXT>
   Three British climbers were killed in a
fall on Mount McKinley, the National Park Service said Friday.
   Spokesman John Quinley said their bodies were found at the
15,000-foot level of North America's tallest peak shortly after
noon Thursday. He said they apparently fell about 3,000 feet.
   Quinley identified the climbers as Chris Massey, 39, of Reading,
England; John Lang, 45, of Chorley, England; and Julian Dixon, 37,
of Cambria. He said Massey was the team leader.
   The trio last was seen at the 18,000-foot level of the
20,320-foot peak Wednesday afternoon by a team of park rangers.
Quinley said the rangers decided to descend because of poor
visibility and winds gusting to 45 mph.
   Quinley said the rangers were unable to persuade the British
group to turn back. But at some point Wednesday night, the team
apparently started back down to their camp at 16,000 feet, he said.
   Thursday morning, climbers at the medical research camp at the
14,200-foot level spotted what they thought was a body at the
bottom of a steep gully known as the Orient Express, Quinley said.
   Ranger Roger Robinson, medical camp personnel and private
climbers investigated and found the bodies, he said. The bodies
were taken down to the medical camp, and will be taken off the
mountain later, Quinley said.
   Earlier this year, three Japanese climbers were killed while
trying to make a winter ascent of the mountain.
   Quinley said there are almost 400 climbers on the mountain. May
and June are the most popular months for McKinley expeditions
because weather conditions are most favorable.

<HEAD>Dog Lost On Mount McKinley Wanders Into Camp 18 Days Later</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sled dog lost in poor weather during a
climbing expedition on Mount McKinley has turned up, weak but alive,
after 18 days on the ice-covered mountain.
   Patricia and Jean-Francois Tuveri of Chamonix, France, assumed
the dog had fallen in a crevasse and died after it disappeared May
31.
   The Tuveris had four dogs in harness when they started mushing up
North America's tallest peak. On the sixth day of the journey, while
descending to their camp at the 11,000-foot level after ferrying
supplies higher, they unhitched the dogs because of treacherous ice
conditions.
   By the time they got around Windy Corner at 13,200 feet, only
three dogs were with them. A 15-month-old Siberian husky named
Oukiok was gone.
   A snowstorm forced the Tuveris to hole up for the next four days.
When they climbed to a medical research camp at 14,200 feet, they
asked other climbers if they had seen the dog. None had and they
assumed he had fallen to his death.
   With only three dogs left, the Tuveris abandoned their sled and
simply climbed to the 20,320-foot summit with the dogs. It was only
the second expedition to reach the top with dogs.
   The Tuveris left the mountain for some sightseeing around Alaska,
then returned to Talkeetna, near the mountain, to pick up the
remaining dogs for the trip back to France.
   That's where they learned that, 18 days after he disappeared,
Oukiok had walked into the high basin where the medical camp is
located. Denali National Park rangers said the dog didn't have any
broken bones, but was exhausted.
   ``It would seem pretty spectacular but it's not impossible,''
said Jim Leach, chief veterinarian for the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog
Race. Snow and ice could provide enough liquid to prevent death
through dehydration, he said.
   The dog was being nursed back to health by staff members at the
research camp. Rangers said he should soon have enough strength to
make the trip to the Kahiltna Glacier base camp at 7,200 feet. From
there he will be flown to Talkeetna, hopefully in time to accompany
the Tuveris and the other three dogs back to France on Monday.

<HEAD>Three Japanese Climbers Presumed Dead on Mount McKinley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL JENKINS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TALKEETNA, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Mount McKinley climbing party of three
Japanese men is presumed dead 3,000 feet below the summit of North
America's tallest peak, the National Park Service said Saturday.
   ``I'm afraid I see no hope for the survival of the three men,
knowing what we know right now,'' Ranger Bob Seibert said in calling
off a search by specially-equipped Army helicopters and an
international group of climbers.
   Searchers in a twin-engine airplane Friday flew over part of the
20,320-foot peak and observed three objects, possibly bodies, at the
17,400-foot level, 200 feet above the Japanese party's camp. A
follow-up flight by two CH-47C Army helicopters was organized
Saturday in an unsuccessful attempt to make identification.
   Climb leader Noboru Yamada, 39; Teruo Saegusa, 31; and Kozo
Komatsu, 34, all of Tokyo, set off on their expedition Feb. 16 and
last were seen by an Austrian team descending the mountain as the
Japanese were climbing.
   ``We've had two days of good (mountaineering) weather and we've
seen nobody,'' Seibert said. He said earlier that if the men were
alive and well, they would be moving about.
   Seibert said he no longer could justify the risks the search
posed for the rescue team aboard aircraft hindered by turbulence and
severe downdrafts.
   ``Sometimes we had no aircraft control,'' said Chief Warrant
Officer Myron Babcock, a pilot with 16 years of experience flying
Chinook helicopters.
   In trying to reach the bowl where the reddish-orange objects were
observed, the helicopters Saturday encountered downdrafts that
forced them downward at than 2,000 feet per minute, even with the
aircraft operating at maximum power.
   What were presumed to be the bodies were sighted just below
Denali Pass, an area notorious for its ferocious wind.
   ``It's my guess they were blown right out of the pass,'' Ranger
Roger Robinson said. If that happened, the Japanese would have
fallen 800 vertical feet, Robinson said.
   Searchers had waited most of the week for safe flying weather. On
Friday, a week after the return date the climbers stated when they
set out, winds abated enough for the airplane, but not for the
helicopters.
   Before Friday's flight, Seibert had said he was optimistic the
Japanese were alive. He described the men as well-equipped,
experienced climbers and said it was possible they were waiting out
the weather in snow caves.
   Park Service officials said the climbers also were aware of the
agency's food cache at the mountain's 17,200-foot level.
   ``I wish we could have done more and found more, but sometimes it
doesn't work out,'' Seibert said when he announced the search was
over.

   A Japanese climber became the first
person to die on Mount McKinley this year after he was stranded
without a tent for two days at the 19,000-foot level, authorities
said.
   Rescuers believe they were within 200 feet of Hairoaki Ito when
he died Sunday.
   Ito and a companion had become separated from five other
climbers in their party, most of whom had reached the summit
Saturday, said Bob Seibert, chief mountaineering ranger for the
National Park Service.
   The cause of death was not immediately known, but Seibert said
the 38-year-old Ito was suffering from exposure and altitude
sickness.
   ``To be exposed to Denali weather at that elevation is just
asking for it,'' said Renny Jackson, a ranger who had descended
Saturday after spending 24 days on the mountain. Denali is the
native Alaskan name for McKinley.
   Ito died as his fellow climber was trying to reach him with an
air-dropped oxygen bottle and as a climbing party that included
physicians was scrambling up the mountain.
   Ito, from Hyogo, Japan, was the first to die on the mountain
since three British climbers were killed last fall. More than 40
people have died on Mount McKinley, the continent's tallest peak at
20,320 feet.

   A record 916 people tackled Mount
McKinley during the mountaineering season, says the National Park
Service, which is thinking about putting another outhouse on North
America's tallest mountain.
   Sanitation on the 20,320-foot mountain has been a growing
concern, said Ranger Roger Robinson.
   According to Robinson, 562 of the 916 people who registered to
climb McKinley this spring and summer reported reaching the summit.
   Last year, 817 climbers tested themselves against the mountain.
Only about a third finished the climb.
   Two people died climbing McKinley this year, Robinson said.
   Don Henry, a 71-year-old Connecticut lawyer, this year became
the oldest person known to have made the top.
   Robinson attributed some of the increased mountaineering to
foreigners who decided attractive currency exchange rates made this
the year for the climb they had long wanted to make.
   Climbers began arriving in April and some waited until late
July, but most planned their trips for May and June.
   ``We're trying to get more people to come in July,'' Robinson
said. Rangers attempting to deal with the environmental effects of
increased activity want use of the mountain to be spread out.
   The Park Service asks climbers to use plastic bags for human
waste and put the bags in crevasses, but officials don't know how
many comply, Robinson said. There are two latrines on McKinley, one
two-thirds of the way up the peak. The Park Service hopes to
install an outhouse at 17,000 feet next year.

   Clinging to the southern flank of
the Mount McKinley massif is a snug shelter of glass and wood, a
place with an indoor view of one of the world's most astounding
outdoor scenes.
   People come to the Sheldon Mountain House to climb staggering
walls of gray rock ringing the Ruth Glacier, to ski or just to look
and listen. They gaze at the intricacies of McKinley, North
America's tallest peak, and its cousins, Mount Dan Beard and the
ragged Rooster Comb. They listen to the quiet of the Alaska
twilight, hear the wind and the sliding snow.
   The hexagonal house is a simple place in an extraordinary
environment.
   The structure can become a solarium as sun beats through the
large windows on five of six sides. The building, at 5,810 feet,
also is a shelter from the fierce storms of the Alaska Range.
   The house, in a glacial amphitheater with a clear view of
20,320-foot McKinley's summit, is a half-hour flight from
Talkeetna. The trip takes in the confluence of three rivers, miles
of scrubby black spruce and brown tundra, dozens of ponds, brown at
first and then brilliant blue as the glacial moraine appears below.
Toothy pinnacles jut toward the sky as the plane drones through a
gorge.
   The late bush pilot Don Sheldon designed the Mountain House and
supervised its construction in 1966. He acquired five acres in the
Ruth Amphitheater before it became part of Denali National Park and
Preserve.
   The house was built for use by mountaineers, photographers and
sightseers.
   ``It's been booked solid for the last five or six years,'' says
Roberta Sheldon, who was the radio operator when her husband landed
ski-equipped airplanes on Ruth Glacier. ``It's been a gradual
evolution, just like the growth of the tourist industry in
Talkeetna.''
   The house is perched on a jagged outcropping about 100 feet
above a snowfield that serves as a runway.
   ``The glaciers are moving and changing,'' Sheldon says. ``It was
hard to find a stable place to build the house.''
   Once it was built, the 196-square-foot house proved up to the
test of 20 years of harsh weather and seasonal occupancy.
   Sixty-five dollars buys a night's lodging and wood for the
stove. An outhouse stands 50 yards away.
   The house is furnished with four cushioned benches that double
as beds. Visitors are expected to bring sleeping bags and their own
food, although previous occupants have left supplies. Cereal,
canned stew, four kinds of mustard, pancake mix and real maple
syrup are among the provisions.
   Packed along two walls of the one-room house is more culinary
equipment _ including a wok _ than many home kitchens can claim.
   There are things to read in this mountain studio, as well. Books
and magazines line part of a shelf, along with Scrabble and other
games. A chin-up bar fashioned from a stick of firewood, a
mountaineer's carabiner and nylon webbing hangs from the slanted
ceiling.
   But for the landings and takeoffs by planes that use the
ice-and-snow runway below the house, it would be insulated from the
world outside. At the height of the summer tourist season, light
planes carrying sightseers interested in 10 minutes on Ruth Glacier
land several times an hour.
   Noise echoes from one ridge to another as the planes come and
go, the snow acting as a brake that allows them to land in
one-fourth the space needed for takeoff.
   Users of the Mountain House over the years have included
organized mountaineering groups. Genet Expeditions of Anchorage
rented the building during the month of May for several years, with
the house serving as a base of operations and clients sleeping in
tents nearby.
   ``It was nice to be able to dry out gear,'' said Mike Howerton,
Genet Expeditions general manager and a guide. ``It just made for a
more comfortable recuperation area.''
   The house also has served as a base for mountain rescues.
   Howerton warns against a casual attitude about activities in the
Ruth area. Precautions that would be adequate in many other
cross-country ski areas aren't enough here. He recommends skiers
rope themselves together for safety in case one falls into a
crevasse while crossing the snow.
   ``It's a hassle, but skiing roped is the only way to go up
there,'' Howerton says. ``It's a place where you have to be very
careful.''

   Climbers from China, Japan and Nepal who staged a
successful rendezvous on Mount Everest's summit were making
progress today in descending the world's tallest peak, the
expedition's leader said.
   When nine of the climbers met on top of the world Thursday, they
achieved two mountaineering firsts: simultaneously scaling Everest
from two sides and making a live telecast from the summit.
   Three other expedition members later reached the summit.
   Shi Zhanchun, the expedition's leader and president of the
Chinese Mountaineering Association, told a news conference that
eight of the climbers who met on the 29,028-foot summit had reached
a camp at 27,224 feet on the north, or Chinese Tibetan, side of the
mountain this morning.
   He said the ninth had descended to 25,551 feet.
   China's official Xinhua News Agency also reported from Katmandu,
Nepal, that Cering Doje of Tibet, Noboru Yamada of Japan and Ang
Lhakpa Sherpa of Nepal reached a camp at 26,174 feet on the south,
or Nepalese, face of Everest.
   The three, who had climbed from the north side, and three others
who made the ascent from the south and were going down the north
face, are attempting to be the first to complete an
across-the-mountain climb.
   Shi said the climbers who met at the summit will not proclaim
victory until they have reached the 21,320-foot level. The descent
is treacherous and there is still danger of climbers suffering
frostbite, he said.
   The expedition is the largest ever to attempt to climb Everest,
with more than 200 people participating. The teams began their
assaults last month.
   Japan's Nihon Television Corp. engineered the alpine telecasts,
which have been beamed by satellite and televised in China, Japan
and Nepal. NTV has paid most of the cost of the $12.5 million
expedition.
   In Tokyo, an NTV spokeswoman said a nine-member group, including
three network cameramen, were scaling the mountain from the
northern side today, while three others climbed from the southern
side.
   She added that more expedition members planned to reach the
summit of the Himalayan peak that straddles the Nepal-China border.
She did not have further details.
   The expedition was staged to honor the 35th anniversary of the
first successful Everest assault, by Sir Edmund Hillary of New
Zealand and Tenzing Norgay, his sherpa guide, on May 29, 1953.
   The conquering of the mountain the Chinese call Qomolangma was
the top news story on television in Beijing and was the lead story,
with large pictures, on the front page of all major dailies today.
   Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping on Thursday telephoned a television
studio to congratulate the ``great pioneers'' of the three nations.

   Four Japanese mountain climbers
attempting a winter ascent of Mount McKinley's dangerous West
Buttress haven't been seen in nearly two weeks.
   Four other climbers have died on North America's highest
mountain during winter.
   At high elevations in winter, McKinley often has white-out
conditions with wind that can exceed 200 mph. The mountain is in
Denali National Park, the native American name for the mountain.
   The climbers and their equipment, including a 35-day supply of
food, were flown to a camp on the southeast fork of the Kahiltna
Glacier on Feb. 11, said Park Service mountaineering ranger Bob
Seibert. Since then, the weather on the 20,320-foot mountain
generally has been bad.
   Cliff Hudson, a bush pilot who flew the group onto the mountain,
said he was scheduled to check on them last week. But he said he
could not because visibility on the mountain has been close to zero.
   Hudson and Seibert said the group was last seen Feb. 22 at about
the 11,000-foot level by a plane flying overhead. There were no
apparent problems.
   Hudson said he would try to fly over the mountain as soon as
weather permitted. ``They have priority,'' he said.
   When the group left Talkeetna, outside the park, they gave March
15 as the ``last due out'' date, Seibert said. That is the day a
search would begin if they don't return.
   Hiroshi Oda, 37 of Osaka, is leading the 1990 Japan Winter
McKinley Expedition. With him are Takeyoshi Takatsuka, 47, of
Toyama; Osamu Tagaya, 34, of Akita; and Junji Saito, 25, also of
Osaka.
   All four are experienced mountaineers, Seibert said.
   Oda has successfully climbed Mount Everest and McKinley's West
Buttress during summer, and Takatsuka has scaled Everest and K2,
the two highest peaks in the world, Seibert said.
   If successful, they would be the first Japanese to successfully
scale the West Buttress in winter.
   Last March, three Japanese climbers were lost in a storm on
their way up the mountain during a storm that featured 200-plus mph
wind. A fourth member of that group returned to camp alone before
his fellow climbers were lost.
   In 1984, solo adventurer Naomi Uemura died on his way down the
mountain after planting his flag at the top. It is believed he also
died in a winter storm, Seibert said.

   Sir Edmund Hillary says Mount Everest
should get a rest.
   Why? Because it's there _ as are the armies of explorers elbowing
each other up and down the mountain in all types of weather and
leaving behind their trash.
   Hillary, one of the first two men to climb the world's tallest
peak, suggests a moratorium on the mountain, with no one scaling
Everest for five years.
   ``There have been far too many expeditions jostling their way up
Mount Everest,'' Hillary said Wednesday in an interview with The
Associated Press. ``You find them in pre-monsoon, post-monsoon and
even in winter season from various sides of the mountain. And a a
great deal of rubbish and junk has been left on the mountain.''
   Hillary, who is New Zealand's ambassador to Nepal and India,
climbed Everest with Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay in 1953. Since
then, the 29,028-foot mountain has been conquered 260 times, both
from the Nepal and Tibet sides.
   ``You know nature has a great ability to rehabilitate itself and
I believe that if the mountain was closed down for expeditions for
five years that much of rubbish would disappear down under the snow,
down into the basin,'' said Hillary, 69. ``And the mountain would
become rather cleaner and more wholesome again.
   ``I think we owe it to the mountain not to constantly harass it
as it has been in the past 10 or 15 years,'' he added.
   An official at the Ministry of Tourism, which issues climbing
permits, said climbers have sought to reserve Everest through the
end of the century.
   The official refused to comment on Hillary's suggestion of a
temporary ban on expeditions, but noted that Nepal's regulations
call for climbers to clean up after themselves before they leave the
mountain.
   Glenn Porzak, president of the American Alpine Club, said the
issue was discussed at his organization's recent annual meeting.
   ``The consensus feeling was that that was not the solution to the
problem,'' he said in Boulder, Colo. ``The solution was to educate
each of the expeditions that go to Everest and to instill in them
more of an environmental ethic so they bring down all of what they
take up to the mountain.''
   Porzak said P.M. Shrestha, undersecretary of tourism in Nepal,
has indicated that closing the mountain is not under consideration.
If anything, ``they're definitely going the other way,'' Porzak
said, noting that Nepal has been issuing more climbing permits and
that it relies on the revenue.
   Nepal and China have been allowing more than one expedition on
the same route at the same time, he said. ``So there's a whole lot
more traffic, and with the traffic there's a greater potential for
some expeditions to leave their gear on the mountain once they're
done,'' Porzak said. ``I would favor limiting the number of teams on
the mountain.
   ``But closing off the mountain for five years would be a little
bit akin to what (President) Carter did in terms of boycotting the
Olympics. That's not the ultimate solution,'' added Porzak, who is
leaving in a month and a half to climb Everest.
   George Band, president of London's Alpine Club, the world's
oldest mountaineering society, says that instead of a five-year
moratorium, ``it may be a more practical gesture to have not more
than two or three expeditions to each mountain at a time each
season.''
   ``On Everest there are two seasons before and after the monsoon
which breaks in June, so climbers are tackling the mountain in May
or October,'' said Band, who was in Hillary's 1953 expedition. He
added that worst problem was increased numbers of Sherpas cooking
with firewood and depleting the shrubbery, which could cause erosion.
   Hillary said that because hundreds have climbed Everest ``we
can't feel sorry for those who may not get the opportunity over the
next few years.''
   ``After all, for many, many years when Everest was being
attempted (before 1953), nobody was successful in climbing it,'' he
said. ``But it has now been climbed more than 200 times, so how can
one say that one is a bit unlucky? ... Let them wait for five
years.''
   Everest ``gets more rough treatment than any other peak'' because
there are expeditions from both the Nepalese and Chinese sides and
people tend to stay on it longer because it is the tallest, he said.
   ``So I feel it would be good to at least set the example ...
(and) choose Everest, the biggest of all the peaks, and let it rest
for five years. And then maybe let people come back again.''

"Everyone says we better make the mountain larger," Jeff Yates, assistant

Whatever the results of the survey expedition, Mt. McKinley will remain the

   A new expedition led by the
first man to conquer Mount McKinley alone in winter ended less than
1,000 feet from the top when one climber apparently froze to death
and three others suffered hypothermia.
   Lynn Salerno, 31, died early Wednesday at the 19,500-foot level
of North America's highest peak, the National Park Service said.
Two other members of the nine-person expedition were evacuated by
helicopter.
   ``We had a beautiful experience turn into a nightmare,'' one
exhausted climber, Leonard Kelly, said as he clutched a hot cup of
tea at Denali Medical Camp at the 14,000-foot level of Mount
McKinley.
   ``It's unbelievable that one minute you can be on top of the
world, and in the next minute under it,'' Kelly said.
   The expedition, which began about May 1, was led by veteran
guide Vern Tejas, who last March became the first mountaineer to
survive a winter climb to McKinley's 20,320-foot summit.
   According to accounts from expedition members, Tejas called a
conference at about 8 p.m. Tuesday, after nearly 10 hours on the
trail. They were still more than 1,000 feet below the summit.
   Tejas warned that the approaching night would be bitterly cold.
He told them to make individual decisions on whether to continue.
   Kelly, at 57 the oldest member of the party, said he had
intestinal cramps and decided to turn back with another man, Dave
Burns. Tejas sent assistant guide John Swider to accompany them to
the 17,200-foot camp. The others, led by Tejas, went on.
   Before the trio reached the haven, Swider fell on the steep,
rocky terrain. He was saved from certain death only when Kelly
secured them using an ice ax.
   ``We all ended up in kind of a blob, hanging on, looking at each
other, because the next step was really kind of a big one _ like a
couple of thousand feet right off the ridge, going straight down,''
Kelly said.
   Other climbers saw the fall and went to the rescue.
   Swider, who had head lacerations and a back injury, and Kelly
were helped back to camp, where they spent a long night worrying
about their companions.
   The others had it even worse.
   Some 500 feet below the summit, Lynn Salerno began acting
irrationally.
   It remains unclear whether she was ailing from hypothermia or
some sort of altitude sickness, but she grew increasingly cold and
unresponsive, the climbers said.
   While others worked desperately to warm her, Tejas tried to dig
a snow shelter in the icy, rocky terrain, but in a matter of
minutes she was dead.
   ``She was such a strong supporter of Vern's,'' Kelly said. ``She
was practically on the trip because of him'' after hearing him
describe his mountain experiences at a talk in Anchorage.
   Kelly was assisted down the mountain Wednesday evening by other
climbers. He was treated for three frostbitten toes.
   Swider and Mike Moss, 50, of Minnesota, who had severely
frostbitten feet, were flown off the mountain to a hospital in
Anchorage.
   Tejas remained with the rest of the expedition at 17,200 feet.
Two reportedly were recovering well from hypothermia.
   ``I felt like we had the best guide in the world,'' Kelly said.
``He did everything in the world a human being could be expected to
do in a dangerous occupation like this.''

   A woman whose guided party
was pushing for Mount McKinley's summit has become the first
fatality of the 1988 climbing season on North America's tallest
peak, the National Park Service said.
   The agency said it learned early Wednesday that Lynn Salerno,
31, of Anchorage, had died of apparent hypothermia and exposure at
the mountain's 19,500-foot level. Rangers did not know the
circumstances or time of death.
   Salerno was in a party led by Vern Tejas, 35, an Alaskan whose
solo winter ascent of 20,320-foot McKinley this year made
mountaineering history.
   The party is believed to have begun its climb on or about May 1.

Perched on the southern flank of the Mt. McKinley massif is a snug shelter of
glass and wood, a place with a view of one of the world's most astounding
outdoor scenes.
</P>
<P>
People come to the Sheldon Mountain House to climb the staggering heights of
gray rock that ring Ruth Glacier, to ski or just to look and listen. They gaze
at the intricacies of McKinley, North America's tallest peak, and its cousins,
Mt. Dan Beard and the ragged Rooster Comb. They soak up the silence of the
twilight, hear the wind and the sliding snow.
</P>
<P>
The tiny, hexagonal cabin is a simple place in an extraordinary setting. It is
a solarium when the sun beats through the large windows on five of its six
sides. At 5,810 feet, it also is a shelter from the fierce storms of the Alaska
Range.
</P>
<P>
Set in an amphitheater of ice with a clear view of the 20,320-foot McKinley
summit, the house is half an hour from Talkeetna by airplane. One flies over
the confluence of three rivers, miles of scrubby black spruce and brown tundra,
dozens of ponds that are brown at first and then brilliant blue as the glacial
moraine appears below. Toothy pinnacles jut toward the sky as the plane drones
through a gorge.
</P>
<P>
The late bush pilot Don Sheldon designed Mountain House and supervised its
construction in 1966. He owned five acres in the Ruth Amphitheater before it
became part of Denali National Park and Preserve.
</P>
<P>
The shelter was built for the use of mountaineers, photographers and
sightseers.
</P>
<P>
"It's been booked solid for the last five or six years," says Roberta Sheldon,
who was the radio operator when her husband landed ski-equipped airplanes on
Ruth Glacier. "It's been gradual, just like the growth of the tourist industry
in Talkeetna."
</P>
<P>
The house sits on a jagged outcropping about 100 feet above a snowfield that
serves as an airstrip.
</P>
<P>
"The glaciers are moving and changing," Sheldon says. "It was hard to find a
stable place to build the house."
</P>
<P>
Once built, however, the 196-square-foot structure stood up to 20 years of
harsh weather and seasonal use.
</P>
<P>
A night's lodging and wood for the stove cost $65; an outhouse stands 50 yards
away.
</P>
<P>
The house is furnished with four cushioned benches that double as beds.
Visitors are expected to bring sleeping bags and their own food, although
previous occupants have left supplies -- cereal, canned stew, four kinds of
mustard, pancake mix and real maple syrup.
</P>
<P>
Packed along two walls of the single room are a wok and more kitchen equipment
than many homes can claim.
</P>
<P>
There are things to read in this mountain studio, as well. Books and magazines
line part of a shelf, along with Scrabble and other games. There is a chin-up
bar fashioned from a stick of firewood. A mountaineer's carbine and nylon
webbing hang from the sloped ceiling.
</P>
<P>
Except for the tour planes coming and going below, this would be an isolated
place. At the height of the summer season, light planes carrying sightseers to
10-minute stops on Ruth Glacier land here several times an hour.
</P>
<P>
Noise echoes from one ridge to another as the planes come and go. With the snow
acting as a brake, pilots can land in one-fourth the space needed for takeoff.
</P>
<P>
Users of the Mountain House over the years have included organized
mountaineering groups. Genet Expeditions of Anchorage rented the place during
the month of May for several years, with the house serving as a base of
operations and clients sleeping in tents nearby.
</P>
<P>
"It was nice to be able to dry out gear," said Mike Howerton, Genet Expeditions
general manager and a guide. "It just made for a more comfortable recuperation
area."
</P>
<P>
The house also has served as a base for mountain rescue teams.
</P>
<P>
Howerton warned that precautions adequate for many other cross-country ski
areas aren't enough here. He advises skiers to rope themselves together in case
one falls into a crevasse while crossing the snow.
</P>
<P>
"It's a hassle, but skiing roped is the only way to go up there," Howerton
says. "It's a place where you have to be very careful."

<LEADPARA>  From a distance, Mount Fuji, the symbol of Japan, looks as pure as the fresh
snow that caps its peak. But up close, the once-sacred mountain is a mess.;
This year, 3.6 million tourists visited Japan's tallest peak. During the
two-month summer climbing season alone, nearly 200,000 hiked to its
12,388-foot summit.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And, local officials lament, most visitors are leaving more than just
footprints.;   "Mount Fuji used to be a sacred mountain, and desecrating it
was seen as sinful," said Yoshiaki Watanabe, director of the Keep Mount Fuji
Clean Society. "Now it's a place for tourism.";   Though the Japanese have a
reputation for personal cleanliness, their lakes and beaches tend to be an
unsightly clutter of plastic and paper litter.;   Overcrowding has contributed
to the pollution of the more accessible scenic spots, like Mount Fuji, and
Watanabe said many Japanese simply accept litter as a part of the scenery.;
"I guess it's just the way people are," he said. "But with our tradition of
worshiping nature, it is very disappointing that Mount Fuji would get like
this.";   Mount Fuji's peak is snow-free in the summer, and buses from Tokyo,
a four-hour drive, go more than halfway to the top -- 7,606 feet. From there,
the peak is a six- or seven-hour hike.;   "Climbers at Fuji are more like
tourists than mountaineers," said Watanabe. "They go up at night so that they
can watch the sunrise from the peak. They eat a lot on the way, and, figuring
that no one will see them in the darkness, they just toss their trash.";
Watanabe said his group has mobilized 39,000 volunteer climbers over the year
for cleaning runs, and removed 140 tons of garbage from the mountain's
slopes.;   He said empty cans, cigarette butts, candy wrappers and plastic
lunch boxes are the most common throwaways.  </TEXT>

   The National Park Service requested help
from the Army as fears mounted that three Japanese climbers trying
to make a winter ascent of Mount McKinley were near death somewhere
near the summit.
   The Park Service on Tuesday said little can be done until
hurricane-force winds buffeting the 20,320-foot peak abate.
   The climbers have not been heard from in more than a week and are
believed to have run out of food six days ago, said John Quinley, a
park service spokesman. The men have a radio but have made no
contact, he said.
   The Army has Chinook helicopters specially equipped for
high-altitude rescues, but they are not expected to be able to fly
until Thursday or Friday because of the wind, Quinley said.
   An Army plane circled the mountain repeatedly on Monday,
broadcasting messages, but received no response from the climbers,
Quinley said.
   Quinley said park rangers believe the climbers could be holed up
in a snow cave somewhere between 17,000 feet and the summit of Mount
McKinley, North America's highest peak.
   He said there is also concern that the men have run out of fuel
needed to melt snow. Without water, they could quickly succumb to
dehydration and hypothermia.
   McKinley, because of its location near the Arctic Circle, is
judged to be one of the most difficult winter climbs.
   ``Based on what they took, they're six days out of food,''
Quinley said. ``But the park service has a cache at 17,200,
apparently fairly close to where they would be camped, and there's
food and fuel there.''
   The National Weather Service reported sustained winds of 60 mph
to 100 mph in the area. Climbing ranger Bob Seibert of Talkeetna
estimated those winds reach 90 mph to 200 mph as they funnel through
passes in the mountains.
   He identified the missing climbers as 39-year-old Noboru Yamada,
the group leader, 31-year-old Teruo Saegusa and 34-year-old Kozo
Komatsu, all of Tokyo.

   Buena Vista, Colo. -- Unless someone was standing atop
Mounts Whitney, Elbert or Massive at 10:50 a.m., Mountain
Daylight Time, three Thursdays ago, Ray Sokolov and I were
the two highest fellas in the contiguous U.S. of A. At or
about that time, we scrambled to the summit of Mount Harvard,
14,420 feet above sea level.
   That's right. We climbed it. All the way. To the top.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   It was, without question, my greatest moment as a
mountaineer. Ray, who is editor of this page, has loftier
achievements to his credit, such as baking a cake on Mount
Whitney in California, which at 14,495 feet is the tallest in
the 48. But he, too, basked in the glory of the feat.
   As we stood there, perusing the panorama, the interesting
geological fact came to mind that Mount Harvard is just a bit
shorter than nearby Mounts Elbert (14,433 feet) and Massive
(14,421), the only two higher peaks in the Rockies.
   "What if I stood on your shoulders? Would that make us the
highest point in Colorado?" I asked.
   "What if I stood on yours?" he replied.
   After brief consideration, we rejected both propositions.
The footing was a mite shaky, and even if we did it nobody
would believe us.
   But, what the heck, we'd done what we'd come for, and that
was plenty good enough. Standing on my first significant
summit, I knew why people climbed mountains. It's not so much
that they're there, it's that the view from the peak is so
wonderful. Only from the top can you see both sides of
something.
   If you are just tuning in to this column, some background
on this mountaineering business might be in order. Mount
Harvard is the third ascent attempted by the team of Klein
and Sokolov, which I so list for purely alphabetical reasons.
The idea was to convey the joys of mountain hiking -- we're
not talking rope-and-piton climbing here -- to a broad
public. We are middle-aged men in OK, but not sensational,
physical shape. We figured that if we could do it, so could
almost anyone.
   Our first outing, in 1985, was up the above-mentioned
Mount Massive, just north of here in Central Colorado's
Sawatch Range. We climbed well but not wisely, winding up in
a kind of rocky cul de sac 150 feet from the top with
daylight waning. Not being totally crazy, we called it a day.
Ray's new boots produced painful blisters, and the walk down
introduced me to leg muscles I never knew I had.
   It took four years to get us back on the slopes together,
and the next time we picked an easier target. Last September,
along with two guys from the estimable publication Texas
Monthly, we scaled Mount Guadalupe, at 8,751 feet the highest
peak in the Lone Star State. This time the trail went all the
way to the top, so even we couldn't go astray. It was fun,
and emboldened us to try again.
   We picked Mount Harvard because of its impressive height,
scenic locale and accessibility to non-experts. Also, we both
had attended the institution for which it is named. Ray holds
a degree from there in something suitably arcane, like Greek
and Latin studies. I went to the law school only long enough
to make a list of 368 reasons I didn't want to be a lawyer.
   Along with Mounts Yale, Columbia and Princeton, Mount
Harvard is among the so-called Collegiate Peaks. Mounts
Harvard and Yale, a few miles apart, were named by members of
an 1869 expedition led by the intrepid Josiah Whitney. He was
a graduate of Yale and professor of geology at Harvard. The
fact that he named the taller peak after his employer (Mount
Yale measures 14,196 feet) shows that he knew on what side
his bread was buttered. He might have named it for himself,
but he'd already claimed Mount Whitney.
   Our plan was to make the climb in two days to give our
sea-level-bound lungs time to adjust to the altitude. We
arrived in Denver on Tuesday and drove to little Fairplay, at
10,000 feet, to spend the night. My hotel room was on the
second floor, and carrying my suitcase up the one flight of
stairs had me breathing heavily. If anyone needed
acclimatizing, it was me.
   A night's sleep proved beneficial, though, because the
next morning, after driving to the trailhead, we backpacked
the three miles to our campsite in the Horn Fork Basin
beneath the Continental Divide, at about 11,500 feet, with no
ill effects. Ray supplied the tent, one of those new,
featherweight jobs, and it looked comfortable enough. I'd
last camped out in 1962, during Army basic training, and
swore never to do it again (they made us sleep with our
rifles]), but figured one night couldn't be too bad.
   I was wrong. At about 7 p.m. it began to rain, and there
was nowhere to go but the tent. At 8 it was still raining and
dark, and there was nothing to do but sleep. I awoke at 3
a.m. ready to go, but the day wasn't. The next three hours,
listening to Ray snore in the wet, cold blackness, were among
my longest.
   Thursday dawned blessedly clear, and we were on the trail
before 7 a.m. In short order we tromped through the treeline,
"krummholz" (stunted trees and stuff) and alpine tundra. At
about 13,000 feet, at beautiful Bear Lake, the trail petered
out, but we were not dismayed. Confidently reading the rock
(that's mountaineer talk), we approached the summit from the
southeast, first encountering serious boulders at about
13,500 feet. Ray suggested I think of them as large,
irregular steps, and that helped. They proved easier to
negotiate than some grassy-but-steep stretches.
   The last 100 or so feet were a real scramble. At one point
I found myself holding on to a rock while swinging a leg over
a chasm (well, a 10-foot drop) in search of a foothold. But,
like I said, we made it all the way up, and down too.
   Even Ray, the mountain vet, was impressed with our final
push; he rated it a 4 on a 5-point scale of difficulty. I
later talked to Ron Bentall, a trip leader for the Colorado
Mountain Club who has climbed all 53 of the state's
14,000-plus-foot mountains, and he laughed that it was a 2,
or, maybe, a 3. He agreed, though, that we had a right to
feel proud of our effort.
   We were, and now are looking forward and upward. Anyone
know where we can get a Nepali phrasebook?

   Mountaineer Tom Whittaker once hovered
between life and death for 10 days, rallying out of the pain he
incurred in a car accident to persuade doctors to save one of his
feet.
   Nine years later, equipped with a high-tech artificial foot,
Whittaker will join the American Everest Expedition with the goal in
May of becoming the first handicapped climber to conquer the world's
highest peak.
   Watch out if he gets to the top of the world.
   ``That'll blow my drawers off and it will take years to get the
silly grin off my face!'' he laughed.
   Then the man who has devoted his life to helping others overcome
their handicaps addded:
   ``It's a challenge of life as much as a challenge of Everest. You
have to reach deep into yourself to do something like this.''
   Whittaker was driving back to his home in Sun Valley, Idaho, from
a Thanksgiving holiday when an out-of-control car struck his car
head-on. He suffered multiple fractures and damage to both knees.
   ``The original prognosis was they were going to take both feet
off,'' Whittaker, 40, recalled.
   ``I managed to impress on them how important feet are to
mountaineers. I was able to convince them, and they left my foot
intact,'' said Whittaker, who had moved from his native Wales a year
before.
   Surgeons repaired what they could and reconstructed what they
could not of Whittaker's crushed legs. His right foot had to be
amputated, but he still had his left _ and a desire to overcome his
handicap and repay the kindness of a community.
   Before his accident, the mountaineer with expeditions to the
Alps, Spanish Pyrenees and Alaska's Mount McKinley had earned a
master's degree in counseling at Idaho State University and served
as a graduate assistant in an outdoor recreation program.
   The university established a relief fund that helped defray some
of his $30,000 in medical bills not covered by insurance. The school
also provided him with a room and living expenses during the three
months he was bedridden.
   ``I felt I had this debt of gratitude I wanted to pay back to the
community, so I put my master's degree in counseling to work in a
local hospital'' helping others adjust to their handicaps, Whittaker
said in a telephone interview from his Pocatello home.
   While giving a kayaking lesson to a struggling man with a spinal
cord injury, Whittaker noticed tears pouring down the student's face.
   ``I feared I shouldn't have forced him and was trying to blurt
out an apology,'' Whittaker said. ``But he said, `Hey, Whittaker,
you're way off base. You don't need to apologize. This is the first
time I've felt alive in 2{ years.' That basically gives me my
validation for what I do now.''
   Six years ago, he started the university's Cooperative Wilderness
Handicapped Outdoor Group with fewer than 20 students. Today 400 are
enrolled and he lectures throughout the world.
   ``The motto of our group is `Dare to be different.' The whole
idea is to empower people with disabilities and help them with their
personal rehabilitation,'' he explained. ``We're ordinary people
doing stuff; we're not outdoor jocks.
   ``We have children 4 years old, we have disabled people of up to
72 years old in our program _ everybody from kids to grandfathers
and grandmothers.''
   The courage of his students inspired Whittaker, too. Equipped
with an artificial foot fashioned by a blacksmith friend, he
returned to the peaks, climbing Canada's notorious Bugaboos during a
snowstorm in 1981 and scaling the tough north face of Wyoming's
Grand Teton in 1987.
   But until three weeks ago, a shot at conquering Everest was a
dream Whittaker considered out-of-reach. Then came a call from the
Salt Lake City-based American Everest Expedition.
   The March-through-May expedition also includes New Zealand's
Peter Hillary, son of Sir Edmund Hillary. In 1953, the elder Hillary
and the Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay became the first men to conquer
Everest.
   ``When I was involved in my car accident, all hopes and dreams of
aspiring to Everest died for me,'' Whittaker said. ``When the
telephone rang and (I was) asked if I would like to go ... it just
about knocked me off my stool.''
   Expedition co-leader Peter Athans, of Mt. Kisco, N.Y., said that
while Whittaker will be the first handicapped person to assault
Everest, he ``is a very fit and active guy.''
   Whittaker said if he conquers the mountain it will be on his own
merits, not ``on the backs'' of his teammates.
   San Diego's Daw Co. is designing $40,000 worth of new artificial
feet to enable Whittaker to handle a 150-mile trek over snowfields
to the mountain's base camp and the climb itself.
   ``I don't have to go to the top to have a fullfilling
experience,'' said Whittaker, who conceded high-altitude swelling
and circulation problems with his stump could halt his ascent.
   ``To be successful ... we just have to get one of our (team)
members on the summit. I'm a member of the team. All I need to know
is that I've tried hard and did well.''

   Hurricane-force winds that have hampered
the search for three missing Japanese climbers on Mount McKinley
abated somewhat Friday, and an Air Force pilot saw a flash of red or
orange as he flew near the continent's tallest peak.
   Maj. Neal Sharra radioed, however, that he saw no movement in the
area along the missing men's likely route, and officials cautioned
the color might be a box of emergency provisions left for climbers
in trouble.
   The three climbers, who were last seen Feb. 22 while attempting a
rare wintertime ascent of the 20,320-mountain, are equipped with
orange tents and were wearing identical red climbing suits.
   Rescuers were waiting Friday for the wind to die down, hoping
they could fly helicopters near the mountain for a more extensive
search. The Air Force observation plane that saw the color had been
sent up primarily to monitor visibility and turbulence.
   Bob Seibert, a mountaineering ranger with the National Park
Service, said the search, once winds allow it to begin, would first
concentrate on the place where the color was spotted.
   Rescuers were ready to board aircraft early Thursday, but they
remained in Talkeetna hour after hour as winds that at times topped
90 mph persisted around Mount McKinley, 65 miles to the northwest.
   By Friday morning, Seibert said, the weather ``looks different
than it has for the past week and a half. I feel better (about it)
than I did yesterday.''
   Chief Warrant Officer Myron Babcock, leader of the Army rescue
team, agreed that the winds were not as bad, ``but they're still
twice as high as we'd like them to be.''
   The climbers' rations probably ran out days ago, but the Park
Service has a cache of food, fuel and water at 17,200 feet along
with a semi-permanent ice cave, officials said.
   ``If they stayed put (at 17,200 camp), they'd be fine,'' said
Roger Robinson, a Park Service mountaineering ranger. ``The
resources there are phenomenal.''
   It was that brightly colored box of provisions that might have
caught the eye of the pilot, Seibert said.
   The Japanese last were seen by a three-man Austrian climbing
team. The Austrians were descending the mountain, and the Japanese
were climbing. There have been six successful winter ascents since
1967, with four climber deaths during that period, the Park Service
says.
   Although the Japanese are equipped with a radio, its use and
range is limited. ``They have a little FM radio,'' Robinson said.
``It's pretty restrictive as to who you can talk to.''
   Members of the Japanese party are leader Noboru Yamada, 39, Teruo
Saegusa, 31, and Kozo Komatsu, 34, all of Tokyo.

First Feats on Mount Everest,
It Seems, Are All Taken;

   Ned Gillette's friends think he is crazy.
His partner quit and the winds and ice were against him, yet he spent two months recently at the southern tip of Chile hoping to row to Antarctica.

   That's right, row.
He and three companions were poised to brave 600 miles of storm-tossed sea and ice in a 28-foot craft named Sea Tomato for its shape.
The feat would have been a first, but the brief Antarctic summer is fading without the wind they hoped for.
So Mr. Gillette, who hails from Stowe, Vt., ski country, called off the trip until next year and, just for fun, went ski-touring on the frozen continent.

   True, a boat trip to the Antarctic isn't the same as conquering Mount Everest, but achieving firsts is what counts to professional adventurers, and all the firsts on Everest seem to have already been achieved.
Seekers of the limelight have even hang-glided from the mountain and kayaked down it.

   In fact, Mr. Gillette himself has conquered Everest: Too late to beat Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norkay to the 29,028-foot summit, he became the first to ski and hike around it.
His girlfriend, Jan Reynolds, circled it by balloon.

   In their thirst for firsts, or seconds, many adventurers besides Mr. Gillette are going to polar extremes.
Paul Schurke and six friends last year mushed dog sleds to the North Pole from Canada's Ellesmere Island.
Without resupply, they hauled gear over countless ice ridges and floated it across stretches of open water in temperatures as low as 68 degrees below zero.
Their achievement duplicated the 1909 feat of Adm. Robert Peary, but they ran into more passers-by than Peary did.

   On their way across the moving ice pack, they bumped into French physician Jean-Louis Etienne, who was skiing to the pole.
Returning, they met a pair of Frenchmen trying to fly there on ultralight aircraft -- basically hang gliders with motors. (One crashed; bad weather blocked the other.)

   Clearly the icecaps are beginning to crawl with people.
One Canadian tried riding a motorcycle to the North Pole, but his dirt bike couldn't climb the ice ridges.
It stands permanently parked in the snow of Ellesmere Island, facing north.
The handlebars are said to be stuffed with President Reagan's favorite emergency rations: jellybeans.

   Australian millionaire Dick Smith prefers posher vehicles.
Having circled the globe by helicopter, he tried twice last year to fly his chopper to the North Pole.
Once his navigation instruments froze, and the second time a generator gave out.
This month Arctic temperatures grounded two pilots trying to make the first pole-to-pole circle of the earth by single-engine prop plane.
"Everything froze," a spokeswoman explains.

   Pam Flowers, a 95-pound veteran of Alaska's 1,100-mile Iditarod dog-sled race, hopes this spring to become the first woman to make a solo mush to the North Pole.

   But the title of the world's most polarized people goes to the Japanese.
The late Naomi Uemura was the first to reach the North Pole alone by dog sled.
He inspired Mitsuro Oba, a rice and chicken farmer, to make the first round-trip hike to the magnetic north pole, about 750 miles south of the geographic pole.
Actress Masako Izumi roared off for the geographic pole by snowmobile, but an early thaw forced her back.

   Polar popularity brings an annual migration to the tiny village of Resolute Bay, Canada (population 160).
"Every spring it is teeming with crazies," says outfitter Barton Lewis.
The attempts start in late February, when the light begins reaching the Arctic, and there isn't much time because the ice breaks up only a couple of months later.

   Another outfitter in Resolute Bay, Bezal Jesudason, says the local Eskimos view the expeditions with bemusement.
"They're practical people," he says, so when a group of adventurers walks off for the pole, "they wonder why they would do that when they could go by snowmobile."

   As the Arctic grows more crowded, many adventurers are gravitating to the opposite pole.
Mr. Schurke and his partner, Will Steger, hope to be the first to cross Antarctica by dogsled.
And since teams from Germany and Idaho have similar ambitions, a race may ensue.
"It's one of the last true adventures that haven't been done, other than doing it by pogo sticks," says Mr. Lewis, the outfitter.

   The toughest obstacle may not be the temperature but cold, hard cash.
Mr. Lewis calculates that the Steger-Schurke expedition, supplied by aircraft, will cost $3 million.

   Antarctic logistics make the Arctic seem accessible by comparison.
Tall mountains, coastal ice and sheer vastness make it hard to reach by air or sea.
Last year a British group walked to the South Pole but had to be rescued by the U.S. National Science Foundation after ice crushed the boat that was to have been used for the return voyage.

   Just last month, a team led by Norwegian Monica Kristensen kept the NSF's Antarctic staff on pins and needles.
The team failed to reach the South Pole by dog sleds or to arrange a rescue flight.
But it finally straggled back to the Bay of Whales just in time to meet a ship.

   The foundation is unhappy in its role as the continent's rescuer of last resort, a role that diverts equipment, time and money from scientific research.
Peter Wilkniss, the NSF's polar-programs director, talks of making expeditions post a rescue bond before setting out.

   The search for the unusual is drawing even tourists to the poles.
Adventure-travel agencies now take well-heeled travelers to Antarctica to view coastal wildlife and climb 16,863-foot Vinson Massif.
Several agencies fly people to the North Pole for champagne breakfast, hosted in one case by Edmund Hillary and astronaut Neil Armstrong.
Like the expeditions, these trips aren't for tight budgets.
The price of a planned visit to the South Pole is $25,000 per person.

   Even Antarctic firsts are becoming hard to find.
Chris Bonnington, a British climber who has led several Everest expeditions, plans an assault on an 8,000-foot side of a peak in Antarctica's remote Ellsworth Mountains, but the peak itself has already been scaled by another route.
And Italian Reinhold Messner, who was first to climb Everest without oxygen, conquered Vinson Massif last year in hopes of claiming the title of first to scale the tallest peaks on seven continents, but two rival climbers assert they beat him to the title.

   When it comes to conjuring up "firsts," few have shown more imagination than Mr. Gillette, who remains determined to row his Sea Tomato to Antarctica.

   Antarctic rowing isn't entirely new.
Explorer Ernest Shackleton and his crew rowed and sailed a small boat to one of the Falkland Islands from Antarctica in 1916, after their ship Endurance was crushed by ice.

   But no one has rowed to Antarctica or reached it in such a small boat, Mr. Gillette says.
In today's competitive adventure business, he explains, "you have to differentiate yourself."

<DATELINE>SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sequoia celebrates its
centennial Tuesday as the second-oldest national park with its
superintendent hoping the home of the world's biggest trees will be
even better 100 years from now.
   A 13,255-foot mountain, one of thousands in the Sierra Nevada
range that forms California's spine, will be named Centennial peak
during a brief ceremony honoring both Sequoia and its slightly
younger cousin, Kings Canyon National Park.
   However, most of the celebration was on Sunday when people were
invited to visit the adjacent parks free and learn about their
history and future. Sequoia, 150 miles northeast of Los Angeles,
became a national park six days before Kings Canyon and their more
celebrated neighbor 80 miles north, Yosemite.
   President Benjamin Harrison signed legislation on Sept. 25,
1890, making Sequoia the second national park. Yellowstone was
established in 1872.
   At first, only 500 people a year visited the California parks
because they were so remote in the days before cars. Now, more than
1.6 million people a year visit Sequoia and Kings Canyon.
   That has caused park officials to start reducing human impact by
moving public facilities out of Sequoia's Giant Forest area, a
process that will take at least until the beginning of the 21st
century.
   ``We want to avoid designing facilities that lure people to one
spot and cause a crowd,'' Superintendent J. Thomas Ritter said as
he stood near the General Sherman tree, the largest living thing in
the world at 272 feet tall and containing 63,664 cubic feet of
lumber.
   The goal, he said, is to disperse people to points of interest
and programs spread throughout the park. ``If we are successful
today and the next 100 years, we will have overcome our biggest
potential problem,'' he said.
   Ritter noted that the task of dispersing people is easier over
the large area of Sequoia-Kings Canyon than at Yosemite, where
almost all the 3 million visitors a year want to visit narrow
Yosemite Valley.
   Visitors to Kings Canyon can travel to Grant Grove and look at
the General Grant Tree, officially the Nation's Christmas Tree, or
camp and hike along the John Muir Trail to high country lakes
formed by melting snow.
   Others can head south through the tall pines and firs of Sequoia
to the even taller and broader trees, many of them growing since
before Jesus was born.
   People can take a healthy hike a few hundred feet up to Moro
Rock and look over the western divide or a much longer, harder hike
up Mount Whitney, at 14,495 feet above sea level the tallest
mountain in the contiguous 48 states.
   ``The people clearly have to come on the natural terms of the
park,'' Ritter said. ``But the geography is in our favor.''

<HEAD>High Wind Keeps Deaf and Blind Climbers From McKinley Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALKEETNA, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international team that includes two
blind climbers, a deaf climber and an amputee nearly made it to the
top of Mount McKinley, but 50 mph winds forced them to turn around,
officials said Thursday.
   The group got up to at least 18,000 feet, said Roger Robinson, a
U.S. Park Service ranger. At 20,320 feet, Mount McKinley is North
America's highest mountain.
   ``They've all descended. They're at 14,000 now. Indications are
they're not going back up,'' he said.
   ``They did very good considering that only about half the folks
that try McKinley make it to the top.''
   The ascent was attempted by 1,009 climbers last year; only 524
reached the summit.
   Adaptations were made for the disabled climbers.
   ``Apparently they've got ropes stretched out to the latrines when
they're at camps,'' said Bob Seiber, chief mountaineering ranger.
``They work extremely well together and develop their other senses,
I guess.''
   Patrick Reinhart, a member of the expedition and director of
Challenge Alaska, a group that helps develop recreational and sports
opportunities for disabled climbers, came up with the idea for the
ascent.
   Reinhart, who has an artificial foot, always wanted to climb
McKinley. So did Ross Watson, a Canadian member of the expedition
who lost his sight at age 12 in a pellet gun accident.
   Patrick Hurst, a 27-year-old Englishman who teaches outdoor
sports to physically disabled people, also is blind.
   Lkakpa Sonam, a Sherpa from Nepal, is deaf.
   In overall charge of the expedition is George Rooney, a member of
the American Alpine Club who's been up McKinley twice and tried
climbing Everest in a joint American-Polish expediton. He's also an
emergency medical technician and a specialist in mountain rescue.

on the Richter scale and was centered in the San Gabriel Mountains about eight
miles north of Sierra Madre.;    A thrust quake occurs when one block of the
ground moves up and over another block of the ground.;    Scientists suspect
today's quake occurred on the Sierra Madre Fault, which runs along the base of
the San Gabriel Mountains from Upland to San Fernando, almost 50 miles.;    If
the quake did occur on that fault, only a small segment of the fault ruptured
or the quake would have been stronger, Jones said.;    Southern California
straddles the boundary of two great plates that make up Earth's crust -- the
Pacific Plate, which is under the ocean and part of Southern California, and
the North American Plate, which is under the rest of the continent.;    As the
plates slide past each other, quakes occur on numerous "strike-slip" faults,
such as the San Andreas, on which ground slides horizontally past ground on
the other side of the fault.;    But the two gigantic plates also squeeze
together, creating thrust faults and mountains that parallel the Southern
California coast.;    Quakes on such faults built the San Gabriel, San
Bernardino, San Jacinto and Santa Ynez mountains.;    She said the Sierra
Madre Fault has not produced a sizable earthquake in the past 10,000 years.;
 There were roughly 20 to 30 small aftershocks during the first 90 minutes
after the quake, said Egill Hauksson, director of the seismological laboratory
at Caltech.;    Seven of those aftershocks were larger than 2.0 on the Richter
scale, including a magnitude 3.5 jolt at 8:37 a.m., Caltech seismologist Kate
Hutton said.;    The number of aftershocks always is greatest within the first
hours of a big jolt.;    Caltech scientists fanned out into the San Gabriel
Mountains carrying devices that radio precise positions on the ground to
orbiting satellites of the Global Positioning System. That will help them
determine precisely how Earth's surface was deformed during the earthquake,
Jones said.;    Scientists prepared to place a "coffin" -- a large box
containing four seismometers and three strong motion detectors -- on a peak
near Mount Wilson. That will help researchers get detailed information on any
large aftershocks.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   What Sir Edmund Hillary recalls most
vividly about standing at the top of Mount Everest 35 years ago is
the ice _ prickly, biting slivers of ice billowing around like a
white halo.
   ``They bore into your face, cutting and tingling,'' he said.
``And exhilarating.''
   On May 29, 1953, Hillary and the Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay
became the first men to conquer the world's tallest mountain.
   Neither Hillary nor Norgay, who died in 1986, ever said who got
there first.
   ``We reached it together, that's all,'' Hillary said in an
interview, abruptly ending any further discussion of the question.
   Since their ascent, 202 men and women have followed them up the
massive 29,028-foot mountain on the border of Nepal and Tibet.
   To many, Everest symbolizes the literal and figurative high
point of a mountaineer's career.
   But Hillary views it as ``a beginning rather than the end of
adventurous activity.''
   It won the New Zealander a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II.
More important, he said, it earned him the financial backing to
climb scores of other peaks in the Himalayan chain, to trek to the
South Pole and even to go off on a lark, an unfruitful quest for
``yeti,'' the legendary abominable snowman.
   Hillary, now 68, now spends much of his time behind desks in the
capitals of India, Nepal and Bangladesh as New Zealand's ambassador
to all three countries.
   Although his broad shoulders and 6-foot-3-inch frame suggest he
could still take on Everest, he holds to trekking, hiking and other
lower-altitude sports.
   ``I'm finding the hills are getting steeper,'' he said.
   Friends, including the Indian teen-agers he has led on
white-water rafting trips and the tribal Sherpa children he visits
at mountain schools, call him ``Sir Ed.''
   Born Edmund Percival Hillary in Auckland on July 20, 1919, he
spent a good deal of his childhood reading adventure books and
daydreaming.
   ``There was a phase when I was the `fastest gun in the West,'
another when I explored the Antarctic,'' Hillary said. ``I would
walk for hours with my mind drifting to all these things.''
   There wasn't much money available in his family for adventure,
however. His father, a newspaper editor-turned-beekeeper, was
``energetic and very active but never very good at making money.''
   Hillary took up skiing in high school but didn't try climbing
until he was 19 or 20. His first summit was the 7,500-foot Mount
Olivier in southern New Zealand.
   ``It wasn't a difficult mountain by any manner or means, but
making it through the snow to the ridge, then along the ridge and
up to the summit really captured me,'' Hillary recalled. ``It was
then that I resolved I was going to do a lot more mountains. And I
did.''
   Hillary was already a veteran of numerous Indian Himalayan peaks
when he was asked to join a British expedition in 1951 to the
Everest region. The reconnaissance team explored the Khumbu glacier
and an ice fall in the shadow of the great mountain.
   ``We were the first to realize there was a potential route up
Everest from the south side,'' he said.
   Two years later, he and Norgay and 11 others set out with the
British Everest Expedition on that route. Hillary was 33 at the
time, Norgay 38. At least 14 expeditions before them had failed.
   Hillary said their equipment was less sophisticated than the
gear available now. Although they had early nylon ropes and oxygen
cylinders, they struggled with primitive, metal-spiked clampons for
their boots and ice axes that lacked the curve that facilitates
vertical climbing nowadays.
   There was also a psychological barrier: ``Physicians had warned
us that even if we got to the top with oxygen, we might collapse
and die because of the thin air.''
   Just short of the summit, Hillary and Norgay hit what appeared
to be an insurmountable obstacle, a vertical ``rock step'' 40 feet
high. Maneuvering carefully, they found a crack where the ice was
breaking away from the rock and eased their way up. The spot is
known to mountaineers today as ``Hillary's step.''
   Hillary says he is most often asked if reaching the summit was
accompanied by some religious or spiritual experience.
   ``For me, no,'' Hillary said. ``It was mostly a sense of
satisfaction and surprise actually.'' Norgay, he said, was more
emotional.
   ``I shook his hand,'' Hillary recalled. ``He threw his arms
around my shoulders and gave me a tremendous hug.'' Later, Norgay,
a Buddhist, buried bits of candy and biscuits in the snow as ``a
gift to the gods,'' Hillary said.
   Atop Everest, Hillary said, he quickly found his attention
turning to other unconquered peaks. With the ice particles cutting
into his face and frosting his cheeks, he scanned nearby Makalu
peak (27,807 feet) and worked out a climbing route.
   Hillary failed in an attempt on Makalu in 1954, but a French
team made it up several years later.
   If his vocation today is diplomacy and the outdoors, his
avocation is working to improve the lot of the poor Sherpa
tribesmen who live in the hills below Everest.
   Since 1961, he has raised about $200,000 a year to build
schools, hospitals and water systems for the Sherpas of Nepal.
   The effort has cost him more than time and energy. His wife
Louise and 16-year-old daughter Belinda were killed in a plane
crash in 1975 en route to join him at one of his Sherpa hospitals.
   His son Peter, 33, of Melbourne, Australia, makes his living as
a ski instructor and mountaineer. Peter has failed twice in efforts
to climb Everest. A daughter, Sarah, 31, is an art restorer in
Auckland.
   Thirteen people have climbed Everest more than once, including
the Nepali Sungdare Sherpa who has been to the top four times.
   But Hillary said he never had any desire to repeat the trip.
   ``There were so many other mountains.''

   Ten years. Time enough for a
forest to spring from lifeless ash. Time enough for people in the
shadow of a restless volcano to recover, even profit, from
catastrophe.
   But never time enough to forget.
   Even as nature heals this shattered mountain with a blanket of
green, the violence of May 18, 1980, remains seared in memory. That
was the day Mount St. Helens exploded, killing 57 people,
flattening a forest and spitting out an ash cloud that circled the
globe.
   Don McElwain remembers. He was camping 20 miles away when hot
ash engulfed him, turning his day to night.
   ``I'm a former Army Ranger and not much scares me,'' he said.
``But I'll tell you, I was doing some praying.''
   McElwain and two camping partners barely escaped on horseback,
breathing through rags torn from their shirts as they rode across
ash that singed the hair on the horses' legs.
   But the ordeal did not destroy his love of Mount St. Helens.
Like many of the volcano's neighbors, McElwain, 53, hopes to profit
from a disaster that changed this region's economic life as surely
as it rearranged the landscape. He's been scouting out land,
thinking of starting up a small tourist resort.
   ``Someday,'' he said, ``this place will be beautiful again.''
   Before it erupted, Mount St. Helens was a snowy, symmetrical,
seemingly dormant volcano surrounded by tall evergreen forests.
Thousands of campers experienced their first real wilderness along
crystal-clear Spirit Lake, on the mountain's north side.
   The idyll couldn't last. Mount St. Helens, historically one of
the Cascade Range's most active volcanoes, had not erupted since
1857. Geologists warned it was overdue.
   At 8:32 a.m. on May 18, 1980, after weeks of sputtering and
rumbling, the volcano roared awake. An earthquake jarred loose a
huge slab that slid into the lake, weakening the mountain's north
side.
   Magma that for months had risen slowly up the volcano's vents
suddenly let loose in a sideways explosion of gas, rock and ash
2,500 times more powerful than the atomic bomb that destroyed
Hiroshima.
   A super-heated cloud of pulverized rock, focused horizontally by
the misshapen crater, flattened 150-foot-tall fir trees like pieces
of straw. Across Spirit Lake, a mammoth wave caused by the
landslide sloshed over the opposite ridge, washing the slopes bare
of the downed timber.
   Victims caught in the blast included U.S. Geological Survey
scientist David Johnston, killed even as he monitored delicate
measuring devices on a ridge 5 miles away. Photographer Reid
Blackburn snapped a few pictures, then retreated to his car. He was
found two days later, smothered by ash.
   Harry Truman, who had lived on the mountain 54 years, defied
orders to leave his Spirit Lake lodge, declaring, ``That mountain
is a part of Truman, and I'm a part of it.''
   His words were prophetic. Truman and his lodge were buried under
120 feet of debris and 180 feet of the new, deeper Spirit Lake, a
steaming cauldron of mud and water covered by a floating layer of
uprooted trees scoured of bark.
   The volcano's heat melted glaciers and starting surging
mudflows. One wall of mud 12 feet high swept down the Toutle River,
destroying trucks, bridges and more than 200 homes.
   An ash plume rose 14 miles into the air and drifted eastward,
darkening three states and choking towns with ashfalls up to 6
inches deep.
   To observers first returning to the mountain, the destruction
seemed complete. But as weeks went by, scientists watched in
amazement as life appeared amid the ruin.
   Pocket gophers burrowed up from their tunnels, poking their
heads through ash. Colonies of ants went busily about their
business. Even the most barren areas were soon invaded by
ballooning spiders and beetles, scavengers that floated in on
parachute-like webs and survived on the remains of other insects
blown their way.
   The first summer, green shoots of fireweed and huckleberry rose
through 10-inch layers of ash. Later, elk and deer wandered back,
and the windblown seeds of alders and evergreens sprouted in
fertile patches where water and wind had eroded the ash.
   Inside the Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument, a
110,000-acre preserve created in 1982 for watching natural
regeneration, the pioneering evergreens now are 4 to 6 inches tall.
Outside the monument, the U.S. Forest Service and logging companies
gave nature a jump start, salvaging downed trees and planting
seedlings in holes bored through ash. Today, some of those trees
stand 25 feet tall.
   As nature heals, so do people. After the eruption, communities
still grieving for victims started crawling out and slowly cleaning
up.
   Fearing more floods, the Army Corps of Engineers dredged rivers,
built levees and bored a drainage tunnel to Spirit Lake. This May
19, officials will dedicate a sediment retention dam on the Toutle
River, finishing a decade of recovery work costing more than $560
million.
   Muddy rivers have grown clearer, and many residents now look to
St. Helens in hope, not fear. They're staking their futures on the
flood of tourists coming to see the only active volcano in the
contiguous United States.
   More than a million visitors each year drive to viewpoints or
stop at a Forest Service visitor center 30 miles from the volcano.
Almost 50,000 have climbed the volcano's south side since entry
restrictions were eased in 1987.
   Roadside gift shops specialize in volcano souvenirs, and the
once-flooded town of Toutle sponsors an annual Volcano Daze
Festival. Developers are preparing for 1992, when a highway will be
extended to a new visitor's center peering into the volcano's
crater.
   On sunny spring weekends, the mountain's southern flank becomes
a playground for up to 400 climbers and skiers. There are higher
Northwest mountains for climbing, more accessible mountains for
skiing. But Mount St. Helens, its former 9,677-foot summit reduced
1,300 feet by the eruption, has a magnetic appeal.
   ``I think it's a morbid curiosity,'' said Martha Miller, peering
into the barren crater from the rim after a grueling, six-hour
climb on skis.
   ``It's the mystique,'' said her husband, Ben, who skied the
volcano partly to impress friends back home in New Hampshire, where
the mountains are more sedate. ``St. Helens is an an active
volcano, and everyone's heard of it.''
   Ten years is a blink of an eye in geologic time, and the volcano
still sputters. The latest steam release occurred April 25.
   Scientists don't rule out more fireworks but say the possibility
of an eruption is low. A 920-foot lava dome on the crater floor has
not grown since 1986, and geologists, who have honed their
predictive skills since 1980, are confident they can give days or
weeks notice of significant eruptions.
   That's scant reassurance at the volcano rim, where the
mountain's jagged wounds are still raw, its destructive power still
overwhelming. Silent fields of snow and towers of rock dwarfed the
skiers as they stared into the immense crater.
   Ten years later, Mount St. Helens still commands respect.
   ``It makes you feel pretty small,'' Martha Miller said. She
turned her back to a chill wind blowing up from the crater, and the
skiers headed down to the springtime warmth of the forest, far
below.

<TEXT>
   Add one more issue to the list of conundrums
Congress will have to unravel when it returns from its summer
recess next month: whether the tallest mountain in North America
should be renamed.
   It's a perennial duel between an Ohio congressman protecting the
honor of William McKinley, the 25th U.S. president after whom the
peak is named, and an Alaska senator defending his state's right to
name its own land features.
   The motives of Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, are easy to discern.
   ``His long-range goal is to see if the mountain can be renamed
with Alaskans' wishes,'' says Connie Godwin, his spokeswoman.
   It takes only a quick look at the background of Rep. Ralph
Regula, R-Ohio, to explain why he cares about the name of the
20,320-foot mountain in central Alaska, a continent away from the
people he represents.
   ``McKinley is from my district,'' Regula says.
   McKinley, assassinated in 1901, was not only from Regula's
district, but once held Regula's seat in Congress and is buried in
the district. Regula is even a graduate of the William McKinley
School of Law.
   McKinley _ the mountain _ is in Denali National Park, which was
renamed in 1980 from McKinley National Park. Denali is an Indian
word for ``The Great One,'' and many Alaskans would like to see the
mountain bear the same name.
   ``It's owned by 230 million Americans,'' Regula said last week.
``Alaska gets millions of dollars in taxes, and taxpayers from the
entire country have a right to decide what happens there.''
   A provision forbidding the government to rename the mountain was
buried in the fine print of the annual Interior Department spending
bill that the House passed July 12. When the Senate approved its
version of the legislation two weeks later, the Mt. McKinley
language was removed.
   It's a legislative dance that has been going on for years, and
Regula has always prevailed.
   ``Ted goes along with a one-year prohibition, but not with
statutorily naming it Mt. McKinley,'' says Regula.
   Like most geographic features, Mt. McKinley was not given its
name by law. Rather, its name is officially recognized by the Board
of Geographic Names, a division of the Interior Department.
   It was named Mt. McKinley in 1896, when McKinley was Ohio
governor and the Republican presidential candidate against Democrat
William Jennings Bryan.
   In 1975, the Alaska state legislature passed a resolution
requesting that the park and the mountain be renamed to Denali.
Congressional hearings were held two years later. In a compromise,
the park was renamed in 1980 but the mountain retained its name.
   Negotiators from the two chambers probably will meet next month
to work out a compromise bill.

<HEAD>Austrian Team Reportedly Reached Mount McKinley Summit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALKEETNA, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A three-member Austrian party have
reported reaching the summit of Mount McKinley, according to the
pilot who flew them to North America's highest mountain two weeks
ago.
   A Japanese party was reported ``high on the mountain,'' and a
lone climber from Anchorage hopes to reach the top via the
treacherous Cassin Ridge route, the National Park Service said.
   Pilot Doug Geeting said Monday he established radio contact with
the Austrian party Sunday and was told all three members had reached
the summit of the 20,320-foot mountain.
   Geeting said the Austrians didn't say which day they reached the
top. Monday, they were at a base camp at 7,200 feet, awaiting a
flight out, but harsh weather restricted aviation.
   Up to this year, mountaineers had accomplished winter ascents of
McKinley nine times, with most traveling in parties. In 1988, Vern
Tejas, a professional climbing guide from Anchorage, became the
first person to climb McKinley alone in the winter and survive the
trip.
   The Austrian party of professional guides led by Helmut
Steinmassl, 29, began its expedition Feb. 14, a day before the
Japanese party of three began its ascent. Geeting and the Park
Service said the exact location of the Japanese climbers was not
known. The group was led by Nobura Yamada, 39.
   ``All we've heard about the Japanese is that they're hunkered
down,'' Park Service Ranger Bob Seibert said. ``I'm sure they can't
move in those winds.''
   The Austrians had relatively favorable weather for their climb,
Seibert said, but conditions changed drastically by Monday as fierce
gusts swept over wide regions of Alaska, including the McKinley area.
   The solo climber, 33-year-old Dave Staley, began his climb Sunday
and planned to follow the Cassin Ridge route, Park Service spokesman
John Quinley said. Such an ascent has been accomplished only once by
a team and never by an individual climber, he said.
   The Cassin Ridge is ``a lot steeper than the West Buttress
(route) ... and it has a lot fewer sheltered camping sites,''
Quinley said.

<HEAD>Authorities Rescue Hikers Trapped on Mount Whitney By Storm</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 2nd graf to UPDATE with identification of victim.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONE PINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rescuers brought more stranded climbers
down from towering Mount Whitney on Sunday, a day after lightning
struck a stone hut and killed one of the 13 hikers seeking shelter
there from a thunderstorm.
   The body of Matthew Nordbrock, 26, of Orange was flown Saturday
from the summit of 14,495-foot Whitney, the tallest mountain in the
contiguous United States, said Ann Melle, Inyo County sheriff's
spokeswoman.
   Four other people who suffered minor injuries, exposure and
burns also were rescued from the mountain Saturday. Three were
treated and released, while the fourth was admitted to Southern
Inyo Hospital in Lone Pine, Ms. Melle said.
   Eight more mountain enthusiasts who had crowded into the 12
feet-by-12 feet cabin were plucked from the mountain by cargo
helicopter about 6 a.m. Sunday. They and two other climbers, who
had made camp at a lower elevation, also were flown to the hospital
for treatment.
   The deadly lightning bolt struck about 3:30 p.m. Saturday in the
middle of a raging thunderstorm. Several hikers raced down from the
summit for help and met someone with a two-way radio, said
sheriff's Lt. Jack Goodrich.
   The frantic radio SOS was intercepted by a jetliner passing
overhead. Pilots notified air traffic controllers at Los Angeles
International Airport and the controllers passed the emergency call
on to Inyo County authorities.
   Rescue efforts began shortly before nightfall. The victim was
pronounced dead at the hospital about an hour after he was brought
in.
   The stone structure the hikers packed into was built in 1909 for
astronomers. It is not recommended as a shelter.
   ``The hut at the top is not there for hikers,'' Ms. Melle said.
``It's just an old, old structure. This is back country area.
Anyone who is up here is expected to be prepared. Mountain tops are
dangerous places to be.''
   Authorities had no plans to close the trail, Ms. Melle said.
   ``Mount Whitney is known for unusual storms,'' she said. ``It's
a very severe peak. Bad weather conditions are expected and weather
forecasts had predicted bad conditions.''
   Ms. Melle said up to 300 people attempt to scale the mountain
each day during the busy summer climbing season. Experienced
mountaineers usually take two days to hike the roughly 16 miles to
Mount Whitney's summit from the trailhead at 9,000 feet, near Lone
Pine.
   The mountain's majestic peak can be seen for miles along the
eastern Sierra Nevada range.

   On Sports: Fifty States of Exaltation
   ----

WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A5

<LP>
   I generally do not cheer my countrymen's penchant for
turning pastimes into manias, but one has come to my
attention that I think deserves at least polite applause.
It's called "highpointing," and it's nothing less than the
pursuit of the highest ground in all 50 of these United
States.
   Highpointing combines the joys and athleticism of mountain
hiking with whimsy and moments of sheer terror. The whimsy
comes mostly because the peaks of some of our flatter states
are not peaks at all but merely bumps that are a bit higher
than surrounding bumps, and their challenge isn't so much in
the climbing as in the finding.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The terror, of course, can occur at moments when, on
climbs of even modest difficulty, a foothold crumbles or a
chasm must be traversed. "You can find air under your butt in
unexpected places," says Don Holmes, an engineer from La
Mirada, Calif., who has bagged 44 high points. "That's what
makes the whole thing interesting."
   To date, 19 individuals have the distinction of having
conquered all 50. They're a diverse lot, ranging in age of
achievement from 22 years old to more than 70, and in
residence from the stately Rocky Mountain states to such
plain and plainlike ones as Oklahoma and Missouri. Two of
them are women, including the latest to make the list. She's
Donna Allsup, a school administrator from Little Rock, Ark.
   One man, Adrian Crane of Modesto, Calif., negotiated his
50 in a 101-day blitz. Another, and more sensible, fellow,
Jack Parsell of Beaver Falls, N.Y., savored the experience by
allowing 50 years to elapse between his first and his 50th.
   Almost a score of others have 40 or more high points to
their credit and, thus, are within striking distance of 50.
They include the wife and two sons of Jack Bennett, an Ohioan
who has reached the 50 mark. They do not include Shatz, the
German shepherd dog of the above-mentioned Mrs. Allsup, who
is said to have climbed 40.
   "What we have in common, I guess, is that we're
list-makers and recordkeepers," says Jack Longacre of
Mountain Home, Ark., who not only has bagged all 50 but
started an organization, called -- naturally -- the
Highpointers Club, which encourages the pursuit. Its
membership now exceeds 400.
   He adds: "It's a frequent accusation that we're also a bit
nuts. I don't think that's true in my own case, but I can't
vouch for everyone in our group."
   One other thing that highpointers share is access to
wheels, because getting to some states' peaks is a lot more
trouble than mounting them. According to Don Holmes's book
"Highpoints of the United States," a guide to the lofty 50
published by Cordillera Press of Evergreen, Colo., 16 can be
reached most easily by auto (Delaware's, elevation 442 feet,
is at a road intersection), and a dozen others require little
more than a walk of a few hundred yards through some woods or
across a field.
   "In a few states, including Iowa, Missouri, North Dakota
and Oklahoma, the high points are on private property, and
the owners like you to get their permission before entering,"
Holmes notes. "That's usually no problem, though, because
they're in such remote places that they're glad for the
company."
   This does not mean that the lesser high points are pieces
of cake. Indiana's, for example, lacks a definitive marker,
and while guide books can direct hikers to the proper field,
the exact summit (elevation 1,257 feet) can be elusive. A
group of Highpointers Club members dragged surveying gear
around the site for a day last April in an effort to nail it
down.
   (Some, however, are quite easy to find. Iowa's is on a
cattle-feeding trough on a farm in Osceola County, and the
farmer has put an expired license plate reading "HIGH PT" on
the structure's roof.)
   At the other extreme are six peaks whose conquest requires
technical mountaineering skill and more than a bit of luck
with the weather. That list includes Mount Hood in Oregon,
Mount Rainier in Washington, Granite Peak in Montana, Gannett
Peak in Wyoming, Borah Peak in Idaho and Mount McKinley in
Alaska.
   The last, at 20,320 feet the highest on the North American
continent, is the toughest, hands down. It's a windswept,
32-mile trek over snow, ice and rock that usually takes about
three weeks in weather that can change for the much-worse
with little warning. The success rate is estimated at 50%,
and only the most intrepid climbers try it. Backpacker
magazine summarizes its difficulty as follows: "Do it right
or die."
   The 53-year-old Longacre, who in 1983 climbed the big
mountain that's called "Denali" by local Indians, elaborates:
"It's the cold and nearness to the Arctic Circle that makes
Denali a killer; the air seems thinner at 20,000 feet there
than at 24,000 feet in other parts of the world. I'm
sometimes asked how it can be verified that people who say
they climbed all the high points really did it. The answer is
simple: Everybody in climbing knows who's done Denali. And if
you've done it, there's no need to lie about any of the
rest."
   But Longacre continues that even if Mount McKinley is
beyond a person's reach -- and it certainly is for many --
highpointing still can be rewarding. "In between Denali and
those silly ones in the Midwest are some beautiful climbs
that ordinary people in good physical condition can
accomplish with no special difficulty. Mount Rogers in
Virginia, on the Appalachian Trail, is one. Guadalupe Peak in
Texas is another {I know] I climbed it]} Mount Elbert in
Colorado is a third. Some of my best days have been spent in
places like those."
   Jerry Wagener, a computer scientist who lives in Tulsa,
Okla., agrees; last year he and his son, Jeff, became the
first father-son team to complete the 50. Jerry was 53 years
old at the end of the two-and-a-half year effort, Jeff was
22.
   "We got a thrill out of climbing McKinley, sure, but just
being up on any real mountain, anywhere, nearly matches it,"
says he. "That whole period when Jeff and I were climbing
together was the high point of my life."
   I don't think he intended any pun.

   A Frenchman who already holds the record
for the fastest ascent of Mount Everest has climbed the world's
tallest mountain again with two compatriots, the Tourism Ministry
said.
   A ministry statement said Marc Batard, a 39-year-old alpine
guide, reached the top of the 29,028-foot mountain Friday through
the traditional southeast ridge.
   The statement, citing a radio message from the base camp, said
Batard was accompanied by Pascal Tour Naire, a 40-year-old
photographer, and the team physician, Christin Janin, 32.
   Five hours before the three men reached the top, another
Frenchman, Eric de Camp, 35, and two Nepalese Sherpa guides reached
the peak.
   Batard had climbed the Everest in 1988 in 22 hours, the fastest
ascent ever by a mountaineer. It was not known how long he took to
reach the peak Friday.

<HEAD>Man Conquers North America's Highest Peak Solo; Lives To Talk

<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American, the first mountaineer to
conquer North America's highest peak alone in winter, left a
Japanese flag atop Mount McKinley to honor the man who tried _ and
failed _ before him.
   Vern Tejas ended a monthlong ordeal of screaming winds and
subzero temperatures on Tuesday, picked up by plane on McKinley's
flank and flown to Anchorage, 130 miles to the south.
   During the climb Tejas often thought about Japanese climber
Naomi Uemura, the only other person to reach the 20,320-foot summit
in a solo winter climb but who disappeared during his descent in
February 1984 and was never found.
   ``Many times I was wondering, `Is this where he slipped? Is this
where he lost it?' '' Tejas said Tuesday in Anchorage.
   ``I think I figured out where he bought the farm up there. There
was one area, on summit day, I was coming back down. It's very
steep, very exposed, and you feel that if you make one mistake, you
could die.''
   Tejas, a stocky 35-year-old with beard and shaved head, had
climbed McKinley 12 times, usually as a guide during the May-June
climbing season.
   Even then, in relatively milder conditions, about a third of
several hundred climbers who attempt the climb turn back short of
the summit.
   Snow-covered McKinley is infamous for hurricane-force winds that
rage for days, temperatures that dip to minus 60, and whiteouts
that make it hard to know up from down. Tejas' planned two-week
trek took a month.
   Tejas, who lives in Talkeetna, which is used as a staging area
for McKinley climbers, was dropped off Feb. 16 at the mountain's
7,200-foot level. On the second day, a storm came and kept him in
his snow cave for three days. He eventually went onto half rations,
then half rations every other day.
   ``I ended up working at my margin. It was around the edge of
safety several times.'' Twice, he found earlier climbers' food
caches that helped him survive. On March 7, he waited out a storm
and made a dash to the top during a whiteout.
   ``I couldn't see where I was going. After 12 times to the
summit, I can feel my way up to it, but it wasn't as pretty or
spectacular as I'd hoped for,'' he said.
   ``I took a few pictures, left a few mementos, turned around and
headed down. I left a Japanese flag in memory of Naomi Uemura, and
I also left a can of Spam. There was no meat in it. I ate it. I was
very hungry.''
   He made it back the same day to 17,000 feet and rested
overnight. The next day, he contacted pilot Lowell Thomas Jr. by
two-way radio and started down. Tejas appeared in good shape when
he arrived Tuesday in Anchorage, but he said the mountain had
pushed him to his mental, physical, and emotional limits.
   ``You go, `This is ridiculous. This is a hill, this is the
middle of winter, I'm a lone guy out here. There are crevasses all
around, there's danger. What am I doing here?' ''
   Safe on level ground, he answered his own question.
   ``To live in a very harsh environment, to do something very
stressful and straining like that, is a challenge,'' he said. ``I
was at the limits of my ability. It was a good test. I'd never
spent a month by myself. I found out I really liked myself.''

GRAND OPENING OF ISLIP RIDGE TRAIL
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Completion of a new trail is always a cause to celebrate. And that's just what
the San Gabriel Mountains Trail Builders intend to do next Saturday at the
grand opening of the group's Islip Ridge Trail.
</P>
<P>
The trail provides a new route from the Crystal Lake Recreation Area in Angeles
National Forest to the top of Mt. Islip. The Trail Builders, a volunteer group
under the leadership of Charles Jones, worked thousands of hours to blaze, then
build, the pathway.
</P>
<P>
Trail connoisseurs will appreciate the look -- and feel -- of a hand-built
trail. The moderate grade, well-engineered switchbacks, rock work and the way
the path gently crosses the land are due to the skill and hard work of many
dedicated volunteers.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Islip (pronounced eye-slip) is not named, as you might guess, for a clumsy
mountaineer, but for Canadian George Islip, who homesteaded in San Gabriel
Canyon a century ago.
</P>
<P>
The mountain is not one of the tallest San Gabriel Mountain peaks, but its
relatively isolated position on the spine of the range makes it stand out. The
summit offers the hiker fine views of the middle portion of the Angeles
National Forest high country and the metropolis.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Islip has long been a popular destination for hikers. The mountain was
particularly popular with Occidental College students, who, in 1909, built a
huge cairn (heap of boulders) dubbed the Occidental Monument atop the summit.
</P>
<P>
The monument, which had the name Occidental on top, stood for about two decades
until the Forest Service cleared the summit of Mt. Islip to make room for a
fire lookout tower. Today, the monument and fire lookout are long gone, but the
stone foundation of the fire lookout's living quarters still remains.
</P>
<P>
The new trail to Mt. Islip climbs the forested shoulder of the mountain, and
intersects a summit trail that leads to the peak.
</P>
<P>
Directions to trailhead: From the Foothill Freeway (210) in Azusa, take the
Highway 39/Azusa Avenue exit. Drive north on Highway 39 for 24 miles to the
turnoff for the Crystal Lake Recreation Area. After a mile you'll reach the
Forest Service entry station ($3 per vehicle).
</P>
<P>
Continue another mile to the Crystal Lake Visitor Center, which is open on
weekends from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., then a half-mile to a large dirt parking lot
on your right and signed Windy Gap Trail on your left.
</P>
<P>
(Next Saturday morning only, you'll be able to continue past the parking area
another mile to Deer Flat Campground, where the trail dedication ceremony takes
place.)
</P>
<P>
The hike: Ascend moderately on Windy Gap Trail, which passes near a campground
and heads into the cool of the forest. The trail crosses a Forest Service road
leading to Deer Flat Campground, ascends some more and reaches the dirt South
Mount Hawkins Truck Road. Cross the road and look left for the beginning of
Islip Ridge Trail, which some of the Trail Builders like to call the Big
Cienega Cut-off because it passes near Big Cienega Spring.
</P>
<P>
Enjoy the pleasant trail as it ascends moderately, more or less west, through
pine, spruce and cedar forest. A bit more than a mile from the top, Islip Ridge
Trail turns sharply north into a more sparse alpine forest.
</P>
<P>
The trail intersects the path coming from Windy Gap. Turn left and walk a short
but steep distance to the top of 8,250-foot Mt. Islip.
</P>
<P>
Dedication ceremonies for the new Islip Ridge Trail will be held next Saturday
at Deer Flat Group Campground in the Crystal Lake Recreation Area. Breakfast
will be provided by REI outdoor gear and clothing store of San Dimas and the
Big Santa Anita Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
Breakfast will be from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., dedication ceremonies from 9:45
to 10:15, with a 10:30 hike along Islip Ridge Trail to Mt. Islip. For breakfast
reservations, call REI at (714) 592-2095.
</P>
<P>
Windy Gap, Islip Ridge Trails

<HEAD>Amusement Parks Wage Battle of Primal Screams With Scary Roller
Coasters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's the battle of the monster roller
coasters, white-knucklers designed to scare you silly, and it's
just in time for youngsters on spring vacation to buy a thrill.
   But at $17-plus, these thrills aren't cheap.
   Thirty miles from downtown Los Angeles, in opposite directions,
the Knott's Berry Farm and Six Flags Magic Mountain amusement parks
are fighting to outdo each other by unleashing multimillion-dollar
fright machines.
   Knott's, to the southeast in Buena Park, promises its new $5
million Boomerang coaster will elicit ``the primal scream.'' Magic
Mountain at Valencia, to the northwest, says its $8 million Viper
coaster provides ``the most frightening ride on earth.''
   They are the latest in the nation's decade-long competition to
see who can build the biggest, fastest and scariest amusement park
attraction.
   The battle sometimes ends up in court. In Allentown, Pa., the
Dorney Park amusement park recently filed a lawsuit in federal
court to stop Six Flags Over Texas from claiming it has the
nation's tallest wooden roller coaster.
   Advertisements claim the $5.5 million Texas Giant coaster is the
highest at 143 feet, compared with 95 feet for Dorney's Hercules
coaster. But Dorney Park insists Hercules is 157 feet, because it
drops over a cliff, and the Texas Giant 137 feet.
   ``Coaster enthusiasts go all over the country looking for
moments of negative gravity,'' said Paul Ruben, editor of Roller
Coaster! magazine. He planned to be on hand today when Viper opens
to the public.
   ``Viper is a megacoaster that precisely defines the next step in
roller coaster evolution. Viper is, quite simply, the ultimate
scream machine,'' said Magic Mountain president Joseph Schillaci.
   Viper sends cars racing 70 mph over a course that reaches 188
feet high and includes seven loops during a 2{-minute run.
   Padded over-the-shoulder locking harnesses keep passengers
inside and ``fail-safe air brakes'' on the track are computer
controlled to assure proper ride speed.
   Asked about the safety of Boomerang, which also has padded
shoulder harnesses, Knott's spokesman Stuart Zanville said
structural experts employed by the amusement parks examine thrill
rides daily. There are no checks by government agencies, although
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration does inspect
carnival rides.
   ``We've never had a ride-related fatality. Every ride is
inspected every single day by our safety inspectors,'' Zanville
said.
   Magic Mountain markets the Viper as the world's tallest looping
roller coaster. The nation's tallest roller coaster is the
205-foot-high Magnum XL 200 at the Cedar Point amusement park in
Sandusky, Ohio, but it doesn't loop.
   But the president of the 2,000-member American Coaster
Enthusiasts group says pacing, steepness and the severity of turns
are more important factors than size.
   ``You could have a ride 50 feet tall and it could scare the
beejeebees out of you,'' said Randy Geisler, the Chicago-based
association's leader.
   Knott's Berry Farm understandably agrees with Geisler _
Boomerang pales in size compared to Viper.
   Boomerang cars make the outbound and return trips on the same
875-foot-long track. Riders are first pulled backward to the top of
a 125-foot tower, then released to hurtle through three vertical
loops before ascending another tower for the ride back. It lasts 90
seconds.
   ``During the ride, you have the sensation that you actually have
fallen off the track. With ours, it's not the height or the speed,
it's how you feel when you get off,'' said Zanville.
   There are similar rides at Six Flags Over Texas near Dallas and
Canada's Wonderland theme park in Toronto.
   Roller coaster popularity peaked in the 1920s with more than
1,500 in operation in the United States. By 1978, only 147 were
left in North America.
   But there will be 203 coasters in operation by the end of this
year, with 17 new, moved or renovated ones opening.

THESE HIGHPOINTERS HAVE 50 GOALS

<P>
Things are looking up for Doug Heroux and Bill Conroy. Again. They are
collectors, of a sort. Hobbyists with high ideals -- 50 of them.
</P>
<P>
The upwardly mobile duo have set their sights on reaching the highest point in
each of the 50 states, from Alaska's lordly Mount McKinley (20,320 feet) to
Florida's lowly Britton Hill (345 feet).
</P>
<P>
So far, the two have already bagged peaks in 26 states. More than three years
into their quest, the team is lagging a bit behind the initial goal of knocking
off 10 peaks annually for five years. They are too late to be among the first
10 climbers to complete the lofty pursuit, as they had hoped, but they should
have no trouble being part of the first 100.
</P>
<P>
Heroux, of Waterbury, Conn., and Conroy, from Naugatuck, Conn., aren't alone in
their quest; others are on the way up. Highpointers, a national club, was
recently formed (Heroux and Conroy are members), and now guidebooks and
organized group ascents are available to all.
</P>
<P>
The team's fascination for peak experiences grew out of a passion for hiking
and climbing in New Hampshire's White Mountains, still their favorite spot for
training. Their idea of a good time is a midwinter climb up Mount Washington.
There, on the Nelson Craig trail just a few weeks ago, Heroux was tromping
through waist-deep snow and Conroy was blown 40 feet by a gust of wind. That
was fun. And they actually liked waking up in a hoarfrost-coated tent, their
drinking water transformed into a chunk of ice.
</P>
<P>
Connecticut's highest point is on a shoulder of Mount Frissell, a mountain
whose peak rises in Massachusetts. It is a hill they know well.
</P>
<P>
"It's our practice mountain," Heroux said. "We've done it in winter, in summer,
in the rain, in the mud, in the dark."
</P>
<P>
Frissell is basically a walk-up, and for Heroux and Conroy, a breeze.
</P>
<P>
Other summits are even easier; some require no climbing at all. The two sloshed
across cornfields in a Winnebago all the way to the roof of Nebraska. At least
half the nation's high points are within equally easy reach.
</P>
<P>
But even easily climbed mountains may harbor unexpected challenges. An angry
bull gave chase while the two were high-pointing in North Dakota. To reach
their goal, Heroux and Conroy had to figure out how to get around the
cantankerous beast.
</P>
<P>
And more malevolent obstacles may await. Some high points are on private
property where trespassers -- even those who ask permission -- aren't welcome.
"I heard shotguns are involved in some of the high points," Heroux said.
</P>
<P>
A few top spots are demanding, though, and four are very difficult:
Washington's Mount Rainier, Wyoming's Gannett Peak, Alaska's Mount McKinley and
Montana's Granite Peak. These require advanced climbing skills.
</P>
<P>
McKinley is so daunting that when Conroy first thought of topping out in 50
states, he listed the high points and then nixed the idea. No way could he
climb to the summit of North America's highest mountain. People die there.
</P>
<P>
About 15 years later, he teamed up with Heroux. The two decided to dust off the
list of high points and hit the trail.
</P>
<P>
At Mount Frissell a few weeks ago, Heroux and Conroy are preparing for their
climb beneath a threatening pewter-gray sky. They will curl around Bear
Mountain, cut across the stony dome of Round Mountain, plunge into a valley and
chug up the steep rocky brow of Frissell. In all, a hike of 8 to 10 miles.
</P>
<P>
Heading out of a trail-head parking lot, Heroux, a stringbean of a guy,
shoulders a 35-pound backpack stuffed with essentials: a few plastic jars of
premixed Tang, a couple of candy bars, a few pieces of triple fudge cake and
plenty of pricey outdoor gear. "Just in case there's a white-out, I'll have
everything we could need," he says. Mostly though, the heavy pack is carried
for exercise.
</P>
<P>
Conroy, a Kenny Loggins lookalike, carries nothing. The 40-year-old gets his
exercise in more perverse ways -- donning a 60-pound backpack, for example, and
boarding a treadmill set at maximum incline for a one-hour workout. Or maybe
he'll run a few miles; he plans to compete in the New York marathon this fall.
</P>
<P>
The two plod toward Frissell with the measured pace of those accustomed to
walking great distances: sure and steady. They don't waste breath talking. The
clank of caribiners (metal rings that fasten ropes to the metal spikes used in
climbing) dangling from Heroux's pack fills the silence -- that, and the squeak
of his Day-Glo green hiking boots.
</P>
<P>
Their path threads thickets of shoulder-high mountain laurel, fords creeks, and
meanders through forests thick with mixed hardwoods. Hiking has little appeal,
says Conroy. What drives them onward is the challenge of reaching a peak.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the two practice climbing techniques while dangling like spiders from
ropes in the rafters of a warehouse Conroy uses for his moving business.
Heroux, 32, is a self-employed plumber. "We needed time to hike," Heroux
explains. "So we both started our own business."
</P>
<P>
They also needed time to get in shape. Conditioning is the key to reaching the
top of the tough summits.
</P>
<P>
Take Mount McKinley. There, climbers fly into a base camp on the Kahiltna
Glacier, rope together, then stagger upward through oxygen-thin air, ever wary
of yawning crevasses. With each climber lugging more than 100 pounds of gear,
reaching the summit often takes two or more weeks. During their attempt last
May, Heroux and Conroy said they felt lost in the gaping vastness, dwarfed by
the mountain's gargantuan scale.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, altitude sickness forced Conroy to turn back at 11,000 feet. "My
lungs filled with fluid," he said. "I could hear them gurgling. That worried me
a little."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Heroux and a group of other climbers and guides pressed on to 17,000
feet -- eight hours from the summit -- only to be hammered by a storm and
nailed down for days. "We were holding on for dear life," he said.
</P>
<P>
The storm-enforced idleness depleted their food supplies, so the summit
remained elusive for Heroux, too. They plan to try again.
</P>
<P>
Another tough climb, one the duo did notch, was Washington's Mount Rainier.
</P>
<P>
It was on their first visit to the mountain, a tourist trip to a place called
Paradise, that the men hatched their 50-state scheme. Awed by Rainier's beauty,
they decided to return the next year, take lessons and make the climb. They
figured if they could reach Rainier's summit, they could hit the other 49 high
points. A year later, they came, they saw and they conquered.
</P>
<P>
Not everyone understands their high-minded obsession. "When you tell people you
drove all the way to Delaware to stand in the middle of the street (where that
state's high point is located), they think you're pretty strange," said Heroux.
</P>
<P>
But in a sense, the high point quest is just an excuse to travel. "That's the
key to this whole thing -- to see the country," said Heroux. "I don't want to
travel to England or something, there's so much to see in the U.S." Each trip
has been duly recorded -- complete with maps and photos -- in a series of
leather-bound scrapbooks kept by Heroux. After nabbing all 50 high points, he
wants to hit every national park in the country.
</P>
<P>
Until their next major mountain assault, the two are content in dreaming up
variations on a theme, new ways to reconquer nearby peaks. Lately they've
plotted a way to bag the high point in each of seven states within a single
24-hour span. They'll start at the top of Backbone Mountain (3,360 feet) in
Maryland, then race to Delaware and on to New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Connecticut
and Massachusetts. The climax would be Rhode Island's Jerimoth Hill: "You
arrive at the top of a hill, park the car, see if the dog's chained, walk into
a guy's backyard and stand on a rock." Heroux said. "You've done Rhode Island."

FT  13 MAR 93 / Everest: the ultimate high - Rebecca Stephens sets off in
the steps of Everest's first climbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REBECCA STEPHENS

<TEXT>
LORD HUNT, the veteran mountaineer, looked at me gently. 'Everest was not my
favourite mountain,' he said 'And I doubt, my dear, it will be yours.'
Only three years ago at mount Everest's base camp, I met four French women
who I thought were, quite simply, mad for wanting to reach the 29,028ft
peak. Surely women had more sense. Women wanted to create life and preserve
it, not throw it away for a mountain, I thought. But this week I am on my
way to Everest to face the same dangers as they did in an attempt on the
summit.
Our expedition is intended to mark the 40th anniversary of the first ascent
of Everest by the British expedition led by Colonel John Hunt. It has been
endorsed by Sir Edmund Hilary, who, with Sherpa Tensing, was the first to
reach that majestic peak on 29 May 1953. Our team - the DHL British 40th
Anniversary Everest Expedition - will climb by the same route they took, by
the Western Cwm and South Col.
We aim to raise Pounds 1m for Sir Edmund's Himalayan Trust, a charity which
helps build schools and hospitals for the Sherpa people, and conserve their
The expedition will cost some Pounds 250,000. Sponsors include DHL, New
York-based investment banking group The Carter Organization, Sally Ferries,
Glenmorangie, Foundation for Sport and the Arts and, clothing us head to
toe, Karrimor. After two years of preparation we set off this week from
Kathmandu to trek through the foothills to Everest base camp. In April we
shall set up camps high on the mountain aiming to climb, weather allowing,
in May.
The expedition, the idea of merchant banker Peter Earl and led by John
Barry, a mountaineer of some repute, is nine climbers strong. It includes
names such as Bill Barker, Harry Taylor, both Everest veterans, Dave Walsh,
Dave Halton, John Rowe and Dr Sandy Scott.
I am going as an amateur. In the autumn of 1989 I was at Everest Base Camp
reporting for the Financial Times on an Anglo-American attempt on the North
East Ridge. I did not climb; had never climbed. But since then I have become
quietly obsessed, abandoning holidays on the beach for the hillier parts of
Africa, Europe - climbing Mount Kenya, Kilimanjaro and Mont Blanc - and most
recently Alaska, where the Everest gang climbed north America's highest, and
coldest peak, Mount McKinley. The addiction takes a hold, like any drug.
And now I want to be the first British woman to reach the top of Everest.
What is it about the mountain that still draws climbers four decades after
the first ascent?
'Everest became rather more than a mountain,' Hunt says. 'It is so easy to
idealise our expedition, but there was enormous pressure to be the first
expedition - and a British one at that - to climb the mountain. All the more
so because following the war we were preceded (on the mountain) by the Swiss
and to be followed by the French.'
Hunt, and he suggests most of the 1953 team, agreed with the words of Eric
Shipton - who until six months earlier had been leader of the expedition -
when, on hearing of their success, said: 'Thank Goodness, now we can get on
with some real climbing.'
In the last 40 years 469 men and 16 women have stood on the summit of
Everest; 117 have died in attempts to do so. Man has climbed it solo,
without oxygen, and in May of last year 32 people queued to stand on the
summit on a single day.
Is the climb easier? Has Everest shrunk? Or is it that modern equipment  -
Gore-tex, quick-wicking fabrics which allow perspiration to escape, plastic
boots, light-weight oxygen cylinders - and an advancement in the
understanding of high altitude physiology has enabled climbers to overcome
the effects of the drastic reduction in ambient oxygen levels and the
associated susceptibility to the cold?
'It's easy to overplay the difference in equipment. I think we were well
equipped,' said Hunt; though undoubtedly the net weight of clothing and
oxygen then was considerably higher than it is today.
'Stoves were important,' he said; a comment that reveals quite how
experimental such things were in the 1950s. The Swiss failed in 1952 because
their stoves failed. The Brits knew this, and made sure that their stoves
could melt enough snow to enable each climber to drink at least seven pints
of liquid a day. It was revolutionary knowledge then, that it might be
essential to consume large quantities of liquid at high altitude; today it
is part of traditional mountaineering wisdom.
The biggest difficulty to overcome on that first ascent was, said Hunt, 'the
psychological problem.'
To enter the Western Cwm climbers must first clamber up the Khumbu Icefall:
2,000ft of gaping crevasses and shifting monoliths of ice, that collapse and
tumble with a whim.
'Terrifying,' said Lincolne Rowe, an artist accompanying us on the
expedition, who twice has been high on Everest. 'I can say so; I'm an
artist.'
In Hunt's day it had been passed only twice: 'It was a real hazard to be
reckoned with.'
A greater problem still was the last 1,000ft or so to the summit: 'There was
that uncertainty about man's ability to do it. The Sherpas suffered
especially from those doubts, and their superstitions that they should incur
the wrath of the gods for venturing above the South Col.'
It was a sacred summit: 'The monks at Thyangboche Monastery (in the
foothills) quite clearly didn't want us to get to the top,' said Hunt.
On the climbers' return the monks congratulated them - for 'nearly reaching
the summit.'
How different today: Ang Phurbar, the head Sherpa on our expedition, has
reached the summit twice. The barrier of doubt is down.
Might a woman have been invited to climb Everest in 1953?
'Inconceivable,' said Hunt. 'Had there been a girl she would have been one
of us - that would be natural, normal,' he reflected. But there were very
few male climbers then, and especially few women climbers.
When the Duke of Edinburgh Scheme - of which Lord Hunt was a founding
director - opened its doors to girls in 1958, it was considered their
preferred pursuits might be make-up and hair-style, dress design and flower
arranging, not motorcycle maintenance or potholing. This spring, eight young
people from the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme - boys and girls - are
accompanying us to Base Camp Everest, each one climbing Island Peak
(20,380ft) en route.
In 1953, Hunt's expedition had Everest to themselves. This spring there will
be some 20 expeditions on the south side of the mountain alone. But as Hunt
chose to entitle his loosely autobiographical book, Life is Meeting. He, and
Ed Hillary, George Lowe, George Band and Michael Westmacott will be
rekindling their 40 year friendship at a 1953 Everest reunion in Khumbu this
spring. With luck, we will meet them; and the old Everest hands will be able
to throw a tips to nine modern-day aspirants, as they trek by.

   The son of the man who first climbed
Mount Everest reached the peak of the world's highest mountain
today, following an American team and members of a three-nation
peace climb to the crowded summit.
   Peter Hillary, son of mountaineer Edmund Hillary, reached the
top of the 29,029-foot peak 37 years after his father and sherpa
guide Tenzing Norgay pioneered the way. It was his fourth attempt.
   Hillary, 36, followed the traditional southeastern route first
used by his father. He reached the top at 7:30 a.m. with the two
leaders of an eight-member New Zealand team, their base camp
reported by radio. The message said the trio was accompanied by a
Nepalese sherpa guide, Apa Sherpa, 33.
   ``It's been a bit of a struggle over the years, but we're
thrilled to bits that you're finally standing on top of the old
mountain,'' Sir Edmund told Peter by satellite telephone from
Auckland.
   Hillary said it had been a long, hard morning and he was feeling
``absolutely over the moon'' at reaching the summit.
   ``It's very, very cold up here. I've been having difficulty
keeping some of my extremities, my hands warm so I'm going to be
heading down as soon as I can,'' he said.
   The team aimed to return to the South Col camp, about 3,000 feet
from the summit on the south side of the mountain.
   Most of the climbers were using oxygen.
   Sir Edmund was made a knight of the British Empire for his
exploit four decades ago. He has retained a long association with
Nepal and has led aid projects there, building schools and
hospitals to improve the lives of the Sherpa people.
   His wife and daughter were killed in a plane crash in Nepal in
1975.
   Since Sir Edmund reached the summit of Mount Everest, many
climbers have followed in his footsteps. Their expeditions have
left behind an estimated two tons of trash, including empty oxygen
bottles and cans. The summit, which can handle only about 20
climbers at a time, is sometimes nearly crowded.
   Minutes before the younger Hillary completed his feat today,
five Americans _ three lawyers, a geologist and a mountain guide _
reached the peak, the Nepalese Tourism Ministry said.
   The five Americans were members of an 11-member team that also
followed the traditional southeastern route.
   The American climbers are Peter George Alhams, a 32-year-old
mountain guide from Snow Bird, Utah; Dana Quentin Coffield, a
31-year-old geologist from Columbia, S.C.; and lawyers Glenn
Porzak, 41, of Boulder, Colo.; Michael Browning, 37, of Manitou
Springs, Colo.; and Brent Manning, 39, of Salt Lake City. They were
accompanied by two Nepalese Sherpa guides, the ministry said.
   Meanwhile, a Belgian Everest expedition abandoned its attempt on
the same route Thursday after the regulator of an oxygen cylinder
burst, the ministry said.
   On April 24, five members of a Nepalese army expedition climbed
Everest.
   And three days ago, climbers from a three-nation team _ the
United States, China and the Soviet Union _ scaled Everest from its
northern side through Tibet. Six climbers in the fourth and last
group from the expedition reached the summit today, China's
official news agency reported. Included in the group was American
Mark Scott Tucker. There was no hometown listed for Tucker.
   The climbers have been filling duffle bags with garbage left by
previous expeditions and taking it back down the mountain.
   Expeditions from Switzerland and Australia are still on the
mountain, waiting in line for a chance to reach the top.

<HEAD>Climbing Deaths Underscore Danger of Mount Rainier</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASHFORD, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of three mountain climbers in an
avalanche on Mount Rainier will probably attract even more
thrillseekers to a peak that looks lovely but sometimes acts like a
``devil that shows pity on noone,'' National Park officials say.
   ``News like this tends to bring more people to the mountain,''
said Bill Jensen, the park's chief ranger. ``It's a very dangerous,
hazardous route and that's what attracts people _ the thrill of
danger.''
   The bodies of Craig Loyal Adkison, 37, of Kirkland; David
Kellokoski, 30, of Tahoe-Paradise, Calif., and Greg Remmick, 32, of
Citrus Heights, Calif., were recovered by helicopter Friday from
the 14,410-foot mountain.
   They had been scheduled to finish their climb of the treacherous
Liberty Ridge route up the mountain's north face on May 14. The
search began for the three Tuesday, and their bodies were spotted
from the air Thursday.
   The deaths brought to 54 the number of climbers who have died on
the dormant volcano since 1898, and another 24 have perished on
lesser peaks and slopes nearby, said Cy Hentges, a spokesman for
Mount Rainier National Park.
   Officials at Mount Rainier National Park stressed the mountain's
perilous, unpredictable nature and worried that the latest deaths
would attract thrill-seeking climbers to it.
   ``Let's realize that the American Everest team trained on it,''
Hentges said. ``That should tell you something. It's on a miniature
scale, but it provides anything and everything that Everest does,
except it's not that high.
   ``You can walk up sometimes, roped, with proper equipment but in
shorts, but all it takes is one storm to come in _ and this has
happened many times _ to kill people within half an hour of a road
system. It has killed children on what seems like a gentle slope.
It's something that can become very angry.
   ``It looks so lovely and so beautiful, and yet it can be a devil
that shows pity on no one.''
   Hentges said bad weather and unstable fresh snow probably caused
the three to fall 2,000 feet to their deaths in an avalanche. Their
bodies were recovered from an avalanche chute at the 10,000-foot
level by a helicopter equipped with a grappling hook that snagged
the rope connecting them and carried them to a safer spot.
   About 8,000 people attempt Mount Rainier each year, most of them
up the less steep and glaciated south side, and about half make it.
   To brave the Liberty Ridge route, climbers must be very strong
and well-prepared for bad weather, Hentges said.
   Everest veteran Lou Whittaker, who has run the only guide
service on the peak for decades and that on the southerly route,
made six attempts on Liberty Ridge before making it to the summit,
Hentges said.
   ``If weather's coming in, you have to say it's not safe and turn
around,'' he said.
   ``There is a point of no return,'' Hentges added, ``when you
must continue to the top, and if you hit bad weather, you can get
in real trouble.''

   Thick, pasty lava once oozed onto the
surface of Venus to form 15-mile-wide domes that look like giant
pancakes or coconut macaroons in the Magellan spacecraft's newest
pictures.
   Heat measurements made by the spacecraft show fool's gold or
other iron-rich metallic minerals coat the slopes of the planet's
tallest peak, 7-mile-high Mount Maxwell.
   Scientists released new radar pictures Friday during a news
conference at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Engineers were relieved they were able to regain contact with
the spacecraft after a 40-minute blackout Thursday. It was the
third such communications failure in three months. Project manager
Tony Spear said it could happen again, but called Magellan's health
``very good.''
   Some pictures show 600-mile-long, 300-mile-wide horseshoe-shaped
features, each surrounding a meteorite impact crater 10 miles to 15
miles wide.
   The horseshoes may have been formed by shock waves triggered by
incoming meteorites or by windblown debris that settled to the
ground after being kicked up by the impacts, said geologist Ray
Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis.
   They are ``unique in the solar system,'' he said.
   The space agency also displayed a computer-processed videotape
that shows Venus' surface from the perspective of someone swooping
over 130-mile-wide, half-mile-deep volcanic collapse craters and
38,000-foot-tall Mount Maxwell, the planet's tallest mountain.
   One of the new pictures shows seven lava domes, similar but much
larger than the lava dome inside the crater of Mount St. Helens in
Washington state, said Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist.
   ``They look like coconut macaroons. They look like pancakes,''
he said. ``They're about 2,500 feet high and 15 miles across.''
   Magellan's heat measurements show some of the middle slopes of
Mount Maxwell contain ``mystery material'' that emits little heat,
said Gordon Pettengill of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   That means the slopes are coated with soil containing metallic
material, either iron pyrite - called fool's gold because it looks
like gold - or iron minerals called hematite and magnetite,
Pettengill said.
   Radar pictures show numerous mountain ridges and valleys created
by squeezing of Venus' hot, thin crust, said Sean Solomon of MIT.
In places, the mountains are no longer being squeezed upward, and
are collapsing down onto lowland plains, he added.
   Magellan was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989, arrived at Venus on Aug. 10 and formally started mapping the
planet Sept. 15.
   Magellan has used radar to peer through clouds and map 18
percent of Venus' landscape, comparable to an area on Earth
stretching from Los Angeles to Reykjavik, Iceland, and covering
most of North and South America.
   Thursday's loss of contact with Magellan halted mapping for most
of the day. Engineers still don't know the exact cause but suspect
excess static sometimes disrupts one of Magellan's computers, Spear
said.
   Those malfunctions and other problems will add about $3 million
to $5 million to the $744 million cost of Magellan's mission, Spear
said.

<HEAD>Assault on World's Tallest Peak Has New Aims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATIA BLACKBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first American to scale Mount Everest is
planning another assault 26 years later, this time with a trash bag
on his back and Soviet and Chinese colleagues at his side.
   Jim Whittaker is leading the three-nation ``Peace Climb'' to
celebrate world peace and mark the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.
The 30-person expedition will clean decades of discarded oxygen
bottles and other debris left by previous climbers, he said.
   If all goes as planned, one climber from the United States,
China and the Soviet Union will set foot on the 29,028-foot peak on
April 22.
   Gaining the participation of climbing teams from the Soviet
Union and China, which only recently eased relations after decades
of mutual hostility, took a little shuttle diplomacy, Whittaker
said.
   When he approached the Chinese in 1987, they told him they were
interested but would only invite the Soviets if they knew in
advance the Soviets would say yes. ``They didn't want to lose
face,'' Whittaker said.
   In Moscow, he said, the Soviets told him they would participate
only if they knew for sure they were invited.
   ``They thought the Chinese may be trying to embarrass them,'' he
said.
   So he returned to China, where he finally was told, ``Mr.
Whittaker, you may bring your Soviet friends to our mountain.''
   ``When you get enough people behind a movement _ the environment
and peace _ leaders will get smart and get in front or be
toppled,'' Whittaker said.
   Whittaker said the team members will plant their national flags
and bounce signals off a U.S. space satellite to broadcast live
television footage of the event. Each will speak to their nation's
leader by telephone.
   The idea for the Peace Climb was hatched during a 1981 ascent of
the 14,411-foot Mount Rainier during which Whittaker and two
friends guided several disabled climbers to the summit.
   They wondered what else they could do to make the world a better
place to live, to show that people from entirely different worlds
can work together toward a common goal.
   On the day of the climb, children from several American schools
will climb nearby hills and pick up garbage as they go, Whittaker
said.
   On the Peace Climb, dozens of climbers hauling gear and food
from lower camps to higher camps to support the summit assault will
stop on their way down to fill empty duffels with trash left behind
by climbers over the past seven decades.
   An estimated two tons of discarded tents, empty oxygen bottles,
tin cans and other garbage littering the flanks of Everest will be
buried in a landfill near the base camp at 17,100 feet, team
members said.
   Whittaker, who scaled Everest in 1963 and led the first American
ascent of K-2 in 1978, doesn't plan to try for the summit himself,
preferring to leave that bid to younger and stronger climbers.
   ``An essential ingredient to this is that if one climber
falters, climbers from all three countries will turn back,'' said
Warren Thompson, the expedition's deputy leader. ``It's important
that what we accomplish is accomplished together.''

<HEAD>In Nepal, a Mountain of Paperwork Comes Before the Mountain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is the very picture of adventure, the
climber planting a flag in triumph atop an icy Himalayan peak. What
isn't generally known, however, is that a mountain of paperwork has
to be scaled first.
   Mountain climbing in Nepal, for all its risk and romance, also
means conquering an array of permits, payments, insurance forms,
and wills for Sherpa guides. And then comes patience, for it can
take years to get it all done.
   Anyone who wants to climb the famed Mount Everest, for example,
may have to wait six or seven years to get a Nepalese government
permit because the world's highest peak also is Nepal's most
desired challenge. Then there are the expenses and 58 pages of
rules set down by Nepal's government.
   ``Probably 80 percent of the effort is getting to the bottom of
the mountain (to start the climb),'' says Steve Langley, a Canadian
leading a six-week expedition up 22,479-foot Mount Ama Dablam, 10
miles southwest of Everest.
   Langley, a 40-year-old computer consultant from Calgary,
Alberta, first applied to climb the mountain in 1982.
   ``We arrived here without the permit,'' he said. ``It was
finally granted officially three weeks ago.''
   Murari P. Khatiwada of Nepal's Mountaineering Division says the
long wait is due to the growing number of people who want to ascend
122 of the 1,310 peaks Nepal grants permits for.
   ``Ten years ago we had 20 expeditions throughout the year. Now
we have more than 100,'' said Khatiwada.
   He explained that amounted to 800 to 1,000 climbers, not
including the guides and porters, usually from the nimble Sherpa
tribe, who accompany foreign mountaineers.
   For this reason, Khatiwada said, nearly all Nepal's mountains
are booked through 1990 and applications for some peaks are being
accepted for the year 2000.
   He said it was vital to limit the number of climbers to protect
Nepal's environment.
   ``A mountain is fragile,'' he explained. ``It cannot bear the
burden of too many people.''
   Just as frustrating as the wait for climbers are the government
regulations, which get down to such details as how many socks,
shoes and umbrellas must be supplied to guides and porters. They
also list fees for the peaks. All that is just the beginning of an
expedition's expenses.
   The permit to climb Everest's 29,028 feet costs $2,547. For any
other peak above 26,400 feet, the fee is $2,038. For Mount Ama
Dablam, it costs $1,528.
   Langley's team of himself, four other Canadians and an American
has budgeted $24,000 for the climb, and he said ``we're doing it on
the cheap.''
   All his people are experienced and already have most of the
needed equipment. The American climber, Tom Dickey, 31, of Boulder,
Colo., has worked as a trekking guide in Nepal.
   But the team is taking along a liaison officer, required by the
government but paid by the expedition; a chief Sherpa; an
assistant, and 12 porters. Salaries for all are specified in the
government rules, along with the equipment to be provided them.
   Langley said the actual gear is rarely given the Sherpas, most
of whom have equipment from earlier climbs, and a cash payment is
usually negotiated in lieu of equipment.
   ``The daily salary, in the scheme of things, is peanuts,'' said
Langley.
   He said the pay to the government liaison officer, for example,
is $2 a day. His equipment allowance comes to the equivalent of
$800.
   Other expenses include $1,000 for an agency to help ease the way
through the Nepalese bureaucracy, $350 for required insurance for
climbers and Sherpas, and the cost of getting climbers and their
equipment to Nepal.
   Each man on Langley's team is putting up $4,000 to make the
climb, although expeditions often seek funds from mountaineering
societies, philanthropists or companies wanting publicity for their
products.
   Peter Hill, an Englishman also leading an expedition up Ama
Dablam, said he wrote 400 letters seeking backing without success.
   ``To get money these days for a peak, it's got to be unclimbed
or it's got to be Everest,'' he complained.
   But Hill, 26, ran into a stroke of luck. His father happened
upon a newspaper ad for a bank, Perpetual Unit Trust, picturing its
symbol _ the peak of Ama Dablam.
   Dickey, the Colorado climber, noted that mountaineers can avoid
all the preliminary trouble by climbing Europe's Alps or the Andes
in South America, where no permits are needed.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``I'm in on an Everest expedition in
1990.''

<HEAD>Son Of Famed Sherpa Guide Will Join Climb Marking First Assault On
Everest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The son of one of first two men to conquer Mount
Everest has set his own sights on the mighty mountain, joining a
team that hopes to scale the world's highest peak to mark the 35th
anniversary of the feat.
   Tenzing Norbu, a Connecticut travel agent and the son of Tenzing
Norgay, said he joined the expedition to honor his late father, the
Sherpa guide who joined New Zealander Edmund Hillary at the top of
the world in 1953.
   ``For me, it is a pilgrimage to a mountain which has reshaped
the lives of my family and my people,'' Tenzing, 25, said at a news
conference Wednesday.``It will allow me to pay homage to my late
father.''
   The young Tenzing, a University of New Hampshire graduate who
works for a travel agency in Westport, Conn., only will go as far
as the base camp, about 17,000 feet, on the Chinese Tibetan side of
the mountain that straddles the Nepal-China border.
   The final assault on the summit of the 29,028-feet peak, the
world's highest, will be made by an international team of
mountaineers led by Robert Anderson, 30, a Denver native now living
in Auckland, New Zealand.
   Anderson, joined by two other Americans and a British climber,
will attempt to reach the peak without oxygen by an untried route
along the eastern side of the mountain.
   Like the Nepalese Tenzing and Hillary in 1953, the ``Everest
'88'' expedition will be supported by the United Nations. Miklos
Pinther, chief cartographer of the U.N. Secretariat, will travel to
the base camp and the climbers will have a U.N. flag to plant on
the summit.
   The group leaves Beijing on Thursday for Lhasa, the capital of
Tibet. From there, they will begin a five-day journey accompanied
by 45 yaks to a site where they will set up their base camp.
   Anderson, who came within 800 feet of the summit in a 1985
expedition to Everest, said the team hopes to put a man at the peak
by the end of April.
   He said the climbers will forgo oxygen to relive some of the
challenge of the original assault, much of which has been
diminished by technological advances in climbing equipment. Tenzing
and Hillary used oxygen in their climb.
   The young Tenzing said he will give the summit assault team
objects similar to those his father took up the mountain, including
a wooden black cat, a broken pencil and candy to pay respect to the
mountain gods.
   Tenzing and Hillary reached the summit on May 29, 1953. Since
then, 209 people have conquered the mountain, but only about 15
without oxygen, according to Anderson.
   Tenzing Norgay, the ``tiger of the snows,'' died in May 1986 at
the age of 72 in Darjeeling, India, where he set up a climbing
school. Hillary, now Sir Edmund, is New Zealand's ambassador to
India. The two men kept their vow never to reveal which first set
foot on the majestic pinnacle.

<HEAD>Communist Guerrillas Capture Eight Mountain Climbers, Suspect Some
As Spies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist guerrillas said Saturday
they captured eight mountain climbers, including three foreigners,
on the country's tallest peak to check if any were military
informants.
   The Menardo Arce Command, a guerrilla unit of the Communist New
People's Army operating in southern Mindanao, said they also
detained the climbers also to protect them from rebel mines.
   But they said the three foreigners and the five Filipinos,
captured Tuesday, will be released soon because interrogation
showed they were not spies.
   More than 300 climbers were on 9,690-foot Mount Apo for a
mountaineering convention.
   ``The presence of foreigners in the area gave us reason to
suspect they were sent by the enemies in order to spy or study the
terrain ... all in the guise of mountain climbing,'' the command
said in a statement.
   The statement said the foreigners included Gerald Leo
Christopher Kennedy of Ireland, New Zealander Trevor James Anderson
and James Andrew Smart of Britain.
   The group apologized for the detention but said it was necessary
for the ``best interest'' of the mountain climbers.
   ``To protect it (the area) from enemy troops, we had earlier
installed various defense mechanisms, including booby traps and
land mines in several strategic points of the mountain trail,'' it
said.
   The rebel command said Mount Apo is part of rebel territory and
any person entering the area should first ask for their permission.
   Tuesday's incident was reported to the military only Friday,
said Maj. Antonio Inciong, regional chief of the military's civil
relations service.
   Among the detained Filipinos was the Rev. Vic Dimaranan, a Roman
Catholic priest, Inciong added.
   The climbers who trekked to the mountain were attending the
annual convention of the Philippine National Mountaineering
Federation, Inciong said.
   The state-run Philippine News Agency said the climbers were met
by some 100 guerrillas near Tudaya Falls on the outskirts of the
village of Baracatan.

<HEAD>Sleep Disruption Blamed For Mountain Climbers' Impaired Judgment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mountain climbers may suffer impaired
judgment because they don't sleep well, according to a study of six
people who simulated climbing Mount Everest by living 40 days in a
low-pressure chamber.
   ``People have known for a long time that sleep at high altitudes
is poor. We found sleep at high altitudes is so poor that little
restorative effect can be expected,'' Dr. James D. Anholm said in a
summary of his study.
   ``These new results call into question the long-held belief that
the dangers of high-altitude climbing are due primarily to the
dangers of terrain, weather and the lack of oxygen,'' Anholm said.
   Oxygen lack at night, instead of during the day's exertions,
probably is responsible for the severe sleep loss, said Anholm, an
assistant professor of medicine at Loma Linda University Medical
Center in California.
   Climbers who carry oxygen at high altitudes would probably
benefit more from using it while they sleep than while they are
awake, he said.
   Jim Whittaker, who in 1963 became the first American to reach
the summit of Everest, the world's tallest mountain at more than
29,000 feet, was skeptical of the study but said it may have merit.
   ``It could be lack of sleep causes people to make mistakes at
high altitudes, but I think it's more the lack of oxygen'' during
exertion, he said by telephone from Port Townsend, Wash. ``I feel
that's a bigger cause. You don't sleep a lot, but you sleep
enough.''
   Phil Ershler, who in 1984 became the first American to climb
Everest's north face, said he sleeps well on mountains, but ``I
don't think there's any question that there's some validity'' to
Anholm's conclusions.
   How well a climber sleeps and performs at high altitude ``is
very much an individual thing,'' Ershler said by phone from
Bellevue, Wash.
   Anholm, an internist, presented his study in May at the
Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology annual
meeting here.
   The six people in Anholm's study were among eight paid
volunteers who lived for 40 days in a large low-pressure chamber in
Natick, Mass., as part of a larger Army-funded study of the effects
of high altitude.
   Pressures in the chamber were regularly reduced to simulate a
climb of Everest, with stops at sea level, 15,000 feet, 20,000 feet
and 26,410 feet, about the level of the South Col camp.
   Anholm measured oxygen in the volunteers' blood and monitored
their sleep by measuring brain waves.
   He found blood oxygen levels were lowest at high altitude and
during sleep, and that as altitude increased, the volunteers slept
much less, awakened more often, felt more irritable in the morning,
and had far more frequent episodes of sleep apnea, intervals during
which breathing ceased for about 10 seconds.
   Even at the simulated 15,000-foot level, the volunteers rarely
slept more than 10 minutes before awakening. Most significantly,
the number of arousals _ two- or three-second awakenings that
weren't remembered, as opposed to full awakenings that last more
than 10 seconds _ rose from 20 per hour at sea level to 117 per
hour at 26,410 feet.
   ``For sleep to have a restorative effect, it needs to be
relatively undisturbed,'' Anholm said. ``These very brief arousals
disturb sleep enough that you perform as though you are partially
sleep deprived.''

   American and Soviet mountaineers who plan to climb
Mount Everest to promote peace and environmentalism met their
Chinese counterparts Wednesday, and tried to sidestep questions
about China's troubles.
   ``We don't know a lot about politics, but I think we all know a
little bit about mountain climbing,'' Jim Whittaker, leader of the
Mount Everest Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb, told a news
conference at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
   ``We come here for the peace of the world,'' Chinese delegation
leader Liu Da Yi said through an interpreter. ``We hope to have good
cooperation.''
   Chinese mountaineers in the 30-member climbing team were delayed
more than a week in reaching the United States for practice climbing
on Mount Rainier because of restrictions on travel in China
following the military crackdown there.
   The team, comprised of 10 citizens of each country, plans to head
for Mount Rainier on Saturday after planning sessions and a
fund-raising reception.
   Whittaker said the team will train at least through Tuesday at a
base camp and a high-level camp that have been established on the
14,410-foot peak 60 miles southeast of Seattle.
   The climb next year is intended to show that people from the
three nations can work together to reach the highest point on Earth,
said Whittaker, who in 1963 became the first American to stand atop
Everest. He said it's the first time mountaineers from the three
countries have joined in a major climb.
   ``We will stand on the summit of Everest, three people, one from
each country, with our arms around each other because we are
brothers, not only under one sun, but brothers as mountain
climbers,'' he said.
   The group will try to get as many climbers as possible to the
summit of the 29,028-foot Himalayan mountain, he added.
   The mountaineers hope to get the first team onto the peak on
April 22, the 20th anniversary of Earth Day, Whittaker said.
   The expedition plans to pack its own trash down the mountain and
bring out as much trash from previous climbs as possible. Greenpeace
and other environmental groups have volunteered to help remove
waste, Whittaker said.
   The climbers plan to approach the mountain's north side through
China and Tibet. The cost of the expedition was put at $1 million,
and Whittaker said additional sponsors were being sought.
   Pressed about the turmoil in China, Whittaker said he welcomed
the publicity it drew to the expedition.
   ``We'd like the events of the past few weeks to focus on this
group of citizens that are working together for a common goal of
peace, and the human environment,'' he said.
   ``I think there is even more reason for this group to be
together. We had no idea that those problems would occur.''
   But, Whittaker said, the expedition ``is even more important for
the citizens of this world ... When we rope up on that mountain we
are trusting our lives to each other. I think we have to do that as
countries.''
   The Chinese delegation leader said the Chinese recognize the
American and Soviet climbers are more experienced. ``We will be the
pupils.''
   Soviet leader Vladimir Shatayev said he was eager to get back to
mountain climbing. ``We're happy our Chinese friends have come to
climb,'' he said through an interpreter.

   The catastrophic eruption of Mount St.
Helens 10 years ago taught scientists and ordinary citizens lessons
that can save lives, geologists told a symposium near the volcano
today.
   ``It caught our attention and the world's attention, and we
learned a great deal,'' said Robert Christiansen, chief of volcano
hazards for the U.S. Geological Survey. ``It raises a lot of
awareness of volcanism.''
   Christiansen told a ``Ten Years Later'' symposium on the
anniversary of the blast that lessons from Mount St. Helens apply
to other volcanos, especially in the Cascade Mountains of the
northwestern United States.
   ``Before Mount St. Helens, volcanos were seen as something from
the dinosaur era, interesting, but something that happened
somewhere else ... it caught everyone by surprise, even the
geologists who work on it,'' Christiansen said.
   ``This is the first time we've had a real laboratory'' in modern
U.S. history to study volcanos, emergency reponse to eruptions and
the rebirth of a blast zone, said Cowlitz County Commissioner Van
Youngquist.
   ``Our entire state is in a better position now ... whether it's
St. Helens or another Cascade volcano'' that erupts, he said.
   Scientists recounted the earthquake pattern before Mount St.
Helens erupted May 18, 1980, with the fury of 2,500 Hiroshima bombs.
   The eruption, which killed 57 people and scarred a once-lush
landscape, still evokes searing memories but the commemoration also
celebrates nature's recovery power.
   About 400 people who participated in the rescue and recovery
operations were expected at a reunion dinner here tonight.
   The southwest Washington hamlet of Toutle is staging a special
edition of its Volcano Daze festival on Saturday and Sunday, hoping
for thousands of visitors.
   U.S. Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., and other dignitaries planned
to dedicate a $500 million dam Saturday on the north fork of the
Toutle River. The dam is designed to keep 258 million cubic yards
of volcanic sediment from clogging rivers and flooding lowlands.
   The Weyerhaeuser Co., which says it lost $68 million worth of
its trees in the eruption, is giving dignitaries tours to show the
greening of more than 45,000 acres it has replanted.
   Youngquist toured the volcano area by air Thursday.
   ``Going back now, I can never forget what it looked like when I
got a helicopter tour the morning after the eruption.'' he said.
``It was very eerie. A strong sulfur smell from the crater ...
Vehicles with victims in them. It was a shocking feeling one can
never forget.
   ``But there is also a sense of renewal. ... You can see insects
and birds and wildlife.''
   Federal, state and local governments have spent more than $1
billion on rescue, recovery and reconstruction since the blast.
   Officials at the main visitor center at Castle Rock are girding
for a major tourism boom as the slumbering volcano returns to the
front pages and news broadcasts. About 500,000 visitors come each
year. About 50,000 have scaled the 8,363-foot peak since it was
reopened to climbers three years ago.
   Most folks seem to remember precisely where they were on that
quiet Sunday morning when the mountain erupted. A few months after
waking from a century-long slumber, the mountain blew its top at
8:32 a.m. on May 18, 1980.
   With the energy of a nuclear warhead of as much as 50 megatons,
the eruption ripped off 1,315 feet of the previously cone-shaped
peak.
   The eruption sent ash plumes miles into the atmosphere and ash
clouds turned day into night in eastern Washington. The blast
devastated more than 230 square miles in a fan-shaped swath north
and northwest of the volcano.
   Although part of the new 110,000-acre National Volcanic Monument
looks like a lunar landscape, life is returning. Some trees planted
