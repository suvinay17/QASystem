A Canadian town that claims to be the birthplace of Winnie the Pooh wants to 
erect a giant statue of the famous bear, but Walt Disney studios will not 
permit it. 
</P>
<P>
"Winnie the Pooh is a Canadian," said Tom Bagdon, president of the Chamber of 
Commerce in White River, Ontario, about 50 miles north of Lake Superior. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't understand why Disney gave us such an abrupt answer. We feel they 
have a movie and a half here in the true story of Winnie." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Born Near White River 
</P>
<P>
Bagdon explained in a telephone interview that the bear on whom British writer 
A. A. Milne based his children's stories and whose copyright Walt Disney Co. 
now holds was born near White River in 1914. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Colebourn, a veterinarian with the Second Canadian Infantry Brigade, 
bought young Pooh from a trapper for $17 when he was passing through White 
River on a troop train. 
</P>
<P>
Colebourn, an Englishman who had settled in Winnipeg, Manitoba, named the 
1-foot-tall cub after his adopted city, and the troops nicknamed her Winnie. 
The young American black bear sailed with the soldiers to England and became 
the mascot of the brigade. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a great morale booster for the troops," said Colebourn's son Fred, 64, 
in a telephone interview from Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
He said his father left the tame bear at the London Zoo only after a commanding 
officer decided that Winnie could not go to the front lines in France. 
</P>
<P>
At the zoo, Milne and his son, Christopher Robin, spotted the bear who now 
figures so prominently in children's literature. 
</P>
<P>
"You could pat her like a dog. The kids rode on her back," Colebourn said. 
"They never had a bear like her and I don't think they have since." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Monumental Plans 
</P>
<P>
He added that Pooh's origins are fully documented in his father's detailed 
diaries and in official papers in the London Zoo archives. 
</P>
<P>
When residents of White River learned there was proof that the well-known bear 
hailed from their town, they made plans to build a 25-foot-high monument to 
Pooh pictured in Milne's books. 
</P>
<P>
"They want to cash in on the bear because they're in a depressed time. They're 
looking for anything to give the economy a boost," said Colebourn. "That's why 
they were so happy to hear about Winnie the Pooh and their connection." 
</P>
<P>
But Disney, based in Burbank, would not go along with the plan. In a letter to 
a lawyer representing White River, the company said such a move would not be in 
line with its "contractual commitments and present and future plans for this 
character." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Disney suggested that White River put up a statue of a regular black 
bear and a plaque explaining the connection to Winnie the Pooh. 
</P>
<P>
Colebourn is hoping to erect a sculpture of his father's bear and a plaque 
commemorating both Winnie and his father in Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
Bagdon said an ordinary bear statue would not draw tourists to White River and 
town residents will continue to push for Disney's bear. 
</P>
<P>
A statue of Pooh like the one in the books would be "one of the greatest 
attractions across the Trans-Canada highway," he said.

<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co. has relented, and Winnie the
Pooh will be immortalized with a statue in a small Canadian town
after all.
   Officials in White River, Ontario, received a letter from a
lawyer for the entertainment company authorizing the town to proceed
with its plans to honor the bear made famous in children's stories
by A.A. Milne.
   White River clims it is Pooh's birthplace and sought approval to
build the statue from Disney, which acquired rights to the character
in 1961.
   Disney initially said no. The company is protective of its
trademark characters and copyrights and recently has increased legal
efforts against those trading on its products without a license.
   But White River Mayor Ollie Chapman said Thursday she believes
Disney bowed to public pressure. ``We got calls from people as far
away as Australia who said, `Go for it. Give it the good fight. Show
them they're not God,''' Ms. Chapman told The Orlando Sentinel.
   Disney lawyer Robert Ogden had one condition for the statue: Pooh
must resemble the drawings in Milne's stories and not Disney's
character.
   ``We're happy about it,'' said the mayor. ``We are starting a
fund-raising program now to raise money for the statue.''
   The Pooh legend started in White River during World War I.
   Harry Colebourn, a veterinarian with a Canadian infantry brigade,
bought a bear from a trapper for $17 when he was passing through
town on a troop train. The young black bear sailed to Europe with
the soldiers.
   The bear, named Winnie for Colebourn's hometown of Winnipeg,
could not go to the front lines, so it was left at the London Zoo.
There, the bear later captivated Milne's imagination and became a
character in his stories along with Milne's son, Christopher Robin.

Walt Disney Co. has changed its mind and decided to allow a giant statue of 
Winnie the Pooh to be built in the Canadian town near where the famous little 
bear was born. Disney -- which holds copyright to all reproductions of Winnie 
the Pooh -- turned down a request made earlier this year by the town of White 
River, Ontario, saying it had other "contractual commitments" for Pooh. Tom 
Bagdon, president of the White River Chamber of Commerce, thinks adverse 
publicity may have caused the Disney Co. to relent. "When we were refused and 
that went public they were swamped with calls," Bagdon said. "Once they 
verified the claim that Winnie the Pooh was a real bear and our story was 
accurate, their lawyers said we could go ahead and put up our statue." 
According to Bagdon, Pooh, the bear on whom British writer A.A. Milne based his 
children's stories, was born near White River in 1914. The cub was later taken 
to Europe and left at the London Zoo where Milne and his son, Christopher 
Robin, spotted the gentle American black bear. Shauna Snow and ALEENE MacMINN

ENDPAPERS: THE COUNTERCULTURAL WINNIE-THE-POOH

<P>
Though the characters in "Winnie-the-Pooh" were drawn from A. A. Milne's own 
life and that of his son, they are also figures that might appear in any 
childhood. Who has not had a cheerfully reckless friend like Tigger, or a wryly 
gloomy one like Eeyore? Even more to the point, what child -- or adult -- has 
not had days when he or she felt like Tigger or like Eeyore, or as small and 
nervous as Piglet? 
</P>
<P>
It was Milne's genius to have created, working from such apparently simple 
materials, these universal types, and to have constructed in a few acres of 
English countryside a world that has the qualities both of the Golden Age of 
history and legend, and the lost paradise of childhood -- two eras that, 
according to psychologists, are often one in the unconscious mind. 
</P>
<P>
Among the characters seen from a child's viewpoint, Pooh is the child himself. 
The rest have virtues and faults particular to some adults and some children; 
Pooh, the hero, has the virtues and faults common to all children. He is 
simple, natural and affectionate. But he also is a Bear of Very Little Brain, 
continually falling into ludicrous errors of judgment and comprehension -- he 
is so greedy that he eats Eeyore's birthday jar of honey on his way to deliver 
it. Yet these faults are also endearing; all of us at birth were stupid and 
greedy, but no less lovable for that. As Milne himself has remarked, children 
combine natural innocence and grace with a "brutal egotism." 
</P>
<P>
" 'Oh, Bear!' said Christopher Robin. 'How I do love you!' 
</P>
<P>
" 'So do I,' said Pooh." 
</P>
<P>
But slow though he is, Pooh always comes through in an emergency. When Roo 
falls into the river, everyone behaves in a typical way: 
</P>
<P>
" 'Look at me swimming,' squeaked Roo from the middle of his pool, and was 
hurried down a waterfall into the next pool. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was doing something to help. Piglet . . . was jumping up and down 
and making 'Oo, I say' noises; Owl was explaining that in a case of Sudden and 
Temporary Immersion the Important Thing was to keep the Head Above Water; Kanga 
was jumping along the bank, saying 'Are you sure you're all right, Roo dear?' . 
. . Eeyore had turned round and hung his tail over the first pool into which 
Roo fell, and with his back to the accident was grumbling quietly to himself. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
" 'Get something across the stream lower down, some of you fellows,' called 
Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
But it is Pooh who rescues Roo just as he later rescues Piglet; it is Pooh who 
discovers the "North Pole." 
</P>
<P>
If Pooh is the child as hero, Christopher Robin is the child as God. He is also 
the ideal parent. He is both creator and judge -- the two divine functions 
shared by mortal parents. He does not participate in most of the adventures but 
usually appears at the end of the chapter, sometimes descending with a machine 
(an umbrella, a popgun, et cetera) to save the situation. 
</P>
<P>
Milne's ironic view of the adult world and its pretensions is sometimes 
undercut by another sort of irony addressed to adults who might be reading the 
book aloud. These passages, which appear mostly at the beginning of 
"Winnie-the-Pooh" (there are none in the sequel), take the form of 
condescending conversations between the author and Christopher Robin. 
</P>
<P>
"'Was that me?' said Christopher Robin in an awed voice, hardly daring to 
believe it. 
</P>
<P>
" 'That was you.' 
</P>
<P>
"Christopher Robin said nothing, but his eyes got larger and larger, and his 
face got pinker and pinker." Behind the godlike child is another and more 
powerful deity: A. A. Milne, who has created both Christopher Robin and Pooh. 
</P>
<P>
There are other partly concealed messages from the author to the adult or 
adolescent reader. The verbal hypocrisies of greed are mocked in Tigger, those 
of cowardice in Piglet, and those of polite etiquette in Rabbit. A similar 
criticism may lie behind the frequent attempts of the characters to elaborate 
some error or misunderstanding into a system, as with Pooh and Piglet's hunt 
for the Woozle. As soon as a real fact or observation is introduced, the system 
collapses, and the Woozle vanishes. 
</P>
<P>
Milne's language, too, contains hidden messages. He pretends not to understand 
long words and makes fun of people who use them. He employs a special form of 
punctuation, capitalizing words usually written with a lower-case letter, as is 
done now only in theatrical and film publicity. 
</P>
<P>
But in the Pooh books the effect is reversed: Milne capitalizes to show that 
though the character takes something seriously, the reader need not do so. When 
Pooh remarks "I have been Foolish and Deluded," the words are weakened by the 
capital letters; to have said that Pooh was foolish and deluded would have been 
much stronger. 
</P>
<P>
A subversive side effect of this procedure is to weaken words that are 
conventionally capitalized and, by extension, the things they stand for. Milne 
was aware of this; in an essay on his poem, "The King's Breakfast," he makes a 
suggestion for reading the lines: 
</P>
<P>
 The King asked 
</P>
<P>
 The Queen and 
</P>
<P>
 The Queen asked 
</P>
<P>
 The Dairymaid: 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be afraid of saying 'and' at the end of the second line; the second and 
third words have the same value, and you need not be alarmed because one is a 
royal noun and the other is only a common conjunction." 
</P>
<P>
When Milne uses a word, it means what he tells it to mean; his Bears and 
Expeditions are of a very special kind. He makes the rules; he determines what 
things and emotions will be allowed into his books and on what terms. 
</P>
<P>
In the same way, when Milne came to write his "Autobiography" he tended to 
remember selectively. His own childhood appears through a kind of golden haze: 
"The sun is shining, goodness and mercy are to follow me (it seems) for ever . 
. . fifty years from now I shall still dream at times that I am walking up 
Priory Road." 
</P>
<P>
As Milne himself once announced, "Art is not life, but an exaggeration of it; 
life reinforced by the personality of the artist." And an exaggerated, 
sentimental -- and also sometimes rather condescending -- tone appears at times 
in the "Autobiography," especially when Milne speaks of his father. Describing 
his own departure for boarding school, he writes: 
</P>
<P>
"Farewell, Papa, with your brave, shy heart and your funny little ways; with 
your humour and your wisdom and your never-failing goodness; . . . 'Well,' you 
will tell yourself, 'it lasted until he was twelve; they grow up and resent our 
care for them, they form their own ideas, and think ours old-fashioned. It is 
natural. But oh, to have that little boy again, whom I used to throw up to the 
sky, his face laughing down into mine -- ' " 
</P>
<P>
This nostalgic theme recurs in the Pooh books, particularly in the final 
chapter of "The House at Pooh Corner": 
</P>
<P>
" 'Pooh, when I'm -- you know . . . will you come up here sometimes?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Just Me?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Yes, Pooh.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Will you be here too?' 
</P>
<P>
" 'Yes, Pooh, I will be, really, I promise I will be, Pooh.' 
</P>
<P>
" 'That's good,' said Pooh." 
</P>
<P>
This is also sentimentality, but a sentimentality that rises into pathos, by 
means of the pathetic fallacy. In fact, the world of childhood and the past, 
our discarded toys and landscapes, will not mourn us when we leave; the regret 
will be felt by our own imprisoned earlier selves. Milne ascribes to his father 
and to Pooh the passionate regret he feels for his own lost paradise. 
</P>
<P>
"Winnie-the-Pooh" is essentially a modern version of an archetypal legend. It 
is a very old one (almost the first, in biblical terms) -- the story of a 
peaceful animal kingdom ruled by a single benevolent human being. Milne even 
tells us that Christopher Robin, like Adam, gave names to his subjects. 
</P>
<P>
It seems no accident, therefore, that the threat of change and loss enters this 
Eden in the shape of a tree of knowledge. One day, Christopher Robin is 
discovered to be missing from the Forest. He has gone to school for the first 
time and is learning his alphabet, beginning with the letter A. 
</P>
<P>
Piglet comes across this letter A, arranged on the ground out of three sticks, 
and thinks "that perhaps it was a Trap of some kind." Eeyore, a little later, 
is first respectful and then contemptuous: " 'Clever!' said Eeyore scornfully, 
putting a foot heavily on his three sticks. 'Education!' said Eeyore bitterly, 
jumping on his six sticks. 'What is Learning? . . . A thing Rabbit knows!' " 
</P>
<P>
He is right to be bitter. It is Education that will, by the end of "The House 
at Pooh Corner," have driven Christopher Robin out of his self-created Eden. 
</P>
<P>
No wonder that this particular lost paradise, this small safe, happy place 
where individuality and privacy are respected, should appeal to people growing 
up into a world of telegrams, anger, wiretapping, war, death, and taxes -- 
especially to those who would rather not grow up. 
</P>
<P>
Milne's loosely organized society of unemployed artists and eccentrics, each 
quietly doing his own thing, might have a special attraction for counterculture 
types. For them, Pooh Corner would be both the lost past and the ideal future 
-- at once the golden rural childhood they probably never knew, and the perfect 
commune they are always seeking.

   Ashdown Forest, where Christopher Robin's father
conjured up Winnie the Pooh, Piglet and Eeyore, was sold to local
authorities for $2.2 million.
   The 6,000 acres of heath and woodland, the largest open space in
southeast England, was put on the market last year by the executors
of the estate of the 10th Earl de la Warr.
   The buyer, East Sussex County Council, pledged Thursday to allow
continued public access to the forest, which was badly damaged in
the October 1987 hurricane.
   The forest was the setting for the children's stories conjured up
by A.A. Milne 60 years ago for his son Christopher Robin's
entertainment.
   Conservationists and Pooh fans successfully fought off an attempt
by British Petroleum last year to drill for oil in the forest.

   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and Walt Disney Co. announced a Mickey Mouse business deal. 

   Officials of the two companies, accompanied by Mickey, Minnie Mouse and Winnie-the-Pooh, signed a 10-year agreement giving Sears exclusive rights to develop clothing, toys and other products using certain Disney characters. 

   The characters include those in new Disney animated films as well as those in Disney's library of full-length animated films. 
Chicago-based Sears won't have exclusive rights to what Burbank, Calif.-based Disney calls its "standard characters" -- Mickey and Minnie, Donald Duck and Goofy, among others -- although it will be able to develop products using the characters. 
Sears also will develop a Disney brand of merchandise. 

   Sears's line of Winnie-the-Pooh clothes and accessories, developed under a previous 22-year-old exclusive licensing agreement with Disney, has generated sales of more than $1 billion in the past decade, the company said. 

   Sears agreed to promote at least two animated Disney films annually in its stores and catalogs and to sponsor two attractions at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla. 
Sears officials declined, however, to say how much the retailer would spend on the ventures.

<TEXT>
   Ventriloquist Paul Winchell asks, `How do you
spell Tigger?'' and slips into a voice fitting for a cartoon tiger:
`` T-I-double grrrr-E-R.''
   Winchell, during an interview, frequently demonstrates the range
of cartoon voices he does for Disney and Hanna Barbera.
   But there are faint echoes across the executive dining room atop
the animation building at the Disney Studios. You hear a ``Quack,
Quack!'' here and a ``Quack, Quack!'' there. Other people at other
tables are also doing cartoon voices.
   For a moment you feel you've wandered into the Ink and Paint
Club in ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?''
   For the last 20 years, Winchell has been the voice of Tigger,
the zany tiger in the animated versions of A.A. Milne's beloved
``Winnie the Pooh.'' The first effort, ``Winnie the Pooh and the
Blustery Day,'' won an Academy Award as best animated movie short
in 1968. It has now become a Saturday morning series on ABC as
``The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.''
   Winchell, in fact, does voices for two other Saturday morning
shows: Disney's ``Gummi Bears'' and Hanna Barbera's ``The Smurfs.''
He's also done voices for such movies as Disney's ``Aristocats''
and ``The Fox and the Hound.''
   Until he began working on cartoons, Winchell was better known as
a ventriloquist and the man behind dummies Jerry Mahoney and
Knucklehead Smith. His dummies are now at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington.
   At the age of 13 he was a winner on radio's ``Amateur Hour'' for
doing his imitation of Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy.
Ventriloquist Bergen was his childhood hero, and Winchell said one
of the greatest thrills of his life was a joint appearance with
Bergen on the game show ``Masquerade Party.''
   ``We appeared as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,'' he said. ``After we
unmasked, we picked up each other's dummies. I did Charlie
McCarthy, and he did Jerry Mahoney. It was a magic moment.''
   Winchell made his television debut in 1947 and within a year was
host of ``The Bigelow Show.'' He was also host of a number of
children's shows, including ``The Paul Winchell-Jerry Mahoney
Show'' and ``Circus Time.''
   ``I first met Walt Disney 25 or 30 years ago,'' he recalled.
``He said, `We're both in the same business. I use cartoons and you
use dummies and we both entertain children.' That was long before I
started working here. Walt gave me a VIP tour of the studio. I
remember people doing voices. I said, `Gee, that must be fun.' And
here I am.
   ``Ventriloquism today is in a slump. Children today haven't been
exposed to it. Edgar Bergen was an enormous hit in radio. But I
think television defeats ventriloquism. Children are so used to
seeing puppets that when they see a real ventriloquist they don't
understand it. On television, everyone talks and they don't care
about the mechanics.''
   Winchell, white-haired at 66, suffered a heart attack two years
ago. ``My cardiologist said I could still do voices,'' he said,
``but to avoid working with the rest of the cast to avoid the
stress. The studio's been very nice to me. I can come in, do my
voices alone. I was able to do some of them in a recording studio
in Miami when I was visiting there.''
   He said when he does a voice he likes to create an entire
character. ``Many people do different voices, but the basic rhythm
is always the same,'' he said. ``I try to do more than just using a
falsetto or pitching my voice. I always look for little
distinctions in each voice. Little characteristics or
idiosyncrasies.
   ``Tigger, for instance, has a little lisp and a little laugh. My
wife is British and has a lot of sayings that I throw in. She'll
say, `TTFN. Ta-ta for now.' So Tigger will say that and laugh. It
gives a character more dimension.''
   Winchell is writing an autobiographical novel, which he jokingly
calls ``Dummy Dearest.'' It's actually called ``The Strange Saga of
Jimmy Flood'' and will closely parallel his own career and life.

   LOS ANGELES -- The company that controls the rights to the
"Winnie the Pooh" stories and characters filed suit against
Walt Disney Co. in Los Angeles Superior Court, charging
breach of contract in connection with videocassette and
certain other revenues it says it is owed.
   Stephen Slesinger Inc. filed the lawsuit, which bears some
similarity to a suit filed by singer Peggy Lee, who supplied
voices and co-authored songs for the film "Lady and the
Tramp." Her contract was drawn up in 1952, well before the
age of video, and she and Disney have different
interpretations of language in the document as to whether she
is owed a share of the profits from Disney's successful video
release of the film years later. She is seeking $50 million
in a jury trial set to begin Monday in Los Angeles Superior
Court.

   The Slesinger lawsuit charges that Disney failed to make
payments for the release of several Winnie the Pooh videos
and for certain other rights, including merchandising. The
contract mentioned in the suit, which seeks unspecified
damages, was signed in 1961 and amended in 1983 after a
series of disputes, according to attorney Barry B. Langberg.
A Disney spokesman said Disney hadn't seen the suit and
couldn't comment.

   ABC shows won two of 20 citations from
Action for Children's Television, an advocacy group that honored
children's shows for creative excellence.
   ACT, in keeping with its theme of using television to encourage
children to read, gave its ``Stop, Look &amp; Listen'' award to ``Daddy
Can't Read,'' an ABC Afterschool special that confronted adult
illiteracy ``in a solution-oriented story for children and
families,'' the 10,000-member organization said.
   ``Creative excellence in children's TV is still the exception to
the rule of mediocrity,'' said Peggy Charren, who founded the
organization in 1968. ``But these ACT award-winners demonstrate
that a concern for the TV needs of young audiences can result in
programs that help families learn, laugh, think and care.''
   ABC on Monday also won a commercial broadcast award for ``The
New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh,'' which Charren said was ``an
imaginative extension of the Pooh stories ... preserving the
essence of the original characters.''
   Boston's WNEV also received a commercial broadcast award for
``Ready to Go!,'' a morning program that combines news, weather and
games for children.
   Other winning programs that were based on children's literature
include ``The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,'' produced by Sony Video
Software, and Lancit Media's ``Ramona.''
   The ACT achievement award recipients were:
   Stop, Look &amp; Listen Award: ``Daddy Can't Read,'' ABC Afterschool
special.

FT  05 DEC 92 / Books: Tales old and new pop up with pictures - Children
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
as in life - the best ideas are often the simplest ones, striking the reader
with the force of inevitability. The First Christmas (Frances Lincoln,
Pounds 9.99) falls into this category, a picture book for the very young
which brings together some of the great biblical paintings of the
Renaissance from London's National Gallery and carefully chosen texts from
the authorised version of the Old and New Testaments. It is a marvellous way
of introducing great art - and the Christmas story - to young children.
Other outstanding picture books of the autumn include The Story of the
Creation (Orchard Books, Pounds 8.99) by Jane Ray, which is full of this
exhilarating artist's luminous colour and primitive stylisations of birds
and animals; Puss in Boots (Little, Brown, Pounds 8.99), retold by Lincoln
Kirstein, one of the founders of the New York City Ballet, and illustrated
with great panache and theatricality by Alain Vaes, a set-and-costume
designer for that same company.
For slightly older children, though still published in lavish picture-book
format, there is an excellent re-telling by Vivian Werner of the story of
the ballet Petroushka (Victor Gollancz, Pounds 9.95), illustrated by John
Collier, one of America's most talented young illustrators. Cinderella and
the Hot Air Balloon (Frances Lincoln, Pounds 7.99) by Ann Jungman is a racy,
updated version of the Cinderella story illustrated with brio by Raymond
Eyto, a young artist who, having absorbed many influences, past and present,
is now beginning to look very visually distinctive indeed.
The majority of pop-up books scarcely fall into the category of books at
all, but there are a couple of outstanding examples this autumn that deserve
a mention. The ever-inventive publishers of Winnie-the-Pooh have produced an
excellent Winnie-the-Pooh Pop-up Theatre Book, (Methuen, Pounds 12.99) which
manages to provide a toy theatre on every spread (together with moving
characters) and a tantalising envelope at the back which opens to reveal
free-standing figures that can be deployed at will or whim. And, for those
parents who cannot resist the pressure from beneath to purchase Thomas the
Tank Engine titles, there is a splendidly inventive piece of cardboard
engineering entitled Thomas's Big Railway Pop-up Book (Heinemann, Pounds
9.99).
The best of the traditional story collections for children of four and above
is The Kingfisher Treasury of Stories for Children (Kingfisher, Pounds
12.99), edited by Edward and Nancy Blishen, which appeals by its excellent
selection of stories, many of them written by such well-known writers as
Arthur Ransome, James Reeves and Margaret Mahy, its generous format and
simple though very appealing colour illustrations throughout.
An intriguing variant upon old themes is provided in The Cloth of Dreams
(Little, Brown Pounds 12.99), a collection of new fairy tales for young
children. James Mayhew's lavish illustrations almost drown the text in
colour.
Children of five and above who are beginning to read on their own will enjoy
some of the new titles from Hamish Hamilton's Cartwheels series: Goodnight,
Monster by Carolyn Dinan, Mrs Simkin and the Groovy Old Gramophone by Linda
Allen and SOS for Rita by Hilda Offen, all at Pounds 4.99. The majority of
books published in series of this kind tend to be formulaic; Cartwheels
manage to rise above that sort of thing.
Children who are ready for the novel proper and who have moved beyond the
need to be seduced by illustrations ought to sample that veteran storyteller
Rumer Godden, whose new novel, Listen to the Nightingale (Macmillan Pounds
9.99) about a little girl who has twin yearnings to succeed at becoming a
ballerina and to own a King Charles Spaniel almost overwhelm her.
Other books highly recommended for the eight to 10 age group are The Puffin
Book of Funny Stories (Viking, Pounds 9.99), edited by Helen Cresswell; an
excellent (or 'thoroughbred' as the publisher describes it) anthology of
horsey stories called, with maximum inventiveness, Horse and Pony Stories
edited by Christine Pullein-Thompson (Kingfisher, Pounds 7.99); and Hands
Off Our School] by Joan Lingard (Hamish Hamilton, Pounds 8.99), a novel
which describes the fight to save a little Highlands school from closure.
Older readers with a sophisticated taste for England's largely mythical past
should read Merlin Dreams by Peter Dickinson (Gollancz, Pounds 7.99), a very
compelling rehash of the Merlin legend, interwoven with medieval fantasy and
much Celtic embroidery. Kids in pursuit of what it feels like to be an
American teenager will enjoy Bingo Brown's Guide to Romance by Betsy Byars
(Bodley Head, Pounds 7.99).
And finally, for all those adults who wish to cure an itch to know what the
great fairy tales were like in their first English versions - before, that
is, they were bowdlerised and sentimentalised by the Victorians - should buy
a copy a a great classic of children's literature that has just been
reissued, The Classic Fairy Tales, researched and presented by Iona and
Peter Opie (Oxford, Pounds 17.95). The pictures alone will give the browser
a potted history of English children's book illustration.

<HEAD>British Petroleum Gives Up Plans For Drill Near Pooh Corner</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Petroleum has dropped its bid to drill for
oil next to a southern English forest where A.A. Milne conjured up
the immortal Winnie the Pooh more than 60 years ago, the Osberver
newspaper reported Sunday.
   It said the giant oil firm decided not to appeal the East Sussex
County Council's refusal to grant a test-drilling permit for the
area near Ashdown Forest.
   Milne's son, Christopher Robin Milne, 67, was quoted as saying,
however: ``There never can be a total victory while it is
government policy to drill for oil regardless of what lies on the
surface.
   ``They will drill anywhere, except possibly under Buckingham
Palace.''
   In 1925 the Milne family moved from London to the Sussex County
woodlands, near Upper Hartfield village, which became the home of
Christopher and his Bear of Very Little Brain.

'Nothing,' said Piglet, taking Pooh's paw. 'I just wanted to be sure of you.' "

This is from A. A. Milne's "Winnie The Pooh" and is probably the thing that

AS LONG as we are in a positive vein, let's send up a post-Thanksgiving hosanna 
for the Walt Disney guys and their new production, "The Little Mermaid," the 
first traditional fairy tale of its kind from the Disney animators since 1959, 
when they released "Sleeping Beauty." What a winner for the coming Christmas 
season! And if you have noticed that some Disney commercials appeal to kids, 
while others appeal to grown-ups, well, that's how the film goes as well. This 
wonderful experience is a treat for everybody in the family.

I loved the crab impresario, Sebastian (voice by Samuel E. Wright), and his 
Jamaican and calypso and reggae styles. Then there is Ursula, the sea witch, 
looking divine and with the voice of actress Pat Carroll. Kudos to "Little Shop

than anything new on Broadway.

H-E-R-E-'S EDDIE! The "Tonight Show" sidekick, Ed McMahon, is going to wed his 
new girlfriend, Joanna Ford, in July. By then, he assumes his tempestuous 
divorce from wife, Victoria, will be all over and done with. Ed already told 
Joanna to go out and buy them a new house in the $5-million range. Joanna has 
found a place in the $8-million category. Not bad for a restaurant maitre d'

SOCIAL SPLITS from the nation's capital: Muffy and Henry Brandon have separated

IF YOU think Kathleen Sullivan looks better and acts happier these days on "CBS 
This Morning," it's most likely because she IS. Kathleen had some rough times 
earlier this year, particularly when her parents were seriously injured in an 
automobile accident. I believe Kathleen had trouble finding a sympathetic ear 
at CBS for her personal problems. But now her parents are doing well. And 
Kathleen is "working out" these days with a fabulous new trainer. And, she has 
a new executive producer, Eric Sorenson of L.A.'s KCBS, who has helped smooth 
her path.

<P>
"THE LISBON TRAVIATA" is another reason to go to the Big Apple. This wonderful 
Terrence McNally play will slay you if you love opera; but even if you are like 
Jiggs of the comic strips, you'll enjoy it. Beverly Sills celebrated her 33rd 
wedding anniversary a week ago by dropping in to see it with hubby Peter 
Greenough. The opera diva just adored it; "It knocked me out," says she.

<HEAD>`China Beach,' `Wonder Years' Among Humanitas Prize Winners</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC's ``China Beach'' and ``The Wonder Years''
were among winners Thursday of 1989 Humanitas Prizes, given for
network programs displaying ``values that enrich the viewing
public.''
   The 15th annual cash prizes were also awarded to an edition of
the ``CBS Schoolbreak Special'' and an episode from ABC's ``The New
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.''
   NBC's documentary ``Destined to Live,'' about breast cancer, also
was singled out to receive a Humanitas prize.
   There were no awards for television movies this year because
Humanitas organizers felt no project deserved recognition.
   Patricia Green, the writer of ``China Beach's'' ``Promised Land''
episode, was given a $15,000 prize for her dramatization of the
absurdity of racial prejudice and her portrayal of the importance of
peace.
   In the 30-minute category, Matthew Carlson took a $10,000
Humanitas prize for writing the ``Pottery Will Get You Somewhere''
episode of ``The Wonder Years.'' Carlson's segment dealt with a
family's struggle with new roles, and a child's response to his
parents' failure to communicate.
   A $10,000 award was presented to writer Alan Gansberg in the
children's live action competition. Gansberg's script for ``My Past
is My Own'' on the ``CBS Schoolbreak Special'' explored the power of
seemingly powerless people and the theme that today's freedoms are
the result of earlier sacrifices.
   For children's animation, Doug Hutchinson and Larry Bernard will
split $10,000 for scripting the ``Find Her, Keep Her'' episode of
``The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh.'' The episode examined the
need to both hold onto and let go of love.
   The prizes were sponsored by the Human Family Institute, a
non-profit organizition dedicated to the humanities.
   The Rev. Elwood Kieser, president of the institute, said future
awards ceremonies would recognize programs presented by public and
cable television and feature films.

English</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Britain's army of civil servants got new marching
orders Wednesday: use plain English.
   Citing such authorities as Confucius and Winnie the Pooh, a
Cabinet Office pamphlet appealed to the bureaucrats to be clear and
concise in talking to the public and to each other.
   Britain's 500,000-member civil service has never been known for
using a word when three would do, as the pamphlet notes in citing
this 18th-century note from the Commissioners of Excise to the
Supervisor of Pontefract:
   ``I am ordered to acquaint you that if you hereafter continue
that affected and schoolboy way of writing, and to murder the
language in such a manner, you will be discharged for a fool.''
   The Duke of Wellington railed against official jargon as ``the
futile driveling of mere quill-driving.''
   Some of the examples given as good writing would make those
quill-drivers blanch. It quoted this note from a minister in
ancient Egypt to a senior civil servant:
   ``Apollonius to Zeno, greeting. You did right to send the
chickpeas to Memphis. Farewell.''
   The pamphlet was written by John Wright, head of information at
the Cabinet Office. The introduction is by Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, who likes to be thought of as the enemy of verbose
bureaucrats.
   ``She's a very great friend of the plain English campaign and
extremely keen on the civil service using plain English,'' said
Wright. ``She is a plain-speaking woman.''
   Mrs. Thatcher writes: ``Too often clarity and simplicity are
overwhelmed by pompous words, long sentences and endless
paragraphs.''
   Or as the book of Ecclesiastes admonishes: ``Let thy speech be
short, comprehending much in few words.''
   Among the tips in the pamphlet:
   _ ``Use shorter words. Write `try' for `attempt,' `about' for
`concerning,' `more' for `additional.' Long words are often a sign
of a stodgy style that sends readers to sleep.''
   _ ``Use short sentences. Aim at an average of 15-20 words _ even
shorter if you can manage it. You can still be polite and, if need
be, formal or forceful.''
   _ ``Use jargon and abbreviations only when you're sure the
reader knows what they mean. Otherwise explain them.''
   It suggests sentences with active verbs, such as ``the
department decided that employees should work from 9 to 5'' instead
of ``the decision of the department was that employees should work
between 9 and 5.''
   Or as Confucius would say: ``If language is not correct, then
what is said is not what is meant; if what is said is not what is
meant, then what ought to be done remains undone.''
   ``Remember,'' says the pamphlet, ``readers are in a hurry to get
to the point. They don't want to be stuck in a verbal traffic jam.''
   Wright told The Associated Press the problem has been clearing
up in recent years. ``There's increasing use of crisp and direct
language. There's a great deal of plain English around.''
   That would please Winnie the Pooh, that bear of little brain who
signs off the pamphlet: ``Long words bother me.''

'SANTA BARBARA,' TWO LATINO STARS TOP DAYTIME EMMY LIST; 
</P>
<P>
AWARDS: JOAN RIVERS REBOUNDS FROM FOX DEBACLE TO TAKE BEST TALK SHOW HOST 
HONORS. SUSAN LUCCI OF 'ALL MY CHILDREN' WAS A LOSER FOR THE 11TH YEAR IN A 
ROW.

NBC's "Santa Barbara" was named best drama series for the third year in a row 
and two of its Latino stars also walked off with awards Thursday at the 17th 
annual Daytime Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
"Sally Jessy Raphael" won the Emmy as best talk show and PBS' "Reading Rainbow" 
was honored as best children's series in ceremonies held at the Marriott 
Marquis Hotel in New York City and broadcast nationally on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
Joan Rivers, whose late-night talk show flopped on Fox Broadcasting three years 
ago, was chosen daytime's best talk show host, even though her syndicated 
series, "The Joan Rivers Show," was not nominated. 
</P>
<P>
"I always had a fantasy about winning one of these," Rivers said in her 
acceptance speech. 
</P>
<P>
While handing out thank yous to her staff, she began to cry. "Two years ago, I 
couldn't get a job and my income dropped," she said. Then, alluding to her late 
husband, Edgar Rosenberg, who committed suicide in August, 1987, she said, 
"This is really for him. He was with me at the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
"Jeopardy!" was named best game show, and its host, Alex Trebek, shared the 
Emmy for best host with Bob Barker of "The Price Is Right." Trebek had won last 
year; Barker won in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
A tie also was voted in the category of best animated program. ABC's "The New 
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh," which won last year, shared this year's award 
with another Saturday morning series on ABC, "Beetlejuice." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the Emmy for best daytime soap opera, "Santa Barbara" also picked up 
awards for A Martinez as best actor, Henry Darrow as best supporting actor, 
directing and lighting direction. The NBC serial had won six Emmys last year. 
</P>
<P>
Kim Zimmer, who plays Reva Shayne Lewis on "Guiding Light," was named best 
actress in a daytime drama. Among the actresses she beat out was Susan Lucci of 
"All My Children," who has now been nominated for 11 consecutive years without 
winning. One of Lucci's co-stars, Julia Barr, won as best supporting actress. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, CBS won 12 Daytime Emmys and PBS captured 11 -- seven for "Sesame 
Street." Syndicated programs garnered 10, NBC got 9, ABC received 8 and the 
Disney Channel got 1. 
</P>
<P>
The Daytime Emmys, covering the period between March 6, 1989 and March 5, 1990, 
were presented jointly by the Los Angeles-based Academy of Television Arts 
&amp; Sciences and the New York-based National Academy of Television Arts &amp; 
Sciences.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: KICKOFF TIME FOR TV'S SUPER BOWL OF GLITZ

<TEXT>
<P>
It is 7 a.m. Tuesday, and the television set in the hotel room is switched to 
NBC's "Today" program. 
</P>
<P>
Bryant Gumbel opens by announcing that America's most notorious death-row 
inmate has finally been executed in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"Ted Bundy has died today," Gumbel says. Gumbel is somber. His co-host, Jane 
Pauley, is somber. There are weighty matters to contemplate, the heinous crimes 
Bundy committed, the issue of capital punishment. But suddenly, there is a 
knock on the hotel room door. 
</P>
<P>
It is Winnie the Pooh. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, a small person wearing a Winnie the Pooh costume is at the door delivering 
a press release from Walt Disney Television. He hands it over and waves goodby. 
</P>
<P>
Consider this fleeting moment a microcosm of television industry reality, for 
on the floor of Houston's sprawling George R. Brown Convention Center this 
week, Winnie the Pooh, not Ted Bundy the executed serial murderer, is the real 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Spiderman and Zorro are there, delivering their greetings side by side. Kenny 
Rogers is there shaking hands. So are Yogi Bear, Joan Rivers, Don Cornelius, 
Robin Leach, Lou Rawls, Rex Reed, Dionne Warwick, Sally Jessy Raphael, Roy 
Clark, Steve Garvey, Fawn Hall and Siskel and Ebert. 
</P>
<P>
A huge curious throng -- including one of the crews from the CBS series "48 
Hours" taping here -- envelopes Geraldo Rivera as if he were the Pope. Morton 
Downey is around, taping his show. So is Judge Wapner. 
</P>
<P>
The event is broadcasting's Super Bowl of glitz and gluttony, otherwise known 
as the annual National Assn. of Television Program Executives (NATPE) 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
This is the industry's grand bazaar for syndicated (non-network) programming, 
where 225 production companies and distributors of all sizes are exhibiting 
their programs and stars for the benefit of the nation's station executives. 
</P>
<P>
Gathered under one enormous roof are international buyers, makers and sellers 
of programming ranging from such Hollywood giants as MCA TV and Paramount to a 
New York company selling "The Truth About Communism," a 1962 documentary 
narrated by Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
They're all here, your friends with the trends. You want your trash TV? You got 
your trash TV. You want your crash TV -- the new "RollerGames," "American 
Gladiators" and "Interceptor"? You got your crash TV. And your smash TV, your 
clash TV and your cash TV. 
</P>
<P>
Being here is like being hermetically sealed inside a gargantuan cocktail party 
abounding in food, booze, TV chatter and high-powered salesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
Entering some of the swanky exhibitions is like entering a Mercedes Benz 
showroom teeming with salesmen in expensive dark suits. Only they're selling 
Isuzus. 
</P>
<P>
According to one industry source, the cost of mounting an exhibit here ranges 
from $50,000 for a budget stall to $1 million for a fully equipped, fully 
staffed Rodeo Drive model that merges the skills of Hollywood's finest set 
designers and deal makers. 
</P>
<P>
MCA resembles a posh club. Twentieth Century Fox has its own mezzanine. MTM 
looks like an old hotel. Receptionists in "Star Trek" costumes sit at a 
futuristic control panel outside lushly appointed Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by potted plants, a black pianist in a white dinner jacket sits at 
an old piano playing "As Time Goes By" beneath electric fans at the entrance of 
Casablanca IV, which has become Rick's cafe. Two barely clad Las Vegas 
showgirls stand outside an exhibit where the prospective new game show 
"Hotline" is being played with actual contestants in front of an audience. 
</P>
<P>
And not far from the ring where superstars from the World Wrestling Federation 
perform daily, the star of "Monty's Traveling Reptile Show" poses in front of 
an ABC News crew with an albino Burmese Python around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
There's no escaping the selling atmosphere, even in men's room conversation: 
"He cleared 26% of the U.S., and they paid him a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
Just how much actual business is written here is debatable, however, depending 
on the show and the amount of exposure it has received prior to the conference. 
For most of the new ones, NAPTE is an ending, not a beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year is different," said Ave Butensky, executive vice president of Fries 
Distribution Co., inside his firm's upscale exhibit. "I got a thousand people 
coming in here saying, 'I'll try to come back, I'll see ya.' But who knows how 
many will come back?" 
</P>
<P>
"RollerGames" was virtually a "go" even before NAPTE, said 31-year-old David R. 
Sams, co-creator/executive producer (with Michael J. Miller) of the Quintex 
Entertainment series. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, get ready to r-r-r-r-rumble on Saturday nights, for the target of the 
funky "RollerGames" and "American Gladiator" is that American institution, 
NBC's "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
"RollerGames" is scheduled to premiere in September (on KTLA Channel 5 in Los 
Angeles) with a two-hour special followed by 26 hourlong episodes. "They're 
calling us 'crash TV,' a step beyond the current reality shows," said former 
King World sales executive Sams. A giant step. 
</P>
<P>
"RollerGames" is an upgraded, high-tech, tongue-in-checkbook, absolutely 
death-defying version of Roller Derby in which six "concept-driven" teams -- 
Bad Attitude, Hot Flash, the Rockers, the Maniacs, the Violators and the 
T-Birds -- compete on a huge figure-eight track featuring a 14-foot Wall of 
Death and a live alligator pit. 
</P>
<P>
"The stations love the alligator pit," Sams said. "Somebody asked me if we're 
gonna have the alligators at NAPTE. I said, 'No, we have enough roaming the 
floor.' " 
</P>
<P>
"RollerGames" will have cheerleaders, a "sports center" for interviews and 
commentary, a commissioner (William J. Griffiths, operator of the old Roller 
Derby) and rock bands playing at half time. "This is total rock and roll TV," 
Sams said. "We'll even have cameras mounted on the helmets so that you can see 
the crashes at skate level." And there will be crashes. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Roller Derby, Sams insists, however, "RollerGames will be on the level. 
"It is not orchestrated. The players (some of whom are from Roller Derby) will 
develop personalities, but they'll be fighting for world championships. We'll 
even have a league draft in March." And with a straight face he adds: "Will we 
have drug testing? If it's necessary." 
</P>
<P>
Isn't there a strong chance that such a gimmick show will quickly burn out and 
last only one or two seasons? "Two seasons will buy my home in Bel-Air," Sams 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
Like "RollerGames," Samuel Goldwyn Television's "American Gladiators" is 
designed to pick off the principally young, male audience that went in a big 
way for the WWF wrestling spectaculars that occasionally alternated with -- and 
even outdrew -- "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
Co-announced by former pro quarterback great Fran Tarkenton and former Chicago 
Bear Tim Wrightman, "American Gladiators" matches ordinary people against six 
inventively costumed "gladiators" -- Cattalus, Lace, Willie, Dominos, Evander 
and Zap -- in such events as power ball, pugel sticks and the always popular 
Velcro joust. In that one, the challenger and gladiator are dressed in Velcro 
body suits and dangled 10 feet above ground. The gladiator tries to throw his 
or her opponent against a Velcro-covered wall. 
</P>
<P>
Says an excited Tarkenton on the promotion tape shown prospective clients: "The 
NFL is nuthin' like this!" 
</P>
<P>
Yet the future of "American Gladiators" is iffy at this point. It would hold 
challenger tryouts throughout the nation, with the top male and female 
challengers ultimately replacing two of the regular gladiators. Not Lace, one 
hopes, for she is billed as "controlling men for her own pleasure and making 
other women grovel at her feet." 
</P>
<P>
"This is a chance for the average man or woman to become a folk hero," said 
Goldwyn Television President Dick Askin, who likens "American Gladiators" to 
"Battle of the Network Stars" and says the contests are not predetermined. "The 
thing we're trying to avoid is the sleaze element," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Interceptor" seems to avoid intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
However, that may be a premature judgment. Fries Entertainment has only a 
paucity of promotional materials on hand -- mainly consisting of a 6-foot-5 man 
dressed up in black leather as the Interceptor himself and an excerpt of the 
defunct British series on which the premise is based -- to illustrate 
"Interceptor." Bearing a resemblance to "The Running Man" movie, the show so 
far is down only for an hour special (on Channel 5 in Los Angeles) that would 
be a test for a possible series. 
</P>
<P>
"Our development people were over in England and said they saw this terrible 
show that wasn't developed properly," said Fries senior Vice President Peter 
Schmid, who characterized the concept as an "adult comic book." 
</P>
<P>
The excerpt of the English series is unintentionally hilarious, showing 
contestants on dirt bikes roaring across an obstacle course while trying to 
avoid an "Interceptor" who carries a zapper. Meanwhile, a sort of 
director/authority figure gives them clues on getting through the course to a 
home base where a key awaits. Using the key, they unlock their backpacks and 
win the game and prizes. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to do away with that English twit you saw," said Schmid, who added 
that the look of the Interceptor may change too. "You'll never know his 
identity. He should be mysterious. He may look like G.I. Joe or a Ninja," 
Schmid said, producing drawings of both. 
</P>
<P>
Or even Winnie the Pooh, for this is NAPTE.

SATURDAY MORNING CARTOONS OFFER GOOD REASON TO SLEEP IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past few years, Saturday morning cartoons have undergone a minor 
renaissance. The appearance of "The Gummi Bears," "My Pet Monster," "A Pup 
Named Scooby-Doo" and "The Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" seemed to promise a 
happier era of higher standards in children's programming. 
</P>
<P>
But the new shows for the 1989-90 season, which debuted on the past two 
Saturdays, break that promise: Parents will need a post-hole digger to find the 
standards used in making them. These series suggest a return to the bad old 
days of the '70s, when storytelling in cartoons vanished like the vitamins 
Uncle Ben supposedly sealed into rice, and "animation" meant images that were 
drawn, rather than images that moved. 
</P>
<P>
This decline can be attributed to a number of factors: the falling value of the 
dollar and the concomitant rise in overseas production costs; breakneck 
production schedules; reduced network license fees on Saturday morning; the 
limits that anti-violence pressure groups have placed on slapstick comedy and 
dramatic conflict. But assigning blame doesn't alter the result: American 
children are getting inferior entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Here's an overview of the new Saturday morning lineup -- and it seems 
appropriate that the same word would be used to describe this array of shows 
and suspected criminals. 
</P>
<P>
NBC Programs 
</P>
<P>
"Camp Candy." A formula cartoon sitcom with a caricature of John Candy ineptly 
riding herd on a standard assortment of smart-mouth kids. There's a snooty 
Valley Girl, a "cool" boy ("Dude!"), a nerdy little boy with glasses, a tomboy 
obviously modeled after Peppermint Patty. Although billed as a "live 
action/animated comedy," there was no live action in the first episode -- and 
precious little comedy. 
</P>
<P>
"Captain N: The Game Master." A formula cartoon adventure about Kevin, a 
teen-aged boy who somehow gets sucked into an animated world of computer games. 
Naturally he's a whiz at Nintendo games, and uses his skills to aid beautiful 
Princess Lana in her battle against the evil Mother Brain, a disembodied 
monster whose voice sounds like a Little Richard album played at about 30 
r.p.m. This premise has been used before ("TRON," "The Last Starfighter"), but 
all these characters seem to do is plug the various games. 
</P>
<P>
"The Karate Kid." This cheapo adventure based on the popular films ranks as the 
worst new show of the season. The first episode had Daniel, Mr. Miyagi and a 
girl named Taki rafting down the Amazon in pursuit of a magical "shrine." How 
they got to South America, where Taki came from and the source of the shrine's 
powers, were never explained. A more significant puzzle is why Miyagi talks in 
the sort of fortune-cookie dialogue that went out with Charlie Chan movies 
("Honorable gentleman is what Daniel-san call 'real jerk' "). Isn't NBC's 
standards and practices department supposed to prevent racial stereotyping on 
children's shows? And why did Pat Morita -- who supplies the character's voice 
-- lend his talents to this turkey? 
</P>
<P>
"ALF Tales" puts the cartoon version of Alf into various classic fairy tales. 
The writers seem to be trying to redo Jay Ward's irreverent "Fractured Fairy 
Tales," but the results are utterly flat. It's also not clear that children 
will understand the references in some of the punch lines: "I'll have to check 
the warranty on my liposuction." No worse than a trip to the dentist without 
anesthetic. 
</P>
<P>
CBS Programs 
</P>
<P>
"Dink, the Little Dinosaur," owes a lot to Don Bluth's "The Land Before Time." 
Both focus on cute-as-a-button baby dinosaurs of different species who learn to 
play together. (Their behavior is supposed to offer a subtle lesson in 
tolerance.) The enormous size of the dinosaurs is one of the principal reasons 
for their enduring popularity with children, but "Dink" robs them of that epic 
scale and reduces them to so many saccharine squeeze toys. 
</P>
<P>
"The California Raisins." Will Vinton's commercials of animated clay raisins 
dancing to old rock songs launched a marketing phenomenon. The Raisins are so 
popular on toys and T-shirts, it was probably inevitable that someone would get 
the semi-bright idea of using them in a children's show. The drawn animation in 
the series, however, fails to re-create the slick, funky motions of the clay 
characters. Rather than make the animators draw a lot of wrinkles, the Raisins 
have been redesigned with smoother bodies, which makes them look like the 
California Eggplants. The net result, an inane comedy about a show-biz group 
with a hapless manager, resembles a lame retread of the old "Alvin Show." 
</P>
<P>
Kidvid attempts to go hip in "Rude Dog and the Dweebs": The title character and 
his garish canine followers are drawn in an angular, new wave style. 
Unfortunately, these with-it designs only look good from one or two angles and 
tend to fall apart when the artists try to move them. Underneath a lot of 
pseudo-cool gnarlyspeak ("Yo, Dudes, get rude!") is an ordinary cartoon sitcom 
about a pack of talking animals living in an otherwise normal city, in the 
dubious tradition of "Top Cat" and "Foofur." Yo, Dudes, get the "off" button! 
</P>
<P>
The one new ABC series, the regrettable "Beetlejuice," already has been 
reviewed. Despite the inclusion of "Beetlejuice" and "Slimer and the Real 
Ghostbusters" in its schedule, ABC offers the best Saturday morning fare: "A 
Pup Named Scooby-Doo," "The Gummi Bears/Winnie the Pooh Hour" and "The Bugs 
Bunny and Tweety Show." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, anyone who doubts the negative impact of the former Reagan 
Administration's decision to loosen the restrictions on the number of 
commercials shown on Saturday morning should try watching an hour of kidvid. 
Young viewers are deluged with ads for toys, chewing gum, sugar cereal and 
other over-sweetened treats. The cereals may be presented as "a part of this 
balanced breakfast," but this plethora of commercials hardly constitutes 
balanced viewing.

   Eight-year-old DeAndra Anrig says
she felt like Winnie the Pooh when an airplane snagged her kite
line and lofted her on a 100-foot ride.
   ``I read about how Winnie the Pooh flies in the air on kites,
but I never wanted to try it,'' said DeAndra, who let go just as
the kite carried her toward a tree. ``I wasn't thinking anything
but how scared I was.''
   ``She said it was just a big jerk that lifted her (10 feet) into
the air,'' said DeAndra's mother, Debby. ``It carried her right
over my husband's head. All he saw was a shadow going over his
head. I'm just thankful she let go.''
   DeAndra escaped from her ride with bruises. Sympathetic
neighbors delivered cupcakes Tuesday to her home in Dublin, 30
miles southeast of San Francisco, where she rested on an air
mattress surrounded by ice packs and two of her stuffed animals.
   DeAndra and her parents were picnicking Sunday with friends at a
park 2 miles from the Palo Alto airport when the accident occurred.
   DeAndra was taking her turn flying the 12-foot, glider-type kite
when a twin-engine plane descending toward the airport caught the
kite's 200-pound nylon test line.
   Mountain View fire marshal Frank Moe said the 70-pound child was
carried about 100 feet before letting go.
   ``There was no way the people in the plane could have known what
was happening,'' said Ken Markowitz, a lawyer for the Reno Flying
Service, owner of the Care Flight medical transport plane that
tangled with the kite.
   Pilot Jack Uranga of Reno, Nev., was flying a patient to
Stanford University Hospital when the propeller snagged the line,
Markowitz said.
   Despite damage to one propeller blade, Uranga managed to land
safely, but the plane is grounded until repairs are made, Markowitz
said. Uranga said Tuesday that company regulations prevented him
from discussing the accident.
   In San Jose, Federal Aviation Administration official Edge
Ritter said the plane sustained a 2-inch gouge in one of its two
propellers. He was unable to estimate the cost of repair or the
height of the plane when it caught the line.
   Mountain View authorities said they would post signs at
Shoreline park advising that kite flying has been banned there. The
Public Utilities Commission prohibits kite flying within 5 miles of
an airport.
   Ritter said there frequently are kites in the park area, but
this was the first such accident.
   ``There had been planes flying over all that afternoon,'' said
DeAndra's father, Brad. ``And there were kites everywhere _ 15 to
20 of them, some up as high as 200 feet.''
   He and DeAndra found their kite after the incident _ about half
a mile away _ with about 60 feet of line still attached.

Like mischievous gremlins, teddy bears have multiplied like mad and taken over 
the home of Rosemary and Paul Volpp. 
</P>
<P>
There are bears everywhere inside their two-story Buena Park residence -- 
sitting on top of the refrigerator, napping under the coffee table, overflowing 
from bookshelves and china cabinets and just making themselves comfortable on 
tables, beds, dressers and the mantle above the fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
There's King Arthur, a rare 1904 Steiff holding court in his red velvet cape, 
inside a curio cabinet; Bo and Dearheart, two 1905 creations of the Steiff Co. 
in what is now West Germany, cavorting in a crib, and Poirot, a contemporary 
bear who sits in the Volpp's bathroom in his shower cap, waiting for his turn 
to bathe. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been waiting two years," Rosemary says. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps have about 5,000 teddy bears, one of the largest collections in the 
world -- probably even the largest, the Volpps say. Those bears that can't fit 
in the home have been put in storage -- enough bears to fill 100 boxes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was getting to where we couldn't walk around in here," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps collect bears big and small, from a six-foot, 1970s Steiff bear made 
for display in a toy store who greets visitors at their front door to a bear so 
tiny that it can fit inside a walnut shell. 
</P>
<P>
"A bear is a bear is a bear," Rosemary says. 
</P>
<P>
They have bears of all ages, from the earliest prototypes made in the 1900s to 
contemporary "artist" bears. 
</P>
<P>
Artist bears are handcrafted, elaborately dressed bears that can sell for 
several thousand dollars even when they're new. Often they're numbered and 
issued by the artist in limited edition, just like a fine print. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps have one of eight special-edition teddy bears made for Whoopi 
Goldberg when the comedian was a presenter for a Make-A-Wish Foundation 
benefit. The teddy, dubbed Whoopi Goldbear, wears dreadlocks and sequined 
sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
There's also a Southern belle bear with an elaborate cream-colored satin gown, 
Little Bear Riding Hood in a red cape, a Cinderella bear, a Theodore Roosevelt 
bear in his riding outfit, a Statue of Liberty bear, a bear dressed up as 
Father Christmas in a red-velvet, fur-trimmed cape and even a crazy bear in a 
straitjacket. 
</P>
<P>
"I call that one a self-portrait," Rosemary jokes. 
</P>
<P>
Old bears, meanwhile, attract the couple because they wear the badges of their 
previous owners' affection. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary loves bears that look well loved, their mohair fur matted or bald in 
spots from too much play, their button eyes scratched. 
</P>
<P>
"If they could only talk," she says, admiring their furry faces. 
</P>
<P>
Many of their old bears are rare, including the celebrity bear, Aloysius, a 
patched-up 1907 Steiff featured in the British TV miniseries "Brideshead 
Revisited," and a bear identical to the original Winnie the Pooh bought at 
Harrod's in London for Christopher Robin, son of Pooh author A.A. Milne. 
</P>
<P>
Among the older bears, those made by the Steiff Co. in Germany in the early 
1900s are the most sought after by collectors. These childhood toys, revered 
for the quality of their workmanship, are bought and sold by adults for 
thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Hans-Otto Steiff, the company's ambassador, has called the Volpp's collection 
of Steiff and other bears "unequaled in the world as to rarity and quality." 
</P>
<P>
While the Volpps have uncounted Steiffs, among their favorites are Bo and 
Dearheart, 24-inch golden-haired bears with center seams down the middle of 
their faces. During its first years in the bear-making business, Steiff was 
frugal and used remnants of mohair for the faces of some of the bears, making 
them an especially rare find today. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps enjoy dressing and displaying their bears just as much as they like 
adding to the collection. 
</P>
<P>
The couple has orchestrated bear wedding parties, bear beach outings, bear 
hayrides, bear fishing trips. They've dressed the bears as cheerleaders, 
Dracula, baseball players, chefs, an ice cream man and Hawaii-bound tourists. 
At Halloween, the bears wear pumpkin suits, at Christmas they wear Santa hats 
and at Thanksgiving they're dressed like pilgrims. 
</P>
<P>
Rosemary's 82-year-old mother, Marie Chidesta, makes most of the bears' 
costumes. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps give each of their bears a name and often endow them with a 
personality. 
</P>
<P>
"The bears kind of talk to you," Paul says. 
</P>
<P>
Ambrose, a copper-colored Steiff made about 1907, arrived in the mail that 
afternoon wearing a green velvet suit. Paul swears that the bear looks ornery. 
</P>
<P>
"He hates that suit. I think he's worn it long enough to be upset. He may even 
bite," Paul tells Rosemary. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps don't regard bears as investments. 
</P>
<P>
"It bothers me when Steiff comes out with limited-edition bears and people buy 
(one), thinking it will double in value in a couple of years. It will not," 
Rosemary says. 
</P>
<P>
While they prefer bears made with mohair fur, jointed limbs and a cone-shaped 
nose that isn't too long, they'll take any bear whose overall appearance makes 
them feel "comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the best ways to measure a bear is if it makes you smile," Rosemary 
says. "Some will make you laugh out loud." 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps began collecting bears in 1982, joining what has become the 
fourth-largest adult hobby in the United States, according to Rosemary. 
</P>
<P>
Paul already had impressive collections of antique model trains and full-size 
trucks. While at a model train and toy show, a friend of Paul teased Rosemary 
into buying her first bear, a North American Bear Co. creation she bought for 
$42 and named Amelia Bearheart. A similar bear recently sold at auction for 
about $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, bears have found their way into the Volpp home via all kinds of 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
"The bears come with crazy stories. One woman sold us her childhood bear 
because she needed money for a furnace," Paul says. 
</P>
<P>
They found Tucker, a 1903 caramel-colored Steiff, at an estate auction. He had 
been sitting nearly untouched for decades in an old Arrow shirt box. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of sad," Rosemary says. "I wonder why nobody played with him." 
</P>
<P>
Grand Fellow, a 28-inch 1905 Steiff, came in a barrel, "wrapped unceremoniously 
around the good china," Paul says. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps love to get a bear directly from its original owners. Paul recalls 
when two well-dressed, elderly women approached Rosemary at a bear show: 
</P>
<P>
"One of them said, 'I have my childhood bear, would you like to see her?' The 
bear was a collector's dream -- one of the first bears made by Ideal. She'd 
bought it in 1904." 
</P>
<P>
The woman liked Rosemary and would sell it only to her. 
</P>
<P>
Often, old people sell their childhood bears to the Volpps because they know 
that the couple will give them a good home instead of selling them to the 
highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't sell bears, we collect them," Rosemary says. "Unfortunately, we keep 
picking them up." 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps adopt the bears, calling them by the same name used by the original 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd be surprised how many people name their bears Teddy," Rosemary says. 
"When we get a Teddy, we usually add on another name." 
</P>
<P>
Teddy Long John, a 1905 Steiff, got his name when he underwent repairs and was 
found to be stuffed with old underwear. The Steiff factory sometimes used old 
rags when workers ran out of stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
The Volpps also have picked up rare bear memorabilia, including a sketch of a 
little bear by Washington Post cartoonist Clifford Berryman that appeared on 
all of his cartoons depicting Theodore Roosevelt, for whom teddy bears are 
named. 
</P>
<P>
The couple travels up to 40,000 miles a year to teddy bear conventions 
sponsored by collector clubs, giving slide shows and exhibits of their bears. 
</P>
<P>
They write a column for the Teddy Bear and Friends magazine, telling other 
collectors how to best display their collections, and they've written three 
books on decorating with bears. 
</P>
<P>
Paul, who turned his construction machinery business over to his son and 
son-in-law, spends much of his time photographing the bears in their costumes 
for the books and magazines. 
</P>
<P>
While the Volpps try to keep from buying more bears, they have trouble 
resisting bears when they attend a show. 
</P>
<P>
"A bear will jump out at you and you'll take that one," Rosemary says. At the 
Volpp home, there's always room for one more. 
</P>
<P>
The International League of Teddy Bear Clubs will hold a teddy bear show and 
sale today from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Doubletree Hotel at the City, 100 The 
City Drive, Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Admission is $3 for adults, $1.50 for children, with proceeds used to buy bears 
for the Orangewood Children's Foundation.

<LEADPARA>  Amrit Sandhu, 4, sat quietly in her chair in front of a computer perched on a
kid-size table. When her teacher asked a question, Amrit cocked her head to
look at the screen, then popped up and eagerly pushed one of the computer
keys. Her touch moved the cursor on the monitor.;    For Amrit, the world of
disk drives and floppy disks is as familiar as the world of Bambi and Winnie
the Pooh. But it wasn't always that way. She learned about computers through a
series of classes called Computertots, which exposes preschool children to the
machine that is used in many elementary schools and has dramatically changed
the workplace.  </LEADPARA>

RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 3/6/91, pg. 2);  Because of a photographer's error, a
photograph of Carole Lechleitner on Page 7 of the Feb. 27 edition of the
Weekly Part 2 was incorrectly identified.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Once a week, for about a half-hour, Amrit and three other preschoolers
gather in a small room in the Adventure Children's Center in Union City. There
they follow the instructions of Lin Stefanick, who leads them through games
that teach them how to operate the computer.;    "Basically, it's something
everyone is going to use, so why not get them comfortable with it," said Carol
Lechleitner, who owns the Computertots franchise for Alameda and Santa Clara
counties. "It's really giving them a comfort level so they feel good about
trying something new.";    The Computertots program, which was started by two
Virginia special education teachers in 1984, tries to make computer learning
fun. Each class begins with a song about computers, using the music from
familiar nursery rhymes. The program has a stuffed turtle for a mascot, called
Computer Turtle, who the kids hug before class to get them going.;    Then the
children use educational software to learn about numbers and letters. In one
popular lesson a cookie will pop up on one side of the screen and kids will
have to match it to a set of three cookies on the other side of the screen,
Lechleitner said. That teaches them recognition, and reinforces counting
skills, she said.;    "The kids don't realize this is supposed to be
learning," said Cindy Breeden, whose 4-year-old daughter, Jennifer, takes
Computertots at the St. James Christian Preschool in San Leandro.;   
Lechleitner has set up Computertots classes in 21 preschools in Alameda
County, and plans to set up classes in Santa Clara County in the fall, she
said. The series of four half-hour classes costs about $30. When the children
are finished, they will know about the parts of the computer, how to turn it
on and off, and how to do rudimentary programs.;    "It's really something the
children look forward to," said Eleanor Gothberg, who runs the Adventure
Children's Center. "I think it will make them self-confident when they
encounter computers in elementary school. All the elementary schools have them
now."; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The Newark Recreation Division will sponsor a
Computertots series on Thursdays, starting March 7. The series, open to
children 3 to 5 years old, will cost $36. If interested, call (415) 522-9020.  </TEXT>

NBC'S 'SANTA BARBARA' IS TOP DAYTIME EMMY WINNER

<P>
With "Santa Barbara" winning six Emmys, including best soap opera honors for 
the second consecutive year, NBC had something to crow about Thursday at the 
16th Annual Daytime Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, which televised the two-hour ceremonies at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel here, 
won a total of seven Emmys, followed by ABC with five, syndicated programs with 
three, CBS with two and PBS with one. 
</P>
<P>
It was a day of disappointment, however, for Susan Lucci, who was making her 
10th bid to win a best actress Emmy as Erica Kane of ABC's "All My Children." 
That honor went instead to Marcy Walker, who plays Eden Capwell on "Santa 
Barbara." 
</P>
<P>
Other "Santa Barbara" cast members who picked up Emmys were Nancy Lee Grahn 
(who plays Julia Wainwright) as best supporting actress, Justin Deas (Keith 
Timmons) as best supporting actor, and Justin Gocke (Brandon Capwell) as best 
juvenile male. It was the second consecutive win for Deas. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Barbara" also won for best writing on a daytime serial, bringing its 
total Emmys this year to eight. In nontelevised ceremonies for the craft 
categories last Saturday, the NBC soap had been honored for makeup and 
hairstyling. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Lucci's loss, "All My Children" won other tributes Thursday. David 
Canary was a repeat winner as best actor in a soap opera, honored for the 
second straight year for his dual roles of Adam and Stuart Chandler, and Debbi 
Morgan (who plays Angie Hubbard) shared supporting actress honors with Grahn of 
"Santa Barbara." Canary also had won in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For the third year in a row, "The Oprah Winfrey Show" was named daytime's best 
talk show. But neither Winfrey nor nine-time winner Phil Donahue won as best 
talk show host. They lost out to Sally Jessy Raphael for the syndicated series 
that bears her name. 
</P>
<P>
Public television's "Newton's Apple," the 6-year-old science magazine, was 
named best children's series, and ABC's "The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" 
won as best animated program. 
</P>
<P>
CBS' "The $25,000 Pyramid" was named best game show, while Alex Trebek picked 
up the award as best game show host for his work on the syndicated "Jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
In the first year that they were eligible for Daytime Emmys, cable programs did 
not win any during Thursday's ceremonies. But the cable industry had picked up 
four of the golden statuettes at the nontelevised event last Saturday. HBO's 
children's series "Encyclopedia" won two, for makeup and costume design, 
Cinemax's "James Stewart's Wonderful Life" captured a special program award and 
the Disney Channel's "Kids Incorporated" picked up an Emmy for lighting 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
Counting the craft awards, CBS wound up with a total of 17 Daytime Emmys. NBC 
had nine, PBS got eight, ABC and syndicated programs collected seven each. 
</P>
<P>
During the telecast Thursday, Victoria Wyndham of NBC's "Another World" paid 
tribute to her longtime co-star in the series, Douglass Watson, who died May 1. 
A former Emmy winner, he had been posthumously nominated for again as best soap 
opera actor. 
</P>
<P>
Wyndham, who worked with Watson for 16 years, called him "a risk taker, 
exacting and a gentleman. He gave 100%. . . . He was generous with his 
compliments and gentle with his criticism. He was the perfect acting partner." 
</P>
<P>
The Daytime Emmys, covering the period between March 6, 1988, and March 5, 
1989, were presented jointly by the Los Angeles-based Academy of Television 
Arts &amp; Sciences and the New York-based National Academy of Television Arts 
and Sciences.

   As a boy, Michael Dukakis enjoyed sports books
starring a fellow called ``the Duke'' and young Mario Cuomo learned
the virtues of family from ``Swiss Family Robinson.''
   Two girls named Kay Orr and Rose Mofford read ``Little Women.''
   Those are some of the results of a survey asking the nation's
governors to name their favorite childhood books. The survey,
conducted by Pizza Hut Inc., was to help mark National Young
Reader's Day on Wednesday.
   The most oft-cited gubernatorial favorites were by Mark Twain:
``Tom Sawyer,'' named by 10 governors, and ``Huckleberry Finn,''
cited by a dozen.
   Among others listed by more than one governor were ``Treasure
Island,'' the Dr. Seuss books, ``Black Beauty,'' ``Charlotte's
Web,'' and ``The Red Badge of Courage.''
   Michigan Gov. James Blanchard recalled ``Paddle to the Sea'' by
Holling C. Holling, about an Indian boy who built a canoe and
paddled from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. ``I can still
remember feeling like I was part of the trip,'' he said.

of Congress's ``Year of the Young Reader'' project, scheduled a

<HEAD>Teddy Bear Museum Opens In Shakespeare's Birthplace</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   STRATFORD-UPON-AVON, England (AP) _ Tourists who tire of
Elizabethan relics can now concentrate on stuffed toys, thanks to
the opening of the National Teddy Bear Museum in this town where
playwright William Shakespeare was born.
   Museum director Gyles Brandeth said he chose to open the
exhibition on the Fourth of July in honor of President Teddy
Roosevelt, who became the namesake of the child's toy for refusing
to shoot a baby bear on a 1902 hunting trip.
   ``We've teddy bears of every shape and size from more than 20
different countries,'' said Brandeth.
   The museum, in a 16th-century building in the heart of
Stratford-upon-Avon, contains more than 1,000 teddy bears,
including replicas of Winnie-the-Pooh, Paddington and Rupert the
Bear, all childrens' storybook heroes.
   As well as famous bears, the museum houses bears belonging to
famous people, including Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's bear
Humphrey, and Opposition Labor leader Neil Kinnock's Iswlyn.

   With two Top 10 movies and a bustling new
studio tour in Florida, The Walt Disney Co. already is having a hot
summer.
   A 7{-minute appearance by Roger Rabbit, the '80s answer to Mickey
Mouse, is helping pack families in for showings of Disney's ``Honey,
I Shrunk the Kids.''
   Robin Williams, whose risque brand of humor probably would have
made the late Walt Disney blush, is pulling a whole different
audience for ``Dead Poets Society.''
   And the Disney-MGM Studios tour outside Orlando puts the
granddaddy of amusement park companies at the forefront of the
latest trend in fun factories by taking customers backstage to play
at movie-making.
   It's the new Disney _ one that repulsed a raid on the Magic
Kingdom of the business world five years ago, revved up a plan to
make movies for older audiences and devised new ways to wring
billions out of a familiar lineup of animated characters and
amusement parks.
   With fine-tuning, that remains the formula for the future, said
Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``To me it's not what next, but what's not next,'' Eisner said in
an interview. ``We have plenty to do with the Disney franchise, with
the Disney attractions, with the Disney image, to keep us occupied
for 20 years. We don't have to go out and prove that size is
better.''
   Fostering the franchise has paid off. Disney's earnings rose 17
percent last year to $522 million on sales of $3.4 billion. In the
first half of this year, earnings totaled $149 million on sales of
$1 billion. (The second half is bigger because of summer park
visitors and movies.)
   The amusement parks _ Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif. and Disney
World in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., _ are Disney's biggest moneymakers,
accounting for more than half its sales and earnings.
   But the big story of the last few years is movies, particularly
the young adult-oriented films produced by Disney's Touchstone
Pictures studio.
   Movies like ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' ``Cocktail'' and ``Who
Framed Roger Rabbit'' propelled Disney to the top spot in the box
office derby last year for the first time. Disney movies captured
19.4 percent of the nation's ticket sales, ahead of Paramount at
15.2 percent, 20th Century Fox at 11.6 percent and Warner Bros. at
11.2 percent.
   The company's two early entries this summer _ the traditional
Disney family comedy ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and Touchstone's
``Dead Poets Society'' _ have drawn scant media attention, partly
because of the hoopla over blockbusters like ``Batman'' and
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.''
   But both are making enough to put them among the top 10
box-office attractions. ``Honey,'' which is preceded by the Roger
Rabbit cartoon ``Tummy Trouble,'' set a Disney record by collecting
$14.3 million its opening weekend.
   Hollywood is impressed with Disney's shrewd marketing, its move
to sign a stable of young stars like Bette Midler and Tom Cruise,
and an unusual emphasis on containing production costs.
   During the movie and television scriptwriters' strike last year,
union negotiators saw Disney studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg as
their nemesis on the producers' joint negotiating group.
   In TV, the company also is mixing the old with the new. ``Golden
Girls'' and ``Empty Nest'' supplement broadcast staples. The boom in
home video is a boon to Disney with its library of children's
favorites and new features.
   In the fiercely competitive amusement park business, new
attractions are crucial, and Disney's bid for glory this year is the
studio tour in Florida. The $400 million addition to the Magic
Kingdom and Epcot Center includes peeks at working movie studios, a
re-creation of the Hollywood Boulevard in ts 1930s heyday and a
do-it-yourself music video.
   The company declines to release attendance figures for its parks,
but insiders say crowds at the new studio tour in Florida are
running above expectations. The company gets royalties from Tokyo
Disneyland and is lining up funding for a planned park outside Paris.
   Rival MCA Inc., which battles Disneyland for tourist dollars in
Southern California with a tour at its Universal Studios, plans to
open its Florida studio as an attraction next year and is
considering a European park.
   But analysts downplay the competition.
   For one thing, the worldwide demand for fun appears insatiable.
Then there's what has become known as the Disney magic: The
seemingly boundless affection for Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and the rest
of the cartoon gang.
   ``I think Disney owns the Florida vacation franchise and anyone
who thinks they can take that away is not going to be a happy
camper,'' says Jeffrey Logsdon, who follows the company for Crowell
Weedon &amp; Co. in Los Angeles.
   It's been suggested a recession could spoil the fun.
   Even a mild slowdown of the type many economists expect in coming
months inevitably would cut into people's spending on extras _ like
gasoline and the $94 four-day pass to the Florida complex _ says
Harold Vogel, an entertainment industry analyst at Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets in New York.
   Others doubt anything short of an economic disaster would
seriously dampen consumer enthusiasm for parks, movies and TV, both
live and recorded. After all, Hollywood's Golden Age was born during
the Great Depression.
   ``Unfortunately, the rougher it gets, the more people want to
have some exit from their environment,'' says CEO Eisner.
   Amid a wave of hostile takeover attempts at big media companies,
Disney recently tightened its defenses with a ``poison pill'' plan
that would allow present stockholders to buy new stock at half-price
if an unfriendly bid arose.
   But Disney already was considered relatively safe from raiders,
partly because of its experience with a hostile takeover attempt
five years ago. Analysts say it should remain that way as long as
the stock remains strong.
   Nearly 25 percent of the company's stock is owned by those
friendly to management, including 17 percent controlled by Texas
investor Sid Bass and allies, and nearly 3 percent in the hands of
Roy Disney, nephew of the late animator and company founder.
   A current civil trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court
reprises Disney's 1984 takeover battle, which resulted in ejection
of Walt Disney's son-in-law, Ronald Miller, from management and the
entry of Bass as a friendly investor. A shareholder lawsuit against
former management and directors alleges little investors were
wronged when the company bought raider Saul Steinberg's 11 percent
stake for a high price, a practice known as ``greenmail.''
   The Walt Disney Co. isn't a defendant.
   The company built on cartoon characters zealously defends Mickey
and the rest from impostors.
   Among its copyright actions this year: Dispatching lawyers
against three Hallandale, Fla., day-care centers that painted
pictures of Mickey and friends on their walls without permission;
blocking the city of White River, Ontario, from erecting a statue of
Winnie the Pooh; and wresting an apology for an unauthorized Snow
White song-and-dance number on the Academy Awards telecast.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: DINING WITH DISNEYANA AT MICKEY'S KITCHEN

If you can imagine picking up a pizza and a package of Mickey Mouse 
corn-on-the-cob holders inside Disneyland's It's a Small World ride, you'll 
have a pretty good idea of dinner at Mickey's Kitchen. The new Disney-owned 
restaurant inside a Disney store at Montclair Plaza, (714) 624-8111, is 
something of a suburban Toontown. 
</P>
<P>
Near the front is Winnie-the-Pooh country, with a separate yogurt bar; off in a 
corner is a replica of Tony's Italian restaurant, the setting for the love 
scene in "Lady and the Tramp." Sing-along videos of Disney hits constantly play 
on a big-screen TV (the words and a bouncing mouse head appear as subtitles). 
</P>
<P>
You order at a counter that looks like a jazzed-up McDonald's. Here, the 
uninitiated stare at the menu 
</P>
<P>
for long periods of time. Should it be a Goofy Burger? A Supercalifragi-Chicken 
Salad? Piglet Corkscrew Fries? Mouseketeer Meals (choose from Huey, Dewey or 
Louie) come with a prize. If you're confused, a helpful employee will greet you 
("Hi! Welcome to Mickey's Kitchen!") and tell you that a P and J Handwich 
stands for peanut butter and jelly. (Disneyland may be the happiest place on 
earth, but Mickey's Kitchen must be the friendliest -- relentlessly so.) 
</P>
<P>
And how does Disney food taste? A lot like the burgers you get outside Space 
Mountain -- in other words, food only a kid could love. But as one Mickey's 
Kitchen worker confided, "Everyone who comes here is a kid, really." LAURIE

   Mickey Mouse may be getting ready to step out with Miss Piggy. 

   Walt Disney Co. is negotiating to acquire closely held Henson Associates Inc., the New York-based company that controls rights to the Muppets and a host of other characters, according to individuals close to the talks. 

   A value for the transaction wasn't available, and Disney and Henson declined to comment. 
It couldn't be determined whether there were any other suitors for the Henson concern. 

   The merger would be an obvious fit, say entertainment-industry watchers, because Disney is always looking to expand its character base: Its characters can cavort in a multitude of businesses. 
In addition to making filmed entertainment and operating theme parks, Disney has a consumer-products division that distributes merchandising rights and operates a chain of retail stores that sell dolls, toys and T-shirts. 

   The Muppets have appeared in several motion pictures and a myriad of television shows for network and cable; Disney produces television shows and owns a pay cable service, The Disney Channel. 
And Disney's theme parks always have room for characters. 

   "They're really buying the licensing rights to the characters," says analyst Alan Kassan of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 
"The main thing would be the consumer products and merchandising, but there's always the possibility they could have something like a Muppet playground at a theme park." 

   One individual familiar with the talks says the economies of scale make sense in this era of consolidation in the entertainment business. 
Henson now has to pay syndication salesmen to distribute its shows; after joining Disney it could simply use the entertainment giant's existing network. 
"You can save overhead," the individual says. 

   To clear up a possible misconception: This deal wouldn't affect Big Bird, who is owned by Children's Television Workshop, a nonprofit corporation. 
Jim Henson helped create the characters on its television show "Sesame Street," but only one of those Muppets, Kermit the Frog, is a wholly owned Henson character. 
Henson Associates apparently owns a percentage of the rights to the Sesame Street characters, but a spokesperson for CTW says the details of the copyright are "proprietary." 
Mr. Henson still serves as a Sesame Street collaborator -- providing the puppeteers, and even playing the characters of Kermit and Ernie himself. 

   "Disney needs new characters because there's always a risk with Disney of overexposing the characters they do have," says one analyst, adding that the Roger Rabbit characters aren't enough to supply fresh characters to projects like the new Euro Disneyland under construction near Paris. 

   Henson Associates controls a growing library including several feature films and hours of "The Muppet Show," "Fraggle Rock" and other TV shows. 
Most are syndicated and widely seen overseas. 
CBS's cartoon hit "Muppet Babies" is produced with a partner. 
And more is coming: a feature film, "The Witches," tentatively set for October release by Warner Brothers, an HBO series and an NBC mini-series. 

   A question Disney will have to grapple with, say observers, is to what extent they integrate Henson's well-known characters with their own. 
One insider says the danger of confusing people is minimal, that Disney has taken outside characters before and made them their own. 
"Is Winnie the Pooh -- or Peter Pan," the person says, "really a Disney character?"

<HEAD>Experienced Storyteller, Barbara Bush, to Read on Radio</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush, who has been reading stories to
her own children and grandchildren for years, reaches out to a
wider audience this weekend with a nationally broadcast radio
series.
   Borrowing a page from former New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia,
the first lady will be reading children's stories over the ABC
radio network in a weekly series called ``Mrs. Bush's Story Time.''
   She'll also be offering tips in her 10 half-hour broadcasts to
parents on reading aloud to children. It's all part of her family
literacy campaign.
   Unlike New York's Depression-era mayor, who broadcast the comics
during a newspaper strike, Mrs. Bush is eschewing the funny pages
and sticking with children's literature.
   But she will get an assist from the cartoon world.
   Mrs. Bush will be reading her stories to such familiar
characters as Winnie the Pooh, Garfield, Bugs Bunny, Roger Rabbit,
Mickey and Minnie Mouse and Big Bird, done by their usual cartoon
voices.
   ``I'm not a comic reader,'' snipped Mrs. Bush.
   ``What we're trying to do is encourage families to read to their
children and take them to libraries,'' she explained in an
interview.
   ``We're going to tell them how to stop and talk and how to
explain words'' the kids don't understand, she said.
   ``Mrs. Bush's Story Time'' is a joint project of ABC's Project
Literacy U.S. and the Philadelphia-based Children's Literacy
Initiative.
   Jim Farley, executive producer of the series, calls it ``a
radical departure'' for commercial radio.
   ``American commercial radio stations don't program to kids,'' he
said. ``They don't let kids fill out (ratings) diaries, so they
don't count in the ratings.''
   For children listening to the first lady's broadcasts, ``radio
won't be a jukebox, it will be a source of both entertainment and
stimulation,'' the producer said.
   Mrs. Bush taped the broadcasts in two sittings at ABC's
Washington studios earlier this summer. The cartoon voices were
dubbed in later.
   ``This is an experienced storyteller,'' said Farley. ``She was
terrific.''
   The line up of stories include ``Ira Sleeps Over,'' ``Sylvester
and the Magic Pebble,'' ``The Story of Ferdinand,'' ``The Three
Billy Goats Gruff'' and ``Frog and Toad Together.'' Farley said the
stories are intended to hold the interest of children from ages 3
to 10.
   Mrs. Bush interrupts her own storytelling to ask her listeners
open-ended questions, and each week she offers a reading tip for
parents. Each broadcast ends with such celebrities as Oprah Winfrey
and Bette Midler talking about how reading affected their lives.
   More than 100 radio stations have signed up to air the weekly
broadcasts at various times starting this Saturday and Sunday.

   Hollywood's plan to send Bugs Bunny and his
friends into the fight against drugs won applause from Congress on
Thursday but also a request for more than just the cartoon special
set to air on national television Saturday.
   ``I hope this doesn't devolve into a mere self-promotion
activity in which we finally hear from Hollywood and this is the
last shot,'' said Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.
   ``Showing this once or twice isn't really going to change
anybody's mind who's going to use drugs,'' he said.
   Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee watched a sample of
the 30-minute special, ``Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue'' and
applauded the effort to reach youngsters.
   ``The most powerful weapon that we know in politics is the
cartoon and we hope that the cartoon will be the most powerful tool
to educate our children,'' said committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden
Jr.
   The program tells of Michael, a 14-year-old drug abuser who is
saved with help from Bugs Bunny, the Chipmunks, Daffy Duck,
Garfield, Huey, Dewey and Louie, Kermit, Gonzo, Miss Piggy, Slimer,
the Smurfs, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' Michaelangelo and
Winnie the Pooh.
   He is also saved from Smoke, a sinister, drug-pushing apparition
whose voice was provided by actor George C. Scott.
   The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences presentation, funded
by Ronald McDonald Children's Charities and McDonald's restaurant,
is set to air at 10:30 a.m. Saturday EDT and PDT, 9:30 a.m. CDT and
8:30 MDT. According to latest plans, the cartoon will be aired on
ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC and numerous independent stations and cable
outlets.
   Roy Disney, vice chairman of the Walt Disney Co. and head of its
animation department, was executive producer of the program.
   In the program, Michael lives in a pleasant, middle-class
setting where stuffed bears come to life and the Chipmunks sing and
dance while urging Michael to ``say no.''
   Asked about long-range plans, Disney Studios President Richard
Frank said the studios have been working so hard ``to get this
particular special out that we really haven't had time to sit down
and plan other ones.''
   Actually, only 15 minutes of the production were shown to the
lawmakers and some of the music as well as all of the sound effects
were missing. ``What you're going to see is minus those
embellishments,'' Disney explained.
   ``I know what I'm going to be doing Saturday morning,'' Biden
said after the screening. ``I want to hear the music.''

BUGS BUNNY, ALL HIS FRIENDS TO JOIN DRUG RESCUE ON TV SATURDAY A.M.;

<P>
Hollywood's plan to send Bugs Bunny and his friends into the fight against 
drugs won applause from Congress today but also a request for more than just 
the cartoon special set to air on national television Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope this doesn't devolve into a mere self-promotion activity in which we 
finally hear from Hollywood and this is the last shot," said Rep. John Conyers 
Jr. (D-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
"Showing this once or twice isn't really going to change anybody's mind who's 
going to use drugs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee watched a sample of the 30-minute 
special, "Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue" and applauded the effort to reach 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
"The most powerful weapon that we know in politics is the cartoon and we hope 
that the cartoon will be the most powerful tool to educate our children," said 
committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
The program, a unique collaboration of animation studios, tells the story of 
Michael, a 14-year-old drug abuser who is saved with help from Bugs Bunny, the 
Chipmunks, Daffy Duck, Garfield, Huey, Dewey and Louie, Kermit, Gonzo, Miss 
Piggy, Slimer, the Smurfs, Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles' Michelangelo and 
Winnie the Pooh. 
</P>
<P>
He is also saved from Smoke, a sinister, drug-pushing apparition whose voice 
was provided by actor George C. Scott. 
</P>
<P>
The Academy of Television Arts and Sciences presentation, funded by Ronald 
McDonald Children's Charities and McDonald's restaurant, is set to air at 10:30 
a.m. Saturday. The cartoon will be aired on ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC and numerous 
independent stations and cable outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Roy Disney, vice chairman of the Walt Disney Co. and head of its animation 
department, was executive producer of the program. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about long-range plans, Disney Studios President Richard Frank said the 
studios have been working so hard "to get this particular special out that we 
really haven't had time to sit down and plan other ones." 
</P>
<P>
Actually, only 15 minutes of the production were shown to the lawmakers and 
some of the music as well as all of the sound effects were missing. "What 
you're going to see is minus those embellishments," Disney explained. 
</P>
<P>
"I know what I'm going to be doing Saturday morning," Biden said after the 
screening. "I want to hear the music."

ABC, CBS TOP HUMANITAS PRIZE WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABC's Emmy-winning series "The Wonder Years" and "China Beach," a CBS 
Schoolbreak Special entitled "My Past Is My Own," an installment of ABC's "New 
Adventures of Winnie the Pooh" and an ABC documentary on breast cancer, 
"Destined to Live," were all winners in the 15th annual Humanitas Prize 
competition, announced Thursday at the Century Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The Humanitas Prizes, sponsored by the Pacific Palisades-based Human Family 
Institute, are given each year to network television shows which exemplify 
"humanizing achievement in television writing." 
</P>
<P>
This year's awards were given in the following categories: 30-minute ($10,000); 
60-minute ($15,000), non prime-time childrens' live program ($10,000), 
children's animated program ($10,000) and documentary (no cash award). 
</P>
<P>
As was previously announced, for the first time in its history, there were no 
nominees -- and consequently no winners -- in the $25,000 category for TV 
movies. Judges said earlier that none of this season's movies was worthy of a 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
The winning "Wonder Years" episode, entitled "Pottery Will Get You Nowhere," 
was written by Matthew Carlson, and dealt with a conflict in the Arnold family 
that made son Kevin question the stability of the family. The "China Beach" 
episode "Promised Land," written by Patricia Green, explored racial conflict 
among the troops in Vietnam following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr. CBS' "My Past Is My Own," written by Alan Gansberg, featured two 
teen-agers exploring their own histories. The "Winnie the Pooh" episode was 
written by Mike Zaslove, Doug Hutchinson and Larry Bernard; "Destined to Live" 
was penned by Sasha Ferrer. 
</P>
<P>
That the judges found no TV movies worth honoring is a symptom of what Father 
Ellwood Kieser, president of the Human Family Institute, calls "a period of 
transition and serious problems" in Hollywood. Kieser believes that increasing 
economic pressures on the networks caused by viewing alternatives such as cable 
and videocassettes, as well as recent corporate takeovers at the networks, have 
left the Big Three networks financially strapped and more likely to favor 
ratings over quality than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
"All three networks have changed ownership in recent months," Kieser said 
during remarks at the Humanitas Prize luncheon at the Century Plaza. "Those who 
bought them have incurred huge debts in the process. That means they are now 
saddled with staggering interest payments. 
</P>
<P>
"In some quarters, this has created a preoccupation with the bottom line that 
generates fear, stifles creativity and squeezes out value-oriented 
programming," Kieser said. "The tension between the creative and the economic 
is intrinsic to our business. But the situation seems worse now, much worse." 
</P>
<P>
Although all the networks, particularly NBC, blamed last summer's 154-day 
Writers Guild of America strike for some lapses in taste last season, Kieser 
said in an interview that the strike did not cause the current climate in 
Hollywood. "I really don't think that was the was the main ingredient," he 
said. "It's the pressure -- and it doesn't help to have one studio warring 
against another," he added, referring to the Paramount's ongoing attempt at 
hostile takeover of Time, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
In response to that erosion of quality, Kieser announced at the luncheon that 
Humanitas will expand its educational program for Writers Guild members by 
adding a 10-week course to its current program of three yearly seminars on "the 
incorporation of human values into entertainment programming." Kieser also 
plans to launch a series of workshops for beginning writers to be conducted by 
master writers, "to facilitate the formation of writers' support groups and to 
arrange for a mentoring program for novice writers. And, Kieser said, the Human 
Family institute plans to increase incentive for screenwriters by upping the 
cash value of the prizes so that they stay current with inflation (the awards 
are still the same size they were 15 years ago), and become "comparable in the 
aggregate to the Nobel, Templeton and MacArthur prizes." 
</P>
<P>
he group also plans to expand the awards to include a PBS/cable television 
category and a feature film category, as part of a 10-year plan to foster 
responsibility to the public among Hollywood's writers. 
</P>
<P>
"Hollywood has consistently made 'human-values' (feature) films," Kieser said. 
" 'Rain Man,' for example, showed a greedy narcissistic human being who by the 
end of the film had become very loving." 
</P>
<P>
Kieser said that "human values" should not be mistranslated to mean family 
entertainment; nor is the new award an attempt to rid film of profanity, sex or 
violence. "A movie could contain rough language and still be full of human 
values," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kieser added that, while he believes the current trend of advertisers or 
advocacy groups boycotting television shows for language or content is their 
prerogative and does not represent censorship, Humanitas prefers to "nurture 
the good things" rather than try to force shows off the air. But "I don't think 
these (advocacy groups) are nutsies -- they just want shows on the air that 
they would want their kids to see," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Kieser said the time frame for the new awards and programs has not been set. In 
part, it depends on another 10-year goal: to increase the current $1 million 
Humanitas endowment for the awards by $4 million, through donations from the 
independent producers, the major studios and the networks. 
</P>
<P>
Kieser has already secured some support from Marcy Carsey of Carsey/Werner, 
Grant Tinker of GTG Entertainment, Norman Lear and an independent producer who 
requested anonymity. They have all made 10-year pledges of $250,000. Alan 
Landsburg has pledged $200,000, David Milch $50,000, and the Finnegan/Pinchuk 
Company will donate $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I am optimistic," Kieser said in the interview. "I think there is a keen 
awareness on the part of the entertainment community that they have a 
responsibility, not just to entertain, but to enrich. They give money not just 
because they have it, but because they know they owe it to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
"So many of the poorer (TV) shows take you away from life, they are a 
narcotic," he added. "Shows which contain human values really inspire you to 
want to live it."

   ALLEN, Texas -- So far, the dinosaur character Barney has
learned a rough lesson: it's tough for an upstart to fight
Big Bird and Winnie-the-Pooh.
   As a money-maker, Barney has been slow and lumbering. But
he has avoided extinction. And his creators are learning that
a small company can break into a stronghold of world-famous
names if it's willing to change its tactics and take the
right risks.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   To many adults, at least, the goofy, purple-and-green
Barney doesn't have the charm of the Little Mermaid, or the
humor of a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. But he sold more than
300,000 kids' videos last year and claims a fan club of
56,000 preschoolers.
   Today, he is featured in special boutiques in Neiman
Marcus stores, and is headed for a nationwide Christmas
promotion at J.C. Penney Co.; toy makers and others clamor to
lease rights to him, and he's about to get his own television
series. But faced with competition from the giants that
dominate the children's entertainment industry, Barney, until
recently, wasn't earning his keep, his creators say. Now,
Barney is in the black -- but getting there was a struggle.
   Sheryl Leach, a mother and former teacher, concocted
Barney about four years ago.
   To start up the product line, she needed patience and
money. And she needed to learn business methods much
different from those of the big market leaders.
   To market Barney, Ms. Leach formed Lyons Group, a unit of
DLM Inc., a closely held educational and religious publisher
with offices here, about 20 miles north of Dallas. Lyons says
it turned its first profit in the fiscal year ended Oct. 31
-- thanks to customers such as Lawrence Rifkin.
   Mr. Rifkin says he first brought home a Barney tape for
his daughter, then age four, a year ago. When it was played,
"she started dancing around," he recalls. The show "captured
her in a way I'd never seen anything else do." The tapes,
which usually combine music and a story line, have "a simple
homespun way," he adds.
   As executive vice president for programming for
Connecticut Public Broadcasting Inc., Mr. Rifkin asked Lyons
Group if it was interested in producing a show for the Public
Broadcasting Service. The two companies put together a
proposal and last year won a $2,250,000 matching grant to
produce 30 episodes of "Barney &amp; Friends"; DLM will put up a
similar amount unless it finds underwriters. The producers
hope the series -- scheduled to start in April -- will make
Barney as famous as Big Bird.
   But Barney faces major competition. While sales of kids'
videos are growing almost 30% a year, the market is dominated
by Walt Disney Co., which can use its extensive library of
animated films to churn out old movies and short-feature
videos. Original videos with real kids and live characters
wearing animal costumes, like Barney, fill a need, but they
are more expensive to produce.
   Moreover, new publishers have difficulty getting retail
space. "Retailers are looking for things to jump off the
shelves and sell themselves," says Andrew Marrus, senior
analyst of Alexandar &amp; Associates, a New York marketing firm.
   Ms. Leach decided to try making videos after failing to
find any with live characters to entertain her son, then age
two. She took a business plan to her father-in-law, Richard
C. Leach, a father of nine who runs DLM. He agreed to put up
about $1 million to make three videos and start Lyons. Then
Ms. Leach, working with Kathy Parker and Dennis DeShazer,
hired actress Sandy Duncan and six children to join Barney as
the Backyard Gang. They made the three videos in 1988.
   Only then did their marketing education begin. Tapes
ready, Lyons bought a list of toy stores and hired 17 friends
to work telephones, setting prices to stores at a hefty 50%
discount from the suggested retail price. Lyons also offered
a money-back guarantee on unsold copies. These "momblitzers"
sold 30,000 copies of one tape. By October 1988, they had
received an $80,000 order from Toys "R" Us Inc. But next to
Disney and Sesame Street videos, Barney was an unknown to
consumers; the tapes mostly gathered dust.
   "What we didn't realize is that exposure is so important,"
Ms. Leach says. The concern paid about $15,000 for a spate of
30-second ads on Nickelodeon, a children's cable channel --
to no avail. Then a People magazine reviewer called the
Barney lyrics "stupid." (The company says it has never had a
problem pleasing children, only some adults.)
   With slow sales, Toys "R" Us threatened to send back the
tapes, and Walden Kids did just that. Then Ms. Leach and Ms.
Parker began sending free videos to a dozen or so preschools
and day-care centers near Toys "R" Us stores. The giveaways
included a note directing parents who wanted to buy their own
copies to the stores. Finally, sales started to pick up. To
keep their tapes on the shelves in this critical period, the
women sent retailers another production in exchange for the
first one.
   By 1989, retailers began discounting Disney tapes to as
low at $9.99, forcing Lyons to slash its suggested price to
$14.95 from $19.95. But as sales improved, Ms. Parker grabbed
the chance to renegotiate retail agreements. Lyons would take
back only 25% of unsold copies, and the price discount to
retailers would be only 35%, not 50%.
   Getting distributors was still a struggle, though. "Every
time we tried to do something in a traditional way, like MGM
does it, we failed," Ms. Leach says. So, working back up the
chain, Lyons wooed retailers and relied on them to ask
distributors to carry the line.
   Since the initial pan from People, the tapes have won rave
reviews from video and entertainment magazines and from
reviewers such as Gene Siskel and Leonard Maltin. Barney
videos, now numbering eight, today are sold through most
national chains.
   Lyons Group says sales have more than doubled to $3.2
million in the fiscal year ended last Oct. 31, from $1.5
million in fiscal 1990. The company projects fiscal 1992
sales of more than $6 million for Barney. Future sales also
will benefit from product licensing, which is just beginning.
   "It's a long and difficult road" to profitability for
Barney, says Mr. Leach, DLM's chairman. "On the other hand,
Barney is going to be around 10 years from now. The reason
is, we are taking no short cuts."

From the moment you walk through the flowered entrance of the Children's 
Bookshoppe, an aura of literary wealth surrounds the visitor. The big red door 
with its painted drummer boy and genuine straw hat is an entree to 
floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall bookshelves, spilling over with every type of 
children's book imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
One small section, toward the rear of the shop, has a make-believe fireplace 
draped on the wall with downsized furniture, including a bench, rocking chairs 
with pillows and small tables. In the same area are nifty little specialty 
gifts. The reasonable prices permit children to shop, using, perhaps, their 
allowance. 
</P>
<P>
Another separate small room is well-stocked with paperbacks, cassettes and 
videos only. A neighboring room, very narrow, is used for gift-wrapping and 
mailings. The shop will special order and mail books anywhere, on request. 
</P>
<P>
A special service this store renders is its children's book club membership. 
You explain the child's interests and hobbies and provide an age. Then each 
month an appropriate selection will be made by the shop and mailed to the 
child. Fees change from month to month, depending on the book involved. 
</P>
<P>
The Children's Bookshoppe offers stories throughout the day arranged by age 
groups and seasonal Winnie-the-Pooh-type parties (and other children's 
book-related parties) complete with party favors. Preregistration is required 
for the Saturday story-hour programs. 
</P>
<P>
Sara Brant opened the shop 19 years ago after many years as a school reading 
specialist. All of her part-time assistants are former librarians and teachers 
and are well-equipped to work with children. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the children, the books and I love the people here. I have formed many 
friendships with authors, illustrators and parents during the years," Brant 
says. "It's been quite a rewarding experience for me."

   President Bush and his wife, Barbara, are helping
to promote an upcoming TV cartoon that will feature an anti-drug
message for children.
   The White House, making the announcement during Bush's trip to
Canada, said Tuesday that the Bushes taped a public service ad
promoting the special, ``Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue.''
   The animated show will be simultaneously aired April 21 by ABC,
NBC and CBS _ a first in programming. It also will be shown on
cable. The commercial will run before the program.
   The program features Bugs Bunny, Alf, Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles, Winnie the Pooh, the Smurfs, Garfield, Daffy Duck and
other cartoon characters.
   In the message, Mrs. Bush calls the program ``the powerful story
of a teen-ager dealing with drug and alcohol abuse'' and tells
children to ``make the right decision _ stay away from drugs and
alcohol.''
   ``Some of your favorite cartoon characters are going to help you
understand how drug and alcohol can ruin your life,'' the president
says. ``So, watch the program. Talk about it with your family.''

ABC will pick up two awards today when Action for Children's Television hands 
out its 17th annual Achievement in Children's Television honors in Cambridge, 
Mass. "Daddy Can't Read," an "ABC Afterschool Special" about adult illiteracy, 
and "The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh," part of the network's Saturday 
morning children's lineup, are among the 20 winners from broadcast TV, cable 
and home video. ACT president Peggy Charen notes that the winners "demonstrate 
a concern for the TV needs of young audiences," but adds that "creative 
excellence in children's TV is still the exception to the rule of mediocrity."

A MERRY ROASTING OF 'BETTE AND BOO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Set designer George Suhayda chooses birthday-party colors for Christopher 
Durang's "The Marriage of Bette and Boo" at the San Diego Repertory Theatre. 
Its characters are always celebrating something: a wedding, a birthday, another 
dead baby. 
</P>
<P>
Durang's heroine, Bette (Rosina Widdowson-Reynolds) insists on having babies, 
even though she and her husband Boo (Bernard Baldan) are RH negative -- or did 
the doctor say RH positive? Anyway, Bette knows that it's God's will for her to 
be a mother, because she has always liked children better than she liked 
people. She wants to have a whole orphanage full of them, each named after a 
character in "Winnie-the-Pooh." Wouldn't that be cute? 
</P>
<P>
Since it's Christopher Durang, we can infer an autobiographical element here. 
This is his "Long Day's Journey Into Night," an examination of the people who 
molded him and the forces that molded them. Only, Durang does it as a cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
Good cartoons exaggerate; they don't lie. "Bette and Boo" touches the lunacy of 
"The Bald Soprano," but any veteran of a Catholic household 40 years ago will 
recognize some of its little touches. A birthday cake with a cross planted in 
the middle of it? Not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
Durang must have smiled when he put that in. (Or maybe director Walter Schoen, 
or the designers, or one of the actors, thought of it -- they all seem to have 
gone to school with Sister Mary Ignatius.) Durang knows the mind-set of this 
household by heart: the piety of people who secretly fear, in some cases 
rightly, that they are very vicious. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the younger sister (Sabrina LaRocca) has picked up the notion 
that a saintly person is one who apologizes at all times for everything she 
does. This is at once funny and not so funny, and Durang and actress LaRocca 
show us both sides of it, touching the not-so-funny part only enough to show 
that they recognize it. 
</P>
<P>
Widdowson-Reynolds' Bette almost seems to be getting some kind of revenge on 
God, the way she insists on putting Him through the birth process until he gets 
it right. Bernard Baldan's absent-minded Boo reacts to this by having another 
drink and taking another pledge in front of Father Donnally. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, Father Donnally. You'll love his retreat for "young marrieds," the gist of 
which is that they got themselves into this pickle -- don't come to him. Actor 
Tom Oleniacz plays the good father with a surprising amount of love, plus a 
superfatted Barry Fitzgerald accent. It's clear that everybody in "Bette and 
Boo" goes to the movies at least as often as Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore the Church can't entirely be blamed for their problems, although Matt 
(Patrick Miller), our young narrator and clearly a spokesman for the 
playwright, would dearly love to make that the explanation. Alas, his 
grandmother (the wonderful Priscilla Allen) would probably be a monster in any 
culture, one of those ever-smiling Moms who give you their shoulder to lean on, 
after having carefully kicked out your crutches. 
</P>
<P>
It's not, Durang seems to say, that the Church has screwed up these people. 
They were born that way. The Church only keyed into it. Durang may write like 
an apostate, but he still believes in original sin, and he still, somewhere, 
believes in hope. There's a lovely moment when poor, battered Matt goes to his 
disastrous Grandfather (the excellent William Dennis Hunt), and asks: "What 
should I do with my life?" It's like Red Riding Hood going to the Wolf for 
advice, but the joke is that Grandpa has some: Destroy people, if you feel like 
it, but don't try to change them. 
</P>
<P>
The play abounds with destroyed women, particularly Mary Benson as Grandpa's 
wife. She takes each of his insults with a little hiccup of merriment, like 
Billie Burke -- oh, Dad, you're such a tease, people will think you mean it. 
</P>
<P>
As a family comedy, "Bette and Boo" is one of the darkest ones around, but this 
cast serves it up as merrily as ice cream and cookies, letting the viewer say: 
Ouch. 
</P>
<P>
There'll be a production later in the summer at the Los Angeles Theatre Center, 
but it's hard to imagine it coming closer to the bone -- or the funnybone.

RICHARD EDER: NIGHTINGALE IN A CAGE; 
</P>
<P>
HAROUN AND THE SEA OF STORIES BY SALMAN RUSHDIE (VIKING: $18.95; 210 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is a book in captivity; marked by it, marred by it, and owing its own odd 
value to it. 
</P>
<P>
Salman Rushdie, still in hiding in Britain from the death sentence pronounced 
by the Ayatollah Khomeini -- whose curse failed to expire with him -- gives his 
pain the shape of a children's story. It is not a real children's story, or if 
it is, it is not a very good one. It is not really a good story of any kind; 
certainly nowhere near the quality of "Midnight's Children," or of the book 
that imprisoned its author: "The Satanic Verses." 
</P>
<P>
What it is, in its own way, is a prison document, and unexpectedly touching. 
Rushdie has written a fable about the kind of tyranny he is suffering from, one 
which seeks to cripple the Word. It is partly crippled itself. From a dancer 
confined to cramped movements in a cell, we learn two things: What a crime it 
is to confine a dancer; and what a dance looks like when deprived of what it 
requires to move, though not of what moves it in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"Haroun and the Sea of Stories" began as a bedtime story for Rushdie's son, 
Zafar, according to a publisher's note. It evolved into the voice of a man 
ostensibly performing for a child, but crying out, in fact, to the grown-up 
world outside. 
</P>
<P>
It tells of the storyteller Rashid, a bubbly fabulist in a nameless sad city, 
who loses his gift when his wife runs off with an accountant. Rashid had been 
hooked up to the Sea of Stories -- hence, his abilities -- but through a 
bureaucratic mix-up, his invisible faucet is to be cut off. Haroun, his son, 
catches a Water Genie in the act of disconnecting it. After some argument and a 
trick or two, the Genie agrees to take them to headquarters, run by a figure 
called Walrus. 
</P>
<P>
Walrus headquarters, and the Sea of Stories, are on a moon named Kahina. 
Rashid, Haroun and the Genie travel there on the back of a clockwork hoopoe 
bird. When they arrive, they find that Kahina is in crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea of Stories is being polluted by the evil Khattam-Shud, ruler of Chub on 
the dark side of the moon. After a series of adventures, Haroun, Rashid and the 
Walrus Army destroy Khattam, along with his factory-ship that is pouring poison 
into the sea. Stories will go on, unpolluted, and Rashid will get his wife 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie, whose gifts include wit and wildness in a sharp engagement with the 
world's complexities, has trouble applying these talents to the style of a 
children's story. There is humor in "Haroun" but there are also disabling 
quantities of whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
Rashid's sad city, we are told, borders on "a mournful sea full of glumfish 
which were so miserable to eat that they made people belch with melancholy." 
When Haroun suffers from a loss of concentration after his mother runs away, a 
neighbor opines: "Cause is located in his pussy-Collar-jee." The talkative 
hoopoe bird prefaces his speeches with "But . . . But . . . But." His name, of 
course, is Butt. Whimsical capitalization -- "Too Complicated To Explain," for 
example -- has echoes of "Winnie the Pooh"; the impatient creatures who conduct 
the bewildered Haroun on his adventures recall "Alice." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie fabricates the outlandish denizens of Kahina and the twists and turns 
of the story in a hurried, piled-on fashion. He forces things; he lacks the 
belief and gravity that a good children's story requires for its fantasy. 
Rushdie is interested in something else. 
</P>
<P>
The something else is his protest against oppression. And if the whimsical 
images of "Haroun" can set the reader's teeth on edge, they take on a different 
aspect insofar as they transmit a message. 
</P>
<P>
Rashid, the storyteller, is Rushdie's free artist. His dependence on the Sea of 
Stories says that art is not arbitrary and self-willed, but that it draws on 
the wellsprings of human need, and that it is as essential as water. 
</P>
<P>
Khattam-Shud, of course (it means "over and done with" in Hindustani), is a 
Khomeini. In an encounter with Haroun, he concedes that stories may be fun, but 
that life is not about fun but about control. And since stories -- art -- 
subvert control, they must be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
And Rushdie will give his fable a further turn, subtle and affecting. The 
Walrus and his organization, working to keep the Sea of Stories fresh and pure, 
had arranged to stop the moon's revolutions so that their Sea would always be 
in the sunlight. This meant, though, that Chub was always in the dark. Khattam 
thrives on darkness; his destruction is accomplished when Haroun arranges to 
get the moon turning so that sunlight hits Chub, as well. 
</P>
<P>
If a Khomeini can come to power, it is in part because the West has arrogated 
sunlight to itself, and left much of the globe bereft of it. Rushdie defies the 
Ayatollah's curse. It is he, not his persecutor, who is the true defender of 
the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie employs the style of a children's story with a trying self-indulgence. 
But he uses it to say something that is grave and moving, both in its wider 
reach, and when applied to his particular circumstances. We notice, for 
instance, his images of unconfined movement -- a bus rocketing along, the 
soaring hoopoe bird -- that this confined man uses to sustain his spirit. And 
awkwardness becomes its own art in the dedication verse that cites other 
fantasy kingdoms: 
</P>
<P>
Zembla, Zenda, Xanadu: 
</P>
<P>
All our dream-world may come true. 
</P>
<P>
Fairy lands are fearsome too. 
</P>
<P>
As I wander far from view 
</P>
<P>
Read, and bring me home to you. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie had all the time in the world to work the first letter of each line 
into an acrostic of his son's name. That incarcerated time weighs upon all of 
us; it recalls another two lines. Blake's: 
</P>
<P>
 A nightingale in a cage 
</P>
<P>
Puts all Heaven in a rage.

FT  29 DEC 93 / Cold comfort park: Euro Disney is hoping for a happier new
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most visitors to EuroDisneyland over the holiday period are there to see
Mickey and Minnie Mouse capering around the gigantic Christmas tree. Not
Alice Ross.
Mrs Ross is a woman with a mission. She is an accountant from Delaware, in
the US, and an investor in Walt Disney, the US entertainment group. Disney
has seen its shares fall sharply this year, owing to the losses it has
incurred on its 49 per cent stake in Euro Disney, the struggling leisure
company that operates the EuroDisneyland theme park. Mrs Ross was spending
two days at EuroDisneyland to see what the problem might be.
'My Disney stock has been sinking like a stone because of this place and, as
I'm over in France, I thought: 'Why not rub a little salt in the wound?' '
she said. 'I'm looking into everything. Disney holds its annual
shareholders' meeting in Delaware. I'm going to tell Mike Eisner (the Disney
chairman) what I think.'
A belligerent shareholder such as Mrs Ross is only one of the problems
plaguing Mr Eisner and his colleagues. They will spend the festive season
putting the finishing touches to the proposals they will present next month
to Euro Disney's creditor banks. They hope to persuade the banks to save the
company from collapse by agreeing to restructure its FFr20.3bn (Pounds
2.3bn) net debt. The US group has warned the banks that, unless the
restructuring is completed by March 31, Euro Disney, which reported a net
loss of FFr5.3bn for the year to September 30, will be forced to close.
In the meantime, Euro Disney is hoping for a repetition of last Christmas,
when EuroDisneyland was buoyed by a surge of visitors.
More than 30,000 people visited the theme park on New Year's eve: well below
the record of 90,000 in September last year, but much better than its low of
5,000 one icy day last January. A successful Christmas and new year would
not only help to ease the strain on Euro Disney's cashflow, but would also
act as a timely demonstration to the banks that it might be worth saving.
EuroDisneyland's employees have done their best to deck it out in festive
finery. Ivy bells dangle from the lamp posts. Mickey and Minnie Mouse skate
across the Hotel New York ice rink. The strains of Christmas muzak are piped
all over the park. Even the barber shop quartet in the Main Street shopping
arcade has ditched its usual repertoire in favour of carols. At 5pm each day
one child is chosen to light the 20-metre Christmas tree.
The decorations alone had been enough to tempt Corinne Jillit, a public
relations executive from Angouleme in western France, to bring her
four-year-old son. 'The park looks so pretty at this time of year,' she
said. 'We'd rather come in the winter, when we don't have to queue to get on
the rides.'
Werner Muller, an engineer from Hamburg visiting with his six-year-old
twins, agreed. 'Friends who came here in August had to queue for two hours
just to get on the rides,' he said. 'At this time of year the kids don't
have to wait too long, just as well given the weather.' The cold was already
proving too much for other visitors. 'It's freezing,' said Willi Ramstein,
an Italian architect, who had come to the park during a business trip to
Paris. 'The park's great, but the weather's terrible.'
Jane Pritchard from south Wales said: 'You'd think they'd sell warm hats in
this weather.' Her companion added: 'Never mind, we'll go to the Florida
park next time.' 'It's sunny there.'
The souvenir shops were packed with festive memorabilia - a Winnie the Pooh
Christmas stocking for FFr125, a Mickey Mouse Santa hat for FFr30 and a
Goofy bauble for FFr29 - but no woolly hats.
As for Mrs Ross, her mission had only just started. But on her first
impressions, she seemed to agree with the other shivering visitors. 'They
should have built this place somewhere warmer.'

   A tearful Joan Rivers reached the end of a long
road back when she stepped forward to accept her first Emmy Award.
   ``Two years ago I couldn't get a job in this business ... people
said I wouldn't work again,'' she told the audience at Thursday's
17th annual Daytime Emmy Awards, recalling how Fox Broadcasting
dropped her late-night talk show.
   Rivers won the Emmy for best daytime talk show host for her
syndicated ``The Joan Rivers Show.'' She wept when she alluded to
the suicide of her husband, producer Edgar Rosenberg, in 1987.
   ``It's so sad that he's not here because he ... always said,
`You can turn things around,''' she said. ``I'm so sorry he's not
here.''
   NBC won four Emmys for its soap opera ``Santa Barbara,''
including best directing team and, for the second consecutive year,
outstanding dramatic series.
   A Martinez, who plays Cruz Castillo on the show, won the best
actor Emmy, and Henry Darrow, who plays his father, Rafael, won as
best supporting actor.
   Susan Lucci, nominated for best actress a record 11 times as the
bad-tempered Erica Kane of ABC's ``All My Children,'' came up a
loser for the 11th time.
   That Emmy went to Kim Zimmer, the Reva Shayne Lewis of CBS'
``Guiding Light'' who told the audience she's leaving the show. ``I
will be back some day,'' she said, without elaborating. The show
also won for best writing.
   Julia Barr, who plays Brooke English on ``All My Children,'' won
for best supporting actress.
   In the juvenile performers category, Cady McClain won best
actress for her role as Dixie Martin on ``All My Children'' and
Andrew Kavovit won outstanding young actor as Paul Stenback on
``All My Children.''
   Alex Trebeck of the syndicated ``Jeopardy!'' won the best game
show host Emmy for the second consecutive year, but shared the
honor with Bob Barker of ``The Price Is Right.'' ``Jeopardy!'' also
won the game show Emmy.
   PBS' ``Reading Rainbow'' won for best children's series, and a
CBS ``Schoolbreak Special'' titled ``A Matter of Conscience'' won
as best children's special.
   Two ABC shows, ``Beetlejuice'' and ``The New Adventures of
Winnie the Pooh,'' shared the Emmy for best animated program.
   A lifetime achievement Emmy went to game show producer Mark
Goodson, 75, whose shows include ``What's My Line,'' ``To Tell the
Truth,'' ``The Match Game'' and ``The Price is Right.''
   ``The Sally Jessy Raphael Show,'' a competitor of Rivers' show,
won the Emmy for best daytime talk show. Raphael, who won last
year's Emmy for best talk show host, was asked whether she would
ever run out of topics.
   ``When the world runs out of love stories and people run out of
their need for each other, we'll run out of topics,'' Raphael said.
   Rivers, who dedicated her Emmy to her late husband, had regained
her high spirits when she spoke later to reporters about her image
on the troubled Fox show and her new daytime environment.
   ``On the Fox Show, where I was being careful because they said
`Be careful,'' people said, `What happened to the old, outrageous
Joan?'
   ``Then I went on, I did something at the beginning of our show,
they said, `Why she's outrageous! Whatever happened to that
wonderful warm, gentle Joan?'
   ``So whatever I do is wrong. So do what you want to do: And
those that like it like you, those that don't, don't.''
   ``Daytime is a tough nut to crack and we came in with tremendous
amount of people telling us, `You can't break in, there's no more
room,''' she said. ``I'm thrilled that they found room for me.''
   The ceremonies were jointly presented by the Los Angeles-based
Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences and the New York-based
National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences.
   The prime-time Emmy nominees are to be announced Aug. 2 in Los
Angeles, and the prime-time awards show is scheduled to air Sept.
16 from Los Angeles by Fox Broadcasting Co.

   A European subsidiary of Time Inc. Monday
announced the purchase of Books for Children, a large British book
club, from Independent Television Publications.
   The price paid for the acquisition by Time-Life Books (Europe)
Inc. was not disclosed.
   In an announcement released in London and made available in New
York, Books for Children was described as Britain's largest quality
hardback book club for children from pre-school age to early teens.
   Its monthly catalogue includes books about such famous characters
as ``Winnie the Pooh'' and ``Thomas the Tank Engine.'' The club is
known for its policy of introducing new, imaginative authors and
illustrators and it sponsors the annual Mother Goose Award for the
most exciting newcomer to British children's book illustration.
   Joe Ward, president and chief executive officer of Time-Life
Books (Europe), said the acquisition is part of the company's
strategy of international expansion and the development of a
significant children's publishing capacity.
   ``We have been interested in obtaining Books for Children for
some time because it is a natural fit for our own plans to grow in
the children's market,'' said Ward.
   Independent Television Publications, owned by 15 independent
television companies in Britain, acts as the magazine publishing arm
of independent television. Its main publication is TV Times,
Britain's second largest selling magazine.

   A Mother's Lifetime of Secrets Revealed

   In a recent essay, Amy Tan described the acute anxiety she
experienced while working on "The Kitchen God's Wife," her
second novel. A phantom audience of fans and critics looking
over her shoulder, she said, caused a pain in her neck that
later spread to her jaw, resulting in "two cracked teeth and,
finally, a huge dental bill." It didn't help, when, at Ms.
Tan's first literary luncheon, a woman said to her
innocently, "How does it feel to have written your best book
first?"
   That book was the hugely successful "The Joy Luck Club,"
and it was indeed a tough act to follow. If, in the
inflationary world of book publishing, Ms. Tan's debut at
times seemed overpraised -- adjectives like "mesmerizing,"
"brilliant" and "powerful" were plastered all over the
original paperback edition -- the intelligence and clarity of
her voice were astonishing. The novel, composed of delicately
realized vignettes about four first-generation
Chinese-American mothers and their daughters, was clearly the
work of a mature talent.

<TEXT>
   "The Kitchen God's Wife" (Putnam's, 415 pages, $22.95)
also begins with a Chinese-American mother, Winnie, and her
thoroughly American, 40-something daughter, Pearl. Again,
readers can dreamily re-enter a world where every
conversation has a coded meaning, where household objects are
animated by their own rebellious spirits, and where nothing
is an accident ("she's like a Chinese version of Freud," says
Pearl of Winnie). And the new book shares certain leitmotifs
with its predecessor: Loyalty, destiny and luck -- good and
bad -- are once again legacies to be passed on to a younger
generation that often doesn't understand, or want, its
inheritance.
   But where "The Joy Luck Club" was a group portrait, "The
Kitchen God's Wife" above all tells the story of how Winnie
was once Weiwei, the most richly imagined character Ms. Tan
has yet created. The story -- which describes a brutal first
marriage set against turbulent times -- is closely based on
her mother's life in China before, during and after World War
II, and the wartime scenes, especially, have the force of a
compelling oral history. But this is fundamentally a novel:
Its power lies in the author's impressive ability to create a
world.
   One of the sharpest tools at this writer's command is her
ear for dialogue. In almost adversarial, semi-concealing
fashion, conversations arrive at their destinations by
circular paths, everyone present taking something different
from what was said.
   "Whenever my mother talks to me, she begins the
conversation as if we were already in the middle of an
argument," the novel opens. "`Pearl-ah, have to go, no
choice,' my mother said when she phoned last week" -- and so
Pearl is invited to attend, with her husband and two
daughters, her cousin Bao-Bao's engagement party in San
Francisco. In short order, we are introduced to Auntie Helen,
whose first husband, back in China, was Winnie's brother; he
died long before Pearl was born. Only, none of this turns out
to be true. Winnie and Auntie Helen (really Hulan) aren't
even related, but are instead "joined by debts" half a
century old, sworn promises that stretch back to Shanghai in
the '30s, during the time Japan invaded China.
   "I have kept her secrets. She has kept mine," Winnie tells
Pearl. "So you can imagine my anger when Helen told me in her
kitchen . . . that she has decided to let all my secrets
out." Winnie decides she must beat Helen to it, and the
substance of this book is her long, extraordinarily
compelling confession to Pearl the unseen, all-important
listener.
   Winnie lays her life out in gorgeous, raw detail, a
succession of characters -- many of whom, like Helen, grow in
depth and complexity as the book progresses -- and images: a
bolt of peach fabric for a dress that was never made, bombs
"the shape of fish . . . dropping, wobbling" overhead in
wartime, an idyllic mountaintop village called Heaven's
Breath.
   The secret that lies at the heart of Winnie's past is that
she has been married before and that her first husband, a
larger-than-life villain named Wen Fu, is almost certainly
Pearl's father -- not the Chinese-American serviceman who
Winnie joined in California after escaping from China in
1949. While living through war with the Japanese, nightly
rape by her husband, the pillage of her father's property by
Wen Fu's relatives, the rise of the Communist Party in China,
Winnie's talismans are luck, hope and "no regrets." The
"Kitchen God's Wife" of the title, also betrayed in legend by
a villainous husband, is frequently invoked: "Nobody
worshipped her either."
   This novel isn't flawless. The epic struggles at the
story's center are more compelling than Pearl's narration,
which frames the whole and gives it a feeling of unbalance.
Still, after all Winnie's scolding and railing, she does
achieve a kind of beatific resignation, with her hopes
lifting "higher and higher." One sign of this is the statue
she gives Pearl, an image of a new lucky goddess, Lady
Sorrowfree: the ex-Mrs. Kitchen God, divorced.
