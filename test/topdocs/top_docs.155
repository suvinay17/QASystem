The Northern Ireland peace process could have a knock-on effect on Spain's
Basque Country where regional elections on Sunday are widely viewed as
setting the stage for similar negotiations to end violence by Eta, the
separatist organisation.
The vote among the 2.1m Basques, who since 1979 have enjoyed increasing home
rule, is also seen as a watershed poll that could undermine the nationalist
rhetoric and extremist calls for secession from Spain that has dominated
much of local politics.
Opinion polls indicate that the Partido Nacionalista Vasco, PNV, the
mainstream nationalist party, will remain the dominant force but that there
will be big gains by Madrid-based parties - the conservative People's party
(PP) and the communist coalition, Izquierda Unida (IU) - which had formerly
been on the sidelines of Basque politics.
'I believe that once the elections are over,' says Jon Idigoras, a veteran
leader of Herri Batasuna (HB), the radical Basque group that acts as Eta's
political front organisation, 'there will be contacts with Eta and any one
of us in HB can play the role of Gerry Adams (the leader of Ireland's Sinn
Fein who was at the centre of the IRA's ceasefire).' Founded in the late
1960s, Eta has been responsible for more than 600 deaths in its campaign to
create an independent Basque state and some 500 of its members are in
Spanish and French prisons.
'We have still got to digest the Irish developments,' says Mr Idigoras, 'but
it is clear that they will force every-one, the Spanish government, the
Basque political parties and Eta to move their pawns.'
The sentiment is echoed by the PNV's Mr Jose Antonio Ardanza, who is certain
to be returned as Basque prime minister on Sunday.
Mr Ardanza has said during the electoral meetings that he favours 'discreet
and, if possible, secret' talks with Eta.
Mr Xabier Arzalluz, the powerful chairman of the PNV and its leading
ideologue for the past 20 years, says he expects a 'deep rethink' by HB
after Sunday's vote, particularly if the opinion polls are borne out and the
radicals, which are at present the third-largest political group in the
Basque Country after the PNV and the Socialists, lose votes.
Although there are important differences between the politics of Northern
Ireland and those of the Basque Country, Mr Arzalluz says HB's supporters
have been 'stunned by the IRA's decision to give up violence, apparently in
return for nothing'.
The momentum towards a Basque peace process will, however, depend on the
willingness of the Socialist government in Madrid to sanction the talks that
the PNV has in mind.
While the Madrid government officially opposes contacts with Eta, Mr Mario
Onaindia, a former Eta member and now a leading Socialist party official in
the Basque Country, says circumstances after the election will favour 'a
dialogue'.
Sunday's vote is, however, expected to see a decline in support for the
Socialist party which has been the junior partner in the Basque Country's
government for the past eight years. The shrinking Socialist vote is partly
prompted by the diminished popularity of Mr Felipe Gonzalez's government in
Madrid, but it could also reflect dissatisfaction among rank-and-file
socialists, mostly blue-collar migrant workers from elsewhere in Spain, over
the local party's decision to co-opt a minority left-wing group led by Mr
Onaindia and to compete for the 'ethnic' Basque vote.
Polls suggest that the IU coalition could be backed on Sunday by former
socialist supporters and, underlining a further shift from nationalist-based
politics, that the conservative PP will do well among young professionals.
'People are at last waking up,' says Mr Jaime Mayor Oreja, the leader of the
PP in the Basque Country.
'The permanent vindication of the Basque nation over the past years has only
created uncertainties and impoverished the Basque Country,' he says.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Condemnation of Speech by Arzalluz, </F>
Who Is Accused of Isolating Basque Country"] 
  [Excerpt] Bilbao -- Several political leaders yesterday 
harshly criticized the remarks of PNV [Basque Nationalist Party] 
Chairman Xabier Arzalluz, who referred on Aberri Eguna [Basque 
fatherland day] to those who "talk a great deal about ETA 
[Basque Homeland and Liberty], when they have headings and 
articles in their Constitution, designed for Reds and 
separatists, in which they entrust their fatherland's unity to 
the Army, weapons, and violence." The leaders of the nationwide 
parties in the Basque Country accused Arzalluz of isolating the 
Basque Country through his radicalism, which, in the opinion of 
both the PSE [Basque Socialist Party] and the People's Party of 
the Basque Country, stems from the proximity of the Basque 
autonomous community elections. 
  The harshest criticisms yesterday came from the Basque 
Socialists, of whom Aznar said a few days ago that they are not 
Basques. Nicolas Redondo Terreros, secretary general of the PSE 
of Vizcaya, said that Arzalluz' remarks are "intolerable" and 
show "separatism," although he specified that the problem is not 
between the Basque Country and the rest of Spain "but among the 
Basques themselves, because there are many of us Basques who do 
not share Mr. Arzalluz' idea of the Basque Country and Spain at 
all." 
  PSE Deputy Secretary General Jose Luis Marcos Merino also 
criticized the remarks by Arzalluz, whom he called a "crank," 
and said that his remarks are "nonsense" and have no 
justification, because "to compare ETA with the Army and Article 
8 of the Constitution is an act of total cynicism and a lie." 
Marcos Merino added that "so many foolish remarks and in such 
close succession are inexplicable, unless the PNV leaders are 
suffering from delirium and hallucinations." 
  In Marcos Merino's opinion, Arzalluz' statements do not help 
the Basque Country to surmount the economic crisis which it is 
suffering, "but isolate us increasingly." 
  Jaime Mayor Oreja, chairman of the People's Party in the 
Basque Country, spoke in similar terms, accusing the PNV 
chairman of isolating the Basque Country through statements such 
as these, "which are the best demonstration of a political 
fiction which has been so damaging and counterproductive for the 
Basque Country." In Mayor Oreja's opinion, "those statements do 
not further the quest to resolve the Basque Country's real 
problems, and are a political fiction." 
<H5>  Regain Prominence </H5>
  In the opinion of the People's Party of the Basque Country, 
what the PNV leaders are seeking through statements such as 
their chairman's is to "regain prominence and increase the 
political justification of the nationalist parties and, more 
specifically, of the PNV," in view of the elections' proximity. 
In Mayor Oreja's opinion, what Arzalluz is attempting to this 
end is to "divide deeply the Basque people" and "cause a scandal 
and reaction throughout Spain through radicalism," although he 
said that the questioning of the Army's role in the defense of 
Spain's unity did not surprise them. 
  On relations between the People's Party and the PNV 
following 
the meeting with Arzalluz, he said that "meeting points must 
always be explored within the substantial and very considerable 
differences," and added that "there is no possibility of 
agreement" on these matters. [passage omitted]

FT  05 MAR 92 / A better road to freedom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month, Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (ETA), passed something of a milestone.
Nearly 23 years after beginning a terrorist war to 'free' the Basque country
from Spain, it killed its 700th Spaniard in Madrid.
ETA has killed 271 civilians, 26 of whom have been children or teenagers.
This year alone, its bombers and pistoleros have killed 15 people, in an
accelerating attempt to frighten the Spanish government into negotiating to
ensure calm for this year's festivities: the Olympics in Barcelona and the
Universal Exposition in Seville.
Sensibly, the government has done no such thing, though it is always alert
to any cracks it might exploit in the wall of separatist fanaticism it finds
among ETA prisoners, the operating leadership which hides in France, and the
spread of support organisations in the Basque country, including the
political party, Herri Batasuna.
Occasionally, a senior Herri Batasuna figure will peel off from the fight;
sometimes a prisoner decides to leave the cause and is 're-inserted' into
society. Dozens of ETA leaders are being picked up in France and Spain.
But the killing continues and Herri Batasuna has a firm hold on 15 per cent
of the Basque vote. For any Spanish government, it must be a tiring
struggle.
It has been perhaps most depressing for Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and
his Socialist party, in power since October 1982. Many of its political and
trade union leaders, drawn from the Basque country, genuinely believed that
under enlightened liberal rule from Madrid, Basque separatist terrorism
would wither and die.
The Basque country is, probably, the most truly autonomous region in the
European Community. Its three provinces collect all their own taxes. It has
its own police force. Its obscure and difficult language is taught in
schools and universities despite the fact that fewer and fewer Basques wish
to learn it. Central government subsidies have kept alive the region's
dilapidated steel and en-gineering industries.
In Spain, Basques control some of the land's biggest business and banking
empires. The Basque country itself is a glorious place. Its chefs are
probably the best in Europe. San Sebastian, its second city, is one of the
most beautiful. Its alpine countryside is a breathtaking relief from the
arid meseta at the centre of Spain.
It is easy to understand why Basques love their country. They all do, and
they are almost all nationalists. But a small and determined group continues
to kill and maim for it.
Few countries would have been able to respond to this violence with the
maturity shown by Spain. It quite reasonably considers the Basque country to
be an integral part of its territory and has refused to bend to the
provincial and anachronistic arguments for separation that draw - as do most
such causes - on dreams of recreating history before the birth of modern
nation states.
Madrid does not expect anyone else to fight its battle for the hearts and
minds of the Basques, but somehow the issue needs to be broadened. ETA's war
is not of much concern to the rest of the world, but it remains a serious
threat - probably the only threat - to a liberal and respected democracy.
Somehow, ETA's supporters need to know that violence will not be rewarded
and that violent separation from Spain means exclusion from the political
and economic communities Spain already belongs to.
Members of ETA are highly motivated and well-organised. They draw morale and
political sustenance from the Basque public that regularly votes for Herri
Batasuna. It is time Spain's friends and neighbours began to speak to those
voters before the Basque country becomes a European problem closer to the
heart of the continent than Northern Ireland.
This does not excuse Madrid from doing everything possible to find its own
political solution. But the narrow Basque gaze needs to be shifted from
Madrid to the wider European stage.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Arzalluz Calls For Independent Basque </F>
Country"] 
  [Excerpt] Madrid -- PNV [Basque Nationalist Party] Chairman 
Xabier Arzalluz stated yesterday that he wants independence for 
the Basque Country, although he does "not expect to see it." 
  In statements made to the Spanish Radio Broadcasting Company 
network, the PNV's top leader said that the Basque people could 
win this independence if they wished, "but I am a Basque 
nationalist, and there are people here -- in the Basque Country 
-- who are not nationalists, and what I believe is that what we 
win should be won by a clear majority." 
  Arzalluz showed himself in favor of a "Basque state within 
Europe," although he admitted that this is impossible right now, 
because there is the Army, which guarantees "that there will be 
no dismemberment of what is called national territory." 
  He referred to Article 8 of the Constitution, which assigns 
to the Armed Forces the task of guaranteeing Spain's sovereignty 
and independence and defending its territorial integrity and 
constitutional order, maintaining that it "is unpresentable." 
  In his opinion, the reactions to his speech on Aberri Eguna 
[Basque Fatherland Day] last Sunday, in which he criticized this 
article and described Spain's unity as "a story," are due not to 
a misinterpretation but to a manipulation, and added that the 
Basque people "have no chance of deciding freely." 
<H5>  Resignation </H5>
  Xabier Arzalluz said that civil governor of Vizcaya Daniel 
Arranz should resign for linking his Aberri Eguna statements 
with Monday's attack, and stated that following the things that 
were said, there was a need for a clarification by Interior 
Minister Antoni Asuncion along the lines of the one made 
Tuesday, which dissociated Arzalluz and the PNV from the 
strategy of Basque Homeland and Liberty. 
  "Asuncion is an intelligent man and knows what is at issue, 
but 24 hours elapsed before Asuncion spoke, and very grave 
things were said here, and the matter of Article 8 of the 
Constitution is the least of it," he said. 
  The nationalist leader said that the harsh reaction by the 
PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] to his Aberri Eguna 
speech did not surprise him, and added that Ramon Jauregui and 
Mario Onaindia began the argument with its partners in the 
Basque government. 
  "We are now arguing with the PSOE, but the grave argument 
was 
begun systematically by Mr. Jauregui, backed by Mr. Onaindia; it 
is they who have led us to this situation." 
  In this connection, he added that Ramon Jauregui, 
"accompanied by Mr. Onaindia, is the man who is stirring up 
many things here because of his obsession with the elections." 
He also criticized the Basque Socialists for acting in 
accordance with Madrid's instructions. "What they do comes by 
fax from Madrid. They govern from there to here," he said. 
  The PNV chairman stated that the Socialists have already 
begun the Basque election campaign, and forecast that there will 
be no major changes: "It can be taken as an article of faith," 
he stated, "that the PNV will rise, Jauregui -- the Basque 
Socialists' secretary general -- will fall, and the People's 
Party will rise." 
  He acknowledged that the future Basque government was not 
discussed during his recent meeting with People's Party Chairman 
Jose Maria Aznar. 
  "If the government partner here -- the PSOE -- is presuming 
that it can talk with everybody," he said, "and holds talks with 
Eusko Alkartasuna [Basque Solidarity] or with Mayor Oreja -- 
leader of the People's Party in the Basque Country -- which are 
overt, moreover, saying that there can be many formulas, and 
covertly even with Herri Batasuna [People's Unity Party], you 
will understand that we also feel free to talk openly with 
anybody." [passage omitted]

FT  24 NOV 93 / Survey of the Basque Country (3): Suspicion-fraught alliance
 -Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Basque Country needs restful political consensus and then a restorative
sense of common political purpose like an all-night reveller needs 12 hours
sleep and a strong pick-me-up. Unfortunately it has neither such balms.
Politics in the Basque Country are criss-crossed by demarcation lines that
have historically fractured the area's political framework and created a
plethora of tribal groupings. Superimposed on the classic division between
left and right is the confrontation between the nationalists and the
non-nationalists.
The nationalist camp itself is divided between those who support violence
and those who oppose it and the latter are themselves split between those
who settle for home-rule autonomy and those whose final aim is independence.
The area's two main political parties, the Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV),
and Partido Socialista de Euskadi (PSE), the Basque subsidiary of prime
minister Felipe Gonzalez's ruling socialist party in Madrid, share just
under 50 per cent of the Basque vote between them and form a PNV-led
coalition government in which mutual suspicions abound.
Were the PNV and the PSE marriage partners, each would sue the other for
divorce on the grounds of mental cruelty for they could hardly be less
suited as a couple. The PNV is nationalist, sentimentally rural,
conservative and Roman Catholic; the PSE derides ethnic politics, prides
itself on its trade union origins in Bilbao's industrial belt and styles
itself as modern, progressive and emphatically secular.
Mr Ramon Jauregui, the Basque socialist leader, admits that 'a certain
amount of expectation' envelops the local political scene. When, in Madrid
recently, Mr Gonzalez opened talks with the main national opposition party,
the centre-right Partido Popular (PP), the PNV behaved as if it were a
scorned bride. Do the socialists think, asked the nationalist leader Mr
Xavier Arzallus, that the PNV is 'a concubine who can be trifled with?'
The PNV, which holds 10 portfolios in the 16-member Basque government
including that of chief executive, is to a great extent in a quandary of its
own making. It was invited by Mr Gonzalez to join the national government in
Madrid as a junior coalition partner after the general elections last June
left the prime minister short of an absolute majority. But it rejected the
invitation and now it appears to wish it had not done so.
Somewhere between the invitation and its rejection, the PNV seemed to have
peered over its nationalist shoulder and lost its nerve; the very idea of
propping up a Madrid government filled it with dread. It was fearful of
losing its nationalist credentials to the radical Herri Batasuna (HB), the
coalition which supports Eta and, more plausibly, of handing over votes to
Euska Alkartasuna (EA), a minority party lead by former, and more
uncompromisingly nationalist, PNV members.
The PNV's hesitancy had a lot to do with the staging of local Basque
elections which are due in October next year. Unlike the PSE, which appeals
basically to non-nationalists, Mr Arzallus' PNV has to contend with splinter
groups such as EA and with solid formations, such as HB - the third-biggest
political party in the Basque Country - that dispute the strictly
nationalist constituency.
Negotiations to join Mr Gonzalez's government broke down when the PNV tabled
a long agenda - the final list totalled 54 separate chapters - of home rule
prerogatives that it demanded be urgently transferred from the Madrid
administration to the Basque government. That was the price that the
nationalists set for co-operation with Madrid and Mr Gonzalez judged it far
too expensive.
Certain PNV home rule demands - which deal, for example, with jurisdiction
over vocational training - can be granted immediately, because the Basque
government already runs its own education department. Others, including
transfer to the Basque Country of responsibility for health and social
security and for unemployment benefits, involve costly and complex
administrative adjustments.
A third chapter of devolutionary demands that seek to establish local
control over airports and harbours in the Basque Country fall into a grey
area in which it is not constitutionally clear where the prerogatives of
Madrid end and those of the autonomous governments begin.
A final shot of self-rule ambitions came in the form of a demand for a
Basque central bank, a monetary institution that would supervise and
regulate the local financial sector and which would clearly undermine the
responsibilities of the Bank of Spain. The adamant opposition of the PSE to
this pretension has further soured the relationship between the coalition
partners.
In the delicate negotiating process that followed the June 6 general
elections and which led to the ultimate formation of a minority government
by Mr Gonzalez, the PNV played for high stakes and it lost. Now it is in the
uncomfortable position of being stuck with the socialists in the autonomous
Basque government and being unable to play any meaningful role in the
socialist-run central government.
for the mainstream Basque nationalists because the Catalan nationalists, who
are the PNV's clone party on the periphery of Spanish politics, proved
themselves infinitely better negotiators. The Catalans also rejected
overtures to join Mr Gonzalez's government but they have cunningly supported
the Madrid government's draft budget, influenced much of the blueprint's
proposals and, as a result, ensured fiscal benefits for their Catalonia
stamping ground.
The PNV's obduracy earns it a bad press in Madrid whereas the suave Catalan
practise of the art of the possible is hailed as statesmanlike. The problems
facing Mr Arzallus' PNV are not, however, at all easy.
The Basque Country's mainstream nationalists do not have the ascendancy in
their home base that their Catalan counterparts enjoy and, unlike Catalonia,
the Basque Country has a federal-type administration in which power is
shared between the Basque government and the county councils of the three
provinces that make up the Basque Autonomous Community.
Consensus politics has never been the PNV's strong point but its
brinkmanship tactics have failed and its options are now running out.
Concessions have to take the place of confrontations and the wintery
realities of economic recession should cool nationalist ardours and shelve
devolution agendas for the time being.
The likelihood is that elections next year to the 75-member Basque
parliament will once more return the PNV and the PSE as the main parties but
will again leave the two of them well short of a majority, thus forcing them
into a renewed coalition. What the Basque Country cannot risk is a
continuation of the present suspicion-fraught alliance.

<F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Arzalluz Asserts That Constitution </F>
Enshrines Unity Through Violence"] 
  [Excerpt] San Sebastian -- Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) 
Chairman Xabier Arzalluz stated in a speech delivered during the 
Aberri Eguna [Basque Fatherland Day] celebrations that his party 
will not confine its political demands to the autonomy statute, 
that the PNV claims sovereignty for all the Basque territories, 
and that the Basque Country will "gradually" achieve a 
"cultural, economic, and ultimately political unity in Europe," 
as well as asserting that the Constitution entrusts the defense 
of Spain's unity to the Army and violence. 
  The PNV, as it has done for the past few years, organized 
two 
different political meetings on the occasion of Aberri Eguna -- 
one in Guipuzcoa in the morning and the second in Bilbao in the 
afternoon. Lehendakari [Basque premier] Jose Antonio Ardanza, 
PNV spokesman Joseba Egibar, and candidate in the European 
elections Josu Jon Imaz spoke at the first meeting, in Azpeitia. 
Aberri Eguna was held this year under the watchword "Let's 
improve the Basque Country." 
<H5>  Ability To Decide </H5>
  In statements made both before the political meeting and 
during his speech before PNV members, the PNV leader was highly 
critical of the Socialists. "Since the agreements in Madrid 
began, they have forgotten everything; they have forgotten the 
right of self-determination. They have never been Basque 
nationalists. The ministers, such as Mr. Eguiagaray, speak of 
the nation's government. Clearly, they believe in another 
nation, in another fatherland." 
  Arzalluz stated that the PNV "wants the Basque people to 
have 
the ability to determine their destiny: If they want it to be 
with Spain, then with Spain; if they want it to be with Europe, 
then with Europe; and if they want it to be on their own, then 
on their own," because "a nation that wishes to hold people down 
through coercion will be not a nation but a prison." "Let them 
not come and tell us," he added "that anything can be upheld 
without violence, because then it turns out that when we uphold 
something that comes from our own freedom, everybody attacks 
us." The PNV leader added that the PNV does not have recourse 
to violence: "We simply demand our right to think, to feel, and 
to secure democratically everything that we see fit." 
  Xabier Arzalluz stated that the political activity of the 
PNV, which claims sovereignty for all the Basque territories, is 
not confined to the statute. "While the statute is important, 
we will not stop there," he stated. "They talk a great deal 
about ETA [Basque Homeland and Liberty], they have Article 8 of 
the Constitution, specifically designed for reds and 
separatists, in which they entrust the unity of the fatherland, 
of their idea of a territorial fatherland, to the Army, weapons, 
and violence." According to Arzalluz, when the PNV upholds "what 
comes from what we want and our own freedom, everybody attacks 
us, because they have another fatherland." [passage omitted]

   A coalition of Basque nationalists and

appeared headed for another term, based on early returns from
regional elections Sunday.
   There were no reports of violence, in contrast to three previous
Basque regional elections since the region was given home rule in
1980.
   An exit poll made public by Spanish National Radio and
Television immediately after the polls closed at 8 p.m. gave the
Basque Nationalist Party about 25 percent of the vote, making it
the strongest single political group.
   Based on that popular vote, the Nationalists would gain 21 to 24
seats in the 75-member parliament. That would mark a big increase
over the 17 they had held since the November 1986 election.
   It appeared likely the Nationalists would form a coalition once
again with the Socialists, this time with the Nationalists as
senior partner.
   The Socialists, who run the national government, were projected
to receive 17 percent of the vote and take 15 to 18 seats, down
from the 19 they won in 1986.
   The radical Basque party Herri Batasuna, considered to be the
political arm of the terrorist group ETA, was projected to remain
the third political force in the Basque country with 17 percent of
the vote and 12 to 14 seats.
   Herri Batasuna is the only Basque party that did not subscribe
to a 1987 pact renouncing political violence.
   ETA stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque language. The
group seeks independence for the three-province region. Since 1968,
its attacks have claimed more than 600 lives, including 15 this
year.
   The turnout among the region's 1.7 million eligible voters was
estimated at 54 percent, the lowest in the Basque country since
Spain returned to democracy in 1977.
   Two other nationalist parties, the center-left Eusko
Alkartasuna, and the leftist Euskadiko Ezkerra, were projected to
win 11 and 10 percent of the vote respectively, slightly less than
their totals in the 1986 vote.
   The conservative Popular Party, the main opposition party in the
national parliament, increased its presence from two seats to at
least five, the projection showed.
   Unidad Alavesa, another nationalist group splintered from the
Popular Party, was projected to make its parliamentary debut with
one to three seats.
   The projection, by the Metra-6 polling agency, was based on
interviews with 20,000 voters at 85 voting stations.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Survey of the Basque Country (1): Cross-roads opportunity -
The Basque Country is at a cross-roads politically, socially and
economically. It faces the challenge of recognising its own pluralism and of
diversifying its economy - and it has the opportunity to establish an
efficient dialogue with Madrid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
The Basque Country has some of the worst slums and some of the most
unspoilt, richly forested valleys in western Europe. It embraces wholly
obsolete industrial plants and greenfield sites devoted to technological
innovation. It has been hit harder by recession than anywhere else in Spain
and yet it is the home of an energetic business community and the
headquarters of top national corporations.
Politically, the Basque Country suggests just as many contrasts and
contradictions as it does socially and economically. It is governed by a
coalition formed by two rival parties who have agreed on a joint programme.
The partnership is, nevertheless, an uneasy one and the political climate
swings from confrontation to consensus with extraordinary ease.
Broadly speaking, the Basques are wholly integrated because they are
legendary 'joiners'; they group together in a myriad institutions, from
sporting clubs to dining societies and associations of mushroom pickers. But
terrorist violence has cast a long shadow over Basque society and deeply
divides it.
Out of a population of just over 2m, some 500 members of the Basque
separatist organisation Eta are presently in prison. Probably twice as many
associates of the terrorist organisation live abroad, and the number of
Basques who over the years have been detained or jailed in connection with
terrorism must run into five figures.
Everybody in the Basque Country has first-hand knowledge of Eta; many live
in threat of its racketeering. While there is a fearful, silent majority,
increasing numbers are speaking out against the terrorists.
Many Basques support Eta's violent struggle for independence, however. Herri
Batasuna, (People's Unity), the radical coalition which backs the gunmen,
gained 174,000 votes in June's general elections; some 50,000 more than in
the 1989 poll, although its share of the total vote slipped from 17 per cent
to 15 per cent. Political stability in the Basque Country ultimately depends
on a negotiated solution to the Eta problem.
Politically, socially and economically the Basque Country is at a
cross-roads. Obsessively rooted in its Basque identity, an exclusive, ethnic
identity in its more extreme manifestations, and excessively dependent on
its steel-manufacturing sector, it now faces the challenge of recognising
its own pluralism and of diversifying its economy.
The deep love and respect for the Basque Country's special nature; for its
language, its culture and its traditions, which so many in the area share,
should not become a tribal battle call to arms that sets off one section of
the community against the other.
Blessed with excellent communications, the best cuisine in Spain and, in San
Sebastian, arguably the finest seaside resort city in Europe, the Basque
Country has much to gain from opening itself out to others, not least to
foreign tourists.
With its industrial tradition and its highly-skilled labour force, the area
has even more to gain from outside investment - investment that at the turn
of the century formed the core of the Basque Country's industrial muscle.
But there will be no meaningful foreign takers for the local opportunities
while the often irascible and sometimes violent Basque nationalist climate
persists.
The Basque Country's arrival at a cross-roads is timely in as much as Spain
itself, on the political and economic level, faces a watershed of its own.
The general elections last June left Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister,
short of an overall majority and his minority government has been forced to
seek alliances with nationalist parties, notably with the Basques.
The economic recession has, meanwhile, prompted the government into
overhauling the labour market rigidities that have in no small way
contributed to the decreasing competitiveness of Basque industry
The twin issues of a new political arrangement, involving a form of
cohabitation with the nationalists, and of deregulation, involving a loss of
trade union power, can - if they are properly addressed - help the Basque
Country a great deal as it seeks a sure route towards recovery.
Initial negotiations between the Basque Nationalist Party, which leads the
Basque government, and Mr Gonzalez's socialists in the Madrid central
government have not been encouraging. The Basques played too strong a hand
as they hurriedly sought to extract home rule prerogatives in return for
supporting Mr Gonzalez, and they were turned down.
Despite the early misunderstandings and the ill-tempered exchanges that
accompanied them, the talks have not been broken off. Mr Gonzalez is still
seeking a stable pact - ideally with nationalists, both Basque and Catalans,
in his cabinet - that will ensure the survival of his government.
There are, therefore, grounds to expect that home-rule wrinkles will be
ironed out, and with them the aggrieved and irritable rhetoric which has
traditionally characterised the mainstream Basque nationalists.
A spell as junior partners in a Madrid coalition government will certainly
help the Basque Nationalist Party to shake off its narrow localism. It
should also aid Spaniards to lose the suspicions they harbour about the
Basques as a whole as a consequence of Eta terrorism.
The planned overhaul of labour market rigidities by the Madrid government
meanwhile appears tailor-made for the Basque Country's recession-hit
industry. With its numerous small plants, employing up to 25 workers, the
Basque Country urgently needs flexible labour practices that allow for
functional mobility and labour force adjustments.
Current legislation, which applies to the Basque Country as it does
everywhere else in Spain, is weighted towards fixed employment and makes
dismissals costly. This legislation has been arguably the most important
factor in deterring investment, in raising unit labour costs and, in the
final analysis, fuelling the rise of joblessness in Spain.
Unemployment levels in the Basque Country are higher than the national
average.
The Basque government should also be able to use the lead given by Madrid
with its decision to impose wage restraint and, in particular, to freeze
public sector salaries next year in order to reduce the spiralling public
deficit.
In one of the least satisfactory aspects of autonomous governments in
action, civil servants in the Basque government, including teachers and
members of the Basque security forces, earn far higher salaries than do
their Madrid central administration counter-parts.
ELA-STV, the Basque trade union which wields strong power in the white
collar sector, is sticking out for exactly what the Basque economy does not
need: 6 per cent wage rises, more public sector jobs and shorter working
hours.
At present the Basque Country cannot afford the luxury of inflationary union
deals any more than it can waste time on the finer points of home rule
prerogatives.
It must take the route which establishes an efficient dialogue with Madrid.
That will help restore competitiveness to its economy and in so doing solve
the tension-ridden contradictions of its community.

<F P=106> [Cristina de la Hoz report: "Aznar and Arzalluz Unblock </F>
Their Relations and Establish a Line of Cooperation"] 
  [Text] [People's Party Chairman] Jose Maria Aznar and 
[Basque Nationalist Party, PNV, Chairman] Xabier Arzalluz met 
Tuesday [29 March] in order to unblock relations between their 
parties. The two leaders, who had not talked since June 1991, 
decided to establish a stable channel of communication, 
especially with respect to autonomy and economic issues and 
cooperation in the Congress [of Deputies]. The People's Party 
also acknowledges the possibility of taking part in the next 
Basque government. 
  The meeting took place at a private house midway between 
Burgos and the Basque Country, and helped break three years of 
noncommunication since the two politicians met 12 June 1991. 
Accompanied by Jaime Mayor Oreja, People's Party chairman in the 
Basque Country, and by Juan Maria Ollora of the PNV, Aznar and 
Arzalluz mainly centered their four-hour conversation on the 
economic and autonomy situations and on the need to recover a 
certain world of values, Mayor Oreja told ABC yesterday. 
  However, the main aim was to unblock a relationship which 
was 
virtually nonexistent, since, although both leaders have 
attended European People's Party meetings, they have not 
directly exchanged a word, although they have indirectly 
exchanged many mutual accusations. 
  Arzalluz expressed his concern about the implementation of 
autonomy and even handed the People's Party leader a document 
containing his party's stance on the matter, which dwelt 
especially on the single social security fund. But there was 
most agreement on the situation of "grave" economic and 
industrial crisis which Spain is experiencing, as Mayor Oreja 
explained to this newspaper, and for this reason Aznar and 
Arzalluz decided that their respective parties will continue 
their contacts after Easter Week. 
  The People's Party and the PNV are thus establishing new 
channels of communication which will also be manifested between 
the parliamentary groups in the Congress, although Mayor Oreja 
refused to speak of the existence of any common front, but 
asserted, on the other hand, the need for less rigidity in 
relations between the two parties. 
  The initiative for the meeting, the same sources added, was 
shared, and came following a conversation four weeks ago between 
the People's Party chairman in the Basque Country and 
Lehendakari [Basque premier] Jose Antonio Ardanza. 
  Emphasis was also placed on giving greater impetus to 
regeneration of the institutions. An issue which was broached 
very superficially -- "it really was discussed very little" -- 
was terrorism, perhaps in order to avoid tensions in a 
conversation which would have made clear the deep differences. 
As Mayor Oreja explained, the People's Party is opposed to ETA 
[Basque Homeland and Liberty] members' rehabilitation taking 
place through a decision of the Basque parliament. 
  The unblocking of relations between the People's Party and 
the PNV occurs against the backdrop of the holding of the next 
Basque elections in the fall. In this connection, and since all 
the parties seem to be open to any cooperation formula in order 
to form a government, the People's Party is not ruling out 
joining in that combination, and a PNV-People's Party government 
could be conjectured, at least in theory. However, Mayor Oreja 
emphasized that the People's Party's sole aim is to rise in this 
community, and described any other kind of conjecture as 
premature "until we know the results." 
  For his part, Basque premier Jose Antonio Ardanza described 
the meeting as very positive, although he would say nothing 
about possible future coalitions following the elections. He 
stated that it is his party's duty, "because of the major 
government responsibility which it has been exercising since the 
transition," to maintain relations "at both ends of the 
political spectrum."

FT  11 MAY 94 / Survey of Spain (2): The nationalists are the powerbrokers -
One political cycle may have ended. But when will the next begin?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jose Maria Aznar, the leader of the opposition, says that the general
elections last June marked the end of a political cycle and the start of a
new one. He implies that the day when he will take power as head of a
centre-right Partido Popular (PP) government is at hand.
The first assertion is indisputably true, for last year's vote ended the
overall parliamentary majority that Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Socialist prime
minister, had enjoyed over three terms since 1982. But the timing of the
next cycle is open to doubt - quite apart from the inevitability of the big
swing to the PP that Mr Aznar takes for granted.
Opinion polls indicate that the PP opposition is likely to win June's
European elections and that the Socialists will suffer their first
nationwide electoral defeat in 12 years. But Mr Gonzalez, although he is
short of a parliamentary majority can in theory stagger on until 1997.
This seems to be what Mr Gonzalez wants to do. Corruption scandals have
severely dented his credibility but he is hoping that over the next two
years the economy will recover sufficiently to bring him, or his anointed
successor in the socialist party, back to power.
But even with expert corruption damage control, the prime minister can only
stagger on in theory. Mr Gonzalez does not, in fact, control the timing of
the next cycle, any more than Mr Aznar does. The powerbrokers of domestic
politics are Mr Jordi Pujol, leader of the Catalan nationalists, and to a
lesser extent Mr Javier Arzallus, the leader of the Basque nationalists.
When a hung parliament was returned after last June's elections, the 17
representatives of Catalonia's Covergencia i Unio (CiU) group in parliament
and the five members of the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) joined forces
with the 159 Socialist deputies to ensure the necessary majority in the
350-member legislature for Mr Gonzalez's investiture as prime minister for a
fourth term. After long negotiations between Mr Gonzalez's Socialists and Mr
Pujol's CiU, the Catalan nationalists subsequently voted alongside the
socialists to push the government's budget through parliament last autumn
and its labour market reform legislation in the spring.
The prime minister needs the nationalist votes to remain in power - just as
the opposition leader needs them to prevent the Socialist government serving
out its full term. A Catalan and Basque defection to Mr Aznar's 141-strong
PP camp in parliament would sooner rather than later trigger a mid-term
general election.
There is nothing intrinsically worrying about a parliament in which a
minority party, or in this case two minority parties, can make or break
governments. But the situation in the Madrid parliament is different.
Fundamentally, Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar subscribe to the same agenda. Mr
Pujol and Mr Arzallus share a different one.
The two nationalist leaders make no bones about the fact that their guiding
political principle is an ever-greater degree of home rule for Catalonia and
for the Basque country respectively. As powerbrokers, the Catalan and the
Basque nationalist parties are in an ideal position to exert the leverage
which will further their political aims.
To push through legislation, Mr Gonzalez he has often had to resign himself
to painstaking horse-trading on a case-by-case basis. As a result of the
budget negotiations, Mr Pujol obtained a measure of fiscal autonomy for the
Generalitat, the Barcelona-based Catalan government. He will certainly want
more this coming autumn (under the present arrangement the Generalitat keeps
15 per cent of the income tax raised in Catalonia) when the 1995 budget is
debated.
Meanwhile, the PNV has abstained from further support for the government and
Mr Arzallus has recently stepped up his nationalist rhetoric to emphasise
Basque separateness. This is because elections to the 75-member Basque
parliament are scheduled for October; this regional poll pits the PNV
against the Socialists, the other main party in the area.
Mr Arzallus is right to be concerned that PNV votes will be lost to Basque
radicals and to the conservative PP if his mainstream Nationalist party
continues to back the Socialist government in Madrid. Mr Pujol, who shares
the Basque leader's Christian Democrat policies, will face the same worry in
the spring of 1996, when elections to the 135-member Catalan parliament take
place, because the CiU's main rival is also the Socialist party.
The consequences of a hung parliament and of nationalist party powerbrokers
are only now beginning to be properly digested by analysts.
It is very possible that neither the socialists nor the PP, that is to say
the national parties as opposed to the nationalist parties, will in future
elections obtain the sort of commanding majority that from 1982-93 allowed
Mr Gonzalez to dictate terms to the Pujols and the Arzalluses of Spain's
political establishment.
This means that, whether they like it or not, Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar will
have to accept the inexorable drift towards federalism of Spanish politics.
It is Mr Pujol who best understands - or at least best explains - what
Spanish-style federalism could mean.
The Catalan leader will continue to press for fiscal autonomy for his
region's 6m population and he will also step up his campaign to make Catalan
the language used in the area's schools.
But his central ambition is a loosely federated Spain in which the Spanish
monarch is not King of Spain but King of 'the Spains' - reigning over a
federation of nationalities.
Mr Arzallus's authority extends over an area where nationalism has more
confrontational overtones. Radical Basques, who represent at least 15 per
cent of the area's 1.2m electorate, seek secession from Spain; they give
political respectability to the ETA organisation which has been responsible
for about 600 deaths in its 25-year-old campaign for Basque independence.
On practical issues, for example, Mr Arzallus wants Basques to have sole
prerogatives over the area's ports and airports and over social security
budgets for the elderly and the unemployed. In all, there are 54 devolution
'chapters' that the PNV has placed on the negotiating table.
But the Basque leader's ideal is to have an enlarged Basque country,
incorporating parts of south-west France and the adjoining Spanish province
of Navarre, forming a Basque nation within the European Union. A former
Jesuit and very much a realist despite his rhetoric, Mr Arzallus will settle
for sort of monarch-viceroy relationship that is championed by Mr Pujol.
Unsurprisingly, Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar discuss in private the dangers of a
drift towards a federalism and jointly exploring what they call a 'unity of
criteria' over the new framework of Spanish politics. They want to agree on
ground rules which will allow them to say 'enough is enough' to nationalist
pressure.
Neither politician relishes the prospect of Catalan or Basque parties
setting the timing of political cycles. Nor are Mr Gonzalez and Mr Aznar at
all comfortable with a leverage which allows the nationalists to pursue
their separate agendas.

FT  21 MAY 93 / Spanish Elections: Basques and Catalans plan own 'central'
banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S TWO big governing regional parties, the Basque PNV and the Catalan
CiU, have both issued a serious threat to the central authority of Madrid
before the June 6 election by announcing plans to set up public banks which
could increase the financial autonomy of the two regions.
The move, started by the Basques and quickly followed by the Catalans, is a
taste of the complex political dilemma that could confront either of Spain's
two main parties, the governing Socialists or the conservative Partido
Popular (PP), after the election.
These parties are neck-and-neck in the polls, which predict a hung
parliament in which any government would have to have the assistance of the
Basque and Catalan parties. By launching their proposals now, the Basques
and Catalans are making clear the price of such co-operation.
The PNV has said its planned public bank for the Basque country would enjoy
the same powers as the Bank of Spain in obliging Basque financial
institutions, mainly savings banks, to deposit with it a proportion of their
deposits, interest free, to meet liquidity requirements.
A draft law publish by the Basque government says the new bank, the
Euskadiko Banku Publikoa, would serve to 'obtain the maximum financial
autonomy for Euskadi' (the Basque country).
The possibility of creating a Basque central bank has been raised before and
it is believed that, ultimately, the PNV intends the new bank to be a
central bank issuing its own currency. The Basque country already has a
statute of autonomy, allowing the regional government the exclusive right to
collect and distribute taxes.
Responding to publication of the Basque draft law, the CiU leader and
Catalan premier, Mr Jordi Pujol, emerged from a cabinet meeting this week
saying: 'We must do it too.' The Catalans, who do not yet collect their own
taxes, want a public bank run by the regional government which would be used
to help fund regional government projects.
It is taken for granted, however, that the Catalans, sooner or later, would
also want this bank to take some control over Catalonia's financial sector,
and that it would also begin to set liquidity requirements for local banking
institutions.

   Police arrested 10 Spanish Basque
militants, including Jose Antonio Urutigoechea, considered by Madrid
to be a top leader of the Spanish Basque separatist organization
ETA, authorities said today.
   Spanish officials, party leaders, and newspapers applauded the
arrest of Urutigoechea, 38, also known as ``Josu Ternera.''
   Spain's leading daily, El Pais, said the arrest means ``ETA has
lost its staunchest, longest-active leader, suffering the toughest
blow.''
   ETA has carried out a 20-year campaign of violence in a bid to
secure independence from Spain for the three-province northern
Spanish Basque region. It maintains bases across the border in
French Basque country.
   In Madrid, Interior Ministry sources speaking on condition of
anonymity said the arrests represented the most important setback to
ETA since police in southwestern France arrested dozens of suspects
in raids on Sept. 30, 1987.
   Urutigoechea and the others were arrested Wednesday in the cities
of Bayonee and Bonloc in southwestern France in Poitiers in
west-central France.
   A police spokeman said on condition of anonymity that authorities
arrested Urutigoechea as he was driving a motorcyle down a towpath
along the Nive River just outside Bayonne. He did not resist, even
though he was armed with a pistol and a grenade, police said. Police
said they arrested two others at a house he had just left, six in
Poitier and one in Bonloc.
   There was no immediate word on whether criminal charges would be
filed against the 10 or whether they would be extradited to Spain.
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain told reporters, ``The
police actions and the arrests are of great importance to Spanish
society on such a major matter as the battle against terrorism.''
   Since taking up arms in 1968, ETA has claimed responsibility for
killing more than 600 people, mainly Spanish security and military
forces.
   The arrests came four days after ETA declared a 15-day suspension
of attacks in Spain as a sign of good faith to persuade the Madrid
government to open talks on the Spanish Basque region.
   Authorities in France and Spain said the arrests were carried out
through close cooperation on both sides of the border.

FT  24 NOV 93 / Survey of the Basque Country (4): Problem has become an
internal issue - Eta political violence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What sets the Basque Country apart from any other corner of the European
Union except Northern Ireland is that it has a terrorist problem.
Eta, an acronym for Euskadi Ta Askatasuna, Basque fatherland and liberty,
has been shooting, bombing and kidnapping for the better part of 25 years
and is directly responsible for more than 800 deaths.
Political violence in the Basque Country is on a lesser scale than it is in
Northern Ireland and there are no troops patrolling the streets of Bilbao in
order to keep warring terrorists, as in Belfast, apart from each other.
Basque violence is not sectarian; moderate Basques, who constitute a large
political majority, find common cause with the security services against the
radicals and the gunmen.
The qualitative difference is, however, of little comfort to those who work
and invest in the Basque Country. Businessmen employ private security guards
as a matter of course and they live in dread of an extortion racket known as
the revolutionary tax.
Political violence has deterred investment and prompted plants to close and
transfer their business out of the Basque Country.
There are two main, and interconnected, points to be made about the violence
factor:
it is on the wane although it remains lethal and will continue to exist for
the foreseeable future;
it has become an internal Basque problem as opposed to one between Madrid
and the Basque Country.
'The situation is better than it used to be and the Basque government is
making an enormous effort to give the impression that this is all being
normalised,' says Mr Jose Miguel de la Rica, president of the the business
pressure group Circulo de Empresarios Vascos. 'But then you get a murder or
a kidnap and then everything goes to the devil.'
In June, seven military officers were killed by a car bomb in Madrid and in
October two Eta gunmen shot an air force general dead outside his Madrid
home. A sure sign of Eta's continued muscle came with the release last month
of a Basque businessman who had been kidnapped in July, following the
alleged payment of a Pta300m ransom.
The violence continues despite suggestions that the police are gaining the
upper hand. In recent months revolutionary tax rings have been broken up,
gunmen arrested and arms caches seized. Although Eta is regularly reported
to be out for the count - some 500 of its members, including more than a
dozen of the group's more notorious leaders, are in prison - it appears,
time and again, to pick itself off the canvas.
'The strategy is the right one but the process is long and slow,' says Mr
Ramon Jauregui, the Basque Country's socialist leader who has a long
experience of the terrorist issue. 'We have to be very careful in order to
maintain the initiative.'
The initiative was nearly lost in September when the deaths of two Eta
suspects while in police custody served to bring underlying tensions to the
surface and prompted wide-scale rioting.
Few fault the Madrid government, the local Basque government and the police
forces of the two administrations over the way they go about their business.
The strategy involves close co-operation between them and also with the
French government and its security services. France has been acting
energetically for some years now against refugee gunmen across the Spanish
border and the one-time Eta safe havens in south-west France had been
effectively neutralised.
The prison policy is an intelligent one. Under a new strategy, Eta members
have been transferred from two maximum security jails where the hardliners
ran highly regimented communes. Thery have been dispersed among more than 20
prisons where they share cells with common criminals.
The key consequence of the dispersal policy is that jailed terrorists who
have no stomach left for the fight and are relieved of the commune pressures
are able to apply for individual pardons. 'We can only afford to give such
amnesties drop by drop,' warns Mr Jauregui.
The main reassuring feature of the strategy is that a grassroots movement is
gathering force in the Basque Country that publicly rejects Eta's violence.
That Basques are now willing to stand up and be counted reflects the
groundswell of opinion that sees continued violence as futile as well as
profoundly damaging to the local economy.
This grassroots rejection was boosted by the long kidnap endured by Mr Julio
Iglesias Zamora, whose family-owned San Sebastian engineering company had
failed to pay the gunmen's revolutionary tax. Thousands of Basques wore blue
ribbons to show their support for Eta's victim and numerous well-attended
rallies were staged to demand his release.
The protest movement was quite unprecedented but it fell short of its
objectives: Mr Iglesias Zamora was released last month only after Eta had
extracted the ransom and the police failed dismally to trap the kidnappers.
Moderate Basques feel, however, that it was not in vain.
'A short while ago nobody talked out against Eta and now they do,' said an
official in the ruling Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV). One sign of changed
times is the manner that members of Herri Batasuna (HB), Eta's political
front organisation, have been forced to stop going to a restaurant they used
to patronise near their Bilbao headquarters.
At the height of the kidnap saga and of the blue ribbon movement, the
restaurant's management decided to stop serving the radicals after other
clients began to go elsewhere. In the tight world of Basque politics, where
everybody knows everybody else, the restaurant boycott was hailed as a
victory over the tyranny of violence and the story of HB stalwarts sending
out for sandwiches is gleefully retold.
In the final analysis, Basques seem to have woken up to the fact that Eta is
their problem and that its solution lies with them. It is no longer a side
show involving headstrong members of their community and the Madrid security
forces.
The lesson is sinking in that the endemic political violence is making the
burden of recession in the Basque Country much harder to bear. Eta's
revolutionary rhetoric is out of touch with the times and its
Freedom-for-the-Basque-Country platform is at odds with the area's now
well-consolidated home rule.
Throughout the Basque Country, Madrid-based security forces are being
withdrawn and their place taken by the Ertzaina, the police force that is
recruited, trained and paid for by the local Basque government.
Increasingly, it is the Ertzaina which is leading the baton charges to break
up pro-Eta rioters and which is claiming counter-terrorist breakthroughs,
particularly on Eta's extortion racket.
Mr Juan Maria Atutxa, the Basque government minister who is responsible for
security and the chief of the Ertzaina, has taken a tough line against the
radicals. This has made him the most popular politician for the majority of
the Basque population and also the target of an HB hate campaign.
Posters and graffiti that term Mr Atutxa 'traitor' have replaced those that
used to accuse Madrid's Interior minister of 'genocide'.
In itself this is a telling development that underlines how Eta violence has
become an internal Basque issue which the Basque government is determined to
address. Mr Atutxa, who is a member of the PNV, is as Basque as it is
possible to be - he was born in a rural hamlet, spoke Euskera, the Basque
language, from birth and has been an ardent nationalist all his life.
No less indicative of the new climate is the manner in which members of Mr
Atutxa's Ertzaina who are posted to strong pro-Eta areas, particularly in
San Sebastian's Guipuzcoa province, have been known to suffer the same
hostility and pressures that the Madrid-based Civil Guard used to endure:
their car tyres are punctured, their wives are refused service by
radical-minded shopkeepers and their children are abused in the local
schools.
The polarisation of Basque society over Eta is an uncomfortable step but it
is nonetheless one in the right direction. Eta will only be curbed when its
supporters realise that they are not taking on Spaniards and Madrid but
their own neighbours in their own backyard.

<HEAD>Thousands March Against Basque Separatist Violence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILBAO, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of people marched
through this northern city in the Spanish Basque region Saturday,
demanding an end to Basque separatist violence, news reports said.
   Spanish National Radio said the crowd stretched out more than 1{
miles along the march route through the center of Bilbao.
   The independent SER network estimated the throng of marchers at
``nearly 300,000.'' Police declined to give crowd estimates.
   Representatives of the six major political parties representing
83 percent of the Basque electorate headed the demonstration,
carrying a banner reading ``Peace Now and Forever,'' calling on the
Basque separatist group ETA to lay down its arms.
   On Friday Jose Antonio Ardanza, head of the autonomous Basque
regional government, called on the Basque separatist group to extend
indefinitely a cease-fire the separatists first declared Jan. 8 and
renewed 15 days later to extend through March 26, Easter Sunday.
   ETA, an acronym for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque language,
has killed more than 600 people in its 20-year violent campaign to
secure independence for the three-province Spanish Basque country
known as Euskadi.
   ``We have come here today also to make clear our clear desire for
reconciliation,'' Ardanza said. ``We don't want a divided,
conflictive society. We don't want victors or vanquished.''
   There were no reports of incidents during the march that was
supported by organizations ranging from leftist trade unions to the
Red Cross.
   On Jan. 15, the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez resumed talks in Algeria with exiled ETA leader Eugenio
``Antxon'' Etxeveste in Algeria in an attempt to get ETA to give up
its weapons.
   It was not immediately clear what impact the march might have on
the cease-fire or the talks.
   Political observers interpreted wide support shown for the march
as a symbol of the growing public rejection of separatist terrorism
since the major Basque parties in the Basque regional parliament
signed a pact against terrorism on Jan. 19, 1988.

<TEXT>
   The government on Monday called off talks
with Basque separatists in Algeria after a series of bombings
believed to be the work of the Basque group injured two people.
   The latest injury occurred early Monday, when a mail bomb
exploded at a military training school in the Pyrenee Mountain town
of Jaca. Sgt. Joaquin Borbonado y Ruez was injured and later had
two fingers amputed, a military statement in Barcelona said.
   The attacks began after the Basque separatist group ETA last
week broke off a three-month moratorium on attacks against
government targets. It had declared the moratorium April 4 in
exchange for the talks in Algiers.
   ``The government, with the agreement of the major political
parties, has attempted to carry on a dialogue that would lead to
the elimination of violence in the Basque country and the rest of
Spain,'' Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera told reporters.
   ``Unfortunately, ETA's position of unilaterally ending the hopes
raised to this end obliges the government to put an end to the
dialogue.''
   In addition to the bomb at the military school, police defused a
mail bomb Monday sent to Julen Elgorriaga, a government official in
Vitoria. The city is capital of the three-province Basque region in
northern Spain.
   Later Monday, several thousand people, including Elgorriaga,
marched through the Basque city of Irun to protest a mail bomb that
injured a high school gym teacher there on Friday.
   No one has claimed responsibility for the mail bombs, but
authorities suspect ETA.
   A telephone caller called a travelers' bureau and claimed
responsibility for ETA for a series of rail bombings on Saturday.
No one was injured in those attacks.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for the deaths of more than 600
people in its 21-year campaign to secure self-determination for
their region.
   In his press briefing, Corcuera also said Spain would continue
to request international help in its fight against ETA terrorism.
   Authorities in France have jailed or deported a number of
high-level ETA members. Algeria has received some of those members
but hinted recently that its hospitality might have limits if the
talks fail.
   ETA says the government has failed to live up to its side of the
agreements reached during the first phase of the talks, which began
in mid-January.
   The government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said
it was only prepared to discuss a way to end violence and how and
when ETA would lay down its arms. It refused to enter into
political negotiations on the future of the Basque country and its
2.1 million residents.

<HEAD>Basque Deputies Boycott Parliament Hours After Shooting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Basque separatists taking seats in
Parliament for the first time boycotted its opening ceremonies
today hours after being attacked by masked gunmen, who killed one
deputy and badly wounded another.
   Both houses of Parliament condemned the assassination of
deputy-elect Jon ``Josu'' Muguruza, 31, of the Popular Union party.
He was pronounced dead on arrival Monday night at Gregorio Maranon
hospital after being shot once in the head while dining in a Madrid
restaurant.
   The second deputy, 41-year-old Inaki Esnaola, was in very
serious condition after six hours of surgery, according to a
hospital statement.
   They said Muguruza and Esnaola were with the five other Basque
parliamentarians and three journalists at a table when the gunmen
attacked.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack.
   The Popular Union issued a statement blaming the ``Spanish state
apparatus'' and right-wing terrorists. It called for a general
strike Wednesday in the three-province Basque region to protest the
killings.
   Popular Union spokesman Jon Idigoras said the party's two other
deputies and three senators had decided to boycott today's
ceremonies, which they believed should have been canceled following
the assassination.
   But he told reporters that his party, generally considered the
political wing of the armed separatist group ETA, would still
participate in Parliament for the first time since Spain's return
to democracy in 1977.
   ``If they think they're going to intimidate us ... they're
wrong,'' Idigoras said. The politicians were all elected in Oct. 29
voting.
   Popular Union spokesman Xabier Oleaga said on Saturday that the
party Batasuna had decided to take its seats because it believed
there would be new peace negotiations between the government and
ETA.
   He said the party wants to be present in Parliament to present
its side of the issues.
   ETA, whose initials stand for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, has claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed
more than 600 people. It began its violent campaign for
independence from Spain in 1968.
   Monday's shooting drew condemnation from all major political
parties and the Socialist-led government.
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez said the attack was ``as
horrendous as all terrorist acts ... and without doubt an attack
against the pacification process'' in the Basque region.
   Government spokeswoman Rosa Conde called it an attack against
democracy and said ``the full weight of the law will fall on those
responsible.''
   Anonymous callers to several radio stations in the Basque region
said today that the attack had been carried out by the
Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, a shadowy organization that some
people link to the police.
   In the hours after the attack, police in the Basque region
reported several incidents, including the explosion of a small bomb
outside a branch office of the Banco Bilbao Vizcaya bank in the
town of Santurce. The bomb damaged a car but caused no injuries,
they said.
   Molotov cocktails started fires at a train station in the town
of Villabona and a bank in Onate, police said.
   The head of the conservative Popular Party, Jose Maria Aznar,
told reporters he deplored the attack. But he added that the Basque
party's outrage seemed hollow since it had never condemned the
deaths of ETA's victims.
   On Sunday, ETA claimed responsibility for the death of an army
lieutenant colonel gunned down in a car in downtown Madrid last
week. He was the 17th victim of ETA violence this year.
   The Gonzalez government began exploratory peace talks with
exiled ETA leaders in Algeria earlier this year but canceled them
in April when ETA terrorists renewed their attacks.

No clear majority emerged yesterday in regional elections in Spain's Basque
region where Madrid-based parties made strong gains at the expense of local
nationalist parties. With 99 per cent of votes counted the governing Basque
Nationalist party (PNV), the mainstream nationalist party, had equalled its
former standing by taking 22 seats. However the Basque Socialist party
(PSE), its junior coalition partner in the Basque government, fell from 16
seats to 12, and it appeared their combined total of seats would fall short
of an overall majority in the 75-member Basque parliament.
Underlining a shift away from narrow-based nationalist politics, Herri
Batasuna, the radical Basque coalition which supports the ETA separatist
group, also lost support, taking 11 seats against 13 in the 1990 elections.
The conservative Popular Party (PP) Spain's main opposition party, increased
its six seats in the outgoing to Basque legislature to 11, and the Communist
party-led Izquierda Unida, IU, which had no representatives in the outgoing
parliament was expected to return six members. Officials said 60 per cent of
the 1.7m eligible voters went to the polls.

<F P=106> [Xavier Ventura report: "Arzalluz Asserts That Government's </F>
Autonomy Policy Is Schizophrenic and Farcical"] 
  [Text] Barcelona -- Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) 
Chairman Xabier Arzalluz yesterday accused the central 
government of practicing "schizophrenia and a farce" by tending 
increasingly toward the creation of a unitary state, although 
saying that this is not so. Arzalluz made these statements in 
Barcelona at the conclusion of the meeting of the PNV and 
Democratic Union of Catalonia (UDC) Executive Committees, at 
which the two Christian Democratic parties decided to demand of 
the government that it drop its centralist criteria in European 
building and allow the presence of representatives of the 
Catalan and Basque governments in Community institutions. 
  Arzalluz showed himself "optimistic," albeit with 
reservations, when referring to the negotiation with the 
Socialists on the pending transfers [of areas of responsibility] 
to the Basque Country, and so asked Felipe Gonzalez to continue 
contacts in order to find a "political solution." The Basque 
leader said that the PNV's observance of the Constitution 
depends on the implementation of the autonomy statute, and so, 
if this process is not carried out, a "very grave" situation 
will be reached. Arzalluz also pointed out that the agreement 
on the statute had as its background observance of the 
constitutional system by the PNV, since the party did not 
approve the Constitution. In view of this he warned that "we 
cannot allow implementation of the statute not being completed" 
in the current legislative term, the government's "refusing to 
implement it," or, if it does so, subsequently "undermining" it 
through laws, decrees, or Constitutional Court rulings. 
  The meeting between Union and the PNV -- the first of the 
meetings which will henceforth be held every six months -- was 
basically aimed at establishing a joint stance on the presence 
of Catalonia and the Basque Country in the European Union. In 
this connection the two parties believe that the Spanish state 
is the "most centralist" in its European role and demand that 
the autonomous governments' presence in Community institutions 
be ensured, and also that the autonomous communities be able to 
take part in the state's political stance on European issues, as 
is the case in Belgium and Germany, for instance. 
  To achieve this, Union leader Josep Antoni Duran Lleida 
explained, the electoral law for the European elections must be 
amended, replacing the single constituency covering the whole of 
Spain with regional constituencies. They also demand the 
involvement of the Catalan and Basque governments in the 
allocation of Community funds, and the political normalization 
of the missions which both autonomous communities have abroad. 
Arzalluz asserted that the European integration process is 
being carried out with "centralist criteria" and that it is 
being used to enable the central government to "take back 
power," since "a standardization process is being attempted in 
Spain in the name of European unity." 
  In addition, the two parties reiterated their intention to 
put forward a joint program in the European elections since 
their European deputies are in the same group in the European 
parliament. UDC and the PNV did not raise at this meeting the 
possibility of running together in the European elections, as 
the Basque party proposed in 1989 -- a request opposed by 
Democratic Convergence of Catalonia (CDC). Arzalluz said that 
"we are already running together, albeit not on the same list," 
although he asserted that the Basques "are not coming to 
separate anything in Catalonia," while Duran asserted that Union 
"gives priority to the coalition with CDC" and rules out running 
with the PNV, even though he still believes that "we would like 
to run together."

<F P=106> [Aitor Guenaga report: "ETA Announces New Attacks And </F>
Affirms: `We Will Win'"] 
  [Text] Bilbao -- The terrorist organization, ETA [Basque 
Fatherland and Liberty], yesterday claimed responsibility for 
the latest attacks, issuing a victorious statement via the daily 
newspaper EGIN far removed from defeatism. "We will win," 
assured the text published by the Guizpucoa newspaper. "The era 
of resistance, the doubts, and the false expectations" are all 
over, according to the armed gang. ETA defended the need to 
continue the attacks in order to achieve its oft-repeated goal: 
Basque independence. "We cannot keep on hoping, nor can we 
place our hopes in miracle solutions. We must obtain new 
results on the road to liberty through our daily struggle." 
  In the two-page press release, written entirely in Basque, 
ETA claimed responsibility for the attack which took the life of 
Civil Guard member Fernando Jimenez Pascual on 4 April in 
Bilbao. Similarly, it said it was responsible for the grenade 
attack carried out on 18 April against the Military Command in 
Barcelona, which cost the life of compatriot Vicente Beti 
Montesinos, who was close to the organization, and whose death, 
the terrorist gang said, was unfortunate. 
  Lastly, the group claimed that it set the devices which 
caused the 20 April explosion on the railroad line linking 
Madrid and Irun, as well as the action against a branch of the 
Caja Vital [bank] in Salvatierra (Alava). Herri Batasuna 
[United People] is waging a battle with that bank because of 
failure to pay a debt. 
  In addition to its triumphalist rhetoric, ETA made a wager 
on 
the unity of the nationalist left: "This is not the time to 
seek out differences, but to develop the issues and sectors in 
which we can work jointly at the same pace and with the same 
initiatives." However, he repeated his speech about the double 
model used for the Basque Country: the model of those who 
condemn the people to disappear, and the model "proposed by the 
nationalist left, which seeks a new society in an independent 
Euskal Herria [Basque Union]." 
<H5>  "Jabotxa" Still Being Detained </H5>
  In the meantime, the editor in chief of EGIN, Patxi Xabier 
Fernandez Monje, or "Jabotxa," who was taken into custody 
Saturday afternoon for his presumed links with ETA, was still in 
custody yesterday at the Indautin police station. Herri 
Batasuna's legal representative, Arantza Zulueta, went to Bilbao 
to defend him. On Saturday night, the police searched the 
dwelling of the EGIN editor without, apparently, taking 
anything, according to one of the newspaper's employees. 
  The detention of EGIN's editor in chief is linked to the 
open 
operation against ETA following the downfall last Thursday of 
the leader of the Barcelona commando and a former member of 
Herri Batasuna's national board, Felipe San Epifiano, known as 
Pipe. Jabotxa and Pipe were sentenced in 1985 by the high court 
to six months and one day in prison for public disorder, along 
with six other members of Jarrai (KAS [expansion unknown] youth).

Bilbao to defend him. On Saturday night, the police searched 
the dwelling of the EGIN editor without, apparently, taking 
anything, according to one of the newspaper's employees. 
  The detention of EGIN's editor in chief is linked to the 
open 
operation against ETA following the downfall last Thursday of 
the leader of the Barcelona commando and a former member of 
Herri Batasuna's national board, Felipe San Epifiano, known as 
Pipe. Jabotxa and Pipe were sentenced in 1985 by the high court 
to six months and one day in prison for public disorder, along 
with six other members of Jarrai (KAS [expansion unknown] youth).

<F P=106> [Report by V. Ruiz de Azua and L.R. Aizpeolea: "Aznar and </F>
Arzalluz Normalize Relations With Their Second Meeting in Two 
Months"] 
  [Text] The People's Party [PP] and the PNV [Basque 
Nationalist Party] are continuing with the normalization of 
their relations. Their two chairmen -- Jose Maria Aznar and 
Xabier Arzalluz -- held a meeting lasting almost two hours in 
Madrid yesterday, on the former's initiative. Aznar invited 
Arzalluz to his home and then accompanied him to a shopping mall 
so that his companion, nationalist leader Juan Maria Ollora, 
could buy a book on the fall of Mario Conde. According to 
sources in the two parties, the conversation was cordial, and 
occurred "irrespective" of the political differences. 
  The PNV does not share the PP's stance of censuring the 
government, while Aznar holds the PNV and its chairman jointly 
responsible for the impossibility of submitting a censure 
motion. However, the two leaders have held a meeting for the 
second time in two months, and, also for the second time, 
Arzalluz has stated that Aznar seems to him "a good person," and 
that he would trust him to conclude an agreement. The previous 
meeting took place secretly around Easter Week in Burgos, midway 
between Madrid and Bilbao. 
  On this occasion, however, Arzalluz agreed to visit Aznar in 
the morning in his office at PP headquarters, at 13 Genova 
Street in Madrid. When the date of the meeting became known the 
day before yesterday, the PP chairman offered him the 
possibility of going to his home to avoid being hounded by 
cameras. 
  The normalization of relations with the PP enables the PNV 
chairman to reaffirm his independence from the Socialists, with 
whom he is governing in a coalition in the Basque Country. It 
enables Aznar to show that, despite the disagreements, he is 
keeping channels of communication with other parliamentary 
parties open, and that the current disagreement does not mean 
isolation. 
  The conversation was attended by Basque PP Chairman Jaime 
Mayor Oreja and PNV leader Juan Maria Ollora. The two men, with 
other leaders of each party, will undertake to study over the 
next few weeks the PNV's autonomy proposals, which Arzalluz had 
already handed to his interlocutor in Burgos, contained in 
several documents. 
  Mayor Oreja stated in the afternoon that everything was 
discussed a little without prior order, without trying to seek 
any commitment or change of stance by either side. The PNV 
emphasized to the PP its intention to shun extremist stances 
with respect to the Socialist government, intimating that it 
will not take part in a destructive strategy or one of all-out 
resistance. 
  In this connection, Arzalluz asked Aznar to tone down the 
political strategy of tension maintained by the PP, using the 
corruption scandals. The PNV chairman told his host that the 
strategy that "seeks to erode leads to nothing good," according 
to nationalist sources. 
<H5>  Joint Study </H5>
  The PP and nationalist leaders took up again some of the 
matters that were discussed in the conversation held 29 March in 
Burgos. On that occasion, the possibility of setting up a kind 
of committee to study together the implementation of the Gernika 
Statute was raised. This idea of PP Deputy Secretary General 
Mariano Rajoy caught on at yesterday's meeting in producing a 
response from another of those attending the meeting -- Juan 
Maria Ollora. Both Mayor Oreja and Ollora will hold contacts 
and extend them successively with contributions from [Basque 
autonomous government] Councilor of the President's Office 
Joseba Zubia and Councilor of Finance Juan Luis Larrea -- both 
belonging to the PNV -- who are the negotiators on autonomy with 
the central administration. 
  The nationalists believe that this interchange is necessary 
in view of the uncertainty of the political scene that is 
developing not only in Spain but also in the Basque Country 
itself. Next fall's autonomous community elections leave the 
scene open, in the nationalists' opinion, and although the most 
likely outcome is that the current government coalition of 
Socialists and nationalists will continue, a result leading to a 
new government combination in which the PNV's new partner would 
be the PP is not ruled out. 
  But the central aim of the meeting -- arranged last week 
before Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra's appearance in the 
Congress [of Deputies] to answer questions on the Roldan affair 
-- was to relax relations between the two parties. "We are 
experiencing a time when we should all discuss everything, and 
not just in parliament," Arzalluz said yesterday, shortly before 
his meeting with Aznar. Later, nationalist sources close to the 
participants stated that the meeting was "cordial and relaxed." 
"Discussion between the leaders moderates language. The PNV is 
not at the eye of the PP's storm, nor is the PP at the eye of 
the PNV's storm. This meeting will help to calm the general 
political scene," the same sources said.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (6): The strain in Spain - Pressures for
greater regional autonomy are growing stronger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUNNING SPAIN must sometimes feel a little like drifting on a liferaft of
oil drums tied together with thin string. The longer the craft stays in the
water the weaker the binding becomes and the cans begin to move ominously.
Although bound by the 1978 Constitution, the 17 autonomous regions that make
up modern Spain are beginning to jostle about, rubbing up against each other
and pressing the central government for more autonomy. The problem is not
that the raft is falling apart but rather that it is costing Madrid a lot
more money to keep it together.
With Spain's public sector deficit running at 4.4 per cent of GDP
(opposition parties claim it is much higher) a recent OECD report on the
Spanish economy surprised no-one by insisting that 'one of the main causes
for high deficits is expansionary policy by regional governments'.
While the central government deficit has been falling since 1985, regional
debt has risen from 0.3 per cent of GDP in 1985 to more than 1.5 per cent
last year. The OECD accuses the regions of spending money on flashy projects
and of paying their civil servants - many of whom duplicate jobs being done
in Madrid - more than central government pays its own.
Frustrated by Madrid's reluctance to throw more money at them, the regions
have begun to tap local and international capital markets for funds. Many
are close to breaching their legal debt limits - interest payments may not
be more than 25 per cent of revenues - and one, Cantabria, technically
bankrupted itself last year.
The OECD calls on Madrid (in truth, OECD country reports are usually written
with the assistance of the Finance Ministry concerned) to tighten up these
limits and to make it clear to lenders that the State is not underwriting
regional borrowing.
But that misses the crucial political point. The borrowing is just a symptom
of the tremendous head of regionalist political steam built up because of
the federal vision held out by the 1978 Constitution. Although the complex
constitutional system gives some regions - Catalonia, the Basque Country,
Galicia and Andalucia - more autonomy more rapidly than the others, all 17
regions are basically promised the freedom, in time, to run their internal
affairs.
Madrid's difficulty is that it never really rid itself of the centralist
tradition inherited from Franco and is trying to grant autonomy at its pace
while many of the regions run by regional parties are trying to grab, in
Madrid's view, too much too quickly. It is arguable that devolved power can
never create a true federation anyway and that federal states such as
Germany and the US function because the devolution went the other way - from
the states to the centre.
The tension between regions and Madrid stands to reason: the politics of the
regions are fundamentally nationalist, or even ethnic. It is essential to
the electability of a regional party that Madrid be painted as an inadequate
provider, as a distributor of Catalan taxes to Extremadura or of encouraging
investment in Andalucia at the Basque Country's expense.
Much of this is game playing. But it can sound very threatening. Both
Catalonia and the Basque Country are run by conservative nationalist parties
whose leaders periodically say almost seditious things. Last year, the
Catalan leader observed that Catalonia was in a very similar situation to
Lithuania, which was then becoming independent of the former Soviet Union.
Did he mean Catalonia should be independent too?
He said no, not at all, and then promptly began to press Madrid for more
money and, to his horror, had his bluff called. In negotiations last year to
redesign the financial arrangements between the regions and Madrid Catalonia
began to press loudly for the right to be able to spend the taxes raised in
Catalonia. Madrid soon shut this up by suggesting the Catalan government
might like to raise these taxes itself too, as the Basques do.
This was not what the Catalans had in mind. Raising (in the sense of
collecting or increasing) taxes is not a politically attractive thing to do.
The Catalan Government simply wanted to spend what Madrid had collected. So
the demand was quietly dropped.
But the fuss about more autonomy is not just a harmless struggle for money.
Slowly but surely it is changing the face of Spanish politics as the large
centralist parties weaken and the regionalists grow. It is quite possible,
for instance, that the next Spanish general election (to be held between now
and October next year) will force Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's
socialists into a coalition with either the ruling Catalan CiU or the ruling
Basque PNV. Both these parties send MPs to Madrid and the CiU is the third
largest party in the House.
The large conservative opposition, the Partido Popular (PP), has also been
forced to compromise. In Navarra, for instance, it has an agreement under
which it supports the ruling UPN in regional elections and in turn expects
the UPN vote to come to it in general elections. The PP has also formed
alliances with regionalist groups in Aragon and local ones in Valencia and
Seville.
At another level, regions controlled by socialist party or PP leaders are
also being forced to champion regional themes with which their centralist
party leaderships are uncomfortable. In socialist Andalucia, for example,
the regional government fights constant skirmishes with Madrid over health
policy. Andalucia is one of the few regions with its own health service and
claims Madrid, in order to save money, constantly delays making budgeted
transfers to Seville which, in turn, borrows money in the capital markets to
make up shortfalls and thus infuriates Madrid.
Meanwhile, Galicia, which the PP controls through its maverick founder, the
former Francoist minister Manuel Fraga, is leading a sudden charge to
redesign totally the way the historic autonomies - Catalonia, the Basque
Country and Galicia - are run. He has called for the creation of a single
administration in each territory, meaning that centrally appointed civil
governors and other officials would be withdrawn. Madrid would thus delegate
all its powers - including control of the police - to the leader in these
regions.
It just happens that the socialists control none of the three historic
autonomies (though they are the junior coalition partner in the Basque
Country) and the idea therefore is unlikely to get very far now. But
Catalonia's leadership likes it and single administration may yet make
headway if the Catalan CiU is able to force the socialists into a coalition
after the next national election.
For the CiU and the Basque PNV, the need to be seen to be making progress on
questions of autonomy (even if it is sometimes illusory) is critical because
they are constantly being chased in their own backyards by smaller parties
which genuinely want independence for their regions and not just more
national resources.
This is even beginning now in Aragon and while Basque separatists regularly
take about 16 per cent of the Basque vote there has been a sharp increase in
support recently for the separatist Catalan party ERC. That is a direct
result of the Catalan leader, Mr Jordi Pujol, exciting nationalist fervour,
and backing off. Whenever he does this he leaves a separatist residue for
the ERC to pick up.

   Thousands of mourners accompanied the body
of a slain Basque politician through city streets today, and
demonstrators around the Basque region burned barricades and closed
businesses to protest his death.
   Jon ``Josu'' Muguruza was killed Monday by two suspected
right-wing gunmen as he sat in a Madrid restaurant with other
Basque legislators of his radical coalition, the Herri Batasuna
(Popular Union) Party. He was elected to parliament Oct. 29.
   Muguruza's body, accompanied by 5,000 supporters waving Basque
flags and chanting anti-government slogans, was carried to city
hall, where it will lie in state.
   A second deputy-elect from the same party was shot in the
attack, which came on the eve of the swearing-in ceremonies for the
new Parliament. He has improved considerably since undergoing
surgery for four bullet wounds, doctors said.
   Herri Batasuna is widely regarded as the political wing of the
separatist group ETA, which claims responsibility for attacks that
have killed more than 600 people in a 21-year campaign for
independence for the Spanish Basque region.
   Most businesses in the region closed for the day, heeding the
party's call for a general strike or succumbing to pressure from
roving groups of protesters who advised them not to open, news
reports said.
   Youths burned barricades on highways in the three Basque
provinces and neighboring Navarre, and officials suspended bus
service in the provincial capitals of San Sebastian, Bilbao,
Vitoria and the Navarran capital, Pamplona.
   One resident of the town of Santurce, who identified herself
only as Susana, told Spanish radio that masked youths had shut down
her bread store. ``We're scared,'' she said.
   Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has called the shooting
``horrendous'' and said apprehending the gunmen was a top priority
for the government.
   Several Spanish dailies, citing Interior Ministry sources, said
investigators believe the two men who burst into the Madrid
restaurant and opened fire with pistols were aiming at the injured
politician, Inaki Esnaola, and accidentally killed Muguruza.
   Two other deputies, three senators and three others were seated
at the table but uninjured in the attack.
   The dailies said the fact that the attack occurred on the 14th
anniversary of the death of authoritarian ruler Gen. Francisco
Franco, and that the gunmen used military-issue ammunition, led
police to suspect a link with ultra-right army factions.
   ``(The) attack ... bears the unmistakable signs of fascism,''
leading daily El Pais said in an editorial.
   Both Muguruza, who was 31, and the 41-year-old Esnaola were
regarded as ``moderates'' who favored the resumption of talks
between government representatives and ETA, suspended by Gonzalez
in April after ETA broke a moratorium on its attacks.
   They also supported Herri Batasuna's decision to take its seats
in Parliament for the first time since the country's return to
democracy in 1977 _a decision party spokesman Jon Idigoras said it
would stick to, despite the attack.
   Until now, Herri Batasuna members had refused to swear
allegiance to the 1978 Spanish constitution, a prerequisite for
parliamentary participation.

   Two masked gunmen entered a hotel Monday
and opened fire on a group of Basque politicians, killing one
elected legislator and wounding another, police reported.
   They identified the victims as Jon Muguruza, 31, and Inaki
Esnaola, 41, both elected to Parliament's lower house in the Oct.
29 balloting. Officials at Gregorio Maranon Hospital said Muguruza
was dead on arrival and Esnaola was in grave condition with two
bullet wounds in the head.
   Both were supporters of the militant Basque separatist
organization ETA.
   It was believed to be the first assassination of a Spanish
parliamentarian since before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War
in 1936.
   Muguruza and Esnaola were among four deputies and three senators
of the Basque party Herri Batasuna (Popular Union) who were to
swear allegiance to Spain Tuesday before being installed in
Parliament.
   Police said no group asserted responsibility for the attack that
occurred in the restaurant of the Hotel Alcala at 11 p.m.
   They said Muguruza and Esnaola were with the five other elected
Basque parliamentarians and three journalists seated around a table
when the gunmen attacked. The journalists are employees of the
Basque newspaper Egin.
   All members of the 350-seat lower house of Parliament (Cortes)
are to swear allegiance Tuesday to the constitution _ the first
step in the process of establishing a new Parliament that King Juan
Carlos is to open December 6.
   It is the first time since democracy was restored in 1977 that
Basque separatists elected to Parliament planned to swear
allegiance and take their seats. Other Basques politicians have
been elected to Parliament but refused to take the oath and were
not seated.
   Esnaola said in a recent interview that he and his colleagues
would swear allegiance under duress ``because I am forced to by
law.'' He said the Basque deputies and senators would serve in
Parliament so they could speak out for self-determination for the
Basque region in northern Spain and serve as mediators in
negotiations between the government and outlawed ETA.
   ETA is an acronym in the Basque language for Basque land and
liberty.
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist Party won the October
elections.
   His government began exploratory peace talks with exiled ETA
leaders in Algiers earlier this year but canceled them April when
ETA terrorists renewed their attacks.
   The Basque legislators were shot on the 14th anniversary of the
death of Gen. Francisco Franco, who eliminated the historic
political rights of the Spanish Basques after his forces won the
Civil War in 1939.
   The Basque Popular Union is regarded as the political wing of
the ETA.
   Over the past 21 years, ETA has claimed responsibility for the
killings of more than 600 people, with most of the victims police
or military officers.
   Basque Populars Unity has won 10-15 percent of the vote in the
three Basque provinces, with a population of 2.1 million, since
1979.
   Muguruzu was an elected deputy from Vizcaya province and Esnaola
from Guipuzcoa province.

<TEXT>
THE SPANISH government was yesterday bracing itself for a possible upsurge
in separatist violence after the arrest in France late on Sunday of the
military high command of the Basque separatist organisation, Eta.
Senior Spanish officials, struggling to disguise their delight at the
capture of Eta's three most wanted operational leaders by French police,
were warning that retaliatory strikes were still possible.
'The operation is still going on . . . but there must not be any euphoria,'
said Mr Jose Luis Corcuera, the Spanish interior minister. 'Eta is still
capable of striking and there will not be any relaxation in our security. If
anything, it will be increased.' He said Spain would try to have the three
extradited.
The capture of the three men is probably the most devastating blow struck by
the authorities against Eta, which has killed more than 700 people in its
20-year struggle for Basque independence. Those held were Francisco Mugica
Garmendia, Eta's military commander and Spain's public enemy number one.
With him were two key lieutenants, Jose Luis Alvarez Santacristina, Eta's
leading ideologue, and Joseba Arregui Erostarbe, alleged by police to be the
group's top bomb-maker.
The organisation has stepped up its campaign this year in the hope of
frightening the government to a negotiating table by threatening to attack
this summer's Olympic Games in Barcelona or the World Fair in Seville. More
than 12 people have been killed this year.
Although the detention of the men was greeted by violent protests in parts
of the Basque country, Madrid is hoping that the removal of the military
leadership might make it easier for more moderate elements in Eta or its
political wing, Herri Batasuna, to make their voices heard.
Nevertheless, Eta leaders have been arrested before and replaced, though the
arrest on Sunday of Mugica means that the last of the organisation's
traditional Marxist-Leninist leaders is now dead or behind bars. But it is
assumed that at least two Eta units will continue to operate in Spain.
Mugica was one of the ideological clique thought to have murdered Eta's
leader, Mr Moreno Bergaretxe, and assumed control in 1974 when he began to
have second thoughts about armed struggle.
That entire clique is now under arrest or dead but one of its members lives
under a form of house arrest in the Dominican Republic. He is Eugenio
Exteveste, whom Madrid sees as the only person moderate enough to negotiate
an end to the fighting and who would still carry some credibility with Eta's
die-hard supporters.

<TEXT>
Attempts by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to regain the political
initiative have suffered a significant setback in regional elections in the
Basque country, where conservatives and communists made strong gains at the
expense of his Socialist party.
The Basque elections on Sunday were won, as expected, by the mainstream
nationalist party, the Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV), which regained the
22 seats it had held in the outgoing 75-member regional parliament. But
despite an active campaign by Mr Gonzalez, the Socialist party, which had
been the junior coalition partner in the PNV-led Basque government, lost
four of its 16 seats in the local legislature, its worst electoral result in
the region.
In a highly fragmented vote that will make creation of a new governing
majority difficult, the conservative Partido Popular (PP) gained 11 seats,
up from six, and the communist-led Izquierda Unida group (IU), which
previously had no members in the Basque parliament, returned six.
Sunday's poll underlined the sharp fall in support for the prime minister
that emerged last June when the PP established a 10-point lead over the
Socialists to win the European parliament elections, and when both the PP
and IU doubled their vote in Andalucia, Mr Gonzalez's home region, causing
the Socialist party to lose its majority in local elections held on the same
day.
Mr Gonzalez, who was returned to power for a fourth term in 1993 although
without an overall majority, is blamed for a severe recession that has
raised unemployment to a record level and for a series of corruption
scandals that rocked his government earlier this year.
June's defeats propelled the often reclusive prime minister into a hectic
schedule of parliamentary appearences, public meetings, television 'fireside
chats' and media interviews. However, Mr Jose Maria Aznar, PP leader, said
yesterday the Basque poll had confirmed 'the unstoppable decline of the
socialist vote'.
Analysts said the Socialists had probably been penalised in the Basque
elections for co-opting a local left-wing party, Euzkadiko Ezkerra, on to
its ticket and campaigning for the 'ethnic' Basque vote. Traditional
socialist voters in the area are mainly immigrants from elsewhere in Spain
or their descendants.
Mr Gonzalez's popularity will next be tested in municipal elections in May,
as well as in polls to elect new parliaments in 13 of Spain's 17 autonomous
regions.
The responsibility for leading the Basque executive, meanwhile, falls once
more to the PNV, which has governed the area, either on its own on in
coalition with the Socialists, since 1980.

   Assailants believed to be Basque
separatists fired grenades at a Civil Guard barracks in northern
Spain today and bombed a convoy near another northern town. At least
three men were wounded, police said.
   A police spokesman said at least two officers were hurt when a
four-vehicle Civil Guard convoy was bombed on a highway near the
northern Basque town of Areta, six miles south of the port of Bilbao.
   The spokesman said a passerby also was believed hurt.
   The blast came about eight hours after assailants launched a
rocket-propelled grenade attack on a Civil Guard barracks outside
Alsasua after apparently planting booby traps in the area, a Civil
Guard spokesman said. Asusua is in the Navarre region that borders
the northern Basque country.
   One Civil Guard officer was seriously injured when he tripped a
booby-trap bomb, said the spokesman, who was not identified in
keeping with custom. At least two other hidden bombs failed to
detonate and two were defused, he said.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but
police said both bore the earmarks of ETA, the Basque separatist
organization.
   The group has carried out a 20-year violent campaign in an effort
to secure independence from Spain for the three-province northern
Basque region and to seek annexation of the bordering autonomous
region of Navarre.
   Alsasua lies on the border with the Basque region, 30 miles east
of Pamplona, the Navarre region's capital.
   A spokesman at Pamplona's University Clinic hospital said the
booby-trap blast blew away parts of both legs of guard Jose Aguilar
Garcia, 26.
   In another development, a gunman believed to be an ETA member
killed Thursday the owner of a bar in Zarauz, a town in the Basque
province of Guizpuzcoa. Authorities called the shooting of
Engraciano Gonzalez Macho, 42, ``a clear ETA attack,'' adding that
the gunman was believed to be the same man who triggered a car bomb
Sunday that killed a policeman and injured 12 people in Eibar, 25
miles east of San Sebastian.
   Since 1968, ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than
600 people, mainly Civil Guard, police and military officers.
   So far this year ETA-claimed attacks have killed 17 people.
   ETA is an acronym in the Basque language for Homeland and Liberty.

<F P=106> [Luis R. Aizpeolea and Anabel Diez report: "Serra and </F>
Arzalluz Meet at Moncloa Palace"] 
  [Text] Madrid -- The government and the PNV [Basque 
Nationalist Party] have taken a first step toward relaxing their 
relations after three months of mutual affronts. Deputy Prime 
Minister Narcis Serra and PNV Chairman Xabier Arzalluz met 
Wednesday [19 January] at the Moncloa Palace, at the government 
"number two's" request, in order to normalize relations which 
have been troubled since the approval of the overall state 
budgets in November. 
  On that occasion, the PNV voted against several sections of 
the budget when the government did not take some of its 
amendments into account. 
  At that time, the Basque Nationalists reproached the 
government and the Socialist parliamentary group for 
discriminatory treatment in comparison with the Catalan 
nationalists of Convergence and Union (CiU). 
  Serra offered Arzalluz a reopening of dialogue between the 
government and the PNV, whose relations have passed in just six 
months from the possibility of taking part in a coalition 
government to the most severe dialectical confrontations, 
ranging from traditional condemnations of the government's 
failures to keep its word on autonomy, through a warning about 
the role of the king, to public criticism of some action by the 
Civil Guard. 
  Part of the meeting was devoted to surmounting 
misunderstandings and stopping the snowballing criticisms. This 
flood of mutual accusations reached its peak with the Basque 
Socialists' proposal for negotiating politically with Herri 
Batasuna [People's Unity Party], without previously consulting 
with the parties comprising the Ajuria Enea Pact. 
  The immediate result of the new atmosphere of dialogue will 
be an impending meeting between Minister of Public 
Administration Jeronimo Saavedra and Councillor for the Basque 
Premier's Office Joseba Zubia in order to unblock the 
negotiation of the package of 54 transfers [of areas of 
responsibility] demanded by the Vitoria government. 
  The central government intends to offer immediately to the 
Basque government a block of 15 to 20 transfers, whose ownership 
is indisputable and whose only point of friction is their 
valuation. 
  However, despite the atmosphere of relaxation created 
following the meeting between Serra and Arzalluz -- whose 
personal relationship is excellent, confirmed by regular 
contacts since Serra took up the deputy premiership in 1991 -- 
skepticism still prevails among the Basque Socialists and 
Nationalists. The proximity of the Basque autonomous community 
elections, scheduled for the fall, is the cause of the suspicion. 
  The political rivalry existing between the PNV and the 
Basque 
Socialist Party on the Basque scene must not be forgotten at a 
time when Ramon Jauregui's supporters have in mind the 
possibility of defeating Jose Antonio Ardanza's Nationalists in 
the elections. This battle will inevitably have repercussions on 
relations between the PNV -- and, as a result, the Basque 
government -- and the central administration. 
  Felipe Gonzalez' government, however, is determined as far 
as 
possible to prevent the political rivalry from going beyond the 
framework of the autonomous community and tainting the 
institutional relations which both Felipe Gonzalez and Narcis 
Serra deem essential.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jose Antonio Ardanza, head of the Basque </F>
Country autonomous government, at his home in Ajuria Enea, by 
Ana de Benavides; date not given: "Ardanza Claims Gonzalez 
Government Has `Toyed' With Basques"] 
  [Excerpt] From his residence in Ajuria Enea, Jose Antonio 
Ardanza is waiting anxiously to learn the policy of the new 
interior minister, Antoni Asuncion; is saddened by the latest 
ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty Group] attack, which was 
aimed directly at the PNV [Basque Nationalist Party]; and is 
irritated at the Spanish Government's failure to move ahead on 
the Guernica Charter. The Basque leader maintains that Felipe 
Gonzalez's policy of making ad hoc coalitions with disparate 
parties is "not intelligent." 
  [de Benavides] As the sergeant major of the Ertzaintza 
[Basque Autonomous Police] lay at death's door, I was asking 
myself: How long will the ETA continue? 
  [Ardanza] Until they decide to change. We have exhausted 
every possible way of reaching out to them. The Ajuria Enea 
accord laid out the framework for a solution, so there is no 
need for further speculation about what ought to be done. How 
long will the ETA continue? Until they decide, once and for all, 
that agreeing to play by the rules of the democratic game does 
not constitute a surrender or humiliation of any kind. 
  [de Benavides] I presume that this latest attack throws into 
question the path of dialogue with the terrorist organization. 
  [Ardanza] If they interpret dialogue as just a way to see 
how 
many more concessions they can extract from their interlocutors, 
then yes, dialogue would be a mistake. Sure, let's have 
dialogue, so long as the goal is to arrive at a definitive 
solution. It is difficult to change ETA's attitudes through 
police action alone, since standing behind ETA are the voters of 
HB [Herri Batasuna]. If we want to convince these people they 
must integrate themselves into the life of democracy, we must 
formulate a solution through dialogue, though admittedly at the 
present moment there is little enthusiasm for further talk. 
  [de Benavides] You were always optimistic about the ETA's 
eventual fate. You even ventured the opinion that the highway 
might solve the problem. 
  [Ardanza] I continue to be optimistic, but I never predicted 
when success would come. We have reached a point in time where 
the ETA is politically a failed option. It may be able to hang 
on to the support it still has in HB, but the rest of society 
completely, unequivocally, and fearlessly rejects it, saying 
"Enough already--we don't need to be `saved'." 
  [de Benavides] But ETA still exists, and keeps on killing. 
  [Ardanza] Neither within the political sector nor in society 
as a whole does the ETA figure among the highest-priority 
issues. The citizenry are not terribly concerned about the ETA 
anymore. They worry more about the economic recession and the 
slowdown in industry. [passage omitted on other topics]

<F P=106> [Article by Peter Strafford: "The Economic Pain in Spain"] </F>
  [Text] After several years of growing self-confidence in 
the late 1980s, culminating in the festivities of 1992, when it 
celebrated the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's 
discovery of the New World, Spain is suffering from a hangover. 
It is not alone in this, at a time of recession in Europe. But 
economic difficulties are hitting the Spanish particularly hard, 
with, for instance, an estimated 23 per cent or more unemployed. 
  At the same time the socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez 
has been weakened politically. The socialist party (PSOE) 
emerged as the winner in last June's general election, in spite 
of expectations that it would be overtaken by the conservative 
Partido Popular (PP) [People's Party], but it lost the overall 
majority in parliament it had held since 1982. 
  Senor Gonzalez tried to form a coalition with two 
nationalist 
parties, Convergencia i Unio (CiU) [Convergence and Union] of 
Catalonia and the Partido Nacional Vasco (PNV) [Basque National 
Party] of the Basque country, with which he would have commanded 
a permanent majority, but this proved impossible. So he now 
heads a minority government which needs to win support from 
elsewhere for each of its legislative measures. 
  For the parties of the opposition, all this implies that 
after being in power for nearly 12 years, the socialists are 
approaching the end of the line. Jose Maria Aznar, leader of 
the PP, told THE TIMES that though in the end his party had not 
won last Junes election, it had increased its votes from 
5,200,000 to 8,200,000. It made its appeal to the young, 
particularly professionals and townspeople in general, and was a 
clear alternative to the socialists. 
  Inaki Anasagasti, parliamentary leader of the PNV, talked of 
"the end of an epoch," and said that Senor Gonzalez, the 
towering figure in Spanish politics since 1982, was "tired." 
  This is not the way the socialists see it, however, and, 
faced with an admittedly difficult situation, they are fighting 
back confidently. Narcis Serra, the deputy prime minister, who 
is himself a Catalan, said there were signs that Spain was 
emerging from recession. "Statistics for the second half of 
1993 show a change in the trend," he told THE TIMES. "There 
won't be a sudden change for the better, but we are slowly 
getting out." 
  Spanish companies were improving their profits, Senor Serra 
said, interest rates were still going down, and the favourable 
exchange rate for the peseta, after three devaluations, was 
helping the growth of exports. If other European countries 
picked up, so would Spain. 
  Senor Serra conceded that having only a minority government 
made things more difficult, but claimed that the results so far 
were "not bad." The government had received the support of the 
CiU and the PNV for austerity measures in the budget for 1994, 
adopted last autumn; and this was followed by an overwhelming 
parliamentary majority last month, including the PP, for an 
important series of reforms to the laws on employment. 
  Other reforms were either under way or planned, Senor Serra 
said, with two overall aims: to allow companies to become more 
competitive without reducing the number of employees, and to 
adjust the Spanish labour market to wider European conditions. 
  The underlying question is whether the government will have 
the will, and the political muscle, not just to pull Spain out 
of recession, but to carry through some fundamental reforms that 
are thought to be needed if the Spanish economy is to become 
competitive in the European Union. Since democracy returned to 
Spain after the death of General Franco in 1975, the overriding 
aim of all Spanish governments has been to overcome the 
backwardness and isolation the country had known for many years; 
and with the rapid growth of the 1980s there were hopes of 
achieving that. 
  The onset of recession has revealed continuing weaknesses, 
however, and steps have been taken to address them. One was the 
rigidity of the employment laws, some not so different from 
those of the Franco era. The new legislation is designed to 
improve that by, for instance, allowing for part-time 
employment, and the taking on of young people as apprentices at 
lower wage levels, and in general making it easier to hire and 
fire. 
  For the moment, difficulties have been crowding in on the 
socialists thick and fast. In December, Promocion Social de 
Viviendas, a housing cooperative run by the Union General de 
Trabajadores (UGT) [General Workers Union], the big socialist 
trade union confederation, collapsed; and this was followed by 
the near-collapse of Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), Spain's 
fourth-largest bank, leading to the dismissal of its board by 
the Bank of Spain and the appointment of a new team. 
  On January 27, the UGT and the Comisiones Obreras [Workers 
Commissions], the other main union confederation, called a 
one-day general strike in protest against the new employment 
legislation. 
  The strike slowed Spain down for a day, but it is not 
expected to deter the government from its reform policies. It 
reflected the differences between a socialist government that 
has long been one of the most pragmatic and market-orientated in 
Europe and its former supporters in the unions. These 
differences are still being fought out inside the PSOE, where 
Senor Gonzalez has tried to shake off the influence of the left, 
and will come to a head at a party congress next month. 
  In the background is the age-old tension between Madrid and 
the Spanish regions, whose most extreme manifestation is the 
continuing, though weakened, terrorist campaign by Euskadi Ta 
Askatasuna (ETA) [Basque Homeland and Liberty], the Basque 
independence movement. The fact that the government is dependent 
on support from the CiU and the PNV in parliament has given 
moderate Catalan and Basque nationalists a greater degree of 
leverage. Both parties are basically in sympathy with the 
current reform moves, but have been pressing for the granting of 
greater autonomous powers in return. 
  At Catalan insistence, a new arrangement for the funding of 
the regions was agreed last autumn. This did not help the 
Basques, however, and both Miquel Roca, parliamentary leader of 
the CiU, and Senor Anasagasti want more. The Madrid government, 
they say, has still not fully carried out the terms of their 
original autonomy statutes, dating back to 1979. 
  There are significant differences between the Catalans, more 
numerous and prosperous, and the Basques. Senor Roca points out 
emphatically that the CiU is not a separatist party, and 
sometimes gives the impression that the party's aim is, far from 
secession from Spain, rather influence over the whole country. 
  Senor Anasagasti, on the other hand, caused a storm last 
month by publicly protesting against a speech by King Juan 
Carlos, made before a military audience, in which he made an 
oblique, and mild, reference to regional differences. "The 
diversity which enriches us," the King said, "must unite us 
rather than separate us." 
  By tradition, statements by the King are not publicly 
criticised in Spain, but Senor Anasagasti said that the speech 
had been "neither balanced nor just," and this was followed by 
fiery statements by other PNV leaders attacking the army and the 
Guardia Civil, the paramilitary police. 
  Senor Anasagasti said later that his objection was 
essentially to the audience before whom the King had spoken, 
since the position of the King should not be based just on 
"bayonets," but on the various constitutional bodies. He denied 
it, but the assumption in other parties is that the PNV was 
looking ahead to the regional election in the Basque Country 
this autumn, when it does not want to be outflanked by the 
extreme nationalists. 
  In its foreign policy, the Spanish government retains its 
belief in closer integration in the EU [European Union], based 
on the Maastricht Treaty and going beyond it. This is in spite 
of recent difficulties in the exchange rate mechanism, which led 
to the devaluations of the peseta, and the more general 
disenchantment with the integration process. 
  Spain has demonstrated its greater involvement in 
international affairs by sending troops to Bosnia, and taking 
part in other United Nations operations in Angola and 
Mozambique. Within the EU, it has pressed for more attention to 
be paid to future tensions in North Africa, with its growing 
populations and its political, religious and economic 
difficulties. 
  Officials concede that as a result of recent difficulties in 
the EU, and the recession, public enthusiasm for the process of 
European integration has waned in Spain. But Senor Serra says 
that enthusiasm would revive once the recession ended, and that 
Spain continues to believe in monetary union. "Europe has to 
deepen both its economic and its political union. That will 
give Spain a stronger position."

   A powerful explosion tore through the
headquarters of the paramilitary Civil Guard shortly before midnight
Tuesday, killing one person and wounding 45, officials said.
   Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera said a small van parked on
the sidewalk next to the Civil Guard headquarters exploded at 11:48
p.m. (5:48 p.m. EST) in a residential neighborhood.
   He said the dead man was an unidentified civilian.
   Corcuera said there were unconfirmed reports that the blast
killed a 2-year-old boy who had been riding in a car with his father
and mother, a surgeon and a nurse, when the blast occurred.
   Corcuera said the mother, who was reported in very critical
condition, could be pregnant.
   He said about 45 people suffered injuries and that most had been
treated for cuts and bruises and released. He said about 10 people
still were hospitalized in critical condition.
   The minister said the occupants of the van parked it on the
sidewalk and immediately ran towards another waiting vehicle that
drove away. The van exploded shortly afterwards.
   The getaway vehicle was located a short time later in a nearby
park, where police destroyed it as a precaution.
   A Civil Guard spokesman said 141 Civil Guards lived in the
barracks.
   Witnesses reported nearby buildings were heavily damaged,
including a convent and a restaurant. Callers throughout Madrid told
radio stations they heard the blast.
   No one immediately took responsibility, but suspicion fell on the
militant separatist organization ETA, the acronym for ``Homeland and
Liberty'' in the Basque language.
   Police in Bilbao in northern Spain said an explosion at a French
auto dealership happened about an hour before the Madrid blast,
causing extensive damage but no injuries.
   Officials said they believed the Madrid explosion was caused by a
car bomb filled with explosives parked near a dormitory for Civil
Guard cadets.
   The ETA exploded a car bomb at the same building in May 1987,
killing a woman passer-by.
   The organization has claimed at least 600 victims, many of them
Civil Guards, in its 20-year campaign to gain independence for the
three-province northern Spanish Basque country.
   On Nov. 2, the ETA offered to stop attacks for 60 days if the
government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez agreed to begin
discussions in Algeria over the future of the Basque country.
   Gonzalez dismissed the offer as a ``macabre ploy.'' The offer was
made three days after the ETA released a businessman held hostage
for 248 days.
   Gonzalez and President Francois Mitterrand of France were to meet
Wednesday at an annual Franco-Spanish summit in Montpellier, France.
Ways of dealing with ETA terrorism was one item on their agenda.
   So far this year ETA has claimed responsibility for 14 deaths.
   On Dec. 11, a car bomb set by ETA at a Civil Guard barracks in
Zaragoza killed 11 people, including five children. In June 1987,
ETA exploded a car bomb in a Barcelona supermarket that killed 21
people, all of them civilians.

   Basque political leaders on Sunday
called for an independent state as thousands marked the national
day of the violence-torn region.
   Police said more than 20,000 people attended rallies held by the
northern three-province region's four main nationalist parties,
which hold 53 of 75 seats in the regional parliament.
   ``These are manifestations of a single reality _ our will to be
a nation and to decide our fate by ourselves,'' said regional
parliament leader Jose Antonio Ardanza in San Sebastian. The
rallies commemorated Aberri Eguna, which translates from the
ancient Basque language as Day Of The Basque Motherland.
   More than 10,000 people sang the Basque national anthem and
chanted pro-independence slogans at a march in Pamplona, capital of
the neighboring region of Navarre. Some nationalists want Navarre
to be part of any future Basque state.
   Ardanza, addressing a rally in San Sebastian attended by
thousands of members of his Basque Nationalist Party, criticized
his Socialist coalition partners for failing to support a
pro-independence proclamation signed Feb. 15 by the his party and
three others.
   Another proclamation in 1987 denounced terrorism. The only
regional party that refused to sign the terrorism proclamation was
the Herri Batasuna, widely considered the political arm of the
armed separatist group ETA. ETA has claimed responsibility for
nearly all of the more than 600 killings in political violence in
22 years.
   Under Spain's 1978 constitution, the three Basque provinces,
which have more than 2.1 million inhabitants, form one of the
countries 17 ``autonomous communities.'' But their true autonomy is
limited since they are dependent on the Madrid government for
nearly all their funds and lack formal representation in a national
legislative body.

<TEXT>
TWO CAR bombs in central Madrid yesterday, which killed seven people and
injured 25, bore the hallmarks of the Basque separatist group, Eta, which
was previously believed to have been cornered and disarmed.
Eta received a setback in general elections this month when its political
front organisation, Herri Batasuna, lost two of the four seats it had held
in parliament.
The group could have been seeking to put pressure on the Basque Nationalist
party, PNV - the main political group in the northern Basque region, which
is this week considering an invitation issued by prime minister Felipe
Gonzalez to join a coalition government.
The car bombs exploded during the morning rush hour four blocks and 45
minutes apart. The first killed five senior military officers, a sergeant
and a civilian driver who were travelling in an unmarked minibus to general
staff headquarters. The second blast severely injured several pedestrians
close to the US embassy and the residence of the French ambassador.
The explosions were the first in Madrid in a year, and came at a time when
Eta activity had been low. Several gunmen have been detained recently and
the organisation's commander, arrested in France last year, was jailed for
10 years by a Paris court last Friday.

   Three suspected Basque separatists shot and
killed a paramilitary civil guard Wednesday and fled in a stolen
car.
   Bomb experts in Madrid, meanwhile, defused a letter bomb sent to
Justice Minister Enrique Mugica, ministry sources said.
   No group claimed responsibility for the attacks. But police said
they bore the earmarks of the Basque separatist organization ETA,
which has renewed attacks on government targets after a breakdown
in peace talks with the government of Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez.
   The Vizcaya province civil governor's office said two men and a
woman gunned down Jose Calvo de la Hoz, 51, on a street in the
northern city of Guecho, eight miles from Bilbao. He died an hour
later of head wounds.
   The getaway car was not immediately located, but police found
its owner in Lejona, where the assailants handcuffed him and left
him tied to a tree.
   ETA, an acronym for homeland and liberty in the Basque language,
has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people, mostly
military and police officers, in its 21-year campaign for
self-determination for Spain's three-province northern Basque
region.
   The group halted its attacks in January in return for peace
talks with the government. ETA ended the moratorium on April 4,
however, and renewed the bomb attacks. On Monday, the government
called off the talks.
   ``We will use all means at our disposal to battle this
phenomenon,'' Gonzalez, referring to ETA, told Spanish National
Radio.
   ETA sent a statement early Wednesday to the Basque daily Egin in
which it claimed responsibility for five package-bombs sent since
Friday to Spanish officials and military targets.
   It also took responsibility for eight bombs set off Saturday on
a rail line linking the Basque region's capital, Vitoria, with
neighboring Navarre. The bombs caused heavy damage but no injuries.
   ETA said it planned to set off bombs on the Madrid-Seville and
Madrid-Valencia rail lines between midnight Thursday and midnight
Saturday.
   An ETA package-bomb exploded Monday at a military training
school in the Pyrenees mountains of northern Spain, seriously
injuring a sergeant. Another blew up Friday in an apartment in the
Basque town of Irun, injuring a high school gym teacher who lost
part of one arm and the fingers of a hand.
   Authorities defused three package bombs sent to government and
military officials on Monday and Tuesday.

<TEXT>
MR Jordi Pujol, leader of the Catalan nationalists, and Mr Xavier Arzallus,
leader of the Basque nationalists, are likely to get the electoral result
later this year that they have been waiting for ever since democracy was
reintroduced to post-Franco Spain. The prospect of a hung parliament
converts their regionally-based minority parties into powerbrokers.
Polls suggest that the governing Socialist party will do well to hold 160
seats in congress, 15 short of an overall majority, when general elec- tions
are held in five or six months' time. Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime
minister, could therefore be forced to rely on the 18-odd members that Mr
Pujol's Convergencia i Unio (CiU) party returns to the Madrid parliament
and, con- ceivably, on the five to six that are returned by Mr Arzallus'
Partido Nacionalista Vasco (PNV).
With current voting trends showing a clear swing to the centre-right
opposition party, the Partido Popular (PP), the two nationalist leaders may
even find themselves being courted by both the main political groups.
Wooing the nationalists will not be an agreeable task for the Socialists or,
should it come to that, for the PP.
Mr Pujol and Mr Arzallus are essentially single issue politicians. Rooted in
the mystique of their respective cultures and traditions, which they view as
the objects of sustained harassment down the ages by Madrid centralism, they
want nothing, more nor less, than ever-increasing self-government for their
communities.
Given the choice, Mr Pujol and Mr Arzallus would prefer an association with
Mr Gonzalez. When they are not abstaining in the Madrid parliament, the CiU
and the PNV have tended to side with the governing party and the PNV has for
years maintained a somewhat testy relationship with the Socialists in the
Basque Country where the two parties govern in coalition, the Socialists as
junior partners.
However, neither nationalist leader is at all anxious to join a Gonzalez-led
coalition government. Should they do so, they would risk losing their
conservative supporters - the CiU and the PNV have a strong Christian
Democrat component - and they would also be challenged by the more committed
nationalist minority parties in both Catalonia and the Basque Country.
A tacit support in parliament is the most that Mr Gonzalez can expect. Mr
Pujol has said that the Catalan nationalists can be relied upon to ensure
the governance of Spain but he left unsaid, because it did not need saying,
that the price for doing so would be a set of assurances that would allow
him to govern Catalonia with as little interference as possible.
Such a federal-weighted scenario need not be as grim as some Madrid-based
politicians and political pundits make out. It would acknowledge the reality
of a multinational Spain and replace the often bruising confrontation of the
past with a hands-off and respectful collaboration.

<HEAD>Basque Separatists Claim Bombing Deaths of Policeman, Civil Guard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILBAO, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Basque separatist group ETA claimed
responsibility today for the bombing deaths last week of a Basque
policeman and a paramilitary Civil Guard.
   In a statement sent to local papers, ETA said it had planted a
bomb that exploded in a train tunnel early Sunday in Legazpi, near
the Basque city of San Sebastian, instantly killing Jose Juan
Pacheco Cano, 26.
   Pacheco Cano, a member of the autonomous Basque region's police
unit, the Ertzantza, had joined in a search for bombs after a local
travel bureau received a warning that explosives had been planted
in the area.
   In the second attack, a car bomb exploded late Sunday as a unit
of the paramilitary Civil Guard passed by near the Pamplona,
Navarre, city jail. The driver, Julio Gangoso, 31, was killed and
seven others were injured.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque country and annexation of the neighboring Navarre
region.
   Since beginning its violent campaign for independence in 1968,
ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people,
mainly police, military and Civil Guard officers.
   So far this year ETA has claimed 13 killings, including that of
Pacheco Cano, the first officer of the autonomous Basque region's
police unit to die in an ETA attack.
   In its note ETA called the latter's death ``an accident.''

<TEXT>
   A 2-year-old boy died today of a shrapnel
wound to the head from a car bomb that ripped through the national
headquarters of the paramilitary Civil Guard, officials said. He was
the second fatality.
   The explosives-packed van was detonated just before midnight
Tuesday. It instantly killed a 38-year-old Madrid man who was
driving nearby and injured 44 people, nine critically, police said.
   Nine of the 141 Civil Guards living in the headquarters were
slightly injured, police and hospital officials said.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Interior
Ministry spokesmen said today that the attack bore the earmarks of
ETA, the Basque separatist organization.
   Luis Delgado Villalonga, 2, died this morning after eight hours
of treatment, said a spokesman for Clinico Hospital. The child was
hit by shrapnel while he was riding in a car with his parents, who
remained in critical condition with severe head injuries,
authorities said.
   Interior Minister Jose Luis Corcuera told reporters the bombers
parked an explosives-packed van on the sidewalk next to the
building, then ran to a stolen getaway car and apparently triggered
the blast seconds later by remote control. Police located the stolen
getaway car about two hours later, and exploded it as a precaution.
   The explosion tore a hole 15 feet in diameter through one wall of
the three-story headquarters, collapsing several ceilings. It
heavily damaged nearby buildings, including a convent and apartments
across from it, and shattered most windows within half a mile.
   An Interior Ministry spokesman said the van was loaded with about
200 pounds of explosives and a large amoung of shrapnel and
destroyed more than 20 cars. It could be heard across the capital of
4 million residents.
   About the same time as Tuesday's explosion, suspected Basque
separatists set off three bombs in and near the northern Basque city
of Bilbao, seriously damaging three French car dealerships but
causing no injuries, police said.
   ETA has claimed at least 600 victims, many of them Civil Guards,
in its 20-year campaign to gain independence for the three-province
northern Spanish Basque country.
   So far this year, ETA has claimed responsibility for attacks
killing 14 people.
   ETA claimed responsibility for a similar car bomb attack on the
same Civil Guard building in May 1987 that killed a woman passerby.
   Last month, it offered to stop attacks for 60 days if the
government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez would begin discussions
in Algeria on the future of the Basque region.
   Gonzalez rejected the Nov. 2 offer, which came three days after
ETA released a hostage. The Basque group held the businessman for
248 days after his family paid an estimated $10 million ransom.

FT  27 OCT 92 / Gonzalez, for richer and poorer: Why 10 years under the
Socialists has given some Spanish workers cause to celebrate, and others to
protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPANISH government had a good day on Sunday, celebrating 10 years of
rule by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's Spanish Socialist Workers party at
a massive rally in Madrid's main bullring. Mr Gonzalez announced he would
stand for re-election next year and said that what Spain needed most was
another 10 years of Socialist government.
Yesterday was less comfortable. Nearly 1,000 steelworkers who have walked
from northern Spain in protest at plans to cut 9,700 jobs and 1.5m tonnes of
capacity from the state's two integrated steelmakers in Asturias and the
Basque country arrived in Madrid. They were joined by another 10,000
protesters outside the industry ministry.
It might be going too far to suggest that some of the people in the bullring
on Sunday were outside the ministry last night, but what was being
celebrated and what was being protested are, in essence, the same thing.
The 10 years of Socialist government have been about preparing Spain for
life alongside the leading economies of the European Community and that has
meant raising the living standards and increasing the wealth of its
citizens.
But as the steel march starkly showed, it has also been about making some of
them poorer. Spain does not have an industrial policy as such but the state
owns a lot of industrial companies - from steel to shipbuilding, coal,
avionics, electricity and airlines - which, no matter how hard Madrid tries
to leave them to the markets, keep demanding its intervention or support.
This year Madrid merged its Asturian integrated steelmaker, Ensidesa, with
Altos Hornos de Vizcaya, which has a large plant near Bilbao. It drew up a
neat, almost bold, plan to trim their combined 24,500-strong workforce and
to cut steel output from 6m tonnes a year to 4.5m tonnes.
It assumed it could combine two Asturian sites into one, keeping some blast
furnaces in the port of Gijon open, and shutting those in nearby Aviles. The
Gijon furnaces would then send molten steel to be cast in a modern steel
shop in Aviles.
At AHV, all the furnaces would be closed but Bilbao would get, instead, the
world's biggest mini-mill which, through melting scrap in giant electric
furnaces, would produce about 900,000 tonnes of steel a year. The costs of
the jobs cuts and the new mill would be a huge Dollars 6bn.
Both Ensidesa and AHV are high-cost producers of relatively common products
which could be more cheaply imported from northern EC competitors. Their
combined losses in 1991 and this year will be Dollars 1.3bn.
But the spread of the vote that has kept Mr Gonzalez in power for a decade
makes it imperative that steelmaking continue in the Basque country and
Asturias, which is a powerful Socialist stronghold and heavily dependent on
subsidised steel and coal jobs.
The Socialists are strong in the Basque country, too, but, even more
important, might require the support in parliament in Madrid of the ruling
Basque party if, as seems likely, Mr Gonzalez's PSOE does not win a majority
at the next general election.
Thus, the opposition of the EC's competition commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan,
to the steel plan came as a rude shock to Madrid this month. Sir Leon, whose
job it is to ensure that European industries are not unfairly subsidised,
tried to persuade his fellow commissioners to have the Bilbao mini-mill and
a further 800 jobs cut from Spain's plans.
Last week the Commission compromised and asked Spain to find its own further
cuts, either in jobs, capacity or subsidies - the implicit warning being
that if it did not, industry ministers would reject the plan on November 24.
Madrid, then, is caught between Asturian and Basque anger at its original
plan, and the need to make even deeper cuts. An 'industrial shuttle', in
which Madrid's industry minister will try to win support for its plan from
sceptical EC partners in Britain, France and Germany before November 24,
begins this week.
It may work, but if 9,700 steel job cuts, spread over six years, cause this
much trouble, how will Spain ever trim its state industries before economic
and monetary union (Emu), to which Spain is still committed, in 1999? The
INI, the state industrial holding company, has just announced plans to shed
20,000 jobs in four years, when, at best, only 25 per cent of INI's 140,000
employees work in profitable companies.
But the day is not far off when the current trade off between votes and jobs
will become untenable. Not yet, though. This is an election year and Sir
Leon has given Madrid a perfect opportunity to tell the steelworkers that it
is, despite all appearances, fighting to save jobs.

<HEAD>Moderate Nationalists Finish First in Basque Region</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VITORIA, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The moderate Basque Nationalist Party was
the top finisher in regional elections, according to results
announced today. The outcome was seen as a rejection of a radical
independence movement.
   The Basque Nationalists won 22 seats in the 75-member regional
parliament. The Socialists, their governing partners for the past
four years, won 16 seats.
   Between them, the two parties have 38 seats, enough for a
one-seat majority. Previously, the Socialists had the larger bloc
of seats in the coalition.
   The Herri Batasuna or Popular Union party, widely considered the
political arm of the Basque nationalist terrorist group ETA,
finished with 13 seats, the same number it had already held.
   Several Basque newspaper editorials called the results a vote of
confidence for the current coalition government and an endorsement
of the strategy of seeking greater autonomy but not independence
from Madrid.
   There were no reports of political violence during Sunday's
voting in the northern three-province region. All the parties
except Herri Batasuna formally renounced violence in 1987.
   During the campaign, the Basque Nationalists and Socialists both
stressed political stability and economic recovery over the
autonomy issue.
   In Sunday's voting, the Basque Nationalists gained five seats
over their share from the last regional elections in 1986, while
the Socialists lost three seats.
   In other results, the conservative Popular Party, the chief
opposition party in the national parliament, won six seats, gaining
four. The conservative Union Alavesa, formed recently from
nationalists within the Popular Party, won three seats.
   The biggest losers were two leftist nationalist parties. Eusko
Alkartasuna lost four seats to finish with nine, and Euskadiko
Ezkerra's share dropped from nine to six seats.
   The Madrid-based Democratic and Social Center party, led by
former Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez, virtually disappeared from the
political map. The party, which won two seats in the 1986 election,
garnered less than 1 percent of the vote and failed to win a single
seat.
   Officials said 61 percent of the 1.8 million registered voters
cast ballots.

<F P=106> [Article by Victor Cardoso] </F>
  [Text] Jon Imanol Azua Mendia, government vice president of 
the autonomous Basque country, confirmed that no known member of 
the separatist organization ETA [Basque Fatherland and Liberty] 
is in Mexico; that there is no known link with local subversive 
groups; and that the Mexican Government has never asked for 
special advisers to combat terrorist activities. 
  In a news conference at the conclusion of his eight-day 
official visit to Mexico, the representative of the Basque 
Government stated there is no information, proof, or indication 
that the ETA had anything to do with the events that shook 
Mexico this year. "If any known member of the ETA were in 
Mexico, he would have been identified and completely controlled. 
We have to admit, however, that clandestine organizations also 
have unidentified leaders, but they are always tracked down," he 
said. 
  He explained that the Mexican authorities and police 
exchange 
data with their counterparts in Spain and the Basque country, 
which he considered normal and based on signed agreements. He 
added that no specific action had been requested by the Mexican 
Government. 
  Azua Mendia condemned violence and said dialogue is the best 
path for finding solutions to any kind of problem. "There is no 
place in any country for violence or the use of violent methods 
because such things are insane and distort the main goals of any 
struggle," he expressed. 
  Well versed in Mexican affairs as he has lived here for 
several years, Azua Mendia made light of newspaper reports 
implicating former Government Secretary Fernando Gutierrez 
Barrios in illegal activities. He denied that Spanish media are 
waging a campaign to discredit either Mexico or its politicians. 
"I do not agree with the opinions expressed by much of the 
media, although one could surmise that they are looking for the 
reasons behind the events in the country. Nevertheless, they are 
still nothing more than newspaper articles," he said. 
  "In general, there is confidence and a positive impression 
of 
Mexico abroad. Events throughout the year could have initially 
shaken the confidence of the international community, but the 
country's opening process, the signing of the free trade 
agreement, and Mexico's recent inclusion in the OECD are proof 
that this process is irreversible. All of these factors 
increase confidence that Mexico is a sure bet for the future," 
Azua added. 
  Remarking on his visit, Azua Mendia said an agreement was 
reached with Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe to operate a Basque 
financial institution once the secretariat establishes the norms 
for foreign bank operations in Mexico. Azua also spoke with 
Foreign Secretary Manuel Tello, with whom he discussed relations 
between Spain and Mexico, particularly trade and the 
possibilities for foreign investment raised by NAFTA.

<HEAD>Thousands March For Government Negotiations With ETA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILBAO, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands marched in a cold, heavy rain
through the center of this restive northern city Saturday, demanding
the government open talks with the Basque separatist group ETA.
   The march, which authorities said drew an estimated 18,000
people, was organized by the radical Basque nationalist party Herri
Batasuna, widely considered the political arm of ETA.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for more than 600 deaths since
1968, when it began fighting for independence for the three-province
northern Basque region.
   The demonstrators carried a wide banner bearing the phrase ``for
the negotiation toward peace'' and shouted slogans in favor of ETA
and for negotiations.
   The march was peaceful and guarded by national police, said Julio
Ignacio Campuzano, a spokesman of the Vizcaya province civil
governor's office.
   ETA, an acronym for Basque land and liberty in the Basque
language, declared Jan. 8 it would stop attacks for 15 days to press
the government to enter negotiations on the future of the Basque
region.
   But the government of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
has asked ETA for an indefinite ``cease-fire'' as a condition for
resuming talks cut off a year ago after an ETA attack, according to
a report published in the leading Madrid daily El Pais.
   El Pais, citing government sources, reported Jan. 15 the talks
were to be resumed in Algeria where Eugenio ``Antxon'' Etxebeste and
other leaders of the organization are exiled.

   A gunman killed a restaurant worker today
as he served coffee to customers, and police blamed the attack on
Basque separatists.
   The gunman fled in a car after shooting Jose Luis Barrios in the
San Jorge Restaurant, police said. The 34-year-old, whose father
owns the restaurant, was the only person hurt in the attack at 1
a.m.
   An anonymous caller who said he spoke for the Basque separatist
organization ETA told a traveler's bureau in Santurce that a man
whose car had been stolen was tied to a tree in the nearby town of
Baracaldo.
   Police later located the man who said two men had stolen his car
at gunpoint at 10 p.m. Friday. Police were checking to determine if
the stolen car was used by the gunman who carried out the killing.
   Police did not know why the attacker singled out Barrios or the
San Jorge Restaurant, which is owned by Prospero Barrios, a former
Socialist city councilman in Santurce.
   The caller did not claim responsibility for the killing on
behalf of ETA, which seeks independence from Spain for the
three-province northern Basque region. Since taking up arms in
1968, ETA has taken responsibility for killing 600 people, mainly
police, military and paramilitary Civil Guard officers.
   So far this year, ETA has claimed responsibility for attacks
that have killed 10 people in the Basque country, including a
discotheque owner and a restaurant owner who ETA said were involved
in drug trafficking.

<F P=106> [Interview with Jose Antonio Ardanza, head of the Basque </F>
autonomous government, by Jose Luis Barberia; place and date not 
given: "Jose Antonio Ardanza"] 
  [Text] San Sebastian--The question whether the PNV [Basque 
Nationalist Party] has substantially modified its "line" has 
reemerged in conjunction with all the furor stirred up in recent 
weeks by combative public statements from party spokespersons. 
  [Barberia] What's happened to make your party, the PNV, 
harden its line lately? 
  [Ardanza] My party has not changed its line, but after seven 
years in which not a single statutory transfer [to the regional 
autonomous government] was implemented, we are really tired of 
waiting, and we find it intolerable that the socialist party 
continues tinkering endlessly with obligatory, mandated 
legislation such as the Statute of Guernica, which was endorsed 
in a referendum. 
  [Barberia] Isn't it true that the underlying basis of all 
the 
polemics is the breakdown of negotiations on the general budget 
bill and PNV's participation in the Madrid government? 
  [Ardanza] After seven years it seemed only reasonable that 
the PNV should get rapid progress on autonomy, at a time when it 
was being asked to make larger commitments and was even offered 
the possibility of participation in a hypothetical coalition 
government. But the socialists' response was to say there would 
be no movement on autonomy legislation until the PNV promises 
this will be the last demand. In other words, they want us to 
renounce our nationalist ideology, to yield to their cynical 
attempts at blackmail. 
  [Barberia] More than the issue of suspended transfers per 
se, 
what the central government and the PSOE [Spanish Socialist 
Workers Party] seem to reject is the PNV's interpretation of 
some of these reforms. 
  [Ardanza] During those seven years, we told the socialists 
again and again that we were prepared, on these pending matters, 
to accept the interpretations they themselves made back in 1979, 
when they asked the Basque people to vote for the law. The 
response, equally cynical, has been that that interpretation is 
obsolete. Under the circumstances, it seems to me the PNV has 
shown ample restraint and moderation. 
  [Barberia] As the highest official in the [Basque] 
autonomous 
community, do you think it proper and politically prudent to 
say, as spokesmen for your party have been quoted recently, that 
the king should not rely on bayonets alone, that the monarch 
gave a "humorous" talk, that the army is an obstacle to 
self-determination, and that the Civil Guard is a loathsome 
apparatus? 
  [Ardanza] Look, I'm not going to get into making specific 
judgments about what people have said or not said. What 
surprises me is the scandal people are trying to make of it. 
What is scandalous in my own opinion is that the Civil Guard 
have set up humiliating roadblocks everywhere, that they 
mistreat a mayor in full view of his own townspeople, throw him 
down on the ground, kick him and hold him with his arms crossed 
for two full hours. There comes a time when you have to say: 
"This has got to stop." I'm not going to deny that some people, 
myself included, may have spoken too harshly on occasion; what 
surprises me, though, is that they should spend an hour in a 
press conference denouncing what after all was only a single 
sentence. 
  [Barberia] And what do you have to say about the debate on 
self-determination, all the references to the Ulster accord? 
  [Ardanza] We weren't the ones to raise that issue. We have 
other priorities, other urgent issues, such as progress on 
autonomy and above all recession and unemployment. But what 
happens? Well, we are constantly raked over the coals and 
besieged with demands to take a position on that issue. And we 
are Basque nationalists! For us, self-determination is a 
legitimate right, recognized by international bodies. So why is 
it so scandalous? Why is it that this and other subjects are 
considered taboo here in Spain? Is it because Spain's democracy 
is not fully established and normalized? Truly, one begins to 
have doubts, when all it takes to stir up an immediate scandal 
is to say something about the army. 
  [Barberia] Do you think these polemics are artificial--in 
other words, that there's an element of hypocrisy here? 
  [Ardanza] What I believe is this: There are lots of 
conjuring 
tricks going on here, since at the same time both of Spain's 
largest political parties have lost their ideological moorings, 
or so it seems. In the last analysis, one has the impression 
that the socialist party is just a machine that exists to 
perpetuate itself in government and parcel out power. The crisis 
in the PSOE today--and it is one of the state's biggest 
problems--has nothing to do with ideology: It's all about the 
allocation and control of power. 
  [Barberia] As the description of a political party, that's a 
fairly harsh judgment.... 
  [Ardanza] They vacillate between frontal opposition and 
compromise, depending--as far as I can tell--on changes in the 
opinion polls. I'm not saying it's not legitimate, but I think 
that's how it is. 
  [Barberia] Is there any justification for the comparisons 
being made between the "Irish case" and the so-called Basque 
problem? 
  [Ardanza] All I can say is, it's worth reflecting on the 
method chosen by the governments of two democratic countries, 
the United Kingdom and Ireland, to deal with a political 
conflict that has lasted more than 70 years. They signed a 
document in which they acknowledged that the road to peace is 
based on the right of the inhabitants of Ulster to 
self-determination. And this I know: No one there was 
scandalized by the proposal that the Ulsterites decide, 
democratically, whether they want to continue as a province of 
the United Kingdom or become a part of the Republic of Ireland. 
Ulster is not in Africa, neither is it a colony; it's in Europe, 
quite close to us. 
  [Barberia] Leaders of your party have alluded to possible 
Civil Guard opposition to deployment of the Ertzaintza [Basque 
Autonomous Police] in Guipuzcoa, while spokesmen for the 
government have said the presence of Ertzaintza will not mean 
reduced deployments of other security forces. Do we have here 
the germ of a new conflict? 
  [Ardanza] No. We continue to rely on the parliamentary 
accords and the agreements signed between the [Interior] 
Ministry and the Basque department of interior. 
  [Barberia] What is your opinion of the personnel shake-ups 
in 
Interior and the changes Asuncion seems to want to introduce in 
the struggle against terrorism? 
  [Ardanza] Asuncion has assured us categorically that nothing 
is changed. We'll just have to wait and see. 
  [Barberia] Not even respecting the PNV's erstwhile contacts 
with ETA-HB [Basque Fatherland and Liberty Group/Herri Batasuna]? 
  [Ardanza] I rely on the minister's own words, when he 
attested to the necessity of our collaboration. But the mistake 
was to formulate a political proposal. The state cannot avoid 
the obligation it has to democratic nationalists to fully 
implement the requisite legislation, which, I repeat, is 
mandatory and was offered to violent extremists in exchange for 
a truce. That is a violation of the Ajuria Enea pact. 
  [Barberia] Do you think the hopes once vested in the 
so-called Azkoiti track have come to naught? Are we sure they 
don't know who's now in charge of the ETA? 
  [Ardanza] I share the impression that ETA no longer has a 
nucleus capable of getting the entire organization to move in a 
particular direction. As to the first question, I cannot speak 
of failures or successes in absolute terms. These are processes 
whose effectiveness can only be determined after the problem is 
overcome. 
  [Barberia] The last elections substantially altered the 
Basque political landscape. Do you view the advances made by 
nonnationalist Basque parties as temporary, or are they 
indicative of a putative withering away of nationalist supremacy? 
  [Ardanza] It's not very scientific to build whole theories 
on 
the results of a handful of electoral races.

   Doctors said a retired naval officer
was in a coma Friday after he was shot in the head and neck during
an attack blamed on Basque separatists.
   Lt. Aureliano Rodriguez, 65, was shot Thursday by two men
outside his home in this northern Basque city. Police suspect the
attackers belong to the armed Basque separatist group ETA, Spanish
National Radio said.
   Rodriguez suffered brain damage and remained in ``very serious''
condition after five hours of surgery, doctors said at San
Sebastian hospital.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people
in its 21-year-old drive for independence of the three-province
Basque region.
   A single ETA member is believed to have mailed four package
bombs this week, including those that seriously wounded a national
court judge Tuesday and an employee at Madrid's main post office
the next day, the daily El Pais said.
   The initials ETA stand for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language.

<HEAD>Former Head Of Basque Government-In-Exile Dead At 92</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesus Maria de Leizaola, who headed
the Basque government-in-exile for nearly two decades during the
dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco, has died. He was 92.
   A statement by doctors at Guipuzcoa hospital in this Basque
provincial capital said Leizaola died at 11:30 p.m. Thursday, an
hour after he was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment
following a heart attack.
   Leizaola was a member of parliament under the democratic republic
that existed from 1931 to 1939. The Spanish Civil War broke out in
1936 and Franco's nationalist troops were victorious in 1939.
   Leizaola served as Basque justice and culture commissioner during
the war and went into exile in France in 1937.
   He became head the Basque autonomous government-in-exile in 1960.
Franco died in 1975 and Spain became a parliamentary monarchy.
Leizaola returned to Spain in 1979 and symbolically handed over
power of the regional government for northern Basque region.
   Leizaola was born Sept. 7, 1896, in San Sebastian, the Basque
capital.
   Leizaola had predicted before returning to Spain that the
re-establishment of a Basque autonomous government, which occurred
in 1979, would eliminate ETA, the separatist group that has claimed
responsibility for killing more than 600 people since it took up
arms in 1968.
   ``When full autonomy takes effect, ETA will disappear like a
tumor that cures itself spontaneously,'' he said in an interview in
Paris.
   He died as the government and ETA, which stands for Homeland and
Liberty in the Basque language, were holding negotiations in Algeria
to end the killing and two days before hundreds of thousands were
expected to march in the biggest peace demonstration in Basque
country's history.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<TEXT>
   A statement published in a newspaper
Sunday claimed the Basque separatist organization ETA killed an
army officer in Madrid last week and seriously wounded his driver.
   The officer, Lt. Col. Jose Maria Martinez Moreno, was killed
Friday and his 20-year-old driver, Alfonso de los Reyes, was shot
in the neck by men who attacked their military vehicle at one of
Madrid's busiest intersections.
   The claim of responsibility, in the form of a note, was printed
in Egin, a newspaper in the northern city of San Sebastian.
   The note also claimed ETA responsibility for the slaying of a
man in Bilbao who died Wednesday when a bomb blew up his truck. The
statement claimed that Ignacio Banuelos Laso, 26, was slain because
he was a drug trafficker.
   ETA, whose initials stand for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, has killed 17 people this year in its 11-year-old
campaign to gain self-determination for the three-province northern
Spanish Basque country.

FT  09 NOV 94 / Basque steel plant's retreat raises fears: A new threat not
linked to terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cheaper energy in France has prompted a leading steel company in Spain's
Basque country to cross the frontier and invest Pta11.2bn (Pounds 55m) in a
new plant in Bayonne.
The decision by the family-owned Marcial Ucn group, which makes rods and
long bars for the construction industry, adds a new dimension to Spanish
fears about falling competitiveness. These concerns were fuelled earlier
this year by the relocation plans of the loss-making Spanish subsidiaries of
Gillette, the US consumer products multinational, and of Suzuki, the
Japanese vehicle maker.
The move also has political overtones for the Basque government, led by the
local nationalist party. Yesterday, it accused the Madrid authorities of
forcing companies out of the area by failing to frame a coherent industrial
policy.
The Bayonne plant, one of the largest single production investments for many
years by a Spanish private company, will produce 900,000 tonnes of crude
steel a year. This may prove troublesome to the Spanish government, which is
planning to build a mini-mill of roughly similar capacity in the Basque port
city of Bilbao, an hour's drive away.
'This is a very serious development because we are losing business instead
of attracting it,' said Professor Ignacio Marco of Deusto University, the
Bilbao business school, and former chairman of the Basque Energy Board. 'It
is a very big investment by a leading local company that has always been
closely identified with the Basque steel industry.'
But Mr Enrique Portocarrero, an executive of the Circulo de Empresarios
Vascos, a Basque employers' association, said the investment was more a
psychological than an economic blow. 'I doubt we are going to see a flight
of Basque industry to the other side of the Pyrenees,' he said.
Marcial Ucn opted for Bayonne despite strong pressure from local
authorities. The latter were willing to subsidise up to 30 per cent of the
investment if the plant remained in the Spanish Basque province of
Guipuzcoa, alongside the French border, where the company has its
headquarters and where four of its seven Spanish plants are located.
The steel manufacturer said the attraction of Bayonne lay in the fact that
electricity in France costs 20 per cent less than in Spain - mini-mills melt
scrap metal with huge charges of electricity. French scrap metal was also
cheaper and Bayonne had offered it a site near the harbour. It will begin
building the plant in 1996 in a venture with the Japanese Mitsui group,
which will provide 25 per cent of the money.
In order to soften the impact, however, Marcial Ucn said it would also
invest Pta4bn in its Guipuzcoa plants to increase productivity and maintain
the 850-strong labour force.
Spain's high electricity prices have been consistently criticised by
manufacturers based in the frontier zones of the Basque country and
Catalonia which are barred from hooking up directly to the French grid by
the government's monopoly over the import of France's nuclear-based energy.
The competitive disadvantage became a serious issue in the recent Basque
elections when the local nationalist party criticised Madrid.
Prof Marco says: 'We are being made to compete with Europe and we are
strapped by high inputs at every stage, from electricity tariffs to harbour
fees, and from high interest rates to labour costs.'

   A bomb believed set by Basque separatists
killed a national police officer today as he started the engine of
his car in Algorta, a town about 20 miles from this northern Basque
city, authorities said.
   Officials of the provincial Bilbao civil governor's office said
the car was parked near the home of the police officer, 49-year-old
Eladio Rodriguez Garcia.
   The officials, who were not identified in keeping with custom,
said they suspected the bomb was planted by members of the Basque
separatist organization ETA, which has been blamed for 15
assassinations in Spain so far this year.
   ETA has killed more than 600 people, mostly military and police
officers since it started a violent campaign for independence of
the three-province Basque country from Spain in 1968.

   A mail bomb linked to Basque separatists
exploded Friday at a brokerage firm in this Mediterranean port,
killing the manager and injuring five other people, a government
spokesman said.
   Juan Antonio Perez Herrero, 35, died in Valencia General
Hospital nearly six hours after the bomb went off at 12:15 p.m. in
the office of Intermediarios Financieros, according to the
spokesman, Manuel Miralles.
   The package was delivered to the office in this city 185 miles
south of Barcelona by a courier carrier.
   The spokesman said Perez Herrero and the other injured were
rushed to the hospital after the blast, which blew out the windows
of the second-story office.
   Four people were later released after being treatment for cuts
and bruises. The fifth remained in the hospital under observation.
   Although no group immediately claimed reponsibility for the
attack, officials said it bore the hallmarks of the Basque
separatist group ETA. The group has been behind other mail bombs in
recent weeks.
   ETA has staged a campaign of terror since 1968 to win
independence for the three-province northern Spanish Basque
country. ETA's name comes from initials in the Basque language
standing for ``homeland and liberty.''
   Perez Herrero's death brought to seven the number of terrorist
murders in Spain this year. ETA has claimed responsibility for five
of the deaths.
   On April 23, ETA sent two mail bombs to the Department of
Prisons in Madrid. One mangled the hand of an employee, and police
defused the second.
   On April 19, an ETA mail bomb seriously damaged the hand of a
woman working in Seville for Expo '92, the world's fair to be held
in 1992.
