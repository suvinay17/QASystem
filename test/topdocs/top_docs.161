Don Casey will return from New Jersey today without getting the job to coach at
Rider College but apparently in position to land a spot with the Clippers,
albeit not the one he wants.
</P>
<P>
Officials at Rider, the 3,000-enrollment Division I school in Lawrenceville,
N.J., have scheduled a news conference for today and are expected to name Kevin
Bannon of Trenton State in New Jersey as the new coach. He replaces John
Carpenter, who retired after 23 years but will remain as athletic director.
</P>
<P>
The Broncos went 5-23 last season while playing in the East Coast Conference.
Bob Dukiet, the former coach at Marquette, had also interviewed for the spot.
</P>
<P>
Casey, the Clippers' interim coach since Jan. 19, withdrew from consideration
for the Rider job and will meet with team officials early next week. No member
of Clipper management will comment publicly, but most seem to agree that he
will be offered some position, even if not head coach, his first preference.
</P>
<P>
There is a possibility that a front-office spot will be created for Casey that
will keep him involved in the team's day-to-day operations. SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER

JUDGE BLOCKS CHRISTMAS TREE LOT AT PIERCE;
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: THE COURT HEARING HAD SOME HOLIDAY TOUCHES, BUT THE RULING AGAINST
FARMER JOE CICERO PRESENTED HIM WITH HARD ECONOMIC REALITY.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Saying she regretted she had to play Scrooge, a Los Angeles Superior Court
judge stepped into the San Fernando Valley Christmas tree war Monday, ordering
farmer Joe Cicero not to sell Christmas trees on land he leases from Pierce
College.
</P>
<P>
The decision followed a courtroom clash with distinctive holiday touches, such
as discussions of sleigh rides, reindeer and the telltale signs of an illicit
Christmas tree lot -- the construction of tinsel-wrapped arches, candy-striped
poles, and green and white flags.
</P>
<P>
Yet there was a harsh economic reality in the ruling by Judge Dzintra A.
Janavs, granting the Los Angeles Community College District a temporary
restraining order against Cicero. He's stuck with 8,000 Christmas trees -- at a
cost of an estimated $120,000 -- and nowhere to sell them.
</P>
<P>
"This will be just devastating and catastrophic to my client," said Harold
Kippen, who represents the farmer, whose family has plowed Valley fields since
1947.
</P>
<P>
The victor was Miller &amp; Sons, one of the largest Christmas tree vendors in
California. The company has 40 lots, including one across the street from
Cicero's, which is on the campus in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
As owner Stu Miller and his lawyer tell it, the skirmish between the two men is
a simple case of free enterprise -- too free. Cicero pays the college district
about $15,000 to lease 25 acres of farmland at Pierce College, but was charged
nothing extra last year to add Christmas trees to his usual produce stand sales
of fruits, vegetables and Halloween pumpkins.
</P>
<P>
"They're getting something for nothing," said attorney Michael B. Scott, who
represents Miller. "My client is not out just to put Cicero out of business. .
. . All he wants is the right to bid on the property."
</P>
<P>
Miller, who estimated his annual statewide sales at 400,000 trees -- 85,000 in
the Valley alone -- said Cicero had caused him to lose at least 3,200 sales in
December, 1989. Despite assurances from the college that no trees would be sold
this year, he said his employees noticed tinseled arches and candy-striped
poles going up at Cicero's stand in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
Miller, who sold trees at the college in 1986 in cooperation with the
Associated Students Organization, said he has inquired annually since then
about the possibility of selling there again. Letters from college officials
filed with the court show that they repeatedly responded that they would not
allow tree sales on the property.
</P>
<P>
"We're not the big-guy bully," Miller said. "Joe Cicero's doing no more than
stealing our business."
</P>
<P>
But Kippen said it is just that: a case of the Goliaths -- Miller and the
college district -- trying to squash a Yuletide David.
</P>
<P>
Kippen conceded that Christmas trees were not in the five-year lease that
Cicero signed with the district in 1986; in fact, the lease only calls for the
sale of products grown on the land. But he said that since then, verbal
agreements were made between his client and college officials to allow sales of
other items, including pumpkins and trees.
</P>
<P>
"Look at all the kiddies who are going to be without their sleigh rides,"
Kippen said, referring to the rides Cicero offered on his lot last year.
</P>
<P>
The Miller lots sometimes feature live reindeer.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Cicero, with the college's support, succeeded in defeating an
identical request by Miller for a temporary restraining order. But in the
months that followed, the college switched sides, joining Miller. A series of
telephone calls and letters to Cicero followed, banning 1990 sales on college
property.
</P>
<P>
James Lynch, assistant general counsel for the college district, said the
change of mind was largely the result of a lawsuit by Miller against the
district. That suit, filed concurrently with the action taken against Cicero in
late 1989, alleged that the district fostered unfair competition by failing to
allow others to bid on the right to sell trees from the campus location, in
violation of state laws covering profit-making activities on public land.
</P>
<P>
"We have an obligation as a public agency to do what we feel is right with the
taxpayers' money," Lynch said. "It does us no good financially to continue
fighting this lawsuit, which could be very lengthy."
</P>
<P>
Lynch said that a year ago, the district sided with Cicero because the then-new
Pierce College president, Dan Means, had inadvertently granted him permission
to sell trees.
</P>
<P>
Under a settlement agreement with Miller signed earlier this year, the college
agreed that no more trees would be sold on the land until Cicero's lease
expires in December, 1991. That agreement comes before a judge for ratification
Dec. 6.
</P>
<P>
In her ruling Monday, Janavs rejected Miller's contentions of unfair
competition: "What's unfair about someone selling Christmas trees competing
with someone else?" she asked. But she agreed with the college district's
assertion that Cicero's lease did not include Christmas tree sales.
</P>
<P>
"I am bothered by the fact that Cicero seems to be quite deliberately trying to
go outside the bounds of that agreement," Janavs said.
</P>
<P>
Kippen said he would discuss with Cicero the possibility of appealing.

Halecrest: Condos and Classrooms
</P>
<P>
Constant transition and high density are the words that best characterize Costa
Mesa's Halecrest neighborhood. But those who live and work there seem to have
found a way to cope in this crazy quilt of residences, businesses, gymnasiums,
condominiums and classrooms.
</P>
<P>
Halecrest is named after a housing development constructed there during the
late 1950s and early 1960s. Bordered on the north and south by the San Diego
Freeway and Merrimac Way, respectively, nearly half the area is occupied by
Orange Coast College. The rest is a montage of structures ranging from small
single-family homes to large businesses like Fedco that border the area on the
east and west along Fairview Road and Harbor Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
Robert Domabyl, president of the Australian Wine Society, opened an office in
Halecrest two years ago in a complex bordered by lots left temporarily vacant
by the removal of wooden barracks -- relics of the Santa Ana Army Air Base,
which occupied a portion of the area from 1942 to 1946. But condominiums and a
massive pink apartment complex have been shoehorned into the gaps, creating
more traffic and parking difficulties in the already-congested area.
</P>
<P>
"But my business is primarily mail-order, so I haven't been affected that much.
But it is harder to get in and out of here. I've lived in Costa Mesa for 10
years and I have seen a lot of change, even in just the past two years," says
Domabyl.
</P>
<P>
Such constant transition does not leave lifelong Costa Mesa resident Jim
Carnett, director of community relations at Orange Coast College, without a
sense of history and continuity, however. "The college is located directly
where the air base used to be. I feel an attachment to it. My father was
stationed there during the war and both my grandfather and mother worked on the
base as civilians."
</P>
<P>
The land was purchased from the federal government for $1 after the base was
deactivated in 1947. The college administrative offices were located in the old
air base headquarters from 1947 until a new structure was built in 1975. Church
services and several weddings were held on campus in the old air base chapel
until it burned down in the 1950s. Other structures, like the gymnasium, were
utilized temporarily and then relocated or demolished. The only remaining air
base structure was used to house prisoners of war during World War II -- its
dull, gray exterior contrasting with the new pink apartments located nearby.
</P>
<P>
Carnett attended Orange Coast College in the 1960s, when there were 4,000
students and has seen it evolve into the largest single-campus community
college in the nation, with more than 26,000 students. "In the '60s you could
say that the college had a definite connection to Halecrest and the surrounding
residential areas because those were the large-growth areas of that time. There
were many college-age kids growing up nearby. We still have lots of students
from Halecrest, but we are primarily a commuter campus and Huntington Beach is
now our largest feeder community. That's the large-growth area of this decade.
However, the older people still owning homes in Halecrest will eventually be
replaced by families with children and the cycle could start all over again."
</P>
<P>
Even though the constant change makes Carnett's job challenging and
interesting, he sometimes regrets that the semi-rural Costa Mesa he grew up in
is not the same for his two children, ages 11 and 13.
</P>
<P>
"When I was a kid, we had the run of the neighborhood," he says. "I had friends
who grew up in Halecrest, and we used to ride our bikes over to those abandoned
barracks and climb in the windows. There were still things in them like old
footlockers and boots. It was an adventure. We could ride our bikes to the
movies in the evening and our parents never worried about us. It gave me a
wonderful sense of independence. But I couldn't let my kids do that now."

   The Passengers Seem to Be Happy;
   They're Even Dancing in the Aisle

   Everybody knows it's tough to take New Yorkers for a ride.
   It isn't so tough when the ride is free.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   On Thursday and Friday evenings, New Yorkers can be seen
boarding a school bus painted Day-Glo green at the World
Financial Center in downtown Manhattan. They are transported
-- without charge -- to four uptown locations. The service is
provided by New York entrepreneur and saloon keeper Jim
Goldman, whose bars happen to be at the bus's uptown
destinations.
   The bus spends most of the night shuttling between Mr.
Goldman's four establishments. (It also runs on Saturdays but
without the downtown service.) Mr. Goldman says he provides
the service to make sure his patrons don't drink and drive.
But he concedes that most Manhattanites don't drive anyway
and that the bus is a clever way to get people to one of his
places.
   Mr. Goldman says the bus costs him $160,000 a year to run,
mainly to cover insurance, and is a cheap way to advertise.
Judging by the instant attention the bus's 450-watt speakers
-- blaring Chicago blues and California beach tunes -- get in
some of New York's upscale neighborhoods, Mr. Goldman seems
to be on to something.
   On the bus one recent evening is a Japanese journalist,
who wears a white safari suit and safari hat and dances
wildly with other passengers. (Dancing is encouraged.) There
also are plenty of post-college professionals high on
alcoholic specialties like a "Dr. Pepper" (made by dropping a
shot glass of flaming rum into a mug of beer).
   For the 30 or so passengers on this ride there is a bus
"cruise" director distributing Hawaiian leis, a bouncer
checking ID's and, yes, a driver, who stoically keeps the bus
moving through traffic despite all the madness around him.
   Bar busing is an import to New York. Mr. Goldman, although
a native New Yorker, says he got the idea for the bus while
living in Chicago.
   Many of his bus passengers say the service puts them in
mind of more relaxed places than New York. "It reminds me of
what they would do while I was in college in Ann Arbor," says
Louise Merriman, a former Michigan resident who currently
lives on New York's Upper East Side and who on this evening
has been at a Goldman bar named Manny's Carwash.
   Ms. Merriman also seems to have found a way to integrate
the bus into her adopted New York life style: She says she is
riding it home instead of paying for a cab.

DECISION EXPECTED FRIDAY ON RIDER'S ELIGIBILITY APPEAL

<TEXT>
<P>
A decision is expected Friday on basketball standout J. R. Rider's appeal to
regain his sophomore year of eligibility at Antelope Valley College.
</P>
<P>
Rider, a 6-foot-5 transfer from Allen County (Kan.) College, was declared
ineligible for this season early this month when it was determined that he did
not have the minimum 2.0 grade-point average.
</P>
<P>
Foothill Conference representatives voted 6 to 1 in Rider's favor and have
forwarded Rider's appeal to the Southern California Appeals Board of the
Commission on Athletics.
</P>
<P>
The three-member appeals board will meet today at El Camino College and is
scheduled to announce its decision Friday.

CLIPPERS' CASEY WILL EXPLORE JOB POSSIBILITY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don Casey, having been given no indication of his future as Clipper coach, will
fly to the East Coast early Sunday morning to interview for the basketball job
at Rider College in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
Casey, who has directed a late-season Clipper resurgence that has brought
praise from his own players and the opposition alike, said Thursday he will
take a red-eye flight from Sacramento to Philadelphia shortly after the team's
season finale Saturday night against the Kings.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet with officials at Rider, a Division I school with an
enrollment of approximately 5,000, Monday. John Carpenter, the college's
longtime basketball coach, moved up to become athletic director.
</P>
<P>
"There's an interest," Casey said, cautioning that this is not an ultimatum
directed at Clipper management. "What it comes down to is, do I want to coach
or do I not want to coach? Right now, the feeling is I want to coach. I'd
rather coach these kids (the Clippers) than any other kids, but I have to
consider any offer anyone else has.
</P>
<P>
"My first priority still would be to be a pro coach. I'm not saying it (the
Rider job) has been offered and I'm not saying I will take it. It's a normal
business process."
</P>
<P>
Casey's roots run deep in the Philadelphia-New Jersey area, and Rider is
located in Lawrenceville, not far from Princeton. He grew up in Collingswood,
N.J., and became an assistant and then head coach at Temple. He had lived in
the area all his life until becoming an assistant with the Chicago Bulls in
1982-83.
</P>
<P>
Clipper officials remained non-committal about their interim head coach, who
has compiled a 11-31 record since taking over for Gene Shue Jan. 19, including
10-10 since March 10.
</P>
<P>
Although no word on Casey's status with the Clippers is expected soon, the
Clippers plan to talk with him next week.

A COLLEGE BOOKSTORE COMES OUT OF THE CELLAR

"I can just see it," said a student wearing a University of Southern California
Trojans T-shirt as he stepped through the security gates of the new campus
bookstore. "Attention, Trojan shoppers!" he intoned solemnly. "On Level Three,
a special on . . . ring binders!"
</P>
<P>
He wasn't far off. The new USC bookstore has a distinct modern-department-store
look. Opened for business July 17 on the main campus drag and inaugurated last
week, it occupies 34,000 square feet in a new five-story building that cost the
university $8.8 million in construction and installation. The retail operation
takes up four floors, connected by central banks of escalators -- not high on
the list of things one expects to see in a bookstore. Sleek shelving is set not
in the old-fashioned perpendicular way but diagonally to the aisles; marketing
experts have discovered that this configuration draws the eye through the store
and invites browsing.
</P>
<P>
The clearest trend in college bookstores, says Elizabeth Kennedy, marketing
manager of the USC facility, is that "we're moving out of the attitude that
students have to shop here just because we're here and we're accessible.
Universities didn't use to invest much in college stores -- they put them in
the basement."
</P>
<P>
College stores have come out of the cellar. In recent years, money has been
poured into these operations. UC San Diego is dedicating its newly expanded
store this week, and UC Irvine is constructing a larger bookstore, due to open
in January as part of its new UCI Student Center. Since the surge in college
enrollment during the 1970s, estimates Garis Distelhorst, executive director of
the National Assn. of College Stores, as many as four out of five college
stores have been "renovated, remodeled or rebuilt."
</P>
<P>
The old USC store occupied only 8,300 square feet in the student commons.
Although ranked only 10th nationally in total sales among college stores in
1988-89, it sold more per square foot than any other store -- a statistical way
of saying it was immensely crowded. The store was so small that at "rush" time
-- the beginning of a term, when students buy required course materials --
one-third of all the general books were physically packed up and moved out to
make space for texts. The new store is so spacious that students lining up for
rush purchases are ushered neatly through a rope maze leading to the cash
registers; in the old plan, no such open floor space was available, and
customers just jammed the aisles.
</P>
<P>
With the variety of merchandise in the store, the role of textbooks, the
backbone of the college store operation, has shifted. At USC, the merchandising
strategy is to use texts -- which students must buy here -- to draw customers
through the store. Texts are located on the top floor, so to find them,
students must pass through the general book department on Level 2 (a
below-ground-level department sells clothing and gifts and has a separate
outside entrance), swing through professional books, computer equipment and
office supplies on Level 3, and ride up to textbooks at the top. Along the way,
arranged in clear plastic display cubes along the escalator banks, are "impulse
items" -- colorful calendars, office supplies, selected gift items -- that
managers hope will tempt customers to add a few dollars to their purchases.
</P>
<P>
An increased emphasis on general books accounts for some of the impulse to
expand. Although they are the least profitable of the items sold in these
stores, additional floor space and personnel is being devoted to a range of
books from faculty publications to best sellers, and even children's books.
</P>
<P>
"General books are among the slowest sellers, but on a campus, they are one of
the most important areas for the academic mission of the store," says
Distelhorst. "Depending on the quality of the bookstore and selection, a
general book department doesn't have to be unprofitable, but there are other
reasons for having a big department. It sets a tone."
</P>
<P>
"It pays to have a great selection of books," Kennedy agrees. "We're finding
that prospective new faculty visiting the campus will look at the library and
the bookstore. It weighs in their decision to come to the school."
</P>
<P>
USC Bookstores director Jack Arnold anticipates that when the bookstore hits
its stride, there will be 80,000 titles in the general book department --
representing a five-fold increase over the old inventory and comparing
favorably with the figures at large general bookstores. Attention to
small-press books and California authors is evident in the selection.
</P>
<P>
The bookstore's relationship to the outside community is still unclear,
however. According to Arnold, an edge-of-campus site for the new store was
briefly considered, but rejected in favor of the central location. Parking is a
major problem for visitors who might want to drop by to browse.
</P>
<P>
"It's very unusual for a college bookstore to aggressively pursue business
off-campus," Distelhorst says. "The movement is rather in the opposite
direction. Local businesses feel threatened" by the sense that college stores
have tax advantages because of their institutional affiliations.
</P>
<P>
In one particularly high-profile case now before the California Supreme Court,
two Marin County booksellers sued a national bookstore chain that managed a
store under contract to a local college; they sought an injunction preventing
the college store from selling non-required texts.
</P>
<P>
General book department manager Candace Moreno, on the other hand, takes a
longer view. "Parking is a problem, but we'll come up with something," she
says. "Downtown is moving in this direction. It may not be here for another
decade or so, but you can feel it coming this way. We're going to be in the
heart of L.A. in the future."
</P>
<P>
 Parking instructions for visitors to the USC Bookstore: Be persistent and
avoid days when football games are scheduled. Enter the campus through Gate 2,
located on Figueroa Street just north of Exposition Boulevard. Tell the parking
attendant you are headed for the bookstore; a number of metered parking spaces
have been set aside for this purpose.

Planetariums offer Southern Californians the opportunity to explore the moon,
the sun, the stars and other celestial landmarks.
</P>
<P>
"The planetarium is like a zoo, showing you things that don't exist in your
neighborhood any longer," said John Mosley, program supervisor at Griffith
Observatory in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
A planetarium, he said, lets whoever is operating it "manipulate" the sky.
</P>
<P>
"From your own back yard, it's pretty static. But in a planetarium, we can
accelerate time, we can watch the motions of a planet through months and see
eclipses happen," Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
Regularly scheduled public programs and special shows are offered at the
following Southland planetariums:
</P>
<P>
* Griffith Observatory, Planetarium and Hall of Science in Los Angeles: The
large telescope on the roof is open for free viewing on clear nights (except

<DESCRIPT>  SANTA-CLARA; COUNTY; MASS-TRANSIT; BUDGET; DECREASE; RESULT; CHART  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  More than half the county's bus routes will have service reduced under a plan
expected to be approved today by the Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors.;
  Faced with dwindling sales-tax revenues and a budget slashed by 5.3 percent
in August, county officials say the cuts -- affecting 45 of 81 routes next
Jan. 1 -- are necessary to avoid wiping out nearly $60 million in reserves and
going into the red by fiscal 1995.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BUS RIDE IS TARGET OF CUTS
SUPERVISORS SET TO VOTE TODAY  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Individually, nearly every change affects only a handful of riders. But
collectively, hundreds of passengers will find their daily routines
disrupted.;   "Aw, damn," Julia Castillo of San Jose said Monday when told Bus
No. 74 would run less frequently -- every 30 minutes instead of every 15.
Castillo, 27, was waiting at a stop near Capitol Avenue and Hostetter Road
with the two fidgety toddlers for whom she baby-sits.;   "I don't have a car,
so we depend on the bus," Castillo said of their twice-a-month outing to
Eastridge Shopping Center. "All I ask is that I don't wait too long. The kids
can get kind of antsy.";   Over a year, the cuts translate into buses being
driven 85,000 fewer hours and nearly 1.3 million fewer miles. Affected the
most will be:;   (check) Early-morning and late-night riders. Many of the cuts
eliminate buses before 7 a.m. and after 7:30 p.m.;   (check) How often buses
run. Instead of four buses an hour on a particular route, there may be only
two.;   (check) Line No. 14, from downtown San Jose to the housing authority
offices on Julian Street. It's being cut entirely.;   (check) Individual
segments of heavily traveled lines where ridership drops off.;   "This is not
something I prefer to do, because it will certainly inconvenience some
riders," transportation agency director Larry Reuter said. "But it's part of
business we have to do to keep solvent.";   Most of the affected routes
usually carry about a half-dozen riders.;   In many instances, Reuter said,
these lines can be served by other lines or by the light rail.;   In recent
years, operating expenses have risen as the trolley line opened and bus lines
feeding into the trolley were added. But, despite a ticket price rise for both
earlier this month, costs have continued to increase.;   The cutbacks will
save the county $1.9 million for the final six months of the current fiscal
year and about $4 million every year after. Over 10 years, the savings would
approach $48 million.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors is scheduled to vote on the bus cutbacks today at 9 a.m. at the
supervisors' chambers, 70 W. Hedding St., San Jose.; Some bus routes affected;
Santa Clara County supervisors are expected today; to approve cuts affecting
45 of the county's; 81 bus routes. Among the cuts:; ...; Line 34-35M; Foothill
College to     Reduced from five to two; Stanford or             morning and
afternoon weekday trips; Menlo Park              from the San Antonio Shopping
Center;                        and the Menlo Park CalTrain station.;
             Affecting 44 riders.; ...; Line 51; Moffett Field to
Ending weekday service at 7:30  p.m.; Vallco Fashion Park     instead of 9:30

<LEADPARA>  YOU HAVE probably heard where Caltrans, the people best known for closing
lanes of traffic during peak commute hours, are going to spend $1.4 million to
analyze what we do during an average day.;    A lottery of sorts will pick
thousands of telephone numbers throughout the state. Representatives from
Maritz Marketing Research of Artesia will then phone and try to convince the
person answering that they are not selling vacation land, security systems, or
vinyl siding, but instead conducting a survey on behalf of Caltrans.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Maritz is looking for 15,000 households or about 42,000 people who will
keep a diary of one day's activities. For example: "Up at dawn. Exercise for
30 minutes. Shower in three cups of water. Eat a healthy high-fiber breakfast.
Ride a bicycle to work. Complete task after task in an ergonomically designed
office. Jog during the midday. Eat a well balanced lunch that is followed by
an afternoon of intense productivity. Ride bicycle home. Swim. Eat healthy
dinner. Read. Relax. Exercise. Go to bed.";    The truth is that they are
looking for hints as to how we transport ourselves and where we go during an
average day, contributing in part to a better understanding of our public
transportation needs.;    Since I usually drive to work and then from place to
place, I decided to see how well I could utilize Santa Clara County's Transit
System on a day when I had but two appointments.;    7:45 a.m. Walk
approximately one-half mile to bus stop and take No. 22 line at 8:16 a.m. to
the Mercury News office in Mountain View.;    8:39 a.m. Arrive. Attempt to
look as if I'm doing really important things. I open mail, most of it directed
at a grammatical error I made last week. One reader comments, "I hold
reporters to a higher standard." I do too. That's why I'm a columnist.;
10:00 a.m. I phone Santa Clara County Transit Information for directions on
how to get from San Antonio Road and El Camino Real in Mountain View to El
Camino Hospital, and then to Stevens Creek and De Anza boulevards in
Cupertino. I take intense notes.;    10:36 I leave for bus stop.;    10:39 I
watch MY bus pass on the opposite side of the street as I wait to cross El
Camino.;    10:50 As advised I board a No. 22 bus eastbound on El Camino
headed for a connection with a No. 51 bus at Miramonte Ave. In a conversation
with the driver, he points out that I catch the No. 51 bus at Castro and El
Camino not at Miramonte.;    10:55 I arrive at Castro and El Camino. A rider
named Wayne shows me a secret way to get to the Castro Street stop -- cut
through the rear parking lot of Home Savings. I then sit on a bus stop bench
next to an old guy holding a can of Budweiser and coughing like a Cuisinart
with bad bearings.;    11:10 Passengers are asked to leave the bus stop by a
man from County Transit who is there to pick up trash and sweep.;    11:15 No.
51 bus arrives and pulls up behind the cleanup man's truck. We're delayed in
leaving because it's time to change drivers and the cleanup man's truck is
blocking the bus. Bus drivers exchange pleasantries until cleanup man
departs.;    11:25 Arrive at El Camino Hospital to drop off one envelope.
TOTAL TIME since leaving for bus stop: 49 minutes to travel about three
miles.;    11:49 Cupertino-bound bus No. 51 arrives. At first stop an elderly
woman approaches the bus wearing a white allergy mask over her nose and mouth.
I suspect a hijacking, which could make me even later for a 12:00 lunch date.;
   12:02 Get off bus at Stelling and Homestead roads in Cupertino to transfer
to a No. 53 bus southbound toward De Anza College.;    12:08 I board the No.
53 bus and the driver advises me to get off at Stevens Creek and walk to De
Anza rather than waiting for the No. 23 bus, recommended by the transit
information service. "You may end up waiting longer for the bus than it takes
to walk," he told me.;    12:11 Begin walking east on Stevens Creek past the
Union Church of Cupertino, past the post office, to Marie Callender's
restaurant.;    12:22 Arrive at Marie Callender's. Group of friends have
already eaten. I have a bowl of soup and inform them that I need to catch my
next bus at 1:04. They howl and spit food and don't believe that I'm riding
the bus.;    1:04 The time I'm supposed to catch a No. 23 bus westbound on
Stevens Creek that will take me directly to San Antonio Road and El Camino.;
 1:14 p.m. No. 23 bus arrives. It's warm and stuffy. I'm warm and stuffy. Some
seats are littered with read newspapers -- however, it's OK since they are all
copies of the Mercury News.;    1:45 p.m. On the advice of the driver I stay
on board past San Antonio Road and El Camino until the bus stops at the end of
the line: Showers Drive and El Camino. "I think it's a little closer to where
you're going," he said.;    TOTAL time since 1:04 p.m.: 41 minutes to travel
about five miles.;    Exhausted by 4:40, I phone my son for a ride home. If
one of the questions that Caltrans is trying to answer is why the public
doesn't use public transportation more often and why we haul our gas-guzzling
cars to work, the answer might be that most employers tend to frown on what
should be brief trips taking a few hours.  </TEXT>

Cinco de Mayo will be observed throughout Southern California this weekend with
celebrations featuring Mexican music, dance, traditional foods and discussions.
Cinco de Mayo commemorates an important victory in Mexican history and is

</P>
<P>
 On May 5, 1862, a small Mexican force overwhelmed 7,500 French troops in the

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA HAS become a haven for much-traveled vintage carousels. A
ride on a merry-go-round is a thrill for children, and the tinkly music of a
carousel band organ can evoke childhood summer memories for adults.
</P>
<P>
The Spillman carousel in Los Angeles' Griffith Park was built in 1926, but some
of its horses were carved by Charles Looff, the godfather of carousels, before
the turn of the century. Its fine Stinson Military band organ has a repertoire
of more than 1,500 tunes.
</P>
<P>
Charles Looff built the Shoreline Village carousel in Long Beach in 1906.
Originally located in Seattle, it was moved to San Francisco's Playland in
1914, where it remained until 1973. Now housed in a replica of Looff's original
hippodrome, its menagerie of jumping camels, rams, giraffes (and, of course,
horses) has real horsehair tails and Belgian cut-glass "jewels."
</P>
<P>
One of the last places you can catch a brass ring is at the carousel at Balboa
Park in San Diego. The 1910 Herschell-Spillman Co. carousel moved south from
Los Angeles to settle permanently in Balboa Park in 1922, arriving at its
present location next to the San Diego Zoo in 1968.
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Seaport Village is the home of the Broadway Flying Horses, an 1890
Coney Island William F. Mangles and Charles Looff carousel, originally powered
by a steam engine. The horses were refurbished by artisans who used automobile
paints blended in the colors of the original palette. The turn-of-the-century
Gebruder Bruder Waldkirch band organ has also been restored.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 years old, the Dentzel carousel, with 52 hand-carved animals, is
featured at Castle Amusement Park in Riverside. For many years it was located
at Knott's Berry Farm. Music is provided by a Ruth band organ, which was
rescued from the old Long Beach Pike. The 1922 carousel on the Santa Monica
Pier was manufactured by the Philadelphia Toboggan Co., and was made famous in
the movie "The Sting."
</P>
<P>

(Hours of operation will be curtailed when school resumes, after which most
will be open only on weekends. Rides cost 75 cents unless otherwise noted.)

   Greyhound Woes Continue;
   Easter Travel Down 56%
   From Year-Ago Level

   DALLAS -- After a disappointing Easter travel weekend,
debt-laden Greyhound Lines Inc. continues its struggle to
expand its service network and attract enough riders to shore
up its strike-battered balance sheet.
   Just before Easter, the unit of GLI Holding Co. added
several hundred new replacement drivers, restored service to
286 locations and offered customers in some cities free
tickets if their buses arrived late. But with violence
continuing to flare up in the strike by 9,300 members of the
Amalgamated Transit Union, Greyhound only attracted about 44%
the number of riders it did for Easter weekend a year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "I feel that our ridership is very high," said Greyhound
spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale, who said ridership had been
hovering between 50% and 60% of pre-strike levels in the days
immediately preceding the holiday. She attributed the lower
percentage over the Easter weekend itself mainly to the fact
that in 1989, Easter coincided with spring break for many
college students.
   But analysts who follow the closely held company's
publicly traded bonds say Greyhound has yet to maintain the
levels of ridership and revenue that it needs to break even.
"The company has said they need to be at about 70%-plus level
to break even," said Charles Mancuso, senior analyst for
Moody's Investors Service Inc. "The question becomes how long
can they go if they don't achieve that level."
   In a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing,
Greyhound acknowledged that a prolonged strike could
seriously impair its financial future. Since the strike began
March 2, the company has continued to restore scheduled
service and add replacement drivers in the face of strike
violence.
   The company said that, as of last Tuesday, it was running
about 72% of its prestrike schedules with 2,903 drivers --
2,393 of them new hires.
   But even if the company succeeds in spite of the strike,
some analysts say they are concerned about the long-term
impact of negative publicity surrounding the recent violence,
the additional debt taken on because of the strike and the
problems in rejuvenating Greyhound's charter and package
express businesses, both badly battered by the walkout.
   "They seem to be winning the strike," says Leigh Walzer,
an analyst with R.D. Smith and Co. "The question now is how
strong will the company be going forward."

Time constraints, modern life styles and weather all conspire to deny county
residents many of the trappings of a traditional Christmas. There are not too
many sleigh rides to grandma's, for example, when the thermometer lurks around
70 degrees.
</P>
<P>
But one tradition we can enjoy is cutting a fresh Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
Orange County has a nice crop of tree farms where either you or the farm staff
can cut a tree. Some farms provide services such as home delivery, flocking and
fire-retarding; some provide seasonal treats. Most farms plan to be open until
Christmas Eve but will close when their stocks are depleted.

EMERITUS COLLEGE AIDS SENIORS WITH CLASSES AIMED AT RETIREES
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE WHEELOCK
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thousands of students went back to school last month, marking America's
traditional September rite. Young people ranging from big-eyed kindergartners
to seasoned college seniors made their way through classroom doors.
</P>
<P>
Those enrolled at Emeritus College in Santa Monica may have a few years on such
students, but they seem to have as much enthusiasm. About 3,500 Southland
residents are enrolled in the state-financed adult education program of Santa
Monica College, sampling from 100 eclectic not-for-credit daytime classes.
</P>
<P>
Offering courses from Shakespeare and foreign policy to post-stroke exercise
and instruction in living with hearing loss, Emeritus College has some new
classes, new ideas and a new home.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1974 by Santa Monica College President Richard Moore, the school has
just opened its first permanent facility on the renovated Third Street
Promenade after 14 years of makeshift classrooms in Santa Monica community
facilities and churches.
</P>
<P>
School director Maggie Hall says this has brought about a philosophical change
in the Emeritus program.
</P>
<P>
"In the past," she said, "we tried not to publicize the program too much
because we couldn't serve the students -- we didn't have enough locations. But
this year we decided to seek support from the city of Santa Monica to help us
grow, and they're paying for a third of the rent for our new buildings. We've
got 15 new classes, and new faculty members are coming in with excitement and
energy."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Transition Period
</P>
<P>
Emeritus College was designed, Hall said, to ease the transition between work
and retirement. "People have certain specific life learning needs in later
years, and education helps them to cope with diminishing physical capacity and
financial resources. Our prime motive has always been to keep the older adult
integrated into the community with the mind working."
</P>
<P>
The program is specifically designed for senior citizens, and although most of
the students at Emeritus are retired and between 60 and 70 years old, there are
no age or residence restrictions. Most of the classes are free.
</P>
<P>
Teachers and students say the program provides a climate conducive to forming
friendships. Sylvia Rothschild, past president of the 34-member Emeritus
advisory board, who has taught a class in autobiography writing for 11 years,
said: "My students write about themselves and share experiences, and from
sharing they get to feel close. There have been wonderful relationships formed.
</P>
<P>
"Emeritus really satisfies a need so many people have for contact. It relieves
loneliness and makes them feel worthwhile. When you take a class, you feel like
you're going ahead with your life."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Like a Family'
</P>
<P>
Bill Elliott, who leads another class, the 25-member women's Lyric Chorus,
says: "The group is very close, like a family. It's ethnically diverse, the way
life should be, with people of every background, and we're all there because we
love to sing together."
</P>
<P>
Elliott, a former professional choral singer with the Fred Waring and Ray
Charles singers, took over the group in 1986. It frequently performs for local
nursing homes, church groups and civic organizations.
</P>
<P>
He believes the class helps build self-esteem. "I'm trying to show them how
good they are and that they can step into a more demanding situation," he says.
"We've just made our first record, and when they heard the playback, one of the
ladies said, 'Why, we don't sound old.' It was a big moment for them."
</P>
<P>
Ellie Mae Cramer, 68, veteran of at least 16 classes, ranging from band (she
plays trombone and baritone sax) to stress management, said: "When my husband
died I went into a very deep depression, and I would have committed suicide,
but my college supervisors got me started with classes. Now I can't learn
enough or get to school often enough, and I'm a different person. I never
believed there was this much to life." Cramer's new life has also included an
appearance on a senior citizen segment of KCBS' "Two on the Town."
</P>
<P>
Rita Bachtold, equally enthusiastic about her auto and home repair classes and
their teacher, Bonnie Kramer, said: "Her idea is that a woman can do everything
she sets her mind to."
</P>
<P>
"This is definitely not a playpen thing," said Harold Jaeger, 82, of his
Emeritus political science classes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Broad Range of People'
</P>
<P>
"There's participation in classes, and I never cease to be amazed at the depth
and breadth of experience in the groups," said Jaeger, a retired labor law
attorney. "We have a broad range of people who were active in fields like
finance, statecraft and other disciplines, and it makes for an interesting
exchange of views.
</P>
<P>
"In regard to getting some of these old fogies up off their duffs and out doing
things, I think Emeritus contributes to their longevity and desire to continue
living."
</P>
<P>
Jaeger is a member of the school's advisory board, which director Hall said has
always been an important element of the school. "Mostly it's made of community
senior activists who want to put their opinions into action. They make a lot of
excellent suggestions, and some of our new classes are a direct result of their
input," she said.
</P>
<P>
Hall interviews and selects the teachers, working with a Santa Monica College
committee. Teaching applicants must have a bachelor's or master's degree in
their subject area as well as experience teaching older adults and "a lot of
enthusiasm and energy."
</P>
<P>
"They're paid $30 an hour, and we've had several people who've donated their
salaries back to the college," she said.
</P>
<P>
Marriage and family counselor Ruth Dasche, an Emeritus teacher for five years,
is teaching four classes this year, including the popular "Psychodynamics of
Assertiveness."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Positive Changes'
</P>
<P>
She said: "My students generally want to learn three things: how to demand
respect from their doctors and nurses, how to say no to their friends, and how
to ask their children for what they want. They're proud and independent people,
not used to asking for help, and what they learn from me and each other assists
them in making positive changes in their lives."
</P>
<P>
Phillip Chandler is one instructor who needs no classroom. Now in his 13th year
of teaching horticulture at Emeritus, his Monday morning class meets in various
public and private parks and gardens all over Southern California. It is
popular with young horticulturists and landscape designers as well as seniors.
</P>
<P>
Chandler, a former UCLA and Los Angeles City College teacher, said, "We have
some noted garden designers in the class, some of whom began with my course
before they ever became professionals."
</P>
<P>
One star member of the class is eucalyptus expert Grace Heintz, 84, the author
of "Trees of the Pacific Palisades."
</P>
<P>
Heintz, a former teacher, recalled with a chuckle how she taught herself to
ride a bicycle at age 65 because it would be easier to ride around town
cataloguing trees. She makes presentations and identifies specimens for
botanical gardens and arboretums all over California. "Phil Chandler," she
says, "has been a godsend -- he's so knowledgeable."

ON CAMPUS: WOODBURY UNIVERSITY;
</P>
<P>
VETERAN ARCHITECT LOUIS NAIDORF TO HEAD PROGRAM
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Woodbury University's architecture program will take on a new staff design with
the appointment of veteran architect Louis Naidorf as chairman.
</P>
<P>
The architect, whose work ranges from architecture and urban design to research
and design methods, succeeds Donald Conway. Naidorf, 61, who will take over the
post June 18, is an architect at the Santa Monica architecture firm Ellerbe
Becket and will continue working there part time.
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Powers Doud, vice president of academic affairs at the college,
said: "We are delighted that a professional of such distinction will be leading
the architecture program. His distinction speaks for itself, including the 40
years professional experience at Ellerbe Becket, his academic background . . .
and his extensive teaching experience."
</P>
<P>
His principal architecture projects include the Hyatt Regency in Dallas, the
Capitol Records Building in Los Angeles, the restoration of the California
State Capitol in Sacramento and the Naval Medical Center in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
During the past 18 years, Naidorf also has become increasingly interested and
involved in the education of architects.
</P>
<P>
He has been an instructor, guest critic, seminar coordinator and lecturer at
architecture and design programs at UCLA, USC, Cal Poly Pomona, Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo, the Southern California Institute of Architecture and the Otis Art
Institute of Parsons School of Design.
</P>
<P>
"I want to give students the confidence to provide both art and function
without compromise in the design of their buildings," Naidorf said.
</P>
<P>
Naidorf has won numerous professional awards and is widely published in
professional journals.

COLLEGE of the CANYONS
</P>
<P>
Neighbors Protest Board's Plans for Swap Meets
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of College of the Canyons in Valencia have gathered more than 500
signatures on a petition protesting a recent decision by the college's
governing board to allow a swap meet to use the campus on weekends.
</P>
<P>
A contract between the Santa Clarita Community College District Board of
Trustees and swap meet organizers has not been signed, but the meets were to
begin the first weekend of July. The trustees had requested minor changes in
the proposed contract when they endorsed the on-campus swap meets recently.
</P>
<P>
Thirty homeowners attended a trustees meeting last month, and many said the
swap meets would bring additional traffic, noise and trash to their
neighborhood and would cause the value of their homes to drop.
</P>
<P>
Trustee Michele Jenkins said the audience was the largest she had seen at a
meeting in five years.
</P>
<P>
"I believe a swap meet would cause a severe environmental impact," said Alan
Zada, director of the Valencia Summit Homeowner Assn. He said post-swap meet
trash would line the area's streets.
</P>
<P>
Nazareth Chobanian, one of the swap meet organizers, said the area would be
cleaned up after each week's event. Residents whose homes face the college said
they paid up to $30,000 more for their homes because of the view they have of
the campus. Several said locating a swap meet there would decrease the value of
their homes.
</P>
<P>
The homeowners acknowledged that the college needs to raise money and offered
to develop alternative sources of funds.
</P>
<P>
College Supt.-President Dianne Van Hook assured homeowners that their views
would be considered before trustees decide whether to sign the final contract
with the swap meet organizers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
PIERCE COLLEGE
</P>
<P>
Rodeo Back in the Saddle Again After 4 Years
</P>
<P>
The 34th annual Pierce College Intercollegiate Rodeo, which last month returned
to Pierce after a four-year absence, came off virtually without a hitch,
according to its organizer.
</P>
<P>
"This has been, without a doubt, the finest rodeo in the 19 years I've been
here," said Ron Wechsler, an animal science instructor who is in charge of the
rodeo.
</P>
<P>
A small protest by about a dozen animal-rights activists didn't affect the
two-day rodeo, attended by 10,000 people. The rodeo was held May 11 and 12. The
rodeo's hiatus had resulted because the college had been unable to secure
liability insurance for the event.
</P>
<P>
Five college teams, from as far away as Nevada, competed in eight events during
the weekend. West Hills College of Coalinga, which is ranked first nationally,
won the meet. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo finished second.
</P>
<P>
The Pierce team placed third overall and was led by saddle bronc rider Richard
Bucher. Bucher, who is ranked second in the West Coast Intercollegiate Rodeo
Assn., won a second place on one of the rodeo's two nights and placed fourth
overall. Pierce's Michelle Morrison won second place in the Girl's Barrel Race
and also placed fourth overall.
</P>
<P>
Though he characterized the rodeo as a success, Wechsler said he is unsure
whether it will become an annual event.
</P>
<P>
"It's not easy to get funding with all the cutbacks" at Pierce, "but we did it
and it worked well," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rodeo grossed about $30,000, but the net profit from the event is not yet
known. Profits will go to support agriculture programs at Pierce.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BOARD APPROVES NEW SITE FOR FAIR
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Encouraged by a warm welcome from nearby Lake View Terrace homeowners, the San
Fernando Valley Fair board voted Friday to move a scaled-down version of the
annual fair to Hansen Dam.
</P>
<P>
The location is less than ideal, board members said, because to win consent
from nearby homeowners and the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks,
they agreed to ban carnival rides, concerts and sale of alcoholic drinks. Those
were the major money-makers at past fairs.
</P>
<P>
The fair, scheduled for July 14 to 16, will be restricted to such traditional
country fair offerings as livestock exhibits, harvest celebrations, banjo
contests, lumberjack competitions and craft booths.
</P>
<P>
A year ago, the fair was ousted from Cal State Northridge after 13 years to
make way for campus expansion. A tentative agreement to use a 30-acre cornfield
at Pierce College fell through after Woodland Hills homeowners and the Los
Angeles Community College District objected, saying the fair did not fit the
college's master plan.

<DESCRIPT>  CALIFORNIA; COLLEGE; EDUCATION; FUTURE; COST; OPINION  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  CALIFORNIA COLLEGE officials are getting better at predicting the future, and
what we are seeing is scaring the living ivy out of us. We don't know how we
are going to handle the impact of California's continuing population boom (up
12 million from 1960 to 1990; 6 million more are due by 2005). Where will we
put the 790,000 more college students we can expect to be enrolled just 14
years from now?;   That's a bunch of people, roughly the population of San
Jose. To get them into classrooms and laboratories somewhere, the California
Post-secondary Education Commission estimates we will need to build 37 new
community colleges, expand existing California State University campus
capacity by 21 percent, establish five new CSU campuses or off-campus centers,
and construct three new University of California institutions.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  INNOVATION AND COLLEGE MUST MIX  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Robin Wilson is president of California State University, Chico.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Forty-five new campuses in 14 years! The cost? The California Economic
Development Corporation estimates $10 billion in capital investment alone. No
one wants to think about the bills for microscopes, chalk and utilities, and
the number of new professors (thousands of them at $50,000 a pop) and support
staff we will need.;   Meanwhile, back on campuses, roofs leak, obsolete
equipment gathers dust, library hours shrink, and students stand in crowded
classrooms as a result of the worst budget crunch in the history of California
higher education. We must play much catch-up before we can build for the horde
of newcomers.;   And the horde is coming. Most are already in our communities
disguised as little kids; you can see the plywood pavilions going up at grade
schools everywhere. These youngsters will surge through the high schools and
drive the enormous expansion of the community college system, slated to
accommodate three quarters of the coming bulge. The other quarter will impinge
heavily on the senior institutions and less directly force expansion in their
expensive graduate programs. The CSU system must turn out the schoolteachers
and UC the college professors for this new academic boom. UC alone projects a
65 percent expansion in graduate enrollment, from 28,100 to 46,300, by 2005.;
 So where is a state mired in recession, its defense-related industrial base
staggered by world peace, going to find the billions to finance this
expansion? Here are some ideas about the capital side of the problem that
would be worth exploring:;   (box) Use public funds to support enrollment to
capacity in the state's 172 private colleges. This might accommodate about
15,000 students, 2 percent of the coming bulge, without capital cost.;   (box)
At a vacancy rate of 20 percent, commercial real estate gluts the market. From
the I-680 corridor in the north to the Los Angeles basin (where rents have
fallen 15 percent), new office buildings stand unoccupied, visited only by the
occasional banker wringing his hands. In every hamlet in California, empty
strip shopping spaces, supermarkets and discount emporiums offer mute
testimony to the concentration of retailing into ever fewer hands. Such
property is readily convertible to academic use; much of it lies nicely
convenient to students and circuit-riding professors.;   (box) The peace
dividend will empty out 11 California military installations. Each site is
complete with roads, barracks, shops, power plants and all the expensive
infrastructure that new campuses will require. In Monterey County, 28,000-acre
Fort Ord alone could accommodate a major part of the projected growth in
student numbers.;   (box) And ready to tie these scattered installations to
expensive laboratories and libraries is the wizardry of modern
telecommunications. New technology now allows Baby Bells to distribute
information directly into homes and offices; the final regulatory barriers
fell in September. Some campuses, too, are already experienced in teaching
off-campus by electronic means. This semester, Chico State televises live,
interactive instruction to 750 students at locations in a dozen states, from
Oregon to Pennsylvania, and in 16 learning centers across the northern third
of California. The classrooms? Storefronts and office buildings and industrial
plants for such firms as IBM, Texas Instruments, Hewlett-Packard, Alcoa, and
General Electric.;   President James A. Garfield's idea of a university was "a
student at one end of a log and Mark Hopkins at the other." Professor Hopkins
retired from Williams College in 1872 and logs grow scarce. But what if by
2005 the "log" is a satellite transmission with one end in the office of a
Berkeley Nobel laureate and the other in an abandoned Safeway in Whiskeytown
or a converted barracks at the Sacramento Army Depot? It's still a university.  </TEXT>

PREP BASKETBALL: MARINA'S 6-FOOT-11 SENIOR CENTER HAS NARROWED HIS CHOICES TO
ARIZONA, ARIZONA STATE, DUKE, KENTUCKY AND UCLA.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five shoe boxes sit under Cherokee Parks' bed, but they don't house the Marina
High School center's size 14 basketball shoes.
</P>
<P>
Parks uses the boxes to file the hundreds of recruiting letters he receives
every year.
</P>
<P>
He recently has added a file cabinet to keep the hundreds of recruiting letters
from schools including Duke, Arizona, Arizona State, Kentucky, UCLA, Indiana,
Michigan, Syracuse, North Carolina, North Carolina State and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't even begin to count the number of letters I have," Parks said.
"There's a ton of them."
</P>
<P>
Parks received his first recruiting letter in the eighth grade. He had been
playing basketball only a few months when the letter came from Stanford Coach
Mike Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Montgomery was the first to see the potential. Perhaps he was getting
an early start on a gangly 14-year-old who, at the time, hated playing
basketball.
</P>
<P>
Maybe Montgomery just wanted a head start on Parks, now one of the most
sought-after high school basketball players in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Last season, Parks averaged 22.1 points, 13.4 rebounds and 3.5 blocked shots
and shot 59% from the field.
</P>
<P>
A three-year starter, he has averaged more than 20 points and 10 rebounds per
game since his sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
Marina Coach Steve Popovich said Parks could be the most highly recruited
basketball player in Orange County history.
</P>
<P>
"(Mater Dei's) Tom Lewis and LeRon Ellis were highly recruited," Popovich said.
"But Cherokee keeps getting mentioned in the top four or five nationally."
</P>
<P>
That allows Parks to be picky.
</P>
<P>
He narrowed his choices to five schools -- Arizona, Arizona State, Duke,
Kentucky and UCLA. Their combined record last season was 105-57, with Duke,
Arizona and UCLA reaching the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
Parks based his decision on the quality and needs of each program, his
impressions of the coaching staffs and the players.
</P>
<P>
"Mainly it came down to the coaches and the players they're recruiting," Parks
said. "Location was kind of a factor, but it wasn't the main reason."
</P>
<P>
Each of the five finalists have told Parks, a center, that he will move to
power forward if he comes to their school.
</P>
<P>
" . . . at least until I get a little bulk on me," said Parks, who would like
to add 12 pounds to his playing weight of 228 pounds. "I still want to keep my
body fat (percentage) low."
</P>
<P>
Because his final five choices are located all over the nation, Parks said he
will make his decision after visiting the campuses. He said he hasn't decided
yet if he'll commit to a college before the high school season begins.
</P>
<P>
So in the next two months, Parks will be rolling up more frequent flier miles
than the Cal State Fullerton football team. The airlines are going to love the
kid.
</P>
<P>
 So, without further ado, Mr. Parks, here is your itinerary:
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 14-16, Lexington, Ky.: Parks will jump off the plane just in time to
catch the Wildcats' Midnight Madness practice to kick off the 1990-91 season.
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats were one of the first teams to schedule a midnight scrimmage, and
the school goes all out -- cheerleaders, the band, the works.
</P>
<P>
"That's going to be something else," Parks said.
</P>
<P>
But the highlight of the trip will be meeting with Wildcat Coach Rick Pitino,
who visited Parks in Huntington Beach two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"Pitino coached Providence and with the Knicks and he turned both teams
around," Parks said. "After coaching in the NBA, he knows what it takes to get
there."
</P>
<P>
Kentucky is currently finishing the last year of an NCAA probation, the result
of infractions during the recruitment of former Los Angeles Fairfax star Chris
Mills.
</P>
<P>
Oct. 19-21, Durham, N.C.: Duke's record under Coach Mike Krzyzewski -- four
Final Four appearances in the last five years and 231-101 in the last 10
seasons -- appeals to Parks. But he knows little about Durham, and is curious
about the Atlantic Coast Conference campus.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know about living in a different part of the country," Parks said.
"That's why I want to take the trips."
</P>
<P>
Parks will attend basketball practices and a football game and will stay with
the Blue Devil players.
</P>
<P>
Oct. 26-28, Tempe, Ariz.: Parks has seen this campus before, having watched the
Pac-10 basketball tournament in Tempe last year. During his recruiting trip
he'll watch the USC-Arizona State football game, sit in during classes and
watch practice.
</P>
<P>
And, of course, he'll meet with Sun Devil Coach Bill Frieder.
</P>
<P>
Frieder made quite an impression on Parks and his mother, Debe, when he visited
their home in early September.
</P>
<P>
"Basketball is that guy's life," Parks said. "He's fanatical."
</P>
<P>
"When he came in, he was dressed all nice and neat," Parks said. "Then we
started talking basketball with him. He starts running his hands through his
hair and by the time he left, he was a mess."
</P>
<P>
Nov. 2-4, Tucson, Ariz: A week after his trip to Tempe, Parks will return to
another Arizona campus.
</P>
<P>
Parks was in eighth grade when he first met Wildcat Coach Lute Olson.
</P>
<P>
"He came to watch (former Marina star) Mark Georgeson in a game," Parks said.
"I didn't even know who Olson was. That shows you what little I knew about
basketball."
</P>
<P>
It turns out that Parks was one of the few people around Marina who didn't know
of Olson, who coached the Vikings from 1965 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
Nov. 16-18, Westwood: No need for a plane ticket here. Westwood's just a
30-minute ride up the 405 freeway from Parks' home.
</P>
<P>
Parks is a regular at UCLA basketball games and several of his friends and
Marina graduates go to school there.
</P>
<P>
"It's a nice, big school," Parks said. "I want to go to a big school."
</P>
<P>
Many people in the recruiting circle say UCLA has a lock on Parks. But Parks
says that's not necessarily so.
</P>
<P>
The Bruins have a talented core of young players -- Tracy Murray, Don MacLean
and freshmen Shon Tarver and Ed O'Bannon. Tyus Edney of Long Beach Poly, one of
the top point guard recruits in Southern California, orally committed to UCLA
last week.
</P>
<P>
"(Coach Jim) Harrick's building an awesome program there," Parks said. "UCLA
will be good if I decide to sign late. I can see how the team does this year."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, everyone wants to know what Parks is doing. Rarely does a
night go by that his phone isn't ringing off the hook with calls from
reporters, coaches and recruiters.
</P>
<P>
Reporters from as far away as Chicago, Raleigh, N.C., and Philadelphia
regularly call local papers, asking about Parks. One magazine writer even
interviewed the Marina equipment manager about Parks' college choices, Popovich
said.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the uniqueness of his name," Popovich said. "With a name like
that, people automatically latch onto it. I think it (his popularity) would be
different if his name was John Jones or something."
</P>
<P>
Everyone already knows Parks has one of the greatest names in basketball. But
he wants to show he has the greatest all-round game.
</P>
<P>
College coaches all over the nation have watched Parks play the last three
summers at the Nike Camp in Princeton, N.J. Parks has gone against some of the
best players in the country, including Shawn Bradley, a 7-4 center now at
Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
"I love going there because you can go all out," Parks said. "The officials
working our games are trying out for jobs in the ACC and the Big East, and they
allow you to be aggressive.
</P>
<P>
"You learn a lot at those camps. You find out that the turnaround (jump shot)
doesn't work against the bigger guys. It gets sprayed back in your face."
</P>
<P>
Said Popovich: "The camp has helped Cherokee exposure-wise, but I don't know
how much basketball-wise. A guy can be a great player in his own community, but
a camp like that will let him see how he stacks up nationally."
</P>
<P>
This summer, Parks found out how he stacks up internationally. He averaged 39
points and 18 rebounds per game for a Southern California all-star team that
played in Stockholm, Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Parks said the games in Sweden gave him a taste of what to expect in college.
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of 6-8 guys and the European style is very aggressive," he
said. "Over the back is unknown there."

</P>
<P>
Don Franklin has been set to join the ensemble cast of "The Young Riders," the
ABC series about the young men who rode for the Pony Express in the 1860s and
which recently won a Western Heritage Award. Franklin, a regular on
"Knightwatch," will play Noah Dixon, a freeborn black liberally raised by his
parents on the family's prosperous Texas ranch, where he was educated by white
teachers.
</P>
<P>
"Tim and Daphne," a one-hour syndicated talk program starring the
husband-and-wife acting duo of Tim and Daphne Maxwell Reid, will debut in
September on King World Productions' Research and Development Network. If the
show is popular on the test network's 21 cable stations, it probably will go
into production this year for national syndication.
</P>
<P>
Nickelodeon will explore the early days of television, circa 1950, to witness
the creation of a mythical comedy-variety show in "The Sam Arnold Show." The
new series, from "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd" producer Karen Stevens, is
scheduled to premiere in January.
</P>
<P>
English college mates and comedy team Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie will co-star
in a new TV edition of P.G. Wodehouse's "Jeeves and Wooster," airing on PBS
beginning Nov. 11. In addition to the offbeat five-hour comedy series on PBS,
Fry and Laurie's BBC series "A Bit of Fry and Laurie" will be cablecast on the
Bravo network starting Sept. 22.
</P>
<P>
MINISERIES
</P>
<P>
David McCallum plays a world-famous symphony conductor who becomes the target
of a hate campaign by his ex-wife, Diana Rigg, in "Mother Love," a four-part
BBC production airing as a PBS' "Mystery!" presentation Oct. 25. For her
performance, "Mystery" host Rigg won a BAFTA award in England, the British
equivalent of a combined Emmy and Oscar.
</P>
<P>
MOVIES
</P>
<P>
Principal photography has begun in Vancouver, British Columbia, on "Deadly
Intentions ... Again?," an ABC movie starring Joanna Kerns and Harry Hamlin
based on the ABC miniseries "Deadly Intentions." The two-hour thriller, about a
paroled man who was jailed for plotting the murder of his first wife, is
scheduled to air during the 1990-91 season.
</P>
<P>
Three NBC movies planned for the 1990-91 season: Candace Cameron, Chad Allen,
Josh Saviano and Danica McKellar will star in "Camp Cucamonga," a madcap comedy
about a co-ed summer camp. In the crime drama "Cops and Robbers," Ray Sharkey
is involved in the largest bank robbery in U.S. history, which was committed by
cops. "Deadly Medicine" is the true story of a pediatrician who suspects that
her best friend, a trustworthy nurse, may be a baby killer.
</P>

<MEMO>  FRONT LINES  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     It went over big.;   It went over so big, in fact, that drive-by viewers
jammed the streets for blocks around trying to get a look at the display.
Every yuletide you could count on a major backup on Willow Street, until 1970,
when Lima donated the whole collection to the city of San Jose, and Christmas
in the Park was born.;   The park in the title is Plaza Park, on Market Street
between San Fernando and Santa Clara streets in downtown San Jose. Beginning
tonight, some 70 mechanized displays will twinkle and turn for a crowd the
city estimates will reach 300,000 by the time all the movable bunnies, bears,
Santas and reindeer are packed up again Jan. 2. So much for the theory that
we've all grown too jaded to appreciate hometown entertainment.;   Of course,
Christmas in the Park has grown since the days when a Packard was a kind of
automobile, not the founder of one of the valley's foremost computer firms.;
Take the displays. Only a few of the survivors date from Lima's time, says
Todd Bishop, a San Jose parks and recreation staffer whose autumns are overrun
by Christmas in the Park. Instead, over the years Christmas-in-the-Park lovers
have added to the animated scenes, which now cost between $10,000 and $12,000
to construct.;   New this year is Santa's toy shop, filled with mechanical
dolls dressed in costumes from San Jose's sister cities. Traditionalists,
however, should not fear: The time-tested displays will be there, including a
new, improved version of the beloved miniature train, which does date from
1950 and, frankly, showed it.;   In years past, says Bishop, volunteer
construction crews had to actually lay track -- as in placing ties, pounding
spikes, yelling for the water boy when a body dropped from exhaustion. It took
days. Now, the new track snaps together in mere hours.;   And displays aren't
the whole show anymore. There's Santa's Castle, where one can get a photo
taken with the grand old man; a refreshments booth, where one can get a hot
dog; a souvenir booth, featuring inflatable reindeer and glow-in-the-dark
bracelets; and 150 Christmas trees, each decorated by a different San Jose
group.;   There's also the mayor's tree lighting ceremony, at 5:30 tonight in
Plaza Park. The displays will switch on then, and will be open until
midnight.;   The annual Holiday Parade -- with marching bands, baton twirlers,
lighted floats, guys driving Model A Fords -- takes off at 5:15 p.m. Sunday
from Fifth and Santa Clara streets and heads down Santa Clara to Market
Street. Bishop estimates 50,000 to 70,000 will line the streets to watch.;
Other Christmas-in-the-Park special events include the Sounds of the Season
youth choir concert, 7 to 9 p.m. Dec. 13; the KRON Holiday Sing-a-Long, 7 to 9
p.m. Dec. 15; the KEEN Toy Drive, which gives you the chance to drop off a toy
for a needy child, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Dec. 20; and the KAZA Latin Holiday,
featuring Hispanic music groups, 6 to 9 p.m. Dec. 22.;   Christmas-in-the-Park
displays are on and moving 9 a.m. to midnight. Admission is free. Bishop says
the displays are at their most spectacular during the evening.;   Some free
parking is available during the Christmas season in the lot on San Fernando
street between Second and Third streets.;   Other holiday celebrations this
weekend:;   (check) Los Gatos' 35th annual Children's Christmas and Holiday
parade begins at 11 a.m. Saturday at Almendra and North Santa Cruz avenues.;
The parade, which features bands, horses, kids in costumes and, of course,
Santa, continues down North Santa Cruz Avenue to Main Street and ends at Los
Gatos High School.;   Los Gatos lights its town Christmas tree today.
Entertainment starts at 4:30 p.m. and the tree, located in Town Plaza at Main
Street and Santa Cruz Avenue, will be lighted at 5:30 p.m.;   Tonight is also
the first night for Christmas horse-drawn carriage rides in downtown Los
Gatos. The rides, $7, continue on weekends through Dec. 22. (408) 354-9300.;
(check) Across the way in Saratoga, Yuletide at Montalvo continues from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. today and Saturday. Admission for shopping and tea is $7.50, $3
for children.;   There's no parking at Villa Montalvo itself, and shuttle
buses leave from a variety of parking lots, depending on which day you choose
to attend. (408) 741-3428.;   (check) The San Jose Historical Museum in Kelley
Park, 1600 Senter Road, San Jose, presents A Victorian Christmas from 10 a.m.

crafts-making area for children and a visit by Father Christmas. Tickets are
$4 for adults, $3 for those 65 and older and $2 for children 6 to 17. (408)

<CAPTION>  Drawing; DRAWING: Special to the Mercury News; BEFORE THE SPLIT -- The College

high school relocated to South Second Street in San Jose.  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  WOMEN; HIGH-SCHOOL; SAN-JOSE; PROFILE  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  The idea of high school students striving to win an award for "ladylike
deportment," or snagging a medal for best clothes mending seems almost
ludicrous. But those were among the most coveted honors at Notre Dame High
School when it was young.;   The downtown San Jose school, celebrating its
140th anniversary this fall, has changed radically in some ways from those
early days.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Local  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  NOTRE DAME KEEPS TRADITION AS ALL-GIRLS S.J. HIGH
SCHOOL  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  OUT OF THE PAST  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Founded the same year that Santa Clara University and Bellarmine College
Preparatory opened, Notre Dame has altered its course offerings, stopped
taking boarders and long ago dropped awards for mending.;   But some things
haven't changed. It is still committed to a strong academic program, to being
an all-girls school and to instilling values such as integrity and concern for
others.;   The nuns of Notre Dame de Namur, a Belgian order, had intended to
establish a school in San Francisco, but entreaties by Martin Murphy Jr., a
wealthy early settler in the Santa Clara Valley, led them to check out a
southern location in 1851.;   The proximity of Mission Santa Clara, the
planned Santa Clara University and the support of some of the area's richest
men helped the nuns pick San Jose over the more populous city to the north.;
They quickly began buying property on West Santa Clara Street, the main
thoroughfare to the mission and right on the edge of the acequia, a ditch that
brought water into town.;   And they quickly began getting students, including
some from the huge Murphy clan. By the time school opened in the fall of 1851,
there were 26 boarders and 20 day students, according to an account in "Light
in the Valley," a history of Notre Dame by Sister Mary Dominica McNamee.;
The numbers grew and by 1852, the end-of-the-year ceremonies drew some 600
people. Within a few years, a college was added.;   Prominent San Francisco
families, their names now commemorated on street signs such as Noe and
Valencia, joined the daughters of early luminaries such as Peter Burnett,
California's first governor, the Sunols and the Castros, and other wealthy
landowners.;   Often, the students' families paid their tuition, room and
board with butchered meat, cheese or other products. Today's students must pay
cash.;   A diverse school from the start -- early students spoke French,
Spanish and English as their native languages -- Notre Dame today serves a
variety of minority groups, including Hispanics, blacks, Asians and
Filipinos.;   While there has been a tradition of Notre Dame students going on
to college, academic awards are more coveted now than the school's highest
honor in the early days -- "the superior class of good conduct," or the
special award for "order and neatness," considered a recommendation for life
as a housewife.;   The nuns, who made up the faculty in the early years, spent
a lot of time buying up property and adding buildings -- the girls' residence
hall, classrooms for the high school and college, a music conservatory, a
science building, the chapel and the convent.;   The high school/college
complex was isolated from Santa Clara Street by a wall, and occupied the
blocks between San Pedro and Santa Teresa streets through to St. John Street.;
  By 1920, the area around the campus was deteriorating and the nuns, sensing
that business expansion in the neighborhood would make their property more
valuable, began investigating other locations.;   When the Ralston estate in
Belmont went on the market, the nuns decided to move the college there along
with a new high school for boarders. The San Jose high school was moved to
South Second Street, where it continues as a girls high school today.;   There
are no plans to open the school to boys.;   "It's been shown through studies
that young women in their teens are very successful in an environment that's
just girls," said Sister Virginia Unger, president of the school.
"Academically, they excel. They have an opportunity for leadership. Their
self-esteem is strengthened."  </TEXT>

SANTA ANITA;
</P>
<P>
EVEN HIS TRAINER ADMITS MUSIC PROSPECTOR'S PROSPECTS IN SATURDAY'S DERBY ON
SLIM SIDE
</P>

<P>
Sitting outside Barn 109 at Santa Anita, nursing a cold, Steve Miyadi pointed
to Barn 118, across the way.
</P>
<P>
"I used to sleep over there, in the tack room," Miyadi said. "My wife, Rochelle
-- we weren't married yet -- slept at the other end. We worked for (trainer)
John Russell."
</P>
<P>
The day was ripe for reminiscing. Miyadi, who grew up in nearby Rosemead,
remembered the first time he saw the Santa Anita Derby. "It was the year (1973)
that Sham beat Linda's Chief," Miyadi said. "How old could I have been? About
15, I guess."
</P>
<P>
Miyadi will presumably have a better seat Saturday when the young trainer
starts Music Prospector, a 10-1 shot on the morning line, in the 53rd running
of the Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
To get to the Kentucky Derby on May 5, Music Prospector probably must get
Miyadi to the winner's circle, and for that to happen, the Irish-raced colt
must beat seven opponents, including the undefeated Mister Frisky, who is
seeking his 16th straight victory.
</P>
<P>
Longshots like Music Prospector don't win the Santa Anita Derby much anymore,
and even Miyadi would be surprised by an upset Saturday, although running on
dirt in America seems to agree with the colt. The last time a real outsider won
this race was when Mighty Adversary paid $66.20 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The hallmark of this Santa Anita Derby is speed, and Miyadi tried conjuring up
a scenario that might throw the race to Music Prospector, who probably will be
running just off the pace.
</P>
<P>
"If Mister Frisky and Real Cash hooked each other (in a speed duel), my horse
might have a chance," Miyadi said. "But considering the riders involved (Gary
Stevens on Mister Frisky and Angel Cordero on Real Cash), that's unlikely to
happen. Two other riders, maybe, but not those two."
</P>
<P>
Jeff Tufts, the Santa Anita linemaker, has made Mister Frisky the even-money
favorite in the $500,000 race. Eight Santa Anita winners went on to win the
Kentucky Derby, but after Affirmed in 1978 there was a 10-year gap in this
progression before Winning Colors and Sunday Silence pulled off the
California-Kentucky double the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The field in the 1 1/8-mile race lines up this way, with all horses carrying
122 pounds: Real Cash, with Angel Cordero riding, 2-1; Balla Cove, Russell
Baze, 20-1; Single Dawn, Alex Solis, 15-1; Music Prospector, Frank Olivares,
10-1; Video Ranger, Eddie Delahoussaye, 30-1; Assyrian Pirate, Martin Pedroza,
20-1; Mister Frisky, Gary Stevens, 1-1, and Warcraft, Chris McCarron, 5-1.
</P>
<P>
Music Prospector won his first two starts in the United States, taking stakes
at Bay Meadows and Santa Anita early this year, then he ran third, beaten by 6
1/4 lengths, in the one-mile San Felipe Handicap on March 18. Real Cash won the
San Felipe in a wire-to-wire trip, finishing 5 1/2 lengths ahead of Warcraft.
</P>
<P>
"My horse made a move and then he hung," Miyadi said. "Frank (Olivares) said
that he had dead aim at the horses in front of him, but he came up empty."
</P>
<P>
Music Prospector, a grandson of the crack sprinter and powerful sire, Mr.
Prospector, sprinted four times in Ireland as a 2-year-old, winning just once.
Just before that victory, Motohide Aoki, a Tokyo breeder and real estate man,
bought the horse for about $100,000.
</P>
<P>
"Some of those races over there, he couldn't even beat fillies," Miyadi said.
"Maybe it was a case of a dirt horse running on grass and not liking it."
</P>
<P>
Music Prospector was sent to Miyadi just about the time the trainer was
shifting his stable to Del Mar last summer. Without the work of Curley Ortiz,
the colt might never have adjusted to American tracks.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign horses usually come over here after they're older, at least 3 and
maybe 4 or more," Miyadi said. "So here I had this 2-year-old, and he wanted to
make every gap on the race track down there. He also acted like he wanted to
breed all the time. We had to break him all over again, and Curley did a nice
job."
</P>
<P>
It was at Del Mar that Miyadi scored the biggest victory of his four-year
career as a head trainer, winning last year's Del Mar Futurity with Drag Race.
That colt's future is on grass.
</P>
<P>
Before Miyadi's mother died of cancer, she made her two sons and one daughter
promise that they'd prepare for their futures by going to college. Steve
Miyadi, who had been going to the races with his father since he was 10, earned
a degree in accounting at UC Santa Barbara, but a career at the track was
always on the front burner. He chose his major only because those courses came
easy for him.
</P>
<P>
Besides Russell, Miyadi also worked under trainers Richard Cross and Mike
Mitchell. Miyadi's wife, Rochelle, works for her husband, ponying horses and
helping at the barn. Their 3-year-old son, C.J., was all over the place the
other day, seeing what his parents were up to.
</P>
<P>
Since Miyadi left college, satellite betting has come to the Southland, and one
of the locations is in Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good thing they didn't have that when I was there," Miyadi said. "Can
you imagine? They would have never seen me at class."
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
The other half of the racing doubleheader on ABC-TV Saturday is as bland as the
Santa Anita Derby is intriguing. At Gulfstream Park, 12 second-rate 3-year-olds
will run in what is almost guaranteed to be the least important of the Kentucky
Derby preps. Run Turn, third in the Florida Derby, may go off the favorite.
</P>
<P>
An 11-horse field is entered in the Gotham at Aqueduct, with Rhythm, last
year's champion 2-year-old colt, making his first start since undergoing throat
surgery last month. Others in the race are Burnt Hills, Senor Pete and the
Wayne Lukas-trained pair of Kentucky Jazz and Richard R. Laffit Pincay, with no
mount in the Santa Anita Derby, a race he has won seven times, will ride
Richard R.
</P>
<P>
Lukas, who also trains Real Cash, plans to run Land Rush in the Blue Grass
Stakes at Keeneland a week from Saturday and will send Hail Atlantis, the
filly, to the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn Park on April 21.
</P>
<P>
All of the Santa Anita Derby starters are eligible for the Triple Crown races.
. . . Steinlen, last year's male turf champion, will make his second try for
his first victory this year when he runs Sunday in the El Rincon Handicap.
Steinlen won the stake in 1988 and was second in it last year.

<HEAD>Parody Star Begins Filming On First Feature Film Effort</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   They stood on their heads and yodeled. They
smushed marshmallows in their mouths and chanted, ``Chubby bunny,
chubby bunny, chubby bunny.'' They dressed as Uncle Sam and tapped
danced on stilts.
   They were weird. But they had a purpose.
   More than 100 people staged their weirdest acts last week for a
chance to be seen on the big screen with a guy who proudly bills
himself as ``Weird Al.''
   His real name is Al Yankovic, a 27-year-old Southern California
native who hit the big time in 1983 with a song called ``Another
One Rides the Bus.''
   It was his way of laughing at pop culture _ the song is a parody
of the rock group Queen's hit song, ``Another One Bites the Dust.''
He's been laughing his way to the bank ever since.
   Five albumns later, Weird Al is on the radio and video music
stations again laughing at pop culture, this time with ``I'm Fat''
from his ``Even Worse'' albumn. The song and LP is a takeoff on
Michael Jackson's ``I'm Bad'' from the ``Bad'' album.
   ``Most of the songs I do are about food or TV _ two of the
things that have shaped my life most,'' Yankovic said.
   Five years later, Weird Al is still, well, weird. And he's
making a full-length feature film to prove it called ``U H F,'' due
for release next summer. Shooting was to begin in early August in
Tulsa.
   ``It feels kind of cold and clammy,'' said the former college
disc jockey. ``It's a lot harder to be funny for an hour and a half
than it is for three or four minutes,'' he said, referring to his
work with music videos.
   Ten years ago, Yankovic was an architecture student at Cal-Poly
San Louis Obispo College. He left with a degree and moved on to
develop Weird Al. Now he has a movie deal to film the screenplay he
and longtime friend and manager Jay Levey finished in 1983.
   ``The character that I play is going to be somewhat like Weird
Al,'' Yankovic said. ``But this isn't going to be `Weird Al's Big
Adventure.'''
   ``The movie is a cross between `It's a Wonderful Life,' `The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and `Purple Rain,''' said Levey, who is
directing the film. ``It's a love story.''
   OK, not really. Yankovic's character, George Newman, owns a UHF
TV station and turns it into the hottest thing around by putting on
nice, wholesome, weird programming.
   Levey began managing Yankovic's career ``from his inception .. .
when he was an embryo.'' He also has directed the Weird Al videos,
a change of pace from directing ``U H F,'' his first feature film.
   ``I just kind of fell into directing. Shooting music videos is
kamikaze work. You have two days to do four days of work,'' Levey
said. ``The pacing is not quite so deadly in film.''
   The Tulsa auditions were an open call for acts that may be used
later during the eight-week filming schedule when staging a
telethon to save Newman's station, Levey said.
   ``They came at us for five hours. They were all so strange,'' he
said. ``It's hard to describe them without sounding ridiculous. But
they were all great.''
   The movie is being filmed in Tulsa because it's ``the perfect
Anytown,'' Levey said. ``And that's meant as a very affectionate
compliment to Tulsa.''
   Executive producer Gray Frederickson suggested Tulsa as a film
location after his experience here in 1982 while shooting ``The
Outsiders.'' And having a chance to come back home makes working in
the state more desirable, he said.
   ``This is repeat business, so that's great,'' said Mary Nell
Clark, director of the Oklahoma Film Office.
   ``U H F'' is the fourth motion picture filmed in the state this
year. ``The Killing Device'' was filmed in Tulsa in April, ``The
Bounty Hunter'' in Sand Springs in May and portions of ``Rainman''
in Guthrie, Hinton and El Reno in June.
   Clark said she is able to sell the state to film companies
because of the varied location work that is available. ``I always
tell them about the varied terrain. I've hyped that so much now
that I think they believe me.''
   Television, video and full-length feature filming in Oklahoma
brought in about $50 million last year, Clark said.

THE MISSING LINK IN THE BEST-LAID PLANS OF TRANSPORTATION MANAGERS;
</P>
<P>
CONGESTION: THE LITTLE TRIP THAT WORKING PARENTS MAKE TO TAKE THEIR CHILDREN TO
A CARE PROVIDER CREATES A LOT OF POLLUTION AND TRAFFIC.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Keeler, Barbara Keeler is an educational writer and author of Energy
Alternatives, to be published in September by Lucent Books.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Exasperated with the freeway crawl and with noxious fumes, California voters
agreed early last month to pay for some transportation relief by raising the
gas tax. But most commuters ill experience little comfort -- especially working
parents.
</P>
<P>
The Air Quality Management District's commuter program, for example, neglects
the needs of workers who must drive their children to school or to child-care
facilities. The plan asks employers to help reduce drive-alone commutes from 6
a.m. to 10 a.m. Employers are supposed to reward workers who participate in
ride-sharing programs, use public transit, agree to a compressed work week or
reduce drive-alone trips by other means.
</P>
<P>
Day-care centers unfortunately aren't geared to 10-hour days, four times aweek.
Car pools and public transit are also less satisfying options for workers who
are parents. Before catching the bus, a parent must typically drive a short
distance to take his or her child to the care provider.
</P>
<P>
Starting a cold engine for a five-mile drive produces 60% of the pollution a
20-mile trip does, according to the AQMD. A program designed to improve air
quality by reducing the number of vehicle trips, then, must take into account
the needs of working parents. Otherwise, its benefits, at best, will be
limited.
</P>
<P>
It's not surprising that child-care needs have been overlooked as a
work-related and transportation issue. Today's concept of childhood is quite
different from the days when father and son, mother and daughter worked
side-by-side at home. After the Industrial Revolution, families just moved
closer to the factories.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of child-labor laws, the wives of men working at the factories
stayed home with the children, largely remaining there until the 1950s.
Exceptions were made during the two world wars, when women had to fill factory
positions left vacant by men in the armed forces. During World War II,
factories provided excellent child-care centers for workers, but the facilities
were closed after the men returned from the war.
</P>
<P>
During the 1950s, relatives and neighbors took care of the children of working
parents. But as more and more women entered the work force, fewer neighbors and
relatives were available. More divorces and escalating living costs were also
factors driving women into the job market. A growing number of parents began to
take their children to day-care centers and licensed homes located outside
their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
By 1987, 55% of working women had children younger than 6 years of age. A 1988
study by the California Department of General Services showed that of 2,729
state employees surveyed, nearly 20% drove their children to or from school or
day care. Ninety percent of the drivers were women. The trip to the child-care
provider added, on average, eight miles to the round-trip commute.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicated that parents did not walk or bicycle their children
to school or day care. Among parents with children at home, ride-sharing
dropped one-third; among working women with children, use of public transit
declined by three-fifths. Because most users of public transit are women, the
survey results suggest that the ability of buses, light rail and trains to
solve the state's transportation problems is limited.
</P>
<P>
Happily, more employers are beginning to offer child-care programs. Los Angeles
County, for example, provides excellent child care for its employees,
alleviating many of the worries facing working parents. But it does not take
their transportation needs into account, since the centers are only located at
hospitals. Workers assigned to other, sometimes distant county sites must still
detour to deliver and pick up their children.
</P>
<P>
Child care at the work site offers employers more than a tremendous recruiting
advantage. It is also good transportation policy, since the extra miles that
parents drive to child-care providers would be eliminated. However, the effect
on ride-sharing programs and the appeal of alternative transportation would be
minimal. Few parents would take three children on a bus, and a father or mother
driving three children to the work place would not be among the most popular
ride-sharing partners.
</P>
<P>
Some employers, including government agencies, have considered guaranteeing
ride-sharers and transit users transportation for personal emergencies. They
have also considered restricting on-site child care to workers who ride-share
or use alternative transportation.
</P>
<P>
One emerging child-care strategy could increase use of public transit. Some
transportation agencies are planning to build child-care facilities at transit
stations or at park-and-ride lots. Such a facility opened this year on the
light rail-line of the City of San Diego Metro Transit Authority. In San Jose,
one is being considered at a point where buses, light rail and commuter trains
meet. It would include care for mildly ill children, a service working parents
sorely need. Boston, Atlanta, the Port of New Jersey and the County of San
Diego are conducting feasibility studies for locating child-facilities care in
existing transportation centers or along major transportation corridors.
</P>
<P>
Child-care facilities at residential sites would probably best serve parental
needs and ease traffic congestion. These centers could organize car pools to
drive children to neighborhood schools. Parents willing and able to walk,
bicycle or take a bus to work could eliminate car trips altogether.
</P>
<P>
By whatever means, transportation-demand managers must make provisions in their
plans for the growing percentage of workers who require child care. A commuter
plan that ignores the needs of a large segment of the work force is doomed to
fall short of its goals of reducing miles driven and number of trips made.

shown in 1950 in front of Don Lima's business on Willow Street in San Jose. It
attracted so many drive-by viewers that cars would be backed up for blocks,
causing traffic jams; so Lima donated the exhibit to the city of San Jose in

Castle, a refreshment booth and a souvenir booth. All are staged for the
season in City Plaza Park, Market and San Carlos streets, downtown San Jose.

<LEADPARA>  THE Hoover Institution is presenting a new exhibit that's a good one to see
when you're feeling particularly depressed about the lack of a new world
order.;    The exhibit, in the Hoover Exhibition Pavilion through April 10,
recalls the transformation of Eastern Europe in 1989-90, when the Berlin Wall
came down, elections were held and Hoover researchers were busy gathering as
many documents, posters and mementos as they could carry.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The show includes a hat from the East German army and parts of uniforms
sold openly at flea markets after the fall of the Berlin Wall.;    There are
bumper stickers from the Croation Democratic Union in Yugoslavia, made of the
same silver material that glints into rainbow colors and is popular with
bumper-sticker manufacturers here.;    There's a pinup poster of Vaclav Havel
along with a Polish Solidarity poster depicting the Gary Cooper character from
"High Noon" striding into town holding a Solidarity ballot instead of a
pistol.;    There are fliers appealing for calm in Romania dated the day after
the Ceausescus fell from power. And, added to the display for Lithuania,
there's the notation that in January "the Soviet Union used force to quell the
independence movement.";    The Hoover Pavilion is open 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Monday through Friday. The Pavilion is located at the base of Hoover Tower on
the Stanford campus.; The military in concert; And now, back to the U.S.
military.;    The U.S. Navy Band performs tonight at Foothill College. The
concert is free, but vouchers are required to get into the hall. Call the
Foothill Box Office at (415) 948-4444 to get one.;    The U.S. Navy band,
based in Washington, travels through California once every four years. This is
the band's first appearance at Foothill College.;    The band will be joined
by 10 local high school and Foothill College music students. Together, they'll
play a mix of music, including at least one Sousa march ("Glory of the Yankee
Navy," of course), several classical selections and "On a Wonderful Day Like
Today," from the musical "Stop the World, I Want to Get Off." Somehow, that
seems particularly apt.;    The U.S. Navy Band is scheduled to begin its
two-hour concert at 8 tonight at Foothill College, 12345 El Monte Road, Los
Altos Hills.; Gallery on the move; The Photographer's Gallery, for years a
fixture on Ramona Street in Palo Alto, has moved to the area trendoids around
town like to call SoFa, as in South of Forest Avenue.;    The Photographer's
Gallery joins Branner Spangenberg Gallery on Emerson Street, just south of
Forest, with a show of work by Robert Glenn Ketchum.;    Ketchum, who is
represented in most of the major museums in the United States, is an
environmental photographer, and one of the first contemporary photographers to
include overtly political messages in his work. In 1989, the Sierra Club gave
him the Ansel Adams Award for conservation photography.;    Ketchum's work is
displayed through March 30 at the gallery's new location at 732 Emerson St.,
Palo Alto.; Stanford's 'Magic Flute'; (box) Stanford's Department of Music
presents a semi-staged production of Mozart's opera "The Magic Flute" at 8
p.m. today and Friday and at 2:30 p.m. Sunday in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The
performance will be in English and will feature the Stanford Chamber Orchestra
and Chamber Chorale. Tickets are $8 for general admission and $5 for students

<LEADPARA>  EACH of our two unreliable Fords has 80,000 miles. Both in our 30s, we
realized the daily trek to the driveway was hardly enough exercise to keep us
even semi-svelte. And, as former city dwellers, we were curious if South Bay
mass transit really deserved its bum rap.;    That's why we decided to try
getting around using only the bus, light rail, CalTrain, bikes and our own two
feet for seven days.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     At the outset, we really had no idea if local mass transit was the costly,
inefficient monster most of us auto addicts like to believe or if it could
become a part of our daily routine. (Not that we needed war in the Persian
Gulf to drive the point home -- nonetheless it is a terrifying reminder of our
dependence on gas-guzzling autos.);    Now before we sound too self-righteous,
we'll make two confessions: We hopped in a cab one night because we missed the
last bus, and we figured it wouldn't be much of a sacrifice to live auto-free
for a week.;    We don't have kids living with us and both our commutes
combined are only a meager (by Bay Area standards) 24 miles a day. Everything
we associate with survival -- the dry cleaners, 7-Eleven, video rental store
and automatic teller machine -- are within a 10-minute walk. The bus stop is
only 135 steps from our East San Jose home, even fewer if our quickly trained
ears picked up the roar of a bus engine approaching.;    And we were a bit
cocky, having survived New York subways for four and a half years -- with just
one chain snatching to report.;    But this story is about much more than mass
transit. It's about reassessing priorities, striking up new, unusual
relationships and finding out about the place we call home.;    We made all
the mistakes worthy of any novice bus rider, including misreading schedules
and taking a route recommended by a Santa Clara County Transit schedule
adviser. (She forgot to tell us that every driver on the route that stops
closest to our house takes a mandated 20-minute break just a mile down the
road.);    The result: On the first day, a trip that is usually 12 minutes by
car turned into a one-hour-and-43-minute ride. One of us was 45 minutes late
to work, the other missed an hour of class.;    But then, with the invaluable
help of Aristeo Canales, who answered our distress call to county transit's
hot line -- the bus rider's version of 911 -- the time was reduced to an
almost remarkable 45 minutes. On an average weekday, Canales and his
colleagues answer some 3,400 calls.;    By the third day, with hot-line number
committed to memory, riding the bus became second nature. We kept a roll of
quarters by the phone. Bus routes 71, 36 and 59 became as recognizable as
highways 101, 880 and 280.;    Mass-transit myths;  Besides daily trips to the
Mercury News and Evergreen Valley College, we used the bus to go to Valley
Fair and Eastridge malls and to a friend's house in Santa Clara to watch a
sporting event on TV (we almost missed the game's exciting end as we had to
catch the bus home). We rode light rail to the San Jose Real Estate Board
dinner-dance at the Red Lion Hotel (that's when we cheated with the cab
because our bus stopped running at 7:30 p.m. on Saturdays), and took CalTrain
to Sunday brunch at MacArthur Park in Palo Alto.;    Sure, spending a week on
buses and trains reinforced some old stereotypes about mass transit. But many
myths were dashed.;    Yes, the buses are slow and noisy, but at least it's
not your blood pressure that rises when a jerk swerves through traffic.;
Yes, many buses come only once every 45 minutes to an hour. Quickly, you
develop a dependency on the minute hand of your watch.;    Yes, one of us was
left standing at a stop for 45 minutes because a bus broke down, something
that as the county transit's fleet ages apparently is happening with more
regularity. (Personally speaking, however, we can hardly crow about our 1982
Mustang's record.);    No, the buses do not always run behind schedule -- in
fact, sometimes they are early (which can be worse than running late if they
don't wait).;    No, the bus drivers are not all clones of Ralph Kramden. They
wish you good night, help passengers with grocery bags and, in one case, gave
impromptu English lessons to a Spanish-speaking regular passenger.;    40
seats, no standing;  Mass, we found out however, is a misnomer. It's not
uncommon to share a 40-seat bus or a light-rail car with just one or two
others. (We find it hard to believe Santa Clara County Transit, which says
144,000 people, or 10 percent of the county's population, ride the bus
weekdays.);    Some of us are forever addicted to the fast lane, but life on
mass transit has its rewards, too.;    After spending more than two years
looking at San Jose mostly through a car windshield, sitting with strangers
fosters a sense of community and allows conversations you'd ordinarily never
have -- a neighborhood deli on wheels, if you will.;    We had conversations
with strangers about Middle East goings-on and learned how to listen to (or at
least tolerate) rap music. We even made a new friend, a 24-year-old
engineering student from Mexico who is here to learn English -- and willing to
help us with our halting Spanish.;    Instead of blaring the all-news station
on the car radio, it's refreshing to become engrossed in a book or just
daydream out the window (as long as one remembers to get off at the right stop
-- another mistake made early on.);    Just walking to and from the bus (a
healthy two miles, counting both ends), we came to recognize
interesting-looking people and scenery we'd previously whizzed by.;    Not to
digress, but walking is an important part of the mass-transit experience
around here. Walkers, at least in our little patch of suburbia, are treated as
second-class citizens -- even though they rightly can claim endangered-species
status.;    Bushes and cars routinely block sidewalks. One can barely pass a
house without riling cats and dogs -- and then their owners who rush outside
-- or setting off motion-detecting lights that diligently guard driveways at
night. Since when are sidewalks private property?;    Rolling stops by
inattentive drivers are life-threatening, and those yellow-tinted streetlights
are positively useless.;    Nevertheless, both of us not only survived but
also came to enjoy the regimen.;    And not a moment too soon, as the quest to
make mass transit compatible with all of our lives will take on more urgency.
Bay Area planners say that to coax people out of their cars in order to meet
federal air-quality standards, by the 21st century we can expect to pay to
park at work and shell out $5 for bridge tolls.;    With gas hitting $1.40 a
gallon at times over the last few months, spending $1.50 a day for unlimited
travel on Santa Clara County Transit buses and light rail makes economic
sense.;    Our verdict after the one-week trial is that mass transit, with
perseverance and patience, is feasible. Not every day or every place.;    But
here's a challenge. Take mass transit or walk or bike somewhere you usually
drive, just one time each week.;    You might be surprised. You might like it.  </TEXT>
