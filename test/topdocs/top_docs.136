   BOSTON -- Researchers reported the results of a study with
rats that potentially could lead to the first effective
treatments for Alzheimer's disease.
   But the study's results were questioned by some
scientists, who said they have tried unsuccessfully to
replicate a similar earlier finding in test-tube experiments.

   The research centers on a protein called beta amyloid,
which is found in small clumps in the brains of people with
Alzheimer's disease. Last fall, a team led by neurologist
Bruce A. Yankner at Children's Hospital here said that beta
amyloid is toxic to brain cells in test tubes, suggesting the
protein plays a central role in the disease. The team also
said a compound involved in sending nerve signals, called
substance P, blocked beta amyloid's toxic effects. That
raised hopes that drugs based on substance P could halt the
disease's underlying process.
   In the latest study, Dr. Yankner and colleagues at
Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital injected beta amyloid
into rats' brains. The team said that a week later they found
signs of brain damage in the animals resembling that of
Alzheimer's disease. They also found that the damage was
largely prevented when they injected substance P into the
animals' brains along with amyloid. A similar protective
effect occurred when substance P was injected into the rats'
abdomens 30 minutes before brain injections of amyloid,
indicating that drugs based on substance P might not require
brain injections.
   The research, reported in today's issue of the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences, "prevents
Alzheimer's-like lesions in animals as we hope someday to do
in humans," said Zaven Khachaturian, who monitors Alzheimer's
research at the National Institute on Aging, which supports
Dr. Yankner's work.
   But several researchers, including Richard Wurtman at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Carl Cotman at the
University of California at Irvine, said they haven't been
able to reproduce Dr. Yankner's earlier test-tube results.
The researchers added, however, that their experiments may
have differed somewhat from Dr. Yankner's, yielding different
results. Other researchers, including Alex Roher at Wayne
State University, said they have found evidence that beta
amyloid is toxic to neurons in test tubes. But Dr. Yankner's
promising results with substance P haven't yet been confirmed
by outside groups. Some scientists said they were skeptical
of the results because substance P breaks down quickly in
cells.
   Dr. Yankner countered that his earlier experiments
required "a lot of finesse," particularly in growing neurons
in test tubes. Neil Kowall, a Massachusetts General Hospital
researcher and co-author of the latest study with rats, added
that those experiments also are tricky, hence may take a
while for others to confirm.

<TEXT>
   Japan's leading cosmetics maker has promised $85
million to Massachusetts General Hospital over the next 10 years to
establish a center to study skin diseases, the company and hospital
officials announced Thursday.
   The grant from Shiseido Co. will support basic studies of skin
biology as well as better ways to diagnose and treat skin
disorders. Specifically omitted, however, is testing or development
of commercial products, the hospital said.
   The project, to be called the MGH-Harvard Cutaneous Biology
Research Center, will be headed by Dr. John A. Parrish, the chief
of dermatology at Massachusetts General and chairman of dermatology
at Harvard Medical School.
   ``Considering its importance, the skin is relatively neglected
by the most modern capabilities of basic research,'' Parrish said.
   Parrish said a chief aim of the center will be ``to make a
meaningful, powerful and tangible difference in the prevention of
skin disorders, the treatment of abnormal skin and the maintenance
of symptom-free normal skin of pleasing appearance.''
   In a statement issued from Tokyo, Shiseido said the $85 million
will be invested over 10 years. Forty researchers, including five
Shiseido staffers, will do interdisciplinary research on skin, the
company said.
   Under the agreement, the hospital will patent inventions, but
Shiseido will have the first opportunity to license them and pay
royalties to the hospital. Massachusetts General also will decide
what research to undertake and where and when to publish reports on
its findings.
   The guidelines are similar to those set up eight years ago when
the hospital received $68 million from Hoechst AG of West Germany
to support a molecular biology department.
   ``The fruits of their studies will ultimately benefit people all
over the world,'' said Dr. J. Robert Buchanan, the hospital's
general director. ``More immediately, this center will be a boost
to the Massachusetts economy. New jobs and a major economic
infusion will result.''
   The center will be housed at the former Charlestown Navy Yard,
where the hospital has research laboratories.
   When fully operative, the center will employ about 100 people.
Shiseido is authorized under the agreement to have up to five
scientists performing research at the center.

<HEAD>Developer of Practical Method For Freezing, Thawing Blood Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Dr. Charles E. Huggins, who developed a method for
freezing and thawing donated blood so it can be stored almost
indefinitely, has died of cancer of the pancreas. He was 60.
   Huggins, who died Wednesday, was director of the Massachusetts
General Hospital Blood Transfusion Service and taught at Harvard
Medical School.
   He developed a technique for freezing blood donated to blood
banks by adding glycerol, which acts like an organic antifreeze, to
red blood cells that have been separated from other blood
components. The cells can be thawed years later and the glycerol
removed by a sugar compound, the hospital said.
   In 1963, Huggins developed a Cytoglomerator _ a machine that
freezes the red blood cells and removes the glycerol. The machine
was widely used until the 1980s, when it was replaced by automated
equipment.
   Dr. J. Robert Buchanan, general director of Massachusetts
General, said in a prepared statement that Huggins was ``one of the
world's luminaries in blood banking.''
   Huggins became director of the hospital's blood transfusion
service in 1973. He was also an associate professor of surgery at
Harvard Medical School.
   Born in Chicago, Huggins was the son of Dr. Charles B. Huggins,
a Nobel Laureate cancer researcher. He received his bachelor's
degree from the University of Chicago in 1947 and graduated from
Harvard Medical School in 1952 at age 23.
   He was trained in surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital and
later practiced there as a general surgeon.
   Huggins is survived by his father, his wife, Gareth W. Huggins,
and five children.

<HL> Research Indicates Abnormal Gene
May Cause Elephant Man's Disease
---

<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have located the gene believed to cause neurofibromatosis, a disorder commonly known as Elephant Man's disease.

   The discovery is the first to identify the gene of a cancerlike disease, and raises the hope that genes for some other cancers may yet be found.

   Scientists at the University of Utah Medical Center and Massachusetts General Hospital said they believe an abnormal gene on chromosome 17 produces a wide range of problems associated with neurofibromatosis.

   About one in 3,000 people have some form of the ailment, which in its mildest case can cause birthmarks on the skin or soft lumps, called neurofibromas.

   More serious forms can result in hearing and skeletal defects and disfiguring tumors on nerve endings.

   The disorder was first identified by Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen in 1882, and was commonly called the Elephant Man's disease after British patient John Merrick.

   The gene located by the researchers is for the type of disorder called Von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis -- the most common form of the disease, which is believed to affect about 100,000 Americans.

   The researchers, who reached their findings separately, say the discovery confirms that an inherited gene, or perhaps several, produces the disease.
Scientists had assumed a gene was at fault, but previously lacked the proof.

   The new finding locates the gene only approximately, however.
The researchers said it may take six months to two years to identify a marker close enough to the gene for use in prenatal detection tests; it may take an additional few years after that to identify the gene itself, a development that may allow scientists to produce a treatment.

   The location of the gene at the root of neurofibromatosis is the latest in a string of recent discoveries in which researchers have located disease-causing genes -- including those involved in Huntington's chorea, muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease and manic depression.

   The discoveries all resulted from new techniques in molecular biology by which scientists probe the DNA of large families with inherited disorders in search of a common gene.

   The University of Utah's research, led by Mark Skolnick, John Carey and Raymond White, and which involved research from the University of Toronto, is published in today's issue of Science.

   The other team, which included Bernd Seizinger and James Gusella, of Massachusetts General Hospital, will publish its findings in next week's issue of Cell.

   Researchers said they are developing a biological diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease and a new method to determine whether various chemicals might be useful in treating the disease.

   Both developments involve research on a strange protein, called beta-amyloid, that accumulates in the brains of persons with Alzheimer's disease.
The protein's role in the disease isn't known but the number of amyloid-containing lesions in the brain seem to correlate with the disease's severity.

   Two collaborating research teams -- at the University of Rochester (N.Y.) Medical Center and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston -- have now developed a monoclonal antibody that they hope will detect the beta-amyloid protein in Alzheimer's patients, said Sayeeda Zain, who heads the University of Rochester team.
She spoke Friday at a symposium in Rochester on molecular approaches to human disease.

   The two research groups are in negotiations with an unidentified company to develop the antibody as a diagnostic test for Alzheimer's disease, said Charles A. Marotta, the Harvard Medical School biologist who heads the research effort at McLean Hospital, the psychiatric facility for Massachusetts General Hospital.

   "At present there is no biological assay for Alzheimer's disease," Mr. Marotta explained.
The disease, premature loss of memory, senility and dementia, is diagnosed primarily by psychological and neurological tests that measure changes in brain and mental functioning.

   "We developed the monoclonal antibody for research purposes" but it also could be used for a diagnostic test, Mr. Marotta said.
Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced versions of the antibodies the body makes to fight off invasions of viruses, bacteria and other "foreign" matter.
The antibodies latch on to proteins on the surfaces of the viruses and bacteria.
Each line of the laboratory-made monoclonal antibodies is designed to seek out and latch on to a specific protein such as, in this case, the beta-amyloid protein.

   The hope, Mr. Marotta said, is to attach radioactive tracer molecules to the amyloid antibody.
The antibodies, upon being injected into a patient, would seek out beta-amyloid protein.
A radiation-detecting camera could then tell whether the patient is producing abnormal amounts of beta-amyloid protein, a distinctive feature of Alzheimer's disease.

   It isn't known whether the antibodies would be able to get from the blood into the brain and the amyloid-rich brain lesions.
However, Mr. Marotta said, in Alzheimer's patients the beta-amyloid also accumulates in the blood vessels, where it would be readily accessible to the monoclonal antibodies.
Clinical trials of the antibody diagnostic test would be done by the federal National Institute on Aging, which is funding the research, the scientist said.

   Mr. Marotta and Ms. Zain also have cloned the amyloid protein gene and have transplanted it into cells grown in a test tube.
This line of cells is now producing excessive quantities of beta-amyloid protein, also known as A4 peptide.
As a result, the cells "become a very interesting model" for studying the over-production of the protein in Alzheimer's disease, Mr. Marotta said.

   The amyloid-producing cells also can be used to design and screen chemicals to find those that might interrupt the outpouring of the protein, the scientist said.
If found, such drugs wouldn't cure the disease but "they may help keep it from getting worse" since the accumulation of the protein and the destruction of brain cells seem to go hand-in-hand, he explained.
"There's a lot of interest from commercial companies" in using the amyloid-producing cells for such drug screening and "negotiations are on-going," Mr. Marotta said.

   Ms. Zain said efforts now are under way to transplant the human amyloid gene into mice, producing a strain of so-called transgenic mice that could be used for developing and testing treatments for Alzheimer's disease.

Technique Studied
For SIDS Babies

Abnormal Nerve Impulses
Detected in Some Infants

   A new technique to analyze heartbeats may eventually be used to predict which babies are at most risk for sudden infant death syndrome, or SIDS, researchers reported.

   SIDS is a largely mysterious affliction that kills about one in every 500 infants, usually without warning.
Earlier research suggests that up to 10% of SIDS babies die from respiratory defects that cause them to stop breathing.
Other causes, however, are little understood.

   Using a new method to analyze data from electrocardiograms, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital said they detected subtle abnormalities in nerve impulses controlling heartbeats that may account for some 50% of SIDS cases.

   The scientists cautioned that their study was too small to draw definitive conclusions about SIDS or to immediately provide a test for the disorder.

   Reported in today's New England Journal of Medicine, the study involved analysis of electrocardiograms from 10 infants who died of SIDS and 29 normal babies.
The analysis was based on computerized techniques originally developed by an astrophysicist to detect patterns in electromagnetic radiation from space.

   The researchers found that five of the SIDS infants had nervous-system abnormalities that may have caused a breakdown of heartbeat control, particularly when the infants' hearts speeded up.

   If supported in further studies, the finding may eventually be used to identify at least some of the babies at risk for SIDS, enabling doctors to counteract the threat with drugs that control heartbeat.

   Separately, another research group at Massachusetts General Hospital reported a new technique for predicting which heart-disease patients are at high risk for heart attacks.

   The researchers found that high absorption by the lungs of radioactive thallium, a tracer widely used to make images of the heart, indicates increased risk for heart attacks.

   The finding, also reported in this week's New England Journal of Medicine, provides a simple way to identify which heart-disease patients should undergo more complex, expensive tests to determine whether they are good candidates for heart-bypass operations or other surgical treatments, the researchers said.

   A new test can reveal who will get the lethal,
inherited Huntington's disease, but doctors have found no rush of
people wanting to learn their fate.
   Doctors from the New England Huntington's Disease Research
Center described their experience with the first 16 months of a
testing program in a report in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   The newly available test can reveal which people with the
illness in their families are likely to carry the Huntington's
disease gene themselves. Such people face a 50-50 risk of getting
the disease, often when they reach their 30s or 40s.
   The doctors, who began offering the test in 1986, said 250
people at risk of the disease inquired about the test. However,
fewer than 20 percent came in for an initial appointment. The
doctors eventually studied 47 people, but 19 of them withdrew
before their test results were known.
   ``The relatively low number of participants may indicate that
once something is actually available, people become more
cautious,'' said Dr. Joseph B. Martin of Massachusetts General
Hospital. ``It takes a fairly introspective person to decide to
know the results.''
   Of those who went through with the testing, four people were
found to probable carriers of the Huntington's genes, while seven
others were shown to be free of it.
   In five people, the test could not provide a definitive answer.
Seven people are awaiting for test results. The doctors were able
to diagnose five other people as having early signs of the disease
without needing the genetic test.
   ``Our main concern has been the impact that the test results
have on each person's life now and in the future,'' said Dr.
Richard H. Myers of Boston University Medical School, the program's
research coordinator.
   The people who were found to carry the Huntington's gene were
shocked and surprised by the news.
   ``All indicated that although they were aware that their test
could be positive, they did not actually expect such a result,''
the researchers wrote.
   These people suffered moderate to severe bouts of depression,
which eased over the following year.
   The New England screening center is operated by Boston
University Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital and
McLean Hospital. The screening test also is offered at Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and the University of British
Columbia in Vancouver.
   Huntington's disease destroys brain cells. Victims are afflicted
by uncontrollable movements. Eventually they lose their memory as
well as their ability to walk, talk and swallow.

   BOSTON -- Researchers here reported preliminary human
tests with an experimental drug for adult-onset diabetes
indicating it can regulate blood sugar better than injected
insulin can.
   The drug, called insulinotropin, is a naturally occurring
hormone produced in the intestines when we eat. It causes the
release of insulin from the pancreas, which in turn regulates
blood-sugar levels. The drug promises to mimic the natural
process of blood-sugar regulation better than injecting
insulin does, lessening complications of Type II, or
adult-onset, diabetes.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Adult-onset diabetes afflicts an estimated 10 million
Americans. Many cases can be controlled without drugs through
diet and exercise, but about a third of them require insulin
injections and might benefit from insulinotropin. The drug,
discovered in 1986 at Massachusetts General Hospital here,
has been licensed to California Biotechnology Inc., Mountain
View, Calif., which is developing it in collaboration with
Pfizer Inc., New York. Insulinotropin potentially will have
annual sales of $200 million to $400 million, estimates David
K. Stone, analyst with Cowen &amp; Co.
   The drug won't be useful for treating diabetics with the
more severe juvenile-onset, or Type I, diabetes -- their
pancreases don't produce insulin, so insulinotropin can't
stimulate its release in them. But it may eventually displace
a significant portion of injectable-insulin sales, estimated
at more than $500 million annually. Eli Lilly &amp; Co. is the
dominant seller of insulin, which also is sold by Novo
Industri AS of Denmark.
   Insulin induces liver and muscle cells to absorb glucose
from the blood, keeping blood-sugar levels under control as
they rise after a meal. When diabetics inject insulin,
however, its levels don't vary in concert with levels of
glucose. That can cause blood glucose levels to fall too
much, inducing dangerous "hypoglycemic" shock. Moreover,
scientists believe diabetics' wide swings in glucose levels
also cause many of the disease's complications, including
blindness, clogged arteries leading to heart disease, and
kidney damage.
   Animal studies have shown insulinotropin's
insulin-releasing effect falls off in conjunction with a drop
in blood sugar, indicating it can control glucose in a more
natural pattern than insulin injections can, said Joel F.
Habener, who is leading research on insulinotropin at
Massachusetts General Hospital. He added that unlike injected
insulin, insulinotropin doesn't expose muscle and other cells
to frequent doses of insulin -- another source of side
effects, including the breakdown of tissue at injection
sites.
   In the latest study, nine people with Type II diabetes and
two non-diabetic volunteers were given continuous intravenous
doses of insulinotropin while fasting and while eating at the
Boston hospital. During the infusions, their insulin levels
rose by a factor of three but, as hoped, fell as blood
glucose levels did. The results of the study are reported in
the February issue of the journal Diabetes Care.
   "We had no problems with hypoglycemia even with whopping
doses" of insulinotropin, said Dr. Habener. He cautioned,
however, that clinical tests on the drug are expected to
continue for at least two more years before it becomes widely
available to diabetics.
   Ken Luskey, California Biotechnology's director of
diabetes and obesity research, added that Pfizer is
separately conducting Phase II clinical trials with the drug,
aimed at establishing its efficacy. The results of those
tests haven't been disclosed.

weighing only half what they should, their bellies swollen, their
muscles wasting away, their skin peeling and scabbed, their eyes
blinded.
   In the burn ward, tiny bodies wrapped in gauze soaked with
ointment writhe in pain, their hands tethered to keep them from
contracting and deforming, their faces fixed with fear.
   These children were born into a political and economic schism
that has isolated Vietnam from most of the Western world and the
aid it needs so badly. The Vietnamese government spent years
subsidizing war against the French, Japanese, Americans, Chinese
and Cambodians instead of investing in medicine, science, education
and the care of its 64 million people.
   North Vietnam won the war in 1975, two years after U.S. military
forces left South Vietnam for good, but its aging communist
leadership lost the battle to manage the country in peacetime.
After the war, Vietnam closed itself off from the outside world and
did little to improve its socialistic lot.
   Indeed, many hospitals such as Pediatric No. 1 are old and
ill-equipped, inviting infections. Plaster roofs are caving in,
air-conditioners are covered with rust and water seeps across the
floors. Most hospitals haven't received any new equipment since the
end of the war.
   A typical provincial 400-bed general hospital in Tay Ninh west
of Ho Chi Minh City has a budget of only $32,500 a year to treat
more than 100,000 patients and pay a staff of nearly 500 people.
Despite a 100-bed surgical ward, it has less than half of the
surgical tools it needs, forcing patients to wait for surgery.
Surgeons earn a base pay of only $6 a month, what an American
teen-ager makes in an hour or two at McDonald's.
   ``The most important problem for us is the problem of
equipment,'' says Dr. Nguyen Huy Phan, a plastic surgeon and
leading member of the State Committee for Science and Technology.
   ``It's desperate,'' says Dr. John Constable, a plastic surgeon
at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who was in Vietnam on
his 11th visit to study the effects of Agent Orange and to teach.
   Vietnam was distracted from building its economy, its trade and
its institutions in 1978 when its armed forces invaded and occupied
Cambodia and later fought China in a northern border war.
   Western nations, including the United States, ostracized Vietnam
for its occupation of Cambodia. The United States refuses to
establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam and give it aid until
it pulls all of its forces out of Cambodia, elections are held, and
Cambodia is neutral and non-aligned.
   Vietnam claims it has withdrawn all but 50,000 of its troops and
will have those out by Sept. 30. Acknowledging its economic
policies have failed, Vietnam is courting the United States and its
capitalism as a prelude to what it hopes will be the lifting of an
American trade embargo and the return of economic, medical and
management aid.
   Vietnam now survives on aid from the Soviet Union and some
humanitarian aid from some Western countries. Some assitance comes
from non-government charitable organizations and individuals in the
United States, including the American Friends Service Committee in
Philadelphia, a Quaker group, and World Vision, a Monrovia, Calif.,
Christian agency. Increasingly, Vietnam veterans are lending a hand.
   Seven American plastic surgeons and two other physicians, the
first group of American doctors to work in Vietnam since the end of
the war, operated on 101 children in February to correct mouth
deformities, including cleft lips, as part of ``Operation Smile,''
a Norfolk, Va., based charitable agency.
   ``Every time I come, I bring them a couple of thousand dollars
worth of sutures,'' says Constable of Massachusetts General. ``They
go very fast.''
   `It's a social economic problem, not only a medical problem,''
says Dr. Tran Ngoc Manh, a vice director of Pedatric Hospital No.
1, which cares for children from birth to age 15 in Ho Chi Minh
City and 14 provinces to the south.

   Alexander Ellis II, brother-in-law of President
Bush and a prominent businessman, died Friday of a stroke. He was
67 years old.
   Ellis was married to Nancy Walker Bush Ellis, sister of the
president. He had been hospitalized for the past two weeks at
Massachusetts General Hospital and had undergone an intestinal
operation Monday, said his son, Alexander III.
   President Bush was ``very close to the family. He has been in
touch constantly through this two and a half weeks,'' Alexander III
said.
   Ellis was born April 9, 1922, in Cambridge, son of Alexander
Ellis, the founder of Fairfield and Elllis, an insurance brokerage.
   He attended Yale University and served as a lieutenant in the
82nd Airborne Division in Europe during World War II. He was
wounded during the Battle of the Bulge.
   He married Nancy Bush in 1946. He joined his father's firm and
became president during the late 1960s and chief executive officer
in 1975.
   Ellis was active in state Republican politics, serving as a
state committeeman and a delegate to the 1964 Republican
convention. He also served on the board of the YMCA and an overseer
for Massachusetts General Hospital.
   In 1986, he sold Fairfield and Ellis to Carroon and Black, a New
York-based insurance brokerage, but remained as chairman of the
company's Boston office and was active in the business until his
recent hospitalization.
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Alexander
Ellis III, John Prescott Ellis and Josiah Wear Ellis; a daughter,
Nancy Walker Ellis Black; and four grandchildren.
   The funeral is scheduled Tuesday morning, the family said.

<HEAD>Insurer Cites Blood Fraud in Refusing to pay AIDS Claim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An insurance company is refusing to
pay a $2 million life insurance claim to the survivor of an AIDS
victim, saying the victim used someone else's blood to qualify for
coverage.
   Lawyers for Massachusetts General Life Insurance Co. want a
federal judge in Fort Lauderdale to throw out the $2 million claim
by Anthony C. Fioretti, who died of AIDS on Feb. 28, 1989, in
Broward County.
   Fioretti, 40, tested positive for the HIV virus and was rejected
by another insurance company less than a month before virus-free
blood was used in his application to Massachusetts General, the
lawyers say.
   ``The person submitting blood for HIV testing on (June 29, 1987)
was not in fact Fioretti, but represented himself and his blood
sample to be that of Fioretti,'' the suit says.
   Fioretti also used the name ``Finetti'' on the application to
make it more difficult for insurance investigators to discover
through national computer records he had previously tested positive
for AIDS, the suit says.
   Despite the proliferation of AIDS cases nationwide, the
Massachusetts General lawsuit is one of only a handful of cases
filed in federal court involving AIDS victims accused of trying to
enrich survivors through fraudulent insurance claims, according to
a report in Saturday's Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale.
   Fioretti, a former New York City florist, had been paying
$30,365 per year in premiums to maintain his $2 million insurance
coverage since July 1987. The sole beneficiary was listed as
Fioretti's brother, Vincent, of Plantation, who has an unlisted
phone number and could not be located for comment.
   Last month, Fort Lauderdale attorney Steven Fine filed suit on
behalf of Vincent Fioretti to force Massachusetts General to pay
the $2 million claim. Calls to Fine's office went unanswered
Saturday.
   Mark F. Hughes Jr., an attorney for Massachusetts General in
Newark, N.J., said the company _ in accordance with insurance laws
_ has offered to refund Fioretti's premium payments, with interest,
to his brother. The offer was rejected, he said.
   Hughes said the insurance company has filed a countersuit in
federal court in New York City, where the blood tests were
performed, asking the court to dismiss Fioretti's claim.
   ``How do we know that an imposter submitted the blood?,'' Hughes
asked rhetorically. ``We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that
Fioretti died of AIDS. We know that AIDS does not kill you
immediately so he had to have had it before his death. And we know
that in January 1987 his blood tested positive for HIV.''
   If the company knew he had the AIDS virus, Massachusetts General
would have never issued the policy, he said. The suit argues that
because of alleged fraudulent acts by Fioretti, his application was
void before it was accepted.

toxins and other risk factors attack DNA, the basic genetic material in cells,
and cause cancer.;    The finding may signal the start of what Dr. Stephen H.

ability to attribute a particular cancer unequivocally to a particular
cancer-causing agent.;    Right now, for example, attempts to link lung cancer

a convincing demonstration that specific environmental factors induce specific
mutations in cancer.";    In the latest work, researchers from the National
Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., and Massachusetts General Hospital said two
risk factors already implicated in liver cancer seemed to damage the hot spot,
providing a possible fingerprint of how those toxic agents committed their
crime.;    One suspected risk factor is a fungal poison called aflatoxin,
which contaminates grain and other foods improperly stored in warm, moist
places. Such contamination is a widespread problem in humid regions such as
sub-Saharan Africa and parts of the Far East, precisely the regions where
liver cancer abounds.  </TEXT>

   New Device Set
   To Eliminate
   Kidney Stones

   BOSTON -- Scientists here have developed an inexpensive
device to remove kidney stones that promises to substitute in
many cases for the far more expensive "lithotripsy" machines,
which pulverize stones with shock waves.
   The new machine, which costs about $6,000, is still
experimental and has been tested only on a handful of
patients. In an initial report on human trials with it at
Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital, researchers said the
machine worked successfully on 14 of 16 patients with kidney
stones. The results were scheduled for presentation yesterday
at a urology meeting in Toronto.

<TEXT>
   Kidney stones, which afflict about 350,000 Americans
annually, mainly middle-aged men, are painful calcium
crystals that often lodge in the kidneys or in the ureters,
ducts that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.
Currently, the stones typically are removed by lithotripters,
million-dollar machines that focus shock waves from outside
the body to pulverize stones. Laser systems costing about
$240,000, which break up stones with pulses of laser light
conducted through optical fibers, are sometimes used,
especially on ureter stones.
   The new machine, called an electromechanical impactor,
works like a tiny jackhammer, said Stephen Dretler, a
urologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who helped to
develop and is testing the machine. The machine employs a
spring enclosed in a large, needle-like device, which is
snaked into the urinary tract via a tube until it is next to
a stone. An electrical spark causes a small explosion within
the device, repeatedly thrusting a metal head on one end of
the spring against the stone until it breaks up.
   The device was developed by researchers at the hospital
and Physical Sciences Inc., a closely held technical
consulting firm in Andover, Mass. Physical Sciences has
formed a unit to develop the machine and seek Food and Drug
Administration approval to market it, said a spokesman for
the firm.
   In the first round of tests on the 16 patients with kidney
stones, the device failed in two cases in which the stones
were too hard to break, said Dr. Dretler. The tests also
indicated the machine is very safe, he added. It "doesn't
injure tissue" because its force is confined and directed
only at the stones, he explained.
   The machine initially is aimed at use in small hospitals
for treating stones lodged in the ureter, which cause about
half of kidney-stone cases. The machine also may prove
popular in the Third World, where lithotripters are rare,
said Dr. Dretler. "If you have a lithotripter, you probably
would use it on kidney stones" rather than the new device, he
added, because lithotripters don't require insertion of a
tube into the urinary tract. Moreover, the laser blasters, if
available, may be preferable to the new device because they
require insertion of a smaller tube into the urinary tract
than the new machine does, he said.
   But improved versions of the new device eventually may
compete directly with lithotripters, made by Dornier
Medizintechnick G.m.b.H. of Germany and other companies, and
with laser systems made by Candela Laser Corp., Natick, Mass.
"I think we'll be able to use the device {to pulverize} small
stones up in the kidney," thus providing a cheaper
alternative to lithotripters in many cases, said Dr. Dretler.
   Moreover, the new device's safety and ease of use may
enable doctors to treat kidney stones without giving
anesthesia and without having to insert additional
instruments now used with laser devices to peer at stones
while destroying them, he said.

   Researchers here reported promising results with a new imaging technique for detecting sites of infection and possibly some kinds of cancer.

   The experimental technique, developed at Massachusetts General Hospital, is easy, fast and cheap, and hence it might benefit tens of thousands of patients annually in the U.S. who get hard-to-spot pockets of infections, said Robert Rubin, a doctor who helped develop the technique.
Such patients include people who have had abdominal surgery, those with joint pain possibly due to infection and people with unexplained fevers suspected to be caused by hidden infections.

   The technique employs radioactive tracers linked to human immune molecules called IgG, which home in on inflamed areas stemming from infections.
When injected, the substance highlights sites of inflammation in pictures taken with so-called gamma cameras, which already are widely used for different imaging purposes.
The radiation exposure from an injection is comparable to that of an abdominal X-ray, the Massachusetts General researchers said.

   In a study of 128 patients with suspected infections, the technique correctly identified 51 who actually were infected, the researchers reported.
In five of the 51 infected patients, a commonly used imaging technique called CT scanning failed to reveal sites of infection.
The new technique didn't miss any of the infected patients, but it incorrectly indicated that five patients without infections had them.

   The study was reported in today's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.
In an accompanying editorial, doctors at the State University of New York at Stony Brook said the new technique's ease of use should allow it to be used "in a wider array of medical facilities" than other infection-screening methods based on radioactive tracers.

   The Massachusetts General researchers also reported that the new technique correctly revealed tumors in 13 of 16 patients who had them.
Dr. Rubin said the technique apparently shows tumors that are under attack by immune cells in a process that causes inflammation.
He added that the technique might someday be used to help detect the spread of cancer cells and to show which patients need immune boosters to help destroy their tumors.

   The technique has been licensed to Johnson &amp; Johnson, which is conducting separate clinical trials on it, Dr. Rubin said.

<HEAD>Boston Children Hospitalized Twice as Often as Rochester Youngsters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poor children are more likely than wealthier
children to be hospitalized when they are sick, and hospitalization
rates vary dramatically between cities, a study has found.
   In their review of three cities, researchers found Boston
youngsters were about 2{ times more likely than children in
Rochester, N.Y., to be admitted to hospitals, while those in New
Haven, Conn., fell between the two.
   Despite Boston's higher rate, however, it was still below the
national average.
   ``If the general quality of care is no worse in Rochester than
elsewhere, other cities may be able to lower their number of
hospital beds and the cost of in-patient health care of chidren,''
the doctors wrote.
   The researchers noted that poor children are more likely than
wealthier youngsters to be put in the hospital when they get sick,
which may help explain the differences in hospitalization rates
among the cities.
   The study speculated that Boston's hospitalization rates were
higher than Rochester's because the city is poorer. They said poor
youngsters may have more severe illness and less access to
outpatient care. Doctors may also be more likely to admit them
because of concern about the chidren's home care.
   Earlier research has shown regional differences in hospital
admissions for adults.
   The study was conducted by Dr. James M. Perrin of Massachusetts
General Hospital with colleagues from Children's Hospital in Boston
and Dartmouth Medical School. It was published Wednesday in the New
England Journal of Medicine.
   The study was based on 1982 data, and the researchers said they
assumed that hospitalization rates have fallen since then.
   Boston hospitalization rates for upper respiratory infections,
ear aches, croup and poisoning were more than five times higher
than in Rochester. However, hospitalization for surgery was similar
in the three cities.
   The researchers noted that if Boston children had been
hospitalized at the same rate as those in Rochester, only 1,858 of
the city's 4,927 medical admissions in 1982 would have occurred.
   The three cities were chosen for the study because they all have
hospitals affiliated with medical schools.

   The gaping hole in Gayane Gasparian's skull is
healed and the 12-year-old girl was eager to return to Armenia. But
doctors say she faces an uncertain future in her
earthquake-shattered homeland.
   She and 9-year-old Artjom Gasparian, who is also heading home
today after medical teatment here, probably will end up living in
makeshift housing, possibly even tents, doctors said.
   ``It's hard,'' Dr. Nishan G. Goudsouzian said. ``They don't know
what's waiting for them at the end of the line.''
   They are among 14 children returning to the Soviet Union today,
two months after U.S. doctors brought them from Armenia for
treatment of injuries they suffered in December's devastating
earthquake.
   They leave behind 23 other children who require additional care.
   The children, ages 9 to 14, were brought to hospitals in
Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Missouri by
Project Hope, after a team of doctors who visited victims of the
earthquake selected them for advanced care.
   A day before her scheduled departure, Gayane danced in the lobby
of Massachusetts General Hospital shouting ``Armenia, Armenia!''
   In February, Gayane had a large hole in her skull with just a
thin patch of skin protecting part of her brain. Doctors grafted
skull from the back of her head onto her forehead.
   Artjom, who is not related to Gayane, arrived at Massachusetts
General with two badly crushed legs. The boy's grandmother, who
shielded him while he was buried underneath rubble for four days,
died from her injuries.
   ``In the beginning when they told me to stand up, I was scared,
I had no muscles,'' said Artjom, speaking through an interpreter.
``But now I can stand up.''
   Artjom walked into a room at the hospital barely using one
crutch. Doctors said he would have to learn to walk again because
of a lack of wheelchair facilities in Armenia.
   Gayane, Artjom and their mothers stayed in Armenian-American
homes in nearby Watertown during their treatment. They attended an
Armenian school where Gayane learned the English alphabet, doctors
said.
   Gayane still needs plastic surgery to reconstruct three missing
fingers on her right hand. She hopes to return to this country for
the surgery but for now is looking forward to returning home,
doctors said.
   Goudsouzian, chief of pediatric anesthesiology, said Gayane
spent hours kissing pictures of a brother who died in the quake,
which killed more than 25,000 people and left many thousands
homeless.
   The returning children will be treated at a new outpatient
clinic established in Yerevan, Armenia, to track the quake victims.

Eradicates Some Tumors, Study Shows

   An experimental treatment for bladder cancer combining lasers and a drug wiped out tumors in almost half of the patients treated, a joint study by Chinese and U.S. researchers showed.

   The study, in which 19 patients were treated at a Chinese cancer clinic, was too small to prove that the treatment is better than conventional bladder cancer therapies.
But it significantly enhances the credibility of a new approach to fighting cancer, called photodynamic therapy, which is beginning to come of age as an anti-cancer weapon.

   The study was conducted by U.S. researchers at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital, the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and Roswell Park Memorial Institute in Buffalo, N.Y., and by Chinese researchers in a town about 550 miles west of Beijing in Henan province.
A report on the work appears in this week's New England Journal of Medicine.

   Photodynamic therapy involves the injection of a special "photosensitizing" drug that is preferentially absorbed by tumor cells.
When exposed to bright, but nonburning, laser light of certain colors, the drug generates toxic chemicals that kill cancer cells.

   In the study, researchers said the treatment eradicated tumors in nine of 19 patients; tumors were significantly reduced in nine of the remaining 10 patients.
The therapy's main side effect was that patients were not able to stay in the sun for about a month after treatment because of the possibility of severe sunburns caused by lingering traces of the photosensitizing drug.

   Chinese doctors are especially interested in photodynamic therapy because it is a "one-shot therapy," said George R. Prout, a Massachusetts General Hospital urologist who helped conduct the study.
The therapy requires a single-laser treatment about three days after patients are injected with the photosensitizing drug.
In a country with few cancer centers and limited transportation, that is a big advantage over conventional anti-cancer therapies, which typically require months of periodic treatments, he said.

   Photodynamic therapy using a drug called hematoporphyrin -- which has been approved for experimental use in humans in the U.S. -- has been tested in this country as an anti-cancer therapy since the mid-1970s.
Although some early tests of the treatment were promising, the therapy has several drawbacks that have slowed its development.
One is the necessity of shining light on targeted cancer cells, which means the therapy is of little use against large, thick tumors, or ones that are buried within tissues.

   However, the development of fiber optics -- flexible light-conducting tubes that can transmit laser light -- has enhanced the therapy's potential uses.
In the recent study in China, researchers threaded such tubes into patients' bladders through their urinary tracts.
Several U.S. research groups are testing photodynamic therapy using a similar approach against tumors in the bronchial tubes of the lungs, bladder cancer and some other cancers.

   Photodynamic therapy promises some advantages over alternatives in certain cases, said Bryan Shumaker, a urologist who is testing the therapy with bladder-cancer patients at Detroit's Henry Ford Hospital.
For example, he said, a photodynamic therapy variation in which the bladder's entire inner surface is blanketed with laser light may wipe out nascent tumors that are too small to be detected.
And the development of injectable, light-emitting chemicals may enable activation of the photosensitizing drug against tumors almost anywhere in the body.

   Mice being tested with such treatments literally glow in the dark, Dr. Shumaker said.

   U.S. clinical studies of photodynamic therapy currently are suspended because the only supplier of the photosensitizing drug, Johnson &amp; Johnson's Photomedica Inc. unit -- is being sold to Quadra Logic Technologies Inc. of Vancouver, B.C.
"We put the project on hold so we could gather together the existing data" on photodynamic therapy for Quadra, a Photomedica spokesman said.
Supplies will probably resume in December or January, when Photomedica's proposed sale to Quadra is expected to be completed, he added.

   A new way of dissolving the blood clots that cause heart attacks is under development.

   The new method is based on a specially designed monoclonal antibody that activates clot-dissolving chemicals only at the site of a blood clot.
In theory, the new technique should dissolve blood clots with less risk of bleeding occurring in other parts of the body, as can happen with current clot dissolvers.
It also would reduce or even eliminate the use of manufactured clot dissolvers, utilizing instead clot-dissolving substances naturally present in the body.

   The new concept hasn't yet been tried in humans, but its appearance on the research horizon throws a new element into the already furious competition among drug and biotechnology companies selling or developing clot-dissolving chemicals.
These companies include Genentech Inc.; Hoechst AG, of West Germany; Abbott Laboratories, Beecham Group PLC., of England, and its U.S. partner, Upjohn Co.; Collaborative Research Inc.; and Genetics Institute Inc.

   Research on the new clot-busting concept was described by Edgar Haber, the new president of the Squibb Institute for Medical Research, at a symposium in Princeton, N.J., celebrating the institute's 50th anniversary.
The institute is Squibb Corp.'s basic research arm.

   The new technique was initially developed in Dr. Haber's laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston, where he was head of cardiology and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School before moving to the Squibb institute in January.
The research effort is continuing at Massachusetts General and will remain there, Dr. Haber said.
He said the backing of a major pharmaceutical company would be needed to bring the new approach to clinical trials, but he declined to say whether any tie-ups with Squibb or any other company were in the offing.
Any marketable product would be a few years away, at the earliest.

   Dr. Haber said, however, that "this general area {of clot-dissolving research} is one that I'll be starting up" at Squibb as soon as he has the time.

   Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-produced versions of the antibodies the body produces to fight off invasions of "foreign" proteins like viruses.
The laboratory-made antibodies can be designed to "home in" on any particular protein.
For example, a predecessor to the new clot-dissolving technique was a monoclonal antibody that homed in on the protein, fibrin, which is the key component of blood clots.

   Dr. Haber's basic strategy is to take the antibody that homes in on fibrin and use it to concentrate a natural clot dissolver directly on the clot.
One major natural clot dissolver is known as tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA. TPA activates plasminogen, which ordinarily lies latent in the blood.
Once activated, plasminogen triggers a chemical chain reaction that destroys fibrin and thus dissolves the blood clot.
Current artificially produced versions of the clot dissolvers are infused into the blood stream where they promote a freer flow of blood throughout the body.
But that is done at the risk of causing hemorrhaging, something that should be avoided by the antibody, which triggers the clot-dissolving reaction only in the vicinity of the clot.

   In one approach, Dr. Haber explained, researchers are combining the antibody that binds to fibrin with the part of TPA that activates the clot-dissolving reaction.
In the test tube, these engineered proteins "showed increased potency and selectivity in thrombolysis {dissolving clots} in comparison to natural plasminogen activators," the scientist said.

   In a second approach, the researchers are fusing two antibodies together.
One end of the fused antibody homes in on fibrin while the other end grabs plasminogen activator from the blood, triggering the clot-dissolving reaction at the site of the clot.
The fused antibody might make it possible to use only small doses of manufactured TPA in a patient or else eliminate it altogether, Dr. Haber said.
"It is as yet uncertain as to which of these methods will prove most useful clinically," the researcher said.

   Dr. Haber's antibody-derived attack on blood clots is different from a monoclonal antibody developed by Centocor Inc. -- and which received considerable publicity a couple of weeks ago.
The Centocor monoclonal antibody is designed to prevent blood cells from clumping together to form clots.
The Centocor antibody made headlines in mid-October because university and company researchers tested its effectiveness in the body of a 78-year-old man soon after he had died of a stroke.

   A Centocor scientist, Harvey J. Berger, said laboratory and animal experiments show that the dosage of manufactured TPA can be lowered by 75% if the clot dissolver and the antibody are used together.
The lower dosage of TPA may reduce the risk of hemorrhaging, Dr. Berger said.
Clinical trials of the antibody-plus-TPA approach will get under way "soon," he added.

   The race to develop CD4 as therapy against AIDS has now entered the clinic, with human tests of the protein slated to begin today in the first of 50 patients.

   The test would be the first to gauge a therapeutic strategy that would employ a genetically engineered drug as a decoy to prevent infection of cells in the immune system by the AIDS virus.

   The initial test of the protein, manufactured by Genentech Inc., will take place at three centers: San Francisco General Hospital in affiliation with the University of California; New England Deaconess Hospital in affiliation with Harvard University; and the National Cancer Institute, a unit of the National Institutes of Health.

   The protein is normally found on the surface of T-4 cells, white blood cells that are infected and killed by the AIDS virus.
A synthetic version, prepared by means of recombinant DNA, is to be given in an intravenous infusion in the hope that flooding the body with false targets would mop up virus particles and prevent them from infecting cells of the body.

   At least seven competing groups are vying to develop CD4, including Genentech; SmithKline Beckman Corp. in collaboration with Columbia University, the University of Pennsylvania and the federal Centers for Disease Control; Biogen Inc., of Cambridge, Mass., a biotechnology company working with doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital; Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, working with Harvard Medical School; Basel Institute for Immunology in Switzerland; and most recently, GeneLabs Inc. of Redwood City, Calif.

   For patients, it is yet another hopeful agent added to the menu of drugs being tested against the fatal syndrome.
For scientists, it has the added excitement of blending two expanding spheres of knowledge -- that of recombinant DNA and AIDS virology.

   "To my knowledge, this is the first time a product of recombinant DNA technology has specifically been applied against a part of the AIDS virus life cycle to yield a possible therapy," said Samuel Broder, clinical oncology director of the National Cancer Insititute.
An older product of gene-splicing, recombinant alpha interferon, currently is used against Kaposi's Sarcoma, an AIDS-related malignancy.

   One patient is scheduled to begin receiving CD4 today at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., where the first AIDS patient received the inaugural test dose of AZT three years ago.

   Eventually, 50 AIDS and AIDS-related complex patients will be enrolled in the first phase of the study, which will consist of a two-week intravenous infusion at the National Cancer Institute portion of the trial.
In San Francisco and in Boston, doctors will give the drug as a series of injections, at first daily and then tapering off to three times a week.

   As in most early safety studies, doctors hope to escalate the dosage gradually to discover the thresholds of efficacy and of toxicity.

   So far, pre-clinical studies of CD4 have shown the drug to be safe when administered to test animals.
But only human tests can disclose human safety or efficacy of the protein.
Some scientists have speculated, however, that the protein -- because it is normally a part of cells of the immune system -- could at least theoretically disrupt immune functions of the body.

<HL> Biogen to Develop
Anti-Cancer Drug
In Pact With Merck

   Biogen N.V. said it signed agreements with Merck &amp; Co. to develop a genetically engineered protein that shows promise as a treatment for cancers of the female reproductive tract.

   Under the contracts, Biogen will receive payments from Merck for achieving certain research goals in developing the protein, Mullerian Inhibiting Substance.
If the protein eventually is approved for marketing as a drug, Biogen will manufacture it for Merck, which will sell it world-wide and pay royalties to Biogen.
The amounts of research payments and potential royalties weren't disclosed.

   The agreements, which will give Biogen a sorely needed new revenue source, boosted the company's stock 22%.
In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Biogen shares closed at $14.75, up $2.625.

   Biogen, a development-stage biotechnology concern, reported a net loss of $20.5 million on revenue of $8.4 million for the 1986 nine months.
One of the company's licensed products, alpha interferon, is a drug used to treat a rare form of cancer.

   Mullerian Inhibiting Substance, or MIS, "is an exciting product in theory," said Misha Petkevich, analyst with Hambrecht &amp; Quist.
"This is the first deal Biogen has made for a while," she added.

   Biogen scientists, in collaboration with Patricia Donahoe, a research physician at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital, were the first to make a genetically engineered version of MIS last June.
Analysts said Wall Street's reaction to the agreements was especially positive because they involved Rahway, N.J.-based Merck.

   "Merck is a top name in the drug industry, and it has been very selective in the biotechnology products it goes after," said Robert Kupor, analyst with Cable, Howse &amp; Ragen in Seattle.

   Biogen also said it will continue working with Massachusetts General researchers to further develop the substance.
The hospital is another "blue-chip name," said Mr. Kupor.

   MIS occurs naturally in male embryos and suppresses development of female reproductive organs.
Scientists hope that its cell-inhibiting effects also will apply to the rapidly proliferating cells of ovarian, cervical and related cancers.
"If it works against cancer, it could have unusually low side effects because it is so specific for certain cells," Mr. Kupor said.

   Chemical Linked
   To Huntington's
   Disease Is Found

   BOSTON -- Researchers here identified a brain-chemical
abnormality associated with Huntington's disease, providing a
clue to the inherited disorder's cause and suggesting new
treatment possibilities.
   The finding follows an earlier discovery of the
approximate location of the gene that causes the disease, an
invariably fatal mental and motor deterioration that
typically isn't apparent until midlife. The earlier work made
possible diagnostic tests that can reveal whether a person
has the gene, which makes eventual onset of the disease
almost certain. But there are no preventatives for the
estimated 125,000 Americans carrying the gene, nor effective
treatments for the 25,000 people who already have developed
the disease, which killed folk singer Woody Guthrie.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Recently, however, scientists have begun to unravel the
brain-chemistry disruption caused by the defective gene,
raising hopes for palliatives. Previous studies have
suggested that the disease causes excessive activation of
so-called NMDA receptors, certain molecules involved in
transmitting chemical messages between brain cells. How the
disease causes the overactivation has been unclear, though.
   The latest study, led by neurologist Flint Beal at
Massachusetts General Hospital, sheds light on that question.
Using a sensitive chemical analyzer, the researchers spotted
an abnormality in the levels of certain substances in the
brains of people who had died from Huntington's disease. In
particular, the finding indicates that the disease lowers
levels of kynurenic acid, which is thought to protect against
overactivation of NMDA receptors.
   The discovery opens the door to "more possibilities for
developing therapies" for the disease, said Robert McBurney,
vice president, research, at Cambridge NeuroScience Research,
Cambridge, Mass. His company and several other concerns are
developing experimental drugs to block overactivation of NMDA
receptors that accompanies strokes and certain other
disorders. Current drug candidates, however, may have side
effects that rule out their use over long periods to mitigate
Huntington's disease.
   The Boston study, published in the current issue of the
Journal of Neurochemistry, may lead to better candidates --
perhaps drugs to raise levels of kynurenic acid. It also
should help scientists more accurately replicate the disease
process in animals, said Dr. Beal, which would speed up
treatment research. Moreover, researchers at ESA Corp.,
Bedford, Mass., which makes the chemical analyzer used in the
study, hope to develop a simple and cheap diagnostic test for
the disease based on the distinctive pattern of neurochemical
abnormalities it causes.

   Michael Dukakis resumed his Democratic presidential
campaign today with a trip to New Jersey, as doctors said his wife
Kitty was ``doing very well'' in the aftermath of major back surgery.
   Doctors said Mrs. Dukakis came through the five-hour surgery
without problems and faced an ``excellent'' prognosis.
   Mrs. Dukakis was moved out of intensive care at Massachusetts
General Hospital this morning to the hospital's private wing,
hospital spokesman Martin Bander said today.
   He said her doctor reported that ``Mrs. Dukakis walked around the
room and showed good strength. She has no sign of the neurological
problem that necessitated the operation.'' Bander added, ``She's
doing very well. Her spirit's good.''
   After being with his wife since late Thursday at Massachusetts
General Hospital, the Democratic presidential front-runner flew to
Cherry Hill, N.J., for a picnic and other campaign events.
   Dukakis was picking up a campaign schedule broken off when he
flew back from San Francisco, canceling his last scheduled debate
with rival Jesse Jackson to be with his wife of 25 years when she
underwent urgent surgery to repair two herniated discs in her neck.
   The Massachusetts governor planned to return to see her again
tonight and spend the night at home, then return to New Jersey for
more events Sunday morning before flying back to California for
campaigning before Tuesday's primary finale.
   He did not plan to reschedule the debate with Jackson.
   ``I talked to Kitty in the recovery room and she said she wanted
an ice cream and a massage,'' Dukakis said following the surgery
Friday. ``I'm prepared to provide both.''
   Mrs. Dukakis was spending the night in intensive care, and faced
another week of hospitalization before she was expected to be
released. Doctors said she would wear a neck brace for six weeks or
more, and will limp for a number of weeks as a result of the graft
taken from her hip and fused between the vertebrae in her back to
replace the discs that were removed.
   ``She certainly is not going to be able to do any serious
campaigning for a while,'' Dukakis said.
   Dr. Nicholas T. Zervas and Dr. Lawrence Borges, neurosurgeons who
performed the operation, said Mrs. Dukakis appeared to have regained
full neurological function following the delicate surgery in which
disc fragments were found pressing against the spinal column.
   She was awake soon after surgery and reported that the numbness
and tingling sensations that had plagued her appeared gone.
   The doctors said that if uncorrected, the problem could have
resulted in paralysis from the shoulders down.
   ``The operation went very well. There were no problems at all,''
Borges said. ``I think the prognosis from this point should be
excellent.''
   Dukakis praised the doctors as ``terrific'' and said, ``We're
very, very relieved, and very pleased.''
   Zervas said Mrs. Dukakis would not require any special drug
treatment or attention as a result of a previous long-term
dependency on amphetamines. Last year she revealed she had been
addicted to the drug, prescribed as diet pills, for 26 years before
shaking the dependency at a drug clinic in 1982.

<HEAD>Gene Discovery May Shed Light on Kidney Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists reported today they have found the
approximate location of a defective gene causing an inherited
tendency toward kidney cancer, and that the gene also may help
cause kidney cancer in general.
   Genes lie along threadlike structures called chromosomes. The
gene in the study is in a general area already associated with
genetic abnormality in kidney cancer, the researchers said.
   If the gene plays a role in kidney cancer, which strikes some
18,000 Americans a year, studying it may lead to better diagnosis
and treatment, another expert said.
   The gene is now linked to Von Hippel-Lindau disease, for which
only a few hundred cases are known in the United States, according
to the National Organization for Rare Disorders.
   Usually striking in young adulthood, the disease can cause
tumors in the eye, brain and spinal cord that can damage eyesight
and nerve function. About 40 percent of people with the disease
develop kidney cancer, usually in both kidneys, and their prognosis
is poor, researchers say.
   Genes are chemical sequences that lie along chromosomes in every
cell of the body.
   The U.S., Canadian, British and Dutch scientists, whose study is
reported in today's issue of the British journal Nature, used a
``marker,'' which is a chemical sequence at a known location on a
chromosome and can be inherited along with a gene if it is close
enough.
   In a study of 203 members of nine families, including 71 who had
Von Hippel-Lindau disease, the marker was inherited along with the
defective gene 90 percent of the time, said James Gusella of
Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.
   Other studies have found that stretches of the chromosome
numbered 3 are missing in some kidney cancers. The new work shows
that the defective gene causing Von Hippel-Lindau disease resides
in the same general portion of the chromosome as the deletions,
researchers said.
   So the defective gene or a nearby one may play a role in at
least some sporadic kidney cancers, Gusella said.
   He explained that in its normal form, the gene may protect
against kidney cancer. Every cell gets two copies of a gene, so if
one copy is defective _ as in Von Hippel-Lindau disease _ the cell
has only one normal copy left. If that copy is damaged or deleted
during a person's lifetime, the cell could turn cancerous, Gusella
said.
   Under that theory, people without Von Hippel-Lindau disease
could get kidney cancer if both normal copies are damaged or
deleted during their lifetimes.
   The next step for researchers will be to find the gene and
isolate it for study.
   W. Marston Linehan of the National Cancer Institute, who has
studied chromosome deletions in kidney cancer, called the finding
very significant work that may help in learning about development
of kidney cancer.
   Such new understanding might lead to better diagnosis and
treatment, he said.

   Kitty Dukakis will undergo tests at a Boston
hospital to determine the cause of pain and numbness she has been
experiencing for the past month, campaign and hospital officials
said Wednesday.
   Mrs. Dukakis, the wife of Democratic presidential front-runner
and Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, was scheduled to arrive
in Boston Wednesday evening and check into Massachusetts General
Hospital, hospital spokesman Martin Bander said.
   A preliminary diagnosis Mrs. Dukakis received in California last
week indicated she has two herniated cervical disks in the neck
area. She was in California campaigning for her husband.
   Dukakis told reporters Wednesday that his wife might need
surgery but that a final decision would be made at the hospital.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 53, spent two days at the Canyon Ranch Health and
Fitness Resort in Tuscon, Ariz., after receiving the preliminary
diagnosis, according to a ranch spokeswoman.
   While at the Boston hospital, Mrs. Dukakis will be under the
care of Dr. Nicholas Zervas, chief of neurosurgery and a longtime
family friend.

Chemotherapy undergone before radiation treatment doubled the survival rate of
a group of patients with the most common type of inoperable lung cancer,
according to a national study released today in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Of the patients who underwent only radiation therapy, 11% survived three years
after treatment, contrasted with 23% who underwent five weeks of chemotherapy
followed by six weeks of daily radiation therapy, according to the lead author
of the study, Dr. Robert O. Dillman, medical director of the Hoag Cancer Center
in Newport Beach.
</P>
<P>
"The good news is that just by adding that little bit of chemotherapy, there
was a doubling in the survival rate," Dillman said. "The bad news is that still
didn't help about 75% of the patients."
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Glaspy, director of UCLA's joint oncology clinic, said the study
proves there are benefits to chemotherapy. But he noted that even the improved
survival rates in the study were not good.
</P>
<P>
"The big point to the reader is, you'd better quit smoking -- quick," Glaspy
said. "Because these big breakthroughs are changing survival rates by four
months (on average), and that ain't much."
</P>
<P>
The three-year study began in 1984 and examined 155 patients with inoperable
non-small-cell lung cancer, which affects as many as 40,000 Americans, Dillman
said.
</P>
<P>
It was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute and conducted by a
cooperative group of oncologists from Hoag, Massachusetts General Hospital in
Boston, Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, UC San Diego Medical Center, McGill
University in Montreal and the University of Missouri in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
Patients with this kind of inoperable cancer were given a five-week course of
chemotherapy -- two doses of the drug cisplatin and five doses of vinblastine.
The duration was short enough so that patients were able to tolerate the side
effects of the chemotherapy and still benefit from radiation treatment, Dillman
said.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by six weeks of daily treatments of high-dose radiation
therapy, concentrated on the chest area where the cancer was visible, Dillman
said.
</P>
<P>
Major tumor shrinkage was seen in 44% of the patients who got both chemotherapy
and radiation, contrasted with 35% in patients who received only radiation, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
After one year of treatment, 55% of those who underwent chemotherapy and
radiation therapy survived, contrasted with 40% among the radiation-only group.
Three years after treatment, 23% of the chemotherapy-radiation group had
survived, contrasted with 11% for the radiation-only group.
</P>
<P>
The three-year study was followed by three more years of tracking the patients
and analyzing the data, Dillman said. At last count, three of the chemotherapy-
radiation patients were still alive more than four years after treatment. Two
were from Massachusetts General Hospital and one from McGill University.
</P>
<P>
A confirming study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute is under way
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Dillman said the key finding is that chemotherapy, especially in earlier
stages, is more effective in lung cancer than many doctors realize.
</P>
<P>
"Most patients with lung cancer are diagnosed by family practitioners or
general internists, and they often have their initial care and treatment
decisions made by those physicians," Dillman said. "We know now that if we wait
until (final stages of lung cancer) then chemotherapy is really too late.
Patients will have severe side effects, won't tolerate the therapy, and it
won't help."

   Democratic presidential front-runner
Michael Dukakis cut short his California campaign Thursday and
canceled his final debate with rival Jesse Jackson to return to
Massachusetts and his wife Kitty who faced back surgery Friday
morning.
   ``She feels good; she's obviously a little apprehensive,''
Dukakis said after talking with his wife by telephone before
leaving San Francisco.
   Mrs. Dukakis' surgery was decided upon after her doctor in
Boston, Nicholas T. Zervas, examined results of tests done last
Saturday while she was in Los Angeles.
   She was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital Wednesday
night for further tests, and hospital spokesman Martin Bander said
she was experiencing ``considerable increasing discomfort.''
   ``Because of the worsening of the condition, we feel it
important to operate now,'' Zervas said.
   Mrs. Dukakis had complained for about a month of a numbness in
her hands and pain in her neck, said Mark Gearan, campaign press
secretary for the Massachusetts governor.
   The surgery is to correct two herniated cervical discs in the
neck area of her back, Gearan said. He said no other medical
problem was discovered.
   ``I think everything is OK and is going to be OK, but Dr. Zervas
felt it was better to operate now and not wait a few days,''
Dukakis told reporter.
   Bander, the hospital spokesman, said the operation involved
taking a bone graft from Mrs. Dukakis' hip to replace a portion of
bone in her back that is pressing against her spinal cord.
   ``The plan is to remove the discs compressing on the spinal
cord. The bone graft taken from the hip will be split and fused
into the vertabrae to replace the two areas from which the discs
will be removed,'' Bander said.
   Dukakis said he regretted having to cancel campaign appearances
but ``this is obviously the most important thing.'' He said he
hoped to resume campaigning Saturday or Sunday ``if everything is
OK.''
   His debate with Jackson was to have been the last debate by the
Democratic presidential candidates of the primary season. Both
Dukakis and Jackson were campaigning toward the June 7 primaries in
California, New Jersey, Montana and New Mexico.
   Jackson, in Los Angeles, said, ``I'm available to debate any
time.'' He said of Dukakis: ``His excuse is certainly an acceptable
one. ... I do fervently hope the debate can be rescheduled.''
   Among the other campaign events canceled was a scheduled stop in
Montana and a meeting with supporters in Des Moines, Iowa.
   Mrs. Dukakis' surgery was scheduled for 7:30 a.m. EDT at
Massachusetts General, with a surgical team led by Zervas, chief of
neurosurgery at the hospital.
   Gearan said doctors described her medical problem as ``a
degenerative condition'' apparently not caused by an injury. She
has been wearing a neck brace.
   Dukakis arrived in California from Massachusetts only Wednesday
night. He attended just one public event, a meeting with school
children on a San Francisco beach, before leaving.
   Dukakis first met privately with environmentalists at a
restaurant, the Cliff House, overlooking the rocky Pacific coast
where seals played in the ocean. He then walked down to a beach
where he spoke informally to 45 elementary school pupils about the
environment and the importance of using biodegradable products that
will not leave lasting pollution.
   On another subject, at a news conference, Dukakis said the
summit meeting just concluded in Moscow ``wasn't dramatic'' but
produced ``a series of small steps that are encouraging.''
   ``Obviously there's some disappointment there's not a START
(strategic arms reduction) agreement, but that doesn't mean we
can't have one,'' he said.

   Common Drug May Help
   To Keep Arteries Clear


</LP>
<TEXT>
   THE BUILDUP in arteries of fatty deposits that can cause
heart attacks may be blocked by a commonly prescribed drug.
   New studies are producing tantalizing hints that the drug
nifedipine prevents atherosclerosis, the clogging of arteries
that nourish the heart with oxygen-rich blood. The drug is
used to treat high blood pressure and angina, chest pains
associated with coronary heart disease. Nifedipine is one of
a class of drugs, called calcium channel blockers, that keep
arteries and veins open by impeding the flow of calcium into
muscle cells that surround blood vessels.
   Some scientists believe calcium also is involved in the
formation of fatty deposits. Scientists at Vanderbilt
University tested this idea in rabbits genetically
predisposed to atherosclerosis by feeding them a
cholesterol-rich diet. After four months, rabbits given the
drug had clear arteries, while the arteries of those denied
the drug became plugged.
   Because of this and other animal studies, researchers at
Johns Hopkins Hospital recently compared nifedipine's effect
with a placebo in preventing plaque formation in 144 patients
who had undergone bypass surgery to replace obstructed
arteries. After a year, the new arteries were clear of
deposits in 52% of patients given a placebo, while 67% of
those taking nifedipine were deposit-free.
   Doctors at Hannover Medical School in Hannover, West
Germany, just produced similar findings in a three-year study
of 435 patients with mild angina. Their finding, published in
the British medical journal the Lancet, found that the
drug-treated group had 28% fewer new artery obstructions than
those in the group taking a placebo.
   Nifedipine is sold under the brand name Procardia by
Pfizer Inc. A spokesman for the company said it is planning
further tests.


   Lyme Disease Protein
   Signals Early Detection


   THE DISCOVERY of a gene is holding promise of a better
method for detecting Lyme disease.
   Lyme disease is a potentially serious arthritis-like
ailment caused by a bacteria borne by certain tiny ticks.
Incidence of the disease, identified in 1975, is on the rise,
and outbreaks are especially common starting about this time
of year. Roughly half of the people bitten by the
bacteria-bearing tick develop the problem, but detecting it
is difficult because of its vague early symptoms, such as
fatigue and headaches, and because diagnostic tests are
imprecise.
   An accurate test is crucial because the bacteria can be
eradicated, but only if treated early with antibiotics.
Current tests detect the presence of antibodies produced by
the body to fight off the bacteria, but many people produce
too little antibody to be measured by the tests.
   Rance LeFebvre and Guey-Chuen Perng at the University of
California at Davis and Russell C. Johnson at the University
of Minnesota say they found a gene that produces a protein
common to many forms of the bacteria. The researchers say
they can detect minuscule amounts of antibody stimulated by
the protein.
   A U.S. subsidiary of Akzo N.V. of the Netherlands has
acquired the rights to develop a commercial diagnostic test
and also a vaccine that might protect people against the
bacterial infection.


   Zeroing In on Genes
   Linked to Alzheimer's


   SCIENTISTS SAY they have located a gene involved in
causing a type of Alzheimer's disease that strikes late, at
about 69 years of age.
   The new finding by researchers at Duke University greatly
buttresses claims that the degenerative brain disorder can be
inherited. The discovery, which hasn't been published,
suggests that two different genes are associated with
Alzheimer's disease. In 1987, researchers at Massachusetts
General Hospital reported uncovering the first gene, but
their finding became controversial when studies by the Duke
group and others couldn't replicate it in other families.
   Scientists now believe they have solved the problem: Many
people in the Duke study had inherited a different gene for
Alzheimer's. The gene located in the Massachusetts study
seems to predispose people to a form of the disease that hits
people early, in their 40s or 50s. That gene was traced to
chromosome 21, one of the 23 chromosomes in the nucleus of
every cell that contains all the human genes.
   The Duke researchers, led by Allen Roses, say their gene
is on chromosome 19. Neither set of researchers has found the
gene itself, but instead they have identified a gene marker
that is located near it.
   Scientists are now racing to duplicate the two reports and
isolate the exact genes, but the search is hindered by the
difficulty in finding families with multiple cases of the
disease, says P. Michael Coneally, a geneticist at Indiana
University, Indianapolis, who is gathering information on
such families under a government grant.


   Odds and Ends


   THE CENTERS for Disease Control says a state-by-state
telephone survey in 1988 found that the percentage of people
who claimed to know their cholesterol level ranged from 40%
in New Mexico to 58% in Maine. . . . Scientists at the
University of Oklahoma's department of otorhinolaryngology
say they have identified proteins produced by cells in the
inner ear in response to stress. The scientists say the
proteins protect the ear against noise and other potentially
damaging shocks and may provide clues to preventing some
types of hearing loss.

   Harold ``Doc'' Edgerton, a pioneer in
strobe and underwater photography and a professor emeritus at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died of a heart attack
Thursday. He was 86.
   Edgerton died at Massachusetts General Hospital after suffering
a heart attack at the MIT faculty club, where he was having lunch,
MIT said.
   The achievements of Edgerton, a much loved professor, spanned
history.
   Edgerton's revolutionary work in the use of strobe lights
captured images long hidden to the naked eye. His famous
photographs of a drop of milk splashing on a tabletop and of a
bullet shooting through an apple showed the world what time looks
like when it stands still.
   Edgerton's strobe lamps enabled the Allies to track enemy
movements at night during World War II. His strobes were used to
photograph the first atomic tests. His work in sonar helped locate
underwater wrecks and was used by undersea explorer Jacques
Cousteau.
   ``If it comes, it comes,'' Edgerton once said of his ideas and
inventions. ``It'll come by inspiration and God almighty and hit
you right in the middle of the night.''
   Edgerton, a native of Nebraska, had been at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology since 1926, when he started as a student in
electrical engineering. Officially retired from MIT in 1968, he
lived in an apartment next to the campus and still came into his
office five days a week.
   ``I got stuck,'' he said. ``But it's given me a very nice place
to work.''
   Most weekdays, Edgerton could be found in his laboratory at MIT,
just off MIT's ``Strobe Alley,'' where his work is displayed.
   In addition to his inventions, Edgerton and two former students
started a company called EG&amp;G in 1947 specializing in electronic
technology. Now a multi-million dollar engineering concern, the
company was under contract to the military and designed and
operated systems that timed and fired U.S. nuclear bomb tests.
   At a recent meeting of the Archaeological Society of America,
Edgerton offered words of advice to a group gathered to honor his
life's achievements.
   ``Work like hell, tell everyone everything you know, close a
deal with a handshake, and have fun,'' Edgerton told the society's
members.
   He was awarded a national medal of technology by President
Reagan in 1988. Undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau, who used some
of Edgerton's sonar equipment and the two collaborated in locating
the British Army ship, the HMS Britannia which was sunk by a mine
off the Greek coast during World War I. Cousteau nicknamed Edgerton
``Papa Flash.''
   Edgerton's influence even penetrated to the depths of the
Titanic. His Edgerton-Benthos underwater camera was used to
photograph the shipwreck when it was discovered in 1986.
   He is survived by his wife of 62 years, Esther, a daughter and a
son.

   Dr. Joseph Stokes III, professor of medicine and
public health at Boston University School of Medicine and the first
dean of the University of California at San Diego, has died. He was
64.
   He died Monday at University Hospital. The cause of death was not
immediately available.
   Stokes was graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Medical School
and also studied epidemiology and biostatistics at the Harvard
School of Public Health.
   He joined the U.S. Public Health Service in 1951 and was assigned
to the Framingham Heart Study.
   He later served as chairman of the Department of Preventive
Medicine at Harvard Medical School and directed the Family Health
Program at Massachusetts General Hospital.
   He served as a heart disease control officer for the Hawaii State
Department of Health and conducted a study of coronary heart disease
among native Hawaiian men and men of Japanese ancestry.
   He became dean at UC-San Diego in 1964 and was affiliated with
the school for 18 years.
   He also was a member of the section of preventive medicine and
epidemiology at the Evans Department of Clinical Research at
University Hospital.
   He recently received the Distinguished Service Award from the
American College of Preventive Medicine and was a past president of
both the Association of Teachers of Preventive Medicine and the
Association of Behavioral Sciences and Medical Education.
   He is survived by his wife, one daughter, three sons and three

   Doctors said they kept a dead man's heart
beating for an hour in a successful test of a drug designed to
prevent blood clots, but an ethicist is questioning the
experiment's technique.
   ``It raises such fundamental issues that it needs to be explored
before you can call it right or wrong,'' said ethicist and
physician Dr. John La Puma of Lutheran General Hospital, Park
Ridge, Ill. La Puma's editorial accompanies the medical report in
the current issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine, published in
Philadelphia.
   Researchers at the State University of New York at Stony Brook
and Centocor, a Malvern-based pharmaceutical company, said the test
successfully prevented the man's blood from clotting during the
hour-long experiment.
   The drug, called 7E3, also did not cause excessive bleeding, one
possible side effect of two commonly used anti-clotting drugs,
heparin and warfarin.
   Researchers used a portion of a single-cell antibody to block
the clotting. Such antibodies are often called a ``magic bullet'
because they seek out a specific cell.
   Blood clots can cause strokes or heart attacks, such as when
they travel to the brain or pulmonary arteries.
   The experiment was conducted on a 78-year-old man at the Stony
Brook hospital by researchers led by Barry Coller, a hematologist
at the university on New York's Long Island.
   Relatives of the man, who had been in a coma from a brain
hemorrhage, and the hospital's Institutional Review Board gave
permission for the test. The man had been placed on a respirator so
that his heart would continue beating during the experiment.
   The article did not say when the experiment was conducted.
   ``The advent of a specific treatment such as the antibody,
without causing side effects, would be a very welcome and important
addition to available therapies,'' Dr. Hamid Al-Mondhiry, a
hematologist at the Penn State Milton S. Hersey Medical Center and
a researcher in anti-clotting agents, said in a telephone interview.
   In his editorial, La Puma wrote that the experiment was
``ethically questionable,'' and added that the report did not
outline details regarding informed consent that he considers
essential. He noted the researchers received consent from the
hospital and were not the ones to contact the patient's physician
to ask for consent.
   The newly dead should be considered for such experiments only
when the work is of value to physicians treating patients, rather
than basic biological research, said La Puma.
   La Puma said he found three reported instances of scientists
experimenting on newly dead patients this century.
   Coller said using a newly dead patient allowed the investigators
to study the effects of several doses of the treatment. Using live
volunteers would have increased the time necessary to complete the
study, he said.
   ``In our setting, the experiment provided us important
information that was potentially useful in benefiting humans,
without exposing a living human to harm,'' Coller said in a
statement.
   The experiment will also provide data for prospective volunteers
in clinical studies, the article said.
   Coller said the patient's physician notified the researchers
that the patient could be eligible for the study.
   Coller said nine years of prior research at Stony Brook,
Massachusetts General Hospital and the University of Wisconsin had
shown that the agent 7E3 prevented blood from clotting in test
tubes, monkeys and dogs, and models designed to simulate impending
strokes and heart attacks in humans.

   Ron Webeck could barely walk,
couldn't talk and was nearly blind when he was flown to his
family's home to die of a devastating AIDS-related brain disease.
That was more than four years ago.
   Today, Webeck, 42, is thriving and researchers are trying to
find out why.
   ``I realize that I'm probably not supposed to be here,'' he
said. ``I've been given an incredible gift _ I'm cured.''
   Tests have failed to turn up the AIDS virus in Webeck's blood.
Even rarer is that scientists can no longer find a trace of the
virus that caused his brain infection _ progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy, or PML _ a disease that preys on AIDS victims
and usually kills within six months.
   ``Sure he's healthy _ he looks good, he feels good and he can do
anything he wants to do,'' said Dr. Joseph Berger, a University of
Miami neurologist and AIDS researcher who wrote about the case in
the medical journal Neurology.
   ``But I'd have to say with 99 percent certainty that he's
sitting on a time bomb,'' Berger said, ``That what caused his
illness in the first place is somehow being suppressed and will
come back.''
   AIDS researcher Sidney Houff, who examined Webeck at the
National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., calls his recovery
``remarkable,'' but he's not ready to call it permanent. ``What
exactly caused him to survive and recover is a mystery. We had
never seen anyone survive from it before. Up until that point,
everyone with PML had died a miserable death.
   ``There's no telling what may happen in the future. I'm hopeful
for him, but if his immune system is sufficiently challenged,
there's always the chance the virus that causes PML will reappear.''
   Webeck thinks doctors are being overly cautious.
   ``I'm going on five years now. How long do I have to be healthy
before they finally give up and agree I'm well?''
   For Webeck, who says he lived in the fast lane of San
Francisco's gay community in his 20s, the first signs something was
wrong came in the spring of 1985. While working as a waiter in
Provincetown, Mass., he felt an aggravating twinge in his neck. He
soon began falling down and had to quit because he could no longer
add customers' bills.
   A culture of spinal fluid taken at Massachusetts General
Hospital eight weeks later showed the presence of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. A scan
revealed lesions on his brain and a biopsy showed that PML had
infected his brain tissue.
   After weeks of violent illness and with his weight at just above
120, doctors suggested Webeck make plans to be with his family.
They thought he only had days to live. ``They didn't have to say
the word _ it was written all over their faces. They rushed me home
with no medicine, nothing.
   ``They figured, `What's the use?'''
   Dr. Leonard Mueke, who treated Webeck at Massachusetts General,
said he had to tell the patient and his family the dismal prognosis.
   ``Based on what we knew about other patients similarly
diagnosed, I don't think we had any option but to conclude that he
didn't have a very good outlook,'' said Mueke, now at the Scripps
Clinic in La Jolla, Calif.
   ``He was sent home with two medications to treat certain
symptoms of his illness that he opted not to take, but it's true we
had nothing to give him for his primary diagnosis of AIDS and PML.''
   Under his parents' care in St. Petersburg, Webeck suffered
through seizures and a bout with depression that ended in his
attempt to take an overdose of sedatives. After 10 days in the
hospital, he survived.
   ``That was a big turning point for me. I met death and was
spared. I started to realize I got some work to do before I go.''
   That's when, amazingly, Webeck started getting better.
   Without medical treatment, only an attitude shaped by books on
positive thinking and an insatiable will to live, Webeck began
forcing himself to eat and teaching himself to walk again. By July
1986, he set out to find a cause for his return to health. He wrote
to every major medical center and AIDS researcher in the country.
   After scores of encouraging but noncommittal responses, Berger
at Miami and then Houff at NIH agreed to make extensive
examinations. Some procedures were painful, such as tapping bone
marrow and spinal fluid, but Webeck hoped for clues that could help
others.
   Huff, who completed more than three weeks of examinations of
Webeck in June, found that all components of his immune system were
basically normal. One odd thing was that Webeck had the usual
number of B lymphocytes, white blood cells that produce antibodies
against disease. All other PML patients Houff had seen had produced
vast numbers of tainted blood cells that made their way into the
brain tissue and caused the infection.
   ``His immune system was able to shut down the production of B
lymphocytes and slow the progress of the disease,'' Houff said.
``Now, how he was able to do that is something we don't know.''
   Houff, who has moved to the Veteran's Administration Hospital in
Washington, D.C., and the faculty of Georgetown University,
currently has five other patients involved in his study. Four have
lived after bouts with PML, but for much shorter periods than
Webeck, and all but one are suffering other AIDS-related infections.
   Meantime, the tanned, mustachioed Webeck is stronger than ever,
recently put in the peculiar circumstance of being a one-time AIDS
patient forced to go on a diet when his weight topped 180 pounds.
   Webeck receives a disability check from Social Security, so he
has time to speak to churches and civic groups, and to care for a
friend with AIDS. He hopes to travel full-time to promote AIDS
research and to show that the virus does not always mean a death
sentence.
   ``I can't even count the number of people I've seen die from
AIDS,'' he said. ``Many of them were so devastated when they heard
they had it they sort of gave up. If people see me, maybe they will
think twice that miracles do happen.''

<HEAD>Doctor Terms Kitty Dukakis' Spinal Surgery `Urgent'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kitty Dukakis will undergo surgery Friday morning
to remove two herniated discs that are pressing on her spinal cord,
an operation described by one of her doctors Thursday as ``not
emergency but urgent.''
   Dr. James R. Lehrich said that if left untreated, the condition
could leave the wife of the Massachusetts governor paralyzed.
However, he said it appeared to have been spotted early, and there
was no sign of permanent damage.
   ``In view of the fact that this condition has quite definitely
worsened in the past 24 to 48 hours, it was felt that waiting even
until next week was taking a chance,'' he said at a news conference.
   Lehrich, a neurologist, is a member of a team that confirmed her
diagnosis at Massachusetts General Hospital, where she is scheduled
to have the operation.
   He said the damaged discs were first spotted by doctors at
Cedars of Lebanon Hospital in Los Angeles, where Dukakis was
campaigning for the California primary.
   Lehrich said he considered the surgery, known as cervical
laminectomy, ``not emergency but urgent.''
   Mrs. Dukakis' problems were caused by two herniated discs in her
neck. These discs serve as soft cushions between the bony vertebrae
that protect her spinal cord.
   In her case, these discs have squeezed out of place so that they
press on the spinal cord.
   Lehrich said this could cause severe damage to the spinal cord
resulting in permanent paralysis. ``Fortunately, she has come to us
early before any damage is evident.''
   At Boston University Medical Center, Dr. Ronald Mortara said
most people with herniated discs are treated first with bed rest,
traction and pain killers, and surgery is used only as a last
resort.
   However, he added, ``If someone has any evidence of spinal cord
compression, that becomes much more serious and urgent.''
   Lehrich said that discs can be damaged by injury or it can
happen spontaneously.
   He said the doctors are unsure what caused Mrs. Dukakis'
problems. ``We have seen no trauma, unless you consider that she
has been a dancer and moved her neck a lot,'' he said.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 53, has been a student and teacher of modern dance
for three decades.
   He said Mrs. Dukakis has suffered numbness and altered
sensations in her hands and feet as a result of herniated discs.
Although she noticed the problems several weeks ago, the symptoms
have worsened in recent days.
   Lehrich said the operation, which he described as major surgery,
would take several hours. The surgical team will include Dr.
Nicholas T. Zervas, the hospital's chief of neurosurgery and a
friend of the Dukakis family, as well as Drs. Lawrence Borges and

   Lehrich said serious complications of the surgery are very rare,
although they can include paralysis if the spinal cord is damaged.
   During the operation, doctors will remove bone from her hip and
use it to replace the damaged discs. Her recovery in the hospital
was expected to take one or two weeks.
   Doctors said that her problem, while not rare, is far less
common than herniated discs in the lower back that do not press in
the spinal cord.

   An Amtrak train from Washinton derailed and
slammed into a packed commuter train in Boston's Back Bay station
during this morning's rush hour, injuring 186 passengers, 10 of
them critically, officials said.
   The impact ``threw the trains in the air,'' and spilled 1,500
gallons of diesel fuel which caught fire in the downtown
underground station, said acting city Fire Commissioner John
Harrison.
   The commuter train from Stoughton, south of Boston, was hit by
Amtrak's Night Owl from Washington at 8:33 a.m., said Nancy
Sterling Gleason, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Bay Transit
Authority.
   Injured passengers, many of whom were trapped for a half-hour
underground, were taken to seven area hospitals.
   Jon Fasana, director of emergency services for the city, said
186 people were injured, including 10 critically. No deaths were
reported.
   A woman at the scene said one train looked like a ``twisted tin
can.''
   ``The doors all flew open. Some windows shattered. People were
all over the floor, screaming, crying,'' she said.
   Rescuers used hydraulic tools to get into the cars.
   Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black in Washington said the Night
Owl, which left Washington 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, apparently
``derailed on a curve and went into the side of the MBTA train on
an adjacent track.''
   Two passenger cars, two engines and two baggage cars on the
Night Owl went off the track and pushed two commuter cars onto the
next track, said Brent Bahler, a spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   Black said it was unclear what caused the train to derail.
Federal inspectors were due in Boston later today.
   Harrison said the trains collided with such force that the
street overhead buckled.
   A shopkeeper inside the station said the shelves in the store
trembled and ceiling tiles fell.
   ``My first reaction was to cover my cup of coffee,'' said Jeanne
Marie Hardin, ``and then somebody poked their head in the store and
said, `Call an ambulance.'''
   The station filled with smoke. Eyewitnesses said many
passengers, dazed and covered with soot, wandered out of the
station, some crying, many assisted by emergency personnel.
   One elderly woman, her face black with soot and wearing no
shoes, asked police: ``Where's my luggage? Where are my shoes?''
   About 50 people were taken to Massachusetts General Hospital but
their injuries did not appear serious, said spokesman Martin
Bander.
   A spokeswoman at Boston City Hospital had received 15 victims
with a variety of injuries, including cuts, broken bones and smoke
inhalation. One person was reported in critical condition with a
head injury.
   ``We were sitting on the train and the next thing - crash, bang,
boom,'' commuter train passenger Kathy Simons said as she was
carried away on a stretcher to an ambulance. ``I ended up on the
floor with a seat on top of me.''
   ``It was so bad, I said `I've got to get out of here in a
hurry,''' said a man who was on the Amtrak train. ``I got out and
just started heading for the light at the end of the tunnel.''
   Joe Povoas, a passenger on the commuter train, said: ``We were
sitting waiting in the station and the train just went lurch. The
lights immediately went out and the car filled up with smoke, real
gritty smoke, smoke you could grind with your teeth, you could spit
it out.''
   Back Bay Station, located near the landmark Hancock Building, is
jointly owned by the region's transit authority and Amtrak. It
draws commuter lines from Needham, Franklin, Framingham, Attleboro
and Stoughton lines as well as Amtrak trains and the Orange subway
line.
   Today's collision occurred 37 months after a nearly identical
crash between a commuter train and another Amtrak tain.
   Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the National Transportation
Safety Board in Washington, said his agency was assembling an
investigative team, which should arrive in Boston by this
afternoon.

<HEAD>Researchers Studying Use Of AZT By Health Care Workers Exposed To
AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some doctors and other health workers
exposed to the AIDS virus are taking the drug AZT as a preventive
measure, despite potentially serious side effects associated with
the anti-AIDS medication.
   AZT _ the only federally approved anti-AIDS drug _ can cause
muscle aches, nausea, headaches and severe anemia. Additionally,
medical experts have mixed opinions about using AZT, now known as
zidovudine, to prevent infection after exposure.
   Dr. Julie Gerberding of San Francisco General Hospital said she
is often asked whether the side effects of AZT outweigh the chances
of infection after a health worker is pricked with an AIDS-tainted
needle.
   ``I've been bombarded with calls from health care workers around
the country,'' said Gerberding, who is directing a study on the
risk of AIDS infection among health workers.
   Researchers believe AZT may keep the AIDS virus from installing
itself on the genetic material of cells if the drug is taken soon
after exposure, thus preventing AIDS infection. However, the
medical community is split over whether the drug should be
administered before a patient develops AIDS symptoms.
   Dr. Paul Volberding, an AIDS authority at San Francisco General,
said the odds of AIDS infection in a health care worker with a deep
cut who comes in contact with the virus may run as high as one in
100. He said 22 health workers worldwide have become accidentally
infected.
   Last month, Burroughs Wellcome Co., the only maker of AZT, began
a nationwide study of health workers accidentally exposed to the
virus.
   Karen Collins, a spokeswoman for the drug company, said workers
are required to enroll within five days of exposure. Half will
receive a six-week supply of the drug free of charge and half will
get a placebo, she said.
   Researchers at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
Md., said Thursday they are seeking approval from the federal Food
and Drug Administration for a similar study that could start within
a month. The NIH study, which would concentrate on workers facing
``massive exposures'' to the virus, would not use placebos, said
Debbie Katz, who is coordinating the project.
   Gerberding said she knew two workers at her hospital who took
AZT after being exposed to the AIDS virus through tainted blood.
   William Owen, a doctor in private practice who treats AIDS
patients, said he prescribed the drug to a surgeon who cut his hand
with a scalpel while operating on a patient with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   Since patients may acquire AZT through their personal
physicians, the number of people taking the drug as a preventive
measure is not known.
   ``Like everything else with AIDS, it's quasi-underground,'' said
Dr. June Fisher, who runs the city's Center of Municipal
Occupational Safety and Health, a health clinic.
   Volberding said he has enough faith in the drug's efficacy that
he could not in good conscience advise AIDS-exposed workers to
enroll in the Burroughs Wellcome study because he'd be afraid they
would get the placebo.
   However, Dr. Martin Hirsch of Massachusetts General Hospital
said if he was accidentally exposed to the virus he probably would
enroll in the Burroughs Wellcome study rather than take the drug on
his own.

   Nearly half of the patients who had heart-bypass
operations in three hospitals either should not have had the
procedures or could have done without them, a new study says.
   Eliminating unnecessary coronary bypass operations could lead to
reduced health care costs and improved patient care, said the
study, published in Friday's edition of the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   Only 56 percent of the 386 coronary bypass operations performed
in the three randomly chosen hospitals from a Western state in
1979, 1980 and 1982 were justified, meaning the benefits outweighed
the risks, the study said.
   Ann Shoben, a spokeswoman for Rand Corp., whose researchers did
the study, declined to identify the hospitals.
   It found that 14 percent of the operations were performed for
inappropriate reasons, and 30 percent for equivocal reasons,
meaning they could be argued either way.
   Bypass operations, first performed 20 years ago, numbered about
230,000 last year in the United States at an estimated cost of $6
billion, according to national figures. This is more than double
the number performed in 1980.
   The study ``certainly points up some problem areas as we sit
here watching the cost of health care rise so quickly,'' said Dr.
Constance Monroe Winslow, who conducted the study with four
colleagues at the University of California-Los Angeles Center for
the Health Sciences.
   While doctors may disagree on whether bypass surgery should be
performed in the equivocal cases, the authors concluded that ``few
would argue with the proposition that the services should go first
of all to patients with clearly appropriate reasons for their use.''
   ``When confronted with scarce resources, planners may wish to
use this type of information to help make difficult allocation
decisions.''
   A typical bypass operation can cost about $30,000.
   In the surgical procedure, doctors take a vein from somewhere
else in the body and use it to reroute blood around a blockage in
the coronary arteries.
   The authors cautioned that although the study is representative
of patients undergoing bypass surgery in western states, ``further
work is needed to generalize these results to the rest of the
United States.''
   Dr. Jack Copeland, a University of Arizona heart surgeon who
heads the school's nationally known heart-transplant program, said,
``I'm not aware of too many instances where there has been an abuse
of this kind of surgery.
   ``I don't doubt there are some abuses, but I would doubt that
it's as significant as one might think looking at such an
article,'' he added.
   In an editorial that accompanied the study in the same issue,
Dr. Albert G. Mulley Jr. and Dr. Kim A. Eagle of Massachusetts
General Hospital and the Harvard Medical School said doctors often
disagreed on the criteria for determining whether a bypass
operation is justified.
   The UCLA researchers used a system designed for the Rand
Corp.-UCLA Health Services Utilization Study to rate the
appropriateness of bypass surgery. The system was devised by a
nine-member panel of physicians.
   The study defined appropriateness to mean that the expected
health benefit of a bypass, including both quality of life and-or
longevity, exceeded the expected negative consequences, including
the risk of death, by a sufficiently wide margin.
   Mulley and Eagle said that if appropriateness ratings made by a
panel in Great Britain were applied, even more bypass operations
would have been considered unjustified.
   ``Policymakers should resist the temptation to use
appropriateness ratings as a quick fix,'' they said. ``The real
need is for more information about the outcomes of medical
practices.''

   Chemical Deficiencies Found in Brains

   BOSTON -- Researchers here reported the discovery of
chemical deficiencies in the brains of people who died of
Alzheimer's disease, suggesting new treatments for the
disorder.
   The finding also promises to join major lines of research
on Alzheimer's disease, giving a more complete picture of how
it develops and potentially opening the door for early
diagnosis and treatment. Currently there's no effective
treatment for the disease, a fatal disorder that afflicts an
estimated four million Americans with memory loss and other
mental deterioration.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The chemical defects found by the researchers are related
to a substance called choline, which brain cells use to form
their surrounding membranes. In an analysis of brain samples
from people who had died of Alzheimer's disease, the Boston
researchers found that choline levels were 40% to 50% lower
than in normal brain tissues. Levels of a related membrane
building block, called ethanolamine, were similarly reduced.
   The researchers also found abnormally low levels of
membrane molecules based on choline and abnormally high
levels of a chemical formed by the breakdown of those
molecules.
   Together, the findings suggest that brain-cell membranes
decay in people with Alzheimer's disease due to defects in
the processing of choline and related molecules, said Richard
J. Wurtman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology
researcher and co-author of the study. The decay appears to
be unique to Alzheimer's disease -- the scientists didn't
find signs of it in the brains of people who had died from
other degenerative diseases of the brain, including
Parkinson's disease. The study is reported in the current
issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
   The discovery particularly excites Alzheimer's disease
researchers because it appears to link two hallmarks of the
disease -- the selective, heavy damage it wreaks on brain
areas involved in memory and the formation of clumps of a
protein called beta amyloid in the brains of people with the
disease.
   Since the mid-1970s, researchers have known that
Alzheimer's disease is correlated with a deficiency of
acetylcholine, a substance made from choline that transmits
signals between neurons. Moreover, they've known that
acetylcholine is especially important in brain areas involved
in memory. Thus, said Dr. Wurtman, the memory-area neurons
have a double need for choline -- to make both membranes and
acetylcholine -- and hence are likely to be hit especially
hard by the choline deficiency his team has found. That may
explain why memory goes first in Alzheimer's patients.
   The study's tentative amyloid link stems from previous
research showing that beta amyloid is formed when a
"precursor" molecule embedded in brain-cell membranes breaks
down. The latest finding suggests that this breakdown
process, which has long baffled scientists, occurs when the
deterioration of brain cells' membranes exposes the amyloid
precursor to scissor-like enzymes that cut it apart and form
beta amyloid, said Dr. Wurtman.
   One implication of the study is that doctors may be able
to diagnose Alzheimer's disease early by measuring levels of
choline-associated chemicals in spinal fluid. Dr. Wurtman
said the Boston team, which includes researchers at
Massachusetts General Hospital, plans soon to conduct a study
on that possibility.
   The study also suggests that drugs to correct choline and
related abnormalities might prevent or arrest Alzheimer's
disease. One candidate is lecithin, a choline booster found
in eggs, milk, soybeans and other foods. However, said Dr.
Wurtman, lecithin alone probably can't correct the multiple
chemical defects revealed by the study.
   But other drugs might, he added, including "potassium
channel blockers" -- experimental drugs that may
simultaneously boost levels of choline within cells and
increase the release of acetylcholine to improve memory-cell
function. Another candidate is CDP-choline, a drug sold in
Europe to treat people with head trauma. At least two small
companies are planning to develop such choline-boosting
drugs: Interneuron Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Lexington, Mass.,
company that is working with Dr. Wurtman, and BrainChemTech
Corp., a Columbus, Ohio, startup company working with Lloyd
Horrocks, an Ohio State University researcher.
   In a separate Alzheimer's disease development, researchers
who previously reported last year that they had produced a
condition like the disease in mice retracted the claim in a
letter to the journal Nature. The group, including scientists
at New York's Mount Sinai School of Medicine and the National
Institute on Aging, said they were unable to replicate their
earlier results.

   When the mammogram taken last month showed a suspicious
spot in her breast, Nancy Grove feared that once again she
faced days of pain and anxiety. Once before, in 1973, a
suspicious mammogram had led to a surgical breast biopsy. The
biopsy involved a day in the hospital, general anesthesia and
a painful, inch-long incision that took two weeks to heal.
   This time, however, the 45-year-old Conifer, Colo., woman
walked into a radiology clinic in Denver at 11 a.m. one
Wednesday and walked out two hours later. She had suffered
nothing more than a needle puncture, rendered almost painless
by a local anesthetic, and by Friday she knew the lesion was
benign. "I'm a technical person and I'm not put off by
machines," says Ms. Grove, a microbiologist. "But I was just
blown away by this technique."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In the last several months, the new approach, called
stereotactic automated large-core biopsy, has been
encountered by a small but growing number of women.
Proponents say it is faster, cheaper, less painful and less
disfiguring than the conventional surgical biopsy that
500,000 American women undergo each year.
   "The patients uniformly say there is a minimum of pain and
that they would be willing to undergo it again, which they
don't say with surgical biopsy," says Jack Meyer, professor
of radiology at Harvard Medical School. In the last five
months, Dr. Meyer has used the technique to perform biopsies
on more than 60 women at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston as part of a study. "The surgeons who have referred
patients to me are pleased with the results," he says.
   Dr. Meyer also praises the speed of the new method. Many
women, he says, find it almost intolerable to wait for days
and even weeks for a surgical biopsy.
   But some researchers worry that many radiologists, who see
a chance to profitably invade a turf occupied by surgeons,
may be rushing to offer the new biopsy method far too soon,
before its limitations and hazards are fully known.
   Stereotactic breast biopsy uses stereoscopic X-ray
mammograms to pinpoint in three dimensions the location of a
suspicious lump that has shown up in a mammogram. A computer
helps aim a springloaded "gun" that shoots a hollow-core
needle into the lesion in a fraction of a second. The needle
pulls out a "core" of tissue large enough for a pathologist
to determine the nature of the lump.
   With the new technique, the biopsy procedure itself takes
only about 20 minutes, and improvements in the works may cut
that to less than 10 minutes. If a radiologist and a surgeon
are available to evaluate a routine mammogram immediately,
the stereotactic biopsy can be done on the same day and even
in the same radiology clinic. In contrast, the conventional
surgical biopsy requires scheduling days ahead of time and
five to six hours in a hospital under general anesthesia.
   To top it off, the stereotactic needle biopsy typically
costs $750 to $1,000, a half to a third of the cost of a
surgical biopsy.
   The idea of needle biopsy -- the sampling of tissue with a
thin, hollow needle -- is hardly new; it is widely and almost
routinely used to help diagnose tumors in many parts of the
body. But until now, it has been of limited value in breast
cancer. At most, surgeons have sometimes inserted an
ultrathin needle into a suspicious breast lump to see if it
is filled with fluid, a feature of a benign cyst.
   Most breast surgeons, though, have shunned needle breast
biopsies of suspicious lumps as unreliable. If a breast lump
is large enough to be palpable, or felt, there is always the
worry that the needle may miss the malignant cells in the
lump, resulting in a dangerous "false negative." For such
large lumps, surgical excision biopsy is likely to continue
to be the main method of diagnosis.
   It's another matter, however, for the nonpalpable lesions
that are usually first detected by mammography during routine
health checkups. In 80% to 90% of the cases, these tiny lumps
are benign. But a great many women have had to undergo
expensive, painful and sometimes disfiguring surgical
biopsies just to make sure.
   This situation began to change in the 1980s, when makers
of X-ray machinery devised mammography equipment that could
take mammograms from two angles 30 degrees apart. The
resulting stereotactic views could locate a breast lump in
three dimensions and thus allowed radiologists and surgeons
for the first time to accurately guide a needle into a lump.
   Using this "stereo" feature, researchers began
experimenting with needle biopsies of nonpalpable breast
lumps. The results were promising, but there were enough
drawbacks to discourage wide use. Even when the skinny needle
got enough cells to examine, there was always a worry that
the needle might have plunged into normal cells in the lump
and missed the malignant cells. Moreover, a specially trained
cytologist -- who had to be hired by the hospital -- could
tell doctors whether the cells were malignant but couldn't
determine what type of growth they came from -- a guide to
treatment.
   The turning point, say researchers, came last August with
a report by a team of radiologists headed by Steve H. Parker
and William E. Jobe of Radiology Imaging Associates, the
private radiology clinic in Englewood, Colo., where Ms. Grove
underwent her needle biopsy last month.
   Dr. Parker says that in 1987 he was doing a lot of needle
biopsies of cancers of the prostate, liver and other organs
using a spring-loaded "gun" developed in Sweden and sold by a
unit of C.R. Bard &amp; Co. The gun could shoot a needle straight
into a tumor in seven-thousandths of a second, before the
tumor could be pushed out of the way by the advancing needle
tip.
   Dr. Parker found that the accuracy of cancer detection was
greatly improved if he used a "core" needle that was much
wider than the aspiration needle. "After I published an
article {on the core biopsy}, William Jobe called me up and
asked me if I thought it could be used in the breast," Dr.
Parker recalls. A short while later, the two radiologists
began a trial with women who agreed to have a core needle
biopsy just before they underwent a scheduled surgical
biopsy.
   In the first series of patients, Drs. Parker and Jobe
found a problem with the mammography machine from General
Electric Co. they were using. The GE system, like most other
mammography systems, requires the patient to sit still and
upright for a half-hour or so. If the woman has an
involuntary muscle jerk at the wrong time, the needle can
miss the lump. Moreover, the patient can see the needle being
inserted, and there was worry the sight might make some women
faint.
   After their first 30 patients, Drs. Parker and Jobe
switched to a "stereo" mammography machine that was designed
in Sweden but made by a small Denver company, Fischer Imaging
Corp. With this machine, the woman lies face down on a table
with her breast protruding through a hole, and the needle gun
is out of sight.
   After biopsies on 103 patients, the radiologists reached
the point where their needle biopsies were getting the same
results as surgical biopsies. In a second series of 102
patients, their results agreed with the surgical biopsy
results 96% of the time, the researchers reported in August
in the journal Radiology. The needle biopsy missed two breast
lesions that the surgeons found later -- but the surgeons
missed two lesions that needle biopsies found.
   Radiologists have bought more than 100 of the $120,000
Fischer Mammotest systems since early 1990, says Fischer's
chief executive, Morgan Nields. Spurred by the reports of
Drs. Parker and Jobe, "the rate of orders has increased every
quarter," he says. He estimates other manufacturers have sold
200 stereotactic "add-ons" that permit their mammography
systems to be used for needle biopsies.
   That may be a problem, though, because academic
researchers still haven't had time to identify the best way
to use the technique or the type of patient who is most
likely to benefit. "There aren't enough reports published"
evaluating the new method, says radiologist Daniel Kopans of
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. "We need to know
that Steve Parker isn't the only one who can do this."

<HL> Scientists Report Locating Defective Gene Seen as Major Culprit in Kidney Cancer </HL>

<DATELINE> BOSTON  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have found the approximate location of a defective gene that is responsible for a rare inherited, cancer-causing disease and that may be a major culprit in kidney cancer.

   The defective gene located by the scientists causes Von Hippel Lindau, or VHL, disease, a relatively rare disorder whose sufferers develop cancers of different organs, including the brain and kidney.
Based on the discovery, researchers hope to develop a diagnostic test for the disease within a year, enabling early treatment that could save lives, says Bernd Seizinger, a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital who led an international team that made the discovery.

   The finding also promises to advance understanding of "tumor suppressor genes" -- genetic protectors against cancer that are rapidly gaining prominence in tumor research.

   The VHL gene isn't the first to be linked with tumors, but its tentative association with a major form of cancer gives it particular significance.
Kidney cancer kills about 9,500 Americans annually.
If scientists can pinpoint a faulty gene responsible for kidney tumors, they may eventually be able to unravel the underlying chemical malfunctions involved in the disease and to correct them with drugs.

   The discovery, reported in today's issue of the journal Nature, involved the discovery of a "genetic marker" that shows the approximate location of the defective gene causing VHL disease.
The researchers found the marker -- a piece of DNA that acts as a sign-post in the maze of genes -- by examining genetic material from 203 people in nine families with the disease.

   The scientists now are searching for additional nearby markers that are needed to develop a diagnostic test for VHL disease.
The test will enable doctors to closely monitor people known to carry the faulty gene and to surgically remove or otherwise treat their tumors before the cancers become life-threatening.

   Only about 500 cases of VHL disease "exist in the medical literature," says Dr. Seizinger.
But many cases are probably mistaken for non-inherited forms of cancer, so the disease is probably much more common than reports of it indicate, he adds.

   Scientists believe the faulty VHL gene may be connected with kidney cancer because of the earlier discovery of genetic "deletions," or missing genetic material, in people with non-inherited kidney tumors.
Scientists haven't precisely located such deletions, but they know the defects involved occur in the same genetic region in which the VHL marker was found.

   Moreover, since many VHL disease sufferers develop kidney tumors, "it's a good working hypothesis" that the genetic defects associated with the inherited and non-inherited forms of kidney cancer affect the same gene, says Dr. Seizinger.

   Adds Bert Vogelstein, who investigates genes and cancer at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine: "I think this is extremely significant.
It should provide a big clue to determining genes involved in renal cancer."
He cautions, however, that several genes may be involved in development of kidney tumors, potentially complicating research on them.

   Scientists believe the defect causing VHL disease affects a tumor suppressor gene.
According to an increasingly popular theory in cancer research, such genes regulate other genes -- perhaps ones involved in early development of organs.
The developmental genes must be deactivated when their missions are complete, otherwise, some scientists believe, they run amok, causing tumors.
The suppressor genes may serve as guardians against cancer via such deactivation.

   In any case, "the loss of such guardians seems to be one of the most fundamental mechanisms of cancer development in humans," says James Gusella, a researcher involved in the VHL disease study.

   Several other cancers, including lung cancer, appear to be associated with defects in the same genetic region in which the VHL gene resides.
An added benefit of the VHL gene research is that it promises to help locate those genes, Dr. Seizinger says.

   Biogen Inc., Cambridge, Mass., said clinical tests have begun with its version of the experimental AIDS drug CD4, a genetically engineered substance that is the subject of a heated research race.

   CD4 is found on the surface of certain immune cells that are attacked by the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus.
Scientists hope that particles of genetically engineered CD4, when injected into patients, will act as decoys for the virus, preventing it from infecting and killing immune cells.

   The biotechnology concern said it is collaborating with the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a branch of the National Institutes of Health, in its clinical trials.
The trials are being conducted at Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital and at aone other location.

<HEAD>Cow's Blood May Become Substitute for Transfusions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sometime in the next decade, nurses preparing
patients for routine surgery may draw out a few pints of blood and
replace it with something the laws of nature would seem to forbid:
cow's blood.
   Cow's blood _ actually just the oxygen-carrying part of it _ is
one of several substances under development by biotechnology firms
seeking a safe, clean and maybe even superior substitute for what
flows through human veins.
   Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital hope to begin
experiments this fall on healthy human volunteers to see if bovine
blood transfusions are safe. Extensive human testing will be
necessary to overcome skepticism about mixing blood between the
species.
   ``Everybody says you can't give cow's blood to a human, just
like you can't give some people's blood to other people,'' said
Carl Rausch, head of Biopure, a Boston-based company working on
this approach. ``But we are talking about just the oxygen transport
medium, which is hemoglobin.''
   Ordinarily, blood, organs and hormones cannot be swapped between
cats and mice or people and elephants because they are rejected as
foreign substances. But there are exceptions. For instance,
diabetics take cow insulin, and pig valves are used as replacements
in human hearts.
   Biopure has more than people in mind for its product. Tufts
University's veterinary school plans to test the same cow blood
intended for humans to treat sick dogs. Besides opening up a big
market among veterinarians _ it envisions a $60 million a year
business in transfusions for dogs and cats alone _ Biopure hopes
that by showing Bossie's blood works fine for Tabby and Rover,
people will begin to accept the idea that it's good for Aunt
Gertrude, as well.
   ``People are nervous about this because it's bovine-derived,''
said Rausch. ``If you can get a substitute to work in a wide range
of species, then the nay-sayers will have to say, `It might work.'
''
   It should work, he and others believe, because many creatures,
people included, produce similar hemoglobin. In three years of
tests, animals showed no adverse reaction to cow hemoglobin, even
when it replaced 95 percent of their own blood.
   Blood fulfills many vital jobs, transporting nourishment,
hormones and disease-fighting armaments. The substitutes envisioned
by Biopure and others would take the place of just one of these
components _ the red cells.
   Red cells are packed with hemoglobin, a molecule that picks up
oxygen in the lungs and delivers it throughout the body. Putting
back hemoglobin, usually in the form of red cell transfusions, is
often essential for offsetting the blood loss of accident victims
and surgical patients.
   ``There have been attempts to make red cell substitutes for a
quarter of a century,'' said Dr. Harvey G. Klein, chief of
transfusion medicine at the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Md.
   Northfield Labs in Northfield, Ill., and Baxter Travenol in
Fairfield, N.J., among others, are developing red cell substitutes
from expired human blood. Green Cross in Japan has made a
fluorocarbon-based synthetic molecule that can carry oxygen, while
Somatagen in Broomfield, Colo., is attempting to make human
hemoglobin through gene splicing.
   ``The great enthusiasm recently is because of the perceived
increased risk of infection being transmitted by transfusions,
primarily AIDS,'' Klein said. ``Red cell substitutes could be
purified to such an extent that viral contamination wouldn't be an
issue. Red cells can't be right now.''
   Despite screening, a tiny risk remains of getting AIDS from a
transfusion. Other viruses can also be passed along _ including
hepatitis and herpes _ as well as a variety of foreign proteins.
   ``Every time you take blood, it's like putting a quarter in the
slot machine,'' said Dr. Charles Huggins, head of Massachusetts
General's blood bank. ``If you are unlucky and come up with three
lemons, you can get hepatitis or something else.''
   Rausch said bovine hemoglobin is purified to be 99.999999999
percent free of viruses. Even if a microbe slips through, it will
be a cow germ, unlikely to cause a human disease.
   Among other advantages, the substitutes could be given to anyone
without matching the blood type. And unlike real blood, which must
be thrown away after about three weeks, the fake varieties would
last six months and perhaps longer.
   Huggins, who will be participating in the human testing of cow
blood, said, ``I am making every effort to put myself out of
business.''
   However, Dr. Leon Hoyer, vice president of research and
development at the American Red Cross, doubts this will happen.
Blood is becoming safer as tests are developed for more viruses, he
said, and doubts will linger about the safety of routinely using
bovine blood and other substitutes.
   ``It's going to take a significant number of clinical trials to
show that they have no toxicity at all. It's one thing to use them
when you have no alternative. It's another to use them electively.
I'm not sure that they will have an advantage over standard blood
that is subject to better testing and viral inactivation procedures
that will get rid of those issues.''
   Even if the substitutes don't replace real red cells, experts
say there are several situations where they might be routinely used:
   _Before such operations as hip replacements, which involve the
loss of large quantities of blood, patients might put several pints
of their own blood in storage and replace it with a hemoglobin
substitute. After the operation, their own blood would be put back.
   _Ambulances might carry blood substitutes so transfusions could
begin immediately for accident victims rather than after they
arrive at the hospital where their blood type can be matched.
   _The military would like to develop a freeze-dried blood
substitute that could be mixed with sterile water on the
battlefield so combat victims could be stabilized until they are
evacuated to hospitals.
   _They could be used to treat victims of heart attacks and
strokes. Because the substitutes are thinner than blood, they might
ooze around clots and carry oxygen to starving tissue, preventing
permanent damage until clots dissolve.
   _They could be used to keep organs alive until they are
transplanted.
   _By boosting oxygen levels, they might improve the killing power
of radiation therapy in treating cancer.
   _Since hemoglobin is a rich source of iron, it might increase
the body's natural production of new red cells, especially when
combined with a growth-stimulating hormone.
   One clear advantage of cow blood is the supply of raw material.
Rausch estimates 70 million cows are slaughtered in the United
States each year, and each contains five to seven gallons of blood.
Most of it goes to waste.
   While plasma is salvaged for fish food, the red cells are a
goopy mass that must be dried and taken to a landfill. Rausch said
he can buy it for 50 cents a gallon. By 1994 _ when, if all goes
well, his product is approved for routine human use _ Rausch
expects to be able to sell the highly purified substitute for $150
to $200 a pint, the price he believes real blood will cost then.

   A simple blood test for cancer failed to live up to its
early promise, cancer researchers said.
   When it was first described in 1986, the blood test raised
hopes that a method had been found for screening seemingly
healthy people for signs of hidden cancers. It also was hoped
that the test might be used to monitor patients who had been
treated for cancer to see if the malignancy had returned.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The test involved taking a small blood sample and
subjecting it to a procedure called nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy. In this procedure an intense magnetic
field causes the protons in the hydrogen atoms of water to
give off a detectable signal. Initial tests indicated the
technique could distinguish between blood samples from cancer
patients and blood samples from healthy persons.
   This week's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine,
however, carries two reports declaring the test produced
erroneous results in too many cases to be useful. One report,
from a team of scientists at Massachusetts General Hospital
and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that in 52%
of cases the test wrongly indicated healthy persons had
cancer and that it failed to identify 56% of patients with
cancer. The second report from Norwegian researchers
described similar results.
   The blood test isn't to be confused with magnetic
resonance imaging, which gives an image of internal anatomy
more detailed than X-rays. It is used to detect malignant
tumors.

<TEXT>
   The stepchildren who kept the fate of Andrei
D. Sakharov known to the world during his years of internal exile in
the Soviet Union are scrambling to prepare for his first visit to
the West.
   Sakharov is expected to arrive in Boston on Sunday for a two-week
trip to receive medical treatment, meet a granddaughter born here
and promote the International Foundation for the Survival and
Development of Humanity.
   The 67-year-old Nobel laureate is a member of the board of
directors of the foundation, formed in January by Soviet and
American scientists and educators to foster arms control,
environmental protection, international development and human rights.
   Sakharov is expected to travel without his wife, Yelena Bonner.
But he will start the trip by visiting two of her children who live
in Boston suburbs.
   ``We have started to prepare food for him, but we don't know
exactly what he'll want,'' Mrs. Bonner's son-in-law, Efrem
Yankelevich, said Thursday. ``There's a lot to be done, especially
preparing his schedule.''
   Yankelevich said Sakharov will go to Massachusetts General
Hospital for a cardiological examination and possible implantation
of a heart pacemaker, a procedure that usually requires a two-day
hospital stay.
   From Boston, he plans to travel to New York and Washington, but
the dates of his visits to those cities remain uncertain, relatives
said.
   Yankelevich said Sakharov hopes to be in Washington on Nov. 15,
when the Soviet physicist is expected to receive the $50,000 Albert
Einstein Foundation Peace Prize for 1988.
   But the personal highlight of the trip, Yankelevich said,
probably will be Sakharov's first meeting with Alexandra Semyonova,
the 4-year-old daughter of stepson Alexei Semyonov and his wife,
Elizaveta Alekseyeva.
   Sakharov went on hunger strikes to win permission from Soviet
authorities for his wife to come to the United States for medical
care and for Miss Alekseyeva to come here to marry Semyonov.
   For his defense of human rights in the Soviet Union, Sakharov
received the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize. Five years later, in January
1980, he was banished to Gorky, a city closed to Westerners.
   His wife also was banished there in August 1984. Both were
released in December 1986 by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Sakharov is expected to be accompanied during part of his visit
by Yevgenii Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, and Roald Sagdeev, director of the Soviet Space Research
Institute.
   Velikhov is chairman of the International Foundation for the
Survival and Development of Humanity, which is headquartered in
Moscow and has offices in Washington and Stockholm, Sweden. Sagdeev
is a foundation director.
   The foundation is about to embark on a worldwide fund-raising
drive with a goal of about $10 million for the first year, said its
American vice chairman, Jerome Wiesner, president emeritus of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Wiesner said the foundation's purpose is to support research on
``what I call the modern diseases of the world _ generated by
technology, population growth, nuclear weapons and so on _ that
require cooperation by a number of countries in order to do
something about them.''
   The foundation's first board of directors meeting outside of the
Soviet Union is scheduled for Nov. 13-17 in Washington. Sakharov is
expected to attend at least part of the five-day session.
   Other American board members include Armand Hammer, chairman of
Occidental Petroleum; the Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, president emeritus
of the University of Notre Dame; Robert S. McNamara, a former U.S.
secretary of defense; and John Sculley, chief executive officer of
Apple Computer Inc.
   Gina Cella Harty, a spokeswoman for the foundation, said it is
the first non-profit, non-governmental international organization to
operate with full legal status in the Soviet Union.

   Only a narrow range of white blood cells may be
involved in triggering multiple sclerosis, scientists said today in
a finding hailed as a major step in understanding the crippling
nerve disease.
   Researchers found surprisingly few types of those cells when
they analyzed diseased brain tissue from multiple sclerosis
patients, said study co-author Dr. Lawrence Steinman of Stanford
University.
   The disease results when the body's disease-fighting immune
system mistakenly attacks nerve tissue in the brain and central
nervous system. Research suggests that white blood cells called
T-cells play a critical role in the onslaught.
   The new findings imply that the disease may be treatable with
strategies that block just the types of T-cells cells involved in
that attack, Steinman said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
   The work is a major step toward better understanding of the
disease, said Stephen Reingold, vice president for research and
medical programs of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.
   It would be ``very attractive indeed'' to be able to block just
disease-causing blood cells, rather than risking side effects from
experimental drugs that more broadly affect the immune system, he
said.
   But Reingold stressed that the new study included only three
patients, so that its importance for multiple sclerosis in general
is not clear, and he said it left other key questions unanswered.
   He also said any implication for therapy would be far in the
future.
   The study is reported in today's issue of the British journal
Nature by researchers at Stanford, LaTrobe University in Australia
and Cetus Corp. in Emeryville, Calif.
   An estimated 250,000 Americans have MS, an often disabling
condition that can produce weakness, difficulty in coordination,
dizziness and loss of balance.
   The study's authors focused on structures called receptors that
are found on the surface of T-cells. The cells use receptors to
bind to their targets, and the targets they can attack are
determined by the types of receptor they carry.
   Using one criterion for describing receptors, researchers
analyzed types of T-cell receptors in diseased brain tissue from
three MS patients. They found two to four receptor types in each
brain.
   In contrast, there may be 20 to 30 such receptor types used by
T-cells in the body, with the exact number not known, commented Dr.
Henry McFarland of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders
and Stroke.
   In the new study, one receptor type showed up in all three
patients. T-cells bearing that type are not very common in blood,
at least in people without multiple sclerosis, Steinman said.
   The restricted number of receptor types found in the brain
suggests the T-cells are ``targeting something very, very specific
in the brain,'' Steinman said in a telephone interview. The target
is not known, he said.
   Researchers might be able to develop a therapy that blocks
T-cells carrying the receptors implicated in the disease, he said.
   Such a strategy successfully treated mice with a disease
resembling multiple sclerosis, the Nature paper noted. Researchers
used proteins called monoclonal antibodies that bound to particular
types of T-cells.
   The new study left some questions unanswered, experts said.
Reingold said it is not clear whether similar T-cell findings would
appear in brains of people with similar diseases, which would mean
the findings are not specific to multiple sclerosis. Steinman said
researchers are checking on that.
   Dr. Stephen Hauser of Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston cautioned that treatment the patients
received before the study may have destroyed other types of T-cells
that also participate in the disease. Steinman said if that is so,
the fact the observed T-cells survived may mean ``they're the ones
we really have to focus on'' for therapy.

<HEAD>Atlanta Hospital First in Nation to Use New Gallstone Smasher</HEAD>

   A machine that smashes gallstones using shock
waves was used for the first time in the United States, and the
patient involved in the landmark treatment said it was a lot more
pleasant than surgery.
   Lyn Hicks, 35, of Carrollton, joined her doctors at a press
briefing Thursday at Emory University's Crawford Long Hospital in
Atlanta, the first in the nation to use a new gallstone lithotripsy
technique, according to hospital officials.
   The treatment, Ms. Hicks said, was ``virtually painless.''
   ``I was released on a Thursday, and I could have gone back to
work Friday,'' she said. She wound up going back to work the next
Monday, after a follow-up visit the day after her release.
   Ms. Hicks said she could feel pressure akin to a slap each time
the machine fired shock waves at her midsection and was left with
some ``mild tenderness'' afterward _ a far cry from surgery
recuperation.
   ``I work at a hospital,'' said Ms. Hicks, assistant director of
registration for emergency patients at Carrollton's Tanner Medical
Center. ``I know what serious surgery it is.''
   Crawford Long is one of 10 U.S. medical centers selected for
trials of a gallstone lithotripter that has shown promising results
in tests in West Germany, officials said Thursday at the news
conference.
   The machine, similar to those now commonly used to smash kidney
stones, represents a ``major step forward in medicine,'' said Dr.
Harold S. Ramos, medical director at Crawford Long.
   Gallstones are small, hard masses that can form in the gall
bladder. The lithotripter uses ultrasound to locate the gallstones
and send shock waves into the gall bladder, literally smashing them
to sand-size fragments, which can then be passed into the intestine
and out of the body.
   Previously, gallstones have been removed only through complex
surgery, which can require a week of hospitalization and six to
eight weeks of recuperation.
   ``For the first time, we will be able to manage gallstones
effectively without surgery, without putting the patient to sleep,
without interruption in their daily lives,'' Ramos said.
   The 10 medical centers will use a Dornier MPL-9000 biliary
lithotripter in investigative trials on some 600 selected patients
who meet certain criteria.
   If approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the technique
could become the method of choice for treatment of gallstones,
which plague as many as 20 million Americans each year, according
to Dr. R. Carter Davis, chief of the hospital's Gastrointestinal
Diagnostic Laboratory.
   Although patients during the trials will be hospitalized for two
nights, ``in the near future, it will be reduced to an outpatient
procedure,'' predicted Dr. William E. Torres, associate professor
of radiology at Emory University and one of the physicians involved
in the study.
   In trials on some 600 German patients, about 80 percent have
been completely free of gallstones or fragments 10 months after
treatment, and only 10-15 percent have reported mild, ``minimal''
side effects, said Dr. Gustav Paumgartner, chairman of the
Department of Gastroenterology at the University of Munich.
   In addition to Crawford Long, trials are being conducted at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles; the University of Iowa,
Iowa City; Northwestern University Medical Center, Chicago;
Methodist Hospital, Indianapolis; Massachusetts General Hospital,
Boston; the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania,
Philadelphia; Humana Hospital of San Antonio, Texas; Johns Hopkins
Hospital, Baltimore; and the University of Virginia School of
Medicine, Charlottesville.
