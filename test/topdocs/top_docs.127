Everyone in the aeronautics community knew they had the right stuff, and now 
the city of Lancaster has made it official. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Yeager, Jimmy Doolittle, A. Scott Crossfield, Tony LeVier and Pete Knight 
-- pilots who achieved dizzying heights in the early days of flight testing -- 
on Saturday became the first to be honored on Lancaster's Aerospace Walk of 
Honor. 
</P>
<P>
"They're sure a different breed of cat from the rest of us," said George Root, 
vice mayor of Lancaster. "They're internationally known for taking phenomenal 
risks in one-of-a-kind aircraft to learn the planes' limits, and some of them 
did it right here in the Antelope Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Modeled after the Hollywood Walk of Fame and celebrity walks elsewhere, the 
sidewalk monument display has been shrouded in secrecy for months. Saturday 
morning, the five granite monuments were installed on Lancaster Boulevard, 
boxed in black crates and guarded by volunteers from the Civil Air Patrol. Each 
six-foot-tall, 675-pound monument bears a decorative, brushed aluminum 
medallion and the name of the recipient. The pilots' names were announced at a 
$50-a-plate dinner Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"We kept it secret because we wanted to build excitement in the community, very 
much like the Academy Awards," said Nancy Walker, a spokeswoman for the city. 
</P>
<P>
But Yeager, the legendary combat and test pilot immortalized in Tom Wolfe's 
book "The Right Stuff," about the chutzpah of those pilots and astronauts, said 
in an interview last week that test pilots and movie stars are worlds apart. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a hell of a comparison -- Hollywood movie stars and us," Yeager, 67, 
said. "The test pilot lives a real life, not a fantasy. Basically, you have to 
remember, duty enters into it. That's paramount." 
</P>
<P>
Yeager in 1947 was the first pilot in the world to break the sound barrier, 
even though he had two broken ribs at the time. Knight, 61, set the world's 
speed record in 1967 by flying the X-15 at Mach 6, or 4,520 m.p.h., twice as 
fast as a .50-caliber bullet. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the pilots, LeVier, 77, and Crossfield, 68, were civilians who helped 
design and test high-powered aircraft. Doolittle, 93, is a retired Air Force 
lieutenant general who made the first successful "blind," or instruments-only, 
flight in 1929. He is also renowned for voluntarily leading a raid by 16 B-25 
bombers against Tokyo on April 18, 1942. 
</P>
<P>
So far, Lancaster has spent about $60,000, not including labor costs of city 
employees, for the Walk of Honor and the hoopla surrounding it this weekend, 
Walker said. Champagne glasses embossed in gold with the image of a test pilot 
and gourmet chocolates stamped with the same picture were to be given out 
Saturday night at the black-tie dinner to the 200 or so guests, including state 
Controller Gray Davis. Each pilot was also to be presented with a silver medal 
hung from a ribbon in the style of the Olympics, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
Today at 2 p.m., the monuments will be unveiled in a public ceremony at 
Lancaster Boulevard and Cedar Avenue, preceded by a private reception. 
</P>
<P>
Every year, more monuments will be added to the Walk of Honor, which local city 
and military officials hope will become an attraction for aerospace buffs who 
already come to the area to watch space shuttles and the B -- 2 Stealth bomber 
flights. They also plan to build a museum at Edwards Air Force Base and add 
other attractions to the area to create an "Aerospace Heritage Trail," similar 
to Boston's Liberty Trail. 
</P>
<P>
"The walk is something our children will be able to look at and understand that 
this is where the sound barrier was broken. This is what we accomplished," said 
Tom Smith, a spokesman for the Antelope Valley-based Society of Experimental 
Test Pilots. 
</P>
<P>
All of the pilots honored this weekend have flown at least once out of Edwards 
Air Force Base, located 30 miles northeast of Lancaster. The base, an important 
flight test center for decades, began attracting aerospace companies to the 
valley after World War II. Today, about 23% of the area's work force, or 16,250 
workers, are employed in the aerospace industry, according to the state 
Economic Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been looking for a way for many years to publicly tie Lancaster and 
Edwards Air Force Base together, because it's that bond that moved us away from 
agriculture to technology," Root said. 
</P>
<P>
Yeager said that, when he was stationed at Edwards in the late 1940s, he rarely 
visited Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just alfalfa fields. That's all it was. Now, Highway 14 between 6 and 9 
a.m. -- you just don't hack it," he said, denying that he hot-rodded on the 
wide-open roads of his era. In "The Right Stuff," Wolfe described the fliers 
engaging in "the military tradition of Flying &amp; Drinking and Driving &amp; 
Drinking." 
</P>
<P>
Yeager and the other pilots have been enshrined in the National Aviation Hall 
of Fame in Dayton, Ohio, the Wright Brothers' hometown, said spokeswoman Kim 
Bramlage. But the Hall of Fame has been operating out of a tiny office in 
Dayton's convention center since the center was remodeled a few years ago. All 
the pilots' portraits, plaques and gold medals are in storage until the 
nonprofit organization can raise $12 million for a new home for the Hall of 
Fame, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of heritage lost over the years," said Doug Nelson, 
spokesman for the Air Force Flight Test Center Museum, which will open in 
temporary quarters at Edwards next year. "These guys sat in cramped cockpits, 
all hot and sweaty, and took enormous risks. They're worth honoring in the 
walk." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
5 WITH THE RIGHT STUFF 
</P>
<P>
James H. (Jimmy) Doolittle, 93 
</P>
<P>
Known as the granddaddy of test pilots. Played a leading role in developing 
aircraft instruments and made the first successful "blind" or instruments-only 
flight in 1929. Won a Medal of Honor for voluntarily leading a raid by 16 B-25 
bombers against Tokyo on April 18, 1942. A retired Air Force lieutenant 
general, Doolittle lives in Pebble Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
Anthony W. (Tony) LeVier, 77 
</P>
<P>
Made more maiden flights on untested aircraft than any other pilot. During 30 
years of testing for Lockheed, he invented several safety and performance 
devices, including the Master Caution Warning Light system still in use today. 
Piloted the first flight to exceed 1,000 m.p.h. in a jet-powered aircraft. He 
lives in La Canada Flintridge. 
</P>
<P>
Charles E. (Chuck) Yeager, 67 
</P>
<P>
Legendary combat and test pilot immortalized in Tom Wolfe's book "The Right 
Stuff." First pilot in the world to break the sound barrier (1947), even though 
he had two broken ribs at the time. Logged more than 10,000 hours in 180 
different military aircraft. Now a retired Air Force brigadier general, Yeager 
lives in Cedar Ridge, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
A. Scott Crossfield, 68 
</P>
<P>
First test pilot to reach Mach 2, or twice the speed of sound, in 1953. Made 
more rocket-powered flights than any pilot in history. Helped design the X-15, 
the world's fastest, highest-flying, rocket-powered plane, for North American 
Aviation. He lives in Fairfax County, Va. 
</P>
<P>
William J. (Pete) Knight, 61 
</P>
<P>
Set the world's speed record in 1967 by flying the X-15 at Mach 6, or 4,520 
m.p.h., twice as fast as a .50-caliber bullet. One of only eight pilots to earn 
his astronaut's wings by flying the X-15 above 50 miles into space. A retired 
Air Force colonel, he became the first elected mayor of Palmdale in 1988.

<HEAD>Pilots Recall X-15's Hypersonic Flight, Link to Space Shuttle</HEAD>

   Veterans of the pioneering
X-15 program gathered to swap ``Right Stuff'' tales about
edge-of-space flight before the breakthroughs of space shots and
space shuttles.
   Three decades ago the rocket-powered X-15 ``spaceplane'' first
soared 67 miles over the desert and helped usher in a new era in
aeronautics. Fifty miles above Earth was considered the edge of
space, earning coveted astronaut wings for Air Force fliers in the
X-15 program.
   The three X-15 hypersonic research aircraft flew 199 flights in
one of the most successful aeronautical programs ever conducted.
   Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon, was among
the dozen or so military and civilian test pilots who flew the X-15
during the program operated jointly by the Air Force, Navy and
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The pilots recalled their adventures Thursday at a reunion
honoring them.
   ``This is kind of our last hurrah,'' said Milt Thompson, 63, an
X-15 veteran.
   Others attending included Scott Crossfield, whose exploits were
chronicled in Tom Wolfe's saga of the Space Age, ``The Right
Stuff,'' and retired Air Force Col. Pete Knight who went on to
become mayor of the nearby desert community of Palmdale.
   Another was Joe Engle, the only X-15 pilot to go on to command a
space shuttle. He made 16 X-15 flights and two orbital missions in
the shuttle.
   ``I like being around pilots,'' Engle said in a telephone
interview on Thursday night.
   ``When I grow up, I'm going to be one,'' he quipped.
   He said his experiences in the X-15 were among the most
professionally rewarding of a high-flying career.
   ``Every time you flew the X-15, you knew you were logging data
for designs (of aircraft and spacecraft) that hadn't even been
thought of yet,'' he said.
   The wicked-looking black needle-nosed rocket plane would arc
across the sky so quickly that the pilot feared he was aiming
straight for the Pacific Ocean, said Thompson, now chief engineer
for NASA at the Ames-Dryden Research Facility.
   ``That was the geometry of it,'' he said. ``It was just flying
that fast.''
   The first X-15 flight was on June 8, 1959 and the final flight on
Oct. 24, 1968, a $300 million program that was the last in a
venerable line of research rocket planes. Chuck Yeager broke the
sound barrier in 1947 in the Bell X-1 that he dubbed ``Glamorous
Glennis'' in honor of his wife.
   After flying the X-15, Thompson said he moved away from flight
test ``because everything was winding down.'' There would not be
another research plane as rewarding to pilot, he lamented.
   A total of three X-15 rocket planes were built and one was
destroyed in an accident in 1967. Air Force Maj. Michael Adams died
in that crash when the X-15 broke up while diving from an altitude
of 265,000 feet
   The original design goal for the X-15 was 4,000 mph, but the
aircraft eventually flew at more than six times the speed of sound,
which is 760 mph. In addition to reaching a maximum 4,520 mph, it
soared to 345,200 feet.
   The flights allowed researchers to perform many experiments on a
repeated basis that aided in developing space technology. The
capabilities and limitations of the human pilot in flying space
trajectories and re-entry maneuvers and conditions were thoroughly
explored.
   The success of the X-15 design, development and flight program
allowed the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo spaceflight programs to
accelerate.
   ``When it became clear that the Space Age was upon us and the
need to put a human into Earth orbit became a matter of national
urgency, a massive backlog of aerospace technology was already at
hand in the X-15 program,'' said John V. Becker of NASA's Langley
Research Center in Hampton, Va.
   Years later, the space shuttle's landing characteristics would be
designed to emulate the X-15.

   Capt. Jacquelyn S. Parker
is the Air Force's first woman test pilot, and the 28-year-old flier
has her eye on the space shuttle.
   ``The work and the flying was as hard and challenging as everyone
said it would be,'' Parker said. ``Now, I'm looking forward to
putting it to use testing airplanes and hopefully, someday, fly the
space shuttle.''
   Parker was one of 25 navigators, pilots and flight engineers who
graduated last weekend from the Air Force Test Pilot School, which
runs a rigorous program to train personnel to test experimental,
research and prototype aircraft.
   The test pilot school is located about 60 miles north of Los
Angeles at the Mojave Desert air base where the space shuttle lands
and where Chuck Yeager first broke the sound barrier in the Bell X-1
in 1947.
   Parker, of Wilmington, Del., goes to the 4950th Test Group,
Aeronautical Systems Division, based at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base in Ohio.
   ``You can erase my name, along with many others who were in the
class, and there's very little difference in our backgrounds,'' she
said. ``Women now are getting the experience and education they need
to get into the more exciting programs and I believe we have a lot
to offer these programs.''
   Parker served as a C-141 transport aircraft pilot with the 76th
Military Airlift Squadron based at Charleston Air Force Base, S.C.,
before entering the Test Pilot School in July 1988.
   She entered the Air Force in 1980 after working at NASA's Johnson
Space Center in Houston.

   The $500 million B-2 stealth bomber
revved its engines and taxied across a desert runway at up to 100
mph Monday, operating under its own power for the first time.
   The Air Force pronounced the tests of the sinister-looking,
black-and-gray flying wing a success and said high-speed tests of
the radar-evading nuclear bomber would be conducted later this week
with a view toward its first flight soon afterward.
   ``You've got a lot of firsts here today,'' said Maj. Pat
Mullaney. ``You have the first time under its own power, you have it
turning. All this has only been done before on computer
simulations.''
   The sleek, boomerang-shaped strategic bomber rolled from its
super-secret research hangar and taxied back and forth on an
11,000-foot runway at Air Force Plant 42, the crucible through which
virtually all Air Force aircraft pass.
   ``I love it,'' said Air Force spokeswoman Capt. Tess Taft, waving
an American flag.
   Three taxi tests at different speeds stopped traffic on Sierra
Highway next to the plant and offered the first unobstructed view of
the craft since it was unveiled for the news media on Nov. 22.
   At approximately $500 million each, the plane is the nation's
most expensive and controversial, joining the nation's arsenal
during a period of increasing Pentagon budget cuts.
   The stealth is designed to drop nuclear bombs and fire cruise
missiles and evade radar and infrared detection.
   Despite delays that have plagued the B-2, Brig. Gen. Richard
Scofield, B-2 program director, said, ``Everybody in the Air Force
is convinced that we are working the schedule the right way. We are
making sure the plane works right for when we do the hazardous
testing, and flight test is hazardous.''
   Tests on the B-2 took place in the Antelope Valley of the Mojave
Desert where the space shuttle was built and where test pilot Chuck
Yeager first broke the sound barrier in 1947.
   For weeks, people fascinated with the eerie manta-like aircraft
have parked nearby, hoping for a glimpse. On Monday, the dozen or so
regulars got an eyeful.
   The plane rolled out of its hangar shortly after sunrise and
stayed in view of highway onlookers for three hours. Periodically,
its engines ran at various pitches and decibels, sometimes blowing a
lonesome whistle across the desert, sometimes accelerating up to a
dull roar.

<TEXT>     Virtually all the Air Force planes that bombed Iraq into submission during
Operation Desert Storm passed their first tests above Edwards' 44-square-mile
alkaline wasteland known as Rogers Dry Lake. The lake bed also provides a
landing strip for NASA space shuttles as they drop in from earth orbit.;   
But billion-dollar, high-tech aircraft such as the B-2 Stealth bomber and the
Advanced Tactical Fighter prototypes are hangared on a frontier-style base
that has seen little improvement since Yeager's test pilot days in the 1950s.;
   "The whole base is a '50s base," said Maj. Gen. John P. Schoeppner,
commander of the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards.;    "What happened
out here is that people got enamored with the test flight business,"
Schoeppner said. "What got ignored was the infrastructure.";    The windswept
facility is plagued by groundwater pollution, sewage problems, collapsed water
pipes, faulty electrical wiring and -- ominously -- large cracks and fissures
in landing zones that threaten to hamper space shuttle operations.;    It also
has dangerous desert roads, outdated barracks and seedy housing that dates
back to the Korean War.;    The infrastructure is so deteriorated that Gen.
Larry Welch, the retired Air Force chief of staff, noted last year that
Edwards would be closed if it were not such a national security resource.;   
Parts of the base "look like a dog's lunch," conceded Schoeppner.;   
Firefighting capability down;  A loss of water pressure in Roman-style
subterranean pipes left the base without firefighting capability except for
the water in the fire trucks. This at the same time that super-sophisticated
aircraft such as the B-2 and ATFs are passing through the crucible of test
operations.;    "I've got multimillion-dollar assets and NASA that I'm
responsible for," the general said.;    Chronic power shortages at Edwards
also have postponed test operations at the facility that is base to 122
aircraft flying 28,000 hours annually.;    Schoeppner and his staff have been
working on remedies and the Flight Test Center commander recently earned a
prestigious "Laurel" award from Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology for the
efforts.;    The condition of the remote desert base imposes hardships and
safety hazards on military families. For example, the road conditions
contributed to 15 "rollover" accidents last year.;    At the time it looked
like the base might erode into the desert sands, the Air Force encountered
moratoriums on military construction because of shrinking defense budgets.;   
But Edwards' role as the prime test facility won it some reprieves.;    Using
a "money mosaic" combining $32 million in emergency military construction
funds and money patched from various programs, the Air Force is laying down
fresh ribbons of asphalt on the desert and installing new electrical and water
lines.;    A major environmental cleanup is under way to heal damage caused by
decades of hazardous waste disposal from aviation fuels and metals.;    Cracks
checked for danger;  Engineers are evaluating the operational danger caused by
cracks and fissures out on the enormous dry lake bed that makes the area a
test pilot's dream for emergency landings.;    Schoeppner said the base also
is partway through refurbishing the ancient housing and barracks and is in the
process of making over "quality of life" sections such as the Base Exchange, a
community center, a youth center and the baseball field named after Challenger
astronaut Ellison Onizuka.;    Edwards is situated far out on the desert,
nearly 100 miles from Los Angeles and 30 miles from the nearest city of any
size. The home of the test pilots celebrated in the book and movie "The Right
Stuff" sometimes compares to Greenland, in terms of its remoteness.;    "My
fiancee hates it," noted 2nd Lt. James Law during a recent tour of the base.
"She's from Maine.";    Law, 23 and fresh out of the Air Force Academy, noted
with pride a landscaping project near the base hospital that combined desert
shrubbery and some fresh strips of greenery.;    "We can't use too much grass,
but people love the grass," the Colorado native said, wistfully. "It almost
looks like a normal base here.";    Schoeppner noted that young military wives
often cry the first time they see the sandy stretches and rocky hills that
form Edwards' dominant terrain.;    "The wives cry when they come on the base
. . . and then they cry when they leave because of the friendships they've
formed and because of the mission we have and the closeness.;    "You have the
whole spectrum of emotions here," Schoeppner said.  </TEXT>

   Twenty years ago, a delta-winged wonder known as the
Concorde 001 took off on its maiden flight, lifting off gracefully
from an airstrip in southern France and becoming the fastest
commercial jet in the sky.
   About 3,000 people gathered in a hangar on Thursday to toast the
event and to promote plans for a second-generation Concorde to carry
passengers into the 21st century at twice the speed of sound.
   Plans for the new jet were unveiled Wednesday at Aerospatiale
offices in the southern French city of Toulouse. The state-owned
company built the Concorde with British Aerospace.
   Sir Raymond Lygo, chief executive of British Aerospace, and Henri
Martre, president of Aerospatiale, said $555 million in government
backing is being sought for developing the new jet, designed to
carry 280 passengers and travel at 1,550 mph.
   British Airways and Air France each owns seven Concordes, which
can travel up to 1,367 mph and carry 100 to 144 people.
   The new design retains the shape of a sleek bird with a
downturned beak, which many aircraft aficionados call the world's
most beautiful high-flying silhouette.
   Rolls Royce, which provides the engines for the present Concorde
fleet, announced this week it could design a new engine that would
be considerably lighter and greatly increase the range and
efficiency of the jets.
   Those celebrating Thursday included Andre Turcat, the test pilot
who flew the Concorde 001 for 29 minutes over dozens of reporters
and thousands of people who had jammed roads around the airfield to
watch.
   Turcat, later elected mayor of Toulouse, said when he landed,
``And so, at last, the big bird flies, and as you can see, it flies
very well.''
   The British Concorde 002 made its first flight, guided by pilot
Brian Trubshaw, on April 9, 1969.
   Six months later, the plane broke the sound barrier.
   Breaking the profit barrier was another matter.
   Between the first commercial flights in 1976 and 1984, the
jetliner flew in the red.
   The plane was expensive to operate, and Air France lost $24
million between 1976 and 1980. Annual subsidies from Britain to keep
their Concordes aloft were estimated at $30 million yearly.
   Passenger traffic gradually increased. Operations were
streamlined and the Concorde showed its first profit in 1986.
   In 1987, Air France showed a net profit of more than $14.2
million from the Concorde's regular Paris-New York run and from
charter flights. Figures for 1988 are not yet available.
   Last year, 42,379 passengers took the three-hour Paris-New York
flight, which got them to New York two hours before they left.
   The flight is $4,856 round-trip, compared to $3,986 for a
regular, round-trip first-class seat.
   Faced with the early unprofitablity of the jet, the high cost of
fueling it and opposition from environmental groups opposed to the
noise, the United States and other countries chose to stay out of
the supersonic marketplace.
   But if U.S. airlines don't fly the planes, U.S. passengers do.
Air France and British Airways say more than half their clients last
year were Americans.

   ``And we are going forward with research on a new Orient Express

   The idea has a nice ring to
it: Tokyo in two hours. Zooming over the Earth at 25 times the
speed of sound. Crossing the Pacific in an airplane so
revolutionary the space shuttle and the Concorde become old hat.
   Third millenium, here we come.
   That airplane, or something like it, is taking shape at this and
other NASA centers in bits and pieces: a model is assaulted in a
wind tunnel by 4,800 mph blasts in temperatures hundreds of degrees
below zero; an electron beam illuminates air flow around a
scaled-down plane; a sleek cylinder zips through a water trough
3,000-feet long, sensitive to every nuance of resistance; a
photograph captures shock wave and heat patterns in ghostly hues of
green, orange, yellow, blue and magenta; the most powerful computer
ever built ingests world-class problems and spits out answers; a
standard airplane circles over Chesapeake Bay, piloted not from the
standard cockpit in front, but from a second, all-electronic one,
in its passenger section.
   The ``Little A'' in NASA _ the aeronautics part of National
Aeronautics and Space Administration _ is not as flashy as the
``Big S'' and gets only 7 percent of the agency's budget, but its
accomplishments brush our lives in thousands of ways.
   A poultry plant in Marietta, Ga., is quieter because of NASA
aeronautics; water quality in many places is improved because of
aeronautics technology; firemen wear better protective clothing.
   ``We are called the space agency by many, probably including
yourself,'' Jeremiah F. Creedon, the director for flight systems at
the Langley Research Center, tells a visitor, a bit of resignation
in his voice. ``Many of us here think the A is a large one.''
   Langley's work is divided roughly 60 percent aeronautics, 40
percent space, with a hefty dose of military work in both. With
other NASA research centers _ Ames and Dryden in California and
Lewis in Ohio _ its business is to develop technology and pass it
on, without cost, to aircraft companies. The federal government has
played that role from the start of its involvement 70 years ago.
   The agency has never built an airplane, but few planes fly today
without engines, designs, materials and structures conceived at
NASA. ``We are doing research that benefits the country,'' says
Creedon. ``It is available to Boeing, Lockheed and McDonnell
Douglas, whoever wants to build transport or high performance
aircraft.'' No single company alone could afford NASA's $2 billion
investment in wind tunnels.
   Here at Langley, they don't talk about the ``Orient Express.''
It's either the NASP, the National Aerospace Plane, or better yet
the X-30, next in a string of experimental planes that began with
Chuck Yeager's X-1, breaker of the sound barrier.
   When President Reagan made his rosy prediction about the Orient
Express, a week after the Challenger space shuttle disaster,
engineers had already taken years to decide the X-30 was possible.
Reagan's one-paragraph announcement signaled the start of Phase 2,
perfecting the technology, which will last until the summer of
1990, when engineers will take a hard look at where they stand and
decide whether to build the X-30. Phase 3, in the mid-'90s, would
see the aerospace plane begin flight tests that would finish as the
21st century begins.
   That's the timetable for the largest experimental aircraft
project ever undertaken by the United States. It will cost $3.3
billion. Clearly NASA and the Air Force, which is sharing the cost,
have something more practical in mind than building one or two
prototype planes, merely to prove it can be done.
   The military and package-delivery firms such as Federal Express
and UPS are the only ones likely to have use for a plane flying 25
times the speed of sound _ fast enough to get into orbit. But the
aerospace plane will provide the technology for the somewhat slower
but far more useful aircraft of the future.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUND BARRIER TO BLOCK LAX NOISE TO BE

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
El Segundo will study the feasibility of installing a sound barrier along 
Imperial Highway to reduce the noise from Los Angeles International Airport, 
which has plagued the city for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Airport Commissioners last week allocated $50,000, but no date for 
the start of the study has been set, said Don Harrison, assistant to the city 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
The terrain along Imperial is hilly, and Harrison said the city believes that 
an earthen berm or a wall could effectively shield homes in lower-lying 
neighborhoods from the engine noise of aircraft on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Beard, LAX airport noise abatement officer, said a 20-foot-high berm and 
wall combination built several years ago north of the airport has cut noise 
from planes operating on the ground by up to 50% for the first two rows of 
homes near the wall.

AF SAYS BYE-BYE BLACKBIRD AS SPY JET SETS RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The SR-71 Blackbird spy plane roared into history Tuesday with a record-setting 
cross-country flight and a roof-rattling sonic boom heard across Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
The Mach 3 high-altitude jet flew from Los Angeles to Dulles International 
Airport near Washington in an official time of 68 minutes and 17 seconds. It 
averaged 2,112.52 m.p.h. on its way to retirement on permanent display at the 
Smithsonian Institution. 
</P>
<P>
The old record for coast-to-coast flight was 3 hours and 38 minutes, set in 
April, 1963, by an American Airlines Boeing 707 on a commercial flight from Los 
Angeles to New York. That plane averaged 680.9 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackbird, shaped like a pointy-nosed manta ray, is being retired for 
budgetary reasons after 25 years of secret service, Air Force officials said. 
Most of its highly classified photographic surveillance missions are now 
performed by spy satellites. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft took off from its Mojave Desert airfield in Palmdale at Air Force 
Plant 42 at 4:30 a.m. PST. It flew out over the Pacific, was refueled for its 
transcontinental flight, then took a running start across the California 
coastline near Oxnard, accelerating to top speed with a massive blast as it 
broke the sound barrier. 
</P>
<P>
"It was awesome," Air Force Col. Tom Hornung said of the predawn liftoff from 
California. "It was a fitting end to a great Air Force program." 
</P>
<P>
The sonic boom was felt across a wide area north of Los Angeles, from Newhall 
to Van Nuys to as far west as Oxnard in Ventura County. Some police departments 
reported a rash of calls from people thinking it was an earthquake or an 
aftershock from last week's quake centered near Upland. 
</P>
<P>
The plane climbed from 60,000 feet as it burned off fuel, eventually reaching 
an altitude "in excess of 80,000 feet," said pilot Lt. Col. Raymond E. 
Yeilding, who was accompanied by reconnaissance systems officer Lt. Col. J. D. 
Vida. The pilot said tail winds of 6 knots were not a factor in the plane's 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
It crossed the East Coast east of Salisbury, Md., was refueled and then cruised 
into Dulles airport in Chantilly, Va., about 20 miles west of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Yeilding's Blackbird set three other point-to-point speed records: Los Angeles 
to Washington at 2,153.24 m.p.h., Kansas City to Washington at 2,200.94 m.p.h. 
and St. Louis to Cincinnati at 2,242.48 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The records were certified by the National Aeronautic Assn., keeper of the 
nation's aviation and space records, association President Malvern J. Gross Jr. 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The sinister-looking twin-engine SR-71 is the fastest, highest-flying 
production aircraft ever built. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems awfully ironic on the final flight of this aircraft to be setting 
these records," Gross said. "Usually, records are set at the beginning, not the 
very end of the program. One has to wonder whether it really makes sense to 
retire this aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
"Bye-bye, Blackbird," said Ben Rich, director of the Lockheed Aeronautical 
System Co.'s "skunk works" in Burbank who helped design the Blackbird. "I 
cannot honestly say this is a happy day for me." 
</P>
<P>
It was not a happy morning for a lot of other people, either, but for a 
different reason. 
</P>
<P>
"It sounded to me like an explosion and woke me out of a sound sleep," said 
Sgt. Denny Phillips of the Oxnard Police Department. "My next thought was it 
was an earthquake, like when you get those jolting kind of quakes. This thing 
was probably 10 times the magnitude of a shuttle landing and I've heard almost 
all the shuttle sonic booms." 
</P>
<P>
Police said calls reporting windows rattling and houses shaking started 
lighting up switchboards shortly after 6 a.m., primarily from communities in 
the Antelope and San Fernando valleys, where the sonic boom was heard the 
loudest. 
</P>
<P>
Burbank police officer Dan Crawford said he heard "one loud boom, although 
other people heard two. At first I thought it was the space shuttle coming in, 
but then I remembered it had already come down. It shook the windows pretty 
good." 
</P>
<P>
What they heard was SR-71 model No. 17972, which was headed for the 
Smithsonian. The donated plane will be displayed at a Dulles airport wing of 
the National Air and Space Museum. Eight other Blackbirds are going to museums; 
three will be given to NASA for aeronautical research, and three are being 
mothballed in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Air Force officials have rarely displayed the plane, and many of its 
performance characteristics remain classified. The service will not even say 
how many of the planes were built. 
</P>
<P>
The spy plane ended its flight by diving to 200 feet above the Dulles runway as 
it screamed, with afterburners lit, past rows of dignitaries assembled for its 
retirement ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackbird has been a major source of aerial reconnaissance photographs of 
targets around the globe for U.S. military and intelligence agencies since it 
first began flying in 1964. The SR-71, which can outrun any fighter jet in the 
world, has never been shot down or captured. 
</P>
<P>
It succeeded the U-2 surveillance plane, one of which was shot down over the 
Soviet Union in May, 1960. Its pilot, Francis Gary Powers, was seized by the 
Soviets and pleaded guilty to espionage charges but was released two years 
later in a spy swap. 
</P>
<P>
The SR-71's old world record for absolute speed was 2,193 m.p.h. It also holds 
the record for sustained altitude in horizontal flight -- 85,069 feet. One 
Blackbird flew from New York to London in September, 1974, in 1 hour, 54 
minutes and 56 seconds at an average speed of 1,807 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful aircraft and I'm glad that, if they are going to retire it, 
they're giving one to the Smithsonian so generations of the future can see our 
technology," Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
Staff writer Richard Beene in Los Angeles contributed to this story.

BLACKBIRD -- A SYMBOL OF COLD WAR RETIRES 
</P>
<P>
America's premier spy plane -- the SR-71 Blackbird -- broke four speed records 
as it headed for a final resting spot in the Smithsonian's National Air and 
Space Museum. 
</P>
<P>
After 25 years of supersonic snooping, the black, dagger-shaped aircraft 
flashed coast to coast in 68 minutes, 17 seconds -- three times faster than the 
old record of 3 hours, 38 minutes set in 1963 by a Boeing 707. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's flight set speed records of 2,153.24 m.p.h. between Los Angeles and 
Washington; 2,242.48 m.p.h. between St. Louis and Cincinnati, and 2,200.94 
m.p.h. between Kansas City and Washington. Sonic booms were reported in various 
communities along its flight path.

   A crowd approaching half a
million people, the second-largest ever to witness a shuttle
landing, became mired in a traffic jam of galactic proportions as
they headed home after Discovery's triumphant return.
   An estimated 109,000 cars, motor homes, trailers and trucks
carrying about 410,000 Discovery watchers churned clouds of
talcum-fine dust into the desert air Monday as they inched toward
the only exit from the public viewing area.
   It took vehicles 4{ hours or longer to cover the mile to the
exit from the dry lakebed. From there, traffic crawled along a
two-lane blacktop road at 20 mph.
   In addition to the huge crowd at the public viewing area, Air
Force spokesman Lt. Col. George Neiss estimated another 15,000 to
20,000 viewers watched the landing at a separate VIP section,
bringing the total crowd to 425,000 or more.
   The only larger crowd to watch a shuttle land was on July 4,
1982, when an estimated 500,000 turned out as President and Nancy
Reagan greeted Columbia.
   ``This is crazy,'' said Ellery Sabin, 66, who drove his 33-foot
motor home from Ludington, Mich., to see the landing on the Mojave
Desert floor. ``I've been around crowds, but this is really
something.''
   Like many shuttle watchers, he said Discovery's return would
reinvigorate America's space program.
   ``There's such a sense of pride here,'' Sabin said.
   Two sonic booms announced the shuttle's return at 9:34 a.m.,
eliciting gasps and screams from the crowd.
   ``It sends chills up my spine,'' said 26-year-old Steve Bestwick
of Port Hueneme.
   Vice President George Bush, California Gov. George Deukmejian
and famed pilot Chuck Yeager also were on hand to welcome
Discovery's crew home.
   Commander Rick Hauck noted that since waking up Monday, he had
circled the globe eight times and crossed the coast of California
at 120,000 feet and traveling eight times the speed of sound.
   Then he turned to the first man to break the sound barrier and
said, ``Eat your heart out, Chuck Yeager.''

had been staying after suffering a heart attack at his own home in Lancaster,
which is near the base. There will be no service, officials said.;    "The
aerospace community lost a real expert," said Milt Thompson, chief of
engineering at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on Tuesday.
"He was the foremost person in flight research.";    Oversaw X-15 programs; 
Mr. Bikle headed Dryden from September 1959 until his retirement in May 1971.
During his tenure, he oversaw such programs as the X-15 rocket, which
pioneered technology later employed to build and fly space shuttles.;    W.J.
"Pete" Knight, an X-15 test pilot who set a world's record of 4,520 mph on
Oct. 3, 1967, said he was saddened by Mr. Bikle's death.;    "On all counts,
he was a great individual," said Knight, who is mayor of Palmdale, another
city not far from Edwards.;    "I was proud to have known and worked with him.
He was one tremendous individual, and it's a great loss.";    Early in the
1960s in a work area called "Bikle's Bicycle Shop," NASA engineers built what
they referred to as a lifting body and nicknamed a flying bathtub. These
lifting bodies proved that an unpowered aircraft returning from space could be
maneuvered to a designated landing site.;    Mr. Bikle "was the one individual
responsible for the success of the X-15 and lifting-body program," Thompson
said. "The X-15 and the lifting-body programs combined provided an enormous
amount of experience and technology that led to the design of the space
shuttle.";    Mr. Bikle also piloted sailplanes and held the world's altitude
record for sailplanes -- 46,269 feet -- for more than 20 years. He made his
record flight near Lancaster on Feb. 25, 1961.;    "I'm like Chuck Yeager in

Wilkinsburg, Pa. After graduating from the University of Detroit with a degree
in aeronautical engineering, Mr. Bikle went to work in 1940 for Wright
Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio, doing flight-testing work on the B-29 bomber,
the aircraft used to drop the atomic bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, officials
said.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Three ear-shattering booms
mark the flight of an F-111 thundering at supersonic speed just 200
feet above a test range in the Florida panhandle.
   The fighter-bomber drops an experimental bomb, then the pilot
yanks the throttle back to idle, cutting the jet's thrust 90
percent.
   In seconds, the plane's speed drops from 940 mph to just under
600 _ a radical maneuver designed to limit noise and damage from
sonic booms.
   Without it, windows might have shattered in Holley and Navarre,
which lie near the end of the range; with it, residents might not
even hear the booms.
   ``It's such a violent deceleration we are actually thrown
forward in the cockpit, held back by our seat straps,'' said Maj.
Dan Isbell in an interview. ``We try our best to be good neighbors.
We don't want to go around breaking people's windows.''
   Isbell, a test pilot from Chattanooga, Tenn., was describing a
typical mission at Mach 1.2, or just over the speed of sound, at
the Air Force's only supersonic test range in the eastern United
States. The special low-level missions test non-nuclear weaponry
being developed here, including so-called smart bombs that glide to
their targets with pinpoint accuracy.
   Col. Harvey Greenberg, Eglin's chief claims officer, said the
Air Force nationwide received 265 claims for $465,138 in the 1987
budget year, but paid only $67,003 for 160 claims deemed valid
while denying 80. Some claims carry over to the next year.
   Eglin accounted for 27 of the valid claims and $4,931 in
damages, Air Force records show.
   But it has been worse in the past. A single boom in 1984
produced 34 claims that cost Eglin $15,865.
   The only other places where the Air Force permits low-level
supersonic flights are Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., and certain
other desert areas in the West, Isbell said.
   But none is as close to populated areas as Eglin's Range B-70.
Holley and Navarre lie just five to seven miles to the west.
   The 13-mile-long range is in the western half of a
720-square-mile military reservation, about 10 miles northwest of
Fort Walton Beach, once billed as ``Home of the Sonic Boom.''
   Local newspapers and radio stations carry Air Force news
releases about impending supersonic flights so residents won't be
startled if they hear the booms, said George Roberts, a civilian
spokesman in Eglin's public affairs office. He said missions have
been canceled when the releases failed to make the newspapers.
   Predicting the strength of sonic booms is an inexact science
that depends on such variables as aircraft size, speed, altitude
and weather factors including wind, air pressure and temperature,
Isbell said.
   Temperature inversions are the most serious complication,
capable of bouncing the sonic shock waves great distances. Isbell
said inversions have been suspected of breaking windows as far away
as downtown Pensacola, about 30 miles to the west.
   The F-111 is the largest of several types of aircraft used in
low-level supersonic testing and thus produces the loudest and most
damaging booms.
   An aircraft flying faster than the speed of sound generally
creates three shock waves, one by its nose, another by its
midsection and the third by its tail, Isbell said.
   Shock waves are caused when air molecules cannot get out of the
way of a plane flying faster than the speed of sound.
   The booms, however, dissipate rapidly over distance. Those
produced at high altitudes rarely are heard on the ground, and
supersonic flight above 30,000 feet, or almost 6 miles up, is
unrestricted, Isbell said.
   Studies conducted by the National Aeronautic and Space
Administration, which was checking the potential for damage from
space shuttles, indicate window breakage is about the worst damage
that can be caused by an aircraft.
   Some people, however, give sonic booms credit for more.
   A man living just across the Alabama state line about 50 miles
west of Eglin once complained that a sonic boom knocked his mobile
home off its foundation. The man later admitted he hadn't heard a
sonic boom and wasn't even home at the time. He later told Isbell
that he first thought it was caused by dynamiting at a quarry
across the street until he saw a television news report about a
boom causing broken windows at nearby cities.
   The most recent effort to limit boom complaints has been setting
up special meters that register shock waves even if they are
inaudible, Isbell said.
   ``Although arming the Air Force is our mission, we will always
have a responsibility to be good neighbors,'' he said. ``Minimizing
sonic booms is one way to fulfill that responsibility.''

FT  18 AUG 94 / Technology: Skids on Japan's motorway noise - A look at a
new material which absorbs sound
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW DERRINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A small company in northern England is hoping to develop an interest in the
Japanese motorway system. Sound Absorption, based in Lancashire, has
appointed Hitokuchi Zaka Studios as the Japanese distributor for its
acoustic cladding material, Coustone, which it hopes will be used for
motorway sound screens.
Coustone is made from flint particles bonded together with resins. It has
excellent acoustic properties, as it both absorbs and insulates sound. But
its physical robustness makes Coustone particularly suitable for highway
sound barriers.
The key to Coustone's sound-absorbing properties is the existence of
air-filled spaces between the flint particles. Spaces allow sound to enter
the material instead of being reflected, and are a feature of sound
absorbers.
In buildings where acoustic quality is very important, such as concert
halls, resonant cavities may be incorporated into the structure. These
absorb the sound, which can be monitored with a microphone and fed back
through a loudspeaker, allowing electronic control of acoustic quality.
Simpler sound-absorbing materials are usually porous or fibrous substances.
The sound-deadening effects of curtains and human bodies are
a matter of everyday experience.
Mineral wool is widely used when sound absorption must be incorporated into
a building's structure. Substances used in Japan include glass wool,
ceramics, foamed concrete, aluminium fibre and sintered aluminium.
None of the alternative sound-absorbing materials is as strong as Coustone,
according to Toshio Obayashi, of CI Kasei, a Tokyo engineering firm which
has used the material on a number of building projects. Sales in the UK have
also depended heavily on its non-acoustic properties, according to Mike
Hadfield of Sound Absorption.
Coustone's acoustic properties are suitable for television or radio
recording studios, but the fact that it can be scrubbed and even sterilised
makes it popular as a sound-absorbing cladding for police interview rooms.
Since the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, UK interview rooms have to be
suitable for sound recording but have always posed difficult cleaning
problems.
Sound transmission can be effectively blocked by any heavy material. Sound
consists of a vibration, or pressure wave, travelling through the air.
Anything heavier than air needs more energy to make it vibrate, and so can
be used to make a barrier. Motorway sound screens in the UK are made of
wood. Most of the sound that strikes a wooden fence is reflected.
The limitation of materials such as wood or concrete for noise barriers is
that reflecting sound does not remove it. The sound merely returns to its
source, from where it can be reflected again. Reflections are a nuisance in
sound recording, because they reduce clarity, but they also increase sound
volume.
Coustone's combination of cleanability, ruggedness and sound absorption have
won favour in swimming pools, factories and indoor firing ranges in this
country.
It was selected for use in police firing ranges because of its resistance to
ricocheting bullets. But sound reflections are a severe problem in an indoor
range: the direct report of each shot is literally only half the problem.
The sound is reflected from the walls, the ceiling and the floor, as well as
travelling directly.
Noise exposure regulations limit the number of shots heard by each
instructor. Acoustic measurements show that in a firing range panelled with
Coustone the reduction in sound reflection roughly doubles the number of
shots that the instructor can hear.
Sound absorption is also considered important for motorway noise screens in
Japan. Highways run through densely populated areas, so the noise-reducing
effects of sound-absorbing barriers are more important. Noise screens up to
8m high have been constructed around motorways in Tokyo.

<LEADPARA>  Glennis Yeager, a third-generation native of the Grass Valley area and wife of
the celebrated test pilot Chuck Yeager, died Dec. 22 at Travis Air Force Base
after a six-year fight with cancer. She was 66.;    Her husband, friends and
writers had long described Glennis Yeager as a strong-willed, intelligent,
industrious and independent woman. In her husband's autobiography that
included Mrs. Yeager's reflections, she wrote that she developed those traits
growing up on a small Bangor farm.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Obituaries  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     An accomplished horse rider, hiker and a crack shot, she was best known to
millions throughout the world for her name that was part of the legend painted
on her husband's World War II P-51 fighter and on the X-1 in which he rode to
be the first man to break the sound barrier: "Glamorous Glennis.";    In the
movie adaptation of "The Right Stuff," Mrs. Yeager was portrayed as a
beautiful, quiet and somewhat mysterious woman.;    In her husband's book
"Press On!" Mrs. Yeager wrote:;    "If you've ever seen the movie 'The Right
Stuff' and you remember those scenes of Sam Shepard, playing Chuck, and
Barbara Hershey, as me, exchanging steamy looks -- well, our exact words may
have been different in real life, but the basic message about us is absolutely
true.;    "We felt very strongly about each other because each of us had just
what the other had been looking for, and I mean not just from the time we'd
reached marriageable age, but all our lives.";    The two met before World War
II when Chuck Yeager walked into the USO office in Oroville where Glennis was
working and arranged a dance for members of his squadron. Later, she
maintained that she hardly understood a word of his West Virginia drawl.;   
As for her role as an Air Force wife, Mrs. Yeager wrote:;    "I did what I
wanted to do and not what somebody else wanted me to do. I worked really hard
for squadron lunches and things like that -- it was a lot of fun putting on
shows and so on -- but I never felt it was necessary to be bored for the sake
of Chuck's career. And he wouldn't have wanted that either.";    In a 1988
interview, Chuck Yeager spoke briefly, and directly, of the chemotherapy and
surgery his wife had undergone since 1984 and of how she continued to work
hard at managing all of his affairs.;    "Man, if you can't do anything about
it, forget it and press on. . . . And she's got the same attitude.";    There
was no public memorial service.;    Besides her husband, Mrs. Yeager is
survived by sons, Mike, of Oregon, and Don, of Colorado, and daughters, Susan,
of Nevada City, and Sharon Flick, of Reno, and 13 grandchildren.  </TEXT>

   This high desert place is aviation's working hall of fame. 
The X-1 first punctured the sound barrier overhead. 
Later the space shuttle came to Earth here. 
Now another flying legend is lifting off, its pilot pedaling hard. 

   It is the inaugural flight of the Daedalus, the world's most advanced human-powered airplane. 
All systems are go as it climbs to a cruising altitude of 15 feet. 
But then a gearbox connecting the pedals to the propeller breaks. 
Seconds later, the plane touches down as its ground crew jumps from a chase truck and jogs beside the aircraft to steady its fragile wings. 

   Despite the problem, the Daedalus is almost ready for its main mission: a recreation this spring of the flight of the mythological Greek inventor Daedalus, who escaped from prison on the island of Crete by making wax-and-feather wings and flying 70 miles to the mainland of Greece. 

   The project sprang from the heads of several young engineers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1985. 
Last year, their prototype aircraft flew 133 minutes here to set a world distance record of 37 miles for human-powered flight. 
Backed by corporate and other sponsors, they now have built an even more exquisitely engineered plane, which has the wingspan of a DC-9 airliner but weighs only 70 pounds. 
Its creators boast that their flying potato chip has "the light stuff." 

   Now the project's focus is perfecting a human engine -- an athlete who can float like a butterfly and pedal like a worker bee. 
The flight from Crete will last four to six hours, depending on winds and other factors. 
That is comparable to running two marathons nonstop. 
Some athletic events are longer, but none are so relentlessly demanding. 
If the modern Daedalus lets up even for a few seconds, he will plunge into the sea. 

   "This will be an unparalleled athletic event," says Ethan Nadel, a Yale University physiologist and adviser to the project. 
Mr. Nadel, who calls himself the project's engine mechanic, spent months testing dozens of athletes for the coveted role of Daedalus II, connecting them to heart and lung monitors and making them each take a hard four-hour ride on a stationary bicycle to test their endurance. 

   Some flunked the test. 
Others were rejected because they seemed too cocky. 
MIT's methodical engineers figured that a macho athlete aiming to make a big splash would probably do just that -- in the Aegean Sea. 
They wanted team players, athletes like Glenn Tremml. 

   He is the project's original Mr. Daedalus, a photogenic, personable development-phase pilot. 
Early last year, he set the world distance record, giving the project much-needed credibility. 
Later he was displaced as the project's main athlete when four more-physically talented bicycle racers were tapped as flight candidates. 
But Mr. Tremml, a University of Connecticut medical student, remains the consummate team player. 
"We were worried," he says, "until we found some athletes who could beat me" at cycling. 

   Only one will pedal into aviation history. 
The team follows a staggered training schedule, and the athlete at his physical peak when good weather conditions occur will make the flight. 
Such conditions may be rare, since the Daedalus can fly only in calm air. 

   Living in an apartment near Edwards, the athletes often rise by 5:30 a.m. to begin exhausting days crammed with flying lessons, meetings and bicycle rides of as long as 100 miles. 
Their diet, prescribed by a nutritionist, is jam-packed with energy food, such as pasta. 
Vigilant against dehydration, they are passionate water drinkers. 
Team member Kanellos Kanellopolus, Greece's top bicyclist, keeps a water bottle next to his bed for nocturnal swigging. 

   Bicycle racers are used to riding at speeds of 25 miles an hour or more -- a pace most people reach only going downhill. 
But heart rate matters more than speed to the Daedalus athletes. 
They wear electronic pulse monitors when they are training and are intimately acquainted with the maximum heart rate they can sustain for hours. 
To pace themselves, they set alarms on the pulse monitors to go off when their hearts beat too fast. 

   That happens regularly, especially when they take training rides together, says Greg Zack, a Daedalus athlete from Lexington, Ky. 
"We're all highly competitive," he says. 
"When we hit a six-mile climb in the mountains, it's guaranteed we'll be racing by the third mile." 
It is friendly competition, he adds, but the athletes have been known to quietly turn off their heart alarms when racing, giving themselves a secret edge. 

   They also are learning to fly gliders and the Daedalus prototype, a heavier, sturdier version of its successor. 
And they spend hours sweating in a computerized flight simulator, a kind of video game with pedals rigged up by the MIT whiz kids. 
"If he can't fly well, even a superjock couldn't make it" on the 70-mile flight, says John Langford, the project's director. 

   The Daedalus cruises at only 15 miles an hour and is controlled by a simple joystick. 
But its huge wingspan and gossamer construction make it tricky to fly, and even a minor crash could wreck it. 
Juan Cruz, who developed the featherweight, carbon-fiber tubes that serve as the Daedalus's bones, describes his nightmare-like vision of a slow-motion crash that snaps those spars like match sticks: "The whole plane folds flat. 
People rush to get the pilot out, yelling, 'Is he all right?' 
And then they kill him." 

   When flying, the athletes are coached via radio by Steven Bussolari, an MIT professor and seasoned pilot, who talks them through each flight from a chase truck. 
In Greece, he will follow in a boat. 
"Thank God Steve is there," says Frank Scioscia, a Daedalus athlete from Scranton, Pa., who worries about damaging the Daedalus planes. 
"Boy, I sure don't want to do anything to hurt these babies." 

   The athletes fret more about hitting the "wall" than the water, though. 
The wall is the point at which the mind says "keep going" and the body replies "no way." 
Mr. Nadel, the Yale physiologist, says top athletes typically hit it after about three hours of hard exercise, when energy reserves are exhausted and blood sugar starts to drop. 
To prevent that from happening on the Daedalus flight, he is developing a drink tailored specifically to the energy and water needs of the pilots. 

   Avoiding the wall isn't all physical. 
Erik Schmidt, a Daedalus athlete from Boulder, Colo., says, "We all have a stable of mental tricks" to keep going. 
They can, however, be summed up simply: Never think of your limits or distant goals; keep telling yourself to go just a little farther. 

   If the Daedalus pilot does run out of steam, though, he can toss a line to a chase boat, which in theory will be able to keep the aircraft aloft by pulling it to shore like a giant kite. 
And even if it goes down in the water, it should float. 

   Having honed their airplanes and human engines to a razor's edge, the project's members are confident they will succeed. 
But mindful of Daedalus's brash son, Icarus, who flew too close to the sun, melted his wings and fell fatally to the sea, they carefully avoid hubris. 
"I think it's going to be close," says Mr. Nadel.

  [Text] The situation in south Lebanon is worrying. We are 
receiving reports every five minutes of Israeli warplanes 
overflying the region. We received a report 10 minutes ago that 
Israeli warplanes are raiding the Iqlim al-Tuffah heights after 
intensive reconnaissance sorties throughout the night and into 
the morning over al-Nabatiyah, Iqlim al-Tuffah, western 
al-Biqa', al-Luwayzah, Jarju', and the central sector. 
  We received a report two hours ago that the Israeli 
bombardment of villages in the south intensified and continued 
until 1300, targeting the Iqlim al-Tuffah heights, Jarju', 'Ayn 
Bu Siwar, and Arab Salim. At about 1330, Israeli warplanes flew 
intensively at low altitude over Iqlim al-Tuffah and 
al-Nabatiyah, staging mock raids. The Lebanese Army confronted 
the aircraft with anti-aircraft guns. Iqlim al-Tuffah areas and 
al-Luwayzah came under artillery barrage at 1100 from the South 
Lebanese Army [SLA] and Israeli positions in al-Zaffatah. 
Resistance men fired at the sources. 
  Israeli aircraft reconnoitered the region up to east Sidon 
and al-Nabatiyah, breaking the sound barrier. Israeli warplanes 
flew low over western al-Biqa' at about 1100, again breaking the 
sound barrier over al-Nabatiyah. 
  The resistance men this morning attacked an SLA position in 
Sujud with rockets and mortar and clashes ensued in which all 
types of weapons were used. 
  At 1350 today, Israeli warplanes raided the Iqlim al-Tuffah 
heights, concentrating on al-Luwayzah, for the second time today. 
  Just in from the south, Israeli military aircraft are flying 
low over the Iqlim al-Tuffah heights and Lebanese Army ground 
anti- aircraft guns are confronting them. The resistance fired 
surface- to-air Strella missiles at the Israeli aircraft, 
causing panic in the region and making the people believe the 
Israeli aircraft had launched a new raid.

<TEXT>
   A fighter plane that combines long-range
supersonic cruise capability with a greatly enhanced ability to
dogfight at and above the speed of sound has long been an elusive
dream of aircraft designers.
   After 5{ years of research the solution to that engineering
enigma may be near at NASA's Langley Research Center, where
aeronautical visionaries believe they have seen the future in
something called the ``vortex flap.''
   The flap, with a distinctive, sharp downward angle, is designed
to improve the agility of swept-wing jets. Highly swept wings
assure the speed needed for sustained supersonic flight, but
unswept wings are preferable for the lift necessary for combat
maneuvers and short takeoffs and landings.
   The vortex flap ``would give you the best of both worlds,'' said
Ronald H. Smith, a 30-year veteran of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration who is flight project engineer for the vortex
flap experiment.
   The acute deflection of the wing's leading edge purposely
detaches the airflow over the wing and forms a tornado-like vortex
on the flap. This creates a suction that reduces drag _ the force
that resists an object's movement through the air _ during
high-speed maneuvering.
   ``This is a way to allow swept-wing airplanes to maneuver
better,'' said Smith, who has worked on X-15 rocket planes, the
YF-12 interceptor from which the SR-71 Blackbird reconnaissance
plane was derived, and the FA-18 fighter.
   With the vortex flap, maneuverability would be significantly
increased at speeds of .8 to 1.2 Mach, where most dogfighting is
done, he said. Flight tests with a delta-wing F-106B test aircraft,
have found the greatest reduction of drag _ 20 percent to 30
percent _ at .9 Mach.
   With reduced drag, a plane would need less thrust. The payoff
would be a smaller, lighter engine and a plane that could faster
and farther on less fuel. Such planes would not require
afterburners needed by today's fighters to reach and maintain
supersonic flight, but which guzzle fuel.
   ``Fighters today concentrate on maneuvering,'' Smith said.
``They are not aerodynamically efficient in supersonic speeds and
don't have appreciable supersonic endurance.''
   He said the vortex flap could be used on the Navy's F-14 fighter
and the Air Force's F-111 and B-1 bombers, which have wings that
can be swept back. It could not be used on the more conventional
F-15, F-16 and FA-18 fighters.
   Another application would be on swept-wing supersonic transports
like the French-British Concorde or the American SST project that
was canceled in 1971 because of its cost and noise, Smith said.
That ``isn't our main focus but it would benefit from our research.
The vortex flap would translate into noise reduction'' because of
smaller engines and lack of afterburners, he said.
   NASA research pilot Philip W. Brown said the first flight of the
F-106B with the vortex flap last Aug. 2 was about what he expected.
   ``I was thinking it probably would be reasonably well-behaved
because we had done high-speed taxi tests. It turned out it was
better than predicted. The simulator was a lot harder to fly,''
said Brown, a former Navy fighter pilot.
   Some flight stability was lost by adding the flap to the F-106B,
a 1960s vintage fighter, but the plane is only slightly more
demanding to fly than without the flap, he said.
   Flight testing will continue for another 1{ years. It follows
five years of study encompassing nearly 3,000 hours of wind tunnel
tests.
   A fighter with supersonic endurance and transsonic maneuvering
ability would have a clear edge, said NASA engineer James B.
Hallissy, the principal investigator of the flap. ``It would be
able to get to a target faster and the enemy would have less
response time...
   ``If you can fly faster than the other guy, you can catch him if
he's running from you, and he can't catch you. The more speed you
can sustain the better off you are.''

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE USS NIMITZ (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's Prince Andrew waved to
his wife, Sarah, as he streaked overhead in a jet catapulted from
the deck of the aircraft carrier Nimitz on Thursday during a tour
off the California coast.
   The airshow was a highlight of the day at sea for the Duke and
Duchess of York, both pilots, who also inspected one of the
catapults and the massive chains that hold the ship's two
60,000-pound anchors.
   ``This is one of the loneliest walks I've ever done,'' the
prince said moments before he boarded the S-3A Viking
anti-submarine warfare jet while Sarah remained on deck.
   As the engines screamed, an apprehensive duchess, wearing a
flight helmet, clutched a gift teddy bear and watched the jet
hurled off the bow.
   The jet wheeled back for a low fly-by and husband and wife waved
to each other before the pregnant duchess boarded a helicopter for
a flight to Long Beach, where the royal yacht Britannia is docked.
   The couple _ the duchess sporting a USS Nimitz baseball cap _
had arrived aboard a Navy helicopter. It landed on the carrier 60
miles west of Los Angeles as a loudspeaker announced: ``Duke of
York arriving.''
   The duke, a helicopter pilot in the Royal Navy who saw action in
Britain's Falkland Islands war with Argentina, saluted Vice Admiral
John H. Fetterman Jr., commander of Naval Air Forces in the Pacific.
   Trailing Andrew was the duchess, in a blue dress and white coat
with navy blue trim.
   The couple were presented leather flight jackets bearing the
inscriptions ``Duke of York'' and ``Duchess of York,'' then sat
down to watch an air show from the main deck of the nuclear-powered
aircraft carrier.
   Dramatic moisture blasts, an aircraft-enveloping fog caused as a
jet breaks the sound barrier, brought a wide-eyed reaction from the
duchess.
   Helicopters demonstrated anti-submarine warfare techniques and
supersonic jets made frequent fly-bys.
   Jet after jet touched down on the deck at 160 mph, catching one
of four cable arresters on the carrier's stern and stretching them
150 yards before coming to a halt. The planes then folded their
wings and taxied to catapults.
   Fetterman narrated for the duchess while the duke engaged in
spirited conversation with the ship's skipper, Capt. Brent Bennitt.
   All then went below for lunch. The menu included cream of
asparagus soup, marinated mushrooms, Melba toast with grilled
Parmesan cheese, chicken salad on a tomato wedge, cherries jubilee,
mineral water and iced tea.
   ``Spam? No Spam,'' Lt. Tim O'Leary, the ship's spokesman, said
in response to reporters' queries.
   The couple, touring Southern California to promote British
trade, started the day with a visit hosted by the International
Foundation for Learning Disabilities at Park Century School in Los
Angeles.
   British actress Joan Collins, a supporter of the charity, was on
hand for the visit.
   The duke and duchess arrived in Los Angeles last Friday and
depart Sunday.

ROARS FROM DOUGLAS' TESTS OF JET ENGINES BRING PROTESTS

<TEXT>
<P>
At Ed Roebuck's house on Warwood Road just east of Paramount Boulevard, 
vibrations from the noise are so intense that the putty in his sliding glass 
doors "jumps out," Roebuck says. 
</P>
<P>
At nearby Lakewood County Golf Course, the snarling roar shakes the pro shop 
and sends blood pressures spiraling. "You can be playing on the seventh green 
and practically fall over when (the noise) stops," golf pro Tom Petersen says. 
</P>
<P>
On Greenmeadow Road, 20-year resident Richard Depperman says the noise is 
getting so bad he bought a device to measure sound levels. 
</P>
<P>
And the city of Lakewood -- worried about a growing number of complaints -- has 
hired a consultant to study the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The roar that has for years periodically engulfed the southwest corner of 
Lakewood and parts of Long Beach occurs when nearby Douglas Aircraft tests the 
jet engines on its new airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
The tests, residents say, can last for up to 30 minutes, shaking buildings, 
drowning out the sound on their televisions and making conversation impossible. 
The area most affected, according to residents, stretches north from the 
Douglas test site to Del Amo Boulevard and is bounded roughly by Lakewood and 
Paramount boulevards on the east and west. 
</P>
<P>
Roebuck, an avid golfer, says he is particularly upset that the testing 
position of the jet planes sends exhaust and noise directly over the county 
golf course. 
</P>
<P>
"You can smell the jet fuel all over the golf course. . . . I just think it's 
terrible that (it) has to absorb all that punishment," Roebuck said. Even 
though his house is built next to the golf course, he said, he often plays on 
other courses to avoid the sound and smell of the engine tests. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole situation is that Douglas is a sacred cow," says Roebuck, a former 
Dodgers pitcher who scouts for the Cincinnati Reds. "Nobody wants to give them 
a hard time. They employ a lot of people around here." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1940, the Douglas plant has straddled the border between Long Beach and 
Lakewood and sprawled out around the runways of Long Beach Airport, another 
noisy neighbor. An estimated 35,000 people work at Douglas, a division of 
McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Airport receives about seven calls a month from Lakewood 
residents complaining about the Douglas testing, said Rod Dinger, the airport's 
senior noise control specialist. In November, Long Beach residents also filed 
23 complaints about the noise. Overall, the airport received 119 complaints in 
November about noise from flights at the airport and Douglas testing. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Long Beach, which leases parcels of its airport property to 
Douglas, has limited testing. Douglas is allowed to test planes between 7 a.m. 
and 9 p.m. on weekdays. No testing is allowed before 9 a.m. on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
The airport, said Dinger, is exploring the possibility of moving the test site 
from the edge of the airport property toward the center and perhaps building a 
hangar for the testing. However, he emphasized that the idea is in the 
exploration stage, and that it would take two years to get the necessary 
approvals from the city and the federal government before a hangar could be 
built. 
</P>
<P>
Donald N. Hanson, Douglas' manager of public relations, said: "We have done 
what we can to keep the noise down. We try to be as accommodating as we can, 
but at the same time we have to go on producing aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
The consultant, Thomas W. Fitzwater of Michael Brandman Associates in Santa 
Ana, says he has had little luck in getting Douglas to be specific on how many 
hours a week it tests. However, the firm did give Fitzwater some advance notice 
on tests so that he could record the decibel levels produced by the tests. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Depperman says he has learned from talking to people who know the 
industry that an engine must be tested eight hours before being handed over to 
its new owner. 
</P>
<P>
But Hanson, the Douglas spokesman, said the test hours can vary significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Before a plane takes flight, Hanson said, the engine is tested on the ground at 
various thrust levels until it functions smoothly at each level. "Sometimes it 
takes a few minutes, sometimes a lot longer," Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
The plant, according to Hanson, is turning out its MD80, a twin engine 
commercial jet transport plane, at a rate of 2.5 per week. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Ebner, Lakewood's planning and development director, acknowledged that 
Douglas' economic position in the community has helped insulate the company 
from public criticism. The insulation, however, may be unraveling because of 
accelerated production schedules and new airplane designs. 
</P>
<P>
Both Fitzwater and Depperman point out that Douglas has also started producing 
its MD11, a model that has a third engine mounted on the plane's fuselage. They 
believe that the third engine is adding to the noise problem because the engine 
is higher than the massive concrete slabs, known as blast fences, that are 
positioned along the testing field to deflect jet exhaust and sound. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater says the fences are used primarily to catch debris and do little to 
reduce noise. But Hanson says Douglas started testing MD11s only a couple weeks 
ago, that the third engine is not higher than the blast fence and that the 
fences do deflect noise. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson also pointed out that peak production for the plant was reached in the 
early '70s and that Douglas has produced other models that had third engines on 
the fuselage. He also noted that new federal noise restrictions have resulted 
in quieter engines than were produced a decade or two ago. 
</P>
<P>
The noise complaints, Hanson said, usually occur on days when there are 
atmospheric conditions that hold the noise down and push it outward. "It 
depends on the winds, the temperature and even the cloud cover sometimes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of its study, Lakewood has discovered that the current Douglas 
test site lies within the city's municipal boundary, though the Long Beach 
Airport owns the parcel and leases it to Douglas. Lakewood and its consultant, 
Ebner said, are exploring what legal steps the city can take to reduce test 
noise that originates within municipal boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Though he has not yet completed his report to the Lakewood council, consultant 
Fitzwater said possible solutions include requiring that tests be conducted in 
a building, moving the test site to another location, imposing stricter time 
limits on testing, or using new materials in sound barriers to help control 
noise.

AEROSPACE: BECAUSE IT IS BEING DESIGNED TO GO 17,000 M.P.H., IT WILL NEED NEW 
MATERIALS, A NEW ENGINE AND NEW COMPUTERIZED CONTROLS.

<P>
The aeronautics industry has not produced an aircraft capable of setting speed 
records since the early 1960s, but that is expected to change by the end of 
this decade. 
</P>
<P>
The National Aero-Space Plane, under development by Rockwell International and 
a team of three other firms, is being designed to fly at least 24 times the 
speed of sound or about 17,000 miles per hour, fast enough to soar into Earth 
orbit. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the $5-billion project depends on technology breakthroughs in at 
least three major areas: materials that can survive high temperatures, a new 
type of jet engine and computerized controls to operate the craft. 
</P>
<P>
The plane, also known as the X-30, would use a supersonic combustion ramjet 
engine or "scramjet." The scramjet is sometimes called a "flying stovepipe" 
because it consists simply of an inlet, a fuel combustion chamber and an 
exhaust nozzle. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike a conventional turbojet engine, which uses a mechanical compressor to 
feed high-pressure air to the engine, ramjets and scramjets rely on the force 
of air rushing into the inlet to compress and provide oxygen to the engine. 
</P>
<P>
A scramjet is similar to a ramjet, but with the important exception that the 
air flow into a ramjet slows to subsonic speeds before it is burned. In a 
scramjet, the air must be burned while moving at supersonic speeds. 
</P>
<P>
It may sound simple in concept, but burning liquid hydrogen fuel with oxygen 
moving at supersonic speeds is a daunting task. The air must mix with the 
liquid hydrogen, and the chemical reaction of burning must take place with 
precise timing. 
</P>
<P>
"In a scramjet, the mixing, transition and reaction (all occur at the same) 
time . . ., so everything is always dynamic," said Barry J. Waldman, the 
program's national director. 
</P>
<P>
An Air Force official in the Pentagon said serious questions remain as to 
whether engine combustion in the X-30 can be controlled adequately to prevent 
shock waves from interrupting the burning. 
</P>
<P>
A National Research Council report last year warned, "Flow instability poses 
the possibility of developing strong shock waves and catastrophic loss of the 
engine." 
</P>
<P>
Astronaut Joe Engle, who is consulting for Rockwell on the X-30 design, said 
the craft would have to be carefully flown, since abrupt maneuvers would affect 
the flow of air into the engine. 
</P>
<P>
Since such an engine can operate only during high-speed flight with onrushing 
air, the craft may have to carry two other types of engine: a standard turbojet 
to get it up to ramjet speed and a rocket for maneuvering in airless space. 
</P>
<P>
The scramjet cannot even be tested on the ground, so it will involve new risk. 
All previous manned spacecraft have had rocket engines that were tested 
repeatedly before their first flights. 
</P>
<P>
A partial test of certain X-30 components will be possible in a new wind tunnel 
-- or "shock tunnel" -- that Rockwell's Rocketdyne unit is building in Ventura 
County. It will create a Mach 25 air shock for a thousandth of a second over an 
area of a few square feet. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnel, called the Rocketdyne Hypersonic Flow Laboratory and costing about 
$18 million, is just one example of the profound technical problems involved in 
developing the X-30. The fluid dynamics of designing a craft to fly with 
lifting wings at very high Mach numbers is requiring the employment of several 
supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
The inlets and exhaust nozzle of the scramjet, for example, include the 
underbody of virtually the entire aircraft. It is the first time that the 
propulsion system and airframe of an aircraft are so totally interdependent. At 
Mach 25 the aircraft would travel at nearly five miles per second and 
undergoing tremendous heating from the friction of air against its surface. The 
underside of the aircraft would heat up to 2,300 degrees Fahrenheit and the 
nose to 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
The skin of the X-30 will likely be made of a new material, known as titanium 
aluminide, according to Rockwell Vice President Robert H. Gulcher. 
</P>
<P>
If funding continues uninterruptedly, test flights would begin in 1996 and a 
flight into Earth orbit attempted in 1998.

<TEXT>
   While there may be no quick answers to the
tragedy of Pan Am Flight 103, the wreckage scattered across the
Scottish countryside has left enough clues to make it virtually
certain the cause will be found, aviation experts said Friday.
   As more information surfaced, specialists noted the similarities
between Wednesday's crash of the Boeing 747 in Scotland that killed
all 258 people aboard and leaving at least 17 people missing on the
ground, and the crash three years ago of an Air India jumbo jet off
the Irish coast.
   Indian officials after months of retrieving wreckage from the
ocean floor concluded that a bomb exploded aboard the Air India
jetliner. An explosion is widely believed to have caused the Pan Am
plane to crash, although no conclusive evidence of a bombing has yet
surfaced.
   Both the Pan Am and Air India planes were cruising routinely at
31,000 feet and suddenly disappeared from radar. In neither case did
the flight crew declare an emergency or make any radio contact with
air traffic control. In both cases, the planes broke up in the air,
scattering wreckage over five or more miles.
   In both crashes, the recording from the cockpit gave no
indication the pilots were aware of any unusual, but contained a
muffled sound in the final split second of tape.
   That sound became crucial in the Air India investigation. The
final report on the accident concluded: ``From the sounds found
recorded on the CVR (cockpit voice recorder) and the (air traffic
control) tapes it appears that an explosion had occurred on board
the aircraft.''
   Authorities in Scotland announced Friday that a preliminary
review of the CVR tape from Pan Am Flight 103 also ends with a
muffled sound a fraction of a second before the recorder went dead.
   ``There is nothing in the conversation (of the pilots) to
indicate anything was wrong,'' said a British spokesman, reminiscent
of the Air India findings.
   Paul McKie, spokesman for the Department of Transport, cautioned
that further analysis will be required before it can be determined
what the noise might be and warned not ``to jump to any
conclusions.''
   More sophisticated spectrographic examination of the tape likely
will provide a better clue as to whether the sound is an explosion
from a bomb, or a breakup of the aircraft because of a sudden
decompression. Similar sounds have been heard on CVR taps in other
accidents when aircraft experienced major structural failures,
officials said.
   U.S. aviation experts, including several who have been involved
in investigating scores of air disasters, are confident the answers
will be found.
   ``It will be a massive job to reconstruct the pieces,'' said
Ronald Schleede, chief of aviation accident investigation at the
National Transportation Safety Board. ``But they're going to solve
it because the evidence will be there.''
   ``We will know what brought down Pan Am 103,'' FAA Administrator
Allan McArtor said, but he cautioned ``it could take months.''
   Neither McArtor nor Schleede, who has been briefed daily by
telephone by NTSB officials at the crash site, would discuss
specifically the Pan Am findings so far.
   But Schleede and other experts noted in interviews that the Pam
Am crash investigators have some advantages.
   For example:
   _While the crash caused an inferno in the small Scottish farming
town of Lockerbie, destroying a row of houses, most of the aircraft
_ with the exception of a destroyed right wing whose fuel tank
exploded _ appeared to have escaped serious fire damage.
   In many crashes where a plane remains intact and burst into
flames, critical clues are lost because of the intense heat that
bends metal and destroys evidence.
   _The wreckage, although strewn across the countryside, is not _
as was the case of Air India _ in hundreds of feet of water and
exposed to elements that could destroy critical evidence.
   _The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder appear to be
in good shape.
   In the coming days, investigators will pay close attention to how
parts of the aircraft are bent, tangled and singed and whether there
is evidence of a chemical residue normally left by an explosive.
   They also will search for fragments that might have been used as
a detonator and closely examine luggage and parts of luggage as well
as aircraft wreckage holes left by flying fragments. Such holes
leave a distinctive pattern if caused by an explosion, one expert
said.
   Some of the wreckage will be reassembled as closely as possible
to the original aircraft and metallurgists will try to determine how
the pieces broke apart. Was it from metal fatigue or from being torn
apart. Which part of an aircraft broke first? Did the pieces break
apart along specific seams of the aircraft's skin?
   The flight data recorder, which monitors the performance of the
aircraft, and the cockpit voice recorder will be examined and their
times coordinated. A key question is whether all of the plane's
electrical systems were knocked out simultaneously, one veteran
investigator said.
   It is known that Pan Am Flight 103 in rapid order lost its radar
transponder, radio contact and both flight and cockpit voice
recorders, this investigator said.
   If all of these functions failed simultaneously, there is strong
evidence of a massive electrical failure, possibly cause by an
explosion near the forward baggage compartment, which is adjacent to
the electrical and computer systems on the Boeing 747, experts
suggested.

airports are extremely environmentally-conscious. Airport managements,
especially in Europe, are not only aware that they can be penalised if they
transgress the regulations, but they are also just as concerned as local
populations with the well-being of the areas in which they themselves live
and work.
Many existing activities, especially in Europe and North America, are
already constrained by governmental regulatory requirements. These include
night curfews with severe restrictions on jet aircraft movements, as well as
the obligatory use of specified flight paths into and out of airports - to
minimise noise in built-up areas - take-off and landing 'noise abatement'
procedures, and strict operational procedures to minimise noise created by
aircraft on the ground.
The likelihood is that such environmental constraints will become even more
severe. The Airports Council International, representing the owners and
operators of almost 1,000 airports worldwide, believes that as environmental
regulations become increasingly important, the air transport industry,
because of its visibility and its continuing image as an elite mode of
transport, 'runs the risk of being singled out for special treatment in this
respect'. ACI believes airport owners must be ready for this.
But much progress has been made. Over the past 30 years, the noise of jet
engines has been progressively reduced through technology advances, while
legislation requiring the phasing out of older, noisier and dirtier aircraft
in favour of cleaner and quieter modern types has, together with improved
operational practices, transformed aircraft fleets.
The result is that airports today are much quieter places than they were, in
spite of considerable increases in air traffic. This process is continuing.
A meeting in December 1995 of the International Civil Aviation Organisation
 -which is responsible for establishing environmental standards for the
world air transport industry through its Committee on Aviation Environmental
Protection (CAEP) - is expected to recommend further tough standards on
aircraft noise and engine emissions, especially in the light of anticipated
big increases in air traffic.
The ACI and the International Air Transport Association (Iata, representing
over 220 airlines), are working through an Environmental Co-ordination Group
to develop 'joint positions' for that meeting. They are anxious to ensure
that any measures benefit the environment without involving unnecessary
costs to airports and airlines.
One possible measure is a further tightening of the rules on the
acceptability of aircraft in terms of noise and pollutant emissions. Many
airlines believe this could mean even earlier disposal than is necessary of
aircraft with many years of profitable service remaining.
Substantial research is being conducted by the aviation industry, including
airlines, airports and aircraft and engine manufacturers, to determine just
what environmental protection measures can be introduced without putting
brakes on the smooth growth of world air transport.
But the environmental record of most airports in Europe is generally good.
BAA in the UK, for example, has introduced extensive landscaping round its
airports and erected sound barriers to help shield local communities from
ground level noise. It has also helped house owners to reduce noise nuisance
by providing sound insulation grants.
BAA also publishes a detailed annual environment report, setting out its
activities, its targets and achievements. British Airways, the biggest user
of UK airports, does the same.
Throughout Europe, it is now impossible for any airport to undertake a major
expansion programme without first having to satisfy local authorities, as
well as regional and central governments, of its environmental
acceptability.
Winning acceptance for new developments can take a long time. In the UK, it
can take as much as 10 years from conception to in-service operation for
either a new terminal or runway.
In some places it can take longer. It took about 30 years to get Munich's
new airport up and running, although part of those delays were due to
financial problems.
BAA has a well-established track record in assessing the environmental
impact of ventures such as new terminals. Before submitting proposals for
such developments, it prepares comprehensive environmental assessments of
the project.
In the case of the proposed Terminal 5 at Heathrow, an environmental
statement was submitted with the application for planning permission in
February, 1993. BAA has also made meticulous preparations for the
forthcoming public planning inquiry into Terminal 5, which starts on May 16
next year and could take more than a year to complete.
Such inquiries are the best means of ensuring that everyone involved, from
the airport managements through to local residents and workers, can have a
voice in what is planned. No-one has yet devised a better way of ensuring
that environmental - and social - justice is done.

<HEAD>Seven Indicted For Allegedly Bilking $800,000 From Coin Investors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company used a videotaped appeal from
famed test pilot Chuck Yeager and the promise that profits from its
sales would fund a veterans park to lure investors into losing
$800,000 in a fake medallion scam, prosecutors said.
   The 37-count federal indictment, issued last week and unsealed
Monday, names seven individuals and two companies, Can-Am Mint and
Trading Ltd., which had offices in Bloomington and Eden Prairie,
and Vets for Vets Inc., which was incorporated in South Dakota but
shared offices with Can-Am.
   ``Many of these victims are very elderly people and a number
have lost members of their families in Vietnam,'' said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Joan Ericksen. ``They are an extremely vulnerable
group of victims.''
   Among the victims, one elderly North Dakota man sent in $81,000
and received nothing in return, Ericksen said. In all, she said,
about 45 investors from as far away as California, North Carolina
and Texas were involved.
   The indictment alleges that since March 1986 the defendants
tried to induce veterans and other investors to buy 3-ounce silver
commemorative medallions for $99 each, and promised that the
medallions would increase in value by 12 percent in a year. Only a
few of the investors received the medallions, Ericksen said.
   The investors were assured that half the profits would be used
by Vets for Vets to fund a veterans park near Mount Rushmore in
South Dakota's Black Hills, according to the indictment.
   The defendants allegedly told investors that 70 acres had been
donated for the park and that groundbreaking would take place on
Memorial Day 1987, according to the indictment. The government
claims that no land was donated or bought for the park and no park
had been built.
   Yeager, a retired Air Force general and the first pilot to break
the sound barrier, withdrew from the project after a short time,
Ericksen said.
   ``It sounds like a really good idea,'' she said. ``You sell
these medallions, build a park in South Dakota, honor these
veterans _ I can see why his agent would be interested in this.''
   ``Obviously, shortly after he got involved with these folks he
figured out what was up and he withdrew his support,'' she said. He
got involved because ``he was simply lied to,'' she said.
   A woman answering the telephone in Yeager's office in Grass
Valley, Calif., said he was out of town and not available for
comment.
   A telephone call to the Can-Am Mint and Trading Ltd. office was
answered by a recording saying the number had been temporarily
disconnected at the customer's request. A call placed to the number
given for Vets for Vets did not go through.
   ``It looked legitimate,'' said Pete Ellingson of Inver Grove
Heights, who said he agreed to buy 10 medallions at more than $80
each after doing some videotape editing and duplicating for one of
the defendants' companies.
   ``Their offices had the fanciest of furniture, the biggest of
layouts,'' he said. ``They kept calling me back and saying, `Pete,
you're going to miss the market. ... These things are really
soaring.'''
   Charged with numerous mail fraud counts are Michael J. Crosby,
39, who is in custody in California on unrelated fraud charges;
James A. Sannes, 43, of St. Paul; Jack P. Cunningham, 52, of
Burnsville; Tamara M. Kesler, 24, of Burnsville; Dale V. Peterson,
39, of Stacy; Martin L. Cheatham, 40, formerly of St. Paul; and
Phillip P. Krzyzaniak, of Irvine, Calif.
   The indictment says Crosby was the president of Can-Am, Kesler
was the company's director of administration and Sannes was
president of Vets for Vets.
   Kesler, Cunningham and Peterson appeared last Friday before a
federal magistrate and were freed after each posting 5 percent of
$50,000 bail. Ericksen said she will ask that Crosby be transferred
from California to Minnesota.
   The three remaining defendants were not in custody as of Monday,
according to federal officials.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clarence L. ``Kelly'' Johnson, creator of
Lockheed Corp.'s secret ``Skunk Works'' that created America's
first production jet fighter and a generation of spyplanes, died
Friday. He was 80.
   Johnson, who led the design of the U-2, the SR-71 Blackbird and
more than 40 other airplanes and spacecraft, died at St. Joseph
Medical Center in Burbank after a long illness, Lockheed said. The
illness was not disclosed.
   Using titanium and sleek shapes, Johnson's designs broke the
``thermal thicket,'' the high-heat problem of supersonic flight,
said Donald Lopez, a senior advisor at the National Air and Space
Museum in Washington, D.C.
   Use of titanium alloy on the SR-71 rather than standard aluminum
made flight at high speed possible despite 800-degree Fahrenheit
temperatures. The Blackbird flies at more than 2,000 mph and above
85,000 feet.
   ``The skin would glow sometimes,'' Lopez said of the Blackbirds,
recently retired by the Air Force. ``Pilots could feel the heat
coming in.''
   Johnson organized the Skunk Works in Burbank in 1943 to build
the XP-80 Shooting Star, the United States' first production jet
fighter.
   Many designs bore his mark: the P-38 Lightning in World War II,
the Constellation transports, the Hercules cargo planes, the P2V
antisubmarine patrol aircraft, the Agena spacecraft, and the F-104
Starfighter, the first production aircraft to fly at twice the
speed of sound.
   The U-2 was the first plane able to make a sustained flight
above 60,000 feet, and the YF-12 and SR-71 Blackbird remain the
fastest and highest-flying planes in the world. The Blackbird's
maximum speed and altitude remain classified.
   The Air and Space Museum saluted Johnson in its gallery of
pioneers.
   Born in Ishpeming, Mich., on Feb. 27, 1910, Johnson was the
seventh of nine children of Swedish immigrant parents. From his
father, a carpenter and bricklayer, Johnson developed a respect for
tools. According to Lockheed, he knew by the time he was 12 that he
wanted to build airplanes.
   He studied aeronautical engineering at the University of
Michigan, and worked as a consultant on the aerodynamic design of
cars that were to run in the Indianapolis 500.
   He went to work for Lockheed the same year he received his
master's degree, 1933. He went on to head the Skunk Works for 30
years.
   The secrecy of the Skunk Works is so great that even the origin
of the name is shrouded in mystery, although it apparently was
derived from Al Capp's cartoon strip, ``Li'l Abner,'' which
featured a moonshine distillery called the Skonk Works.
   Johnson retired as a senior vice president in 1975 and retired
from Lockheed's board of directors in 1980.
   Tony LeVier, the Skunk Works' former chief test pilot, described
Johnson as a stern father figure with a direct line to the
Pentagon.
   And his planes, LeVier said, ``flew like a dream.''
   ``My God,'' he said. ``They were advanced.''
   Johnson is survived by his wife Nancy, a brother and a sister.

LATE TAKEOFFS BANNED OVER TOPANGA AND CALABASAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Residents of Topanga Canyon and Calabasas have won a partial victory in a 
five-year campaign to keep noisy jets taking off from Los Angeles International 
Airport from flying over their communities. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that it has halted 
late-night flights over the two communities by airliners heading from LAX to 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Jetliner pilots will be prohibited from flying over the area between 9 p.m. and 
midnight, said FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell. There are no commuter flights 
between midnight and 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
After 9 p.m., planes taking off from LAX are being required to fly farther west 
over the Pacific Ocean to climb in altitude before turning north. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Aircraft 
</P>
<P>
As many as 70 jetliners a day have been flying over Topanga and Calabasas on a 
takeoff path known as "Gorman Five." 
</P>
<P>
The new procedures went into effect over the weekend, O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
The change in takeoffs represents the FAA's first acknowledgment that jet noise 
is a problem for residents of the two communities at the southwestern edge of 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, FAA officials brushed aside complaints by comparing jet noise over 
the area with the sound of birds, dogs, cars and wind. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the FAA removed an LAX administrator assigned to investigate 
noise complaints who had criticized an FAA report that concluded that "there is 
no appreciable difference between the aircraft noise and ambient noise for the 
area." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Report Conclusions 
</P>
<P>
The report stated that "ambient noise (bird/dogs/cars/wind)" registered at 65 
to 80 decibels. Departing jets peaked in the 50- to 65-decibel range, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
That prompted angry community leaders to seek help from Rep. Anthony C. 
Beilenson (D-Tarzana), who called for a formal FAA investigation into the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Glaser, president of the Topanga Town Council and one of the most 
persistent critics of the over-the-canyon takeoffs, credited Beilenson's 
intervention with prompting the ban. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fantastic, just wonderful. We're already noticing a difference," Glaser 
said. "We understand the airlines don't like it and it was difficult to do, but 
we feel it's a good first step. Congressman Beilenson has taken a good, strong 
position." 
</P>
<P>
The takeoff change was announced by Jeffrey Thorstenson, manager of the FAA's 
air space and procedures branch. 
</P>
<P>
He declined further comment Wednesday, however, and O'Donnell said he did not 
know how many nighttime flights were affected. 
</P>
<P>
O'Donnell said he did not know if it is possible to route other Gorman Five 
takeoffs farther west to avoid Topanga and Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can safely reroute traffic without impeding safety, we most certainly 
would do that," O'Donnell said. "Noise abatement is an important issue with the 
FAA. Until further notice, they will be directed to a Ventura departure." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hope Change Is Permanent 
</P>
<P>
Opponents of the noise said Wednesday that they hope the change is permanent. 
</P>
<P>
Virginia Hatfield, a field representative for Beilenson, said her office in 
December appealed to FAA officials in Washington for a 60-day test period to 
study the noise situation. 
</P>
<P>
She said her office has not received official notification from the FAA of the 
takeoff ban. 
</P>
<P>
But blissful nighttime quiet the past few days has been notification enough for 
such homeowners as Margaret Rawls of Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
"We can sleep now. It's a definite improvement," said Rawls, who has fought the 
jet noise since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"There weren't that many jets flying over late at night. But those that did 
were enough to wake you up."

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Smelling salts and artificial intelligence are
just a couple of things researchers are willing to try in an
attempt to stem blackouts among military pilots traveling faster
than sound.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By DOUG FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the nation's military jet fighter
pilots have been breaking the sound barrier and evading supersonic
missiles, a deadly invader has crept into the cockpit.
   It strikes when they are at the top of their performance, maybe
in the middle of a dogfight, pulling turns that would make the
roughest roller coaster seem like a carriage ride in the park.
   Then they lose to GLOC (pronounced G-lock), gravity-induced loss
of consciousness.
   It begins as a pilot starts to feel the crushing weight from a
sharp turn, or maybe a dive. In a modern fighter such as the F-16,
maneuvers can lead to forces of 9 Gs, nine times the force of
gravity.
   The blood becomes so heavy the heart can't pump it; it drains
from the brain. Things go gray; the pilot may suffer tunnel vision.
Then black.
   ``It's almost always fatal,'' says Maj. Rocky Hill of the Air
Force Inspection and Safety Center at Norton Air Force Base, Calif.
   He says there have been at least 13 GLOC crashes since 1982, all
but one fatal.
   ``We got so smart on it so fast and started running people
through the centrifuge (for training), and we said this is a real
success story. But it never really goes away,'' Hill said during a
seminar on prevention at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio.
   It becomes worse with a new generation of planes, the Air
Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter and the Navy's Advanced Tactical
Aircraft, planned for the next decade with more mind-numbing
capabilities.
   Pilots already are overloaded with computer screens, switches,
gauges and dials, and GLOC is just one more worry.
   ``The cockpit is becoming an increasingly hostile area to the
pilot,'' Hill says.
   Robert E. van Patten, leader of GLOC research at the Armstrong
Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson, says
Germans put meters in their Ju-88 dive bombers in World War II to
pull the plane out at low altitudes if the pilot lost consciousness.
   ``All in all, we aren't that far ahead,'' van Patten says.
   Hill says GLOC gained priority again about four years ago when
video cameras were put in cockpits. They captured pilots coming
close to GLOC.
   Susceptible pilots usually have many hours of flying time, but
relatively few hours in very-high performance aircraft. They tend
to be middle-aged and have had little training on the centrifuge,
Hill says.
   ``These profiles very accurately describe our Air Force Reserve
and Air National Guard units that have converted to the F-16,''
Hill says.
   Fatigue also is a big factor, researchers say, which could pose
problems for a pilot flying multiple missions in wartime.
   Beginning in August, the Air Force plans to train about 2,500
pilots per year _ fledglings and veterans _ on a new centrifuge at
Holloman Air Force Base, N.M.
   Part of the training involves exercises that push the blood back
up.
   So does the G-suit, a corset-like garment inflated to keep blood
from pooling in the legs. Soon to come is positive-pressure
breathing that forces air into the lungs and forces a pilot to
exhale.
   But even if a pilot does recover from GLOC, it can take up to
two minutes to regain his bearings. So scientists are looking at
ways to tell the airplane's computer that the pilot is unconscious
so the plane can briefly fly itself to safety.
   McDonnell Aircraft Co. says it is near a system that keys on a
pilot's breathing and voice patterns, combined with a computer
memory of recent sharp maneuvers in the plane, to tell when a pilot
is at GLOC risk.
   Van Patten's group is trying more complicated sensors, possibly
in helmets, that would measure head slump, eye blink, blood
pressure, pulse in head arteries and even the grip on the stick.
Those researchers want to use more extensive artificial
intelligence, including neural networks _ computers based on the
architecture of the brain _ to make more accurate judgments.
   A pilot might someday put a computer disc with his own
characteristics on board to tell the computer how to program the
system exactly for him, van Patten says.
   To revive a pilot, researchers are studying ways to pulsate the
G-suit, administering small amounts of carbon dioxide which dilates
blood vessels and raises blood pressure.
   ``Perhaps even plain old smelling salts,'' says van
Patten.``They have a long and honorable history.''
   But most of all, a recent study shows, pilots want a system that
they won't have to attach each time they get into a cockpit and
that they can override if it starts to malfunction.
   Van Patten estimates a simple prototype system could be built
for $500,000, and could be ready to fly by 1993 with another $3
million. But in the current budget climate, he says, money is hard
to come by.

but at least 94 survived, authorities said.
   ``I saw it take off and I knew something was wrong,'' said Lon
Might, an airport employee.
   Passengers in a commuter plane arriving at the airport spotted
the Boeing 727 struggling to get airborne and shouted encouragement
to the pilot.
   ``We were cheering this guy to get the plane off the ground,''
said Gene Metzig. ``It was very emotional.''
   Said Michelle Christensen, 25, a Dallas real estate agent aboard
Flight 1141: ``The minute we took off the ground I knew we were
going to crash.''
   From an office building, Edward Leb looked out and noticed the
aircraft was not flying in a normal position, that it was almost
level with the ground and its nose barely was up.
   ``And then it just fell straight down. It fell like a pancake on
its big belly, the back end lower than the front end,'' Leb said.
   At an airport toll booth, Mary Centron, 47, of Hurst, who
witnessed a Delta Air Lines crash here three years ago, knew at
once the plane was flying ``too damn low to be taking off.''
   Sobbing, nauseated and recalling the previous tragedy, in which
137 died, she said: ``The tail disappeared first, and next the nose
disappeared behind a hill, and then there was a humongous fireball.
... I didn't think anybody had made it.''
   Aboard the craft, en route from Jackson, Miss., to Salt Lake
City via Dallas, passenger Peter Wright heard a ``banging noise''
under the carriage and then someone exclaim: ``We're not going to
make it!''
   Within moments of its 9 a.m. takeoff, Flight 1141 dropped like a
wounded bird from the cloudless sky, skidded off the runway,
bounced into a field of waist-high prairie grass and broke apart in
flames, smoke and debris.
   The crash ripped off one wing and two engines, tore three gaping
holes in the fuselage and left the crippled aircraft with its tail
dangling and its nose twisted grotesquely to one side.
   ``It looks like a beached and dying bottlenosed dolphin,'' said
a photographer. Others said it resembled a giant, stricken goose.
   No one could say with certainty what happened, only that the
death toll could have been staggering. Authorities indicated most
of the deaths were caused by burns and smoke inhalation and that
most of the injuries were cuts, scrapes and bruises.
   ``We feel lucky there were only 13 victims,'' said Dr. Nizam
Peerwani, the Tarrant County medical examiner. ``Initially we were
told there would be 60 bodies, so we were prepared for the worst.''
   Jim Hartman, Department of Public Safety officer at the airport,
called it ``incredible'' that so many survived. In fact, early
reports from the control tower indicated the crash was
``non-survivable.''
   Said Norman Newcity, 36, a Georgia businessman hospitalized with
a broken heel: ``It was just like a roller coaster ride with
everything coming apart, everything flying apart.''
   ``We were going down the runway and the sound of the engine
changed,'' said Melissa Lewis, 24, a graduate student at
Mississippi State University. ``There was a different sound.''
   Other passengers said they heard knocking noises or popping
sounds or loud thumps, and Dale Patterson, 36, of Plano, thought it
``sounded like it blew a tire.''
   But Dan Walker, a 40-year-old Dallas veterinarian, said, ``There
was no audible explosion before the crash.'' He said the plane did
encounter ``turbulence'' before it veered out of control and
insisted that the pilot did an excellent job of ``bringing it down
on its belly.''
   Walker suffered a fractured rib but was treated and released.
Two Dallas-area friends with him on a planned fishing excursion to
Montana were hospitalized with more serious injuries.
   Austin attorney Rick Arnett, seated in a plane on the ground,
said he and other passengers saw the wobbly Delta jetliner through
their windows and were hollering: ``Get up! Get up!''
   But it was not to be.

underwater?
   The late-night comedian is considering taping a segment of his
television show at the Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, but the tourist
attraction isn't sure it can accommodate Letterman's request.
   ``My impression is they want to film a show underwater,'' said
aquarium spokesman George Donnelly. ``We would love to try to do
something about it. But we don't know if we can work out the
logistics of it.''
   Donnelly said representatives for the show called the non-profit
aquarium three weeks ago to ask about filming among the fishtanks.
   ``To be honest with you, I thought it was a crank call,'' said
Donnelly, who said he occasionally watches ``Late Night with David
Letterman'' on NBC.
   Donnelly said two writers inspected the aquarium with the
intention of filming in November or December, but that he hasn't
heard anything else. He said other aquariums also were being looked

   Saying, ``I don't support cop killers,''
singer Willie Nelson expressed disappointment in a decision by
Austin police not to provide security for a benefit concert next
month.
   Helping Our Brother Out, or HOBO, an organization planning the
Nov. 11 concert in Austin, lined up Ranger security after the
Austin Police Association voted two weeks ago not to provide it,
said HOBO spokeswoman Marion Morris.
   Police officers protested Nelson's participation in a concert
last year to raise defense money for American Indian activist
Leonard Peltier, serving two life sentences for the 1975 murder of
two FBI agents.
   Nelson said in a phone interview he performed at the Peltier
benefit ``not to get this man out of prison but to get money for
lawyers'' who could bring to light withheld information about the
case.
   ``I don't support cop killers. I don't support Indian killers. I
don't support any kind of killers. I just believe this particular
issue of Leonard Peltier, there's more than meets the eye,'' Nelson
said.
   HOBO on Wednesday received a donation of $10,000 from Provident
Development Co. of Austin for concert expenses. HOBO is a
non-profit organization supported by churches and businesses that
works to improve the plight of Austin's homeless.

   The first man to break the sound barrier,
retired Air Force Gen. Chuck Yeager, says he was duped into
promoting a theme park for military veterans that was to be built
in western South Dakota.
   Dressed in cowboy boots, jeans and a windbreaker, Yeager
testified Wednesday in U.S. District Court at the trial of four men
accused of bilking investors and creditors out of more than
$800,000.
   Yeager, 65, who flew faster than the speed of sound in 1947 and
who continues to work as a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base in
California, said after testifying, ``When some guy uses you, it
ticks you off.''
   Yeager said he was asked in 1986 by defendant Michael Crosby to
film a commercial promoting the veterans park. The money for the
park was to have been raised through the sale of commemorative
medallions and contributions.
   Officials at Can-Am Mint and Trading Ltd. said they would sell 1
million commemorative coins that were guaranteed to appreciate in
value, but they sold about 5,900 coins for between $80 and $99 to
412 investors. The investors claim they never received the coins.

   A candidate's attempt to raise money
and publicity in a state Senate race by having retired Lt. Col
Oliver L. North speak at a dinner may wind up costing the candidate
$4,000.
   Republican Joseph F. Roberts had hoped North's speech here
Thursday night would help him in his fight to unseat Democratic
state Sen. John B. Larson.
   ``It's going to be the most expensive plate dinner I've ever
gone to,'' said Roberts, owner of Roberts Farm and Country Store.
   North's speaking fee is $25,000 and Roberts also had to pay for
the banquet hall and other expenses. He said he had expected as
many as 300 people to buy tickets at $175 apiece. But only 140
tickets had been sold by late Wednesday.
   Although Roberts guessed it would cost him $4,000 from his
pocket, he said doesn't regret the idea because it helps identify
him and supports North's legal fight.
   North and three others are charged with conspiracy to divert
proceeds of U.S. arms sales to Iran for aid for the Nicaraguan
Contras at a time when Congress banned U.S. military aid to the
rebels.

   The Republican presidential campaign
has pulled out heavy artillery in the form of retired U.S. Air
Force Gen. Chuck Yeager to warn Texans that ``liberal Democrats''
will take away jobs from the state's defense industry.
   In a television advertisement airing this week in Texas, Yeager
warns that the 300,000 Texas jobs related to the defense industry
could be jeopardized by Democrats who advocate cuts in defense
spending.
   But Yeager, the first man to break the sound barrier, has worked

California, a competitor of General Dynamics Corp. The Fort Worth
Division of General Dynamics is one of the largest defense
employers in the state, with 27,000 workers.
   Republican National Committee spokesman Kathryn Murray said she
wasn't aware that Yeager was a consultant to Northrop but that it
was irrelevant.
   ``The point of the ad is that General Yeager has first-hand
knowledge of what it takes to have a strong defense and he believes
the policies of the Republicans are more in sync with making that
happen,'' she said. ``He speaks from the heart about the defense of
the nation.''

Article Type:CSO 

  [Text] About forty years ago, an ingenious contraption 
nicknamed ``the flying bedstead'' took to the air at a Rolls 
Royce test facility in the United Kingdom. The name was an apt 
description of an ungainly flying machine heralded as a 
breakthrough in aviation. What made the craft unusual was that 
it could take off and land vertically using downward-facing jet 
nozzles at its four corners. Once aloft, the nozzles could 
rotate to propel it forward. 
  The flying bedstead was the prototype for vertical takeoff 
and landing (VTOL) jet aircraft. The appeal of VTOLs was that 
they would not need runways; theoretically, they could take off 
and land in city centers but fly like conventional jets once 
airborne, carrying the same loads at the same speeds. 



  Over the next 20 years, about thirty different VTOL designs 
were developed and tested. Some used jet engines, while others 
used rotors that could swivel from a horizontal position for 
lift to the vertical for flight. Nearly all the test flights 
ended in disaster. Only one design found practical use--the 
Harrier jump-jet fighter used by the Royal Air Force and the 
U.S. Navy. 
  Not surprisingly, most VTOLs came to grief at takeoff or 
landing, the moments of greatest risk for any aircraft. In a 
normal jet aircraft, aerodynamic lift provided by the wings 
gives a degree of stability as a plane takes off or cruises to 
land. In a VTOL, this type of lift is nonexistent: only the 
vertical thrust from the jets keeps the plane aloft and at the 
correct attitude. The problems lie largely in finely controlling 
the blasts from the downward-facing jets. Even slight gusts of 
wind or variations in thrust from the engines could unbalance 
the craft as it sat on ``pillars'' of air. When this happened, 
the pilot had only seconds to restore the jet's equilibrium 
before crashing. 
  Technological strides over the last two decades have changed 
the outlook for VTOLs, which now might begin to fulfill their 
original promise and meet modern safety standards for civil 
aviation. VTOLs are being reexamined in several countries, 
including several European nations and the United States. In 
Japan, a revolutionary VTOL design from the National Aerospace 
Laboratory (NAL) is now ready for implementation. 
  Progress in three key areas of technology has given VTOLs 
their second chance, according to Dr. Masanori Endoh, who leads 
the NAL team. ``Microelectronics now allow us to incorporate 
very sophisticatedcontrols into the designs, something that 
wasn't possible until recently,'' he explained. ``The 
development of very lightweight composite materials also helps. 
Since a VTOL takes off using engine thrust and not aerodynamic 
wing lift, it is essential for the plane to be as light as 
possible.'' The kinds of materials he is referring to include 
both lightweight, carbon-reinforced plastics and new types of 
ceramics. 
  The third advance is the development of new kinds of 
engines. 
``VTOLs of the fifties were extremely noisy,'' says Dr. Endoh. 
``This alone would be a fatal defect today, because no one would 
tolerate such noisy jets at civilian airports, let alone in city 
centers.'' Dr. Endoh's team has designed a new engine that is 
high-powered, lightweight, and creates no more noise than a 
light helicopter. The new engine is the key innovation in NAL's 
new VTOL design. 
  The aircraft would fly using a unique system of lift and 
cruise fans powered by a trio of rear-mounted jet turbines. 
High-pressure air from these three engines would be piped to 
twin seven-foot cruise fans. At the center of each fan, a 
combustor would ignite a mixture of high-pressure air and fuel. 
The expanding gases would spin a turbine linked to the fan, 
producing 24,000 pounds of thrust a side. 
  During vertical takeoff and landing, high-pressure air would 
be channeled to three eight-foot, 200-blade, one-piece rotors 
that are encased within each wing and shielded by movable 
shutters. Collectively, the six rotors, with their own 
combustors, would generate over 130,000 pounds of thrust. 
  Surprisingly, the lift fans are not noisy. ``Because of 
their 
size their rotation speed is very low, which reduces the 
noise,'' says Endoh. ``The one-piece design also means that the 
sound the fans produce is higher-pitched than in regular rotors, 
where the blades are individually fitted. Our aircraft will be 
quieter than a conventional helicopter!'' 
  As the craft rises, the pilot gradually redirects the 
high-pressure air from the lift to the cruise fans, 
simultaneously closing the shutters in the wings. This increases 
the wings' effective surface area, boosting the aerodynamic 
lift. Should one or more of the lift fans cease working, the 
plane should remain stable as long as at least one fan on each 
side functions. Should all fail, the plane can still land on a 
runway like a conventional airliner. 
  NAL's aircraft isn't on the tarmac just yet. Engine tests 
are 
due this year, but the pace of progress will depend on new 
government funding. Computer simulations and wind-tunnel tests 
using models indicate the plane will fulfill the designer's 
expectations. In Dr. Endoh's most optimistic scenario, the first 
test flights could be taking place around the end of the decade, 
and commercial flights could start early in the next century. If 
all goes well, the new VTOL could then be ferrying over a 
hundred commuters a trip to and from city centers, taking off 
and landing at ``vertports'' no bigger than 200 square meters. 
  Dr. Endoh calculates ticket prices on his VTOL would be 
about 
30 percent higher than on a conventional airliner. He doesn't 
think this will prove a problem, since passengers will save the 
time and expense of lengthy journeys to out-of-town airports. 
``In the past, people have been willing to pay more for easier 
and swifter journeys. The extra cost of traveling by bullet 
train compared with regular trains has not deterred travelers, 
and I think the same will prove true for VTOLs,'' he explains. 
  For urban planners, the VTOL could also prove a boon. The 
small size of vertports makes them easy and inexpensive to 
build. Any city center tract of land, or even the space over 
rail tracks, could be utilized.New vertports could go from the 
planning stage to operational status within a year--very fast 
when compared with the decades it takes to plan and build 
costlier conventional airports. According to Dr. Endoh, VTOLs 
should be ready to put the problems of civil aviation to bed, 
about fifty years after that first flying bedstead took to the 
air.

FT  10 JUN 94 / Technology: Flights of fancy put safety first - Increasingly
sophisticated aircraft simulators are becoming more like the real thing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<TEXT>
Flying conditions around Seattle were far from ideal on the last day of May.
The area was blanketed with snow and a strong wind was gusting as the pilot
lined up his Boeing 777 for a tricky landing at the aircraft maker's
airfield on the outskirts of the city.
The aircraft descended steadily towards the parallel beads of runway lights
blinking in the distance. But just before touchdown, green-grey patches of
ice became visible on the tarmac. Some of the aircraft's tyres failed to
grip the surface. The nose lurched from side to side as the pilot struggled
to bring the aircraft to an unsteady stop.
This story has some obvious flaws. The chances of finding snow in Seattle on
May 31 are almost zero. What is more, the twin-engined Boeing 777 has yet to
fly. Its maiden flight is expected to take place within the next few days,
with customer deliveries due to start only in May 1995. But Boeing's
test-pilots have been notching up flying hours on the 777 for the past six
months thanks to a simulator at CAE Electronics' factory in Montreal.
Without leaving the ground, the pilots have flown in and out of airports
around the world, experiencing the sights, sounds and turbulence of
snowstorms, thunderstorms, air pockets and almost every other flying
condition.
CAE Electronics, a division of CAE of Toronto, claims a 50 per cent share of
the world market for aircraft simulators, including 10 of the 13 orders
placed so far for Boeing 777 devices. The other three 777 orders have gone
to CAE's main rival, Rediffusion, a UK-based division of Thomson, the French
electronics group.
Like the aircraft they reproduce, simulators have grown increasingly
sophisticated. Pilots' experience on a simulator now helps decide which
systems and instruments are installed in a new aircraft. 'We fly our
simulators before Boeing flies its planes,' says Adrian Gale, CAE
Electronics' marketing director. 'We'll pick up bugs on an avionics sweep
before Boeing does.'
But the technological advances have one drawback: as the simulator
experience gets closer to the real thing, so does its price. One of CAE's
full-flight simulators currently costs about CDollars 15m (Pounds 7.2m) to
Dollars 20m.
As a result, airlines are turning to simplified versions, known as flight
training devices (FTDs). These recreate specific parts of an aircraft's
system without the frills and thrills of a real flight. For instance,
maintenance system trainers, comprising little more than two chairs, two
computer screens and a console, reproduce only those instruments needed for
engineers to diagnose an aircraft's inner workings from the cockpit.
Full-flight simulators, which look like windowless space capsules, do much
more than reproduce an aircraft's cockpit and instruments.
Hydraulically-powered struts which form the base of the simulator can propel
the bulbous module in six directions, including a pitch and roll of up to
30'.
Simulator makers go to extraordinary lengths to make flights on their
machines as close to the real thing as possible. One of CAE's helicopter
simulators is fitted with a shaking pilot's seat as well as the normal
banking, pitching and rolling mechanisms. By pumping air into cushions
behind and underneath a fighter pilot's seat, CAE mimics the G-forces felt
in steep climbs and tight turns. Take-offs and landings feature appropriate
real-time bumps and engine sounds.
The biggest advance in recent years, however, has been in the
computer-generated visual systems which project images of airports,
landmarks, scenery and weather conditions likely to be encountered during a
flight.
The latest version of CAE's Maxvue visual system, installed in the 777, has
five separate channels giving a total horizontal field of vision of 210' and
a vertical field of 40'. The pilot and co-pilot can thus see true-to-life
images out of all the cockpit windows. When taxiing, for instance, they can
see another aircraft approaching from the side. The vertical view allows
them to see slightly above and below the plane, which is especially useful
in banking manoeuvres. CAE has fitted its helicopter simulators with two
extra channels to give a straight-down view.
CAE has developed visual-system databases for almost 40 airports around the
world. Each one, taking up 5 gigabytes of disk storage, reproduces the
topography and landmarks within a 15-mile radius of the airport and, in much
greater detail, its runways and terminal buildings.
The database is compiled from digitised satellite and aerial photos and
maps. These are augmented with on-the-spot observations by the software
experts who design the system and suggestions from the pilots who will use
it. Few details have been forgotten. The wind sock at the end of the runway
in Hong Kong billows in the same direction as the wind registered on the
cockpit instruments. The rotors of a hovering helicopter churn up the sea
below.
But computer-generated scenery has its limitations. CAE has yet to master
three-dimensional imaging, and the sharpness of the pictures does not match
the human eye. Although the number of polygons (or shapes) which can be
fitted on each channel has jumped from 1,000 to about 5,500 in the past
three or four years, this is still not enough to cover every detail.
Customers thus have to make choices. The criterion, often a subjective one,
is what is of most importance to the pilot. As the Boeing 777 descends over
Seattle, the city's Space Needle tower and the main highways are clearly
visible from the cockpit. But there are no cars on the roads. The scene may
be surreal, but it is a comforting reminder that no matter how bad the
weather conditions outside, this flight will be landing safely.

   The pilot zoomed low between
the pink, craggy peaks of the Sheep Mountains, suddenly twisting
his F-16 Falcon vertically into the desert sky before diving on the
target, a railroad bridge.
   Capt. Kevin ``Omar'' Bradley's plane plunged toward the bridge
as he pushed his ``pickle'' button, simulating bombs away. Bradley
pointed the Falcon's nose up, climbed radically and turned,
eliciting groans from his reporter passenger as the ``Gs''
increased to seven times the force of gravity.
   The lean, 30-year-old pilot from Binghamton, N.Y., didn't seem
bothered. ``We have to do a lot of things to keep in condition,''
he said.
   Bradley pushed the fighter past Mach 1, through the sound
barrier, and with a sonic boom for salute, headed back toward the
Tactical Fighter Weapons Center at Nellis Air Force Base, known in
the Tactical Air Command as ``The Home of the Fighter Pilot.''
   Despite improved superpower relations, with hopes high for
general world peace, professional warriors are still working to
keep a combat edge. ``Gunsmoke'' a biennial competition, decides
the ``best of the best'' in Air Force precision gunnery and bombing.
   ``Peace is breaking out all over, so why maintain the edge?''
asked Maj. Gen. Billy McCoy, a 6-foot-4 Texan who flew 223 missions
in Vietnam and commands the fighter training center at Nellis.
   ``Every kid (competing in Gunsmoke) will tell you today that we
have always dickered best from a position of strength. ... We ought
to have a pair of Russian generals out here. I'd host 'em for the
whole two weeks,'' said McCoy.
   As Bradley soared away from the target area in his fighter, a
formation of A-10 Thunderbolt pilots from the Connecticut Air
National Guard swept by, completing bombing and strafing runs that
were part of the two-week shooting competition, which ends Saturday.
   The Connecticut fliers are joined by guard units from Terre
Haute, Ind., Sioux City, Iowa, and Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M.,
and by reserve units from Luke Air Force Base, Ariz., Grissom Air
Force Base, Ind., and Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas.
   They are competing against regular Air Force units from as far
away as Japan, Alaska, the Philippines and West Germany.
   The fliers at Nellis already have won competitions in their home
units and are vying to be ``Top Guns,'' an Air Force-wide honor
held for two years.
   Maj. Patrick Hoy of Falls City, Neb., who was ``Top Gun'' in his
A-10 Thunderbolt two years ago, said, ``I don't think any rational
individual would wish to be at war, but it can be difficult being a
warrior when peace is breaking out.
   ``The biggest problem the U.S. has to deal with when we are not
in conflict is complacency. ... If you have a garden and you leave
it for a few days, the weeds begin to grow.''
   During competition, Capt. Angus Simpson, an A-10 pilot from
Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, put all 200 rounds in the white
target panel sitting on the arid wasteland that is fighter pilot
heaven north of Las Vegas. It was the first such perfect score,
said Capt. Tom Christie, an Air Force spokesman.
   For Bradley, becoming a fighter pilot was a childhood dream
nurtured by an uncle who took him to air shows. He started flying
single-engine propeller planes when he was 17. Now, piloting the
super-sophisticated F-16 over the Sheep Mountains, he is at the top
end of the Air Force dream sheet.
   ``For me, there is nothing else,'' Bradley said. ``Everything
else is a zero. My family has a business. I had no aptitude
whatsoever for it. The only thing for me was flying.''
   The flier, nicknamed ``Omar'' for the World War II general,
faces the possibility he will never fire a shot in anger.
   ``The slogan for tactical aviation is `Readiness is our
profession,''' he said. ``The military needs to detach itself from
the emotions'' about hopes for relaxed tension between the
superpowers.
   Without the ordeal of combat to provide the ultimate warrior's
test, the fliers use competitions such as ``Gunsmoke,'' the biggest
of its kind, to maintain their adrenaline levels.
   ``Next to my marriage and the birth of my children, it was the
most exciting moment of my life to be able to sit back in a moment
of quiet reflection and realize that on that day, I was the best,''
Hoy said.

<P>
A scene from the year 2000: 
</P>
<P>
 The strange-looking craft sits on a slab the size of a small parking lot as 
passengers file out of the adjacent Amtrak station in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 When all 75 are aboard, the 6,000-horsepower engines on each wing tip begin 
driving a pair of propellers, 38 feet in diameter and pointed straight up. 
</P>
<P>
 The giant blades spin faster and faster, and the craft slowly lifts like a 
helicopter until it hangs in the sky above the vertiport. Then the engine pods 
smoothly rotate 90 degrees, aiming the propellers forward like those on a 
fixed-wing plane, and the craft begins picking up horizontal speed. In less 
than a minute, it is flying north at 300 miles an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety minutes later, the "Sacramento Shuttle" completes its flight as it 
settles to the ground at another downtown vertiport, this one only blocks from 
the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
That futuristic scene may seem farfetched. 
</P>
<P>
But it should not, because the prototype of an aircraft that blends the speed 
of an airplane with the agility of a helicopter exists today in the Marine 
Corps' V-22 Osprey. And although the so-called tiltrotor was designed to 
shuttle combat troops rather than commuters, transportation experts predict 
that it could one day revolutionize commercial air travel, particularly in 
packed population centers along the East and West coasts. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the solutions to air travel and crowded airports and skies in Southern 
California are to be found in new technology, like the tiltrotor," said Gary L. 
Proctor, a longtime member of the Orange County Airport Commission. "I think 
the bottom line has to be technology. There is just no land to build new 
airports. There is less and less open space." 
</P>
<P>
The V-22 flew for the first time last March at Bell Helicopter Textron's Flight 
Research Center in Arlington, Tex. It stayed aloft for 15 minutes as scheduled, 
and spectators marveled at its stability and quietness. Built jointly by Bell 
and Boeing Helicopters, it is designed to go as fast as 350 m.p.h., as high as 
30,000 feet and as far as 600 miles -- fully loaded -- without refueling. 
</P>
<P>
But while the flight in March was hailed as a significant step for aviation, 
the tiltrotor's development -- already eight months behind schedule -- was 
recently thrown into doubt. In a belt-tightening move, Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney this spring cut it from the proposed 1990 defense budget. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the House Armed Services Committee argued for two days before 
restoring $157 million for the tiltrotor by taking money from the B-2 stealth 
bomber program. But the $295-billion defense appropriations package must now be 
approved by the full House, where debate is tentatively set to begin July 24. 
</P>
<P>
To get the first half-dozen training and testing craft from drawing board to 
runway, the government already has spent nearly $1.8 billion. But the program 
calls for spending about $26 billion more for 657 tiltrotors, of which 552 
would go to the Marines. Eventually, each craft is expected to carry a price 
tag of between $20 million and $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the new vehicle gains support in Congress, said John Zuk, chief of civil 
technology at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., the cut 
could prove fatal to the civilian -- as well as military -- tiltrotor program. 
</P>
<P>
"In the United States, nearly all revolutionary aircraft have been developed by 
the military," said Zuk, who has been involved in the non-military research and 
development of tiltrotor technology for 11 years. "Unlike most other countries, 
the United States does not subsidize development by commercial aircraft 
manufacturers. I'm certainly not advocating subsidies, but research and 
development of aircraft is very expensive." 
</P>
<P>
Zuk said the helicopter, the jet engine and jet transports were all developed 
by the military, and some experts question whether they would now be in use if 
the research and testing had not been publicly underwritten. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when America is struggling to improve its balance of trade, Zuk said, 
it would be "a shame" if the United States loses its edge in tiltrotor 
development or has to share the technology with another country. 
</P>
<P>
Bell President Leonard M. Horner told aerospace writers at the Paris Air Show 
recently that he would get the V-22 built even if he had to go to France for 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Noise Level Lower 
</P>
<P>
"The Wright brothers came here after they couldn't sell their airplane in the 
United States and started the whole thing. People forget that," Horner said at 
the briefing at Paris' Le Bourget Airport. But Horner told reporters that he 
was moderately optimistic that Congress would put the tiltrotor program back in 
the budget. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation engineers contend that the V-22 has much less noise impact than 
conventional military helicopters because most of its sounds can be confined to 
its takeoff and landing zones. When flying in its airplane mode, the craft is 
said to be quieter than the quietest commercial airliner in service today. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd hardly be able to hear it when it is flying forward. It kind of 
whispers," said Marine Corps Maj. Gen. Donald E. P. Miller, commanding general 
of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, which includes units at El Toro, Tustin and 
Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
For the Marines, the Osprey was designed to carry 24 combat-equipped troops. 
Had it been available in 1980, said Brig. Gen. Harry Blot, the Marines' V-22 
project manager, the craft might have altered the course of history: It is 
ideal for missions such as the attempt to rescue American hostages from Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the eight conventional helicopters used in that unsuccessful operation 
broke down and another crashed into a fixed-wing plane at a secret refueling 
point outside Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
"This is almost like it was made for Iran," Blot said, "as if somebody went out 
and said, 'Gee, what would I build to do Iran again?' " 
</P>
<P>
Which is exactly why the Air Force wants to buy 55 of them, said Air Force Lt. 
Col. John Creveling of the U.S. Special Operations Command. He said the V-22 
was the top priority for the joint military command because it needed an 
aircraft that could take off vertically and fly at high speed for special 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Could Reduce Traffic 
</P>
<P>
"That is what we do for a living," Creveling said, adding that the Osprey can 
fly higher, faster and farther than any military helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
Some civilian agencies, including the California Division of Aeronautics -- 
part of the State Department of Transportation -- and the Port Authority of New 
York and New Jersey, are looking at the Osprey and tiltrotor technology as a 
way of dealing with future congestion in the air and on the ground. Rather than 
moving all commercial airline passengers from centrally located airports, a 
smaller network of four-acre vertiports could be built to shuttle passengers 
from city to city or within a city. 
</P>
<P>
Travelers could also be transported by tiltrotor craft to larger airports for 
long-distance flights, thus reducing some of the vehicle traffic at main 
airports such as Los Angeles International and John Wayne in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County Airport Commissioner Proctor, a private pilot, said the tiltrotor 
could succeed where the helicopter failed as a popular mode of transportation 
because it will be able to carry more people at higher speeds. 
</P>
<P>
Passengers also may feel more at ease while flying because the craft does not 
have to tilt forward to gain speed as a helicopter does. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the flying public will perceive this more as an airplane than a 
helicopter," said Ron Reber, manager of Bell Helicopter's tiltrotor program. 
"They will feel a little bit safer. I hate to say that in a negative way, but 
people see a helicopter, and it doesn't look like it will fly." 
</P>
<P>
In a study partially financed by the Transportation Department and the Federal 
Aviation Administration, officials in New York and New Jersey were told that, 
for a tiltrotor to be put into service in the Northeast Corridor, it must be 
"cost-effective, reliable and attractive to passengers." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Search for New Site 
</P>
<P>
"I think if the tiltrotor is cost-effective, it will have a place in commercial 
air travel in the United States," said USAir pilot Capt. Skip Budny of Clinton, 
Pa., a former military helicopter pilot who is interested in the tiltrotor 
concept. He said the seat-per-mile cost of a tiltrotor flying from a downtown 
location in one city to a downtown location in another will have to be low 
enough to be competitive with flights from one big regional airport to another. 
</P>
<P>
The Board of Supervisors in Orange County has appointed a committee to search 
for a new airport site that could relieve the growing congestion at John Wayne 
Airport. The Airport Site Coalition has until October to come up with a 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
For residents, it is often an emotional subject, according to one county 
official who said: "Airports are much like prisons; everyone wants them but not 
in their neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
V-22 
</P>
<P>
The V-22 Osprey, developed by Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing Helicopter, is 
a tilt-rotor craft that takes off and lands like a helicopter but flies 
horizontally like an airplane at up to 350 mph. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Commercial and Civilian Use 
</P>
<P>
Although the craft was developed for the Marine Corps, its use in commercial 
aviation could drastically reduce the amount of land required for new airports, 
especially in urban areas where open space is scarce. Building tops could be a 
common landing spot for commuters. The craft takes off like a helicopter and 
virtually turns into an airplane within a matter of seconds.

   Navy Capt. Dick Richards,
Discovery's commander, is traveling into space for the second time
in a little more than a year.
   The former test pilot made his first shuttle flight August 1989
on a secret Defense Department mission.
   Richards, 44, said before the flight that he believed a
successful mission would help people forget about NASA's recent
troubles, which include hydrogen leaks aboard the Atlantis and
Columbia space shuttles.
   ``Right now, we don't look so good,'' he said.
   But he denied that NASA's recent misfortunes have put additional
pressure on his crew or the launch team at Cape Canaveral, Fla., to
get a space shuttle into orbit.
   ``They treat us like we're fragile commodities down there,'' he
said, adding he believes the space agency has been quite
conservative in handling mechanical problems in the post-Challenger
era.
   Richards was born in Key West, Fla., but grew up in St. Louis
where he graduated from Riverview Gardens High School. He earned a
bachelor's degree in chemical engineering from the University of
Missouri and a master's degree in aeronautical systems from the
University of West Florida.
   After earning his bachelor's degree, he joined the Navy. He
became a naval aviator and later went to the U.S. Navy test pilot
school.
   Richards served as a project test pilot for development work on
automatic carrier landing systems for F-4 and A-7 aircraft.
   He was on his way to an assignment with a fighter squadron when
he learned he had been selected as an astronaut candidate in 1980.
   Richards is married. His flight experience includes more than
4,000 hours in 16 different kinds of airplanes.

   Marine Lt. Col. Robert Cabana is
making his first trip into space as the pilot aboard Discovery.
   The 41-year-old astronaut said before the launch that he was
looking forward to his first trip into space, calling it ``the
culmination of a lot of years of work on my part.''
   Cabana is quick to defend NASA, attributing the recent rash of
problems to mere coincidence, not carelessness.
   ``I think NASA is going to come through this and do just fine.
... I haven't seen any complacency at all,'' Cabana said. ``There's
no push to do anything unsafely.''
   Cabana was born in Minneapolis where he graduated from Washburn
High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics from the
Naval Academy.
   He also graduated from the Navy test pilot school and later
served as a test pilot for flight systems and ordnance separation
testing on aircraft.
   NASA selected him as an astronaut in 1986. He and his wife have
three children.
   When the Discovery mission ends, Cabana said he plans to get
back in line and wait for another flight assignment. He hopes to
command his own shuttle mission.
   ``I want to stay here and fly shuttles as long as they let me,''
he said.

   Navy Capt. Bill Shepherd, a veteran
of a previous shuttle mission, is the flight engineer aboard
Discovery.
   Shepherd, 41, first flew into space aboard Atlantis on a secret
Defense Department mission in December 1988. He was a mission
specialist on that flight.
   On this mission, Shepherd is taking on the additional role of
flight engineer, who assists the commander and pilot during takeoff
and landing.
   Shepherd was born in Oak Ridge, Tenn. He graduated from Arcadia
High School in Scottsdale, Ariz., and earned a bachelor's degree in
aerospace engineering from the Naval Academy.
   He also attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
where he earned a master's degree in mechanical engineering.
   After graduating from the Naval Academy, he served with an
underwater demolition team and two SEAL teams. Shepherd, who's
single, was selected as an astronaut in 1984.

   Discovery mission specialist Bruce
E. Melnick is the first astronaut selected from the U.S. Coast
Guard.
   Melnick, a Coast Guard commander, is one of two Discovery
astronauts designated to perform a spacewalk during the mission
should an emergency arise.
   Melnick said he first wanted to be an astronaut as a youth when
he watched Alan Shepherd become the first American to fly in space.
   ``But I didn't think it was a realistic goal,'' Melnick said.
   Melnick was born in New York City, but he grew up in Clearwater,
Fla., where he graduated from Clearwater High School.
   He worked on fishing boats in Florida and became interested in
the Coast Guard planes he saw flying in the area. Being a Coast
Guard pilot, he said, seemed a more realistic goal - ``so that's
the direction I took.''
   After earning a bachelor's degree in engineering from the Coast
Guard Academy, he was assigned as a deck watch officer aboard a
cutter. Sixteen months later, he went to Navy flight training.
   He earned his wings in 1974 and a master's degree in
aeronautical systems from the University of West Florida a year
later. He worked as a Coast Guard rescue pilot and an operations
officer before being selected as an astronaut.
   Melnick is married and has two children.

   Air Force Maj. Tom Akers, who is
making his first trip into space, was assigned to deploy the
plutonium-powered Ulysses sun probe during the mission.
   He also is one of the crew members trained to do a spacewalk if
necessary.
   Akers was born in St. Louis but considers Eminence, Mo., his
hometown. He was the 1969 high school valedictorian from Eminence
High School.
   He earned a bachelor's and master's degree in applied
mathematics from the University of Missouri-Rolla.
   Akers worked as a National Park Ranger at Alley Springs, Mo.,
during the summers from 1972 through 1975. He also spent four years
as a high school principal in Eminence.
   He joined the Air Force in 1979 and attended the Air Force Test
Pilot School three years later.
   Akers, married and with two children, was serving as the
executive officer to the armament division's deputy commander for
research, development and acquisition when selected as an astronaut
in 1987.

   When Chuck Yeager uses the phrase, "the right stuff," he's talking about the way golden trout tastes when you cook it over an open fire with wild onions, pulled fresh out of the ground. 
In "Press On: Further Adventures in the Good Life" (with Charles Leerhsen, Bantam, 247 pages, $17.95), he confesses that he still doesn't know what Tom Wolfe meant by the phrase when he made it the title of his best-selling book about pilots. 
"Tom Wolfe made a lot of money off it, but it's not something I've ever heard a pilot say." 

   Still, Tom's a nice guy, says Mr. Yeager, though maybe a bit too abstruse: "I never understood a lot of what he was driving at. 
Once, a few years ago, he sent me a bunch of his books to read, but I never got past the titles, they were so weird. 'Velvet Gloves and Mauve Something' was one, I think. 
I prefer Louis L'Amour any day." 

   Mauve doesn't fit into the color scheme of Mr. Yeager's life. 
Blue, brown and green are his shades, though the plane he broke the sound barrier in was orange. 
"Press On" is mostly a series of fun and exhilarating stories about Mr. Yeager in the out-of-doors. 
The best chapter is the first, in which he describes his life-long love affair with a mountain range, the Sierra Nevada. 
"My annual trip into the Sierras is now the central event of my life," he says. 
Once he took relaxing camping trips in those mountains, time off from the exhaustion of flying, but now his journeys have become more rugged, with 18-mile-a-day hikes up bloodying terrain, and only what dinner you can catch. 
"They have evolved into more like military missions," Mr. Yeager writes. 

   Mr. Yeager savors his paradoxes: that his vacations seem like slave labor, that pain and challenge are resources out of which his happiness is made, that killing animals is consistent with environmentalism, rightly understood. 

   He is really advocating a lifestyle in this book more than systematically recording a life. 
He has not led a model existence -- restless and independent, he apparently didn't have much time for his young children -- but it has been a great life for storytellers, both for Tom Wolfe and for himself. 
"Press On" is cleansing reading for those of us stuck with lives too much dominated by those Mauve Somethings.

   The funniest comic strip these days is "Calvin and Hobbes" by Bill Waterson. 
It is about a six-year-old terror named Calvin -- a little maniac the way we all hope we were as six-year-olds. 
His best friend is a tiger named Hobbes, though when other people are around, Hobbes turns into a stuffed tiger doll. 

   The genius of "Calvin and Hobbes" is that it captures kids the way they authentically are, not as the cute little creatures adults see -- the ones who say the darndest things. 
It is not perverse in Mr. Waterson's view that a little boy would have a tiger for a buddy; it is perverse that other people would see this tiger as a rag doll. 
For Calvin the world of make-believe is the real world. 
The annoying part is that it keeps getting interrupted by the world of grown-ups. 
First thing you know a giant prehistoric monster has risen from the ocean, heading for power lines, leaving a trail of destruction in its path. 
The monster comes upon its archrival Megalon and spews out a mighty ball of fire. 
Next thing you know, Calvin's mom is chasing him back up the stairs, trying to get him back in the bathtub. 

   Literati complain because best-seller lists are dominated by books of comic strips. 
If they are all as good as "The Essential Calvin and Hobbes" (Andrews &amp;McMeel, 255 pages, $12.95), you will be hearing no complaints from me.

<TEXT>
   With its engines spitting fire and its pencil-thin
nose outlined against gray skies, the sleek American spy plane set
down here Wednesday for its debut at the world's most famous air
show.
   The SR-71 reconnaissance jet has never been displayed outside the
United States, but it will be a featured attraction at the Paris Air
Show, where it will stand beside flying machines from the Soviet
Union and other nations.
   More than 365,000 people are expected to attend.
   The air show, which is to be opened Thursday by President
Francois Mitterrand, will include a celebration of the 20th
anniversary of America's walk on the moon.
   The show, held every two years, is to the air industry what the
Cannes film festival is to movies: a glitzy gathering where products
are promoted, aviation stars strut before reporters, deals are
announced and others are made.
   More than 1,000 exhibitors from 34 countries will be at the show
this year, and 140,000 industry professionals are expected. They cut
deals under the roar of aircraft flying nonstop demonstrations
overhead.
   Even before the show officially opened, the rainy skies over
Pari's Le Bourget airfield were filled with jets performing feats
that awed even jaded professionals in the midst of last-minute
preparations for the displays.
   After setting down in the SR-71, known as the Blackbird because
of its two vertical stabilizers and sleek profile, the pilot and
systems officer climbed out of the aircraft dressed like astronauts.
Before a crowd of photographers, they unfurled the blue, white and
red French flag.
   First delivered to the U.S. Air Force in 1966, the plane was
developed by Lockheed Aircraft Corp. as a long-range, advanced
strategic reconnaissance aircraft.
   It is one of the fastest and highest-flying in the skies today.
It cruises at altitudes above 80,000 feet and at speeds of about
3,100 feet per second _ more than three times faster than sound.
   The aircraft carries systems capable of surveying 100,000 square
miles in one hour, placing it in direct competition with newer, more
sophisticated satellites.
   The Soviets also gave a glimmer Wednesday of what their planes
can do.
   Their Soukhoi-27 _ being shown alongside two MiG-29 jet fighters
and the Soviet space shuttle Buran _ swooped, spun, and flipped high
overhead. At one moment, the high-speed plane seemed to stall dead
still, pulled its nose straight up, and flipped over on its back.
   Apollon Systvov, the Soviet Aeronautics Industry Minister, later
told a news conference the relaxation of international tensions and
more openness in his country made it possible for greater
participation by the Soviets at this year's show.
   ``We want to give you an idea of the level of Soviet technology
and the expertise of our pilots,'' he said. ``But we do not deny the
commercial aspects and know there is a market for our aircraft.''
   The Soviet officials said he expected his country's space shuttle
to be the star of the show.
   He said Buran, which made its first unmanned flight last
November, has commercial possibilities as a satellite launcher.
However, he said his government will continue launching its
satellites with rockets.
   Buran's next flight is to be in 1991, he said.

Sharp-eyed observers have spotted flocks of the Air Force's most secret fighter 
jets flying over Southern California in recent weeks, providing the first 
in-flight glimpses of an aircraft that has remained shrouded in mystery for 
more than 10 years, according to an authoritative defense industry magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Groups of 10 F-117 "stealth" fighter jets have been seen during daylight hours 
streaking over Mojave, a small town outside Edwards Air Force Base about 90 
miles north of Los Angeles, Aviation Week and Space Technology reported in its 
May 1 issue. 
</P>
<P>
After flying the F-117 for five years, the Air Force last November unveiled the 
aircraft to the public for the first time. The plane uses special designs and 
materials to elude detection by radar. 
</P>
<P>
At that time, the service said it wanted to begin daytime flights of the 
bat-like warplane and acknowledged that such training flights would lead to 
sightings by civilians. Until recently, the Air Force had been flying the 
aircraft under cover of night in an effort to keep details of the plane a 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
The Air Force, which has remained secretive about most details of the plane, 
said Friday that it would not discuss operational matters regarding the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
While the nation's 52-plane force of the stealth fighters is based at Tonopah 
Test Range Airfield in Nevada, the latest round of training flights appears to 
be conducted at Edwards Air Force Base and nearby test ranges in the Mojave 
Desert. 
</P>
<P>
Aviation Week noted that Edwards Air Force Base traditionally has been used as 
a flying range for experimental planes, rather than as a training site for 
planes already in the force. Practice runs involving 10 aircraft, such as those 
observed on April 12 and 18, are rare in that area. 
</P>
<P>
Overflights of the aircraft have revealed to area residents one its most 
distinctive characteristics -- the faint, high-pitched whine of two engines as 
the jet passes overhead at speeds just below the speed of sound. "This sound 
was definitely different," one observer told the magazine. "There was no doubt 
this was something we hadn't heard before. It even set the dogs off before we 
heard it." 
</P>
<P>
Lockheed Corp. is to build a total of 59 F-117s at its experimental "skunk 
works" facility in Palmdale.

   Two top-of-the-line Soviet fighters
accompanied by the world's largest aircraft made a historic stop at
Elmendorf Air Force Base on Sunday, en route to a ``sales mission''
in Canada.
   It was the first time that MiG-29 fighters and the Soviet An-225
transport had landed on the North American continent.
   ``These are showroom models,'' said Maj. Doug McCoy, an
Elmendorf spokesman who was referring to the pair of stripped-down
MiG-29s that had taxied to within 20 yards of journalists, Air
Force observers and about 250 spectators.
   ``These are factory aircraft. They haven't been delivered to the
Soviet Air Force. Civilian test pilots are flying the MiGs.''
   The Soviets were en route to the Abbotsford International Air
Show in Vancouver, British Columbia.
   There, the fighters and the giant transport will be displayed
and demonstrated as part of the Soviet military's latest and
greatest.
   After a four-hour refueling stop in Alaska they were to be
escorted to the Canadian border by U.S. Air Force F-15 Eagles. They
were to be met by Canadian Forces CF-18s Hornet jet fighters.
   ``This is the first time since 1945 that Soviet fighter aircraft
have flown through Alaska airspace,'' said Lt. Gen. Thomas
McInerney, commander of the Alaskan Air Command. ``It hasn't been
since Lend-Lease when some 8,000 planes left U.S. factories being
flown directly to the Soviet Eastern Front that we've marked such
an occurrence.
   ``Today we are hosting the Soviet military aircraft en route to
a much friendlier event.''
   Capt. Richard Armstrong, one of the F-15 Eagle fighter pilots
who escorted the MiGs through U.S. airspace, said it was thrilling
to be the first American pilot to get so close to the Soviet
frontline fighter.
   ``I'd like to say it was another day at the office, but I'd be
ying,'' Armstrong said. ``It's a pretty airplane. I felt a little
like you do when you have guests in your house. You want to make
them feel comfortable, but you give them some help.''
   The Soviets took time to participate in a news conference Sunday
primarily to express thanks for the welcome they had been shown.
   They were hosted for lunch at the Elmendorf Officers' Club and
invited to shop at the Base Exchange.
   ``We were met by excellent aircraft and excellent pilots,'' said
Anotoly Kvochur, a Mikoyan Test Bureau pilot who does the
demonstration flights of the MiG-29s at air shows. ``I hope our
relations will be just as they are and will improve.''
   Kvochur was forced to eject from a MiG-29 two months ago at the
Paris Air Show when the aircraft sucked a bird into a jet intake
during a low-altitude pass.
   The green, gray and black MiG-29s are twin-engine fighters
comparable in size to the Navy's F-A-18 Hornet.
   The transport has six turbofan engines and plays a major role in
the Soviet space program, in which it shuttles the Buran space
shuttle orbiter and sections of rocket launch vehicles.
   It was unknown to the West until a prototype was unveiled last
year. Fewer than 10 are likely to be manufactured, Air Force
officials said.

<DATELINE> DIXIE VALLEY, Nev.  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is dawn, and Edward Robbins sits guard on his front porch, scanning the desert sky. 

   "There's one," he shouts. 
A silver Navy jet screams along the valley rim, then suddenly veers skyward as if to evade an enemy, unfurling a resounding roar onto the valley floor. 
The Robbins ranch house shakes, the china clatters inside. 

   "See what we put up with," complains Mr. Robbins, a 53-year-old former Air Force mechanic. 
"Easterners just can't fathom the vistas, the solitude we have out here. 
But where does it say that because I chose this way of life, they have the right to destroy me?" 

   In a paradox of peace, the U.S. military is waging mock war in the American West. 
The armed services, their arsenals augmented by the Reagan defense buildup, have intensified their training activities and greatly expanded their presence in Western states. 
With airspace above one-fifth of the continental U.S. designated for special military use -- up from one-seventh a decade ago -- many Westerners feel besieged by their own defenders. 

   "They're carving up the West so each branch has its own sandbox," asserts Mr. Robbins. 

   Anti-military sentiment is mounting, especially among rural residents. 
Nothing riles them more than the noise barrage from supersonic jets bursting through the sound barrier at 750 miles per hour and helicopters whirring over their homes. 
Here in western Nevada, residents blame sonic booms from Navy jets for damaging homes, causing heart attacks and making pregnant cattle abort. 
Ranchers also suspect that some mysterious incidents, possibly involving laser beams, are linked to top-secret weapons experiments. 

   In Utah and South Dakota, Indians accuse fighter pilots of buzzing their villages and sacred lands, spoiling religious ceremonies that require total silence. 
On Arizona's Papago Indian Reservation, certain sonic booms so unnerve a mentally retarded boy that he cowers all day in a basement and cries, according to his mother. 

   Rural New Mexico residents, meanwhile, say that the Air Force played "mathematical games" in assessing the environmental impact of a proposed supersonic flight-training area. 
And in Texas and Nebraska, citizens' groups have fought military plans to build radar stations that would emit microwave radiation. 

   On these and other fronts, the armed services are battling against coalitions of such unlikely allies as peace activists, environmentalists, miners, ranchers and Indians. 

   At the same time, the services still enjoy widespread support in the West, where military spending buoys many small-town economies. 
Most rural Westerners are veterans themselves and favor a strong U.S. defense. 
But many maintain that the services should share training areas and coordinate exercises to reduce their environmental impact. 

   The military, for its part, contends that the complexity of modern weapons and the growth in the nation's global defense commitments justify the proliferation of training activities in the West. 
The Navy under President Reagan, for example, has adopted a bold maritime strategy that calls for an all-out air and sea attack on the Soviet Union's Arctic submarine bases if war breaks out in Europe. 
Any such strategy, defense analysts say, requires meticulous planning and intensive training. 

   "Our business is bombing," asserts Capt. Richard Toft, commanding officer of the Fallon Naval Air Station at Fallon, Nev. 
"What good does it do to train at 250 knots when every two-bit Third World air force in the world flies supersonic?" 

   Donald Nonella's business is ranching. 
To his consternation, the Navy has turned the airspace above his pasture into a supersonic approach route for one of its bombing ranges. 
The whine and sonic booms from low-flying jets, he says, make ranch life intolerable. 

   "They seem to like flying right at you, and they're arrogant as hell about it, too," says Mr. Nonella, a self-described "conservative" in cowboy boots, red bandana and ten-gallon hat. 
"I've had planes blow smoke through my front door." 

   Here in Dixie Valley, residents have endured as many as 136 sonic booms a day. 
They angrily point at the damage from the sonic barrage: broken windows, cracked walls, even a mobile home dislodged from its foundations. 
The Navy halted all supersonic flights over the valley in 1985 until it could buy out the unhappy landowners. 
But Mr. Robbins and others have refused to sell. 

   They complain that Marine helicopters mounted a terrifying raid on their settlement one night, hovering at window level to shine spotlights into their homes. 
They also accuse a Navy pilot of launching a ground-hugging missile that just missed a school bus. 
The Navy confirms the nocturnal raid but denies having any such missile mishap. 

   Two years ago, two Navy F-18 jets bombarded a nearby ghost town with 500-pound bombs, hitting an old mineshaft, according to valley residents. 
The mine caught fire and burned for several days. 
A Navy spokesman says that the pilots, just in from Florida and unaccustomed to "everything looking so brown," mistakenly overran their target. 

   "It's been a living hell," says Beverly Washabaugh, a horsebreeder who lives near the ghost town. 

   Just as troubling for her and her neighbors is a bizarre series of incidents. 
Ira "Hammie" Kent, a Stillwater, Nev., rancher, says that one of his "buckaroos," or cowboys, was setting coyote traps in the nearby mountains last year when the metal devices suddenly became too hot to handle, the man's hair stood on end and his horse "went plum crazy." 
Mr. Kent believes the incident, which lasted two or three minutes, may have been connected to some sort of high-energy weapons experiment. 

   Two years ago, Mr. Nonella's buckaroo found four dead cattle lying in a straight line one mile long, their chests and bellies pocked by some sort of lesions. 
Mr. Nonella swears the marks were burns, conceivably from a laser gun, but a state veterinarian concluded that the carcasses were too decomposed to know for certain. 

   Capt. Toft says that the Navy is extremely careful about using laser-guidance systems and denies that any kind of weapons research is going on at the Fallon base. 

   No matter what he and other officers say, many rural Westerners believe that the military just doesn't care what happens to them. 
"Their only concern is destruction," asserts Ed Robbins' wife, Ruth, who founded a group called Mothers Against Military Arrogance, or MAMA. 
She cites the Navy's stance on sonic booms. 

   Medical studies dating back to the early 1970s show that repeated exposure to sonic booms of much lower intensity than those over Dixie Valley can cause hearing loss, nervous disorders and heart attacks, Mrs. Robbins says. 
Yet, the Navy's 1984 draft environmental-impact report on its Fallon-based supersonic operations suggests that "long-term public health data could be collected to test for possible health-related associations" with sonic booms. 
Such data on local residents, the report says, "could be useful in providing a sound basis for future planning and decisions." 

   Fumes Richard Bargen, a Gabbs, Nev., physician: "The Navy basically said, 'OK, we know what happens if you run into a brick wall at 60 miles per hour. 
Now let's see what happens if you run into a brick wall at 120 miles per hour.'" 

   Many ranchers maintain -- and the Navy disagrees -- that sonic booms and other jet disturbances are causing cattle to abort or abandon their calves to die. 
One Nevada rancher reports a 10% drop in his herd's annual breeding rate in two years. 

   James Johnson, a rancher in Belle Fourche, S.D., says that the proliferation of low-flying bombers from nearby Ellsworth Air Force Base has disrupted the grazing of his cattle and sheep, costing him extra money in livestock feed. 
Mr. Johnson says that he and his neighbors are gathering data for "dropping a bomb" on the Air Force -- a lawsuit to stop the overflights. 
"There's no use trying to reason with those miserable pups," he says. 

   Indians also feel increasingly beset by the military. 
Low-level Air Force flights over South Dakota threaten to spoil the revival of traditional Sioux religion, say members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. 
Phyllis Young, a Sioux mother, says that when two of her boys went into the Black Hills last summer for their "hanblechiya" -- four days of solitary dancing and fasting in a quest for a religious vision -- they were buzzed by jets and harassed by hovering choppers. 

   "The military tells me it's just curiosity on the part of the pilots," she says. 
"I don't care what it is. 
It's preventing us from practicing our religion." 

   An Air Force spokesman insists that aircraft from Ellsworth and other bases "don't buzz people." 
The Air Force studies extensively the impact of low-level flights on residents, livestock and wildlife before it inaugurates any training routes, he says. 
Livestock easily adapt to jet noises, he adds. 

   While many Westerners are angry and frustrated these days, a few succeed in thwarting military activities near their homes. 
Marcus Henderson, a mechanical engineer, confronted the Air Force about microwave radiation from a giant radar station proposed for a hill overlooking his town, Christoval, Texas. 
He was concerned about possible genetic damage and other health effects. 
The Air Force, he says, assured townspeople that the site would operate at the same "average power" level as a large FM radio station. 
But he calls the comparison "intentionally misleading." 

   "Most radio stations operate continuously, yet they glossed over the fact that the radar site would only transmit one percent of the time," he says. 
"So the average output of microwave radiation didn't look so bad, but the peak values would have been very high." 

   Mr. Henderson's findings helped turn residents against the project. 
After they hired an environmental lawyer, the Air Force decided to build elsewhere. 
"The system works pretty well if you've got a well-prepared complaint and enough money for a good attorney," he says. 
"But if we had been poor sharecroppers, no way." 

   The system seems to work particularly well for those who aren't daunted by technical data. 
Steven Rothman, a computer scientist in Catron County, N.M., went through a stack of Air Force documents on a proposed pilot-training area. 
"The environmental impact statement was so intimidating and filled with mathematical games, I don't think they thought anyone would ever read it," he says. 

   Mr. Rothman discovered that the Air Force had based certain environmental-impact calculations on a "maneuvering ellipse" constituting just one-tenth of the airspace slated for supersonic flights. 
Armed with that fact, Catron County officials wrung from the Air Force a concession that effectively negated the area's value for aerial dogfights and other exercises. 
The Air Force has yet to use the area. 

   Despite such local disputes, the armed services can count on broad public support in the West. 
Many towns, reeling from low prices for oil, minerals and beef, have embraced military projects as vital pump-primers for their economies. 
"We want to make the Air Force part of our community," says Mayor Robert Helmer of Belle Fourche, home of a new electronic facility for monitoring bombing runs. 

   In Fallon, the Navy is halfway through a three-year expansion and modernization program that is expected to provide local businesses with an estimated $120 million in contracts. 
The base, with a payroll of more than $20 million, is the area's largest employer. 

   The armed services, moreover, can muster good reasons for expanding their activities. 
The Navy, for one, maintains that the computerized training ranges around Fallon give pilots indispensable cockpit experience. 
At the southern end of Dixie Valley, for instance, pilots often negotiate an electronic warfare range studded with hidden antiaircraft missile sites. 
Instead of missiles, the sites fire radio beams at the attacking jets, with computers keeping score of hits and misses. 

   "If you're going to ask these boys to risk their lives for their country," says Capt. Toft, "you owe them facilities like this for training."

   Buzz Aldrin laments that ``the
promise of Apollo was never fulfilled,'' that the American space
program languished after he and Neil Armstrong left the first human
footprints on the moon two decades ago.
   He says he hopes the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11 will ``become
a catalyst for the country to chart a bold course for human
expansion outward.''
   But given today's political and tight budgetary climate, Aldrin
is not too hopeful.
   President Bush is expected to voice continuing support for a
permanent manned space station and say other nice things about
NASA's program when he meets with Aldrin, Armstrong and their
command module pilot, Michael Collins, on July 20, the anniversary
of the moon landing.
   But no matter how many nice things the president says about
space, the political truth is that Congress must approve the money.
And with the space station already facing a sharp funding cut,
Congress is not expected to give much support to new projects.
   So the National Aeronautics and Space Administration once again
is at a crossroads, as it was when the glory days of Apollo ended.
   President John F. Kennedy had committed this nation to landing a
man on the moon in the 1960s. The goal was to gain space superiority
over the Soviet Union, whose early feats had earned the Russians
worldwide respect and shocked Americans.
   When the United States won the race to the moon, NASA laid out
bold plans for the future.
   To a presidential panel, agency head Thomas Paine in 1969
proposed a 12-man space station and a reusable space shuttle in
operation as early as 1976, followed by a station in moon orbit, a
base on the moon, a 50-man space station in Earth orbit and a manned
mission to Mars in the 1980s.
   But in a period of unrest due to domestic racial problems and
involvement in Vietnam, costly plans to explore space were given low
priority.
   Only the reuseable space shuttle survived, and its proposed
funding was cut deeply.
   ``Those were tough times,'' said Paine, who resigned in
frustration a year after Apollo 11.
   The Ford and Carter administrations were lukewarm toward the
space program, but the shuttle was built. It performed capably as a
space truck for 24 missions until Jan. 28, 1986, when the Challenger
exploded, killing its seven crew members and grounding the program
for 32 months.
   NASA had gained some hope from President Reagan's endorsement of
a strong space program and from his 1984 State of the Union message,
in which he backed building the space station Freedom.
   In 1985, Congress created a commission to define long-term space
goals. Its chief was Thomas Paine, the former NASA administrator.
   Six months after Challenger, Paine stood in the Oval Office and
gave Reagan a slick leather-bound volume that recommended the space
station, a lunar base and manned trips to Mars _ essentially an
update of Paine's 1969 plan.
   Reagan two years later signed a Presidential Directive on
National Space Policy that stated space leadership was a fundamental
objective. It endorsed the space station and, without being
specific, set a long-range goal ``to expand human presence and
activity beyond Earth orbit into the solar system.''
   Reagan's policy set in motion a NASA program named Pathfinder
whose goal is to test technologies for manned and robotic
exploration of the moon and planets, advanced missions in orbit and
on planetary surfaces, extended human presence in space, and space
transportation to the moon and planets.
   Bush has not disclosed his thinking beyond saying he supports a
space station. He established the National Space Council, headed by
Vice President Dan Quayle, to recommend a comprehensive space policy.
   Quayle is expected to have a preliminary outline ready for Bush's
anniversary meeting with the Apollo 11 astronauts.
   NASA needs a decision from Congress soon on how much money it can
spend next year on space station Freedom. A permanent orbiting space
station is essential to those ambitious Pathfinder dreams and would
serve as a training base and launch pad for flights deeper into
space.
   Bush has requested $2.05 billion in the budget for fiscal 1990 to
continue work on the station. Predictions are that Congress will
trim that by $400 million to $700 million, amounts that space
officials say could further delay or even kill the project.
   The space station project has gone through five tumultuous years.
Reagan wanted it built in cooperation with America's major allies,
but there were stormy sessions over access to the station before 10
European nations, Japan and Canada agreed to invest nearly $8
billion to build sections of it.
   NASA said in 1984 it could begin launching segments of the
orbiting laboratory in 1992 and estimated the U.S. cost at $8
billion. In 1987, agency officials revised the pricetag to $14.6
billion. The new figure covered a suddenly scaled-down Phase One,
which left off two of the external struts to which experiment
modules would be attached. The struts would be added in orbit under
Phase Two.
   Shortly after that, a National Research Council panel reviewing
station costs and technical issues for the White House said the
total cost to develop and deploy the first phase would be $25.02
billion, with Phase Two raising the cost to $32.8 billion.
   The schedule began slipping. And NASA now says if it receives the
proper funding, it could begin assembling the station in 1995.
   Some in Congress believe NASA should alter its plans and build a
less complex station and, instead of relying totally on the space
shuttle, develop a large unmanned rocket to do much of the lifting
job.
   Orbiting at 250 miles, Freedom would be home to a crew of eight,
with astronauts rotating back to Earth after four to six months.
   The station would allow humans to study the stars and planets
from the pollution-free environment of space. The weightless
interior would permit manufacture of new, contamination-free
medicines and other products impossible to create on Earth.
Astronauts would assemble, service and repair satellites and send
them out into space. And the station could eventually be the staging
point for man's return to the moon or a journey to Mars.
   No one can predict whether these grand plans will come about, but
the three astronauts who made that extraordinary Apollo 11 flight to
the moon 20 years ago think they should.
   ``A permanent presence in space is a worthy objective, and I hope
that space station Freedom becomes a reality,'' Neil Armstrong said
recently.
   ``I strongly endorse the station, a scientific base on the moon
and eventually manned flights to Mars,'' said Buzz Aldrin.
   Michael Collins, who orbited the moon while Armstrong and Aldrin
walked its surface, envisioned setting up a colony on Mars.
   ``We're a nation of explorers,'' he said. ``We started on the
East Coast, we went to the West Coast, and then vertically. Starting
with the Wright brothers, Chuck Yeager through the sound barrier,
Armstrong and Aldrin on the moon.
   ``It's in our tradition, it's in our culture.''

  [Text] Iraq has informed the United Nations of violations 
of its airspace by U.S. aircraft which were on surveillance and 
harassment missions, during which they dropped flares on Iraqi 
territory. 
  In a letter to UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Ghali, the 
Iraqi permanent representative to the United Nations said that 
U.S. aircraft continued to violate Iraqi airspace during period 
11-20 April. They conducted 619 hostile air sorties during that 
period. Their flights centered over northern and southern Iraq. 
  The U.S. aircraft also broke the sound barrier over several 
Iraqi cities.

The Air Force's SR-71 Blackbird spy plane smashed a transcontinental speed 
record today as it flew into retirement and the history books. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's fastest operational airplane took off from Edwards Air Force Base 
in California at 4:30 a.m., refueled offshore, flew back over Edwards and then 
shot off eastward at supersonic speeds that triggered a 6:01 a.m. sonic boom. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-to-Washington flight was 1 hour, 8 minutes and 17 seconds, said 
the Smithsonian Institution, which will keep the plane in the National Air and 
Space Museum. 
</P>
<P>
On the way to its retirement home at the museum, the airplane broke four flight 
time records, including the world record of 4 hours, 12 minutes and 10 seconds 
for a flight from Los Angeles to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured it would make it in about an hour," said Barbara Kornylo of 
Lockheed, the builder of the airplane. 
</P>
<P>
The SR-71, designed in the early 1960s, is able to cruise faster than three 
times the speed of sound. The planes were built with a titanium alloy and can 
withstand temperatures exceeding 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The first flight of 
the SR-71 was on Dec. 22, 1964, the Smithsonian said. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackbird flies at an average speed of 2,200 m.p.h., about 400 m.p.h. to 
500 m.p.h. faster than the Concorde, which is the fastest airplane in 
commercial operation, Lockheed spokesman Jim Ragsdale said. 
</P>
<P>
The SR-71 was never designed for commercial passenger use. It has seats only 
for a pilot and a reconnaissance systems officer and was designed to fly high, 
fast and unarmed on photographic reconnaissance missions. Because of the high 
altitudes the aircraft can reach, crew members on missions had to wear pressure 
suits and be connected to life support systems. 
</P>
<P>
The SR-71s were officially retired on Feb. 26, but Lockheed requested one of 
them to break some records publicly on its last flight, something that the 
plane has been doing -- but on a classified basis -- for years, Kornylo said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to breaking the world Los Angeles-to-Washington record set several 
years ago by pilot Brooke Knapp in her Lear jet 35A, the Blackbird also set 
speed records for the following: Los Angeles to Washington, 2,153.24 m.p.h.; 
St. Louis to Cincinnati, 2,242.48 m.p.h., and Kansas City to Washington, 
2,200.94 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackbird, after fueling over the Pacific Ocean from an Air Force KC-135, a 
type of flying gas station, passed through a radar screen and quickly 
accelerated past the speed of sound. 
</P>
<P>
Southland residents, hearing the sonic boom, called police to report the sound 
of an explosion or earthquake, Sgt. James McClard said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Air Force has never publicly revealed how many SR-71s it commissioned 
to be built, 12 of them were stationed at Beale Air Force Base in Northern 
California in January. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the SR-71 that flew today, one is going to a museum at Warner-Robbins 
Air Force Base in Georgia, another to March Air Force Base in Southern 
California and three to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for 
use in high-altitude research.

   Buzz Aldrin laments that ``the
promise of Apollo was never fulfilled,'' that the American space
program languished after he and Neil Armstrong left the first human
footprints on the moon two decades ago.
   He says he hopes the 20th anniversary of Apollo 11 will ``become
a catalyst for the country to chart a bold course for human
expansion outward.''
   But given today's political and tight budgetary climate, Aldrin
is not too hopeful.
   President Bush is expected to voice continuing support for a
permanent manned space station and say other nice things about
NASA's program when he meets with Aldrin, Armstrong and their
command module pilot, Michael Collins, on July 20, the anniversary
of the moon landing.
   But no matter how many nice things the president says about
space, the political truth is that Congress must approve the money.
And with the space station already facing a sharp funding cut,
Congress is not expected to give much support to new projects.
   So the National Aeronautics and Space Administration once again
is at a crossroads, as it was when the glory days of Apollo ended.
   President John F. Kennedy had committed this nation to landing a
man on the moon in the 1960s. The goal was to gain space superiority
over the Soviet Union, whose early feats had earned the Russians
worldwide respect and shocked Americans.
   When the United States won the race to the moon, NASA laid out
bold plans for the future.
   To a presidential panel, agency head Thomas Paine in 1969
proposed a 12-man space station and a reusable space shuttle in
operation as early as 1976, followed by a station in moon orbit, a
base on the moon, a 50-man space station in Earth orbit and a manned
mission to Mars in the 1980s.
   But in a period of unrest due to domestic racial problems and
involvement in Vietnam, costly plans to explore space were given low
priority.
   Only the reuseable space shuttle survived, and its proposed
funding was cut deeply.
   ``Those were tough times,'' said Paine, who resigned in
frustration a year after Apollo 11.
   The Ford and Carter administrations were lukewarm toward the
space program, but the shuttle was built. It performed capably as a
space truck for 24 missions until Jan. 28, 1986, when the Challenger
exploded, killing its seven crew members and grounding the program
for 32 months.
   NASA had gained some hope from President Reagan's endorsement of
a strong space program and from his 1984 State of the Union message,
in which he backed building the space station Freedom.
   In 1985, Congress created a commission to define long-term space
goals. Its chief was Thomas Paine, the former NASA administrator.
   Six months after Challenger, Paine stood in the Oval Office and
gave Reagan a slick leather-bound volume that recommended the space
station, a lunar base and manned trips to Mars _ essentially an
update of Paine's 1969 plan.
   Reagan two years later signed a Presidential Directive on
National Space Policy that stated space leadership was a fundamental
objective. It endorsed the space station and, without being
specific, set a long-range goal ``to expand human presence and
activity beyond Earth orbit into the solar system.''
   Reagan's policy set in motion a NASA program named Pathfinder
whose goal is to test technologies for manned and robotic
exploration of the moon and planets, advanced missions in orbit and
on planetary surfaces, extended human presence in space, and space
transportation to the moon and planets.
   Bush has not disclosed his thinking beyond saying he supports a
space station. He established the National Space Council, headed by
Vice President Dan Quayle, to recommend a comprehensive space policy.
   Quayle is expected to have a preliminary outline ready for Bush's
anniversary meeting with the Apollo 11 astronauts.
   NASA needs a decision from Congress soon on how much money it can
spend next year on space station Freedom. A permanent orbiting space
station is essential to those ambitious Pathfinder dreams and would
serve as a training base and launch pad for flights deeper into
space.
   Bush has requested $2.05 billion in the budget for fiscal 1990 to
continue work on the station. Predictions are that Congress will
trim that by $400 million to $700 million, amounts that space
officials say could further delay or even kill the project.
   The space station project has gone through five tumultuous years.
Reagan wanted it built in cooperation with America's major allies,
but there were stormy sessions over access to the station before 10
European nations, Japan and Canada agreed to invest nearly $8
billion to build sections of it.
   NASA said in 1984 it could begin launching segments of the
orbiting laboratory in 1992 and estimated the U.S. cost at $8
billion. In 1987, agency officials revised the pricetag to $14.6
billion. The new figure covered a suddenly scaled-down Phase One,
which left off two of the external struts to which experiment
modules would be attached. The struts would be added in orbit under
Phase Two.
   Shortly after that, a National Research Council panel reviewing
station costs and technical issues for the White House said the
total cost to develop and deploy the first phase would be $25.02
billion, with Phase Two raising the cost to $32.8 billion.
   The schedule began slipping. And NASA now says if it receives the
proper funding, it could begin assembling the station in 1995.
   Some in Congress believe NASA should alter its plans and build a
less complex station and, instead of relying totally on the space
shuttle, develop a large unmanned rocket to do much of the lifting
job.
   Orbiting at 250 miles, Freedom would be home to a crew of eight,
with astronauts rotating back to Earh after four to six months.
   The station would allow humans to study the stars and planets
from the pollution-free environment of space. The weightless
interior would permit manufacture of new, contamination-free
medicines and other products impossible to create on Earth.
Astronauts would assemble, service and repair satellites and send
them out into space. And the station could eventually be the staging
point for man's return to the moon or a journey to Mars.
   No one can predict whether these grand plans will come about, but
the three astronauts who made that extraordinary Apollo 11 flight to
the moon 20 years ago think they should.
   ``A permanent presence in space is a worthy objective, and I hope
that space station Freedom becomes a reality,'' Neil Armstrong said
recently.
   ``I strongly endorse the station, a scientific base on the moon
and eventually manned flights to Mars,'' said Buzz Aldrin.
   Michael Collins, who orbited the moon while Armstrong and Aldrin
walked its surface, envisioned setting up a colony on Mars.
   ``We're a nation of explorers,'' he said. ``We started on the
East Coast, we went to the West Coast, and then vertically. Starting
with the Wright brothers, Chuck Yeager through the sound barrier,
Armstrong and Aldrin on the moon.
   ``It's in our tradition, it's in our culture.''

Aloft for First Nonstop Global Flight

   Burt and Richard Rutan have found that the world's first nonstop, around-the-world airplane trip isn't easy to get off the ground. 

   In 1981, 43-year-old airplane designer Burt Rutan and his brother the test-pilot Richard, 48, announced their intention to build a plane that would fly more than 25,000 miles around the globe without refueling -- doubling the world nonstop flight record of 12,532 miles, set in 1962. 

   Five years and 22,000 man-hours later, the Voyager appears to be poised finally to take off on its daring flight sometime this weekend. 
Although further delays are possible because of uncertain weather, the flight must be launched soon, or be postponed until spring when the winter's cold desert winds have gone away. 

   After the plane set a world record for non-destination, nonstop flights last July, staying aloft for 4 1/2 days, the Rutan brothers had hoped to make the world flight in late summer. 
But technical problems, including a major propeller failure, forced several delays. 

   On the trek from idea to runway, the Rutans had to win over a skeptical public and aerospace community, who at first failed to support the project, which is said to be as risky as the pioneering flights of Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart. 

   The challenge is immense. 
To follow the equator without refueling, a plane must be large enough to carry thousands of pounds of fuel, yet light enough to minimize the size and weight of its engines. 

   The 1962 nonstop flight record was set by a giant B-52 Air Force bomber, which has a 46,000-gallon fuel capacity but is too heavy to make a global flight without refueling. 
By contrast, a four-passenger, single-engine Beech Bonanza propeller-driven plane weighs only 3,412 pounds. 
But the Bonanza carries only 74 gallons of fuel, which means it would have to refuel a minimum of 25 times to circumnavigate the globe. 

   Burt Rutan, designer of the new Beech Starship business aircraft, conceived Voyager to weigh less than 2,000 pounds, yet carry nearly 9,000 pounds -- or more than 1,500 gallons -- of fuel and two crew members. 

   The plane is essentially a flying fuel tank, with fuel stored in 17 separate tanks. 
The airframe is made of ultra-lightweight composites of graphite and wood fiber, in a radical design that features small forward wings for maximum lift and flexible rear wings almost as long as the wings of a 110-passenger Boeing 727 jetliner. 

   Because the project didn't attract much corporate support, it limped along for years as the Rutans' personal funds ran out. 
"We looked around for one big sponsor who would put their name across the plane," says co-pilot Jeana Yeager. 
"But nobody wanted to take a chance on a 'paper' airplane." 

   Voyager finally began to take shape last year. 
The equipment, including many of the materials in the hand-built plane, was mostly obtained on loan or without charge from a handful of companies intrigued by the commercial spinoffs. 

   Teledyne Inc. adapted a long-range, high-endurance engine it makes for military reconnaissance planes. 
King Radio Corp., a unit of Allied-Signal Inc., developed the avionics. 
And Hercules Inc. and Hexcel Corp., makers of composite materials, helped build the molded structure, which they hope will demonstrate the use of lightweight composites to replace metal in aircraft frames. 

   "I heard they had this project going and told them we had a low-fuel consumption engine they should take a look at," says Donald Bigler, president of Teledyne Continental Motors Inc., Mobile, Ala. 
The company hopes to market the engine under the name Voyager for the next generation of business aircraft, he says. 

   Other companies lent computers and communications equipment or gave donations, such as the $3,000 that went to lease Voyager's "mission control" a trailer at Mojave's tiny airport. 
The companies received advertising rights for their support. 
In addition, about 3,700 individuals made donations of $100 each to the project. 

   After the Voyager's test flights this summer were plagued by technical problems, about two dozen aerospace scientists and engineers paid their own expenses to travel to this remote location about 200 miles northeast of Los Angeles to help. 

   Younger workers, lured by the chance to help make aviation history, have also pitched in. 
Several test pilots assigned to nearby Edwards Air Force Base, where the Voyager will take off and land, are helping to process flight data on their time off. 
Says meteorologist Larry Brunch, who analyzes weather data for Voyager between shifts at the local National Weather Service office, "They need help." 

   The volunteers formed a network among old colleagues, persuading the Air Force to allow an employee of its weather-monitoring station in Omaha, Neb., to help Voyager find a safe path around turbulence. 
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration allowed the Voyager crew to use a NASA channel for air-to-ground communications. 
Voyager carries an experimental emergency-locater beacon, on loan from NASA, that would be triggered if the plane went down in salt water. 

   Finally, with cold winds already whipping through Mojave, Voyager's volunteer crew is racing to get the plane in the air before the weather turns too ugly. 
Says Ms. Yeager: "We've spent all our money on this. 
We have to finish it."

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It flies to more than 17 miles high, out of
harm's way, at three times the speed of sound, faster than a bullet.
The SR-71, the original stealth jet called the ``Blackbird,'' is 25
years old now but it still holds world records for speed and
altitude. As one Air Force pilot says, ``The SR-71 excites the boy
in all of us who love to fly.''

   The SR-71 suddenly flashes into view
out of nowhere, like a star ship in the movies. Shaped like a
dagger, black and sinister, it slices cloud puffs in an otherwise
blue sky as it climbs slowly to mate with a refueling air tanker.
   This is the ``Blackbird,'' the original stealth jet that rockets
at 2,100 mph to the edge of space as it spies on global hot spots
out of reach of attack.
   The spacesuit-clad pilot and navigator _ members of an elite Air
Force team _ peer out toward the refueling tanker, where a news crew
is observing a training exercise that wandered 1,200 miles over five
Western states.
   The ``Blackbird,'' the photo reconnaissance jet U.S. Air Force
officials call part engineering miracle, part ghost, is the one that
first employed stealth or radar-evading technology, the one that
still packs top-secret gear and was once so secret that TV news film
of it was confiscated by the military.
   Its crew members, who themselves were the target of an espionage
attempt at their home base in California, say they have been
attacked numerous times by missiles fired from ground forces or jet
fighters futilely trying to cut short the Blackbird's missions,
which involve photographing foreign nations. SR-71s don't return
fire. They're unarmed.
   The twin-engine Blackbird is able to evade the attacks because it
still holds world records for speed and altitude, even though it is
25 years old.
   Its top capabilities remain secret, but the Air Force says it
flies to more than 85,000 feet at over three times the speed of
sound. That's roughly 33 miles a minute _ faster than a bullet, fast
enough to streak from San Francisco to New York in 1 hour, 45
minutes.
   A former SR-71 pilot, Col. Richard Graham, says the aging plane,
which was designed by Lockheed, can still out-perform most, if not
all, of the other operational aircraft in the world.
   ``For the 1960s, it was way ahead of its time. It was at the
leading edge of stealth technology,'' says Graham, who commands the
wing that includes the sole SR-71 squadron, stationed at Beale Air
Force Base, 110 miles northeast of San Francisco.
   Adds current Blackbird pilot, Lt. Col. Bill Orcutt: ``I think the
aircraft still carries quite a bit of mystique ... It looks like
something from outer space. The SR-71 excites the boy in all of us
who love to fly.''
   The pilots say it flies like no other: ``You're so far up you
don't have a sensation of speed and you start to see the curvature
of the earth,'' says Graham. ``It's smooth, serene, peaceful, quiet
_ you hear your own breathing. There's no weather at that altitude
... If you look straight up (into space), it's black.''
   But cutbacks are planned in the Blackbird program because of
budget restraints and the aircraft may soon be replaced by a
super-advanced stealth spy plane that reportedly is under
development.
   The new jet will fly even farther out of reach of hostile forces,
hurtling at about five times the speed of sound _ nearly twice as
fast as the SR-71 _ to more than 100,000 feet, news reports say.
   Moreover, the new plane is so shrouded in stealth technology that
it will go undetected as it careens over other nations, according to
the reports. The stealth technology, still largely secret, has grown
far more sophisticated in the two decades since the design of the
SR-71, which was built with radar-absorbing materials and
beam-deflecting curves on its body.
   With the new jet still under development, along with its F-19
fighter and B-2 bomber counterparts, it is the SR-71 that continues
to collect information for the Pentagon and the Central Intelligence
Agency.
   Recent missions reportedly have included flights over the Persian
Gulf and the Arabian Sea to provide data to U.S. warships operating
in the area. Its cameras can photograph 100,000 square miles an
hour, revealing the terrain in enough detail to, say, make out a
license plate, according to the Air Force.
