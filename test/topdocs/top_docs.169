   The graceful sight of Canada geese slicing through
the sky in their ``V'' formation has become a foreboding sight in
the Northeast.
   ``They're very pretty to look at. Unfortunately they leave
problems behind,'' says Elaine Moore, a selectman in the town of
Stoneham where police on horseback conducted daily goose roundups
this spring.
   In Stoneham, like many other towns across the region, the birds
were welcomed when they started fluttering in about six years ago.
   ``They would cross Main Street and you would see the mother and
the little goslings behind her. The traffic would stop and let
these sweet little things go across the street,'' Ms. Moore said.
   The welcome soon wore out as the birds chewed up golf courses,
lawns and landscaped office parks, leaving behind liberal
smatterings of their pungent calling cards.
   Over the past six years more and more geese have appeared in the
Northeast, with more birds stopping short in their journey south.
Homegrown flocks have also grown.
   A Canadian expert on the wild geese said one reason for the
upsurge in local gaggles is the creation of ideal breeding grounds
in parks and on golf courses: areas of short, fertilized grass
surrounding a body of water.
   ``If you wanted to make a place for geese, you could not do
better than that,'' said Harry Lumsden, who worked for 40 years for
Canada's Ministry of Natural Resources in Ontario and now is a
private consultant.
   ``We make the mistake of allowing the geese to get the idea that
this park or this golf course is a nice safe place with good
food,'' he said.
   In Stoneham, a town of 23,000 about 10 miles north of Boston,
residents complained of being kept awake by the honking and had to
shoo birds from their lawns with brooms. The town reservoir was
clogged with droppings and police resorted to horseback roundups in
May to corral the birds at a downtown intersection, Ms. Moore said.
   George Haas, migratory bird specialist at the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service's Boston office, said geese can be found along the
coast from Maine to Florida, but the highest concentrations are
from Maryland northward.
   Winter population inventories from last year showed 76,900 in
New York, 90,200 in New Jersey, 6,900 in Connecticut and 13,600 in
Massachusetts, Haas said. Federal officials aren't able to
determine exactly which geese are migrating and which have settled
in a state, he said.
   The federally protected birds face few predators and are smart
enough to outwit many hunters during the limited season, he said.
   Several states have implemented hunting seasons, Haas said. In
Massachusetts, about 3,000 birds were bagged in an experimental
season last year.
   One of the more innovative goose-control methods is the SS
Bytex, a radio-controlled miniature boat. The boat has been in
action since last spring, buzzing around a pond at Bytex Corp. in
Southborough to scare off geese, said owner and self-styled
``goosebuster'' Norman Heifetz.
   Lumsden said farmers in Ontario can apply for permits to kill
nuisance birds, but scaring the birds away from prime grazing
grounds with constant noisemakers is usually the most effective
method.
   ``Get after those birds in mid-May and don't give them a
moment's peace,'' he advised.

Wild Goose Chase -- Two articles in the newly published third volume of the 
"Memoirs of the Natural History Foundation of Orange County" focus on Quail 
Hill in Irvine, the only spot in the county where Canada geese winter. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, the geese can be spotted from the San Diego Freeway, feeding on the 
grassy knoll south of the freeway and west of Sand Canyon Avenue. The migratory 
waterfowl also use the nearby Sand Canyon Reservoir, which is not open to the 
public, for night resting and some foraging. 
</P>
<P>
The year 1988 was a good one for the geese: Quail Hill and lands adjacent to 
the reservoir were protected as part of the city's Open Space Plan; also, the 
population of wintering Canada geese at Quail Hill peaked that year at 4,150, 
the highest ever. 
</P>
<P>
Unexpectedly, however, numbers dwindled in 1989 to 1,350. Theories ranged from 
the loss of other nearby habitats to urban development to altered migration 
patterns caused by climatic or habitat changes along the route. The Canada 
goose is not endangered, but its numbers are dwindling along California's 
coastal slope. 
</P>
<P>
Cattle grazing in the area appears to have mixed effects on the geese. On the 
plus side, grazing encourages weedy species such as filaree, which is 
apparently one of the features drawing geese to the site; on the other hand, 
cattle grazing encourages the spread of non-native artichoke thistle. The geese 
do not seem bothered by the actual presence of the cattle. 
</P>
<P>
The success of the local wintering population of geese in the coming winter 
remains to be seen; the birds are due to begin arriving in early to 
mid-November, with numbers peaking in January and February and declining 
through March. 
</P>
<P>
Help Wanted -- The Museum of Natural History and Science is still seeking 
volunteer docents for its new interim location in Aliso Viejo, now due to open 
in December. The museum will be training volunteers in the coming months; for 
information, call (714) 640-7120.

   Police on horseback have been forced to
conduct daily Canada geese roundups because of a multiplying gaggle
that is stopping traffic, munching parched lawns and, er, making
people more careful where they step.
   ``The droppings are awesome,'' town administrator Bill Reid said
Sunday. ``Everywhere the geese go the droppings follow.''
   Since Canada geese are a protected species, it is illegal to
kill them. Residents shoo them off their lawns with brooms and honk
their car horns to get them out of the streets.
   ``They stop here in the course of their migration and people
feed them, so they stay instead of moving on,'' said officer Dan
Bates. ``At first people liked it, but now we're getting a lot of
complaints.''
   Kathleen Sullivan said Stoneham, a town of 23,000 about 10 miles
north of Boston, is known as a bedroom community, but the geese are
keeping residents awake at night with their honking.
   The flock also has raised the bacteria count at Spot Pond
Reservoir, which supplies drinking water for Stoneham and
neighboring towns.
   ``That's the main problem,'' said Mrs. Sullivan, a member of the
Board of Selectmen. ``The more they multiply, the more excretions
go in our water.''
   Town officials say the goose population has grown from a handful
when the birds arrived 10 years ago to about 650 birds, and the
flock is growing daily.
   Until recently, residents said, the geese usually stayed on a
patch of grass just north of a reservoir. But when hot weather
parched grass in late June and early July, the geese began
searching for greener pastures.
   ``They eat the grass in one place, and when there's no more,
they move down the street a little further,'' said Bates.
   As they forage, the geese have been stopping traffic at the
intersection of South Street and Route 28, one of the town's
busiest arteries. The problem became so acute last week that Dana
Owen and other officers mounted horses around noon every day to
herd the geese back across the street.
   In one yard, Owen said, ``It was just black with geese. You
couldn't see the lawn.''
   Paula Morrison, who lives near the reservoir, said she knows
it's illegal to kill the geese, but she can still hope. While
sweeping them off her lawn last week she said, ``I was hoping
several of them would get hit by a car.''
   Larry Gillis, a spokesman for the Metropolitan District
Commission, which controls the reservoir, said the MDC plans to put
up a snow fence to keep the birds off the street.
   But the best long-term solution, he said, would be for residents
and visitors simply to stop feeding the geese.
   Reid has other ideas.
   ``I think they should save four or five of them and get rid of
the rest. Ship them north,'' he said, adding, ``I hear they make
good eating.''

WILD GOOSE CHASE: It's called Quail Hill, but its most famous residents are 
geese. The Irvine slope, located along the San Diego Freeway and bounded by 
Jeffrey Road and Sand Canyon Avenue, is where thousands of migratory Canada 
geese congregate for 3 months each winter to rest and feed among the grazing 
cattle. 
</P>
<P>
The birds also use nearby Sand Canyon Reservoir, and move to and from the 
fields each morning and evening, providing a spectacle for freeway commuters. 
</P>
<P>
Preparations to make the Quail Hill area a reserve for the geese continue, 
according to John Simon, who is helping to coordinate the project as an aide to 
Irvine Mayor Larry Agran. A 360-acre preserve at Quail Hill is part of an 
open-space agreement between the city and the Irvine Co., reached last year and 
approved by the city's voters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's still the Irvine Co.'s at the moment," Simon said. The property will 
eventually be turned over to the city in exchange for development rights in 
other parts of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
This year, only about 1,200 geese wintered at the site, down from as many as 
4,000 last year. The last of the geese headed north in March, and the city has 
taken the opportunity to attack a problem of invading artichoke thistles on the 
property. The non-native plants spread a poison that kills native grasses, and 
their leaves also inhibit other growth by blocking sunlight to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
If left unchecked, Simon said, the intruders could seriously affect the amount 
of plant material available for foraging by the geese. 
</P>
<P>
Another priority is deciding how to develop the area between Quail Hill and the 
reservoir without inhibiting the movement of the geese between the areas, Simon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The geese are shy of humans, which makes any plans to provide visitor 
facilities for viewing the birds tricky. A roadside pullout with informational 
signs is one possibility, Simon said. Another is an observation area at the 
reservoir, which is not currently open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
Simon said he has visited the reservoir to view the geese on early winter 
mornings. "When they take off and start honking, it's quite a sight," he said. 
"It would be nice to involve the public in something like that."

critters.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  GEESE SETTLE IN AT LAKE ELIZABETH
TAKE A GANDER AT THIS CROWD  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Those benefiting most from the benign setting appear to be the Canada
geese. The population of the big brown geese with the sleek black necks has
soared in the past several years, ranger supervisor Judy Felber said.;   
Canada geese usually migrate, but have made Lake Elizabeth their home because
of the ideal conditions. Now they are considered true residents, just like
taxpayers.;    But there is trouble at the lake.;    About 50 of the 90
domestic geese at the park have been found dead over the past two months. A
few of the Canada geese have also died. U.C. Davis veterinarians said two
Central Park geese died from an infection called Fowl Cholera, a bacteria
common in the wild. Public health officials at U.C. Davis said the bacteria is
not a public health threat. It does not appear to extend to wild and domestic
ducks at Lake Elizabeth.;    The goose culture started about 15 years ago when
four of the migratory fowl settled in Fremont, Felber said. A fifth goose
joined them about a year later. They liked what they saw. They multiplied --
exponentially. Today, Felber estimates, there are about 400 descendents of the
original five, though only about 200 to 300 remain at the lake.;    This year,
they hatched 92 goslings who have thrilled young and old alike as the chicks
grow up before their eyes. The mom-and-pop geese teach the young'uns to swim,
walk and forage for food in the hedges and brush beside the lake.;    Joshua
Reese, a 7-year-old Fremont resident, likes to chase the goslings across the
lawn. "Excuse me! Excuse me!" he shouts to them. "Look at all the gooses.";   
Why are their numbers so high? Felber says the geese are more aggressive than
ducks, so they hog many good nesting spots on "Bird Island," the patch of land
in the middle of the lake. But even more important, Canada geese are a
"protected" species under the United States' Migratory Bird Treaty Act with
Mexico, Canada and other nations. That means that it's illegal for the rangers
to try to reduce or control their population.;    The rangers at Lake
Elizabeth do "control" the domestic bird population -- that is, of mallards
and snow geese and other fowl, by taking eggs out of some nests on Bird Island
while the mother is off doing something else.;    "The mother will come back
and look like (she's saying) 'gee where did they go?' " said Judy Morris,
another park ranger.;    The officials also have reduced the amount of bird
food they sell to the public at the ranger station, hoping birds will find the
place less appealing if they get less to eat.;    This may seem unkind, but
Morris says without population controls, the 80-acre lake would be overrun
with feathered creatures. Not only would it be impossible to traverse the
pathways, it would mean the end of windsurfing at Lake Elizabeth: the
waterfowl feces can build up harmful bacteria, and too much makes lake water
unsafe for human contact.;    In 1987, the city closed Lake Elizabeth to water
sports for eight months because of a hazardous buildup of the bacteria, which
can cause digestive problems.;    Right now, geese and ducks are laying and
hatching like crazy. Around the perimeter of the lake, male mallards, known
for their shiny green heads and colorful plumage, stand guard while the
duller-colored, brown females incubate their eggs in the shade by the lake
shore.;    But many of the mallard eggs, if not taken by rangers, get eaten,
and chicks often are killed by cats, dogs, foxes or other animals, Morris
says. She's seen only a few of the fuzzy chicks actually grow up this year.;  
 Somehow, perhaps because of the more aggressive and protective nature of the
geese, their babies are living longer, Morris says.;    Though the place seems
teeming now, there are far fewer birds in summer than winter. Right now,
there's about 600 of the animals at the lake, compared with about 3,000 in
winter, when birds fly down here from the north.;    "It's more fun in
springtime," said park visitor Janet Whisman as she threw bird seed to a group
of goslings. "I love seeing the little ones just out of the eggs. I'm going to
keep feeding them -- even if this place gets taken over by birds."  </TEXT>

<DATELINE>OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have tagged about 500 geese
in a program to reduce the chances a hunter will bag a goose
contaminated with radiation near the Oak Ridge nuclear installation.
   Some geese have staked their claim at several ponds on the
Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory compound, said
Gordon Blaylock, an Oak Ridge environmental scientist.
   Several ponds were used at one time as collection basins for
nuclear waste, and Blaylock says those still are hot with
radioactivity.
   Those ponds are getting a closer look from Oak Ridge staffers,
who tagged more than 300 geese last week in an effort to track
their movement.
   ``As long as we control the small ponds, I don't think you're
going to get a goose with a serious problem,'' Blaylock said.
   In some cases, fences were put up to keep geese from walking
into an area, while streamers attacked to rows of fishing line
strung across the ponds are meant to deter geese.
   During the past two years scientists have collared about about
500, or one-fourth, of the estimated 2,000 non-migratory Canada
geese living near the government nuclear complex, Blaylock said.
   The geese, introduced several years ago by the Tennessee Valley
Authority, are mostly non-migratory but move within a limited area,
he said. The birds' movement patterns are of interest to
scientists, Blaylock said.
   The tags can be seen with viewing scopes, letting staffers track
the birds' movement without having to capture them again.
   Other geese are tagged with leg bands, which direct that hunters
return the metal bands to Oak Ridge and include information on the
bird's location.
   Blaylock said Monday that six geese found living on a hot pond
near the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge were presumed to be
contaminated with radioactive cobalt-60. Those geese were killed
for study rather than risking the possibility of contaminated birds
leaving the area, he said.

They're Back -- In a typical season, only one or two American white pelicans 
might be spotted in Orange County. But last fall, the birds made a sudden and 
spectacular appearance, with as many as 200 seen wheeling above the Santa Ana 
River Lakes in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the American white pelican is back for the winter, although not quite in 
the concentrations witnessed last season. Flocks of 20 and fewer have been seen 
at spots around the county, including Irvine and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
White pelicans have had problems farther north in the state this season. 
Scientists recently investigated the deaths of more than 400 birds at Crowley 
Lake in Mono County; starvation was the apparent primary cause of death in half 
of all birds examined, but parasitic intestinal infestations contributed to 
their mortality as well. 
</P>
<P>
According to Doug Willick, who catalogs rare bird sightings in the county, no 
similar problems have been reported locally. Numbers of white pelicans in the 
county are much smaller than at Crowley and other locations. 
</P>
<P>
Geese Gone -- The fall arrival of Canada geese at Quail Hill in Irvine, near 
the Sand Canyon Road exit of the San Diego Freeway, has become an annual 
tradition. Flocks estimated as large as 4,000 have been spotted there in recent 
years, but this season numbers appear to be well below normal. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, the geese begin arriving in late October and reach their peak about 
now. Willick has visited the site several times in recent weeks without seeing 
any of the geese, although they may have been at nearby Sand Canyon Reservoir. 
Others have reported spotting small numbers of the geese at Quail Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Willick speculates that with the warm weather, the geese may be staying farther 
north and could still be pushed south with a big storm. Also, the dry fall has 
meant little grass for foraging. 
</P>
<P>
Quail Hill was recently set aside as a reserve for the geese as part of 
Irvine's latest open-space agreement.

CANADA TELLS ARTIST TO GROUND HIS GEESE

An Ontario artist who taught Canada geese to fly in formation with ultralight 
aircraft has found his wings clipped by the Canadian Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife officials say that, if Bill Lishman does not sign an agreement to stop 
taking geese and other waterfowl up into the air lanes, they will confiscate 
his 18 geese. They gave him until Friday to sign. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm prepared to let him keep his birds as long as he keeps them under wire," 
said Joe Carreiro, the service's chief of wildlife conservation and 
environmental quality. "If he lets them fly, he loses them." 
</P>
<P>
Lishman and a colleague, Canadian nature-lover Bill Carrick, were the subject 
of a story in The Times last May. After their success with geese, the two had 
hoped to use ultralight aircraft to teach rare trumpeter swans to migrate south 
for the winter, something trumpeters are believed to have done once but which 
they ceased doing after the arrival of Europeans and gunpowder in North America 
nearly wiped them out. The Wildlife Service has already confiscated a flock of 
hybrid swans that the men were keeping on a lake outside Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
Carreiro said Lishman and Carrick had imported swan eggs from the United States 
without the proper papers. He said also that, by flying the geese from one 
place to another, Lishman might muddy the genes of the 35 known subvarieties of 
Canada geese in North America. In addition, Carreiro said that, because the 
geese were "imprinted" on Lishman and his ultralight, they would never lead 
normal lives. 
</P>
<P>
"What is the future of these birds?" he asked. "They won't even breed." 
</P>
<P>
Lishman said he did get egg import permits from Canada but had failed to get 
the corresponding egg export permits from the United States. He denied that by 
flying with the geese he was introducing them into new habitats. "They return 
with me, and I put them back in the cage each time," he said. As for the 
question of breeding, he said some of his geese had flown south for the winter 
and returned with "their boyfriends." 
</P>
<P>
"The Canadian Wildlife Service's nose is out of joint because they think we 
didn't consult with them soon enough," he said. "I think they just got jealous 
about the whole thing. We're stealing their glory; that's the way it seems to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
To avoid confiscation of his geese, Lishman said he plans to have moved the 
birds by Friday to an undisclosed marshland where the owner has a valid 
avicultural permit.

<LEADPARA>  The fowl cholera epidemic at Lake Elizabeth has hit domestic geese so hard
that only 16 to 18 of the white or gray birds are still alive, compared with a
one-time high of 90, according to Fremont officials.;    But the epidemic has
not moved through the wild Canada geese population, leading officials to
believe the brown and black birds may be more resistant to the disease. Only a
handful of those birds have died in recent weeks, and that may be due to
natural causes, according to Patrick Hayes, Fremont's environmental services
supervisor. No other species have died of the disease.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Canada geese spared;  "We have not seen any kind of excessive (death) rate
in Canada geese," Hayes said. "We continue to believe they are not being
affected.";    Park officials first noticed something was amiss in early
April, after they started to pick up a half dozen domestic goose carcasses a
week. Judy Felber, a park and animal services officer, sent a carcass to the
University of California at Davis, where a scientist diagnosed the malady as
fowl cholera. The disease is a common one, and can decimate thousands of birds
in a brief period of time.;    It is not dangerous to humans.;    State
wildlife officials believe overcrowding at the lake is to blame for the
outbreak, and have urged the city to stop selling birdseed, something Fremont
is not willing to do.;    Plentiful food;  More than 2,500 birds live at Lake
Elizabeth, 450 of which are wild Canada geese. Even though those are migratory
birds, they stay around because food is plentiful.;    Fremont officials have
reduced the amount of birdseed they sell each week, but only because the bird
population has dropped, Hayes said.;    If all the domestic geese die, the
city has no plans to replace them, he said.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal by Alaska Natives on Bird-Hunting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
Alaska natives who want to hunt migratory birds in the spring and
summer.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that treaties
between the United States and other nations generally ban the
hunting between March 10 and Sept. 1.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last October ruled in
favor of conservationists who challenged the right of the Alaska
natives to kill migratory waterfowl for food during the offseason.
   The appeals court said the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act of
1918 limits hunting of the birds to those periods approved in
related treaties between the United States and other nations.
   The government has entered treaties with Canada, Mexico, Japan
and the Soviet Union.
   The Canada treaty imposes the strictest limits, essentially
permitting hunting only from Sept. 1 to Dec. 15.
   The Alaska natives, particularly Eskimos living near the
Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, say the birds are an important part of their
diet.
   A sharp decline in the population of Cackling Canada Geese,
White Fronted Geese, Pacific Black Brant and Emperor Geese has
caused conservationists to be concerned about their survival.
   The birds nest and raise their young in the delta during the
spring and summer months and then migrate south in early September.
   The Alaska natives said a 1925 federal law authorizes them to
hunt the birds when needed for food, superseding the earlier
Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
   But the 9th Circuit court said the earlier law still governs the
hunting season. Generally, the season may be extended only if
treaties related to the act are amended to relax the restrictions,
the appeals court said.
   However, the appeals court stopped short of banning all
off-season hunting of the waterfowl. Instead, it ordered a federal
judge to conduct further study to determine whether agreements
between the Alaska natives and the U.S. Wildlife Service violate
the treaty act.
   The most recent agreement, called the 1985 Goose Management
Plan, limits hunting of the birds for food but does not prohibit it
entirely.
   The Reagan administration supported the 9th Circuit court ruling.
   The appeal acted on today was filed by lawyers for the Alaska
natives.
   The case is Alaska Federation of Natives vs. Alaska Fish and
Wildlife Federation, 87-1157.

<P>
Almost 300 years ago, trumpeter swans were so abundant in North America that 
fur trader Antoine Laumet Cadillac, approaching the shore in his pirogue near 
what is now Detroit, mistook their stately masses for a profusion of 
waterlilies. 
</P>
<P>
Soon afterward, alas, someone noticed what good pens the quills of the 
trumpeter swan made, and a great swan kill-off began. By 1932, there were only 
70 trumpeters left in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the trumpeter swan has made a faltering comeback in remote parts of 
North America, but even this modest rebound is imperiled by the bird's 
inability to migrate to its wintering grounds in the eastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
If quill fanciers and hunters failed to wipe out the swan altogether, their 
depredations did erase the bird's knowledge of migration routes, which had been 
passed on through eons from parent to cygnet. 
</P>
<P>
And so it is today that when ornithologists try to repopulate the species by 
releasing trumpeters into the wild, the birds fly off in all directions. Some 
get lost, some get shot, some go north for the winter and starve. The clever 
ones get on by hanging around the warm-water waste pools of power plants. 
</P>
<P>
"When they're not raised by their natural parents, they're morons," Harry 
Lumsden, a retired Ministry of Natural Resources biologist, said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
Lumsden has spent a decade trying to re-establish trumpeter swans in Ontario. 
One good epidemic at one of those sheltering power plants, he said, and a 
sizable percentage of the trumpeter population worldwide would be lost. 
</P>
<P>
David Weaver, executive secretary of the Minnesota-based Trumpeter Swan 
Society, said: "The problem is such that we need to consider everything that 
comes along, no matter how ludicrous it may sound." 
</P>
<P>
Mother Nature, meet Father Goose. 
</P>
<P>
On warm summer days, 51-year-old Bill Lishman can be seen in the skies of 
southern Ontario, skimming over cornfields and pasturelands with a perfect 
chevron of gray and black Canada geese honking along behind him. Lishman has 
trained the geese to fly in formation with his homemade ultralight aircraft, 
after three arduous years of trial and error, busted wings and broken feet. 
</P>
<P>
Now, with the help of Canadian naturalist Bill Carrick, Lishman hopes to take 
trumpeter swans to the air lanes. If the two men succeed in training the 
trumpeters to fly with the ultralight, they will then guide the rare birds back 
to their wintering places on Chesapeake Bay, re-establishing the migration of 
old. 
</P>
<P>
"The theory is extremely sound," said William Sladen, professor emeritus of 
immunology and infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins University and an authority 
on swans and their migratory habits. "We believe the ultralight is the answer." 
</P>
<P>
On 100 acres of fallow pastureland and pine groves here, northeast of Toronto, 
Lishman has for three years been keeping gaggles of goslings in pens by the 
side of a grassy airstrip. By day, in early summer, Lishman jogs up and down 
the runway with his fluffy goslings in hot pursuit. Lishman swings a tape 
recorder on a strap as he runs, blaring the sound of an ultralight engine at 
full throttle. By night, Lishman beds the goslings down under the wing of his 
parked ultralight. His neighbors call him Father Goose. 
</P>
<P>
"Geese need a lot of mothering," Lishman explained. "The more attention you pay 
to them, the more they'll stick with you. You can't just spend five minutes 
with them in the morning and five minutes at night." 
</P>
<P>
By running with the baby geese at least three times a day, every day, he says, 
he accustoms them to the engine's roar, and to his strange, human form. 
</P>
<P>
Lishman is motivated, he says, by a dream he has had since childhood of flying 
with the birds. He was born in 1939 to a biologist mother and a 
fighter-pilot-trainer father, who raised him on a steady diet of 
daring-young-man stories featuring the pilots of Spitfires and Hawker 
Hurricanes in wartime Europe. 
</P>
<P>
When peace came, the Lishman family settled down on a farm. Young Bill would 
spend hours watching the seagulls that trailed after his father's plow, 
daydreaming about fighter planes. As soon as he was old enough, Lishman 
enrolled in the Canadian Air Cadets, but it turned out he was colorblind, and a 
medical panel declared him ineligible to fly. Lishman grew up to become a 
successful sculptor, but he never abandoned his dream of flying with the birds. 
When the first crude hang gliders emerged, in the early 1970s, he bought one, 
added an engine, and began experimenting on a hill behind his house. 
</P>
<P>
While all this was going on in Blackstock, Carrick -- himself a World War II 
pilot -- had begun making nature movies. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy animals and being outdoors, and I could never figure out why nobody 
else does," he said, slogging from pond to pond during an interview on a 
marshy, nine-acre nature preserve he keeps just outside of Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, Carrick got a contract to provide the animals for a film about "Gray 
Owl," a British naturalist who lived with Indians in the Canadian wild and 
wrote vividly about the antics of beavers. Carrick introduced half a dozen 
beavers to his preserve and, for realism's sake, threw in assorted waterfowl. 
He even built a wind tunnel for the birds to fly in on camera, and he set about 
"imprinting" the ducks, geese and beavers that would star in the film. 
</P>
<P>
"Imprinting" is a technique developed by Konrad Lorenz, the Nobel Prize-winning 
Austrian pioneer of ethology, the study of animal behavior. Lorenz, who kept a 
houseful of fish, fowl and wild animals, observed that baby birds instinctively 
followed the first large creature that moved away from them after they hatched. 
The hatchlings formed a parental bond with that creature, he wrote, 
"imprinting" themselves upon it. 
</P>
<P>
Carrick, an admirer of Lorenz, adopted the Austrian's technique to get his 
geese up and flying in the wind tunnel. His children amused themselves by 
training the imprinted geese to fly behind their bicycles. One goose even took 
to flying behind a friend's car, Carrick says. A local newspaper told of these 
goings-on, and the wishful Lishman read of them excitedly. 
</P>
<P>
"He called me up," Carrick recalled. "He said he'd been flying for years and 
years. He asked me if geese would follow an airplane. I said, 'No reason why 
not.' " 
</P>
<P>
Soon, the two men had formed a loose partnership. 
</P>
<P>
The first summer, Lishman imprinted a dozen geese to fly behind his motorcycle, 
assuming they would make an easy transition to the ultralight. He assumed 
incorrectly: In one early experiment, a goose hit the ultralight's propeller, 
breaking the prop and splintering the bird's wing. The next spring, Lishman 
started over with a fresh batch of goslings, and a redesigned, goose-friendly 
aircraft. But this time, on the maiden flight, a carburetor valve stuck, the 
engine stalled, and Lishman tumbled into a ditch and broke his foot. He spent 
six weeks in a cast. 
</P>
<P>
The third year, Lishman designed and built yet another ultralight and imprinted 
yet another gaggle of goslings. Each day, he said, he hauled himself out of bed 
before sunrise, fed the geese, ran with them and played the sound of the 
ultralight engine for them. He would taxi up and down the airstrip, the birds 
flapping along behind. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, one day, he decided the birds were ready to fly. He taxied down the 
airstrip, revved the engine a few times to attract the geese's attention and 
opened the throttle as they burst out of the gate. Lishman pulled up, executed 
a 90-degree turn and looked back to see the geese far below, flapping madly in 
an effort to catch up. He eased back to 20 m.p.h., just above stalling speed, 
and the geese came up alongside, forming a ragged chevron off his wing. 
</P>
<P>
Below, on the ground, his wife and children cheered. A friend filmed the scene 
with a video camera, making what was to be an award-winning documentary that 
will be shown at the National Educational Film and Video Festival, in San 
Francisco, on May 26. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back at his preserve, Carrick was spinning more ideas. A member of 
the Trumpeter Swan Society, he knew the difficulties swan lovers were having in 
restoring trumpeters to their native habitat. As the trumpeter swan had died 
out, it had been replaced with mute swans imported from Europe, "the ones you 
see in parks and on toilet paper," Carrick sniffed. 
</P>
<P>
To the uninitiate, mute swans may make a lovely sight, but North American bird 
lovers consider them an unacceptable substitute for the trumpeters. Mute swans, 
by definition, lack the trumpeter's sonorous call; they hiss a lot. They are 
also aggressive, known to catch goslings and ducklings and make a meal of them. 
</P>
<P>
Ontario, and some American states, have been running discreet programs to 
dethrone the mute swan and bring back the trumpeter. They send field workers to 
find mute swan nests, take out the eggs, shake them to kill the embryos, and 
return them, along with a few trumpeter eggs, to the nests. The idea is to make 
the mute swans unwitting foster parents to the baby trumpeters. 
</P>
<P>
This gambit doesn't always work. Trumpeter eggs, for one thing, cost $200 
apiece, and they don't always hatch. Then, the white hatchling trumpeters have 
to be caught by biologists and dyed the dusky color of mute cygnets, so the 
"parents" don't reject them. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, if the trumpeters are lucky enough to reach maturity, there is no one 
to teach them the old migration routes. 
</P>
<P>
Knowing all this, Carrick got to thinking that as long as Lishman had trained 
geese to fly with his aircraft, he might just as well train trumpeter swans and 
guide them to safe wintering grounds. When he told Lishman his plan, the 
sculptor was inspired. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Lishman is building a new ultralight that will take off and land on 
floats, since swans, unlike geese, must take off from water. Carrick began 
working out with trumpeter cygnets and a motorboat last year. Sladen, the Johns 
Hopkins swan man, is looking for financial backing and has found a safe 
wintering spot for the first batch of birds, on the grounds of a conference 
center near Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Lishman plans to make a dry run with Carrick's dime-a-dozen geese later this 
summer, and if all goes well, he, Carrick, and a ground crew will embark with 
the precious swans in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be very careful," Lishman said. "With trumpeters, it's a whole 
different ball game. Trumpeters fly much later in the year, so late in the 
season that we might not get the weather (we need). You can't fly ultralights 
in rough weather. 
</P>
<P>
"And when the trumpeters first learn to fly, they're much more awkward than 
geese. You could have a mid-air with one of them very easily." 
</P>
<P>
But Lishman noted that it should take only one successful trip with the 
ultralight to show the birds the way south. After that, the swans will be on 
their own, and he can return to full-time sculpting. 
</P>
<P>
Lovers of the trumpeter swan might argue that Lishman's airborne exertions as 
the man who teaches birds to fly are themselves art of a high order. 
</P>
<P>
"Surely the best art is always functional," says Lumsden, the trumpeter swan 
restoration expert.

   Officials of Franklin Township, N.J., thought they were
doing the right thing, but they've ruffled a lot of feathers.
   Earlier this summer, with permission from the local
recreation committee, the New Jersey Division of Fish, Game
and Wildlife moved 44 Canada geese from Iona Lake to a site
about eight miles away, saying excessive geese droppings had
made the lake dangerous for swimmers.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "When you have to choose between people and geese, you
have to choose people every time," says township Mayor Harry
J. Kennedy.
   However, squawking-mad geese fans demanded that the birds
be brought back. They presented a 30-name petition to a
township meeting last month, but to date the board hasn't
acted on their protest.
   Lucia Buttner, a resident with a home by the lake who
helped spearhead the petition drive, accused the state of
taking an extreme action without consulting the neighbors.
"It was almost a violation," she says. "They came into my
domain, my home and surroundings and took something without
my permission."
   Mrs. Buttner, who enjoys watching geese go through their
annual routine of raising their goslings, says she is "not an
animal activist" but believes "we have to learn to live with
nature."
   Nature in the form of geese excrement, however, sickens
beachgoers. "Have you seen the size of their droppings?" asks
Carolyn Toy, a township secretary.
   Fred Ferino, the state's principal wildlife biologist,
says New Jersey's resident geese population has more than
quadrupled in the past decade. "Everyone wanted them out of
there," he says, referring to the Iona Lake flock. Besides,
the transfer "doesn't hurt the geese." The bad publicity,
however, hasn't pleased state officials. "They're looking at
the petition and giving me hell about it," Mr. Ferino adds.
   Opponents of the move say the geese aren't entirely to
blame for the lake's problems. They cite steadily decreasing
water levels caused by too little rain, too much hot weather
and a leaking dam.
   Carol Colburn, secretary of the recreation committee, says
the town has had continuing problems with the geese since
1983 and this year has just been especially bad. "They're
very dirty birds," she complains. "I wouldn't want them in my
yard."
   But angry residents still question the transfer. Says one,
Lee Glanton, "I put up with some absolute bores in my life --
why can't I tolerate some geese?"

<TEXT>     Feeding the ducks and geese at Lake Elizabeth is a popular activity in
Fremont, but one that has recently taken on a slight risk. During the past two
months, more than 50 of the domestic geese at the lake and five of the Canada
geese have died in an outbreak of fowl cholera.;    Despite this high
mortality rate, the bacteria that carry the cholera are not considered a
threat to people, according to the county health department and a number of
wildlife experts around the state.;    "There are very few things that birds
get that humans are susceptible to, and humans do not get fowl cholera," said
Dr. Francine Bradley, a poultry farm adviser for the Northern California
Cooperative Extension at the University of California, Davis.;    There is a
small risk of a minor skin infection -- but only if the bird's blood or saliva
mixes with human blood, which is not an easy thing to do, said Dr. David
Jessup, a veterinary medical officer for the state Department of Fish and
Game. While this could happen if a goose bit and tore a person's skin, it is
unlikely, he said.;    While city and state officials are not worried about
humans suffering from the fowl cholera, they are concerned about the bird
population at the lake. More than 2,500 birds live there, and all are
potentially susceptible to fowl cholera. So far, no other species has come
down with the disease.;    Officials can do little to prevent the spread of
the disease. There is a vaccine, but it works only for chickens and turkeys,
not geese, Jessup said. The best way to check the disease is to remove the
bird carcasses quickly and check for sick-looking geese, Bradley said. Over a
period of time, the disease should subside.;    The real problem may be
crowding at the lake, said Brian Hunter, regional manager of the Department of
Fish and Game. When so many fowl gather in one place, it can cause stress.
That may trigger the fowl cholera bacteria, which usually lie dormant in the
birds.;    The state has urged Fremont to reduce its domestic geese population
to alleviate the crowding, Hunter said. By law, the city cannot touch the
Canada geese because they are migratory birds and are protected by
international law.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  More than half of the 90 domestic geese at Fremont's Lake Elizabeth died over
the past two months in a mysterious outbreak of fowl cholera -- a disease
known to suddenly wipe out huge flocks.;    City recreation officials said
they have no reason to think the cholera could harm the many Central Park
visitors who feed the geese or windsurf at the lake every day.  </LEADPARA>

FOWL BACTERIA KILLS DOZENS IN CENTRAL PARK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But a state Department of Fish and Game wildlife biologist said people
should avoid giving geese food by hand, or petting them.;    A Fish and Game
publication called Outdoor Californian says people can get "localized
infections," but not serious illness, from fowl cholera bacteria, said Fish
and Game biologist Terry Palmisano. The bacteria is found in the mucous and
feces of infected birds.;    "I think people need to take some general
precautions," she said. "Don't get out there and pet the geese, or if you have
to feed them, throw it on the ground.";    Palmisano suspects the size of Lake
Elizabeth's goose population, which at times numbers more than 500, may have
triggered the disease. She has urged city officials to try to prevent people
from feeding the birds. Giving them food encourages more geese to stay at the
lake.;    But Fremont animal services director Leonard Maitland said the geese
are important to the people of Fremont, and the city wants to avoid removing
them or imposing feeding controls.;    "From a public relations perspective,
we don't want to round up the geese," he said. "They are a recreational
resource. They're an activity for people who visit the park. If you are one of
those people who comes to Lake Elizabeth to feed a particular goose and you
come and find it gone, you are going to ask about it. And we're under heavy
scrutiny.";    Palmisano said the public would react more favorably to a
feeding ban than to a cholera epidemic. "The public likes to feed wildlife, so
it poses a public relations problem for the city to say they can't," she said.
"But cholera is a P.R. problem too. Nobody wants to see a bunch of dead geese
around.";    City park officials have notified state Fish and Game officers
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service about the cholera outbreak, which was
confirmed last week by University of California, Davis veterinarians.;    So
far, city officials are unsure how to deal with the problem. Fearing they may
make the wrong move and worsen the problem, they have refrained from taking
action except to continue watching for dead geese and removing carcasses. The
state and federal agencies are expected to offer guidance on how to combat the
disease.;    This is the first time cholera has broken out at Lake Elizabeth,
officials believe. Palmisano said none of the other wetlands in the area have
reported the disease.;    About 50 of the 90 domestic geese -- the white or
gray birds with orange beaks -- have died at Lake Elizabeth in the past two
months, said Judy Felber, Fremont park and animal services officer. In
addition, about five of the approximately 425 Canada geese -- the big brown
birds with sleek dark necks and white underbellies, also have died. The
cholera apparently hasn't spread to any of the ducks.;    Felber said it was
not unusual to see a dead goose once in a while at the lake. But she became
concerned about the beginning of April when she noticed as many as a
half-dozen carcasses each week.;    Felber contacted UC-Davis, where Dr.
Francine Bradley, a bird specialist, offered to investigate, but birds had
been dead too long to send them for an autopsy to discover the bacteria. About
a month later, Felber said, a park visitor noticed that one of the white geese
was flapping its wings wildly and couldn't stand up.;    "By the time we got
there, the goose was dead," Felber said. She immediately sent the bird to
UC-Davis, where veterinarians found fowl cholera in the body. A second dead
goose was sent at the end of May, and also showed the bacteria.;    Though
only two cases have been confirmed, city park officials suspect the cholera
has swept through half of the domestic goose population.;    Felber said a
doctor at UC-Davis indicated humans can carry the bacteria, but not come down
with fowl cholera. In a statement about the epidemic released Friday, Felber
said the cholera "is not a public health threat.";    Fowl cholera is
notorious for spreading quickly through flocks of birds crowded into small
areas, according to fish and game officials. It has proved devastating to some
turkey farms and wildlife refuges. The state loses 5,000 to 70,000 birds each
year to the disease, Palmisano said.;    No one knows what starts the
epidemic. But Palmisano said it is believed geese can be silent carriers of
the disease, and stress -- possibly caused by crowded conditions -- can
activate the bacteria. It then spreads to other birds.  </TEXT>

   Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. agreed to support a
research project to help track migratory patterns of snow
geese in the Pacific flyway.
   In its first major contribution to U.S. environmental
concerns, the Japanese telecommunications company and its
U.S. unit NTT America will donate about $300,000 in equipment
and material to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the
project.

   NTT has developed an ultralight radio transmitter which
will be attached to the snow geese, and monitored by
satellite.
   In August, researchers plan to tag 30 snow geese that are
breeding in the Arctic Circle on Wrangle Island. Scientists
then hope to track the birds' migration from the Soviet Union
over Alaska and Canada to British Columbia and California.
Next February, researchers will place transmitters on another
30 snow geese to track their return journey. The research is
intended to help find ways to protect the dwindling bird
population.

<HEAD>Gander In Love With Gracie The Cow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENEVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George is a gander in love, but the
object of his affection is indifferent to his attentions and might
not even notice if she stepped on him.
   George, a Canada goose, is hung up on a black cow named Gracie
in an odd- couple courtship rivaling that of Jessica the cow and
her moose.
   Farmer Al Jones first noticed the peculiar relationship during
the goose mating season last year.
   ``There at the first last spring, I just figured old George had
been out in the spring sun too long. I couldn't help but notice how
he would follow the cow everywhere she went,'' Jones said. ``He
even started sleeping with her.''
   Jones said he was the only one who noticed and didn't tell
anyone else.
   George eventually came to his senses, but when he started up
again earlier this spring Jones told his wife and daughter about
the bird's bizarre love life.
   They thought it was a joke, but Jones told them to look for
themselves.
   ``He just follows her around like that's his mate,'' said Jones'
daughter, Sarah, 20.
   George wants nothing to do with the rest of the large flock of
geese on the farm and doesn't show an interest in any other cow but
Gracie, Jones said.
   ``And I would notice how old George would try to flirt and carry
on with Gracie,'' he said. ``Why he would get right up in her face
and make the strangest rackets you've ever heard, like he was
trying to get the cow to come fly away with him.''
   Ms. Jones said she doesn't think George would try to hurt anyone
who interfered, although the bird did charge a newspaper reporter
who tried to get close enough to snap a photograph.
   ``When it started over this spring, he seemed bolder and more
romantic than last year,'' Jones said.
   George has been a member of the flock at Jones' farm for about
five years, Ms. Jones said. She thinks he was hatched there, but
it's hard to tell because the flock is large and gets mixed up with
migrating geese making pit stops.
   Gracie, meanwhile, doesn't take an active part in the
relationship.
   ``George calls all the shots and does all the flirting,'' Jones
said. ``Gracie just goes along to see what will happen next.''
   Gracie's attitude mirrors that of Jessica, a Hereford cow in
Shrewsbury, Vt., who was courted for 76 days from in the fall and
winter of 1986-87 by a lovesick bull moose.

<LEADPARA>  The epidemic of fowl cholera that decimated domestic geese at Lake Elizabeth
has stopped, but the disease could strike again this winter.;    No geese have

environmental services supervisor.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I don't know if it stopped 'cause it's summer or whether all the birds
that were susceptible are dead," Hayes said.;    In three months, the disease
killed 68 domestic geese and a handful of Canada geese that live in the lake,
the centerpiece of the city's Central Park. The disease is not harmful to
humans.;    Fowl cholera is notorious for devastating flocks that are crowded
into a small area. The National Wildlife Health Research Center in Madison,
Wis., has advised the city that avian cholera is a seasonal disease that
occurs in heavy concentrations of fowl. Hayes said the disease usually breaks
out in cold weather and doesn't persist in summer.;    "We can assume if we
maintain the same kind of conditions we will get more outbreaks," Hayes said.;
   State wildlife officials have urged the city to stop selling birdseed to
reduce the population, but, so far, the city is not willing to impose such a
ban.;    For the past several years the city has been trying to manage the
bird population -- about 2,500 -- by disturbing some species during mating and
disrupting their nests, Hayes said. The disease has drastically reduced the
number of domestic geese, too.;    Hayes is discussing other measures with
state and federal wildlife officials. Recommendations will be forwarded this
year to the city council.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   What's bad for the goose is good for this
northern North Dakota community that has more geese than people,
according to organizers of this week's GooseFest.
   Former Minnesota Vikings football coach Bud Grant will be the
first person inducted Wednesday night into the ``Goose Hunters Hall
of Fame.' He came to Kenmare last year to hunt and liked it so much
he wanted to come back, business leaders said.
   They're hoping others will do the same.
   ``If we get too many people for the motel, we've got farmers
that'll house them. We'll take all we can get. We'll find places
for them,'' Archie Kress promised.
   Whyagoosefest?
   Kenmare, with a population of about 1,200, bills itself as the
``Snow Goose Capital of North Dakota.'' Surrounded by three
wildlife refuges, it is home to thousands of snow geese for several
weeks during the birds' fall migration.
   `I've talked to people from the refuges last Wednesday and there
were about 350,000,'' Kress said Monday.
   The hunters wait for the geese to wander off refuge land into
nearby fields to catch grain stubble left after harvest. State law
allows hunters to kill seven geese a day from sunrise until noon.
   ``It's not that easy to go out there and shoot seven geee,''
Kress said. ``They seem to know when it's noon. We've even thought
about trying to sound the noon siren at another time to get them to
come out earlier.''

   Call him persistent, call him tenacious,
or call him what co-workers at a computer company dubbed him after
a three-year struggle to rid the plant grounds of geese: ``Mr.
Goosebuster.''
   Norm Heifetz, 52, facilities manager of the Bytex Corp., has
become a minor celebrity. Employees presented him with a ``Mr.
Goosebuster'' plaque and goosebuster emblems can be spotted
throughout the company, Heifetz said. Heifetz' picture even
appeared on the front page of a local newspaper.
   His fame came after he waged war with the pesky geese, which
filled the man-made pond at the plant and, even worse, ``strolled
all over the grounds.''
   ``They come and proliferate and have babies and they make a holy
mess of the property,'' he said. ``They like young, fresh grass so
they go grazing all day long. It wouldn't have been so bad if they
stayed out back but they came strolling on the sidewalk near the
front entrance.''
   At first, he banged pots and pans to frighten the geese away.
Then, while researching the problem, he learned that geese are
``deathly afraid of swans'' and bought ``a bunch of fake ones.''
   Nothing worked.
   Last year, when the geese returned in late spring, Heifetz began
a new plan of attack. He wired up huge speakers and blared distress
calls over the pond. Still, the geese remained.
   Then Heifetz tried a small, remote-controlled boat. Success at
last.
   ``It made a terrible noise and chased them out,'' he said.

   A man's toothless technique earned him a
clam-eating contest victory and possible world record as he downed
397 of the mollusks in eight minutes.
   Dave Barnes of Sequim, a roofer who has been eating the bivalves
in competition for 16 years, already holds the record listed in the
``Guinness Book of World Records'' of 424 clams in eight minutes.
   That record, set in 1975 at Port Townsend, included a one-minute
break in the contest. Tuesday's eating of steamed clams, sponsored
by Ivar's Acres of Clams restaurant on Seattle's waterfront, was
non-stop. Contest spokesman Barry Bartlett said Barnes' performance
also will be submitted to the record book.
   Barnes said he had an advantage over competitors: He took out
his false teeth and let the clams slide down unobstructed.
   In second place was Glen Jones of Kent, who ate 306 clams.
   The 12 contestants downed a total of 2,615 steamed clams.

<TEXT>     Millions of birds use these flyways twice a year, during the spring and
fall migrations. From as far away as Siberia and Alaska, countless birds --
fattened during the long days of summer -- head south each fall to their
winter homes in Mexico and Central and South America. In the spring they
return.;   More than two million ducks and geese migrate to the basin each
fall to rest and feed before heading farther south. When spring arrives, the
call of tundra swans fills the air as thousands stop once again to rest and
feed before heading north.;   But there are many other species of birds and
wildlife -- 511 to be exact -- in the Klamath Basin.;   Some refuges are
easier to get to than others, but all are excellent for wildlife viewing. They
offer a wide range of habitats -- grasslands and meadows, vast marshes,
coniferous forests, sagebrush and juniper uplands, rocky slopes, open water
and agricultural land.;   (check) Clear Lake National Wildlife Refuge: In
northeast California's Modoc County, it is unimproved and provides habitat for
a range of animals, including the swift pronghorn antelope, which has been
clocked at 55 mph.;   The American white pelican finds prime nesting habitat
at Clear Lake reservoir (not to be confused with Clear Lake, which is just
north of the Bay Area in Lake County). To protect the large birds and their
offspring, this area is closed to the public except in winter.;   (check)
Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge: In 1908, Theodore Roosevelt dedicated
the Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge as the nation's first waterfowl
refuge. Most of this refuge is in California surrounding Lower Klamath Lake,
with some sections reaching into Oregon. California Highway 161 (State Line
Road) goes through the northern portion of the refuge. Consequently you can
observe the wildlife with relative ease.;   (check) Tule Lake National
Wildlife Refuge: At Tule Lake, 11 miles east of Lower Klamath, is the
headquarters for the Klamath Basin refuges. The visitor center has maps, bird
lists, bird updates, a variety of displays and folks to answer questions.;  
The Lower Klamath and Tule Lake refuges are famous for the massive
concentrations of waterfowl that funnel through there each year. Large numbers
of birds usually can be seen there in March and early November. To give you an
idea of the numbers, a one-day official count in 1984 revealed 266,630 geese
and 613,015 ducks in the area.;   There are self-guided auto tours at both
refuges, and some of the birds are so used to cars that they're utterly
unperturbed by them. But stay in your car and use binoculars to get a better
look. You'll feel as though you are sitting amid the flock.;   Imagine driving
along the tour route at Tule Lake, listening to the distant sound of geese
chattering. You jam on the brakes and lift your binoculars for a closer look.
In front of you, 5,000 snow geese lift off the water, circle twice, then land.
A short time later, the restless geese repeat the scenario.;   As you drive
around Tule Lake refuge, watch for eagles and hawks perched on rocks or trees
or soaring above Sheepy Ridge. Look for great horned owls, too. Often they
roost in trees along Hill Road.;   Winters are spectacular in the Klamath
Basin. Temperatures drop to below freezing, sometimes below zero. As lakes ice
over, ducks and geese are concentrated in small pockets of open water.
Hundreds of bald eagles, golden eagles, rough-legged hawks and other hawks
feed on the dead and dying waterfowl.;   The largest population of wintering
bald eagles in the lower 48 states arrives in the Klamath Basin each December.
Most of the eagles stay until March, when they head north to their feeding and
breeding grounds in British Columbia, other Canadian provinces and Alaska.;  
(check) Bear Valley National Wildlife Refuge: Each year, the Audubon Society
sponsors a Bald Eagle Conference here, usually in February when the eagle
population swells. The three-day conference, designed for hobbyists and
professionals alike, consists of wildlife films, workshops, lectures and field
trips.;   Participants meet near the tiny town of Worden, Ore., on U.S.
Highway 97, to watch the eagles fly from their secluded roosting areas. One
morning in February 1985, 369 bald eagles flew from this roost. Equally
amazing were the 552 eagles counted on the ice at the Tule Lake National
Wildlife Refuge on a cold January day in 1985.;   In the spring, as the sun
warms the basin, birds seem to be courting everywhere. Hundreds of pairs of
ducks and geese mate and begin raising their young. Western grebes dance on
the water. Soon, they'll be giving their offspring piggyback rides around the
refuge.;   Shorebirds such as the long-legged American avocets and
black-necked stilts nest in the refuges, too. The adorable killdeer will
pretend to have a broken wing if you get too close to the nests or their
young. The closer you get to a nest, the harder they'll try to lure you away
with a woeful cry.;   Surprisingly, white ibises recently began nesting in the
refuge, the first known nesting of white ibises in the area for two decades.; 
 Most bald eagles leave in the spring, but some pairs stay and raise their
families in the basin.;   (check) Upper Klamath and Klamath Forest refuges:
Bald eagles nest primarily near the Upper Klamath and Klamath Forest refuges,
both in southern Oregon.;   Upper Klamath has a canoe trail with canoe rentals
available. Paddling a canoe is a great way to look for red-necked grebes and
wood ducks. Also, keep a sharp eye for osprey and bald eagles feeding on the
lake.;   The Klamath Forest National Wildlife Refuge is located north of Upper
Klamath and has the distinction of providing habitat for two species of birds
-- blue grouse and red crossbill -- found nowhere else in the Klamath Basin
refuge system.;   The bird-watching is excellent, but so is watching other
wildlife. Most numerous are herds of mule deer. In the spring, pronghorn
antelope occasionally can be spotted. Yellow-bellied marmots, a type of
squirrel, live in areas where there are rocky outcrops. If you watch these
animals long enough, you'll see them wrestle and chase one another. But when
danger approaches, the marmot emits a loud whistle to warn the others.; IF YOU
GO . . .; (check) WHEN TO GO -- If you're interested in nesting birds, visit
the Klamath Basin in the spring. During the summer, things slowdown somewhat,
but there is still a lot to see, including pelicans, immature ducks and geese,
and other young waterfowl. Fall brings up to 2 million waterfowl to the area,
a thrilling sight whether for the first or 50th time. In the winter there are
bald eagles, golden eagles, hawks, waterfowl and large herds of deer.;  
(check) WHERE TO STAY -- Klamath Falls, Ore., in the heart of the Klamath
Basin, is an excellent base for visiting all the refuges. Winters are cold but
summers can be warm, with highs in the 80s or 90s.;   RV owners will find a
variety of pleasant campgrounds in the basin. Camping is not permitted in the
refuges but is allowed at Lava Beds National Monument south of Tule Lake (fee
in summer, free in winter) or at one of the private campgrounds in the area.; 
 Motels are available in nearby towns.;   (check) INFORMATION -- Write to

FT  12 SEP 92 / Cookery: What's good for the goose - Seasonal accompaniments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST December, I received a parcel by special overnight delivery from
Worcestershire. Opening it was as much fun as unwrapping a Christmas
present. Inside was a neatly trussed bird from Goodman's Geese, nestling
under folds of waxed paper between fragrant layers of rosemary and sage -
fistfuls of them, not a few puny sprigs.
Rarely has meat looked more appetising. The skin of the bird was not clammy
but dry, not sickly white but pale honey, sure signs of a healthy outdoor
life ranging free in grassy pastures, guzzling corn and pecking at straw.
And alongside the bird were two little boxes, one containing the giblets,
the other filled with solid wodges of rich and delicious goose fat.
The proof is, of course, in the eating. This bird tasted every bit as good
as it looked. Killed in its prime and hung properly it was rich, firm,
gamey, and exactly as Christmas goose should be, nicely matured after
feasting on grain and having put on its 'liberty vest,' a little layer of
fat between skin and flesh to protect against winter chills.
Slightly younger goose, the autumn bird which is said by some to be goose at
its peak, is flavoured a little more delicately. It is less gamey and the
meat is juicier. This so-called Michaelmas goose, once even more popular
than Christmas goose, was the bird that many tenant farmers traditionally
presented to the landlord when paying their quarterly rent in the hope that
they could perhaps dissuade him from increasing it.
I have never eaten Michaelmas goose but I will this year: the memory of last
Christmas's goose has convinced me that this is a bird worth feasting on
more than once a year, and I like the idea of tasting it at different
stages.
Judy Goodman, of Goodman's Geese, has been at the forefront of the
resurgence of interest in geese, a vital fighting force in reinstating goose
on our Christmas menus. Having achieved a good level of Christmas sales, she
now aims to put Michaelmas goose back on the culinary calendar as well.
This year is her 10th growing geese. She began in 1982 after a
gastronomically sad Christmas (in other words, one without goose on the
menu), by growing just a few birds for family and friends. This year,
Goodman's Geese will grace 2,000 tables.
Judy Goodman is the most practical, down-to-earth and business-like farmer
you could hope to meet, a homely, middle-aged woman fairly fizzing with
energy, good humour and marketing ideas.
She admits to a surge of pride at the sight of her geese in the food halls
of Harrods and the Army &amp; Navy stores, and in top-notch butchers such as
Millhouse of Clifton in Bristol; and she rejoices in a gratifying ratio of
repeat purchases and standing orders among personal customers who buy at her
farm gate or by overnight delivery.
The date of Michaelmas seems to be a moveable feast, so why not choose
whatever suits you. September 29 (or the Saturday after) is popular in many
areas; October 11 remains traditional in Norfolk; while the goose-eating
autumn feast in northern Europe is celebrated on Martinmas, November 11. Or
perhaps Hallowe'en or bonfire night commends itself to you.
Given that goose has different eating qualities at different stages of the
season, I like the idea of varying the accompaniments accordingly. Early
autumnal fruits would seem the most appropriate choice for goose in
September - and nothing is flourishing more furiously this September than
plums.
So, I shall probably serve my Michaelmas roast goose at the end of the month
with sloe and apple jelly or perhaps a compote of prunes - the smallest and
bitterest of the plum family, or the largest and sweetest.
The other thought that appeals to me is making a goose-neck pudding. I have
sometimes considered doing so at Christmas but there never seems to be
enough time then. Michaelmas, minus the same pressures, seems a good
opportunity to have a go.
When I mentioned this to Goodman last week she agreed, obligingly, to supply
the goose I was ordering with the whole goose neck in one piece and still
encased in its skin. (It is said to be best to delay stripping the skin from
the neck until you are ready to use it.)
She also expressed willingness to supply Weekend FT readers with whole goose
necks in the same way if so requested - providing she is given good notice
and the orders are for geese to be sent by overnight delivery in September,
October or November. In December she is, unsurprisingly, too busy to prepare
necks in this way.
SLOE AND APPLE JELLY 2 1/4 -2 1/2 lb sloes depending on how plump and juicy
they are;  3/4 lb crab or cooking apples (windfalls will do providing soft
spots are cut out before weighing); granulated sugar; a few bay leaves.
The traditional thing is to delay picking sloes until after a frost, or to
prick them with a silver fork. Modern cooks simply freeze the fruit briefly:
the skins will split as they thaw and so encourage the release of the
juices.
Put the sloes into a pan together with the chopped apples, a couple of bay
leaves and just enough water to cover. Simmer gently until fruit is very
soft. Tip the contents of the pan into a jelly bag suspended over a bowl and
leave to drip overnight.
Measure the juices and reheat them gently, adding warmed sugar at the rate
of 1 1/2 lb per 1pt of juice. When the sugar has melted, fast-boil until
setting point is reached. Pot in small jars adding a bay leaf to each one.
COMPOTE OF PRUNES
When fresh chestnuts are available a little later in the year, 1 lb of them,
roasted and peeled, make a splended addition to this compote - but do not
mix them in until ready to serve.
14 oz large prunes; 1 pt tea (Earl Grey or Lapsang Souchong for preference);
2 star anise; 3 allspice berries; 2 cinnamon sticks; 5 cloves; curls of peel
shaved from an orange; 5 tablespoons of rum or armagnac.
Bruise the spices. Put them into a pan with the tea and bring to a simmer.
Away from the heat, add the prunes, orange peel and spirits. Stir well and
push the fruit well down into the liquid. Cover tightly and leave in a cold
larder for 48-72 hours, stirring occasionally if passing.
When the goose is roasting, strain the prunes, discard the spices and bring
the prune liquor to boiling point. Boil for one minute. Pour the scalding
liquor over the prunes, cover and place in the plate warmer so the fruit is
gently and thoroughly warmed through by the time the compote is served.

Vehicles. My 1956 Chevy panel truck's tags expired on Sept. 30. I did not have
a driver's license so I did not renew the registration on the truck at that
time. When I went into the DMV office on Jan. 14 to get my driver's license, I
picked up a non-operation certificate for my truck and sent it to the DMV. A
week later, I received a note stating that the DMV refused to accept my
certificate. The DMV also sent me a "delinquent registration" notice and
demanded a $10 penalty on top of the $50 registration fee. To avoid any
further hassles, I mailed a $60 check. After cashing my check, the DMV then
sent me a letter stating I could not get my license-plate sticker until I had
a smog certificate for my truck. Smog devices weren't even invented in 1956,
but I did take it to a smog station and paid $39.95 to certify it has no smog
device. I sent this certificate to the DMV and am still waiting for my vehicle
tabs.;    -- Larry Christopherson, Santa Cruz; A  First things first: You now
have the tabs for your truck. Next, we asked the DMV to review your case. A
spokeswoman says your non-operation claim should have been accepted. You will
receive a refund of the $10 penalty plus $6 in pro-rated vehicle fees for the
time your truck wasn't driven.; SAUCE FOR THE GOOSE; Q  We have a wildlife
refuge pond in our mobile-home park. Migratory birds visit our pond for a
short time before they fly on to their next destination. We have three
Hawaiian geese who live at the pond all year. Unfortunately, they tend to eat
the plants and mess up the area around the nearest homes. What can we do to
discourage the birds from eating the plants?;    -- F. Davis, Sunnyvale; A 
Feed them. Fred Botti, a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Department of Fish
and Games, says geese will eat plants when they are hungry. He says if you
start feeding the geese, they should cut back their plant munching. Botti
suggests feeding the geese a mix of grains and seeds. And because the "mess"
is a natural by-product of the food, he says you might confine the geese to a
pen.; REACTION: pOSTAL LEGEND; I  read the March 17 column about "Acrefoot"

<LEADPARA>  FALL WATERFOWL hunting regulations are going to be about the same as last year
-- despite a slight increase in the number of ducks, but a decline in the
number of pintail ducks.;    This year's fall flight of ducks is projected at
60 million, using revised survey methods. This is up slightly from a revised
57 million last year but still well below the average.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DUCK POPULATION TAKES A DIP WELL BELOW AVERAGE

<MEMO>  Venture -- Celebrating the Active Life  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     This compared with a breeding population estimate of 26.5 million, up 6
percent from last year, but 19 percent below the average from 1955-1990.
Biologists consider the breeding population figures more accurate.;    Those
breeding population estimates showed only 1.78 million Northern pintails, a
record low, down 20 percent from last year and 62 percent from the average.;  
 Those numbers had brought the possibility of stricter regulations to protect
pintails, but they were not included in the proposed regulations, which must
get final approval from the secretary of the interior.;    While rains
returned to the Canadian prairies this year, the area where much of the North
American duck population nests, and the number of ponds counted in July was a
record, the rain came too late in the season to help many species.;    "Many
of the ponds don't have much surrounding natural vegetation that ducks need to
nest and hide from predators," said John Turner, director of the Fish and
Wildlife Service.;    It will take a couple years of normal or higher
precipitation, which will make those areas too wet to farm, before the wild
vegetation returns.;    The fall flight of giant Canada geese is expected to
exceed last year's. Most other flights are expected to be similar to 1990. The
Tennessee Valley population is expected to be below average, while the flight
of greater white-fronted geese in the Pacific Flyway will increase slightly
from last year.;    Here are proposals for the Pacific Flyway. California will
set its regulations within this framework.;    Ducks -- A 59-day season is
legal between Oct. 5 and Jan. 5, except in the Columbia Basin Mallard
Management Unit, where the season may be an additional seven days. The daily
limit is four, including no more than three mallards, one hen mallard, one
pintail and either two canvasbacks, two redheads or one each.;    Geese -- A
93-day season is permitted between Sept. 28 and Jan. 19. The daily limit is
six, including no more than three white geese (snow, blue and Ross') and three
dark geese. In California, Oregon and Washington, the daily limit is two brant
and is additional to dark goose limits. The season is closed on Aleutian
Canada geese throughout the flyway and on cackling Canada geese in California,
Oregon and Washington.  </TEXT>

   Models in swimwear, athletes in
underwear, sunny beaches, snow-capped mountains _ the kind of
pictures that usually wind up in magazine advertisements are
predictable. So how did the Georgia House of Representatives make
the cut?
   A three-quarter page color picture of the state House appears in
an ad the Insurance Information Institute ran in Time, Newsweek,
U.S. News and World Report, Fortune and Forbes magazines last month.
   It reads, ``To stop auto insurance rates from going up, we're
going House to House.''
   ``I'd rather not see my ugly features in any picture, but I
can't stop them from doing it,'' said House Speaker Tom Murphy,
explaining that anyone can take pictures in the House.
   A spokesman for the Boston ad agency that handled the ad said
the picture of Georgia legislators was a ``stock picture'' chosen
for no specific reason.
   Charles Clark, an executive vice president for the institute,
declined to say whether the Georgians were the most attractive of
the state legislators.
   ``That I don't know,'' he said, laughing. ``We just picked the
most attractive photo we could find.''

   They'll never draw the thousands of
tourists who flock to see the swallows return to Mission San Juan
Capistrano, but the geese have returned to Capitol Beach.
   In late June, about 100 geese were rounded up and shipped off by
the state Game and Parks Commission. Game and Parks worker Frank
Andelt predicted at that time ``they'll be back. I'm not so sure
that it'll be the same geese, but geese will be back.''
   State workers inspected last week and found a new gaggle,
without the identification bands used to tag the ones shipped 160
miles southwest because they were bombarding Capitol Beach yards
and water with unhealthy fallout.
   Capitol Beach residents are worried they'll have the same
problems again, but have mixed feelings.
   ``Everybody seems to be quite happy that we have geese back
here,'' said Marjorie Reid, secretary of the Capitol Beach
Community Association. ``We'll just have to wait until next spring
to see how many stay around.''
   Joe Gabig, waterfowl biologist at Game and Parks, said, ``I'm
almost sure some geese will stay,'' because it is a suitable
habitat. He said relocating the new birds would be very difficult
this time of year. Geese can only be collected easily when adults
are molting and goslings are too young to fly.

   A state House committee shot down a
tongue-in-cheek bill calling for 100 of the geese that winter on the
lake outside the Capitol building to sacrifice their lives to
finance a fancy legislative retreat.
   ``I think you could call this a golden goose of legislation,''
Rep. Roger Porch, a sponsor of the joke bill, said Tuesday as fowl
puns and charges of featherbedding flew higher than migrating geese.
``I hope the committee will take a good gander at this bill.''
   The measure called for a special hunting season that would allow
100 out-of-state residents to pay $10,000 apiece for licenses
permitting them to kill a Capitol Lake goose. The revenue would be
used to build a hunting lodge for lawmakers on nearby Oahe
Reservoir, Porch said.
   By the end of each legislative session, lawmakers need a retreat
because they suffer from shaking hands, ringing ears and blurred
vision and are just basically down, said Porch.
   ``It's known as goose down. Some people actually quack up,'' the
lawmaker said.
   The bill's other sponsor, Rep. Ed Olson, said he had polled the
geese on the lake and they assured him they were willing to take
part in the special season. To back Olson's claim, a woman dressed
up in a goose costume urged the House Agriculture and Natural
Resources Committee to approve the special hunting season.
   ``If anyone is dumb enough to pay $10,000 for a hunting license,
are they going to be able to shoot any of us?'' said the goose,
introduced as Gloria Gander. ``I don't think so.''

   Two black bear clubs
apparently abandoned by their mother are thriving on goat's milk,
baby formula and lots of human attention.
   The week-old female cubs, about the size of a palm, were
discovered by loggers Mike Dumoulin and Carman Watson two weeks ago
after a falling tree disturbed their den near Terrace, about 430
miles northwest of Vancouver, British Columbia. The mother never
returned.
   ``They would have died if we hadn't taken them,'' Dumoulin said
Tuesday.
   Each logger took one of the blind, bald cubs home with him, with
Watson christening his Little Bear and Dumoulin naming his Baby.
   The bears' bare bottoms are wrapped in diapers, and they are fed
goat's milk and baby formula every four hours.
   ``When Mike brought this bawling baby home I just had to help it
fight for its life,'' said Dumoulin's wife, Melanie.
   ``The cub sounds and responds just like a baby. She likes her
tummy rubbed. And there are dirty diapers to wash, of course.''
   It is illegal to take an animal from the wild, but ``in Mike's
case he had a valid reason,'' said Terrace conservation officer
Terry McGunigle.
   The cubs will be sent to the Vancouver Game Farm next month.

STATE EXPERTS SAY THEY DID NOT URGE KILLING OF POLLIWOG PARK ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California Department of Fish and Game biologists recommended that 83 ducks and 
geese at Manhattan Beach's Polliwog Park be quarantined but did not suggest 
that they be killed, an agency official said this week. 
</P>
<P>
The waterfowl were killed Sept. 7, according to Los Angeles County Animal 
Control officers, after Manhattan Beach officials, preparing to make 
improvements to a pond in the park, sought advice from state biologists on what 
to do with the wildlife there. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Concerns Voiced Over Killing 
</P>
<P>
Since then several residents and some City Council members have voiced concerns 
over the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Giusti, an associate biologist for the Department of Fish and Game in 
Long Beach, said he advised Manhattan Beach officials that the birds might 
carry several diseases, including botulism, and advised that they not be moved 
to another open pond. 
</P>
<P>
"We said that transferring them might create the potential for disease 
transmission," Giusti said. "We told them, 'Hold them at the site if possible 
or give them to individuals,' " Giusti said he had not visited the park. 
</P>
<P>
City staff, after hearing of the possibility of disease, ordered the birds 
killed. It is uncertain whether any birds actually were diagnosed as carriers. 
Lt. Marvin Stitts of County Animal Control said, however, "To my knowledge, 
they were not diseased." 
</P>
<P>
Walton Wright, a naturalist for the city of Torrance, said he has heard of no 
recent outbreaks of diseases among such bird populations in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Kelly, director of the Manhattan Beach Department of Public Works, which is 
in charge of the project, refused to take calls on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Manhattan Beach started the $426,000 project about three weeks ago to improve 
the pond's water quality. Workers drained the pond to install a new liner and 
retaining wall and will construct a redesigned bypass channel to divert 
polluted runoff. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County Animal Control officers from Carson removed the birds and 
put them to sleep by injection. 
</P>
<P>
Officials later discovered that several ducks had escaped capture. Four were 
taken last week to the city yard at 3621 Bell Ave. They are being held in a 
fenced-off area that includes sand and a small wading pool. 
</P>
<P>
Before the waterfowl were killed, the city tried to find homes for them through 
an Adopt-a-Duck program. Many had been pets before they had been abandoned at 
the park. Only one person agreed to accept one of the birds. 
</P>
<P>
Giusti said Fish and Game officials had no objections to the adoption program 
because, in most cases, the ducks and geese would have been placed in areas 
where they would be isolated from other large bird populations and could not 
transmit disease. 
</P>
<P>
More ducks and geese will be placed in the park when construction is complete 
on the pond, expected to be by the end of the year, said Ralph Luciani, 
Manhattan Beach director of administration and community services. He did not 
know how many would be replaced, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Many residents were irate last week when they heard that the birds had been 
killed. Mayor Pat Collins said she has received about half a dozen calls. The 
Department of Public Works has received more than 20 calls, Luciani said. 
</P>
<P>
Wright said that, if the birds were healthy, "I think if one did enough 
telephoning around you could find a pond to put them in." 
</P>
<P>
"Every place that there has been any discussion of getting rid of animals, 
there's always been a public outcry," he said. "You have to look at the options 
you have, but you can't ignore the public sensitivity to it." 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Collins said the City Council did not know of the situation until after 
the fact. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there's any action we can take at all," she said. "The deed has 
already been done. It was an unfortunate incident."

RUBBER DUCKIE PLEA FAILS TO SWAY COUNCIL TO LET TAME BIRDS IN POND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GERALD FARIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manhattan Beach City Councilwoman Pat Collins populated her corner of the City 
Council dais with ducks Tuesday evening. They were a fanciful, toy flock she 
brought in a shopping bag. 
</P>
<P>
A large duck doll wore a dress of appropriate holiday red. Another came as a 
candy dish, and there was even a yellow rubber duckie. 
</P>
<P>
The toys were the councilwoman's silent supporters as she tried to persuade her 
colleagues to again permit some white domestic ducks at the Polliwog Park pond, 
which is undergoing a thorough cleaning and rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to maintain the spirit of children feeding the ducks and of people who 
want to go down to ponder and see the ducks," Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
But while the rest of the council found Collins' ploy amusing, no one backed 
her proposal. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of the council approved a new Polliwog pond animal policy aimed at 
returning the park to what it was intended to be -- a habitat for migratory 
water fowl passing by on the Southern California flyway. 
</P>
<P>
Only migratory and transient wildlife may take up residence under the new 
rules, and nature talks and tours on the park's ecosystem and animal life will 
be conducted. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Bob Holmes said it was the overpopulation of domestic ducks -- and 
their prolific production of excrement -- that polluted the pond and made 
reconstruction necessary. Collins, however, said she wasn't talking about 60 or 
80 ducks, but maybe a dozen. 
</P>
<P>
Collins' call for some domestic animals at the pond stems from September's 
furor over the killing of 83 ducks and geese by Los Angeles County animal 
control officers. The birds had to be removed so the pond could be rebuilt, and 
there was concern that they could carry diseases from the buildup of bacteria 
in the pond, city officials said. Three escaped the killing and were rounded up 
later. They are now kept in a pen at the city maintenance yard. 
</P>
<P>
Recalling the furor in September, Collins said, "We had duck fever and I was 
the mayor who received the duck letters from children" saddened by the deaths 
of their feathered friends. 
</P>
<P>
Collins contended the city gave its implied commitment to return some domestic 
ducks to the pond, but city staff members said there were no guarantees and the 
council later called for development of an animal policy. 
</P>
<P>
Once a part of the natural marsh system that stretched from the harbor area to 
Marina del Rey, the pond became a major feature of the 18.5-acre park that 
opened in 1976 at Manhattan Beach Boulevard and Redondo Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
The city envisioned it as a stopping off point for migratory waterfowl, such as 
ducks, geese, herons and egrets. Jim Stecklein, city parks and recreation 
director, said it was intended to provide an inland water experience for 
children and other park visitors. 
</P>
<P>
But within a few years, domestic white ducks began appearing, presumably dumped 
by people getting rid of noisy pets. They, in turn, multiplied, sometimes 
breeding with the wild birds. Stecklein said that at times, there were as many 
as 200 ducks at the pond. 
</P>
<P>
The newly adopted policy prohibits feeding or abandoning animals at the park, 
neither of which has been illegal before. One of the council's arguments 
against Collins' proposal is that a few domestic ducks will encourage the 
abandonment of more. "They'll prime the pump," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
Stecklein concedes that some dumping probably will still occur because the park 
is not fenced. The policy, however, provides for immediate removal of any 
domestic animals, which would be relocated to several designated places, 
including Los Angeles city and county parks and Harbor Lake in Harbor City. Any 
domestic waterfowl eggs found in regular inspections of the park will also go. 
</P>
<P>
The $426,000 pond rehabilitation program, expected to be completed shortly 
after Christmas, has included dredging and removal of accumulated material on 
the bottom of the pond, installation of a cement bottom and border around the 
pond, and relandscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Stecklein said the old pond had a clay bottom that could not be cleaned, unlike 
the new cement bottom. 
</P>
<P>
The city Parks and Recreation Commission held two public forums in connection 
with development of the animal policy. Both were poorly attended, which 
officials found surprising because of the outcry over killing the ducks in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
Stecklein said, however, that those who spoke overwhelmingly favored making 
Polliwog a natural habitat, rejecting an alternate proposal to mix wild and 
domestic birds. The commission also recommended the policy the council adopted. 
</P>
<P>
While rejecting Collins' plea on behalf of the familiar white quackers, the 
council held the door open for another look in the future. 
</P>
<P>
Said Holmes: "I'm not proposing we have a sterile park. If it doesn't become a 
Motel 6 for migratory birds, then we can throw in some domestics."

Corridors -- An agreement to preserve more than 9,500 additional acres of open 
space in Irvine, approved Tuesday by the City Council, includes provisions for 
narrow "spines" of land connecting the parcels to each other and to the 
Cleveland National Forest and Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
Wildlife will use these natural corridors to move between the open spaces, 
biologists say, adding that such passageways will become more vital as Southern 
California's natural areas are reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement with the Irvine Co., Irvine will have more than 16,000 
acres of protected open space. Among the areas protected in the latest deal is 
Quail Hill -- along the San Diego Freeway near Sand Canyon Road -- where 
hundreds of migrating Canada geese spend the winters.

   A Northwest Airlines jet returned to
Kansas City International Airport safely following a collision with
two geese shortly after takeoff, a tower official said.
   The DC-9 hit the geese Wednesday after reaching an altitude of
200 feet, said Ivan Hunt, manager of the KCI control tower. The
plane suffered damage to its nose cone and windshield, he said.
   ``Our guess is they were geese,'' Hunt said. ``And when it's
just two birds like that, they don't show up on radar.''
   Heavy snow was falling at the time of the accident and the geese
were in the clouds, Hunt said.
   Northwest officials would not comment.
   Hunt said no one was hurt, adding that the plane was probably
never in any danger.

<MEMO>  Cover Story; Dave Barry's Holiday Gift Guide  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     GIANT FIBERGLASS GOOSE -- $479.99, from Herter's, 111 E. Burnett St.,
Beaverdam, Wis. 53916, phone (800) 654-3825. Suggested by Bob Garber,
Washington, D.C.;   For a while, in preparing this gift guide, we were
beginning to despair of ever finding the "ultimate" gift concept. But the
moment we saw this item in the Herter's hunting-and-fishing-supplies catalog,
we became so excited that we put our head down on our desk and drooled all
over our telephone-message slips with holiday joy. For we knew that, at last,
we had found the piece de resistance (French, meaning "big false bird").;  
This spectacular item is an imitation goose that looks exactly like a real
goose in every respect except that it's made out of fiberglass and is the size
of a forklift. It has a hinge on its side that permits the top of the goose to
swing open so that a hunter can get inside. Here's what the Herter's catalog
says about it:;   "A proven effective way to stay warm, dry and enjoy goose
and duck hunting success. Of all goose decoy blinds we have tried the GIANT
GOOSE BLIND provides the best comfort, maneuverability and visibility . . .
made of tough fiberglass and has a partial floor to keep you dry and is big
enough for you and your dog. The entire top flips open for easy non-restricted
shooting.";   Judging from this description, and the photographs in the
catalog, we gather that the hunter and his dog are supposed to crouch inside
the giant goose, hiding, and some real geese, migrating down from Canada, are
supposed to come flying along and look down and think: "Hey! There's a goose
down there! It must be safe to land!";   The only problem we have with this
scenario is that, if we were a real goose, and we looked down and saw a giant
mutant goose appearing to weigh well over a thousand pounds, we wouldn't go
anywhere near it. We'd immediately sound the Emergency Honk and migrate the
hell on back to Canada.;   So if the Giant Goose Blind actually works, the
only possible explanation is that geese are the second-stupidest species on
Earth. The stupidest species, of course, is anybody who would get inside the
Giant Goose Blind with a dog.;   However, we do feel that this item has many
practical uses that make it the ideal gift for the person on your holiday list
who wants to conduct discreet surveillance without drawing attention to him or
herself. We had our crack Holiday Gift Research Team field-test the giant
goose by taking it around town and using it in various real-life surveillance
situations. The team reported that the goose was highly effective. It drew
virtually no attention, other than motorists slamming on their brakes,
thousands of passers-by staring and a constant stream of people walking up and
saying: "What the heck is that?";   The Research Team also went to the beach,
and they reported that the giant goose was an extremely effective device for
starting conversations with hot-looking babes.;   "They were just walking up
to us," stated the team. "They really liked the goose.";   This makes us think
that the giant goose might be an ideal gift for the single man on your list.
He could walk into a singles bar, casually set his goose down, order a drink,
and wait for an attractive woman to strike up a conversation, "Say! That's a
big goose you have there, fella!"; (hbox);   CREATIVE USES FOR DEAD
SPORTSMEN'S ASHES -- Various prices, depending on what you want, from Canuck's
Sportsman's Memorials Inc., P.O. Box 3323, Des Moines, Iowa 50316, phone (515)
244-8631. Suggested by Dawn Price and Sheila Mauck of Des Moines, who sent in
a Des Moines Register article about this, written by Jim Pollock.;   This is
the ultimate gift concept for the sportsman on your list who is no longer able
to enjoy hunting or fishing because he has, unfortunately, kicked the bucket.
If you give the sportsman's cremated remains to Canuck's Sportsman's
Memorials, they will, for a price, load the ashes in a shotgun shell, take the
shell on a hunting trip and shoot it at a duck or other game animal of your
choice. We swear we are not making this up.;   We called the president of
Canuck's Sportsman's Memorials, Jay W. Knudsen Sr., and he told us that, in
addition to converting sportsmen into ammunition, his company also offers a
wide variety of other "unique and different methods of ash dispersion.";   For
example, he said, the ashes of one deceased former hunter will be placed in
some duck decoys, which will then be used by the man's former hunting
companions.;   "The decoys will bob among the ones that he used to use," says
Knudsen. "He will be right in the decoy display.";   Knudsen said that one
fisherman, still alive, wants his ashes placed inside fishing lures, which his
family members "will then use for the rest of their lives.";   We're not sure
that our idea of a dignified post-life is to have our Earthly remains
constantly being swallowed and spit out by bass. Nevertheless, we think this
is a truly wondrous, uniquely American holiday gift concept, and we strongly
recommend it.;   By the way: the Canuck's Sportsman's Memorials motto is: "We
can't get you to heaven, but we can land you in the Happy Hunting Ground.";

<HEAD>Federal Judge Issues Ban On Strychnine As Rodent Bait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers and ranchers cannot use strychnine
above ground to control rodents and other pests if the poison would
threaten protected wildlife, a federal judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Diana Murphy said Monday the Environmental
Protection Agency violated federal law in registering strychnine
for above-ground pest control.
   The ruling affects 62 species and subspecies of animals that are
protected under federal law, including grizzly bears, salt marsh
harvest mice, Canada geese, wolves, owls, hawks, California condors
and bald and golden eagles.
   ``It is the most broad-ranging opinion ever issued under the
Endangered Species Act, both in the number of different animals it
protects and the fact that it protects them almost across the
entire United States,'' said Brian O'Neill, a lawyer for three
environmental groups that filed suit.
   Murphy said federal regulations require strychnine-laced baits
be set so that only targeted animals are likly to eat the poison.
   However, she noted, ``Strychnine is non-selective. It kills
anything which ingests a lethal dose. Mortality can occur to both
`target' and `non-target' species.''
   Up to 500,000 pounds of strychnine-laced bait is used annually
to kill pests such as prairie dogs, ground squirrels, meadow mice
and nuisance birds that eat farm crops, according to court
documents. The poison is used mainly in the West, but also in some
Eastern states.
   Murphy said her injunction will remain in effect indefinitely
unless the EPA can demonstrate how it might allow use of the poison
and still prevent the incidental deaths of protected wildlife.
   Murphy said the EPA violated the Endangered Species Act, the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection
Act in registering strychnine.
   The decision did not specify geographical limits for the ban,
but said the poison cannot be used anywhere it would threaten an
protected wildlife. Some protected species, such as Canada geese,
cover wide areas in their annual migrations.
   Charles Shochey, a Justice Department lawyer who represented the
EPA in the case, said Monday that he had not seen Murphy's decision
and could not comment.
   The lawsuit was filed against the EPA in August 1986 by the
Sierra Club, Defenders of Wildlife, and Friends of Animals and
Their Environment.
   The American Farm Bureau Federation, which represents more than
3 million farmers and ranchers, joined the case in support of the
EPA.
   The environmentalists said that at least 24 states reported
posioning of protected wildlife that had either eaten
strychnine-laced bait or the remains of other animals exposed to
the bait.
   Documents given Murphy showed five condors, six peregrine
falcons, 15 golden eagles, 31 bald eagles and 724 other birds and
mammals had died after eating the bait.
   In Minnesota, there were documented reports of deaths from
strychnine poisoning from 1978 to 1983 involving mallard ducks,
snowy owls, a redtailed hawk, a gyrfalcon and a bald eagle, the
environmental groups said.

   Never mind that nonsense about why
chickens cross the road. In this eastern Texas city two ducks and
two geese cross the street every day to get from their hotel to a
fountain.
   About 5 p.m., a manager from The Fredonia escorts the birds
safely through traffic.
   The daily procession has quickly become a popular attraction for
hotel guests.
   ``It's getting to where they'll wait in the lobby,'' said
general manager Jim Boiles. ``They get the biggest bang out of it.''
   Although motorists are sometimes stopped in their tracks, they
don't seem to mind. Often, they wave at the waddling procession.
   The four birds came to the hotel as temporary guests, part of a
petting zoo for the Easter season.
   The geese, Pate and Jimbo, and ducks, Snip and Snap, arrived
when they were only a few days old.
   ``The customers really wanted us to keep them,'' said Cafe
Fredonia manager and ``duck mom'' Donna Crabtree. She said it
didn't take much to persuade Boiles to let the birds stay. They got
a luxurious home next to the lobby.
   She's the one who trained the birds for their street-crossing
routine.
   ``It's grown to be such a tradition,'' Ms. Crabtree said.

FT  04 SEP 93 / Food &amp; Drink: A new Arran malt - Appetisers
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS not every day that a new malt whisky distillery is set up in Scotland.
Indeed, one sees far more of them being mothballed or even demolished. It is
therefore particularly brave of Harold Currie, former managing director of
Chivas Regal, to want to set up new stills on the Isle of Arran, a Hebridean
island between the Mull of Kintyre and the Scottish mainland. There will be
no malt bottled before the year 2001, but for anyone interested, bonds' may
be bought at a cost of Pounds 450 each. These entitle you to a case of
Lochranza blended whisky 1998 (containing whisky from the new distillery on
Arran) and a case of the real thing in 2001. Inquiries to Isle of Arran
Distillers. Tel: 0290-52282. Fax: 0290-50177.

MICHAELMAS goose is back on British menus. Last year, a fair number of
Weekend FT readers were tempted to savour the pleasures of autumn goose,
considered traditionally to be even finer than goose at Christmas.
This year Goodman's Geese is rearing 400 birds which should be ready for the
table in late September and October. What is more, Mrs Goodman has agreed
once again, if so requested by Weekend FT readers, to cut the necks of the
birds in a manner suitable for making goose neck pudding. But this offer
applies only to advance orders for Michaelmas birds to be collected from the
farm or despatched by overnight delivery in September and October. Later in
the year, she will be too busy coping with Christmas orders to prepare goose
necks in this way.
For a copy of my recipe for goose neck pudding, write (enclosing sae) to
Louise Gordon-Foxwell at the Weekend FT. Inquiries and orders to Goodman's
Geese, Walsgrove Farm, Great Witley, Worcester WR6 6JJ. Tel. 0299-896272.

IT ALL BEGAN in my house with Gala, Gala Royal and Braeburn from New
Zealand. All three eat well and are useful for tiding apple addicts over
between one British apple season and the next. My objection is the sticky
name-tapes worn by each and every fruit. It is a nuisance far worse than
refrigerator magnets. Magnets may multiply overnight but at least they know
their place. Apple stickers get everywhere.
Now, the French, Germans and South Africans are at it and British growers
plan to join in this autumn - at the insistence, apparently, of supermarkets
which are reluctant to sell loose apples without individual identification.
The litter problem looks set to grow.

Chris Gonzales is for the birds. 
</P>
<P>
As manager of the Imperial Valley Wildlife Area's Wister Unit, between 
California 111 and the Salton Sea, Gonzales is caretaker of more than 6,000 
acres, on which he has spent many a blistering summer day preparing for the 
autumn arrival of thousands of ducks and geese. 
</P>
<P>
Levees separating ponds, baked in the sun and cracked by daytime temperatures 
of 120 degrees, are being repaired. Seeds have been planted in five different 
types of soil -- most of it poor. Ponds are being flooded, water structures 
replaced or fixed. 
</P>
<P>
"Think of building waterfowl habitat area in the desert, on the side of a hill, 
in salty earth," Earl Lauppe, wildlife management supervisor for the Department 
of Fish and Game, said of the annual task facing Gonzales and his small, 
overworked crew. "You start with that perspective, you might get an idea why it 
takes so much effort to build the dykes, levees, ditches and keep this place 
going." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales, 57, has helped keep the place -- the largest public hunting area in 
Southern California -- going for the past 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
He couldn't care less about the brewing controversy over private clubowners' 
right to attract waterfowl to their lands with out-of-sack grain. It's a 
practice that started -- with DGF permits -- in the 1950s to alleviate crop 
depredation on nearby agricultural lands. Ducks and geese would fly in for the 
winter, devour and trample the crops, then fly out in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Crop depredation is no longer an issue, because of a change in agricultural 
practices and a sharp decline in the number of ducks. The U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service has therefore labeled the practice "biologically unsound," and 
two years ago issued an edict banning it before the start of the 1990-91 
season, which was supposed to open Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
But 30 or so clubs still use grain, and owners of a dozen have taken the matter 
to federal district court in San Diego, where on Oct. 10 a judge will decide 
whether to issue a restraining order, allowing the practice to continue while 
the court decides its fate. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales has no comment. "I think it's best if I don't say anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The bickering over whether the clubs in the area should be able to attract 
incoming waterfowl with grain does not concern Gonzales. Providing and 
maintaining habitat and natural feed for the birds that use Wister does. 
</P>
<P>
The habitat looks healthy at the state-run wildlife refuge and it appears 
ready, not only for the thousands of migrating birds due to arrive in the next 
few weeks, but for the thousands of hunters awaiting the start of the 1990-91 
waterfowl hunting season. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales doesn't care that opening day of Southern California's split season is 
still undecided, long after the DFG proposed -- and most hunters planned for -- 
an Oct. 13 opener. Nor does he about the reasons for the possible delay. 
</P>
<P>
His concern is how to best use the land and water the DFG pays a high price to 
extract from the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
"We actually are spending money on water that we shouldn't be spending if we're 
going to go Oct. 27," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The commission will decide Thursday whether to keep the original date of Oct. 
13, or to change it to Oct. 27. It claims it has been receiving letters from 
"private individuals" asking that it delay the season-opener for two weeks 
because there will not be enough birds in the area on Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
"Virtually all the comments are that we're starting the season too early," said 
Dan Connelly, wildlife coordinator for the DFG. "It's too hot, there aren't any 
ducks around and that people will prefer to have a later season." Connelly then 
contradicted one commission member by saying, "The feeding clubs are an issue" 
in the commission's consideration. 
</P>
<P>
Al Taucher, an ardent supporter of the feeding program over the years, denied 
that the commission will base its decision on the desires of those who operate 
feeding clubs, but did say delaying the opener makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pintail (duck) habitat down there in the early part of the (season)," he 
said. "But if they can only shoot one (the limit on pintails is one), wouldn't 
it make sense to prolong the season so they could get more (productive) 
shooting in?" 
</P>
<P>
His reasoning made sense until a check of the records showed that of the 966 
ducks taken at the state-run hunting area during the Oct. 14 opener last 
season, only 96 were pintail. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales doesn't want to get involved, but he pointed to a wide variety of 
species of ducks congregating in the ponds at Wister and said he expects 
thousands more in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Some show as early as July," he said. "Most are here by late October. They're 
here by the thousands." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Brown, who belongs to a nearby "non-baiting" club -- those opposed to the 
practice call it baiting -- says the commission's choice as an alternative 
opening day is no coincidence and hints that it is bowing to pressure from 
influential owners and members of the feeding clubs. 
</P>
<P>
"The law requires that no shooting take place until 10 days after the last 
kernel of bait has been removed," Brown wrote in a column that appeared last 
Thursday in the San Diego Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
Therefore, if the clubs lose in court on Oct. 10, the first Saturday they would 
reasonably be able to hunt would be Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Bauer, migratory bird coordinator for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 
said: "If the decision would go against them, that would give them some time to 
clean up the grain and still have that 10 days and the opening of the season." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales' response: "We have to put the water in whether it's the 13th or 27th. 
We have to be ready for either day." 
</P>
<P>
After the USFWS issued its edict, Cliff Lawrence, owner of the Rancho de los 
Patos club, said: "The feeding program keeps the ducks here. I predict that 
after two years (of not being able to feed) we will lose 50% of the waterfowl 
habitat in the Imperial Valley." 
</P>
<P>
Fish and Game Commissioner Taucher agreed, saying: "I am in favor of the 
feeding clubs. When the ducks come in, their feed is gone in a couple days. 
Besides keeping them there, it also gives them a chance to rest. Instead of 
moving on to Mexico, well you know what happens in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed among supporters of feeding-baiting that if it is 
stopped, the birds would continue down the flyway and face slaughter in Mexico, 
where hunters and guides have little or no regard for conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Maier, executive vice president of Waterfowl Habitat Owners' Alliance at 
the time of the edict, said: "Without (feed), ducks would clean out the natural 
food and leave. These soils are poor. Sure you can produce crops -- you need 
(costly) drain tiles to do it. It's no big trick to grow waterfowl plants, the 
question is abundance. Besides, they're feeding on natural food first anyway." 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales' response to all this: "They say there's nothing out there, the birds 
are starving, there's nothing for the birds to eat. We have cattails, a lot of 
cattails. We chop the cattails, and the geese like to eat the shoots when 
they're still young. We have cattails, alkali bulrush, over 1,000 acres of 
swamp timothy, which is very high in protein. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
A tour over 36 miles of dirt roads that slice their way back and forth across 
Wister also revealed sunflowers, watergrass, ryegrass and atriplex. 
</P>
<P>
"There are (plants) out there I don't even know the names of, but the ducks eat 
it," Gonzales continued. "There is plenty for them to eat out there, and I 
don't want anybody telling me (otherwise)." 
</P>
<P>
He has the backing of the USFWS. Bill Henry, a biologist who was stationed at 
the nearby federal wildlife area when the edict came out, advised feeding-club 
owners: "The soil temperatures are very warm, so the (ponds) should be drained 
quickly before salinity increases. Water is the key to growing desirable 
amounts (of swamp timothy) and reducing salinity -- draining at proper time, 
irrigating at right time, leeching it to reduce salinity . . . it may take two 
years on some of the poor ground." 
</P>
<P>
Bauer said last week: "We came out with an evaluation report stating it can be 
done. We've shown that. You don't blink your eyes, and it doesn't happen 
overnight. And it's no more costly than putting feed out. 
</P>
<P>
"Their bottom line is they want us to let the feeding program continue as it 
has over the last many years, where we've gone in on the statement that we 
think it's in violation of federal baiting regulations." 
</P>
<P>
The practice isn't allowed anywhere else in the country. Time will tell if it 
will continue in Southern California, and what its impact on waterfowl will be. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gonzales vows "to manage this area for all wildlife," including the 
endangered clapper rail, the pheasants introduced last year, the quail, doves 
and other upland birds. And of course for waterfowl. 
</P>
<P>
"Our first priority is for the birds," he says.

   The North American Waterfowl Management Plan, a $1.5 billion
United States -Canadian effort to restore dwindling duck
populations in the U.S., could receive the blessing of Congress
this year.
   It would give legal sanction and possibly legal tender to the
plan signed by the interior secretaries of the two countries in
May, 1986.
   The proposed legislation by Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, is the most encouraging thing that's happened
involving the plan, said Charles H. Collins, executive director of
the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the group charged with
implementing the U.S. part of the plan.
   Mitchell pledged he would introduce ``The North American
Wetlands Conservation Act'' in April.
   ``A primary goal of the legislation would be to halt the decline
of many species of ducks, geese and other migratory birds through
the implementation of the North American Waterfowl Management
Plan,'' Mitchell said.
   The legislation calls for spending $25 to $30 million a year to
cover Washington's share of costs in the 15-year plan.
   Ducks Unlimited has pledged nearly $500 million over the life of
the plan.
   The Canadian government and provinces have pledged more
millions, and the states are beginning to make contributions.
   Meanwhile, a first series of projects under the plan is being
realized, and a second series is on the drawing boards.
   Ducks Unlimited and the Nature Conservancy, both private groups,
have signed a preliminary agreement to acquire and improve
waterfowl habitat.
   ``They are particularly talented in acquiring the land, and we
have special expertise in the management of land and water,'' said
Matt Connolly, executive vice president of DU. ``Working together
we can be a lot more effective.''
   The partnership has started four projects, one in each of the
major duck flyways.
   They are located at Central Cheyenne Bottoms, Kansas, the major
inland staging area for shorebirds on the north American continent;
Bodcau Bayou in Louisiana; Ace Basin near Charleston, S.E.; and the
Cosumnes River drainage, the last undammed river in California. The
latter is a major wintering area for tundra swans, cranes, pintails
and snow geese, said Connolly, chairman of the North American
plan's implementation board, representing conservation, fisheries
and forestry groups.
   ``I believe private sector, as shown by the groups on the board,
is working together. The fruits of our labors are beginning to
show. The Quill Lakes project in Saskatchewan is about to be
baptized.''
   That project, a first-step project under the plan, involved
acquiring land, building wetlands and protecting upland habitat for
ducks. The area is getting its first drenching of rain and snow
this spring.
   Connolly said he was worried despite coordinated efforts in
spending $9.3 million on second-step projects under the North
American plan. ``One of my concerns is when we start getting $50
million or $60 million, then the occasional slippages of the bad
side of humanity will come out.''
   The group, he said, is not ready to handle that kind of money
because there are no formal agreements and criteria.
   ``In three years, we have come a very long way,'' he said. ``But
if we were fortunate to have someone give us $100 million right
now, we don't have the infrastructure, don't have the priorities
identified, to judiciously spend the money.''
   Spending large sums of money across international borders often
is a complicated business, he said. ``We're learning a lot about
dealing with governments, dealing with land and ownership.''
   ``We are maturing,'' he said.

<LEADPARA>  THE BEGINNING of the waterfowl season turned out better than expected even
though the four refuges administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service in the
Sacramento Valley were generally dry.;   But bird numbers were good. A few
days before the opener Oct. 26, an estimated two-thirds of a million ducks,
60,000 white front geese and 100,000 to 150,000 ross's and snow geese were in
the four refuges of the Sacramento Valley Complex, which includes Sutter,
Colusa, Delevan and Sacramento national wildlife refuges.  </LEADPARA>
<SECTION>  Venture  </SECTION>
<HEADLINE>  STRONG START FOR WATERFOWL SEASON
NUMBERS ARE GOOD DESPITE LATE WATER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Venture -- Celebrating the Active Life  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Hunter success was reflected in the opening-day numbers at Colusa, where
179 hunters averaged 3.0 birds each, and at Delevan where 91 hunters bagged
228 birds, an average of 2.5.;   Water is a big question in the Sacramento
Valley waterfowl complex, where the allocation has been cut to 75 percent of
normal. The big problem is that water wasn't delivered to the refuges by the
Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District until the first of October, and now they're
trying to play catch-up.;   Greg Mensik, a biologist at the Sacramento
National Wildlife Refuge, said they may not receive enough water to flood all
of the wetlands before the irrigation district normally shuts down at the end
of November. But if they can get the water onto the refuges before the end of
November, they may be able to flood even more acreage.;   "What we have," said
Mensik, "is enough water allocated to flood 75 percent of our wetlands.
Because we had to wait so long, however, we may now have enough water to cover
a few more acres.;   "August and September are our most expensive months in
terms of water use due to plant growth and evaporation," he said. "A normal
acre that's flooded in August or September takes an average of 3 1/2 to four
acre feet to maintain until the next season. But now it may require only three
acre feet. We can take that extra acre foot from three acres to flood an extra
acre.";   Decent rainfall this year in the pothole region of the Canadian
prairies where the geese and ducks breed is a bright spot for next year's bird
numbers. Mensik doesn't expect to see much difference in the numbers of birds
this year because the moisture came too late for the breeding season.;   The
following is a look at conditions at the four refuges administered by the
Department of Fish and Game in the San Luis area, which includes San Luis,
Kesterson, Los Banos and Volta.;   San Luis Refuge -- Conditions are optimal;
110 hunters are allowed in daily either by reservation or on a first-come,
first-served basis for the available spaces.;   Kesterson -- Because the Fish
and Wildlife Service is constructing a water delivery system on the west side,
the quota this year is only 28 hunters (14 on the east side, 14 on the west
side).;   Los Banos -- The capacity is 100 hunters per day.;   Volta -- The
normal capacity is 150 hunters. The number of hunters was reduced earlier
because the area was not quite flooded.;   Hunters may call a hot-line number
-- (209) 826-6719 -- for a recorded message that gives hunter numbers and bag
averages at each of the four areas. The message is updated every Monday
morning by 9 a.m.; MAKING RESERVATIONS: Joyce Bigham at the San Luis Wildlife
Refuge said many people are under the erroneous impression they must have a
reservation to get onto an area.;   Reservations may be made, but if the quota
for an area is not filled the remainder of the openings will be placed on a
first-come, first-served basis, she said.;   Reservation may be made by
obtaining a reservation card from a sporting goods dealers, affixing a $1.05
stamp to the card and mailing it to Sacramento early enough to arrive at least
10 days before the day a hunter wishes to shoot. If he receives the card back
in the mail, he has a reservation.;   Those with reservations should show up
two hours before shoot time to get the best choices of blinds. Reservations
are void after one hour before shoot time. Shoot time is a half-hour before
sunrise and varies day to day. The times are printed on the waterfowl
regulations available at sporting goods stores.; ETC.: Junior hunter permits
are still available for special pheasant hunts at O'Neill Forebay for Nov. 16,
17 and 23. Check for availability of permits at (209) 826-0463.  </TEXT>

FT  24 JUL 93 / Geese to keep birdies away: The strange battle over a golf
course
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT and THOMAS HARDING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARY Holloway does not look like the sort of woman to do battle with a
Japanese golf company. A mild-mannered housewife, she lives in a picturesque
house in the depths of Weavers Down wood, west Sussex, and is happiest, she
says, tending her flock of geese and looking after her garden.
But two years ago she embarked on a campaign that has sent an ominous
warning to the golf world and left a Japanese company embroiled in a bizarre
battle - one that has pitted golfers against ancient common-land rights and
a motley collection of cows, goats and geese.
Weavers Down common, a valley dotted with elegant houses sporting names such
as 'Squirrels', seems a strange place to stage a golf battle. Indeed, when
Kosaido, a Japanese printing group, took over an ailing local golf club, Old
Thorns, eight years ago, it caused barely a stir in the tranquil woods.
Though some locals muttered about the arrival of the Japanese, and the new
shiatsu centre, conference complex and Japanese restaurant which had
appeared at the club, most accepted the new mangement.
The battle started when Kosaido announced that it intended to extend the
course. On paper, this seemed unremarkable. Kosaido, which manages 11 other
golf courses around the world, owned the land, and with golf booming in
Britain there seemed little doubt that it could attract the necessary
business clientele.
But the site was part of the 1.5m acres of common land in England and Wales.
Back in the Middle Ages local houses had been allocated 'estovers' - rights
for wood-cutting and animal grazing. Though some of the 20th century
'commoners' had let these rights lapse, a newly-discovered sense of
ecological outrage prompted the rest to action.
'I think we felt annoyed that they just assumed they could build a new golf
course. We've already got so many golf courses round here anyway,' says
Mary.
Taken aback, the Japanese' first response was to offer a business solution.
In a letter, they offered to buy the rights: Pounds 1,300 for the
wood-collecting rights, and rather more for geese and cattle grazing. But
the commoners refused to budge, and threatened to appeal to the Royal
Commoners' Commission if the Japanese infringed on their grazing rights.
Kosaido then produced a new, environmentally-friendly plan which promised to
let some of the land revert to its original heathland state, and respect its
common land status. After all, it pointed out, other golf courses in England
were already built on common land.
But surely this did not mean that the cows would be allowed to graze on the
golf course? asked the commoners. Yes, replied Kosaido, adding that it all
boiled down to the '4-inch rule.'
'Since free-ranging cattle require grass of at least 4in length around which
to wrap their tongues while feeding,' the cows would ignore the greens, it
said.
But what if the cows wandered across the greens during play? And what about
the geese? 'Geese would love bunkers. And they can make a tremendous pooh,'
chuckles Mary, gleefully. She claims that the commoners had also taken
expert golfing advice which showed that most golfing greens could not
withstand a cattle herd.
Undeterred, Kosaido submitted its application to the local council, arguing
that since it already had permission to build a new hotel, the extension of
the golf course was a necessity.
'We have nothing to say. We certainly don't want any publicity over this,'
Kosaido declared nervously. At this point, though, the commoners discovered
they were not alone in arguing that there were already too many golf courses
in the world.
English Nature, for example, was concerned about the well-being of the
solitary bees and Dartford warblers. And the local reptile society announced
that the land was home to the little-known smooth snake and sand lizard, and
thus a proposed Site of Special Scientific Interest.
'We were rather surprised when they popped out of the grass. We'd never
heard of them before,' says Sam Howes, assistant planning officer from
Chichester District Council, whose task it had been to plough through
100-odd protest letters.
Meanwhile, the Royal Commoners' Commission, whose job it is to decide on the
status of common land, expressed confusion. 'We can only deal with cases
that are referred to us by the county council,' it admitted.
This week, just when the council was due to meet to decide the case - it was
expected to support Kosaido - an 11th hour fax from English Nature,
contesting the status of the access roads through the snakes' habitat,
prompted deferral of the hearing.
The commoners says that if Kosaido wins planning permission at the next
hearing they will take their case higher - and carry on a grazing war on the
golf course with their geese and goats.

GAGGLES OF GEESE, THOUSANDS OF DUCKS, A MULTITUDE OF SHORE AND LAND BIRDS --

<TEXT>
<P>
Way out on Lake Cachuma, somewhere between the call of the loon and the honk of 
the Canadian goose, there is the amazing spiel of naturalist Neal Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
"At Lake Cachuma we have seeds that walk, spiders that fly, plants that catch 
fish and trees that predict rain," Taylor says to his Eagle Tour passengers 
aboard the Cachuma Queen, "and there are 276 varieties of birds, including 
three dozen species of waterfowl on the lake." 
</P>
<P>
But only one Neal Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor's tour-boat passengers are surprised when, in the middle of the lake, he 
cuts the outboard. Soon they will be even more surprised when Taylor begins 
discourses on such topics as capitalism and conservation, differences between 
goldeneyes and common mergansers, the natural history of Spanish moss and how 
to cook a coot. 
</P>
<P>
For a few moments, passengers on the bobbing boat savor the quiet of the lake 
and the reflection of the Santa Ynez Mountains on the water's surface. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor smiles. To say he had a captive audience is supreme understatement. With 
an actor's instinct, the naturalist stretches out his Harold Pinter-like 
dramatic pause until his passengers begin to fidget. He then begins his first 
discourse of the day about Lake Cachuma, which is just northwest of Santa 
Barbara: 
</P>
<P>
"Who's the best fisherman on the lake?" Taylor asks. 
</P>
<P>
"The cormorant," answers a young woman, who, judging from the way she clutches 
her high-powered binoculars, bird checklist and Peterson "Field Guide to 
Western Birds," is a serious bird watcher indeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Good guess," Taylor declares. "The cormorant is a big eater, excellent at 
diving for fish. And extremely smart. I swear that bird knows when the trout 
truck arrives and where we'll stock the lake. But actually, the cormorant is 
the third-best fisherman around here." 
</P>
<P>
"The eagle," answers a safari-suited fellow who looks as if he had stepped from 
the pages of the Banana Republic catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
"Another good guess," Taylor says. "The bald eagle's feet are adapted for 
fishing. The eagle has little bumps on its toes so that when it swoops down to 
get a fish swimming close to the lake's surface, the bird can hold onto its 
dinner. The eagle is the second-best fisherman on the lake." 
</P>
<P>
The sly grin working at the corners of Taylor's mouth and the twinkle in his 
eyes lets the passengers know they've been had. "Yeah," he says with mock 
bravado. "You're looking at him." 
</P>
<P>
Groans and laughter are overpowered by the roar of the outboard as Taylor 
throttles the Cachuma Queen toward the north shore. 
</P>
<P>
With all due respect to the eagle and the cormorant, and with all kidding 
aside, Taylor may very well be the best fisherman on the lake. As a teen-ager, 
he won several national casting titles. These days, he teaches "The Art and 
Science of Fly-Fishing," both "academically" at UCLA and "hands-on" in the 
wilds of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a mountain of a man with a winning grin, may be entertaining to tour 
passengers, but he's anything but to the lake's rule-breakers when he finds 
them fishing in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor came to be a park ranger rather late in life because, he says, "I was 
spending too much time in the corporate world and not enough time in the 
natural world." 
</P>
<P>
He spent the better part of two decades as a salesman for a sporting goods 
distributor before becoming Lake Cachuma Recreation Area's park naturalist 
seven years ago. Early attempts to market his tours as water nature trails and 
wildlife cruises were not very successful. Then the eagles discovered Lake 
Cachuma and Taylor and county park officials had a product to market. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor stops the boat again. "This is a free-enterprise lake," he declares. 
"Fees collected for day use, camping and tours completely pay for this park, 
and no local tax dollars have to be collected." 
</P>
<P>
Passengers, expecting to learn about fish, not free enterprise, are a bit 
baffled. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank you for your support," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor thinks capitalism, in the manner that it's practiced at Lake Cachuma, 
can promote conservation. Fees collected from wildlife-watching tours could go 
to help preserve animals and their habitat. Whale watchers helped save the 
whale, elephant-seal watchers helped save the elephant seal, and perhaps eagle 
watchers can help save the eagle, Taylor reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, on this overcast Friday morning, the eagles are elusive. True, the 
passengers already have sighted gaggles of geese, thousands of ducks and a 
multitude of shore and land birds, but Taylor feels compelled to provide at 
least one glimpse of an eagle on any Eagle Tour. 
</P>
<P>
"Where are they?" Taylor mutters under his breath as he pilots the boat into 
isolated inlets and scans the high crags and snags where the eagles roost. 
</P>
<P>
America's national bird migrates south from the Pacific Northwest and western 
Canada to the warmer climate and more abundant food sources of Central and 
Southern California. Eagles often winter in the same spots preferred by 
migrating waterfowl -- the state's inland lakes such as Cachuma -- where food 
is plentiful and human intrusion is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Cachuma's eagles arrive in November or December and stay until mid-March. 
Wildlife experts believe that birds wintering at Lake Cachuma come from the San 
Juan Islands off the coast of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Declining Population 
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, there were nesting pairs of bald eagles in 24 
California counties. By 1950, only eight counties could count reproducing 
pairs, the decrease partially attributable to the use of DDT from the 1940s to 
the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"Look!" Taylor cries with a mixture of triumph and relief. "An immature, high 
in that oak tree." 
</P>
<P>
Binoculars are trained on a brownish-black bird, all but camouflaged in the 
branches of the distant tree. The largest raptor in North America (with the 
exception of the captured condors in the Los Angeles and San Diego zoos) is not 
all that majestic from such a distance. 
</P>
<P>
Every Eagle Tour is different, Taylor says. Sometimes passengers get an 
eyeball-to-eyeball look at an eagle perched on a snag near shore. At close 
range, when the observer can see the white head and tail, the large, yellow 
hooked bill and talons, America's national symbol is truly an impressive sight. 
</P>
<P>
"Look!" Taylor exclaims. "High in the sky!" 
</P>
<P>
Eagles in flight are beautiful to behold. Unlike some other large birds, eagles 
soar with their wings almost flat. With a 6- to 8-foot wingspan, they create a 
dramatic and distinctive silhouette against the clear winter sky. 
</P>
<P>
And the flight of this eagle on this day has made Taylor a happy man and 
delights the tour-boat passengers. Now he can talk of other things. 
</P>
<P>
"I really didn't want the lake at first," Taylor confesses. "It (building a dam 
to impound the Santa Ynez River) half-drowned a beautiful valley and it wrecked 
one of the best steelhead fishing rivers in the state." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Chumash Artifacts 
</P>
<P>
A lot of other people disliked the proposal to form the lake, but when 
water-short Santa Barbara resorted to rationing during 1948, the dam and lake 
were approved by local voters. Congress appropriated funds and the project was 
completed in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
The lake also covered up a lot of human history, Taylor says. "My brother and I 
picked up four truckloads of Chumash artifacts and took them over to the Santa 
Barbara Museum of Natural History." 
</P>
<P>
It was the abundance of steelhead trout in the river that brought the Chumash 
to the area and later attracted several generations of anglers. Dedicated 
fishermen say the Santa Ynez River once compared favorably with the Klamath as 
one of the state's best steelhead-fishing rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Concerned with the demise of the trout stream, the California Sport Fishing 
Protection Alliance recently filed a complaint with the State Water Board. The 
alliance wants a study done on how the fishery might be restored. Taylor, too, 
would like to see the wild river of his youth restored, but for now, his 
priority is protecting the lake's 42 miles of shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I regard the lake as a wonderful resource -- as a way to enhance wildlife 
habitat. This is a remarkable place for birds," he says. 
</P>
<P>
For beginning bird watchers who've traveled long distances for the chance to 
sight a bald eagle, it's almost bird-watching blasphemy to opine that eagles 
often are not the most intriguing part of the Eagle Tour. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors are sometimes more delighted by the great multitude of birds -- the 
flocks of geese taking flight or the clouds of canvasbacks traveling in long, 
V-shaped formations. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes it's the antics of the diving ducks that are most remembered. The 
canvasback, a diving duck with a white back, rusty-red head and long black 
bill, is almost always sighted on the lake. And visitors are all but certain to 
see the bufflehead, one of the smallest diving ducks, a chubby white fellow 
with a black back that buzzes more like a fly than a bird. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Great Blue Heron 
</P>
<P>
Other divers include the small, brown, pie-billed grebe and its cousin, the 
eared grebe. Because grebes ride stern up in the water, they always seem to be 
in danger of sinking. 
</P>
<P>
The lake's longest-legged resident is the great blue heron. Its long neck, 
regal bearing and great size make it one of the most photogenic of birds, and 
its habit of standing motionless for long periods on one leg make it an easy 
target for amateur photographers. 
</P>
<P>
"Cachuma is a great place for the beginning bird watcher," says Joan Lentz, 
co-author with Judith Young of "Birdwatching: A Guide for Beginners" (Capra 
Press). "There are more than a dozen species of ducks, four species of grebes 
and a couple of loons -- a real wealth of wintering bird life. 
</P>
<P>
"The lake's low water level means you can get fairly close to a lot of water 
birds," Lentz explains, "and don't forget the perching birds in the park's oak 
woodland -- acorn woodpeckers, Western bluebirds, goldfinches, juncos and lots 
of sparrows." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor has a breezy approach to bird watching, which may be just what the 
beginner needs to get off to a good start, says author Young, "but, uh, he 
didn't tell his coot story to a boatload of Auduboners, did he?" 
</P>
<P>
Well . . . yes. 
</P>
<P>
"The coot is the Rodney Dangerfield of the bird world," Taylor declares. "It 
doesn't get any respect." 
</P>
<P>
He and the passengers watch one of the gregarious gray, white-billed birds 
skitter over the lake's surface on its huge feet and lunge awkwardly into the 
air. Not only is it a graceless flyer, but it has a grating kakakakaka call. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the ugly duckling-like bird is kind of cute and one serious birder 
nearly drops her binoculars when Taylor blithely asks: "Know how to cook a 
coot?" 
</P>
<P>
None of the cooks on board dares hazard a guess. 
</P>
<P>
"First you pluck it, then leave it in a stream overnight. Then you put an apple 
inside the bird and wire it to a split green log. Smoke the coot over a 
campfire 3 1/2 hours or until golden brown." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone on board but the Auduboner realizes Taylor is pulling their legs. 
</P>
<P>
"Then throw away the coot and eat the apple." 
</P>
<P>
Bobcat, fox and coyote prowl Cachuma's shoreline. About 70 beaver families live 
by the lake. Unlike their river-dwelling cousins, Cachuma's beavers don't build 
dams. Instead, they occupy burrows in the mud banks. 
</P>
<P>
While much wildlife inhabits the lake's shores, a few visitors expect a thrill 
at every turn. "Some visitors expect the Disneyland jungle boat ride," Taylor 
complains. "There aren't any pop-up rhinos and recorded bird calls out here. 
It's all real." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'That's Nature's Way' 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes too real. 
</P>
<P>
On some occasions, the natural history lesson comes from Charles Darwin rather 
than Walt Disney. During one cruise, Taylor maneuvered the tour boat into an 
isolated inlet and he and his passengers watched, enthralled, as not 30 feet 
away a doe and two fawns nibbled at the lakeside brush. It was an idyllic 
scene, pretty as a post card . . . until a mountain lion, with the big cat's 
legendary quickness, burst out of the bushes and killed the doe. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one thing to read about survival of the fittest in a textbook; it's 
another thing to see it acted out before your eyes," Taylor comments. 
</P>
<P>
"I have to say it was a little like watching the murder of Bambi," admits 
Taylor, "but that's nature's way and it's not my job to interrupt it." 
</P>
<P>

A PARK THAT PRESERVES GENTLE DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Every morning, a rickety camper turns off La Cienega Boulevard into Baldwin 
Hills and putters up to a lake set into a hillside covered in eucalyptus, 
sycamores, pine trees and white alder. Across the hill, nodding oil pumps keep 
up their ghostly rhythm and a Chevron plant smolders and snorts. But here, in 
Kenneth Hahn Park, there is only the sound of robins, starlings and blackbirds 
calling, of ducks splashing into the water, of a stream rushing headlong over 
rocks into the lake. And Henry Crosby, a large, gnarled and solid man, is going 
fishing as usual. 
</P>
<P>
The park is full of flowers these days: pyracanthus bushes aflame, fields of 
clover and daisies, banks of orange and purple. Fat and glossy birds bathe in 
the stream, catfish hide in the dark reeds. In the distance, men grapple 
clumsily with garden hoes and hedge trimmers; newcomers, on referral from the 
courts, doing time here instead of in jail, drawn in by the calm clock of the 
earth. 
</P>
<P>
It is a park for men who came from somewhere else -- from dark, crowded rooms 
in city streets below, but also from other worlds where the soil was all that 
nourished a man. John Lindsay, the superintendent, learned in Mississippi how 
to grow corn, cotton, sweet potatoes, peanuts and melon. Worrying over trees in 
need of iron, sod to lay, bushes to plant, Bermuda grass to feed; this is how 
he keeps faith with the father who sent him to college in hard times. 
</P>
<P>
His helpers sign in, painfully and slowly; writing does not always come easily. 
But in the early morning, the restrooms are scrubbed and sparkling, not a speck 
lingers around the garbage cans. This place of still beauty created from scrub 
and waste is a gift to be carefully tended. Police circle like stealthy lions 
watching over a pride. This is a park of gentle days. 
</P>
<P>
Its heart is the lake. Men on upturned 44-pound detergent pails, men on old 
deck chairs, perched on rocks, standing easily, watching poles and the ripples 
of wind on the water. Men gone fishing. A community of men under kind and 
weathered hats; familiar as they are with the tiny signs of fish, they read in 
each other the smallest signals of friendship. They listen to the wind, laugh 
aloud -- huge hoops of laughter -- as one of their number lands a plastic bag, 
and chuck beneath the chin the small grandchildren and daughters of their 
cousins' cousins. Some sit close, chomping, chewing, chatting, poking for worms 
in battered old fishing boxes. Watercolors from the old South; pictures from 
long ago. 
</P>
<P>
And, as the sun warms the hillside, Henry Crosby dozes in his sagging chair, 
knowing that, should a stranger approach, his geese will hiss, warn and 
threaten the unexpected outsider. Henry's geese come waddling off the lake as 
soon as they see his camper turn into the parking lot. They are the companions 
of his day, never more than yards away. When the catfish skulk, he stands in 
the clear air, stroking the great, soft breasts of his geese who crane their 
long necks in delight. Someone stole one of Henry's geese a while back. The 
other goose pined, and Henry thought his heart would break. The lake's 
fishermen worried with him. One night, weeks later, the goose was put back: joy 
abounded. 
</P>
<P>
Three times a month -- not nearly often enough, grumble the regulars -- trucks 
rumble in from the fishery to feed 320 pounds of catfish into the lake. Next 
morning, there is hardly place for a man to stand. How does word get around? 
"I'll tell you, you tell me, I'll tell him," says Henry. The camaraderie of the 
lake. 
</P>
<P>
Most fish for their dinner. "I don't like fish much. I don't eat them much," 
says Henry. "I just like to catch them. I just like to be watching the pole and 
pulling on something." He is here before 8, leaves when he gets hungry. He 
fishes in the heat and fishes in the rain. At 77, he cannot remember a time 
when he didn't fish. 
</P>
<P>
He was born in South Carolina, son of a cement man. He went to work as a boy 
and ran away at 9. "It was about 30 years before I let them know where I was. 
I'm pretty sure they worried. They needn't of." Fishing and cement: They have 
been his life. In his pocket, this gruff and warm man carries a card marking 40 
years membership in the plasterers' and cement masons' union. He is retired 
now, his hearing shot. Now he knows only the peaceful life of the lake, the 
fierce fight of the catfish. "I've caught a 12-pounder and seen some bigger 
than that." Bigger than that -- the cry of fishing men, watching water, as men 
have since time immemorial. 
</P>
<P>
"This is where you find the nice people," says Henry. "Down at the water. 
People who fish are friendly, and if you don't fish -- why, you miss a whole 
lot of relaxing." 
</P>
<P>
There are many ways to tell the story of this city; this is one of the nicer 
ways.

<HEAD>First Crane Killing Reported in 21 Years, Authorities Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTWELL, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A female whooping crane flying through
heavy fog with her mate was shot by a hunter, the first reported
killing of the endangered bird in 21 years, authorities said.
   The crane was killed near the Aransas National Wildlife Refuge
where it makes its winter home, the first such incident anywhere
since 1968, when another hunter was fined for shooting a crane
nearby under nearly identical weather conditions, refuge manager
Brent Giezentanner said Wednesday.
   The investigation will determine whether the hunter, whose name
was not released, shot the crane intentionally or by accident,
Giezentanner said.
   He said the out-of-town hunter and a companion were hunting for
geese and ducks Tuesday in Spalding Cove, state-owned marshland
south of the wildlife refuge, which lies about 45 miles northeast of
Corpus Christ along the Texas coast.
   Giezentanner said the shooting may have been accidental, but
added that ``there's still a lot of difference in a 2-foot goose and
a 5-foot crane.''
   ``A prudent hunter should have known the difference,'' he said.
   The 4-year-old female crane was shot as it flew with its mate
through heavy fog above the cove, Giezentanner said, adding that the
crane had brought her first chick with her on the southerly
migration from the Wood Buffalo National Park in northern Canada.
   The shooting of cranes is not always detected because the
endangered whoopers are not monitored constantly during their annual
migration north or south, he added.
   Wildlife refuge officials learned of the shooting after the
hunter surrendered, as occurred in the earlier incident.
   The hunter involved in the 1968 shooting was fined $500, the
maximum penalty then for killing an endangered species under the
Migratory Bird Treaty Act.
   Under the current Endangered Species Act of 1969, a person
charged with intentionally killing a member of an endangered species
faces a one-year sentence and-or a $20,000 fine. An accidental
killing carries a maximum six-month sentence and-or $10,000 fine.
   Authorities said that apart from the 136 adult cranes and chicks
that made the migration to the Aransas refuge this year, only 25
others are known to exist in New Mexico, and 40 are kept in
captivity at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service center in Patuxent,
Md.
   The whooping crane population has steadily increased since the
late 1930s, when fewer than 20 existed.

FT  30 OCT 93 / Books: From killer to conservationist - J D F Jones
considers Peter Scott's biography
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By J D F JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER SCOTT: PAINTER AND NATURALIST
by Elspeth Huxley
Faber Pounds 17.50, 361 pages
IT is remarkable how some of our most famous conservationists learned their
trade - discovered their passion - in the killing fields.
Here is Peter Scott ('Because of him, more than any other single person,
animals that 40 years ago seemed doomed to extinction still exist' - Sir
David Attenborough) at play before the war: he and two friends shot a score
of ducks at Leighton Moss, rushed to the Lake District to kill two stags,
then charged back to the marsh for another 100 geese before supper.
He saw nothing untoward in this. 'They were man's traditional quarry,' he
wrote, 'and it was part of man's instinct to hunt: it was part of the birds'
instinct to be hunted' (my emphasis). To which I can only say, balderdash
and humbug.
Eventually - slowly - the sinner repented, and by the early 1950s Peter
Scott had sold his guns. Gavin Maxwell had trodden the same path, just like
those professional white hunters in Africa who, today, have become game
wardens. Perhaps our own king-in-waiting will one day follow their example
as he attends to his duties as president of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust
which, successor of the original Severn Wildfowl Trust at Slimbridge, is
Peter Scott's most concrete legacy.
But peaceful co-existence between hunters and bird-watchers was very much on
Scott's mind in the early days of the Trust. He had observed in America the
benefit of partnership between shooters and savers.
So long as a species was not endangered, the trust's annual reports could
talk about 'the notion of wildfowl as a natural resource which can be
harvested like any other crop'. It still sounds pretty rum to me, coming
from a man who committed his life to, and built his international fame upon,
a passion for geese.
Peter Scott was a famous man for 40 years. His father, of course, was even
more famous, and everyone has always assumed that it must have been a
problem for Peter to be automatically associated with the gallant Captain
who died on the way back from the South Pole.
In fact, according to this authorised biography, there seems to be next to
no evidence of a complex. On the contrary, Peter throughout his life found
every door open to him, and he had the energy to take full advantage of his
role as a golden boy of the Establishment. Elspeth Huxley's thesis is that
his father's fame was a double-edged legacy: it smoothed his path but also
confronted him with the need to achieve the highest standards. That sounds
about right.
From babyhood he mixed with the good and the great, thanks to his formidable
sculptress mother, Kathleen. At Cambridge he managed a pass degree by the
skin of his teeth - he was never an intellectual - but it was there that he
discovered wildfowl. He had a facility for drawing and, as we all know, he
became a painter, a trade which was to fund him for much of his life. The
biographer is polite: 'Although his paintings tended to be ignored or
patronised by avant-garde critics, they sold well and continued to do so for
many years to come, affording pleasure to his patrons and a comfortable
income for himself'. The print called 'Taking To Wing' sold 355,423 copies
between 1934 and 1959. Later on he saved himself exertion by making
cardboard stencils of geese in flight which he could pin to his landscape
canvases in the appropriate position.
He had a good war, in destroyers in the North Atlantic and then commanding a
steam gunboat; he also made an important contribution to the technique of
camouflage. A first marriage to the teenaged Elizabeth Jane Howard quickly
failed (his portrait of that distinguished future novelist was to grace the
jacket of Paul Gallico's best-selling The Snow Goose which he illustrated).
He almost became a Tory MP. And he was a sportsman - skating, sailing,
gliding - of world class; at the ripe age of 55 he was the British Open
Champion glider.
The war matured him, says his biographer, which hardly seems surprising. It
might be worth underlining (as she does not) that his powerful mother died
soon after. In 1945 he discovered Slimbridge, on the south bank of the
Severn, where Whitefronted geese arrived in immense numbers from Russia
every winter. This time he did not shoot. He transferred his own collection
of birds, which he had started in 1933, and the Wildfowl Trust was born.
Portly, balding, bespectacled, Peter Scott became first a national figure
and then an international committee man and lobbyist. He was a pioneer of
television nature programmes, which turned him into an indefatigable
globetrotter, but Slimbridge (and its later satellites) was his first and
true mission as he churned out the canvases to pay the bills. He was a
mighty pioneer of the Green Movement and it was inevitable that in 1961 he
should have been centrally involved in setting up the World Wildlife Fund
(now the World Wide Fund for Nature). All this, be it noted, before we knew
about acid rain and ozone holes and global warming. A voice before his time,
he wrote: 'I personally believe that all other species of flora and fauna
have as much right to their place on earth as does Homo sapiens'. It was his
lifelong crusade.
This is not a book that calls for detailed criticism. Huxley has told a long
and interesting story lucidly - no mean achievement for a writer in her
mid-80s whose first biography, the definitive life of the Kenyan Lord
Delamere, goes back nearly 60 years. She has evidently enjoyed a trusted
relationship with the family (15 years ago she wrote a biography of Captain
Scott). Peter, knighted, a Companion of Honour, Fellow of the Royal Society,
is an Establishment hero and Huxley is not the biographer to scrutinise the
emperor's clothes.
Once she asks whether he was 'too good to be true', but she prefers not to
chip too deeply into the inner man. She is unnecessarily discreet about
Kathleen's uninhibited life and, unsurprisingly, coy about the son's private
concerns, but these things need not matter: the tale of a busy, worthwhile
life, so superior in its achievement to that of the famous father, will
carry you happily through a couple of winter evenings.

<HL> On the Fifth Day of Christmas
My True Love Ran Out of Money
---
By Beatrice E. Garcia
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL>
<DD> 12/22/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Worries about inflation may have crashed along with stock prices in October. 
But that was before the latest Christmas Price Index arrived. 

   The new CPI shows inflation running at a 7.3% annual rate this year -- a gigantic leap from the 0.8% pace in 1986 and sharply higher than the 4.6% rate of the Commerce Department's consumer price index. 
Then again, the Christmas index isn't your typical basket of goods, based as it is on items mentioned in the popular carol "The Twelve Days of Christmas." 

   While the cost of most commodities -- partridges, pear trees, turtledoves, French hens, calling birds, geese and swans -- was unchanged, fees for such services as ladies dancing, pipers piping and drummers drumming rose a bit. 
The big culprits in the overall rise, though, were the five gold rings, which shot up to $750 from $225 as jewelers took advantage of a 22% surge in gold prices through mid-December. 

   "With all the turmoil in the financial markets this year, consumers will be more cautious," declares Robert Christian, chief economist at Provident National Bank in Philadelphia, who developed the index four years ago. 
"If they still buy gold rings, they might just go down in quality." 

   Local suppliers, at first put off by Mr. Christian's requests for prices, now revel in the pursuit. 
When he inquired at the Philadelphia Zoo last week about calling birds and geese, he was offered several choices. 
Simple canaries run $25 apiece, he was told, while a chloropsis, a brightly colored tropical songbird from Southeast Asia, sells for $225. 
When it came to the six geese a-laying, the economist could pick from domestic birds at $25 each or go for a red-breasted variety that retails for $600 a head. 
In each case, he opted for the least-expensive, domestic alternatives. 

   It took Mr. Christian and an assistant about four hours to gather the data. 
But even in this era of cost controls and worker efficiency, the bank indulges him in the project because clients get a good laugh from it. 
"Besides," he says, "I told them I did it on my lunch hours." 

   Clients indeed look forward to Mr. Christian's annual report. 
"It shows there's humor even in economics," says Morton L. Brown, director of research at Edward D. Jones &amp; Co., a St. Louis-based brokerage firm. 
In any event, he adds, "we tend to listen to anyone who is a member of our investment-policy committee and who won the limbo contest at (Provident's) investment conference last year."

Bye-Bye Birdies -- Theories abounded among local birders earlier this season to 
explain the exceptionally low numbers of migrating birds passing through the 
county. Had the escalating destruction of wintering grounds in the tropics 
taken a sudden and devastating toll? 
</P>
<P>
But a late rush of migrating land birds started early this month and reached a 
big peak a couple of weeks ago. On one day in Huntington Central Park, for 
instance, the avian display included a count of 125 yellow warblers and 100 to 
150 Swainson's thrushes. "It was really impressive," said Doug Willick, who 
keeps track of rare local sightings for American Bird magazine. "That was 
encouraging after a very disappointing April." 
</P>
<P>
Along with the usual Pacific Flyway travelers have come a number of vagrants 
that strayed from other migratory paths. A number of rare fall vagrants that 
are very rare as spring vagrants in the county have been spotted in recent 
weeks. Some highlights: 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee warbler (three different individuals), May 17, 20 and 24. 
</P>
<P>
* Indigo bunting (two individuals), May 4 to 6 and 18. 
</P>
<P>
* Northern waterthrush, May 3. 
</P>
<P>
* Black and white warbler, May 29. 
</P>
<P>
* Gray flycatcher, April 15. 
</P>
<P>
* Summer tanager, May 20. 
</P>
<P>
* Franklin's gull, May 14. 
</P>
<P>
On May 20, a spotted redshank was seen just south of Orange County on Camp 
Pendleton. The Asiatic shore bird, a rare vagrant in the United States outside 
of the Aleutian Islands, has never been seen before in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Making several appearances in recent weeks on the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh 
Reserve in Irvine has been an American bittern, a member of the heron family. 
"They didn't use to be rare, but numbers in Southern California have really 
dwindled," Willick said. At one time, the birds bred in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
While the passage of spring migrants through the county is now waning, the 
number of rare and unusual vagrants should pick up for the next several weeks. 
These birds are probably straggling, Willick said, because they are lost far 
from their usual migratory paths. The vagrants provide an added challenge to 
avid birders and can make for additions to life lists (a birder's list of birds 
seen). 
</P>
<P>
Quail Hill Update -- The city of Irvine has already announced plans to preserve 
Quail Hill, the spot where thousands of migrating Canada geese spend the winter 
each year. Now it's time to decide what will happen to the land behind Quail 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
On both the city and county plans it is part of William R. Mason Regional Park. 
It has not been developed, however, and is now open space and strawberry 
fields. The land is leased from the Irvine Co., and if the county wants to keep 
that arrangement it has to show improvements on the property by 1991. 
</P>
<P>
The county pitched a plan to build a golf course and hotel on the property but 
met a less-than-enthusiastic response from the City Council. Some Irvine 
officials, meanwhile, would like to restore the area to something approaching a 
natural state, with native plants and trees and winding trails. 
</P>
<P>
Plans to that effect are being drawn up by a city administrative aide. 
</P>
<P>
New Checklist -- UC Irvine's Museum of Systematic Biology has published a new 
"Checklist of the Vascular Plants of Orange County, California," the first time 
the list has been updated since 1968. Fred Roberts of the museum compiled the 
work, which will serve as the framework for the first-ever complete flora for 
the county, due to be published sometime after 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The checklist includes all native, introduced, naturalized or escaped species 
of vascular plants that have become established or persist as part of the 
county's flora. As presently known, the flora of Orange County includes 1,157 
species of vascular plants with an additional 99 subspecies or variations, for 
a total of 1,256 taxa. Of the total, 806 are native to the county. 
</P>
<P>
Copies of the checklist are available at several locations, including the 
Museum of Natural History and Science in Newport Beach.

   Drought has reduced the expected fall duck
migration to the second smallest on record and could mean a 25
percent reduction in hunting this year, federal wildlife officials
say.
   The migration will total about 66 million ducks, according to
biologists of the Fish and Wildlife Service. Only 1985's estimated
migration of 62 million was lower, and last year's was a hopeful 74
million.
   All the decline will come in the Central and Mississippi flyways
because of steady loss of marshy breeding areas in the northern
plains states and southern Canada in the 1980s. The flight on the
Atlantic and Pacific flyways should be unchanged from last year.
   The service has been warning for weeks that major new
restrictions probably will be needed for hunting seasons starting
in October.
   States are in charge of actual hunting regulations, but they
must choose from possibilities set out by the service. Early-season
guidelines for hunting the blue-winged teal in September call for
no season at all in 13 Central and Mississippi flyway states.
   Regular-season guidelines will be decided upon next week after a
public hearing in Washington. Advisory committees meeting in Denver
on Monday were asked to discuss a 25 percent cutback in the number
of days during which duck hunting is allowed, a reduction in bag
limits from the typical four to three and an early closing of the
season on Jan. 1 instead of Jan. 20, said Megan Durham, spokeswoman
for the Fish and Wildlife Service.
   It isn't just this year's drought that has reduced breeding
activity in the marshes. There have been many dry years in this
decade, allowing farming to be extended into areas previously too
wet for crops, particularly in Canada.
   Surveys released last week showed record numbers of ducks in
northern Canada and Alaska, with populations up 9 percent there.
Those ducks couldn't find suitable areas farther south, and the
longer flights may have tired them too much to breed, biologists
fear.
   Overall, the census by U.S. and Canadian biologists showed the
breeding populations of 10 major species down 3.7 percent from last
year and 17 percent from the 1955-1987 average. There were only
2.58 million Northern pintail ducks, 18 percent fewer than last
year and 54 percent below average.
   Mallards in southern Saskatchewan fell below 1 million for the
first time.
   ``Biologists are beginning to worry that continued low water
conditions in the areas waterfowl use for migration stopovers and
wintering will concentrate the birds and make them more vulnerable
to disease later this year,'' the service said.
   Frank Dunkle, director of the service, was quoted as expecting
increased emphasis on management of wetlands for waterfowl as
provided for under the 1986 ``North American Plan'' agreement with
Canada, because such areas in many cases have provided the only
relief for drought-stressed waterfowl.
   Some other findings from the survey:
   _The Platte River in Nebraska has been turned into a ``river of
sand,'' exposing the nesting piping plover and the interior least
tern to threats of predators and death of aquatic food species.
   _Geese are faring better than ducks, since they nest on more
permanent wetlands and are better able to protect their young from
predators.
   _Flows of tributaries to the Great Lakes are so low biologists
cannot safely apply chemicals to control lamprey, which prey on
lake trout. Dredging necessitated by low water will spread
contaminated bottom sediment, threatening other aquatic life.
   _The acorn crop from oak trees in the Midwest and South could be
a near-total failure without major rain soon, spelling problems for
deer, squirrels and wild turkeys dependent on acorns for food.
   _Pheasant, quail and grouse, though doing well in Kansas and
Nebraska now, could be hurt next winter and spring through
drought-caused loss of food and cover. Poor production of pheasant,
grouse and Hungarian partridge is expected in the Dakotas.
   _Some fish won't spawn in the upper Mississippi and Missouri
rivers because of low water, and high temperatures in the Dakotas
has eliminated or reduced production of walleye, northern pike,
smallmouth bass and largemouth bass at federal hatcheries.

   The goose hangs by its feet from
a thick rope stretched across the town square on the feast day of
Santiago, the patron saint of Spain. A rider on horseback passes
underneath and yanks the head off.
   He has his prize and the crowd cheers. Another goose is brought
out and strung up for another rider.
   Critics call it barbarous.
   But to the thousands of Spaniards in the villages and towns,
yearly fiestas that often involve the ritualistic killing of a
goose or a rooster or a bull are an essential part of their lives
and an affirmation of their cultural identity.
   None of the onlookers at the fiesta in this agricultural village
of 2,500 near the Tagus River in the rolling hills of central Spain
could say for certain why the eight male riders dressed in black
britches and embroidered jackets try to pull the heads off geese.
   But they know young men have been doing it every July 25, the
feast day, for 400 years, at least.
   The practice gained notice abroad about five years ago when
photographs of the event appeared in the British press. Headlines
called the Spaniards barbarians and worse. Nowadays the geese have
been injected with a tranquilizer.
   ``They're numb, they don't feel anything, that's all I'll say,''
said Mayor Pedro Villalba Cedeno.
   Anthropologists surmise that the practice grew out of a
celebration of the legendary appearance of Santiago, or St. James,
at the Battle of Navas de Tolosa in 1212, sparking a Christian
victory over the Moors.
   The geese represent the Moors, who ruled much of Spain for more
than 700 years.
   In some towns, the sacrificial victim is a bull, whose
ritualistic importance in Spain can be traced back to the
pre-historic caves across the northern part of the country and to
the Iberian culture that pre-dates the Romans.
   The bulls at one time were burned alive. Now the ends of their
horns are set alight with flaming balls of tar, sending the bulls
into panicked flight. Young boys chase them and beat them with
sticks until the fire in the tar balls dies out. In one town, the
bulls are killed after that but in others they are then left alone.
   In other towns bulls are driven over cliffs into the sea.
Townspeople rescue them from the water, but if the bulls break
their legs or are otherwise injured they are taken to the slaughter
house.
   Julio Caro Baroja, the dean of Spanish anthropologists, has done
extensive studies of the fiestas, their relation to the seasonal
cycle and the role of animals in them.
   The ritual killing of animals, he writes, serves an expiatory
function that has been incorporated, if not explicity sanctioned,
by the Roman Catholic Church.
   In El Carpio de Tajo, a rider carrying the religious banner of
St. James precedes the goose-beheaders.
   ``We've received hundreds of letters of protest from foreigners
who've read about the geese and other fiestas involving animals,''
said Alicia Tiemblo Diaz, head of information at Spain's
Secretariat for Tourism. ``I've talked to town officials who tell
me, `Let them complain. It's our fiesta, and we'll keep on doing it
the way we want.'''
   The Spanish Animal Rights Association has joined forces with
other European organizations to encourage governments of the
12-member European Economic Community to pass legislation banning
cruelty to animals. There is little likelihood such action will
prosper in Spain.
   ``Our fiestas are cruel. I didn't realize how cruel they were
until I started going out and studying them,'' said Guadalupe
Gonzalez Hontoria, director of the Museum of Popular Arts and
Traditions at Madrid's Autonomous University. ``We Spaniards do
have our brutish side, but we can also be very brave.''
   During the 36-year dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco, many
fiestas, particularly those that emphasized regional or local
characteristics, were suppressed. Pre-Lenten carnivals were banned
as being too licentious until authorities figured out that it drew
tourism.
   Following the return to democracy 12 years ago, Mrs. Gonzalez
Hontoria said, Spaniards began to celebrate their fiestas with
renewed gusto.
   ``It seems now with modernization, everyone wants to go back to
his roots, and people see that they can lose their fiestas if they
don't defend them.''

Cinnamon teals, sandpipers and Savannah sparrows were already bathing and 
swimming in the new wildlife preserve at Sepulveda Basin Friday morning when 
Mayor Tom Bradley led a host of officials in praising one of the state's first 
bird sanctuaries set in a populated area. 
</P>
<P>
The $1-million preserve, located in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area in Van 
Nuys, covers 60 acres including an 11-acre man-made lake that is expected to 
attract water birds flying south for the winter. The lake was approved in 1981 
as part of the basin's master plan and is a joint project of the state 
Department of Fish and Game, the state Department of Parks and Recreation and 
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
"Residents of the city will now be able to take a short drive and discover a 
unique, tranquil wildlife area that is open each day," Bradley said at the 
dedication ceremony. "Geese and hundreds of species of birds have already found 
refuge in this natural environment. With other recreational opportunities 
available in other parts of Woodley Park, the wildlife area is a wonderful, 
exciting excursion for the whole family." 
</P>
<P>
Bordered by Burbank Boulevard and the San Diego Freeway, the Sepulveda Basin 
Wildlife Area restricts pedestrians to dirt trails. Wooden blinds allow 
visitors to watch birds without disturbing them. Saplings and rose bushes also 
have been planted in the preserve. 
</P>
<P>
Water pumped last month created a four-inch-deep pond surrounding a small 
island. About eight more inches of treated water will be added to the lake 
within two months once the water lines of the nearby Tillman Water Reclamation 
Plant are completed. 
</P>
<P>
Sandy Wohlgemuth, of the Los Angeles Audubon Society, said the preserve is 
located on the migratory route of birds flying south for warmer weather. 
</P>
<P>
"It's necessary to have it here to accommodate the birds because there are so 
few places for them to sit down where it's safe," he said. "You can't have dogs 
chasing them, people fishing there. This is going to be a wintering area and 
migration stop. They have to fatten up and get their energy up. Some of them 
will stay. 
</P>
<P>
"When I come here, I like it because it's somewhat wild," he said. "It gives me 
the feeling I'm not in the city, even though you can see the skyscrapers." 
</P>
<P>
Wohlgemuth saw about 20 species of birds Friday and said a third of them would 
not have been there without the lake.

<DATELINE>ARANSAS NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When three
whooping cranes flew out of a tidal marsh, sounds of awe mixed with
the clicking of cameras on the deck of the Lucky Day.
   The three birds made up nearly 2 percent of the entire
population of their kind.
   ``Flying whooping cranes at 9 o'clock,'' Capt. Harry Sloat told
the 80 passengers, his second tour group of the day on the Gulf
Intracoastal Waterway. ``They're showing off their wing tips for
you.''
   Each year, it gets a little easier to spot the birds at the
Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, which is celebrating its 50th
aniversary.
   There are about 195 whoopers in the world today; in 1941, the
population had dwindled to 15. The decline came as habitats were
developed for farms and cities, while hunters helped to nearly
finish off the species.
   Whooping cranes made Aransas famous, but when Congress created
the coastal preserve in 1937, the legislation did not mention the
bird known scientifically as Grus americana.
   ``This refuge was not established to protect whooping cranes,''
said refuge biologist Tom Stehn. ``It was established to protect
waterfowl habitat.''
   The government saw the need to protect less spectacular game
birds, such as ducks and geese. Whooping cranes just happened to be
lucky enough to share the same area during the winter.
   Their precarious situation by 1945 prompted the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service and National Audubon Society to work on rescuing
the birds from extinction.
   ``Without the Aransas refuge, I think it's pretty evident the
whooping crane would have become extinct,'' Stehn said, while
observing an unusual gathering of 14 whoopers in the same field.
   He called it ``just phenomenal to be able to see that many
whooping cranes from one location, to think that at one point there
were only 15 in the entire flock.''
   Scientists don't think the whooping crane population ever
exceeded 5,000, he said.
   Only about 8,000 acres on the refuge provide the marshy winter
habitat whooping cranes use to look for food including plants,
clams, snakes, crabs, snails, fish, worms and insects.
   Several other endangered species make the refuge their home.
They include the bald eagle, brown pelican, peregrine falcon,
Attwater's prairie chicken, jaguarundi and Eskimo curlew.
   The Texas whooping crane flock numbers 132 this year, a 79
percent increase in four years. Virtually all are on or near the
54,829-acre refuge.
   They migrate each winter to Texas from Canada's Wood Buffalo
National Park 2,400 miles away.
   Eighteen to 20 whoopers live among sandhill cranes that migrate
between Gray's Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho and New
Mexico's Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. They were
introduced as chicks into the sandhill families, but none have
started breeding.
   A third group of 41 lives in captivity at the Fish and Wildlife
Service's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Maryland. Lone
specimens of whooping crane also live at the San Antonio Zoo and
the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis.
   With their population steadily growing, the Texas whoopers have
started spreading to a 44,000-acre state park and refuge on nearby
Matagorda Island. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is buying an
additional 11,502 acres at the southern end of Matagorda from The
Nature Conservancy. That will add important new habitat as the
territorial whooping cranes spread out.
   ``We're really encouraged by the land that they're adding''
because wildlife is rapidly losing ground, said Jesse Grantham,
biologist and manager for the National Audubon Society's Texas
sanctuaries. ``We're not creating habitat. We're just saving little
pieces of what's left.''
   Whooper pairs, mated for life, stake out winter territories and
return to the same claims each year.
   The birds stand nearly 5 feet tall and have wings spanning about
7{ feet. Adults are snowy white, with black wingtips and red crowns
on their heads. Immature whooping cranes are rusty red and white
with black wing tips. Males breed at about the age 3, while females
wait until they're about 5.
   In Rockport, where Sloat's Lucky Day and four other whooping
crane tour boats are based, the endangered bird means money for the
local economy.
   Just a couple of years ago, only two whooping crane boats were
operating.
   ``You have people that are staying in motels and eating and
seeing other things while they are here'' to see the whooping
cranes, said Bob Lynch, executive vice president of the
Rockport-Fulton Chamber of Commerce. ``It has an economic impact on
our community, there's no doubt.''
   Some estimate the refuge brings up to $5 million to the local
economy.
   Refuge officials, however, worry about its location on the Gulf
Intracoastal Waterway, a man-made channel that cuts right through
the whooping crane habitat.
   Some 1,485 acres of habitat have been lost since 1941 due to
construction of the canal and erosion caused by boat wakes.
   Regular barge traffic leaves oil, grease, cadmium, arsenic,
nickel and mercury, while many of the barges carry deadly cargo.
   ``There is some nasty stuff going through that canal,'' said
refuge manager Brent Giezentanner. ``You're carrying very toxic
chemicals within 100 yards of the cranes. If we have one barge
break open some time, we potentially could have a major portion of
the whooping crane habitat contaminated.''

   Gus, a 4-month-old Canada goose, helps
cut the grass, visits the neighbors and sometimes flies after the
school bus.
   ``He's the original party animal,'' says Bill Carson, who
adopted Gus from friends who hatched the goose on their water
heater.
   Gus will accompany anyone on a walk to get the newspaper. He
helps mow the grass by eating clippings sprayed from the mower and
sometimes chases the school bus when his friend Ryan Thigpen, 11,
leaves in the morning.
   Gus flies beside the bus, looking in the window. Carson -
fearful the goose will be hit by a car - is trying to break Gus of
that habit.
   Content to live with humans, Gus ignores a large flock of Canada
geese living in a small lake in Carson's back yard. He also ignores
Dudley, a domestic gray goose who passes the day staring at his
reflection in the shiny chrome bumper of Carson's truck.
   About five months ago, a Doberman pinscher found an egg near the
Harpeth River in Franklin, about 20 miles south of Nashville, said
Diane Frazier.
   ``My uncle's dog, Duchess, was playing with the egg in the yard
for some time,'' Frazier said. ``My uncle thought it was a
baseball.''
   Her husband, Mike Frazier, rescued the egg, put it in a paper
bag and placed it on the water heater, turning it once a day until
Gus hatched.
   The Fraziers, who live in downtown Franklin, soon decided Gus
would be happier in the country and gave him to their friend
Carson, who lives in this small town about 10 miles east of
Franklin.
