   It was 200 years ago that French citizens overthrew
King Louis XVI, beginning a bloody revolution that was to
reverberate throughout Europe.
   Bastille Day, July 14, the day in 1789 when the French
revolutionaries stormed and destroyed the state prison in Paris is
the national holiday of France.
   A reconstruction of the Bastille and ``the world's biggest ball''
are just two of the events marking the celebration of the
bicentennial of the French Revolution taking place in France in the
coming months.
   Those thirsty for ``revolutionary'' wine will find it at the
Salon des Vins at the Porte de Versailles where, from April 28 to
May 8, visitors can sample wine made as it was during the reign of
Louis XVI.
   For visitors who don't speak French but would like to know more
about exactly what happened 200 years ago, a special historical bus
tour in English is being offered by Vision tourist agency. The tours
go both to Versailles, where the Royals lived it, and to sites in
Paris, where they died.
   Meanwhile, the Tuileries Gardens from May 5 to Nov. 11 will
become a living theater of bicentennial events.
   A special area in the gardens will come alive with musicians,
dancers and clowns, while cafes and a restaurant cater to hungry and
thirsty crowds.
   In a theater space visitors will see computer-powered plastic
automatons resembling Robespierre, Danton and other historical
figures doing their revolutionary thing, though beheadings are not
part of the show.
   And spectators may experience a time warp as they view the
computerized 3-D film of Paris as it was 200 years ago, complete
with a riot outside a bakery, the crowds demonstrating against
high-priced bread.
   The gardens will sprout several temporary structures, including
two 120-foot towers with spiral staircases to evoke flying doves,
the bicentennial symbol.
   Another theater will offer nonstop, 10-minute skits with actors
portraying aspects of the Revolution like ``Fraternity Night.'' This
is not a celebration of pledging a college frat, but a show on ``the
abolition of privileges.''
   Those in Normandy at mid-summer will be able to see Tall Ships
from all over the world sailing from Rouen to Le Havre between July
12-15.
   As a special salute to France, 51 visiting brass bands from the
United States will parade from City Hall to the Trocadero on July 8.
   Also in July will be the inauguration of a giant arch west of
central Paris, a new monument that stands in a line of landmarks
beginning at the Place de la Concorde and running through the Arc de
Triomphe. The inauguration will kick off events to celebrate the
Declaration of the Rights of Man, the French Bill of Rights adopted
during the Revolution and later the preamble to the French
Constitution.
   Festivities will peak on Bastille Day, July 14, beginning with
fireworks and including ``the world's biggest ball,'' a huge street
dance on the evening of July 13.
   At the Place de la Bastille, the new Paris Opera will open its
doors for the first time, offering a concert commemorating the
revolution.
   The original Bastille prison was burned down two centuries ago,
but visitors can see copies of it reconstructed at La Villette, a
giant park in northeast Paris from July 9-15.
   At the end of the show, visitors will be allowed to tear down the
towers and take home souvenir bricks inscribed, ``Liberte, Egalite,
Fraternite.''
   Meanwhile, toy-makers are offering giant inflatable plastic
replicas of the Bastille _ suitable for the backyard.
   In a more serious vein, President Francois Mitterrand will host a
summit meeting of the seven richest nations schedueled to take place
at the height of the summer celebrations.
   On July 14, U.S. President George Bush, British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and other heads of state are expected to view the
parade and flyover from the presidential box on the Champs-Elysees.
   As a gala wind-up on July 15, a special sound-and-light display
created for Paris by Jean-Paul Goud will illuminate the City of
Lights.
   The Eiffel Tower, celebrating its own centennial, will present a
special illuminated show on July 17. And Mayor Jacques Chirac has
announced that on Aug. 26 tightrope walker Philippe Petit will
negotiate the Seine on a 400-foot highwire between the Eiffel Tower
and the Palais de Chaillot.
   Petit will carry a copy of the Declaration of the Rights of Man
to present to Chirac.

   Brass bands marched down the Champs-Elysees today
and scores of planes streaked across the sky, leaving a trail of
blue, white and red smoke wafting over the heads of hundreds of
thousands of bicentennial revelers.
   Celebrants danced and frolicked into the wee hours this morning
at nearly a dozen places around Paris to celebrate the July 14,
1789, storming of the Bastille prison.
   The thousands of revolutionaries who rushed the hated prison
found only seven inmates to free, locked up not for their politics
but for fraud, incest and lunacy, but the action marked the
beginning of the French Revolution.
   The traditional Bastille Day military parade in the morning
followed all-night partying that briefly got out of hand, resulting
in a 5 a.m. scuffle between a few stragglers that riot police tried
to clear from the Place de la Bastille.
   Three of the baton-wielding policemen were slightly injured as
were an unknown number of others, the French news agency Agence
France-Presse reported. About a dozen people were arrested.
   President Francois Mitterrand rode standing up in a jeep from the
Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde, where he took his place
in the parade viewing stands behind bullet-proof glass shielding
more than 30 world leaders in Paris.
   Among those seated in the VIP stands to watch the military parade
were President Bush, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and
President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines.
   Nine bands set the stirring pace for units representing every
branch of the French military, including the Foreign Legion.
   Among the more than 100 planes that swooped over the avenue were
nine Mirage 2000N's, designed to carry nuclear warheads. One
squadron of aircraft trailed blue, white and red smoke, the French
national colors.
   The Interior Ministry press center set up on the avenue estimated
that 1 million people lined the parade route. But police sources
said preliminary indications based on aerial photographs suggested a
crowd of about 300,000.
   A meeting of leaders from the seven major industrialized nations
was to begin this afternoon, coinciding with the festivities.
   The parade was the first of two scheduled today, the second of
three days of bicentennial celebrations that began with a human
rights ceremony Thursday and the inaugural performance at the new
Bastille Opera.
   The concert was followed by street parties all over town.
   A parade tonight was to feature the Florida A &amp; M Marching Band.
   The biggest outdoor ball was at the Place de la Bastille, where
the prison stood before it was burned down during the French
Revolution.
   The enormous circular place was jammed with people of all ages.
People perched on the base of the Bastille monument and the
staircase of the new glass-and-steel Opera Bastille.
   Directly across, a huge white tent sheltered a stage where jazz
musicians, African bands and accordion virtuosos played waltzes,
marches, and other music to the staccato accompaniment of fireworks
exploding in the balmy summer night.
   ``This beats any party back home,'' said Robert McKean of
Alameda, Calif., who took a break from studying French in summer
school to meet his friends at the Bastille.
   Gilles Driate, a computer technician from a Paris suburb, grabbed
the hand of a surprised stranger with gray hair and spun her around
to the music.
   ``I prefer smaller parties, but I wanted to come here this year
to be part of the most popular of French celebrations,'' he said.
   The smell of grilled sausages at sidewalk stands filled the air,
and partygoers uncorked thousands of bottles of wine.
   The inaugural concert earlier at the new Opera Bastille, a
high-tech hall built to bring culture to the masses, was attended by
such celebrities as actress Catherine Deneuve, tennis player Yannick
Noah and Nobel Peace Prize-winning author Elie Weisel.
   A rousing orchestral rendition of the Marseillaise, the French
national anthem, opened and closed the 75-minute show.
   The Marseillaise was to be sung again tonight by American soprano
Jessye Norman on the Place de la Concorde during a second parade
that was to be the centerpiece of the capital's bicentennial events.
   On Saturday, a giant fireworks display across from the Eiffel
Tower will illuminate the city and close the ceremonies.
   With the ouster of the monarchy and the promulgation of France's
Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen, many believe the
French Revolution shaped the principles of universal human rights
and laid the foundation for modern democracy.
   However, the revolt was followed by a wave of terror that
eventually produced Napoleon Bonaparte and his military dictatorship.

   France celebrated Bastille Day with music, food,
fireworks and a display of military muscle ranging from World War
II-vintage tanks to state-of-the-art missiles.
   This year's festivities were scaled down from last year's
bicentennial blowout, when about 1 million visitors converged on
the French capital. Tourism officials said about half as many
people traveled to Paris for this year's celebrations.
   For those Parisians who were put out by traffic jams and miffed
by crowds in their favorite cafes last year, the smaller
festivities were a welcome change of pace.
   Bastille Day marks the fall of the Bastille prison in 1789,
generally regarded as the spark for the French Revolution, which
toppled Louis XVI and gave France its first republican government.
   Despite the climate of lessened military tensions in Europe,
France pulled out the stops for its traditional military parade.
   A week ago, Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement underlined
France's commitment to keep a strong conventional and nuclear
force, even as the Warsaw Pact and NATO are negotiating deep
defense cuts in the wake of the democratization of Eastern Europe.
   Thousands of soldiers marched down the Champs-Elysees to the
Place de la Concorde. Jets screamed overhead, sending blue, white
and red contrails to match a huge tricolor fluttering under the Arc
de Triomphe.
   About 600 tanks and other armored vehicles lined the route or
paraded along. The vehicles represent about 15 percent of France's
armored forces.
   Bearded companies of Foreign Legionnaires were fitted out in
desert khakis and their trademark white kepis. The
Napoleonic-uniformed Republican Guards, who provide the ceremonial
security at the presidential palace, trotted along on cavalry
horses, gleaming chrome sabers flashing.
   The French even rolled out their the new Mistral ground-to-air
missile, capable of reaching speeds of 1,864 mph.
   A platoon of World War II-era tanks, similar to those that
liberated Paris from the Nazi occupation 50 years ago, clanked by.
One bore the name ``De Gaulle,'' in tribute to Gen. Charles de
Gaulle, the wartime leader of the Free French. France is
celebrating the 100th anniversary of his birth this year.
   A fireworks display was planned for tonight, and showman
Jean-Michel Jarre was giving an evening concert at the year-old
Grande Arche in the financial district of La Defense.
   The concert was expected to draw 2 million spectators. The
government spent $8.2 million underwriting the show so admission
could be free.

   POINTE-A-PITRE, Guadeloupe (AP) _ French West Indians celebrated
Bastille Day with parades and a cultural festival featuring hundreds
of artists, dancers and singers from 15 Caribbean nations.
   Guadeloupean independence activist Luc Reinette was greeted by a
crowd of about 500 cheering supporters late Thursday night as he
stepped off a plane from Paris.
   Reinette and seven other Guadeloupean nationalists jailed since
the early 1980s on charges of terrorism were granted amnesty
Wednesday by the French government, a gesture aimed at coinciding
with the bicentennial of the French Revolution.
   Local television and radio broadcast the Bastille Day
celebrations in Paris Thursday and Friday.
   Bicentennial revelers in Pointe-a-Pitre watched French air force
Mirage jets that flew from Europe this week perform low-level
acrobatics, leaving trails of blue, white and red smoke, the colors
of the French flag.
   Thousands of army conscripts marched in parades in Pointe-a-Pitre
and Basse-Terre, the two largest cities of Guadeloupe, and in
Fort-de-France, Martinique.
   As overseas departments, the eastern Caribbean islands of
Martinique and Guadeloupe, each with a population of 340,000, are
integral parts of France.
   The theme of the Guadeloupean Arts Festival was the bicentennial
of the French Revolution, symbolized by the July 14, 1789, storming
of the Bastille prison by a Parisian mob.
   Several policemen accompanied Reinette on the flight, and more
than a hundred were at the airport to prevent disorder when the
independence leader arrived. Reinette was also greeted by his
parents, wife, and two children.
   ``France should not think it is off the hook by freeing us,''
Reinette told the crowd at Le Raizet International Airport. ``France
must initiate a veritable dialogue.''
   The independence movement is virtually non-existent in Martinique
and has never garnered more than 5 percent in elections in
Guadeloupe.
   After a wave of terrorist bombings here in the early 1980s left
eight people dead, Reinette was arrested in 1984, escaped shortly
afterwards and was arrested again in 1987 and jailed in Paris. The
bombings ended with his arrest.
   Reinette was the leader of the outlawed Caribbean Revolutionary
Alliance.
   Nations and territories represented at the festival included
Haiti, Jamaica, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Dominican
Republic, St. Kitts, Dominica, Martinique, St. Lucia, Barbados, St.
Vincent, Trinidad, Anguilla, Antigua, French Guiana, Mexico and Peru.

   In Paris, Texas, two French visitors became instant celebrities.
Philadelphia waiters raced with champagne. And passengers at a New
York City airport received loaves of French bread.
   Thousands of Americans on Friday celebrated the French's
bicentennial of Bastille Day. It marked the July 14, 1789, storming
of the Bastille prison in Paris, the start of the French Revolution.
   But the celebration in Paris, Texas, beginning Friday and lasting
through the weekend, opened with a problem _ no French
representatives.
   Linda Suarez of the Paris Chamber of Commerce said she couldn't
lure French officials to the northeast Texas town of 27,000 for the
celebration, which includes a bike race called the Tour de Paris.
   So when French residents Jean Claud Savouret, 57, and Dennis
Perraut, 38, arrived at the festivities, they became honored guests.
   ``They'll be our special ambassadors,'' Suarez said after meeting
the two, who were visiting friends in the area.
   Said Perraut: ``I feel glad for us as Frenchmen to celebrate in
Paris, Texas.''
   In Philadelphia, 115 waiters and waitresses carrying full bottles
of champagne ran 11 blocks, opened the bubbly and served it with
style to a panel of judges. They were after a free trip to France.
   Competitors, who also carried a glass of water and a French flag,
had to finish with the water glass at least half-full and the
champagne bottle intact.
   Ali Niknam, 37, won. John Rojas, 23, a Colombian native, was
second.
   ``I ran for the Spanish people in Philadelphia,'' Rojas said.
   Passengers at a LaGuardia Airport terminal got loaves of French
bread and the Parks Department presented ``Les Inconsolables,'' an
accordian-and-torch song group, in New York City's celebration.
   Cast members from the Broadway musicals ``Les Miserables'' and
``Phantom of the Opera'' attended a Bastille Day luncheon to benefit
a soup kitchen.
   There was one Bastille Day controversy in New York, though: An
American artist harboring a 13-year grudge burned a French flag in
front of the French Consulate. Richard Lance Corey said he was
protesting treatment of artists at an exhibit in Paris held in
December 1975 and January 1976.
   And in Chicago, the Chicago Surrealist Group passed out leaflets
denouncing the anniversary events as ``a trivialization of an
important landmark of human freedom.''
   One French-owned hotel in a Chicago suburb featured a giant
guillotine made of cream puffs and a sugar model of the Bastille at
its bicentennial celebration.
   In Wyoming, three French climbers on Friday ascended the Grand
Teton, the three peaks that cap the Teton Range. Mountain guide Art
Peters said the Bastille Day climb was a joint project with three
Americans climbing in Chamonix and Mount Blanc, France.
   Peters said the Tetons were first discovered by French fur
trappers in the early 1800s who named them ``Les Troix Tetons,''
meaning the three breasts.
   Farther west, at Hollywood Park racetrack in Inglewood, Calif.,
organizers of a bicentennial celebration on Sunday continued to
build a 50-foot-high layer cake.
   The cake, which was to be attached to a frame today, was to
include two models of Paris' Arc de Triomphe stacked atop one
another, with a version of the Eiffel Tower across the arcs.
   ``I think it's the largest cake you can build without a
foundation system,'' said architect David Davis, one of its
designers. Originally, the cake was planned for 100 feet, but that
would have required a building permit.

France's biggest party in 200 years got off to a roaring start Thursday night 
with wild dancing in the streets, an inaugural performance in the stunning new 
"people's" opera house at the Place de la Bastille and a nasty little tiff with 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
As President Bush, French President Francois Mitterrand and 32 other world 
leaders watched from balcony seats at the costly and controversial new Bastille 
Opera, across the square from the site of the prison that was demolished at the 
start of the French Revolution in 1789, the orchestra broke into a rousing 
version of the "Marseillaise" to begin a program of selections from French 
operas, including George Bizet's "Carmen" and Camille Saint-Saens "Samson and 
Dalila." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
100,000 Celebrants 
</P>
<P>
Two hours after the early evening performance, after the 34 leaders and their 
34 fleets of bullet-proof limousines and escort cars had finally departed, the 
Bastille Square filled with more than 100,000 celebrants. As rock music blared 
from a temporary stage erected next to the new opera, the cool night air filled 
with smoke from exploding firecrackers and sizzling sausages cooking on open 
grills. 
</P>
<P>
By midnight, the square was too packed for anyone to truly dance, and the 200th 
birthday party had evolved into a kind of adolescent-style happening. Still, 
there were about 30,000 other bals populaires taking place all over France on 
the eve of Bastille Day where traditional dancing -- tangos, polkas and waltzes 
-- and accordion music could be found. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Bastille Day, Parisians will be treated to the annual military parade 
down the Avenue des Champs Elysees as well as a wacky $15-million nighttime 
parade, featuring elephants, oil-can drummers and dancing bears, that was put 
together by eccentric French-American advertising man Jean-Paul Goude and 
rehearsed secretly on a French air force base. 
</P>
<P>
The focus of events Thursday night was the Bastille Opera. 
</P>
<P>
Critics have described the $400-million glass-and-concrete building, designed 
by Canadian architect Carlos Ott, as looking like a "ship in dry dock." 
President Mitterrand is known to detest the design and prefers reading to music 
anyway. The new opera was at the center of an international controversy when 
music director Daniel Barenboim was fired in January. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
15-Minute Ovation 
</P>
<P>
But none of this seemed to matter Thursday night as Bush, his wife Barbara, and 
most of the other national leaders and their spouses joined in an enthusiastic 
15-minute standing ovation for opera singers Placido Domingo, Barbara 
Hendricks, June Anderson and others who performed on the technologically 
advanced new stage. 
</P>
<P>
As his gift to the new opera house, Bush presented Mitterrand with an original 
key to one of the cells at the Bastille Prison. 
</P>
<P>
The key was originally given to George Washington by the Marquis de Lafayette, 
but since 1858 it has been the property of the Mount Vernon Ladies Assn. The 
association is lending the key to France for the Bicentennial. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, many of the 2,700 people in the audience turned to applaud 
mitterrand, the 72-year-old french leader who is taking advantage of the 
bicentennial to show off several of his monumental building projects, including 
the opera, a $300-million pyramid addition at the louvre museum and a 
$500-million arche de la defense, which will be the main site of the 
seven-nation economic summit this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
One world leader who did not appear to be having as much fun as the others was 
Britain's Thatcher, who was met with boos and hostile whistles from the crowd 
on at least two occasions Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
On the eve of her visit here Thatcher was interviewed by the newspaper Le Monde 
and a French television network. In her remarks, she managed to outrage the 
French government and much of the citizenry by saying that the 1789 Declaration 
of the Rights of Man and Citizen, the centerpiece of the Bicentennial 
celebration, did not originate with the French. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly not," the British leader said on the Antenne-2 network, "They date 
back much further than that. We have our own Great Charter (Magna Carta) of 
1215 and the notion of human rights goes back to the ancient Greeks and even 
further." 
</P>
<P>
In the interview in Le Monde, Thatcher took a swipe at the extravagantly 
festive, self-congratulatory celebrations being staged by the French to honor 
the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a peaceful revolution in 1688," she said, "in which the Parliament 
imposed its will on the monarchy. We celebrated this event last year, but 
discreetly." 
</P>
<P>
The French found nothing discreet about these comments. She was heartily booed 
as she left a short noontime event at the Palais de Chaillot honoring the 
French Rights of Man. She was booed again by a large crowd along the barricades 
of the Place de la Bastille when she left the opera house in her armor-plated 
limousine after the performance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thatcher in Back 
</P>
<P>
Intentionally or not, the Mitterrand government placed the British leader in 
the back rows of the assembled world leaders at both the Rights of Man ceremony 
and the opera performance. Her motorcade was also one of the last allowed to 
leave the opera house area, behind even that of Zaire leader Mobutu Sese Seko, 
the self-described "supreme guide" of his country, who came to Paris without an 
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
The presence of dictator Mobutu has caused a minor stir among some of the other 
Third World nations. 
</P>
<P>
"The rest of us came to celebrate the Revolution," said a member of the 
delegation from India. "He came to celebrate The Terror." 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand felt that by inviting the Third World leaders to the Bicentennial 
celebrations, he could foster dialogue between them and the leaders of the 
group of seven leading industrial democracies, including Bush, who will begin 
meeting here this evening. He was also sensitive to the charge that it might be 
considered poor taste to host a meeting for the world's seven richest nations 
on the anniversary of France's popular uprising. 
</P>
<P>
But despite his efforts, he has been forced in recent days to defend not only 
his celebration but also the French Revolution itself. 
</P>
<P>
"For those of us who serve the Republic and democracy," he said in an interview 
with the American ABC television network, "the 14th of July is our fete." 
</P>
<P>
Reacting to charges that he had turned the Bicentennial into an imperial-style 
event, with lavish meals and gala events such as the Bastille Opera opening, 
Mitterrand said: "When you receive friends, you put your house in order. You 
put flowers in the vases. You organize a dinner that is a little bit better 
than an ordinary family meal. That does not mean you are receiving your friends 
in an imperial fashion." 
</P>
<P>
According to the official estimates of the French government, the costs of the 
Bicentennial festivities will exceed $70 million. The total cost of the 
building projects -- the Louvre pyramid, the opera and the Arche de la Defense 
-- will exceed $1.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of the celebration is at the center of the continuing feud between 
Mitterrand and his main political foe, Gaullist party leader Jacques Chirac, 
who also happens to be mayor of Paris. The Mitterrand government charges that 
Chirac ran up a bill, paid for by the national government, of more than $13 
million on one 90-minute party June 14 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of 
the Eiffel Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Chirac says Mitterrand is exaggerating the numbers to hide his own excesses. 
</P>
<P>
Regarding today's parade and other events planned here, the mayor of Paris said 
Thursday, residents "would be wise to leave town."

   Let them decorate cake in Chicago, storm the Bastille in
Louisiana, sprint while balancing bottles of sparkling water in
Boston: vive la revolution en Amerique.
   New York, home to an estimated 15,000 French citoyens, has been a
flurry of activity this year to celebrate the 200th anniversary of
the French revolution. There have been French films, an opera
written by philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, dance and music
concerts.
   The French consul general, Benoit d'Adoville, will be host of a
reception on Friday, the day the French celebrate the storming of
the Bastille, the prison that was a symbol of autocratic oppression.
   In California, the Sacramento Symphony is holding a champagne
dance Friday, followed two days later by the ``Le Tour de San
FRANCEcisco'' bike race. The French government estimates that 25,000
French expatriates live in the Bay area.
   Emmanuel Gagniarre, a French consulate spokesman in New York,
says he's at a loss to list all the U.S. events planned to
commemorate the French revolution.
   ``In the United States, there are so many things,'' he said.
``There are so many historic events and values linking the two
nations,'' he said.
   Gagniarre noted that the U.S. Bill of Rights was presented to
Congress in 1789, the year the French Declaration of the Rights of
Man and Citizen was promulgated. Thomas Jefferson was U.S. envoy to
France at the time.
   On Boston Common, a site important to the history of the American
Revolution, waiters carrying bottles of sparkling water will compete
in a Bastille Day footrace.
   New Orleans, ever proud of its French heritage, plans a two-mile
cross-country race. The first 100 finishers will be awarded a bottle
of wine.
   New Orleans also offers something for counterrevolutionaries: a
Napoleon and Josephine look-alike contest.
   The town of Kaplan, deep in French-speaking Louisiana, has had
Bastille Day celebrations since 1906, but ``it's special this year
because of the bicentennial,'' said Janet Merritt, chairwoman of
this year's July 13-16 fete. Activities in Kaplan include a
recreation of the storming of the Bastille.
   Eric Falt, a spokesman for the French consulate in Chicago, said
he saw the same sense of fraternity in France when the United States
celebrated its bicentennial.
   ``I think this year is very comparable to 1976,'' Falt said.
``I'm very surprised. I just moved here from France. And I'm very
happy about it.''
   Falt said he expects thousands of Chicagoans to attend a Bastille
Day street fair along Michigan Avenue. It is one of some 50 events
scheduled in the Chicago area this month, including a pastry contest
for children whimsically named ``Let Them Decorate Cake.''
   Not all the commemorations are so lighthearted. In Miami, the
Cuban Museum of Art and Culture plans an exhibit of photographs this
month on ``the first revolution for the rights of man.''
   ``All the revolutions in Latin America were influenced directly
by the American Revoluton and the ideas of the French philosphers of
the 18th and 19th centuries,'' said museum director Carlos Luis.
``We are celebrating 200 years of the ideas of freedom and
tolerance.''

   France showed off the nation's military strength in
a Bastille Day parade Saturday, and President Francois Mitterrand
pledged to keep the nation's nuclear force independent and strong.
   Later in the day, flamboyant showman Jean-Michel Jarre lit up
western Paris before more than 2 million people in a spectacular
music and light show.
   Earlier, 7,000 servicemen trooped down the Champs-Elysee to
celebrate the start of the French Revolution.
   In his remarks, Mitterrand told television journalists,
``Defense is part of the imperial obligations of the nation.''
   ``I absolutely don't want to reduce it,'' he said, ``even more
so because there hasn't been a real reduction in the nuclear
potential of the United States or the Soviet Union.''
   France refuses to endorse the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's recent change of doctrine making nuclear weapons a
``last resort'' in any conflict with the Warsaw Pact. French
officials have said flexibility is a key to nuclear deterrence.
   ``The international situation has changed, tensions have
diminished. The duty of vigilance by the army, however, hasn't
diminished,'' Mitterrand said.
   July 14 marks the fall of the Bastille prison in 1789. The event
sparked the French revolution that toppled Louis XVI and gave
France its first republican government.
   The daylong festivities were capped by Jarre's extravaganza.
   During his show, the year-old Grande Arche and adjacent
skyscrapers in the financial district of La Defense were bathed in
dazzling, swirling colors. They changed in rhythm to Jarre's
symphonic rock music, while searchlights and fireworks formed a
canopy overhead.
   People packed the banks of the Seine on the capital's western
edge and a two-mile stretch of avenue to the Arc de Triomphe.
   The crowd was estimated at 1.5 million before the concert began,
but hundreds of thousands more people, from toddlers to nuns, kept
filling distant streets as it started. Many were unable to get a
direct view, but video screens were set up as well.
   The Culture Ministry underwrote the show with $8.18 million to
allow Jarre to put it on for free.
   ``I want a celebration for the people _ open and free to
everybody,'' said Jarre.
   The morning parade featured 7,000 soldiers, sailors,
firefighters and police officers marching from the Arc de Triomphe
to the Place de la Concorde to salute Mitterrand.
   A trio of aerobatic jets led off the parade, laying down blue,
white and red contrails over the route to match the colors of the
huge tricolor fluttering under the Arc de Triomphe.
   About 600 tanks and other armored vehicles lined the avenue or
paraded noisily along the three-quarter mile route. The vehicles
represent about 15 percent of France's armored forces.
   The loudest applause was reserved for the bearded companies of
Foreign Legionnaires, dressed in desert khakis and their trademark
white kepis.
   The Napoleonic-uniformed Republican Guards, who provide
ceremonial security at the presidential palace, also drew cheers as
they trotted down the Champs-Elysees on cavalry horses, flashing
their gleaming chrome sabers.
   Also featured were state-of-the-art Mistral ground-to-air
missiles, capable of reaching speeds of 1,864 mph to knock down
enemy aircraft.
   A platoon of World War II-era tanks, similar to those that
liberated Paris from the Nazi occupation 50 years ago, also were on
display. One bore the name De Gaulle, in tribute to wartime leader
Gen. Charles de Gaulle. France is celebrating the 100th anniversary
of his birth this year.

   The French Revolution's bicentennial is coming up
next year, with fireworks, political and historical squabbles,
commemorative underwear and miniature guillotines all part of the
show.
   The festivities are designed to peak July 14 on the 200th
anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison in 1789, the
most memorable event of the long and turbulent revolutionary years.
   Even in a normal year, Bastille Day celebrations of military
regalia on the Champs-Elysees, dancing in local fire halls and
fireworks in the skies mark July 14 in Paris and provincial towns _
similar to the American 4th of July.
   But organizers are working frantically to make 1989's events
unforgettable.
   They admit to being far behind schedule, partly because both the
first man chosen to head the Bicentennial Mission, businessman
Michel Baroin, and his successor, centrist politician Edgar Faure,
died shortly after taking office, leaving the agency leaderless
until this past May.
   Jean-Noel Jeanneney, the new president of the bicentennial
operation, told reporters recently after meeting with President
Francois Mitterrand that he hoped to have his plans spelled out by
the end of September.
   ``When you have less time to do things, you do them in less
time,'' Jeanneney said. ``Many great events that went down in
history were prepared in extreme haste.''
   The planning was also hung up in political feuding during the
past two years, when the conservative government of Jacques Chirac
was jousting with Mitterrand, a Socialist.
   After Mitterrand's re-election in May and the installation of
Socialist Michel Rocard as premier, the mission's budget was nearly
tripled, to the franc equivalent of about $20 million.
   Chirac, who remains involved in the bicentennial as mayor of
Paris, recently said he had the feeling the Socialists ``want to
profit from this commemoration by emphasizing certain historical
aspects in the presentation, to the detriment of the consensus that
Michel Baroin and Edgar Faure were promoting.''
   The French Revolution has been a focus for political divisions
ever since it began, and the approach of the bicentennial renewed
the debate over what, exactly, was being celebrated.
   There are many variations of the Revolution, but in broad terms
French rightists are likely to say they approve of the abolition of
the nobility's privileges in 1789 and the establishment of the
republic in 1792, but are appalled by the mass executions of the
Terror in 1793-94.
   Some French leftists argue that people should take the
Revolution as an undivided whole _ and be for it or against it.
They suggest that rightists picking and choosing among elements of
the Revolution are closet counter-revolutionaries.
   ``It's surprising that, two centuries later, the founding act of
the Republic remains a propaganda tool and a source of partisan
quarrels and polemics, but it's also a consequence of the
revolutionary heritage itself,'' the independent newspaper Le Monde
wrote in a front-page article summing up the squabbles.
   A poll published in the conservative weekly Le Figaro Magazine
found that, when asked to name which events best symbolize the
Revolution, 74 percent of French people said the Declaration of the
Rights of Man on Oct. 2, 1789, with only 55 percent choosing the
bloody July 14 assault on the Bastille prison.
   Although the Bastille was a hated symbol of repression, and once
housed political prisoners, the revolutionary crowd that
overwhelmed its defenders found only seven inmates to be freed:
four men convicted of fraud, two lunatics, and a nobleman, the
count de Salages, who was imprisoned for incest.
   Le Figaro's poll also found 61 percent saying King Louis XVI
should not have been beheaded at the guillotine, while 14 percent
maintained it was the right thing to do and 25 percent had no
opinion.
   The U.S. bicentennial did not turn up many Americans who thought
the American Revolution was a bad thing, but in France some people
are still against the whole idea of their own uprising.
   ``We think it was a revolt against God and not just a revolt
against power,'' said Jean-Baptiste Chaumeil, a member of a group
hoping to make a counter-revolutionary demonstration Aug. 15, 1989,
at Place de la Concorde _ where the guillotine stood _ one of the
biggest events of the bicentennial year.
   Chaumeil said the group, called Association 15 Aout 1989 (August
15 Association), includes both Royalists, who want France to have a
king again, and Republicans, who oppose any return to the monarchy
but find a celebration of the Revolution's anti-church policies
distasteful.
   For the past year, a monthly newsletter called ``L'Anti-89'' has
been recalling the dark side of the Revolution, especially its
harsh suppression of Roman Catholic clergy.
   The group is distributing a poster showing a revolutionary
carrying a guillotined head on a spike and asks, ``Are We REALLY
Going To Celebrate That?''
   In fact, miniature guillotines for sale as souvenirs are among
the many commercial spinoffs of the bicentennial.
   Textile manufacturer CET has obtained permission to use the
official bicentennial logo, showing three blue-white-and-red doves
in flight, on a line of clothing, and CET director Christian
Mariolle said he expects the T-shirt and the underpants to be the
best-sellers, both in France and as an export.
   The Bastille itself was demolished, but its bells survived and
will be part of an exhibition of revolutionary artifacts touring
the country next year.
   Plans are being laid for elaborate operas at Versailles and for
coverting the Tuileries Gardens between the Louvre and the Place de
la Concorde into a collection of pavilions, games, and expositions
on the bicentennial.
   On a more scholarly note, the weekly Livres-Hebdo counted 205
books on the Revolution to be published before the celebration is
over. Hundreds of colloquiums and seminars have been announced, on
topics ranging from ``The French Revolution and Revolutionary
Vandalism'' to ``The Revolution and Childrens's Books.''
   The bicentennial year will also see the completion of several
major building projects started by Mitterrand early in his first
term _ a new Opera House at the Bastille site, the controversial
glass pyramid of architect I.M. Pei at the Louvre, and a giant
cube-shaped arch under construction at the Western edge of the
city, on a direct line of sight with the Place de la Concorde and
the Arc de Triomphe.
   The new triumphal arch's crosspiece, when open, is to house a
Center for the Study of the Rights of Man, which is supposed to
keep the bicentennial spirit alive in years to come.
   Mitterrand will be busy, both inaugurating his buildings and
welcoming visiting heads of state.
   Next year is France's turn to be host for the economic summit of
leaders of the seven richest industrial democracies and Mitterrand
has persuaded his peers to make the dates July 14-16, rather than
in June, as usual. The new president of the United States will be
one of the seven.
   Mitterrand says he will also invite many other government
leaders, especially from Latin America and the Third World, to come
to Paris at the same time and join in the celebrations.

   France is readying a display of sparkle, power,
culture and whimsy for this week's climax of the French Revolution
bicentennial.
   The focus will be on an assembly of nearly 30 world leaders, on
spectacular parades and fireworks, and on the inauguration of a new
Opera house at the Place de la Bastille, where a mob stormed the
hated Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, to launch the revolution.
   Among the chiefs of state on hand will be President Bush, for the
annual economic summit of the world's seven largest industrial
democracies. By chance, this year is France's turn to be host.
   The result, depending on the point of view, is expected to be the
City of Light at its most enchanting _ or a security-imposed
gridlock on a scale the developed world has never seen.
   It will either be a fitting tribute to one of the founding events
of the modern age, or an exercise in self-congratulation that
ignores both the cruel and brutal side of the Revolution and the
plight of today's poor and oppressed.
   Bicentennial celebrations and commemorations have been in full
swing all year, but the big weekend gets started Thursday, when
President Francois Mitterrand has all his out-of-town guests _ Bush
and the other leaders of the rich countries, but also the leaders of
Bangladesh, Mali, India and Egypt and other countries _ over for
lunch.
   Later on, when the economic summit gets moving, the leaders of
the poor and middle-income countries wind up relegated to a
second-class itinerary _ dinner with Premier Michel Rocard, and the
like _ which reportedly has even Mitterrand's Socialist supporters
uneasy.
   A ``counterbicentennial'' demonstration and concert last weekend,
on the theme that the commemoration should have more to do with the
Third World and less with solemn ceremonies and fancy dinners, drew
an estimated 100,000 people to the Place de la Bastille.
   Apparently Mitterrand's original plan was to mount an encounter
between leaders representing all continents, and rich and poor
countries, but he was unable to win support for the idea from his
summit partners.
   With all the dignitaries dashing about town, Paris will see its
most stringent security ever, including a dirigible looking down
from above, and what are expected to be epochal traffic jams.
   Police say expressways and city streets will be shut without
warning when motorcades of the 30 leaders are about to pass. A chunk
of central Paris is already a no-parking zone and will be off-limits
to ordinary vehicles for three days.
   Thursday night, Bush and the other leaders get a taste of culture
at the inaugural performance in the high-tech Opera house that
Mitterrand has ordered built at the Bastille, just across a busy
square from where the prison once stood.
   The new building, at the gate of the newly upgraded eastern
section of the city, is supposed to bring opera to the people, but
news of its construction has been overshadowed by controversy over
its program.
   Conductor Daniel Barenboim was fired in January over what the
government said were his elitist views and high salary. It took
until May to get a new musical director, and regular performances
will not start until next year.
   Friday is Bastille Day, featuring two severely contrasting
parades on the Champs-Elysees. The traditional military display,
with missiles, tanks, helicopters and fighter planes, makes its
deafening way down the avenue in the morning.
   Later that night, a much-anticipated spectacle choreographed by
the bad boy of French advertising, Jean-Paul Goude, portraying the
ideals of the revolution through twists on national stereotypes.
   ``They are cliches, but I'm trying to be positive with the
cliches,'' Goude said Monday.
   The images range from Britons parading in artificial rain, to
Russians dancing with a bear on ice, to Africans on live zebras to
the Florida A&amp;M University marching band strutting backward all the
way down the avenue.
   ``It's Michael Jackson's Moonwalk,'' Goude said. ``I asked them
if they could do the `Moonwalk' from the Etoile to Concorde and they
said, `No problem.' Very American. They're doing a salute to James
Brown.''
   The summit itself, with chief items on the agenda expected to be
the debt crisis and global environmental action, begins Friday under
the new pyramid entrance to the Louvre museum, which is closed for
three days to give way to the leaders of France, Britain, Italy,
Canada, Japan, West Germany and the United States.
   Most of the meetings, however, will be in the just-finished
cube-shaped arch in the La Defense complex on the capital's western
edge.
   If everyone is not exhausted by Saturday night, they are invited
to watch the city's annual fireworks display near the Eiffel Tower,
wrapping up the bicentennial celebrations with some of the flash and
spark that started it all in July 1789.

   Heads of state streamed into Paris Wednesday, many
hoping to lobby for debt relief from the world's richest nations
during opulent celebrations marking 200 years since the French
Revolution.
   By Friday, 32 leaders were expected for the economic summit,
including government heads from the seven largest industrialized
democracies and 25 more from five continents.
   Also Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney presented
France with a monumental oil painting to hang in the hall of the
Opera Bastille, which was designed by a Canadian architect for the
bicentennial.
   On the eve of the three-day blockbuster celebrations, Mulroney
told French Premier Michel Rocard that ``Point de Rencontre,'' a
huge abstract in glowing primary colors by Canadian painter
Jean-Paul Riopelle, ``celebrates the richness of art and the
creativity and friendship between Canada and France.''
   The gleaming glass-and-steel building designed by Canada's Carlos
Ott overlooks the Place de la Bastille _ the historic site where the
Revolution began 200 years ago when revolutionaries stormed the
infamous prison.
   Pointing to the spectacular panorama of the Paris skyscape _ with
breathtaking views of the Eiffel Tower and the twin spires of Notre
Dame _ Mulroney called Ott's design ``a gigantic sculpture of light
and harmonious curves.''
   Also on hand for the presentation were French Culture Minister
Jack Lang and Pierre Berge, president of the Opera Bastille.
   Berge said he was confident the Opera Bastille's inaugural
concert Thursday, starring some of the biggest names in Opera,
including Teresa Berganza and Placido Domingo, would go off without
a hitch.
   The annual summit meeting of the United States, Japan, West
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada coincides this year with
the French bicentennial.
   The world leaders will attend the opening of the new Opera at the
Bastille, watch two parades and a fireworks show, and gather for
lunches and dinners as Mitterrand's guests.
   Teams of cleaning personnel worked frantically to ready the giant
construction for its unveiling by French President Francois
Mitterrand before a glittering roster of invited guests.
   On Friday, Parisians _ and millions of television viewers
worldwide _ can watch Jean-Paul Goude's funny and funky
opera-ballet-parade called ``La Marseilleise,'' which stars 10,000
international dancers and musicians, elephants, zebras and a dancing
bear.
   Festivities also include 36,000 all-night outdoor balls, a
traditional military parade down the Champs-Elysees on Friday
morning, culminating in a spectacular display of fireworks on
Saturday night.
   The new Opera Bastille will close on July 20 for six months in
preparation for its first bona fide operatic production in February
under the musical direction of South Korean conductor Myung
Whun-Chung.

   A parade of moonwalking U.S. college students,
ponies painted to look like zebras, and a Russian bear on skates
lent fantasy to Saturday's celebration of the 200th anniversary of
the French Revolution.
   It also offered a somber reminder of the price of liberty.
   In a late change of program after last month's repression in
Beijing, hundreds of Chinese students walked bicycles around a giant
red drum. They wore headbands bearing the Chinese characters for
``Liberty, Equality, Fraternity,'' the watchwords of the French
Revolution.
   The 250 musicians of the Florida A&amp;M band, gliding backwards in a
Michael Jackson moonwalk down the Champs-Elysees before a crowd
estimated at 1 million, offered a tribute to American soul star
James Brown.
   They shared the famous avenue with Scottish pipers marching in
artificial rain, Soviet guards walking in fake snow, a huge steam
locomotive, and other creations of the imagination of French
advertising maverick Jean-Paul Goude.
   The $15 million extravaganza of fantasy and symbolism was called
the ``The Marseillaise,'' a parade described by Goude as a
``slightly frivolous opera-ballet.''
   Besides the lively crowds in the street, about 30 presidents and
prime ministers gathered on a balcony overlooking the Place de la
Concorde. They were in Paris to attend the festivities and
participate in an annual summit conference of industrial nations,
which began Friday.
   Television audiences in France and much of Europe also watched
the parade, which began late Friday and extended into early Saturday.
   French television showed British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
peering through binoculars at the 6,000 performers. Viewers saw
President Bush and his wife, Barbara, chatting with other guests as
fireworks lit up the sky.
   Temporary grandstands on the Place de la Concorde held about
16,000 other invited guests, including celebrities and officials.
They also provided seating for French citizens born on July 14 or
with the first name ``France.''
   July 14, or Bastille Day, marks the day 200 years ago when a
group of Parisians stormed a royal prison that once stood at the
Place de la Bastille.
   In an emotional climax of the parade, American opera diva Jessye
Norman, wrapped in the blue, white and red colors of the French
flag, sang the rousing verses of the national anthem, ``The
Marseillaise.''
   Elyiane Picard of Nice, bedecked with revolutionary tricolor
buttons, held on to a few inches of standing space at the base of an
iron fence along the Champs-Elysees for nine hours to watch the show.
   ``The parade is something I never would have wanted to watch on
television,'' she said. ``It's a historic happening, and I wanted to
be able to tell my children I was there.''
   Twelve hours earlier on the same parade route, silver-helmeted
Republican Guards pranced below jet fighters trailing the national
colors in a display of precision, pomp and firepower. More than 250
planes and helicopters streaked down the length of the flag-bedecked
avenue.
   Columns of more than 5,000 men and women, from frogmen to Foreign
Legionnaires, 300 armored vehicles, and unarmed mobile missiles
flowed down the avenue to martial music.
   President Francois Mitterrand reviewed the troops at the Place de
L'Etoile. Then, standing upright in a light reconnaissance vehicle,
he rode down the grand avenue to the Place de la Concorde.
   There, he joined Bush and the other world leaders in the
presidential tribune at the site where the guillotine stood during
the revolution.
   Frenchmen and tourists danced through the night Thursday at balls
around Paris and elsewhere in France. The capital's gala will wind
up later Saturday with the traditional fireworks display at the
Eiffel Tower.
   ``We're here helping to celebrate what we started with our
revolution and the French finished,'' said James M. Young, of
Boston, who brought his family to France for the bicentennial.
   ``This grandeur, beauty, pageantry and feeling of nationality _
this is what we wanted the children to capture.''
   The center of Paris was all but closed to traffic for the day's
events and a security dragnet the government described as the
tightest since World War II was in full evidence. A dirigible with
special security cameras surveyed the crowds before the military
parade began.

   President Bush joined President Francois Mitterrand
and more than 30 other world leaders today to commemorate the French
Revolution's ideals of liberty, equality and fraternity.
   The 15-minute noontime ceremony at the Place du Trocadero
launched a busy weekend of bicentennial parties and international
diplomacy, grouped around the annual summit of the seven biggest
industrial democracies.
   Actors read portions of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and
the Citizen, proclaimed in October 1789 before the French Revolution
turned to terror and tyranny. Interspersed were choral segments and
quotations from revolutionary leaders.
   At the end, children dressed in white ran to a stone inscribed
with the declaration and ringed it with wreaths and flowers. Five
hundred doves were released to fly freely into the almost cloudless
sky.
   The presidents and prime ministers, with several hundred invited
guests, sat in warm sunshine overlooking the Trocadero esplanade and
_ across the Seine River _ the Eiffel Tower.
   The leaders arrived in a steady stream of limousines and were
greeted by Mitterrand. A cheer went up from a crowd on the street
when Philippines President Corazon Aquino arrived.
   Among the other guests were Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India,
President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Mobutu Sese Seko of
Zaire and other African leaders, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez
de Cuellar, Brazilian President Jose Sarney, President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Uruguayan President Julio Maria
Sanguinetti.
   Barbara Bush sat to the left of Danielle Mitterrand in the front
row of a section of temporary stands set aside for the leaders'
spouses.
   The capital was prepared for another Bastille mob scene later in
the day, but unlike the storming 200 years ago that began the French
Revolution, this crowd was gathering for celebration.
   The inaugural concert of the Opera Bastille was expected to
attract a range of dignitaries, including 30 heads of state, and the
cream of French society.
   Operagoers descending the dramatic gray stone staircase leading
to the modern glass-and-steel opera house late tonight were to face
a cultural event of an altogether different sort.
   Thousands of Parisians and tourists will be dancing in the
streets at a bicentennial bash billed as the ``World's Biggest
Ball.''
   The street dance, one of 36,000 outdoor parties taking place in
France during the three-day nationwide celebration, will take
bicentennial bingers into the wee hours of Friday morning.
   A traditional military parade marches down the Champs Elysee
early Friday, accompanied by tanks, fighters and helicopters roaring
overhead.
   In the evening, impresario Jean-Paul Goude's bizarre
opera-ballet-parade called ``La Marseilleise'' will strut and
struggle down the famous avenue in a salute to the international
spirit of 1789.
   Britons will parade in an artificial rain, Russians will dance
with a bear on ice and an American marching band will boogie
backward all the way.
   The parade will be broadcast to millions of viewers worldwide.
   Paris festivities will conclude with a bang, as a spectacular
display of fireworks illuminates the City of Lights on Saturday.

   France on Thursday celebrated the 199th anniversary
of the storming of the Bastille, and the president said he was
inviting leaders of rich and poor nations to help fete the
bicentennial of the French Revolution.
   Tens of thousands of people, celebrating the national holiday,
lined the Champs Elysees to watch the traditional grandiose July 14
military parade.
   Planes trailing exhaust in the blue, white and red of the French
tricolor swept low over the Champs Elysees to open the parade of
6,000 men, 120 aircraft, 500 land vehicles and 300 members of the
cavalry.
   President Francois Mitterrand reviewed the troops at the Arch of
Triumph, now draped in tricolor to hide renovation work, then moved
down the avenue to the reviewing stand at the Place de la Concorde.
   Twelve Mirage 2000 Ns, designed to carry nuclear missiles, made
their first public appearance in a sweep over the Champs Elysees,
as Foreign Legionaires with white kepis and the Republican Guard
with feathered brass helmets strutted below.
   More than 4,000 invited guests attended a garden party at the
presidential Elysee Palace, where from a back lawn Mitterrand gave
a televised interview, his eighth such July 14 interview since
coming to power in 1981.
   Thursday night, a massive fireworks display designed to call in
the year of the bicentennial was planned at the Palais de Chaillot,
facing the Eiffel Tower across the Seine river.
   The storming of the ancient Bastille prison on July 14, 1789,
where just seven prisoners were held, led to the fall of the French
monarchy and the proclamation of the republic three years later.
   ``I want the Third World to be present that day,'' Mitterrand
said of next year's bicentennial celebrations. ``This universal
presence in Paris of a world so different in its realities ... is a
great thing.''
   Leaders of the seven major industrialized democracies are to
hold their annual summit meeting in Paris July 14-16, 1989, it was
announced at the Toronto summit in June.
   Mitterrand said Thursday he planned to invite ``many heads of
state or government from poor countries, our African friends, from
Latin American countries.''

   France uncorked three days of bicentennial hoopla
Thursday by inaugurating a gleaming, high-tech opera house at the
site of the Bastille, the despised prison where its revolution began.
   President Francois Mitterrand, President Bush, and their wives
sat in front-row balcony seats at the Opera Bastille for an opening
concert featuring singers Placido Domingo and Barbara Hendricks.
   Also present were 32 other presidents and prime ministers who
came to Paris for this weekend's celebrations of the revolution's
200th anniversary and for the annual summit of the world's seven
richest countries.
   Sharpshooters were posted on rooftops and in windows of buildings
surrounding the Place de la Bastille as the leaders arrived.
Authorities have clamped tight and highly visible security around
the capital this week.
   Later Thursday, more than 100,000 people jammed into the large
circular plaza for the beginning of the largest of about 30,000
outdoor popular balls around the country to celebrate Bastille Day
on Friday.
   Surrounding streets were packed with people of all ages, enjoying
the balmy summer night. The air was filled with the smell of
grilling sausages and the sounds of exploding firecrackers and
accordion music pouring from a giant white tent opposite the new
Opera.
   ``I usually prefer smaller parties, but I wanted to come be part
of the most popular of French celebrations,'' said Gilles Driate,
from a southeastern suburb. He then grabbed the hand of a surprised
and delighted lady with gray hair, and they danced away.
   Meanwhile, Mitterrand and his guests had a late dinner at the
Musee d'Orsay, the spectacular museum of 19th century art converted
from a train station.
   Earlier in the day at the Opera Bastille, the political leaders
were joined by a star-studded crowd including actress Catherine
Deneuve, tennis player Yannick Noah, and Nobel Peace Prize-winning
author Elie Wiesel.
   A rousing orchestral rendition of the Marseillaise, the French
national anthem, opened the show. The 75-minute program ended with
an even more stirring version, with all the performers joining in.
   Bush, smiling broadly, applauded enthusiastically as the show
closed.
   The visiting leaders earlier joined Mitterrand in an outdoor
ceremony honoring the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the
Citizen proclaimed in 1789.
   Mitterrand was flanked by Bush at the Trocadero, across the Seine
from the Eiffel Tower, during the brief celebration of what many
consider the chief legacy of the French Revolution.
   At the new opera house, Domingo, Miss Hendricks and Teresa
Berganza sang selections from French operas such as Charles-Francois
Gounod's ``Faust'' and Camille Saint-Saen's ``Samson and Delila.''
   France's Georges Pretre conducted the orchestra and chorus of the
Orchestre de Paris in a work titled ``La Nuit d'avant le Jour,'' or
``The Night Before the Day.'' The staging and the stark, elegant
decor were the work of American Bob Wilson, the darling of French
avant-garde theater.
   The Opera Bastille was conceived early in Mitterrand's first
presidential term as a much-needed alternative to the ornate but
inadequate Palais Garnier, known worldwide as the Paris Opera.
   From the start, the project was beset with administrative,
political and financial problems, and it even came close to being
canceled.
   Designed by Canadian architect Carlos Ott, the huge
glass-and-steel building boasts state-of-the-art sound, lighting and
staging technology, including special acoustical fire curtains, a
movable proscenium and electronically controlled stage dollies that
bring in sets for an entire opera in minutes.
   The 2,700-seat main auditorium _ a contemporary blend of black
and white with oak-paneled walls and hardwood floors _ was designed
for acoustics.
   Expert opinion on the new hall was not all positive, however.
Music critic Frank Erikson of the weekly L'Express said he was
``terribly disappointed'' by the hall's acoustics.
   ``The voices do not project into the room,'' he said. ``The
singers were standing at the edge of the stage and yet the sound was
completely muffled. This is quite serious.''
   The Opera Bastille, which is shaped like an ocean liner, was
captainless until May when Myung-Whun Chung of South Korea was named
musical director by Pierre Berge, the financial wizard behind the
Yves-Saint Laurent fashion empire. Berge was chosen by Mitterrand to
oversee the project in its final days.
   Chung, a soft-spoken but determined optimist known as a
consummate artist, fills the vacancy left in January when Berge
fired Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim for his high fees and
elitist ideas about opera.
   Chung has promised to present the first production in February.
The Opera Bastille will close July 20 so the building can be
finished.
   The human rights celebration at the Trocadero was a simple but
dramatic reading of the 17 articles of declaration adopted by the
French National Assembly on Aug. 26, 1789.
   Punctuating the reading was a group of 48 children singing ``The
Song of Joy,'' a hymn composed for the occasion. The choir members,
who have been rehearsing since July 1, were from the United States,
Poland, Finland, the Soviet Union, West Germany, France, Japan,
Rwanda, Togo, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Hungary, Lebanon and the
Philippines.
   The three American singers were from the Phoenix, Ariz., Boys'
Choir. ``We wanted to symbolize peace,'' said Harvey Smith, director
of the Phoenix choir who helped train the Paris group. ``The
children brought things from their world and shared them with those
here today.''

   One hundred and ninety-nine years ago, the Marquis
de la Fayette gave the key to the Bastille to President George
Washington. On Thursday, the Americans gave it back. Well, for a
week anyway.
   The Bastille was the central Paris prison stormed by the populace
on July 14, 1789. That action became the symbol of the French
Revolution.
   The Bastille later was destroyed. But the marquis, who served as
a general under Washington during the American Revolution, made a
gift of the key as ``a tribute, which I owe as a son to my adopted
father, as an aide de camp to my general, as a missionary of liberty
to its patriarch.''
   The key has hung in the central corridor of Washington's Virginia
home, Mount Vernon, since the end of his presidency.
   The key was presented to President Francois Mitterrand on
nine-day loan by Eugenia Seamans, regent of the Mount Vernon Ladies'
Association, a non-profit organization that has owned and operated
Mount Vernon since 1858.
   The large iron key will be displayed through July 22 at the new
Paris Opera on the Place de la Bastille in central Paris, next to
where the prison once stood, as part of France's bicentennial
celebrations.
   The very brief ceremony was held at the Elysee Palace immediately
after the 40-minute meeting between Mitterrand and President Bush,
here for the bicentennial festivities and to attend the summit of
the seven major industrial democracies.
   As Bush looked on, Mrs. Seaman told the French president it had
hung in the central hall of Mount Vernon since 1797.
   ``Now it's again in Paris,'' she said, handing transparent box
containing the key to a beaming Mitterrand.
   As photographers and cameraman recorded the event, Mitterrand
shook hands with Bush and said: ``I thank the successors of
Washington.''
   The loan of the key was arranged through the American Embassy in
Paris and the U.S. Information Agency.
   By Aug. 1, the famous key is expected to be hanging back in the
hallway of the Mount Vernon mansion.

   They weren't celebrating Bastille Day in
Paris, Ind. As a matter of fact, some folks wouldn't have known what
to celebrate.
   ``No, I wasn't made known of it,'' said Brack Feltner, who lives
at the only intersection in this southern Indiana town.
   Reiner Assmann, the native West German who runs the Paris
Crossing Market a few miles down the road, had some idea about
France's Independence Day.
   ``I know what that is because in Paris, they got the Bastille.
That's a prison, isn't it? It had something to do with the
revolution, didn't it?'' Assmann said.
   World leaders were gathered in Paris, France, for Friday's 200th
anniversary of the storming of the Bastille. The July 14, 1789,
takeover of the prison and symbol of oppression under Louis XVI
galvanized a spirit of freedom and marked the start of the French
Revolution.
   That doesn't get much notice in Paris, Ind., however, where
questions about what was being done to mark the occasion drew blank
stares. By noon Friday, not even a television camera had showed up
to mark the day.
   It was much the same story for Parisians in Arkansas, Idaho and
Illinois, who also largely shrugged off the holiday.
   ``Do what? Bastille Day? Not that I know of,'' said City Clerk
Bill Rhineheart in Paris, Ark.
   ``It's too bad we don't have a celebration for the Bastille
Day,'' said Tim Toland, the mayor of Paris, Idaho, which as it
happens is named for a fellow named Perris. ``But we're a Mormon
community and this year is the 100th anniversary of our tabernacle.''
   A bit more was planned in Paris, Texas, which became slightly
famous when an arty movie was made with that name some years back.
They planned a community spaghetti dinner and a production of
``Macbeth'' Friday night, as well as a French-style bicycle race on
Saturday.
   Why Shakespeare and spaghetti? Spaghetti because it's full of
carbohydrates for the bicyclists, and ``Macbeth'' because the
community theater season happened to include that play for July 14,
said Mal Watson, an organizer of the weekend's events.
   Paris, Ind., with a population of 25 or 30, is about 40 miles
southwest of Versailles (pronounced ver-SAYLES). It was once a
thriving community but now is just a clump of houses overshadowed by
its neighbor to the west, Paris Crossing, or, as it is known
locally, New Paris.
   How did Paris, Ind., get its name? If anyone would know, it
probably would be Ethel Deputy, 92, a former schoolteacher who lives
with her sister, Cora Dodd, 98, a few doors down from the store.
   ``I asked my mother the same thing, and she was 87 when I asked
her, and she couldn't tell,'' Miss Deputy said. ``But her family
came from Paris, Kentucky.''
   No one in Paris can speak French, residents say, nor can any
recall anyone ever visiting their European namesake. But a few years
ago, a group of French Parisians came to the Jennings County town.
   ``Some time back they came, some fellows from France, and they
was visiting all the places named Paris, taking pictures and getting
some history,'' Feltner said.
   Paris has a proud history. Back in the '20s _ the 1820s _ it
received the votes of two delegates in the election to choose a new
state capital. (Indianapolis won.) Its tailors were famous for their
suits, and men that wore them turned heads when they ventured into
nearby Madison. People would say, ``There's a man with a suit from
Paris,'' Feltner says.
   But Paris' fate was sealed when it was bypassed by the railroad.
Now, from Feltner's front yard, you can see only about a dozen homes
and as many outbuildings. Across the street is an empty lot with
lawn ornaments.
   ``There was a grocery store here where that deer is, and it
caught fire,'' Feltner said. Now, if you want groceries, the nearest
place to buy them is Assmann's store, a little ways down the highway
in New Paris, where about 200 people reside.
   Assmann said he knew of no ceremonies that would mark Bastille
Day in the community.
   ``But don't let that fool you,'' he said. ``These quiet towns,
they can get rattled up.''

   More tourists than ever are flooding Paris,
storming museums, mobbing hotels and crowding cafes to kick off
celebrations marking the French Revolution bicentennial.
   Even though events are just beginning, the Paris Tourism Office
says the capital already has 20 percent more visitors than at this
time in 1988.
   And nationwide, officials expect to break last year's record of
38 million visitors.
   ``There are going to be a lot of people in France,'' said Xavier
Beguin Billecocq, a tourism official with the Maison de la France.
``This year we expect an increase of about 15 percent.''
   Large-scale bicentennial events will begin in May, but plenty of
visitors are already in town.
   Nathalie Paul, a spokeswoman at the Paris Tourism Office, said
hotel rooms were filling up fast.
   ``We couldn't get into the Louvre yesterday. The line was
incredible,'' said Judith Goldberg of New York City. She waited in
line with hundreds of others outside the Musee d'Orsay, the Paris
showcase for 19th century art.
   As many as 50,000 tourists and Parisians have crowded the Louvre
daily since the museum's new pyramid entrance opened on March 29.
The Louvre renovations were scheduled to be completed in time for
bicentennial celebrations.
   But besides visiting the Louvre _ a museum since the early years
of the revolution _ and a few small exhibitions, tourists have few
bicentennial events to attend until next month.
   On May 4, the procession that opened the Estates General will be
recreated in Versailles. Two hundred years ago, the First, Second
and Third Estates _ representatives of the nobility, clergy and
commoners _ met to express the grievances that set the revolution
in motion.
   From May 5 to Nov. 11, Paris tourists can visit a mini-theme
park being set up in the elegant Tuileries Gardens, between the
Louvre and the Place de la Concorde.
   Organizers expect at least 3.5 million people to pay the
equivalent of three dollars to visit the park, which includes two
small cinemas, an exhibition hall, a theater, souvenir stands, two
cafes and six bars.
   Two 118-foot ``Towers of Liberty'' will mark the recreation area
and 32 actors in period costume will perform or wander among the
tourists portraying revolutionary figures.
   The Maison de la France has counted 6,000 bicentennial events
nationwide, from dances and fireworks to arcane academic seminars,
and published a list of 200 considered likely to interest tourists.
   The Eiffel Tower, built for the revolution's centennial
celebrations, marks its own 100th birthday this year, with special
festivities on June 17-18.
   A special U.S. homage to the revolution is scheduled July 8,
with bands from each of the 50 states parading through Paris. That
evening, the American Waterways Wind Orchestra will play from a
barge in the Seine River to a crowd before City Hall.
   The lucky few, including President Bush, will attend the July 13
opening night of the new Bastille Opera. The theater is being built
near where the Bastille was seized on July 14, 1789, the most
memorable event of the confused and turbulent revolutionary years.
   Musicians will play until dawn in what is being described as the
world's biggest ball.
   Bush, President Francois Mitterrand and the leaders of Britain,
West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada will hold the annual
seven-nation economic summit in Paris from July 14-16. Meetings
will be interspersed with bicentennial parades, fireworks and the
like.
   While Paris hosts the largest number of revolutionary
commemorations, the provinces are not left out. Among the
highlights will be an assembly of Tall Ships from July 9-16 in
Rouen and a gathering of 987 hot-air balloons near the small
village of Gouin in eastern France from July 26 to Aug. 6.

   From I.M. Pei's glass pyramid at the Louvre to
the woefully behind-schedule Bastille Opera, it is the best of times
and the worst of times for the observance of the French
Bicentennial. As the day of the big celebration on July 14
approaches, the French are less enthusiastic about their
bicentennial than Americans were about theirs. ``What is there to
celebrate?'' one Frenchman asks. ``It was a time of shame.''

   Restaurant Le Procope, where Voltaire, Danton and
Robespierre brooded over a beaker of vin rouge, has some interesting
items on its ``Menu du Bicentenaire,'' celebrating the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution.
   For 289 francs, about $43, service compris (tip included), one
may choose:
   _Le Poussin en Bastille _ baby chicken baked in a latticed pastry
crust evoking the fortress prison that fell to the rebels on July
14, l789.
   _La Tete de Veau Docteur Guillotin aux deux sauces _ calf's head
memorializing Joseph Ignace Guillotin, the physician who advocated a
more humane, more democratic method of executing traitors to the
revolution than garroting or breaking them on the wheel. He
prescribed beheading, only to die on his own contraption.
   _La Charlotte Corday et Son Coulis Rouge _ a whipped-cream
dessert with a collar of raspberry jelly in memory of Charlotte
Corday, the convent novice from Calvados who went to the guillotine
for stabbing the murderous madman Jean Paul Marat to death in his
bathtub.
   Alors, since France abolished capital punishment eight years ago,
none of the four surviving guillotines is on display, although one
recently sold at a Paris auction for $40,000. But souvenirs recall
``the national razor that shaved close,'' as Charles Dickens called
the invention that dispatched Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Mesdames
du Barry and Roland, the chemist Antoine Lavoisier, the astronomer
Jean Bailly, Georges Jacques Danton and Maximilien de Robespierre,
among 2,625 in Paris alone.
   The deadly machine that at the height of the Reign of Terror was
severing 60 heads a day is evoked on T-shirts, plates and ashtrays,
plastic key rings, rubber face masks of the doomed king and queen,
and wool shawls inspired by the sadistic harridans who knitted and
gossiped at the foot of the scaffold while heads rolled.
   As part of ``la fete de la Revolution,'' tenor Placido Domingo
will sing the title role of ``Andrea Chenier,'' the poet whose heart
melted as Mademoiselle Corday ascended the guillotine, then lost his
own head when the custodians of the Terror confused him with his
anarchist brother.
   Umberto Giordano's tragic opera is being staged in the gardens at
Versailles, where Louis XVI was busy at his hobby of shooting cats
off the roof that muggy July day when the mob stormed the Bastille.
They had hoped to release hundreds of political prisoners but found
only four lunatics, who were transferred to the asylum at Charenton,
two counterfeiters and a nobleman accused of incest.
   The rebels seized some arms and ammunition and decapitated
Bernard de Launey, the prison governor, parading his head about town
on a pitchfork.
   ``Rien,'' the king wrote in his diary: Nothing of importance
today.
   Next morning the mob began razing the eight-towered prison where
Voltaire once was a guest for hinting that the regent Philippe
d'Orleans committed incest with his daughter and where that young
whippersnapper the Marquis de Sade had time to pen some sexy memoirs
of pleasure and pain.
   Twice a day at rush hour, motorists still storm Place de La
Bastille, with its monument marking the start of the revolution,
creating l'embouteillage, the French word for gridlock, literally
``bottled up.''
   The excavated remains of one of the prison towers is on view in
the Bastille Metro stop. Among a vast collection of bicentennial
artifacts, including Marie Antoinette's prison cell dressing table
and the only statue of Louis XVI to survive the revolution, the
Carnavalet Museum is exhibiting a miniature Bastille carved from one
of the original blocks.
   Contractor Henri Palloy, entrusted with the demolition of the
prison, made a fortune selling these miniatures, but ended up with
his neck in the guillotine. No such consumer protection against
revolutionary schlock is available this time around.
   For President Francois Mitterrand, the bicentennial is the best
of times and the worst of times.
   His pet project, the Bastille Opera, is woefully behind schedule,
torn by political and artistic dissension and the subject of public
ridicule.
   ``C'est une blague'' _ it's a joke _ derided a taxi driver who on
screaming tires skirted the glass-sheathed edifice where on the
bicentennial eve President Bush and other world figures will
interrupt the cacophony of the hard hats to attend a concert with
Mitterrand inaugurating the unfinished auditorium.

   Leaders of the seven industrialized democracies
agreed Tuesday to hold a summit again next year, in France, at the
height of the spectacular celebrations that President Francois
Mitterrand is producing for the bicentennial of the launching of
the French Revolution.
   As they closed the 14th annual summit of the world's economic
powers after three days of talks, the leaders said the
get-togethers have been good for their own countries and for the
rest of the world.
   ``The economic summits have helped to sustain the values of
democracy that underlie our economic and political systems,'' said
a draft of the final communique.
   It said the meetings have given the leaders a chance ``to
reflect, in an informal and flexible manner, upon their common
responsiblity for the progress of the world economy and to resolve
how that responsibility should have practical manifestation in the
years ahead.''
   The Toronto summit concluded the second ''cycle'' in which each
of the seven countries in turn acted as host to its peers.
   Next year's three-day gathering in Paris _ starting on Bastille
Day, July 14, the national holiday _ will be the start of another
round of seven meetings running through 1995.
   ``We believe that the mutual understanding engendered in our
meetings has benefitted both our own countries and the wider world
community,'' the leaders said. ``We believe, too, that the
opportunities afforded by our meetings are becoming even more
valuable in today's world of increasing inter-dependence and
increasing technological change.''
   The tradition of economic summits was started in 1975, when
French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing invited his counterparts
from the United States, Britain, Japan, West Germany and Italy to
the Renaissance chateau of Rambouillet southwest of Paris for some
informal talks out of the glare of the spotlights.
   In succeeding years, the Canadian prime minister and the
president of the European Economic Community were added to the
annual talks. The discussions have become more tightly structured,
with officials working months in advance on the final communique,
and have attracted ever-increasing platoons of journalists _ some
3,000 of them in Toronto.
   Next year's meeting will be the third in France, and the second
with Mitterrand as host. In 1982, his second year in office, he
staged the summit in the chateau of Versailles, with its atmosphere
of glittering elegance from the days when Louis XIV reigned there
three centuries ago.
   Bicentennial preparations have been under way for years, and
have been a preoccupation of Mitterrand's since his 1981 election.
His re-election last month to a second seven-year term gives him a
chance to preside over the celebrations.
   In his first term, Mitterrand launched such projects as a new
Opera House, renovation of the Louvre museum and construction of a
huge arch in the form of a cube at the western gates of Paris _ all
to be completed in time for the anniversary of the July 14, 1789,
seizing of the Bastille prison which launched the revolution.
   The approach of the bicentennial has sparked a debate in France
over who is the true heir of the revolution's spirit _ the
conservatives with their devotion to individual liberties, or the
leftists _ like Mitterrand _ with their challenge to entrenched
privilege and to the rich.
   Adding the summit to the menu of concerts, historical
reproductions and giant fireworks displays will give the French a
chance to speculate about what such revolutionaries as Danton and
Robespierre might have thought about the gathering of the world's
richest nations.
   While both previous French summits have been held in chateau
settings reminiscent of the nation's Renaissance grandeur, a likely
candidate for next year's meeting is the shiny new
commercial-residential complex of La Defense at the western edge of
the capital, a symbol of a new France of high technology and rapid
modernization.
   Two miles west of the Arc de Triomphe, La Defense is the 20th
century prolongation to the famed east-west axis in Paris, leading
from the Louvre through the Place de la Concorde and along the
Champs-Elysee.
   A showcase of architectural fantasies, the complex houses more
than 300 companies where some 60,000 people work. Nearly 40,000
live in the residential secion.
   Spread over nearly 2,470 acres on a bluff, La Defense is crowned
by a gigantic ultra-modern cube-shaped arch now under construction,
which will be an office building. The design by Danish architect
Otto Van Sprecklsen was chosen personally by Mitterrand.
   La Defense takes its name from a monument on the site
commemorating the defense of Paris in 1871 when the French held off
the Germans in the Franco-Prussian war.
   The complex is a five-minute ride from central Paris on the RER,
a network of suburban express trains linked to the Paris Metro.

President Bush, buoyed by his landmark visit to Eastern Europe, joined dozens 
of world leaders today for a spectacular Parisian party celebrating the 200th 
anniversary of the French Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Bush helped kick off the festivities by presenting to France the historic key 
to the Bastille fortress, birthplace of a rebellion against the French crown 
two centuries ago. The key, in U.S. hands since 1790, is on temporary loan. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was greeted by French President Francois Mitterrand at the inaugural 
bicentennial event at the Place du Trocadero commemorating the Declaration of 
the Rights of Man. That statement, issued in August, 1789, set forth the French 
Revolution's aims of liberty, fraternity and equality for all people. 
</P>
<P>
The world leaders sat on a blue-and-white grandstand listening to a young man 
and woman who took turns reading the 17 articles of the declaration. A 
children's choir dressed in white sang a "song of joy," played games and threw 
peace laurels, flowers and children's toys on the esplanade. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the ceremony, the leaders burst into applause as a flock of doves 
flew over the palace. Then, chatting amiably, they left for a lunch given by 
Mitterrand, who sat next to Bush during the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Security was tight with an estimated 30,000 police, including rooftop marksmen, 
guarding the summit events. Police also towed away about 1,000 vehicles as part 
of their ban on traffic in the main thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
In Paris, Mitterrand greeted each leader arriving by limousine at the ceremony 
site near the Eiffel Tower. The crowd in the street cheered when Philippines 
President Corazon Aquino appeared. Other guests included Prime Minister Rajiv 
Gandhi of India, President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Mobutu Sese 
Seko of Zaire and other African leaders, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de 
Cuellar, Brazilian President Jose Sarney, Mexican President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari and Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, after a private 40-minute meeting with Mitterrand, Bush took 
part in ceremonies marking the return -- actually a brief loan -- of the key to 
the Bastille, the site where the French Revolution began when the fortress was 
stormed in an uprising against the crown on July 14, 1789. 
</P>
<P>
Bush presented the large iron Bastille key to Mitterrand for display through 
July 22 at the new Bastille Opera house, adjacent to the site of the famous 
fortress. 
</P>
<P>
The key was given to George Washington nearly 200 years ago by the Marquis de 
Lafayette. Since 1797, the key has never left Washington's estate in northern 
Virginia. Since 1858, the historic artifact has been in the possession of the 
Mount Vernon Ladies' Assn., the private, nonprofit organization that owns and 
operates Washington's home.

   Milwaukee is rolling out the guillotine, New York is
showing what well-dressed nobility wore to the dungeon in 1789 and
dozens of other American cities are planning hundreds of events to
celebrate the bicentennial of the French Revolution.
   ``Americans love a party, they love a bicentennial and they love
France. The French Revolution is a natural,'' said Christopher
Henze, cultural attache at the U.S. Embassy in Paris. Henze is
keeping track of more than 300 concerts, exhibits, symposiums,
festivals, film series and TV shows taking place across the United
States in 1989.
   Birmingham, Ala., alone has an events list nine pages long that
includes ``Marcel Proust at the University of Alabama'' lectures,
wine tastings, productions of Moliere's ``Tartuffe'' and cooking
classes by a chef from Paris' famed Le Cordon Bleu.
   The French are enthusiastic about the American revolutionary
fervor and have decided to send the original Declaration of the
Rights of Man and Citizen to an exhibit at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington next spring. It will be the first time
France's most precious document has been on display anywhere since
it was locked away in 1791 when it was embodied as the preamble to
the French constitution.
   The Declaration was drafted in 1789 by Emmanuel Sieyes, the
French statesman and clergyman, and mirrored the ideas of the
liberal Enlightenment. It spoke of the equality of men and the
inalienable rights to security, liberty and property.
   The founding document of the French Republic will be flown across
the Atlantic on April 18 on another source of French pride, the
supersonic Concorde, which will be on view for a short while at the
Smithsonian's Aerospace Museum.
   ``That a single small country like France can have itself
represented by a beautiful jet like the Concorde and a document like
the Declaration of the Rights of Man is incredible,'' said Sir
Valentine Abdy, the Smithsonian's representative in Europe. He has
arranged for a Concorde plane to be given to the Smithsonian when it
goes out of service.
   French musicians and Americans of French ancestry will play on
the Washington Mall June 30-July 4, at about the time the
Smithsonian's New York branch, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, is
displaying the best objects from two centuries of French decorative
art and design.
   The $2.5 million cost of the ``L'Art de Vivre'' exhibit is being
paid by the French Comite Colbert, a group of luxury goods companies
such as Krug Champagne and Hermes.
   Cartier jewelry will sparkle in museums in New Orleans, San Diego
and elsewhere. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York will show
fashions from ``The Age of Napolean: Costume From Revolution to
Empire.'' Artist Gustave Corbet will be reconsidered at the Brooklyn
Museum in an exhibit that will later travel to Minneapolis. And, for
lovers of the printed word, The New York Public Library will offer
the ``Revolution in Print,'' a collection of books, broadsides,
prints, posters, manuscripts and periodicals, many on loan from the
Bibliotheque Nationale.
   French dancers from the Paris Opera Ballet and other companies
will pirouette across stages from North Carolina to Massachusetts.
Daniel Barenboim will lead the Orchestre de Paris on a seven-city
tour including stops in Chicago and at New York's Carnegie Hall. And
French arias will resound in opera halls in Texas, California and
Washingon, D.C.
   Keyboardist Ray Charles and saxophonist Dexter Gordon will swing
with French jazzmen Claude Bolling and Claude Nougaro at Carnegie
Hall in a concert series that will have other musicians jamming at
Washington's Kennedy Center for the Arts, Chicago's Orchestra Hall
and the Los Angeles' Universal Amphitheatre.
   What does jazz have to do with the French Revolution?
   ``Nothing. But it's a chance to celebrate the role of the French
over several decades in giving black American musicians the right to
work, the freedom to express themselves and the support of dedicated
audiences,'' said Edward Tuck, who will produce a television show
from the concerts and have interviews with musicians who have lived
and worked in Paris. Such artists have have included the late
composers and pianists Thelonius Monk and Bud Powell.
   Tuck, who is also president of the French-American Foundation,
said the number and variety of U.S. celebrations reflect America's
awareness that the French Revolution was the basis not only for the
Declaration of Human Rights adopted Aug. 26, 1789, but also for the
U.S. Bill of Rights, adopted 30 days later.
   ``And that is no coincidence,'' he said. ``Ideas ricocheted
between the great thinkers of our two countries. It is the
anniversary of a tradition that produced the common notion that a
government is meant to defend the human rights that each individual
is born with.''
   Celebrations will crescendo on Bastille Day, July 14, when 200
years ago a mob stormed the prison for guns but found only seven
prisoners instead. The day marked the beginning of lower-class
participation in the revolution, which had been led by the
bourgeoisie (middle class) against the aristocrats and the clergy.
   In Milwaukee, more than 200,000 people are expected to attend a
four-day festival where food vendors will cook crepes and frog-legs
kabobs to be washed down with champagne, ``or rather American bubbly
white wine, because it's cheaper,'' said Betsy Kohler, who is
coordinating the event.
   There will be a mock Arc de Triomphe constructed as the finish
line for a midnight run, not to mention the ever-popular guillotine.
   ``We had one last year and everyone liked it,'' Kohler said.
``It's the kind of thing where someone puts their head in a hole and
someone else takes their picture. Also, it's very nicely painted and
has the history of the revolution printed on it.
   ``A lot of people are going to learn about the French Revolution
this year.''

   President Bush supplied the key to help unlock the
biggest birthday party in French history Thursday as swanky dinners
and the opera took center stage after the president's four-day trip
to Eastern Europe.
   Bush and more than 30 other world leaders were treated to a swirl
of festivities celebrating the 200th anniversary of the French
Revolution.
   The events ranged from a solemn ceremony commemorating the
drafting of the French version of America's Declaration of
Independence to an offbeat parade capping the celebration Friday
that will feature Russians dancing with a bear on ice, Britons
marching under artificial rain and a Florida band moonwalking up the
famed Champs Elysee.
   To guard against terrorist attacks, 30,000 police were deployed
around the city with rooftop marksmen and even ground-to-air
missiles added to the security dragnet.
   Amid the hoopla of the birthday bash, more weighty issues were
being discussed as well. The president's other reason for being in
Paris was to attend his first economic summit of the leaders of the
world's seven richest nations.
   The 15th annual economic conference among the leaders of the
United States, Japan, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy and
Canada was to feature for the first time a major emphasis on ways to
clean up the global environment.
   With his historic trip to Poland and Hungary still very much on
his mind, Bush indicated he would be urging the other summit leaders
to step forward with assistance packages of their own to further
economic and political reform behind the Iron Curtain.
   Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on the flight from
Budapest to Paris, Bush said he believed his four-day trip had
``given encouragement to those who want to go the path of reform,
political change, economic change.''
   His national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, said the
president would encourage his summit partners to create a
``clearinghouse'' to avoid duplication of the assistance packages
offered by the rich nations.
   On the Middle East, Bush said that the United States would not
relax its policy of opposing Israeli settlements in the occupied
territories in order to accommodate political turmoil in Israel, a
country Bush conceded is best by ``great difficulties.''
   Bush was greeted by French President Francois Mitterrand, with
whom he later met, at the inaugural bicentennial event, a reading of
the Declaration of the Rights of Man, the document that proclaimed
in October 1789 the French Revolution's aims of liberty, equality
and fraternity for all.
   At the end of the ceremony at the historic Place du Trocadero,
children threw peace laurels, flowers and children's toys on a stone
inscribed with the declaration while 500 doves were released into a
cloudless sky.
   Bush also participated in a ceremony in which the key to the
Bastille prison was turned over to Mitterrand. The Bastille was the
central Paris prison stormed by the populace on July 14, 1789,
setting off the revolution.
   The key to the fortress had been presented 199 years ago to
President George Washington by the Marquis de la Fayette, who had
served as a general under Washington during the American Revolution.
   The key ceremony represented a brief loan with the artifact
headed back to Washington's home in northern Virginia after the
bicentennial is over.
   Bush and the other world leaders attended the inaugural concert
of the Opera Bastille Thursday night where they descended a dramatic
gray stone staircase leading to the modern glass-and-steel opera
house.
   Mitterand, who considers himself a champion of the rights of the
poor, invited several leaders of poor Third World countries to
partake in the festivities, hoping to formulate a dialogue between
the haves and have-nots.
   Leaders from both the rich and poor nations dined together
Thursday night on an opulent meal of lobster with artichokes, lamb,
Roquefort cheese with figs and nuts and, for dessert, almond ice
cream with apricot sauce. They washed it all down with four
different wines.
   The leaders of Egypt, India, Venezuela and Senegal issued a call
to Mitterrand to help organize a North-South summit between
developed and developing nations and the French president endorsed
the idea.
   East-West relations and developments in Eastern Europe, said
French presidential spokesman Hubert Vedrine, figured prominently in
Mitterrand's 40-minute discussions with Bush. ``The two men are on
the same wavelength,'' Vedrine told reporters.
   He said Bush and Mitterrand agreed the economic and democratic
reforms in Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union ``offer a whole new
perspective for the first time in 40 years.''

Washingon, D.C.
   Keyboardist Ray Charles and saxophonist Dexter Gordon will swing
with French jazzmen Claude Bolling and Claude Nougaro at Carnegie
Hall in a concert series that will have other musicians jamming at
Washington's Kennedy Center for the Arts, Chicago's Orchestra Hall
and the Los Angeles' Universal Amphitheatre.
   What does jazz have to do with the French Revolution?
   ``Nothing. But it's a chance to celebrate the role of the French
over several decades in giving black American musicians the right to
work, the freedom to express themselves and the support of dedicated
audiences,'' said Edward Tuck, who will produce a television show
from the concerts and have interviews with musicians who have lived
and worked in Paris. Such artists have have included the late
composers and pianists Thelonius Monk and Bud Powell.
   Tuck, who is also president of the French-American Foundation,
said the number and variety of U.S. celebrations reflect America's
awareness that the French Revolution was the basis not only for the
Declaration of Human Rights adopted Aug. 26, 1789, but also for the
U.S. Bill of Rights, adopted 30 days later.
   ``And that is no coincidence,'' he said. ``Ideas ricocheted
between the great thinkers of our two countries. It is the
anniversary of a tradition that produced the common notion that a
government is meant to defend the human rights that each individual
is born with.''
   Celebrations will crescendo on Bastille Day, July 14, when 200
years ago a mob stormed the prison for guns but found only seven
prisoners instead. The day marked the beginning of lower-class
participation in the revolution, which had been led by the
bourgeoisie (middle class) against the aristocrats and the clergy.
   In Milwaukee, more than 200,000 people are expected to attend a
four-day festival where food vendors will cook crepes and frog-legs
kabobs to be washed down with champagne, ``or rather American bubbly
white wine, because it's cheaper,'' said Betsy Kohler, who is
coordinating the event.
   There will be a mock Arc de Triomphe constructed as the finish
line for a midnight run, not to mention the ever-popular guillotine.
   ``We had one last year and everyone liked it,'' Kohler said.
``It's the kind of thing where someone puts their head in a hole and
someone else takes their picture. Also, it's very nicely painted and
has the history of the revolution printed on it.
   ``A lot of people are going to learn about the French Revolution
this year.''

   France brought its glory days to a crescendo
Saturday by saluting its revolution's bicentennial with a storm of
sound and color over the city many French regard as the capital of
the world.
   A 45-minute spray of 170,000 rockets over the Eiffel Tower at
nightfall followed early morning fireworks.
   Before a final bouquet of multicolored bursts in the evening
show, jostling crowds gasped at the piece de resistance: a
200-foot-wide fresco of blue and red framing a white outline of a
ship symbolizing Paris. Blue, red, and white are the colors of the
French flag.
   On Friday night, a parade, created by advertising maverick
Jean-Paul Goude, presented a whimsical blend of history, folklore
and the outer limits of French fancy. Goude described it as two
hours of controlled madness.
   A million people mobbed the mile-long Champs-Elysees to see the
Florida A &amp; M University marching band dance the California worm, a
Russian ballarina waltz on ice skates with a polar bear, and lancers
fling flowing French tricolors like batons.
   Bronx drummers flanked a full-size locomotive, banging on
55-gallon steel barrels. Chinese students wheeled bicycles, solemnly
jingling their bells, under a banner reading, ``We Will Continue,''
a reference to the crushed pro-democracy movement in their homeland.
   On one gigantic float, a conductor-witchdoctor in a tux gyrated
atop a rolling mountain of pounding African drummers. At the summit,
six undulating Senegalese women, dressed in blue, white and red
gowns, depicted a waving French flag.
   Halfway through, singer Jessye Norman electrified the heart of
Paris with ``La Marseillaise,'' France's national anthem. Her
American nationality, organizers said, highlighted the revolution's
universal character.
   But the crux of a thrilling, infuriating weekend the French will
never forget seemed to be the traditional July 14 morning event,
when France paraded its missiles down the Champs-Elysees.
   Behind glass at the Place de la Concorde, President Francois
Mitterrand was flanked by the leaders of 33 nations from five
continents, including six of the richest and some of the poorest.
   He sat between George Bush, president of a superpower, and Felix
Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast, symbol of an empire France
colonized and, by its measure, civilized.
   Bicentennial celebrations and a coinciding Group of Seven summit
of industrial nations drove home Mitterrand's message that France
sees itself neither as part of the First World nor the Third but
rather of a separate constellation illuminating the way for others.
   But not everyone shared official enthusiasm for the French
Revolution _ or its 1989 commemoration.
   Many Parisians fled town, unwilling to fete a violent civil war
or simply afraid of the crowds. Some who stayed grumbled bitterly at
the massive security blanket.
   ``To an old Parisian, this reminds me of something I have seen
before, but without the swastikas,'' remarked one old Parisian.
   Many saw ironies in the system of privilege that remains 200
years after the revolution.
   Only those with invitations, or the patience to wait six hours
along the route, got a good look at the parade. Television coverage
mostly missed the zany, impressionist mood.
   Thursday night's street dance at the Bastille was billed as the
world's biggest all-night party. In a twist of history, officers
stormed the citizenry to break it up.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had observed on French
television that human rights originated in ancient Greece and were
affirmed in England's Magna Carta of 1215.
   She called the French Revolution a reign of terror that
contributed little to humanity.
   When Mrs. Thatcher appeared among other dignitaries on giant
screens off the Champs-Elysees, crowds booed.
   But mostly, Paris was a raucous party. People wore silly hats,
bought tricolored underwear and gave little serious thought to
history books.
   The Seine flowed thick with champagne corks, beer cans and other
debris of revelry.
   The well-connected had dinner at dawn with Ms. Norman and singer
Grace Jones at Le Palace. Others simply found the nearest music and
did anything from funky chicken to fox-trot.
   Sometimes, the mood turned ugly as young toughs threw
firecrackers at people's feet or dropped gas bombs into crowds as
thick as bearnaise sauce.
   But many Parisians said they had not seen such gaiety, color and
unabashed outpouring of national pride since 1944, when Allied
forces joined French troops in liberating Paris.
   As the weekend wound down, Mitterrand's chauffeur set out on a
personal mission to carry France's message across the world. He is
leading a convoy of Renault vans to Tokyo, via Moscow.
   Three bear the names associated with the French Revolution since
1789: Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood. The fourth is named Hope.

   Parisians here see oil derricks instead of
the Eiffel Tower and favor crape myrtles over crepes, but don't
expect them to call July 14 anything other than Bastille Day.
   When Parisians in France toast the 200th anniversary of their
revolution on Friday, their namesakes here will, too _ Texas-style.
   The fete will include a barbecue, quilting contests, music, plays
and ``Tour de Paris'' bike races expected to draw up to 1,500
entrants to this town of 27,000 people 200 miles northeast of Dallas.
   City leaders and businesses started the Bastille Day celebrations
10 years ago thinking, ``Why not?'' said Linda Suarez, program
coordinator of the Paris Chamber of Commerce.
   ``It started out as a downtown merchants' promotion, a sidewalk
sale, real small and kind of quaint,'' she said. But as word of the
festival grew, ``We just thought we'd take advantage of it.''
   France and Texas have fraternal ties, she said. ``France was one
of the first to recognize Texas as an independent (republic) ... and
the French flag was one of the six that flew over Texas,'' Ms.
Suarez said.
   As part of the celebration, about 20 high school girls will
compete for the title of Crape Myrtle Queen, with the winner
receiving a bouquet from the flowering trees.
   Hungry revelers can feast on pastries from ``Marie A.'s Cake
Company,'' named for Marie Antoinette, the haughty monarch known for
saying ``Let them eat cake.''
   The U.S. Postal Service even has a commemorative cancellation
mark for July 14 letters.
   ``It's got a little Eiffel Tower on one side and an oil derrick
on the other,'' Ms. Suarez said. ``Our logo, on little pins, is a
little Eiffel Tower with a cowboy hat on top. ... They're a real big
hit.''
   The only thing missing will be a French dignitary, she said.
``But, they've got their own birthday party.''

   President Bush, buoyed by his landmark visit to
Eastern Europe, joined dozens of world leaders today for a
spectacular Parisian party celebrating the 200th anniversary of the
French Revolution.
   Bush helped kick off the festivities by helping present to France
the historic key to the Bastille fortress, birthplace of a rebellion
against the French crown two centuries ago. The key, in U.S. hands
since 1790, is on temporary loan.
   On his way to the French capital, Bush voiced hope that his tour
of Poland and Hungary had ``given encouragement to those who want to
go the path of reform, political change, economic change'' in those
communist nations.
   The gala events preceding a summit meeting of the world's seven
largest industrial democracies contrasted sharply with the
president's trip to Poland and Hungary, where he promised to help
both communist nations with major economic reforms.
   Brent Scowcroft, the president's national security adviser, said
Bush would encourage the summit partners to formulate their own aid
programs for Poland and Hungary. He said the idea was to create sort
of a ``clearinghouse'' to avoid duplication of assistance by the
summit countries: the United States, Britain, France, West Germany,
Japan, Canada and Italy.
   Also, Scowcroft said the United States would consider giving food
and other commodities to Poland if austerity measures add to the
hardships of the Soviet bloc country.
   Bush was greeted by French President Francois Mitterrand at the
inaugural bicentennial event at the Place du Trocadero commemorating
the Declaration of the Rights of Man. That statement, issued in
August 1789, set forth the French Revolution's aims of liberty,
fraternity and equality for all people.
   The world leaders sat on a blue and white grandstand listening to
a young man and woman who took turns reading the 17 articles of the
declaration. A children's choir dressed in white sang a ``song of
joy,'' played games and threw peace laurels, flowers and children's
toys on the esplanade.
   At the end of the ceremony, the leaders burst into applause as a
flock of doves flew over the palace. Then, chatting amiably, they
left for a lunch given by Mitterrand, who sat next to Bush during
the ceremony.
   Security was tight with an estimated 30,000 police, including
rooftop marksmen, guarding the summit events. Police also towed away
about 1,000 vehicles as part of their ban on traffic in the main
thoroughfares.
   Before leaving Budapest for the French capital, Bush told
Hungarian leaders that ``as your economy modernizes, you will play
an even greater role in the evolution of a new Europe, a Europe that
is whole and free.''
   Bush told his Hungarian hosts, ``you are proving, here in the
heartland of Europe, that the Rights of Man are the proper
birthright of us all.''
   In an impromptu news conference on Air Force One during the
flight to Paris, Bush said his East European visit ``has been
watched by the people of other Eastern European countries and
hopefully given encouragement to those who want to go the path of
reform, political change, economic change.''
   Bush also dismissed a Moscow spokesman's statement that Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is unable to meet a NATO target date
to reduce conventional military forces. And he said the United
States will not overhaul its Middle East peace policy in response to
political turmoil in Israel.
   He said that in Poland and Hungary, ``the thing that is so
impressive is the determination of all of these leaders to move
towards economic freedom and political freedom.''
   Bush said he had stressed publicly and privately that reforms,
including austerity measures, are essential to building strong
economies.
   ``There is no point going there under false colors and to try to
have everything sweetness and light,'' he said. ``It's a message
that it isn't going to be easy, but that's part of the message.''
   The president said no one expressed disappointment over the
relatively modest aid programs he proposed for Poland and Hungary.
``I think that they understand that we are restricted in what we can
do in terms of dollars ...,'' Bush said.
   In Paris, Mitterrand greeted each leader arriving by limousine at
the ceremony site near the Eiffel Tower. The crowd in the street
cheered when Philippines President Corazon Aquino appeared. Other
guests included Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India, President
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire and
other African leaders, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar, Brazilian President Jose Sarney, Mexican President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari and Uruguayan President Julio Maria Sanguinetti.
   The French festivities features concerts, fireworks and parades.
   After a 40-minute meeting with Mitterrand, Bush took part in
ceremonies marking the return _ actually a brief loan _ of the key
to the Bastille, the site where the French Revolution began when the
fortress was stormed in an uprising against the crown on July 14,
1789.
   Bush planned to present the large iron key to Mitterrand for
display through July 22 at the new Bastille Opera house, adjacent to
the site of the famous fortress.
   The key was given to George Washington nearly 200 years ago by
the Marquis de Lafayette. Since 1797, the key has never left
Washington's estate in northern Virginia.
   Since 1858, the historic artifact has been in the possession of
the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association, the private, non-profit
organization that owns and operates Washington's home.
   When the bicentennial party reaches its peak Friday, the Champs
Elysee will be the site of a parade featuring Britons maching under
artificial rain, Russians dancing with a bear on ice and an American
band strutting backward all the way down the famed avenue.
   Amid extraordinary political uncertainty in Poland and Hungary as
they struggle with democratic reforms, Bush devoted the first half
of his 10-day European journey to encouraging advocates of change.
   Aside from strong messages of moral support, he left behind
packages of U.S. aid of $100 million for Poland and $25 million for
Hungary to spur development of private enterprise.
   ``Your challenge is enormous and historic: to build a structure
of political change and decentralized economic enterprise on the
ruins of a failed Stalinist system,'' Bush said in a speech
Wednesday at the Karl Marx University of Economic Sciences.
   Imre Pozgay, one of Hungary's four communist leaders, told Bush
the changes in his country were ``irreversible'' and added the
government would ``accept the results of free elections'' set for
next year and step down if defeated.
   Bush promised he will press for a coordinated plan of further
assistance for Poland and Hungary at the annual economic summit with
leaders of France, Britain, West Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan.
   The summit meeting begins Friday evening and concludes on Sunday
with the reading of a final communique.
   Aside from aid for Poland and Hungary, major topics are expected
to be environmental problems and Third World debt.

   American marching bands and majorettes strutted
their stuff Saturday in central Paris in a lively U.S. salute to the
200th anniversary of the French Revolution.
   Several thousand people crowded around City Hall and the
surrounding side streets to catch a glimpse of the plumed hats,
fluttering flags and flying batons of the 600 performers.
   The daylong U.S. homage to the bicentennial kicks off a week of
celebrations, culminating Friday on Bastille Day, the 200th
anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison.
   President Bush will be among about 30 world leaders in town for
the parades and fireworks, followed by the annual economic summit of
the world's seven largest industrial democracies.
   The Montana Centennial Band, in white cowboy hats and blue jeans,
led the short parade to cheers from crowds along the avenue.
   The Virginia Military Institute's band, in plumed hats and
gray-and-white uniforms, was next down the Avenue Victoria, followed
by the Marching Panthers of James B. Dudley High School in
Greensboro, N.C., the North Springs (Ga.) High School band and the
Lawrence Central (Ind.) High School band, led by flagbearers waving
the American, French and Indiana colors.
   Marching bands are a rarity in France and are considered
quintessentially American, but the most exotic spectacle came last,
with the 28 members of the Touch of Kyle Twirling Club of Kalamazoo,
Mich., spinning their batons, flags and pink rifles.
   The event's announcer, addressing the crowd over speakers mounted
at City Hall, described baton-twirling as ``this very American art,
which consists of marching in time to the music, spinning and
tossing the little batons while executing all sorts of arabesques.''
   The young Americans are participating in a variety of events
marking the bicentennial around France.
   ``I was really proud of our school that we got chosen,'' said
Andrea Varrone, a clarinet player in the North Springs band. ``We've
been touring and shopping. It's been a lot of fun.''
   The Virginia Military Institute band, from Lexington, Va., played
earlier in the day at the inauguration of a renovated square
honoring the United States.
   It is to lead a civic parade in the city of Vendome, 100 miles
southwest of Paris, commemorating ties between Virginia and France.
The band members plan to tour the Ecole Polytechnique, the historic
French military engineering academy that served as the model for the
Virginia Military Institute, which celebrates its 150th anniversary
this year.

<HEAD>French Bask in Glow Left by Bicentennial Weekend</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The market for bicentennial trinkets is slack and
the streets are clean again, but France and its leaders are still
basking in the glow of their wild bicentennial weekend.
   Until the final moment, the plans to mark the French Revolution's
200th birthday brought waves of criticism.
   The skeptics said Paris would be a nightmare of gridlock, a
whacky parade Friday night would be a disaster and the entire show
constituted an attempt to glorify Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand.
   On Sunday, Mitterrand entoned royally: ``What counts is the
result.''
   Parades and fireworks in the center of Paris attracted the
capital's biggest crowds since the city was liberated from the Nazis.
   ``More than a million Parisians, tens of millions of French
people, and hundreds of millions of television viewers in the entire
world saw on this occasion an image of France particularly rich in
symbols,'' Premier Michel Rocard said in a message to the chief of
the country's Bicentennial Mission, historian Jean-Noel Jeanneney.
   Also watching were more than 30 world leaders, including
President Bush. They came to Paris for the annual summit of the
world's seven richest countries and to attend the bicentennial
festivities.
   Mayor Jacques Chirac and other conservative leaders snubbed the
parades, but even rightist newspapers usually hostile to Mitterrand
saluted the commemorations in rapturous style.
   ``The Triumph of the Revolution,'' the conservative daily Le
Figaro said in a banner headline. In a front-page editorial, it
described Friday night's show as ``colossal, superb and solemn. With
humor as well.''
   The parade along the Champs-Elysees, a flight of imagination
created by advertising specialist Jean-Paul Goude, offered
everything from African drummers to Scottish pipers to the Florida
A&amp;M marching band moonwalking in the style of singer Michael Jackson.
   In a reminder of the price of freedom, hundreds of Chinese
studying in the West marched to solemn music, with headbands showing
the Chinese characters for the French Revolution's watchwords:
``Liberty, Equality, Fraternity''
   By Sunday, as festivities grew old, the crowds on the
Champs-Elysees also thinned and slowed down.
   ``Everybody's worn out,'' said Maguelone Fallot, who wasn't
having much luck selling her bicentennial keepsakes on the famous
avenue.
   ``These things are expensive,'' she said, pointing to her $23 wig
in the blue, white, and red of the French flag and a $15
bicentennial tie.
   The capital's street cleaners, in their bright green suits, were
out early Sunday morning to clean up the confetti and other trash.
   The bicentennial ceremonies began Thursday with dramatic readings
from the Declaration of the Rights of Man with the visiting
presidents and prime ministers in attendance.
   That evening, the leaders joined Mitterrand for an inaugural
concert at the new Opera Bastille, built where a revolutionary mob
stormed the royal Bastille prison on July 14, 1789.
   The attack is viewed as the beginning of the French Revolution.
   Friday morning saw France's traditional military parade, showing
more might than ever this year with screeching fighter planes,
rumbling mobile missiles and ranks of military academy graduates.
   Saturday's fireworks were Chirac's contribution, a 45-minute
display with 170,000 rockets.
   However, the most distinctive part of the weekend binge was
Goude's parade, named ``The Marseillaise'' after France's national
anthem but offered as a salute to the ``tribes of the globe.''
   ``The gamble was without doubt a little crazy, but it was won,''
the daily Le Monde wrote in an editorial Saturday. It said the
``surprising and original'' parade ``did not give the idea _ to say
the least _ of a chauvinistic and xenophobic France.''
   Goude's after-parade commentary was simpler: ``I'll try to do
better next time.''

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who seeks a
new revolution at home, visited the site Tuesday where a mob stormed
the Bastille 200 years ago in the uprising that swept away the
French monarchy.
   He began a three-day visit to France by joining President
Francois Mitterrand for lunch, a first round of talks and a
demonstration of Europe's new high-definition television.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, then went to the Place de la
Bastille, where they shook hands with Parisians and tourists at the
scene of the assault on the infamous prison July 14, 1789.
   Thousands of people crowded up to barricades placed around the
spacious square, many shouting, ``Gorby! Gorby!'' as did crowds on
his visit to West Germany last month.
   Reporters surrounded the Soviet leader at the steps of the new
Opera building, to be inaugurated next week in the presence of
President Bush and other Western leaders as a high point of
celebrations marking the revolution's bicentennial.
   Unable to reach more than a few well-wishers, the Gorbachevs
climbed back into their Soviet-made Zil limousine. On the other side
of the square, however, they climbed out again.
   Dr. Jean-Pierre Mach, a Parisian cancer researcher, said he came
to see Gorbachev ``out of admiration.''
   ``No matter what happens, he will be remembered by history as an
exceptional man, a man who has transformed hate to trust.''
   Gorbachev has described his economic and social reform program _
called perestroika, or restructuring _ as ``a revolution without the
bullets.''
   In a dinner toast Tuesday night, Gorbachev said the Soviets
``feel like full participants in your festivities,'' in part
``because perestroika, also, is a revolution.''
   He said Europe had a chance to move beyond divisions that
resulted from World War II.
   ``The postwar period is over. Today a way toward a stable peace
is opening before us, based not on a balance of forces, but on a
balance of real and correctly understood interests. Europe holds
this chance in its hands.''
   Mitterrand said problems remained to be solved before the Soviet
leader's idea of a ``common European home'' could be made real.
   ``Between the two halves of Europe, there are still many
obstacles to clear away, distrust to dissipate, barriers to knock
down before the inhabitants of the future home can feel at ease and
confident there,'' he said.
   For the French revolutionaries in 1789, the Bastille was both a
hated symbol of oppression and a military garrison where they hoped
to find guns and ammunition for defense against an expected attack
by the troops of King Louis XVI.
   They found only seven prisoners and a small stock of weapons, but
the day went into history as the most memorable of the long and
confused revolution.
   Marxist-Leninist doctrine sees the French revolution as a
landmark in the international class struggle, along with the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution that overthrew the czar.
   Although Gorbachev found a warm welcome at the Bastille, more
than 100 people gathered at the Paris stock exchange to demand that
the Soviet government redeem Russian government bonds issued before
the revlution.
   At the Soviet Embassy, about 2,000 Armenian emigres demanded a
meeting with Gorbachev to discuss the grievances of their countrymen
back home.
   The Gorbachevs descended smiling from their Ilyushin-62 jetliner
at Orly airport, where they were greeted by Mitterrand and his wife,
Danielle.
   In their first discussions, which lasted an hour, the two men
spoke of East-West relations, Gorbachev's reforms and conflicts in
the Middle East, Mitterrand spokesman Hubert Vedrine told a joint
news briefing.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet spokesman, said they might issue
a joint statement appealing for peace in Lebanon and expressing
support for Arab League efforts to end the country's long civil war.
   He said the two countries were discussing an arrangement under
which more natural gas would be sold to France, with the proceeds
used to buy French consumer goods to relieve chronic shortages in
the Soviet Union.
   After lunch, Mitterrand showed Gorbachev the high-definition TV
system intended to compete with U.S. and Japanese versions.
   High-definition TV images are being broadcast as a demonstration
from France's TDF-1 satellite, and Mitterrand is eager to sell the
Soviets on the European system.
   In a separate meeting, foreign ministers Roland Dumas and Eduard
A. Shevardnadze signed agreements to fight drugs, ease access to
public archives, prevent incidents at sea and promote youth exchange
programs.

<TEXT>
   Just like Paris, this hamlet
deep in wine-growing Burgundy went out of its way to make its
bicentennial celebration an unparalleled event.
   Unlike Parisians, however, the 548 villagers could get a close
look at the fireworks display, the first ever in the history of St.
Gengoux. They also had no trouble parking and didn't complain about
the cost of it all.
   That doesn't mean the festivities were a cinch for mayor Joseph
Pelletier.
   ``We had worries to organize this,'' he said. ``For the official
toast, we had to get our hands on 200 glasses and think who would do
the washing up afterward.''
   With all eyes glued on Paris where world leaders marked the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution in pomp, splendor and grandeur,
hundreds of villages around France celebrated with a simple ``bal
populaire,'' and heaps of food and wine.
   On the eve of Bastille Day, the children of St. Gengoux marched
around the village carrying colorful lanterns. The elders, dressed
in period costumes, followed and chanted revolutionary slogans such
as ``That's enough. We'll hang the aristocracy!'' and ``Down with
the nobility and clergy!'' when they passed the 11th century church.
   But times have changed.
   St. Gengoux no longer has a resident priest, the sole policeman
did not have to protect anyone from the outrage of the people, and
by 3:30 a.m. the locals were swaying to ``Rock Around the Clock'' by
Bill Haley and the Comets.
   One thing was missing, though. For the first time in memory, the
brass band, rich in trophies and local history, did not lead the
procession.
   After the previous mayor lost the March elections, his son and
cousin quit the band, taking with them their bugle and big drum.
   ``What a pity we had to miss that,'' said Pelletier, echoing the
complaints of many villagers.
   But it hardly dampened the enthusiasm during the simple
festivities. ``Here, everything is very down to earth,'' said baker
Jeannot Breton. ``We celebrate among ourselves. We don't have an
orgy of money,'' he said.
   The mayor runs the July 14 celebrations on a budget of less than
$1,500. ``Of course, we don't have to receive heads of state,'' he
said.
   St. Gengoux, basking amid the lush, sloping hills of eastern
France, produces simple Macon white wines from Chardonnay grapes,
but without the fame or prices of the Burgundy wines from around
Beaune, 40 miles to the north.
   Friday's celebrations ended with the bicentennial ``Repas
Populaire,'' a rich five-course meal for about $7.50 a plate, but
with wine and coffee offered by the village. More than 200 people
showed up in the Salle des Fetes, decorated in the French colors for
the occasion.
   During the two days, only one big speech was made, but even then
it hardly resembled the heady rhetoric heard in Paris, where the
Revolution was lauded as one of France's greatest contributions to
humanity.
   The people here have their ideas what 1789 means. In St. Gengoux,
there were attacks during the revolutionary summer to destroy
everything that represented the nobility and clergy but no major
massacres occured.
   ``Like everywhere, July 14 means liberty. We have maintained it
and even abused it a lot,'' Breton said, referring to France's
colonial past. ``When something is forbidden, we are the first to do
it,'' he said.
   The quest for an egalitarian society however has partly failed,
said Pelletier. ``The differences are still there, but they are not
so big as 200 years ago,'' he said. ``Some privileges have
survived,'' he said.
   St. Gengoux will continue to celebrate until the end of July to
commemorate events in the region itself.
   ``On July 14, nothing happened here,'' said Pelletier. ``There
was no television to see live how the Bastille was taken.''

   The capital launched its celebration of the
bicentennial of the French Revolution on Tuesday night with
fireworks, trumpets and balloons at the Place de la Concorde, where
King Louis XVI lost his head to the guillotine.
   For the occasion, the large statues of eight women representing
eight major provincial cities placed around the huge square were
unveiled. The statues were restored over the past year to repair
effects of pollution made worse by the daily packs of automobiles
that jam the Place de la Concorde.
   As the horns sounded and floodlights blazed, a brief cascade of
fireworks lighted the sky over central Paris.
   The date chosen to kick off the city's bicentennial celebrations
Paris marked the 200th anniversary of Louis XVI's decision to summon
the Estates General, representatives of the three estates ``nobles,
clergy and commoners'' whose meeting in Versailles set the
revolution in motion.
   The king himself was beheaded Jan. 21, 1793, in the 21-acre
square on the Right Bank of the Seine between the Tuileries Gardens
and the Champs Elysees. It was first called Place Louis XV, renamed
Place de la Revolution in 1792, then Place Louis XV when the
monarchy was restored. It finally was given its current name in 1830
in homage to national reconciliation.
   The eight statues around the Place de la Concorde, installed
between 1836 and 1840, represent the cities of Nantes, Brest, Rouen,
Bordeaux, Marseille, Lille, Lyon and Strasbourg.
   Celebrations of the bicentennial year elsewhere in France started
as early as Jan. 1, with the launching of colorful hot-air balloons
from various sites.
   The celebrations are to culminate July 14, the national holiday
and the anniversary of the storming of the Bastille prison. Other
projects include concerts, festivals, expositions and, on the first
day of spring, planting of Trees of Liberty around the country.

RESTAURANTS IN FRANCE AS OLD AS THE REVOLUTION

<P>
It's a Frenchman's pleasure to dine out. And, in a sense, his patriotic duty. 
</P>
<P>
The great revolution over which countless aristocrats lost their heads put 
ideas into others, notably the brigades of private maitres d'hotel and chefs 
facing sudden unemployment. In an era when it was dangerous to be less 
revolutionary than one's neighbor, the cleverest among this new class of 
unemployed disavowed their aristocratic ties and looked to put their talents to 
work in patriotic ways. 
</P>
<P>
Though cafes, which served the various revolutionary camps, are an older 
Parisian tradition, restaurants, as we know them, are truly a revolutionary 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
Inspired, it seems, by a man named Boulanger who in 1765 opened Paris' first a 
la carte restaurant on the Rue des Poulies, several restaurants opened (and 
closed) during the years of upheaval. Some survivors are still operating, 
remarkably unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
Eat in any number of cafes or restaurants in the center of Paris today and 
you're likely to be served some history with your napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the tale of the two Tour d'Argents. 
</P>
<P>
Latter-day gourmets are familiar with the Tour d'Argent, arguably France's most 
famous restaurant, tracing its roots to an inn founded in the shadow of Notre 
Dame in 1582. Following the trend, it adapted a carte, or menu, around 1780, 
executed by a kitchen brigade of the type formerly reserved for aristocratic 
homes. Serving kings and courtesans, it introduced the idea that one need not 
own a country manor to become a gourmet. Viewed as undemocratic, it was 
pillaged by patriots and auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
As current owner Claude Terrail phrases it, "the ball closed" for a time. It 
was eventually reopened by Napoleon's chef, and has since served kings and 
commoners thousands of its famous numbered ducks. It has retained three stars 
from Michelin longer than any other Parisian restaurant and, according to many, 
still merits them. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to its penthouse dining room (moved upstairs decades ago) provides a 
magnificent bird's-eye perspective of Notre Dame, an experience that nearly 
justifies the lofty prices. Current chef Manuel Martinez combines contemporary 
and classic, under Terrail's ever-vigilant eye. A fixed-price lunch menu hovers 
around $50, while dinners climb closer to $100 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour d'Argent, 15 Quai de la Tournelle, 75005. Telephone 43.54.23.31. Closed 
Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The other Tour d'Argent sits at the Place de la Bastille. National Archive 
documents establish its opening in 1640. Named for Henri VI's treasury tower in 
the original Bastille prison, this Tour d'Argent played an active role in the 
conflicts of 1789. Owned by Gilbert Gaillard, captain of the people's army, it 
was a principal gathering site surrounded by barricades and later served as a 
hospital. Reopened recently after a two-year renovation by third-generation 
owner Jean Francois Solignac, it remains a more common ground than the other 
Tour d'Argent, with which it is still waging a battle, this time in court, over 
the use of its name. 
</P>
<P>
Its terrace overlooks the curving glass front of the newly unveiled Opera 
Bastille. The brasserie-style menu features simple grilled items and shellfish 
platters at prices and hours (until 1:30 p.m.) to make republicans smile. 
Dinner for one person is $40 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour d'Argent Bastille, 6 Place de La Bastille, 75012. Telephone 43.42.90.32. 
Open daily. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
While patriots stormed the Bastille by day, evenings in the Palais Royal 
steamed with more carnal passions. 
</P>
<P>
An arcaded square built in the 17th Century for Cardinal Richelieu, the gardens 
by the 1760s drew Paris' demimonde to cafes, gambling houses and brothels. The 
most sparkling survivor of the era is Grand Vefour, which traces its history to 
Antoine Aubertot's Cafe de Chartres, a fashionable see-and-be scene of the era, 
established in 1780. Now classified a national monument, the restaurant takes 
its name from Jean Vefour, who bought it during the Restoration. 
</P>
<P>
Its magnificent decor, Louis XVI-garlanded ceiling and elaborate wall frescoes 
often backdropped Napoleon and Josephine as diners. Owned today by the 
Tattinger (Champagne) group with Jean-Claude Lhonneur at the stove this season, 
its menu is classic, meriting two Michelin stars. Prices are far from 
democratic (around $100 per person), but there's an excellent fixed-price lunch 
menu at $45. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Vefour, 17 rue de Beaujolais, Paris 75001. Telephone 42.96.56.27. Closed 
Saturday lunch and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Far from the Bastille and Palais Royal was a seamy little inn called the 
Auberge du Dauphin. Set on a dirt road leading west out of Paris, it became a 
carriage stop on the journey from the Tuileries to the Bois de Boulogne. If the 
Auberge lacked refinement, the location held great potential, and Michel Doyen 
rented it for 1,200 a year in 1791. The miserable road became the Champs 
Elysees; the Inn, the elegant Ledoyen. Surviving the centuries, its own 
fortunes rising and falling with subsequent republics, Ledoyen rose phoenixlike 
last fall when its lease was taken by Regine, Paris' nightclub queen. 
Extensively remodeled, its kitchens have been taken in hand by three-star chef 
Jacques Maximin (formerly of Hotel Negresco, Nice). 
</P>
<P>
Currently, the place is savoring its reputation as one of Paris' most expensive 
and controversial restaurants, while flaunting its revival across the avenue at 
another restaurant, Laurent, which traces its beginning to the same period. 
Consultant Maxim recently passed the relay baton, so to speak, to chef Philippe 
Dorange, but a Provencal flavor remains. Dinner in the subdued salon of Le 
Guepard can easily pass the $100 per person level, inspiring loyalty among 
some, derision among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Ledoyen, Carre des Champs-Elysees, 75008 Paris. Telephone 47.42.23.23. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Down a Palais Royal passageway on the Rue du Beaujolais existed another 
restaurant directly linked to the revolution. Antoine Beauvilliers, the Count 
of Provence's officer de bouche (chef), unemployed after his employer's 
emigration, decided to open a restaurant in 1790. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant, offering 168 menu choices, was an immediate success. While 
other restaurants rose little above simple tavern status, Beauvilliers added 
touches to warm the hearts of contemporary designers -- a dining room of 
tasseled silk, liveried waiters, a well-stocked wine cellar and refined 
cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Arrested during the Terror, Beauvilliers survived, and for 15 years was Paris' 
most touted and trend-setting restaurateur. As Briffault wrote in 1846, 
"Quickly raising the reputation of restaurateurs, he did for our cuisine what 
the 17th and 18th centuries did for our literature." 
</P>
<P>
Though Beauvilliers no longer exists on its original site, those in search of 
the restaurant's spirit will do well to take a little license (and considerable 
cash) and climb up to Montmartre, where a restaurant conceived in his honor 
numbers among Paris' most celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauvilliers, 52, rue Lamarck, Paris 75018. Telephone 42.54.54.42. Closed 
Sunday and Monday lunch. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When the revolution broke out, partisans chose their camps or, more likely, 
their cafes. Royalists gathered at the Cafe Valois, while citizens frequented 
the Cafe des Aveugles. From the Cafe de Foy, Camille Desmoulins incited the 
crowds on the 13th of July, 1789, and Danton could frequently be found at the 
Cafe Parnasse, partly because the owner was his father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
While these have disappeared, there are others which carry on in much the same 
revolutionary spirit. 
</P>
<P>
Billing itself as the world's oldest cafe, and founded in 1686, Le Procope 
quickly became the fief of politicos and journalists. Playwrights and 
performers from the nearby Comedie Francaise were habitues, and by the turn of 
the century Procope was one of the most celebrated of Paris' cafes. During the 
revolution, it was the meeting place of Marat, Danton and Robespierre. It's 
from there that the order to invade the Tuileries came. 
</P>
<P>
Surviving as an undistinguished bistro since then, it underwent radical change 
recently when purchased by an ambitious Parisian restaurant group. Salons 
refurbished in 18th-Century bourgeois style now set the stage for waiters in 
Napoleonic waistcoats and a menu of "reign of terror" selections: Dr. Guillotin 
fish soup. 
</P>
<P>
The best formula here, perhaps: Have a cup of coffee, read the newspapers and 
contemplate the Rights of Man. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Procope, 13 rue de 1'Ancienne -- Comedie, 75006. Telephone 43.26.99.20.

   The countdown has begun at the Opera Bastille.
   Some 1,500 hard hats are working double shifts putting finishing
touches on the gleaming glass and steel structure scheduled to open
July 13 as the French mark the bicentennial of their revolution.
   French opera buffs hope the high-tech musical complex _ built on
the square where revolutionaries stormed the Bastille prison on July
14, 1789 _ will finally put Paris on the international music map.
For the moment, doubts remain.
   The new Opera had been leaderless since last January when Israeli
conductor Daniel Barenboim was fired because of what President
Francois Mitterrand's representative said were his high fees and
``elitist views'' on opera.
   Pierre Berge, the head of the Yves Saint Laurent fashion empire
and the man Mitterrand appointed to manage the project in its final
days, said Barenboim's replacement would be someone who understood
the president's wish to create a ``modern and popular opera''
accessible to the masses.
   Five months of speculation and uncertainty ended last month when
that someone turned out to be Myung-Whung Chung, a 36-year-old
Korean conductor known for his skills as a pianist. Soft-spoken and
unemotional, the new music director said he would be a team player
eager to work ``in harmony and unison'' with Opera Bastille
administrators.
   Warning he would not get entangled in the political infighting
that has beset the project from the start, he said, ``If there is a
fight, and I'll say it publicly right now, I won't fight. I'll just
leave.''
   Although Berge declined to divulge Chung's salary, he said his
five-year contract requires the maestro be in Paris for 27 weeks a
year for a minimum of 30 performances,
   Chung also let it be known he has his own ideas on ``popular
opera.''
   ``Popular means the house is full and people are dying to get
in,'' he said in an interview. ``I'd like to broaden the opera-going
public and see more young people and students in the audience.''
   Meanwhile, workers are busy getting ready for the inaugural
concert, billed originally as the centerpiece of official
bicentennial celebrations to be performed before Mitterrand,
President George Bush and other luminaries.
   French conductor Georges Pretre will conduct the Paris Opera
Ballet Orchestra and Chorus, with a host of international
celebrities performing selected arias from well-known French operas.
The concert will be staged by American director Bob Wilson, the
longtime darling of the French avant-garde.
   The Opera-Bastille's first bona fide operatic production is
scheduled for next February. Although Chung did not reveal the
program, the real star of the show is sure to be the building itself.
   The new Opera is a hulking mass of polished granite, glass and
stainless steel designed by Canadian architect Carlos Ott. Critics
compare it to an ocean liner in dry dock, looming over the Place de
la Bastille in eastern Paris. The prison was torn down during the
revolution.
   A technical wonder, the Opera Bastille is everything the ornate,
century-old Paris Opera is not. The Palais Garnier may be a landmark
known worldwide for its baroque design and Chagall-decorated
ceiling, but it has been inadequate for decades.
   The old Opera has a scant 1,600 seats with unobstructed views and
virtually no backstage, which meant that sets had to be built
elsewhere, dismantled, brought in and reconstructed. The cost was
staggering, and so were ticket prices.
   Tickets to the new Opera Bastille are expected to cost a maximun
of 250 francs (about $40), less than half their cost at the Palais
Garnier, which from now on will be devoted to ballet.
   The Opera Bastille has 12 stages in all, including a main stage
flagged by five stages and an adjoining rehearsal stage identical to
the main stage, plus five identical stages one level below.
   All are fitted with freight elevators, electronically controlled
and motorized wagons on conveyor tracks so that sets for an entire
opera can be moved from rehearsal stages to the main stage within 10
minutes.
   Michael Dittmann, the scenic director who drew up the technical
specifications, calls the Opera Bastille ``practical, not
sophisticated.''
   ``Sophisticated means complicated, and this building isn't
complicated,'' he said during a tour of the building. ``It's very
simple. It's a place where you have a lot of space. Here we don't
have the daily problem of where to put our decor in between
performances.''
   The main stage offers 4,300 square feet of space and is 66 feet
high. It is equipped with 9 elevators, 72 traps and a movable
orchestra pit that can be open or closed in two to three minutes.
   A bridge over the main and backstages allows stage hands to load
the ceiling with carpets, curtains and other decor without
monopolizing the stage. The ceiling is also designed for storage,
thus economizing two hours a day when productions alternate.
   There is ample space for costumes, workshops and storage areas,
connected directly to the main stage. The Opera Bastille is a
musician's dream with rehearsal rooms galore _ three for the
orchestra, two for ballet, two for the chorus, 16 studios for
singers and 12 for musicians.
   While backstage areas are still dusty construction sites, the
main hall itself is nearly ready. On a recent visit, workmen were
busy polishing granite pillars, washing windows, waxing hardwood
floors and installing cushions.
   Despite a glass ceiling and a cold color scheme in white, black
and gray, the atmosphere is pleasant and intimate, aided, in part,
to wooden walls and two tiers of graceful balconies reminiscent of
Japanese pagodas.
   Dittmann says the hall's computer-analyzed acoustics are
excellent. Even the hall's chairs have been designed with acoustics
in mind: There are small holes which allow the sound to pass through
when they are empty.
   A polystyrene joint under the building absorbs vibrations from
the three metro lines that intersect under the Place de la Bastille.
   ``If that isn't enough, the subway cars themselves will be fitted
with special rubber tires,'' he said.

<HEAD>Opera Bastille: High Tech Musical Complex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The countdown has begun at the Opera Bastille.
   Some 1,500 hard hats are working double shifts putting finishing
touches on the gleaming glass and steel structure scheduled to open
July 13 as the French mark the bicentennial of their revolution.
   French opera buffs hope the high-tech musical complex _ built on
the square where revolutionaries stormed the Bastille prison on July
14, 1789 _ will finally put Paris on the international music map.
For the moment, doubts remain.
   The new Opera had been leaderless since last January when Israeli
conductor Daniel Barenboim was fired because of what President
Francois Mitterrand's representative said were his high fees and
``elitist views'' on opera.
   Pierre Berge, the head of the Yves Saint Laurent fashion empire
and the man Mitterrand appointed to manage the project in its final
days, said Barenboim's replacement would be someone who understood
the president's wish to create a ``modern and popular opera''
accessible to the masses.
   Five months of speculation and uncertainty ended last month when
that someone turned out to be Myung-Whung Chung, a 36-year-old
Korean conductor known for his skills as a pianist. Soft-spoken and
unemotional, the new music director said he would be a team player
eager to work ``in harmony and unison'' with Opera Bastille
administrators.
   Warning he would not get entangled in the political infighting
that has beset the project from the start, he said, ``If there is a
fight, and I'll say it publicly right now, I won't fight. I'll just
leave.''
   Although Berge declined to divulge Chung's salary, he said his
five-year contract requires the maestro be in Paris for 27 weeks a
year for a minimum of 30 performances,
   Chung also let it be known he has his own ideas on ``popular
opera.''
   ``Popular means the house is full and people are dying to get
in,'' he said in an interview. ``I'd like to broaden the opera-going
public and see more young people and students in the audience.''
   Meanwhile, workers are busy getting ready for the inaugural
concert, billed originally as the centerpiece of official
bicentennial celebrations to be performed before Mitterrand,
President George Bush and other luminaries.
   French conductor Georges Pretre will conduct the Paris Opera
Ballet Orchestra and Chorus, with a host of international
celebrities performing selected arias from well-known French operas.
The concert will be staged by American director Bob Wilson, the
longtime darling of the French avant-garde.
   The Opera-Bastille's first bona fide operatic production is
scheduled for next February. Although Chung did not reveal the
program, the real star of the show is sure to be the building itself.
   The new Opera is a hulking mass of polished granite, glass and
stainless steel designed by Canadian architect Carlos Ott. Critics
compare it to an ocean liner in dry dock, looming over the Place de
la Bastille in eastern Paris. The prison was torn down during the
revolution.
   A technical wonder, the Opera Bastille is everything the ornate,
century-old Paris Opera is not. The Palais Garnier may be a landmark
known worldwide for its baroque design and Chagall-decorated
ceiling, but it has been inadequate for decades.
   The old Opera has a scant 1,600 seats with unobstructed views and
virtually no backstage, which meant that sets had to be built
elsewhere, dismantled, brought in and reconstructed. The cost was
staggering, and so were ticket prices.
   Tickets to the new Opera Bastille are expected to cost a maximun
of 250 francs (about $40), less than half their cost at the Palais
Garnier, which from now on will be devoted to ballet.
   The Opera Bastille has 12 stages in all, including a main stage
flagged by five stages and an adjoining rehearsal stage identical to
the main stage, plus five identical stages one level below.
   All are fitted with freight elevators, electronically controlled
and motorized wagons on conveyor tracks so that sets for an entire
opera can be moved from rehearsal stages to the main stage within 10
minutes.
   Michael Dittmann, the scenic director who drew up the technical
specifications, calls the Opera Bastille ``practical, not
sophisticated.''
   ``Sophisticated means complicated, and this building isn't
complicated,'' he said during a tour of the building. ``It's very
simple. It's a place where you have a lot of space. Here we don't
have the daily problem of where to put our decor in between
performances.''
   The main stage offers 4,300 square feet of space and is 66 feet
high. It is equipped with 9 elevators, 72 traps and a movable
orchestra pit that can be open or closed in two to three minutes.
   A bridge over the main and backstages allows stage hands to load
the ceiling with carpets, curtains and other decor without
monopolizing the stage. The ceiling is also designed for storage,
thus economizing two hours a day when productions alternate.
   There is ample space for costumes, workshops and storage areas,
connected directly to the main stage. The Opera Bastille is a
musician's dream with rehearsal rooms galore _ three for the
orchestra, two for ballet, two for the chorus, 16 studios for
singers and 12 for musicians.
   While backstage areas are still dusty construction sites, the
main hall itself is nearly ready. On a recent visit, workmen were
busy polishing granite pillars, washing windows, waxing hardwood
floors and installing cushions.
   Despite a glass ceiling and a cold color scheme in white, black
and gray, the atmosphere is pleasant and intimate, aided, in part,
to wooden walls and two tiers of graceful balconies reminiscent of
Japanese pagodas.
   Dittmann says the hall's computer-analyzed acoustics are
excellent. Even the hall's chairs have been designed with acoustics
in mind: There are small holes which allow the sound to pass through
when they are empty.
   A polystyrene joint under the building absorbs vibrations from
the three metro lines that intersect under the Place de la Bastille.
   ``If that isn't enough, the subway cars themselves will be fitted
with special rubber tires,'' he said.

   After the scandal attending the firing of Israeli conductor
Daniel Barenboim by couturier Pierre Berge of the house of Yves St.
Laurent, whom Mitterrand chose to run the opera, and the subsequent
resignation of composer Pierre Boulez as artistic director, Korean
Myung-Whun Chung was chosen to conduct an orchestra that still has
44 vacant chairs, including key soloists.
   A current joke in Paris asks, ``What is the difference between
the Bastille Opera and the Titanic?''
   ``The Titanic had an orchestra.''
   The best of times already seem at hand for I.M. Pei's glass
pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre, another project dear to the
heart of the Socialist president, which at first was scoffed at by
art critics and deplored by the citizens. Now thousands wait on line
to descend escalators into the new museum entrance, admiring the way
the diamond-shaped panes reflect the splashing fountains and ever
changing clouds over the Seine against the somber stones of the
Renaissance-style palace.
   The French take their time appraising objets d'art.
Twelfth-century intellectuals deemed excessive the flying buttresses
that support Notre Dame cathedral. Bridge builder Gustave Eiffel's
towering salute to the centennial of the revolution was denounced as
``useless and monstrous'' and ``arrogant ironmongery'' by the likes
of Guy de Maupassant and Alexandre Dumas Fils.
   Laser-lighted and repainted a rich chocolate brown for its l00th
birthday, the 1,064-foot-high lacy iron tower astride four graceful
Gothic arches is still the glory of the Paris skyline and outdraws
all other local tourist attractions.
   The revolution exported to France by Benjamin Franklin, Thomas
Jefferson and the Marquis de Lafayette is being celebrated with many
refrains from the American bicentennial: fireworks, rock concerts,
street dances, a passage of tall ships from Rouen to Le Havre, a
parade of 5l bands featuring 760 trombones, and a full-sized replica
of the Statue of Liberty flame placed at the beginning of Avenue de
New York by the International Herald Tribune.
   On July l4, when all subways and buses are free, American soprano
Jessye Norman will star in ``Homage a La Marseillaise,'' a show
business extravaganza at Place de la Concorde, where the guillotine
stood.
   Norman will sing the national anthem, written three years after
the Bastille fell. The ``Marseillaise'' was composed by Rouget de
Lisle, a 32-year-old army officer who happened to be in Strasbourg
at the time, spent most of the Terror in prison and later wrote a
less-known anthem honoring the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy.
He got an angry letter from his mother when thugs and ex-convicts
from Marseilles marched on Paris singing his song to carry out the
September l792 massacre of 5,000 political prisoners, many of them
priests and children.
   A recent poll in Le Monde showed that most French know only a
little about the major events of their revolution. Numerous magazine
articles and TV commentators make the point that the citizens are
less enthusiastic about the bicentennial than the Americans were
about theirs in 1976.
   The revolution that began as a neighborhood disturbance in the
Faubourg St. Antoine by the sans-culottes, artisans and shopkeepers
who did not wear the fancy knee breeches of the aristocracy, led to
the Declaration of Rights of Man and the Citizen and the eventual
overthrow of the monarchy. But Napoleon with his whiff of grape shot
was waiting in the wings, not an egalitarian representative
government.
   Since the revolution, France has been governed by five republics,
interspersed with two emperors, three kings and a Fascist marshal.
The goal of Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite is still on the agenda of
most political parties.
   ``What is there to celebrate?'' asks Bernard Laplaud of
Villeneuve Les Avignon. ``It was a time of shame. The revolution
brought the Terror and then Napoleon, who made France a lot of
enemies.''
   Laplaud, a heating contractor, was installing a new furnace in
the penitentiary at Marseilles when France last executed a criminal,
a pimp convicted of murder. He recalls that the sentence was
``delayed for several hours because the ancient truck delivering the
guillotine from Paris broke down along the way.''
   Bicentennial celebrants nostalgic for the last time they saw
Paris will have difficulty finding comfort at any of the surviving
vespasiennes, the street urinals named for the Roman emperor who was
the first to provide public toilets. These endangered species are
rapidly being replaced by chiraquiennes, mod, cylindrical pay
toilets nicknamed for Jacques Chirac, the conservative mayor of
Paris who is a proponent of pay-as-you-go economics.

   Tourists coming for the bicentennial of the French
Revolution next month may find out that they picked the worst of
times.
   They will have to stay in a hotel far from the capital. A parking
space in Paris might be just as tough to get.
   Motorcades for the 30 or so presidents and prime ministers will
whiz through streets, and authorities will deploy 30,000 police _
two-thirds from out of town _ during the July 11-17 peak of
festivities.
   Tourists flock to Paris every summer, but officials say the
number of visitors already is considerably larger than last year.
During the bicentennial period, about 3 million tourists are
expected to flood this city of 2.3 million people.
   With a bit of luck, a tourist can still find a room this month.
Next month _ forget it.
   ``Impossible,'' says a woman at the hotel reservations counter of
the Tourist Office on the Champs-Elysees. ``You'll have to go at
least 100 kilometers (60 miles) outside of Paris. Paris is booked
solid.''
   Many VIPs will be attending a July 14-16 summit of the seven
major industrial nations, and their entourages will fill hundreds of
hotel rooms.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev is coming to town July 4-6, followed by
Corazon Aquino of the Philippines. Also attending celebrations are
10 African presidents, six North and South American presidents, six
Asian presidents, and six prime ministers or presidents from Western
Europe, with baggage. Among those attending is President Bush.
   The elaborate preparations for the foreign leaders have left many
people grumbling.
   ``Allowing a few dozen privileged people to be lodged and to move
about tranquilly must not in any way be done to the detriment of
hundreds of thousands of other people,'' elected officials from the
Greens Party wrote to President Francois Mitterrand.
   Police have put together a security and traffic strategy worthy
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   For the crucial week of July 10-17, parts of central Paris will
be off- limits to all motor vehicle traffic and no cars allowed to
park on the streets. All vehicles must be removed from those areas.
Permits must be sought for delivery trucks and residents heading for
garages. Taxis may carry passengers into the areas.
   Special parking lots are being set up in the Bois de Vincennes
and Bois de Boulogne, forests on the east and west extremities of
Paris. That could seriously upset the thriving transvestite
prostitution business in the woods.
   Officials have played down the inconvenience.
   ``At least once in our lifetime, we will have seen the heart of
Paris without cars, without trucks, without exhaust fumes, without
backfiring motors,'' said Premier Michel Rocard.
   The Louvre will be shut down July 13-15 for security reasons
while delegations gather at the art museum for sessions.
   And the ``bateaux mouches,'' the tourist boats that ply the
Seine, will drop anchor those three days because they will not be
allowed to use their Alma bridge terminal.
   July 14 is Bastille Day, the 200th anniversary of the storming of
Bastille Prison that started the revolution.
   The Tourist Office said about 100 families have responded so far
to calls for private citizens to rent rooms to visitors.
   ``And we certainly will have more,'' says Florence Quercia,
director of the Champs-Elysees office. ``If you have any problems,
come and see us.''

Irvine Hilton and Towers and tune up for the weekend with "TGIF and All that 
Jazz-Dixie Style" parties every Friday from 4:30 to 8:30 on the hotel's

   Many haute couture shops in chic districts closed
their doors in dismay at picnicking tourist crowds celebrating the
bicentennial, but restaurants, cafes and bakery shops did a brisk
business.
   Party-goers, their mouths stuffed with pastry, seemed to make a
mockery of the disdainful Revolutionary era remark about letting the
hungry mob eat cake.
   But by the wee hours of the morning Saturday, when one famished
reporter was looking for nourishment, there was nothing to be found.
   ``Ah, Madame, we don't have a crumb of bread left to eat,'' was
the reply at one establishment.
   The French Revolution seemed to have come full circle.

   President Francois Mitterrand has been accused of favoring pomp
over the people for his lavish three-day bicentennial blast. But he
cannot be accused of nepotism.
   As the chief of state presided over the grand and mighty military
parade marking Bastille Day, his brother, retired Gen. Jacques
Mitterrand, slipped discreetly into a vacant seat in a press stand,
first wiping the dusty chair clean with a piece of paper.
   Asked his thoughts about his brother's alleged notions of
grandeur, the general begged off. ``A big subject,'' he said in
English, then added: ``I'm just a member of the public.''

   The most constant complaint during the bicentennial celebrations
has come from citizens on wheels prohibited for security reasons
from driving, or even parking, their cars in much of central Paris.
   ``The French Revolution was for the abolition of privileges,''
grumbled one taxi driver angered by the inconvenience caused by more
than two dozen visiting foreign leaders.
   ``These heads of state are nice guys and I have nothing against
them,'' he said. ``But I have the right to make a living.''
   In typical Gallic fashion, the taxi driver, eager to vent his
emotions, expounded freely on his revolutionary heritage. But also
typical, he feared identifying himself by name, saying he could lose
his job if his complaints were made known.
   Reminded that liberty and the rights of man were at the essence
of the Revolution, he gave a knowing wink. ``True. But, some people
in this country have more rights than others,'' he said.

   Eight tow trucks, all honking their horns in a victory salute,
tooled down the Boulevard Montparnasse the other night, dragging
illegally parked cars like captured prey.
   French police have been unforgiving about keeping the sealed-off
city center car-free to accomodate bicentennial festivities.
   The cars are taken to lots in the Bois de Boulogne in western
Paris and the Bois de Vincennes in the east. About 1,000 were towed
in the first 24 hours of the clearing operation. The only charge to
the car owner is the price of a taxi ride out.

   Reporters covering the summit of the leaders of the major
industrial democracies have been treated to a tantalizing array of
French food: mousses, pates, duck, roast beef, salads and tarts for
dessert. The dishes are painstakingly prepared and presented on
starched tablecloths. Fresh flowers abound.
   One day, amid the lavish culinary outlay, stood five bottles of
ketchup _ apparently an attempt by the French to appeal to all their
guests' tastes.

   Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno and President Hossain
Mohammed Ershad of Bangladesh exchanged original gifts at a
bilateral meeting in Paris this week. They gave each other books of
their own poetry.
   The 66-year-old Japanese leader, who hails from a sake-brewing
family, writes haiku in his spare time. He has published three books
of his poetry, one of which he gave to Ershad, according to Japanese
officials.
   A sample of his work was published in an official biography
handed out to foreign press at the summit. Written in May as Uno
flew across Siberia, it recalls his imprisonment in World War II in
the Soviet Union:
   ``On that prisoner's path
   ``Where I pulled a wooden sled
   ``Now the leaves of spring.''
   Ershad gave Uno a book called ``Selected Poems,'' one of four
books of poetry he has published.

<HEAD>French Children Relive Storming of Bastille</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of schoolchildren screaming for the head of
King Louis XVI stormed a mock-up of the Bastille prison on Wednesday
in a re-enactment of one of the French Revolution's most dramatic
moments.
   Dressed in period costume, about 500 children from the northern
Paris suburb of St. Denis gathered at the Place de la Bastille to
relive the event that would inflame revolutionary passions
throughout the land 200 years ago.
   Giant puppets on stilts representing the king, Queen
Marie-Antoinette and revolutionary leaders Danton and Robespierre
acted out their roles while the children played the impassioned mob.
   Blue, red and white balloons sailed into the sky and confetti and
streamers flew as the children called for a march to the Bastille,
recreated in white, red and blue styrofoam blocks.
   When the signal was given, they tore the blocks down and jumped
into the fray.
   While many children were content to watch the spectacle, others
said they knew exactly why they were there.
   ``Storming the Bastille was important because that's how the
peasants got arms,'' explained 9-year-old Christophe. ``The peasants
were ready to revolt because they were starving, they had to pay
taxes the aristocrats didn't.''
   The children, aged 6-12, spent months preparing for the event,
which was sponsored by the public schools and recreation centers of
St. Denis, a working-class suburb. Some learned revolutionary songs
and dances. Others concentrated on understanding why the revolution
took place.
   ``With young children, all you do is to explain basic ideas like
the abolition of privilege and slavery,'' said Danielle Monteils, a
first-grade teacher. Her pupils came in revolutionary costumes that
Mrs. Monteils and her mother made during the winter vacation.
   Organizers said the re-enactment was important because it allowed
some of the children to see Paris for the first time.
   ``They live in low-income high rises and have never seen old
buildings like the ones in this neighborhood,'' said Joelle Porro,
the head of St. Denis' 32 recreation centers. ``Many of them come
from disadvantaged families and have few educational opportunites.''
   The event was one of hundreds being held throughout France this
year to mark the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.

   More than 1,200 people needed treatment for
injuries and other medical problems after taking to the streets for
a sound-and-light extravaganza capping Bastille Day, the Red Cross
said Sunday.
   About 2 million participants packed the banks of the Seine River
and avenues leading to the financial-district suburb of La Defense
to watch the mammoth concent by Jean-Michel Jarre on Saturday night.
   The Red Cross said Sunday that 22 of the revelers were
hospitalized for injuries. It gave no details of their injuries.
   Another 1,200 spectators sought relief at first-aid stations,
the agency said in a communique. It said most of those seeking
first aid were in need of water, sugar or rest.
   The show capped daylong festivities featuring a military parade
and a pledge by President Francois Mitterrand to keep French
nuclear and conventional forces independent and strong.
   The holiday celebrates the fall of the Bastille prison in 1789
that marked the beginning of the French Revolution.

   Barbara Bush concluded a 10-day trip to Europe
on Tuesday marveling about the newly renovated palace where she
stayed in the Netherlands but saying she wasn't impressed by a
massive military parade she watched in Paris.
   ``I'm not crazy about military parades,'' she confessed. ``Once
you've seen one tank, you've seen them all and 200 is too many.''
   She said her remarks probably would get her in trouble but
insisted that the tanks ``all looked alike.''
   Mrs. Bush discussed the trip to Poland, Hungary, Paris and the
Netherlands in an airborne interview on Air Force One on the flight
home from Amsterdam.
   Last Thursday, France rolled out tanks, armored personnel
carriers and other examples of military muscle in a parade that was
part of the celebration of the 200th anniversary of Bastille Day,
marking the beginning of the French Revolution.
   On Friday, there was a Bastille Day parade of marching bands,
extraordinary floats and other attractions, including opera star
Jessye Norman singing the French national anthem.
   Clearly, Mrs. Bush preferred the second one.
   ``Actually, one bursts with pride over Jessye Norman. It makes
you want to, you know, rev up those missiles and run out and fight
for France,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   The first lady said she really enjoyed the last stop in the
Netherlands, where she and President Bush stayed at Nordeinde
Palace, the pale yellow, newly renovated ``working palace'' used for
official functions and government offices.
   ``We slept in a sleigh bed last night with an enormous'' wood
frame, she said.
   ``They have a 12-foot swimming pool that has a current'' of
moving water, she added. ``And I got in and swam for 40 minutes in a
12-foot pool and just stayed there and swam.
   ``It's a wonderful thing,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``I never saw
anything like it.''

NOTEBOOK: PARADISE FOUND NEAR BUSY FREEWAY INTERCHANGE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The San Diego Freeway isn't exactly Restaurant Row -- especially not the part 
that stretches down into Orange County, south of LAX. But that part of the 
freeway is a high traffic area in more ways than one. Surely, reasoned 
developer Howard Mann, there ought to be enough commerce in the area to produce 
a substantial clientele for a high-quality restaurant. Thus, in constructing 
his Andrex Point complex, a 50-acre business park at the intersection of the 
San Diego and Harbor freeways just east of Torrance, he decided to install an 
eating place among the office buildings -- an "oasis," he said. And what better 
name for an oasis than Paradise? 
</P>
<P>
Paradise it will be, then. Mann has hired chef-consultant Debbie Slutsky, who 
helped open such restaurants as the Coyote Cafe in Santa Fe, China Moon in San 
Francisco, and Opera in Santa Monica, as menu consultant for the place. She 
promises "California eclectic" food, with assorted Asian (or, as they say 
nowadays, "Pacific Rim") accents. A beachy theme will be carried out in the 
decor, which will include, for instance, wash basins in the restrooms made out 
of old surfboards. Scott Johnson is architect on the project, with Vince 
Kikugama as management consultant. Mann expects to open Paradise in September.

REVOLUTIONARY DINING: All the Bicentennial Bastille Day Activities Fit to Eat: 
Champagne in West L.A. observes Bastille Day on July 14 with a special 
seven-course dinner (including such dishes as le saumon Robespierre and a 
dessert called l'extase du bourreau -- "the executioner's ecstasy"). Tariff for 
the first seating, from 6 to 6:30 p.m. is $70 a head . . . or rather, per 
person. For the second seating, between 8:15 and 8:45 p.m., the price goes up 
to $90 per person, and black tie or period costume is requested -- there will 
be dancing to a live orchestra. . . . Two days later, on the 16th, the 
non-profit July 16th Committee hosts a gigantic Bicentennial festival in the 
infield at Hollywood Park. Among the attractions will be French-style street 
entertainers (jugglers, fire-eaters, musicians and the like), races involving 
both French waiters and French and American horses, a petanque (bowling) 
tournament, and food and drink provided by such Gallic and not-quite-Gallic 
establishments and purveyors as Antoine's (in the Newport Beach Le Meridien 
Hotel), the Bistro Gardens, Cafe Pierre, Chez Sateau, Camelions, Citrus, Dar 
Maghreb, Emilio's, Fennel, L'Ermitage, Le Dome, Ma Maison, Patout's, Rebecca's, 
Koutoubia, Le Chardonnay, Michael's Waterside Inn, Perrier-Jouet Champagne, 
Evian Water, and that old French favorite, Coca-Cola. The event runs from 9 
a.m. to midnight, with tickets priced at $5 per person in advance and $7 per 
person at the door (with food and drink samples extra). The event will benefit 
the Starlight Foundation and the Pro-Musicis Foundation. Call (213) 472-9645 
for further information. 
</P>
<P>
Ma Maison in West Hollywood observes Bastille Day on both the 14 and 15 with 
food and live music. An a la carte menu and a five-course, $60-per-person prix 
fixe menu will be featured. . . . And if you still haven't gotten the 
Bicentennial out of your system, Salisbury Manor in Los Angeles brings up the 
rear with a commemorative seven-course post-Bastille-Day wine dinner on 
Wednesday, July 19, at 7 p.m. Price is $50 per person.

COMINGS AND GOINGS: Award-winning chef Jean Banchet and his wife Doris, owners 
of Le Francais in Wheeling, Ill. (near Chicago), have sold their landmark 
restaurant to Roland and Mary Beth Liccioni -- former chef and pastry chef, 
respectively, of another noted dining establishment in that area, Carlos' in 
Highland Park. The Banchets say they plan to rest for a while and might 
consider opening another place. Meanwhile, Jean plans to consult on several 
restaurant projects. . . . Don Dianda, owner of the resolutely old-style Doro's 
in San Francisco, has sold the establishment to Albert Bourla, owner of the 
Mao's Palace restaurants in Milbrae and San Carlos. Dianda plans to retire, as 
does longtime Doro's chef Paul Bermani. Neither the terms of the sale nor 
Bourla's plans for the place have been revealed. . . . And Rick O'Connell has 
resigned her post as executive chef for Rosalie's and RAF, two popular San 
Francisco eateries of a more modern bent. Both restaurants are operating under 
Chapter 11 protection. O'Connell was also in charge of the kitchen at the 
short-lived Los Angeles version of Rosalie's, which opened for a few months on 
the site of the old 385 North on La Cienega. 
</P>
<P>
BORN AGAIN: Bruno's Chartreuse, which closed last year at its Cheviot Hills 
location because the pretty little red brick building it occupied didn't meet 
city earthquake codes, has reopened in Santa Monica -- on the site of the 
recently shuttered Tosh. (Tosh owner/chef Jeff Vinion is reportedly going to 
open a new place in Santa Barbara. . . . The popular Cafe Beaujolais in 
Mendocino has spawned a casual offspring, The Brickery, next door. The simple 
menu includes nothing but salads, pizzas (cooked in a wood-burning brick oven) 
and desserts . . . . . . Stratton's, long a popular restaurant in Westwood, has 
opened a new branch in Encino. . . . And Peony, a Hong Kong-style seafood 
restaurant in San Gabriel, has sprouted a second location, this one in El 
Monte. 
</P>
<P>
NIBBLES AND BITS: From Paris comes world that chef Alain Senderens has 
introduced a new bargain-priced luncheon menu at his notoriously pricey 
three-star Lucas-Carton on the Place de la Madeleine. The cost of the new 
so-called "business lunch," offering a choice of four appetizers, four main 
courses, and four desserts? A mere 350 francs -- about $55 at the current 
exchange rate! Come to think of it, though, that's really not so bad: Another 
Parisian three-star, Jamin, now gets 350 francs apiece for several of its main 
courses. . . And, while you might think it's a given that Italy has better 
restaurants than Spain, the Guide Michelin doesn't necessarily agree. In their 
1989 guide to Spain and Portugal, just out, they have awarded Arzak in San 
Sebastian a third star. With Zalacain in Madrid, which earned its third star 
last year, that gives Spain two top-ranked Michelin restaurants; Italy still 
has but one, Gualtiero Marchesi in Milan. . . . Piero Selvaggio's Primi in West 
Los Angeles has introduced a new summer menu, featuring such unusual Italian 
dishes as snails with polenta, orange-cured salmon with eggplant and zucchini, 
and frogs' legs risotto. . . . Joe Patti has opened Piccola Alley behind his La 
Famiglia and Piccola restaurants in Beverly Hills. Chef is old-timer Henri 
Broussard, who ran Broussard's Patio Orleans on the Sunset Strip in the 1950s. 
. . . Fama in Santa Monica has opened for lunch on weekdays, and Cha Cha Cha in 
Los Angeles now serves brunch both Saturday and Sunday, from 11:30 a.m. to 5 
p.m. . And the Foodsource Hotline, a good number to call for restaurant 
information, has a new phone number: (213) 653-8585.

ON THE RECORD: MUSIC FROM THE FRENCH REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marc-Antoine Charpentier's harmonic vision, his ability to create splendid 
contrasts between his vocal and instrumental forces, were part of a revolution 
in French music that took place a century before the more celebrated (and 
bloody) social and political Revolution of 1789. 
</P>
<P>
The glories of Charpentier's style are exemplified in his 1692 "Te Deum," at 
once music with the trumpets-and-drums swagger we associate with the Court of 
Versailles and a work of the sweetest Italianate lyricism. 
</P>
<P>
The performance of the "Te Deum," as centerpiece of a program of the composer's 
liturgical works (on Harmonia Mundi France 901298), is by the vocal and 
period-instrumental forces of Les Arts Florissants under the direction of 
William Christie, who produced results that are both admirable for their 
scholarship and irresistible for their joyous energy. 
</P>
<P>
Among the music that was making the rounds at the time of the storming of the 
Bastille was that of Etienne-Nicolas Mehul (1763-1817), whose four symphonies 
are played by the Gulbenkian Foundation Orchestra of Lisbon under Michel 
Swierczewski on a pair of Nimbus CDs (5184/5). 
</P>
<P>
On present evidence, Mehul's most noteworthy quality, aside from the 
aimlessness of his slow movements, is his general disdain for French models in 
favor, variously, of Haydn, Weber, Rossini and particularly Mozart and 
Beethoven, whose G-minor (K. 550) and Fifth Symphonies, respectively, are 
tediously constant -- if not necessarily conscious -- points of reference. 
</P>
<P>
It was as a composer of operas that the Italian-born Luigi Cherubini found 
favor in his adopted French homeland around the time of the Revolution. But 
while there are occasional revivals of his 'Medee" and "Anacreon" in Europe, 
Cherubini's broader reputation today is based on Beethoven's admiration for his 
works (the feeling was not reciprocated), for his having instructed an 
ungrateful Berlioz in the rigors of counterpoint, and for writing a series of 
powerful, if severe, works for chorus and orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
The best known of these is the Requiem in C minor commissioned in 1817 to 
commemorate Louis XVI's execution by guillotine a quarter-century earlier. It 
is scored for mixed chorus (without soloists) and a late-Beethoven-sized 
orchestra with the addition of bass trombone and tam-tam, both used to stunning 
effect in the "Dies Irae." 
</P>
<P>
The Requiem, which has past identifications with Arturo Toscanini and Carlo 
Maria Giulini, has now been entrusted to the less exalted hands of the young 
East German conductor Claus Peter Flor, who nevertheless leads it with 
commanding sensitivity. His Berlin Symphony makes a brave sound, and the Berlin 
Radio Chorus is well balanced and accurate. The live-performance recording is 
gorgeously lifelike (RCA 60059). 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Cherubini, Berlioz did not disdain martial pomp, as witness his 
"Symphonie funebre et triomphale," written in 1840 to celebrate the 10th 
anniversary of the July Revolution that toppled the absolutist regime of 
Charles X. 
</P>
<P>
In his memoirs, Berlioz recalls the disastrous premiere, which found him 
conducting a military band of 200 musicians while walking backwards -- Berlioz, 
not the band -- along one of Paris' main boulevards toward the Place de la 
Bastille. 
</P>
<P>
"As we were marching," Berlioz writes, "nothing could be made out more than 10 
yards away. Finally, the National Guard, tired of standing in the blazing sun 
in the Place de la Bastille, began to march off to the accompaniment of some 50 
side drums maintaining a relentless barrage throughout the Apotheosis" (the 
symphony's rabble-rousing finale). 
</P>
<P>
"That," he continues, "is how they regard the role of public occasions in 
France: By all means let it figure as an attraction -- for the eye." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the best way to hear this music is on recordings, particularly when 
presented as lustily as it is (on Nimbus 5175) by British trumpeter/conductor 
John Wallace and his 60-odd member wind ensemble, the Wallace Collection. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace augments the Berlioz with band music from the (first) Revolutionary 
period by Gossec, Cherubini and Rouget de Lisle, his "Hymne a la liberte" -- a 
k a "La Marseillaise" -- in Wallace's arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
The last-named is sung with appropriate abandon, in a language purported to be 
French, by the Leeds Festival Chorus, which also adds its obscure mouthings to 
the "Symphonie funebre."

   High-wire artist Philippe Petit walked a tightrope
soaring over Paris to the second level of the Eiffel Tower on
Saturday, and said later his biggest problem was trying not to have
too much fun.
   With a brisk breeze blowing off the Seine River, Petit leaped
onto the rope at the Palais de Chaillot and walked 2,300 feet on a
cord set at a 16-degree angle to the Eiffel Tower's second level,
330 feet above the sidewalk.
   Thousands of people watched breathlessly as he crossed the length
of more than seven football fields on a wire as thin as three
pencils, occasionally stopping to salute the graceful tower.
   On his balancing bar was a copy of the Declaration of the Rights
of Man, the enduring statement of social justice and liberty that
emerged from the French Revolution in 1789.
   ``My head was full of pure and beautiful things, I felt a
profound joy, almost like a child, an engulfing elation,'' Petit
said afterward, looking windswept and tired but triumphant.
   ``The hardest part was not letting my joy surpass the control I
needed to continue. I was invaded by a joy that was almost dangerous
because I had my life in my hands.''
   With well-wishers and the press on hand, Petit announced that his
next walk would be across the Grand Canyon next summer.
   Petit, known for his dangerous walks between the towers of Notre
Dame Cathedral and New York's World Trade Center, slid down a
gossamer thin rope to the second floor of the Eiffel Tower and
delivered the declaration text into the hands of Paris Mayor Jacques
Chirac.
   His slender 5-foot-7-inch frame was decked out at the beginning
in a silver jumpsuit with sky blue scarves dangling from his arms
and legs.
   Early on in the walk, he stripped off the costume by French
couturier Thierry Mugler and was left in a multi-colored body
stocking that made him look like a small exotic bird against the
blue sky.
   He lay down, carelessly dangling a leg off the wire. He stopped
to admire the monuments of Paris. He waved his arms and kicked his
feet.
   ``Magnifique, formidable, super,'' bubbled 8-year-old Joanna
Bosc, who added that she enjoyed the show.
   Eighteen-year-old Fleur Saltes came 60 miles from the town of
Meaux to see the spectacle and said it was worth the trip.
   ``It was really scary because of the wind, but it ended
wonderfully,'' she said.
   The walk was the highlight of celebrations marking the
bicentennial of the Declaration of the Rights of Man.
   Partying continued Saturday night at a concert sponsored by
President Francois Mitterrand under the monumental cube of the new
Arche de la Defense.
   An international line-up of performers played in the nationally
televised concert, including American diva Barbara Hendricks,
Senegalese singer Youssou Ndour, American jazzman Eddy Louiss,
French rocker Jacques Higelin, African swinger Manu Dibango, popular
Algerian singer Cheb Khaled and others.
   The events brought to an end a busy summer of bicentennial
celebrations, which climaxed with parades and fireworks on July 14,
the 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille Prison.

<HEAD>Disarmament, Trade To Be Discussed During Gorbachev Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail Gorbachev's visit to Paris this week will
include a trip to the Bastille and talks with President Francois
Mitterrand that likely will cover France's unwillingness to discuss
reducing its nuclear force.
   The trip comes one week before France celebrates the bicentennial
of the French Revolution and plays host to a summit of the seven
major Western industrialized nations. It will include a visit to
Strasbourg, where the Soviet president will address the Council of
Europe.
   Gorbachev, who arrives Tuesday, will be the first leader from the
East bloc to speak at the council. He is expected to define more
precisely the European role of a Soviet Union that has strived to
restructure its economy.
   ``A very important political declaration from the Soviet
leadership to the European public and political leaders on the
subject of a common European house will be the thrust of the
speech,'' said Andrei Grachev, deputy chief of the Communist Party's
international department, speaking to reporters at a briefing Friday.
   The ``common European home,'' an idea first expressed during
Gorbachev's visit to France in 1985, has been a vague concept in
Soviet diplomacy as the Kremlin seeks to improve relations with its
Western European neighbors. The term implies an end to the Cold War
and a change in Soviet foreign policy.
   Gorbachev is expected to use his speech to spell out the kind of
cooperation the Soviets are looking for in human rights,
environmental protection, culture and the battle against terrorism.
   In talks with Mitterrand on Tuesday and Wednesday, Gorbachev is
likely to bring up once again France's own nuclear arsenal, which
the Soviets see as an adjunct of the U.S. nuclear force.
   During his last visit, Gorbachev made sweeping arms control
proposals that later were the basis for U.S.-Soviet disarmament
negotiations. But he failed to bring Mitterrand into separate talks
on reducing France's independent nuclear force.
   The French Socialist president told Gorbachev then that it was
``not reasonable to think that there could actually be
negotiations.''
   A spokesman for the presidential palace said Friday that
Mitterrand would like to discuss chemical weapons with his Soviet
counterpart as well as regional conflicts such as Lebanon and
Cambodia.
   The French president also would like to see a reversal in the
trade deficit with the Soviet Union _ $318 million in the first
three months of this year compared to $773 million for all of 1988.
   In 1988, the main Soviet exports to France were oil and gas while
France imported primarily machinery and equipment.
   Gorbachev also plans to tour the Place de la Bastille on Tuesday,
where on July 14, 1789 workers stormed a prison fortress, unleashing
events that led to the French Revolution.
   On Wednesday, he will sign a series of Soviet-French agreements
and have meetings with Mayor Jacques Chirac, Premier Michel Rocard
and then with students and intellectuals at the Sorbonne University.
   Gorbachev will meet with Mitterrand again Thursday before leaving
for Strasbourg.
   The visit to France, which took over the rotating chairmanship of
the European Economic Community on July 1, is not expected to break
new ground in French-Soviet relations. Nor will the 58-year-old
Soviet leader find the French as effusive as the West Germans, who
thronged his stops during his visit there last month.
   Still, polls show Gorbachev to be far more popular with the
French than President Bush. The Paris Match-B.V.A. poll last week
showed Gorbachev inspired confidence in 60 percent of 1,000 French
people surveyed while only 51 percent felt the same about Bush.
   ``He is more charismatic than Bush and better known,'' said
Dominique Moisi of the French Institute for International Relations.
   ``But the French expect much less of him than the West Germans
and they are more skeptical of the Soviet Union. Besides, French
crowds simply tend to be less demonstrative than German ones.''

   Hatred of tyranny inspired the revolutions that
led to independence for the United States and France, retired U.S.
Chief Justice Warren Burger said Friday.
   U.S. and French officials gathered on the steps of the Jefferson
Memorial to mark the 200th anniversary of the storming of the
Bastille.
   Youngsters sang the ``La Marseillaise'' and ``The Star Spangled
Banner,'' the U.S. Army Band played the French march ``Father of
Victory,'' and senators joined in reading the French Declaration of
the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the U.S. Bill of Rights.
   French Ambassador Emmanuel de Margerie said the ideas of
Voltaire, Rousseau and other French thinkers of the Age of
Enlightenment inspired Thomas Jefferson as he wrote the Declaration
of Independence.
   ``The winds from America blew over France'' with their message of
liberty, democracy and human rights, he said.
   Iaugurating a postage stamp marking the French Revolution, U.S.
Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said the fall of the Bastille
was a triumph of ``patriots over tyrants who made peaceful
revolution impossible.''
   Burger, Frank and U.S. Army Secretary John O. Marsh Jr. said the
military contributions of the Marquis Gilbert de Lafayette, Admiral
de Grasse and General Rochambeau hastened victory in the American
War of Independence.
   Burger said the two nations inspired each other in their hatred
of tyranny, and that if the French violence was more severe it was
because ``the provocations that led to your revolution were more
severe than those that led to ours.''
   Sens. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan., and John Warner, R-Va., and
former U.S. Solicitor General and Harvard Law Dean Erwin N. Griswold
read portions of the French Declaration and the U.S. Bill of Rights,
adopted in August and September 1789, respectively.
   Frank said the new 45-cent U.S. international airmail stamp shows
three statues representing liberty, equality and fraternity
superimposed on a red, white and blue tricolor. Its issuance was
coordinated with issuance of France's own bicentennial stamps.

   China on Monday accused France of continuing to
interfere in its domestic affairs by allowing Chinese students to
march in the Bastille Day parade in Paris.
   Hundreds of Chinese students wearing headbands with the Chinese
characters for ``Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'' rode bicycles in
the parade Friday. They carried a banner saying, ``We carry on.''
   During a meeting with the French Ambassador Charles Malo, a
Foreign Ministry official called it ``an attack by insinuation
against the Chinese government.''
   The official noted the students participated in a celebration
that was attended by dozens of heads of state and broadcast live to
many countries, ``thus creating a very bad impact throughout the
world.''
   He also said France has ``repeatedly taken actions unfriendly to
China,'' but did not elaborate.
   China repeatedly has criticized France for giving refuge to
leaders of the crushed pro-democracy student movement, among them
Wu'er Kaixi.
   The Foreign Ministry official also said a group of youths
attacked the Chinese Embassy in Paris on Friday, smashing
second-floor office windows and prying away a copper doorplate.
   It was the second time China has protested an incident at its
embassy in France. China says a group of people occupied the embassy
June 29 and harassed the staff.
   Relations between the two nations have been strained since troops
put down the student movement on June 3-4, killing hundreds _
perhaps thousands _ of people. France froze contacts at all levels
two days later.
   Attache Jean Poncet said regular contacts up to the ministerial
level continue, but they are ``not always pleasant contacts.''
   On Friday, the French community in Beijing marked the 200th
anniversary of the French Revolution with a brief ceremony that
contrasted sharply with the festivities in Paris.
   The French Embassy originally planned an all-night party with
bands and orchestras, dancing, buffets and fireworks in the city's
diplomatic section. Instead, about 200 of Beijing's French community
attended a one-hour ceremony at the embassy.
   Malo read the first two articles of France's first Declaration of
the Rights of Man and the Citizen, but ``he didn't speak (and)
didn't mention China at all,'' Poncet said. The document, approved
by the National Assembly in 1789, upholds the rights of all people
to freedom and equality.
   ``We didn't feel it was right'' to hold a larger celebration,
Poncet said, explaining the embassy didn't want to invite Chinese
officials.
   ``Not because of the persons themselves, but because they
represent (Chinese) institutions,'' he said.
