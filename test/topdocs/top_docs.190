   Iraq and Iran exchanged 71 prisoners of war
today, the first day of a Red Cross-sponsored operation to
repatriate more than 1,500 sick and disabled prisoners from the
Persian Gulf war, Iraqi officials said.
   Red Cross officials earlier had said 151 prisoners _ 110 Iraqis
and 41 Iranians _ were to be freed. But only 52 Iraqi POWs left
Tehran aboard a DC-9 jet chartered by the International Committee
for the Red Cross.
   In response, Iraq returned only 19 Iranians aboard the same
plane, which is to shuttle between the two capitals on a daily basis.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, Cyprus, said fewer Iraqis flew to Baghdad because some had
asked for political asylum.
   Others were no longer eligible for repatriation after Red Cross
doctors verified they had recovered from their illness, the news
agency said.
   Each departing prisoner was given a copy of the Koran, the holy
book of Islam, and Persian craftwork as gifts, the news agency said.
   The DC-9 was to fly between Tehran and Baghdad for the next 10
days to repatriate up to 1,115 Iraqis and 411 Iranians, all sick or
wounded, according to a memorandum of understanding signed by Iraq
and Iran with the Red Cross.
   The repatriation, which is being paid for by an unidentified
Western nation, is the largest prisoner exchange so far between the
countries who agreed Aug. 20 to a cease-fire in their eight-year
war, IRNA said.
   The last POW exchange, of 25 Iraqis and 25 Iranians, took place
Oct. 30, as a mutual goodwill gesture before U.N.-mediated Iran-Iraq
peace talks resumed in Geneva. The talks have made no progess.
   A Red Cross official in Baghdad, Paul Henri Morard, said the
plane would fly the shortest route between Tehran and Baghdad.
Despite the cease-fire, many planes still avoid flying directly over
the joint border.
   The Red Cross proposed to start the exchange Nov. 20, but it was
twice postponed because some prisoners on both sides were unwilling
to return home and sought to go elsewhere, according to diplomatic
sources in Baghdad.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a number of
prisoners asked to leave for an unidentified Western country.
   In addition, some Iranian prisoners want to join the Mujahedeen
Khalq, the Iraq-based opposition group that seeks to overthrow the
government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the sources said.
   Morard said the Red Cross has already registered 50,182 Iraqi
POWs and 19,284 Iranians, but the total number of POWs estimated by
both countries is 100,000. He said the Red Cross has repatriated 765
Iraqi sick and wounded POWs and 613 Iranians since 1981.
   As signatories of the Geneva Convention, both sides are pledged
to repatriate all POWs without delay after ``cessation of
hostilities.'' The sick and wounded should have been returned while
the fighting was still in progress, according to the convention.

   Iran and Iraq began a 10-day exchange of
sick and wounded prisoners of war Thursday, but a jet chartered by
the International Red Cross shuttled fewer men than than promised
between the enemy capitals.
   A Red Cross statement issued in Geneva said only 19 Iranians and
41 Iraqis were flown home Thursday despite an accord with both sides
providing for the repatriation of 41 Iranians and 115 Iraqis every
day.
   The statement said the reduced numbers resulted from
``differences of interpretation between the two parties with regard
to criteria and procedures.''
   Iraq, which received the first prisoners, accused Iran of
reneging on the agreement, according to which 1,570 men are to be
repatriated. In retaliation, Baghdad reduced the number of Iranians
sent home.
   A dispatch from Iran's official news agency, monitored in Cyprus,
said fewer Iraqis were returned because 15 of the 115 asked for
political asylum, 21 already had been granted asylum and 27 no
longer were eligible for repatriation because Red Cross doctors
found them recovered from their illnesses.
   It said each departing prisoner was given gifts of Persian
craftwork and a copy of the Koran, the Islamic holy book.
   Iran and Iraq began a cease-fire Aug. 20 after nearly eight years
of war, and this is the first prisoner exchange since the truce. It
is being made under an agreement they signed earlier this month with
the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   Under Red Cross auspices, 765 ill or wounded Iraqis and 613
Iranians have been repatriated since 1981. The Red Cross says it has
registered 50,182 Iraqi POWs and 19,284 Iranians, but the total held
by both countries is estimated at about 100,000.
   Pilot Riegert Poloux said the trip between the capitals, which
are only about 500 miles apart, took 2{ hours because he had to fly
via Turkey.
   He said the governments originally agreed to let the plane use a
direct route, but final arrangements were not made in time. The next
shuttle Saturday is expected to be direct.
   The 730-mile border was the battleground in the war, which began
in September 1980. U.N.-sponsored peace negotiations since the
cease-fire have made little progress and the Red Cross fashioned the
POW exchange agreement in separate talks with Iran and Iraq.
   Iraqi prisoners arriving at Saddam International Airport had
shaved heads, long beards and clean military-style uniforms. Most
wept when they stepped from the DC-9 and many shouted nationalistic
slogans.
   One who knelt to pray on the tarmac at the airport, which is
named for President Saddam Hussein, said afterward: ``It is great to
be home again. I feel reborn.''
   Some shouted ``Long live Iraq! Long live Saddam Hussein!'' Others
bent to kiss the ground while comrades prayed loudly, thanking God
for the return home.
   Red Cross officials helped many out of the plane and turned them
over Iraqi medical personnel. Many were in wheelchairs, some walked
with sticks and all appeared frail.
   Officials would not let reporters interview the repatriated
prisoners.
   When the returning Iraqis were out of the plane, 19 Iranian
prisoners dressed in yellow track suits boarded it. Few were young
and none used wheelchairs or crutches.
   A senior Iraqi officer kissed them goodbye at the plane. Each was
offered a copy of the Koran, but some refused it.
   ``It is not Islamic. I will not take it,'' one said.
   Iraq accused Iran of withholding some Iraqi prisoners for
``political reasons.''
   Akram Witri, head of the legal department at the Foreign
Ministry, said the Red Cross told the Baghdad government a few hours
before the exchange that fewer Iraqis would be repatriated.
   ``We have informed the Red Cross and the United Nations that the
Iranians failed to accomplish their commitment and their
international duties,'' he told a news briefing at the airport just
before the plane arrived.
   He said Iraq would continue the repatriation but will not return
the number agreed upon unless Iran does.
   Witri said the repatriated Iraqi prisoners would be given medical
examinations before rejoining their families.

<HEAD>131 Iranian POWs Fly Home; U.N. Mediator Arrives</HEAD>

   Iraq released 131 sick and disabled Iranian
prisoners of war and the Red Cross flew them back to Tehran, where a
U.N. mediator arrived on a mission to revive stalled peace talks.
   Iran offered no immediate sign that it would reciprocate and
resume prisoner exchanges that ended two months ago, but Iraq said
it planned to free 124 more Iranians on Tuesday.
   The arrival Monday in Tehran of the Iranian POWs was noted in a
brief report by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   ``Baghdad, pressed by world bodies, has relented and set free a
group of Iranian disabled prisoners of war,'' said the agency,
monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   Officials with the International Committee of the Red Cross
supervised the return of the prisoners to Tehran in an airliner
chartered by the Geneva-based agency.
   Red Cross spokesman Juerg Bischoff said there is no indication
the exchange of all sick and wounded prisoners will be resumed soon.
He said the release of the 131 on Monday followed a ``unilateral
decision'' by Iraq.
   He said it came outside a Nov. 11 agreement, which provided for
the immediate return of 1,569 registered POWs to be followed by the
repatriation of all other sick and wounded by the end of last year.
The accord broke down Nov. 27 because of a dispute over the number
of prisoners to be repatriated.
   Fifty-six Iranian and 155 Iraqi POWs were freed before the
exchange broke down.
   Andries Qun, head of the Red Cross mission in Baghdad, told
reporters at the airport that Red Cross officials had also examined
and interviewed the prisoners. He said all were in good condition.
   He did not elaborate, but all the POWs apparently indicated that
they wanted to be returned home.
   ``I'm very happy to be going home,'' said Amosh Toosi, 35, who
said he was captured in the southern battlefront in the early days
of the war.
   ``The war was terrible. I was only told a few days ago that I was
to be repatriated,'' said Toosi, a medical student in the southern
city of Shiraz before the war.
   U.N. special envoy Jan Eliasson, Sweden's ambassador to the world
body, was greeted at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport on Mondasy by Iranian
Foreign Ministry officials, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
   An English-language Iranian newspaper said in an editorial Monday
that the deadlocked peace process may take a turn for the worse if
no breakthrough happens soon.
   ``We do not know whether Mr. Eliasson is bringing new proposals
for breaking the ice or whether he will try to persuade Iran and
Iraq on the same old lines,'' it quoted the editorial as saying.
   After his talks in Iran, Eliasson will travel to Baghdad Jan. 27
to discuss the U.N-sponsored peace negotiations with Iraqi
officials, said IRNA.
   A U.N.-mediated cease-fire in the Persian Gulf war took effect
Aug. 20, but peace talks that opened in Geneva five days later under
U.N. auspices broke down immediately. Two more rounds of talks
failed to resolve the deadlock over troop pullouts to prewar borders.
   U.N. Security Council Resolution 598 calls on Iran and Iraq to
halt ``all military activities'' and honor the truce, withdraw
troops to pre-war borders, exchange around 100,000 prisoners of war
and start peace talks.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 Iraqi prisoners held by Iran
and 19,284 Iranians in Iraqi camps. But U.N. and other officials
estimate the number is far higher and could reach 100,000 held by
both sides.

   Political turmoil in Iran is likely to prevent
significant progress in a new round of peace talks with Iraq
expected to be held soon, an exiled Iranian said Monday.
   Shahram Chubin, an exiled Iranian historian, said that with two
of his senior aides losing their posts in the past few weeks,
Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran would probably stick to
a hard-line course rather than expose himself to criticism at home.
   ``And of course, Iraq would have little incentive to offer too
much if it is not getting an response,'' said Chubin, who worked at
the London Institute for Strategic Studies before taking a teaching
post at Geneva's prestigious Graduate Institute of International
Affairs.
   Iranian Foreign Ministry officials and U.N. officials met last
week to lay groundwork for a new round of talks between Velayati
and his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz. They have agreed to hold the
talks in the near future at an undisclosed site near U.N.
headquarters in New York, but no date has been set. The talks have
been deadlocked since November over Iran's insistence that Iraqi
troops withdraw from Iranian territory, while Iraq insists that the
first step should be the clearing of war debris from the Shatt
al-Arab waterway on the border.
   Before a U.N.-brokered U.N. agreement last August, at least 1
million people were killed or wounded in the eight-year Persian
Gulf War. Some estimates of the dead alone surpass 1 million, and
the economic cost totals hundreds of billions of dollars.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Chubin noted that
ousted Deputy Foreign Minister Javad Mohammad Larijani and Jaffar
Mahallati, Iran's U.N. ambassador, were both associates of
Velayati. He also said there is some uncertainty whether Velayati
himself will last.
   Chubin said pragmatists in the Foreign Ministry are now
struggling to push their views while radicals like Interior
Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashami ``are making as much capital as
possible.''
   The historian predicted that Khomeini will avoid a definitive
stand, ``sometimes taking one side and sometimes the other.''
   ``Khomeini is too clever to entrust the future of the Islamic
Republic to one faction,'' he said.
   Also in Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross
said 66 Iraqi prisoners of war were repatriated on Monday after
their unilateral release by Iran.
   The Geneva-based humanitarian agency said the prisoners were all
wounded, sick or elderly. Four other prisoners refused to be
repatriated and remained in Iran, it said.
   Iran had said it would free the prisoners to mark the 10th
anniversary of the founding of the Islamic Republic.
   More than 100,000 war prisoners are still held by Iran and Iraq,
according to Red Cross estimates. Only 2,295 have been released
since the cease-fire.

   Charging too few Iranian prisoners of war
were being returned by Iraq, Iran said it has halted its exchange of
prisoners from the Persian Gulf conflict.
   Tehran Radio said in a report monitored in Cyprus on Sunday that
Iran's Foreign Ministry sent a letter to the International Red
Cross, sponsor of the exchange, demanding the immediate release of
an additional 67 Iranians.
   Under a Nov. 11 accord, Iran and Iraq agreed to release up to
1,570 sick and disabled POWs in batches of about 150, who would fly
home aboard a plane chartered by the International Committee for the
Red Cross.
   The 10-day operation started Thursday, but Iran freed 52 Iraqi
prisoners instead of 110 due for repatriation that day.
   Iran said the remainder asked for asylum in Iran or recovered
from their wounds and no longer were eligible for exchange.
   In retaliation, Iraq sent back 19 instead of 41 Iranian POWs.
   The third prisoner swap took place Sunday with 52 Iraqis and 19
Iranians being released.
   ``By continuing this behavior, Iraq in effect will keep
imprisoned many sick and wounded Iranian prisoners, and their
release will not be guaranteed,'' the Iranian radio quoted the
letter as saying.
   The radio also quoted the head of Iran's committee for war
prisoners, Ataollah Mohajerani, as saying ``the continuation of the
prisoner exchange depends on Iraq's release of 67 Iranian POWs.''
   The Red Cross and Iraqi officials had no immediate comment on the
Iranian announcement.
   U.N.-sponsored peace negotiations following an Aug. 20 cease-fire
in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war are stalled, but the prisoner
exchange agreement was reached in separate talks with the Red Cross.
   The Red Cross has registered names of 50,182 Iraqi and 19,284
Iranian POWs, but estimates the total number on both sides at
100,000.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said 22 Iraqi POWs
due for release on Sunday were ``ineligible'' because they had
recovered from their disability.
   The agency, also monitored in Cyprus, said nine others stayed on
for further medical examinations while three more were granted
asylum in Iran.
   IRNA said only 10 soldiers were among the 19 Iranians repatriated
Sunday. It described the others as civilians _ some aged over 60 _
who were captured by Iraqi troops shortly after they invaded Iran in
September 1980.
   Before the current exchange, the two gulf war foes repatriated
765 Iraqi and 613 Iranian sick and wounded prisoners since 1981.

   Iraq has asked the International Red Cross
to arrange for the repatriation of 200 sick and wounded Iranian
prisoners of war, a Red Cross official said.
   Arnold Luethold, a deputy of the head of the Red Cross
delegation, told The Associated Press that Iraqi officials have
asked them to prepare for the release of the Iranian POWs and return
them to Iran.
   ``We think this is a humanitarian gesture which could help to
resume the POW exchange,'' he said.
   Luethold said preparations are underway to charter a plane in
Switzerland to take the prisoners from Iraq to Iran.
   The Red Cross official confirmed that the Iraqis have not asked
for any Iraqi POWs in exchange for the Iranians.
   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein last week decided to release a number
of Iranian prisoners equivalent to the number of participants in an
Islamic conference here that ended Friday.
   The Islamic scholars appealed to him to make a goodwill gesture.
   Diplomatic sources here believe that the move could pave the way
to resume the exchange of wounded POWs which was halted Nov. 27
after the two countries exchanged 155 Iraqis and 56 Iranians
   The two countries on Aug. 20 began a cease-fire in their
8-year-old war.

   Iraq and Iran will free 150 disabled
prisoners of war Thursday, the first batch of prisoners they agreed
to repatriate early this month.
   Diplomatic sources said the exchange was delayed by prisoners on
both sides balking at going back to their respective countries.
   Red Cross officials said a DC-9 plane will fly from Tehran
carrying 110 Iraqi POWs. It will fly back to Tehran with 41 Iranian
POWs.
   The plane hired by the Red Cross will shuttle between Tehran and
Baghdad for 10 days to repatriate up to 1,115 Iraqis and 411
Iranians, all sick or wounded according to a memorandum of
understanding signed by both Iraq and Iran with the Red Cross.
   Red Cross representative Paul Henri Morard told The Associated
Press that all preparations for the exchange have been completed.
Iraq has set up special camps to process the arriving prisoners
before they go home.
   Morard, who arrived from Geneva to supervise the operation, said
the Red Cross finished its medical checks and had identified all the
POWs who will be repatriated.
   He also said that the Red Cross has asked each POW if he wishes
to be repatriated or not in line with the Geneva conventions on the
treatment of POWs. Morard refused to say whether any declined
repatriation, saying those prisoners will be processed last.
   But the diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said some prisoners have asked to leave for an unidentified Western
country. Also some of the Iranian prisoners want to join the
Mujahedeen Khalq, the Iraq-based opposition group that seeks to
overthrow the government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the sources
said.
   Morard said the Red Cross has already registered 50,182 Iraqi
POWs and 19,284 Iranians, but the total number of POWs estimated by
both countries is about 100,000.
   He said the Red Cross has repatriated 765 Iraqi sick and wounded

   The Red Cross official said the DC-9 will fly the shortest route
between Tehran and Baghdad. Despite the Aug. 20 gulf war cease-fire,
many planes avoided flying directly over the joint border.
   The operation will be supervised by 17 members of the Red Cross
staff in Baghdad and 18 in Tehran. It is being paid for by an
unidentified Western nation.

<HEAD>Iraq Says It Will Immediately Release Injured POWs If Iran Does
Same</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq today said his
country was willing to begin repatriating sick and wounded prisoners
from its 8-year-old war with Iran, if Iran agrees to do the same.
   His statement seemed to clear the way for a prisoner exchange,
following Iran's earlier offer to release all sick and wounded
prisoners as well as civilian detainees ``on a reciprocal basis.''
   Aziz, speaking to reporters after a meeting with officials of the
International Committee of the Red Cross, said the repatriation
would apply to 411 Iranians and 1,115 Iraqis who have been
identified by the Red Cross.
   A Red Cross spokeswoman, Francoise Derron, confirmed that number
had been registered, but said ``since we have not been able to visit
all POWs we may assume there are more'' ill and injured prisoners.
   The Red Cross has registered a total of 50,182 Iraqi prisoners in
Iran and 19,284 Iranians in Iraq. The Red Cross has estimated the
number of additional, unregistered prisoners is 20,000 to 30,000 on
each side.
   The standard Red Cross practice is to register and interview
every prisoner to make sure his repatriation is voluntary.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, already has offered
to release all sick and wounded prisoners as well as civilian
detainees ``on a reciprocal basis.''
   Aziz said the repatriation should be begun by each side at the
same time.
   Aziz said Iraq wanted an immediate repatriation of sick and
wounded prisoners ``to put an end to their suffering and their
families' anxiety after the cessation of active hostilities'' and to
comply with the Geneva Convention governing POWs.
   He said it should not be taken by Iran ``as a pretext to block
the comprehensive exchange operation in accordance with the Geneva
Convention, as more than 100,000 POWs from both sides still suffer
from captivity'' despite a cease-fire that began Aug. 20.
   The Red Cross has offered to oversee an exchange of prisoners..
   The question of a prisoner exchange has been a problem in the
U.N.-mediated peace talks. The talks are aimed at consolidating the
cease-fire and peace in the region.
   Iraq has called for an immediate exchange of all prisoners
independent of the peace talks. Iraq has said it would release its
more than 30,000 prisoners right away if Iran would reciprocate.
   But Iran has linked a full-scale prisoner exchange to agreement
on a withdrawal of troops, saying this would be under the terms of
the U.N. Security Council's cease-fire Resolution 598.
   Last week, Aziz charged that Iran was delaying a prisoner
exchange. Velayati accused Iraq of using humanitarian issues as a
pretext for delaying withdrawal of its troops from Iranian territory.
   In an interview Monday with Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency, Velayati claimed no Iranian troops were left on Iraq
territory but said Iraqi forces were occupying more than 386 square
miles of Iranian territory.

   The U.N.-mediated peace talks between Iran and
Iraq will move to New York next week in what could be a prelude to
the withdrawal of forces from the war zone, Iran's foreign minister
said today.
   The minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, said U.N. mediator Jan
Eliasson asked the two delegations to come to New York City on
Sept. 22 during a 20-minute face-to-face meeting today between the
two enemies.
   ``We accepted,'' Velayati said. ``We hope that in New York we
could finalize the timetable which starts with the withdrawal of
the forces to the internationally recognized borders.''
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq, the first to emerge after
the formal session, declined to speak to reporters.
   In another development, Iran released 72 wounded or sick Iraqi
prisoners of war who were flown home under the auspices of the
International Committee of the Red Cross, the organization reported.
   The Red Cross said the repatriation of the 72 Iraqis Monday was
``the result of a unilateral decision by the Iranian authorities
and was not connected with the release'' of all POWs as called for
under the U.N. cease-fire resolution.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iran now has
released 775 Iraqi war prisoners since the U.N.-sponsored
cease-fire went into effect Aug. 20.
   Red Cross figures show 613 Iranian prisoners have been
repatriated.
   The organization has registered 50,182 POWs in Iranian camps and
19,284 in Iraqi camps, but a U.N. report released last week
estimated that Iran may be holding up to 70,000 war prisoners and
Iraq about 35,000.
   Iran and Iraq went to war in September 1980.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar presided over the
first week of negotiations that began last month between Iran and
Iraq and then appointed Eliasson as his personal representative.
   Iraq is demanding sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab estuary
that is its only waterway access to the Persian Gulf and that the
outlet be cleared of sunken ships and silt.
   Iran's priorities include the withdrawal of both side's troops
to internationally recognized borders, the exchange of war
prisoners and a U.N. investigation to determine who started the war.

   Iran on Saturday called for the United
Nations to put pressure Iraq so that a permanent truce in the
Persian Gulf war can go into effect.
   A commentary broadcast on Tehran Radio and reported by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency said a deadline should be set
for putting into effect a U.N. Security Council resolution that
calls for troop withdrawals, prisoner exchanges and peace talks.
   A U.N.-mediated cease-fire in the eight-year gulf war took effect
Aug. 20, but peace talks that opened in Geneva five days later broke
down immediately.
   The commentary, monitored in Nicosia, said the way to ensure
progress in the peace talks was for the United Nations to apply
``corrective discipline'' to Iraq.
   The commentary did not mention specific sanctions but appealed to
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar ``to think of other
devices for implementing the resolution.''
   It also called for ``more serious international actions'' to
pressure Iraq into withdrawing from Iranian territory it occupied
during the war and freeing prisoners of war.
   The commentary was aired shortly before a special United Nations
envoy, Jan Eliasson, was due in Tehran in an effort to restart
stalled peace talks between the gulf war foes.
   The Swedish U.N. ambassador was to arrive in Iran on Jan. 23 and
travel to Iraq Jan. 27.
   Three rounds of peace talks have failed to resolve the deadlock
over troop pullouts to prewar borders.
   U.N. Security Council Resolution 598 calls on Iran and Iraq to
halt `all military activities'' and honor the truce, withdraw troops
to prewar borders, exchange around 100,000 prisoners of war and
start peace talks.
   Iran ``firmly believes a final date for execution of the
Resolution should be set,'' IRNA reported the radio as saying.
   Iraq occupies 259 square miles of Iranian territory and refuses
to pull out until Iran gives up the right to search ships in the
gulf for Iraq-bound war cargo.
   Iran, which has not stopped any Iraqi ship since the cease-fire,
insists that troop withdrawals must be the next stage in the peace
process.
   On Friday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz said Iran's tactics
were blocking peace talks, citing Iran's refusal to exchange sick
and wounded POWs as a major obstacle to progress in the negotiations.
   An exchange of 1,158 sick and disabled POWs sponsored by the
International Committee for the Red Cross in November collapsed four
days after it began, amid mutual recriminations over the numbers to
be repatriated.
   A total of 155 Iraqi and 56 Iranian POWs were freed before the
operation broke down Nov. 27.
   On Saturday, a senior Red Cross official said the organization
will begin Monday repatriating 255 Iranian prisoners of war that
Iraq unilaterally decided to release earlier this month.
   The official, Arnold Luethold, told The Associated Press that a
plane chartered by the Swiss relief agency will fly about half the
Iranian prisoners to Tehran on Monday.
   He said the Iranians already have been examined by Red Cross
medical staff but declined to say whether all of them are willing to
be repatriated.
   The Red Cross says it has registered 50,182 Iraqi and 19,284
Iranian POWs but estimates the total number of prisoners at more
than 100,000.
   Before the failed November exchange, the two sides had exchanged
765 sick and wounded Iraqi and 613 Iranian POWs.

   U.N.-mediated peace talks between Iran and Iraq
resume Monday in an effort to consolidate the precarious truce and
disengage troops in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar flew to Geneva
Sunday and said he hoped for substantive progress on an exchange of
prisoners held by the two countries.
   Each country released 25 prisoners of war Sunday but still hold
thousands of others.
   Iraq freed 25 disabled Iranian prisoners and they were flown to
Tehran, the capital of Iran, aboard a plane chartered by the
International Red Cross. Iran reciprocated immediately by releasing
25 Iraqi prisoners who boarded the same plane for the return flight
to Baghdad, Iraq, according to Francoise Derand, a spokesman at the
Red Cross office in Geneva.
   In a brief chat with reporters after his arrival, Perez de
Cuellar said he hoped the meetings in Geneva would be ``if possible
much more useful'' than the 10-day round early this month in New
York.
   Perez de Cuellar last week named withdrawal of the forces as his
first priority in the new negotiations.
   Urgency to his efforts was added by a report warning that forces
``remain in dangerous proximity'' after eight years of fighting
that has killed or wounded an estimated 1.5 million.
   The report by the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group warned
of constant danger of renewed fighting between the two sides, whose
soldiers are separated in some places by only 30 feet.
   A cease-fire has been in effect since Aug. 20.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and his Iraqi
counterpart, Tariq Aziz, have said no progress was made on the
principal issue stalemating the talks since they began in Geneva
Aug. 25 _ the delineation of a border between the two nations.
   Iran says a 1975 treaty set the border in the middle of the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only navigable outlet to the sea.
   Iraq, which rejected the treaty in 1980, demands sovereignty
over the entire waterway.
   Other disputed stretches line the more than 800-mile-long
frontier, according to U.N. sources. They say the discrepancies
have impeded an exact definition of the ``internationally
recognized boundaries'' to which the two countries are to withdraw
under the U.N.-mediated cease-fire.
   The resolution calls for a permament cease-fire, withdrawal of
troops to the pre-war border and the repatriation of POWs.
   Last month, 72 disabled Iraqis were freed by Iran and
repatriated, the first such operation since the cease-fire.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 Iraqi prisoners of war in
Iran and 19,284 Iranian prisoners in Iraq. The United Nations
estimates Iran and Iraq hold a combined total of up to 105,000 POWs.
   Iraq has freed 638 war prisoners and Iran 790, including the 50
released Sunday, according to the Red Cross.

   Iraq and Iran exchanged 69 disabled soldiers
today, but both countries returned fewer prisoners of war than
promised under an agreement worked out by the International Red
Cross.
   Red Cross officials in Baghdad told The Associated Press Iran
sent only 51 Iraqi prisoners and Iraq reciprocated by returning just
18 Iranians.
   The Red Cross refused to comment on why the Tehran government
repatriated 51 prisoners, at least 34 less than promised in the
agreement on a 10-day exchange covering up to 1,570 prisoners.
   The first group of the sick and disabled POWs was repatriated
Thursday. Both nations returned fewer prisoners than promised on
that day, too.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said that some prisoners it
had intended to return were no longer sick or wounded, some had to
be kept back for further medical examinations and others chose not
to be repatriated.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Iraq repatriated just 18
prisoners instead of the promised 41 because of the Iranian action.
   With the prisoners sent back Thursday, 103 Iraqis and 37 Iranians
have been repatriated, flown back aboard a plane specially chartered
by the Red Cross.
   Before the latest round of repatriations, the two sides had
exchanged 765 Iraqi sick and wounded POWs and 613 Iranians since
1981. The Red Cross has registered 50,182 Iraqi POWs and 19,284
Iranians, but the total number of POWs is estimated at 100,000.
   Iran and Iraq started peace talks under United Nations auspices
five days after an Aug. 20 cease-fire went into effect in their
eight-year war. The talks have made no progress. The agreement with
the Red Cross on exchanging disabled POWs, signed earlier this
month, came outside the framework of the peace talks.
   In Iraq, the head of the legal department of the foreign
ministry, Akram Al-Witri, said that Iraq will continue repatriating
Iranian sick and wounded POWs, but insisted the exchange will be
based on reciprocity. ``We will send them the same proportion of the
number they will send us,'' he said.
   He said Iraq is not convinced by claims that some of the
prisoners have opted to stay in Iran or have been cured of their
illness.
   ``The Red Cross did not provide us with authentiticated papers
that they have asked to stay in Iran or not to return back home,''
he said.
   Al-Witri said it is doubtful the sick Iraqi POWs that Iran
claimed were cured have been treated because all were listed with
chronic disabilities in previous reports given to Iraq.

<TEXT>
   Iran on Wednesday accepted a Red Cross proposal to
begin exchanging disabled war prisoners with Iraq on Nov. 20.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, made the
announcement after meeting with Jan Eliasson, the U.N. mediator in
the Iran-Iraq peace talks.
   Eliasson met earlier with the Iraqi foreign minister, Tariq Aziz,
who did not immediately announce his response.
   The countries have a total of 1,569 disabled prisoners captured
during the Iran-Iraq war, which began in September 1980. Red Cross
spokesman Juerg Bischof said the agency has registered 1,158 in Iran
and 411 in Iraq.
   The Geneva talks are aimed at consolidating a cease-fire that
took effect Aug. 20. A new face-to-face session is scheduled
Thursday.
   Bischof said technical talks on how to proceed with the prisoner
exchange are under way. He said the Nov. 20 date will give officials
time to make preparations, such as chartering a plane that may have
to be specially equipped to transport the wounded.
   Iraq announced Tuesday that it was ready to begin immediately
with the repatriation of wounded Iranians the Red Cross has
identified in Iraqi camps, provided Iran also agrees to send home
disabled Iraqi POWs.
   Iran said Oct. 21 that it was prepared to release the wounded
``should Iraq be willing to reciprocate.''
   In a note to both governments Oct. 4, the Red Cross encouraged
repatriation of sick and wounded prisoners and the registration of
all prisoners, estimated to total more than 100,000, ``as a matter
of priority.''
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 Iraqi POWs in Iran and 19,284
Iranians in Iraq, but it estimates each side holds another 20,000 to
30,000. It has urged both governments to supply complete lists and
insists that all prisoners be interviewed by Red Cross delegates to
make sure repatriation is voluntary.
   In the U.N.-mediated peace talks that began Aug. 25, Iraq has
been pressing for the release and repatriation of all POWs,
independent of negotiations on consolidating the truce.
   Iran insists that such global release be linked to other
provisions in the U.N. cease-fire resolution. It urges that priority
be given to the withdrawal of forces to ``internationally recognized
borders.''
   That border is disputed since Iraq, a few days before the
outbreak of the war, repudiated a 1975 treaty delineating it. The
issue has stalled the peace talks since August.

   The Red Cross said Friday it is hopeful a 10-day
air shuttle can repatriate more than 1,500 disabled Iraqi and
Iranian prisoners as planned, although the exchange started with
fewer prisoners than expected.
   On Thursday, the first day of the exchange, each side sent back
fewer than half the number of prisoners envisaged under an accord
they signed earlier this month with the International Committee of
the Red Cross.
   Red Cross officials said they were working with both sides to
resolve the problems in the first major exchange of prisoners since
a cease-fire Aug. 20 ended fighting in the 8-year-old war between
the Persian Gulf neighbors.
   The International Committee spoke of a ``setback,'' but spokesman
Juerg Bischof said it is hopeful the goal of returning all sick or
wounded prisoners by the end of the year can be achieved.
   He said Red Cross delegates in Baghdad and Tehran were in touch
with the responsible officials and other contacts were made through
diplomatic channels in an effort to reconcile ``differences of
interpretation.''
   Bischof said plans to continue the exchange Saturday remained in
effect, and ``we hope that this time the numbers of returnees will
be as planned.''
   Under the accord, 115 Iraqis and 41 Iranians are to be
repatriated daily in air shuttles between the capitals, except on
Friday, the Moslem holiday.
   On Thursday, only 52 Iraqis and 19 Iranians were flown home
aboard a DC-9 jet chartered by the Red Cross.
   Iran said 36 of those chosen for the first flight sought or
already had been granted political asylum, and 27 had recovered from
illness and no longer met the criteria for repatriation.
   Iraq accused Iran of reneging on the accord and responded by
reducing the number of Iranians sent home.
   Bischof would not comment on the Iraqi charges.
   He said the accord was based on a list of 1,569 disabled POWS the
Red Cross compiled some years ago.
   ``This old list was the only concrete basis,'' he said. ``At
least it was something to work with, as no other sick and wounded
prisoners have been registered yet by the ICRC. Only if the whole
list has been covered will we be able to say how many no longer met
the criteria for repatriation.''
   All prisoners are examined by a three-member commission _ two
Swiss Red Cross physicians and a local doctor. Subsequently, each
prisoner is asked by a Red Cross delegate, without witnesses, to
make sure he agrees to repatriation.
   Under the accord, both sides agree that Red Cross registration of
all other disabled prisoners can begin Dec. 5.
   ``We have no reason to assume that this date will be changed,''
Bischof said.
   More than 100,000 prisoners of war are believed held by both
sides.
   In Iran, meanwhile, Speaker of Parliament Hashemi Rafsanjani
vowed that Iran would never start a war and warned that his country
must be wary of new attacks by Iraq, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported Friday.
   Rafsanjani, in remarks to a gathering of paramilitary troops in
Tehran on Thursday, said Iraq's commitment to peace was
questionable, the agency reported.

   The International Committee of the Red Cross said
today that it has proposed that Iran and Iraq begin releasing sick
and wounded prisoners on Nov. 20.
   The Red Cross said the exchange would include a total of 1,569
disabled prisoners captured by both sides during their 8-year-old
war.
   ``Technical talks are still under way to undertake the
exchange,'' Red Cross spokesman Juerg Bischof said. ``We have
proposed Nov. 20 as the starting date but we have not received a
formal answer from the two sides.''.
   Iraq announced Tuesday that it was ready to begin immediately

   Tehran and Baghdad described their offers to return the sick and
wounded as ``humanitarian'' initiatives. As signatories of the
Geneva conventions, both countries already were pledged to
repatriate them.
   The Red Cross has registered a total of 50,182 Iraqi POWs in Iran
and 19,284 Iranians in Iraq, but estimates that each side holds
another 20,000 to 30,000. It has urged both governments to supply
complete lists and insists that all prisoners be interviewed by Red

   Reports in the Iranian press said that about 20,000 Iraqis want
to stay in Iran. About 2,500 Iraqis have torn up their Red
Cross-issued identity cards in front of Red Cross delegates. Iranian
POWs who publicly announced their opposition to the revolutionary
government may also be reluctant to accept repatriation.
   In the U.N.-mediated peace talks that began Aug. 25, five days

   The U.N. secretary-general met a senior
International Red Cross official today to prepare for direct
Iran-Iraq peace talks and one of the negotiation's thorniest
issues: repatriation of war prisoners.
   Security Council Resolution 598 urges release and repatriation
of prisoners of war without delay after a cease-fire. Hostilities
were halted one week ago, and U.N. peacekeeping forces took up
positions along the Iran-Iraq border.
   Maj. Gen. Slavko Jovic, the head of the U.N. forces, said the
cease-fire was holding, despite minor problems over troop
movements, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said today
in a report monitored in Nicosia.
   In Geneva, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and his
Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz, were to arrive today for
face-to-face talks, set to begin with Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar on Thursday afternoon.
   The talks will mark the first direct discussions by top Iranian
and Iraqi envoys since the Persian Gulf war began in 1980. The
U.N.-sponsored talks are aimed at reaching a comprehensive peace
settlement of the Iran-Iraq war.
   Perez de Cuellar has said he expects the talks to be long and
difficult, lasting at least several months. The atmosphere
surrounding the negotiations is bitter because of charges and
countercharges of truce violations.
   The agenda was not disclosed, and Francois Giuliani, spokesman
for the U.N. chief, told reporters today there is no time limit on
the talks. However, he said the secretary-general must return to
New York for the opening of the General Assembly on Sept. 20 and
may have to shift the talks to New York.
   In an interview with the French daily Le Monde, Perez de Cuellar
said in Geneva that it was difficult to predict how long the peace
talks might take.
   ``It all depends on the political will of the parties,'' he said
in today's editions of the newspaper. ``If they really want to
resolve the problem, it could take only a few months. If not, it
could drag on for years and I would then name a personal
representative to follow the negotiations.''
   The U.N. chief will meet separately with Aziz and Velayati
Thursday morning and will be present when the two envoys meet in
the afternoon in the Council Chamber at the headquarters of the
former League of Nations, Giuliani said.
   The secretary-general will be present during all meetings
between the envoys during the first phase of discussions.
   Perez de Cuellar met today with Cornelio Sommaruga, president of
the all-Swiss International Committee of the Red Cross, to discuss
the problem of repatriating prisoners of war.
   Perez de Cuellar says both sides hold about 80,000 POWs,
including more than 50,000 captured by Iran. Many of the prisoners
reportedly have rejected repatriation, called for under a U.N.
peace plan. Red Cross officials say they must interview each
prisoner to determine his wishes before arranging a return.
   Resolution 598, the U.N. peace plan, calls for a cease-fire,
early troop withdrawal to international boundaries and repatriation
of prisoners of war. It also calls on both sides to cooperate with
the U.N. chief in reaching ``a comprehensive, just and honorable
settlement'' of all outstanding issues.
   The long-term agenda for the talks also is expected to cover a
border dispute over the Shatt al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only access
to the gulf and establishment of a commission to determine which
side started the war. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after
border shelling by Iran and a history of hostilities between the
Arab and the Persian nations.
   Earlier today, an Iraqi oil tanker passed through the Strait of
Hormuz, the first since the Iran-Iraq war began, the official Iraqi
News Agency reported. The strait is the narrow body of water at the
southern end of the Persian Gulf.
   The Ain Zalah, carrying a load of Iraqi crude oil, was the third
Iraqi vessel to sail into the gulf since the cease-fire went into
effect.

   Iran demanded today that Iraq free an
Iranian oil minister who was captured 10 years ago and said it
refused to believe that he was killed when he fell into enemy hands
at the outset of the Iran-Iraq war.
   The dispute over the captured minister comes just as the two
nations have begun to improve relations.
   Iraq began improving ties with Iran so it could move hundreds of
thousands of troops off its border toward Saudi Arabia, where they
have been in a standoff with a multinational force since Iraq
invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News agency demanded the
immediate release of the oil minister, Mohammed Tondguyan.
Tondguyan was believed to have been wounded and captured by Iraqi
forces while visiting a border oil field in October 1980, a month
after the outbreak of the Iran-Iraq war.
   He was not among 75,000 prisoners of war of both sides who were
exchanged following the improvement of relations between the former
combatants. IRNA said Iraqi officials claimed at the end of the
exchange that Tondguyan was killed during the Iraqi attack on the
oilfield.
   But the Iranian official overseeing the POW exchange, Mohammad
Nazaran, was quoted by IRNA as saying Iran had ``live and
documented evidence'' that Tondguyan ``is alive and being held in a
secret Iraqi prison.''
   ``If Iraq has good will it should release him immediately,'' he
was quoted as saying in the report, which is monitored in Nicosia.
   The Iraqis claim all the Iranian prisoners were repatriated in
the monthlong swap, which was abruptly halted last month without
any explanation from either side.
   The Iranians and the International Committee of the Red Cross,
which coordinated the exchange, maintain Iraq still holds several
thousand Iranians.
   Nazaran said Iran is waiting for information about 24,000
Iranian prisoners whose fate was not known.
   Prisoners refusing to be repatriated would be interviewed by
officials of the International Red Cross. According to
international regulations, prisoners cannot be repatriated against
their will.
   Nazaran accused the Red Cross of being influenced by the
Iraq-based Iranian opposition group, ``Mujahedeen Khalq,'' or
People's Holy Warriors, in discouraging many Iranian prisoners from
returning home.
   Iran and Iraq resumed formal diplomatic relations last week, but
the POW issue has caused a chill in the improved climate.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, under heavy international
pressure following his invasion of Kuwait, accepted Iranian peace
terms in mid-August.
   The terms included shared sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway, Iraqi withdrawal from occupied Iranian territory and the
exchange of prisoners.

   Iraq today began freeing Iranian
prisoners of war and withdrawing troops from Iranian territory in
an effort to settle one conflict while it faces growing world
pressure over its occupation of Kuwait.
   Iran announced it also was freeing Iraqi POWs today to
reciprocate for Baghdad's peace initiative, but it did not disclose
their number.
   The first batch of freed Iranian POWs arrived in Qasr-E-Shirin,
an Iranian border town decorated with the green Islamic Republic
flag, portraits of the late Ayatollah Rughollah Khomeini and
colorful ribbons.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, did
not say how many prisoners had arrived in Qasr-E-Shirin. But
Baghdad and the International Committee of the Red Cross have said
1,000 Iranians were to be freed today.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein Wednesday offered to release
Iranians captured in the eight-year war that ended in cease-fire in
August 1988. Peace talks have bogged down since then, but Saddam's
initiative could speed the process.
   Saddam also said he hoped to complete within five days the
withdrawal from Iraqi-occupied territory in Iran.
   Iraq, which invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 and massed troops along that
country's border with Saudi Arabia, faces a U.S. and Arab troop
buildup in the Saudi desert and a growing world trade embargo.
   Neutralizing the Iraq's 633-mile eastern border with Iran,
Iraq's longest frontier, frees an estimated 300,000 Iraqi troops
who could be sent to Kuwait to face the military buildup in Saudi
Arabia.
   The Red Cross has registered 19,000 Iranian POWs in Iraq and
50,000 Iraqis in Iran but estimates both sides actually hold a
total of more than 100,000.
   Iran says Iraq occupies more than 770 square miles of its
territory. But the United Nations says the size of the occupied
area is half that amount.
   The all-Swiss International Committee of the Red Cross, which
has been asked by Iraq to supervise the repatriation, said 1,000
was the maximum number its Baghdad delegation of 19 members could
handle.
   Under the Geneva Convention, the delegates must make sure, in
individual interviews, that no prisoner is sent home against his
will.
   ``There have been no problems so far,'' Red Cross spokeswoman
Martine Haemmerli said in Geneva.
   Inmates of an Iraqi camp at Mosul, near the Turkish border, were
to make up the first release, and delegates began interviewing them
Thursday.
   The Red Cross has said experience gained in the first phase is
hoped to allow stepping up the pace to an eventual 2,000 daily. An
increase of the Baghdad delegation is under review but no decision
has yet been taken.
   Saddam made his peace initiatives in a letter to Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani. In the message, he also accepted
Iran's demand that a settlement of the border dispute be based on a
1975 demarcation treaty.
   Saddam had rejected the 1975 agreement, which divided the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway between them. He wanted sovereignty over the
channel, a confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates that is a
major Iraqi outlet to the gulf.
   Iranian officials on Thursday welcomed Saddam's offer, but
Rafsanjani said developments on the Iran-Iraq front were separate
from the crisis triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``We hold on to our view that Iraq must evacuate (its forces)
from the Kuwaiti territory to create the necessary conditions for
reestablishment of peace and tranquility,'' Iran's official news
agency quoted Rafsanjani as saying.

<HEAD>Red Cross Official Fails to Arrange Iran-Iraq Prisoner Swap</HEAD>

   A senior Red Cross official flew to Geneva
on Wednesday after failing to arrange an immediate swap of ailing
and wounded prisoners held by Iran and Iraq more than a year after
their cease-fire.
   Angelo Gnadinger, the Middle East chief of the Geneva-based
International Committee of the Red Cross, ended his visit after
five days of talks in the Iraqi capital.
   He held similar meetings last week in Tehran with Iranian
officials, seeking the repatriation of 1,000 wounded and ailing
prisoners held by both sides.
   Gnadinger refused to comment to reporters on the outcome of his
visit before his departure.
   But Andreas Wigger, the chief Red Cross delegate in Baghdad,
said, ``I may say nothing concrete has been achieved. ... This is a
long process which needs more effort.''
   Gnadinger had hoped for an immediate release of the sick and
wounded as a first step toward settling the issue of the Iranian
and Iraqi prisoners of war under article 118 of the Third Geneva
Convention. The article calls for repatriation of POWs immediately
after hostilities cease.
   The Red Cross has registered some 50,000 prisoners held by Iran
and more than 19,500 in Iraqi camps. Many of the POWs have been
held since the early stages of the war that broke out in September
1980.
   However, diplomats and United Nations officials say the two
sides hold 100,000 POWs between them.
   Last year, Iran and Iraq released about 400 sick and wounded
prisoners. But the operation was stopped when both sides accused
the other of falsifying the number of captives seeking asylum.
   Earlier this week, hopes were raised that an agreement for a
prisoner swap was imminent. Akram al-Witri, chief of the legal
department at the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, said Baghdad had
responded positively to a Red Cross call to this effect.
   But Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati quickly
reiterated the Iranian position, undermining the effort. Tehran has
insisted it will not agree to swap the prisoners or implement any
other peace move with Iraq until Iraqi troops withdraw from land
they occupied in the final weeks of the war.
   A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire halted hostilities on Aug. 20, 1988,
but peace talks have been deadlocked mainly over the withdrawal
issue and Iraq's demand for a border demarcation accord that gives
it sovereignty over the entire Shatt-Al-Arab waterway.
   The channel, a confluence of the great Tigris and Euphrates
rivers, is Iraq's sole gateway to the gulf. Before the war, the
border ran down the middle of Shatt-Al-Arab.

   The stalled Iran-Iraq peace talks have
left tens of thousands of prisoners of the Iran-Iraq war
languishing in camps, waiting for freedom that may be months, even
years, away.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran, who heads his
country's delegation at the talks, said in a recent Tehran radio
interview monitored in Nicosia: ``We're trying to get an exchange
of POWs arranged as quickly as possible.''
   But United Nations officials said the issue has still had not
been discussed at the month-old peace talks when they went into
their stall.
   When a prisoner exchange does come off, however, it will be the
biggest organized by the International Committee of the Red Cross
since the Geneva Convention of 1949.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 prisoners held by Iran and
19,284 by Iraq. But U.N. officials and diplomats in Baghdad and
Tehran believe Iran holds 60,000 to 70,000 prisoners and Iraq
30,000 to 50,000.
   The POWs include hundreds of Iranian boy soldiers, many of whom
have been held since the early days of the 8-year-old war and have
grown up in captivity.
   The Soviet Union held thousands of Germans after World War II.
The last 9,000 were only released in 1955 after the Soviets and
West Germans agreed to establishing diplomatic relations.
   Iran has freed a handful of disabled Iraqis since a cease-fire
took effect Aug. 20.
   But Iraq has freed none and has even added to its tally by
seizing more than 700 Iranians in September in what Tehran claims
was a major cease-fire violation.
   U.N. observers have confirmed the Iranians were captured, but so
far have not been able to secure their release.
   Iraq's information minister, Latif Nayef Jassim, said his
countrymen ``are opening their arms wide to welcome home'' the POWs
held by Iran.
   But some diplomats fear that both sides will try to use the
prisoners as bargaining chips in the peace talks that bogged down,
almost as soon as they began, over sovereignty of the Shatt Al-Arab
waterway and troop withdrawals.
   The POWs appear to have become pawns in the propaganda war
between Iran and Iraq that has swelled since the peace talks began
Aug. 25 in Geneva.
   Iraq, stung by international condemnation for its alleged use of
outlawed chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels, has intensified
accusations that the Iranians have tortured, killed and brainwashed
Iraqi POWs. Iran has made similar charges.
   Jassim recently accused the Iranians of ``inhuman practices .. .
starting with mass executions and ending with psychological
torture.''
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted him as saying in a
statement: ``The savagery of Iran's rulers and their mad practices
against Iraqi POWs has caused the death of a large number of them.''
   Thirty disabled Iraqi POWs released by Iran in early September
recently told a Baghdad news conference that their Iranian guards
systematically torture prisoners and pressure them to switch
allegiances. Like most Iranians, many Iraqis are Shiite Moslems.
   Christians among the Iraqi POWs were singled out and subjected
to extreme maltreatment and pressure to convert to Islam by their
Shiite guards, the ex-POWs said.
   ``When I told them I was a Christian, they asked me to convert
to Islam before they would give me any medical help,'' said Wa'd
Aziz Na'mou, who told reporters he was captured in January 1987,
after he was wounded in the eyes during an Iranian offensive.
   ``I refused and they left me without treatment. I lost both
eyes. Many of the Christian soldiers were forced to convert to
Islam under psychological pressure and torture.''
   The prisoner's account could not be independently confirmed with
other sources or raised with Iranian officials because of limited
access Western news organizations have with Tehran.
   A prisoner exchange could also be hampered by thousands of POWs
held by both sides who do not want to return to their homelands or
who fear persecution once back home.
   A U.N. report in August said officials who visited some of the
15 known POW camps in Iran reported that they appeared to be run
internally by Iraqi Shiites who had switched allegiance to
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The report said that as many as 20 percent of the Iraqi POWs
seen by the officials appeared to be defectors. Tehran newspapers
have said up to 20,000 Iraqi prisoners have opted to stay in Iran.
   The U.N. report added that many POWs on both sides fear
persecution if they go home and said Iraqi prisoners might riot if
repatriation is attempted.
   Many Iranians were also hesitant about being exchanged, the
report said.

   Seventy-five sick and disabled Iraqi
prisoners of war arrived home Wednesday, leaving behind six comrades
who requested political asylum in Iran, officials said.
   The 75 are among 260 Iraqi POWs that Iran said it would free to
mark the 10 anniversary of its Islamic revolution earlier this
month. Twenty-five of the 260 have asked to stay behind, according
to reports by the official Islamic Republic News Agency monitored in
Cyprus.
   The first group of 80 prisoners arrived home Tuesday, and another
80 will be repatriated Thursday, said IRNA.
   An official of the International Committee of the Red Cross in
Baghdad confirmed that Iranian authorities told the organization
Wednesday that six POWs asked for asylum.
   He said the all-Swiss committee gave medical examinations to all
the prisoners and chartered the plane that carried them home. He
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The plane will fly back to Tehran to transport the last batch of
prisoners on the 2{-hour ride Thursday.
   A United Nations-sponsored cease-fire halted the gulf war Aug.
20. But peace negotiations have stalled and a previous agreement to
exchange prisoners of war in November collapsed over mutual
recriminations of bad faith, including the numbers requesting asylum
on both sides.
   Iraq released 255 Iranians last month.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross has registered
50,182 prisoners held by Iran and 19,284 Iranians in Iraqi hands.
But United Nations and other officials estimate the number of
prisoners at 100,000.

   Military officers from Iraq and Iran will
meet Wednesday at their countries' common border to help stabilize
the cease-fire in the war, U.N. peacekeepers announced Saturday.
   U.N. officials last week told The Associated Press each country
will be represented by 10 officers. They will work with their
governments and the U.N. observers to resolve problems in carrying
out the cease-fire agreement.
   The U.N. cease-fire monitoring group said in its statement that
the meeting will be held on the cease-fire line near the Iraqi town
of Khanaqin and the Iranian city of Qasr-e-Shirin.
   The U.N. announcement said the session will be led by the chief
of the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group, Yugoslav Maj. Gen.
Slavko Jovic.
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq told a news conference
Saturday that the military group will work on purely technical
matters.
   Aziz also said Iraq was informed by the International Committee
of the Red Cross that Iran will allow 260 Iraqi prisoners of war to
go home soon. He said the number was too small considering Iraq's
release last month of 255 Iranian POWs.
   An exchange of 1,158 sick and disabled POWS sponsored by the Red
Cross collapsed last November amid mutual recriminations over the
number repatriated. Only 155 Iraqi and 56 Iranian prisoners were
released at that time.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 Iraqi prisoners and 19,284
Iranian prisoners. But U.N. and other estimates put the total at
100,000.
   At least 1 million people were killed or wounded in the war,
which began with an Iraqi invasion in September 1980 after several
border skirmishes. However, some estimates of the dead alone surpass
1 million, and the economic cost totals hundreds of billions of
dollars.
   A Red Cross official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the relief group is preparing to repatriate the Iraqi POWs this
week, although no date for their release has been fixed. He said the
Swiss-based Red Cross has chartered a plane to fly the Iraqi POWs
from Tehran to Baghdad.

   A United Nations envoy on Tuesday sought
to get Iran-Iraq peace talks moving again by meeting with Iranian
leaders in Tehran. Another planeload of Iranian POWs arrived from
Iraq.
   The 124 ailing and disabled Iranian prisoners of war were
released unilaterally by Baghdad in what Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein called a ``humanitarian gesture'' and was the second group
to be repatriated in as many days.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Jan Eliasson, special
envoy for U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez De Cuellar, met with
deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Hussein Lavasani and discussed ways
to end the impasse.
   Iran and Iraq ended eight years of fighting Aug. 20 under a U.N.
Security Council cease-fire resolution.
   The resolution calls on the nations to halt ``all military
activities,'' withdraw troops to pre-war borders, exchange about
100,000 prisoners of war and start peace talks.
   Iraq occupies 259 square miles of Iranian territory. Baghdad says
it will not pull out unless Iran gives up its right under
international law _ until a peace treaty is signed _ to search ships
in the Persian Gulf for Iraq-bound war cargo.
   Iran has not stopped Iraqi ships since the cease-fire, and
insists that troop withdrawals must come next in the peace process.
   Tehran radio said ``Eliasson's trip is primarily for setting a
date for the resumption of the peace talks.'' Iran, however, will
not resume negotiations without a guarantee there will be progress,
according to the report.
   The peace talks became snarled almost as soon as they began five
days after the cease-fire took effect. Three rounds of negotiations
since then have failed to break the deadlock.
   ``The secretary general is determined that the various points of
the resolution be implemented as soon as possible,'' Tehran
television quoted Eliasson as saying on his arrival Monday night.
   The television, monitored in Nicosia, reported Eliasson as saying
he also plans to inspect the Iran-Iraq border during his visit.
   Eliasson, also Sweden's U.N. ambassador, is due in Baghdad Friday.
   If there is no progress in future talks, Perez de Cuellar still
would be bound by the U.N. Security Council to carry out provisions
of the cease-fire resolution, Tehran radio said.
   Tehran's Kayhan daily Monday called for ``punitive measures'' to
ensure progress and suggested a deadline be set for implementing the
resolution, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The official agency, monitored in Nicosia, reported the newspaper
as saying such measures should include a ``political and economic
international boycott'' of Iraq, ``which can easily force Baghdad to
adopt a reasonable attitude towards the talks.''
   Baghdad's Ath-Thawra daily Tuesday said Iraq wants a
``comprehensive implementation of the resolution in sequential
order.''
   Tuesday's return of Iranian prisoners of war followed the release
of 131 on Monday. Both groups were flown to Tehran in an airliner
chartered by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   There was no indication Tehran would respond to the Iraqi moves,
the first prisoner releases since a Red Cross-sponsored exchange
broke down Nov. 27 because of a dispute over the number of prisoners
to be freed.
   Before the exchange was halted, 155 Iraqis and 56 Iranians were
freed.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 Iraqi prisoners held by Iran
and 19,284 Iranians by Iraq. The United Nations and other officials
say the nations together could hold as many as 100,000 prisoners.

   Iran told the International Red Cross on
Monday it is ready to exchange prisoners of war with Iraq under the
U.N. peace plan if Iraq agrees to the same terms.
   The Foreign Ministry statement to the International Committee of
the Red Cross in Geneva repeated Iran's assertion that ``it is
prepared for the speedy repatriation of prisoners of war,'' but it
said the exchange must occur under Security Council Resolution 598.
   That resolution, passed unanimously July 20, 1987, and accepted
by Iran a year later, also embodies a peace plan for the 8-year-old
war and the secretary-general's implementation program. Copies of
the Iranian statement were circulated Monday at U.N. headquarters
in New York.
   Iraq has expressed willingness to begin immediate repatriation
of POWs on humanitarian grounds if Iran agrees, but outside the
U.N. peace process.
   Iranian diplomats have said the Iraqi move is an effort to
undermine Resolution 598, which calls for a comprehensive peace,
swift exchange of POWs after a truce and withdrawal to
international borders.
   Iraq has claimed Iran is stalling on the POW issue. Peace talks
in Geneva are deadlocked but plans for the next round are expected
to be announced Tuesday.
   According to Red Cross records Iran has 50,182 Iraqi POWs and
Iraq 19,284 Iranians, but U.N. officials and diplomats in both
countries estimate the totals at 60,000-70,000 held in Iran and
30,000-50,000 in Iraq.
   Iran's letter said it had repatriated hundreds of disabled,
wounded and sick Iraqi prisoners in the past few years with no
reciprocation from Iraq.

   Iraq today said it will free 1,000 Iranian
prisoners a day under an initiative aimed at ending conflict with
Iran to focus on the confrontation with the U.S. forces deployed in
the Persian Gulf.
   An air force spokesman, meanwhile, warned Iraq ``cannot
guarantee the safety'' of any foreign pilot who might be shot down
over Iraqi territory. He said such guarantees were impossible
because of ``the rage the Iraqi people and the Arabs harbor for the
aggressive foreign intervention.''
   The warning was broadcast by Baghdad Radio, which did not name
the spokesman.
   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted a presidential spokesman
as saying Iraq had decided to repatriate 2,000 Iranian prisoners a
day as of Friday.
   But the Red Cross said it did not have the facilities to absorb
such a large number of POWs, ``and that it is ready to handle 1,000
prisoners daily,'' the agency quoted the spokesman as saying.
   It said arrangements were under way so the number may be
increased at a later stage.
   The agency said those held longest will be the first to be
released Friday at the border posts of Kasr-e-Shirin and Khanaqin.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus, said preparations to receive the freed inmates have been
completed.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross said today it has
begun interviewing Iranian prisoners, asking them if they wanted to
be repatriated. Martine Haemmerli, spokeswoman for the Swiss-based
organization speaking in Geneva, quoted Iranian authorities as
saying they are prepared to accept the prisoners at the border.
   She said there has been no word yet from the Iranians as to when
the first large group of Iraqi POWs would be repatriated.
   The Red Cross has registered some 50,000 POWs held by Iran and
19,000 by Iraq. But U.N. officials and diplomats in Tehran and
Baghdad maintain that the total number of POWs captured in the
1980-88 war is more than 100,000.
   In his peace offer Wednesday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
also said that he would begin withdrawing troops Friday from
Iranian territories occupied in the final weeks of the Iran-Iraq
war, halted by a U.N. cease-fire on Aug. 20, 1988.
   Iran has been pressing for a complete exchange of prisoners,
albeit on its own terms, since the U.N.-sponsored truce took effect.
   It welcomed Saddam's offer and is expected to agree to free
Iraqi prisoners.
   In a letter to Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani, text of
which was broadcast by the official media Wednesday, Saddam said he
accepted a 1975 border demarcation treaty as a basis for resolving
the border dispute.
   Saddam's abrogation of the treaty was one of the reasons that
pushed the two countries into war in September 1980.
   His refusal to reinstate that accord which gave Iraq and Iran
equal share of the strategic Shatt-al-Arab waterway was a major
obstacle in U.N.-sponsored peace talks launched after the
cease-fire.
   Saddam had insisited on full Iraqi sovereignty over
Shatt-al-Arab, a major Iraqi outlet to the gulf.
   Saddam's message Wednesday did not specify the area from which
his troops will withdraw. Tehran claims Iraq still holds 770 square
miles of its land. The United Nations says the size of the occupied
area is half of that.
   With the exception of Jordan, all the countries neighboring Iraq
have closed their borders due to U.N. sanctions, imposed on Iraq
after its Aug.2 invasion of Iraq.
   A peace treaty with Iran, whose 630-mile border is Iraq's
longest, would remove the threat of warfare on that front.
   It also would allow Saddam to throw the manpower now used along
the border with Iran into the confrontation with the forces
assembled in Saudi Arabia.

   Iran sent home 1,000 Iraqi prisoners of war as a sign of its
confidence that Baghdad's repatration of POWs, which began Friday,
will continue.
   The troop withdrawal and prisoner exchange followed an offer by
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday to bring a formal end
to the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. A cease-fire halted the fighting
two years ago.
   Iraqi troops, flying white flags, began pulling out of Iranian
border areas Friday night. Iraqi forces had already pulled out of
more than half the occupied areas in the southern Shalamcheh and
Kushk regions, Iran's Islamic republic News Agency said Saturday.
   Saddam has said the pullout will take five days.
   Iran says Iraq occupies more than 773 square miles of its
territories. But the United Nations says the size of the occupied
area is half of that.
   The Iraqi army daily newspaper al-Qaddasiyah declared in an
editorial Saturday that the 30 divisions which have been facing
Iran would now be used to bolster Iraqi formations in the south.
   That was the first official Iraqi word that Baghdad will
redeploy forces freed from the Iranian border in Kuwait, occupied
by Iraq on Aug. 2.
   The forces ``which are leaving Iran's borders ... and the high
readiness of our air force will be an additional might to what we
had already prepared against the aggressive forces,'' the daily
said.
   It was not known how many of the 30 Iraqi divisions _ more than
200,000 troops _ would be moved to Kuwait. The Iraqis have about 10
divisions in to the occupied emirate and have more than 120,000
troops massed on the border with Saudi Arabia.
   Iranian newspapers ran huge headlines Saturday welcoming the
prisoners, some of whom were captured soon after the outbreak of
war in September 1980.
   The Farsi-languge Jomhuri Eslami called their return ``a major
victory for Iran.''
   The site of the prisoner exchanges, Qasr-e-Shirin, a sleepy,
dusty town inside the Iranian border, was decked with flowers,
flags, and colored ribbons.
   At Tehran's Mehrabad airport, a 10-year-old girl named Nahid
waited anxiously for the arrival of her father. She knew him only
from a framed photograph on the mantel and from her mother's
stories.
   In a message to the International Committee of the Red Cross,
Iranian Red Crescent head Vaheed Dastjerdi urged that the prisoner
repatriation be boosted to 5,000 a day ``with regard to the
sensitive and dangerous conditions in the Persian Gulf.''
   The Red Crescent said it could handle that many. But the
International Committee of the Red Cross has said that for now, it
can only handle daily 1,000 mandatory interviews to make sure the
prisoners want to go home. It said it hoped to increase that number.
   The Red Cross has registered about 19,000 Iranian POWs in Iraq
and about 50,000 Iraqis in Iran. But the United Nations estimates
that both sides actually hold more than 100,000.

   On the eve of a new round of peace talks, Iran and
Iraq each released 25 prisoners of war and U.N. chief Javier Perez
de Cuellar said he would promptly seek the repatriation of the
thousands that remain.
   The United Nations secretary general told reporters on arrival
Sunday that he hoped the third round of talks that begins today
would soon yield ``positive results,'' specifically on the exchange
of prisoners.
   But he has said his first target as mediator to have both sides
agree to the disengagement of forces that a U.N. report says have
remained in ``dangerous proximity'' since Aug. 20, when a truce
halted the 8-year-old war.
   The U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observers Group, which is monitoring
the cease-fire, says in the report that in some places troops are
separated by just 30 feet of no man's land.
   Perez de Cuellar said he planned to discuss the prisoner-of-war
issue this morning with the president of the International
Committee of the Red Cross and expected to meet later today with
the delegations of both sides.
   A U.N. report estimates Iran and Iraq hold a combined total of
up to 105,000 prisoners of war, though the Red Cross has registered
just 50,182 in Iran and 19,284 in Iraq.
   So far, Iran has freed 790 prisoners and Iraq 638, according to
the Red Cross.
   On Sunday, Iraq freed 25 disabled Iranian prisoners and they
were flown to Tehran, the capital of Iran, aboard a plane chartered
by the Red Cross. Iran reciprocated immediately by releasing 25
Iraqi prisoners who boarded the same plane for the return flight to
Baghdad, Iraq, according to Francoise Derand, a spokesman at the
Red Cross office in Geneva.
   Iraq has agreed in principle to release all prisoners and says
their freedom should not have to be worked out in the peace talks.
But Iran has said the exchange must be based on the U.N. resolution
under which the cease-fire took hold and on a plan drafted by Perez
de Cuellar.
   That plan provides for a timetable for implementing all ten
points of the cease-fire resolution, ranging from the
prisoner-of-war exchange to assessment of damages and an inquiry
into who started the war.
   Perez de Cuellar said Sunday night that he hoped the Geneva
talks would be ``if possible much more useful'' than the previous
round held in New York early this month.
   Both Iran and Iraq have not budged on the principal issue
stalemating the talks since they began in Geneva on Aug. 25:
delineation of the border between the two nations.
   Iran says a 1975 treaty set the border in the middle of the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only navigable outlet to the sea.
Iraq repudiated the treaty in 1980 and demands sovereignty over the
entire waterway.
   Foreign Minister Tariz Aziz of Iraq, who heads his country's
delegation to the talks, told reporters at the airport on Sunday
that Iraq ``did not go to New York for substantial negotiations.
   ``Let us resume direct talks in Geneva where we can stay for a
while as long as the job needs,'' he said. ``Now we will negotiate
on this matter with the Iranians.''
   He said Iran, whose delegation is headed by Foreign Minister Ali
Akbar Velayati, is to blame that ``we are still on the same place
(in the peace talks) where we left in Geneva and in New York.''

   Iraq announced today it will release 25
Iranian prisoners of war in accordance with a U.N. cease-fire
resolution, the official Iraqi News Agency said.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted an unidentified
spokesman of the Iraqi Foreign Ministry as saying the unilateral
decision was relayed to the International Committee of the Red
Cross.
   The spokesman was quoted as saying the Red Cross was asked to
disptach a delegation to Iraq ``to take the neccessary measures to
repatriate the POWs.''
   On Thursday, Iran rejected an Iraqi plan for repatriating
prisoners of war from the eight-year Persian Gulf conflict and said
Iraq must accept the U.N. plan for ending the war before prisoner
exchanges could start.
   The Iraqi spokesman was quoted as saying with the latest batch,
the total number of sick and aging Iranian prisoners released by
Iraq ``for purely humanitarian reasons, with no political
conditions attached'' reached 645.
   He called on Iran to reciprocate, adding Iran ``would be held
fully responsible for any delay in ending the sufferings of the
POWs and their families,'' the news agency reported.
   He said Iran ``has all along dealt with the POWs issue as a
political one, in order to exploit it for the puposes of Iran's
expansionist policies.''
   According to the Red Cross, Iran has 50,182 prisoners and Iraq
has 19,284 prisoners. But U.N. officials and diplomats in Iran and
Iraq believe Iran holds 60,000 to 70,000 POWs and Iraq 30,000 to
50,000.
   U.N. Resolution 598 calls for an immediate cease-fire,
withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized boundaries and
the exchange of prisoners.
   Iraq this week proposed to the International Red Cross and U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that repatriation of
prisoners should begin on humanitarian grounds if Iran reciprocates.
   But Iraq also made it clear its offer was unrelated to peace
negotiations, which stalled five days after a cease-fire was
declared on Aug. 20.
   The peace talks have deadlocked over Iraq's insistence that the
disputed Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms its southern border
with Iran, should be cleared of silt and ships sunk early in the
war.
   Iran has rejected the dredging demand, saying it is a secondary
issue that can be settled later in the negotiations.

   Iran and Iraq held their second face-to-face peace
talks in 24 hours Wednesday, and the U.N. secretary-general said the
quickened pace showed a willingness by both sides to end their war.
   But statements from the Iranian and Iraqi foreign ministers made
clear there has been no narrowing of positions.
   Foreign ministers Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran and Tariq Aziz of
Iraq agreed Tuesday to meet face-to-face in all future sessions to
speed up the negotiations.
   The talks are aimed at consolidating a truce that went into
effect Aug. 20 after both sides accepted a U.N. Security Council
cease-fire resolution.
   Until now, the talks had been mostly conducted in an indirect
fashion, with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and his
mediating team shuttling between the two delegations seated in
separate rooms.
   Perez de Cuellar said the change was a ``very good sign.''
   Velayati and Aziz did not talk to reporters as they arrived for
the joint session at the European U.N. headquarters.
   Earlier, Aziz renewed Baghdad's call for an exchange of war
prisoners to proceed immediately.
   After meeting with the president of the International Committee
of the Red Cross, Cornelio Sommaruga, Aziz said the international
community should pressure Iran to agree to the prisoner exchange,
independent of what happens in the talks.
   Iran, through a delegation spokesman, reiterated its demand that
such an exchange should come in the framework of the talks.
Spokesman Morteza Sarmadi said priority should be given to
withdrawal of the forces to internationally recognized boundaries.
   Troops are only a few yards apart at some points.
   Definition of the common border is the main stumbling block in
the talks, which began Aug. 25.
   Iran and Iraq are pledged to begin repatriation of war prisoners
``without delay'' after cessation of hostilities. The International
Committee of the Red Cross oversees its implementation.
   In a note to both countries Oct. 4, the Red Cross asked Baghdad
and Tehran to facilitate an agreement on the exchange by providing
complete lists of the prisoners they hold and proceeding with
repatriation of the sick and wounded.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 Iraqi prisoners in Iran and
19,284 Iranians in Iraq. It estimates that the number of
unregistered prisoners is at least 20,000 to 30,000 in both Iran and
Iraq.
   A U.N. report compiled in July said the number of prisoners in
Iraq may be close to 35,000 and in Iraq up to 75,000.

   With the Iran-Iraq war apparently nearing
an end, tens of thousands of war prisoners now look ahead to
freedom _ most with joy, but some with dread.
   Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mohammad Larijani, has said a
prisoner exchange could start within three months after the
cease-fire that took effect Aug. 20.
   But Baghdad-based diplomats say repatriation could be delayed by
hard bargaining at Geneva peace talks and by the sheer immensity of
the task of registering all POWs and determining whether they want
to go home.
   ``It's going to be a very long process,'' said one European
diplomat, who like his colleagues, refused to be identified.
   The exact number of POWs is unclear.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross, which has agreed
to organize the exchange, registered 50,182 POWs held by Iran and
19,284 held by Iraq. Red Cross officials say they believe both
sides hold many prisoners who have not been registered.
   Diplomats in Baghdad estimate that Iran holds 60,000-70,000 POWs
and Iraq 30,000-50,000.
   Iran is also believed to hold 10,000 to 20,000 Egyptians
captured while working as mercenaries in the Iraqi army or while
working as fishermen for Kuwait, which Iran accuses of supporting
Iraq.
   Some prisoners have been held since Sept. 1980, when the war
began. But thousands of Iranians were reported captured in Iraqi
offensives in the final days of fighting before the truce began.
   The Iraqis apparently sought to seize as many Iranians as
possible as bargaining chips in the Geneva talks.
   Both sides have used POWs for propaganda purposes, apparently
violating Geneva conventions that forbid exposing POWs to ``public
curiosity.''
   Each day, Iran's state-run television, monitored in Cyprus,
shows Iraqi POWs in spotless fatigues singing the praises of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and denouncing President Saddam Hussein
of Iraq.
   Iraq, in turn, has taken reporters to POW camps and displayed
Iranian prisoners knitting portraits of Saddam and praising his
wisdom and fair treatment.
   For such prisoners, the prospect of returning to their families
will be balanced against fear of their own governments, who would
likely question them closely and for some time about the conditions
of their capture and imprisonment.
   ``People assuming they'll be instantly reunited with their kids
will be disappointed,'' the European diplomat said.
   Diplomats say many POWs may choose to stay with the country that
captured them rather than return to an uncertain fate. Red Cross
rules forbid the repatriation of prisoners against their will.
   Tehran newspaper said that at least 20,000 Iraqis have opted to
stay in Iran.
   But diplomats said that getting prisoners back is a relatively
low priority for Baghdad, which is more interested in assuring a
lasting peace and ending Iranian support for Kurdish rebels
fighting Iraq's government.
   ``The priority would be on more essential issues, such as the
establishment of ... a durable peace,'' another diplomat said.
   An early return of prisoners bearing tales of mistreatment could
damage the peace talks in Geneva unless both countries,
uncharacteristically, play down such reports.
   Diplomats said the prisoner exchange may be snarled not only by
arguments about those who choose to stay, but by uncertainty over
how many each side holds and by their fate.
   Iran halted Red Cross visits to its 15 known POW camps after Red
Cross officials in 1984 witnessed a prison riot in which guards
killed several POWs.
   The Iranians allowed the visits to resume in 1986, but the Red
Cross found that more than 7,300 previously listed prisoners had
disappeared off the rolls. Tehran said they had chosen to live in
Iran.
   The Red Cross itself suspended visits earlier this year because
it alleged it was unable to visit all prisoners.

   Iran said Sunday it is suspending
prisoner-of-war exchanges with Iraq until Baghdad sends back the
number of Iranian POWs it promised to return under an agreement with
Red Cross officials.
   The suspension of the Red Cross-sponsored repatriation of sick
and disabled prisoners from the Persian Gulf war was announced by
the official Islamic Republic News Agency. The report was monitored
in Nicosia.
   The International Committee for the Red Cross said Iran and Iraq
freed 71 disabled soldiers on Sunday _ 19 Iranians and 52 Iraqis _
in the third such exchange under the program this week.
   Iran has freed fewer prisoners than agreed, claiming that some
Iraqis sought asylum and others had recovered from their wounds and
no longer were eligible. In retaliation, Iraq has released fewer
Iranian POWs than promised.

   Many Iranian and Iraqi prisoners of war
fear persecution if they return home and some Iraqis may riot
against repatriation, say U.N. investigators who visited their
camps.
   Prisoner camps in Iran are ruled internally by zealous Iraqi
POWs who have switched their loyalty to Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini,
the U.N. experts said in a report scheduled for release Thursday.
The Associated Press saw a copy of the report Tuesday.
   ``In each camp we visited (in Iran), there were fanatical,
hysterical and sometimes violent demonstrations by the prisoners,
who were assembled inside, along the barbed wire fences,'' the
three U.N. experts reported.
   Iraqi prisoners shouted slogans denouncing Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein and the superpowers, and praised Islam and Khomeini,
the investigators said, and rallies were so fervid at the Arak and
Davoudieh camps that they could not enter safely.
   About half the prisoners participated in each case and clearly
were under the influence of 10-20 percent or the group, the report
said. The team visited the camps in late July and early August.
   Camp committees provide religious and political instruction and
persuasion under the name ``spiritual guidance,'' the experts said,
and ``to us, it is indistinguishable from mental pressure.''
   In the camps in Iran holding Iraqi prisoners, the team
concluded, ``There is a risk that riots may break out, for example
in the moment when transfer is to take place with a view to
registration and repatriation.''
   In the camps in Iraq, the Iranian POWs were more orderly and
Iraqi authorities maintained control, but many prisoners also
appeared hesitant about going home after the 8-year-old war.
   ``The majority, however, seemed inclined to return to Iran,
provided they were given effective gurantees that they would not be
subject to persecution on their return,'' the report said. ``In the
absence of such guarantees, however, their future looks gloomy.''
   Iran listed 46,098 POWs in its camps but many new prisoners had
not been registered so the U.N. team decided the number could be
about 70,000.
   Iraq furnished a list of 18,139 POWs as of Aug. 1, but Iraqi
authorities told the team many new prisoners had not been
registered. The investigators decided the total could be about
35,000.
   Conditions in the camps of both sides ``are, on the whole,
acceptable, although it might be desirable to have them further
improved on some points,'' the report said.
   Pro-Khomeini Iraqis dominating Iran's camps reject Western
institutions, including the International Committee of the Red
Cross, which registers prisoners of war and looks after their
welfare, the investigators said.
   Because they view the Red Cross as ineffective and dominated by
the West, many have refused to register with it, complicating the
repatriation process.
   The U.N. team also found, however, that some Iraqi POWs were
never given a chance by Iranian authorities to register with the
Red Cross or were dissuaded by the pro-Khomeini Iraqi prisoners.
   According to the report, Iranian authorities cooperated in
verifying the whereabouts of ``nearly all'' 7,327 Iraqi POWs
registered by the Red Cross before 1984 who were listed as missing,
showing them to be safe and alive in or out of POW camps.
   Iraqi authorities cooperated in tallying about 25,000 Iranian
Kurds, 30,000 Iranian Arabs, and more than 300 other Iranians
listed by Iran as missing.
   Iraq said they sought asylum and were in three refugee camps.
The U.N. team found the facilities similar to POW camps, surrounded
by barbed wire, but the residents had relative freedom of movement.
   More than 200 POWs held by Iran are from Syria, Lebanon, Egypt,
Sudan or Somalia, the team said. Iran has called them
``mercenaries'' but has promised to free them.
   Iran and Iraq have accused each other of the torture and
maltreatment of POWs.
   In Iran, the U.N. team said, ``We never saw any direct evidence
of atrocities, torture or beating; but from the conversations we
had with some prisoners we cannot dismiss allegations that such
acts have occurred.''
   In Iraq's Camp Number Nine in the Ramadi region, the team found
abuse that ``did not seem typical of Iraqi camps at large.''
   Members of the U.N. team were Maj. Gen. Rene Bats of Belgium;
Wolfram Karl, an Austrian professor of international law, and
Torkel Opsahl of Norway, also a professor of international law.
   They visited Iran's camps July 23-30 and the Iraqi camps July
31-Aug. 5.

   Iraq's Saddam Hussein, in a move that
could free military manpower and ease the stranglehold of economic
sanctions, offered Wednesday to make peace with his longtime enemy,
Iran.
   Iran greeted the proposal ``with optimism'' but said a thorough
study was needed. That country's Islamic Republic News Agency said
President Hashemi Rafsanjani and his Cabinet were meeting to
discuss the proposal.
   Iran and Iraq never formally settled their eight-year war,
although it ended with a cease-fire in August 1988.
   In his proposal, the Iraqi leader said he would pull troops out
of territories seized from Iran and free Iranian prisoners of war.
He also suggested he was relinquishing the Iraqi claim to full
control of the strategic Shatt-al-Arab waterway to the Persian Gulf.
   Those were major points of disagreement that stalled peace talks
almost from the time they began, five days after the 1988
cease-fire.
   In addition, Iraq allowed Iranians trapped by the invasion of
Kuwait to leave. Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said
the first of the estimated 100,000 Iranians in Kuwait arrived in
Iran on Wednesday.
   The Iraqi president outlined his peace proposal in a letter to
Rafsanjani. A broadcaster read it over Baghdad radio, which was
monitored in Nicosia.
   Saddam indirectly called for an alliance with Tehran against the
United States, saying the Persian Gulf should be ``a lake of peace
free of foreign fleets and forces that harbor ill intentions
against us.''
   The Iraqi president said he was ``looking forward to a new life
of cooperation on the principles of Islam and respect of each
other's rights.''
   Iran has denounced Iraq's Aug. 2 conquest of Kuwait, but it has
also criticized the buildup of thousands of Western troops in Saudi
Arabia to deter any Iraqi attack.
   Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reiterated
criticism Wednesday of ``any sort of aggression in the region'' and
said Iran considers ``the presence of American forces in Saudi
Arabia ... to the detriment of Islam and Moslems and against the
Islamic revolution.''
   His remarks were carried by the Islamic Republic News Agency,
monitored in Nicosia, before the Baghdad announcement.
   Iran's press trumpeted Saddam's proposals with large headlines,
but one newspaper cautioned that Iran should not become more
embroiled in the gulf conflict.
   ``Peace between two regional powers is certainly conducive to
peace, stability and security for the whole region,'' said the
English-language Tehran Times in an editorial made available in
advance of publication Thursday.
   But the paper, which often reflects Rafsanjani's thinking, said
Iran's leaders ``should not allow the country to get involved in a
crisis that might prove detrimental to our own national interest
and security.''
   Saddam said the troop withdrawal and the prisoner release would
start Friday. He did not specify the size of the territory from
which his troops would withdraw, and the number of Iraqi troops
involved was not known.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz sent a message to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar asking him to instruct
the head of the U.N. Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group to cooperate
with Iraqi authorities in the troop withdrawal, Iraqi national
radio said Wednesday.
   Iran claims Iraq holds 772 square miles of territory occupied in
the final weeks of the war. The United Nations says the area is
half that size.
   In any event, a peace treaty with Tehran would ease pressure on
Saddam to defend the 730-mile frontier with Iran, Iraq's longest
border.
   Saddam could also be hoping Tehran would break with the rest of
Iraq's neighbors and allow food and other goods to pass through
Iranian territory to Iraq.
   But Kamal Kharrazi, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations,
said Tehran remained opposed to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and
would continue to abide by U.N. economic sanctions.
   ``We cannot accept aggression against another Islamic country
and annexation of that country to another country,'' Kharrazi told
the BBC.
   ``The settlement of the dispute between Iran and Iraq does not
necessarily mean any sort of support or so-called help toward that
country. ... Certainly we have our principles and we are committed
to the resolutions adopted by the Security Council,'' he said.
   Even if Iran formally maintained an embargo, a relaxation of
military strength on the border would be a bonanza for smugglers.
   The Iraqi president said he wanted to settle the dispute over a
1975 treaty that divided the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, which forms
the gulf border between the nations.
   Saddam abrogated the treaty before invading Iran in September
1980 and had claimed full control of the Shatt al-Arab as one of
the main fruits of the war. It remains closed to shipping.
   Iran immediately interpreted Saddam's announcement Wednesday as
dropping the claim to the full waterway. Foreign Minister Ali Akbar
Velayati, speaking on Tehran Radio, called it ``the greatest
victory of the Islamic Republic of Iran in its history.''
   As for prisoners of war, the Red Cross has registered 50,000
prisoners held by Iran and 19,000 Iranians in Iraqi hands. But
United Nations and other officials have estimated the total number
at 100,000, some of them held since the early days of the war.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross headquarters in
Geneva said Iraq had asked it to handle the repatriation, beginning
with 2,000 Friday.

<HEAD>Iran Asks Return of 700 POWs; Calls Iraqi Proposal `Propaganda'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

   Iran on Monday said an Iraqi proposal to
exchange all prisoners of war is a propaganda ploy and insisted on
the return of more than 700 Iranians that Tehran says were captured
since an August truce.
   On March 5, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein proposed the exchange
of all 100,000 prisoners held by both sides outside the framework of
the peace talks, which have been deadlocked since they opened in
Geneva on Aug. 25.
   In a letter to the International Committee of the Red Cross,
released Monday at U.N. headquarters, Iran noted that it had
informed the Red Cross that Iraq seized over 700 Iranians, mostly
soldiers, in the first weeks after the truce in the Iran-Iraq war
began Aug. 20.
   The eight years of fighting came to an end after both sides
agreed to negotiations that use U.N. Resolution 598 as a blueprint
for a permanent peace settlement. Among other things, the resolution
calls for withdrawal of occupying forces and prisoner exchanges.
   Tehran said the detention of the Iranians violates the Third
Geneva Convention regulating the treatment of POWs, and it called on
the Red Cross to pressure Iraq to release them.
   ``It is worth noting that during the first round of negotiations
in Geneva for the implementation of Resolution 598, the foreign
minister of Iraq announced the said prisoners would be released
soon,'' Iran's letter said, referring to the U.N. Security Council's
peace plan.
   ``It is now clear that the Iraqi foreign minister's promise was
made only for propaganda purposes at the time, which, like all other
Iraqi statements of repatriation of prisoners of war are void of any
humanitarian substance,'' said the Iranian letter.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 prisoners held by Iran and
19,284 held by Iraq, but U.N. officials and diplomats estimate the
total number of POWs is about 100,000.
   An agreement to exchange sick and injured prisoners of war in
November broke down over mutual recriminations of bad faith,
including the numbers of prisoners requesting asylum on both sides.

   Putting aside their troubled relations with
Tehran, Britain, the United States and Israel joined nations around
the world in offering aid Friday to earthquake-devastated Iran.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, in a message to his Iranian
counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati, said: ``We are very saddened by the
terrible loss of life in yesterday's earthquake in Iran. ... The
government is keen to do what they can to help.''
   Britain and Iran severed diplomatic relations in March 1989
after the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered Moslems to kill
British author Salman Rushdie for his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   A member of the Iranian interests section that operates through
the Pakistan Embassy in London said the British offer was ``very
kind.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The United States also does not have diplomatic relations with
Iran, but the White House offered humanitarian assistance and sent
a message of condolence. The State Department said Iran indicated
it would welcome earthquake relief from the American Red Cross and
other U.S. humanitarian organizations.
   ``We want to be helpful without regard for our political
differences with Iran,'' said deputy spokesman Richard Boucher.
   Israel also offered assistance. ``Israel is very sorry for the
grave natural disaster in Iran and is prepared to give the Iranians
immediate aid as it has done for various other nations,'' said
Eliza Goren, the Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.
   Foreign Minister David Levy offered to help Iran search for
trapped quake survivors. The offer was made through the League of
the International Red Cross. Israel has had no diplomatic ties with
Iran since the Islamic revolution ousted the Shah in 1979.
   Iran reportedly said humanitarian aid would be welcomed from all
nations except South Africa and Israel.
   The family of one Westerner held hostage by pro-Iranian groups
joined in the outpouring of sympathy for Iran, which was hit by a
major earthquake Thursday that killed tens of thousands of people.
   The brother of one British hostage, Terry Waite, said he wrote
to the Iranian interests section to express ``my profound distress
and grief at the tremendous loss of life.''
   David Waite told The Associated Press he wrote ``that Terry is
someone who has great love for the Iranian people and that if he
should learn about it (the earthquake) he himself will be very
distressed.'' Terry Waite is the special envoy of Anglican Church
Archbishop Robert Runcie.
   A plane loaded with British relief supplies was scheduled to fly
to Tehran over the weekend, the government said.
   It would be joining planes, supplies and personnel rushing from
all over the world to aid the thousands of earthquake victims.
   A statement from the U.N. Disaster Relief Organization in Geneva
said the most immediate needs were medicine, medical supplies and
tents. Others include canned food, blankets, clothing, vehicles and
heavy-duty equipment.
   The organization was sending two senior officials to the
stricken areas, and a special task force was established at the
Iranian president's office to coordinate relief, the United Nations
said.
   The first team of French doctors arrived Thursday, only hours
after the quake, and opened a center to treat the wounded. The
French government promised to send a civil defense team of 195
people and 18 search dogs, along with 24 tons of equipment.
   In Geneva, the International Red Cross said radio reports
received from the Red Crescent of Iran indicated that at least
400,000 were homeless in northern Iran. Red Crescent is the Islamic
equivalent of the Red Cross.
   Paer Stenbaeck, secretary-general of the League of Red Cross and
Red Crescent Societies, said cash contributions were arriving in
response to an appeal to members around the world. Early donors
included the governments of Sweden, Finland and Japan, he said.
Many others followed.
   Stenbaeck said the Iranians, being used to earthquakes, had ``a
remarkably effective relief operation'' and did not need blood
plasma, satellite communications equipment, sniffer dogs, used
clothing, doctors, technicians or more relief workers.
   Three thousand trained rescue workers were already deployed in
the disaster area, and the Iranian Red Crescent had its own tent
factories, food processing plants and warehouses, he said.
   Iraq, which fought Iran in the 1980-88 Persian Gulf war, was
among the first Arab nations to send a note of condolence.
   ``We are ready to provide any assistance you may require,''
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said in a message to Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   The United Arab Emirates was the first Gulf state to send
supplies. The Soviet Union sent a rescue team.
   International Rescue Corp., a private British charity, sent a
17-member rescue team to Iran after receiving an Iranian request
for help, team coordinator Terry Price said. The team took portable
satellite communications equipment and instruments to detect
victims under rubble.
   Brian Ruberry, a spokesman for the American Red Cross in
Washington, said the organization was raising money rather than
shipping supplies, and had established a toll-free nationwide
telephone number for people wanting to make contributions.
   ``We're attempting to raise money to send to the Red Crescent
Society to help buy tents, blankets, food, medical supplies and
emergency lighting,'' he said.

   Eighty sick and wounded Iraqi prisoners of
war arrived home Tuesday after being freed by Iran, with some
falling to kiss the ground as they stepped off the plane.
   Also on Tuesday, a United Nations official said the first
U.N.-sponsored meeting between Iraqi and Iranian officers has been
postponed indefinitely. It had been scheduled for Wednesday.
   The 80 POWs are the first of 260 sick and wounded prisoners Iran
said it would free to mark the 10th anniversary of its revolution
earlier this month.
   Iraqi officials at Baghdad International Airport said the
Iranians informed the Red Cross they would repatriate 83 prisoners,
but later said three had asked for political asylum.
   A senior Iraqi officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the all-Swiss International Committee of the Red Cross had informed
them 16 of the 260 prisoners opted to stay in Iran.
   Military police kept reporters away from the POWs, who all wore
gray track suits. At least 10 were in wheelchairs or carried on
stretchers.
   Gini Antone, a doctor of the International Committee of the Red
Cross who accompanied them on the plane from Tehran, said the
prisoners were sick but there were no serious injuries.
   Antone said morale was high during the 2{-hour flight, with
prisoners looking forward to returning home.
   Iraqi medical staff at the airport said the POWs will be taken to
a military hospital for more tests and will stay as long as they
need treatment.
   Most returnees were taken prisoner in early days of the war,
which started in September 1980.
   A jet chartered by the Red Cross committee carried them home.
   The plane will return to Tehran to bring the second batch of
prisoners Wednesday and the final group should arrive Thursday, said
Arnold Luethold, deputy director of the Red Cross delegation in
Baghdad.
   A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire halted the war Aug. 20. But peace
negotiations have stalled and an agreement to exchange prisoners in
November collapsed over mutual recriminations of bad faith,
including the numbers requesting asylum on both sides.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 prisoners held by Iran and
19,284 Iranians in Iraqi hands, but U.N. officials estimate they
total 100,000.
   Further delays to the peace process were announced by a U.N.
official who said the two countries cannot agree on where their
Mixed Military Group should meet.
   They were to meet Wednesday along the road between the Iraqi town
of Khanaqin and the Iranian border town of Qasr-e-Shirin in the
central sector of the war front and cease-fire line.
   Officials refused to say which country expressed reservations on
the venue. U.N. officials are trying to negotiate a solution.
   The military officers were supposed to handle issues arising from
implementation of the cease-fire.

   More than 200 freed Iranian prisoners of war
arrived home from Iraq today in the first prisoner exchange by the
two countries in two months, the official media reported.
   The Islamic Repubic News Agency said the freed men kissed the
ground on arrival, crying for joy and chanting ``Allahu Akbar!'' or
God is great.
   Tehran radio said the 238 former POWs arrived at the capital's
Mehrabad Airport and were warmly greeted by military and political
figures.
   Some 79 Iraqis taken prisoner during the eight-year Iran-Iraq
war were also sent home by air in the first prisoner exchange in
two months, the official Islamic News agency said.
   The agency said the Iraqis had been convicted of crimes but were
later pardoned by Iran. It did not specify the nature of the
crimes.
   Another 200 Iraqis were scheduled to be repatriated Thursday.
   The exchanges started in mid-August after Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein abruptly agreed to all Iran's conditions for a formal peace
treaty, including the exchange of prisoners.
   He was apparently seeking peace on his eastern border while
trying to consolidate his hold over Kuwait. Iran has strongly
condemned the Aug. 2 invasion of the emirate.
   Iraq suspended the prisoner exchanges without explanation on
Sept. 20, after 37,000 men had been exchanged. The International
Committee of the Red Cross said 25,000 men still remain interned,
without giving a breakdown.
   But a visit by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati to
Baghdad last week, the highest official from Iran to visit Iraq
since the 1979 Islamic revolution, got the exchanges going again.
   Iraq said earlier that all the prisoners to be released today
were convicted of crimes such as murder and assault after they were
interned in camps during the 1980-1988 war.
   IRNA, in its report, said: ``A freed POW, while weeping
bitterly, said a great grief breaking their hearts was the passing
away of Imam Khomeini.''
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the personification of Iran's 1979
Islamic revolution, died in June 1989, almost a year after a
cease-fire in the Gulf War.

   Iraq joined Iran Tuesday in offering to begin
immediately the exchange of sick and wounded prisoners captured
during their 8-year-old war.
   But the foreign ministers of both countries made it clear after
another meeting with U.N. mediator Jan Eliasson that there was no
progress in efforts to consolidate the truce that took effect Aug.
20.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz told reporters after the
4{-hour meeting that the two sides discussed how to proceed with
implementation of the U.N. cease-fire resolution.
   He said discussions were continuing but indicated Iraq opposes a
four-point compromise proposed last month by U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Negotiations are stalled over border disputes.
   Perez de Cuellar's proposal seeks to gain a breakthrough by
linking a military disengagement and the exchange of prisoners to
Iranian assurances to cease searching ships for war-related cargo
for Iran and the dredging of the Shatt-al-Arab estuary. The
Shatt-al-Arab is Iraq's only waterway to the Persian Gulf.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran said after the joint
session that ``the main problem is that Iraq has not accepted the
four-point plan of the secretary-general.''
   He said that Iran, independent of the negotiations and on the
basis of an agreement with the International Committee of the Red
Cross, was ready to begin returning sick and wounded Iraqi prisoners
``tomorrow.''
   Aziz, speaking to reporters after a meeting with ICRC officials,
said the repatriation could begin with the 411 sick and wounded
Iranians held by Iraq and registered by the ICRC and 1,115
registered Iraqis held by Iran.
   ICRC spokeswoman Francoise Derron confirmed those numbers of
prisoners had been registered by the Red Cross but said ``since we
have not been able to visit all POWs we may assume there are more''
ill and injured prisoners.
   The ICRC has registered a total of 50,182 Iraqi prisoners in Iran
and 19,284 Iranians in Iraq. It has estimated that an additional
20,000-30,000 unregistered prisoners are held by each side.
   On Oct. 21 Iran said it would be willing to immediately
repatriate sick and and injured POWs ``on a reciprocal basis.''
Tuesday was the first time Iraq said publicly that it would do the
same.
   Ms. Derron said the ICRC would not make a statement on the
possible repatriation of POWs ``until an agreement is concrete. We
are not going to comment in the middle of negotiations.''
   Aziz said the repatriations should be started by each side at the
same time ``in accordance with a proportion to be agreed upon.''
   He said the repatriation should not be used by Iran ``as a
pretext to block the comprehensive exchange operation in accordance
with the Geneva Convention, as more than 100,000 POWs from both
sides still suffer from captivity.''

   Peace talks between Iran and Iraq recessed Friday
after seven direct sessions produced no tangible progress toward a
permanent peace agreement.
   But in separate negotiations with the International Committee of
the Red Cross both agreed to exchange by Dec. 31 all sick and
wounded prisoners captured during the 8-year-old war.
   Iraq and Iran agreed to resume the negotiations ``in the near
future,'' possibly in December or January, said U.N. mediator Jan
Eliasson.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has urged the two
governments to use the recess for ``deep reflection'' and to take
steps ``to move the peace process forward,'' Eliasson said after the
50-minute meeting.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran said the meetings
brought a ``better climate and we do hope that the next round will
achieve practical progress.''
   His Iraqi counterpart, Tariq Aziz, said Iraq ``will do its best
to make the next round fruitful. ''
   Contacts will continue with both sides to ensure ``careful
preparations so that the next round will provide us with results,''
Eliasson said.
   Iran and Iraq have reaffirmed their commitment to uphold the
cease-fire and to implement U.N. Resolution 598, which calls for a
comprehensive peace settlement, he said.
   Eliasson gave both sides credit for their ``positive cooperation
with the International Committee of the Red Cross'' in accepting a
Red Cross proposal to begin Nov. 20 with the exchange of 1,569 sick
and wounded prisoners.
   The Red Cross said both sides promised to provide lists of all
other disabled prisoners, who will be repatriated starting Dec. 5.
The program ``must be completed not later than Dec. 31,'' the Red
Cross said in a statement.
   But Eliasson told a news conference that the talks remain stuck
on the ``points of immediate concern,'' listing a provision to
withdraw forces to internationally recognized borders without delay.
   A U.N. report said at some border positions, troops are only
paces apart.
   President Ali Khamenei of Iran blamed the lack of an agreement on
Iraq's continued presence on Iranian soil.
   ``We regard the presence of Iraqi troops in our territory a sign
of war, and if the Iraqi leadership is serious in its quest for
peace, it must remove this sign from our territory,'' Khamenei said
Friday at Tehran University.
   He said no other moves in the negotiations could be accepted
until the troops are withdrawn. His remarks were carried on Tehran
Radio and monitored in Cyprus.
   Iraq has not denied an Iranian claim that Iraqi troops still hold
386 square miles of Iranian territory while no Iranian soldier has
remained on Iraqi soil.
   Iran insists that the withdrawal be based on a 1975 border treaty
which President Saddam Hussein of Iraq ripped up five days before
his divisions moved into Iran in 1980. Iraq says the treaty must be
renegotiated.
   Eliasson said the United Nations presented both sides with
``certain ideas'' regarding the issue but declined to say whether
these were based on the 1975 treaty.
   The atmosphere at the third round, which started Oct. 31, was
described by Eliasson as ``constructive and sober.'' But he made
clear that the climate remained chilly and that both sides generally
refused to speak to each other.
   ``There is a dialogue, one speaks in front of each other,'' he
said, adding that during coffee or tea breaks there are ``occasions
you could detect something that could also be called conversation.''

<HEAD>Iran Dismisses Iraq Plan for Talks as Iraq Displays Military Might</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Iran dismissed an Iraqi proposal for
reviving peace talks between the two countries as ``a new campaign
of public deception,'' Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
said Saturday.
   The dispatch, monitored in Cyprus, said Iraq's three-point plan
offered Friday only reworded previous Iraqi demands. Talks on a
permanent end to the eight-year conflict have been stalemated since
a cease-fire in August 1988.
   The announcement came as Iraq displayed new weaponry, including
Iraqi-built missiles, during its annual Army Day.
   Iran did not reject President Saddam Hussein's offer outright
but described it as ``a new campaign of public deception to
undermine (U.N. Security Council) Resolution 598,'' the cease-fire
resolution.
   ``In fact, Saddam reiterated Iraq's previous proposals that were
extraneous to the resolution, only giving them a new wrapping,'' it
said.
   Resolution 598, adopted in July 1987, calls for a cease-fire,
withdrawal of troops to pre-war borders, the repatriation of
prisoners of war, and settlement of the conflict through
negotiations.
   It noted that Saddam failed to address simultaneous withdrawals
of troops and repatriation of POWs, key Iranian demands for
progress in the talks.
   Iran claims Iraq holds 1,065 square miles of its territory. But
United Nations experts say the Iraqis occupy only 260 square miles.
   Both sides blame each other for the deadlock in negotiations.
The last session was held in April, and U.N. efforts to revive the
negotiations have foundered.
   Saddam proposed a direct dialogue between the Iranian and Iraqi
leaderships be held alternately in Baghdad and Tehran under U.N.
supervision.
   He suggested exchanging all ailing and disabled POWs and
prisoners who have been detained since the early days of the
conflict, which broke out in September 1980.
   His proposal called for opening offices for the two countries'
national airlines in the capitals and reviving air links, which
were cut shortly before the war began. It said this would provide
an atmopshere of peace that would help push efforts for a
settlement.
   The parade marking Iraq's Army Day underlined Saddam's policy of
building up Iraq's military capabilities until Tehran signs a peace
treaty to formally end the war.
   With both sides devastated by the war, most analysts do not
believe there is much likelihood the conflict will erupt again.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 prisoners held by Iran and
19,284 in Iraqi camps. But U.N. officials and diplomats say there
are at least 100,000 POWs.
   The Red Cross mediated an agreement to repatriate the ailing and
crippled POWs immediately after the cease-fire. But the accord
broke down after the release of only 400 prisoners with both sides
accusing each other of falsifying the number of captives who were
seeking asylum.
   The Red Cross estimates 1,000 ailing or disabled POWs are still
held by both sides.
   Iraq has demanded that a new border accord be worked out, giving
it total control of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway. It also has
insisted on an agreement for clearing the channel of debris.
   Under a 1975 accord, the border between the two countries ran
down the middle of Shatt-al-Arab, which is Iraq's main outlet to
the sea.

   The repatriation of more than 1,500

carrying 52 Iraqi prisoners of war left Tehran, Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the group, which included

Committee for the Red Cross officials finished medical examinations.
   It said 41 Iranian POWs were expected to arrive in the Iranian
capital later in the day. The Red Cross-chartered plane will shuttle
between Tehran and Baghdad for the next 10 days to repatriate up to
1,115 Iraqis and 411 Iranians, all sick or wounded, according to a

   The federal government plans to require
automakers to install rear-seat shoulder belts in all new cars
beginning with the 1990 model year.
   The announcement Wednesday by the Transportation Department came
just hours after a private research group, the Institute for Injury
Reduction, publicly criticized the department for not requiring
shoulder restraints in rear seats.
   Critics for several years have questioned the degree of safety
provided by belts that fit only across the lap. Most cars have this
kind of belt in the rear seat. Benjamin Kelley, president of the
Institute, said motorists are faced with ``a pick your poison
choice'' because in some types of accidents the lap belts provide
added protection, while in others they contribute to the severity of
injuries.

   President Reagan said he expected to
be criticized for killing a bill that would have tightened the
clamps on lobbying by ex-government officials, but he asserted the
legislation was ``fundamentally flawed.''
   In announcing Wednesday that he would exercise a pocket veto to
kill the Post-Employment Restrictions Act, Reagan said, ``I am well
aware that there will be criticism.''
   Several lawmakers closely involved in drafting the wide-ranging
ethics bill immediately denounced the president, and the head of
Common Cause said the decision sealed an ``anything goes'' standard
of ethics in the Reagan administration.

   The dismissal of a ``clergy malpractice''
suit brought by relatives of a man who committed suicide after
pastoral counseling is a deliverance from legal interference in
spiritual matters, church leaders said.
   The court ruled Wednesday that non-professional counselors have
no legal duty to refer a patient to a psychiatrist or take any other
steps to prevent suicide.
   ``Neither the Legislature nor the courts have ever imposed a
legal obligation on persons to take affirmative steps to prevent the
suicide of one who is not under the care of a physician in a
hospital,'' said the opinion by Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas.

   Iraqi prisoners of war recently freed by
Iran said today they were systematically tortured by Iranian
Revolutionary Guards, and some said they were punished for refusing
to defect or convert to Islam.
   About 30 of 72 ailing and wounded POWs released last week told a
news conference they were constantly under pressure to defect. The
press conference was organized by the Information Ministry.
   Christians among the released prisoners said their Shiite Moslem
captors tried to force them to convert to Islam. Some said they had
been in captivity for six years.
   ``When I told them I was a Christian, they asked me to convert
to Islam before they would give me any medical help,'' said Wa'd
Aziz Na'mou, who said he was captured in January 1987 in the
southern Shalamcheh sector after he was wounded in the eyes during
a major Iranian offensive against the port city of Basra.
   ``I refused and they left me without treatment. I lost both
eyes,'' said Na'mou, an agronomist who was serving as an enlisted
man.
   The Iraqis were the first prisoners released by Iran since an
Aug. 20 cease-fire in the 8-year-old Persian Gulf war. A full-scale
prisoner exchange, provided for under the United Nations-sponsored
cease-fire agreement, has been stalled because peace talks are
deadlocked.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross has registered
50,182 POWs held by Iran and 19,284 by Iraq.
   Diplomats in Baghdad and Tehran, however, believe that Iran
holds 60,000 to 70,000 prisoners and Iraq 30,000 to 50,000.
   The freed Iraqis showed reporters injuries and scars they said
they suffered at the hands of Iranian guards in POW camps.
   Ministry officials said all 72 men freed last week were disabled
soldiers handed over at the border.
   Na'mou said Christian prisoners were isolated from Iraqi Moslem
POWs by their guards, who considered them to be ``unclean.''
   ``Many of the Christian soldiers were forced to convert to Islam
under psychological pressure and torture,'' he said.
   There are an estimated 250,000 Christians among Iraq's 16
million Moslems.
   The former prisoners said that after the cease-fire was
announced, Iranian pressure on them to seek asylum in Iran
intensified.
   They did not disclose how many Iraqi POWs defected in captivity,
but they insisted that they underwent ``unprecedented pressure.''
   ``We refused and insisted that we had to go back to our
country,'' said Ali Hussein Salman, 26, who said he was captured in
the Tiab area east of the southern Iraqi city of Amara in 1982.
   Salman said he was beaten by guards the day that Iranian
pilgrims were killed in rioting in the holy city of Mecca in Saudi
Arabia.
   More than 400 people, 275 of them Iranians, were killed July 31,
1987 in the violence the Saudis said was instigated by militant
Iranian fundamentalists in defiance of a ban on political protests
during the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
   Salman said his Iranian guards at the Takhti POW camp near
Tehran injured his skull, paralyzing one side of his face and body.
   ``When the news broke that some Iranians had been killed in
Mecca, the guards went mad,'' he said. ``They started beating us at
random. They killed three prisoners and injured many others.''
   Other prisoners spoke of being left out in the snow at night as
punishment for refusing to shout slogans against President Saddam
Hussein and his Baath Arab Socialist Party.

   Freedom is closer than ever today for
tens of thousands of soldiers, some only boys, who were taken
prisoner in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war _ and they have another
Persian Gulf conflict to thank for it.
   Some have languished in prisoner-of-war camps since the early
days of the Iran-Iraq war that broke out in September 1980, even
though the fighting stopped two years ago.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, embroiled in a military
confrontation with the United States over his Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, declared Wednesday he will release all Iranian captives.
   Iraq today said it will free 1,000 Iranian prisoners a day,
starting Friday. The official Iraqi News Agency said Iraq had
wanted to repatriate 2,000 Iranian prisoners a day but the Red
Cross did not have the facilities to absorb such a large number of
POWs.
   The Swiss-based International Committee of the Red Cross said
today it has begun processing prisoners for the release and that
Iran said it was ready to accept them at the border.
   The number of releases would be the largest since a cease-fire
halted the fighting on Aug. 20, 1988.
   ``The POW situation cannot be overestimated politically,'' said
Philip Robbins, an analyst at London's Royal Institute for
International Affairs and a Mideast specialist.
   ``Getting these men back will have a big impact in Iraq,
particularly among the families who have been pressing for the
return of their people. It will certainly boost Saddam's position
internally.''
   Saddam's move was part of a package of Iraqi concessions that
dramatically enhanced the prospect of a peace treaty nearly two
years after the cease-fire.
   Saddam was apparently seeking to secure his long eastern border
with Iran while he faces the Americans and their allies mustering
in Saudi Arabia.
   Iran has been pressing for a complete exchange of prisoners,
albeit on its own terms, since the U.N.-sponsored truce took effect.
   It is now expected to agree to free Iraqi prisoners. However,
Red Cross spokeswoman Martine Haemmerli said the humanitarian
organization's Geneva headquarters was still waiting late Wednesday
for word from Tehran.
   The Red Cross, which will oversee the exchange, has registered
about 50,000 POWs held by Iran and more than 19,000 by Iraq.
   But it says it has not been allowed access to all prisoners.
U.N. officials and diplomats in Iran and Iraq have long maintained
that the total number of prisoners is more than 100,000 _ 60,000 to
70,000 in Iran and 30,000 to 50,000 in Iraq.
   If those figures are correct, the exchange will be the biggest
organized by the Red Cross since the Geneva Convention of 1949.
   Since the cease-fire, the POWs on both sides have been
bargaining chips in the peace talks that deadlocked almost as soon
as they began.
   The U.N. Security Council's cease-fire resolution stipulated
that all POWs be freed.
   But Iran refused to free its captives until Iraq withdrew from
Iranian territory captured in the final months of the war.
   Iraq refused to pull back until Iran acknowledged Iraq's
sovereignty over the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, the confluence of the
Euphrates and Tigris Rivers that forms the southern boundary
between the two countries.
   But in a letter to Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani,
broadcast Wednesday by the official Baghdad Radio, Saddam said he
will relinquish occupied territory and abide by a 1975 treaty
splitting control of the Shatt-al-Arab. He had long said that
treaty was invalid.
   Any prisoner exchange, however, is likely to be prolonged by
prisoners who resist repatriation.
   Both sides have accused the other of torturing and brainwashing
POWs.
   In addition, they have said thousands of POWs defected, often
soldiers who surrendered and feared retribution if they returned
home.
   A U.N. report in late 1988 said many Iranian and Iraqi prisoners
fear persecution if they go back and that Iraqi POWs could riot if
attempts were made to repatriate them.
   The problem over prisoners who do not want to be repatriated
will likely complicate and prolong the expected exchange operation.
   The situation is similar to problems encountered in arranging
the voluntary return of prisoners that prolonged the Korean War for
more than a year until April 1953.
   The Soviet Union held thousands of Germans after World War II
ended. The last 9,000 were not released until 1955 after Moscow and
Bonn agreed to restore diplomatic relations.

<HEAD>Saddam Offers Plan To Revive Talks With Iran, Warns Israel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein today proposed a
three-point plan for reviving stalled peace negotiations with Iran,
including direct meetings and an unconditional release of ailing
and disabled prisoners.
   Saddam also praised his country's advanced arms industry and
warned Israel against attacking Iraqi scientific or military
installations after the recent launch of long-range missiles and a
rocket reportedly capable of putting a satellite in space.
   The Iraqi president spoke in a 30-minute address aired live by
radio and television to mark the 69th anniversary of the creation
of the Iraqi Army.
   ``We are seeking to open a new door for a dignified peace with
Iran,'' he said.
   Fighting in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war was halted by a
cease-fire that went into effect Aug. 20, 1988. U.S. and European
military analysts have estimated that 1 million people were killed
and 1.7 million wounded, two-thirds of them Iranians.
   The war grew out of border skirmishes between Iran and Iraq
after the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini took power in Iran in
1979.
   But Iran and Iraq had been in dispute for years over the
120-mile Shatt-al-Arab waterway, the confluence of the Tigris and
Euphrates Rivers that flows into the Persian Gulf and forms the
southern boundary between the two countries.
   To revive the peace talks, Saddam suggested that ``direct
meetings between representatives of both leaderships be held
alternately in Tehran and Baghdad under the auspices of the
secretariat-general of the United nations.
   ``The direct dialogue will aim at reaching a common
understanding of the clauses of (U.N. Security Council) Resolution
598 and fix a timetable for its implementation ... provided that
the talks are completed within a period not exceeding three
months.''
   The Security Council adopted the resolution in July 1987. A year
later, both countries agreed to it and stopped the fighting. But
peace talks launched under U.N. sponsorship after the truce were
quickly deadlocked.
   Tehran refused to discuss a settlement before Iraq withdraw from
lands it occupied before the cease-fire, and Baghdad insisted on
working out a new border demarcation accord that gives it total
sovereignty over Shatt-Al-Arab waterway.
   Under a pre-war accord, the border between the two countries ran
down the middle of the waterway, which forms Iraq's sole outlet to
the gulf.
   Iran claims Iraq holds 1,065 square miles of its territory. But
U.N. experts say the Iraqis occupy only 260 square miles.
   As a second step toward renewing the peace talks, Saddam
proposed ``an immediate exchange of all wounded and sick prisoners
of war under the supervision of the International Committee of the
Red Cross.''
   That, he said, would be followed by the release of the
longest-held POWs, mainly those captured in the early stages of the
war, which broke out in September 1980.
   He also called for registering thousands of prisoners who have
not been included in lists provided to the Red Cross.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,182 prisoners held by Iran and
19,284 in Iraqi camps. But U.N. officials and diplomats say both
sides together hold at least 100,000 POWs.
   The Red Cross mediated an agreement to repatriate the ailing and
crippled POWs immediately after the cease-fire. But the accord
broke down after the release of only 400 prisoners with Iran and
Iraq accusing each other of falsifying the number of captives who
were seeking asylum.
   The Red Cross estimates 1,000 ailing or disabled POWs are still
held by both sides.

   Twenty sick or disabled Iranian soldiers
captured by Iraq in their eight-year war arrived in Tehran on
Thursday, a day after Iran repatriated 50 similar Iraqi prisoners,
Tehran radio reported.
   The prisoners were welcomed at Tehran's Mehrabad airport by
Mahmoud Aqamiri, an official in charge of Iraqi prisoners-of-war in
Iran.
   Aqamiri deplored the lopsided exchange, saying that ``the fact
that the Iraqi regime had released only 20 Iranian prisoners in
exchange for 50 released by us the previous day, limits the
possibility for other such exchanges,'' according to the broadcast,
monitored in Cyprus.
   Aqamiri said that 53 Iraqi prisoners had been freed by Tehran
Wednesday, but that three had requested asylum in Iran.
   The Iranians were flown to Iran aboard the same International
Red Cross-chartered plane that carried the Iraqis.
   An Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman said the release of the
Iranian prisoners was made ``in confirmation of Iraq's humanitarian
policy and its commitment to international conventions.''
   The Red Cross had mediated an agreement between Iran and Iraq to
repatriate the ailing and disabled POWs immediately after the
cease-fire, which took effect in August 1988.
   According to Red Cross estimates, more than 900 ailing and
disabled POWs remain held by both sides, with a total of 50,000
other prisoners held by Iran and 19,200 by Iraq.
   United Nations officials and diplomats put the total number of
POWs held by both sides at about 100,000.

   Iran and Iraq have halted a monthlong
prisoner of war exchange during which some 75,000 POWs were
repatriated, but both sides still hold many prisoners, a Red Cross
official said today.
   There was no explanation from either side. The prisoners had
been seized during the 1980-88 Persian Gulf war and their release
had been a sign of the warming relations between the two nations.
   An official of the International Committee of the Red Cross said
in a telephone interview from Geneva that it was not immediately
known how many prisoners had yet to be repatriated.
   But the Red Cross, which is coordinating the exchange, has
estimated that some 100,000 prisoners were held by both sides
before the exchange began.
   The move came as an Iranian delegation headed by Deputy Foreign
Minister Manouchehr Mottaki met in Baghdad with an Iraqi team led
by foreign undersecretary Wisam Al-Zahawi to discuss normalization
of ties between the former gulf war foes.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, reported Sunday that
repatriation of the prisoners, which began Aug. 17 after Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein gave in to Iranian territorial demands
over their shared border, was abruptly halted Sunday without any
explanation from Baghdad.
   Reports from Iraq confirmed that no Iraqi prisoners had been
repatriated since Sunday, either.
   The prisoners who still have to be exchanged are those whom the
Red Cross had been unable to register.
   Internationally isolated after his Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait,
Saddam last month made peace with Iran.
   He initiated the prisoner exchange, agreed to shared sovereignty
over the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway, which forms the southern border
between the two countries, and removed troops from Iranian
territory captured during the war.

   Iran's U.N. ambassador said Wednesday that
Iran has no objection to starting the process of sending home all
prisoners of war from the Persian Gulf conflict and hinted the sick
and injured might be freed first.
   Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati noted, however, that some technical
issues still must be resolved in the Iran-Iraq peace talks and
repatriation cannot be completed until they are settled.
   According to the Red Cross, Iran has 50,182 prisoners from the
8-year-old conflict and Iraq 19,284. But U.N. officials and
diplomats in Iran and Iraq believe Iran has 60,000 to 70,000
prisoners and Iraq 30,000 to 50,000.
   Mahallati was responding to a proposal Iraq sent to the
International Committee of the Red Cross and to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar this week saying
repatriation could begin on humanitarian grounds if Iran
reciprocated.
   Mahallati said medical examinations and registration of all
prisoners could go forward. He said Tehran encourages the Red Cross
to continue humanitarian exchanges, which in the past have sent
home sick and injured soldiers.
   ``On our part, we are ready to cooperate with the
secretary-general and the ICRC in order to do our best to
repatriate unfortunate POWs,'' he said.
   He said the Red Cross should encourage further exchanges of
``certain categories'' of prisoners.
   But he said technical issues must be agreed upon, such as the
numbers of prisoners to be released, their ranks, whether prisoners
who were detained the longest would be freed first, the pace of
releases, and other questions.
   He said these issues ``cannot be regarded outside Resolution
598,'' the U.N. peace plan that is the basis for the peace talks.
   Iraq, however, said the releases would be on a humanitarian
basis ``unrelated to the other issues referred to in Security
Council Resolution 598.''
   Resolution 598 called for an immediate cease-fire, withdrawal of
troops to internationally recognized boundries and exchange of
prisoners.
   A U.N.-mediated cease-fire began Aug. 20, but peace talks have
been deadlocked since just after they began Aug. 25.
   The talks stalled over Iraqi insistence the waterway forming
their southern border be cleared of silt and sunken ships.
   Iraq calls the passage the Shatt-al-Arab. To Iran it is the
Arvand River.
   Iran rejected the demand as a secondary issue that could be
settled later, and Mahallati made clear Wednesday that Tehran wants
withdrawal to the border to be the next step.
   Both sides have blamed each other for the stalemate in
negotiations, which Perez de Cuellar said he expects to resume next
week in Geneva.

   The Red Cross announced Saturday that Iraq
has agreed to free 50 disabled Iranian POWs, clearing the way for
the first prisoner exchange between the two countries in more than
a year.
   Peace talks between Iran and Iraq have been stalled almost since
they began in August 1988, and the deadlock has left an estimated
100,000 captives on both sides languishing in POW camps. Some have
been held since the early stages of the war, which began in
September 1980.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross said 50 Iranian
POWs will be released and returned to Iran after Iran returns 50
Iraqi prisoners to Baghdad.
   Iran's U.N. ambassador, Kamal Kharrazi, announced in New York
last week that Iran would release the ailing Iraqis.
   The Iraqi authorities have ``promised to reciprocate with the
release of an equal number'' of POWs, a Red Cross official said
Saturday.
   The Iraqis are scheduled to be set free Wednesday, said the
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They said a Swiss
airliner had been chartered to fly the Iraqis home.
   U.N. officials have registered 55,000 POWs held by Iran and
19,500 by Iraqi, but they believe the total held by both sides is
about 100,000. Both sides hold a total of about 1,000 ailing or
disabled prisoners.
   The 1948 Geneva Convention stipulates that all prisoners of war
should be released when hostilities cease.
   A cease-fire halted fighting between Iran and Iraq in August
1988, but the POWs have become pawns as both sides quarrel over
details of the U.N. resolution that cleared the way for the
cease-fire.
   In 1988, the two sides exchanged about 400 disabled and ailing
prisoners. The operation collapsed in November of that year as each
country accused the other of lying about the number of captives
they held.
   This month, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein offered to restart
the peace talks and said Iraq was ready to exchange all disabled
and sick prisoners as a first step toward a total prisoner exchange.
   Iran countered that it would not agree to total swap, or to
implement other clauses of the cease-fire resolution, until Iraq
withdrew from Iranian border areas captured during the final days
of fighting.
   But Iranian officials have expressed support for a Soviet offer
to mediate a new round of peace talks.
   The Soviets have close links with Iraq and were its main arms
supplier during the war. Relations between Moscow and Tehran have
improved considerably since the war ended.
   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said Tehran would
consider any Soviet proposal ``containing a systematic and clearly
defined formula for the implementation of U.N. Security Council
Resolution 598,'' the cease-fire resolution.
   The Iraqi foreign ministry also welcomed the Soviet offer.

   Iran released 50 ailing or disabled Iraqi
prisoners of war Monday to Red Cross representatives as a gesture
of good will, Tehran radio reported.
   It was not clear whether Iraq would reciprocate and release some
of the Iranian POWs it holds. An earlier attempt to arrange a
formal swap collapsed.
   The radio said the prisoners were released in Tehran to the Red
Cross for eventual repatriation.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Cyprus, quoted a Foreign Ministry
statement as saying the 50 were freed on humanitarian grounds and
in response to a request by U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
   It did not say when Perez de Cuellar made the appeal. But
Baghdad last week sent a memorandum to the U.N. chief expressing
concern over POWs in Iran after a Red Cross report on Dec. 6 that
22 Iraqis have died in jail.
   The deaths were attributed to ``heart attacks and relevant
diseases,'' but Iraqi media suggested the prisoners might have been
tortured to death.
   The Red Cross has registered 50,000 prisoners held by Iran and
more than 19,200 in Iraqi camps. United Nations officials and
diplomats estimate the two sides hold about 100,000 POWs between
them.
   The Red Cross secured an agreement to repatriate ailing
prisoners immediately after a U.N.-cease-fire halted the war on
Aug.20, 1988. The deal collapsed after the repatriation of only 400
disabled and wounded prisoners, with both sides accusing each other
of falsifying the number of captives seeking asylum.
   Angelo Gnadinger, Middle East chief for the Red Cross, visited
Tehran and Baghdad last week seeking a swap of the remaining 1,000
wounded and disabled POWs held by both sides.
   The mediation collapsed, mainly because Tehran insisted the
exchange be coupled with a withdrawalof Iraqi forces from chunks of
land they occupied in the final weeks of the war.
   U.N.-sponsored peace talks have been deadlocked mainly over the
troop withdrawal issue and Iraq's demand for redrawing the border
to give it full sovereignty over the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway.
   The channel, a confluence of the great Tigris and Euphrates
rivers, is Iraq's sole outlet to the Persian Gulf. Before the war,
the border ran down the middle of Shatt-Al-Arab.

   Iraq has agreed to the exchange of
prisoners of war taken in the Persian Gulf war, but maintains the
move is not related to its peace talks with Iran, according to a
document released today.
   Ismat Kittani, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, said in
a letter to Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar that Iraq
will begin the POW exchange if Iran reciprocates.
   In the Iraqi letter to Perez de Cuellar, dated Monday, Kittani
separated the move to release prisoners from the talks over
Security Council Resolution 598, the U.N. peace plan to end the
8-year war.
   ``Since the exchange of prisoners is a humanitarian matter'' in
response to a Red Cross request, ``our agreement on this step is
unrelated to the other issues referred to in'' the U.N. plan.
   Security Council Resolution 598 called for an immediate
cease-fire, withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized
boundries and the exchange of prisoners.
   The two nations accepted a U.N.-mediated cease-fire that began
Aug. 20, but peace talks have been deadlocked since just after they
began Aug. 25.
   Kittani's letter said Iraq has asked the International Committee
of the Red Cross to begin registering all prisoners of war who are
not yet on official POW lists, and asked for detailed medical
examinations of all POWs in Iran and Iraq.
   Each nation is to receive a copy of each POW's medical report
before their exchange, Kittani said.
   According to the Red Cross, Iran has 50,182 prisoners and Iraq
19,284 prisoners. But U.N. officials and diplomats in Iran and Iraq
believe Iran has 60,000-70,000 prisoners and Iraq 30,000-50,000
prisoners.
   In Baghdad, Iraq, a senior Iraqi official today rejected a
condition offered by Iran for a permanent settlement of the war.
   Foreign Undersecretary Nizzar Hamdoun said Iran was setting
unacceptable conditions by insisting that both countries maintain a
1975 treaty setting the border in the middle of the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway.
   Iraq said the treaty, which draws the border in the middle of
the waterway instead of along the Iranian shoreline, is no longer
valid.
   ``The Iranian position... is an attempt to pressurize Iraq to
relinquish its political and legal rights while the two sides are
discussing purely technical issues,'' Hamdoun said.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali-Akbar Velayati, said Monday that
Iran agreed to the U.N. peace plan but only on condition that the
1975 treaty is upheld.
   Peace talks stalled over Iraq's insistance the waterway be
cleared of silt and ships that were sunk early in the war. Iran had
rejected the demand saying it was a secondary issue that could be
settled later.
   Both sides have blamed each other for the stalemate in
negotiations, which resume next week in Geneva.
