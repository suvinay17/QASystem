   New York -- Are you weary of the art scene? Have the
staggering prices, the unrelenting hype, the mobbed
blockbusters made you want to call it a day and take a
vacation from art? Cheer up: There are two refreshingly quiet
exhibitions in New York that offer oases from all that.
   Uptown at the Metropolitan Museum you will find "Master
Drawings From the Ian Woodner Family Collection," a rich
sampling from what probably is the most distinguished private
collection of drawings in the U.S. And in midtown, at the
Pierpont Morgan Library, you will find "The Golden Age of
Dutch Manuscript Painting," an exhibition of illuminated
manuscripts from the late 14th through early 16th centuries.

   While both exhibitions are connoisseurs' delights -- full
of rarities and scholarly puzzles -- they also contain
several surpassingly beautiful works of art accessible to us
all. What's more, both shows are installed in an elegant,
even an understated way, and they seem to have been spared
the huge crowds that make it impossible to savor many popular
museum exhibitions these days.
   Ian Woodner, a real estate developer, architect and
amateur painter, began collecting drawings in the 1950s. The
150 drawings on view at the Met represent about one-sixth of
his collection. Mr. Woodner selected the works for this
exhibition himself. He also commissioned the handsome
scholarly catalog that accompanies it and that provides a
useful thumbnail history of collecting drawings in the U.S.
from colonial times to the present.
   The Woodner drawings span more than six centuries, from
the 14th-century Florentine studies of St. Francis kneeling
to several drawings by such 20th-century masters as Braque,
Matisse and Picasso. Arranged chronologically within school
(Italian, French, German and so on), the exhibition includes
stunning examples of the draftsman's art in metal point,
chalk, pen and ink, charcoal, watercolor and other media.
There are works by Correggio, Botticelli, Cellini, Durer,
Goya, Hans Holbein (father and son), as well as Ingres,
Claude Lorrain, Raphael, Rembrandt, Seurat and Watteau.
Altogether there are drawings by some 50 artists.
   Until fairly recently, drawings were mostly made and
appreciated as preliminary studies, acts of imitation, or as
efforts to solve particular pictorial problems, not as
independent works of art. Thus while several of the items on
view here are highly finished -- Durer's and his contemporary
Hans Hoffmann's painstaking studies of animals, for example,
or Ingres's portrait of Mademoiselle de Borderieux -- many
are to varying degrees rough-hewn, sketchy and seem
spontaneously personal. The very unfinished quality of many
drawings gives them an air of intimacy and immediateness that
the more polished works they presage often lack.
   Mr. Woodner surely is correct in thinking that the drawing
of a satyr by Cellini (a pen-and-ink study for a relief
sculpture that was never executed) and the page from the
Renaissance biographer and painter Giorgio Vasari's book of
drawings are among the highlights of the show. The large page
from Vasari's book -- which he assembled to accompany his
famous "Lives of the Artists" -- contains 10 separate
drawings on its two sides, nine by Filippino Lippi and one by
Botticelli.
   Vasari added decorations to frame the drawings and help
harmonize the images on the page. Pages from Vasari's book
naturally have a special attraction for collectors of
drawings since Vasari was himself the first great collector
of drawings. Unfortunately, very few pages have survived. Mr.
Woodner acquired this one from the Duke of Devonshire in
1984, outbidding the Getty Museum for it.
   There are many other marvelous things in the show: an
exceptionally beautiful head of John the Baptist by the
15th-century Florentine artist Andrea del Sarto, "Christ on
the Road to Emmaus" by Claude Lorrain, a revealing
self-portrait by Degas, an extraordinary late watercolor by
Cezanne.
   The exhibition wavers most as it enters the 20th century.
In particular, Mr. Woodner's passion for Odilon Redon --
there are five drawings by the French surrealist included --
will strike many viewers as excessive, but then Mr. Woodner's
affection for Redon's drawings knows no bounds: He is perhaps
the world's leading collector.
   The Woodner drawings span continents and several
centuries. The exhibition of Dutch illuminated manuscripts at
the Morgan Library is a much more narrowly focused event,
dealing with a single highly specialized art form whose Dutch
incarnation flourished in the 15th century in Utrecht, Delft
and a few other cities in the northern Netherlands.
   Co-organized by the Morgan Library and the Rijksmuseum Het
Catharijneconvent in Utrecht, the exhibition draws on more
than 50 collections and contains some 100 items. Among the
many jewels on view are pages from a Book of Hours done
around 1440 by artists known as the Masters of the Delft
Grisailles. Produced rapidly and in comparatively large
numbers, the grisailles illustrations are simpler and less
luxurious than the best known illuminations of the time. But
their very leanness and sparsely applied gold leaf and color
imbue them with a haunting nimbus of distilled spirituality.
   The centerpiece of the exhibition is the Morgan's own Book
of Hours for Catherine of Cleves, which also was produced in
the 1440s and that generally is regarded as the summit of
Dutch illuminated manuscript artistry. Of the 168
illustrations originally in the book, 157 survive. Painted
with exquisite grace and delicacy, many of the Cleves
illustrations feature an abundance of homey details that give
us a glimpse into the daily life of the times. And the
phantasmagoric picture called "The Mouth of Hell" achieves a
level of surreal fantasy that, as James H. Marrow notes in
his excellent introduction to the catalog, looks forward to
the febrile productions of Hieronymus Bosch.
   As with all the illuminated manuscripts in the exhibition,
the artist of the Cleves Hours is anonymous. What has come
down to us about these artists are a few details about their
commissions, some idea of when and where they were active,
and the extraordinary names by which they are known to
posterity: Master of the Feathery Clouds, Master of the
Playing Cards, Masters of the Suffrages, Masters of the Dark
Eyes.
   There is something peaceful and serene about an exhibition
of illuminated manuscripts, though the subjects depicted
often are anything but placid. There are scenes of hell and
crucifixion and martyrdom aplenty. Moreover, the actual
history of some of these manuscripts is full of intrigue and
perhaps even murder.
   It is said, for example, that a miniature illuminated
prayer book was the death of John of Bavaria. After the death
of William VI in 1417, John had beat out his cousin
Jacqueline to become Count of Holland, Zeeland and Hainaut.
When, in 1424, he died from the effects of poison, Jacqueline
was suspected to have played a part in his demise. In a twist
that might have come from "The Name of the Rose," John was
poisoned not by food or drink but -- according to one
contemporary -- by "venom" smeared "onto my Lord's book,
which was about as large as a nut." It is not clear whether
the book in question is on view at the Morgan. The exhibition
of drawings from the Woodner collection is on view through
May 13. "The Golden Age of Dutch Manuscript Painting" closes
May 6.

<LEADPARA>  Two researchers say they have uncovered documents that will end the
controversy over the identity of the model who posed for Leonardo da Vinci's
Mona Lisa.;    U.S. art historian Janice Shell said she and Italian archivist
Grazioso Sironi came upon 16th-century legal documents indicating the model
was Lisa, the wife of a Florentine merchant.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Lisa was named as the model for the painting not long after the artist's
death in Giorgio Vasari's "Lives of the Artists," published in the 1540s.;
But over the years other theories were put forth, including one that the model
was a mistress of Giuliano de Medici. This theory was based on a description
of a portrait shown to the Cardinal of Aragon by Leonardo in 1517.;    The
documents found in the state archives of Milan outline the division of the
estate of Sarai, one of Leonardo's apprentices. Among the property were three
paintings by Leonardo, including "La Gioconda," as the Mona Lisa is known in
Italy.;    If Sarai's estate included the famed portrait in 1525, this would
make it likely that the Cardinal of Aragon was shown a different painting by
Leonardo, not the Mona Lisa, Shell said.;    These documents are "what I would
consider as good proof as one could ever have" to confirm Vasari's version,
Shell said.;    Others have asserted that the model for the Mona Lisa was a
transvestite, or that it was in fact a disguised portrait of Leonardo
himself.;    Shell's findings were published this month in the British art
monthly Burlington Magazine.  </TEXT>

FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: Light enough to take to bed - Art books need not break
either your arm or your bank balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At Christmas, we do things that we never - well hardly ever - do during the
rest of the year, such as giving each other lavish art-books. Here are my
recommendations of recent ones which I have found stimulating and readable,
on subjects ranging from felines in Ancient Egypt to the intimacy of Jasper
Johns and Robert Rauschenburg.
In the case of art-books, readability is in large part a function of size.
My own limit for comfortable reading in bed is two kilos, which is still
considerably too heavy for reading on a plane. Publishers should think
harder about the trade-off between glamour and portability. A book like
Jeffrey Ruda's pleasantly written monograph on Filippo Lippi (Phaidon;
Pounds 95.00, 560pp) is arm-breakingly beautiful at over three kilos. The
fault is not the writer's prolixity, but the flashy and wasteful design.
At the opposite extreme, modest yet good art-books can cost as little as a
tenner. Thames and Hudson's venerable World of Art paperback series costs
only Pounds 6.95 as does its wallet-sized New Horizons series, which has
serious texts and masses of remarkably good and often unusual images. Van
Gogh, Rembrandt, The Aztecs and others would make ideal stocking-fillers.
So, too, would the British Museum Press's attractive series on Medieval
Craftsmen and Eastern Art (Pounds 6.95 and Pounds 9.95).
Sharon Fermor's Piero di Cosimo; Fiction, Invention and 'Fantasia' (Reaktion
Books 226pp, Pounds 29) is lucid and absorbing, a book for anyone who wants
to understand better the nature of the Renaissance in Florence. Piero,
painter of the famous 'Forest Fire' in Oxford, was found dead at the foot of
a staircase in 1521. In all the books he is characterised as an odd-ball, an
interpretation which rests wholly on Vasari's biography.
The wild garden had yet to be invented in Renaissance Florence, yet here was
a man who never pruned or hoed, but just let everything grow wild. He lived
off hard-boiled eggs, cooking (but not eating) 50 at a time. Piero di
Cosimo, as vividly presented by Vasari, was as anti-social and bestiale as
Leonardo da Vinci was courtly and refined.
These days, art-historians are disinclined to take Vasari literally, and
Fermor shows that his life of Piero was written as a cautionary tale. Vasari
granted that the misanthrope had great gifts, particularly imagination, or
fantasia, in which respect he was like Leonardo who could also see pictures
in gobs of spit on a wall. But Piero's relative failure spelled a moral dear
to Vasari's heart; artists who wanted to get on had to be urbane and
sociable.
Fermor sheds light on the meaning of many of Piero's paintings, attractively
reproduced. The bare-breasted portrait said to be Simonetta Vespucci is, in
fact, a highly erotic Cleopatra. The National Gallery's much-discussed scene
is firmly identified as 'The Death of Procris' (below), painted according to
a contemporary play. Procris was accidentally slain as a result of her
sexual jealousy. Piero's version is dreamy rather than tragic, because in
the play Procris is restored to life. Fermor thinks that this edifying tale
was just the sort of thing a Florentine would have wanted in the nuptial
chamber.
Another enjoyable monograph is Judith Leyster; A Dutch Master and Her World,
by James Welu and Pieter Biesboer (Yale; 391pp, Pounds 45). This year marked
the centenary of the rediscovery of Leyster (1609-60), the Haarlem genre
painter who is the second most famous female Old Master after Artemisia
Gentileschi. Yet Leyster's success as an independent artist is in a sense
more remarkable because she was not the daughter of an artist. The book,
which is in fact an exhibition catalogue, presents a well-written and
stimulating picture of Leyster's place among artists of the Dutch Golden
Age.
John Gage's Colour and Culture; Practice and Meaning from Antiquity to
Abstraction (Thames and Hudson; 335pp; Pounds 38.00) is a remarkable
achievement. It would appeal inter alia to scientists, gardeners,
psychologists and designers. Gage explores the vast, limitlessly fascinating
subject of Western man's attempts to grasp the elusive nature of colour.
Beautifully illustrated and massively learned, this weighty book requires
concentration but the effort is amply rewarded.
I second my colleague Colin Amery's praise for Timothy Mowl's Elizabethan
and Jacobean Style (Phaidon; 240pp; Pounds 29.95), a fizzing polemic which
sees Inigo Jones as tantamount to a national disaster. For just the one
chapter on how Great Halls of houses like Hardwick were used as theatres,
this book would justify its cost. More temperate appreciation of English
style comes in Charles Saumarez Smith's Eighteenth-century Decoration
(Weidenfeld and Nicolson; 406pp; Pounds 50), a splendid guide to the look of
homes from cottages to castles.
Another book I will often be turning to over the years is Nicholas Penny's
The Materials of Sculpture (Yale; 318pp; Pounds 35.00). Looking at sculpture
and carved ornament, how well do we appreciate the challenges which the
materials posed their makers? Penny picks and chooses from the art of East
and West, helped with sumptuous illustrations. He writes with exemplary
clarity.
Lastly, two highly readable books on over-worked subjects, cats and love.
The world is crawling with cat-lovers whose horizons will surely be expanded
by Jaromir Malek's fascinating book, The Cat in Ancient Egypt (British
Museum Press; 144pp; Pounds 14.95). This is a lovely book, written so simply
that a child could follow it. As for the passion of Jasper and Robert, it
and other literary and artistic pairings such as Bell and Grant, Jackson and
Krasner, are chewed over in Significant Others; Creativity and Intimate
Partnerships edited by Whitney Chadwick (Thames and Hudson, 256pp; Pounds
14.95).

FT  07 MAY 93 / Arts: Old Masters in Oxford - Patricia Morison visits Christ
Church picture gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1765, General John Guise, redoubtable soldier and lover of art, gave his
extremely fine collection of Italian paintings and drawings to his old
college, Christ Church. Never had, nor has, an Oxford college received such
a bequest. It includes a wonderful 'Virgin and Child with Three Angels' by
an artist very close to Piero della Francesca; Hugo Van der Goes's
'Lamentation', which is all the more moving for being but a fragment;
Annibale Carracci's 'Butcher Shop'; Tintoretto's 'Martyrdom of St Lawrence';
and Van Dyck's powerfully arresting oil sketch, the 'Soldier on Horseback'.
The list of Old Master paintings could be far longer. And then there is the
world-famous Christ Church collection of drawings, selections from which are
displayed throughout the year.
In the early summer, two modest exhibitions examine certain puzzles arising
from General Guise's benefaction. Carlo Ridolfi, Collector and Art Historian
(until July 6) is a footnote show about a figure much honoured among
students of the Italian Renaissance. A professional painter and scholar,
Ridolfi (1594-1658) stands to Venetian historiography as Vasari does to
Florence. Like Vasari, he was not much of a painter - or so it is said.
(When next in Venice, I mean to track down what is supposedly his best work
in San Giovanni Elemosinario.) As for seeing how he measured up to Vasari as
a historian, the problem is that there is no modern edition, let alone
translation, of Ridolfi. And yet, his Life of Tintoretto and Le Meraviglie
dell'arte are key works, written out of patriotic indignation that Vasari
had been so pro-Florentine and showed so little appreciation of the
'marvels' achieved by Venetian artists.
One of General Guise's coups was to buy Ridolfi's collection of drawings, or
at least a sizeable chunk of it. Scholars are now satisfied that the general
really did secure this collection and was not, as had been suggested,
tricked by an elaborate forger. The cloud of doubt arises from the fact that
the bound volumes which Ridolfi made were dismembered by some dim college
Librarian in the last century.
That said, with some exceptions the drawings we see in the exhibition are
not particularly remarkable. The reason for showing them is that they are
marked 'R' in Ridolfi's hand, or with a different 'R' added in the 18th
century. Many great drawings in the collection may actually have been
Ridolfi's but are unmarked. However, 'The Archer' is both a fascinating and
exceedingly rare work. It was made with the point of a brush by a late
14th-century artist now identified as French, the Master of the Parement of
Narbonne. There is also a small Leonardo study of a sleeve bound with
fluttering ribbon, and a tiny sketch of figures for the background in
Carpaccio's St Ursula cycle.
The second Christ Church show (until June 15) focuses on a Titian which is
not normally on view, 'The Adoration of the Shepherds'. Dark and damaged
though the picture is, it repays a long look. Titian's composition conveys
the quality of worshipful repose normal in a Nativity, and yet he also
included the energetic figure of a shepherd tugging at his donkey. Another
shepherd doffs his hat as he kneels, and two boys hang over the back wall of
the stable, peering by the light of their candle at the holy infant.
Again, General Guise had invested in a good provenance. The picture had been
in Charles I's celebrated collection, he having bought it from the duke of
Mantua. The Oxford painting has hitherto been described as a version of the
'Adoration' which was commissioned from Titian by the Duke of Urbino,
brother-in-law to the Duke of Mantua. This picture, now in the Pitti Palace,
is a wreck. However, the exhibition makes the suggestion that the Christ
Church picture is the original and that the Pitti Palace is the later one.
Recent X-ray examination of the Oxford picture has revealed paint applied
with a Titianesque bravura which could make the picture 'of great interest'
if it were cleaned.
And there the matter is likely to rest. These are lean times for Oxford
colleges. Christ Church already faces a pressing question over the
deteriorating condition of its superb Van Dyck, 'The Continence of Scipio':
the bill for conservation is estimated at around Pounds 20,000. These are
considerations to be borne in mind, while the public still continues to
enjoy access to this remarkable private collection.
Christ Church Picture Gallery is open Monday-Saturday 10.30-1.00 and
2.00-5.30; closed Sunday morning. Guided tours, Thursday at 2.15

FT  05 JUN 93 / Arts: Leonardo falls flat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST. GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MUSICAL about Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) promises painting by numbers,
but threatens to put the great draftsman in the singing and daubing Rolf
Harris mould. Now at the Strand Theatre, 'Leonardo The Musical: a Portrait
of Love' has arrived, lamentably reworked from its opening at the Old Fire
Station in Oxford last November. This musical is less exciting than watching
Leonardo's paint dry - the show lacks passion, the songs want subtlety and
the issues beg credibility.
The story fixes on the relationship between Leonardo and the Milanese
Francesco Melzi, 'a very handsome boy and much beloved by him,' according to
Giorgio Vasari the art historian. When the Florentine Francesco del Giocondo
commissions a portrait of his wife, Mona Lisa, Leonardo falls in love and
fathers her child. Lisa marries Giocondo in haste, Leonardo repents at
leisure, and Melzi pines like a lost courtier in the blue distance of a
Renaissance fresco. This amounts to 'The Patron, the Wife, her Painter and
his Friend.'
'Leonardo' is a wonderful idea gone astray. The ultimate Renaissance man,
all the unfinished work in Florence and Milan, 'that' painting with her
smile. But a glance at the period shows a fine opportunity squandered.
Leonardo was a contemporary of Il Perugino in Umbria, of Raphael and
Michelangelo at Rome, Bramante in Milan, of Andrea del Sarto and Bartolommeo
in Florence, and of the Bellini family in Venice. He met Machiavelli at
Cesare Borgia's court in 1502. Not one appears in the plot. It has been
written as if the Renaissance was not happening. The plot fails to excite on
its own terms. Leonardo's love of Lisa and his love of painting sit uneasily
together. He did actually have music playing while she posed sometime
between 1500 and 1504. But neither songs nor action dramatise the creative
process or the relations between the principals. The lyrics beggar belief:
'She's a flower on the tree, the very heart and soul of me', Leonardo sings.
The dialogue is a close second; 'My late 'usband, Gawd rest 'is soul' chirps
a cockney Landlady.
Rolf Harris aside, the other antipodean connection is the show's finance
from the people of the guano and phosphate rich South Pacific island of
Nauru. Only the United Arab Emirates has a higher per capita income, and the
island's 8,000 inhabitants are celebrating 25 years of independence. Now
there is an interesting musical waiting within their own eight square miles,
a tale of Australian exploitation, phosphate fortunes, and coral island
romance.

THE GETTY GETS IT RIGHT;
</P>
<P>
PERHAPS MONEY CAN BUY ARTISTIC HAPPINESS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sir Kenneth Clark came to the Wild West in 1978 to lecture at the Getty Museum
which was just getting started as the world's richest art repository. In those
days he was a rare combination of authentically brilliant art historian and --
because of his television series "Civilisation" -- a cultural celebrity.
</P>
<P>
Kindly and tactful, he praised the progress made by the Getty's antiquities
department but when an interviewer solicited his opinion of the painting
collection he demured diplomatically. The question was about to pass when he
murmured, as if to himself, "Funny how they never get the pictures galleries
right . . . "
</P>
<P>
He died in 1983 so we'll never know how he would feel now. Probably he'd revise
his estimate, if not change it. The Getty has made brave strides since the days
when it's hottest paintings were a Rubens of questioned authenticity and a
campy-erotic academic Bougereau of a girl flirtatiously defending herself
against Cupid.
</P>
<P>
Poor old museum. All the money in the world to buy the best paintings in the
universe at a time when most masterpieces are eternally frozen in the corridors
of Louvres, Uffizis and National Galleries. Sigh. If this were the Renaissance
the Getty's director, John Walsh, could just hire himself a condottiere and a
bunch of Swiss mercenaries and go plunder a Prado.
</P>
<P>
In these pallid times, however, subtler methods are required. Today, you just
pay multiple millions for the best available picture by a master famous only
amongst connoisseurs, scholars and mavens and then sit back and wait for
experts and opportunists to attack it as a fake.
</P>
<P>
The Getty is a fun place to go these warm summer days. If you need a fresh
reason, the museum's latest and arguably greatest coup has recently come on
public view. It is, of course, the 1538 portrait of Cosimo I de Medici painted
by Jacopo Carucci da Pontormo, a Florentine Mannerist master of whom most
citizens had not heard before the Getty made him front-page famous by paying a
record price for his picture at a New York auction.
</P>
<P>
Loll on the balcony a bit before going in. The view over the museums atrium
garden somehow takes the mind off absurd matters like paintings going for $35.4
million. How can a painting be worth that? Well, how can a Batmobile bomber be
worth $600 million. The garden is limpid fantasy but its faux Roman bronzes and
splashy bleached lime fountain are more convincing than our media-generated
reality.
</P>
<P>
When you step inside out of the dazzling California light you're blinded for a
minute and a chartreuse after-image blots out the works in the galleries. Might
as well troop the collection while your eyes adjust.
</P>
<P>
Funny. The Getty used to say it would never collect modern art but significant
numbers of its best and most important paintings are modern or close to it.
Edvard Munch is surely a modern master and his 1893 "Starry Night" is like a
more depressed pendant to Van Gogh's version of the same subject. Terrific
picture with its obsessive bruised-black shapes of haunted trees. Everybody
counts the Belgian James Ensor along with the Norwegian Munch as a direct
precursor of modern Expressionism. Ensor's huge cartoon-like "The Entry of
Christ Into Brussels" is a key historical icon and the Getty's got it.
</P>
<P>
You know what? These Expressionists actually do fit in with the Getty's Old
Masters. Some certainly accidental combination of available works and
curatorial sensibility has conspired to give the ensemble an aura of, well,
oddness. There is something inescapably neurotic about Alesandro Magnasco's
icky and operatic "Bacchanale." Dosso Dossi's mythological scene has his
characteristic disturbed visionary naivete.
</P>
<P>
It would be unfair to the collection to tack down such impressions as gospel.
It is neither all on the walls nor arranged as the museum would like.
Historically, it moves in fits and starts. Sense -- if it is to come -- will
have to wait until sometime in the 1990s when they open their new citadel in
Brentwood.
</P>
<P>
There are calm and classic works in the collection like the brilliant Degas
owned jointly with Norton Simon, a sparkling small Veronese and a magisterial
Van Dyke but frankly their presence only dramatizes the persistently offbeat
note sounded even by some of their outstanding works. Carpaccio is known for
poetic strangeness. George de la Tour's "Beggars Brawl" resonates with terrible
venality. Jean-Baptise Greuze's moral allegories get caught with their hand in
the cookie jar.
</P>
<P>
The Getty has never aspired to encyclopedic completeness. Its aesthetic sense
is attracted to the same grail that seems to pervade the collective unconscious
of at least every other high-ranking artnik in this geography. You want to see
strong and dignified men tremble with something akin to religious ecstasy?
Enter their august halls and whisper, "The Frick."
</P>
<P>
Art barons around her just go all gooseflesh at the thought of the Frick Museum
in New York -- a private mansion opened as a small public museum where the the
masterpieces, largely unrelated historically, are every last one a jewel. The
place is Mecca for art connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
And guess what. The famous Pontormo hung for a number of years in the Frick. No
wonder the Getty wanted it. A piece of the Frick is as good as a saint's tibia
any day.
</P>
<P>
And here it is.
</P>
<P>
Not large. Standard cabinet-size portrait. Cosimo I de Medici is depicted at
age 18 as a soldier leaning on his pike. His sword hilt stands erect and is so
placed as to offend any right-wing senator who might perchance understand
symbolism. The woozily elongated torso looks unreal with its pinched waist and
manikin chest under a putty-colored tunic. The Mannerists were into stylishness
with a vengeance. They loved sour piquant color and the trick is done here by a
clanging red cap against a glum green background.
</P>
<P>
Cosimo's face and hands are at once virile and delicately waxen. He wears and
expression of adolescent languor -- cherub lips slightly slack, eyes awash in
aqueous fluid. Not many painters can give us that sense of the eyeball floating
in its socket. The whole is slightly disembodied as if the figure were made of
some gelatinous material that absorbs and radiates light.
</P>
<P>
The middle chunk of the 16th Century was not a happy time for art. The
Mannerist epoch -- wedged between the high classicism of Raphael and the beefy
optimism of the Baroque -- is an art shadowed with anxious doubt. In some ways
Hamlet is the central figure of the time. Doubt was sparked by Martin Luther's
Reformation, anxiety by Charles V's sack of Rome and the Spanish domination of
Italy. The art that grew from this unstable soil is often seen as a harbinger
of two facets of modernism -- dandyism and asceticism. The poet John Donne
started as a cavalier and ended and a metaphysical divine. Painting art
produced both the attenuated chic of Parmigianino and the mysticism of El
Greco.
</P>
<P>
La maniera became associated with impending doom and the cultivation of a
sensibility that consciously waffles between decadence and austerity like the
yuppies who do coke all night and go to the gym in the morning. It's an
end-of-the-world attitude that showed up among the symbolists as the 19th
Century guttered out and is among us again as irony as the 20th Century fades
-- albeit the giantism of much current art argues for a kind of Mannerist
Baroque.
</P>
<P>
Mannerist artists are often cited as personality-prototypes for modern artists
-- exquisitely ultrasensitive, brilliant and a bit mad.
</P>
<P>
Pontormo, born in 1494, was orphaned in childhood and raised by his grandmother
in Florence. According to Vasari, he was a prodigy who studied with Leonardo da
Vinci, Piero di Cosimo and Andrea del Sarto, among others. He had early success
and as a teen-ager already showed temperamental signs when he complained that a
work in which he had a minor role was unveiled without his permission.
</P>
<P>
As his success grew he became touchier, refusing to work for clients he didn't
like. He was a loner who built a house where the bedroom was accessible only by
a ladder he pulled up after him. One biographer says he was a compulsive
record-keeper meticulously noting even his most minor activities -- including
the times when the notes were made.
</P>
<P>
Pontormo spent the last 11 years of his life working on a chapel decoration
which he would allow no one to see -- including the patron who footed the bill.
Vasari say he was so afraid of death he would allow no one to mention it in his
presence.
</P>
<P>
It didn't help. He succumbed in 1557.
</P>
<P>
And now the Getty has a prime work by this unsettled master. Its strangeness is
part of its authenticity and seeing it one is content to believe that it was
the finest Old Master painting left in private hands. Now it properly belongs
to everybody and the Getty is slowly getting the pictures galleries right.

SHOWMANSHIP ECLIPSES ARTISTRY IN VASARELY

<P>
Before the Vasarely cuff links, the Vasarely wristwatches, before the
mass-produced Vasarely serigraphs and acrylic sculpture, there was a Vasarely
of more humble intentions. Before the flamboyant visual gymnastics, there was a
gentle stretching of the boundaries, a limbering of the optical muscles, a
prodding of convention and expectation.
</P>
<P>
The current exhibition of Victor Vasarely's work at Circle Gallery (2501 San
Diego Ave., through Dec. 3) shows us both the artist and the athlete, but it is
the latter, the showman, who prevails and casts a dishonorable shadow across
the entire oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian-born artist, now in his 80s, is featured in a series of
exhibitions at four Circle Gallery branches across the country. Collectively
titled "Victor Vasarely: A Retrospective Exhibition/Selections From 50 Years of
Artistic Achievement," the shows can be seen in New York, San Francisco and Los
Angeles, in addition to the show in Old Town.
</P>
<P>
Vasarely moved to Paris in 1930 and began to experiment with geometric
abstraction while working in advertising. Not until after the war, however, did
he resume his interest in the illusory spatial effects he could muster through
the basic tools of line and color.
</P>
<P>
Several series of drawings from the early 1950s, on view in the local show,
possess a fresh, spirited approach to line. Among them are the "Denfert" period
drawings, inspired by the cracked tiles in a train station that the artist
frequented, in which organic shapes embrace and overlap with modest but
appealing energy. The "Naissance" series ventures further into the realm of
illusion and suggestion, terrain that Vasarely has since exhausted mercilessly.
In these early works, the artist has filled each page with parallel lines that
dip or buckle toward the center of the image. The detour is often slight, but
enough of a deviation to imply movement and depth on the static, flat page.
</P>
<P>
The paintings and collages that follow immediately after these works are
equally unpretentious. They play with the ambiguity of positive and negative
space, the secret depth of flat shadows, the power of repetition and echo. But,
by the 1960s, Vasarely had all but discarded the subdued tones and organic
origins of his early work for images of a tightly controlled geometry in a
range of searingly bright colors.
</P>
<P>
His efforts to make the flat surface breathe, to coerce straight lines into the
appearance of curves and to make the static page feel animated and alive gave
birth to a popular style coined Op Art (short for Optical Art) in the early
'60s. The delightful infidelities of line and color have preoccupied the artist
ever since. His tour de force paintings and prints of the past few decades
feature patterns of circles, squares and diamonds that, through their spacing
and coloration, create the illusion of bulging, pulsating, stretching forms.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, these highly synthetic-seeming exercises were inspired, according
to Vasarely's writings, by the natural world, with its still, stable surface
concealing a microcosmic beehive of activity. Since the early line drawings and
collages, however, nothing in the artist's signature style even hints of the
organic. Their artificially vivid greens, oranges and purples, as well as their
seamless surfaces, reveal as little of the human hand as of the human soul.
</P>
<P>
The Circle Gallery show does contain a few pleasant surprises, even in the
later work -- such as the simple but engaging collage, "Elo" of 1989 -- but the
bulk of Vasarely's art is merely dazzling and dry.

FT  16 MAY 92 / Arts: Drawn from the age of Lorenzo the Magnificent / Visit
the inaugural show in the Uffizi's new galleries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WAS THERE ever a more spectacular display of 15th century drawings? In what
is by far the most impressive exhibition of the year-long festivities in
Florence marking the fifth centenary of the death of Lorenzo the
Magnificent, the Uffizi inaugurates its six new galleries with a show of
some 187 Florentine drawings from the age of Il Magnifico.
The peerless Uffizi holding is supplemented by outstanding loans from the
world's great print rooms and private collections. Despite the insensitive
and all but information-free installation, the result is a rare treat - and
a show that is as revealing of the nature of Renaissance drawing as it is
ravishing to behold.
A great number of the sheets are indeed of exceptional beauty, not least
given the quattrocento Florentine's predeliction for delicate strokes of
silverpoint with white heightening on prepared paper tinted with anything
from amber to deep rose madder, mandarin or brilliant azure. As vivid
witness to the creative process so admired in our own age, these confections
make it hard for us to remember that they were never conceived as works of
art in their own right.
Old Master drawings have never been as prized as they are today. To the 15th
century artist, with rare exceptions, they had no artistic value beyond
their practical function, and certainly no commercial worth. They were
stepping stones to the creation of a finished work, be it - as this
exhibition amply reveals - a fresco, panel, canvas or print, a piece of
sculpture, a church, a candelabrum or even a machine for transporting
pyramids and obelisks.
The show's thematic sections emphasise the working procedure that evolved
into standard workshop practice during the 15th century, from the first,
rapid and experimental compositional sketch to the full-size 'cartoon'
pricked for transfer. It opens with copies made as an essential part of the
artist's training. We find Michelangelo looking to the monumental figures of
Masaccio in the Brancacci Chapel, and Ghirlandaio drawing friezes from the
arch of Constantine. In view of the importance of Antiquity to the age of
Lorenzo, what could be a more appropriate first exhibit than Benozzo
Gozzoli's exquisite metalpoint on blue prepared paper after one of the
ancient statues of horse-tamers on the Quirinal?
An eloquent witness to the impact of the classical world on the perception
of the modern is Botticelli's drawing of a youth posed to echo the famous
'Spinario' or pickthorn. This silverpoint is among the reams of nude and
draped figure studies here executed at the dawn of the practice of life
drawing. They represent the first attempts to reproduce accurately the
appearance of man and the natural world. What is so extraordinary is that
there is so little grappling towards formulating a means of expression.
Drawing in Florence seems almost to have been born fully armed for its
challenges - like Pallas Athene out of the head of Zeus.
These sheets are attempts not only to explore the material universe but to
place man convincingly within it. Hence the desire to observe the
interaction of figures, telling gestures and emotions, drapery that
clarifies rather than masks human form, and landscapes drawn from the Tuscan
countryside that brought the sacred mysteries close to home.
Perhaps the most breathtaking sequence in the show is of eight carefully
wrought and boldly lit drapery studies, from Filippo Lippi to Piero di
Cosimo. Lorenzo di Credi finds volume with fine sweeping lines of
silverpoint and heightening. Leonardo's more painterly crisp, angular folds
and deep shadows emerge out of tempera on linen.
The presence of Vasari is keenly felt throughout, both as collector and as
the historian who did so much to promote the notion of a Laurentian golden
age of artistic patronage. One of the most extraordinary sheets here
belonged to the artist: Ghirlandaio's compelling death portrait of a
cabbage-nosed old man drawn in silverpoint and white heightening on rose
pink paper. Have such misshapen features ever been accorded so much grace?
By a peculiar irony, the artist's unflinching observation of the mask of
death was to bear unlikely fruit. If we turn from the drawing to the
artist's double portrait in the Louvre, we find the same old man -
miraculously alive, and with even more warts - being contemplated by his
grandson with the adoration the young accord only to the very old.
To Florentine theorists, 'disegno' (design as much as drawing) was an
instrument of the intellect and imagination. Its techniques and media
evolved to meet new artistic challenges. We find Pollaiolo, for instance,
embracing the obligingly quick and fluent medium of pen and ink to commit to
paper his notion of an unusually vigorous and energetic Hercules wielding a
blazing club to kill the Hydra. Filippino Lippi refuses to be constrained by
the precision of silverpoint, using it with astonishing brio for his sketch
of the litter-bearers for his fresco of John the Baptist raising Drusiana
from the dead. Black chalk was found to possess infinitely subtle tonal
range, the ideal medium for portrait heads. Red chalk, however, was an even
greater pleasure yet to come.
The show allows room for no less than 20 sheets by the fifth-rate goldsmith
and niello artist Maso Finiguerra, explicable only as an indication of the
rarity of drawings surviving from the 15th century. Understandably, it
devotes its last two rooms to Sandro Botticelli and his contribution to
Laurentian culture. Here are some of his remarkable illustrations to Dante's
The Divine Comedy, as well as figure studies, tempera cartoons and panels.
In the 'Adoration of the Magi' executed for Santa Maria Novella, we find the
young Lorenzo along with the elder Medici paying homage to the Christ Child.
What more perfect subject for bankers whose power rivalled that of kings.

FT  10 APR 93 / Arts: Magnificent Titian, and other titans - Patricia
Morison is enchanted by a masterful exhibition of Venice's Golden Age
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT DID Titian feel in the autumn of 1510 on hearing that Giorgione had
died of plague? Perhaps he mourned for 'Big George' who, as Vasari wrote,
'taught everything he knew with love' and revolutionised painting in Venice,
even though he was still in his early 30s when he died. Yet Titian must have
reflected that there now was no rival to stand in the way of his acceptance
as supreme painter of Venice. And so began truly The Century of Titian, the
title of the magnificent exhibition which can be seen in Paris and nowhere
else.
It would be rash to prophesy that decades must elapse before there is
another comparable exhibition of Venice's Golden Age. Nonetheless, it is
certain that this exhibition had remarkable leverage in securing loans,
thanks to the prestige of its organiser, Michel Laclotte. For this last
exhibition before his retirement, the director of the Louvre has been
calling in the favours, winkling out important paintings which have not been
lent for over a generation, and in some cases have barely been seen this
century.
Room after room of the Grand Palais is hung with masterpieces from Venice's
golden age, among them some of the best-loved paintings of the Italian
Renaissance, such as Titian's 'Flora' from the Uffizi and his 'Venus at her
Toilette' from Washington. Titian dominates, but this is not to say that it
is his show alone.
The Royal Academy's Splendour of Venice in 1983-4 produced not one
Giorgione, but some fine paintings from his circle. In contrast, Paris
offers an entire room hung with 17 Giorgiones, among them the mysterious
'Sunset Landscape' from London and the exquisite Laura, bare-breasted in a
fur-lined coat - a courtesan, a Virtue, or even, as some would have it, a
marriage portrait. As for the bitterly lamenting old woman, 'La Vecchia,' it
seems odd that anyone could think this is Giorgione's portrait of his
mother. However, the enormous catalogue (FFr390, Pounds 47.15) reveals that
this is the opinion of the Italian scholar, A. Ballarin, on whose views of
Giorgione and Titian the exhibition is more or less closely based.
But then, Giorgione is an endlessly mysterious artist. Hanging such a room
amounts to throwing down the gauntlet a dozen times - assuming that certain
paintings such as the San Diego 'Portrait of a Man,' with its immensely
delicate sfumato effect, are certainly by him. But whoever one plumps for,
there is no gainsaying the extraordinarily powerful effect of a wall of five
portraits of beautiful, narcissistic, moody young men, among them the famous
Gattemalata from the Uffizi and the hand-on-heart youth from the National
Gallery in Budapest.
The rooms which follow trace the influence of Giorgione, above all on
Sebastiano del Piombo and on young Titian. The hornets of controversy buzz
loudest of all at the point where the famous 'Concert Champetre' from the
Louvre is said to be by Titian, and the 'Susannah and Daniel' from Glasgow.
The unique pleasure of any such exhibition is to see wonderful paintings
hanging together, commenting on each other. The 'Concert' and the 'Susanna'
look less like Titian, to my eye, for being shown alongside the newly
cleaned sacra conversazione from Mamiano di Traversatolo. Here is the artist
of the Frari Assumption, totally confident in his harmonious grouping of
monumental figures, and gifted above all with the surpassing use of colour.
Separate sections on middle and late Titian include such rarities as a
portrait of Laura Dianti, Alfonso d'Este's mistress, and 'St Margaret,'
stepping out of the dragon's jaws while behind her is the view of a burning
city as brilliantly impressionistic as anything from late Titian's brush.
Interspersed are copious selections of other artists of the Veneto who fell
under (or in Lotto's case, rejected), the spell of Giorgione and Titian.
The Louvre has lent much, including the 'Man with a Glove'. Its 'Venus of
the Pardo' can be seen with the two triumphantly erotic mythologies from the
Prado, 'Danae' and 'Venus with Cupid and and Organist'. In all there are 150
paintings, and two rooms of 120 exceptionally fine prints and drawings.
Le Siecle de Titien is attracting some 4,000 visitors daily so you should
expect a queue. However, the show is spaciously hung which means that the
crowd soon thins out. Wastage is helped by the fact that there are
disgracefully few seats. This may be a mundane point, but it is nonetheless
a serious one.
Increasingly, doubts are expressed about the wisdom of exposing works of art
to the risks of travel. In the last analysis, then, the justification for
blockbuster exhibitions has to be the joy they give the public. So why, one
might ask, are curators the world over so indifferent to their visitors'
comfort? Le Siecle de Titian is, I am afraid, a classic example.
The labels are so small that opera glasses are a good idea. And if possible,
plan to visit more than once - not that there is a season ticket option,
which also seems ungenerous. At the least, husband your strength, for the
final room of the exhibition deserves not to be skimped. Hung against a
nasty royal blue background, are the unsettling works of four great painters
in their old age. Of Veronese there is the tender, quiet-toned 'St Pantaleon
curing a Child' and 'Christ in the Garden of Olives'. Counter-Reformation
spirituality speaks with a more troubling voice in the nocturnal scenes by
Tintoretto and Bassano. Among the masterpieces of Titian's final two decades
are 'Venus and Adonis' from the Metropolitan, the newly restored 'Venus
Bandaging the Eyes of Cupid,' the Detroit 'Ecce Homo,' and 'St Jerome' from
the Escorial.
Above all, there is 'The Flaying of Marsyas,' the painting which in a decade
of travel around the world has awakened a deep response in art lovers, few
of whom would ever see it at home in Kromeric in the Czech Republic. Surely,
then, it should have been possible to provide a perch?
Prestigious block-buster shows look set to continue despite the opposition
of hard-line conservationists. Indeed, their arguments look mean-spirited in
the face of an exhibition like this, which offers such a deep and rich
encounter with one of the most exciting periods in western art. And yet, at
the same time, it also underlines the need for curators to take a less
Olympian attitude to their eager but footsore public.
Exhibition ends 14 June; open daily (except Tuesdays), 10-8, Thursdays
10-10. Sponsored by ICI France.

FT  29 AUG 92 / Arts: Graft and painting in 16th century Rome - Timothy
Potts on a great artistic patron, Alessandro Farnese, who commissioned
numerous paintings and buildings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIMOTHY POTTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FARNESE were relative newcomers to the courtly circles of 16th-century
Rome. But when one of their number - Alessandro Farnese the elder, alias
Paul III - managed to attain the papal tiara, he did his utmost to ensure
that they were there to stay . For all four grandsons he skilfully
negotiated duchies or had them ordained as cardinals.
In the case of his namesake Alessandro this was the only beginning: cardinal
at 14, he was appointed a year later vice-chancellor of the Roman Church (a
station only second to that of the pope himself). Miriad other honours and
benefices followed and with them an income equivalent to one-tenth that of
the whole Vatican. Even in Cinquecento Italy this was nepotism on a truly
grand scale.
Alessandro liked to boast that he owned the three most beautiful things in
Rome: the Gesu, his palace, and his daughter Clelia. That two of these were
buildings was no accident. Eager to follow the Farnese's political and
ecclesiastical position (he vainly hoped one day to follow in his
grandfather's footsteps), Alessandro lavished much of his phenomenal wealth
on erecting and decorating his various episcopal residences, especially the
Chancelleria, and his private villa outside Rome at Caprarola (a magnificent
construction which many contemporaries praised above the Escorial), as well
as a vast number of churches and other public monuments.
Titian remarked: 'The fame so great of the great Cardinal Farnese resounds
in the ears of the world in such a way that no one speaks of anything else'
 -high praise, even if his tongue may have been silvered by the hope of
finally getting paid.
The sack of Rome by the forces of Charles V in 1527 had left much of the
city in urgent need of reconstruction, presenting an opportunity for
conspicuous piety in which Alessandro was not to be outdone, becoming the
most prolific church builder of his day. His crowning commission, designed
by Vignola, was the Gesu, the largest holy edifice of the time besides St
Peter's and destined to be the blueprint for innumerable Jesuit churches the
world over.
Although no connoisseur of painting, Alessandro also made sure that his
walls were decorated by the best: Vasari, Salviata, Taddeo and Frederico
Zuccaro, Titian and El Greco.
Alessandro seems genuinely to have enjoyed the company of scholars and
artists, whom he cultivated and patronised in lavish style - indeed more
lavish than many in post-Tridentine Italy thought appropriate.
It was at one of his dinner parties in 1546 that the idea of a series of
lives of the great artists was floated. Proposed by Alessandro's artistic
mentor of the time, Paolo Giovo, it was another of his guests, Vasari, who
was eventually prevailed upon by the assembled concensus to undertake the
project - to the eternal gratitude of Renaissance historians ever since.
The life and patronage of Alessandro, from his early interest in the
decorative arts (the Farnese Hours and Cassetta Farnese) through the
propagandistic celebrations of Farnese achievement in the palace frescoes to
the sacral commissions of his more pious old age are ably expounded and
documented, replete with references and editions of the original sources, in
Clare Robertson's book.
Despite its handsome, lavishly illustrated appearance, however, the text
reads much like the doctorate from which it grew. Dense and comprehensive,
its merits are those of scholarship rather than popularisation, a difficult
metamorphosis to carry off for even as visual a subject as this.
As the latest wave in a flood of patronage studies over the past 30 years
(the watershed was Haskell's classic Patrons and Painters of 1963), this
offering sounds a rather hollow note. What was patron X's 'taste' and how
did it evolve? What influence did this have on his commissions?
Issues which marked such a novel departure when first explored by Haskell,
here have more the hackneyed tone of the examiner's favourite perennials.
With Haskell, there was a feeling of important questions which just had not
been asked before.
With Robertson, one feels they are addressed from a sense of obligation,
devoid of any intuition for what will get to the heart of this particular
subject. The answers - 'he was generally more concerned with iconography
than stylistic issues. . . His choices of architect. . . seem to be based on
aesthetic criteria, though presumably considerations such as efficiency and
speed of execution must also have been important' - are often unsurprising
and sometimes unconvincing - 'The concern for impressive facades and piazzas
in front of his churches. . . suggests that religious patronage was not
simply motivated by piety' - leaving a prevailing feeling of sympathy that
so much effort was expended for such slight returns.
So why will we study patrons? Because, Robertson tells us, 'we may therefore
increase our understanding of the constraints imposed on (the artist) during
the process of creation. . . By isolating such influences the art historian
may hope to understand more fully how the work of art was made. This will
help us to better appreciate the artist's skill in responding to external
limitations.'
This is all very well, but it is not done. The artists are never reassessed,
the loop is never closed. The early promises are left in an empty and
unfulfilled rationalisation. Better surely, and more honest, simply to
declare the importance of patronage in its own right to social history and
indeed to catholic art history.
As for Alessandro, it is an artist who should properly have the final word,
especially when the verdict of of Michaelangelo himself is preserved: '(In
France and Italy) you will find private individuals and lords who do not at
this moment appreciate painting. . . like Cardinal Farnese, who does not
know what a painting is, but who made very reasonable conditions for Messer
Perino (del Vaga), simply so that he could be called his painter. . . in
addition to paying him very well for his works'. A patron with more money
than sense - what more could an artist ask for?

FT  05 OCT 93 / Arts: Artists true to their imagination - William Packer
admires modern art that is not avant-garde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French are still capable of surprising and gratifying us all. Just as we
finally despair of the current, apparently terminal state of the visual
arts, with a supposed avant-garde committed to nothing more than the glib
orthodoxies of critical fashion and the market-place, up they come with an
exhibition that clearly shows us that true painting and sculpture have been
going on all the time.
And what is it exactly, this 'true painting'? It is easier to say what it is
not, for here is nothing of empty conceptualising, no striking of
self-conscious attitudes, no idea-led and limited investigation or polemic,
no art about art. Above all, there is nothing in which responsibility for
the work as it actually appears is shuffled off onto mere process or the
bare proposition of idea or image. Here is the work of artists as
individuals, engrossed simply in the resolution of their work in terms of
their own direct experience of the world. At the last it is neither more nor
less than what they themselves have done. Responsibility is all.
That said, it has its limitations. Manifeste is hardly an earnest for the
future, for many of its artists are dead and none is exactly young. There is
to it all a whiff of the old-fashioned, which, to be fair, is openly
acknowledged in the excellent catalogue. 'Here are the crossers of the ford.
They have known another Europe, one still essentially agricultural,
industrial and artisan, such as it was in the 19th century, a culture from
before the media . . . They were active when those ideas that shaped our
epoch were in the melting-pot . . . they conducted their debates, of
solitude to solitude, with an astonishing vitality, for all their apparent
respect for traditional techniques, or their indifference to the spectacular
developments of newer generations.'
And, this being France, it is of course over-whelmingly Franco-centric, not
so much a celebration or attempt to reassert the primacy of the School of
Paris, but rather an acknowledgment of its survival. 'They knew how to keep
their distance. In the singularity of their work, these artists have indeed
written a 'parallel history', though its global sense was perhaps lost with
the end of the dominance of l'Ecole de Paris.' The exhibition is drawn from
the collections of the Musee nationale d'art moderne which are held at the
Centre Pompidou, and of its international element - that includes Balthus,
Giacometti, Picasso, Soto, Vasarely, Tapies, Fontana, Poliakoff, Miro,
Calder and many more - only Francis Bacon and Anthony Caro, at a quick
check, spent no extended working period in Paris.
The point is not altogether gratuitous, for that missing sens global might
well have been supplied, were there the works within the collections to
supply them, or the curatorial will to choose them. Quite whose fault that
is is an open question. We do well to remember that a narrow chauvinism,
though a French word, is by no means peculiar to the French.
The show is divided under headings - the painter and his model: figuration,
defiguration: the skin of the work: sign and handwriting: gesture and
colour: the surprises of geometry: and so forth. And, given the period, it
is not hard to find the places that might have been filled by American
painters such as Guston, Rothko, Motherwell, Kelly or de Kooning, or British
for that matter, such as Bridget Riley, Freud, Auerbach, Kossoff. It remains
true that most British painting of the period is barely known abroad. As for
the Americans, one of the show's most spectacular paintings is by Joan
Mitchell, an abstract expressionist who died last year at the age of 66,
having been resident in Paris for many years. She is not represented at all
in the current survey in London of 20th century American art. Forgetfulness
or indifference?
But this is a School of Paris show, even so, to be taken as it is, with all
its special emphases and lacunae, and as such it is one of the most
stimulating and encouraging exhibitions of near-current art to be seen in
recent years. The reason, adumbrated before, is simple, with the artist
shown once again in proper relation to his work, one to one, direct and
physical.
The imagery might be more or less figurative - Picasso's desperate, fading
sexuality; the more ambiguous, charged sexuality of Balthus, the
angst-ridden intensity of Giacometti, the humane despair of Bacon, the
dreadful, symbolic autobiography of Zoran Music. Again we might have Pol
Bury with his clicking, shifting, mechanical surfaces, Vasarely with his
eye-teasing opposition of positive to negative, Morellet with his dense,
meticulous cobwebs, Soto with his disrupted, moire-pattern effects, all of
them testing the muscular, palpable sensation of vision.
Or here are Burri and Tapies, Kemeny and Fontana, working the surface as a
physical object, or Mitchell, Bazaine, Riopelle, Viera da Silva, taking the
mark and the gesture at the brush's end and conjuring from it the internal
landscape of the mind to which all abstract painting would seem to aspire.
Whichever it is, before each particular work we confront an artist's
singular engagement with work, achieved with his own hands and resolved
through the medium of his own imagination and experience.
This is some of the work with which my generation grew up and, the nostalgic
frisson apart, it is good to see it brought once again into the light, not
as a critical curiosity, but as something still vital and imaginatively
potent. Painting is not dead, nor even moribund and in despair, but it is
critically neglected, especially that of the more recent generations.

<LEADPARA>  THE Mistral will blow. The peasants rail, quaff Pastis and chew on their
Gitanes. The sun will shine, and Provence is still Provence.;   But the

and its follow-up, "Toujours Provence," runaway best-sellers is only part of
the picture.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "And hey, we're still people here -- this is a viable town with a school,
church and small-town shops," says Lynda Mazet, who owns a top
hotel-restaurant, the Bastide, in Gordes, not far from Mayle's territory in
Menerbes. "Our men don't all lug baguettes and wear berets.";   Some natives
and many expatriate settlers around this southern area, known variously as the
Vaucluse or the Luberon, were furious at Mayle's first book, claiming it
brought busloads of gawkers, and queries to every other farmer about selling
his property.;   Though already something of a tourist haven with a certain
amount of souvenir-hawking, Gordes is a charming base for touring the region.;
  Plenty to do;   Its stunning views, interesting art museum, refurbished
ancient houses and curious beehive historic structures offer lots of
diversion.;   It's no secret that an international array of artists, writers
and celebrities have made the Luberon their country-hideaway since it was
"discovered" after World War II by artist Marc Chagall.;   Some of the
denizens relaxing in the area include Englishman Barry Sainsbury of grocery
family fame, American artist Joe Downing from Horse Cave, Ky., and American
publishing tycoon John Fairchild. .;   Visitors to Gordes can hardly miss the
Renaissance chateau leased by painter Victor Vasarely to show off his work as
a complement to the monumental Vasarely museum in Aix-la-Provence.;   Country
market enthusiasts should spend a Tuesday morning in Gordes, when farmers,
artisans and caterers of the Luberon set up shop on the central square.;
Besides jewelry and pottery, you can revel in the veritable mosaic of olives,
succulent jams, condiments, honey and olive oils.;   Real country fare;   And
try a sample of country specialties from Francois Moussu, who regularly tours
the region's markets, offering adventurous fare such as "rooster in beer" stew
or preserved tripe in wine, made by him at his own farm.;   Antique buffs
should catch the flea and antiques market at nearby Isle-sur-la-Sorgue on
weekends.;   Les Bories, just outside Gordes, is a village of restored
beehive-like limestone structures apparently used since time immemorial to
house shepherds and their flocks. This group is supposedly 14th-century, and
the restored huts look spartan uncomfortable.;   Just a few kilometers away is
Senanques Abbey, a moving Provencal site. Set in a desolate hollow under the
Luberon mountains, the Cistercian abbey founded in the 12th century (and
lately restored) offers a special magic if you arrive around sunset and hear
echoes of the monks intoning vespers with singing cicadas as background.;
Besides Menerbes, with its spectacularly perched cemetery looking like the
prow of a ship, there are other high points -- at Roussillon, Lacoste and
Bonnieux. Roussillon is a riot of pinks, ruddy reds and ochre, a stage set of
a village carved from its native stone. Lacoste is notable for a craggy ruin,
once the stomping ground of the Marquis de Sade.;   Hiking is a favorite
activity, and hiking maps are obtainable through the Gordes Syndicat
d'Initiative (tourist office).;   Touring here you're bound to work up a
hearty appetite, and the region has plenty of bistros and restaurants to
satisfy.;   Among the most picturesque and very best is Lynda Mazet's Bastide.
Hanging precariously over a ravine below the town square, the hotel in a
converted old gendarmerie offering stunning views.;   After a hefty investment
of over $3 million by the Mazet family three years ago, the wreck that had
been pock-marked by bullet holes since resistance fighting in World War II was
turned into a luxurious hostelry.;   The chef, Alain Soliveres, has gained an
enthusiastic following with his seasonal food based on local produce and
ingenuity. Some recent delights included cream of pumpkin soup with grated
fresh truffles and sauteed shellfish with butterfly pasta.;   Also in Gordes,
"Le Victuailler," mainly a catering establishment, gets kudos for intriguing
dishes.;   Patrick Payet's Le Tonneau in Goult offers charm in an antique,
farm-tool decor. The reasonable (about $20) menu may include baby artichokes
stuffed with warm goat cheese, aubergine pate with tomato sauce, raw fish
marinated with lime, or spinach-stuffed crab, just for starters.  </TEXT>

FT  22 AUG 92 / Arts: Swiss eccentric who defies classification - The career
of the painter Jean-Etienne Liotard, known as 'The Turk'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE notion of artistic eccentricity has a distinguished pedigree. Vasari
records how the old and reclusive Piero di Cosimo was enraged by the sound
of crying babies, coughing men, ringing bells and singing friars, and lived
on a diet of eggs which he boiled 50 at a time along with his glue.
Pontormo, if the mood so took him, would refuse to work for a Medici and
instead paint a Madonna for a builder.
It was the Romantics, however, who established the idea of a distinctive
artistic temperament and dress. Flowing locks and unorthodox costume became
means by which young bloods could assert their independence from the art
establishment.
What, then, is to be made of the pre-Romantic Jean-Etienne Liotard, 'The
Turk', who sported a scandalous belt-length beard and Turkish garb long
after his return to Europe? Is it simply hindsight that tempts the
organisers of a current monographic show to see his mode of attire as an
expression of aesthetic non-conformity?
Clearly he cannot be neatly pigeon-holed. This most versatile and
cosmopolitan of artists was born of French Hugenot parents in the Republic
of Geneva. He was apprenticed to a portrait painter, miniaturist and
enameller in Geneva, and to a miniaturist and engraver in Paris.
In 1735 he travelled to Naples with the French ambassador, le vicomte de
Puisieux. While in a coffee house in Rome, he overheard a group of gentlemen
praising his miniature of the Medici Venus, and made the fateful
acquaintance of William Ponsonby, future 2nd Earl of Bessborough.
With Ponsonby, Lord Sandwich and company he sailed for the Levant, and there
he remained, in Constantinople, for four years. Subsequently he went to
Moldavia on the invitation of the Prince, and proceeded to Vienna to paint
the Imperial court.
In Paris he became Painter Ordinary to the King, although fiercely excluded
from the French Academy. So he prospered, portraying the aristocracy and
bourgeoisie of France, Switzerland, Germany, Austria and England.
Even at the age of 80 he was producing still-lifes for Catherine II of
Russia. He was a highly proficient painter in oil and enamel, a sensitive
draughtsman and a virtuoso pastel painter.
Liotard is still celebrated as a painter in pastel. As a draughtsmen he is
less known. This exhibition, a collaboration between Geneva's Musee d'art et
d'histoire and the Musee du Louvre in Paris, is the first to reunite his
drawings - and what is not here is usefully published in the catalogue. The
whole is leavened by a sprinkling of pastels and oils, gouaches and
miniatures. Visitors to the Geneva view are also directed to the museum's
outstanding holding of delectable Liotard pastels.
The show opens with full-length figure studies or, more precisely, costume
studies of the peasant women of the Roman campagna in regional folk dress -
working and Sunday best - executed Watteau-style in red and black chalk.
Then come the elaborately dressed girls of Malta, Chios, Milos, and
Constantinople drawn for the publication planned by Liotard's English
companions.
In Smyrna and Constantinople, we find the Europeans gone native. The
frock-coated French consul in Smyrna lounges on a low divan. Alongside the
exotic henna-tipped Frankish women at the Turkish bath, Greeks, Tatars,
Turks, merchants and musicians, the British ambassador to the Sublime Port
sits musing in damask robe and soft slippers. The Levant seems all langour,
ennui.
From the first, Liotard's touch is careful but deft. He exploits both the
hard edge of the chalk as well as its softness, combining its delicacy and
its breadth. His miniaturist's taste for detail makes him the textile
historian's dream. Even a rapid sketch speaks volumes about stuff: no doubt
the lace, the embroideries, the woven silks, each applique flower and fringe
are identifiable. In pastel he goes a stage further and captures the
softness of silk, the bloom of velvet, the depth of a rich Turkey carpet.
Costume and textile often have more substance than the sitter.
Liotard is invariably content to depict exactly what he saw - this apparent
objectivity was to be much admired by Flaubert and Ingres. If the Empress
Maria-Theresa happened to look like a gute Hausfrau, so be it.
Only occasionally does he care to penetrate the psychology of a sitter, as
he does in his subtle portrait drawing of the seated Mehemet Aga or his
study of the young British archaeologist Richard Pococke in sombre Ottoman
rig, whose sensitive features radiate a keen intelligence.
Liotard can be refreshingly unconventional. Only rarely did he succumb to
the seductive charm of the prevailing Rococo style - a considerable
achievement for an artist who worked in pastel and coloured chalks. Into his
portrait drawings, even if not always into his oils and pastels, he
introduced an air of easy informality only previously acceptable in
portraits of literary figures, philosophers or artists. His drawings made in
the Levant are as fascinating to us as they were to our 18th century
forebears. Above all, they remain extraordinary documents of a particular
time and place.
The exhibition continues at the Musee d'art et d'histoire, Geneva, until
September 20, and shows at the Musee de Louvre in Paris, October 15-December
14.

AT CSUN, THE VERY MODEL OF A MAN OF GENIUS -- DA VINCI
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The inventions sketched by Leonardo da Vinci in more than 8,000 pages of
personal notes testify to the brilliance of the 15th-Century painter, who
envisioned such possibilities as helicopters, automobiles, hydraulics and
robots.
</P>
<P>
But wind up, crank, push or pump one of the working models that go on exhibit
Monday at Cal State Northridge and the true genius of the Renaissance man comes
to life.
</P>
<P>
"At first you see them as inert, immobile objects," said Donald Strong, a
professor of art history at CSUN. "But when his machines are working, they are,
in fact, living machines."
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four replicas of the devices, including a paddle-wheel ship, odometer,
drill press, pile driver and parachute, will be at CSUN's Fine Arts Gallery
through April 14. The models, on loan from a collection begun in 1951 by IBM,
are all "hands-on" exhibits, made from wood and brass, standing several feet
tall.
</P>
<P>
Grab the crank of a scaling ladder and spin the large, toothed gear until all
the sections are extended. Da Vinci was thinking in terms of scaling the wall
of an enemy fortress, but the device clearly predates modern firefighting
equipment.
</P>
<P>
Turn the handle on one of his many gear systems -- machines more theoretical
than practical in his day -- and see how da Vinci used several cogs to simulate
what today might be called a variable-speed transmission.
</P>
<P>
And don't forget to spin the wheels on the military tank, an armored capsule
intended for carrying heavy firepower and to be driven from within by men with
cranks.
</P>
<P>
"This is all movement with a purpose," said Strong, who will lecture about the
devices at 10 a.m. March 27 in the Fine Arts Gallery. "He believed he had the
power to design something that had a living presence because it obeyed the same
laws of operation as anything created by nature itself. In Leonardo's mind, man
created on a par with nature."
</P>
<P>
Of course, da Vinci was not the only man of his day weighing the heady ideas
that made the 15th Century one of the most colorful, vital periods in history.
But what made da Vinci unique, say scholars, was his extraordinary gift for
synthesis, visualizing the relationships between art, medicine, music,
engineering and the forces of nature.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1452 near Florence, Italy, da Vinci was the illegitimate son of a
notary and, as such, was not permitted to attend the local university. Instead,
he studied painting and gained the artistic perspective that allowed him to
record with such precision the wonders of the world he lived in.
</P>
<P>
He dissected corpses to learn human anatomy, observed birds to design flying
machines, studied architecture to make maps, and mastered optics and color so
that his paintings, such as the "Mona Lisa," radiate with warmth and intensity.
</P>
<P>
"For him, art and science were the same, and their purpose was to lead to
truth, to an understanding of the secrets of man and of the universe," writes
Richard McLanathan in the IBM catalogue that accompanies the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps no better example of that quest can be found than in da Vinci's
notebooks, which by the time he died in 1519 were filled with inventions
ranging from the practical to the fantastic, from the gruesome to the sublime.
</P>
<P>
The modern models are the work of Roberto Guatelli, an engineer from Milan who
was commissioned in the late 1930s by Benito Mussolini to replicate 156 of the
devices. All of them were destroyed in bombing raids during World War II.
</P>
<P>
But after the war, Guatelli came to the United States, where he built another
56 models for a show that opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in
1950. The following year, IBM hired Guatelli to continue making the models, and
for the last four decades they have been on almost continual tour in this
country and around the world.
</P>
<P>
"I feel like he is my dead grandfather," Guatelli once said of da Vinci. "If he
were here, he would chase me around the block yelling, 'What are you doing to
my work?' "
</P>
<P>
"Leonardo da Vinci: The Inventions" will be on display Monday through April 14
at the Fine Arts Gallery at Cal State Northridge, 18111 Nordhoff St. Gallery
hours are noon to 4 p.m. Mondays, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays,
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. March 18 and April 1 and 8, and noon to 4 p.m. April 9.
Admission is free.

ART NOTEBOOK: PHOTOGRAPHER GREG GORMAN DOES AN ABOUT-FACE WITH NEW FOCUS ON
NUDES
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's not as if photographer Greg Gorman is trying to escape from his
identification with personality portraiture. After all, Gorman has built a
valuable reputation and career these last 10 years with formal studies of some
famed and notorious faces.
</P>
<P>
His just-published first book, "Greg Gorman: Volume One," is a document to
that, with a small chapter in the back reserved for his recent work with nude
figures. But those arriving at the G. Ray Hawkins Gallery for Gorman's first
major local exhibition might be surprised to find that his portraits of such
figures as Andy Warhol, Bette Davis and Tom Waits are dominated by his
lesser-known nude works.
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy doing nudes," Gorman said, standing on the concrete floor at the Santa
Monica gallery in blue jeans and a T-shirt. "And I felt it was important I do
more personal work than just my celebrity portraiture. I've always been
interested in personalities, per se, because I love people's faces. But I'm
also interested in the human form."
</P>
<P>
Most of the nudes were created within the past two years, photographed between
personality assignments under natural light at his West Hollywood studio. Many
of the black and white works are portraits in themselves, including two of the
imposing, chiseled figure of actress Brigitte Nielsen. And a six-panel series
on model Tony Ward captures the male form in various stages of dynamic
movement, like some updated version of an Eadweard Muybridge photographic
motion study.
</P>
<P>
Still, Gorman's show offers several examples of the work that has made him in
high demand at a variety of magazines, film studios and advertising agencies.
An understated portrait of David Hockney shows the artist, in polka-dotted bow
tie and cuffed corduroys, leaning forward in a rocking chair and obscuring his
own face with a baseball cap. Nearby, a photograph of singer Michael Jackson
under a black veil re-creates a similarly dark 1924 image by Edward Steichen of
actress Gloria Swanson.
</P>
<P>
"Primarily, most of my work is fairly premeditated," said Gorman, 41, an
admirer of photographers Richard Avedon and Irving Penn. "I know, going into a
photo session, what I'm going to do, although things always develop, change and
progress during that time, as in any creative endeavor."
</P>
<P>
Gorman said he doesn't necessarily see the new book and exhibition as marking
the beginning or end of any discernable phase of his career. Since leaving
Kansas City and earning a cinematography degree at USC, Gorman has merely been
working on establishing his style.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still doing similar things, but changing in certain areas," he said. "If
anything, I'm probably loosening up a little bit. I'm making the portraits a
little less staid, a little less rigid and a little more open. Everybody's
going to grow."
</P>
<P>
Photography by Greg Gorman, through Sept. 5, G. Ray Hawkins Gallery, 910
Colorado Ave., Santa Monica; (213) 394-5558. Open 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.
Tuesday through Saturday.

<P>
WALKING THE LINE: There is little denying the infinite number of art careers
that began quietly with some well-placed scratches on paper. And this month,
the Richard-Bennett Gallery brings 22 local artists back to that intimate,
early stage with an all-drawing exhibition called "Drawing the Line."
</P>
<P>
Most of the 24 works offer the traditional elements of pen, pencil and paper.
But some in the group, which includes Tim Rollins, Raymond Pettibone, Jacci Den
Hartog and Jorge Pardo, have opted to reinterpret the simple art form.
</P>
<P>
Among the non-traditional drawings is Steve DeGroodt's "Digging Stick," which
incorporates wire mesh into a charcoal and paper work. And Scott King's
"Lifted," which was created especially for the show, reveals a message on
typewriter correction tape mounted on paper.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus really these days has been much more toward object-oriented work,"
said Dominica Salvatore, the gallery's associate director. "So this is sort of
bringing it down to a much more intimate level."
</P>
<P>
Salvatore added that a majority of the artists in the show no longer use
drawing as a means of public expression. The exhibition offered these artists
an opportunity to reveal a quieter side to their work.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to make a more personal, low-key show for the summer, which included
works with artists we've had interest in for a while," she said. "And drawing
is a very personal statement."
</P>
<P>
Drawings by 22 local artists, through Sept. 8, Richard-Bennett Gallery, 830 N.
La Brea Ave., L.A.; (213) 962-8006. Open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through
Saturday.

 A GIRL OF 60: The joke's unintentional, of course, but most cartoon characters
never seem to age anywhere near as fast as their creators. That may have
occurred to veteran animator Grim Natwick on Wednesday night. The co-creator of
Betty Boop was to celebrate his 100th birthday at a gallery saluting the
ageless image of the chanteuse heroine.
</P>
<P>
The Circle Gallery in Beverly Hills is showing a variety of works depicting
Betty Boop, first drawn in 1930. The show includes signed color and black and
white lithographs by Natwick and nearly 100 animation cels from an early 1980s
television revival.
</P>
<P>
"She was the first female cartoon character that was provocative," said Marc
Subias, director of animation art at the gallery. "She was curvy and sexy and
saucy. She had a little wink. But at the same time, she was so innocent. She
was a sexy heroine, and that was kind of a new thing for everybody."
</P>
<P>
The Circle Gallery, which owns 38 stores nationwide, has devoted a sizable
amount of wall space to animation since 1974. Subsequent years have offered
paintings, drawings and animation cels from Disney, Hanna-Barbera and famed
Warner Bros. animators Chuck Jones and Friz Freleng.
</P>
<P>
Subias said its clientele of fine art collectors, who have been attracted by
Circle Gallery shows of Peter Max, LeRoy Neiman and, soon, Victor Vasarely,
have often become interested in the animation exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
"It's more difficult to turn an animation collector into a fine art collector,"
Subias said. "But our fine art collectors recognize the importance of animation
and will quite often attend the show, pleasantly surprised, and end up
acquiring several animation cels."
</P>
<P>
Artwork of cartoon character Betty Boop, including lithographs by co-creator
Grim Natwick, through August, Circle Gallery, 329 N. Beverly Drive, Beverly
Hills; (213) 273-1461. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Wednesday, 10 a.m.
to 10 p.m. Thursday through Saturday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday.

FT  12 MAR 94 / Travel: A Tuscan history lesson - The Arno and Tiber valleys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE GARDINER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the forest you walk on velvet. The only sound along paths of deep-piled
leaf-mould is that of a beech leaf or prickly chestnut detaching itself.
Here in middle Tuscany you see no bird or animal, nothing on the move until
next Thursday when the forestry vehicle passes by. The occasional woodcutter
stares in amazement: 'What are you doing up here? Looking for mushrooms?'
You cross a clearing, the fairy ring of the charcoal- burners, a vanished
trade. You come to a silent village which has sprouted off the rock, under
the woodland canopy, as harmoniously as a clump of flowers.
The pink marsiglia pantiles, all askew, are reinforced with flagstones, the
lintels pitted with chisel marks, the doors tied up with old stockings and
the cracks in the bulging walls strapped with iron bands. A woman in peasant
black stares at you.
We are on the horseshoe curve of hills which encloses the Casentino, the
valley of the infant Arno river. From one side you might almost see the
domes of Florence, from the other the tower blocks of Rimini. Up the valley
a road and a light railway crawl this way and that, looking for the Arno's
source. One or two roads struggle up to the watershed and, at summit level,
you can park your car and walk into that rarest of modern Italian qualities
 -solitude.
History ancient and modern is locked up in these hills. On a small road
above Arezzo we explored La Verna's rock-cut monastery, important in the
life of St Francis of Assisi. Displayed here are his staff, rope girdle,
sandals and flagella. On Sundays the place is thronged. Several hundred sit
down to lunch which, being prepared by the monks, is cheap and ghastly.
I walked the Pratomagno or 'Great Meadow,' starting at Vallombrosa where
Milton played the organ. The switchback trail along the tops begins at a
lonely rifugio where huntsmen, at 8am, were drinking brandy and cursing the
mist. It was misty all the way. Long before I saw it I heard the wind
whistling through the latticework of the Croce di Pratomagno.
Nearby I located the stone which commemorates Bert Hinkler, long-distance
aviator and native of Queensland. A wreath of flowers lies there,
camouflaged in fallen leaves. The Australian ambassador had been up there a
few days earlier in a helicopter, marking the 60th anniversary of the night
when Hinkler in his Puss Moth, en route from Croydon in England to Sydney,
crashed into the mountains. Two months later, when the snows had melted, a
shepherd found the wreckage and a search party found the body, some distance
away, partly eaten by foxes.
From heights like these you look down on the Casentino with its steady
stream of traffic and a rail-car which stops at every wayside halt. Down
there, promiscuous housing spreads over the fields where Dante fought in the
last battle of the civil wars. Down there, light industry pollutes the
Casentino brooks which, in Dante's Inferno, tormented souls longed for.
Italy's economic growth has transformed rural Tuscany. It is hard in that
semi-industrial scene to pick out the box-like 12th-century towers of the
Guidi counts which dot the course of the Arno.
Never mind. It is still haunted, hallowed ground. This district was the
seed-plot of Renaissance genius. Pratovecchio, terminus of the little train,
gave birth to Paolo Uccello, whose Battle of San Romano used to hang over
Lorenzo de' Medici's bed.
Masaccio, enfant terrible of the Florence art scene (his name meant 'Wicked
Tom'), was born at Loro Ciuffenna on the Pratomagno. Vicchio, just beyond
the horseshoe of the hills, was the cradle of Giotto. From the valley towns
came Vasari and Petrarch (Arezzo), Luca Signorelli and Fra Angelico
(Cortona).
Both the Arno and Tiber rise in these hills. On a green-topped hill between
them sits Caprese Michelangelo, crowned with a feudal castle. I walked into
the bar and asked the barmaid, aged about 12: 'Who is this Michelangelo?'
'I don't understand you.'
'You have a Michelangelo birthplace, a Michelangelo bar. Who is he? Some
politician?'
The child took a deep breath. 'He was no less than the greatest artist who
ever lived. If you could see his works, signore, you would say they were
done not by the hand of man but by the hand of God.'
He was born there by accident; he does not really belong to the local
pantheon. His mother was making her way to Rome when a thunderstorm
frightened the horses. The carriage overturned and she went into labour. The
Buonarotti family owned the local castello, so she stayed there until the
baby was born. In the 1920s the government started dignifying place-names
with the names of native celebrities - Sasso Marconi, Arqua Petrarca, Torre
del Lago Puccini. Caprese became Caprese Michelangelo.
The local hero, however, is not Michelangelo but Piero della Francesca, born
at Sansepolcro. His works are scattered over the countryside in churches,
cemetery chapels and dusty municipal halls. Often they are protected by
nothing more than a frayed rope and the jealous piety of villagers. When
Charles de Gaulle persuaded the mayor of Monterchi to lend Piero's Madonna
del Parto for a Paris exhibition, women lay in the road and refused to let
it go.
Sansepolcro has Piero's Resurrection, which Aldous Huxley considered the
finest painting in the world, but this artist's supreme legacy was the
series of frescoes which illustrates The Legend of the Cross at Arezzo, on
the walls of what looks like a disused barn but is really the old church of
San Francesco.
The Casentino and upper Tiber valley, popular with Italian weekend tourists
and art students, are not much penetrated by foreigners. A bungaloid rash,
and the quarries and new roads which disfigure the Pratomagno slopes, do not
encourage exploration. In 20 years this has become a different world, but a
few communities remain intact. The flagged lanes of Poppi; the perfect
defensive ring of Anghiari's walls; the whole town of Sansepolcro inside its
gates and the upper town of Arezzo haven't changed in seven centuries.
The stone sockets of town houses blossom with banners on days of
celebration. At weekends the crossbowmen and flag-jugglers sustain ancient
rivalries in explosive encounters; for the rest of the time the citizens
move serenely and aimlessly about - 'Like fish in an aquarium,' I suggested.
'Like characters in Piero's paintings,' said my guide.
Arezzo's hotels are cheaper and less sophisticated than those of Florence;
nevertheless, at the Minerva, Etrusco or Continentale you may pay up to
Pounds 60 a night. Sansepolcro's best, in a picturesque setting, is La
Balestra, about Pounds 40 a night. There are serious parking problems in
this town.
Most villages of the Casentino have adequate small hotels, sometimes
attached to gourmet restaurants, sometimes closed in winter. Notable among
them are Parc Hotel at Poppi (Pounds 40), Buca di Michelangelo at Caprese
(Pounds 26), Fonte della Galletta at Alpe Faggeto (Pounds 28), Oliver at
Anghiari (Pounds 36) and Croce di Savoia at Vallombrosa (Pounds 45). All
these places are in red Michelin.
For walkers and cyclists among the hills, almost every hamlet has its
locanda (private lodging house) at under Pounds 12 a night, including food.
All Casentino and Tiber valley localities have bus connections with Arezzo
and Sansepolcro, at least once a day.

<HEAD>Computers Explore Art And Science Of Leonardo da Vinci</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Experts are using computer graphics to explore in
three dimensions the revolutionary artistic and scientific work of
Italian Renaissance genius Leonardo da Vinci.
   The results will be shown in the Hayward Gallery Jan. 26-April
16, said Rosalie Cass, an organizer of the exhibition.
   ``If Leonardo was around today there is no doubt he would be
using computers and what we are doing is to show that there was no
division in his mind between his science and his art,'' Miss Cass
said Thursday.
   She said the exhibition will combine the artistic and scientific
interests of da Vinci and display the greatest range of his
drawings ever assembled.
   ``Unlike photography, which records surface patterns of light
and color, computer graphics build realistic, three-dimensional
images,'' said Philip Steadman, who is directing the sequences.
   ``Leonardo's drawings are being plotted into a computer and the
sequences will make clear to visitors the spatial thinking and
development in his ideas on architectural projects, light in space
and geometrical bodies,'' he said.
   Participants will use the technique to analyze the perspective
of Leonardo's wall painting ``The Last Supper.''
   The painting of Jesus Christ, portrayed at the moment when he
tells his disciples that one of them will betray him, marks a
turning point in art. It presents questions on perspective that art
historians and scientists still have not completely solved since
the work was completed in 1497.
   ``Everything comes together in only one spot, but that varies
from different viewpoints and from some positions there appear to
be different vanishing points,'' Miss Cass said.
   The tempera painting, damaged by dampness, is on a refectory
wall in the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, Italy.
   In his ``Treatise on Painting'' Leonardo wrote: ``Painting
encompasses the surfaces, colors, and forms of anything created by
nature, and philosophy penetrates those same bodies, considering
their properties, but is not satisfied with the truth as shown by
the painter.''
   Steadman said: ``It is striking how many of Leonardo's remarks
in his treatise, whether on human anatomy, optics or the structure
of plants, go well beyond the limits of what is strictly relevant
to the painter's needs, and how often a section ends with a remark
that he will pursue the subject elsewhere in one of his projected
scientific works.''
   The exhibition will have 119 drawings, 88 of them from the royal
collection at Windsor Castle, and Italian and British models built
recently from Leonardo's drawings of mechanical inventions.
   They include a construction of his flying machine with a 36-foot
wingspan, ball bearings, a tank and a multibarreled gun.
   Leonardo, who lived from 1452 to 1519, worked for Duke Lodovico
Sforza of Milan.
   He entered the duke's service after writing a celebrated letter
saying he believed he could give ``complete satisfaction'' in
military engineering, constructing buildings and sculpture in
marble, bronze or clay.
   ``In painting I can do as much as anyone, whoever he may be,''
he wrote.

A Pristine Sistine: Michelangelo Unveiled

   Claustrophobic winding corridors lead to a hike over a creaky gangplank attached several stories above ground to the outside wall of the Sistine Chapel, and then, finally, comes an undignified scramble up a two-stage ladder to a platform slightly larger than a boxing ring.
That's the workshop of the conservators who are cleaning the filth of five centuries from the most famous painted ceiling in the world in a crossfire of controversy.

   A few more steps yet and one can touch Michelangelo's vaulting fresco.
Between 1508 and 1512, he decorated this monstrous 128-by-45-foot span with his singular vision of the Creation, of stars and planets, plants and animals, Adam and Eve.
Along with the accumulated dirt, the Vatican conservators have spent the last seven years peeling away long-held notions about the painter's brooding palette.
Dusty colors are giving way to mauves, yellows, pale blues and ice greens.
But lately, every new square inch of newly bared brightness provokes a shriek of outrage from a small group of standpatters, mostly non-specialists, who want to keep their Michelangelo in the dark.

   A few weeks ago, for instance, a handful of Los Angeles artists signed a petition asking the pope to stop this sacrilege.
They were copycatting an earlier petition signed by 15 New York artists.
So far, though, the pontiff has shown no interest in this color controversy, issuing no bull and not even bothering to clamber up to the platform.

   So conservator Gianluigi Colalucci and his small team are free to clean away, and are just now reaching the midway point in their epic task, which should be complete when the Last Judgment on the altar is finished in 1992.
The chapel will remain open to the public throughout.

   Last week, the conservators threw their atelier-eyrie open to special deputations from around the globe, including curious American and Italian conservators sent over by the Kress Foundation.

   Above our heads was the result of the last three months of work: A fresh-skinned Adam and Eve reaching for the fatal fruit and then heading unhappily out of Eden.

   Michelangelo spent about a month painting the scene, brushing water-based paints directly onto fresh, wet plaster (the buon fresco technique).
A sculptor at heart, he didn't enjoy himself much and left bilious poems and caricatures that complain about his paint-covered, painwracked time on the Sistine scaffold.

   Contrary to popular perception, though, he did not work lying on his back, and neither do the conservators.
Like Michelangelo, whom he otherwise does not resemble -- no temper, no sheepskin leg-wrappings -- Mr. Colalucci stands upright when he applies the cleansing agent.
This gel does not sink into the frescoed plaster and forms no chemical bond with the pigments.
For Adam and Eve, two careful, time-controlled applications, each followed by a rinse of distilled water, generally sufficed.
Cracks are filled in with watercolor.

   Among the assembled experts, there seemed general agreement that the formerly sallow parents-of-us-all now look wonderfully spruce, godly almost in their cleanliness.
"Who would have guessed that underneath all that glue and grime was flesh painted with such an extraordinarily delicate yet sensuous hand," said David Bull, head of paintings conservation at Washington's National Gallery of Art, agog under Eve.
The cleaning has brought out her two-toned nipples, lightened Adam's yellow mop of hair and returned to the serpent the golden-green glimmer of meaty coils.

   But these tonalities are still fairly discreet compared with the pastel hues emanating from the once-gloomy lunettes that decorate the window level.
Tidied up patriarchs and prophets fill these half-moon spaces, some in raspberry outfits not unlike the bulky sweater worn by Balthus, the painter of prurient pre-pubescents, who was hovering near the conservators' computer and had nothing to say except that he was not influenced by Michelangelo.

   Pushing a few buttons on the terminal, Mr. Colalucci called up the expulsion from paradise on his screen with the help of a speedy video mouse.
This mini-Michelangelo marked trouble spots in the ceiling as it went along.
Dirt was far from the only problem.
Water seepage has left a number of patches damaged by an efflorescence of salts; candles and oil lamps that once lit the gloomy chapel added a sooty smear.
And, probably in the 18th century, janitorial squads slathered animal glue on the vault with long poles to brighten the darkening colors.
The faint of heart will not want to read about the enterprising fellow who scrubbed away with a mixture of stale bread and retsina.

   "Not surprisingly Michelangelo's ceiling entered our consciousness long ago as a dark, mysterious object," says Kathleen Weil-Garris Brandt, a professor at New York University's Institute of Fine Arts and a regular visitor to the platform.
Like most scholars of Renaissance art, she's ready to see Michelangelo as a painter of his time, with a color sense gleaned from his teacher Domenico Ghirlandaio and then filtered on to such younger artists as Pontormo and Rosso Fiorentino, whose paintings blaze with unusual colors.

   And why ever not?
Even someone without a Ph.D. might wonder why Michelangelo would have darkened his colors so dramatically only five years after having painted the Doni Madonna's glacial blues.
Perhaps his abilities as a painter are best attested to by that other titan, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.
On the Italian journey that he described in a classic journal and illustrated with memorable sketches, Goethe ate a picnic lunch in the Sistina in 1786 and noted down some comments by artists he met: "In addition to the other qualities they admired, they said that he surpassed all others in his sense of color and it became the fashion to dispute whether he or Raphael was the greater genius."

   That isn't how our artists see it.
Along with a handful of Italian and American historians, they claim that the conservators are scrubbing away l'ultima mano -- the final veil-like layer supposedly applied by Michelangelo on the completed ceiling.
But where is the proof for this layer?
Certainly not in the biographies of Condivi or of Vasari, who reports that Michelangelo "complained that because of the pope's haste he could not finish it as he would."
And anyhow, this never-spun veil would very likely have been a bit of aquamarine and the brightening gold that Julius II was always nagging him to use.

   Beyond the hard evidence favoring color over crepuscule is common sense.
Michelangelo's subject was the coming of light into this world, the creation of the visible heavens.
The protesting artists seem to have forgotten that Genesis says: "Let there be light."
But from the Sistine scaffold, one saw convincing proof that Michelangelo had not meant to blacken the eternal noon of Paradise.

   "The people making this witless protest are almost criminal in my opinion," said John Brealey, chairman of the conservation department at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.
"If this cleaning is suddenly abandoned it will be a catastrophe."
Along with five other conservators, among them the National Gallery's Mr. Bull and the Getty's Andrea Rothe, he has signed a statement issued by the Kress Foundation indicating his full support of the project.

   The experts hesitated with their endorsement only long enough to descend to earth safely, among the tourist groundlings with their Instamatics snapping the newfound incandescence above, more luminous than it has been since Michelangelo put down his brush.

   Since medieval times, the Louvre has evolved from a turreted fairy-tale castle to a stiff-backed royal palace to a rambling pile of galleries rendered charmless by noisy crowds and by I.M. Pei's pyramidal glass entrance.
So why go and be miserable when you can sit down in a comfortable, quiet place with Lawrence Gowing's "Paintings in the Louvre" (Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, 687 pages, $75 through December; $85 next year)?
Even in the unlikely event that the galleries are ever substantially refurbished and enlarged, there won't be room for all of the 800 paintings that fill this fat volume, many in full color and looking better than they will next year if people keep breathing on them.
And who among those umbrella-waving, inanity-yelling guides is a match for Mr. Gowing, sly wit, great eye that he is.

   A propos of a portrait of French king Jean Le Bon by an anonymous late-14th-century artist, he writes:

   "Nothing this inept monarch ever did became him so well as this commission, with which he inaugurated French painting."
Like the Louvre itself, this big book is, in its medium, the fullest possible single-stop introduction to French painting.
But there is much more from other countries: from Germany five panels by Hans Holbein.
From Italy, Titian's glowing "Lady at Her Toilet" is a chic opposite to the Louvre's most famous resident, Leonardo da Vinci's dowdy Mona Lisa.
She, too, looks better in the book than smiling from behind bullet-proof glass and people taller than you.

   "Peter Paul Rubens" (Yale University Press, 310 pages, $65), by Christopher White: No Rubens lover ever overdoses on billowing buttocks or thighs or flanks or breasts, falling and rising like a sea swell.
Mr. White obliges with more scenes from the Louvre's Marie de Medici cycle, which Rubens painted in the 1620s for Louis XIV's quarrelsome grandmother.
Loyal, handsome, erudite and immensely energetic, this diplomat and master painter of the high baroque left a trail of happy clients and jealous second-raters.
As indefatigable as his subject, Mr. White discusses the painter in the broader context of his times, and in the more intimate settings he came to prefer when, already 53 years old, he married Helena Fourment, whose buxom teen-age body soon filled many of his canvases with its sensuous amplitude.

   "Louis XIV" (Doubleday, 373 pages, $19.95) by Olivier Bernier, who discusses among other things why Louis loathed Paris (he never forgot how in his extreme youth when he had barely begun to twinkle, horrible Fronde mutineers had stomped through his bedroom, tossing the furniture around) and how he made sure nobody would ever say boo to him again (by building Versailles, a "golden hive" designed to trap princes and powerful aristocrats, sever them from provincial power bases and turn them into fawning ninnies he controlled with monosyllables and the wave of a hand).
Though Versailles is often described as a costly, budget-breaking conceit, Mr. Bernier argues the cage was cheap -- less than 1/15th of the money the sun king spent on his various wars.

   "The Emperors' Album" (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 318 pages, $65), a collection of 50 paintings of Mughal India started by the 17th-century emperor Jahangir and completed in the 19th century by a New Delhi dealer.
Like royalty everywhere, the Mughals loved to see themselves in pictures, and since neither drinking nor opium eating dimmed their appreciation of good art, these miniature paintings are pretty fabulous.
Look at Jahangir, "Queller of Revolutions" and quite a swell in his pink pantaloons and snazzy buffalo buckler.
His son, Shahjahan, not to be outdone, presents himself standing on top of the world in a portrait called "Master of the Globe."

   They were fierce in battle, these Mughals, before booze diluted their blood, but they also loved flowers and animals in their palaces and in their paintings.
The album includes Mansur's famous portrait of the gorgeous nilgai buck who had dodged Jahangir's shots for two years before ending up in a stew and in this album, looking dewy-eyed.
There is also an unusual portrait of Jahangir's father, Akbar the Great, whose fascination with European culture is reflected in Govardhan's perspectival landscape and in the Raphaelesque putti who tootle his praises from the sky above.

   "Later Chinese Painting and Calligraphy" (Random House, three volumes, $850) by Robert Hatfield Ellsworth, who brings a fresh eye and decades of study to works long despised and ignored as the withered products of an atrophied sensibility.
The 541 full-color reproductions of scrolls, fans and album leaves suggest however, that such time-honored subjects as cats, flowering branches, mountain ranges and meditating monks still could stir the brushes of artists laboring quietly in their studios as the Manchu dynasty crumbled into the 20th century.
But given the price of this handsomely bound box set, Mr. Ellsworth's revisionary tome will hardly win converts outside the small realm of well-heeled China buffs.

   "Biedermeier Painting" (Thames &amp; Hudson, 192 pages $45) by Geraldine Norman: There never was anybody named Biedermeier.
Two German poets made up the name to poke fun at simple, cozy, small-town life.
Not until the end of the 19th century did the funny word come to describe the sunny, narcoleptic decades between the defeat of Napoleon and the revolutions of 1848 (and it took more than an additional 100 years to make the dainty furniture high style).
These "gemutlich" paintings are by Germans, Austrians and Danes: Many proper-looking women wearing bonnets; many sunny landscapes filled with fat sheep.
But some of these artists tired of the small pleasures of the hearth and views through open windows.
They escaped to Italy, to outdoor taverns and sloe-eyed models, also represented here.
Ms. Norman's unfussy prose nicely complements the illustrations.

   "James Abbott McNeill Whistler" (Abrams, 160 pages, $35) by John Walker, director emeritus of Washington's National Gallery: A man given to odd titles, an exquisite style and pointed bon mots that made Oscar Wilde's jowls wobble jealously, Whistler is always a diverting subject, even if Mr. Walker has nothing particularly new to say about him. (Actually, the wittiest Whistler mot comes from the mouth of Degas, who, seeing Whistler enter a restaurant decked out in an outfit dandified even for him, scolded him: "Whistler, you have forgotten your muff.")
The glossy reproductions include the portrait of Mother Whistler, the most famous female painted in this country before Helga, and the "Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket" -- which John Ruskin described as a pot of paint flung into the public's face.
To this, Whistler replied with a libel action that eventually helped turn him into an impoverished shadow shuffling through London in a nightshirt and frayed coat.

   "Toulouse-Lautrec" (Thames and Hudson, 336 pages, $60), by Gotz Adriani: The seedy glitter of Montmartre's bars, dance halls and whore houses in 100 pictures by a sharp-eyed habitue who often took several suitcases into his favorite bordello for month-long visits.
The pictures he painted there reveal his sympathy for women whom fortune had not favored either and who didn't mind that his legs were quite a bit shorter than his very long family tree (back to the Crusades).
The biographical documentation chapter completing Mr. Adriani's learned study includes unusually interesting photographs of Lautrec's favorite bordello in the rue de Moulins, a place scenically outfitted with a Gothic-style torture room.

   Art From All Over in the Time of Columbus

   Washington, D.C. -- In the current hail of attacks on
European civilization, it has seldom been observed that the
modish current antidote to Eurocentrism -- multiculturalism
-- is itself a modern European notion that dates to the Age
of Exploration. As the philosopher Leszek Kolakowski has
pointed out, modern European culture developed a
self-critical faculty that is generally lacking in other
societies, and it is this self-critical faculty that impels
us to take a sympathetic interest in the cultures of others.
   This same spirit is the guiding force in the National
Gallery of Art's huge and splendid exhibition, "Circa 1492:
Art in the Age of Exploration." Although one might have
expected such a show to focus on images of exploration in
general, and on the discovery of America in particular, it in
fact presents an overview of art from all around the world at
a particularly rich time for world art. So it is less focused
than its title implies, but much more challenging and
stimulating. Its narrow chronological limits do not prevent
it from offering a remarkably wide sampling of masterpieces
or from paying complex tribute to the astonishing richness of
human thought and expression.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Like the early European explorers, the exhibition starts
in Mediterranean Europe and eventually covers much of the
world, radiating out to the Near East, Africa, Asia and the
Americas, in that order. The European section is further
broken down into a number of thematic subsections, which
explore the contrasts between spiritual and secular power and
give particular attention to crucial areas of scientific
inquiry, such as measurement and map making, linear
perspective, and anatomically accurate representations of the
human figure.
   There is an immense variety of artistic expression from
all regions, but the pictures and objects have been chosen
for their very high quality as much as for the intellectual
points they make. This is an encyclopedic undertaking, but a
staggering number of the entries are also among the greatest
masterpieces of each of the many cultures.
   Some of the greatest artists of all time were alive during
this period, and a number of them are represented here in
considerable strength. The Europe section, for example,
includes a gallery filled with drawings, prints and paintings
by the quintessential artist-scientists Albrecht Durer and
Leonardo da Vinci. They alone would make this a memorable
exhibition.
   Leonardo's exquisite and haunting "Lady With an Ermine"
dominates this masterpiece-filled room. It is a mysterious
early portrait from the Czartoryski Museum in Krakow, which
is being shown for the first time in this country.
   The European section also includes works by Hieronymus
Bosch, Michelangelo, Donatello, Botticelli and Piero della
Francesca -- every one of them worth serious time and
attention. The visitor is advised to plan a whole day for
this show, with a lunch break between Europe and the rest of
the world.
   So, having made a morning of the European Renaissance at
its most energetic (with some crucial nods made to the
Ottoman Empire), one enters the Japanese section. From a
world in its intellectual adolescence, one encounters a
mature culture. The centerpiece here is the work of Sesshu
Toyo, one of the greatest Japanese painters. His landscape
scrolls of the four seasons combine an extraordinary mixture
of lyrical subtlety and electric force.
   The section on Ming China includes an excellent selection
of works by Shen Zhou, whose richly articulated landscapes
are among the high points of Chinese painting.
   Nor does the level of quality decline in the sections
devoted to cultures whose major artists have remained
anonymous. The African gallery contains some of the most
celebrated masterpieces of Benin sculpture, such as the
famous "Hornblower" from the British Museum. The majestic
Hispano-Moresque "Admiral" heraldic carpet is arguably the
finest of its kind. And among the American works is the
powerful life-size basalt sculpture of the seated god
Xochipilli, one of the great masterpieces of Aztec sculpture.
It literally stops you dead in your tracks.
   The exhibition also contains an impressive number of less
well-known works of equally high quality. Notable among these
is the beautifully detailed and moving "Panel of the Infante"
from the Altarpiece of the Veneration of Saint Vincent by the
Portuguese painter Nuno Goncales. It is one of the unexpected
highlights of the show. Another little-known treasure is the
large multi-figured polychromed sculpture of a "Lamentation"
by the San Pablo de la Moraleja Master, whose lyrical
Northern European realism is tempered by a grave Spanish
austerity. There are also stunning examples of Chinese and
Japanese calligraphy, some beautiful Korean ceramics with
luminous, lunar glazes, and a number of fine small sculptures
and gold ornaments from the Caribbean and Central America.
All of it is very handsomely installed in settings that
discreetly evoke the architectural ambiance appropriate to
the art.
   The exhibition is even more than simply a collection of
well-displayed masterpieces. It also includes a number of
manuscripts, maps and functional objects that evoke the ways
in which human knowledge was evolving at this time. The very
first thing you see is a Catalan atlas by Abraham Cresques,
which in its quaint combination of geographical and cultural
facts and fancies gives a nice sense of how the human mind,
when pressed for information that it doesn't have, has a
strong tendency just to make things up.
   In fact, preconceived images frequently resist actual
knowledge. When Durer did his famous woodcut of a rhinoceros,
he had never seen one and so he rendered the beast with an
extra horn and armor-plated skin. So powerful was this
imaginary image that centuries later even artists who had
seen real rhinoceroses continued to represent them as Durer
had.
   The exhibition is full of interesting insights about how
knowledge is represented and conveyed. In some cases, you
also have to read between the lines and ponder what is
absent. There are, for example, very few Islamic or Chinese
works that directly represent the technological advances that
so interested the Europeans. But this is not simply another
example of Western technological superiority. As it happens,
Islamic and Chinese science were so far in advance of the
West at this time that science was no longer of direct
interest to artists from those cultures. By 1492, they were
preoccupied with other things.
   In the last analysis, though, the most impressive thing
about this exhibition is the rich sense it conveys of the
amazing variety and depth of human expression. As I wandered
up and back through this intriguing show, I kept thinking of
Hamlet's words to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern: "What a piece
of work is a man] How noble in reason] How infinite in
faculties] In form and moving how express and admirable] In
action how like an angel] In apprehension how like a god] The
beauty of the world, the paragon of animals." But the prince,
as you will remember, was in a pessimistic mood, and
concluded, "And yet to me what is this quintessence of dust?"
   While I was pondering this contradiction, I stopped before
a portrait of the Chinese master Shen Zhou, who in his old
age had inscribed the following poem on the painting: "Is it
like or not like, true or not true? From bottom to top it
only reflects the exterior man. Death and life are both a
dream, And heaven and earth are entirely dust."
   The exhibition, which is up until Jan. 12 and will not
travel, is accompanied by an appropriately grand and
informative catalog, edited by Jay A. Levenson, the managing
curator of the exhibition. It is sponsored by a multinational
consortium, which includes Ameritech, Nomura Securities
Co./Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank and Republic National Bank of New
York. Additional support came from Banco Exterior de Espana
(Grupo CBE), Fiat S.p.A. and the Rockefeller Foundation.
Advance passes are available at the National Gallery and
nationwide through Ticketmaster and Hecht stores.

FT  09 OCT 92 / Arts: Bassano honours its most famous son - Exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most Renaissance artists, like Leonardo da Vinci, only came to be named
after their home towns as a result of leaving them. Jacopo da Ponte - known
as Bassano - is the great exception. He spent most of his working life in
and around the small town of Bassano in the Veneto, apparently making the
45km trip to Venice only once. Despite that, after Titian and along with
Veronese and Tintoretto, he was one of the most influential and inventive
Venetian painters of the 16th century.
Bassano del Grappa is honouring its most famous and loyal of sons on the
400th anniversary of his death with the first monographic exhibition of the
artist since 1957. The town has even spent some L1.5bn overhauling its
museum's security, lighting and climate control systems in order to secure
substantial foreign loans. The show is co-sponsored by the Kimbell Art
Museum in Fort Worth, and a version of it, comprising fewer - and some
different - oils plus more drawings, opens in Texas in January.
The exhibition's achievements are considerable. As one might expect,
pictures have been gathered together from far-flung and unlikely corners of
the globe - from Ottowa to the Alvar Aalto Museum in Jyvaskyla. Assiduous
sleuthing has uncovered a number of previously unknown works which add to
our understanding of the artist.
Most intriguingly, however, the show is witness to the developing
sensibility of a provincial painter as sensitive as litmus paper to what he
could glean, through pictures or prints, of current artistic practice. As
this impressive display amply reveals, Bassano was fortunate enough to live
in, and to have been inspired by, a great age of Venetian painting.
We find him first in a 'Flight into Egypt', dated to 1534, a painting of
considerable nave charm. The figures moving frieze-like across the picture
plane have the monumentality of Giotto and the palette of fresco, and indeed
derive from the frescoes in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua; the Madonna and
Child come courtesy of a Titian fresco in Venice.
Within a decade, he has plunged into the maelstrom of Venetian Mannerism.
Compositions are crowded, complex and urgent, with figures boldly cropped
and foreshortened. 'The Adoration of the Magi' from Edinburgh, arguably his
masterpiece, is a virtuoso performance of arrested action, sharp-edged
clarity and harshly sumptuous Venetian colour. Drawing on the theatricality
of Pordenone and, via Schiavone, on the elongated forms of Parmigianino, he
is now bang up to date.
In many ways Bassano is a remarkable artist. Most importantly, he
established the genre of the pastoral landscape.
From the first he had favoured Biblical subjects that allowed him to paint
humble rustic folk and their animals in the landscape, often at night.
Gradually the subject of the picture slips into secondary importance, so
that in a 'Sacrifice of Noah', for example, one has to search the middle
distance for a minute Noah and his flaming altar.
It was only a short step to dispensing with religious subject-matter
altogether - and to the pioneering series of landscapes which represent the
four seasons or the four elements through the depiction of peasants at work
in the countryside. A large and broadly executed canvas of two hunting dogs,
painted for their own sake, and set against a lowering evening sky with the
imposing Monte del Grappa in the distance, is also virtually unique in
16th-century art.
As a draughtsman, Bassano is perhaps no less original. At about the same
time as Federico Barocci in Urbino, he is covering large sheets of rough
blue paper with bold figure studies in dashing combinations of coloured
chalks.
Bassano is, however, a peculiarly uneven artist. Anatomy is often weak, and
execution frequently careless. Moreover, he tends towards the formulaic. Is
this also the consequence of workshop mentality and practice? Certainly
Jacopo, both son and father of painters, clearly regarded painting as a
family business, and the family workshop's production-line continued to
churn out lamentable Jacopo pastiches well into the 17th century.
It was, however, considered perfectly acceptable for a master at the head of
a busy workshop to re-use and re-combine particularly effective figures and
motifs - the premium on originality is a prejudice of our own age. That
said, the relentlessness of the repetition does suggest a lack of
imagination or intellectual curiosity. One reclining male figure, for
instance, is variously Lazarus, St John the Baptist, a vanquished soldier,
Joseph, and any number of shepherds.
Bassano is also curiously old-fashioned. His habit of combining unrelated
Biblical events flouts pictorial credibility: we find St Jerome deep in his
books as Christ on the Cross behind him gushes blood and the Marys weep. St
Anthony Abbot similarly fails to notice the commotion beside him as the
mounted St Martin slices his cloak in half in order to share it with the
beggar.
The museum's third gallery reveals the malign influence of his son Francesco
who has a penchant for the sootiest of night scenes implausibly stuffed with
chaotic mounds of copper pots and pans. It is hard not to heave a sigh of
great relief when Francesco decides to move to Venice in 1579.
Thereafter, Jacopo seems to have recaptured the spark that animated the
paintings of the '40s and '50s. His last religious works are indisputably
his most powerful. In an almost monochromatic, torchlit 'Christ Crowned with
Thorns', the rapidly executed figures of the suffering Christ and his
tormentors barely emerge out of an oppressive darkness. The picture has a
ghostliness and a profundity which echo the late works of his most enduring
influence, Titian.
'Jacopo Bassano' continues at the Museo Civico, Bassano del Grappa, until
December 6, and shows at the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, Texas, January
23-April 25. Italian and English editions of the catalogue are published by
Nuova Alfa Editoriale.

ART: LACMA'S 'TREASURES FROM THE FITZWILLIAM,' TAKEN FROM THE MUSEUM AT
CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY, ILLUSTRATES THE MARCH OF ART THROUGH THE CENTURIES.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Titian, Rubens, Rembrandt, Hogarth, Delacroix, Degas -- given the list of
stellar names from the pantheon in Western art history, it might seem odd to
choose Francois-Xavier Fabre as the artist to represent the highly engaging
exhibition, "Treasures From the Fitzwilliam Museum: The Increase of Learning
and other great Objects of that Noble Foundation."
</P>
<P>
But that's just what its organizers did. Through the reproduction of a Fabre
portrait on the covers of both the catalogue and the press kit, and with pride
of place for the painting in the gallery installation, the show -- which opened
Thursday at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (to Sept. 9) -- surprisingly
features a relatively obscure artist as its metaphoric poster boy.
</P>
<P>
The choice might be surprising, but it also turns out to be appropriate. The
reason is that the Fitzwilliam, the first great university museum ever, has
more on its mind than merely toting up celebrated names.
</P>
<P>
The museum was established in 1816 by Richard, seventh Viscount Fitzwilliam of
Merrion, with a bequest to Cambridge University of his art collections and
library, and a sum of money to care for both. (A sweet portrait of 19-year-old
Richard, by the often eccentric Joseph Wright of Derby, hangs in the show.) The
aim, according to the bequest, was to promote "the Increase of Learning and
other great Objects of that Noble Foundation." The selection at LACMA, which
numbers more than 160 items, suggests the diversity and scope of that intent.
</P>
<P>
The earliest object is a delicate, incised drawing of a reindeer on a small,
thin shard of limestone, dating from the Paleolithic period (about 12000 BC).
The latest is also a drawing -- a 1918 pencil study of an actress wearing a
large hat, by Amadeo Modigliani.
</P>
<P>
In between are Asian, Middle Eastern and, mostly, European decorative arts,
paintings, sculptures, coins, prints and many more drawings. Not everything is
first-rate. The graceful Paleolithic reindeer may be regarded as among the
finest examples of naturalistic art to have survived the ages, but the
Modigliani is at best indifferent.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the celebrated names can't always be counted on to deliver celebrated
works. Antoine Watteau's delicate chalk study of a man playing a flute falls
apart in the crude rendering of the hands, while the Renoir painting of a
street scene is, typically, a chromatic mess (the otherwise sensible catalogue
wildly claims that it compares to "Luncheon of the Boating Party," far and away
Renoir's finest painting). In the museum's historical chain, the 19th-Century
holdings constitute the weakest link, forming a perfunctory coda to the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
But individual excellence is not the only reason a museum -- especially a
university museum -- assembles a collection. The Watteau drawing claims
historical significance, serving as the model for figures in more than one
painting by this important artist, while the Renoir is in part instructive
simply because it dates from the same period as his great boating picture. As
for the 19th-Century slump, it suggests the difficulty in making sense of
contemporaneous, as opposed to historical, artistic events -- a difficulty
common to any number of museums.
</P>
<P>
Still, the gold far outweighs the dross in the galleries. The hard, jewel-like
color of Bassano's early mannerist "Journey to Calvary" (circa 1540) gets my
wholly arbitrary vote for Best of Show, while the furiously flailing limbs of
Titian's monumental image of rape, "Tarquin and Lucretia" (1568-71), create a
disturbing dramatic spectacle.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Peter Paul Rubens' small oil on copper, "The Death of Hippolytus"
(circa 1611), is as startlingly fresh as if it had been painted last week.
Carlo Dolci's 17th-Century portrait of a contemplative scholar -- a fitting
subject for a museum at Cambridge -- carries what is surely the most
beautifully painted shirt collar ever: Like frosted glass, the translucent
cloth creates a dazzling shadow play for the silver cloak tassel it conceals.
</P>
<P>
The five medieval manuscripts and the many small bronzes -- especially an
astonishing 2nd-Century BC figure of a drunken Hercules, which is believed to
have been broken off the shoulder of a vessel -- are almost uniformly fine. And
for those whose sensibilities are easily offended, here's a friendly warning:
Avoid at all costs William Hogarth's delightful pair of paintings, "Before" and
"After." They're raucously engaging images of a courtly lad and lass, but the
bracketed event in question would doubtless make Jesse Helms apoplectic.
</P>
<P>
The sensitively installed show is slightly marred by an annoying glare in the
main gallery, which makes unobstructed viewing of the large Titian, Van Dyck,
Guercino and Salvator Rosa difficult at best. (A makeshift space, carved from
the well of the Ahmanson Building's atrium, the room has no ceiling to support
adequate lighting.) Still, "Treasures of the Fitzwilliam" demonstrates
something pivotal about the foundations of the modern era, something its
"poster boy" makes plain.
</P>
<P>
Francois-Xavier Fabre was a fashionable and successful painter of the late 18th
and early 19th centuries. A student of the great neo-classical master,
Jacques-Louis David, he won the requisite prize for any aspiring French artist
-- the Premier Grand Prix de Rome -- and promptly left for Italy. He meant to
insert himself as the inevitable destination for the on-going march of history
and civilization: Imperial Rome to Renaissance Italy to the neo-classical turn
of the 19th Century.
</P>
<P>
Fabre's aristocratic portrait of a gentleman, "Allen Smith Seated Above the
Arno, Contemplating Florence" (1797) is about as straightforward a declaration
of this path of ascent as could be imagined. The actual identity of the sitter
has long been in dispute (recent speculation is that he was American, not
British), but clearly this tourist was a man of means. The picture's
composition derives from a famous portrait of Goethe, with a notable
difference: Smith's head, formally posed as a refined profile, is reminiscent
of an ancient cameo. He is seated on a crude block of stone decorated with
Egyptian hieroglyphs, a ruined Corinthian capital at his feet and the
Renaissance city Florence spread out before his steady gaze.
</P>
<P>
Dressed in period clothes and powdered wig, Smith is also wrapped in a tunic
that approximates a Greek chiton or a Roman toga. The loping arches of a bridge
that spans the Arno form a rhythmic procession leading gently to the graceful
curve of the sitter's hand -- a sitter who has thus been deftly cast by Fabre
as a living bridge to the classical past.
</P>
<P>
Although acquired by the Fitzwilliam only in this century, the painting's 1797
date is roughly coincident with the university museum's 1816 founding. The
impulse that fueled one also fueled the other. It's easy to see the
appropriateness of Mr. Smith as "poster boy" for this illuminating exhibition.

RE-CREATIONS: LAGUNA BEACH'S ANNUAL PAGEANT OF THE MASTERS IS A SURREAL,
SOMETIMES QUIRKY BUT UNDENIABLY MESMERIZING TRIBUTE TO GREAT ARTWORKS.

LAGUNA BEACH
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smeared with blue-green greasepaint, a naked young woman stands posed on stage
while Tony the Tiger tells an audience that the "uninhibited freedom" of her
orgiastic cult is "pure and radiant."
</P>
<P>
Has some kind of smutty pagan/cornflake performance art taken over Laguna
Beach's Irvine Bowl? Nope, it's just the Pageant of the Masters in a
neoclassical moment, waxing idyllic about a bronze sculpture of a maenad that
once decorated a private fountain.
</P>
<P>
With Thurl Ravenscroft, the voice of the cereal-pitching tiger, providing
narration, the 57th annual edition of the "living pictures" show unfolded
Saturday, a surreal melange of art and stagecraft, pretentious, kitschy,
sometimes cloying and -- undeniably -- mesmerizing.
</P>
<P>
Using live models to pose in blown-up, brilliant copies of paintings, sculpture
and decorative arts, the pageant inevitably produces a spectacle. The
re-creations are like a television screen or a train wreck: It's nearly
impossible to take one's eyes off them.
</P>
<P>
They display a virtuosity in almost every theatrical craft. In fact, the
pageant is a theater technician's fantasy land: It is perhaps the only
production in which the skills of set painters, costumers, makeup experts and
lighting technicians literally take center stage, free from the shackles of a
playwright's script or an actor's ego.
</P>
<P>
However, since it lacks any dramatic content, the pageant's impact is as
ephemeral as a fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
In choosing their repertoire, pageant directors carefully sift the artistic
heritage of the world to remove anything remotely disturbing or challenging,
leaving little but a collection of pleasant decorations.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the pageant's 23-piece program leans heavily on sentimental paintings
by obscure 19th- and 20th-Century artists, along with a smattering of
historical artifacts and more familiar works. This year's survey of famous art
includes a Monet, a Matisse and Emanuel Leutze's "Washington Crossing the
Delaware."
</P>
<P>
Pop art is represented by Jules Cheret's fin de siecle posters for a Parisian
ice skating rink. Tex-Mex sculptor Luis Jimenez is the token modern artist
included, while exotica is handled with a display of antique Japanese festival
dolls. The affair closes with the pageant's traditional finale, Leonardo da
Vinci's "The Last Supper."
</P>
<P>
The program moves more briskly than would be seemly in any museum; a few
minutes of Ravenscroft's reading Dan Duling's reasonably informative script, a
few minutes of eye strain to see if the models are breathing, and on to the
next piece. No time here to contemplate the eternal verities of the muses.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, one does have two hours to contemplate how they make a
three-dimensional reality look like a two-dimensional painting trying to look
like a three-dimensional reality. There's room in the world for at least one
Pageant of the Masters.
</P>

FROM BELLINI TO BRAQUE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bernard Barryte
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a long and prolific career, Giovanni Bellini (early 1430s-1516) oversaw
the transition in Venice from the International Gothic style to the High
Renaissance style perfected by Titian, his pupil. The succession of Bellini's
masterpieces reveal a suave mastery of color and a profound enthusiasm for
landscape that constitute his artistic legacy.
</P>
<P>
Unlike earlier authors who describe the artist's life and works in
chronological sequence, Rona Goffen, who is Distinguished Professor of Art
History at Rutgers, has adopted an unusual, fugal format in GIOVANNI BELLINI
(Yale University Press: $60; 355 pp.) . In separate chapters, she traces the
evolution of his private devotional images, public altarpieces, portraits, and
secular and mythological subjects. Although some redundancy is unavoidable,
this strategy highlights the characteristics that are unique in Bellini's
treatment of each genre while emphasizing common trends.
</P>
<P>
Goffen focuses less on stylistic issues and more on content than her
predecessors. Supported by a detailed examination of their iconography,
Goffen's reading of Bellini's spiritual paintings is especially acute and
sensitive. Though she offers a lucid description of the intellectual and social
context in which they were created, her discussion of his mythological
paintings is more tentative. Although it is possible to quibble over occasional
details, this thoroughly documented and generously illustrated volume is
written in a manner as accessible as Bellini's paintings and should be a
delight to the amateur and connoisseur alike.
</P>
<P>
Inspired by a visit to the Spanish Riding School in Vienna and the product of
11 years research, THE ROYAL HORSE AND RIDER: Painting, Sculpture and
Horsemanship 1500-1800 (Abaris Books: $59.50; 336 pp.) offers an innovative and
fascinating survey of equestrian portraits and monuments created between
1500-1800. Because these images mirror the most distinctive activity of the
ruling class, the book also offers new insight into the self-image and ideals
of European's aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
In a lucid and meticulously documented essay, Walter Leidtke, curator of Dutch
and Flemish paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, traces the evolution
of the genre in terms of both pictorial style and social significance. To
reacquaint most of us with now forgotten subtleties of horsemanship, the book
includes a helpful essay on "Riding in the Renaissance and Baroque Period" by
Alexander Mackay-Smith, curator and chairman of the board at the National
Sporting Library in Middleburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
Leidtke suggests that equestrian portraits resumed their classical importance
during the Renaissance. Antique prototypes were refined conceptually, though
not in practice, by Leonardo da Vinci. His ideas, however, provided the basis
for the accomplishments of Giambologna and Pietro Tacca, Florentine sculptors
active in the second half of the 16th Century. They developed an image of the
mounted ruler that matured in the 17th Century into a dynamic symbol of public
authority. Giving greatest emphasis to the masterpieces of Rubens, Velazquez,
and Van Dyck, Leidtke adds new depth to our understanding of individual
paintings while clarifying the artistic relationships between the artists.
</P>
<P>
A subtext of this discussion is Leidtke's thesis that "equestrian portraits and
monuments of the late 16th and 17th centuries are intimately related in form
and meaning to the contemporary art of riding." Making effective use of prints,
especially those recording the "airs" of haute ecole horsemanship that spread
from Italy throughout Europe during this period, Leidtke specifically
identifies the equine movements depicted in the portraits. These details are
given broad significance, especially in his second chapter which analyzes the
symbolic connotations of the equestrian portrait. Liedtke's essay, supported by
a rich bibliography, offers new material for interpreting Baroque portraits. It
may also serve as a successful model for the integration of social and art
history.
</P>
<P>
Pierre Skira's STILL LIFE: A History (Skira/Rizzoli: $85; 240 pp.) is a far
less successful genre survey. Although this genre, too, dates back to
antiquity, it has suffered from relative scholarly neglect in spite of the
almost hypnotic appeal exerted by many of the images and the plethora of
masterpieces produced by many of our greatest artists. In part, this neglect is
due to that fact that the still life -- defined by the absence of humanity and
focusing largely on the detritus of life -- was considered ignoble by the
Greeks and occupied the lowest position in the hierarchy of genres formalized
by 17th-Century academicians.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately this volume fails to fill the void. It does not supersede Charles
Sterling's "Still Life Painting From Antiquity to the Present Time" (1959)
which, regrettably, was reprinted in 1981 with only black-and-white
illustrations.
</P>
<P>
Ostensibly tracing the history of the genre from its tentative appearance on
the walls of Egyptian tombs to the present, the text meanders on the periphery
of narrative, failing to deliver the chronological analysis promised by the
title. Instead, the text offers only the prolix ruminations of the author,
which fail to suggest the magic, beauty, or significance of the images under
consideration. The text is enlivened, however, by occasional vivid descriptions
("the incandescent pears and marmoreal cheese of Nicolaes Gillis") as well as
by seemingly random digressions on various themes. A seven-page excursus on the
pomegranate (in which a capricious choice of allusions is undocumented) left me
bewildered as I pondered the meaning of such statements as: "Thus the
pomegranates, in the ardor of their demonstration, draw from the depths of a
dark autism, a nourishing, equivocal action, between the disquieting figure of
Hera and the taste of Delights." Can one blame the translation from the French?
</P>
<P>
That Skira, a practicing still-life painter, has a passionate enthusiasm for
the subject is evident in the way he guides the reader's eye in a detailed
reading of various compositions. Unfortunately, such useful exercises only
occasionally interrupt a text hampered by the author's habit of piling up
synonyms and adjectives the way Frans Snyders piles up slaughtered animals.
</P>
<P>
This book is disappointing because still life, with its long history, deserves
more insightful analysis. Although there are now useful studies of the
still-life tradition in Italy, France, Spain, Holland, and America, there
exists in English no survey incorporating new research scattered in articles
and catalogues. Until an appropriate volume appears, however, the curious
reader is advised to use Sterling's text and refer to Skira's volume only for
its gorgeous illustrative material.
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline and Maurice Guillaud, who became famous in France for their
startling and idiosyncratic exhibition installations, have translated their
innovations into book format.
</P>
<P>
RAPHAEL: Grace of an Angel (Guillaud Editions/Clarkson Potter: $100) is the
latest in a series devoted to the greatest painters and distinguished by
extraordinary reproductions. This volume is devoted to Raphael's major fresco
suites in the Vatican. Except for the brief essay on the conservation history
of these rooms by Fabrizio Mancinelli, director of Medieval, Byzantine, and
Modern Art department at the Museum of the Vatican, the text is minimal.
</P>
<P>
The book itself is an exercise in advanced printing technology. Unfortunately,
the novelty of the garishly colored dividing pages and diecut windows is
quickly wearing. These elements end by distracting from the crisp images which
have been otherwise left to speak for themselves. And they, of course, are
glorious.
</P>
<P>
The reproductions on the Guillaud's distinctive onionskin paper approximate the
surface appearance of the frescoes. The reader is left to pore over a multitude
of luscious details (although the order of plates is somewhat idiosyncratic)
that are otherwise inaccessible except to angels and conservators. For
biographical and interpretive information, look elsewhere. This expensive book
is useful, however, in facilitating an appreciation for Raphael's matchless
artistry.
</P>
<P>
The extravagantly illustrated FRANS HALS (Prestel Books/te Neues Publishing:
$60; 437 pp.) is the catalogue published in association with a dazzling
retrospective exhibition that opened recently at the National Gallery in
Washington, D.C. The show travels to London and concludes at the Frans
Halsmuseum in Haarlem, where the painter spent his career.
</P>
<P>
Edited by Harvard professor Seymour Slive, author of the three-volume Hals
catalogue raisonne (1970-74) as well as the richly informative entries
describing the 86 pictures in the exhibition, the book includes the first
English translation of Arnold Houbraken's biography of the artist (1718), a
valuable compilation of 190 documents, and a series of authoritative essays
describing his patrons, their clothing, and the artist's working methods.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps most interesting for the amateur is the essay by Frances Jowell, which
summarizes the critical fortunes of the painter. Though his reputation today
rivals that of his younger contemporaries Rembrandt and Vermeer, Hals
(1582/3-1666) died in poverty after enjoying continuous patronage during his
life. He was quickly forgotten and his paintings relegated to attics when his
vigorous brushwork was no longer fashionable. Credit for his rediscovery must
go to Theophile Thore, who in the mid-19th Century recognized Hals as "the true
predecessor of the realism just beginning to come into fashion".
</P>
<P>
Characterized by this critic as an "adroit swashbuckler" who "painted as if
fencing," Hals' ineffable capacity to capture the "essential vitality of his
sitters" and his unrivaled virtuosity in giving form and vibrancy with the
merest brush stroke influenced artists as distinct as Manet, Van Gogh, and John
Singer Sargent. They were impressed -- as we remain today -- by the uncanny
immediacy of the portraits to which Hals devoted his career, and they emulated
Hals' audacious technique for their diverse purposes.
</P>
<P>
With ravishing color plates (including a plenitude of details), the appearance
of this book is especially welcome today when contemporary artists are
experimenting again with painterly representation. In addition to providing a
large audience an opportunity to enjoy (vicariously) Hals' immensely
pleasurable paintings, it also provides a focus for studying the techniques of
a quintessential master of the loaded brush.
</P>
<P>
If the museum has sometimes been described as a laboratory, PICASSO AND BRAQUE:
Pioneering Cubism (Museum of Modern Art/Little, Brown: $70; 464 pp.) documents
what is unquestionably one of the most complex and rigorous experiments ever
performed at New York's Museum of Modern Art. The bulky catalogue is primarily
a picture book. Supported by a multitude of documentary photographs, it
includes hundreds of color reproductions of the paintings, drawings, sculpture,
collage, and papier colle created by Picasso and Braque between 1907-1914.
Gathered under the leadership of William Rubin, director emeritus of MoMA's
Department of Painting and Sculpture, they have been brought together for the
first time to help answer the myriad questions still surrounding the invention
of Cubism, which he describes as "the most passionate adventure in our
century's art."
</P>
<P>
Like the exhibition itself, the book provides material for studying the
formation of this style and its evolution from Analytic to Synthetic Cubism.
Conclusions resulting from the encounter with this material will be published
in a subsequent volume containing the proceedings of a seminar conducted by 20
specialists in the period.
</P>
<P>
Insisting that art historical judgments can be properly drawn only from direct
experience with the objects under consideration, Rubin's introduction merely
suggests "starting points for comparing the work of the two artists . . .
without attempting to engage prematurely those complex issues that the seminar
will confront when the works themselves" are present. The objects themselves
are given only minimal labels, but there is a meticulous 108-page "Documentary
Chronology" compiled by Judith Cousins.
</P>
<P>
In one sense, therefore, this is not a book for the timid. Whether elegant or
frivolous, the fragile studies and dense finished works that emerged from the
intellectual intercourse of Braque and Picasso are intensely thought-provoking
and there is in this volume no user-friendly analysis to guide the reader, who
is dumped squarely in medias res. However, this strategy has the benefit of
providing the adventurous with an opportunity to eavesdrop, as it were, on the
brief but immensely fruitful dialogue between two distinct and creative
personalities.

FT  30 OCT 92 / Arts: Inspirational images - Patricia Morison visits St
Jerome the penitent in the National Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
St Jerome's distinguishing marks in art are a cardinal's hat and a charming
lion. However, as a new exhibition at London's National Gallery shows,
merely being able to identify this white-bearded old saint does not take one
very far. St Jerome features more often in later medieval and Renaissance
art than any other personality of the Early Church. His popularity survived
the Reformation. Ribera, the 17th-century saint-specialist, painted no less
than 45 St Jeromes. What was it about St Jerome that for four centuries
secured his honoured place in Catholic art and piety?
Theme and Variations: Saint Jerome is the first of a new series of National
Gallery exhibitions which will 'examine themes' in paintings within the
collection - iconography, in other words. This is an extremely good idea and
one becoming fashionable as museum curators try to bridge the gap between an
atheistical, plain uneducated public and the standard repertoire of
Christian imagery and symbolism.
Not that an understanding of the repertoire is by any means the only key to
the appreciation of religious art. Think of the blatantly erotic appeal of
countless Venetian and Spanish images of female saints; knowing their
legends or even their names hardly matters, although it may add piquancy.
And yet, it would be perverse to deny that greater familiarity with
iconography leads to a keener enjoyment of the Old Masters and, almost as
importantly, of pedestrian or straightforwardly inept artists. At a glance
we recognise St Jerome (thanks to the lion, without which we could be
looking at St Augustine) as the great Doctor and Father of the western
Church, working on his Latin translation of the Bible. But only certain
artists could create an inspirational image - the man of intellect who,
oblivious to worldly distractions, is totally wrapped up in the Word of God.
Antonello da Messina was one such artist. In his perfect brown study of a
painting we see St Jerome's study framed within a monumental stone arch. The
scholar is seated in profile, a pose which conveys a certain hard-edged
disciplined quality of mind, one strengthened by the orderly arrangement of
books and implements on the shelves behind.
Putting this very famous painting with another 'St Jerome in his Study' by
the Venetian artist, Vincenzo Catena, helps us appreciate this far less
familiar painting as another wholly successful variation on the theme. Here,
too, are beautifully realised details - the slippers neatly placed by the
raised platform, (did Renaissance scholars take their shoes off because they
used foot-warmers?), the curtain at shoulder height to take the chill off
the stone wall. Whereas Antonello put the saint's study inside a church,
Vincenzo has created a real room, but made the most prominent object within
it the crucifix. Head bowed on his hand, the intellectual is Christ's humble
servant to Christ.
Giovanni Bellini (or someone in his workshop) looks back to St Jerome's few
years spent as a hermit in the Syrian desert. Here is the lion, to be sure,
but not the anachronistic cardinal's hat. The saint in his sky-blue tunic is
sitting on a rock, blissfully engaged in reading. However, that was Jerome
on a good day in the desert.
The saint's other main occupation, as he testified in his celebrated letter
to Julia Eustochium, one of his female admirers, was bruising his flesh on
the hard ground, fasting, letting his skin turn black as an Ethiopians and
beating his breast all night as he sought to extinguish the fires of lust
which still flickered in his aged loins.
For Jerome, one of the early Church's most ardent proponents of chastity,
the Devil lived in the loins and the navel (his euphemism for female private
parts). Many of the images in the exhibition showing Jerome the penitent
would, to the educated Christian who knew the letters, recall Jerome's
victory over his loins.
With such a rich theme and a smallish gallery, hung with no less than 16 St
Jeromes (there are 30 in the Gallery) some elements are missing and there
are some ellipses. It is not correct that Jerome went to the desert because
of his famous dream, in which he was punished for his attachment to reading
Cicero. We should have been told more about Jeronimite monasteries of the
15th century, and more about the saint as a symbol of penitence in
Counter-Reformation, especially in the light of the one, quite magnificent
loan to the exhibition: Georges de la Tour's 'St Jerome in Penitence' from
Stockholm.
This is a delightful exhibition, one ideal for children and bound to tell
almost everyone something new about St Jerome. I wish we could have had at
least a panel on the Jerome subjects not in the collection, for example,
dictating the Vulgate to his pupils (a scene found in a delightful panel in
Dublin by Niccolo Fances). And was there ever an artist who showed the scene
described in the Golden Legend when the saint's enemies, determined to stop
him becoming pope, left a woman's clothing on his bed? St Jerome, the
absent-minded scholar, put on the dress and went to church, which dished his
papal chances for ever. St Jerome the unwitting transvestite - now that
would have been a spicey variation on a much-loved theme . . .
Until December 13: admission free. Sponsored by the Bernard Sunley
Charitable Foundation.

   LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Bookshelf:
   The Human Side of a Renaissance Humanist
   ----

<LP>
   Do you often fail to finish what you start? Do you fritter
away your time, restlessly jumping from task to task and
place to place at the expense of your true calling? Do you
feel that most of your fellow humans are vile creeps, and
fantasize about their annihilation in a universal deluge?
   If the answer to any of these questions is "yes," then you
have more in common than you might think with a very great
genius. So we are reminded by Serge Bramly's excellent
"Leonardo: Discovering the Life of Leonardo da Vinci" (Edward
Burlingame/HarperCollins, 493 pages, $35), a recent best
seller in France that has now been ably Englished by Sian
Reynolds.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Surely Leonardo must be nominated the patron saint of
those who find themselves chronically unable to consummate
their most momentous undertakings. "Who will ever tell me if
anything was ever finished?" is a lament frequently
encountered in his writings, and with good cause. Nearly half
of his dozen or so surviving paintings are unfinished,
including the "Mona Lisa" and "The Last Supper." Other noble
works were scarcely begun. He never succeeded in casting the
largest equestrian monument in history, diverting the Arno
River, squaring the circle or building a flying machine. On
the other hand, he did bring off some excellent practical
jokes -- like pumping up the intestines of a bullock so that
they filled an entire room at the Vatican, to the
considerable amusement of Pope Leo X.
   What exactly was the problem? Several plausible answers
suggest themselves. Leonardo was too much of a perfectionist.
His genius was such that he conceived of projects beyond even
his abilities to execute. And he felt the execution itself
was beneath him. "To reflect is noble, to realize is
servile," he wrote, and he went on happily to let assistants
help produce his paintings from cartoons.
   Above all, Leonardo could never really make up his mind
whether he was an artist or a scientist. At first his amateur
scientific inquiries were carried out with a view toward
achieving greater naturalness in his painting and sculpture.
Before long, however, his craving for knowledge of everything
from embryology to ballistics to geology came to displace the
very artistic activity it was meant to serve.
   The notebooks Leonardo began to keep at age 30, numbering
some 13,000 pages (of which about two-thirds are extant),
contain designs for all manner of inventions: a personal
helicopter, a waterdriven alarm clock, a bicycle, a
surprisingly modern toilet, and so on. He dissected upward of
50 human cadavers (mainly criminals but some children),
making anatomical discoveries that went unrivaled for three
centuries and offering the first description of
arteriosclerosis in medical history. He did some of his most
impressive work in hydraulic engineering while he was
painting the "Mona Lisa."
   Freud, predictably, saw something neurotic in this
frenzied dabbling. Although he could not put Leonardo on the
couch, he did offer an extended psychoanalysis based on a
childhood dream the artist reported having, in which a large
bird landed on his cradle and repeatedly struck its tail
against his lips. The upshot was that da Vinci's ceaseless
investigations were fueled by infantile sexual curiosity
arising from his bastard birth. Although this represented the
"highest sublimation attained by man," it also, according to
Freud, had the unfortunate consequence of spilling over into
homosexuality.
   The evidence for Leonardo's sexual inversion is reviewed
with dispassion by Mr. Bramly. It includes a charge brought
against Leonardo at age 24 by a Florentine court (and
subsequently dropped) of having practiced sodomy on a young
male hustler. He also produced homoerotic doodlings that
might have come straight from the bathroom wall of Andy
Warhol's factory. Certainly Leonardo liked to surround
himself with ravishing young men and did not fret for female
company.
   A rather more serious moral failing was da Vinci's service
in 1502 as military engineer to Cesare Borgia, bastard son of
Pope Alexander VI and the most perfidious man in fact or
fiction. Leonardo must have been aware of the atrocities
Borgia was committing in his campaign to subjugate central
Italy. How could he square this with his own maxim to
"respect life absolutely"? Mr. Bramly tries gamely -- but, I
think, unsuccessfully -- to exculpate Leonardo, observing
that at least he withheld from Borgia the innumerable designs
for fantastic engines of destruction preserved in his
notebooks.
   The last two years of da Vinci's life were spent in the
Loire Valley in France, where he acted as a kind of Merlin to
the chivalrous young King Francois I. He had long since
virtually abandoned painting, a loss to posterity one feels
all the more acutely after reading this book. In the end Mr.
Bramly, despite his heroic biographical efforts, cannot help
feeling that this "infinite alchemist of chiaroscuro" remains
as enigmatic as the Mona Lisa's smile.

FT  16 OCT 93 / Arts: Fiac, twenty years on - Nicholas Powell finds
optimistic sellers but low prices for contemporary art in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGAINST THE background of unprecedented economic gloom Paris's contemporary
art fair, the Fiac, is celebrating its 20th anniversary in the Grand Palais.
One hundred and fifty dealers, 10 fewer than last year, are taking part in
the week-long fair which ends tomorrow night, and many big international
galleries have stayed away. Sales at the Fiac tumbled from FFr400m in 1989
to only FRr100m last year. One stallholder, the Banque de la Cite, which
holds the accounts of 530 Paris galleries, says it is owed FRr300m in
outstanding loans and that two-thirds of its gallery clients are in
financial difficulties.
Regularly inaugurated nowadays by government ministers, the Fiac began
quietly in 1974 when only 9,000 people attended. The following year's event
was marked by a 'happening' staged by Austrian artist Hermann Nitsch
involving a cow's carcase and lots of blood.
With such bohemian capers well behind them, organisers asked galleries this
year to stage shows illustrating major art movements of the past two
decades. Eighty have put on exhibitions of one or two artists, often of a
museum-like quality, although few have respected the 1974-1993 period.
Prices meanwhile are the lowest most people can remember.
Galerie Jan Krugier from Geneva is showing drawings by Picasso from the
early 1920s, during his so-called 'Ingres' period alongside drawings by
Ingres himself - a fascinating juxtaposition of high quality works. The
Florence gallery, the Vivita, has some very fine pieces by Picabia and
Galerie Gmurzynska from Cologne is showing costume designs, oil paintings,
photographic portraits and sculptures by Soviet 'suprematists' Alexander
Rodchenko and Varvara Stepanova, all but one of which featured on the Soviet
stand in the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1925. Annely Juda Fine Art,
one of five British dealers at the Fiac, is showing works by the same
artists as well as by their suprematist colleagues, Malevich and Lissitsky.
Just a little more modern, Galerie Boulakia of Paris has a show of
surrealist works by Ernst, Matta and Lam while Parisian Marwan Hoss has
devoted his stand to paintings - stark urban scenes with stylised figures
and oppressive architecture - and sculptures of the past 10 years by the
Argentinian Antonio Segui priced at FFr45,000 to FFr250,000. 'They say we
are brave to put on one-man shows. But people enjoy them, and buy,' Hoss
said.
Others are doing good business. Galerie de France of Paris showing five
whimsical mechanical sculptures by German artist Rebecca Horn, priced at
FFr200,000-FRr300,000 and made especially for the Fiac, rapidly sold three
to museums and a private collector.
London's Crane Kalman Gallery, over for its second successive Fiac with a
display of classical British modern art including works by Graham
Sutherland, William Scott, Mary Newcomb, Jenny Franklin and Ray Richardson,
made a number of sales and received a range of offers from collectors.
There may be no 'happening' or cow's carcase in this year's Fiac. But to
keep silliness alive, Canadian gallery Olga Korper is selling reproductions
of the Mona Lisa's mouth. Video artist Suzanne Giroux claims Leonardo da
Vinci painted the lips to resemble the back and buttocks of a young man if
held vertically. Each reproduction costs FFr100,000 and there are only eight
for sale.

FT  27 MAR 93 / Arts: A King tempted - A sometimes risque US exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Oh Lord, rebuke me not in thy indignation . . . ', begin the Penitential
Psalms written, according to medieval opinion, by King David.
AROUND 1500, Jean Bourdichon, versatile court painter to the French king,
produced an astonishing image of the sort of thing guaranteed to excite the
Almighty's wrath: King David peering from a bow-window at a sizzling
Bathsheba. It is just one of many lovely things to be seen in The Bernard J.
Breslauer Collection of Manuscript Illuminations, now at New York's
Pierpoint Morgan Library on 39 East 36th Street (closed Mondays).
Sadly, this exhibition of 104 single illuminated leaves, publicly exhibited
for the first time, finishes on April 4. (The scholarly catalogue costing

Breslauer is a distinguished rare book-dealer who has built up his
remarkable collection over 25 years. It consists of illuminations dating
from the 11th to the 17th centuries, roughly half of them by Italian
Renaissance artists. Not to be overlooked is an early 20th century
contribution by the execrable Spanish Forger whose additions to two
14th-century Italian leaves have a certain piquancy: it was a director of
the Pierpoint Morgan Library who in the 1930s, debunked this now
sought-after faker.
Bathsheba, one the other hand, is very much the real thing, down to her
anatomically correct genitalia. Even the elder Cranach did not dare as much
with his goddesses and nymphs. His dumpy Bathsheba washing her feet is fully
dressed. Whereas minor 16th century German masters went further in their
erotic prints, the memorable thing about Bourdichon's Bathsheba is that she
should feature in a devotional book.
The four splendid Bourdichon leaves in the Breslauer collection once
belonged to the so-called Book of Hours of Henry VII, now in the British
Library in London. However, it is more than likely that this book was
painted not for Henry Tudor, but for the louche eye of a French king.
Traditionally, the Psalms were illustrated by the Penitence of King David,
expiating in the wilderness his sin of first committing adultery and then
sending Bathsheba's husband to his death in the front line. Penitent David
features in a Book of Hours made by a French painter for that much-sinning
monarch, Henry VIII.
It was quite another thing to show Bathsheba, the seductive little baggage
who caused all the trouble. Yet it appears that this became a speciality of
French illuminators. Bourdichon's bathing beauty suggests that there were
ways of cheering up the time a king was expected to spend on his knees.
No one now dismembers medieval manuscripts for their illuminations, as
collectors did so shamelessly in earlier generations. However, one benefit
of the practice is that a single leaf is a lot easier to display and view
than a bound book. An illustration for the month of October shows a party of
noblemen going hawking in delightful sun-hats. It was made for the sumptuous
Bona Sforza Hours, also in the British Library but minus 16 leaves stolen
when thieves broke into the workshop of the famous Milanese illustrator,
Giovanni Pietro Birago.
Birago valued his loss at a staggering 500 ducats - five times the value
that his contemporary, Leonardo da Vinci, put on his 'Madonna of the Rocks'.
Today, that might seem sufficiently unlikely to make us wonder if perhaps
the artist was trying it on. Because most of us rarely see medieval or
Renaissance books, there is a tendency for the type of paintings we do see
to skew our understanding of the range of skills which connoisseurs in the
Renaissance demanded of artists.
The special value of the Breslauer Collection is that its dozens of
dazzlingly virtuoso images challenge the supremacy of wood and canvas. None
does so more eloquently than Simon Bening's 'Rest on the Flight into Egypt',
one of six leaves in the exhibition by this great Bruges master. This scene
of St Joseph bringing his bonnet full of apples to the seated Virgin,
measures only 4 in by 3 in and yet, unquestionably, it is a tour-de-force.
A harmonious balance of blues and greens beckons the viewer into a landscape
which seems to stretch for miles. Tiny figures, Herod's soldiery, search
unavailingly through the immensity of crags, forests, and meadows although
the spectator feels that there can be no place for evil in this ethereal
country. What a fortunate man Breslauer must be. Might he now be persuaded
to extend his generosity to this side of the Atlantic?

WILL THE REAL LEONARDO PLEASE STAND UP?;
</P>
<P>
'THE CRAFT OF THE FORGER' AT POMONA COLLEGE IS DRAWN MAINLY FROM THE HOLDINGS
OF A GULLIBLE COLLECTOR.

<P>
Which twin is the phony?
</P>
<P>
That is one question posed by "Artful Deception: The Craft of the Forger." Just
opened at Pomona College's Montgomery Art Gallery (to Dec. 2), it's one of
those unusual exhibitions that attracts specialists and regular folks.
</P>
<P>
Fakes and forgeries fascinate everybody. They appeal to a basic, childlike urge
to fool people. Bogus art is particularly compelling because art is hallowed as
the very shrine of originality and authenticity. A delicious illicit kick comes
from seeing some skillful dodger make suckers of the pious guardians of the
temple. According to popular lore, all those critics, connoisseurs, scholars
and collectors are a bunch of pompous poseurs anyway.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is drawn mainly from the holdings of Baltimore's Walters Art
Gallery. Opened in 1934, its founding patron was Henry Walters, a collector
whose mistakes cost him about $100,000. He never tried to sweep this under the
rug, and once told the New York Times that a museum of fakes should be
established for the education of the public. This show is a belated echo of
that wish.
</P>
<P>
A didactic section begins with a copy of Leonardo Da Vinci's revered "Mona
Lisa." It was not intended to fool anybody and a good thing, too, as it is
transparently unconvincing. Rather, it reflects a once-widespread practice
among wealthy folks, who had copies of great masterpieces decorating the
mansion to show off their superior taste.
</P>
<P>
A gallery of works from the Claremont Colleges' collections makes the point
that not all artistic look-alikes are fraudulently intended. Here are student
copies done for instruction, harmless impersonations made in homage to a master
and reproductions so convincing that they are valued as fine examples of the
printer's art.
</P>
<P>
But enough of that. We want real fakes, not fake fakes.
</P>
<P>
Some examples are so bad they couldn't fool you with the lights out. A scene of
a fallen deer supposedly by Gustave Courbet looks like somebody put it through
a mangle. A so-called J.M.W. Turner "View of the Grand Canal" looks OK across
the room but up close turns to melting whipped cream. How could Walters have
been such a twit?
</P>
<P>
Well, nobody is easier to fool than somebody blinded by desire. If you want
something badly enough you will find it. This is a genuine Rolex watch which I
was lucky enough to buy in an alley for 40 bucks. The guy was very nervous but
the watch is real.
</P>
<P>
It's also easy to fool people with an object that appeals to their established
taste. A "Late Medieval" stained-glass panel is a perfect joke. It makes no
attempt to hide the modern techniques behind its glaring glass and the subject
is drawn from a Hans Holbein portrait done in the 16th Century. The thing got
by because it was made by a Victorian forger for Victorian taste.
</P>
<P>
Most fakes give themselves away by a combination of mechanical deadness and
expressive sweetness. They operate like con men. Nobody is really taken in
unless they want to be. Anybody who is fails to come away with a terrible sense
of self-betrayal and stupidity. Living a lie is only fun until the sun comes
up.
</P>
<P>
There are those rare counterfeiters skillful enough to vamp the experts. A "St.
George Slaying the Dragon" was once ascribed to an unknown Pietro Carpaccio by
the renowned Bernard Berenson. It doesn't look so great today but there are
works that do, like a gold ground Italian painting by master forger Icilio
Frederico Joni. He was finally unmasked because, like a real artist, he had
personal characteristics that got into all his fakes, such as long elegant
noses and a weakness for elaborate halos always produced with the same stamping
tools.
</P>
<P>
Other artistically adept forgers made silly mistakes. There is a superb little
ivory miniature long accepted as a Gothic devotional plaque until a scholar
smelled a rat. It depicts a lowly saint seated in a position of authority over
the apostles Peter and Paul. No medieval monk would have committed such heresy.
</P>
<P>
A French turn-of-the-century imitator known, oddly, as "The Spanish Forger" did
stunning pastiches of late medieval manuscript pages. Crafty enough to use
authentic vellum pages with calligraphic text, he was also dumb enough not to
match the illustration to the story. Eventually somebody noticed. Other common
forger's gaffes include making mismatched meldings of differing styles like an
"Italo-Byzantine" monumental Crucifixion where Christ is Byzantine to the waist
and then goes Romanesque. Looks like a Volkswagen with tail fins.
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the circle of forgery involves foolishness on the part of maker and
seller alike.
</P>
<P>
The most entertaining and slightly intimidating section of the exhibition is
"Now YOU Be the Judge." It invites visitors to compare half a dozen sets of
similar objects, one genuine, one bogus, and decide which is right.
</P>
<P>
I got five correct and it was relatively easy. Basically, originals have
vitality and assurance. That knowledge guides the eye to the real halves of
pairs of Egyptian heads, water colors given to Gavarini and two Gothic
devotional scenes in ivory. The rest are tougher because they are closer to
crafts objects, which have a built-in mechanical edge. A pair of supposed
Chinese "Famille rose" ceramics yields the imitation when you notice that one
is a trifle grosser and its pictured scenes use Westernized perspective. The
real half of paired "Renaissance" pendants wins by sheer exquisiteness of
workmanship.
</P>
<P>
I missed the call on a pair of Sevres-style ormolu clocks, but a gallery
representative says everybody does. If I were a forger, I'd stick to the
decorative arts, where it seems to be possible for a copy to be aesthetically
superior to the original.
</P>
<P>
Maybe the real lesson of the section is that it's much harder to be fooled if
an uncertain work is compared to a known original.
</P>
<P>
"Artful Deception" is a fascinating show on its own hook, but may also
represent a dark cultural phenomenon. Last summer, the British Museum did a
similar, much grander show and people flocked to it. Stories of fakes are much
in the press. We live in a time of blatant doubt of authenticity. Are our
politicians corrupt? Is our economy sound? Do the media tell us the truth?
</P>
<P>
The interest sparked by such an exhibition gets beyond itself. It comes to be
about a society that wants to look deception in the eye so it can see reality
again.

ART: MUSEUM CONSTRUCTION FLOURISHED, PRICES FOR ARTWORKS SKYROCKETED AND
ARTISTS GOT RICH, BUT CHANGES IN TAX LAW AND NEA RESTRICTIONS PUT A DAMPER ON
PROGRESS IN THE '80S.

<P>
They were the Opulent '80s. The visual arts, a once-esoteric subculture, joined
the real world, reflecting the Reagan era's love of consumption, prestige and
self-congratulation. We crowned ourselves in a frenzy of museum building and
filled our cultural cathedrals with the booty of centuries. Artists joined the
ranks of the rich and famous. Galleries flourished and auction prices ascended
into the stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
It was gilded and grandiose, but in the end museum directors feared for the
future of public showplaces. New York's magisterial Metropolitan had a 1989
deficit of more than $4 million. Tax laws discouraged donations, and auction
prices shut down institutional collecting. New art lost its way in a maze of
cross-purposes, and all art was reduced to a commodity increasingly in the
hands of private investors seeking status, profit or their very own private
museums. Some boutique museums worked -- like Houston's smart, soulful Menil
Museum -- but hearts sank when Armand Hammer jerked his promised collection
away from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to build his own monument in
Westwood.
</P>
<P>
It looked like the dawn of the Nasty '90s.
</P>
<P>
What happened? What went right? What went wrong?
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles matured into a meaningful art center and came to symbolize the
whole caboodle as the home of the world's richest art institution, the J. Paul
Getty Trust. With an endowment well in excess of $3 billion, it has an annual
income of about $150 million -- a sum a Saudi prince would have trouble
squandering. Among many acquisitions was one of the 10 most expensive works
auctioned. It paid $35.2 million for Jacopo Pontormo's "Halberdier," but Van
Gogh and Picasso dominated the Top 10.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles mirrored a Euro-American cultural axis at the apex of Baroque
splendor. It built museums with the enthusiasm of medieval worshipers. Art
itself took on the aspect of a weird secular religion. True believers revered
its relics. The powerful purchased piety through corporate indulgence. The
artist Hans Haacke blew the whistle on them, the Ralph Nader of the art world.
</P>
<P>
Angeltown's greening was signaled by the enchanted Olympic year of '84 with its
cosmopolitan arts festival. The fine arts had a small part in it, but the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art's lovely Impressionist show, "A Day in the
Country," captured the mood.
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Contemporary Art went through birth traumas. Wrangles over
architectural control and the loss of its superstar director Pontus Hulten had
to play out before Richard Koshalek took charge. Now, Arata Isozaki's pretty,
witty building glitters on Bunker Hill.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Earl A. (Rusty) Powell came from Washington to direct the
steady-as-she-goes County Museum. Now the museum's new Anderson Building by
Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer and its Japanese Pavilion by Bruce Goff are as exotic as
the town, but they echo a phenomenon that swept westward from the Berlin Wall
to the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
West Germany probably led the pack, capping its economic miracle with a blitz
of building, adding nearly 30 new museums by decade's end, including such
masterworks as James Stirling's muscular Stuttgart Neue Staatsgalerie and Hans
Hollien's lapidary Stadtisches Museum Abteiberg in Monchengladbach, a burg of
just 150,000 souls.
</P>
<P>
Paris gilded its lily with the grandiose art-unfriendly Musee d'Orsay, got it
right when they housed the legacy of the rebellious Picasso in the 17th-Century
Hotel Sale and surprised everybody when I. M. Pei's new glass-pyramid entry for
the Louvre turned out handsome and respectful of its august surroundings.
</P>
<P>
The real spirit of the era began with a national sigh of relief on Inauguration
Day, 1981, when the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini released American hostages held
in the Tehran embassy. Self-celebration followed. Art of all stripes acted as
reassurance that the culture was still rich and powerful even as it felt
rattled and unsure. The country became conservative and art held up the mirror
in a revivalist rush into the past.
</P>
<P>
Art formed cliches of Post-Modernism accompanied by big nostalgic shows devoted
to the American Renaissance, Louis Comfort Tiffany and decadent Vienna, 1900. A
paraded pomp of bread-and-circus shows that started in the '70s with "The
Treasures of Tuthankamun" lumbered on to pretty well culminate with the
National Gallery's "Treasure Houses of Great Britain" in 1985. By then, rising
insurance costs and dwindling support had turned such shows, no matter how
popular, into albino elephants. Some, like the fatuous "The Search for
Alexander," had been turkeys anyway.
</P>
<P>
A newer, more nourishing trend was already under way. Serious and revelatory
surveys of master art proved the most passionate fruit of the decade. Even
aficionados who had spent their days with noses glued to framing glass were
astonished by the number of once-in-a-lifetime American exhibitions of great
old master art: Watteau, Caravaggio, Poussin, Zurbaran, Hals, Velazquez. As
history moved closer, it focused on the towering figure of Cezanne, the
heart-stopping testament of Van Gogh, the unavoidable stylishness and exoticism
of Gauguin.
</P>
<P>
For Los Angeles viewers, such marvels were both revelation and aggravation
because witnessing any of them required pilgrimage to Manhattan's Metropolitan
and Museum of Modern Art and Washington's National Gallery. Los Angeles came a
long way, but baby we still got a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
We did better -- even astonishingly better -- when it came to totting up the
short list of the decade's finest modern exhibitions. The originality of a
revived modern-art program at LACMA ran neck-and-neck with the classicism of
the Museum of Modern Art. MOMA's great Picasso retrospective, her "Primitivism
and 20th Century Art" plus "Picasso and Braque," added up to a thoughtful
probing of fixed tradition. LACMA talked about the present and future in
exhibitions devoted to near-forgotten, newly relevant movements like the
Russian avant-garde and Stephanie Barron's German Expressionist sculpture and
second-generation shows. Maurice Tuchman had the gumption to say that modern
art had soul in "The Spiritual and Art." The museum reintroduced the dense
mastery of Max Beckmann in a retrospective no New York museum had the brains to
book.
</P>
<P>
Then there was contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
Pluralism turns out to be code for "one fine mess." The art of the moment
became a chaotic tower of Babel with everybody speaking every conceivable
language but his own. Babylon babbled on in the accents of fashion,
entertainment, politics and economics, but it was a rare day when there was a
sign in the window reading "Man Spricht Kunst" or "On Parle Art." In the end,
art was deemed more interesting if it attached to a current issue like
perestroika, AIDS or Japan than because it was good.
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Contemporary Art became the West Coast flagship of the Now. Not
fully launched until 1986, it made great strides, buying its core collection
from Milan's Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo for $11 million and receiving
bequests from the estates of Barry Lowen and Taft Schreiber. Everyone wished
MOCA well, but as the artificial curtain came down on the '80s, the museum
seemed not to have gained traction. A sense of trying to do too many things at
once echoed the disarray of the larger world of contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
Bogus movements succeeded one another like mannequins parading down a ramp:
Neo-Expressionism, the Transavantgardia, New Images, Neo-Geo, Appropriation,
Deconstructivism. Art was reinternationalized and, for what it's worth, a local
institution exercised broad influence. A generation of Young Turks from CalArts
under the guruship of John Baldessari spearheaded art that deals in
word-associated images and social parody via The Media.
</P>
<P>
The new power of the press to intervene in shaping popular artistic taste was
never clearer than in the hot, slow summer of '86, when Time and Newsweek
carried cover stories about the supposed discovery of a cache of supposedly
secret paintings by Andrew Wyeth. All depicted his longtime model, Helga
Testorf. The subtextual implication that the grand old conservative of American
painting had had an affair was enough to ensure the popularity of a museum
tour. It had nothing to do with art. It was about the yarn.
</P>
<P>
International bellwether exhibitions proved there are more artists working than
anybody can keep track of -- or wants to. Germany's Documenta and the Venice
Biennale suffered from inbreeding and hollow giantism. After 10 years, only a
handful of such artists stick in the mind: Anselm Kiefer, Jannis Kounellis,
Richard Long, Jonathan Borofsky, Christian Boltanski -- to name a few of the
few. Local examples with talent and apparent staying power are as rare as Jill
Giegerich.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Paris' Pompidou Center organized "Magicians of the Earth." It
mixed a sprawling melange of jet-set regulars like Nam June Paik with unknown
Third World folk-style artists and may have been the worst, most incoherent
circus of the epoch.
</P>
<P>
Superstar artists flaired and fizzled. A trio of Italians hot at the start were
half forgotten by the end. Americans like David Salle, Julian Schnabel, Eric
Fischl and Robert Longo sold in six figures, but after Longo's retrospective at
LACMA a New York critic wondered if he was washed up with the decade. Green
talents were launched before they were ready. Jean-Michel Basquiat died from
it.
</P>
<P>
Truth to tell, the most memorable art of the '80s came from artists who
predated it: Frank Stella, Richard Diebenkorn, David Hockney, Lucien Freud, Ed
Moses, Joe Goode and the artist's architect, Frank Gehry. One of the nicest
memories comes from '85, when Christo wrapped Paris' ancient Seine bridge, the
Pont Neuf. Seen at sunset swathed in dull golden fabric, it was like a
liquefied cocktail of past and present existing in classic harmony.
</P>
<P>
What went wrong?
</P>
<P>
The culture went greedy, narcissistic, intensely confrontational, contentious
and short on civility. Fracturing polarization symbolized by, say, the
agonizing debate over abortion, signals a society that has lost the ability to
make the distinctions necessary to arrive at a common set of values.
</P>
<P>
A French poet, I think it was Valery, when accused of being overly cultivated,
replied that if civilization fails to become more refined it must become
brutalized.
</P>
<P>
In the arts, the decade saw a breakdown of distinctions that breached the
borders between the various arts, a cross-fertilization that revitalized
architecture and design but impoverished fine art. Even artists who kept the
faith found themselves confronted by an audience relieved of the burden of
being attentive to pesky nuances. After all, it's all the same in the end. It's
all collectibles.
</P>
<P>
Andy Warhol died, but his sardonically innocent insights about American culture
proved true. Fame and money.
</P>
<P>
Public Art turned out to be code for vulgarization.
</P>
<P>
Vulgarity has the virtue of energy and the vice of self-satisfaction. Now that
art is like everything else, everybody has a shot at it from John Q. Public to
The Media and Sen. Klaghorn. The decade has shown where that gets us.
</P>
<P>
Remember the controversy up in the Bay over Robert Arneson's bust of
assassinated Mayor George Moscone? What about the wrangle over Maya Lin's
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in D.C., or New York's grinding battle around Richard
Serra's "Tilted Arc," which was finally removed to the artist's anguish? Around
here, there was Robert Graham's Olympic Gateway. Critics out to weigh its
aesthetic worth were surprised at public outrage over pubic specificity.
</P>
<P>
Remember when the city's manager for cultural affairs, Fred Croton, left the
post after it was discovered he had exaggerated his qualifications on his
application? The Getty's respected curator of antiquities, Jiri Frel, was
allowed to resign quietly after he'd violated museum policies on acquisitions.
Dreary business.
</P>
<P>
Gentlemanly John Walsh, director of the Getty Museum, must have been bemused by
the number of times journalists and dealers besmirched his acqusitions as hot
or fake. First they went after his Dieric Bouts, then his ancient Greek Kouros
and a big Aphrodite. Thomas Hoving of Connoisseur magazine led the charge so
many times it should have gotten funny. Never did.
</P>
<P>
It does not auger well that the lights go out on a year when the big news was a
senatorial attack on the National Endowment for the Arts. Hard to forget that
the Corcoran Gallery did the wrong thing by canceling an endowment-funded show
of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. Instead of avoiding controversy and
political interference thereby, they increased it, incensed the art community
and kicked off a chain of events that ended with legislation restricting
endowment grants to "obscene or offensive" art, whatever that means.
</P>
<P>
Means trouble.
</P>
<P>
Nobody wants to leave a decade on such a sour note. Let's go back to London, to
the new Clore Gallery for the art of Joseph Mallord William Turner. There is a
study room there where any citizen willing to wash his fingers can contemplate
Turner's glorious watercolors, holding them in his own hands.
</P>
<P>
That's what it's all about.

FT  05 FEB 93 / Arts: Rembrandt's Girl at a Window's claim to fame - The
exhibition at Dulwich Art Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dulwich Picture Gallery's small-scale exhibition framed around Rembrandt's
'Girl at a Window' examines the fame of a painting. Like WF Yeames' 'And
When Did You Last See Your Father?', similarly investigated at the Walker
Art Gallery, the Rembrandt remains an enduringly popular image. The young
girl is to be found gazing out of anything from the cover of a National
Gallery day book sold in museum shops to leaflets promoting skin-care
products.
Yeames' painting entered the national consciousness through its translation
into textbook illustration, cigarette-card picture and waxwork tableau. The
tale of how successive generations in various countries have responded to
and interpreted Rembrandt's somewhat ambiguous 'Girl at a Window' is both
more typical and more subtle, and it begins in the master's studio.
Part of a young artist's training in Rembrandt's studio, as elsewhere in the
Netherlands, was to make literal copies of the master's paintings, and
copies with variations. The ability to paint in the manner of Rembrandt was
a prerequisite of a successful artistic career in Amsterdam. Moreover, guild
rules forbade pupils from working in a manner other than their master's, or
from signing their works.
'Girl at a Window' is signed and dated 1645, when the size of Rembrandt's
studio rivalled that of Rubens in Antwerp. The artist was not the first to
paint a figure leaning out of an open window; he had also drawn Saskia in
comparable pose some 12 years before. Characteristically, however, he was to
make a conventional formula entirely his own.
The girl is too young to be Hendrickje Stoffels, as has often been
suggested. She is more likely to be a servant or even a prostitute, given
her direct gaze and gaping bodice. A pool of water gathers around her left
elbow: is she straight from her bath or the washing? The painting is not so
much a portrait as a genre study of disarming naturalness and freshness.
Alongside it at Dulwich we find a 19th century copy of Chicago's famous
'Girl at a Half-Door', recently attributed to Rembrandt's pupil Samuel van
Hoogstraten but which must remain one of the more problematic demotions of
the Rembrandt Research Project. From Woburn comes a studio adaptation, 'Girl
at an Open Door', also attributed to Hoogstraten, which is indebted to the
two paintings but is notably inferior to both. (One of the unexpected treats
of the show is a thoroughly contemporary portrait by John Opie of his second
wife which pays homage to the Woburn picture, then celebrated as a Rembrandt
masterpiece.) 'A Kitchen Maid', on loan from Stockholm, shows the master
himself returning to the subject in 1651.
It is fascinating to see this small group. If only Dulwich had also been
able to secure the original 'Girl at a Half-Door' and Washington's 'Girl
with a Broom', now deemed to be by Carel Fabritius, this exhibition would
have proved far more revealing of the relationship between master and
pupils, and of the Research Project's distinction between masterpiece and
studio work, than last year's blockbuster Rembrandt show.
The show takes us on to 18th century France, where the vogue for 17th
century Dutch genre painting is reflected by the presence of the Dulwich,
Stockholm and Washington pictures. One of the canvases - probably 'Girl at a
Window' - belonged to the art theorist, painter and spy Roger de Piles and
would have been easily accessible to the artistic community for most of the
century. Certainly the Dulwich picture was to prove the most influential and
widely imitated.
One of the first to pursue the formula was Antoine Pesne, later painter to
the Prussian court. His girls at a window of 1706 and 1708 (illustrated in
reproduction) are pretty and simpering, and their expanses of bare bosom
make explicit the implicit sexuality of Rembrandt's painting. A few years
later Jean-Baptiste Santerre attempted a far more faithful, albeit
sentimentalised version. Here the girl's status is clarified by a basket of
onions, and she is as sweet and virtuous as any Greuze charmer.
Her impact on British art, after her arrival in the 1770s, is less
pronounced. Sadly we cannot see the the copy apparently painted by Sir
Joshua Reynolds, although a replica in the Hermitage shows it to be accurate
but still sugar-sweet. We can see Reynolds using it as a point of departure
in the 'Laughing Girl' from Kenwood, a full-blown essay in the master's
sombre rich tonality and clotted-cream impasto.
Frances Grace's painting of 1878-79 and Simon Edmondson's recent
interpretation using a local schoolgirl as model are witness to the
continuing popularity of copying the Rembrandt at Dulwich, which was not
only Britain's first public art gallery but doubled as an informal art
school.
It obviously had its copying uses, too, for the infamous 'Sexton Blaker' Tom
Keating, who is shown to have cut his crooked teeth on 'Girl at a Window' in
the 1950s.
The exhibition, sponsored by Martini &amp; Rossi, Sunley Holdings and
Williamson's Electrical Company, continues until April 25. While the Clore
Foundation's donation of Pounds 200,000 offers a temporary reprieve for the
gallery an additional annual income of Pounds 250,000, or an endowment of
Pounds 5m, is still needed

FT  26 JUN 92 / Arts: Women's view of Weimar - Fine Arts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An excess of candour can be bad for one's health. Be sure, then, that there
is a reason why your reviewer will admit that she previously knew the work
of only one artist, Kathe Kollwitz, in the major exhibition of German art in
the 1920s and '30s now at the Leicestershire City Museum and Art Gallery.
Largely made up of loans from German museums and private collections,
Domesticity and Dissent is a highly unusual exhibition. It features prints,
paintings, photographs and sculptures by no less than 26 artists associated
with Neue Sachlichkeit, or New Objectivity - the realist movement dominated
by the figures of George Grosz and Otto Dix.
No one interested in art and society in the Weimar Republic should miss
Domesticity and Dissent. Two individuals deserve credit for making this
ambitious venture succeed - which is not to overlook a bold first step into
sponsorship by Hormann UK Ltd, who make garage doors. The idea for the
exhibition was put up by Marsha Meskimmon, an American postgraduate student.
Leicester is already well-known for its collection of early 20th-century
German art, and Meskimmon found a ready supporter in Amanda Wadsley, the
museum's fine arts curator.
Meskimmon wrote hundreds of letters to German museums and collectors, then
went dredging through their records and the public archives in search of
information about 26 artists she had selected for the show. Reunification
came a little late in the day, but it certainly helped. Many paintings have
been loaned from museums formerly in the East, hence some atrocious frames
and the poor state of conservation of certain works.
But with Hedwig Huschke, for example, the determined Ms Meskimmon drew a
blank. The public gallery at Weimar has lent two paintings by Huschke; a
view of village-houses near Weimar (1924) and a large, quiet-toned yet
arresting self-portrait (1932). Now in the case of a 15th-century painting,
it is never a surprise to find nothing is known about the artist. A scholar
dubs the artist Master of the Man in Striped Hose, and suddenly he exists.
But in the century marked above all by the Triumph of Bureaucracy, it is a
shock to find an artist's catalogue entry stating 'no biographical
information available.' Huschke existed, but who was she?
By now, of course, attentive readers will have smelt a rat. The subtitle to
the exhibition is 'The Role of Women Artists in Germany 1918-38.' Which, of
course, changes the whole picture and lets me, and I dare say you too, off
the hook.
Small wonder that, except for Kollwitz, none of these women artists was
selected for the Royal Academy's 1985 conspectus show of German 20th-century
art. More tellingly, none of them was shown at the 1978 Arts Council
exhibition which for the first time put Neue Sachlichkeit before the British
public. Gerta Overbeck and the Jewish artist Lea Grundig were merely names
in the text.
So, on one level, the Leicester exhibition is a particularly well-researched
example of feminist art-history managing to salvage women artists from
l'oubli. It is amusing to find that Whitney Chadwick's Women, Art and
Society, published only two years ago and billed as a 'comprehensive'
account of women's involvement in the fine arts, also came up only with
Kollwitz, plus Paula Modersohn-Becker.
One of the best things in Domesticity and Dissent is the self-portrait
bronze made in 1936 when Kollwitz was nearly 70 - the year in which she was
unofficially banned from exhibiting by the Nazis. Obviously it was tempting
to include this great artist who has come to enjoy cult status. However, she
makes an odd member of Neue Sachlichkeit, and what gives Domesticity and
Dissent its cogency is the focus on the contradictions, ironies and
undoubted achievement of these women realists.
Central to the Neue Sachlichkeit tendency was the image of the artist as a
man of unflinching vision, focusing his lens on whatever was banal,
repulsive, cruel. We think, of course, of Grosz and Dix, of their shocking
images of prostitutes and cripples. Many artists of Marxist and anarchist
sympathies wanted to flay bourgeois society in their work, to express
sympathy for the sufferings of the industrialised proletariat.
Traditionally, women artists were expected to prefer domestic images. But in
an era when everyone was talking about the problem of the New Woman, who had
the vote and campaigned for abortion, many women artists naturally embraced
the cause of public 'dissent'. There are images of domesticity. However, it
is a home which is a place of suffering, where poverty is least visible yet
most cruel.
In Lea Grundig's etchings for the 'Women's Life' series, a child is dead, a
mother sits like a prisoner and the streets are for women a place of
exclusion, gazing at consumer goods in shop windows. 'A Children's
Playground at Night' is a place beneath smoking factory chimneys where men
and women make love on the benches: in a Grosz scene, we would know the
women were prostitutes, but here, both sexes are victims.
However, there is a great variety in the work of these artists. Grete
Jurgens's portrait of a little girl represents another facet of Neue
Sachlichkeit, the nostalgia for Bedermeier sweetness. In Eva Schulze-Knabe's
heroic self-portrait, there is conscious defiance of the anti-female
stereotype which kept women - and women-artists - in their place. Other
personal 'discoveries' I earnestly hope to be seeing more of include the
sculptors Lucie Prussog-Jahn and Rene Sintensis, and the painters Gerta
Overbeck and Kate Diehn-Bitt (there is a fascinating neo-Renaissance
self-portrait).
Domesticity and Dissent ends on the July 5. However, I am told there is a
'90 per cent' chance it will transfer to the Kelvingrove Museum and Art
Gallery in Glasgow. I hope so: this is an exhibition after which our view of
German art of the inter-war years ought never to be the same again.

<P>
ART: AN EXHIBIT AT POMONA COLLEGE GIVES VIEWERS THE CHANCE TO SEE MORE THAN TWO
DOZEN CLEVER COPIES.

<P>
Pretend you are a wealthy art collector. Before you are two medieval
manuscripts, both painted on vellum, both showing centuries of wear.
Unfortunately, one is a fake.
</P>
<P>
How will you discern which manuscript dates back to medieval times and which
was painted by a notorious Spanish forger in the 19th Century?
</P>
<P>
You might start by honing your connoisseurship at Pomona College's Montgomery
Gallery, where "Artful Deception: The Craft of the Forger" is on display
through Dec. 2. The exhibit, which is traveling across the country, was
organized by curators at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
At this unusual show, viewers get a glimpse of more than two dozen fakes --
from 16th-Century Russian icons to the "Mona Lisa" to ancient busts of Roman
youths. In some cases, the fakes are paired with genuine works in the same
style. Viewers are invited to study them, read about the actual artist's style
and background, then choose which piece they think is authentic. Sliding open a
panel reveals whether the viewer has a future in art scholarship.
</P>
<P>
As compelling as the "whodunit" tests are the cloak-and-dagger tales that
accompany the forgeries, many of which have been exhibited as genuine for
years.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the "Spanish forger" who faked the medieval manuscripts was a
highly skilled and clever painter who went to great lengths to disguise his
forgeries by using vellum that dated back to the Middle Ages, painting in the
style of medieval illuminators and then "aging" his works.
</P>
<P>
The forger, who art historians think was actually a Frenchman working in Paris
during the Victorian era, went undetected in his own time. But 20th-Century art
historians notice -- as Montgomery patrons may also -- that the forger was
undone by his faces. To the contemporary eye, they smack of the cloying
sweetness of the Victorian era and do not reflect the more somber, pious style
of painters who worked in the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
Copying important works of art is a practice that dates back to ancient Egypt,
says Montgomery Gallery Director Marjorie L. Harth, who points out that not all
fakes and forgeries were initially meant to deceive.
</P>
<P>
The Romans, for instance, loved the classical Greek style and commissioned
numerous copies of Greek art that were considered legitimate and highly
desirable.
</P>
<P>
Other artists were illicitly copied during their own lifetimes. Painter and
wood engraver Albrecht Durer went to court in the early 16th Century to halt
reproductions. On the other hand, Rubens and Rembrandt encouraged their
students and assistants to copy their work as a way to learn the master's
style.
</P>
<P>
And Jean Baptiste Camille Corot (1796-1875) occasionally signed his students'
works to help them professionally in their careers, thus muddying the waters
for generations of art historians to come. As a result, says Harth, practically
all Corots -- especially landscapes such as the one represented in the Pomona
show -- have come under suspicion.
</P>
<P>
The public's fascination with art and forgeries may be heightened by the
millions of dollars that masterpieces command today on world markets, Harth
says. A Van Gogh self-portrait in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art was
recently removed from display when its authenticity was questioned. Ditto the
"Kouros," a classical Greek bust of a youth displayed by the J. Paul Getty
Museum, which came under suspicion when a very similar sculpture known to be a
fake appeared on the market.
</P>
<P>
The Pomona show explains the high-tech tools today's art historian uses to
detect fakes: X-rays, infrared photographs and pigment analysis. One work in
the show, a supposed early 16th-Century "Venetian Renaissance" panel painting
of St. George slaying the dragon, was revealed as a 19th-Century fake after the
Walters Conservation Lab noticed some suspiciously heavy overpainting on the
canvas.
</P>
<P>
An X-ray revealed a late 16th-Century painting of the Last Supper underneath.
Subsequent analysis showed that the scene of St. George and the dragon was
painted over the earlier work in the 19th Century. The curators have removed
several sections of the forgery to reveal the head of one of Christ's disciples
and the small dog at Christ's feet, giving patrons a fascinating glimpse at a
forgery exposed.
</P>
<P>
In addition to technical tools, historians use their knowledge to match
artistic styles and flourishes with the appropriate cultures and epochs.
</P>
<P>
Harth calls it "the complicated, interrelated workings of eye and brain."
Perception, he says, is determined by context, "by the conditions, physical and
intellectual, under which we see the work."
</P>
<P>
"Once you know which one is authentic, it will look better than it did, and the
one labeled fake will look worse," Harth promises.
</P>
<P>
Fakes provide fascinating reference points for art historians. Like a slightly
warped mirror, they reflect a skewed view of artistic reality -- but as with
any illusion, they draw the viewer in.
</P>
<P>
"Fakes speak eloquently of fallibility and of gullibility," Harth says. "Fakes
. . . teach us to understand and to value authenticity in art."
</P>
<P>
Forgers often are unable to transcend the barriers of their own time. A bust of
a king from ancient Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty is revealed as a fake by the
playful, naive and human expression on the face. Walters curators say this is
greatly at odds with the work of ancient Egyptian stone carvers, who depicted
their kings as men of strength and power -- austere, remote and on a plane
above mere mortals.
</P>
<P>
Other times, fakes give themselves away by sloppy inattention to detail. A
"Gothic" ivory carving in the exhibit was revealed as a fake when scholars
noticed that St. Catherine is seated in the center, with the apostles Peter and
Paul to the sides. A true Gothic carver, pious and theologically schooled,
would never have ranked a mere saint above the apostles.
</P>
<P>
Cross-cultural faking is even more difficult than that which attempts to
transcend epochs. A pink ceramic vessel, allegedly from 18th-Century China's
Ching Dynasty, is revealed as a 19th-Century Western European imitation by its
lack of subtlety and its inability to reproduce the two-dimensional composition
of Asian art popular at that time.
</P>
<P>
Often, however, forgers are artists in their own right and earn the grudging
admiration of art historians for their clever, albeit misplaced, genius.
</P>
<P>
Icilio Federico Joni (1866-1946) was a Sienese painter, restorer, art dealer
and forger who specialized in Renaissance paintings. Joni, who often used
panels that dated from the Renaissance to throw historians off the scent, was
unmasked because he allowed too many paintings to trace their provenance, or
ownership history, back to him. In addition, Joni gave all the characters in
his paintings the same long, broad noses and elaborate halos.
</P>
<P>
Then there was Reinhold Vasters (1827-1909), the nearly perfect forger. A
master goldsmith from Aachen, Germany, Vasters forged jewelry and decorative
works in Renaissance style but was never exposed during his lifetime. The
forgeries came to light in the early 1980s, when the working drawings for his
fakes were discovered in the storerooms of the Victoria and Albert Museum in
London. Perhaps, say the Walters curators, he left documentation to salve his
ego and assure himself that his talent -- and his ability to fool the experts
of his time -- would one day be known to all.
</P>
<P>
Forgeries aren't always aesthetically inferior, either. Of the two Sevres
clocks on display at the gallery, Harth says several curators would argue that
the fake is actually superior.
</P>
<P>
So what, then, is wrong with fakes?
</P>
<P>
The Walters curators say: "A discredited work of art can only distort and
obscure our view of the past."
</P>
<P>
Harth adds that a forgery blemishes the reputation of the real artist and,
perhaps more dangerously, creates a false basis of information about the artist
and the period in question with which to judge future works.
</P>
<P>
What makes Dutch painter Jan Vermeer (1632-1675) great, Harth says, "is not
only that he painted beautiful pictures but that he painted certain pictures in
a certain way at a certain time in the history and development of art. In
addition to the craftsmanship, technique and cleverness of the painting, it
shows genuine creative achievement."

FT  29 MAY 92 / Arts: The mystery of the two yarnwinders - A question of
attribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Leonardo da Vinci was infinitely distractable. In 1501, the head of the
Carmelites in Florence wrote to warn Isabella d'Este that her chances of
getting a painting out of Leonardo looked worse than ever.
Leonardo, the prior reported, was so enthralled by mathematical experiments
that 'he cannot bear the brush'. No doubt more irritating still for the
marchioness was to learn that another collector, a Frenchman called
Florimond Robertet, had now jumped the queue.
Distracted Leonardo might have been, yet even so he managed to come up with
what the prior recorded as a novel version of the Virgin and Child: the
'Madonna with the Yarnwinder'. Soon, Leonardesque painters were turning out
versions and pastiches of it, both good and bad. Leonardo da Vinci.
'The Mystery of the Madonna of the Yarnwinder', at the National Gallery of
Scotland in Edinburgh, takes a close look at a problem which has long
bothered Leonardo scholars. Two unquestionably lovely versions of the theme
have survived. Which has the stronger claim to be by Leonardo, and could it
be the painting for Robertet?
Puzzle-solving exhibitions have been the success story of this decade. The
Edinburgh show runs true to type in not being particularly large, although
it is filled out with drawings and historical material on Robertet,
secretary to Charles XII. But the fact of the puzzle being about Leonardo,
makes this the most significant show about scholarly sleuthing yet. The
scholar in question is Professor Martin Kemp, creator of the memorable
Hayward Gallery show of 1989.
In 1898, two Madonnas with Yarnwinders were exhibited in the Burlington Fine
Arts Society. One belonged - as it still does - to the Duke of Buccleuch.
The other was the property of Lord Battersea and is now owned by a New York
collector. As is the way of these things, each has had adherents as well as
detractors, even as recently as the last decade. Researchers beavering away
in the archives and scientists using infra-red reflectography, have helped
push the question forward.
Now, for the first time in almost a century, the two versions meet again. At
a glance, it is clear that for all the obvious similarity, there are
important differences. The New York version is brighter in colouring but,
even to the layman's eye, more damaged. With its deep green-blue hue, the
Buccleuch painting shows more clearly Leonardo's extraordinary 'smokey'
technique in the way the flesh is modelled. It carries a strong echo of the
Virgin of the Rocks.
But most of all, the difference lies in entirely different backgrounds. In
the New York painting, the Virgin and Child are seated in front of a
dizzying view of ice-blue alpine ranges, reminding us of Leonardo's
fascination with mountains.
The Buccleuch version sets the figures in front of a murky landscape with
rocky outcrops and bushes which border a desolate, dead-calm sea - something
found nowhere else in Leonardo's work.
If the varnish were not dirty and discoloured, the band of light at the
horizon might be more eye-catching and point more clearly to the
time-honoured description of the Virgin as stella maris, star of the sea.
That said, it is hard to feel happy with the idea that anyone might fiddle
about cleaning this calmly beautiful, melancholy painting.
As the prior Fra Pietro implied to the marchioness, there was much for a
sophisticated Christian to ponder in this novel scene. On one level,
Leonardo shows a young mother patiently restraining her lively son who is in
the way of her spinning. Medieval society naturally viewed the Virgin as a
busy working mother. But the cruciform yarnwinder represents the cross and
the Virgin's solemn expression suggests prescience of the sacrifice which
her son will one day eagerly embrace.
Many painters, notably Raphael, took up the idea of baby Jesus as an active
little chap. No one, however, appears to have followed Leonardo's notion
explored in one of the exhibition's drawings, of showing the Christ Child in
the Virgin's arms, squeezing the life out of a cat. There was a legend that
a cat gave birth at the same time as the Virgin, but Leonardo was motivated
less by an interest in inventing subjects for their meaning, and far more
for the formal opportunities they offered.
The drawings, from public and private collections, bring out well Leonardo's
insatiable curiosity about the underlying structure of the natural world.
How did a child's anatomy differ from a man's? (It is a macabre thought, but
Leonardo was presumably not able to dissect infants as he did grown men.)
Babies dimpled, he noted, exactly where grown men had bulges.
Among the sketches in the exhibition, we see a sheet covered in drawings of
chubby limbs, together with studies of the Christ Child standing and
walking, and of a child's head probably done to help members of the studio.
Contemporaries particularly admired Leonardo's brilliance at conveying
emotion through movement. Furiously executed sketches show him working out
ideas. A sketch from a private collection shows one of the artist's stranger
inventions: Christ slipping off the Virgin's lap, who in turn rises from the
lap of her mother, St Anne.
This drawing may help Leonardo scholars solve another mystery. It conforms
exactly to another description by Fra Pietro, again writing to Isabella,
this time about a cartoon. Could it be that the drawing is a fake, produced
by someone who had read the prior's letter? Professor Kemp takes a more
charitable view; that Leonardo went first, then someone with a clumsy touch
went over the top of his outlines.
What then, of the 'Mystery of the Madonna of the Yarnwinder'? Kemp's view is
that both the Buccleuch and the New York paintings were mainly painted by
Leonardo, but partly also by his assistants.
The Buccleuch painting is that is the one secured by Florimond Robertet. But
the New York painting is emphatically no mere 'copy'.
Here is yet another exhibition which, like the Mantegna and the Rembrandt
shows, aims to kick a hole through rigid ideas of Old Master authorship.
From start to finish, the professor concludes, Leonardo had his hand in both
these beautiful little Madonnas; happily for their owners, both are 'fully
acceptable as works by Leonardo'.
Exhibition runs to July 12 Sponsored by Martini Brut

FT  28 JUL 92 / Arts: Lessons drawn from history - Drawing in Bologna
1500-1600
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most extraordinary features of the Renaissance in Italy is the
emergence of distinctive regional styles of painting and drawing. Among
these local schools the Bolognese only achieved the highest distinction with
the rise of the great triumvirate of the Carracci - Annibale, his brother
Ludovico, and their cousin, Agostino. This loan exhibition, Drawing in
Bologna 1500 - 1600 at the Courtauld Institute Galleries in London, the
fourth in a series of drawings shows organised by Sotheby's, ends where most
would begin.
Its finale concerns the early years of the Carracci in Bologna, before
Annibale's move to Rome and the classical triumph of the Farnese Gallery.
The main event allows a number of little - known artists to take the
spotlight. However, its fascination comes not so much from what it can teach
us about a neglected period of art or about the forerunners of one of the
greatest of painters, but because it reveals quite how unexpected and
exciting drawings can be.
Again and again it demonstrates how indifferent painters can turn out to be
distinguished, even influential, draughtsmen. Moreover, it highlights how
the medium of drawing allows a far greater freedom and spontaneity than is
ever available to a painter. A case in point is the substantial sheet - on
the evidence of this exhibition at least, there was no shortage of paper in
16th century Bologna - by Girolamo da Carpi.
Although as a rule hardly the most inspired of artists, he shows the flight
of Daedalus and Icarus against a romantic landscape with a memorably evoked
expanse of water. He has washed the paper a pale sepia to create a mid -
tone, and then added darker brown as well as white heightening to broaden
the tonal range, giving depth to the foliage, the landscape and to the
portentous clouds above the doomed Icarus. Pen is employed sparingly for the
figures, but it is these fluid ink washes that create an effect of real
poetry.
The visual qualities and technical range of these sheets more than outweigh
the undeniably recondite function of this show. Groups of drawings by, say,
Francesco Primaticcio and Bartolomeo Cesi reveal their mastery of red chalk.
The former favours a pinkish prepared ground for his graceful draped male
figure, the latter chooses blue paper of the kind first found in Venice for
his delightful study of a boy playing a viola da gamba. Neither is
especially prolific or celebrated as a painter, but they are both wholly in
their element on paper.
The exhibition also highlights the unpredictibility of the relationship
between an artist's way of drawing and way of painting. While there are many
artists - and the Flemish - born Denys Calvaert is the prime example here -
whose artistic personality remains the same whatever the medium, there are
others who seem to undergo a sea change.
There is considerable disagreement concerning the authorship of the
paintings variously given to Pellegrino Tibaldi and Nosadella, for example,
yet their drawing styles are quite distinct. Bartolomeo Passerotti is
another of these split personalities. Most of his paintings are not that
dissimilar from other late-Mannerist productions by the likes of Samacchini
and Sabatini - not the comic double act their names imply - but his drawings
are radically different.
Executed in a boldly hatched pen and ink technique, they are inspired by the
work of the Florentine Baccio Bandinelli, but go much further in their
freedom of touch. Three are particularly fine. One from Christ Church,
Oxford, is a preparatory study for a painting of the Adoration of the Magi,
in which the normal sequence of execution has been inverted.
Renaissance art treatises from Alberti onwards invariably recommend that
figures be studied in the nude and only then draped; it is evident here that
the nude studies came second.
There is every reason to believe that the study of the human figure from
life, which was one of the great revolutions of the Carracci academy, was
needed. Yet the way in which they - and Agostino in particular - used the
pen is inconceivable without the example of Passerotti.
His other great appeal is an eccentric fascination with low life, which
anticipated the genre studies of the Carracci. Hideous kissing couples,
slavering in a manner worthy of late Picasso, exotic animals and peoples,
are among the quirkiest of the period.
By the mid century Bologna had become a centre of scientific study, and
Passerotti's scrutiny of the more grotesque aspects of the natural world was
prompted by the explorations of his friend, Ulisse Aldrovandi, the noted
naturalist.
Here a splendidly repellent pair of demons, one all but concealing the
other, and an enchantingly flamboyant heraldic dragon, represent this side
of his art.
With the latest drawings - at least in this inevitably selective showing -
the honours are fairly evenly divided. The Carracci are rivalled if not
surpassed by the extravagant black chalk male nudes and boldly washed sheets
by Pietro Faccini. He is a Second Eleven painter but an unforgettable
draughtsman. You only have to look ahead to Guercino - who makes the first
team but arguably also excels on paper - to witness the effect a minor
master like Faccini can have.
The exhibition continues at the Courtauld Institute Galleries, Somerset
House, until August 31

<TEXT>     This feat has been accomplished through close collaboration with such
renowned artists as Lichtenstein, Salvador Dali, Victor Vasarely and Henry
Moore, and top contemporary talents including German's Jorg Immendorff and
Salome, Italy's Sandro Chia and American ceramicist Dorothy Hafner.;
Rosenthal has won more than 160 international design awards since 1961 -- more
than any other porcelain company -- and is beginning to make a statement in
the American luxury market.;    It has attracted leading artists not normally
associated with commercial projects and gathered a group of loyal collectors
for its limited edition works.;    Rosenthal was started in 1879 when Philipp
Rosenthal set up shop om the basement of a ruined manor house, Schloss
Erkersreuth, outside Selb, Germany. He bought a consignment of plain white
plates and had a painter brush on designs.;    The workshop prospered well
into the 1930s, when it employed 4,000 workers. As World War II approached,
Rosenthal, of Jewish descent, was ousted from the board and went into exile in
France.;    The founder's son, Philip, returned in 1950 as advertising
manager. Within eight years he was named managing director and began
implementing his ideas.;    "In the 17th and 18th centuries, porcelain was
original art -- baroque, rococo, empire," he said. "But in the last half of
the 19th century, the Industrial Revolution changed everything. Nothing was
handmade with care any more.;    "We at Rosenthal wanted to give porcelain
back some of its lost value. We wanted to raise the artistic level of
functional objects by producing not rehashed imitations of the old styles but
originals of our time, designed by contemporary artists. Why? Because nothing
imitated has any lasting value.";    The company divided its products into
three separate lines -- the Studio-Linie (Studio Line), made up of works by
contemporary artists -- "the genuine originals of our time"; the Classic Rose
Line, exact replicas of earlier shapes and traditional styles -- "the
originals of the past"; and the Thomas line, more functional products for
everyday use.;    It was the Studio-Linie name, changed to Rosenthal in 1988,
on which the company reputation was made and rests. It included Raymond
Loewy's sharply contemporary Shape 2000, a tea and table service designed in
the 1950s, as well as Scandinavian painter Bjorn Winblad's fantasy creations
in bright red, blue and gold.;    One major challenge was persuading leading
artists, many of whom disdained any hint of commercialism, to work for the
firm. One lure was the promise that products would be made in strictly limited
editions -- only six copies of Moore's two sculpted profiles, Moonhead, and
100 copies of Lichtenstein's tea set. Also limited were the unmistakable Dali
"clock" plates.;    The appeal of working with a new material like porcelain
attracted architects as well as painters and sculptors -- Italy's Mario
Bellini, even Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus movement, who created the
Gropius tea service.;    "I get a lot of the credit," said Rosenthal, 74, who
now serves as an adviser to the firm, "but all I did was find the right people
to put the ideas into effect -- from Walter Gropius onward.";    His son,
Turpin, told Andrew Bill in Town &amp; Country:;    "It's about time that people
returned to the old concept of using their art."  </TEXT>

FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: City overflowing with art - Patricia Morison gets to
know Rubens and his compatriots better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are sadly limited folk for whom true beauty exists only in the piazzas
of cities beyond the Alps. But if your senses respond to the north, then
Antwerp is without question one of the most beautiful cities of northern
Europe.
This great maritime city on the Scheldt has its sombre side, its rotting
Renaissance facades and defaced Baroque Calvaries. Nonetheless, to my mind
Victor Hugo's judgment is spot on; 'The city is delightful: paintings in the
churches, sculpture adorning the houses, Rubens in the chapels . . . the
city is literally overflowing with art.'
In Hugo's day, Antwerp's dozen or so museums did not exist. Nor, of course,
did the city's newly restored Central Station and any number of
extraordinary late-19th and early 20th-century architectural extravaganzas.
Now there is Antwerp 93, and a notable group of exhibitions which will
ensure that the art-lover will indeed find this a city overflowing with
pleasures.
Perhaps the key fact of Antwerp's history is that as capital of the Spanish
Netherlands, it was held for Catholicism. Any visit should therefore start
at Onze Lieve Vrouwe, the largest Gothic cathedral in the Low Countries. It
has been under restoration for decades, but Antwerp 93 speeded the programme
up.
The entire interior is again visible, with Rubens's three wonderful
altarpieces, cleaned and conserved, displayed at the east end. From May 26
to October 3, the cathedral has an exhibition, Antwerp Altarpieces, the type
of 15th- and 16th-century pieces shipped out in staggering quantities for
churches from England to South America.
Any civilised visit to Antwerp must be partly about getting to know Rubens
better. An unusual exhibition at the Rubenshuis will shed light on the
running of the many highly successful artists' 'factories' of the day.
Rubens Cantoor (which means 'workroom') shows 80 copies of drawings by
Rubens loaned from Copenhagen. Most were made by Willem Panneels, who was
put in charge of the studio between 1628 and 1630 while the master was in
England and Spain (May 15 to June 27).
So intimate is the view of the artist conveyed by the famous Rubenshuis that
you will surely want to round things off with a visit to the Rockoxhuis, the
sumptuous Renaissance mansion which was home to Burgomaster Nicolaas Rockox,
Rubens's friend and patron. And of course, a pilgrimage is required to St
Jacobskerk. Above the wonderfully elegant tomb of the lord of Steen is his
last masterpiece, The Madonna with Saints.
Jacob Jordaens at the Museum of Fine Arts (27 March-27 June 27) is the
flagship exhibition of Antwerpen 93, celebrating 400 years since the
artist's birth. When gout carried Rubens off in 1640, Jordaens immediately
put up his prices. Over the next four decades of this artist's long career,
the Jordaens studio continued to be hugely successful even though its
master's talent declined as Rubens's never had. This should be the year and
the show to reevaluate Jordaens's achievement.
Antwerp: Story of a Metropolis at the Hessenhuis is a major exhibition
mounted by historian Jan van Stock to examine the image and the reality of
Antwerp's two first Golden Ages, in the 16th century and again in the early
17th century. Pride of the city throughout that period was the famous
printing dynasty of the Plantins. It is not only bibliophiles who find the
Museum Plantin-Moretus a place of rare fascination. So long as you are
prepared to peer, books, prints, letters and bills bring the political and
intellectual world of these centuries vividly to life.
Here, too, are portraits by Rubens, an intimate friend of the great
Balthasar Moretus. The Plantin-Moretus marks Antwerpen 93 by looking at the
scientific side of the humanist culture so important to Rubens and his
circle. Botany in the Southern Netherlands (13 March-June 13) comemmorates
the studies of the three great Flemish botanists, Dodoens, Clusius and
Lobelius, whose illustrated treatises were all published by the Moretus
presses.
Although its role in the Festival programme is small, the Museum Mayer van
den Bergh cannot be missed, for it is one of the most remarkable
19th-century museums in the world. Mayer Van den Bergh was a wealthy
connoisseur and art-collector. He never married - the story goes that he was
always looking for a girl with the face of a late-Gothic Virgin Mary.
Van den Bergh died in his early thirties. In 1904, his mother built the
exquisite neo-Renaissance mansion with its intimate rooms. Original cases
still house manuscripts, Byzantine and early medieval ivories, 12th-century
sculpture, coins and a fine collection of Nethelandish and Flemish
paintings. Few art-lovers realise that Breughel's chilling 'Dulle Griet' is
hidden away in the Mayer van den Bergh with his 'Twelve Proverbs', two of
only seven of the artist's works remaining in Belgium.
Diamonds enter the festival in Diamond Jewellery from Antwerp's Golden Age
(April 23-September 26). At the city's distinguished Ethnographic Museum,
there will be The Face of the Spirits: Masks from Zaire (September
19-December 31). The contemporary art programme has not been finalised but
summer will see openings at the Middelheim Open-air Sculpture Museum, the
Museum for Fine Arts, and the Museum of Contemporary Art.
A marvellous guide-book for exploring Antwerp is Derek Blyth's Flemish
Cities Explored (Bodley Head, 1990). It would be nice if in Antwerp's great
year of culture, every one of the chapels, mansions and gardens therein
recommended might indeed be accessible.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Collecting: Taste of the unexpected - Two London galleries
celebrate special anniversaries this summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO LONDON galleries celebrate anniversaries this summer. To mark its 175th
year, Agnew's shows some 50 works of art chosen to emphasise the perhaps
unexpected range of the gallery's activities (June 9-July 24).
The company offers paintings from Fra Angelico panels to a cool, Cubist
Braque, Old Master drawings, sculpture and a group of prints that extend
from Piranesi capricci to Jasper Johns' flags. British works, from
Gainsborough and Zoffany to John Wonnacott, take in a clutch of Turner
watercolours plus a Venetian oil that, initially valued at Dollars 25m,
(Pounds 14.1m) is thought to be the most expensive picture on sale in the
world.
Those already in possession of the anniversary catalogue will be
disappointed not to find the portraits by Sebastiano and Goya, the
Giaquinto, Tintoretto's Desecent from the Cross and The Sleeping Shepherd by
Samuel Palmer. Agnew's, however, is pleased to count them among eight works
already sold. Any holes on the walls are to be filled by a pair of Guardis
and an Aert van der Neer skating scene that has not been on the market since
the 19th century and has found itself back at Agnew's once more.
As that show closes, The Leger Galleries open with a predominantly loan
exhibition of Samuel Palmer which marks a century of art dealing (until July
24). All 29 works have a Leger provenance. Palmer is an inspired choice for
a centenary show, given Harold Leger's fondness for an artist who has become
one of the nation's most beloved landscape painters. It is also a courageous
choice given that Leger was famously duped in the 1970s by four of Keating's
ingenious Palmer pastiches.
With the glowing exception of the oil and tempera The Shearers which is on
loan from the Tate, the show comprises watercolours and drawings. The
selection is striking too for its emphasis not on the visionary works of the
Shoreham years but on the less familiar late works which, as Raymond Lister
argues in the catalogue, are less intense but rarely less romantic or poetic
idylls of the English countryside. Palmer enthusiasts should not miss the
treat.
Further up Bond Street, The Fine Art Society offers perhaps the most
unexpected show of the season: 'Gibson to Gilbert: British Sculpture
1840-1914' (until July 2). The core of this group of 65 works is the
outstanding collection put together by John Lewis, and previously on
extended loan to the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Its particular strength
is the New Sculpture that revolutionised British sculpture in the last two
decades of the 19th century, an area of collecting in which the gallery
first became involved in 1902. The New sculptors promoted sculpture for the
home - hence the profusion here of reduced-size casts of domestic scale but
museum quality.
The genius here is Sir Alfred Gilbert of Eros fame. He not only revived the
infinitely subtle 'lost-wax' bronze-casting technique and developed a taste
for combining metals, ivory and semi-precious stones, but invested his
sculpture with a powerful personal symbolism. The exhibition, with its
excellent catalogue by Benedict Read, also includes works by Bayes, Boehm,
Frampton and Hamo Thornycroft, as well as the painter-sculptors Lord
Leighton, GF Watts and Alfred Stevens. Here, too, are Dalou, who taught in
London, and Carpeaux who exhibited here. Prices range from Pounds
2,200-Pounds 110,000.
Italian and German 16th and 17th century bronzes plus Old Master drawings
after Antique and Renaissance sculpture, and preparatory sketches for
sculpture, are among the various works of art in the combined show of
Trinity Fine Art and Katrin Bellinger, at Harari and Johns Ltd (June 24-July
10). We find, say, Girolamo da Carpi drawing from various Roman sources, and
sheets after Michelangelo by Battista Franco, Salviati and Tintoretto. An
unusual Paulus van Vianen is a design for a lost silver plaquette.
WR Harvey's seventh summer exhibition (until June 27) focuses on the
furniture of the period of the four Georges, organised into four room sets.
The show is worth visiting not least to see the loans which include a
spectacular pair of gilt Palladian armchairs made to the designs of William
Kent by Benjamin Goodison in 1730, rich in classical detail and metaphor.
Oriental porcelain dealers S. Marchant &amp; Son is also staging its seventh
summer show (June 7-26). It is, the firm believes, the first commercial show
devoted to Qing mark and period monochrome and two-coloured wares. The 60 or
so exhibits, predominantly 18th century, have been gathered mostly from
private collections over several years. Within the show's self-imposed
parameters (there is understandably no blue and white, say), the quality and
range in terms of ware and form are impressive.
Monochrome porcelains are for the purist, for their success depends entirely
on form and colour - and the glazes are glorious. Such a spectrum of colour
had not been seen before in ceramic art. Here we find pale lavender,
celadon, peachbloom, red, brilliant yellow and lemon, purple, aubergine,
blue, green, turquoise and brown. Prices range from Pounds 1,600-Pounds
70,000. The handsome hardback catalogue (Pounds 30 inc p&amp;p), with an
introduction by John Ayers, should prove a useful reference work.
Spink's present another first: an exhibition of the much derided Satsuma
pottery of 19th century Japan (until June 19). Its 50 choice pieces have
been selected to prove that there is a difference of chalk and cheese
between the mass-produced - and still much in evidence - Satsuma export
wares and the spectacular show pieces - often intended for World Fairs -
produced by specialised workshops and studios in Kyoto and Osaka. The show
presents the work of the greatest Satsuma potters and artists, including
five pieces by the unrivalled Sozan. Prices are Pounds 1,500-Pounds 38,000.
Barling of Mount Street launch the first in a series of annual exhibitions
designed to show a representative example of what the firm normally carries
in stock (June 9-26). On show is a set of three 16th century Japanese fusuma
or sliding door panels now mounted as screens, 17th century Chinese lacquer
trays and boxes, Sui and Yuan dynasty sculpture and a group of 16th and 17th
century Chinese hardwood furniture. The cataloque is prefaced with an
impassioned plea for the sympathetic conservation of such furniture, the
original surfaces of which have been so often destroyed by abrasives and
chemical solvents during careless restoration. Prices, Pounds 2,500-Pounds
75,000.
Linda Wrigglesworth is host of Sue Olleman's exhibition of 19th century gold
and moghul jewellery from the Indian subcontinent (June 18-27). Jehanne de
Biolley shows a service of mostly 19th century apple green Peking glass
(June 9-26).
Surprisingly colourful quilts made in the Amish communities of Ohio, Indiana
and Pennsylvania in 1900-1950 - the forms and colour combinations of which
were to prove so influential to the early American Abstract painters in the
1950s - are to be found at Browse &amp; Darby until June 20. Prices Pounds
3,500-Pounds 7,500.
Wildenstein presents a fascinating exhibition of the Russian artist Marevna
and her friends in Montparnasse 1912-42 (June 17-September 16). The show
marks the centenary of her birth, and is organised in association with the
Musee du Petit Palais, Geneva. First a Cubist, exhibiting at the Salon des
Independents in 1913, she moved on to Pointillism before curiously combining
the two styles.
Inevitably, however, much of the show's interest rests on Marevna as a
chronicler of Bohemian society. Many of her pictures and drawings portrays
her friends, Diego Rivera (the father of her child), Picasso, Chagall,
Leger, Modigliani, Soutine and Gorky among them. On show are some 30
Marevnas plus the work of some 20 friends, including Blanchard, van Dongen,
Foujita, Laurencin and Soutine.
More Russian pictures can be found in the Roy Miles summer show (until July
9). Jonathan Clark's Modern show (until June 27) is particularly strong on
the Scottish Colourists, with works by Cadell, Cursiter and Peploe. Many of
the British artists exhibited there also take a bow at Spink's 20th century
show (until June 26). Here we also find a Vorticist watercolour by Wyndham
Lewis and a recently discovered Duncan Grant portrait of Vanessa Bell.
Prices: Pounds 1,000-Pounds 100,000.

<HEAD>Wright's Stuff: Industrial Artist Gets 1st Major Show 200 Years
After Death</HEAD>
<HEAD>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One artist grasped the importance of what was
happening in England in the 18th century when he chose scientific
demonstrations, iron forges and blacksmiths' shops for his
``peculiar'' subjects.
   Joseph Wright's first major show in London, opening today, comes
almost 200 years after his death.
   ``He deserved one before but this often happens in England,''
said Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Gallery, at Tuesday's
preview.
   To avoid confusion with artists of the same name, Wright was
known in his lifetime as Wright of Derby, the Midlands town where
he was born and worked. He died in 1797 and the title has stuck
ever since.
   His most famous picture is of a group of people watching a
demonstrator pump air from a glass globe, causing a bird inside to
flutter in distress as it loses oxygen. The viewers react in
fascination or shock and one covers her eyes.
   A critic who saw it in 1768 wrote: ``Mr. Wright, of Derby, is a
very great and uncommon genius, in a peculiar way.''
   In those days, ``peculiar'' meant ``individual'' or ``unlike
others,'' says the exhibition organizer, Judy Egerton, who has
gathered about 200 works from around the world for the show.
   Two years earlier, Wright had shown another unique painting, of
a lecturer explaining the workings of an orrery, a clockwork model
of the solar system. His listeners, including two little boys, are
entranced and one man makes notes.
   There are no pictures like these anywhere else, art historians
say.
   The scene in each painting is illuminated by a candle lamp,
demonstrating Wright's mastery of light effects. His industrial
pictures show workers lit by the fires at which they work metals.
   Wright's scientific and industrial paintings won for him the
honor of being the first artist to directly express the spirit of
the industrial revolution.
   He was gripped by fire and light and returning in 1775 from a
visit to Italy he brought his paintings of the annual firework
display in Rome, the Girandola, and of a nighttime eruption of the
Vesuvius volcano.
   All these are in the Tate show along with many of the portraits,
by which Wright earned the bulk of his income.
   ``Wright fell into obscurity in the 19th century but in the
1920s he was appreciated by American collectors,'' Serota said.
   His paintings then rose in value. In 1984, London's National
Gallery paid $1.7 million at auction for his portrait, ``Mr. and
Mrs. Coltman.''
   Wright had charged Coltman 63 pounds for it in 1771, then the
equivalent of about $300.
   The ``Wright of Derby'' exhibition goes to Paris this summer and
to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in the fall, the
first time the Tate has loaned a show to the Met, Serota added.
   ``Wright captures the excitement of scientific discovery,'' said
David Fraser, curator of Derby's museums.
   Derby Art Gallery has the largest collection of Wright's work
because its residents admired him and contributed in Victorian
times to the museum's purchase of his paintings.
   In the 1960s, the Derby church he was buried in was demolished
and its site now lies under a beltway. His remains were so
carelessly reburied in a local cemetery that no one now quite knows
where they are, the curator said.
   The exhibition is at the Tate Gallery through April 22, at the
Paris Grand Palais May 17 through July 23 and at the New York
Metropolitan Museum of Art Sept. 6 through Dec. 2.

Between artworks, costumed actors portraying Lazarus -- the man Jesus raised
from the dead -- and his sisters, Mary and Martha, recount their memories of
Jesus. A 34-piece orchestra and a 120-voice choir provide a rich musical
background, drawing extensively on Handel's "Messiah" but also including
"Silent Night" and pieces especially composed for this year's pageant.
</P>
<P>
"We do this as our unique way of presenting Easter," said David Halverson,
minister of worship, music and drama at the church. "We started it because we
thought it might attract people, and it did."
</P>
<P>
The church, which has a 1,100-seat sanctuary, expects 6,000 people to see the
pageant during its seven performances. It is open to everyone, not just church
members.
</P>
<P>
Though the artworks vary from year to year, Leonardo Da Vinci's "The Last
Supper" is one of the most popular, according to Halverson and the pageant's
artistic director, Rassie Harper. And one of the most spectacular is Thomas
DeKeyser's "Crucifixion," in which three men are suspended 12 feet above the
floor. This work comes complete with a crashing thunder-and-lightning effect.
</P>
<P>
Harper, a retired Gardena firefighter, said the pageant is a form of worship
for the volunteer church members who put it on. "It is a wonderful way to use
the talent God gave me and in turn, giving glory to Him, a way of giving
thanks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Karen Bostelaar, who lives on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, has portrayed Mary
for the last two years in the "Pieta," the serene marble sculpture by
Michelangelo of the crucified Jesus and his mother. "Last year during the
performance, I got such an overwhelming feeling of sadness that I started to
cry," she said. "I know how Mary must have felt."
</P>
<P>
Bostelaar said being in the pageant again this year was very important to her
after a diagnosis of breast cancer last August, followed by a mastectomy and
chemotherapy. "I thought that it might be the last year," she said, adding with
a smile that everything "looks good" now.
</P>
<P>
If the pageant is a deepening of faith for the church members who paint the
artworks, model, work backstage and provide the music, getting the whole thing
ready for the public can have its light moments.
</P>
<P>
During a rehearsal this week, one of the disciples wore a Hobie sweat shirt,
and the Prodigal Son sported a blue T-shirt that proclaimed Action Tools. And
the "Crucifixion" painting was missing a key member: Jesus. It seems that the
man portraying him was outside and missed his cue.
</P>
<P>
Carl Ibscher of Lawndale, who plays Nicodemus in the reproduction of a
16th-Century bronze plaque, recalls that when a painting of Christ calming the
waters was portrayed last year, one of the men who played a disciple wore a
skipper's hat.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old Pageant of the Masters in Laguna Beach was the model for this
pageant, which strives to make every live work look identical to the original.
In "The Last Supper," even the worn look of the fresco -- its cracks, chips and
the doorway that was cut into it -- is captured.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, church artists have learned that even the great masters made
mistakes about dimensions or deliberately distorted them. In "The Last Supper,"
Harper said, one of the disciples is extending a knife. But no one's arm could
be that long, so the pageant model holds a stick attached to a foam-rubber hand
and knife.
</P>
<P>
Wood and cardboard are used to create depth, and stiff painted muslin serves as
the backgrounds and clothing that cover the figures. In most instances, the
live models fit themselves into the work by thrusting their heads or limbs
through the background and blending into what has been painted. There are few
full, costumed figures.
</P>
<P>
Harper said lighting and makeup are key ingredients. The makeup, he said, "like
painting . . . might change the mouth or make the cheekbone protruded or look
sunken in."
</P>
<P>
White body makeup and glycerin give the sheen of marble to the models in the
"Pieta." It looks so real, Harper said, that "you'd expect the marble to crack
if anybody moved." Gerald Faris

FT  22 JUN 93 / Arts: Back to real painting - William Packer admires the
work of Michael Leonard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the fatuities and empty posturings of the larger portion of the Venice
Biennale, it is a relief to return to paint on canvas, properly achieved,
and to work that draws directly upon the real and visible world. The
apparatchiks and fellow-travellers of the academic avant-garde may find it
hard to accept: it may be that never again will anything but the
conceptually kite-marked - fauna in formaldehyde (Damien Hirst) or
pseudo-profound philosophising (Richard Hamilton) - be allowed to represent
us: but true painting goes on, as it always will, honourably, insistently,
privately.
It was put to me in Venice that for an artist thus to consult his own
experience was but self-indulgence. With the world falling apart less than a
hundred miles away, was it not ever more the artist's duty to engage with
the issues of the day - nationalism, capitalism, Aids or whatever. Pity the
poor artist who came in from the incorrect side, but even so the idea was
all, the means incidental, the technical quality of the statement
irrelevant. The essential question was not: what is this work as art? It
was: what is it about?
This is the greatest heresy. We no more require to be hectored in our
politics or social morality by artists than by actors or singers. In Venice
the proof lay all about us, where we could find Tiepolo at his most
magisterial while waiting for the boat, and the greatest of Bellini on
stepping off. And the point of such art was never the message itself, for
the preaching was always to the converted. Rather it lies with what each
artist did, technical mastery and the creative, humane imagination resolved
into an integral whole. The artist's duty is only to get the work right as
he knows it, that we may then test its integrity against our own experience.
There is nothing self-indulgent in that.
Michael Leonard is unlikely ever to be asked to represent us at Venice, but
he is nevertheless one of the most serious and particular painters of the
figure that we have. As such he is a member of a band as tiny as it is
distinguished and as conspicuously neglected - Euan Uglow and Victor Newsome
are others who come to mind, particular differences notwithstanding - whose
work owes nothing to expressionism, nothing to immediacy or overt
spontaneity of gesture, and everything to the long, unremitting study of the
life-figure.
Leonard came to painting in his late thirties - he is now 60 - after an
early career in graphic design. He had command from the start of a
meticulous technique, but at first relied over-much on photographic
reference for his imagery, with all the perceptual limitations that follow -
the camera never lies, and never tells the whole truth. What makes his work
so interesting and convincing now is that he has developed from that
position without ever denying or abandoning it.
For the photograph has its uses, properly interpreted and understood, and
Leonard clearly still makes much use of it. In the organisation of the
composition especially, with the interruption of the figure by the frame,
and in the close fore-shortening of the space, the influence of the camera
is undeniable. In the actual disposition of the figure, too, in poses that
if not actually awkward, are certainly unsustainable over an extended
period, the photograph again is a necessary aid. And yet how much there is
now in evidence that could only have been done before the model. The form is
modelled deep into the shadows where only the eye could follow it, and
through and across the lit form, close to the picture-plane, flesh and bone
are described with a subtlety of surface variation, of tone, colour and
texture, that could only have been picked up directly.
His single nude bathers, male and female, stoop and twist to dry themselves:
the man touches his foot in the classic attitude of the crouching Mercury:
the woman in profile reaches up to tie her headscarf. The echo is of Degas,
but while the images as images recall the older artist, the quality of the
paint itself is that of the young Degas, the surface highly finished,
looking to Ingres and the romantic afterglow of neo-classicism. It is a
potent and particular brew. My only reservation is with the painting of some
of the heads of hair, that would seem to have been painted neither from
model nor reference, but made up afterwards, a surprising inconsistency.
I end with two last-minute recommendations. The new Giorgio Morandi Museum
at Bologna opens in October, which event has been anticipated at the
Accademia Italiana, where five choice works from the collection have been on
show for some time. This is the final week, next Sunday the final day. Two
landscapes, a pot of flowers and two still-lifes cover the career, from the
1930s to the 1950s, of the most refined and exquisite painter of our time,
whose 'self-indulgence' in the thing seen, form in space established with
the utmost simplicity, touches the heart, telling us more of what it is to
believe than any polemic.
And Dennis Creffield has returned to painting after his graphic pilgrimage
around the great churches of England and France. An extended stay at
Petworth saw him installed in the very room and painting from the very
window from which Turner took his own view out across the Park. While paying
due respect to the distinguished ghost, Creffield made his own way and found
his own Petworth, expressionist and idiosyncratic. The paintings of the
South End facade, rising like palazzi on the Grand Canal, are especially
impressive.

Street W1, until July 16. Giorgio Morandi: Five paintings from Bologna;

FT  22 AUG 92 / Arts: Going Dutch in the Gallery - Low Countries paintings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN past times, 'Seventy-Six Notable Paintings of the Dutch Golden Age' could
have served as the title for the National Gallery of Scotland's beautiful
exhibition. What you will see - hung rather too densely for comfort - is a
feast of paintings by Rembrandt, Hals, Cuyp, Saenredam, Ruisdael, Steen, and
de Hooch, plus a host of other Dutch 17th Century masters.
Such an over-stuffed exhibition demands several visits. Upstairs, too, there
is a subsidiary display showing Dutch artists' influence on Scottish
painters such as Sir David Wilkie and on miscellaneous other artists in the
Gallery.
But however many visits you make, it would surely be impossible to part
without a pang from two inexpressibly poetic late landscapes by Jacob van
Ruisdael, A View of Haarlem from the Bleaching Grounds and A Distant View of
Alkmaar. They belong to the Earl of Wemyss and March and have not been
publicly exhibited since 1957.
Given all that, one might ask whether there could be anything much wrong
with Dutch Art and Scotland: A Reflection of Taste. But the flabby title
hints at a fundamental problem with the way the show has been conceived -
even though visitors can perfectly well ignore it and simply concentrate on
enjoying the pictures.
The difficulty comes from the so-called relevance of these masterpieces to
Scotland. Plugging Scotland obviously makes sense politically and as a
marketing ploy. Edinburgh must be one of the only public galleries in the
world where guards wear national costume, namely those fetching tartan trews
 -also sported at the show's opening by the director, Mr Timothy Clifford.
But who can really think it matters that all these masterpieces have at one
time or another been owned by Scots? Or rather, to be absolutely accurate,
nearly all of them. One that was not, Domenicus Van Wijnen's hallucinatory
Temptation of St Anthony was for a period kept in Scotland by Arthur Kay, an
English Edwardian collector with a passion for Scotland. Eventually, he gave
this exceedingly peculiar picture to the National Gallery of Ireland.
Almost the first painting in the exhibition is Daniel Mytens's full-length
portrait of the third Marquis of Hamilton, resplendent in silver-grey silk,
painted in the 1620s when Mytens was in England. Tracing the many
connections between wealthy Scottish connoisseurs and contemporary Dutch art
of the 17th and 18th Century really does add up to something.
In fact, it could be the beginnings of a rather fascinating sideline to the
Festival if you tracked down other Dutch artists active in independent
Scotland, for example at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh and Hopetoun House,
the spectacular house just outside the city which Festival-goers ought to
put on their maps.
A diligent catalogue points out that in the 17th and 18th centuries there
were particularly close and fruitful links between Scotland and the
Netherlands. Here were two small countries with an expertise in banking, an
intellectual passion for Roman law, shared Calvinist convictions (hence, it
is claimed, Scottish patrons particularly appreciated moralising Dutch
pictures), and a passion for golf.
For that period, at least, the theme of Scots-Dutch cultural relations works
fine. But things become far more tenuous in the case of figures who did not
buy Dutch art, but merely inherited it.
One notable case is the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, who in the
late-18th century acquired superb Dutch paintings by marriage to the heiress
of the Northamptonshire family of Montagu. (By the way, another outing well
worth making is to Boughton House at Kettering, the superb house and
art-collection of the Dukes of Buccleuch, open on August afternoons.)
From another Buccleuch house, Drumlanrig Castle, comes the most beautiful of
the cabinet paintings in the exhibition, a Wooded Landscape by Moonlight by
Van der Neer, and also two paintings which were sold this century:
Rembrandt's celebrated Flora, lent by the National Gallery in London, and
the late Self-Portrait of 1659, now in Washington.
But do such ins and outs of provenance really add up to very much?
Sometimes, admittedly, they can be piquant. One of my favourite paintings in
the exhibition is a large Cuyp, The Riding Lesson, which shows gentlemen
schooling their horses on a golden afternoon. Now in Toledo, Ohio, it was
looted from the Rothschilds for that assiduous non-Scottish collector,
Hermann Goering.
There are 10 Rembrandts - or nearly Rembrandts depending on your view of
recent de-attributions - in the exhibition, including Titus at his Desk from
Rotterdam and the Queen's An Old Woman, both recently exhibited in London,
so it is nice they have now travelled north.
Five of these great paintings belong to Scottish public collections; the
famous Self Portrait aged 51 has been on loan from the Dukes of Sutherland
to the Gallery in Edinburgh since 1946. The famous Woman in Bed came to the
Gallery thanks to William MacEwan of the brewing dynasty. In the 1880s,
depressed that Scotland could boast no Rembrandt on public view, he
presented the Trustees with Pounds 5,000 and told them to buy the first
decent Rembrandt which came on the market. Now there is a case of patriotism
and taste - a moral example to modern magnates, north and south of the
Border.

<HEAD>American Jasper Johns Wins New Acclaim at Venice Biennale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRY LEONARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three decades after Jasper Johns sent art's
avante-garde spinning off in new directions, the world's most
expensive living artist is winning new acclaim at the prestigious
Venice Biennale.
   But although the American captured this year's Grand Prix, an
award previously won by such artists as Henri Matisse and Max
Ernst, some experts feel compelled to defend the choice.
   ``There is an incredibly widespread assumption that Johns is an
old master and a pop artist, assumptions that pigeonhole him, that
do not recognize he is an artist in his prime,'' said Philip Ryland
of the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, reacting to what he
called superficial criticism of the show.
   Since its beginning in 1895, the Biennale has enhanced the
reputations of artists generally not widely known outside their own
countries.
   ``Henry Moore's international reputation was established by
winning the Grand Prix for sculpture in 1948,'' said Ryland.
   Johns doesn't need the Biennale to reaffirm his role in 20th
century art. His importance is demonstrated by the price he
commands. His painting ``Diver'' sold for $4.2 million, the highest
price paid for a work by a living artist.
   About 300,000 people are expected to visit the international
exposition before it closes Sept. 25. Many will see Johns' work for
the first time. Some will come because he won the prize, others
because the domed, pink brick U.S. pavilion is the only one air
conditioned among the 25 nestled in the Biennale gardens, which
overlook the lagoon.
   Ryland said Johns is seen in this show at his high point, with
his crosshatch paintings and his most explicitly autobiographical
work.
   ``What this show reveals, not only for Europeans, is how far
Johns has developed from a few flags, targets and numbers,'' Ryland
said in an interview.
   Johns and others such as Robert Rauschenberg, who won the
Biennale's Grand Prix in 1964, created an alternative to abstract
expressionism, the dominant American style of the 1940s and 50s.
   At his first show in January 1958, Johns heralded the pop art
movement of the 60s with his paintings of common objects _ American
flags, targets and numbers.
   ``Some said art had been thrown back into the world of common
images,'' Ryland said. ``But the theft was in the opposite
direction, it was a theft of popular images. He dragged the flag
into the world of art.''
   Now, 30 years after that dramatic opening at the Castelli
Gallery in New York, Johns wins the ``Golden Lion'' in Venice, one
of the world's most influential exhibitions of modern art.
   ``It was important to give the prize to Jasper Johns,'' said
Adriano Donaggio, the spokesman for the Biennale. ``He has been a
leader of his generation, but he never got the prize.''
   Both Donaggio and Ryland emphasized that his career was only one
consideration made by the international jury and that the most
important was the show at the Biennale.
   The show put together by the Philadelphia Museum of Art is the
first major exhibition for Johns since the retrospective that
opened at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York in 1977.
   Johns works and reworks his surfaces, using oil and encaustic, a
mixture of colored pigment in hot wax. He also evokes dream-like
images with ink on plastic.
   ``His show is outstanding,'' Ryland said. ``In pictorial terms
it is much better than anything else in the Biennale.''
   He added that other renowned artists such as Cy Twombly, Enzo
Cucchi and Alberto Burri were weakly represented at this Biennale.
   Johns' works demonstrate his progression over the last 15 years,
from the crosshatch and flagstone patterns of the 70s to the
autobiographical paintings of the 1980s.
   The works in the show also include ``Scent,'' the first devoted
entirely to the crosshatch style. The painting is done in oil and
encaustic on three canvases in bright, bold, interlocking groups of
strokes at various opposing angles.
   ``Racing Thoughts'' and ``The Seasons'' are John's most
autobiographical, presenting images closely linked to the artist
such as a picture of Leo Castelli, who gave him his first show;
pottery from his own collection, the double flag; and a printed
image of the Mona Lisa that recalls his affection for both Marcel
Duchamp and Leonardo da Vinci.
   In ``The Seasons,'' four paintings done in 1985-86, Johns also
puts himself in his work for the first time by putting his shadow
among the images.
   In addition to the work of Johns and other established artists
from 44 countries are 86 ``young artists'' in the open section.
   ``There are artists here that in 10 years will be household
names,'' said Ryland.
   One could be Barbara Bloom, the American who won this year's
prize for the open section.

   The first exhibition to probe the artistic
dialogue between Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque during the years
they collaborated on Cubism has opened at the Museum of Modern Art.
   It is perhaps the most important art event of the season, for
Cubism was possibly a vision that could only have succeeded with
the collective creativity of the two masters.
   ``We were like mountain climbers roped together,'' Braque
recalled.
   ``Almost every evening, either I went to Braque's studio or
Braque came to mine. Each of us had to see what the other had done
during the day,'' Picasso once said.
   Picasso and Braque pushed art beyond its traditional scope to a
pure abstraction. Through Cubism, which utilized cubes and other
geometric shapes to create forms, the two changed modern art.
   The exhibition includes 390 works in all mediums used by both
Picasso (1881-1973) and Braque (1882-1963). The works are on loan
from collections in Moscow, Leningrad, Paris, London, Stockholm,
Prague and Basel, and were also taken from the Museum of Modern
Art's own collection.

FT  28 MAY 93 / Arts: The Monarch in Madrid - The Victorian art exhibition
visiting the Prado
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIAL MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This summer, 'The Monarch of the Glen' is not in its offical home at the
headquarters of United Distillers in Edinburgh. Landseer's immortal image of
a stag in its Highland fastness is now casting its spell over a new public.
Together with Frith's 'Railway Station', a close competitor for title of
Most Famous Victorian Painting, the Monarch is now in Madrid with the
British Council's exhibition, Victorian Paintings from Turner to Whistler.
This enjoyable survey contains more than a hundred paintings and several
drawings by a great number of artists. They have been lent from the royal
collection and from public collections in some remarkably obscure corners of
the British Isles, as well as by numerous private collectors. The Prado's
civilised exhibition space is its last stop (ends July 31). As a great plus,
there is a small exhibition of Victorian photographs of great quality which
complement the paintings beautifully.
In its first fortnight the show has drawn a large attendance of Madrilenans.
The hope is that Victorian Paintings will fill what may well be a very
substantial gap in many visitors' knowledge of art. Victorian painting is
almost unknown in Spanish public collections. (Let us remember, however,
that the reverse is just as true.) The Prado owns barely half a dozen
19th-century Victorian paintings, the most recently acquired being a superb
evocation by David Roberts of the interior of the great mosque in Cordoba.
Last century and this, Spanish private collectors held off the Victorians.
In the homes of the aristocracy, there are the same kind of English hunting
and horsey paintings which are to be found the world over. However, this
exhibition marks Spain's first encounter with the strand of mid-century
narrative paintings such as Abraham Solomon's 'Contrast' (the rude health of
French fisherfolk on the beach contrasted with the consumptive young
Englishwoman sketching them with a limp hand in her bathchair) and Egley's
'Omnibus Life in London'.
The Prado will therefore also be a first time many visitors will have
encountered the Pre-Raphaelites. The leaders of the Brotherhood come out of
the show rather poorly. However, the later generation of the PRB is strongly
represented. 'Isabel' by the little-known John Melhush Strudwick, and John
William Waterhouse's 'Belle Dame Sans Merci' (his most famous work is the
Tate's 'Ophelia'), almost take us to the end of the century. In the latter,
we see how much English artists had come to admire the technique of Jules
Bastien Lepage.
Something which may surprise any visitor brought up on cliches about
Victorian morality is the Pre-Raphaelites' intensely eroticised view of
women. Rosetti's 'Blue Bower' from the Barber Institute uses vibrant colours
and also the beloved 'language of flowers' to express sheer lust. His
flame-haired model, Fanny Cornforth, is bowered by passion-flowers and
morning-glory as symbols of the artist's infatuation. Strewn corn-flowers
are her emblem.
More suggestive still, to the point of being comical, is the drawing of
'Proud Maisie' by Frederick Sandys. His mistress is in profile, the hair
cascading over her shoulders drawn with a scrupulosity which recalls
Leonardo's sketches of water. Sandys' mistress bites a strand of hair and
frowns, a petulant and predatory young woman who alerts us to the later
century's growing alarm in the face of discoveries about the unstable,
disorderly female psyche.
The Aesthetic Movement and the British Realist School are well shown. Frank
Holl's 'Gone', a study of emigrants at the Liverpool docks, was a painting
which strongly impressed the young Van Gogh. However, the latest painting to
be included is Sargent's portrait of the Sitwell family, Sir George and Lady
Sitwell with their famous children, Edith, Osbert and Sacheverell. It is a
fitting note on which to end. For one thing, Sargent loved Velazquez and
learned much from him about the full-length portrait. Then again, this is a
picture which testifies to the continuity of English upper-class life and
taste between the mid-century and the eve of the First World War. But
Sargent has also painted the young coming generation which was savagely to
deride and destroy so much that the Victorian era held to be true and
important.

<HEAD>Giorgio Cavallon, Pioneer in Abstract Expressionism, Dead at 85</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Artist Giorgio Cavallon, considered a pioneer of
abstract expressionism, has died at age 85.
   Cavallon, who died Friday night at New York Hospital, had a
following among poets and painters even though his work was not
widely known.
   ``I had conditioned myself to think of him as a lesser artist.
But he kept showing us to be wrong in that,'' said William Agee, a
historian of American art.
   Abstract expressionism is characterized by an emphasis on the
artist's spontaneous and self-expressive application of paint in
creating a non-representational composition. Cavallon's paintings
often featured color rectangles with soft, irregular edges.
   The artist was born in the village of Sorio in Italy in 1904.
During World War I, he lived on an uncle's farm, where he drew in
the earth or scratched drawings on bombshells.
   In 1920, he came to the United States, settling with his family
in Springfield, Mass. Six years later, he moved to New York.
   He began as a figurative painter at the National Academy of
Design. He began exploring abstract expressionism in the 1930s but
like other abstract expressionists did not take the full plunge
until the late 1940s.
   In 1936, he was a founding member of the American Abstract
Artists, a contentious and polemical group that championed the
cause of abstract art.
   Cavallon preferred to do everything by hand, including building
his own freezer, stove and sofa. He even made his own paints.
   His work was exhibited in several New York galleries and last
year was shown at the Peggy Guggenheim Foundation in Venice, Italy.
His work is in several major museums' collections, including New
York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and Museum of Modern Art.
   Cavallon's first marriage to singer Fabiola Caron ended in
divorce. He later married painter Linda Lindeberg. She died in 1973.
   He is survived by two sisters.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- The Gallery: Braque From Beginning to End </HL>
<AUTHOR> Jack Flam </AUTHOR>

<DATELINE> New York  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although the French painter Georges Braque (1882-1963) is considered one of the masters of 20th-century art, he also is an artist whose reputation is in an odd way still in the making.
Or, in certain quarters, in the unmaking.

   Braque, who is the subject of a retrospective exhibition here at the Guggenheim Museum, occupies a unique position among modern artists.
He was a principal participant in two very different early modernist styles, fauvism and cubism.
And although as a fauve he was more of a gifted follower than a major innovator, he literally co-invented cubism with Pablo Picasso.
In fact, specialists still argue about which of the two painted the first true cubist pictures around 1908 and about which one first hit upon the revolutionary technique of collage a few years later.

   Braque's relationship to Picasso was a problematical one.
For a few years after 1909 the two worked together so closely and toward such similar ends that even they themselves were said to be unable to tell their canvases apart.
But after World War I, in which Picasso, a Spanish national, did not serve but in which Braque was severely wounded, their friendship ended.
Picasso, with his characteristic and often cruel egotism, played down Braque's role in their joint ventures. (At one point, in a heady mixture of arrogance and misogyny, he dismissed Braque as "my wife.")
And as Picasso became an increasingly public man and grew to be the most famous artist of the century, the reclusive Braque tended to recede into the shadows.

   This is not to say that Braque was ignored.
Far from it.
Throughout his life he was held in high esteem by artists and critics alike, and when he died he was given the singular honor of a state funeral at the Louvre.
But during the past 25 years his former comrade's reputation has tended to eclipse his own.
His work has not had nearly the exposure that Picasso's has, and some critics have even come to question his greatness, feeling that he merely had the good luck of being able to ride along in Picasso's wake.
The Guggenheim Museum exhibition is the first American museum show since 1949 to deal with Braque's work from beginning to end.

   The show begins on the fourth-floor ramp of this spiraling space and ends on the sixth.
So you work your way up it and then see it again in reverse as you leave.
Whether intended or not, this arrangement is a good one, as it induces you to begin and end with the earlier works -- which to my mind are the most interesting.

   Like many artists of his generation, Braque started out working in a naturalistic style, as can be seen in an early portrait of his grandmother (1900-02) and in a 1905 view of a church square at the French Channel port of Honfleur.
It was not until 1906 that Braque, following Matisse and Derain, began to paint in the bright colors characteristic of fauvism.
This show includes a number of his important and impressive fauve canvases, including one of his rare figure studies from this period, the predominantly red, green and violet "Seated Nude" of 1907.

   The following year, under the influence of Cezanne, Braque began to fracture his forms and emphasize the interaction of objects and background.
With a relatively small number of well-chosen works, the exhibition gives a good idea of the development of Braque's cubism.
One thing that emerges is that until around 1910 Braque, like Picasso, found it difficult to "destroy" the objects in his paintings.
In paintings such as the famous "Harbor at Normandy" of 1909 and "Violin and Palette" of 1909-10 the objects are fragmented and fractured as if made of cut glass, but they remain clearly recognizable.

   After 1910, Braque's palette became more restrained but his probing of the abstract possibilities of painting became more intense.
Although his 1911-12 paintings tend to be somewhat more lyrical than Picasso's, and more gently painted, they are equally austere.
Somewhere in the monochrome labyrinth of lines and planes and choppy brush strokes we recognize that there is a subject, but it is not always easy to make out where the subject is, or where its component parts might be.
Among the most majestic of the cubist paintings in this show is "Rooftops at Ceret" of 1911, in which the angular rooftops and chimneys of the Catalan town are translated into a kind of speculative, metaphysical geometry.

   After World War I, Braque continued to work in a cubist idiom, but it became an increasingly literal and realistic one, despite the intense frontality of the forms and flattening of space.
It is here I think we see the greatest difference between his and Picasso's methods.
Whereas Picasso in his later works seemed to extend the cubist vocabulary by somehow getting inside his forms and twisting and exploding them from within, Braque seems to have applied cubist formulas of fragmentation to an essentially realistic vision.
As a result there is a cool, somewhat intellectual quality in the later works that tends to evoke admiration rather than enthusiasm.
Though there are some very beautiful paintings here from the later years, there is more than a touch of what might be called academic cubism in many of the others.
This may be the result less of Braque than of the limited choice of his works available to the Guggenheim for the show.

   It is not until the very end of the show, in a series of thickly painted landscapes inspired by Van Gogh, that you sense again the electricity present in Braque's cubist works.
It is around this point that you also begin to retrace your steps and have the pleasure of ending up where both you and Braque began, at the time when he was reformulating the pictorial language of 20th-century painting.

   Back on the fourth floor, you will be invited to exit on foot via the exhibition called "Modern Treasures From the National Gallery in Prague."
By all means do so.
For although this is a mixed bag, with more Czechoslovakian painting than you might want to see at one time, there also are a number of masterpieces that would be worth a trip all the way to Prague.
These include Munch's haunting "Dance on the Shore," a magnificent Cezanne portrait, six first-rate Picassos (including the famous 1907 self-portrait), Derain's celebrated proto-cubist "View of Cadaques," a 1921 Braque still-life as good as any in the Braque show, and a roomful of impressive abstract paintings by Frantisek Kupka, the best of the Czech modernists.

   Moreover, virtually all of these paintings seem to be unvarnished, unrelined and unrestored -- that is, almost as fresh as the day they were painted.

   The Braque show was sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts.
Both exhibitions are accompanied by well-produced catalogs with all works illustrated in color, and both will be on view until Sept. 11.

<HEAD>Mystery Woman Getting Facelift After 1,700 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ZIPPORI, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like Mona Lisa, the mystery woman has
dark hair, soft brown eyes with a come-hither look and full red
lips with a faintly amused expression. But after 1,700 years, she
is getting a facelift.
   ``The greatness of this woman is that she speaks to you from
beyond time,'' said Ehud Netzer of Hebrew University, co-director
of a project to move and preserve the woman's portrait in a 4th
century mosaic on the floor of a Roman villa.
   On Thursday, archaeologists began the arduous task of lifting
the 430-square-foot mosaic, rolling it up strip by strip and moving
it 125 miles south to the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.
   The woman's beauty and ambiguous expression have prompted a
comparison a famous Leonardo da Vinci painting, the Mona Lisa,
which hangs in the Louvre Museum in Paris.
   ``It's the eyes. They follow you. There is nothing like her in
contemporary Roman art,'' said Eric M. Meyers, an archaeologist
from Duke University in Durham, N.C., who is directing the project
with his wife, Carol.
   The scholars still don't know whether the woman was a real
person or an artist's concept of ideal beauty. They say she could
be a famous actress from the nearby theater, a woman the artist
loved or a depiction of Aphrodite, the ancient goddess of love.
   ``Maybe she was supposed to be Aphrodite, but maybe she was a
real live person as well,'' said Meyers.
   One clue to the woman's identity may be in the building itself,
which Meyers speculates might have been an inn housing visiting
actors for the 3,000-seat theater next door.
   Brackets on the floor indicate three couches were placed around
the mosaic and that the room was used for dining, maybe even as an
after-theater restaurant.
   The border of the mosaic contains theater masks and the theme of
the panels is connected to the god Dionysis, who was associated
with the theater. So the mystery woman might have been an actress,
an Elizabeth Taylor of her day.
   ``The betting is 2-to-1 that she was a real person,'' said Laura
Zucker, 20, one of about 100 American students and volunteers
helping on the dig.
   The portrait and other panels of the mosaic are done in tiny,
naturally colored stones that Meyers said were laid down over a
watercolor blueprint painted by the artist.
   The state of preservation as well as the subtle artistry are
remarkable. For example, there was still a blush of color on the
cheeks when the portrait was daubed with a wet sponge.
   The task of giving the mosaic a facelift has fallen to Dodo
Shenhav, an Israel Museum expert who compares raising the
18-by-24-foot mosaic to surgery.
   Shenhav, whose past challenges have included removing the Dead
Sea Scrolls from sealed ceramic jars, said the operation will
involve fixing a water soluble glue to the mosaic and covering it
with burlap and additional glue.
   Once the seal is fixed, workers chisel under the stone carpet
and roll it up in a half-dozen strips.
   The pace is expected to be slow, and Shenhav said it could take
two to three weeks.
   Sepphoris, site of the modern-day cooperative farm of Zippori,
was the capital of the Galilee province of Roman Palestine.
   It was a cosmopolitan city, one of the few places where Jews,
pagans and Christians lived in harmony. The mosaic is contemporary
with Rabbi Yehuda Hanassi, who codified the Jewish law of the
Mishna in the city about A.D. 220.
   The city, only four miles from Nazareth, is also sacred to
Christians as the birthplace of the Virgin Mary.
   The city, which had a population of 20,000 in Roman times, was
devastated by an earthquake in 363. The tremors brought down the
villa in which the mosaic was located and the rubble helped
preserve the mosaic.

FT  12 APR 94 / Arts: Close up on Tintoretto - William Packer visits the
Accademia and the Guggenheim in Venice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No one is ever short of things to see in Venice, but then why not pile
Pelion on Ossa, given the chance? Certainly the current programme of special
exhibitions is as strong as ever, quite apart from the remarkable exhibition
of architecture at Fiat's Palazzo Grassi, The Renaissance: from Brunelleschi
to Michelangelo (to be reviewed later).
This, in Venice, is the year of Tintoretto, the 400th anniversary of his
death at the age of 76. The Commune di Venezia is marking the moment with
wide publicity of itself as the City of Tintoretto, drawing attention to the
many works hung in its churches and ancient institutions and, until May 1,
showing a group of the religious paintings in the Church of San Bartolomeo,
near the Rialto. The principle celebration, however, is of Tintoretto the
portrait painter, now on show at the Accademia.
Tintoretto, with Titian, his master, and the somewhat younger Veronese,
completes the commanding trio of great artists that forms and dominates our
view of Venetian painting through the greater part of the 16th century.
Which was the greatest? Titian, who, some would say, in his great old age,
was the first modern painter; Veronese, the virtuoso, pittore sovrano di
Venezia, as the plaque on his house near San Samuele would have it; or
Tintoretto himself, with his driving expressive energy and emotional force?
Who would say?
All three of them were portrait painters on the side - and in the middle as
well, for with the model used even for the idealised figures of any
devotional composition, the donors - sponsors as we would say - required
their own personal, if peripheral commemoration. The family kneeling at the
sacred throne, one head turned perhaps to look us directly in the eye, is
ever poignant and humane.
But the smaller single and private portrait will always bring us closer to
the artist himself in his practical working of the image, just as it allows
us closer to the surface of the canvas. Here is the artist alone and
himself. And what we find here in Tintoretto is a certain crudity and
awkwardness, almost a naivety in the immediate drawing and handling that
never leaves him. The odd thing is that we find these qualities being not so
much overcome as turned to advantage.
Sophistication and an easier naturalism come with experience, but always
there will be the commitment and attack, that saving determination to get
the mark and thus the image down, to make it real and to make it work. It is
moving and inspiring to follow an artist as he moves towards true greatness
by sheer force of character. What a pity it is that the two self-portraits,
in youth and old age, are not hung side by side. The boy is father to the
man.
The short walk beyond San Vio takes us to the late Peggy Guggenheim's
Palazzo Venier and into another world and another age. Her collection of
modern international art, prime Ernst, Miro, Picasso, Giacometti and the
rest, remains the draw it always was, but changes are afoot. It is not that
the emphasis is to shift away from the collection as such, with its strong
personal flavour; nor should it, ever. But with pressure from visitors
continuing to grow, the need for more space, if only to maintain the
peculiar character of the place, is undeniable.
The opportunity has been taken to acquire much of the property behind the
Guggenheim, over the garden wall. The central portion was taken over some
time ago and has already been converted into a shop and temporary gallery,
with a cafe to open this summer. The intention is thus to concentrate
offices and services, with the old Palazzo returned as much as possible to
its old self.
Along with this comes the opportunity to make rather more of temporary
exhibitions. Two such are now on show. Italian Artists' Books in the 20th
Century, already shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, is a rich
documentary display that makes the useful point that artists everywhere, and
not just in Italy, continue to be intrigued by the relation of image to
text, and the creative collaboration between artist and writer. Artists
represented range from de Chirico to Clemente.
Josef Albers: glass, colour and light is a small but substantial
retrospective study. Drawn principally from the holdings of the Josef Albers
Foundation in Connecticut, it lays a fresh and proper emphasis on Albers'
early development in his years at the Bauhaus in the 1920s and '30s, first
at Weimar and then at Dessau. Albers died in 1976 at the age of 88. He moved
to America in 1933, where he spent the rest of his life, engaged after 1950
in endless colour variations upon his 'Homage to the Square', three simple
squares inset in a uniform format. With his post-war reputation resting on
this American minimalism, it is useful to be reminded of the European
constructivist tradition from which he came, with Klee, Schwitters and
Mondrian the most obvious and notable influences.
Jacopo Tintoretto: Portraits; Gallerie dell'Accademia until July 10, then on
to Vienna. Sponsors: Hyundai Automobili Italia and Ramazzotti. Josef Albers:
Glass, Colour &amp; Light; Peggy Guggenheim Collection, until July 10. Italian
Artists' Books in the 20th Century; Peggy Guggenheim Collection, until May
22.

FT  26 NOV 93 / Arts: Drawn to the Old Masters / Review of the Chatsworth
and Getty collections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the Duke of Devonshire were to offer me one wish, the response would be
unhesitating. 'Give me Annibale Carracci's drawing of 'The Hunchback Boy'.
Out of so many lovely things in the exhibition Old Master Drawings From
Chatsworth at the British Museum, the poignancy of that drawing tugs at the
heart.
Made in Bologna circa 1610, the younger Carracci's study is an example of
the power drawings which witness particular moments in an artist's studio.
The lad sat without his shirt. With short, sparing strokes of red chalk
Annibale drew the deformed torso, the scrofulous skull showing through the
thin hair. Yet it is the combination of the draughtsman's scientific
detachment with humanity which is so wonderful. The boy turns towards us
shadowed eyes which are eloquent of misery. The enigmatic words added by
Annibale, 'I do not know if God helps me', are surely his response to
suffering.
One visit to the Print Gallery may well seem inadequate for an exhibition of
this size and quality, with 220 drawings by artists such as Ghirlandaio,
Leonardo, Raphael, Rosso Fiorentino, Pontormo, Durer, Van Dyck, Rembrandt
and Corot. So make several.
This collection is the finest of its kind in private hands, apart from the
royal collection at Windsor. Kept at Chatsworth House in Derbyshire, most of
it was bought between 1690 and 1729 by the 2nd Duke. Its notoriety has come
from sales in recent years, although the collection still has some 2,000
works. The BM selection is the largest showing of Chatsworth drawings. There
is a fully illustrated catalogue, based on the complete catalogue by Michael
Jaffe now under way; volume one should be out next spring from Phaidon
Press.
Leonardo's 'Leda and the Swan' shows not the mating but the morning after.
The swan peacably nibbles his lady's ear. Squirming unpleasantly on the
ground, Leda's children hatch out of eggs: Castor, Pollux, Helen and
Clytemnestra. A sheet of small grotesque heads by Leonardo makes a happy
pair with Durer's caricature of a rubber-faced old man.
The Raphael drawings are marvellous: three studies for the 'The
Transfiguration' and a ravishing sketch of a mother reading to a child. A
sheet of chilling studies in red chalk by Andrea del Sarto reminds us that
in Renaissance Italy, artists were enlisted to make the link between crime
and punishment. After the siege of Florence in 1530, he was commissioned to
paint six executed traitors on a wall in the marketplace. These sketches
shows the contorted body of a villain suspended by his foot.
A gem of a sketch is Rembrandt's 'Actor in his Dressing-Room'. It passes
understanding that 30 years ago this could have been exhibited as St
Augustine in his study. Here to the life is a flabby old actor, his
jug-shaped body wrapped in a fur mantel, scanning his lines before he goes
on stage. Rarities are the only drawing which survives from Bruegel's stay
in Rome and Altdorfer's only design for a stained glass window: a
magnificent drawing by Veronese commemorates the forging in 1571 of the Holy
League against Suleiman the Magnificent.
For sheer inventive brilliance, nothing in the show surpasses Guercino's
'Rest on the Flight', exhibited for the first time. Guercino has used ink
wash so cleverly that the areas of white paper give the impression of
blinding sunshine. A crenellated wall runs slap across the picture. Joseph
leans on it, facing us, gazing pensively at a view we cannot see. Mary, a
vigorous young woman, distracts the attention of her baby who is perched,
rather carelessly, on the wall.
Anyone with an weakness for horses will appreciate a fine, quizzical beast
by the young Van Dyck, a study for his 'St Martin Dividing His Cloak'.
Rather harder to explain at first is the horse in Petro da Cortona's
grandiose 'Pope Urban VIII Being Carried Down the Nave of St Peter's'.
Surely they did not allow horses into St Peter's? In fact, it seems they
did, once a year when the king of Naples presented the pope with a chinea,
hacanea in Spanish, from where we derive 'hackney'.
The Royal Academy's Drawings from the J. Paul Getty Museum is the junior
exhibition but is still well worth seeing, put together in the last 10 years
and including 14 ex-Chatsworth works. With 100 drawings from the 15th to
20th centuries, it is a question of breadth rather than depth.
Cuyp's smooth drawing of a milkmaid, framed by the cow's belly, is a
particular delight. So is an unforgettable portrait by Rubens of a Korean
gentleman swathed in silk as light as air. Spare a moment, too, for a puzzle
picture, 'Two Male Nudes' by the late-16th century Haarlem Mannerist,
Cornelis van Cornelisz. If you can decipher what precisely, apart from the
prelude to sodomy, he intended to convey, you will have gone one better than
the Getty.
