AMERICAN
</P>
<P>
* Cafe Zinc, 350 Ocean Ave., Laguna Beach. (714) 494-6302. Open Mondays from 7
a.m. to 11 a.m.; Tuesdays through Sundays from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. $$
</P>
<P>
A Berkeley-style cafe in Laguna, Cafe Zinc has remarkable, densely foamed
cappuccino; fresh, imaginative muffins like millet or cranberry; and an outdoor
patio.
</P>
<P>
* Heritage Brewing Company, 24921 Dana Point Harbor Drive, Dana Point. (714)
240-2060. Open Sundays through Thursdays from 11:30 a.m. to midnight; Fridays
and Saturdays to 2 a.m. $
</P>
<P>
This brewpub is a rowdy place with dart boards, foosball and a young,
party-crazed crowd. If the beer had any flavor at all, one could even call the
place lively. Four brews are offered -- pale ale, golden ale, Irish red and
Dana porter -- along with a variety of salads, finger foods and sandwiches, the
best of which is "beef on wick," wafer-thin roast beef on a salted bun. The
burgers aren't bad.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CAJUN
</P>
<P>
* Bayou St. John, 320 Main St., Seal Beach. (213) 431-2298. Open daily from 5
to 10 p.m. $$
</P>
<P>
Bayou St. John in quiet Seal Beach is Orange County's only bona fide Cajun
restaurant. The boom has faded, but not the delights of this cuisine. Indulge
yourself with such specialties as homemade gumbo, full of hidden flavors;
oysters Rousseau, a rich appetizer with cheese, bacon, cream sauce and spicy
tomato; and stuffed trout, pan-fried in pure butter. Blackened items are a
must. Seafoods are flown in from the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CHINESE
</P>
<P>
* China Palms, Fullerton Metro Center, 104 W. Orangethorpe Ave., Fullerton.
(714) 526-2196. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays
to 10 p.m. $$
</P>
<P>
Joe Ling put a palm tree in the middle of his restaurant, an airy, ultra-modern
dining room in Fullerton's spanking new Metro Center. But there is nothing
tropical about the solid pan-Chinese food he serves, made in one of the most
accomplished Chinese kitchens around. Cold dishes, dumplings and first-rate
soups make perfect beginnings. Honey-glazed bananas, plunged steaming into an
ice-filled bowl tableside, make perfect endings. The goodies you can have in
between are too numerous to mention.
</P>
<P>
* Dynasty, 9200 Bolsa Ave., No. 215, Westminster. (714) 898-3189. Open Mondays
through Fridays from 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.; weekends from 9 a.m. $$
</P>
<P>
A vast Hong Kong-style restaurant in a Little Saigon shopping mall, Dynasty is
beginning to strut its stuff. The dining room is now in the hands of the
capable Tony Lai, a Chinese foodie with Beverly Hills in his resume, and both
food and service have taken a sharp upturn. Black-pepper beef brisket from the
Page 1 specials menu is extraordinary, and don't miss the first-rate kung pao
dishes, sand dabs with spicy salt, or soy-sauce squab. On a menu with 150
entrees, there is much to choose from.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CONTINENTAL
</P>
<P>
* The Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton, 33533 Ritz-Carlton Drive, Dana Point.
(714) 240-5008. Open nightly for dinner from 6 to 10 p.m. $$$$
</P>
<P>
A meal at the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton is always a memorable experience,
but in some instances the memories tend to be a bit flawed. Amid the beautiful
surroundings, elegant service and well-heeled clientele, chef Fabrice Canelle
has introduced a creative, eccentric and imperfect cuisine, a blend of French,
Californian and international influences. The menu is small, and dishes have a
tendency toward the sweet. Salads, Sonoma duck liver, lamb and outstanding
desserts are the hallmarks.
</P>
<P>
* The Golden Truffle, 1767 Newport Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 645-9858. Open
Tuesdays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; Tuesdays through
Thursdays from 6 to 9:30 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10 p.m. $$$
</P>
<P>
The Golden Truffle is an eccentric restaurant with an eclectic menu that defies
rhythm or logic. Chef Alan Greeley is whimsical; he cooks for the sheer
pleasure of it, and it mostly tastes terrific. Bay shrimp cocktail Yucatan is
like a combination gazpacho-ceviche, with tiny shrimp and chunky pieces of
avocado immobilized in a thick, tangy puree of tomato and chili. Broiled
marinated skirt steak with pinto beans and cactus is a triumph. Nothing else on
the menu will prepare you for it. There is a wide selection of premium wines
and bistro-like desserts. The ambiance is relaxed and casual.
</P>
<P>
* Hastings, in the Anaheim Hilton and Towers, 777 Convention Way, Anaheim.
(714) 750-4321. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays
through Saturdays from 6 to 10:30 p.m. $$$
</P>
<P>
Hastings has good food for a hotel restaurant, but other aspects of dining
there can be annoying; service is particularly spotty and indifferent. The room
is predictably clubby with the predictable hotel creature comforts. The menu
features a sumptuous lobster ravioli appetizer, a fine seafood Caesar salad and
some highly credible entrees, among them filet mignon that melts in the mouth
and a great veal. Seafoods are done handsomely. The wine list is extensive and
intelligent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CUBAN
</P>
<P>
* Felix Continental Cafe, 36 Plaza Square, Orange. (714) 633-5842. Open seven
days a week from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. $$
</P>
<P>
You can smell the garlic for blocks around this European-looking, Cuban-style
cafe in the old downtown of Orange. The menu abounds with exotica. Papa rellena
(a potato and egg croquette rolled in bread crumbs) is the best appetizer.
Roast chicken Cubano (a crispy half-chicken with bitter orange peel added for
extra dimension) is definitely the best entree. Save room for dessert -- it is
the best course here. Pineapple-raisin bread pudding, a soft, buttery
suspension of rum, eggs, flour and fruit, is good enough to make Betty Crocker
blush.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ENGLISH
</P>
<P>
* The Cat and Custard Cup, 800 E. Whittier Blvd., La Habra. (213) 694-3812 or
(714) 996-6496. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.;
Mondays from 5:30 to 9 p.m.; Tuesdays through Fridays to 10 p.m.; Saturdays to
10:30 p.m.; and Sundays from 5 to 9 p.m. $$
</P>
<P>
The Cat and Custard Cup is a lovingly reconstructed English pub with a campy
Continental menu and dark, medieval trappings. It is charming, cheerful and
worth a wide detour.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FRENCH
</P>
<P>
* The Pleasant Peasant, 4251 Martingale Way, Newport Beach. (714) 955-2755.
Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through
Thursdays from 5:30 to 9 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 10 p.m. $$
</P>
<P>
* La Brasserie, 202 S. Main St., Orange. (714) 978-6161. Open Mondays through
Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m.; Mondays through Saturdays from 5 to 10 p.m.
$$$
</P>
<P>
Country French cuisine has a huge audience, but many of the restaurants
advertising it end up serving much fancier dishes instead. (They can charge
more that way.) The Pleasant Peasant is reasonably priced, with both soup and
salad included in the prices of main courses. Stick to lamb and anything
without sauce here. La Brasserie is a lot pricier but also considerably more
accomplished. The coq au vin rouge is terrific, as is a wonderful homemade
chicken-liver mousse in aspic. Good desserts and plenty of romance here too.
</P>
<P>
* La Vie en Rose, 240 S. State College Blvd., Brea. (714) 529-8333. Open
Mondays through Saturdays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 6 to 10 p.m.
$$$
</P>
<P>
La Vie en Rose is supposed to be fashioned after a Normandy farmhouse, but the
building is a masterpiece in kitsch; it looks like a swap-meet replica of the
Mont-St-Michel abbey. Luckily, the food is good. Spinach salad sizzles with
natural flavor. Salad perigourdine (a simple dish of mixed greens with slices
of preserved duck and a heady garlic dressing) makes a terrific lunch. Fish is
prepared with delicacy. The veal chop is wonderful. Service is flawless and
attentive. The only major drawback is the noise level, which befits, well, a
swap meet. Moderately expensive.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
GREEK
</P>
<P>
* Greek Cuisine, 13011 Newport Ave., Tustin. (714) 731-1179. Open Mondays
through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.; daily from 5 to 10 p.m. $$
</P>
<P>
* Flamingo, 17185 Brookhurst St., Fountain Valley. (714) 964-0016. Open
Tuesdays through Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays to 11
p.m. $20
</P>
<P>
Ethnic eateries in mini-malls: Greek Cuisine in Tustin boasts exquisite taramo,
creamed carp roe, fall-off-the-bone oregano chicken and a fine array of Greek
specialties, while Flamingo in Fountain Valley is more terra incognita: seco
norteno (piquant lamb stew in onion gravy), papas a la Huancaina (potatoes in a
cheese-sauce blanket), picarone (hot pumpkin fritters in blackstrap molasses).
Both restaurants are casual and inexpensive.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INDIAN
</P>
<P>
* The Clay Oven, 15435 Jeffrey Road, Irvine. (714) 552-2851. Open Tuesdays
through Sundays from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. and from 5:30 to 10:30 p.m. $$$
</P>
<P>
The Clay Oven is an Indian restaurant inauspiciously located in a country
shopping mall and specializing in dishes from the tandoor, the authentic oven
advertised by the restaurant's name. Fish tikka, here made with chunks of
broiled swordfish, is downright heavenly, and tandoori chicken, rubbed red with
a spice mixture and broiled until sizzling, is another winner. There is an
interesting selection of vegetable dishes as well. Wash everything down with
giant bottles of imported Indian beer and lament the fact that most of the
really exotic specialties you see displayed on the menu won't be available.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INDONESIAN
</P>
<P>
* Dewi, 1762 N. Tustin Ave., Orange. (714) 637-1101. Open Tuesdays through
Saturdays from 11 a.m to 8 p.m. $
</P>
<P>
Hurry over -- while there is still time -- to Dewi, a small Indonesian
restaurant/grocery store hidden among commercial properties along a busy avenue
in Orange. Nasi rames is a mixed rice plate with a whole cookbook full of
Indonesian goodies, and the restaurant has fabulous barbecued chicken and hot
stewed-beef dishes. Owner Edith Vredevoogd is constantly preparing little
snacks such as lemper (a sticky rice roll filled with minced chicken) or cendol
(mysterious green bits taken with crushed ice, syrup and jackfruit). Don't
despair if you miss the restaurant, though. There is a second Dewi run by Mrs.
V's brother in Huntington Beach. Exotica at its best.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ITALIAN
</P>
<P>
* Agostino's, 34700 Coast Highway, Capistrano Beach. (714) 661-8266. Open
Tuesdays through Sundays from 5 to 10 p.m. $$
</P>
<P>
This Chicago-style Italian restaurant is famous for its homemade sausage and
romantic beach view. Much of the menu, including the rich, creamy pastas, is
the same as it was when the place was called Sabatino's. But Agostino has added
many seafood dishes, including mussels, fresh salmon and calamari. The bar is
as good a hangout as you'll find in Capo Beach.
</P>
<P>
* Capriccio Italiano Ristorante, Village Mall, 25380 Marguerite Parkway,
Mission Viejo. (714) 855-6866. Open Mondays through Fridays from 11:30 a.m. to
2:30 p.m. and from 4 to 9:30 p.m.; weekends from 4 to 10 p.m. $$
</P>
<P>
Capriccio may mean "whim" in Italian, but there is nothing whimsical about the
food in this restaurant; it is polished and sophisticated. For my money, it is
a real find. The kitchen is run by two brothers from Palermo, Sal and Franco
Maniaci, but there is barely a trace of Sicilian influence in the dishes they
serve. Appetizers like vitello tonnato and lumache del bosco are marvelous, and
pastas are fresh and homemade. Many main dishes have French overtones, like a
stylish lamb rack with truffles and foie gras, or a civet of hare called lepre
salmi. Cappriccio's location is modest, and so are prices, but its class is
obvious.
</P>
<P>
* Prego, 18420 Von Karman Ave., Irvine. (714) 553-1333. Open Mondays from 11:30
a.m. to 10:30 p.m.; Tuesdays through Thursdays to 11 p.m.; Fridays to midnight;
Saturdays from 5 p.m. to midnight; Sundays from 5 to 10:30 p.m. $$$
</P>
<P>
Prego, 4 years old, remains one of the area's most impressive Italian
restaurants. The exterior is that of a Tuscan villa; inside, it's elegant and
neoclassical. The kitchen serves mostly northern Italian fare that is all the
rage now: homemade pastas, rotisserie meats, sumptuous desserts. It's best to
stick to basics here -- wood-fired pizzas, terrific roast duck and lamb.
Service ranges from gracious to arrogant, but there are plenty of excellent
Italian wines to toss around.
</P>
<P>
* Tuttomare, 545 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 640-6333. Open
Mondays through Thursdays from 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m.; Fridays and Saturdays
from 11:30 a.m. to midnight. $$$
</P>
<P>
Service is fluid and solicitous at this smart, stunning restaurant, located in
the building that used to house the Savannah Grill, but the kitchen is having
its ups and downs. Wonderful, yeasty foccaccia bread served with virgin olive
oil and the fine grilled seafoods are some of the ups. Naked vegetables and
bland pasta dishes are some of the downs. Lombata di vitello (veal chop with
fontina and prosciutto) is one reason to go back for a second look.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
JAPANESE
</P>
<P>
* The Food Court at Yaohan Market, 665 Paularino Ave., Costa Mesa. (714)
557-6699. Most concessions open daily from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. $$
</P>
<P>
If you are looking for a crash course in contempo Japanese, look no further
than Yaohan Market in Costa Mesa and its colorful Food Court. Several
concessions are in full swing here, serving a variety of Japanese lunch and
snack foods, including bento (Japanese lunch box), ramen and curry rice;
there's even a bona fide sushi bar. You also will find a bakery that serves
Japanese versions of such Western dishes as clam chowder and spaghetti -- and
many curious, puzzled customers. Good, cheap fun.
</P>
<P>
* Kitayama, 101 Bayview Place, Newport Beach. (714) 725-0777. Open Mondays
through Fridays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and from 6 to 10:30 p.m.; Saturdays from
5 to 11 p.m. $$
</P>
<P>
Kitayama, the first really serious Japanese restaurant in Orange County, is an
exquisite addition to the local dining scene. You'll think you've wandered into
a Buddhist temple -- until you taste the delicate, sophisticated cooking of
Yoshio Shirai and his team of chefs. The sho-ka-do lunch is the most beautiful
$14 meal anywhere, and the omakase kaiseki, a multicourse feast at $50 per
person, is unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
MEXICAN
</P>
<P>
* Caliente, 1910 Main St., Irvine. (714) 975-1220. Open seven days a week, 11
a.m. to midnight. $$
</P>
<P>
Caliente is Spanish for hot, and that is exactly what this stylish new
restaurant is. It's the latest jewel in the El Torito crown, and its modest
adobe exterior conceals a stunning design -- a faint red '80s-chic motif
complete with dramatic lighting, an open kitchen and a comal (a high-tech
version of a stone tortilla cooker). The restaurant smokes its own meats, and
you can wash them down with premium margaritas made from vintage tequila.
Desserts, such as burnt cream and apple crisp, are wonderful.

<P>
Betting parlors operated by Caliente Race Track in Tijuana will soon begin
accepting wagers on U.S. professional and collegiate sports, it was reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Caliente, which operates sports books in four cities and plans to expand, was
recently granted permission by Mexican government officials to conduct sports
wagering, according to a report published today in the San Diego Union.
</P>
<P>
Mexican officials said the betting, illegal throughout the United States except
in Nevada, will begin in Tijuana as soon as computerized equipment needed to
monitor the wagering is installed.
</P>
<P>
"We're just waiting for them to tell us their start-up date," said Rafael
Martinez, an official with the Ministry of Interior, in a telephone interview
Thursday from Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed source described as a leading member of the Las Vegas gaming
industry said Caliente officials have contacted an odds maker concerning the
establishment of betting lines to be used for U.S. events, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Tijuana is 15 miles south of downtown San Diego and about 130 miles south of
Los Angeles, two areas that provide Las Vegas with much of its betting
clientele.
</P>
<P>
The source, who spoke on the condition he not be identified, said Caliente
officials have indicated that sports betting in Mexico will be limited to Baja
California and Baja California Sur, the two states composing the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Caliente operates race books in Tijuana, Rosarito Beach, Tecate and Mexicali
that handle bets on horse and dog racing. Expansion plans call for new betting
parlors in La Paz, Loreto and Cabo San Lucas.
</P>
<P>
Mexico claims a 1% tax on existing race wagering and will presumably deduct the
same tax on sports betting.
</P>
<P>
Caliente officials, possibly worried that early publicity and recent shifts in
local political power might kill the new betting plans, declined to confirm the
report.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have anything to really, solidly say," said Caliente General Manager
Arturo Alemany. "For 40 years, this has been a rumor. . . . I just want to tell
you that anything that gets out on this could hurt us more than it would help
us."
</P>
<P>
An estimated 12.5 million people live within 130 miles of Tijuana, about 2.5
million in San Diego County, at least 8.5 million in the rest of Southern
California and 1.5 million in Tijuana itself.
</P>
<P>
In Las Vegas, where the population is fewer than 1 million, during the fiscal
year ending June, 1988, $962.7 million was wagered in Clark County's 41 sports
books, according to Charles Anderson, a financial analyst for the Nevada Gaming
Commission.
</P>
<P>
From the $962.7 million, Anderson said the "hold," or what the betting parlors
had left after paying off winning wagers, was $25.4 million, amounting to about
2.6%.

<P>
CRIME: THE EX-SECURITY CHIEF AT CALIENTE RACETRACK, CAPTURED IN L.A., IS BACK
IN MEXICO TO FACE CHARGES IN THE SLAYING OF THE COLUMNIST KNOWN AS EL GATO.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A central suspect in the sensational slaying two years ago of Hector Felix
Miranda, a prominent Tijuana journalist widely known as El Gato, or the Cat,
was in the custody of Mexican authorities Wednesday after his arrest by Los
Angeles authorities this week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Vera Palestina, former chief of security at Tijuana's Caliente
Racetrack, was taken into custody Tuesday afternoon as he arrived near the
Greyhound bus terminal in downtown Los Angeles, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police and U.S. immigration officers arrested the longtime fugitive
after receiving a tip from Baja California authorities, who have been
investigating the journalist's April, 1988, slaying. Vera went to the station
to meet a friend, according to a statement by the Los Angeles Police
Department, which set up surveillance at the site.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Vera, a former police officer in Mexico City, was in the United
States illegally and was consequently turned over to U.S. immigration
authorities. On Tuesday evening, he was returned to the U.S.-Mexico border,
where he was turned over to state police agents and jailed in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
The arrest culminates two years of doubt and intrigue surrounding the slaying,
which became a heated political issue in Baja California, testing the Mexican
government's stated commitment to a free press.
</P>
<P>
Felix was one of two dozen journalists killed in the six-year term of former
Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid. Most of the slayings remain unsolved,
according to Mexican journalism groups.
</P>
<P>
Felix, 47, was killed on April 20, 1988, as he drove to work down a
rain-slicked street in Tijuana. A vehicle blocked his path, and an assassin
pumped two rounds from a 12-gauge shotgun through the driver's window of his
car.
</P>
<P>
The assailants had observed his path to and from work and waited for him at the
assassination spot, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
Felix's killing sparked anti-government protests and large-scale mourning in
Tijuana, his adopted city.
</P>
<P>
The perception that authorities were covering up Felix's slaying was widely
credited with contributing to the decisive electoral victory last year of
opposition Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel, the first-ever opposition governor in
modern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"This is only a first step, but it is a very important one," said J. Jesus
Blancornelas, Felix's longtime colleague and co-worker, after news of Vera's
arrest. "From here comes the most difficult part," he added, referring to the
upcoming court proceedings against Vera.
</P>
<P>
Although grateful for Vera's arrest, Blancornelas said during a Wednesday night
press conference that he believes the masterminds of the killing are still at
large. He voiced the hope that Vera's arrest will finally resolve the mystery
surrounding his colleague's death.
</P>
<P>
Blancornelas and Felix founded the muckraking weekly Zeta, in which Felix's
pointed barbs appeared in a must-read column called Un Poco de Algo (A Little
of Something). Felix, using a telltale combination of puns, double meanings,
crude words and other verbal stunts, regularly took shots at a wide range of
public officials in Baja. His titillating, gossipy missives were savored by the
powerful and powerless alike.
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, Blancornelas, probably the most prominent journalist in
Tijuana, has repeatedly used his publication to demand a thorough investigation
into his colleague's killing. He has reprinted old columns by Felix and
featured full-page, black-bordered advertisements asking three successive Baja
California governors what they planned to do with the case.
</P>
<P>
The weekly Zeta, under Blancornelas' direction, has pointed its finger directly
at Jorge Hank Rhon, the president of the Caliente Racetrack, who employed Vera.
</P>
<P>
Vera was also the longtime personal bodyguard for Hank, who is the scion of a
wealthy and influential Mexico City family. Hank, the race track owner, was an
acquaintance of the slain journalist but toward the end of the journalist's
life, Hank emerged as a frequent target in Felix's column.
</P>
<P>
Hank has repeatedly denied any involvement in the case. His father, Jorge Hank
Gonzalez, former mayor of Mexico City and now Mexico's minister of agriculture
and water resources, a cabinet-level post, has also publicly denied that his
son played any role in the slaying, or that any cover-up was perpetuated to
protect his son.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Baja California Gov. Ruffo held a press conference in the state
capital of Mexicali to announce the arrest. During the campaign, Ruffo,
standard-bearer of Mexico's opposition National Action Party, had vowed to
pursue the case and clear up the unsolved slaying, a promise that he repeated
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The investigation will be pursued to its ultimate consequences, no matter who
is involved," a statement from the governor's office said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Vera, who authorities said was living in El Monte, east of Los Angeles, was
arrested without incident. He had been sought since the killing, and sightings
of Vera had been reported everywhere from San Diego to Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
Vera appeared before Baja California State Judge Miguel Angel Barud on
Wednesday and, at a preliminary hearing, denied the charges against him. The
judge has 72 hours to determine whether there is sufficient proof to retain
Vera in custody, something that is considered a virtual certainty considering
the wealth of evidence garnered during the two years since an arrest order was
issued for Vera.
</P>
<P>
Vera could face up to 30 years in jail on the murder charge. The suspect,
sporting a beard, was led into the courtroom in handcuffs, under tight
security.
</P>
<P>
Victoriano Medina Moreno, a former security guard at the race track, was
convicted last August of being the triggerman in the slaying. He is serving a
27-year prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
However, Blancornelas, the slain columnist's longtime colleague, has argued in
print that Vera was the actual triggerman and that Medina only drove the
getaway vehicle. Blancornelas and other journalists have said that Medina,
although sharing responsibility, was being offered up as a scapegoat for the
entire murder scheme -- an allegation denied by Baja authorities. Medina
himself contended that he was tortured into making a confession.
</P>
<P>
Mexican authorities never presented an adequate explanation as to why they
believe Vera and Medina killed Felix. Officials said one of his columns cost
Medina his former job, but Felix's former colleagues said neither Medina's or
Vera's names ever appeared in any of Felix's columns.

BAJA CALIFORNIA COLUMNIST'S KILLER GETS 27 YEARS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Baja California state judge has imposed a near-maximum 27-year prison
sentence on a former race-track security guard and one-time state police agent
after convicting him of being the triggerman in the slaying of a prominent
Tijuana journalist.
</P>
<P>
Judge Braulio Gomez Veronica found on Wednesday that Victoriano Medina Moreno,
38, is guilty in the slaying of Hector Felix Miranda, a columnist who was
widely known for more than a decade in Baja California under the nom de plume
of El Gato -- the Cat.
</P>
<P>
However, the long-expected ruling failed to curb the controversy and doubts
surrounding a case that precipitated large protests against the state
government and still inflames passions in Baja California. Many have maintained
that a massive cover-up is under way and Medina, while an accomplice in the
slaying, is a fall guy for higher, politically connected interests. Two
suspects remain at large.
</P>
<P>
Medina has given conflicting versions of his involvement in the crime, first
signing a confession and subsequently maintaining that he was innocent and that
police had tortured him into confessing.
</P>
<P>
Felix, whose gossipy, often-strident and frequently outrageous column -- Un
Poco de Algo (A Little of Something) -- lampooned the movers and shakers of the
border state and Mexico, was gunned down as he drove to work April 20, 1988. A
gunman pumped two shotgun rounds through the driver's window of the late-model
sedan as it was stopped or rolled slowly on a rain-slicked street. Felix was
killed instantly.
</P>
<P>
Although there is widespread agreement that Medina was probably an accomplice
in the slaying, many Mexican journalists, led by Felix's colleagues at the
muckraking weekly Zeta, have maintained that Medina was probably no more than a
driver at the scene. Indeed, Gomez noted in his sentencing document that the
case will remain open until the apprehension of Antonio Vera Palestina, former
security chief at the Caliente Racetrack in Tijuana, who was Medina's ex-boss.
Many believe that Vera was the actual triggerman.
</P>
<P>
Vera, a former police official in Mexico City, is a fugitive. An arrest warrant
has also been issued for a third former security official at the race track,
Emigdio Nevarez, who also remains at large.
</P>
<P>
J. Jesus Blancornelas, Felix's longtime partner and co-founder with him of
Zeta, said he is convinced that the "intellectual author" of the crime has
never been formally charged. Blancornelas has repeatedly pointed the finger, in
print, at Jorge Hank Rhon, the president of Caliente, who is one of the richest
men in Baja. His father, Carlos Hank Gonzalez, is a former mayor of Mexico City
and is counted among the Mexican power elite. The race track president, a
frequent target of Felix's barbed pen, employed all three named suspects.
</P>
<P>
Both the race track official and the elder Hank, who now is the national
minister of tourism, a cabinet-level post, have denied any involvement in the
slaying or in any cover-up.

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS GUY'S RAIDER-BEAR STORY TURNS OUT TO BE A REAL RIOT
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED BROCK
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hey, dude, like, you got a problem with Steve Schoenfeld? Maybe he did get a
little fanciful with the lead of his Raider-Chicago Bear game story in Monday's
Arizona Republic. So what, dude?
</P>
<P>
Schoenfeld wrote: "A mugging took place before kickoff. The fan was carried
off. No bother. This is Los Angeles Raider football. It just added to the
pregame festivities."
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. What mugging before kickoff?
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Name the pitcher with a losing record who will appear on next
year's Hall of Fame ballot for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Road kill: The bumper stickers seen while cruising around Mississippi might
have been more humorous before Alabama defeated Vanderbilt Saturday -- but not
much more.
</P>
<P>
The top line reads: "Honk if you've coached football at Alabama."
</P>
<P>
Below are the names "(Ray) Perkins, (Bill) Curry and (Gene) Stallings" with
lines drawn through them, followed by "??????"
</P>
<P>
Sure lock: An employee in the odds-setting department at Caliente race track in
Tijuana is paying special attention to the American League East race. And if
the Boston Red Sox win the division title, he'll be a nervous wreck.
</P>
<P>
During spring training, when the track inaugurated future book wagering on the
pennant races and the World Series, the unnamed employee mistakenly set the
computer at 300-1 on the Red Sox to win the American League championship,
instead of the correct odds, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Said Jorge Hank, Caliente's owner and general manager: "Seven fans immediately
saw the tremendous overlay and got down for a total of about $1,000 before the
mistake was caught and corrected."
</P>
<P>
Add Caliente: Hank said that one player bet $700 on Boston and added that "even
though we do have a rule that allows us not to honor tickets issued due to
obvious human or computer error -- just as all the sports books in Nevada have
the same clause -- we will nevertheless keep faith with our customers and honor
their tickets, should the Red Sox win the pennant."
</P>
<P>
Last add Caliente: And if the Red Sox do make the playoffs against Oakland,
what about the employee who goofed?
</P>
<P>
Said Hank: "You can trust me when I tell you that (the Athletics') most
fanatical fan, at least during the championship series, is right here in
Tijuana."
</P>
<P>
These two again?: On this day in 1920, the Cincinnati Reds and the Pittsburgh
Pirates played the 20th Century's only major league tripleheader. The Reds won
the first two games, and the Pirates won the third, which was called after six
innings because of darkness.
</P>
<P>
That's better: Robert G. Brown, 49, finished the 10-kilometer Great Race in
Pittsburgh Sunday in 1 hour 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Said Brown: "I definitely wanted to run this year."
</P>
<P>
Midway through last year's Great Race, Brown went into cardiac arrest. In
January, he had quadruple bypass surgery to open clogged arteries. After two
months of rehabilitation, he resumed running and gradually increased his
distance.
</P>
<P>
Said Brown: "I wanted to show people with heart trouble you can do all of the
things you did before."
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Rollie Fingers, with a record of 114-118 and a major
league-record 341 saves.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: FATTBURGER HAS SEVERAL TASTY DEALS ON
THE GRILL
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fattburger has become one of San Diego's sizzling success stories.
</P>
<P>
Overcoming the near-breakup of the band in the mid-'80s because of internal
conflict, the remaining members could be on the verge of their best-selling
album yet.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, "Good News," their first project for the Intima label, went to
No. 4 on Billboard's contemporary jazz chart, eventually selling 45,000 copies.
Last year's "Living in Paradise" made it to No. 6, and has sold more than
50,000. By all indications, the new "Time Will Tell" could top them both.
</P>
<P>
"It's really taken off," said drummer Tommy Aros. The band expects the album to
enter Billboard's chart next week, and Intima has told band members that radio
stations are adding it to play lists at an impressive rate. This week, it made
impressive showings on two charts published in Radio &amp; Records magazine.
The album moved from 17 to 13 on the new adult contemporary chart, and debuted
at 21 on the contemporary jazz list, with favorable showings on other industry
lists as well.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the band completed its first video, a remake of the Chi-Lites
song "Oh, Girl," which features a guest sax appearance by Gerald Albright. It
also features local sax man Mark Lessman faking Albright's solo, since Albright
was unavailable. BET, the Black Entertainment Channel (Cox Cable Channel 4),
has said it is interested in it, and Fattburger hopes it has a good shot at
VH-1.
</P>
<P>
During the next few days, the band will play in Manhattan, New Jersey and Miami
before returing to San Diego for a Nov. 29 appearance at the Catamaran's "Jazz
Trax Nite."
</P>
<P>
In light of the new album's promise, and the strength of the two earlier
releases, Intima has signed Fattburger to a four-record deal. If "Time Will
Tell" performs as expected, selling more than 100,000, the band's advance
payment for a fourth album could climb into six figures.
</P>
<P>
From 1986 until a few months ago, Bruce Cameron, the talented San Diego horn
player (fluegelhorn, trumpet, cornet) virtually disappeared from the local
scene. But, since last summer, the new band Algo Caliente, which includes
Cameron, has built a local following.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, Cameron was one of San Diego's most promising players. He signed
with the Discovery label and made two albums. A promising producer convinced
him to break the contract, but the new relationship didn't last, and Cameron
was left without a label.
</P>
<P>
He and local sax man Hollis Gentry brought together the players who continue
today as Fattburger in the early '80s. But internal friction and a direction
too much in the Lites Out jazz format put out the lights for Cameron, who left
shortly after the band played at the first game of the 1984 World Series in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
He formed a number of promising bands over the years, but nothing seemed to
gel. In the meantime, Cameron developed a second career custom-painting model
trains.
</P>
<P>
Then, last summer, he and several other local musicians, experienced players in
their 40s and 50s, came together at the behest of conga player Armando Rosas,
who wanted a band he could work with at the Cultural Center in Tijuana, where
he was booking shows.
</P>
<P>
At their debut concert, even the headliners, another impromptu group, including
local sax man Charles McPherson, Chet Baker, pianist Frank Strazzeri and L.A.
session drummer John Guerin, thought the locals were hot. So they decided to
stick together as Algo Caliente.
</P>
<P>
Although the band plays an occasional fusion tune, the emphasis is on
percussion-based Latin sounds, including spicy new takes on old standards such
as " 'Round Midnight" and newer numbers such as David Benoit's "Santa Barbara."
</P>
<P>
Algo Caliente is considering a more marketable name, Cameron said, perhaps Hot
Vasquez, borrowed from the group's percussionist and drummer Carlos Vasquez.
Besides Cameron and Vasquez, Algo Caliente includes Mel Goot on keyboards, Russ
Caldwell on percussion, Esteban Favela on saxes and Chuck Shiele on bass, with
occasional guest percussionists.
</P>
<P>
This Friday and Saturday nights, it will be at Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach,
and it will play Croce's in downtown San Diego most Friday nights during
December.
</P>
<P>
Today, Thanksgiving Day, KSDS-FM (88.3) is celebrating the 50th anniversary of
Blue Note, the influential jazz label.
</P>
<P>
From 9 to 9, they will run down a virtual history of jazz, from boogie to bop
and into the future. Don't miss the special Blue Note history segment, a
company documentary, airing at 9 a.m.
</P>
<P>
John Coltrane, Jackie McLean, Dexter Gordon, Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, Lee
Morgan, Horace Silver and Lou Donaldson are among the featured artists. Along
with playing Blue Note's CD reissues of great albums, KSDS will air a few
rarities, such as "Money Jungle," a 1962 piano trio album, Duke Ellington's
only project for the label. It features four previously unheard Ellington tunes
discovered when the original tapes were pulled to remix them for reissue.
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Tonight at 7, the 10th annual San Diego Thanksgiving Dixieland Jazz
Festival opens at the Town &amp; Country Hotel in Mission Valley. Among the
bands making their first festival appearance are the Paramount Jazz Band from
Boston, the Frisco Syncopators from New Orleans and the Norwegian Magnolia Jazz
Band. The festival continues through Sunday. Tickets good for all four days of
music are $55; day passes are also available. . . . This Friday and Saturday
nights at Croce's in downtown San Diego, it's sax man Joe Marillo, who just
made a digital demo recording at Diego's Loft.

PHAR LAP'S LEGEND LIVES ON IN AUSTRALIA
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, THE WASHINGTON POST
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
SYDNEY, Australia
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this year, I was showing an Australian visitor the main attractions of
Washington, D.C., and took him, of course, to the Lincoln Memorial. I said that
Lincoln was the most universally revered figure in our nation's history, and
asked him who would have a comparable stature in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The visitor didn't hesitate: "Phar Lap."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, there do seem to be more monuments in Australia to the legendary
racehorse of the 1930s than to any of the country's founders. His statue graces
the entrance to Flemington Race Course, site of the Melbourne Cup. The original
Phar Lap was stuffed by a taxidermist and is on display at a museum in
Melbourne, where it is a major tourist attraction. His heart has been preserved
under glass at the Australian Institute of Anatomy in Canberra. (Naturally,
it's a gigantic heart.)
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the death of the champion -- after an ill-fated trip to North America
-- still is a nettlesome issue here. On my first day in this country, the taxi
driver from the airport recognized my accent and talked at length about how
Aussies love Americans, how they've never forgotten that we were allies in
World War II, but added one small proviso: "We'll never forgive you for killing
Phar Lap."
</P>
<P>
No great racehorse has ever had a career so melodramatic. Phar Lap was bred in
New Zealand and entered in a yearling sale there. A scuffling Australian
trainer, Harry Telford, loved his pedigree, and persuaded an owner named David
J. Davis to make the purchase.
</P>
<P>
When Phap Lap arrived from New Zealand after a rough crossing of the Tasman
Sea, skin had been torn off his head and he limped out of the tight quarters he
had occupied on ship. Davis didn't want him, and so he leased him to Telford
for three years -- an agreement that would prove to be fateful.
</P>
<P>
Phar Lap -- the name means "lightning" in Sinhalese, the major language of Sri
Lanka -- was slow to bloom, but he won his last nine races as a 3-year-old and
was a popular champion by the time he was 4 and was preparing for the Melbourne
Cup. Bookmakers stood to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars if he won.
</P>
<P>
His groom, Tommy Woodcock, recalled the events of that week in a film interview
made shortly before his death a few years ago: "Mr. Telford got several letters
that they were going to shoot him or run him down in the road. One morning we
were going from the racetrack back to the stable and I happened to see this car
on the road. The car started, and I took Phar Lap to the corner and pushed him
to the fence. The car comes whizzing around the corner and all of a sudden a
gun comes out the back window and fires a couple shots. They missed by a couple
feet."
</P>
<P>
After that close call, Phap Lap went into hiding before the Cup and arrived at
Flemington under police escort 40 minutes before post time. The crowd roared at
his arrival, and roared even louder after he carried 138 pounds to victory in
the two-mile race.
</P>
<P>
Despite being burdened by crushing weights, Phar Lap won 15 of 17 races as a
4-year-old. As a 5-year-old, he won nine of 10.
</P>
<P>
By then, Telford's three-year lease had expired, Davis was in charge and he
chose to accept an invitation the trainer wanted to decline: to run in a stakes
race at the Agua Caliente track in Tijuana, Mexico, just south of San Diego,
for the then-incredible purse of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
Woodcock went with him on the ghastly ocean trip, but Phar Lap weathered it
well enough that he was able to win the Caliente Handicap in track-record time,
beating some of the best horses in North America. Now he was an international
hero -- American newspapers hailed him as the "Red Terror from the Antipodes"
-- and Davis was planning on running him in the United States, then in England.
</P>
<P>
Phar Lap, of course, never got that chance. Woodcock was looking after him in
Menlo Park, Calif., where, he said: "Early one morning he got a little sick --
just a little temperature -- but by the next day he was in terrible pain. It
was pitiful really, all the squealing and the pain he was in. I led him into
the box (his stall) and he let out one unmerciful squeal and died in my arms."
</P>
<P>
The next day, flags in Australia were flying at half-mast, and headlines in
newspapers said simply: "HE'S DEAD."
</P>
<P>
Who or what killed Phar Lap? After the earlier attempts on his life,
Australians were naturally conspiracy-minded, and a Melbourne reporter who
accompanied him on his North American trip reported he was killed by poisoned
balls of clay that were thrown through the window of his stall.
</P>
<P>
The truth probably was much less dramatic. Isobel Carter, Phar Lap's principal
biographer, researched the whole issue in depth and concluded that the horse
had eaten "highly fermentable green pasture" that caused his stomach to swell
and brought on a fatal attack of colic.
</P>
<P>
The mysterious circumstances only added to the Phar Lap legend.
</P>
<P>
"He came along in the Depression years and he was a symbol of hope and
optimism," said Gary Gray, who conducted the Tommy Woodcock interview and has
produced films on Australian racing history here. "He also told the world that
we could produce horses to beat the best, and we could do a whole lot of other
things too. We were not just a colony. Phar Lap was a symbol of our emergence
as a nation."

Beyond jazz's mainstream and outside the confines of commercial jazz radio,
singer and guitarist James Blood Ulmer continues his idiosyncratic
explorations.
</P>
<P>
Ulmer, who plays two shows at the Spirit Club in San Diego this Friday night,
has often been linked to jazzman Ornette Coleman and rock guitarist Jimi
Hendrix. In truth, he's one of the few true originals around.
</P>
<P>
And, according to Ulmer, the press has overemphasized his ties to Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
"I never played with him. Yeah, he played guitar, but the only guitar player I
listen to is Wes Montgomery."
</P>
<P>
On the 1987 album "America -- Do You Remember the Love?," his last American
release, Ulmer's vocals call to mind the earthy storytelling of Taj Mahal,
while his best guitar work has a melodic, meditative quality due in part to the
unusual tunings he uses.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, Ulmer explained, all strings are tuned to the same note, so that
open strings create a harmonic drone like the effect achieved by Indian
sitarists. Although Ulmer's guitar work on his vocal numbers tends to be sparse
and supportive of the singing, on instrumental tunes his improvisations often
become collages of fiery, staccato fragments that reveal his '60s and '70s
experiences with avant garde saxophonists Coleman and Arthur Blythe.
</P>
<P>
After years of recording pretty much what pleased him, which made albums like
"America" a rich mix of the danceable and the cerebral, Ulmer is changing his
tactics in search of a broader following. Now, instead of doing earthy vocal
songs side by side with searing, spacey instrumentals, Ulmer has two bands, one
for each of the two directions.
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of being related to as a weird guitar player who does everything at
once," Ulmer said. "More innovative, creative musical ideas create an elite
audience. Now I'm trying to expand my audiences."
</P>
<P>
With the group Phalanx, Ulmer continues to explore his instrumental music. He's
appearing in San Diego with his other band, which supports the vocal music he
refers to as his "blues thing." This band includes bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma
and percussionist Calvin Weston, both of whom also played with Coleman.
</P>
<P>
Currently without an American recording deal, Ulmer has two albums due for
release early next year: "James Blood Ulmer's Blues Experience," and a session
with drummer Ronald Shannon Jackson and bassist Bill Laswell. He's hoping to
make his next album for a U.S. label.
</P>
<P>
Even though he wants to reach a larger audience, Ulmer doesn't care to predict
which radio format might accommodate his music.
</P>
<P>
"Lord, I don't know that. If I had to figure that out and write music, too, I'd
be in big trouble."
</P>
<P>
Ulmer plays shows at 9 and 11:15. Opening will be The Crows, combining members
of Manhattan Transfer and the Mighty Penguins.
</P>
<P>
After Ulmer kicks it off, the Week of the Guitarist continues Tuesday night,
Dec. 12, in the San Diego City College Theater with a debut performance by Jim
Storey with his new band Open Channel.
</P>
<P>
Storey, 36, has played with Eddie Henderson, Richie Cole and Pharoah Sanders,
as well as locals Hollis Gentry, Joe Marillo, Bruce Cameron and the late Ella
Ruth Piggee, but he's trying to launch a career as a leader. The music, he
hopes, is challenging, but also accessible.
</P>
<P>
"This is sort of progressive fusion," Storey said. "We use acoustic bass,
percussion and drums with electric guitar, keyboards and sax. It's not really
funk like Lites Out jazz. It's more progressive, leaning toward Latin."
</P>
<P>
Storey, who grew up emulating blues masters like B.B. King and Albert King
before chasing after jazzmen like Kenny Burrell, Wes Montgomery, Joe Pass, John
Scofield, John Abercrombie and Pat Metheny, has put together a crack crew
including saxophonist Steve Feierabend, Chris Conner on bass, Alan Eicher on
keyboards, Danny Campbell on drums and Kim Kimmery on percussion. The band has
a repertoire including 30 of Storey's compositions.
</P>
<P>
Their 8 p.m. performance will be broadcast live on KSDS-FM (88.3). If you don't
live in the heart of the city, you can receive the signal over most local cable
television systems. A "splitter" allows you to run a separate line directly to
the back of your receiver.
</P>
<P>
Checkfield partners and studio wizards John Archer and Ron Satterfield are
putting the finishing touches on the follow-up album to "Through The Lens,"
titled "A View from the Edge." The band's first three albums have sold a total
of more than 160,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: The Daniel Hook Quartet, led by the French swing singer, will be
featured this Sunday at 7 p.m. on KSDS's "Le Jazz Club" program. At 1 p.m.
Saturday, Erin Searles will highlight the music of trumpeter Donald Byrd on her
"Silhouettes in Jazz" program. . . . At Croce's in downtown San Diego: Friday
night, Pieces, the a cappella group, and Algo Caliente; Saturday night: pianist
Bob Hamilton followed by the Joe Marillo Quartet; Sunday night: A.J. Croce
followed by Joe Marillo's jam session. . . . At Diego's Loft: Friday night,
saxophonist Gary Lefebvre; Saturday night, Algo Caliente; Sunday night, fusion
with Vehicles. . . . Tonight and Friday night at the B Street Cafe &amp; Bar in
downtown San Diego: the Mark Lessman Band. . . . Next Wednesday, Dec. 13,
Fattburger plays Art Good's "Jazz Trax Nite" at the Catamaran in Mission Beach.

SPORTS BETTING CONSIDERED A THREAT TO RACING INDUSTRY;
</P>
<P>
WAGERING: SPORTS BOOKS PROBABLY WOULD DIVERT MONEY FROM RACE TRACKS, SOME
HORSEMEN SAY.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A quiet alarm is being set off in all corners of the California horse racing
industry. Slowly but surely, it is alerting race track operators, horse owners,
breeders and trainers to a phenomenon that could make the competitive impact of
the state lottery look like a flea bite.
</P>
<P>
The challenge is coming from legalized sports betting, and it's coming quickly.
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Richard E. Floyd (D-Carson) has filed an initiative with the office
of the state attorney general that would put the sports-betting issue to a vote
on the general election ballot in November of 1990. Supporters of the
initiative are likely to begin collecting the needed 595,485 signatures in
January.
</P>
<P>
Floyd, whose district contains a large number of legal card parlors, has
proposed a measure that would create a Nevada-style atmosphere of
state-controlled gambling on all manner of sports, including collegiate events.
</P>
<P>
Sports betting, as envisioned by Floyd, would be conducted primarily by
established card parlors and race tracks. But the wording of the initiative
allows for anyone with a clean record and a $100,000 license fee to set up a
sports book in a community where local laws permit.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the initiative permits betting by telephone, similar to Nevada
practice, wherein persons with an established account may simply call in bets
to their local sports book, then sit back and watch the game on television.
</P>
<P>
Such sports books would be taxed between 3% and 6% of gross revenues after
paying off winning bets. The higher the revenues, the higher the tax bite. The
state's share of the tax revenue would be earmarked for services to senior
citizens, according to the initiative.
</P>
<P>
There is even something called the "Anti-Pete Rose Provision" that makes
athletes and coaches who bet on their own sports subject to felony prosecution
and up to three years in jail.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BYPASSING LEGISLATURE
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Ruch, a spokesman for Floyd, explained why the initiative process was
chosen for sports betting, rather than running it through the legislature.
</P>
<P>
"There's almost a puritanical reaction in the legislature when any kind of
gaming proposal is introduced," Ruch said from his Sacramento office.
</P>
<P>
"The lottery failed for 20 years in the legislature," Ruch went on. "Then, the
first time it was put to the people, it was enacted right off the bat. Dick
(Floyd) has introduced a sports-betting proposal for four years in a row and
not been able to get another single legislator to vote for it."
</P>
<P>
The initial reaction within the horse racing community has been one of wary
opposition. With few exceptions, racing leaders see sports betting as direct
competition to pari-mutuel betting. Were sports betting to become a reality in
the form of the Floyd initiative, they predict dramatic decreases in race track
handles and, as a result, purse money for owners, trainers, breeders, jockeys
and stable personnel who are on some sort of profit-sharing plan.
</P>
<P>
Of course, to the man or woman in the street, there is little ethical
difference between betting on horses and betting on basketball. A bet is a bet.
</P>
<P>
John Harris, president of the California Thoroughbred Breeders Assn., is aware
that the racing lobby could come off as blatantly self-serving in opposing
sports betting.
</P>
<P>
"We've got to be careful in our arguments that we don't sound hypocritical,"
Harris said. "At the same time, we can't get away from the bottom line. Sports
betting could damage the horse racing industry."
</P>
<P>
The realists among racing's leaders are looking back on the lessons learned in
their losing campaign against the state lottery in 1984. If sports betting is
inevitable, they are hoping to shape the legislation to their advantage, rather
than merely wringing their hands and pleading for relief when business begins
to plummet.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the race track least alarmed by the prospect of sports
betting is Golden Gate Fields in Albany, south of Oakland. Golden Gate is owned
by Ladbroke, the British bookmaking firm that operates about 2,000 betting
shops in England and western Europe.
</P>
<P>
Pete Tunney, Golden Gate vice president and general manager, conceded the
obvious.
</P>
<P>
"I would think Ladbroke would be very interested in looking at sports betting
in some form, whether on the race track or off, because that's the business
they're in," Tunney said.
</P>
<P>
"We have not, however, had a chance to really study what has been proposed. We
know what we read. Now we need to know exactly what Floyd has in mind."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A PIECE OF THE ACTION
</P>
<P>
Golden Gate was criticized when it became the only track to withhold funds from
the racing industry's battle against the California lottery. As it turned out,
the track saved money. The lottery passed by an overwhelming margin.
</P>
<P>
"That's our concern," Tunney said. "If sports betting is going to become a
reality, I think we'd like to be a part of it and have it properly structured."
</P>
<P>
At Del Mar, the philosophy is similar, according to Joe Harper, executive vice
president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, the initiative would have to be changed considerably to work for
racing, rather than just rearrange the same disposable income," Harper said.
</P>
<P>
"The only way I can see it working is to have the tracks operate some or most
of the sporting books, or something that wouldn't compete with the other books,
and have those revenues going toward the racing associations. The only other
way is to run it in such a way that you're not competing in the same market
area, and I can't see that happening. The market areas are L.A., San Diego, San
Francisco for everybody."
</P>
<P>
Del Mar is in a position to partially gauge the impact of sports betting on
race track business. The sports book at Caliente race track just across the
border in Tijuana has been in operation since mid-September and does a reported
$750,000 in action each week, whereas Del Mar's inter-track betting on Los
Angeles area racing handles roughly $2.5 million weekly.
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to measure its impact yet," Harper said. "But you talk to the
people at Caliente and in Las Vegas and they'll tell you the horseplayers and
sports book patrons don't really mix."
</P>
<P>
Fistfights between the two groups forced Caliente management to move sports
bettors to another building. Seems the noise level of those cheering for
football teams disturbed the more sedate handicappers.
</P>
<P>
No formal meetings have been held between Floyd and the various racing
interests over sports betting. Floyd's staff, however, is optimistic. Ruch
hinted that there was already support from some tracks.
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park, which bucks the football season, is opposing the sports-betting
initiative as written. At the same time, the track has introduced eight sports
viewing centers throughout its vast racing plant in an attempt to lure people
back to the track and away from their weekend easy chairs. Marje Everett,
Hollywood Park's chief operating officer, insisted that sports centers are not
a precursor to actual sports books.
</P>
<P>
"When we were talking about the sports centers, we wanted to be careful not to
identify them in a way they could be interpreted as a sports betting set-up,"
Everett said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not feel sports betting is something we should support. It's an
unhealthy thing for sports. You're legitimatizing bookmaking, something that
could cause a scandal somewhere down the road. We've all seen it happen. And it
would be very difficult to regulate and supervise properly."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A CAUTIOUS APPROACH
</P>
<P>
Still, the racing industry's position is perhaps best reflected in the cautious
approach taken by Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we're concerned," said Santa Anita president Cliff Goodrich.
"Sports betting just means an added element of competition. Dick (Floyd) has
tried to help the industry in allowing race tracks to be potential sports book
licensees. But there are many other potential licensees surrounding us."
</P>
<P>
Goodrich is seeking more data on public sentiment toward sports betting before
committing to any sort of political strategy.
</P>
<P>
"In the case of the lottery, we probably never had a chance," Goodrich pointed
out. "Though we tried to beat it, there was a tremendous groundswell of
support.
</P>
<P>
"Sports betting, on the other hand, is perceived more like true gambling. Our
inclination is that the public as a whole would not be as prone to favor it as
they did the lottery. If it's a close call, we might take one position. If it's
inevitable, we might take another."
</P>
<P>
Del Mar's Harper worries that recent developments might have encouraged a
climate in which sports betting could be accepted by the electorate.
</P>
<P>
"Between inter-track betting and the lottery, the taboos of gambling have
already been removed to a certain extent," Harper said. "We do have betting
everywhere now -- if that's what you want to call the lottery -- and sports
betting may be the next step. But I think it's much bigger step than people
realize. I think there will be some lines drawn on this issue that were not
drawn on the lottery."
</P>
<P>
Sports betting is certainly not an isolated California issue. In Oregon, the
lottery is hooked up to the point spreads of NFL games. In Kentucky, a sports
betting-lottery connection was beaten back by a powerful horse industry lobby,
which includes Lt. Gov. Brereton Jones, a noted breeder. And in Louisiana,
where sports betting is right around the corner, the Fair Grounds Race Course
in New Orleans is welcoming it with open arms.
</P>
<P>
Race tracks, as potential sports book outlets, have a built-in reason to
compromise on the issue. Breeders, owners and trainers, however, are on the
outside looking in. They would need specific modifications in the language of
the initiative -- or special legislation -- to get a piece of the
sports-betting pie.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STEERING COMMITEE
</P>
<P>
Trainer Eddie Gregson is the head of a committee appointed by the California
Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Assn. that will seek to stop the
sports-betting drive, or at least bend the initiative to its advantage.
</P>
<P>
Joining Gregson on the committee are trainers Charlie Whittingham and Richard
Mandella, horse owners Ed Friendly and Mace Siegel, CHBPA attorney Don Johnson
and Nat Wess, general manager of the breeders' association.
</P>
<P>
Gregson and his committee plan to meet with Gov. George Deukmejian as well as
the two men who figure to meet in next year's gubernatorial election, Sen. Pete
Wilson and Attorney General John Van de Kamp.
</P>
<P>
"I think Floyd is a cinch to get this on the ballot," said Gregson, a native
Californian. "And if sports betting went on the ballot next month, it would
pass in a landslide. Hopefully, the governor and the two candidates for the
governorship will be against it."
</P>
<P>
Gregson said the first thing his committee will do is meet with lobbyists in
Sacramento "to try to understand the opposition."
</P>
<P>
"We're not interested in a move against Floyd politically," Gregson said.
"We're trying to understand the enemy."
</P>
<P>
Even though he claims to be a big fan of horse racing, Floyd is not the most
popular legislator with some segments of the industry.
</P>
<P>
Last March, Floyd introduced what he called the "Drug-Free Horse Racing Act" in
the Assembly, which called for an end to California's controlled medication
program for race horses.
</P>
<P>
Floyd made the proposal during a controversy over the California Horse Racing
Board's handling of what were initially identified as cocaine positives in
horses trained by several well known conditioners. The board later dropped all
charges on the advice of the state attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
And whereas Floyd cites a desire to recapture the gambling money flowing to Las
Vegas and illegal bookmakers as the reason for his initiative, Gregson sees the
sports betting movement as simply another indirect tax.
</P>
<P>
"People are so opposed to raising taxes that politicians are desperate to find
alternative ways to raise revenues for welfare programs," Gregson said.
</P>
<P>
"I really believe this will kill our business," he added. "As far as I'm
concerned, those universities are not going to benefit enough by what we're
betting on their football teams to make any difference. And sports betting is
not going to employ anybody -- it's going to be a relief for taxation, if
indeed the money does get to senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
"The racing industry, on the other hand, generates so many jobs, so many
careers, that to destroy all that for something that's manufactured on a
television camera . . . to me the comparison is odious.
</P>
<P>
"I would hope," Gregson said, "that we're a little bit better than just a
gambling sport."

TRAINER GETS EARLY WEDDING PRESENT
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four days before the big event, Victor Garcia collected a memorable wedding
present.
</P>
<P>
Approved To Fly, best known previously for having her number taken down after
the 1988 Del Mar Debutante, rallied under Alex Solis to win the $81,225 Linda
Vista Handicap Wednesday at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
Owner of only a maiden victory at Caliente and an allowance win at Del Mar in
13 previous starts, the 3-year-old Flying Paster filly overhauled favored
Affirmed Classic in the final yards to win going away in 1:42 1/5 for the 1 1/6
miles.
</P>
<P>
Approved To Fly's 6-1 upset provided the 25-year-old Garcia, the son of
Caliente operator Juan Garcia, with his second Oak Tree stakes victory. Last
year, he saddled Wait Till Monday to win the Henry P. Russell Handicap.
</P>
<P>
Given eight months off after finishing fourth in the Bay Meadows Oaks in
January, Approved To Fly cruised in her sprint comeback, then ran second to
Affirmed Classic in the Torrey Pines.
</P>
<P>
A trip to Kentucky proved fruitless. She never mounted a rally and wound up
sixth, 13 lengths back of Winning Colors at Turfway Park.
</P>
<P>
"The track was kind of heavy and was favoring speed horses," said Garcia, who
will wed Litta Parra Sunday in San Diego. "The horse had a little heat in the
ankle when we turned her out, but it was nothing bad.
</P>
<P>
"She's more experienced now. She was green before and used to lug in and out."
</P>
<P>
Seeking her third consecutive victory for Ron McAnally since arriving in
California, Affirmed Classic appeared to be home free a sixteenth out, but
couldn't contain the winner. With Russell Baze sitting in for Jesus Castanon,
still nursing a bruised shoulder after being dumped in a workout spill Sunday,
she was nearly two lengths clear of stablemate Paper Princess.
</P>
<P>
"I saved ground all the way to the quarter pole," said Solis, the rider when
Approved To Fly was disqualified for bothering Lea Lucinda in the Debutante.
"At the quarter pole, she got clear and in the last sixteenth I whipped her
left-handed and she took off."
</P>
<P>
Oak Tree Notes
</P>
<P>
In his third full day in Southern California, Gary Boulanger doubled Wednesday.
The 21-year-old rider from Longacres in Washington won with 25-1 shot More
Golden in the second and Only The Facts in the fourth. . . . There's a Pick Six
carryover for today of $59,450. . . . Although she has only one stakes win,
Approved To Fly has been second in four others. . . . Her Linda Vista victory
was worth $47,475 to owners Barry and Judith Becker. . . . The Hillsborough
Handicap from Bay Meadows will be simulcast locally Saturday.

Mexican tourism officials are dumbfounded about the drop in the number of
tourists in Baja California this winter.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the worst (winter tourism) seasons suffered by Tijuana and
Rosarito in many years," said William Yu Cong, president of the Tijuana
Convention and Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
It's the same story in the seaside city of Ensenada.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism has decreased a lot in Ensenada this winter," said Alejandro
Rodriguez, spokesman for the Ensenada Tourism Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Hotel occupancy rates in Ensenada are down 30% from last year. Business in
Tijuana's restaurants is down 35% and room occupancy rates are down 60%.
</P>
<P>
Business at gift and curio shops in Rosarito, just south of Tijuana, is down
30% and some restaurants are closing, officials say.
</P>
<P>
Some tourism officials blame the state government's lack of tourism promotion
for its woes. Other say it is the recent increase in toll fees along the scenic
65-mile Tijuana-Ensenada coastal road. Fees recently tripled to $2.25 for each
of the three toll stations between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
Others blame the troubles on the 2 1/2-month-old strike at Caliente Racetrack,
while others say long lines at the border crossings also discourage tourism.
</P>
<P>
"Visitors come to Rosarito for a few hours to eat and shop and have a good
time," said Hugo Torres Chabert, owner of the Rosarito Beach Hotel and an
adviser to the town's tourism bureau.
</P>
<P>
"Then, when they want to return home, what awaits them at the border? A
two-hour wait. They become discouraged and will think twice before making the
trip down here again," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tijuana tourism officials say their economy also is being affected
by local residents crossing to San Diego. The tourism bureau says Tijuana
residents spent $1.5 billion in San Diego stores last year.
</P>
<P>
Max Schetter, senior vice president of the Greater San Diego Chamber of
Commerce, said that although the chamber has no current statistics on Mexicans'
financial effect on San Diego, Tijuana's figures were "probably in the
ballpark."
</P>
<P>
Both Torres and Schetter say a third border crossing is needed.
</P>
<P>
"Those long waits do deter trade and do deter a healthy transportation flow,"
Schetter said. "It acts as a restraint to free flow of traffic between two good
neighbors."
</P>
<P>
Customs officials say that the wait at border crossings is usually about 45
minutes, but that the number of daily crossings continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Mexican tourism officials will try to overcome the current
crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We realize that the pie is not that big anymore, that the competition from San
Diego and our own backyard is growing larger," Yu said. "We need to create a
better tourism infrastructure that will attract a steady influx of visitors on
a year-round basis."
</P>
<P>
But some tourism officials say the decrease in tourists is normal for the
winter.
</P>
<P>
"It's winter. It's cold and people in California are worried about paying their
taxes, about sending their children to school, about work," said Fortino
Cabrera, president of the Tijuana hoteliers association.
</P>
<P>
"For us, it's time to retreat a bit and work on mending our fences, on
remodeling and fixing our businesses, on taking inventory," he said. "We'll
bounce back. We have been going through these 'crises' for decades and we
always come out of it fine."

<LEADPARA>  MONTEZUMA, the 16th-century Aztec emperor, was one of Mexico's earliest spa
enthusiasts. In fact, three of the mineral baths that Montezuma visited -- in
Tehuacan, Ixtapan de la Sal and Oaxtepec -- are still in use. A number of
Mexican spas (balnearios) are true resorts, with swimming, tennis, horseback
riding and hiking. Spas with these facilities are the most expensive. Others
are mainly places to "take the waters," either outside in natural mineral
springs or inside in spring-fed pools.;    As more Americans discover the
pleasures and benefits of mineral baths, the number of spas grows. And
Mexico's spa potential is formidable -- there are more than 570 known
warm-water mineral springs in the country.  </LEADPARA>

<HEAD>Newspaper's Gun Photograph Denounced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black leaders have denounced a front-page
photograph in The Boston Sunday Globe, saying it is racist and
glorifies guns.
   The photograph in the April 29 newspaper, which accompanied an
article on the widespread availability of guns, showed a black man
with his athletic shirt pulled up to reveal a gun in his belt. The
caption said the man identified himself as a drug dealer.
   State Sen. Bill Owens, D-Boston, said the Globe's photograph was
exploitive and showed black youths in a negative light. He also
said it seemed to have been staged for the photographer.
   ``The question that comes to my mind is, when do you begin to
make news and when do you begin to sell it,'' he said.
   Owens said the photograph could fuel violence in the city:
``Suppose this person is a gang member. Another gang member will
try to outdo that person.''
   Globe Editor John S. Driscoll said in a prepared statement: ``We
understand their concerns. Our intent was not to depict a
particular person but to reflect the issue explained in the story.''
   Rep. Shirley Owens-Hicks, D-Boston, said the photograph made
dealing drugs look ``cool.''
   ``The article had a lot of good information,'' she added. ``But
a picture, as they say, is worth a thousand words. This picture is
worth a thousand words to gang members. This says it is all right
to carry a gun, in that you'll get acknowledgment in the newspaper
for it.''
   Bill Owens also said the story ``had a lot of truth.'' But, he
said, a better accompanying photograph might have been taken of
money-laundering in the city's financial district of ``white-collar
guys counting the money that they have made off the black
community.''

<HEAD>Arrest Made in Tijuana Columnist's Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man sought in the slaying of popular
journalist Hector ``Gato'' Felix is in custody in Tijuana, Baja
California Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel announced May 1.
   Antonio Vera Palestina, former head of security at Agua Caliente
racetrack in Tijuana, is one of two men accused in the killing of
Felix, 47, who was gunned down April 20, 1988, as he drove to work.
   Ruffo said in a statement that Vera was returned to Tijuana from
Southern California, where he was taken into custody by Los Angeles
County sheriff's deputies for allegedly being in the United States
illegally.
   Victoriano Medina Moreno, a former guard at the racetrack, was
sentenced last year to 27 years to life in prison for the murder of
Felix.
   The journalist was co-editor of Zeta, a muckraking weekly
tabloid. He died after being shot twice at close range with a
12-gauge shotgun.
   Co-Editor Jesus Blancornelas has charged repeatedly in the
newspaper that although Vera may have been the triggerman, as
authorities believe, investigators still must seek the
``intellectual author'' of the crime.
   Felix regularly lampooned Tijuana's elite in his gossip column,
``A Bit of Something.'' He was especially hard on Agua Caliente
racetrack owner Jorge Hank Rhon, 35, in the weeks before his death.
   Rhon repeatedly and vehemently has denied any involvement,
saying he had no reason to seek Felix's death.

<HEAD>Flood of Anonymous Claims Leads to Caution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with a flood of phone calls and
facsimile messages claiming responsibility for terrorist attacks,
Colombia's news media are beginning to ignore the messages.
   The reason is simple _ it is impossible to tell who is really on
the other end of the line. Drug traffickers? Police posing as drug
traffickers? Leftist guerrillas? Pranskters?
   Until a few weeks ago, virtually all of Colombia's radio
stations and newspapers used the statements without question. No
one pointed out the information came from anonymous people and
could not be verified.
   Recently, the country's two leading newspapers, Bogota's El
Espectador and El Tiempo, chose not to publish news about some of
the anonymous messages.
   An example of the confusion came after leftist presidential
candidate Carlos Pizarro was killed April 26 by an assassin on a
Colombian airliner.
   Within two hours, the anonymous telephone calls started.
   It was the Medellin cartel, one man said. Another president
would be assassinated, he said.
   The next day brought another facsimile message, also supposedly
from the Medellin cartel, to a Bogota radio station, Caracol.
   It wasn't us, the supposed cartel communique said. It accused
the police of killing people and setting off bombs so that the
cartel would be blamed.
   Another example came after a truck bomb in Medellin killed 20
people on April 11.
   Facsimile statements under the letterhead of the Extraditables,
a name assumed by leaders of the Medellin cartel, said the cartel
was not responsibile.
   Recently there have been facsimile and telephone messages from
anonymous people claiming to speak for the cartel, saying those
statements directly after the April 11 bombing were fakes.
   ``Somebody has been using us as their public relations office,''
a senior editor at a Bogota newspaper said April 28.

RACING: BUT APPRENTICE JOCKEY CHRISTINE DAVENPORT INSISTS ON MAKING HER MARK AT
DEL MAR, AMONG THE BIG BOYS.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
DEL MAR
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trainers, agents and even fellow jockeys tell her to go elsewhere. They explain
that some of the best jockeys have problems getting mounts at Del Mar, let
alone winning races.
</P>
<P>
Steve Cauthen once went through a zero-for-120 streak on the Southern
California circuit. Ron Hansen came to Del Mar this year as a highly touted
jockey from the Northern California racing circuit, but he left after winning
just three of 73 races. Apprentice Vann Belvoir, 16, made a name for himself in
Seattle and thus landed a prominent agent in Scotty McClellan, but he left Del
Mar shaking his head after winning just two of his 89 races.
</P>
<P>
So why does Christine Davenport, who has won just three times in almost two
full meetings at Del Mar, insist on getting rid of her bug -- race track
shorthand for her apprentice label -- against perhaps the best collection of
jockeys in the world?
</P>
<P>
Why does she put up with dressing with the other women in a barber shop, where
there's no TV monitor or toilet?
</P>
<P>
"Why go where it doesn't count?" she asks. "So you're winning races and riding
horses that are about ready to break your neck. Big deal."
</P>
<P>
But there's more to it than competing with the big boys or looking out for her
own safety. To Davenport, the issue is much bigger.
</P>
<P>
It's about blazing a trail for her gender on a circuit that has always been
dominated by males. Sure, female jockeys have shown they can ride. Julie Krone,
27, has won nearly 2,000 races on the "Jersey Circuit," and other women have
been successful on the East Coast and in Europe. But never at Hollywood Park,
Santa Anita or Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
"Somebody has to stay here for a while and make these people open their eyes,"
said Davenport, 25, with a touch of self-determination in her voice. "If don't
do it, I don't see anybody else coming up behind me.
</P>
<P>
"I still think it's kind of silly we're even talking about this in the 1990s.
And I can see why people would not me to ride their horses, because women have
never been successful here. I guess you're not going to change people's mind
overnight."
</P>
<P>
But most say people's minds will never be changed.
</P>
<P>
Trainer Brian Mayberry said Davenport's cause is noble but probably futile.
</P>
<P>
"Julie Krone is an outstanding talent, but she would have a tough time out
here," said Mayberry. "It's just an awfully tough place to get started for
anyone, but for a woman, it's even tougher. Historically, it's just been
difficult for women here."
</P>
<P>
McClellan said it will continue to be difficult.
</P>
<P>
"People are going to ride a guy before a girl," he said. "Not that I would, but
other people would. Right now, it's as tough as I've ever seen it out here. And
that's for anybody. There's only about 27 horses (three a race) with a
legitimate chance of winning, and there's 10 to 12 jockeys that are vying for
those horses. I'd love to see her do well, but she's fighting a tough battle."
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye said he'd like to see things change for women jockeys, but
he doesn't know if they ever will.
</P>
<P>
"I guess they don't feel (a woman) is as strong as a man," he said. "Back East,
they give a woman a better chance of running. Over the years here, I've seen
some good lady riders, but they've never stuck with it."
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye, who was the leading rider at Del Mar in 1989, said he gives
Davenport the best shot of anybody he's seen.
</P>
<P>
"She knows where she's at on a horse," he said. "I don't think she's very
strong on a horse, but I think people make too big a deal of that sometimes."
</P>
<P>
Delahoussaye's advice to Davenport?
</P>
<P>
"Personally, if I was her and I wasn't riding or winning much, I'd ride
somewhere else. I'd go where I'd get some more experience."
</P>
<P>
But Davenport, who's been riding for six years, feels she already has enough
experience. After beginning her career as an exercise rider at Thistledown,
outside of Cleveland, Davenport worked at tracks in Minnesota and Florida
before coming out to Caliente in 1988. Then in December, 1988, Davenport won
nine races and qualified to begin her apprenticeship.
</P>
<P>
For a while, Davenport would ride at Caliente on the weekends, where she
received $150 per victory, then drive up to Fairplex in Pomona or Los Alamitos
during the week. Finally, in 1989 she broke through at Hollywood Park's fall
meeting and won six races in six weeks. But at Del Mar, last summer, she won
just twice in 16 mounts.
</P>
<P>
Overall in 1989, Davenport won on 21 of her 283 mounts, with 14 seconds and 27
thirds -- not bad for a debut season. But this year, except for winning her
first stakes on On The Menu at Golden Gate Park in Berkeley, has been
disappointing. She was suspended for five days for a racing infraction at Santa
Anita and won just twice there. At Hollywood Park, she won only once in 19
mounts.
</P>
<P>
Although she won Friday on Mats Dolly, a 5-1 third favorite, Davenport's Del
Mar meeting has not been a banner one either -- she is two for 15 with no
seconds or thirds. Female jockeys Joy Scott, Vicky Frontiere and Kim Davis have
not fared much better -- they are 0 for 11 with one second, by Scott.
</P>
<P>
Davenport's winning mount two weeks ago perfectly illustrates the plight of the
female jockey at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
Hansen was originally supposed to ride Masai Chief, an 87-1 shot, but he left
to ride at Bay Meadows. Jockey after jockey turned down the ride on Masai Chief
until Davenport spoke up and took the mount.
</P>
<P>
The payoff on Masai Chief of $177.40 was the biggest at Del Mar in 16 years --
for her part, she earned a little over $1,000.
</P>
<P>
"I felt like I won the Derby," she said. "It was the first live horse I've had
this meeting. I feel like whenever I'm on a horse that's running, I usually
know what to do."
</P>
<P>
But those opportunities have been rare for Davenport. Usually, she's on a
longshot.
</P>
<P>
But then, it's hard to get decent mounts when you don't have an agent.
</P>
<P>
"Agents and I have never really gotten along," said Davenport, who has
nonetheless agreed to take on a part-time agent for now.
</P>
<P>
Somehow though, Davenport plods on, believing that she will be the first female
jockey to strike it rich in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
"It's only going to get better," she said. "I figure I've already gone through
the hard part."

   Pluralism Takes Hold in Mexico's Baja
   ---
   Rival-Party Governor Learns
   To Coexist with PRI
   ----
   By Matt Moffett
   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

<LP>
   TIJUANA, Mexico -- As many of the world's former one-party
states rush headlong toward political pluralism, Mexico is
moving more deliberately, gradually opening its political
system, which is marked by the longest reign of a single
political party in the noncommunist world.
   Last July citizens of the Mexican state of Baja California
Norte elected Ernesto Ruffo as Mexico's first opposition
governor in 60 years of rule by the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI. The victory of Mr. Ruffo, of the
conservative National Action Party, or PAN, was seen as a
step toward a system like that of India, where the ruling
party allows the opposition to control some regions.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   But in Baja, ingrained attitudes are proving hard to
change. Mexico's wild west has long been dominated by
gangsterish political strongmen, known as caciques. That
tradition of arbitrary, top-down rule is anathema to the
unassuming Mr. Ruffo, whose motto is "less government and
more society."
   Mr. Ruffo, a 37-year-old former corporate executive, has
emphasized good-government reforms within the bureaucracy.
The racketeering chief of the judicial police has been
jailed. Policemen are now required to take drug tests.
Traffic-fine collections have soared, possibly because
motorists think twice about bribing cops, who evidently think
twice about accepting bribes. Tax collections have more than
doubled.
   What's more, Mr. Ruffo has enjoyed surprising rapport with
the PRI-dominated federal government, which was expected to
harass the breakaway state at every turn. "I've found
communication at all levels," says Mr. Ruffo, who has had
more trouble with rifts within the PAN.
   But there's a sense of disillusionment in Baja. It's
visible on Tijuana's manic Boulevard Agua Caliente, where a
bankrupt toyshop shaped like a medieval castle has its mock
drawbridge chained shut. A sign appeals for help from the
governor -- not from customers. It's also evident in a poll
by the political magazine Zeta, which showed a decline in Mr.
Ruffo's popularity since his electoral triumph, though it
also showed him winning if the election were held again.
   "I think the people have very great expectations, they
want immediate results," says Mr. Ruffo. "But there's no
money."
   The state budget is tight as a drum, the result of the
country's economic crisis and the entrenched PRI patronage
system. Mr. Ruffo's budget makers say the public sector is
about 30% overmanned, with most posts protected by PRI-linked
unions. As a result, more than half the state budget goes to
payroll and only 11% to public works urgently needed in
Mexico's fastestgrowing state.
   Mr. Ruffo learned to slip out of such fiscal traps in his
prior post as mayor of the port of Ensenada. When enemies in
the PRI-controlled state government cut off the city's
funding, Mr. Ruffo took his program of government to the
streets. He made the most of an obscure law allowing the
government to solicit funds for refurbishing neighborhoods if
80% of residents assented. Residents were skeptical, but
eventually chipped in so much money that Ensenada paved more
streets than all the cities in the rest of the state
combined.
   In one middle-class barrio of Ensenada, Jose Maria Perez
looks with satisfaction on a new cement street. "To get
support as our mayor, Ruffo fixed the streets," he says. "But
to get support as governor, he must show he wants to fix this
whole corrupt system."
   For Mr. Ruffo's do-it-yourself brand of democracy to take
hold outside his hometown, many analysts say he must prove
himself a bigger man than the caciques suspected of
complicity in two much talked-about criminal cases: a
misappropriation of government funds and a murder of a
prominent reporter.
   A recent audit of deficit-ridden state finances confirmed
that the previous government had funneled about $9 million in
state funds into the PRI's gubernatorial campaign. "So many
people could have had a house, drainage, electricity," says
Mr. Ruffo.
   So far, some midlevel budget officials of the prior
administration have been prosecuted. But 81% of respondents
in the Zeta poll thought former governors should also be
called to account. Mr. Ruffo says he will pursue the
investigation wherever it leads, though he frets about
possible confrontation with the federal government.
   An equally delicate problem is the murder two years ago of
the state's most prominent political columnist, Hector Felix
Miranda. A worker at the local race track has been detained
as the alleged triggerman. But public scrutiny has focused on
the track's operator, Jorge Hank Rhon, a frequent target of
the columnist's barbs. The case has profound political
overtones because Mr. Hank Rhon is the son of Carlos Hank
Gonzalez, Mexico's agriculture minister, and one of the most
powerful political bosses in the country.
   "Because of the people that are in the spotlight of this
problem, it's probable that it's going to cause very intense
political problems," says Mr. Ruffo, who insists he won't
allow the case to die.
   Residents of Baja aren't so sure. Only 24% of respondents
to the Zeta poll think the murder will be solved.

FALLOUT YET TO SETTLE IN DEATH OF POPULAR TIJUANA JOURNALIST
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, Times Staff Writer

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Hector Felix Miranda slumped across the front seat of his car on a rainy
spring morning almost one year ago, the victim of two point-blank shotgun
blasts to his left side, a singular journalistic voice in Mexico was silenced.
</P>
<P>
But while his assassins quieted the irreverent and flamboyant columnist, widely
known here as El Gato (The Cat), the furor surrounding his sensational murder
has never fully abated, casting a pall over both journalism and politics -- two
of Felix's passions -- in the newsman's adopted home state of Baja California.
The fallout has yet to settle.
</P>
<P>
For many, the slaying, and the ensuing investigation that critics consider
inadequate, have become painful reminders of the tenuous position of a free
press in a nation where more than two dozen journalists have been slain in the
past six years. Most of the murders -- like the slaying of Felix, who was a
newspaper institution here for more than a decade -- have not been fully
solved.
</P>
<P>
"The case reflects the vulnerability of journalists everywhere in Mexico,
particularly those who chose to remain independent," said Victor Clark Alfaro,
a human rights activist here.
</P>
<P>
"The murder of Hector and what has happened since demonstrated that there is no
security for us," said Jose Enrique Garcia Sanchez, a respected longtime
reporter-photographer in Tijuana. "The custom of murdering journalists has not
been lost."
</P>
<P>
With the approach of the one-year anniversary of his slaying on April 20, there
is renewed pressure on authorities here to answer a vexing question: Who
ordered the murder of El Gato? Many say the answer lies in the halls of power
here.
</P>
<P>
In a highly charged election year, it is not a question that many politicians
affiliated with the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party are eager to
field. "The governor's been busy with other things," said Enrique Sanchez Diaz,
chief spokesman for Baja California Gov. Oscar Baylon Chacon, when asked about
the matter. The governor took office in January and is scheduled to serve until
Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
Critics say authorities would like the case to go away.
</P>
<P>
"The government hasn't cleared up anything," said J. Jesus Blancornelas, who
co-founded and co-edited the feisty weekly Zeta along with Felix and now sits
as the sole editor, although Felix's name remains on the masthead. "We still
want to know who was the intellectual author of the crime and the material
killers."
</P>
<P>
Felix's barbed and gossipy column, Un Poco de Algo (A Little of Something)
appeared each week in Zeta, which recently celebrated its ninth anniversary,
having survived Felix's death, a machine-gun attack on the office in 1987 (no
one was injured) and assorted other difficulties, including attempts by the
previous governor to thwart distribution. Characteristically combative, Zeta
since Felix's death has been publishing weekly excerpts from his past writings.
The columnist specialized in lampooning the rich and powerful, sometimes
viciously, often utilizing using indecorous words and phrases, double meanings,
puns and other verbal gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
Even his favorite targets occasionally acknowledged reveling in reading Felix's
often outrageous thoughts. "I owe my popularity to Gato," Tijuana Mayor
Federico Valdes, whom Felix often derided as a drunken incompetent, said
shortly after the murder.
</P>
<P>
The crime sparked demonstrations and calls for the resignation of then-Gov.
Xicotencatl Leyva Mortera, a favorite target of Felix, whom many charged with
acceding to -- or ordering -- a cover-up of the crime. Leyva denied any
wrongdoing. He was eventually replaced last January. Most analysts attributed
his replacement to widespread fear in the ruling party, known by its Spanish
acronym as the PRI, that Leyva's bad image -- exacerbated by the uproar
surrounding Felix's murder -- could cost them the crucial governor's seat in
July's elections.
</P>
<P>
Mexican authorities insist that they have solved the murder of Felix. Charged
in connection with the murder are Victoriano Medina Moreno, a 38-year-old
former Baja California state policeman who has been in custody for almost a
year, accused of being the triggerman and mastermind of the slaying, and
Antonio Vera Palestina, a former Mexico City policeman who is a fugitive,
although journalists here say he has been sited both in San Diego and in the
Mexico City area.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Didn't Act Alone
</P>
<P>
But while friends and associates of Felix say they have no doubt the pair
participated in the slaying, they express the strong belief that the two must
have been acting on the orders of someone who took a strong dislike to Felix,
either for personal reasons or because of something he wrote. Felix's enemies
were legion.
</P>
<P>
Newsmen here have publicly cited several prime "suspects," including the former
governor, but one name has stood out: Jorge Hank Rhon, 33-year-old president
and general manager of Caliente Racetrack, one of Tijuana's major employers and
tourist draws. Both of the two men charged worked for the track.
</P>
<P>
Hank, scion of a powerful Mexico City family, has adamantly denied any role in
the slaying, portraying himself as the victim of scandalous speculation. "The
answer is no. I didn't do it," he said during a dramatic post-midnight press
conference at his office last year following the arrest of Medina, the alleged
triggerman.
</P>
<P>
Mexican authorities, who adamantly deny any cover-up, have never even
questioned Hank in connection with the case. They say there is no need.
</P>
<P>
"From what I've seen, the case has been pursued diligently," said Luis
Hernandez Bazan, the deputy district attorney who is handling the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
The connections between Hank and the alleged killers are not in dispute. Vera,
the fugitive, arrived in Tijuana with Hank in January, 1985. Before he
disappeared after the slaying, Vera served as Hank's personal bodyguard, or
guarura, for 15 years, Hank confirmed in an interview.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the killing, Vera was in charge of security at the race track
and Medina was one of his lieutenants. Vera allegedly withdrew $10,000 in cash
from the track cashier at about the the time of the slaying, according to court
documents. (Hank said the money was for legitimate security expenses.)
</P>
<P>
"In Mexico, the bodyguard is like a Doberman," said Blancornelas, Felix's
longtime colleague, who has consistently pointed the finger at Hank. "He only
does what his boss tells him to do. He doesn't act on his own initiative,
because he could get his boss into trouble."
</P>
<P>
Said Hank of Blancornelas: "He has to sell newspapers."
</P>
<P>
Hank acknowledged that he and the slain journalist were social acquaintances,
although Hank said he was no closer to Felix than to other journalists in town.
The two, along with Alberto Murguia, a close associate of Hank, were frequently
seen together at the race track, parties and other social occasions.
</P>
<P>
But Felix was acid-tongued, and one of his favorite targets was Jorge Hank. In
one of his final columns, Felix referred to Hank obliquely as the "abominable
snowman" -- a reference either to Hank's flowing hair and beard (since shorn)
or, perhaps, his rumored taste for cocaine. Hank denied any use of the drug.
</P>
<P>
Each week since Felix's death, Zeta has published a black-bordered page,
"signed" by Felix, asking Hank: "Why did one of your bodyguards kill me?"
</P>
<P>
The print also asks former Gov. Leyva, now reportedly assigned to a minor
diplomatic post in Lisbon, Portugal: "Who ordered my killing?"
</P>
<P>
In response, Hank said in the interview, "It's been a year and they haven't
been able to prove anything."
</P>
<P>
As for Felix's column, Hank said he found it distasteful and offensive and
didn't bother to read it. "I thought it (the murder) was coming, because he was
attacking a lot of people, for a long time," Hank said. "I think it was
everything that lower-class people wanted to hear about, that's why it was so
popular. I personally was taught never to use bad words, so I never enjoyed
it."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tried to Tarnish Reputation
</P>
<P>
Since the murder, government officials and journalists affiliated with the
ruling party here have attempted to besmirch Felix's reputation, implying
strongly that his assassination was the result of a personal vendetta, perhaps
a crime of passion. Colleagues denounce the attacks as attempts to deflect
attention from the real issue of who killed Felix.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever Hector did in his personal life, no one had the right to kill him,"
said Jose Enrique Garcia, the Tijuana journalist, who now writes for a spicy
weekly newspaper called Cambio 21. The publication was founded six months ago,
after Garcia and his colleagues say they were pressured by the ownership of
their former newspaper to cut back on their aggressive coverage of the Felix
case, among other issues. "Whether he was killed for personal or political
reasons, authorities here have not had the moral willpower to pursue the case."
</P>
<P>
Medina's alleged motive for the slaying has mystified some. Authorities say
columns by Felix purportedly cost Medina his job as a state police squad leader
in 1985. According to prosecutors, Felix published items linking Medina to
alien smuggling, articles that eventually resulted in his firing.
</P>
<P>
But Blancornelas, Felix's longtime colleague, says he has researched every
column ever written by Felix and has never found the name of either Medina or
Vera. That, say he and other journalists here, is just one example of the
ineptness and unbelievability of the government inquiry.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez Bazan, the government prosecutor who had authority to call for
additional investigations, said he believed the motive offered in court papers:
that Medina lost his job because of articles penned by Felix.
</P>
<P>
Marco Antonio de la Fuente, the deputy Baja California Attorney General
responsible for Tijuana, declined to comment, saying he wasn't familiar with
the details of the case as he had been in office only a few months.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, Medina has given conflicting versions of his part in the
murder, admitting his role and then denying it. After he was arrested, he
retracted his "confession" at a press conference, contending that he was
tortured into signing the document.
</P>
<P>
In the account provided by authorities, Medina cased Felix's home for days
before the murder to familiarize himself with the journalist's routine.
Authorities say that Medina recruited Vera, his boss, to assist him in the
crime. On the morning of the slaying, authorities say, the two assassins
partially blocked a street frequented by Felix with their vehicle, forcing
Felix to slow down or stop as he drove to work in the rain. Medina then
allegedly approached Felix's blue Ford and pumped two rounds from a 12-gauge
shotgun through the driver's window. Felix slumped over beneath the glove
compartment, his head coming to rest on his briefcase, amid shattered glass. He
died almost instantly.
</P>
<P>
Citing ballistics evidence and Medina's short stature, colleagues of Felix have
maintained that the actual triggerman was Vera, while Medina was the driver.
The defense has also contended that Medina could not have been the one who shot
Felix.
</P>
<P>
Despite the doubts, the case against Medina proceeds. He could face up to 30
years in jail. By Mexican law, the non-jury trial must be completed by early
May, said Judge Braulio Gomez Veronica, who is hearing the case and is charged
with passing judgment and imposing a sentence.
</P>
<P>
"I haven't felt any pressure whatsoever," Gomez said. "All murder cases are
serious. This is no different -- except, of course, for the public attention."

SUSPECT IN SLAYING OF JOURNALIST HELD IN MEXICO
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A central suspect in the sensational slaying two years ago of Hector Felix
Miranda, a prominent Tijuana journalist widely known as El Gato, or The Cat,
was in the custody of Mexican authorities Wednesday after his arrest by Los
Angeles authorities earlier this week, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Vera Palestina, former chief of security at Tijuana's Caliente
Racetrack, was taken into custody Tuesday afternoon as he arrived near the
Greyhound bus terminal in downtown Los Angeles, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police and U.S. immigration officers arrested the longtime fugitive
after receiving a tip from Baja California authorities, who have been
investigating the journalist's slaying in April, 1988. Vera went to the station
to meet a friend, according to a statement by the Los Angeles Police
Department, which set up surveillance at the site.
</P>
<P>
Vera, 38, a former police officer in Mexico City, was in the United States
illegally and was consequently turned over to U.S. immigration authorities. On
Tuesday evening, he was returned to the U.S.-Mexico border, where he was turned
over to state police agents and jailed in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
Felix, 47, was killed on April 20, 1988, as he drove to work down a
rain-slicked street in Tijuana. A vehicle blocked his path, and an assassin
pumped two rounds from a 12-gauge shotgun through the driver's window of his
car.

ON THE OFFBEAT: WORLD BEAT COLLECTIONS -- STRIKING THE RIGHT NOTES
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quiz time: What do the major pop music styles of Colombia sound like?
</P>
<P>
Who are the big names on the Kenyan pop scene these days?
</P>
<P>
What exactly is Bhangra pop, anyway?
</P>
<P>
Most pop music fans don't exactly have those answers on the tip of their
tongues. But adventurous listeners could find out by checking into the various
artist compilations that are the focus of this edition of "On the Offbeat," a
periodic review of roots, ethnic and non-mainstream pop music from around the
globe.
</P>
<P>
Those samplers are often perfect for finding out if a particular style or the
music of a certain country or region hits the spot. It's possible to explore
the historical roots of a contemporary style or discover a favorite label,
producer, or crack team of session musicians to keep tabs on.
</P>
<P>
Then there are the unknown artists who unexpectedly pop up. Take the "Nairobi
Beat" album -- the Maroon Commandos were an unknown quantity but "Amua
Nikuiachie Kazi" certainly whets the appetite for more from the Kenyan Army's
7th Battalion band.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
COLOMBIAN "Cumbias Y Gaitas Famosas de Colombia, Vols. 1-3" Discos Fuentes
(Colombian imports) "Fiesta Vallenata" Shanachie
</P>
<P>
Typical -- no one paid any attention to Colombian pop music for years and
suddenly records are all over the place. "Fiesta Vallenata," part of
Shanachie's exemplary World Beat/Ethno Pop series, focuses on the
accordion-driven regional style from Colombia's Caribbean coast. The sprightly
sound, with swirling accordion lines, propulsive percussion and often wild bass
lines that obey a crazed logic of their own, has much of the festive flavor of
norteno music.
</P>
<P>
The "Cumbias Y Gaitas" series is more intriguing. Volume 3 is split evenly
between the two styles -- cumbias, the major indigenous rhythm developed in
Columbia, dominates its slightly more upbeat gaita offspring on the other
collections. The tracks probably date from the late '50s or early '60s -- some
have a loopy energy and percussive undertow redolent of Jamaican ska and others
a big band sound evoking images of a Ricky Ricardo-style conga line snaking
around the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
It's vibrant dance music featuring anything from accordion and blowsy trombones
to high-flying clarinets and a raucous electric rhythm guitar on "La
Magadalena." Vocal tracks are featured on Vol. 1, instrumentals prevail on the
other two albums and Volume 2 emerges as the best single collection courtesy of
its powerful opening punch of "Cumbia Cienaguera," "Cumbia Campesina," and "La
Magdalena." But grab any you see -- Discos Fuentes reportedly stopped selling
these albums overseas to focus attention on more recent releases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
AFRICAN "The Nairobi Beat: Kenyan Pop Music Today" Rounder
</P>
<P>
A professor of cultural anthropology compiled this collection and most of the
first side sounds like it. The music may be representative of Kenyan pop styles
-- which echo the lightly textured, multiple guitar sound of the popular
Zairian sound -- but the clinical performances lack the sparkle and excitement
pop fans cherish.
</P>
<P>
That lasts until the Maroon Commandos kick into 8 1/2 minutes of biting
guitars, evocatively rough vocals and delightful horns that unexpectedly enter
halfway through the arrangement. "The Nairobi Beat" never loses that momentum,
with particularly strong performances by the Gatundu Boys and the Mayanja
Bungoma Jazz Band standing out.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
LATIN AMERICAN "We Got Latin Soul," "Latino Club!" Caliente/Charly (UK imports)
</P>
<P>
The Latin pop/salsa spectrum has received short shrift in the world music surge
but now Charly -- the English label whose blues/soul/R&amp;B re-issues have
been invaluable -- has inaugurated its Caliente subsidiary. "Latin Soul"
focuses on material from the '60s, when Ray Barretto's "El Watusi" and Joe
Cuba's "Bang Bang" hit the pop charts with a compact riff/hook, vocal chant and
percussion break format. "Latino Club!" was assembled by British club deejays
and features '70s material more oriented toward instrumental solos flashing
over potent dance grooves. Both are solid -- the choice really boils down to
individual preference for tight songs or more expansive instrumental work.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CARIBBEAN "Port of Spain Shuffle," "Caribbean Connections" New Cross (UK
import)
</P>
<P>
These volumes capture the West Indian calypso performers, including the notable
veterans Lord Kitchener and Lord Beginner, who adapted their sunny, tropical
sound and topical commentary to life in Great Britain after migrating there in
the late '40s and early '50s. Despite such well-known tracks as Lion's "Ugly
Woman" and the original of "Man Smart and Woman Smarter" (recorded by Robert
Palmer years ago), "Port of Spain Shuffle" is weaker. The old-timey flavor of
the arrangements suffer in contrast with the snappier, jazz-infused music on
"Caribbean Connections." Some highlights there: "Nora, I Will Die a Bachelor,"
and "Calypso Be," Young Tiger's articulately stated put-down of the be-bop
brigade.

SPORTS KIDS' GOAL: CHARACTER THROUGH FITNESS
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE FRANK and STEVEN R. CHURM
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The goal of the nonprofit Sports Kids, its founders say, is to build character
in children through sports and physical fitness.
</P>
<P>
The four principals in the 18-month-old organization are Paul Stem, a former
Delta Air Lines executive; Bob Mathias, a former Olympic decathlon champion who
is the group's president; Chuck Foster, the executive director, and Larry
Sayler. Each is paid $85,000 a year, Foster said.
</P>
<P>
The group has an unpaid board of governors that includes celebrities such as
Mike Love of the Beach Boys and Jermaine Jackson of the Jackson family.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Mathias placed the organization's headquarters in Irvine rather than
Indianapolis, in part at the urging of then-Irvine City Councilman C. David
Baker. Officials say that Baker opened doors and introduced Sports Kids leaders
to influential people in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
The group, with offices in a suite on the 17th floor of the Irvine Marriott
Hotel, says its goal is to build programs for children ages 5 and up, and to
annually produce an international competition for boys and girls 10 to 13. The
group's motto is: "Participation Is Victory."
</P>
<P>
The group had its first major fund-raiser in April featuring singer Donny
Osmond. The event at the Marriott drew nearly 800 people who paid $250 a plate.
Foster said the organization cleared $30,000 after expenses.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, its first international Earth Games were held on the campus of UC
Irvine and drew 140 participants, including 14 from the Soviet Union and 16
from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The second Earth Games, a 13-day event, will begin Aug. 13 at the Caliente Race
Track in Tijuana, Mexico. About 500 children from 159 countries are expected to
take part in games such as soccer, baseball and basketball. GEORGE FRANK and

ACOUSTIC JAZZ PIANIST PUTS FUN AND INTENSITY IN MUSIC
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Pianist Michel Camilo prefers playing acoustic jazz, like the great beboppers
he looks up to, but he doesn't see his music as old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
"I like to portray the energy and passion of our times. It's very important
that my music sounds like music of the '90s," said the Dominican-born Camilo,
who opened five nights at Elario's on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Camilo has lived in New York for 11 years and says the urban experience infuses
his music with a certain intensity, also a degree of fun.
</P>
<P>
"I think jazz should be fun, not just philosophical or cerebral. When I think
of jazz, I think of the great smiles of Louis Armstrong and Dizzy Gillespie."
</P>
<P>
Growing up in Santo Domingo, Camilo was schooled as a classical pianist and
became the youngest member of his country's national symphony orchestra at 16.
But by then, he was already heading in other directions.
</P>
<P>
"They had two jazz shows on the radio when I was growing up, and I first heard
them when I was 14," Camilo said. "When I heard Art Tatum, that changed my
life. Up to that point, I thought that to play the instrument fully and with
spirit, you had to play classical music. Then all of a sudden, I hear this man
playing with an incredible feeling, rich harmonies and amazing control.
Immediately that attuned me to jazz."
</P>
<P>
Camilo's percussive attack has often been compared to that of pianist McCoy
Tyner, the former John Coltrane sideman whom Camilo listened to growing up. But
he names pianists Oscar Peterson, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett and Bill Evans
as additional influences -- he was especially taken with Evans' harmonic
structures, "which really come from classical music," he said.
</P>
<P>
Camilo has released two albums in Japan and three in the United States,
including the new "On the Other Hand." His first two U.S. projects both hit No.
1 on several jazz charts, and the newest has already become a favorite of
mainstream jazz radio stations. Camilo's music also gets airtime on light jazz
radio, he said, although his music isn't in the lineup at KIFM (98.1) in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
At Elario's, Camilo is appearing with bassist Michael Bowie, who has worked
with Dexter Gordon and Betty Carter, and young drummer Cliff Almond, 22, a
former San Diegan.
</P>
<P>
Just when you think you've got Brazilian guitarist Ricardo Silveira nailed
down, he throws another curve. "Amazon Secrets," his new album, has something
for everyone, from the Brazillian-sounding tropical title track, to upbeat
music with a funky bass backbeat, to sections which evoke a gamut of great
guitar memories from Wes Montgomery to Jimi Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
Silveira, who splits his time between Los Angeles and Rio de Janeiro, appears
at 2 p.m. Saturday as part of the "Chula Vista Harbor Days Festival and Tall
Ship Parade" at the Chula Vista Marina.
</P>
<P>
Also on the bill is saxophonist Ronnie Laws, whose eighth solo album, "True
Spirit," has just been released. Laws, who takes the stage at 3, didn't fare
well the last time he was booked into San Diego. His scheduled 1989 appearance
at Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay with brother Hubert, the flutist, was
canceled because of poor ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
To reach the Chula Vista Marina, take Interstate 5 south, exit at J Street,
head west and follow the flags.
</P>
<P>
With the 1989 album "Time Will Tell" on the verge of topping 100,000 in sales,
San Diego jazz band Fattburger has released "Come and Get It," the follow-up.
The group will host a record release party next Wednesday night at the
Catamaran Resort Hotel in Pacific Beach.
</P>
<P>
On "Time Will Tell," Fattburger was boosted by guests like saxman Gerald
Albright, but this time around they go it alone. Keyboardist Carl Evans Jr.
wrote five songs, and guitarist Steve Laury, two. All of the material is
original, except the band's version of Roberta Flack's "Feel Like Makin' Love."
</P>
<P>
According to Evans, Flack's song has already emerged as a radio favorite, and
he predicted that the "Pat Metheny-ish" tune "Almost an Angel," penned by
Laury, will also make radio waves.
</P>
<P>
Next month, the band will tour to support the new album, stopping in
Sacramento, Fresno, Oakland, Anchorage and Houston before heading to Florida.
</P>
<P>
There is no cover charge Wednesday night. The music starts at 8.
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: Saxophonist Najee is one of the most commercially successful light jazz
artists around. His first two albums, "Najee's Theme" and "Day by Day," both
sold more than 500,000 copies. His new album is called "Tokyo Blue." Najee
plays Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay next Wednesday night at 8. . . .
</P>
<P>
Guitarist Hank Easton and his Easton West Band beat out top locals Peter
Sprague, Mark Lessman, Fattburger and Aubrey Faye to win Best Jazz honors in
this year's Entertainer Music Awards, presented at the La Paloma Theatre in
Encinitas last week. . . .
</P>
<P>
Clarinetist Buddy DeFranco and vibraphonist Terry Gibbs team up Saturday night
at 8:30 on KPBS-TV's "Club Date" jazz program, repeating Monday afternoon at
1:30. . . .
</P>
<P>
Flutist Holly Hofmann plays the Palace Bar in the Horton Grand Hotel downtown
Friday and Saturday nights in a crack quartet including guitarist Peter
Sprague, bassist Bob Magnusson and drummer Tim McMahon. . . .
</P>
<P>
Tonight and Saturday night, Quartet Agape dishes up Afro-Cuban jazz at Croce's
in the Gaslamp Quarter downtown; Friday night, it's Latin jazz with Algo
Caliente, and Sunday, saxophonist Joe Marillo's jam session.

TRIP OF THE WEEK: HORSING AROUND IN THE DESERT
</P>

living in Laguna Beach.

PALM SPRINGS
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Riding in a golf cart isn't the only way to enjoy the outdoors in this desert
resort town.
</P>
<P>
Visitors can saddle up for leisurely horseback trips on trails that wind
through unspoiled landscape to America's most magnificent palm oases.
</P>
<P>
Although Palm Springs' rustic dude ranches have been replaced by golf courses
and luxurious hotels, Smoke Tree Stables still keeps a corral of horses near
the pristine Agua Caliente Indian canyons.
</P>
<P>
Smoke Tree is the last public stable in Palm Springs. Would-be cowboys and
cowgirls have been renting horses there since 1929, and city fathers recently
gave owner Rod Johnson permission to keep his stable open for at least 10 more
years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Horse Trails
</P>
<P>
The area has about 135 miles of horse trails that offer visitors close views of
desert plants and wildlife. Hourlong rides go through mostly dry Palm Canyon
Wash at the base of Smoke Tree Mountains.
</P>
<P>
But longer and more interesting outings lead to streams and shady palm groves
in remote Andreas, Murray and Palm canyons. You can stay in the saddle for two
or four hours on the canyon rides, all guided by wranglers from the stable.
</P>
<P>
To get to Smoke Tree from Los Angeles, drive east on Interstate 10 to the Palm
Springs turnoff, California 111.
</P>
<P>
Follow the highway (also called Palm Canyon Drive) south through town. Soon
after it swings east, turn right at Sunrise Way. Take La Verne Way and then go
left on Toledo Avenue to the stable entrance at No. 2500, where the street
meets Murray Canyon Drive.
</P>
<P>
(Don't turn in at Smoke Tree Ranch, a residential development.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Riders of All Ages
</P>
<P>
Smoke Tree Stables welcomes riders of all ages. Parents can ride with a small
child in the same saddle. Hours are 8 a.m. until dusk. One-hour rides are
offered on the hour for $15; no reservations required.
</P>
<P>
More popular are the two-hour trips to Andreas Canyon that depart at 8 a.m. and
10 a.m. and at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. They cost $33.50, including the equestrian
entry fee to the Indian reservation.
</P>
<P>
Depending on the experience and desire of the riders the horses will walk, trot
or lope along the trail at the command of the wrangler who guides the trip.
</P>
<P>
From the stable the path enters a sandy wash between Smoke Tree Mountain and a
flood-control dike bordering the Canyon Country Club golf course. Then it
narrows and crosses a couple of streams that carry the runoff of melted snow
from higher elevations before entering Agua Caliente tribal land.
</P>
<P>
After stopping at a booth to pay the admission fee, the wrangler leads horses
and riders through a landscape of palo verde trees, creosote bush, jumping
cholla and other cactus. Willow leaves rustle in the desert breeze and birds
flit from their hiding places at the sound of hoofs striking rocks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Into the Canyons
</P>
<P>
The trail twists toward a canyon of California fan palms, botanically named
Washingtonia filifera in honor of the first President. Many have survived for
several centuries, including some with blackened trunks from a fire in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The horses usually pause to drink from an icy stream that nourishes the oasis
of palms, cottonwoods, sycamores and thick undergrowth. There's not much time
to linger before heading back to the stable, but you may find Indian caves and
grinding rocks near the picnic tables.
</P>
<P>
On a four-hour horseback excursion to Murray Canyon, another oasis on Indian
land, riders can dismount for a bring-your-own picnic lunch among the palms. An
option is to forgo lunch and continue on a longer trail that circles back to
the stable.
</P>
<P>
The Murray Canyon trip must be arranged in advance and requires four or more
riders. It costs $63.50 each, including admission to the reservation. For the
same price, horsemen can mount up with a wrangler for a four-hour outing to
Palm Canyon, the area's largest palm oasis.
</P>
<P>
For more information on Palm Springs trail rides, call Smoke Tree Stables at
(619) 327-1372.
</P>
<P>
Before or after your equestrian adventure, take an even closer look at desert
plant life by visiting Moorten Botanical Garden. This is the 50th anniversary
of a remarkable collection of desert plants that has grown to 3,000 varieties.
</P>
<P>
From the stables, follow Murray Canyon Road west to South Palm Canyon Drive,
then turn right (north) to No. 1701.
</P>
<P>
Pat Moorten and her late husband, known as Cactus Slim, established the garden
around their home as a result of botanical and geological expeditions that
began in the 1930s. They collected plants locally, in Mexico and overseas.
</P>
<P>
A walk around the grounds is like a world tour, with specimens from a Baja
boojum to an African thorn tree. Especially fascinating in the enclosed
"cactarium" are plants with names such as "Snowball," "Old Man's Whiskers,"
"Mink Tail" and "Devil's Fingers."
</P>
<P>
The thick vegetation has turned the property into a bird sanctuary, especially
for about 200 mourning doves. Also look for the white temple doves from Egypt
that are part of wedding ceremonies held frequently at the garden.
</P>
<P>
Pat and her son, Clark, welcome visitors every day. Admission costs $1.50 and
includes a map for an informal tour of the grounds. The garden opens at 9 a.m.,
Sundays at 10 a.m. Some of the Moorten's home-raised cactus plants are for
sale.
</P>
<P>
Two blocks north is California 111, which you can rejoin to reach Interstate 10
for the trip back to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Round trip from Los Angeles to Palm Springs is 230 miles.

DIEGO'S LOFT MAY CUT ITS LOSSES AND DROP JAZZ

Saturday night's shows by vibraphonist Gary Burton at Diego's Loft in Pacific
Beach could mark the end of jazz at the intimate, 78-seat club.
</P>
<P>
The owners lost more than $400 last weekend, when jazz guitarist Mundell Lowe
played Friday and Saturday nights, co-owner Ernest Casco said. The club
collected $264 at the door for both nights -- not nearly enough to pay the
musicians and operating expenses, said Casco, one of three owners.
</P>
<P>
So, for the next few weeks, Diego's Loft will be closed while the owners
consider options.
</P>
<P>
Casco didn't rule out jazz in the future, but he said he is also considering
lighter jazz or non-jazz acts. He said the room is too small for many electric
jazz bands.
</P>
<P>
On Monday morning, the owners told San Diego jazz musician Holly Hofmann, who
books Diego's jazz acts, that the club could afford to continue jazz only if
the musicians would play for the door proceeds instead of a guaranteed fee,
Hofmann said.
</P>
<P>
"I contacted the musicians on my November and December schedule, and they said
forget it," Hofmann said. "Nobody of that caliber is going to do that."
</P>
<P>
Peter Sprague, Algo Caliente, Joe Marillo, Mike Wofford, Harry Pickens and
Jimmy and Jeannie Cheatham, all San Diegans, were among the acts Hofmann had
tentatively lined up.
</P>
<P>
Since opening in July 1988 as an addition to the popular Diego's Mexican
restaurant and Club Diego's disco, the jazz room has struggled to draw
consistent crowds, despite presenting such top players as Slide Hampton, Bill
Watrous, Buddy Collette, Spike Robinson, James Zollar, Richie Cole, Don Menza
and Sam Most.
</P>
<P>
"I have been supportive, but I lost thousands and thousands of dollars," Casco
said, adding that the owners spent about $200,000 to create the room, with a
fireplace and excellent acoustics.
</P>
<P>
At first the club charged no cover and had a two-drink minimum. A $5 cover was
added last summer, and for a time that seemed to reduce attendance, but Hofmann
said she thought the club had turned a corner in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was not the nationally known jazz acts that drew the best
crowds. According to Casco, the biggest-grossing performances were by the
Cheathams and guitarist Sprague with vocalist Kevyn Lettau.
</P>
<P>
Casco said he was bothered that the jazz players wanted to keep the room purely
mainstream jazz, instead of mixing in lighter contemporary jazz or other music.
</P>
<P>
Rob Hagey, director of the San Diego Jazz Festival, which co-presented Burton
with Diego's, said he doubts that jazz players will work for the door but the
jazz festival might present shows at its own risk there. Diego's guaranteed
Burton's fee for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's shows are at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
 Without Diego's Loft, Elario's in La Jolla is the only local jazz club
consistently booking national performers.

CRAWFORD, MCGRIFF JAZZ UP THEIR CAREERS AS SOUL MATES

<P>
When David (Fathead) Newman had his horns stolen, Hank Crawford and Jimmy
McGriff became a team.
</P>
<P>
How did a horn theft lead to a new musical partnership? Saxman Crawford and
blues organist McGriff, who Wednesday opened a two-week stay at Elario's in La
Jolla, first played together in Greenwich Village at a benefit three years ago
to help Newman replace his instruments.
</P>
<P>
"They played a set that just took the roof off the place," remembers Maxine
Harvard, who manages both musicians. "Being the promoter/P.R. type I am, I
said, 'I can't let this go.' " Harvard booked them together at the Apollo
Theatre, and the duo clicked again.
</P>
<P>
Both musicians record for Fantasy/Milestone, and, soon after the Apollo date,
Ralph Kaffel, the company's president, asked them to do an album together.
</P>
<P>
"Soul Survivors" was released in 1987. Since then, the pair have done two more
albums, with the latest, "On the Blue Side," scheduled for January release.
</P>
<P>
McGriff's swinging work on Hammond B-3 organ provides the perfect foil for
Crawford's funk/blues sax. Crawford might not want to hear it, but McGriff
lends the music a bluesy fire lacking on some of Crawford's solo projects.
</P>
<P>
Though both men are blues players at heart, they also have substantial
background in jazz.
</P>
<P>
"I can go either way," Crawford said. "Most people classify me as R&amp;B or
blues, but I cut my roots on be-bop, straight-ahead. I'm more comfortable with
an R&amp;B, blues sound. My approach to horn is actually vocal, a singing,
melodic sound."
</P>
<P>
As a youngster, Crawford sang and played piano in church. One of his first jobs
was backing Ray Charles. He took up alto sax in high school, listening to
Charlie Parker, Louis Jordan, Earl Bostic and Johnny Hodges.
</P>
<P>
Crawford left Charles to record several albums of his own in the '60s, and
spent the '70s having his sound uncomfortably molded to fit the light, fusion
mold then in vogue at the CTI label. In 1983, he moved to Milestone and
returned to his grittier style, and he has recorded regularly with a band
including Newman and Dr. John since then.
</P>
<P>
McGriff grew up listening to jazz players such as Archie Shepp and Reggie
Workman, who lived in his Philadelphia neighborhood. He started on drums, vibes
and piano, but, when he switched to organ, Jimmy Smith, Richard (Groove) Holmes
and Milt Buckner became important influences. His first hit was an arrangement
of Charles' "I've Got a Woman," which reached No. 5 on Billboard's R&amp;B
chart in 1962.
</P>
<P>
Both Crawford and McGriff have independent careers and spend about half their
time playing or recording with each other.
</P>
<P>
At Elario's, Crawford and McGriff will be backed by drummer John Guerin and
guitarist Bob Devos.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the swan song sounded for jazz at Diego's Loft in Pacific Beach.
This week, it's more like "Happy Days are Hear Again."
</P>
<P>
Local jazz aficionado and occasional promoter Bob Geib reports that some local
musicians have reduced their fees to keep the club alive. This Friday night,
Geib has lined up saxophonists Rod Cradit and Gary Lefebvre, followed by the
spicy Latin jazz sounds of Algo Caliente Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Sunday afternoon in the larger disco room behind Diego's restaurant,
clarinetist Bobby Gordon and trumpeter John Best work out with their quartet
from 2 to 4:30, with special guest Mike Wofford on piano.
</P>
<P>
The cost for all shows is $5. Those who have a Diego's Loft VIP card get in for
half price Fridays and Saturdays. Leave your name and address at the door, and
they will mail you one.
</P>
<P>
Geib expects jazz to continue at the club for the foreseeable future, but with
more emphasis on local acts than the nationally known performers featured
before the owners temporarily shut down to curb their losses.
</P>
<P>
KPBS-TV (Channel 15) kicks off a new season of "Club Date" jazz programs Friday
night at 10:30, with a show featuring Hank Crawford and Jimmy McGriff. It airs
again Sunday at 2:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
KPBS is getting a jump on its national sisters. Most public television stations
will begin airing the new group of six shows next spring or summer.
</P>
<P>
Heading into its second year, the show is gaining a following and improving in
technical quality, according to producer Paul Marshall.
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 100 public television stations across the country aired
"Club Date." For 1989, there are six new programs featuring guitarist Joe Pass,
trumpeter Harry (Sweets) Edison, Crawford and McGriff, singers Mose Allison and
Jimmy Witherspoon, and flugelhorn player Art Farmer with saxophonist Clifford
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Sound for this season's shows was recorded on an eight-track machine, so the
instrumental mix could be polished after the live studio session. Programs are
broadcast in stereo.
</P>
<P>
Elario's continues as the show's co-sponsor, with the club's Steve Satkowski
serving as associate producer. Marshall said each show costs more than $10,000
to produce; he would like to find a corporate sponsor to pay for programs
featuring such jazz legends as Ella Fitzgerald and Dizzy Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: A clip from a "Club Date" featuring Jimmy Witherspoon may be used when

MORNING BRIEFING: DIKEMBE MUTOMBO: IT IS A NAME WITH A BIG FUTURE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In years to come, he might be known as Air Zaire or the Kinshasa Kid.
</P>
<P>
For now, he is known as Dikembe Mutombo.
</P>
<P>
Remember the name.
</P>
<P>
By April, he could be wearing a National Collegiate Athletic Assn. championship
watch. By 1991, he could be wearing three.
</P>
<P>
That's how highly regarded Georgetown's 7-foot-2 sophomore is.
</P>
<P>
After the Hoyas' title-game victory over Syracuse in the Big East Conference
tournament, Newsday's Steve Jacobson overheared Mutombo joyously repeating: "I
know we going to the Final Four. I know we going to the Final Four. I know we
going to the Final Four."
</P>
<P>
Up popped a radio reporter, who thrust a microphone in Mutombo's face. "So,
you're going to the Final Four?" the reporter asked.
</P>
<P>
Mutombo was taken aback.
</P>
<P>
"I hope so," he said.
</P>
<P>
More Mutombo: Mike Saylor, an assistant coach at Indiana State, made a
concerted effort to recruit Mutombo.
</P>
<P>
"In the Missouri Valley Conference, we have a lot of 6-6 centers," Saylor told
Steve Berkowitz of the Washington Post. "I knew this guy could be a
program-changer for us."
</P>
<P>
But Georgetown got its man, and the loss still hurts Saylor.
</P>
<P>
"It took me weeks to get over it," he said. "Even now, I have trouble watching
him play on television. . . . Dikembe will become an NBA player. It's just a
matter of time."
</P>
<P>
Trivia: Who are Lenard Benjamin, Jacques Wilkins and Peter Tripucka?
</P>
<P>
That Padre matter: No word yet from the Central California town of Lindsay,
where school administrators, parents and community leaders are wondering what,
if anything, to do about Steve Garvey Junior High School.
</P>
<P>
There's nothing wrong with the school, it's just that in light of recent
events, whenever its name is mentioned, there's a, uh, pregnant pause in the
conversation.
</P>
<P>
The campus, with a student body of 370, was renamed in Garvey's honor in 1977.
It was previously named after Abraham Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
"There's no discussion of changing the name (of the school) right now," said
Bob Mohr, the school district superintendent "That doesn't mean that what
(Garvey) is accused of in the press is what we are holding up as a guideline in
our instructional programs."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of bed: Boston Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman, a substitute in the
team's radio booth recently, commented on a Wade Boggs single by saying, "That
guy could hit falling out of bed."
</P>
<P>
Perhaps not the best choice of words, eh, Lou?
</P>
<P>
The result was on ice: The New Jersey Devils were leading the New York
Islanders, 2-1, halfway through the third period last Saturday night. That they
would end up losing, 3-2, in overtime, should have been obvious to anyone.
</P>
<P>
Reason? The Devils had won just once in 41 previous regular-season visits to
the Nassau Coliseum since joining the NHL as the Kansas City Scouts in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Now they're 1 for 42.
</P>
<P>
Design flaws?The following excerpts are from a press release announcing the
opening of a new betting facility at Caliente Race Track in Tijuana:
</P>
<P>
"Features include 100 private tables with lamps for one person . . . "
</P>
<P>
The 99 others will have to bet on the dark horses, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
And later, these two consecutive sentences:
</P>
<P>
"It has 900 upholstered chairs. 'It can seat 3,000 people,' Hernandez said."
</P>
<P>
What, sitting three to a chair?
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: The three are more recognizable as Benoit Benjamin, Dominique
Wilkins and Kelly Tripucka, but Lenard, Jacques and Peter are their real first
names.
</P>

Quotebook: Syracuse basketball Coach Jim Boeheim after the loss to the Hoyas in
the Big East title game: "I personally rated Georgetown first or second in the
country all year long. But I don't know why I ever thought they were second. I
must have temporarily lost my mind."

<LEADPARA>  'EEEUUUWW! Poor baby goat!" squealed Garden Editor Joan Jackson, when I told
her I was going to make goat chili for our annual Halloween chili cook-off.;
A typically irrational reaction. Luckily, we can get our goat -- which tastes
somewhere between mutton and veal, depending on how old the animal is -- in
more than a few places in San Jose.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Birria is Mexican goat stew, sold in restaurants called, appropriately,
birrierias. At Birrieria Mexico, the birria ($6.75) comes filled to the brim
with irregular hunks of goat meat bobbing in a rust brown, mildly spicy broth.
If you don't mind the grease, dunk steaming, handmade (you can hear the "pat,
pat" in the back kitchen) tortillas in it, or make a taco seasoned with the
chopped onion and cilantro provided.;   Refried beans are excellent and
there's rice too if you have room. No Coke or Pepsi but lots of Mexican fruit
sodas. Try the tamarind.;      Birrieria Mexico, 693 N. 13th St., San Jose;
(408) 947-0878.; (hbox);      Baja Cactus isn't strictly a birrieria, but it
does serve goat every day. The birria ($6.95) is much less greasy here. The
meat has broken down after long, slow cooking to create a delicious, thick
gravy that's liberally spiced with chili peppers. There are the usual fixings
plus chips and muy caliente salsa to start. The family atmosphere is much
brighter and more upbeat than the somewhat dreary Birrieria Mexico.;      Baja
Cactus, 338 S. Main St., Milpitas; (408) 263-9455.; (hbox);      Here's my
recipe for goat chili. You can get goat meat at the following San Jose
markets: Super Mercados Mexico, 1098 Park Ave. (at Race), (408) 297-5659, and
860 White Road, (408) 259-8430; and Halal Meats, 1538 S. Saratoga-Sunnyvale
Road, (408) 865-1222.; GOAT CHILI; 5 pounds goat stew meat on the bone; 2
medium onions, chopped; 2 jalapeno peppers, minced; 2 tablespoons olive oil; 2
each, Anaheim and pasilla peppers, roasted, peeled and chopped; 1 1/2  to 2
tablespoons cumin, toasted in a skillet and ground; 2 teaspoons Mexican
oregano; 2 cans chicken broth; 2 1-pound cans black beans, rinsed thoroughly;
Salt and pepper to taste;  Remove as much of the gristle and fat from the goat
as possible and roast the meat on a rack in the oven at 400 degrees until well
browned all over, about 20 minutes. Remove. When cool enough to handle, cut
meat into bite-size cubes. Meanwhile, saute onions and jalapenos in olive oil
in a Dutch oven until soft. Add meat and remaining ingredients except black
beans, salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer and put into a 350-oven 1 hour. Add
beans, season with salt and pepper and cook another hour or until meat is
tender. Adjust seasoning. Serves 6 to 8.  </TEXT>

JIM MURRAY: WHITTINGHAM IS QUIETLY TOUTING SUNDAY SILENCE
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jim Murray
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charlie Whittingham has been training race horses as far back as he, or anyone
else, can remember. He can't tell you what Man o' War was like, but he saw Phar
Lap.
</P>
<P>
He started out in the days when racing was legal in only a few places on this
continent and he got his early training around the barns and walking rings of
Caliente where in those anything-goes days some trainers used to put heroin on
the tongues of horses to get their attention. "I don't know if it made them run
faster but it improved their disposition some," Charlie recalls.
</P>
<P>
Not much a horse -- or horseman -- does, surprises Charlie. Whatever it is,
chances are he has seen it before. He stares at the world with these bright
blue eyes that always seem to be looking at something no one else can see.
</P>
<P>
Charlie gypsied around the country with the best of them in the days when
racing would drop its tack wherever the politicians or the Bible Belters would
let it. He learned how to get a horse and a meeting ready at the same time
under some of the legendary racetrackers of the day -- Senor Horatio Luro, for
example. He kept a low profile. Charlie talked just more than a horse. He was
part of that long line of horsemen who worked their colts in the dark so the
clockers wouldn't be able to get a good look -- and a time -- on them.
</P>
<P>
They called him "The Bald Eagle" around a track. Charlie lost his hair a long
time ago. It fell out when he contracted malaria on a landing with the 2nd
Marines on Guadalcanal in 1943. Charlie doesn't want any medals. "It might have
fell out anyway," he shrugs. "There was baldness on my mother's side." Charlie
just shaved it all off and got on with it. He always wore a hat anyway.
</P>
<P>
Charlie was as restless as a 2-year-old in his first gate. He always seemed
ill-at-ease away from shed row. He tried a vacation in the Bahamas once but it
was too far from the action. He prowls a race track like a hungry cat.
</P>
<P>
Charlie didn't spread himself thin like other trainers. He didn't keep a string
in New York, Florida, the Midwest or the bayous. He had his own wheel,
California, and he rolled nothing but winners.
</P>
<P>
Charlie didn't win the most races of any trainer on the tracks, just the
richest. He reeled off Santa Anita Handicaps (seven), Hollywood Gold Cups
(eight), and more stake races (543) and more hundred-thousand-dollar races
(206) than any trainer in history. If you brought your horse west of the
Tehachapis, you had Charlie's horses to beat.
</P>
<P>
But, if there was one flaw in Charlie's career, one blind spot in his outlook,
it was the Kentucky Derby. Charlie thought it was just another horse race. A
sucker bet, actually. It was too early in the year, too far away, too long. It
used up your horse. Charlie would rather save him for later in the year when
the purses were grander and the races easier. Anyway, California horses were
betting into a pat hand. Racing on harder tracks against easier company, they
would look like rubes in a subway rush when they got in the Kentucky field.
</P>
<P>
And, then, Charlie won one.
</P>
<P>
It happened three years ago. Charlie finally had a horse who looked as if he
wouldn't faint at the head of the stretch in Louisville.
</P>
<P>
Ferdinand never put anybody in mind of Phar Lap. He had five races as a
2-year-old and won only one of them. But he was out of the money in only one of
them. Charlie liked him. He was a puncher. "This horse will win the Kentucky
Derby," he told the rider, Bill Shoemaker, at Del Mar when Ferdinand was a
2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
So, he went back to Kentucky, a 73-year-old trainer with a 3-year-old horse and
a 54-year-old rider, and the press couldn't believe their good luck. They
dubbed the entry "The Sunshine Boys" and pulled all the stops. It was a
scenario right out of Disney. All you needed was Walter Brennan and a
harmonica. The last roundup.
</P>
<P>
The hardboots were less sentimental than the rest of the world. They let the
horse and the Shoe -- and Whittingham -- get away at 17-1. They weren't into
any corny Hollywood endings.
</P>
<P>
Big mistake.
</P>
<P>
But, if Charlie wasn't shocked at the outcome of the race, he was overwhelmed
at the reaction of the rest of the country. Here was a man who had won 2,000
races and the public reacted as if it were his first.
</P>
<P>
Charlie was on crack-of-dawn television shows, magazine covers, banquet daises.
People gave him parties. He got fan letters. So did the horse.
</P>
<P>
Charlie had thought he was a celebrity. Now, he found out what celebrity was.
He thought he had just won another Grade 1 stakes. They say around the race
tracks, if you go to heaven and tell St. Peter you're a horse trainer or a race
car driver, he frowns and consults a list. If you say you won the Kentucky
Derby or the Indy 500, he says "Go right in!"
</P>
<P>
Charlie had gone back to Louisville previously with a couple of no-chance colts
belonging to the late Liz Whitney, who always overestimated her racers. Gone
Fishin' and Diving Comedy ran down the track. As Charlie could have told her.
</P>
<P>
Charlie still won't go back to Louisville with some overblown plating horse
with delusions of grandeur. But, this year, he's getting that look in the eye
again. Charlie has a colt by Halo, the sire who already has a Kentucky Derby
winner in his pedigree. The 3-year-old Sunday Silence looks to Charlie as if he
can run some.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence has not been breaking clocks. But, neither did Ferdinand. Sunday
Silence has run five times and never been worse than second. Charlie put him in
against the wonder colt, Houston, who is supposed to be able to do everything
but talk, and Sunday Silence was all over the race track in the stretch and
still lost only by a head. "He doesn't like to get beat," grins Charlie.
</P>
<P>
Charlie likes that in a horse.
</P>
<P>
The sporting press won't get The Sunshine Boys Part II if Sunday Silence gets
to Louisville. Patrick Valenzuela, who has ridden Sunday Silence in all three
of his wins, is just a little bit older than the horse.
</P>
<P>
Can Charlie get his second Kentucky Derby? Or, his first Preakness or Belmont?
</P>
<P>
It first hinges on the Santa Anita Derby April 8. Whether Houston comes West
for it or not, Sunday Silence must do well in the Derby here (Ferdinand was
third). You get a good clue into Charlie's orientation when you know that, of
the 2,140 races he has won, only one is a Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
It isn't that Charlie wants to get stopped for his autograph or wants to have
people know him on sight. Charlie, no social butterfly, is always where
everybody already knows him. And, if you're ever looking for him, try the
winners' circle.

The following are summaries of recent Times restaurant reviews.
</P>
<P>
Pinnacle Peak, 9100 Trask Ave., Garden Grove. (714) 892-7311. Open Mondays
through Fridays 5 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., weekends till 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Crazy Horse Steak House, 1580 Brookhollow Dr., Santa Ana. (714) 549-1512. Open
Mondays through Fridays 11 a.m. to 2 a.m., Saturdays and Sundays 5 p.m. to 2
a.m.
</P>
<P>
While everyone else is busy disavowing addiction to good steak, sneak off to
one of these places. Leave the tie at home when you visit Pinnacle Peak;
someone will sneak up on you and cut it off. Honest. The restaurant's trail
boss steak, cooked over an open flame, is a char-broiled monster, a great value
at $9.95. The Crazy Horse is a bit longer on atmosphere but, apart from the
high-grade beef, it's run-of-the-mill. Many of the side dishes have been
frozen, and the whole place has a packaged feel about it.
</P>
<P>
Garduno's Ristorante Italiano, 298 E. 17th St., Costa Mesa. (714) 645-5505.
Open Mondays through Thursdays 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m.; Fridays till 10 p.m.,
Saturdays noon to 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Garduno's may be the quintessential Italian sidewalk cafe-except the sidewalk
is missing. Mark and Julie Garduno, an engaging young couple, run the place as
if it was a small family room, serving fresh, home-cooked fare that often
delights. Standout dishes include a killer carbonara loaded with fresh peas,
pancetta and sauteed mushrooms; and a fabulous fusilli, twirly pasta spirals in
a chunky tomato sauce with big pieces of homemade sausage. The regular menu has
all the favorites, the cappuccino is frothy, and there are wonderful creamy
cheesecakes to boot.
</P>
<P>
California Wok, 4466 Cerritos Ave., Los Alamitos. (714) 527-0226. Open Mondays
through Thursdays 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Fridays and Saturdays till 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Eat health conscious, pan-Asian food in this spotless little gem, owned and
operated by a Thai microbiologist who is a gem herself (her name, Baiyok, means
jade leaf.) Chinese dishes here are excellent, prepared with pure soy oil.
Especially good are vegetarian egg rolls, and stir fried chicken in an edible
basket of straw potato. Thai dishes are equally fine. Nam sod is fiery ground
pork with chili. Pad Thai are fried flat noodles. And tod mun plar, rubbery
fish cakes with mint and cilantro, are wonderful.
</P>
<P>
The Cellar at Villa Del Sol, 305 N. Harbor Blvd., Fullerton. (714) 525-5682.
Open Tuesdays through Saturdays 6 to 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The Cellar is one of those "occasion restaurants" in the grand manner; whatever
the kitchen lacks in imagination is made up for handsomely by quality and
consistency. Pass on the ready-made items like smoked salmon, caviar and the
various salads. They miss the point. The chef here can cook. See that he does.
Best are lamb, pheasant, veal Florentine and the ethereal desserts. The
souffles, naturally, are perfect.
</P>
<P>
Far Pavilions, 1520 W. Coast Highway, Newport Beach. (714) 548-7167. Open seven
days, 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., 5 to 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
 Elegant, beachfront Indian dining. Far Pavilions has a surfeit of specialties
hard to find in other local restaurants: minced chicken balls in a spicy tomato
puree; bhindi masala, a.k.a. curried okra; Bihari kabab, a saucy chicken dish
from north central India. Some flavors run together here, but you can avoid
that problem by sandwiching dishes in the fine tandoori breads from the
restaurant's clay oven. Meats from the same oven are so good they should be
eaten bareheaded, kneeling.
</P>
<P>
Caliente, 1910 Main St., Irvine. (714) 975-1220. Open seven days, 11 a.m. to 10
p.m., to 11 on weekends.
</P>
<P>
Caliente is Spanish for hot, and that is exactly what this stylish new
restaurant is. It's the latest jewel in the El Torito crown, and its modest
adobe exterior conceals a stunning design -- a faint red, '80s-chic motif
complete with dramatic lighting, an open kitchen, and a comal, the high-tech
version of a stone tortilla cooker. The restaurant smokes its own meats, and
you can wash them down with premium margaritas made from vintage tequila.
Desserts, such as burnt cream and apple crisp, are wonderful.
</P>
<P>
Rutabegorz, 211 N. Pomona Ave., Fullerton (714) 738-9339 and 158 W. Main St.,
Tustin (714) 731-9807. Open seven days, 11 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
 The Greenery Natural Kitchen, 119 E. Commonwealth Ave., Fullerton (714)
870-0981 and 323 S. Magnolia Ave., Anaheim (714) 761-8103. Open Monday through
Fridays, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., Saturdays 10 to 5.
</P>
<P>
Rutabegorz in Fullerton looks as if it belongs on a college campus; the food
they serve does too. Best avoid the frozen poultry casseroles in favor of the
meatless dishes like stuffed squash or veggie lasagna. Desserts like carrot
cake and apple pie are reminiscent of a church bake sale.
</P>
<P>
The Greenery is a modest, unadorned storefront restaurant with homey,
health-conscious fare. Best dishes are the lentil burrito, with guacamole, and
the unburger, made from ground nuts and brown rice.
</P>
<P>
Both restaurants are inexpensive, with few dishes over $5.
</P>
<P>
Five Feet, 328 Glenneyre St., Laguna Beach. (714) 497-4955. Open Mondays
through Thursdays 5 to 10 p.m., to 11 Fridays through Sundays.
</P>
<P>
Owner Michael Kang has some of the most compelling art around decorating this
restaurant's somber, postmodern walls, and he serves plates of food very nearly
as artful. Dishes of pot stickers or steamed dumpling are no better than you
would get in any Chinese restaurant, but the eclectic lamb, scallop, and
catfish entrees demonstrate Kang's flair. The catfish is particularly fine.
</P>
<P>
Crocodile Cafe in the Brea Marketplace, 975 E. Birch St., Brea. (714) 529-CAFE.
Open seven days 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., to 12 on weekends.
</P>
<P>
Greg Smith is doing more than just promoting the new American cuisine; he's
making it into a populist movement at this small, laughably inexpensive cafe.
Enjoy wonderful hamburgers grilled over smoking embers of oak, wood-fired
pizzas with designer toppings, and trendy homemade pastas like fettucine with
roasted Pasilla chili and ancho-cream. Sit under the 30-foot vinyl crocodile
sipping boutique wines. You can bet your Beamer that this restaurant is a good
value.
</P>
<P>
Almagreb, 23700 El Toro Road, in the Saddleback Valley Plaza, El Toro. (714)
859-9393. Open Tuesdays through Sundays 6 to 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
 Almagreb, a Moroccan restaurant in El Toro, has one of the most dramatic
dining areas anywhere: clustered tent canopies among a maze of mirrors with an
almost mystical dimension. Meals are taken in the traditional style, with no
utensils, and are finger-licking good. Among the better offerings: b'stilla (a
sugar-dusted chicken pie), couscous (cracked semolina wheat in a savory
vegetable stew), and Tanya, belly dancer extraordinaire. The Arabic music
accompanying her is deafening.
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh, 5423 W. 1st St., Santa Ana. (714) 554-7260. Open weekdays 10 a.m.
to 10:30 p.m., weekends until 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Thien Thanh is more than just one of the area's best restaurants: It is a
crossroad of Vietnamese and American culture: The crowd is as diverse as the
menu. Cua rang muoi (cooked salted crab) and bo dam (garlic-centered beef) are
two dishes not to miss, but lighter appetites can indulge in more than 50
noodle dishes. While away the day listening to Asian pop music, gawking at the
New Wavers and sipping filter coffee and tropical freezes made from durian and
jackfruit.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: THE DIRTY DOZEN HOPES TO KEEP 'EM ON
THEIR FEET
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK SUTRO
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If you catch the Dirty Dozen Brass Band next Thursday night, Dec. 28, at the
Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach, don't expect to spend much time sitting.
</P>
<P>
The New Orleans-based band has taken the instrumentation of a New Orleans
marching band and brewed a tangy gumbo for the '80s and '90s: pulsing bass and
sousaphone, with fast-moving rhythms, synchronized horn parts and plenty of
improvisation slathered liberally on top.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not satisfied until people are on their feet," said trumpeter and band
leader Gregory Davis.
</P>
<P>
The year has been busy for the Dirty Dozen, which took its name from a New
Orleans club but only has eight members.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the band's new album "Voodoo," recorded in 1987, was finally
released on CBS Records after more than a year during which attorneys
negotiated a new contract for the group. Downbeat promptly accorded 4 1/2 of
five possible stars.
</P>
<P>
Financially, it was worth the wait; the band signed a six-record deal. But the
delay may have slowed their career in other ways.
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have name recognition, it helps to have records coming out,"
Davis said. "Then you have something for critics to talk about, and it gets you
out in the market and keeps you moving."
</P>
<P>
The band has been much in demand among musicians. Elvis Costello used them on
his last album, "Spike," and liked their work on the song "Stalin Malone" so
much he decided to leave off his vocals. He returns the favor by singing a tune
on the Dirty Dozen's new album, due for February release.
</P>
<P>
With rock stars such as David Byrne and Paul Simon warming audiences to the
possibilities of a variety of musical influences, the Dozen appears poised for
more success.
</P>
<P>
To its New Orleans roots -- including funeral marching bands, Louis Armstrong
and Sidney Bechet -- the band adds blues, be-bop, and improvisations ranging
from subtle twists of melody to unchained honking and screaming.
</P>
<P>
Although their eclectic sound is impossible to categorize, that's been a virtue
in the world of radio, according to Davis.
</P>
<P>
"Because we play a mixed bag of things, we're able to get on some of the blues
stations, some jazz formats, college radio.
</P>
<P>
"Lots of people still don't know what we do. They think they do, from pictures
or that scene in 'Live or Let Die,' the James Bond movie where we did a typical
New Orleans funeral scene. We have to overcome that. Call us what you want. We
play music you can dance to."
</P>
<P>
Five months ago, a group of San Diegans decided to form a serious salsa band.
Already, the 12-piece unit calling itself La Predilecta ("The Chosen One") has
drawn the attention of top Latin players. In recent weeks, the ensemble has
opened local shows for such spicemasters as Eddie Palmieri and Tito Puente.
</P>
<P>
This Saturday night, the group plays a dance benefit for La Casa de Puerto
Rico, a charitable organization that raised money for Puerto Rican hurricane
relief last October, helps feed the homeless and gives scholarships to needy
students, primarily of Puerto Rican background.
</P>
<P>
Martin W. Padilla, La Predilecta's lead singer and founder, says the music is
aimed at making people dance. The band's repertoire includes about a dozen
original tunes, plus several fresh Latin arrangements of jazz standards.
</P>
<P>
Admission to the Christmas dance at the downtown Marriott Hotel, which begins
at 8 p.m., is $10 in advance, $12 at the door. For information, call 461-6148.
</P>
<P>
Now that Liberace's gone, who will carry his flamboyant torch? One possibility
is San Diego pianist Peter Robberecht, who brings back memories of glittery
suits and giant candelabras.
</P>
<P>
"The way to define what I'm after is, I will be a New Age Liberace," said
Robberecht, who hopes to get a career break with some of his slow, dreamy demo
tapes, though his true love is cutting loose on stage.

Robberecht starts his audiences out low-key. But, halfway through his set, he
kicks away the piano bench, dons dark glasses and launches into his version of
Jerry Lee Lewis' "Great Balls of Fire." The number peaks when Robberecht
executes his famous "bun run," a cheeky slide across the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
"That gets a hoot and holler," Robberecht said. "You spend your life trying to
become a major artist, then you slide your butt across the keys and people go
crazy."
</P>
<P>
Despite traces of Liberace, Barry Manilow and Elton John in Robberecht, his
musical background is classical. His mother plays classical piano, and
Robberecht cut his chops on Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart and such modern pianists
as Van Cliburn and Vladimir Horowitz.
</P>
<P>
Robberecht plays happy hours Wednesday through Saturday at the Catamaran, and
will also be on the night shift Fridays and Saturdays through January.

SHOT GUN SCOTT 'CALDER HORSE' IN BLUE GRASS WITH A CHANCE AT WINNING KENTUCKY
DERBY
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
When a Florida trainer has what's known as a Calder horse, he's not receiving a
compliment. It's not as denigrating as having a Caliente horse, but it's in the
same rhetorical ballpark.
</P>
<P>
Shot Gun Scott is the Calder horse in Saturday's Blue Grass Stakes at
Keeneland, the Calder horse with a chance of winning the Kentucky Derby at
Churchill Downs on May 5.
</P>
<P>
Since it opened 19 years ago, Calder has always been the track from the wrong
side of the tracks on the South Florida racing circuit. Gulfstream Park and
Hialeah were the big leagues, Calder was triple-A. Even in recent years, when
Hialeah's fortunes dipped to the point where the track couldn't even finish the
season this winter, Calder was still a distant No. 3.
</P>
<P>
"The thing people forget is that when horses come over here to run, they're
still from over there," said a handicapper at Gulfstream a couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Terry Meyocks, the racing secretary at Calder, defends his track. Meyocks says
Calder has kept figures over the last six years, and the track's horses have
won a respectable 42% of the time they've run during the mid-winter dates at
the two other tracks.
</P>
<P>
And in 1985, a horse from "over there" really did all right. Calder-based Spend
a Buck won the Kentucky Derby and was voted horse of the year.
</P>
<P>
Now, Shot Gun Scott is another Calder horse who seems to belong. He is 5-1 on
the morning line in the $250,000 Blue Grass, behind odds-on Summer Squall and
Unbridled, and Shot Gun Scott has finished ahead of Unbridled, the Florida
Derby winner, three times.
</P>
<P>
Shot Gun Scott is probably an afterthought for the pundits plotting this year's
Kentucky Derby because, besides being a Calder horse, he doesn't run very often
and his owners and trainer have tended to downplay his ability.
</P>
<P>
And the 3-year-old colt wasn't high on the list of many jockeys at Gulfstream.
</P>
<P>
Finally, one of the horse's owners, Jean Friedberg, sent Dave Penna over to the
barn. Penna worked the horse once, made a deal with Sarazin and won the
Fountain of Youth. Penna will be aboard again Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Before the Fountain of Youth, Shot Gun Scott had won four of seven starts at
Calder and in his only race away from that track, finished fourth in the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile last November at Gulfstream.
</P>
<P>
Shot Gun Scott earned $70,000 in the Breeders' Cup, and Meyocks ought to get a
commission, because he was responsible for the horse's running. The day before
payments were needed to keep horses eligible for the Breeders' Cup, Shot Gun
Scott won the Florida Stallion Stakes, beating Unbridled by 2 3/4 lengths.
</P>
<P>
"We weren't even thinking about the Breeders' Cup," said Sarazin, 44, a
soft-spoken former Chicagoan. "Meyocks called and said we might just as well
give it a try. We only had about 12 hours to make up our minds before the money
was due."
</P>
<P>
If Penna should go all the way to the Kentucky Derby with Shot Gun Scott, it
will be a pay-back of sorts for what befell the 31-year-old Canadian-based
jockey with Sunny's Halo and Regal Classic. Penna rode Sunny's Halo eight times
as a 2-year-old, winning five races, but Eddie Delahoussaye was on the horse's
back the day he won the Derby in 1983. In 1988, Regal Classic, another horse
that Penna had gotten familiar with the year before, was ridden by Laffit
Pincay to fifth place in the Derby.
</P>
<P>
Penna has never ridden in a Derby.
</P>
<P>
"I've ridden a lot of nice horses and I'm excited to be on this one," he said.
"He's beaten all the big horses in Florida. He's very consistent and he always
runs hard. Maybe he'll continue to do that and prove the best of them all --
just because he's trying."
</P>
<P>
One horse that Shot Gun Scott didn't beat in Florida is Summer Squall, who ran
just one race down there. Only Housebuster has beaten Summer Squall, who if the
Derby were run today would be the second choice behind Santa Anita Derby winner
Mister Frisky, according to Keeneland-Churchill Downs line maker Mike
Battaglia.
</P>
<P>
After running seven times as a 2-year-old, Shot Gun Scott has run only twice
this year, in the Tropical Park Derby and the Fountain of Youth.
</P>
<P>
His owners -- Friedberg and Scott Hamilton, both native Kentuckians -- were
pointing for Keeneland, where they could run Shot Gun Scott before many of
their friends.
</P>
<P>
Even though the Blue Grass will provide the best group of opponents Shot Gun
Scott has faced, Sarazin is not reluctant to be here.
</P>
<P>
"We have got to find out some day about how good this horse is," he said. "He
has to run a good race, and probably finish in the first three, to go on to the
Derby. The timing of the race is right. This horse does better if his races
aren't run close together."
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, who drew inside for his victory in the Jim Beam at Turfway Park
on March 31, has the No. 1 post in the 1 1/8-mile Blue Grass, with Pat Day
riding. Outside them, in order, are Top Snob, with Jerry Bailey riding;
Iskandar Elakbar, Richard Migliore; Shot Gun Scott, Dave Penna; Unbridled,
Craig Perret; Land Rush, Angel Cordero, and Slew of Angels, Ricardo Lopez. All
will carry 121 pounds.

FROM DESERT TO CANYONS ON THE SANTA ROSA TRAIL

<TEXT>
<P>
On a rough dirt road in canyonlands in the Santa Rosa Mountains, above
Coachella Valley desert communities, Desert Off Road Adventures offers Jeep
safaris.
</P>
<P>
The three-hour safaris were tested beginning last March, hauling guests of the
new Ritz-Carlton Rancho Mirage hotel. Now the safaris are available to anyone.
</P>
<P>
From the lower desert, the safari route bounces, curves and dips into canyons
where the vistas are the same as they were for the Cahuilla Indians in earlier
times.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, desert entrepreneur Michael Dunn of Rancho Mirage bulldozed
a dirt road with the hope that it would lead to a mountainside hotel. The hotel
never materialized and the dirt road remained Dunn's Road, which he often had
to restore after canyon floods.
</P>
<P>
When the Ritz-Carlton first opened on 24-acres last March, guests were welcomed
by two, bronze, bighorn sheep, which roam beside a natural stone fountain.
</P>
<P>
Guest rooms had valley and mountain views, art and antiques, and marble
bathrooms. Dining was under crystal chandeliers. A 10-court tennis club was
perched above its own canyon.
</P>
<P>
Since the hotel doesn't have it own links, guests were transported to nearby
desert golf courses. Enter a Seattle transplant named Mary Thomas, who left her
marketing job at the Ritz-Carlton and joined Bruce Mercey in a partnership that
expanded Mercey's just-born desert safari company to include five customized
Jeep Scramblers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Private Road
</P>
<P>
We began our safari from the Ritz-Carlton. After a short drive through
Cathedral City our driver turned off Cathedral Canyon Road and unlocked the
gate to the private Dunn Road.
</P>
<P>
The gleaming four-wheel-drive Jeep had a rollbar, a fire extinguisher, a
first-aid kit and seat belts for the half-a-dozen passengers facing each other
on the two padded benches.
</P>
<P>
Dunn's dirt road is an adventure in itself -- rocky, curving sharply, dropping
abruptly down a bank steep enough to be a ski run, then scrambling up again.
</P>
<P>
The driver was an expert. We soon braced automatically as spectacular cliffs
and canyons absorbed our attention. The road is entirely within Dunn's
property, skirting but not violating the ancient Indian oases, national park
lands and the Big Horn Sheep Preserve.
</P>
<P>
We stopped frequently, studying many varieties of cacti. We saw how rock
formations were cracked and shaped by frost wedging, and how the earth settled
into an angle that is maintained on steep mountainsides.
</P>
<P>
Summit rocks exposed to millenniums of sunlight have turned dark. Newly cracked
rock formations add lighter colors to the mosaic. Century plants wave high
above cactus and manzanita.
</P>
<P>
Centuries ago the Cahuilla Indians spent their summers in these cool mountain
canyons after wintering around the warm natural waters around Palm Springs.
</P>
<P>
Because of their affinity for the hot waters, the Spaniards named them the Agua
Caliente Indians.
</P>
<P>
Now the Andreas, Murray and Palm canyons are part of Agua Caliente lands. Their
hiking and horseback trails and picnic grounds are accessible daily at the end
of South Palm Canyon Drive in Palm Springs for $3 admission, 75 cents for
children. The equestrian cost is $3.50.
</P>
<P>
The Jeep safari covers a trek of nearly 20 miles. From a 4,800-foot lookout
point, we could see across the desert to the Salton Sea. We stopped for lunch
in a grove of 200-year-old palm trees.
</P>
<P>
Dunn is carving another road on his property so that a round-trip Jeep tour can
cover the views from each side of the canyon loop, with frequent stops for
short walks.
</P>
<P>
Jim Condon, founder of the "Save the Santa Rosas" environmental group, said he
believes that the Jeep tours don't adversely affect the environment.
</P>
<P>
His organization plans to sponsor a local ballot initiative next spring to
limit and control development in the Santa Rosas, and to preserve them as a
natural background for the lower desert and its communities.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Three-hour safaris are $55 per person through Dec. 31, $60 through June 15. A
minimum of five people is required. Liability insurance of $750,000 per person
is included. For more information and reservations, contact Desert Off Road
Adventures, P.O. Box 4528, Palm Desert 92261, (619) 773-3187.

HOLLYWOOD PARK;
</P>
<P>
A SHORTAGE OF JOCKEYS HITS TRACK
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The way jockeys were becoming increasingly scarce Wednesday, George Taniguchi
and Emile Ohayon probably thought they might be pressed into service at
Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
Neither the long-retired Taniguchi, now a paddock judge at the track, nor
Ohayon, the press box mutuel clerk, saw action, but a lot of unfamiliar names
popped up on the day's card.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the afternoon, six of the eight leading riders were absent for
one reason or another.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Delahoussaye and Gary Stevens, 1-2 in the standings heading into the
final week, are on mini-vacations, awaiting Santa Anita's opening Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chris McCarron, who is seventh, called in sick Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Alex Solis, sixth among the riders, stayed home because he was concerned about
family and friends in his native Panama.
</P>
<P>
Apprentice Corey Nakatani, tied for third place with Laffit Pincay, missed most
of the program after being dumped in a gruesome incident in the third race.
Hammerin' Hank, a 2-year-old making his first start on the turf, suddenly
veered into the rail near the three-eighths pole. Failing in his attempt to
jump the fence, the Gold Stage colt severed his right front leg and bled to
death.
</P>
<P>
Nakatani was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical Center, where X-rays of his
left knee were negative. He could return today, according to Dr. Robert Kerlan.
</P>
<P>
Robbie Davis, who rode the longshot winner in the third, Short Timer, asked to
be taken off the remainder of his mounts.
</P>
<P>
McCarron lost three winning mounts through his absence. Aaron Gryder, recently
returned to the Southland, picked up one, Peppy's Kingdom in the second race,
and Pincay got two -- favorites Snow Perch in the fifth and Sumthing Rare in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
Solis forfeited Short Timer, and George Almeida replaced Davis on Oh Sweet
Thing, who rallied to take the sixth.
</P>
<P>
Even if Nakatani comes back today, he'd have to finish with a rush to wrest the
Hollywood Park jockey title from Delahoussaye.
</P>
<P>
The Covina-born teen-ager would need nine victories in the final four days to
pass Delahoussaye, who was also the top rider at Del Mar and Santa Anita's Oak
Tree meeting.
</P>
<P>
While the local title would be a definite boost for Nakatani, he has another
objective in mind these days -- specifically, the Eclipse Award for
apprentices. Riding against the nation's deepest and strongest colony, he has
held his own, but whether he has the numbers to impress enough voters remains
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
His 106 winners this year places Nakatani well down the list among apprentices.
Unofficially, however, he leads in terms of money won, having passed
Maryland-based Mike Luzzi, who has the most victories.
</P>
<P>
With the Eclipse election under way, Luzzi would have to be considered the
favorite, primarily because he's more familiar back East, where the majority of
the voters reside.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, Corey Black's mounts earned roughly $1 million more, but Allen Stacy,
another Eastern-based apprentice, had more wins and walked off with the
Eclipse.
</P>
<P>
"To win the Eclipse is my main goal," said Nakatani, who will keep his
five-pound weight allowance until the end of Santa Anita's meeting next April.
"I think I have a good chance. I know it's going to be difficult, but I think
this is probably the toughest circuit in America and the toughest place to
break in."
</P>
<P>
What has helped Nakatani establish himself is having Tony Matos, Pincay's
longtime partner, as his agent. And Pincay, too, has been a positive factor.
</P>
<P>
"To me, Laffit is the best rider, and I've always liked his style," Nakatani
said. "He was my idol. I've got to credit a lot of my success to him. He's
really helped me in a lot of ways."
</P>
<P>
A wrestler in high school, Nakatani became infatuated with his current sport
when he visited Santa Anita one morning with his father.
</P>
<P>
"I went to watch the workouts with him when I was 15 and I told him I wanted to
(be a jockey)," he said. "I said I could do that."
</P>
<P>
After attending a jockeys' school and working horses at Galway Downs, Nakatani
rode his first race during the 1988 Del Mar season, while spending weekends at
Caliente to gain experience, then came to Santa Anita last winter.
</P>
<P>
He picked up his first win in the big leagues March 16 on 15-1 shot Silver
Sabina.
</P>
<P>
"The feeling is something that is hard to explain," he said. "It just felt so
good to win a race at Santa Anita against this kind of competition.
</P>
<P>
"I still have a lot to learn and I still have some improving to do, but I have
confidence in my talent. Riding against these guys, I learn a lot, and they are
willing to help you."
</P>
<P>
Pincay said Nakatani, 19, "reminds me of me when I started," adding: "He looks
a little like I did on a horse.
</P>
<P>
"The most impressive thing about Corey is his desire. He wants to win and he'll
do anything to win a race. He's strong and he doesn't give up on horses. I
think he's going to do some good."
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
Oh Sweet Thing's victory enabled David Hofmans to regain the lead in the
trainers' standings. He has 10 wins, one more than John Sadler and Ron
McAnally. . . . Laconda, who was almost scratched, won the $32,000 feature,
beating stablemate Trick Question by 1 1/4 lengths in the 1 1/8-mile race.
Ridden by Russell Baze, who had two victories, Laconda returned $16.20 to win
and provided trainer Gary Jones with his seventh victory of the meeting. . . .
Apprentice jockey Jesus Castanon was also absent. Like Gary Stevens and Eddie
Delahoussaye, he elected to take some time off for the holidays. . . . There is
a Pick Six carryover for today of $59,193.15.

ARTIST'S STARDOM DIDN'T COME OUT OF NOWHERE;
</P>
<P>
ART: RAUL GUERRERO, WHO CALLS HIMSELF A "WORKING-CLASS ARTIST," HAS LONG BEEN
KNOWN IN SAN DIEGO. BUT HIS FAME IS GROWING AND NOW INCLUDES A SPREAD IN
"VANITY FAIR."
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN DIEGO
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He is modest, serious, private -- not the kind of person you'd expect to see on
the glossy pages of "Vanity Fair." But there he was last month, peeking out
among the perfume ads and gossip, under the headline, "Hot Paints."
</P>
<P>
Now that the art world has become hopelessly star-struck, perhaps the magazine
was a good place for local artist Raul Guerrero to be seen. His Los Angeles
dealer thinks so. Guerrero, mildly allergic to marketing strategies and hype,
just smiles.
</P>
<P>
"I'm a working-class artist," he said in a recent interview at his San Diego
home and studio. "I'm in a situation where I need to make a living off my art,
to continue my artistic quest."
</P>
<P>
That quest, begun in the late 1960s in Los Angeles, where he attended the
legendary Chouinard Art School, has gradually but steadily assumed the
characteristics of a successful career. Guerrero's third one-person show at Los
Angeles' Saxon-Lee Gallery opened last month and continues through Nov. 25. He
is one of 13 artists -- and the only one living outside the L.A. area --
featured in the inaugural exhibit at Pasadena's Armory Center for the Arts
(through Jan. 31).
</P>
<P>
The current issue of the art quarterly, "Visions" carries a statement by
Guerrero in its special section on multiculturalism and the arts. And next
year, a fountain designed by the artist will be unveiled as part of the Hope
Street redevelopment project commissioned by the city of Los Angeles. Other
participants include architect Frank Gehry and artist David Hockney.
</P>
<P>
Guerrero's work is, indeed, "caliente," as Karen Smith exclaims in "Vanity
Fair." But the artist, 44, is no overnight sensation. He has had nearly 20 solo
exhibitions in San Diego, Los Angeles and elsewhere since his first show in
</P>
<P>
1974 and a healthy dose of attention from the press as well. One critic
dismissed the inverted pyramid, flying saucer hubcaps, rotating Indian mask and
other symbolic constructions in his first show as "irritatingly hip." Others
since have labeled his photographs, paintings and constructions mysterious,
disturbing, vital, intriguing, timeless, gentle, ironic and haunting.
</P>
<P>
Despite the extreme permutations in style that his work has shown, varying from
severe conceptualism to lyrical romanticism, Guerrero said he has been
following the same line of thought for the last 15 years. He's searching, he
said, for a poetic reality that exists between an object or situation and the
person perceiving it.
</P>
<P>
"To illustrate reality is, in itself, not significant enough to achieve a level
of poetics," he said. "There's a moment when you enter that realm, a transitory
zone between fiction, what you imagine and what you perceive, based on your
entire contextual history, your background, education, what conditions you to
see."
</P>
<P>
Guerrero's interest in reconciling reality and fiction surfaces in perhaps its
most accessible form in his paintings of the last few years. The suite,
"Reflections on the Life and Times of a Venetian Jewess," conveys Guerrero's
impressions of the textures, light and color of the Italian city as much as it
restates certain cliches about the place, stemming from "what Hollywood fed me,
what I read in books." The melange of expectations he brings to a place, he
said, are as tangible as the direct sensations experienced there.
</P>
<P>
The Venetian series launched a trilogy, whose second part is the current
series, "Aspectos de la Vida Nocturna en Tijuana B.C. (Aspects of the Night
Life in Tijuana B.C.)." Each of these environments required a different
attitude, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I set out to do places that were exotic, romantic, that offered the
possibility of color, places that were a celebration of life, places that I had
an affinity for."
</P>
<P>
Venice, he said, is "part of our collective knowledge as one of the grand
cities of the world," while the bars and clubs of Tijuana summon more personal
memories. Painting this series "was part of re-experiencing what I had done as
a teen-ager, as a rite of passage, to go down to the Blue Fox."
</P>
<P>
Guerrero still sees work ahead for the Tijuana series, which was shown locally
at the David Zapf Gallery and is now on view at Saxon-Lee in Los Angeles, but
his third destination is already set: Iowa.
</P>
<P>
"It's part of my cultural heritage, since I was brought up in the U.S. It
affected my psyche, because many of the dreams lived out in Southern California
originated in the Midwest."
</P>
<P>
Though he has never been there, he expects his visit will be like "going back
and delving into the historical side of myself."
</P>
<P>
Each of the locales Guerrero chooses poses a different structural problem, he
said, and each calls for a different solution. An earlier series based on a
stay in Mexico related to the "magic realism" of such Latin American authors as
Gabriel Garcia Marquez in its combination of the imaginary and the concrete.
The current trilogy draws comparisons in style to the loose, buoyant brush
strokes of Matisse and the color-saturated romanticism of Delacroix.
</P>
<P>
Fundamental to all of his work, however, is a curiosity about symbols, myths
and the cultural archetypes that strike deep in the viewer's unconscious. His
passionate pursuit of these essential symbols led artist Ed Ruscha, who
collects Guerrero's work, to believe that "he has some demons haunting him and
he lets them out in his work."
</P>
<P>
Guerrero chuckled at the thought, then quickly sifted the comment for insights.
</P>
<P>
"I had never thought about it like that, and I think he's right. But I think he
missed the angels hovering around me. I think what he meant was that I'm
obsessed by it. I'm totally captivated by the creative act, the creative
pursuit. I think about it all the time."

<LEADPARA>  THE RESORT towns of the Coachella Valley offer everything refugees from the
pressures and environmental hazards of big cities could want. Here, just a
short hop from big, bad Los Angeles, is a low desert with clean, dry air ideal
for outdoor recreation in all but the hottest summer months.;    So it must be
one of those weird human quirks that in building towns like Palm Springs,
Rancho Mirage, Palm Desert, Indian Wells and the rest, developers did
everything they could to make visitors think they're in the tropics.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A visitor who didn't venture outside the resorts would swear that Palm
Springs and the surrounding area is a lush paradise of abundant lakes, flowing
streams, beautiful green lawns and just about every creature comfort
imaginable.;    But it takes just one look beyond the edge of the golf
courses, or past the latest housing development, to know this is desert. And
it takes but one visit to Indian Canyons in Palm Springs or the Living Desert
Reserve in Palm Desert to discover that this is an area of unique -- albeit
sparse -- natural beauty.;    These oases of desert authenticity may not offer
climate-controlled conditions or well-manicured vegetation. But they offer
their own kind of leisure.;    Indian Canyons, in the southwest corner of Palm
Springs, is probably the area's best-known natural retreat. A series of gorges
cut into the San Jacinto Mountains, they offer a reminder of why various
creatures -- human and otherwise -- settled here in the first place.;    The
four canyons that make up Indian Canyons are part of the reservation of the
indigenous Agua Caliente band of the Cahuilla Indians. The Agua Caliente (or
"hot water," for the natural mineral springs that flow in the town) tribal
council oversees tourism there.;    Andreas and Palm canyons -- the best known
and most visited of the four canyons -- are also the most accessible. (Murray
Canyon is accessible by hiking from Andreas Canyon; Tahquitz Canyon is open by
special permit only.);    Andreas is the first canyon visitors reach after
entering the reserve and the more rustic of the two. Admission is $3.25 for
adults and 75 cents for children ages 6 to 11. Naturally irrigated by the
ever-flowing Andreas Creek (carrying runoff from the snow-covered mountains
high above), this canyon is surprisingly lush.;    At the canyon's entrance,
just above the parking lot and picnic tables, massive red rocks thrust from
the ground like ancient sentinels. They're more than symbolic, though; these
tall walls of dramatically cut granite, along with rows of Washingtonia
filifera -- the distinctive, wide-frond palm trees that grow along the stream
-- offer natural protection from the often-blistering desert heat.;    Walk up
the trail a few hundred yards and suddenly you're in a deep, cool creek-cut
canyon.;    "You'd never think you were in the desert, would you," one man
said to his companions during a recent visit, and he was right.;    As of
early April, an abundance of spring wildflowers punctuated the green palms.
Small buds of violet, orange and yellow dot the banks of the stream.;    As
you walk up the Andreas Canyon trail, you're bound to encounter lizards and
other four-legged residents of the canyon. Their frantic scurrying provides a
clear indication that they still don't appreciate the heavy-footed intruders
clomping through their terrain. You'd think they'd be used to it, considering
the centuries of human presence in the area.;    Long before city folk
discovered the health and recreational benefits of the Palm Springs area, the
Agua Caliente Indians used the canyons as a sort of summer resort, moving onto
the valley floor in the winter, not unlike present-day visitors drawn to the
mild temperatures in the cooler months.;    Stopped by a fence;    The Andreas
Canyon trail ends about half a mile up, as a chain-link fence cuts off access
to the Andreas Gun Club beyond. A dramatic stone hunting lodge is visible a
few hundred yards beyond.;    Perhaps because its wide banks and better-marked
trails make it easier for casual visitors, Palm Canyon is the most visited of
the Indian Canyons. But it's also close to the trading post snack bar and
souvenir stand.;    The trading post is at the top of the canyon, adjacent to
the parking lot, and the view down is dramatic. There, amid the barren
hillsides, a massive grove of palms grows along the creek bed. At the bottom
of the steep but paved foot trail leading down from the trading post is a
broad, flat land of palms, an ideal picnic spot.;    With the flowing creek
running by sandy banks, Palm Canyon offers a surprisingly beachlike
atmosphere. Families splash and play in nature's own water park.;    Walk a
short distance farther into the canyon and the open spaces give way to a
narrower passageway, where flat rocks adjoin deep pools of stream water.;
Cool but undrinkable;    Beware, however, of the water. Although some seem
eager to bathe in it, its yellow-brown color and prominent suds are ample
indication that it's not fit to drink.;    Equestrians are also drawn to Palm
Canyon. Fifteen miles long, it sports a horse trail in addition to its foot
path. Stables near the entrance to Indian Canyons rent horses, giving visitors
an even better chance to engage in an authentic Dances With Palm Trees
experience.;    Although the palms in this canyon are thriving, it's
impossible to miss the black coating on most of them. They are a decade-old
reminder of a nasty fire that roared through the hillsides in 1980, burning
vegetation from the Palm Springs Aerial Tramway several miles north, all the
way through Palm Canyon.;    These charred trees -- many of them grossly
disfigured by vandals who have carved their initials into the burned wood --
are a reminder of how fragile even these desertplants are.;    But perhaps
there is no bigger threat to the desert than planned development. While the
Indians' ownership of the canyons has prevented them from being developed, the
same cannot be said of the valley floor. With the opening of each new resort
and the incorporation of each new town, more untouched desert disappears.;
Although it may seem that city luxuries and conveniences are almost part of
the Coachella Valley charter, a point of principle and pride, some area
residents work hard to defend the natural desert.;    The Living Desert
Reserve, just off Portola Drive in Palm Desert, preserves, on 1,200 acres,
carefully maintained samples of indigenous plants, birds, small and large
mammals, and other longtime desert residents.;    Anyone who who fears a
harsh, inhospitable desert will be amazed at the rugged beauty and industrious
survival skills of the desert's inhabitants.;    Part zoo, part botanical
garden, part education center, the Living Desert is perhaps most useful in
allowing visitors to see animals that usually stay out of sight during the
day.;    Because of the intense desert heat, many of the animals spend the
daytime burrowed underground, coming out at night to hunt and feed. But in the
indoor McManus Center, visitors can see kangaroo rats, red diamondback
rattlesnakes, bats and other creatures. An outdoor aviary lets guests get
up-close and personal with desert birds.;    Other display cages contain
eagles, falcons, condors and other larger desert birds, all of them injured
and unable to survive in the wild.;    At the far end of the reserve is a
small, rocky hill that is home to desert bighorn sheep, as well as two
non-natives of the California desert, Arabian oryxes and gazelles.;    The
Living Desert also offers an exhibit of Indian culture that shows how
economical the Cahuilla Indians were. For example, not only did they use the
leaves and seeds of the white sage plant to flavor food, they smoked its
leaves to cure colds, crushed them to use as a shampoo and hair straightener,
and put them under their arms as a deodorant.;    In short, the Indian Canyons
and the Living Desert Reserve offer a breath of fresh -- and natural -- air to
visitors made queasy by the climate-controlled environment of the desert's
resorts. And even those who feel no particular need to mix with native grasses
or investigate the desert's geological formations need not lament.;    After a
visit to the natural desert, you can always refresh yourself in the hotel
pool.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; (box) Indian Canyons: South end of South Palm

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: JIMMY HEATH, AT ELARIO'S, BRINGS 40
YEARS OF GROWTH
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Jimmy Heath made his reputation as an alto sax man in the be-bop tradition of
Charlie Parker. But he's evolved into much, much more during his more than 40
years in jazz.
</P>
<P>
During two weeks at Elario's, which began Wednesday night, Heath is
concentrating on tenor sax, but he also has a flute and soprano sax in tow.
</P>
<P>
Besides keeping up his talents on several instruments, Heath is a serious
composer. He is working on commissioned original works for the Montreal Jazz
Society and the Jazzmobile project in New York. He has also been writing new
material for himself, much of which he plans to unveil at Elario's.
</P>
<P>
Heath hasn't released a solo album for about two years, but last month he
collaborated with several other jazzmen on a session under the leadership of
Bill Cosby. Yes, that Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
Seems the Cos has a real thing about jazz. He chose a few tunes and brought
together some of his favorite people to play them under his direction,
musicians like Heath and hot young pianist Mulgrew Miller.
</P>
<P>
With his roots in be-bop, Heath is a living treasure of jazz who survived a
'50s battle with drugs and went on to a long, productive career. At Elario's,
he will be joined by former San Diegan Rob Schneiderman on piano, Bob Magnusson
on bass, John Guerin on drums the first week and Sherman Ferguson the second.
</P>
<P>
Denver pianist-singer Ellyn Rucker is in town for her annual summer stay, which
combines nights playing the tiny bar in the Beach House restaurant in Mission
Beach and days of working out.
</P>
<P>
This year's visit is especially welcomed by Rucker, who toured Europe three
times the past year. In June, she returned from two months in France, Germany,
Scotland and the U.K. She stopped in several small towns, such as Plymouth on
the English Channel, where jazz fans seldom have a chance to hear live music.
</P>
<P>
In such places, they clamored to buy copies of her albums, including last
year's "This Heart of Mine." Sometimes, Rucker traveled by train, a shopping
bag full of CDs in tow.
</P>
<P>
As is generally true of European audiences, they treated her with a reverence
rare stateside. She did a live interview and performance on BBC radio and made
an appearance on "Music Friends," a live radio music hour.
</P>
<P>
Rucker has two albums in the works: a duo with bassist Red Mitchell, already
recorded; and a collaboration with saxophonist Spike Robinson, a close friend
who also lives in Denver. She is a first-rate pianist whose swinging
improvisations are full of surprises, and she uses her sultry voice as a jazz
instrument.
</P>
<P>
Rucker will play Tuesday through Saturday nights through Aug. 18, except for
this Friday and Saturday nights, when she joins flutist Holly Hofmann in the
Horton Grand Hotel's Palace Bar downtown.
</P>
<P>
One thing jazz purists find dislikable about commercial jazz is the emphasis on
simple, choreographed melodies instead of fiery improvisations.
Guitarist-keyboardist Russ Freeman and his band the Rippingtons, who play
Humphrey's Concerts by the Bay Friday night at 7 and 9, claim to leave more
improvisational space in their songs than most pop jazz groups.
</P>
<P>
Freeman is a high-tech guitarist for the 1990s, feeding his instrument through
all manner of synthesizers and electronic equipment. Sometimes the results are
the same kind of nondescript lush music produced by many of his light jazz
peers. But Freeman is a first-rate musician, and the group's newest album,
"Tourist in Paradise," has won some good reviews, especially for its
Brazilian-flavored songs.
</P>
<P>
At press time, there were still plenty of tickets left.
</P>
<P>
Local jazz benefactors Bob and Gretchen Geib are taking a two-month hiatus from
the shows they present at Diego's Loft and other venues.
</P>
<P>
With their Society for Straight Ahead Jazz, the Geibs have produced 38 shows
the last year, dipping into their own pockets when ticket sales weren't
sufficient to pay musicians. Bob Geib will spend some time scouring Los Angeles
for new talent and sorting through more than 200 hours' worth of tapes he has
made during the shows.
</P>
<P>
Eventually, he hopes to combine the best of these on a CD. The Geibs' shows
will start again in October, with tentative bookings including former John
Coltrane bassist Art Davis, saxophonists Gary LeFebvre and Rod Cradit and
guitarist and alto sax man Al Kaye. The Geibs' last definite show before their
break will be an Aug. 4 appearance by guitarist Peter Sprague at Diego's Loft,
but Geib is also thinking about a Salmon House date for Ellyn Rucker with a
small ensemble.
</P>
<P>
RIFFS: The last three Sundays of brunch cruises aboard the MV Entertainer on
San Diego Bay have been canceled, including this Sunday's scheduled appearance
by Windows. The series opened May 13 with Doug Cameron, but scheduling problems
with some acts, combined with poor attendance, brought things to a halt this
week.

EXCAVATE MAKING NAME FOR HIMSELF
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Excavate's odds in the Kentucky Derby future book crashed before some of the
Las Vegas casinos learned how to spell his name.
</P>
<P>
Probably because of a slip of the tongue by his trainer, Charlie Whittingham,
the 2-year-old colt had been listed as "Excavator" by at least two Nevada race
books.
</P>
<P>
Minutes after Whittingham's Golden Pheasant had won this year's Arlington
Million, the trainer was unexpectedly asked on national television about his
Kentucky Derby prospects. Whittingham stumbled over the horse's name, it came
out "Excavator," and that's the way it stayed in Las Vegas until recently.
</P>
<P>
But Excavate blew his cover last Saturday at Hollywood Park, running for the
first time and winning at six furlongs by five lengths. It was a debut that
gave Whittingham no reason to disbelieve that Excavate might complete the hat
trick that Ferdinand and Sunday Silence started for the 77-year-old trainer at
Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
Now, based on his one victory in a maiden race, Excavate's odds have dropped
from 30-1 to 3-1 at the Frontier's race book, making him the second choice for
next year's Derby, behind the 5-2 Fly So Free, winner of the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile at Belmont Park a month ago and a cinch to be voted the Eclipse Award
as divisional champion.
</P>
<P>
The Derby is five months and a jillion land mines away, but if Excavate would
give Whittingham that third sniff of the roses, he would be the most expensive
horse ever to win the race. As a yearling, the son of Mr. Prospector and Anne
Campbell, the Never Bend mare who also produced Desert Wine, was sold for $1.1
million at a Keeneland auction.
</P>
<P>
Wayne Lukas was the underbidder on Excavate, with Whittingham buying the
handsome colt for Dick Duchossois, the owner of Arlington International
Racecourse.
</P>
<P>
After the sale, Arthur Hancock, Excavate's breeder, bought 12% back from
Duchossois and Whittingham has become a 10% owner.
</P>
<P>
Like Whittingham, Hancock became a Derby mainstay in the last decade. He was a
partner in Gato Del Sol, who won the race in 1982. Then in 1989, Hancock,
Whittingham and another partner, Ernest Gaillard, bottled the lightning with
Sunday Silence.
</P>
<P>
"Excavate is big-boned and tough," Hancock said. "I've liked the horse from the
time he was a foal. I think that running across those 100-acre fields we've got
at Stone Farm (in Paris, Ky.) has really helped him."
</P>
<P>
Hancock turns out his mares when they're just in foal, and one day a group of
them took off running across one of those large Stone Farm fields.
</P>
<P>
"They were running full out and Excavate was running right with them," Hancock
said. "At the end, he beat them. He reminded me of a silver bullet that day."
</P>
<P>
For a horse with such little experience, Excavate has already worked up a mound
of ballyhoo. He has twice been featured on national television, besides the
brief, muffled notice Whittingham gave him that day at Arlington.
</P>
<P>
"I told Charlie about this horse when (Excavate) was still a weanling," Hancock
said. "Another thing I like about him is that he's smart. This is a horse
that's got a world of sense. If everything goes right, he could really be
something."
</P>
<P>
Some trainers might be tempted to thrust Excavate into the $1-million Hollywood
Futurity a week from Sunday, but not Whittingham, who frequently doesn't run
his horses at all when they are 2-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Silence raced for the first time on Oct. 30, 1988, and broke his maiden
in his next race, Nov. 13. He had run four times before his first stakes race,
which turned out to be a victory in the San Felipe Handicap at Santa Anita in
March of 1989. He had run just six times going into the Derby.
</P>
<P>
And Ferdinand, the Derby winner in 1986, didn't win for the first time until
Nov. 3 of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
There's something odd about this Sunday's promotion at Hollywood Park. The
track is offering airplane trips for 100 fans to Las Vegas, where the winners
will spend three days at the Riviera Hotel and Casino. Does it make sense for a
track to send bettors someplace else to bet? Did Macy's tell Gimbels? What's
more, the Riviera isn't even among the numerous Nevada horse books that
co-mingle their bets with the mutuel pools at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
Go and Go, the winner of the Belmont Stakes but a disappointment in the Travers
and the Breeders' Cup Classic since then, has drawn the outside post in a field
of eight in Saturday's $100,000 Native Diver Handicap at Hollywood Park. Rial,
winner of the Oak Tree Invitational and then disqualified after finishing first
in the Burke Handicap at Santa Anita, is the high weight with 122 pounds. He'll
be running on dirt for the first time in this country, with Jose Santos riding
for the first time. Kent Desormeaux will be riding Go and Go for the first
time. Also in the field is Pleasant Tap, third in this year's Kentucky Derby
and eighth in the Breeders' Cup Turf.
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, the leading money-winning jockey this year with a lead of about
$850,000 over Santos, will be riding Aksar Saturday in the $100,000 Bay Meadows
Derby. There will be betting on the race at Hollywood Park. . . . Jerry Bailey
regains the mount on Plenty of Grace for Sunday's $200,000 Matriarch. Bailey
had another commitment at Aqueduct the day Herb McCauley rode the filly to
victory in the Yellow Ribbon at Santa Anita. . . . Caliente, which has been
closed because of labor problems, will resume racing on Jan. 19.

SANDAG REJECTS PROJECT IN AIRPORT FLIGHT PATH
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Exercising new authority to halt development near Lindbergh Field for the first
time, the San Diego Assn. of Governments has blocked plans for a $12.5-million
medical office building in the airport's approach path.
</P>
<P>
The regional government agency rejected the proposed Harborview Medical
Building at 220 Elm St. Friday, ruling that the project would exceed occupancy
limits designed to minimize the number of deaths and injuries in case of an
airliner crash.
</P>
<P>
A decision on a second project that would have exceeded the safety standard, a
$58.5-million, eight-story, mixed-use development known as Hay Plaza, was
postponed to allow developers and Sandag staff members to discuss occupancy
calculations.
</P>
<P>
Normally an advisory agency, Sandag acquired authority over land-use decisions
around Lindbergh and five other county airports Jan. 1, under state legislation
that gave such regional government agencies oversight for airports without city
land-use plans.
</P>
<P>
The city of San Diego has no land-use plan for the area around Lindbergh,
though one should be completed within six months, said Jack Koerper, Sandag's
special projects director. Sandag is also overseeing land-use decisions for the
areas around Fallbrook, Ramona, Ocotillo Wells, Agua Caliente and Jacumba
airports, Koerper said.
</P>
<P>
Since Jan. 1, Sandag has approved about 150 land-use proposals for the area
near Lindbergh, Koerper said.
</P>
<P>
Sandag staffers calculate that the 9-story Harborview medical building would
hold 2,393 people per acre, far more than the 918 people per acre allowed under
one of the safety regulations that Sandag is following, Koerper said.
</P>
<P>
But James P. O'Neil, attorney for Harborview's developers, argued that the
staffers "deliberately chose not to consider the portion of the site that
contains the parking garage," an interpretation that would have sharply reduced
the occupancy per acre statistic, he said.

  [Text] There was a confrontation in Guerrero State between
Party of the Democratic Revolution [PRD] members and state
public security agents in Cutzamala de Pinzon, in the area of
Tierra Caliente. The confrontation occurred when PRD members
staged a demonstration to demand the dismissal of Mayor (Ramperi
Suarez Berrun).
  Policemen prevented the PRD members from seizing the
municipal building, triggering the confrontation and some
shooting. State authorities said at first two policemen died in
the confrontation while another six were injured. The PRD state
leadership revealed while two members received bullet wounds and
many others suffered bruises, no one died.
  In the meantime, Cutzamala de Pinzon is living in a climate
of tension.

  [Text] Morelia, Michoacan, 6 May--The Attorney General's
Office [PGR] revealed today that Federal Judicial Police agents
captured an individual with over a ton of marijuana in his
possession, on the Los Reyes-Zamora highway.
  The subject in custody is Enrique Calderon Duran, aged 45, a
native of Apatzingan, employed as a taxi driver. He claimed to
have received 500 new pesos for transporting the grass to Los
Reyes.
  The driver was carrying 144 packages of the drug, with a
total weight of 1,012 kg, on a pickup truck, concealed under
cattle hides intended for tanning. He said that he was supposed
to deliver the merchandise to someone in Tierra Caliente.
  The presumed drug trafficker was captured during a routine
inspection on the aforementioned road, near the municipality of
Jacona. The agents who discovered the drugs immediately arrested
the subject, confiscating the packages and the pickup truck.
  The PGR in Michoacan reported that the drugs and the subject
in custody were left at the disposal of the Federal Public
Prosecutor's Office, so that the pertinent interrogations could
be conducted.

FORMER OWNER SAYS SHE STILL HAS EMOTIONAL TIES TO SECRETARIAT
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Penny Chenery saw Secretariat at Claiborne Farm in Paris, Ky., last
spring, the woman who raced him to the Triple Crown title in 1973 came away
with the impression that he was carrying too much weight.
</P>
<P>
A couple of weeks ago, Secretariat was diagnosed as having laminitis, a serious
hoof inflammation that causes circulatory problems.
</P>
<P>
Chenery doesn't have a breeding interest in Secretariat anymore, but she was
associated with the horse for 17 of his 19 years. So, naturally she was happy
to learn that he has recovered.
</P>
<P>
"Anything like that could be life-threatening, but he's stable now," said
Walter Kaufman, the veterinarian who is treating Secretariat. "He's still on
medication, but he now has about 95% of his normal gait back."
</P>
<P>
Secretariat was syndicated for breeding after he won the Triple Crown, and
Chenery, after years of getting ordinary horses from mares she sent to the
stallion, sold her lifetime share a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I miss the part about breeding to him every year," she said. "It was a
financial move. The business has gotten so expensive."
</P>
<P>
Long before Secretariat's recent problem, Chenery felt that she made one
mistake in sending him to stud.
</P>
<P>
"If there was anything I would like to do over, it would have been to insist
that he be exercised regularly with a rider on his back," Chenery said. "But
when we syndicated him, I was new in that phase of the business, and so was
Seth Hancock (who has managed Claiborne since his father, Bull, died).
</P>
<P>
"Seth just told me that Claiborne never exercised any of it stallions because
his daddy didn't believe in doing it. I found out later that when Seattle Slew
was syndicated, it was a condition of the contract that he be ridden on a
regular basis."
</P>
<P>
Kaufman doesn't believe that exercising Secretariat would have prevented him
from developing laminitis. Kaufman said that Seattle Slew has been exercised
since his early stud days because in the beginning he had difficulty getting
mares in foal.
</P>
<P>
"When Sir Gaylord (who was out of Somethingroyal, the same dam as
Secretariat's), first went to stud, he got fat and infertile," Chenery said.
"He was sent to Alec Head, who gave him lots of exercise, and he became one of
the best sires in England."
</P>
<P>
The last connection for Chenery with Secretariat is Sacred Dance, a 3-year-old
daughter of the 1973 horse of the year who is at a Pennsylvania farm. Sacred
Dance, who is out of Dance With Squall, a minor stake winner, suffered from a
salmonella infection and has never raced.
</P>
<P>
"She's gray, but she has Secretariat's head," Chenery said. "She may not race
until she's a 5-year-old, but I'll never give her up. For sentimental reasons,
I'm going to keep her the rest of her life."
</P>
<P>
Present Value was assigned high weight of 123 pounds, one more than Speedratic
and three more than He's a Saros, for the Pomona Handicap. He's a Saros, beaten
earlier at the meet by Conquering Hero, another nominee for Sunday's stake, has
won the handicap two consecutive years. Conquering Hero, assigned 118 pounds
for Sunday, was second in last year's handicap.
</P>
<P>
First Magical Mile, who could have been California's fastest 2-year-old, was
sent to the sidelines. Then Red Ransom, an undefeated New York 2-year-old,
suffered a leg injury that ended his season.
</P>
<P>
Summer Squall, winner of the Hopeful at Saratoga, is still in training, but
plans to run him Sunday in the Arlington-Washington Futurity have been scuttled
because of a bruised foot.
</P>
<P>
After the Arlington race, Summer Squall was scheduled to run in the Champagne
at Belmont Park and then the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Gulfstream Park. But
instead of the Champagne he may run in the Breeders' Futurity Oct. 13 at
Keeneland, where he's currently stabled. The Keeneland race is 1 1/16 miles
around two turns, which might better prepare Summer Squall for the Nov. 4
Breeders' Cup race at the same distance.
</P>
<P>
Jockey Chris Antley is in limbo in New York because of recurrent
substance-abuse problems, and owner Dan Lasater has been reinstated by
Louisiana racing officials after a prison stretch.
</P>
<P>
Antley, one of New York's leading riders, surrendered his license to
authorities, admitting that he has drug problems again. Antley, sidelined a
month because of a knee injury, was scheduled to return last weekend, but
didn't ride and was also abandoned by his agent. Antley says he will continue
drug rehabilitation and his program will be monitored by state racing
authorities before they consider giving him another license.
</P>
<P>
Lasater, whose stable won 494 races in 1974, which is still a record, won three
Eclipse Awards as the country's top owner before he was arrested on charges of
distributing cocaine. He spent 11 months in prison. The commission voted to
reinstate him, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes
</P>
<P>
More surprising than Bayakoa's victory over Open Mind in last Sunday's Ruffian
Handicap was that Belmont Park fans made the winner the favorite, even though
Open Mind went into the stake with a 10-race winning streak. There was also no
advantage for Bayakoa in the weights. Despite a last-place finish at Del Mar in
her last start, Bayakoa carried five more pounds than Open Mind, who got a
break in the weights because she is a younger horse. In 14 starts before the
Ruffian, Open Mind was favored in all except the first three races of her
career. Open Mind wound up third in the Ruffian, the first time she has been
worse than second.
</P>
<P>
According to the linemaker at the Sands in Las Vegas, Bayakoa is the 2-1
favorite and Open Mind is 3-1 for the Breeders' Cup Distaff. After his victory
in the Super Derby, Sunday Silence went to 8-5, behind Easy Goer at 6-5, in the
Breeders' Cup Classic. Other Breeders' Cup favorites are Summer Squall, 3-1 in
the Juvenile; Stella Madrid and Rue de Palm, both 3-1 in the Juvenile Fillies;
On the Line, 2-1 in the Sprint; Polish Precedent, 2-1 in the Mile; and
Cacoethes, 2-1 in the Turf.
</P>
<P>
Golden Pheasant, the horse that handed Nashwan his first loss by winning a
stake at Longchamps, is owned by Kings' owner Bruce McNall.
</P>
<P>
Endow, who won his first stake at Fairplex, is scheduled to run there Saturday
in the Pomona Derby. . . . On Saturday night at Los Alamitos, Flomont, Mighty
Easy Pass and Ourautograph are the leading contenders in the $500,000 Dash for
Cash Futurity for quarter horses.
</P>
<P>
When Pat Day rode eight winners at Arlington recently, widely forgotten was the
fact that Hubert Jones was the first jockey to have an eight-victory day.
Jones, now a local steward, won eight at Caliente in 1944.
</P>
<P>
Gene Klein has told Keeneland officials that there will be no reserve prices on
the 120 horses to be auctioned at his dispersal sale there on Nov. 6. This
means that the horses will be sold without having to meet minimum prices that
are frequently established privately before a sale.

  [Text] Torreon, Coahuila, 16 May--Commander Juan Carlos
Alvarado announced today that Federal Judicial Police [PJF]
forces succeeded in confiscating 253 packages of various shapes
and sizes containing a total of 1,063 kg and 920 grams of
marijuana.
  The incident occurred at 1330 near Puerto Pinones, along the
Zacatecas-Saltillo highway, while the drugs were being carried
on a 1987 red Torton type truck with Federal District license
plates.
  The grass was concealed in a false compartment made of wood
on the sides of the trailer, in the vehicle driven by Juan
Manuel Barrera Reyes. He would admit only that he had left Agua
Caliente, Zacatecas, bound for this capital. However, he claimed
not to know the name of the shipment's owner nor that of the
person for whom it was intended.
  The police chief remarked that when the driver, Barrera
Reyes, noticed the PJF agents' presence, he seemed very nervous,
and accelerated the vehicle. It was stopped for inspection, with
the aforementioned results. The incident was reported to the MP
[Public Prosecutor's Office] agent, Roberto Lujan Sanchez, so
that he might remand the subject to the district court in La
Laguna.

<LEADPARA>  TIME was -- and not too long ago -- when no one came to this vacation desert
land except in midwinter.;    That certainly was true in 1938, the year Palm
Springs was incorporated, when Hollywood stars, European royalty and other
bigwigs arrived in mid-January and departed en masse by the end of March. Now
visitors come year-round, but summertime visitors are not necessarily of the
same fashionable ilk as those who settle in for weeks or months during the
high season.  </LEADPARA>

Additional information attached to the end of this article  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     June, July and August travelers are more casual, more bargain-conscious,
more likely to arrive in their cars and stay for briefer periods. They are
more of the do-it-yourself variety, which is just as well, in that some
sightseeing services are curtailed after May.;    But the same wonderful golf
courses and tennis courts, high-fashion shops, innovative restaurants, art
galleries and other attractions that draw winter sun-seekers remain all year
for the taking. And the desert mystique knows no season.;    It's a given that
Palm Springs gets hot -- real hot. But as Murrell Foster, executive director
of Palm Springs Tourism, points out, "While 110 degrees in Texas would be
unbearable, 110 degrees in Palm Springs is quite bearable because of the low
humidity." As a former director of visitor development for the Dallas
Convention and Visitors Bureau, he should know.;    "People play golf and
tennis early, get off the course by 10 a.m., stay in the air-conditioned
comfort of their home or hotel room during the day and go swimming at night,"
he says. He could add that the hotel room is at a greatly reduced rate in the
summer.;    Through Sept. 15, a program called Fun Days, Free Nights is in
effect. Participating hotels, inns and B&amp;Bs offer an extra night without
charge for guests purchasing a specified number of paid nights, generally two
or three.;    Motorists coming into Palm Springs from Los Angeles on
Interstate 10 find a Visitor Greeting and Information Center on California
111, at the city's northern entrance. It stands right by Tramway Road, which
leads to the literal high point of any visit, the Aerial Tram that climbs to
the 8,516-foot level of 10,804-foot Mount San Jacinto.;    The center is
stocked with brochures on accommodations and restaurants, and almost any piece
of tourist literature imaginable. Color photos of hotels and inns help
visitors select their quarters, as does the helpful staff. This is the place
to pick up maps, make reservations and purchase souvenirs.;    Those who come
in on I-10 from the east are likely to exit at Indio, picking up Highway 111
and following it west and northwest through the burgeoning Coachella Valley
enclaves of Indian Wells, Palm Desert, Rancho Mirage and Cathedral City before
reaching Palm Springs.;    These visitors will find information and literature
at the Welwood Murray Memorial Library on the corner of Palm Canyon Drive and
Tahquitz Way in the heart of downtown. Both centers are open seven days a
week.;    Until March, California 111 followed Palm Canyon Drive through the
heart of Palm Springs, but this section has become Business 111; the main
route now skirts downtown via Gene Autry Trail and Vista Chino to the east and
north.;    This rerouting of traffic is but part of a concerted effort to
retain a village atmosphere in a city that has grown to 40,000 residents.;
Another effort is through the recently introduced (and already successful)
Thursday night VillageFest, a street fair and market on Palm Canyon Drive in
the heart of downtown. A farmers' market has been added to the street
performers and musicians, cart vendors and assorted booths that take over the
closed-off blocks.;    Other summertime activities? Family-oriented concerts
and movies are presented Monday and Wednesday evenings at Sunrise Park. The
Palm Springs Angels, the class A farm club affiliate for Gene Autry's
California Angels, play at least twice a week through the summer.;    The
ever-popular 21-acre Oasis Waterpark has introduced a new "Squirt City," with
giant climb-on animal-shaped floats for toddlers and two larger slides for
older children.;    Moorten's Botanical Gardens, with nature trails and 2,000
varieties of desert plants, is open daily.;    Bicycle paths and jogging
trails abound; in the mountains are hiking and horseback trails.;    Early
Palm Springs is preserved at the Village Green Heritage Center on Palm Canyon
Drive, site of the town's oldest building, the McCallum Adobe, built in 1885,
and Miss Cornelia's House from the 1890s. Also in the Heritage Center is
Ruddy's General Store, filled with 1930s memorabilia. Through September it
will be open only on weekends.;    A block east, on Indian Avenue, history
goes back to 1853, when a government survey party mapped Palm Springs and its
natural mineral pool. The large Spa Hotel is built around the original hot
mineral springs that gave the city its name.;    It's a long story, but 10
square miles of Palm Springs, or 42 percent of the city, are owned by the Agua
Caliente Band of the Cahuilla Tribe of Mission Indians. This includes the land
leased by the Spa Hotel, as well as that on which the Convention Center and
attached Wyndham Palm Springs hotel stand, among others.;    Even though tours
probably will not go into the 32,000-acre Agua Caliente Indian Reservation,
visitors will be allowed entrance ($3.25 for adults) to picnic or hike the
trails set aside by the Tribal Council in Andreas, Murray and Palm Canyons.
Smoke Tree Stables in Palm Springs, also will continue horseback rides into
the canyons, as well as to other areas.;    Tour operators include Gray Line,
which operates a 2 1/2-hour tour of celebrity homes and other sights departing
at 10 a.m. daily until October, and Celebrity Tours.;    Covered Wagon Tours
offers a choice of daily two-hour tours, barbecue tours and breakfast tours,
all by reservation, but expects the breakfast tours to be in the most demand
during the hot months.;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; Palm Springs Tourism Division,
401 S. Pavilion Way, Palm Springs, Calif. 92262; (800) 347-7746. Also makes
hotel reservations. Request the brochure for Fun Days, Free Nights that lists
hotels participating in the summer promotion in effect through Sept. 15; some
hotels offer as may as three nights free for two paid nights.;    For
information on satellite cities in the Coachella Valley -- Cathedral City,

FT  02 JUL 94 / Travel: Myth and reality of the Rio Grande - Nicholas
Woodsworth hangs out on the US-Mexican border
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boca Chica. In my imagination the Rio Grande has always loomed large and
wide, a substantial expression of the frontier and all that is heroically
American. But what is true of the country's favourite sweet and sticky
soft-drink is also true of the river - the real thing is never as impressive
as the myth that surrounds it.
Here, at its mouth on the Gulf of Mexico, more than 1,500 miles from its
source, the Rio Grande is no mighty river. Shallow, muddy and sluggish, it
is barely more than 15 yards across. Standing on its crumbling banks, I felt
deceived. Life on the border is not quite the old west romance you might
think. It is, in fact, far more more curious and compelling than that.
On the other side, a line of rusty pick-up trucks was parked on the beach
and a dozen cowboy-hatted Mexicans were spending a sunny Saturday morning
fishing. Seagulls screamed overhead and excited Latin rhythms floated on the
mild winter air from truck radios.
On the beach, one of the Mexicans threw a metal grill over a fire of broken
fruit crates. Another, all whiskers and paunch, stripped to his bright green
boxer shorts. Wading gingerly into the river, he began casting a circular
throw-net for the whiting that come to the river's mouth at low tide.
His casting was interrupted by the approach of a small motor boat from
up-river. It cut cross-stream and nosed into the Mexican shore. A woman
climbed out of one of the trucks, hopped into the boat, and in 30 seconds
was ferried to the American side. Jumping into a waiting vehicle, she
disappeared down the flat sand beach towards the main road and the city of
Brownsville, half-an-hour away.
'Just one more Dollars 50-a-week cleaning lady,' said Jesse, the young
Chicano I had been chatting to, as he cast a baited hook into the stream.
'No work papers, no resident's card, no minimum wage.'
Jesse has no such worries. Hispanic by blood but American by birth, he is of
two minds about the country across the river. He is a product of la
frontera, and tied to the strongly-flavoured, hybrid border culture that has
grown up along the Rio Grande. He is as 'Tex-Mex' as tacos and enchiladas,
or as Radio Caliente, the local station which serves rapid-fire bilingual
chit-chat and conjunto, the Anglo-Hispanic accordion music of the border.
But Mexico itself appeals little: Jesse knows that if Mexicans are willing
to take up exploited, illegal lives in the US for Dollars 50 a week, it is
because life at home is harder still.
Did he himself often cross the border to Matamoros, I asked? 'Not much.
Liquor is cheaper there. But there's too much hustling - stolen cars,
hookers, drugs, phoney documents, smuggling, scams of all kinds. There are
some real bad guys over there. Last time they took my money.'
Who were 'they', I asked. Street toughs? No, he said, laughing. The police.
For most, life on the border is rarely fair or easy.
Matamoros. An air of shabbiness, poverty, and impermanence hangs over the
Rio Grande, especially here in the seamy bars and billiard halls, the dog
tracks and strip joints, the pawn shops and gun stores. On both sides of the
border you will find people and services providing for and exploiting human
need. Americans cross the border in search of exoticism and surreptitious
pleasures. Most Mexicans seem happy to find rough survival on the other
side.
Essentially, this is no man's land. Trust and familiarity are foreign here -
shop windows are grilled, fences abound, 'No Loitering' signs hang in
parking lots and gas stations. Few outsiders linger along the underbelly of
the US. Most feel a strong sense of place here, but little sense of
belonging. If the border belongs to anyone, it is to the anonymous
transients who stream over it.
The international crossing points over the Rio Grande are a travel bargain.
Where else on earth can you pay 25 cents and in seconds walk from a society
of high-tech mass-consumption to third world neglect and deprivation? It is
along the Rio Grande that the techtonic plates of the north-south divide run
edge to edge.
But in spite of the cracked pavements, the cheap blankets and tourist
trinkets, the sleazy come-ons to buy marijuana or half-an-hour with a young
girl, there is something refreshing about Mexican towns on the Rio Grande.
They have a heart.
On the US side, community life has largely disappeared from downtown
pavements. If it exists anywhere, it is in freeway shopping malls and fast
food places out on the urban peripheries - there are times when America's
soul seems approachable only by car.
Mexican life, though, is immediately accessible. In Matamoros there were
mobile vendors and shoe-shine boys, blind musicians and sellers of lottery
tickets, squeezers of fruit juice and pavement grillers of skewered lamb.
There were crowded markets and city squares graced by orange trees and
bandstands of ornate wrought iron work. Whole families promenaded, entire
armies of men chatted the day away. Shopping malls may be more efficient,
but I will take the streets of Matamoros any day.
The lower Rio Grande Valley. I spent a morning in a trailer park with
Barbara and Archie Dick. If they make the only decent cup of tea in the
whole valley, it is because they have not forgotten their native Glasgow.
They had driven down from the frozen wastes of Ontario, where they now live,
for some winter sunshine. But was it really worth it, I wondered?
Not long ago the valley's wealth came largely from the market gardens and
fruit orchards, sugar cane and cotton fields worked and harvested by Chicano
and Mexican immigrant labour. These days, it is the fast-growing retirement
industry that fills the roadside fields the length of the lower valley.
I do not begrudge retired people their place in the sun, their health and
leisure centres, their golf carts and woodworking classes, their social
evenings that have turned the valley into the square-dancing capital of the
world.
But I did have difficulties with their 80,000 'RVs' - recreational vehicles
 -and the more than 500 monstrous 'RV parks' that blot the landscape here.
RVs - great blocks of lumbering, wheeled real estate that permit the
transfer of ghastly suburbs from one part of the country to the other - may
one day take over the US. When I left the valley to follow the river up to
Big Bend, I counted a convoy of eight 55-ft monsters from Quebec pulling out
behind me, a lost tribe seeking its destiny in the desert.
Laredo. Saturday night in downtown Laredo, on the US side of the border, is
deader than it ever was when this was a dung-spattered frontier town. I
spent the early evening at my motel off Interstate 35 drinking beer with a
crowd of over-nighting truck-drivers. We sat out in the parking lot in front
of a plastic garbage can filled with ice and bottles of Bud, and told dirty
jokes. I have long known that truck drivers are the folk heroes of modern
America. Now I am trying to figure out why.
Nuevo Laredo. Where do all the hip cowboys in Laredo head on a Saturday
night? Answer: Nuevo Laredo on the other side of the Rio Grande. Near the
clubs on Plaza San Miguel, the pavements were jammed and noisy. By midnight
there was car gridlock downtown, and the line to get into the OK Tijuana
discotheque stretched round the corner.
There were no signs of the usual Rio Grande poverty in the OK Tijuana, none
of its striking contrasts. Like the Americans in the place, the Mexicans
were all young, good-looking, well-dressed and well-off. What is more, the
two groups were hardly distinguishable. The Mexican city has a sizeable
middle-class, and its US sister-city a mixed Anglo-Hispanic population.
Big Bend. Nancy Kerrigan, the Bobbitts, California earthquakes, Elvis
Presley, the Cowboys vs the Bills - you can twiddle the car radio knob late
at night and catch all of America's madness as the striped lines fly by, but
in Big Bend country none of it will touch you.
Big Bend - a big bend in the Rio Grande - is what is left of the unspoilt
frontier. It is a huge, remote, largely uninhabited tract in the Chihuahua
desert, and breathtaking in its beauty. For US tourists, who still believe
strongly in the idea of the frontier, its national park is a sanctuary
protected from everything but tourism itself.
But even wagon trains of RVs lose themselves in this vast space, and I found
a serene stretch of riverbank. On the other side, the little Mexican village
of Santa Elena slumbered in the winter sunshine. There were no bridges or
border posts or hustlers here, just a rowboat and a ferryman sitting on the
far bank beside a burro. The ferryman dozed, the burro dozed, and I, too,
settled quietly to an afternoon of dreaming. Here, at least, the river was
as wide and deep and peaceful as it has always been in my imagination.

JIM MURRAY: IN MODERN GOLF, YOU CAN'T THROW OUT THE FIRST-ROUND LEADERS

The early rounds of a 5-round golf tournament are like the first few rounds of
a heavyweight championship fight. A lot of clinching, jabbing, shoving,
bobbing, weaving. A reluctance to close with your opponent, to wake him up, to
dare him. You don't throw any crazy rights, you don't go for the quick
knockout, you protect yourself at all times.
</P>
<P>
Oh, you make birdie if you can, but you don't risk a double bogey to do it. You
tend to take the high-percentage way around the course. You hit for the fat
part of the green, away from the water, around, not through, trouble.
</P>
<P>
But even in this heyday of no-star golf, you would think the doings of one or
two key players would filter through the clubhouse or press room the way they
used to. It was not so long ago that, even in a sorting-out first round, the
buzz would go through a club: "What is Hogan doing?" Or, "Anybody hear a score
on Snead?"
</P>
<P>
A golf tournament was not under way until a Palmer watch had been set up. Or a
Nicklaus or Trevino information network had been established. And then,
latterly, no golf gallery would go a hole without checking, "Has Raymond
(Floyd) gone off yet?" or, "What hole is Greg (Norman) on?"
</P>
<P>
You had to see what Johnny Miller was up to before you could write your lead in
the press tent. Johnny might cobble it up for you by coming in with a 61 late
in the day.
</P>
<P>
Tournament golf has become such a crapshoot, you don't hear that anymore. A
golf field is like a claiming race at Caliente. You stick a pin in a program.
You don't really see how any of them can win it. I mean, nobody hurries over to
a leader board to see if Shawn McEntee or Brian Tennyson is making a run at the
leaders.
</P>
<P>
One consequence is, you no longer throw out the unknown first-round leaders.
The attitude used to be of no-names atop the leader board: "Very cute. But you
don't belong there. Wait till Saturday night. Order will be restored."
</P>
<P>
There were, at last count, 11 first-time winners on the PGA Tour last year.
It's not a tour, it's a lottery. It probably has less form than anything in the
whole firmament of sport at the moment. The ribbon clerks don't get scared out
of this pot. They see and raise.
</P>
<P>
They've got a whole lot of U.S. Open winners in this field at the Bob Hope
Chrysler Classic this week. They've got a couple of British Open winners. It's
awash with former Masters winners.
</P>
<P>
Nobody's in a hurry to bet any of them.
</P>
<P>
When Andy Warhol said that everybody in the United States was going to be
famous for 15 minutes, he must have had the PGA Tour in mind. It's the world's
biggest Alphonse-Gaston act. So nobody was yawning when word filtered down
early that a young nobody named David Ogrin was leading the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The good news about David Ogrin was that he had never won a PGA tournament.
Which makes him practically an "out" price to win here, the way things have
been going on the tour. Besides, he has only been on the Tour 7 years. What is
he, a machine?
</P>
<P>
David is about as average as you can get in today's golf. Naturally, he's
blond. Plays out of Texas but comes from Illinois. So he lives and dies with
the Chicago Cubs, a la Raymond Floyd. Ogrin's greatest fear is not a ball in
the water in a playoff but that a player the Cubs traded to Texas will suddenly
hit .380 next year.
</P>
<P>
David Ogrin is not leading this tournament, but his opening 68 on a windy,
blustery day at Bermuda Dunes puts him squarely in position.
</P>
<P>
David has no illusions about being the next Ben Hogan. He knows he has a better
chance of being the next Ben Franklin. He knows where he fits.
</P>
<P>
"I make $138,000 on the tour and everybody comes up and says, 'Great year!' "
he says. "Bob Tway makes $368,000 and everybody comes up and says 'What's wrong
with Bob Tway?' "
</P>
<P>
For a non-winner on the tour, Ogrin became a minor celebrity in his first year
in the game when a golf magazine printed his rookie's diary.
</P>
<P>
"I dumped all over Las Vegas," he admits, only somewhat ruefully. "The town,
not the golf course. Then, I blasted on Memphis. The golf course, not the town.
Then, I almost won my first tournament at Memphis. I finished second in 1985. I
lost a playoff to Hal Sutton."
</P>
<P>
His candor cost him $1,000, the fine levied for "shedding unfavorable light on
the players and the sponsors."
</P>
<P>
Recalls Ogrin: "The old-timers would admit, 'What Ogrin says is true. But I
would never say it.' "
</P>
<P>
Ogrin is not only more careful with what he says but how he plays. His game is
patience, he says, but he is satisfied with his progress up the ladder.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with my 6 years. Golf is a game which can't be rushed."
</P>
<P>
No one can accuse David Ogrin of rushing it.
</P>
<P>
"Coming back to a course year after year is like going back to old friends," he
says. "You get more comfortable each time."
</P>
<P>
He also likes to point out that he made the cut -- shot well enough to stay in
the tournament from start to finish -- 20 times last year. This is a long way
from Byron Nelson's 113 straight cuts or Jack Nicklaus' 105. His game, of
course, may always stay well short of Nicklaus' or Nelson's. It may not even
catch up with Joey Sindelar's.
</P>
<P>
First of all, he has to catch up with leader Fred Couples here this week. And
then get to the point where, some year, he will rack up a half-million or so in
a year's earnings and have someone come up and say, "What's wrong with David
Ogrin?"

   Pope John Paul II said today the
church and state in Mexico are reaching a better understanding
after more than a century of hostility.
   ``The context of the international community is initiating a new
phase of its history, and that will have its repercussions here in
the near future,'' John Paul said in a speech directed to the
teachers of Mexico.
   John Paul was greeted at the airport here by a crowd of more
than 50,000 people doing ``the wave.'' He delivered his speech
under a hot sun for the first time on this trip, and a security
guard held a white parasol over his head.
   Because the pope was only stopping off at the airport here on
the third day of his eight-day journey, the city built replicas of
important downtown colonial buildings as a backdrop.
   ``A new perspective of contacts between the church and the
political community of this country is occurring in this day,'' the
pope said. ``And in this phase of better understanding and
dialogue, the church wants to offer its own support, without
straying from its specific goals and abilities.''
   The church is severely restricted under Mexico's constitution,
although many of the restrictions are ignored. The speech was the
pope's most direct public reference to President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari's moves toward normalization of church-state relations.
   The pope said teachers must strive for a ``leap in quality'' to
move education beyond the basics of reading and writing. He said
the church was not a brake on scientific and cultural progress, but
asked teachers to ``open the world of instruction to Christ.''
   The pope drew wild cheers when he spontaneously saluted the
``corazones calientes,'' or ``hot hearts,'' of Aguascalientes,
which means hot waters and refers to the area's thermal springs.
   ``Come back, come back,'' chanted the crowd, waving thousands of
white flags, pennants and hats. The pope's next stop was a shrine
to the Virgin Mary at the nearby town of San Juan de Los Lagos.
   On Monday, in the port city of Veracruz 200 miles east of Mexico
City, the pontiff had defended plans to celebrate the 500th
anniversary of Christianity in the New World from critics who say
the church came as an agent of conquest, repression and disease.
   ``The discovery, the conquest and the evangelization occupy a
decisive, luminous place taken all together, even though they are
not without shadows,'' John Paul told thousands of people at a
waterfront prayer service.
   In Veracruz, the pope spoke from a raised platform along the
Gulf Coast harbor where conquistadors led by Hernan Cortes first
reached Mexico in 1519.
   They were followed five years later by the first group of
missionaries.
   The celebrations planned for 1992, the 500th anniversary
Columbus' arrival in America, have prompted a fierce debate in
Latin America. Critics charge that the European conquerors
destroyed native cultures, and that Roman Catholic priests were an
instrument of conquest.
   In Mexico, Columbus Day is celebrated as ``The Day of the
(Indian) Race,'' and in recent years Indian activists have attacked
memorial ceremonies at the monument to Columbus in downtown Mexico
City.
   John Paul has used the 1992 anniversary as a banner in his
efforts to launch a ``re-evanglization'' or revival of Catholicism
in Latin America. He plans to open a special conference of Latin
American bishops in the Dominican Republic in two years to
celebrate the anniversary.
   ``The evangelization of America, encouraged by the Lord ...
encountered many limits and difficulties which even today wait to
be seen in their true light through an objective study; but there
were also great successes, as demonstrated by the splendid works
that have served as a model and support for your people's road
during these centuries,'' the pope said.
   John Paul cited the examples of three 16th-century priests who
defended the rights of Mexican Indians. He said the church
``receives from Christ the mandate to go and preach the Gospel to
all nations.'
   The pope then returned to Mexico City and held brief meetins
with two former presidents of Mexico, Miguel de la Madrid and Luis
Echevarria.
   The private sessions were a further sign of the warmer climate
between the Vatican and Mexico, which retains some of the most
restrictive religious laws outside the Communist world though they
are widely ignored.
   John Paul also held talks Monday morning with Salinas. The
president named a personal representative to the pope in February
in a possible step toward re-establishment of diplomatic ties
broken in 1926.
   Opposition politicians have criticized Salinas for what they say
is a cynical attempt to shore up the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party's flagging support through rapprochement with
the church.
   ``The whole world can see the political intentions in all
this,'' leftist opposition leader Cuauhtemoc Cardenas observed
after Salinas changed plans at the last minute and personally
greeted the pontiff when he arrived Sunday.
   The pontiff is making his second visit to Mexico and his 47th
papal trip outside Italy.

   Freezing cold iced the West today, bringing snow to the seaside
city of Monterey, Calif., while rain pelted the Midwest and
Northeast as harsh weather ushered in the first official day of
winter.
   The Arctic storm that chilled Western states most of the week
butted against warm humid air over the South to create a band of
freezing rain from central Texas to the Great Lakes, with up to an
inch of rainfall possible.
   Rain was forecast from Louisiana to southern Maine and the
entire state of Ohio was under a flood watch today.
   Snow fell from the Midwest to the California coast overnight and
temperatures dipped as low as wind-chilled 80 below in a mountain
pass near the Idaho-Montana border.
   Thousands remained without power in the Seattle area for the
fourth day and some who resorted to burning barbecue briquettes
were hospitalized with carbon monoxide poisoning.
   All of Montana had subzero temperatures today, with lows down to
45 below. ``We still have cold air coming down from the north,''
said Randy Calaway of the National Weather Service in Great Falls.
   In Nevada, temperatures fell below zero as far south as a town
called Caliente, the Spanish word for hot. Fountains on the
glittery Las Vegas Strip beat back fingers of ice in 20-degree
temperatures.
   Ice and snow prompted New Mexico Gov. Garrey Carruthers to close
state offices in Santa Fe today, giving more than 6,000 state
workers an early holiday.
   Eight inches of snow fell at Gallup, N.M., where a recreation
center was converted to an overnight shelter for stranded
travelers. Gallup Police Chief Frank Gonzales issued an appeal to
citizens to help drunks found outdoors.
   ``Different people calling us report drunks laying out on the
sidewalks and that the snow is covering them,'' Gonzales said. ``I
wish they would help us by taking them inside, and we could pick
them up then.''
   In Wyoming, temperatures down to 40 below caused an electrical
transmission line to contract and snap early today, leaving an
estimated 10,000 people in the Jackson area without power. The
outage prevented the Jackson Hole Ski Resort from operating.
   San Francisco had a record low for the date Thursday at 34
degrees, falling one degree below the 1908 mark. In Monterey, to
the south, the snow was a rare occurrence.
   ``I think it was really great. I really like snow,'' said Althea
Heard-Thompson, a restaurant manager who described the 15-minute
snowfall as ``really light, large flakes'' that melted quickly.
   In Los Angeles, free blankets offered on Skid Row were gone by
noon Thursday, and all city shelters were filled. In downtown San
Diego, a homeless man apparently trying to keep warm suffered
severe electrical burns after crawling into a transformer box,
police said.
   The storm system was blamed for at least 13 deaths since
Tuesday, in Washington, Iowa, Oregon, California and Oklahoma.
   Snow fell heavily in the Sierra Nevada, with up to 1{ feet at
Mammoth Mountain ski area, where less than a week ago the resort
opened a soup kitchen for seasonal workers left jobless by lack of
snow.
   In Colorado, snowfall closed Wolf Creek pass and the Wolf Creek
ski area. But the weather thrilled ski industry officials.
   ``This is clearly a holiday bonus,'' said Cathy Kruzic,
spokeswoman for Colorado Ski Country USA. ``It's wonderful
powder.''
   Washington state, first hit by the Arctic storm, got no relief
today.
   ``We're packed wall-to-wall,'' said Calvin McVey, director of
the 206-bed Gospel Mission homeless shelter in Seattle, where
another 145 people slept on the floor.
   About 18,000 homes and businesses remained in the dark overnight
and utility spokeswoman Teri Van Duine said some could be without
power for the weekend.
   Five people came to Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle
with carbon monoxide poisoning after using charcoal briquettes
indoors or improperly ventilated portable heaters and generators,
spokeswoman Rena Shawver said.
   Sinking temperatures and winds gusting to nearly 60 mph snapped
power cables in Utah and up to 2 feet of new snow prompted
avalanche warnings.
   Physicians say the wind-chilled temperatures are not to be taken
lightly.
   ``Below a minus 25 degrees wind chill, that's when it's
dangerous,'' said Dr. Robert Harms, an emergency room physician at
a Sioux Falls, S.D. hospital. ``If you have exposed skin, it can
freeze in one minute or less.''
   Weather-related traffic deaths killed four people in Northern
California, five in Oregon and one in Oklahoma. In Washington, a
man was fatally crushed by a falling tree and a homeless man froze
to death in Seattle.
   An 11-year-old girl in Iowa was killed when the truck she was
riding in lost control on an ice-covered highway and was hit by a
truck.
   On the eastern side of the Arctic front, heavy rain caused the
Ohio River to flood low-lying roads.
   Two teen-agers rescued a 79-year-old woman near Whipple, Ohio,
when her car stalled in 5 feet of water. A Marietta attorney said
he may have to hire a boat to get guests to his daughter's wedding
Saturday because of flooded roads.
   Fifteen people were evacuated from their homes in northeastern
Arkansas early today when a line of strong thunderstorms caused
flooding in the towns of Paragould and Bono.

   Pope John Paul II said Tuesday the
church and state in Mexico are reaching a better understanding and
issued a veiled appeal for a repeal of the decades-old
constitutional ban on Catholic schools.
   ``Open the world of teaching to Christ!'' the pope cried in a
speech to a crowd that included many schoolteachers.
   Later, before the biggest throng of the trip, John Paul called
on young Mexicans not to lose hope in the face of injustice and
poverty and to seize faith in Christ as a weapon against despair.
   Many of today's young are ``wounded by despair,'' the pope said,
citing ``evasion, abandon, hedonism, discotheques, drugs,
indifference, pessimism, the artificial paradises in which so many
find refuge.''
   Thousands of youths waved white, yellow and green handkerchiefs,
pennants and caps as the pope spoke to more than 200,000 people
gathered on the slopes of a bowl in the hills at San Juan de Los
Lagos, about 50 miles south of Aguascalientes.
   The pope's talks to the youth of Mexico and their teachers came
on the third day of his second trip to Mexico.
   On Tuesday night, back in Mexico City, the pope met with the
foreign diplomatic corps and urged a more moral approach to the
problems of refugees and the foreign debt.
   ``I feel the obligation to underline ... the ethical dimension
of this imprisoning crisis,'' the pontiff said, speaking about the
foreign debt.
   Mexico has a $93 billion foreign debt, second highest in the
developing world after Brazil.
   In Aguascalientes, 275 miles northwest of Mexico City, the pope
stopped off at the airport before flying on to San Juan. Because
the pope did not enter the city, replicas of downtown colonial
buildings were installed as a backdrop to his speech to teachers.
   John Paul, speaking under a white parasol to ward off the
blazing sun, noted recent increased contacts between the Vatican
and Mexico, whose constitution has harsh restrictions on religious
activity.
   ``A new perspective of contacts between the church and the
political community of this country is occurring in this day,'' the
pope said. ``And in this phase of better understanding and
dialogue, the church wants to offer its own support, without
straying from its specific goals and abilities.''
   It was the pope's most direct public comment on the gradual
relaxation of the church-state relationship in Mexico that was
symbolized when President Carlos Salinas de Gortari met John Paul
at the Mexico City airport on Sunday.
   The 1917 constitution says all schools must be government-run,
with a curriculum set by federal authorities.
   In practice, however, Catholic schools and universities have
long existed and are growing in number. In one of the paradoxes
that characterizes church-state relations, many government leaders
send their children to Catholic schools, which are generally
considered of higher quality.
   The pontiff said he hoped that Mexicans would overcome the idea
raised by critics that the church had obstructed cultural and
scientific progress.
   ``It is enough to remember the secular educative efforts of the
religious and ecclesiastical institutions, from the first
evangelization until the present day,'' he said.
   The church lost the right to religious schools because its
liberal opponents during the late 19th and early 20th centuries
believed it was a regressive force in Mexico that retarded social
progress.
   The pope drew wild cheers when he spontaneously saluted the
``corazones calientes,'' or ``hot hearts,'' of Aguascalientes,
which means hot waters and refers to the area's thermal springs.
   The throng did ``the wave'' and also waved white handkerchiefs
and flags bearing the image of the pope.
   John Paul then traveled to the nearby shrine of the Virgin of
San Juan de los Lagos. The 18th-century sanctuary, in a pink stone
basilica, contains an image of the Virgin made of corn husks.
Millions of pilgrims annually pay homage to the statue, which was
credited with resurrecting a dead little girl in 1623.
   I the afternoon Mass for youth, the pontiff's homily was
interrupted for minutes at a time by cheers and chants. When the
pope asked if those present would allow themselves to be tricked by
drugs, hedonism or false ideologies, they roared ``No.''
   ``Young people, don't lose hope, you are pilgrims of hope,'' the
pontiff said.
   John Paul called the Mass for youth ``the moment of my trip to
Mexico that I have most looked forward to.'' The pope has a special
affection for the young, and in Mexico, about 65 percent of the
population is under 29.
   John Paul appeared sunburned after a day in the sun even though
he spoke from the protection of a canopy. Priests on the temporary
altar at San Juan wore yellow baseball caps to shield themselves.
   John Paul's eight-day visit is his 47th trip outside Italy as
pope and his 10th journey to Latin America.
