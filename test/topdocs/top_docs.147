'Light of Day': Good Song, Bad Movie
---
By Julie Salamon</HL>
<DD> 02/12/87</DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO>
<TEXT>
   Paul Schrader assembled almost all the right ingredients for "Light of Day," the rock melodrama he wrote and directed -- a girl rebelling against a religious fanatic mom; an illegitimate child; incestuous impulses between a brother and a sister; a working-class rock band; and a title song by Bruce Springsteen. 

   He didn't skimp on the cast either: Gena Rowlands, rock star Joan Jett, teen idol Michael J. Fox. 
Yet there it lies: flat, ugly, dull. 

   The movie looks as though Mr. Schrader was so thoroughly ashamed of the high-gloss prettiness of his more recent movies -- "American Gigolo," "Cat People," "Mishima" -- that he took a vow of visual poverty for this picture. 
True, it's supposed to take place in working-class Cleveland. 
But there are interesting ways to shoot run-down joints -- all of which Mr. Schrader has avoided. 

   He has done little to make his characters shine through the drabness. 
He seems tired of reworking his old themes -- obsessed characters, repressed pasts. 
Too bad, because his main character in "Light of Day" -- a young woman rock singer named Patti -- has lots of potential. 
Joan Jett plays her with a commanding growl of a voice and demonic, arched eyebrows. 
From time to time her intensity forces life into the film. 
But Mr. Schrader keeps undercutting her. 
He's shot the rock-and-roll scenes without the gimmickry of rock videos, which is commendable. 
But there must be something between overstylized video imagery and this lifeless stuff; beer commercials carry more of a wallop. 
Ms. Jett makes something out of Patti despite the lines Mr. Schrader has given her. 

   "I've been trying to live my life by an idea," she says, pointing to a video game. 
"See that machine. 
That's an idea. 
Rock and roll. 
That's an idea." 

   She might actually have something there, but you can't tell because the speech pops out of no context, like a Pac-Man fruit. 
But I'd rather be puzzled than led by the nose as so often happens in this talky picture, where characters tend to tell you what makes them tick before you've noticed that they're ticking. 

   Like Ms. Jett, Poor Gena Rowlands is all revved up to play a part that wasn't written. 
She's supposed to be a fundamentalist mom (Christian magazines sit on the coffee table). 
Mostly she seems disconnected from this world and plugged in somewhere else. 
Mr. Schrader saves her for a big deathbed scene that would seem manipulative if it were better staged. 
Jason Miller, the respectable actor given the part of the father, fares worse. 
He plays a lump. 

   Mr. Fox deserves some credit for making something out of a second-fiddle role: Patti's brother, Joe, the mediator. 
He's a familiar type, the "good" kid who's always trying to smooth things out between a rebellious sibling and parents. 
It's a lousy job, especially since he knows that deep down the parents often yearn most for the affection of the child who's holding back. 
Mr. Fox and Ms. Jett play well off one another, despite jarring differences in the way they speak. 
They make you believe Joe doesn't have a girlfriend because he's in love with his sister. 
And the picture's one light moment shows Patti abruptly kicking the one girl Joe does bring home right out the door. 

   The movie only hints at what drives Patti to the road and the grungy gigs that sustain her. 
But Mr. Schrader does show a tender side to Ms. Jett, one she hides on stage, in scenes with Patti's child and her mother. 
In the end, that's a far more interesting revelation than the Big Secret Mr. Schrader lets drop in the movie's final moments. 

   The strongest part of the picture may well be the title song, donated by Bruce Springsteen after he borrowed the movie's original title for another song: "Born in the U.S.A." 
They don't call him The Boss for nothing. 

   ---
   "84 Charing Cross Road" is sentimental hokum, the kind of literary corn best suited to the kind of people who set their nice things on doilies. 
Still, it's well-done hokum, a nice afternoon wallow. 

   The story -- originally an autobiography, then a play -- follows the somewhat precious 20-year correspondence between Helene Hanff and Frank Doel. 
She's a studiously zany New York writer; he manages a rare-book store in England. 
They never meet, so reality never interferes with their bookish, epistolary romance. 

   Director David Jones (who directed the film version of "Betrayal") has done a decent job of managing the problem of two main characters who never appear on screen simultaneously and who "speak" only in letters. 
It helps that he has the mellifluous voice of Anthony Hopkins (who plays Frank). 
And Anne Bancroft actually benefits from having us see her actions while her voice narrates; it tones her down. 

   The main gimmick of back-and-forthing between London and New York wears a bit thin after awhile, but this movie has its own weepy charm. 

   ---
   Mr. Hopkins also appears in another picture: "The Good Father," originally made for British television. 
The director has succeeded in his misguided ambition of making all his characters disagreeable -- but he does at least offer an interesting alternative to the "Kramer vs. 
Kramer" theory of single parenting. 
This dad does not make a better mom than mom. 
After engaging in a vicious custody battle, he confesses he resents his own child for taking away his wife's love. 
Hooray for honesty, even if it isn't pretty.

<HEAD>Joan Jett's Lawsuit Against Playboy Dismissed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge dismissed a $6.5 million libel lawsuit
in which rock star Joan Jett claimed Playboy magazine hurt her
reputation by mistakenly identifying her as a woman posing
seductively in a bathtub.
   State Judge Eugene Nardelli threw out the lawsuit after Jett
twice failed to appear for court-ordered depositions with Playboy
lawyers, the New York Post reported today.
   The photograph appeared in Playboy's May 1982 issue. After Jett
filed the lawsuit, the magazine printed a correction, and the Retna
Photo Agency, which supplied the picture, destroyed it.
   Jett's attorney, Steven Kramer, said the photograph caused Jett
``to be shamed, held up to public disgrace in the community in
which she lives and injured her reputation.''
   But Nancy Wolff, representing Retna, said the lawsuit was
frivolous.
   ``The purpose seems to be to obtain continuing publicity for the
rock star Joan Jett while forcing the defendants to run up
unwarranted legal bills,'' Wolff said.
   The photograph actually was of a member of Jett's former band,
the Runaways. She was in a tub wearing fishnet stockings and a
fringed vest, with strategically positioned bubbles, the Post said.
   Jett, on a nationwide tour, could not be reached for comment,
the Post said.

   Confidence isn't a problem for English
singer John Wesley Harding. This is, after all, a 24-year-old who's
written updates of the Rolling Stones' ``Sympathy for the Devil''
and the Everly Brothers' ``Cathy's Clown'' on his debut album.
   Identity, however, might not be such a sure thing.
   ``Bob Dylan is my father,'' sings the man who takes his stage
name from Dylan's 1968 album. ``Joan Baez is my mother. And I am
their bastard son.''
   It's a joke, of course. Harding turns the tables on fans who
love to spot the influences in a musician's work. His debut album,
``Here Comes the Groom,'' is a feast of word games and
sound-alikes, as well as a showcase for a promising beginner.
   ``I hate people who claim that they're not influenced by people
they're obviously influenced by _ like the Jesus and Mary Chain and
the Velvet Underground. I mean, give me a break,'' said the
precocious young singer.
   ``I decided to be completely the opposite. To be playful, I
claimed that Bob Dylan is my father and Joan Baez is my mother,
which is obviously ridiculous.''
   The real-life Wesley Harding Stace is quick to slyly note that
Dylan and Baez were touring England together the year he was born
in Hastings. Growing up, Stace wanted to be a sportswriter. He
studied English Literature at Cambridge University, writing a
doctoral dissertation on the role of Jimmy Stewart in American
films.
   He also wrote plays, short stories and songs. Armed with an
acoustic guitar, he regularly performed his songs and others in
pubs around Cambridge and, in true music business fashion, was
``discovered'' there.
   There was little calculation in the name change, he said. Stace
took the name John Wesley Harding because his solo performances
were ``kind of Dylan-y.''
   ``I think changing your name is quite cool because nobody seems
to do it right now,'' he said. ``Everybody worries about integrity.
I couldn't imagine Tracy Chapman changing her name.''
   Harding was signed to the independent British label Demon
Records and put out his first record in 1988.
   Which brings up another comparison. Demon is Elvis Costello's
label. So is Warner Bros., home of Harding's U.S. debut. So is
Plangent Visions Music, Harding's song publishing company.
Two-thirds of Costello's old backup band, the Attractions, play on
Harding's album. And, in spots, Harding's voice sounds chillingly
like Costello's.
   Coincidence? Harding thinks so.
   ``Critics have got to do it. They've got to put you somewhere,''
he said. ``It's like saying to a critic, `describe John Wesley
Harding without making reference to Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello,
Graham Parker, Nick Lowe and the Byrds.' It's like saying describe
a tennis ball without saying it's round or it's a ball. I don't
particularly object to it.
   ``But it's very foolhardy in a way. Clearly the songs that I
write are nothing like Elvis Costello songs.''
   Indeed, such lines as ``if there's a nuclear winter, at least it
will snow,'' show a sense of humor Costello took a while to reveal.
   ``He writes great songs and they're cruel, they're untender,''
he said. ``They're inhumane sometimes. ... My songs are very
gentle, optimistic. They're meant to be very charming. I can't see
any similarity in the lyrical outlook whatsoever.''
   Don't look for a lyric sheet on the album, even though words
tumble out of Harding's mouth as fast as he can take a breath.
   ``I used to buy John Hiatt albums and by the time I got back to
the house I read all the lyrics and it ruined the album for me,''
he said. ``My big thing is the shape of the song. I don't want you
to know where the song is going to end, or where the bridge is.
It's a little bit of oral drama.''
   Harding's song, ``The Devil in Me,'' is a sampling of the
world's ills, from war to acid rain. ``Put it down to the devil in
me,'' he sings as the narrator for those responsible.
   Harding calls it a ``folk sample'' of ``Sympathy for the
Devil.'' He said he wanted to do a politically responsible version
of the ``amoral'' Rolling Stones song.
   The song ``Cathy's New Clown'' refers to the Everly Brothers
classic only with a brief touch of the melody during the fadeout.
Harding wanted to update the emotions expressed in the nearly
30-year-old song.
   The tunes on Harding's solo album are breezy and punchy. Only a
duet with Peter Case sounds as if it were a traditional folk song
with acoustic guitars.
   ``I don't want to make folk music,'' Harding said. ``All my
favorite songwriters do folk music, but they're all dead or dirt
poor. Phil Spector is my hero. I like Phil Spector. I like ABBA. I
actually liked the Carpenters. They were great songs.''
   Harding's now doing the dirty work of slowly trying to build an
audience in the United States, touring as an opening act for
artists such as Michelle Shocked and the Mighty Lemon Drops. He's
not working with a band now, but promises a band tour this fall.
   ``It's not the divine right of a support act to have everyone
like them,'' he said. ``If they find the idea of one man playing an
acoustic guitar horrible, then I let them get into the humor of
some things. I want to give them a chance to get into me.''

   The new book ``Ain't Nothin' as Sweet as My
Baby'' contains a picture of country singer Jett Williams at the
age of 2 playing a toy guitar.
   It is a telling photograph, because Jett grew up to discover
that she was the daughter of country music legend Hank Williams.
   ``That fascinated me when I knew that Hank Williams was my
father, to think back on how I always played guitar and always
sang,'' she says. ``It made me feel really good, as if it was
something he left me.''
   Jett Williams tells her story in the book, how she was adopted
first by Hank Williams' mother and after her death by a Mobile,
Ala., couple named Deupree who tell her that Hank might be her
father but there's no proof and nothing can be done.
   Jett launches a search and learns that she's the daughter of
Bobbie Jett and Hank Williams. In the last five years, she has been
through many courts. There's big money involved but Jett says that
finding her roots, not money, was paramount. Her legal name is
Cathy Deupree Adkinson. Her stage name combines the last names of
her parents.
   Don Helms and Jerry Rivers, longtime members of Hank Williams'
band, the Drifting Cowboys, have embraced her. So far this year,
Jett and the Drifting Cowboys Band have played some 40 dates. ``I
really love it,'' she says of her traditional country show. ``I'm
having the time of my life.''
   The hardest thing in her search, Jett said, was discovering that
her mother had died. ``I had put so much stock in that she was
going to be able to answer all my questions.'' It was also
difficult to accept that her mother voluntarily gave her up.
   The best thing about Williams' search, she says, was meeting
Keith Adkinson, the Washington lawyer who took her case and is now
her second husband. He calls her B.J. because documents that he
found read ``in re: the matter of Baby Jett.'' He manages her
career and practices law, with ``Jett law'' taking the largest
share of his time.
   ``Also wonderful was finding the pre-birth contract and finding
out that Hank Williams was my father and that he wanted me,'' she
said in an interview. ``It was a wonderful emotional cushion for me
to land on.''
   On Oct. 15, 1952, Bobbie Jett and Hank Williams signed a
three-page, notarized document which said that he would give her a
plane ticket to California within a month after she gave birth and
he would pay hospital and doctor bills and support their child, who
would live with his mother for two years then live with him.
   ``I think it tells a lot about my father as a human being. He
loved me before I was born; he took me sight unseen. To me it's the
greatest compliment a father could give a child.'' Hank Williams
died Jan. 1, 1953, five days before his daughter was born.
   In 1985, Hank Williams Jr. sued in Alabama and Jett Williams
sued in federal court in New York over Williams' estate. In 1987,
the lower court in Alabama said Hank Williams Jr. was sole heir to
the estate of Hank Williams, who died without a will, and Jett
Williams was named a child of Hank Williams. In 1989, the Supreme
Court of Alabama ruled that Jett had been the victim of fraud, by
people who tried to keep her from finding out her parentage, and
said she can share in the estate.
   Still to come is a trial in New York regarding copywright of
Williams' songs. Will his two children and second wife share song
royalties equally or will the widow get half and the children get a
quarter each and from what year shall the daughter start collecting
her share?
   Among Williams' some 150 songs are ``Your Cheatin' Heart,''
``Hey, Good Lookin','' ``Jambalaya,'' ``Settin' the Woods on Fire''
and ``I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,'' his daughter's favorite.
   Yet to be decided, in Alabama, is how Jett Williams shares in
Hank Williams' estate.
   She and Hank Williams Jr. haven't met, but she said she would
like them to meet and talk.
   She wrote the book, published by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, ``to
tell the story of the search, frustrations, fighting, losing,
winning, setting the record straight in the court system. To me,
that's the story. That's why I ended the book before I knew about
the money.''
   This spring, Jett went to the Country Music Museum in Nashville
and had Williams' guitar handed to her to play. ``I'd seen a tie of
his and one of his suits behind glass but it was the only thing of
his I'd ever touched.'' She was thrilled.
   In 1949, Hank Williams wrote ``There's Nothin' as Sweet as My
Baby.'' His daughter heard a radio transcription of him introducing
it as ``Ain't Nothin' as Sweet as My Baby.'' She used that as her
book title.
   The lyric includes the description, ``Golden hair and big blue
eyes.''
   ``Of all the songs he wrote, that seemed to be custom made for
me,'' Jett said. ``He wrote it years before I was born but I like
to think he might have daydreamed what it would be like if he had a
little baby girl.''

   Oprah Winfrey, dubbed an ``unforgettable woman''
in a new cosmetics ad, says she hopes the designation will inspire
young blacks.
   ``As a child, it never occurred to me I might be considered
beautiful, because none of the models looked like me,'' Ms. Winfrey
said Tuesday in USA Today. ``If just one little black girl sees the
photo and thinks she's beautiful because she sees a part of herself
in me, I will be grateful.''
   A photo composite by Richard Avedon of the newly slim,
leotard-clad talk-show host appears in ``W'' with a dozen more
magazines to follow.
   Ms. Winfrey was chosen because of a beauty that is ``heightened
by her intelligence and softened by her warmth and good humor,''
said Revlon Chairman Ronald O. Perelman.
   Liza Minnelli, Brooke Shields and Audrey Hepburn preceded Ms.
Winfrey as ``unforgettable women'' in the ad campaign.

   The fiddlin', footstompin' Beanblossom music
festival is back by popular demand, bluegrass patriarch Bill Monroe
has decreed.
   Monroe, 77, has held the festival on his 94-acre farm near
Beanblossom for 22 years, but shocked fans last year by announcing
he had had enough and planned to sell the farm.
   Monroe, who had colon cancer surgery nine years ago, said then
that he was tired of the road and wanted to spend more time at his
home near Nashville, Tenn. But when countless letters and phone
calls from disappointed fans poured in, coupled with an improvement
in Monroe's health and no quick buyers for the farm, the musician
reversed himself.
   ``I feel pretty good. I'm in better shape than I was last year,''
Monroe told the Indianapolis Star on Monday. ``Everybody thought I
should slow down and maybe I did, too. But I feel so much better.''
   This year's festival will be June 15-18.

   Wendy Wasserstein has won the Susan Smith
Blackburn Prize for ``The Heidi Chronicles,'' her play about one
woman's search for self-fulfillment from the 1960s to the present.
   The play, which opened off-Broadway in December to critical
acclaim, moves to Broadway next week. Wasserstein, 38, established
her reputation as a wry social commentator with her off-Broadway
hit, ``Isn't It Romantic.''
   The $5,000 prize was awarded Monday to the playwright by actress
Jessica Tandy during a ceremony in New York.
   Timberlake Wertenbaker, a British playwright, was awarded a
$1,000 runner-up prize for her play ``Our Country's Good,'' set in
18th-century Australia. The prize was established in 1978 to honor
Susan Blackburn, the American actress and author who died in 1977.

   Rocker Joan Jett on Broadway? Hey, it's a dream
come true for the leather-clad singer who received a Grammy nominee
for her single ``I Hate Myself for Loving You.''
   ``When I was about 11, I was in a drama class and I wanted to
grow up and be an actress. I wanted to be on Broadway,'' Jett told
the Daily News on Tuesday. ``So in a weird way, I guess that came
true.''
   Jett opens a sold-out five-day run at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater
Wednesday with the Blackhearts _ a band she says epitomizes the true
spirit of rock 'n' roll.
   ``There are a lot of bands out there today that call themselves
rock 'n' roll when they really aren't,'' said Jett. ``To me, rock
'n' roll is a very sacred, spontaneous thing _ like Chuck Berry, the
Rolling Stones, the Who.''

   Premier Andreas Papandreou's daughter says
her father's live-in girlfriend has isolated him from his family.
   Sofia Papandreou-Katsaneva, 34, told the left-wing daily
Eleftherotypia Tuesday that the girlfriend, Dimitra Liani, had
ruined her relationship with her father. ``I can't believe that
everything that's happened has happened with his volition,'' she
said.
   Papandreou, 70, has been living with the 34-year-old airline
stewardess since he underwent open-heart surgery in September. He
has asked for a divorce from his wife of 38 years, Margaret, but
they have yet to work out the details.
   The Liani affair, his health and several financial scandals have
hurt Papandreou's standing among Greek voters, a public opinion poll
published Tuesday in the daily Ethnos indicated. The poll showed
Papandreou's popularity had slipped to 14.4 percent as compared to
18 percent for the leader of the main conservative opposition New
Democracy Party.

   The music academy gave viewers a mixed message
with its 31st Grammy show, showcasing new faces like Metallica and
Sinead O'Conner on stage but giving awards to veterans like Tina
Turner and Jethro Tull.
   Two new faces who did do well were Bobby McFerrin, who won four
Grammys, including best song, record and pop male vocal performance
for ``Don't Worry, Be Happy,'' and Tracy Chapman, who was voted best
new artist, best pop female vocal and best contemporary folk artist
based on her ``Tracy Chapman'' album and the song ``Fast Car.''
   In between awards, Melissa Etheridge performed ``Bring Me Some
Water'' O'Connor did ``Mandinka'' and Toni Childs ``Don't Walk
Away.'' Metallica performed ``One'' amid all the specal effects,
thunder and fire of a concert appearance.
   But when it came time to announce the winners, Turner beat out
Etheridge, O'Connor and Childs for best female rock vocal
performance, while hoary old Jethro Tull took the trophy in the new
category of best hard rock-heavy metal over newer and more radical
groups like Metallica and Jane's Addiction.
   ``We are getting more metal and hard rock members, but we have to
grow in this category,'' National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences president Michael Greene said backstage, explaining the
selection of Jethro Tull.
   Metallica's Lars Ulrich said before the show that none of the
members of his group belonged to the academy.
   Other old-shoe comforts the academy members slipped on for the
televised awards Wednesday at the Shrine Auditorium were:
   _Manhattan Transfer's ``Brasil,'' over Gloria Estefan and Miami
Sound Machine and over the Beach Boys, who stood to receive their
first-ever Grammy, for ``Kokomo.''
   _Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips' ``Love Overboard'' for best group
rhythm and blues performance over The Jets' ``Rocket 2 U'' and New
Edition's ``If It Isn't Love.''
   _U2's ``Desire'' as best rock group performance over the more
adventurous ``I Hate Myself For Loving You'' by Joan Jett and the
Blackhearts or ``Beds Are Burning'' by Midnight Oil.
   But there was a sense of change, at least backstage.
   Henry Mancini, the ``Pink Panther'' composer who has won 20
Grammys and dominated the awards in the early 1960s, lost in two
categories Wednesday night. He had to contend with the presence of
O'Connor, who wore torn jeans, heavy boots and skimpy top.
   O'Connor's nearly shaved head was decorated with a painted
insignia of her favorite band, rap group Public Enemy.
   ``Maybe she slept on a quarter. I don't know,'' Mancini said.

   Sir David Lean, the English filmmaker who
created ``Doctor Zhivago,'' ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' and
``Lawrence of Arabia,'' will receive a life achievement award from
his American counterparts.
   ``Lean joins a distinguished group of individuals who have made
enormous contributions to America's film heritage,'' Gene
Jankowski, chairman of the American Film Institute, said Thursday.
   ``You must be joking! This is remarkable,'' the 81-year-old Lean
responded when learning of the honor Wednesday, said filmmaker
Steven Spielberg, who broke the news as a trustee of the institute.
   Lean, the Life Achievement Award winner for 1990, joins 17
previous winners who include Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, James

Beverly Hills that will be broadcast by ABC-TV.
   Lean's hits include the 1957 Academy Award-winner ``The Bridge

   Singer Joan Jett abruptly ended a concert
after the first set when she was hit in the face with a bracelet
thrown from the crowd.
   Miss Jett spun away from the microphone holding her face
Thursday night, then kicked the mike stand over, strode to the edge
of the stage and shouted: ``Who ... did that?''
   Miss Jett left the stage, and a member of her road company
informed the crowd, ``The show is over, ladies and gentlemen. I'm
sorry, there had to be one jerk in the audience.''
   Miss Jett had a minor cut under her right eye, said Kasim
Sulton, bassist in her band the Blackhearts, after the show at a

   The bracelet thrower was never identified.
   Sulton said similar incidents happen ``fairly often'' on Miss

   Oddly enough, playing a broken-down alcoholic
helped Faye Dunaway's image.
   The 48-year-old actress says her acclaimed role in ``Barfly''
was ``a wonderful chance'' _ to work opposite Mickey Rourke and to
undo some of the negative publicity lingering from 1981's ``Mommie
Dearest.''
   ``Mickey Rourke comes to me in a Chinese restaurant downtown and
says, `I'm doin' this thing, you wanna do it?''' Dunaway said in
the Oct. 16 issue of US magazine.
   ``I thought: Great, deglamorize, get some soul out there. Turn
the perception around.''
   Dunaway, nominated for Academy Awards for her performances in
``Bonnie and Clyde'' and ``Chinatown'' and a winner for
``Network,'' was ridiculed for her overwrought portrayal of Joan
Crawford in ``Mommie Dearest.''
   ``It was a movie that didn't achieve what it set out to do,''
she said. ``It just went too far and became camp.''

people aboard. McEntire was not on the jet.;    The twin-engine Hawker
Siddeley took off about 1:45 a.m. from Brown Field, a municipal airstrip near

which rises to 3,572 feet about 10 miles east of the airport, officials for
the Federal Aviation Administration said.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  COUNTRY SINGER REBA MCENTIRE'S BAND DIES
IN CRASH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Investigators said body parts and wreckage from the crash were strewed over
the snow-capped south side of the mountain. The plane was en route to
Amarillo, Texas, for refueling and then to Fort Wayne, Ind., where McEntire
had a concert scheduled Saturday night.;    She canceled that concert and
another scheduled for today at Evansville, Ind., said her spokeswoman, Trisha
McClanahan. However, McEntire is expected to appear at the Academy Awards
presentation on March 25.;    McEntire had performed with the band Friday
evening in a private concert in San Diego for IBM executives. The popular
singer, named female vocalist of the year four times by the Country Music
Association, and her husband, Narvel Blackstock, who is also her manager, flew
out in another plane later Saturday, McClanahan said.;    'Totally
devastated';  "She was very close to all of them. Some of them had been with
her for years. Reba is totally devastated by this. It's like losing part of
your family. Right now she just wants to get back to Nashville," said Jennifer
Bohler, another McEntire spokeswoman.;    The plane was chartered from
Prestige Touring in Dallas. An official familiar with the company said the
crew members killed in the crash, Capt. Don Holms and first officer Chris
Hollinger, were experienced pilots. Their ages and hometowns were not
released.;    The eight members of McEntire's entourage who died in the crash
are tour manager Jim Hammon, 40; band leader and keyboardist Kirk Cappello,
28; vocalist Paula Kaye Evans, 33; guitarist Michael Thomas, 34; bass
guitarist Terry Jackson, 28; keyboardist Joey Cigainero, 27; drummer Anthony
Saputo, 34; and Chris Austin, 27, a vocalist who played fiddle and acoustic
guitar. All the band members lived in Nashville, Tenn., said Bohler.;   
George D. Dickason, an investigator with the San Diego County medical
examiner, said the "extensive trauma" to the victims was so severe that none
of the 10 bodies could be identified.;    The aircraft was being flown
visually, without clearance or guidance from an air traffic control tower,
said Elly Brekke, a spokeswoman for the FAA.;    No flight-data recorder; 
Learning exactly what happened will be difficult because the British-made jet
apparently had no flight-data recorder, said National Transportation Safety
Board investigator Jeff Rich. In September, FAA regulations will require all
turbine-powered jets like the Hawker Siddeley to carry such devices, he said.  </TEXT>

   Three years ago, it was hard to turn on the
radio without hearing Joan Jett pound it out, or Madonna whine or
Cyndi Lauper tell us that girls just like to have fun. Women had a
dominant role in the rock scene.
   However, at this year's Grammy Awards, to be presented on March
2 at Radio City Music Hall, female rockers are an extinct breed:
There's no category, as there has been in the past, for ``best rock
vocal performance, female.''
   The Grammys have separate categories for men and women singers
in pop and rhythm 'n' blues. The rock category combines them this
year. Tina Turner, the grandmother of rock who was named best
female rock vocalist last year, is nominated along with Richard
Marx, Bob Seger, Bruce Springsteen and Joe Cocker.
   Al Schlesinger, president of the National Academy of Recording
Arts and Sciences, said NARAS has a rule that the 6,000 industry
professionals who are members must nominate 10 different people in
a category for that category to exist.
   The screening committee listens to each nomination and decides
whether it has been nominated in the right place. If it isn't, it's
moved to where the committee decides it belongs.
   ``Record company executives will always try and enter things in
smaller categories where there's less competition,'' Schlesinger
said. ``We don't accept that.
   ``If we don't end up with 10 nominations in a category, rather
than having insufficient competition, we fold that category into
another one. It doesn't happen often.''
   Another rule, which RCA executive Dennis Fine unsuccessfully
fought this year, is that the rock vocal performance nominations
must be from solo albums; lead singers of groups aren't eligible.
   ``Grace Slick's `Babylon' is a rock 'n' roll track and a great
solo on a Starship album. Unless she does her own solo album, it's
not considered a solo,'' Fine said. ``It all depends on how a
record is billed. It's not fair. Sade is considered to be a group.
The screening committee eliminated Patty Smythe and Cyndi Lauper
from rock in the past. They determined they were pop.''
   During the decade, performers such as Tina Turner, Madonna,
Cyndi Lauper, Sheena Easton, Laura Branigan, Joan Jett, Pat
Benatar, Annie Lennox, Chaka Khan, Donna Summer, Debbie Harry and
Grace Jones took rock in new directions with their strong images
and hot music.
   Are these same female rockers _ and others _ suddenly in short
supply? The answer to that depends on who you ask. Bob Guccione Jr.
thinks there are lots; Bill Graham thinks there are few.
   Guccione, publisher of Spin magazine, is incensed that the
female rock vocalist category was eliminated.
   ``This is literally a disservice to both males and females,'' he
said. ``I think, if anything, the last year to two years has
represented the emergence of the female rock superstar. It started
with Madonna and it's really just blossoming.
   ``My favorite is Maria McKee on `Wheels.' There were a lot of
great performances last year _ Grace Jones' `I May Not Be Perfect
But I'm Perfect for You,' Debbie Harry's `French Kissing in the
U.S.A.' Madonna is always to be considered. My perspective is that
this past year of all years, females performed better on the whole
than the males.''
   Graham, rock's best-known impresario, disagrees. ``It is an
irony and phenomenon of rock 'n' roll that there have been so few
women accepted commercially,'' he said. ``I really don't understand
why, other than the fact that the terminology of rock 'n' roll
sounds more masculine than feminine. The music has got a harder
edge sometimes.
   ``We have to generalize but a young rock 'n' roll male listener
may have a problem admitting that he's a fan of a female rock 'n'
roller, if his friends are into all-male groups. A woman rocker is
going to have to have that extra edge, so that he can't get that
song out of his head. Otherwise she'll lose.''
   However, in the '60s and early '70s, rock fans _ male and female
_ had no trouble following Janis Joplin and Grace Slick. Later,
male fans were just as enthusiastic as female fans at Joan Jett and
Pat Benatar concerts.
   But singer-songwriter Suzanne Vega, nominated for three Grammys
this year, including ``best pop vocal, female,'' agrees with Graham.
   ``When Rolling Stone ran its list of the Top 100 rock albums, I
noticed there were only about six women on this list,'' she said.
``Laura Nyro and Kate Bush have made brilliant albums but they
can't be considered rock 'n' roll.
   ``Rock 'n' roll is an aggressive, very male style of singing.
Some women fit into it naturally _ like Chrissie Hynde and Patty
Smythe. There are not many women, I think, who naturally take to
rock 'n' roll, but they do great music. I may have closet
tendencies in that direction, but I don't think of myself as a rock
'n' roller.''

The fall season is always the most active time for pop record releases, as the 
music industry gears up for its November-December season, during which nearly a 
third of all records, tapes and CDs are sold. But that can mean confusion for 
even the most serious music fans, as old favorites compete with newcomers for 
consumers' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the albums expected to generate the most critical and commercial 
interest of all the post-Labor Day releases during the hectic year-end rush. 
The selections, presented in alphabetical order, cover all parts of the pop 
music spectrum, from heavy-metal fathers (Aerosmith) and sons (L.A. Guns) to 
rap innovators (the D.O.C., Young M.C.); from rock kings on the rebound (Bob 
Dylan, the Rolling Stones) and pop queens living the lush life (Linda Ronstadt, 
Barbra Streisand) to country chartbusters (Randy Travis) and folkie mavericks 
(Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked). 
</P>
<P>
 The comments are by the Times pop writers indicated, but the star ratings (one 
is poor, five a classic) sometimes reflect additional pop staff input. 
</P>
<P>
 The reviewers are Robert Hilburn, Dennis Hunt, Mike Boehm, Richard Cromelin, 
Jonathan Gold, Steve Hochman, Connie Johnson, Craig Lee, Kristine McKenna, 
Randy Lewis, Don Snowden, Chris Willman, Paul Grein, Duff Marlowe and Don 
Waller.

*** HIGHWAY 101, "Paint the Town,"Warner Bros. The band can boast Paulette 
Carlson's dusky, tremulous lead vocals, twangy, Buck-inspired electric guitars 
and singing pedal steel lines, wrapped around a solid batch of songs in which 
lovers depart, hearts break and the losers and winners both wind up at the 
local honky-tonk. (Lewis) 
</P>
<P>
* OAK RIDGE BOYS, "American Dreams,"MCA. Had the original "Saturday Night Live" 
crew ever gotten around to a "Bad Country Music" skit, it couldn't have been 
any funnier -- or sadder -- than this is, albeit unintentionally. This 
compendium of cliches is as sincere as Joe Isuzu and as authentic as the 
synthesized accordion on an ersatz Cajun tune. (Lewis) 
</P>
<P>
*** POCO, "Legacy,"RCA. Granted, this reunion isn't quite up there with a 
Beatles comeback, but that's a bonus in this case, since there aren't 
stratospherically high expectations of this seminal country-rock group's five 
original members. There are a few modest love songs by Richie Furay and Jim 
Messina, a stone-country waltz from ex-Eagle Randy Meisner and plenty of 
luscious harmonies from all concerned. (Lewis)

Tracy Chapman won the nominations derby Thursday in the first leg of the record 
industry's 31st annual Grammy Awards competition. 
</P>
<P>
The folk-minded singer-songwriter's six nominations nosed out jazz singer Bobby 
McFerrin, who had five, and pop-jazz artist Anita Baker, who picked up four. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman's self-titled debut album, which has sold more than 2 million copies, 
features the hit single "Fast Car." Her nominations are for best record, album, 
song, pop vocal, contemporary folk record and new artist. 
</P>
<P>
If the 24-year-old Boston-based artist wins in all categories, it will be the 
biggest sweep in the history of the recording industry awards. Winners will be 
announced Feb. 22 during a nationally televised ceremony at the Shrine 
Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
McFerrin, who has won five jazz Grammys, was introduced to pop audiences 
through his hit single "Don't Worry, Be Happy." Besides being nominated for 
that record, he was also cited for best album ("Simple Pleasures"), pop vocal 
and song ("Don't Worry, Be Happy"). He was also nominated in the jazz vocal 
category for a work contained in Rob Wasserman's "Duets" album. 
</P>
<P>
Three-time winner Anita Baker, cited for her hit single "Giving You the Best 
That I Got," is competing in four categories -- best record and song as well as 
R &amp; B song and R &amp; B vocal. 
</P>
<P>
For best record, Baker's single, Chapman's "Fast Car" and McFerrin's "Don't 
Worry, Be Happy" are up against Michael Jackson's "Man in the Mirror" and Steve 
Winwood's "Roll With it." 
</P>
<P>
Winwood's single is from his "Roll With it" album, which is also up for album 
of the year. His competitors are Chapman, McFerrin, Sting (". . . Nothing Like 
the Sun") and George Michael ("Faith"). 
</P>
<P>
Winwood, who became the first artist to be nominated for best record three 
years in a row, was also nominated this year for best pop vocal. Sting, a 
four-time winner, is also up for three awards, including pop vocal and song 
("Be Still My Beating Heart"). 
</P>
<P>
For best song, a songwriters' award, Sting's challengers are Chapman, McFerrin, 
Baker and the team of Brenda Russell, Jeff Hall and Scott Cutler, who were 
nominated for "Piano in the Dark." 
</P>
<P>
This year's big surprise was the failure of British pop sensation George 
Michael to nab more than two nominations. Michael had figured to be among the 
leaders in nominations because his "Faith" album received generally favorable 
reviews and sold more than 6 million copies. Besides the "Faith" album 
nomination, Michael's only other nod was for pop vocal. 
</P>
<P>
In the best new artist category, Chapman is up against Rick Astley, Toni 
Childs, the group Take 6 and Vanessa Williams, the dethroned Miss America. 
Williams made the national pop charts last year with a single, "The Right 
Stuff." 
</P>
<P>
The winners in the 76 pop and classical categories will be determined by a vote 
of the more than 7,000 members of the National Assn. of Recording Arts and 
Sciences. Records released in the United States between Oct. 1, 1987, and Sept. 
30, 1988, were eligible. 
</P>
<P>
Two new categories were added this year: rap and hard-rock/metal. The rap 
nominees included L.L. Cool J, D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; the Fresh Prince, 
Salt-N-Pepa, J.J. Fad and Kool Moe Dee. In hard-rock/metal, the competitors are 
Metallica, AC-DC, Iggy Pop, Jethro Tull and Jane's Addiction. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, male and female rock vocal nominees were lumped together because 
there were too few eligible female entries. Since this was banner year for 
female rockers, they have their own category again. The rock female finalists 
are Pat Benatar, Melissa Etheridge, Toni Childs, Sinead O'Connor and Tina 
Turner. The male rock nominees are Eric Clapton, Rod Stewart, Robbie Robertson, 
Robert Palmer and Joe Cocker. 
</P>
<P>
Vying with Anita Baker for the female R&amp;B vocal award are Pebbles, Taylor 
Dayne, Karyn White and Vanessa Williams. 
</P>
<P>
The male R &amp; B contenders are Luther Vandross, Stevie Wonder, Terence Trent 
D'Arby, Teddy Pendergrass and Al B. Sure!. 
</P>
<P>
In country, the finalists in the best vocal category are Emmylou Harris, K.T. 
Oslin, K.D. Lang, Reba McEntire and Tanya Tucker. For the male award, the 
challengers are Dan Seals, Dwight Yoakam, Rodney Crowell, Randy Travis and Lyle 
Lovett. 
</P>
<P>
There were few surprises in the classical field. Perennial nominees Vladimir 
Horowitz, Robert Shaw, Georg Solti and Leonard Bernstein -- perhaps a 
sentimental favorite in his 70th year -- filled the best album choices. 
</P>
<P>
Trendy long shots from both early and new music appeared on some of the lists. 
Period specialists Roger Norrington and the London Classical Players received a 
best orchestral recording bid for their Beethoven's Ninth, and "Nixon in China" 
was an inevitable nominee for best opera recording. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the best opera list was "A Quiet Place," by Leonard Bernstein and 
Stephen Wadsworth. Those two new operas headed the best contemporary 
composition category, which was completed with William Bolcom's Symphony No. 4, 
Ned Rorem's String Symphony (a best-album pick in the Shaw performance), and 
"Amour" by Karlheinz Stockhausen.

The fall season is always the most active time for pop record releases, as the 
music industry gears up for its November-December season, during which nearly a 
third of all records, tapes and CDs are sold. But that can mean confusion for 
even the most serious music fans, as old favorites compete with newcomers for 
consumers' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the albums expected to generate the most critical and commercial 
interest of all the post-Labor Day releases during the hectic year-end rush. 
The selections, presented in alphabetical order, cover all parts of the pop 
music spectrum, from heavy-metal fathers (Aerosmith) and sons (L.A. Guns) to 
rap innovators (the D.O.C., Young M.C.); from rock kings on the rebound (Bob 
Dylan, the Rolling Stones) and pop queens living the lush life (Linda Ronstadt, 
Barbra Streisand) to country chartbusters (Randy Travis) and folkie mavericks 
(Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked). 
</P>
<P>
 The comments are by the Times pop writers indicated, but the star ratings (one 
is poor, five a classic) sometimes reflect additional pop staff input. 
</P>
<P>
 The reviewers are Robert Hilburn, Dennis Hunt, Mike Boehm, Richard Cromelin, 
Jonathan Gold, Steve Hochman, Connie Johnson, Craig Lee, Kristine McKenna, 
Randy Lewis, Don Snowden, Chris Willman, Paul Grein, Duff Marlowe and Don 
Waller. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 AEROSMITH, "Pump,"Geffen. In this era of total Aerosmithification, the 
band comes out with an oddly non-Aerosmithy album. The hooks are of the 
lightweight, catchy variety, and the songs are stripped down to the point where 
they seem almost pop sketches. (Gold) 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 THE D.O.C., "Nobody Does It Better,"Ruthless/Atlantic. This year's hot 
hard-core hip-hop sound comes from Dr. Dre, the Compton deejay behind Ruthless 
Records, which in the last several months has released million-selling rap LPs 
by J.J. Fad, Eazy-E and N.W.A. Dre has transformed this Texan into something of 
a Compton-style Big Daddy Kane, a guy who plays the English language the way 
Itzhak Perlman plays a Strad. (Gold) 
</P>
<P>
** FASTER PUSSYCAT, "Wake Me When It's Over,"Elektra. Faster Pussycat is rock 
'n' roll about marketing rock 'n' roll, the hard-rock answer to the Pet Shop 
Boys. Their neo-Sweet second album is, if anything, even less glossy than their 
decidedly unglossy debut, funny, fast and clever. (Gold) 
</P>
<P>
*** ICE-T, "Freedom of Speech . . . Just Watch What You Say,"Sire. Wherein the 
lisping legend in leather listens hard to N.W.A, funks up his beats and finally 
makes the awesome hardcore gangster-rap album you always knew he had in him. 
After all, he invented the genre. It's crude -- if this LP didn't offend you, 
it wouldn't be doing its job -- but effective. His best one yet. (Gold) 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 BIG DADDY KANE, "It's a Big Daddy Thing,"Cold Chillin'/Reprise. Kane 
has always been the most virtuosic of hardcore rappers, fast-flowing rivulets 
of words leaping and splashing across the beat. Finally he has rhythm tracks as 
smooth as his seamless rhymes and beats that are funky enough. Definitely the 
street-rap record of the fall. (Gold) 
</P>
<P>
* 1/2 L.A. GUNS, "Cocked and Loaded,"Vertigo/PolyGram. L.A. Guns shares 
influences, image and misogynist lyrics with Guns N' Roses. Though Tracii Guns 
is an appealingly thrashy guitarist, Phil Lewis' vocals are flat and 
characterless. L.A. Guns' first album was raw andpunky, but felt genuine. This 
second album seems as if the band has been staring too long at the golden ring. 
(Gold) 
</P>
<P>
*** MOTLEY CRUE, "Dr. Feelgood,"Elektra. Their strongest album since "Shout at 
the Devil" half a dozen years ago. Of all the L.A. glam-metal bands of the 
'80s, Motley Crue has always understood both the Bay City Rollers kind of 
teen-dream appeal and the importance of the riff: the pounding, shrieking, 
two-chord monoliths that have always powered the best hard rock. (Gold) 
</P>
<P>

Coming Up:

Other albums scheduled for release in the coming weeks include:

   A woman who went to court to prove she's
the daughter of country music legend Hank Williams Sr. will make
her professional singing debut Sunday at a festival honoring her
late father.
   ``I'm going to do it for a tribute to my father,'' said Cathy
Deupree Adkinson, who was born in Montgomery five days after
Williams died on Jan. 1, 1953.
   As a professional singer, Mrs. Adkinson is using the name ``Jett
Williams,'' which combines the last names of her parents.
   Mrs. Adkinson plans to sing several of her father's songs at the
Hank Williams Memorial Association's annual music festival Sunday
in Evergreen, 75 miles southwest of Montgomery. She will be
accompanied by two members of his original Drifting Cowboys band.
   She was born Antha Belle Jett, the daughter of Nashville, Tenn.,
secretary Bobbie Jett, with whom Williams lived during the summer
of 1952 but never married. An Alabama judge ruled in 1987 that Mrs.
Adkinson is Williams' daughter.
   The only child from Williams' two marriages is entertainer Hank
Williams Jr.

   Danny Thomas' humanitarian work as founder
of the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital here will be
recognized this week in Toledo, Ohio, where the entertainer was
raised.
   The Medical College of Ohio at Toledo will present Thomas an
honorary degree Friday during commencement ceremonies, according to
a statement Tuesday from the Memphis hospital.
   Thomas, best known for the television comedy ``Make Room For
Daddy,'' founded St. Jude in 1962 and regularly makes personal
appearances on behalf of the institution.
   The hospital is a leading biomedical research center dedicated
to finding cures for childhood cancer and other catastrophic
children's diseases.

   A prosecutor said charges won't be filed
against actor Timothy Bottoms, who was booked after a motorist told
authorities that the actor confronted him with a gun.
   ``He did have a gun, but he didn't display it in a rude, angry
or threatening manner as required,'' said Deputy District Attorney
Don Grant.
   Bottoms was booked for investigation of brandishing a gun on a
road, a felony, and carrying a loaded weapon, a misdemeanor, after
the motorist told the California Highway Patrol he was confronted
by the actor on U.S. 101 on May 10.
   The decision not to file charges against ``The Last Picture
Show'' actor was made last week, Grant said.
   Bottoms had a .22-caliber pistol and ammunition in his station
wagon when it was pulled over by officers, but the weapon wasn't
loaded, Grant said.
   The actor's spokesman, Sandy Bresler, has declined comment.
   Bottoms, 37, made his film debut in 1971 in the movie ``Johnny
Got His Gun.'' His other films include ``The Paper Chase'' in 1973
and ``Invaders From Mars'' in 1986.

   Chet Atkins and his fellow guitarists
will try to pick their way to a world's record Friday when they
gather at two shopping malls to play the same song simultaneously.
   They hope to establish a record for most guitarists playing one
song together. They also are out to prove that there really are
1,352 guitar pickers in Nashville as the Lovin' Spoonful declared
in their 1966 hit record, ``Nashville Cats.''
   Nashville's guitarists will meet at Hickory Hollow and Rivergate
malls.
   Atkins will lead the guitarists at Hickory Hollow and guitarist
Harold Bradley will conduct those at Rivergate 25 miles away. There
will be a telephone hookup between the two so that each group can
be cued simultaneously.
   Atkins, known as ``Mr. Guitar,'' and Bradley will decide
Thursday on the song.
   The 1988 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records does not
list a category for most guitarists playing one song together.

   Before christening an airship,
Prince Charles took over the controls. Once on the ground, he named
it the Prince of Wales.
   The Prince of Wales was the pilot of the $4.65 million airship
Tuesday for 20 minutes of an hourlong flight. At the Kemble Royal
Air Force base near Cirencester in Gloucestershire, the 40-year-old
heir to the British throne performed the christening cermony,
smashing a bottle of champagne on its side.
   The airship captain, Peter Hemming, said the prince was an
``absolute natural'' as pilot.
   ``He is of course an experienced pilot in his own right and he
took to it very well,'' Hemming said.

   Pierce Lyden, a Hollywood bad guy who
never won a fight or kissed a leading lady in four decades of
western films, had a good role for a change: hometown hero. But he
wasn't wearing a white hat.
   Wearing a black hat and packing pistols, Lyden rode down Main
Street in a horse-drawn carriage Monday as grand marshal of a
parade in his honor.
   ``I'm dumbfounded by the overwhelming response,'' said Lyden,
who was born in Hildreth 83 years ago and graduated from high
school in Naponee. Both towns are near Franklin, which is in
south-central Nebraska, a few miles from the Kansas border.
   ``I never thought this recognition would happen to me,'' Lyden
said as he signed an autograph for a young fan.
   Lyden's career spanned from the 1930s to the 1960s, mainly in
``B'' movies although his credits include ``The Gunfighter'' with
Gregory Peck and ``Red River'' with John Wayne.
   Lyden said he once tried to be a movie ``good guy.''
   ``I shaved off my moustache and even put on a white hat, but it
didn't do any good,'' he said. ``Hollywood had me typecast as a bad
guy.''

   ``Die Walkuere'' (Deutsche Grammaphon) _ The Metropolitan Opera
Orchestra Conducted by James Levine.
   
   There's no shortage of recordings of Wagner's ``Die Walkuere'' in
the catalog, but the newest version, featuring the Metropolitan
Opera Orchestra conducted by James Levine, has been eagerly awaited
since the project was announced more than two years ago.
   For once, the results justify all the excitement. This Deutsche
Grammaphon release (available only on cassette and compact disc) has
got to be high on anybody's list of the best opera recordings of
1988.
   The cast closely follows the one heard currently at the Met in
its new production of Wagner's four-opera Ring Cycle. That means
it's about the best that could be put together from today's singers,
although not up to the superhuman standards set by Golden Agers such
as Flagstad or Melchior, or more recently by Birgit Nilsson.
   But it's hard to imagine a finer Sieglinde than Jessye Norman.
Her pillar of seamless sound and her impeccable diction are joined
by a passionate commitment that makes the final scene of Act 1
breathtaking. Gary Lakes, America's latest entry in the heldentenor
sweepstakes, is a more-than-respectable partner for her as Siegmund.
   Bass James Morris has the vocal weight and the beauty of tone to
make a world-class Wotan. An occasional blandness mars his
interpretation of this complex character, but he is still relatively
new to the part.
   As Bruennhilde, Hildegard Behrens sounds as good as she ever has,
which is splendid. The voice is thinner than ideal, but she never
sounds harsh or raw here as she sometimes does in performance, and
her understanding of the character is impressive.
   The lesser roles are cast impeccably. Christa Ludwig as Fricke
provides a link to the great tradition of early post-World War II
operatic singing, and Kurt Moll, the Hunding, is one of the finest
German basses in recent memory. Even the chorus of Valkyries is
unusually strong, including such major artists as Marita Napier,
Marilyn Mims and Linda Kelm.
   Levine and the orchestra do themselves proud. The sound is always
smooth and sonorous and the interpretation is quite moving at the
climactic moments, especially Wotan's eloquent farewell to the
disgraced Bruennhilde in Act 3.
   The orchestra, widely regarded as one of the world's finest
ensembles, had not recorded a home-grown production for 16 years,
since Bizet's ``Carmen'' with Leonard Bernstein conducting.
   This ``Walkuere'' certainly whets the appetite for the rest of
the Ring recordings and, one hopes, for more Met projects to follow.

   ``Imaginos'' (Columbia) _ Blue Oyster Cult
   
   Crash-and-burn guitars. Monster-movie lyrics. Sinister vocals.
Durn, it must be the Blue Oyster Cult!
   Yes, all the trademarks of the Cult are evident on ``Imaginos.''
But they seem hollow and sometimes downright silly amid the dense,
plodding heavy metal that characterizes most of BOC's latest effort.
   This band has sounded stagnant for about a decade now, coasting
on the devil-in-leather imagery that at one time produced some of
the most ferocious music on the rock 'n' roll landscape.
   Can anyone who experienced the multi-guitar rave-ups of BOC's
first five albums (or their mind-blowing live shows) fail to be
disappointed with the overdone bashing about on ``Imaginos?''
   The band has one of the genre's finest guitarists in Donald
``Buck Dharma'' Roeser, and the Blue Oyster Cult does know how to
rock. But the good moments here are just that _ a good guitar lick
here, an imaginative vocal turn there, buried in second-rate
material. You can sit and nod when the good bits emerge, if that's
your idea of a good time.
   Giving credit where it's due, ``Del Rio's Song'' soars above the
rest, distinguished by its crisp production, Eric Bloom's raw-edged
vocal and a strong, tuneful melody. There's also an interesting,
fancied-up remake of ``Astronomy,'' a song they first did in 1974.
   By most standards, this would be a decent hard rock LP. But the
Blue Oyster Cult has demonstrated many times they are more than a
decent hard rock band. That's what makes listening to ``Imaginos''
so infuriating.

   ``Paint Another Picture'' (Columbia) _ Darlene Love
   
   Darlene Love is one of the greatest rock 'n' roll singers ever to
grace our planet. Her work with Phil Spector in the 1960s _ ``He's a
Rebel,'' ``Da Doo Ron Ron'' _ recorded under a variety of names,
stands as the definition of the Spector sound. And ``Christmas
(Baby, Please Come Home)'' is simply the best rock 'n' roll
Christmas record ever.
   That's why her first solo album, even with help from Tom Petty,
Joan Jett, Paul Shaffer and master producer Jimmy Iovine, is a
disappointment.
   Love isn't the problem here. Thankfully, she's not one of those
time-ravaged legends croaking their way to another payday; after
more than two decades at it, she still sings stunningly well.
   The problem is the material, which is, simply, uninteresting. Too
often, Love is forced to fight her way out of syntho-pop musical
cliches, and that's a tremendous waste.
   Best is Petty's ``We Stand a Chance,'' which rocks a bit but
isn't exactly ``He's a Rebel.'' And the inclusion of a straight
cover of ``You'll Never Walk Alone'' _ yep, the same one Jerry Lewis
moans on Labor Day _ is simply puzzling.
   The record clocks in under 32 minutes, which, one assumes, is
testimony enough to the problem Love had in finding worthy songs for
this project.
   Since ``Paint Another Picture'' probably won't sell a zillion
copies, here's hoping Columbia gives her another chance. The notion
of Darlene Love making rock 'n' roll records again is exciting; it's
too bad this record isn't.

ON THAT SUBJECT: Raffi and Midnight Oil aren't the only pop artists who don't 
want their new CDs released with a long box. According to manager Kenny Laguna, 
rock songstress Joan Jett manager has made a formal request to CBS Records 
asking that the label issue her next album without a CD long box. 
</P>
<P>
"Joan isn't someone who gets involved in a lot of causes, but she feels 
strongly about this -- she doesn't want to be a party to destroying millions of 
trees for a box that everyone throws into the garbage," explained Laguna, who 
said Jett's album is tentatively scheduled for a Christmas release. "So we sent 
a letter to the top execs at CBS about a month ago, along with some recent 
Earth Day articles. Joan made it clear she's serious. She said if they felt 
they couldn't market her CD without a long box, then she'd rather them not put 
a CD out at all, even though that could cost her a lot of record sales." Laguna 
said the CBS brass is currently considering her request.

<HEAD>Daughter of Hank Williams to Perform With Father's Band</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jett Williams will perform her own music
with songs written by her father, country great Hank Williams, when
she begins touring with his Drifting Cowboys band.
   ``It's meant to be, because a lot of strange things have
happened,'' said Ms. Williams, who recently won a decision by the
Alabama Supreme Court recognizing she had been cut out of her
father's estate. ``I know who I am now. I know that my father
wanted me and that's taken me a whole lifetime.''
   She signed a deal Monday with Buddy Lee Attractions of Nashville
to tour with the two Drifting Cowboys who still perform, fiddler
Jerry Rivers and steel guitarist Don Helms. Tour arrangements were
incomplete.
   Ms. Williams, whose real name is Cathy Deupree Adkinson, was
born in Montgomery five days after Williams' death on Jan. 1, 1953.
Williams and her mother, Bobbie Jett, were not married, and the
child was raised by Williams' mother, Lillian Stone.
   After Mrs. Stone's death the girl was put up for adoption. The
Alabama court decided she should share Williams' songwriting
royalties with Hank Williams Jr.
   Ms. Williams, who is married to Washington attorney Keith
Adkinson, will also perform songs she has written about her own
life, including ``Conceived in Love.''

RANDY LEWIS: SO, WHAT DOES A ROCK 'N' ROLL MUSICIAN REALLY LOOK LIKE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Huntington Beach Police Department, in a quest for information in the 
unsolved murder last month of a rock-band manager, has released a bulletin 
saying the victim was last seen accompanied by someone "described as having a 
rock 'n' roll musician appearance." 
</P>
<P>
Now just what might that be? 
</P>
<P>
Frank Zappa? Elton John? Peter Garrett, the bald, 6-foot-6 lead singer of 
Midnight Oil? 
</P>
<P>
Joan Jett? Prince? 
</P>
<P>
Little Richard? Jerry Lee Lewis? Huey Lewis? 
</P>
<P>
Read more closely, the bulletin at least includes a couple of other clues as to 
what this person might look like: "male white in his late 20s or early 30s with 
long, jet-black hair. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Hmm. That doesn't eliminate Elvis. Let's hope The King hasn't survived all 
these years only to turn to a life of crime. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe this guy was seen with a microphone in his hand, an electric guitar slung 
behind his back as he sat atop a stack of Marshall amplifiers. 
</P>
<P>
Seems the only group that authorities can safely rule out for having "a rock 
'n' roll musician appearance" is anyone who's appeared on stage at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
Suppose the police had issued a description saying this person, who is being 
sought for information and not considered a suspect, was described as having a 
lawyer's appearance? Or a golfer's appearance? Or, for that matter, an 
undercover police officer's appearance? 
</P>
<P>
Evidently, at least according to Huntington Beach's finest, all rock 'n' roll 
musicians look like the members of Motley Crue: young, white guys with 
waist-length hair. And, vice-versa -- anyone fitting that description must be a 
rock 'n' roller. 
</P>
<P>
Next time guys, be careful out there.

THE RECORD INDUSTRY'S BIG PUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The fall season is always the most active time for pop record releases, as the 
music industry gears up for its November-December season, during which nearly a 
third of all records, tapes and CDs are sold. But that can mean confusion for 
even the most serious music fans, as old favorites compete with newcomers for 
consumers' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the albums expected to generate the most critical and commercial 
interest of all the post-Labor Day releases during the hectic year-end rush. 
The selections, presented in alphabetical order, cover all parts of the pop 
music spectrum, from heavy-metal fathers (Aerosmith) and sons (L.A. Guns) to 
rap innovators (the D.O.C., Young M.C.); from rock kings on the rebound (Bob 
Dylan, the Rolling Stones) and pop queens living the lush life (Linda Ronstadt, 
Barbra Streisand) to country chartbusters (Randy Travis) and folkie mavericks 
(Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked). 
</P>
<P>
 The comments are by the Times pop writers indicated, but the star ratings (one 
is poor, five a classic) sometimes reflect additional pop staff input. 
</P>
<P>
 The reviewers are Robert Hilburn, Dennis Hunt, Mike Boehm, Richard Cromelin, 
Jonathan Gold, Steve Hochman, Connie Johnson, Craig Lee, Kristine McKenna, 
Randy Lewis, Don Snowden, Chris Willman, Paul Grein, Duff Marlowe and Don 
Waller. 
</P>
<P>
*** MELISSA ETHERIDGE, "Brave and Crazy,"Island. A far superior effort to its 
Grammy-nominated predecessor. Bad relationships, Etheridge's lyrical raison 
d'etre, are dealt with in more interesting (i.e., not just angry or tragic) 
terms, and the music strikes more major keys and different palettes. (Willman) 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 RICKIE LEE JONES, "Flying Cowboys,"Geffen. "When I was young I was a 
wild, wild one," Jones sings on two different songs. The album, her first in 
five years, has elements of melancholy and loss, but the awareness of time 
passed has made her sweeter and more good-tempered. Not as moving as 1981's 
"Pirates" nor as complex as 1984's "The Magazine," but scarcely less valuable. 
(Willman) 
</P>
<P>
*** LENNY KRAVITZ, "Let Love Rule,"Virgin. Overflows with enough exhumed peace 
and love to maybe make even Wavy Gravy choke. For most of the album, Kravitz is 
knocking off either Lennon or Prince. His shocking derivation would be plenty 
irritating if he didn't pull it off with such naive nerviness. (Willman) 
</P>
<P>
*** LINDA RONSTADT, "Cry Like a Rainstorm -- Howl Like the Wind," Elektra. The 
material recalls her middle-of-the-rock-road '70s work, but the approach -- 
mostly contemporary ballads written by tunesmiths like Jimmy Webb, drenched in 
swirling, overbearing orchestral arrangements -- is as highly conceptualized as 
on her last few albums. The presence of angelic-voiced Aaron Neville as duet 
partner on a third of the 12 cuts is a big plus. See interview. (Willman) 
</P>
<P>
*** 1/2 MICHELLE SHOCKED, "Captain Swing,"PolyGram. In the kind of unexpected 
stylistic turn typical of Neil Young, Shocked has mostly put her country-folk 
aside in favor of a big-band blues effort full of horns and electric guitar. 
Her wry, powerful voice is more than up to the task of making this a full-blown 
success and not just a novel sidetrack. The more political side of her writing 
is missed, but gee, this is a blast. (Willman) 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 TEARS FOR FEARS, "The Seeds of Love,"Mercury. The ivory-flashing English 
duo is back with an ambitious effort that eschews rampant technology for 
"organic" band playing. After the opening three songs, even a skeptic might 
primal-scream in praise of the lads' growth and scope, but the remaining five 
tracks make any hollering seems a tad premature. (Willman) 
</P>
<P>
**** NEIL YOUNG, "Freedom,"Reprise. An album of minimalistic, expressionistic, 
mostly just plain raw rock and folk in a down-tempo, pessimistic mode that 
recalls stark '70s efforts like "Tonight's the Night" more than any mood 
Young's affected in recent years. Though it's not always easy to grapple with, 
it may be his best album of the decade. (Willman) 
</P>

   Sex, says Lita Ford, goes with rock 'n'
roll like tires on a cab.
   The compact blonde offers no apologies for the skimpy outfits
and pouty looks she displays on the cover of her third album,
``Lita,'' which produced the hit single, ``Kiss Me Deadly.''
   ``It's advertisement,'' Ford said during a recent dressing room
interview at the Glens Falls Civic Center. ``Besides, you make
money off selling merchandise. I mean, how do you sell a pack of
cigarettes without advertising?''
   Ford, a brash 29-year-old rocker who's posed for publicity
photos wearing nothing more than her guitar, may or may not have
benefited from her particular form of advertising, but she's
leaving little in her career to chance.
   She's taken lessons from vocal coaches and called on well-known
producer and writer Mike Chapman to add his pop sheen to her songs.
Chapman, who produced much of Blondie's best work, helped Ford
write some of her material and convinced his friend, Mick Smiley,
to give her the song ``Kiss Me Deadly.''
   The love, or lust, song with a chiming melody and metallic
crunch made it all the way to No. 12 on the Billboard Top 40 chart,
and the video earned Ford a nomination for best video of the year
by a female artist. Suzanne Vega's ``Luka'' beat her for the trophy.
   ``Our main goal on this album was to go gold and we're almost
platinum so we definitely accomplished what we were looking to
accomplish,'' said Ford, whose first record for RCA has already
sold about 800,000 copies. ``It's not over yet.''
   Ford angrily eschews the label ``heavy metal,'' but she's
co-written songs on ``Lita'' with two of that genre's major stars:
Ozzy Osbourne and Nikki Sixx of Motley Crue.
   And she's parlayed her success with the album into opening act
slots on tours led by metal popsters Poison and Bon Jovi, assuring
her of captive audiences of rabid teen-agers for the next few
months to come.
   Her songs run the gamut of easily-identifiable teen-age
emotions, with such titles as ``Broken Dreams,'' ``Back to the
Cave'' and ``Fatal Passion.''
   The blunt ``Can't Catch Me'' advises a potential boyfriend to
stay away from strong-arm tactics. ``You'd better think twice, I
ain't no Sandra Dee,'' Ford sings. ``Don't think I'm easy, I wasn't
born blonde.''
   Ford, who's pictured on the back cover of her record hoisting a
belt of silver bullets, said she considers herself a role model for
girls who want to enter the world of rock 'n' roll. She advises
them to toughen up.
   ``If that's what they really want to do, just go with it. ...
Don't let any idiots steer you the wrong way,'' she said.
   Her own career started young, at age 16, with the all-female Los
Angeles band the Runaways.
   The Runaways, who played punk rock, were never big sellers and
they took their share of critical lumps before breaking up in the
late 1970s over fights about future direction. But they boast two
successful alumni in Ford and Joan Jett, currently riding high
herself with the hit, ``I Hate Myself for Loving You.''
   ``We were all poor, but we all loved what we were doing,'' Ford
said of her days with the Runaways. ``It was my way of going
through life.''
   She said she keeps rocking because ``it's what I do best,''
though it's not always the easiest career. As she watched a road
crew member drag a cooler of beer and soda across the dressing room
floor, she mused that she'll spend her day off horseback-riding.
   ``Every business has its ups and downs, whether you're a taxi
driver or a rock 'n' roller,'' she said. ``It gets lonely on the
road sometimes. The guys can pal around with the guys, but it gets
real hard for me to just go out and pal around with the guys,
because I'm not one of the guys.''
   Although she appreciates the power and excitement of the music,
Ford also recognizes it's a job _ leading to a slightly cynical
view of what she's doing.
   ``It's a product, it's something that you sell,'' she said.
``Music, cigarettes, an amp, a carpet _ what's the difference? It's
all a material thing that you sell.''

<HEAD>Spacecraft Reveals Broad Bands of Clouds Encircling Neptune's Poles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Neptune's poles may be encircled by broad
bands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on Earth and
Jupiter, say scientists studying a new photograph from the Voyager 2
space probe.
   Two dark bands, each about 2,700 miles wide, are clearly visible
forming a collar around Neptune's south pole. The photograph also
shows hints of similar banding around the north pole, said Edward
Stone, Voyager project scientist for NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They are probably regions of clouds associated with high-speed
jet streams,'' said Stone, a physicist and vice president at the
California Institute of Technology.
   The planet's southern hemisphere bands stretch from 50 degrees
south latitude to 70 degrees south latitude, said Candice Hansen, a
planetary scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The new photograph was taken by Voyager 2 on June 22 when it was
57.2 million miles from Neptune. Because of the time needed to
process an enhanced color image, it was released Wednesday by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which called it ``the
best color photo of Neptune taken so far by the Voyager 2
spacecraft.''
   Today, the spacecraft was 44.6 million miles from the remote
planet, cruising at 42,202 mph as it headed for its Aug. 24 close
encounter with the solar system's fourth-largest planet.
   Voyager was 2.67 billion miles from Earth, but has traveled 4.38
billion miles along its curving path since it was launched 12 years
ago.
   The photograph shows in greater detail a large dark spot _ a
cloud system bigger than the entire planet Mars _ seen in earlier
images of Neptune. Scientists have said the 6,200-mile-wide spot
probably is a storm similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot or Earth's
hurricanes.
   Earth's jet streams are 65- to 200-mph high-altitude air currents
that zigzag across various latitudes as they blow around the globe.
The cloud bands on Jupiter, Saturn and apparently on Neptune are
straight belts encircling those planets. Uranus also shows faint
hints of narrower cloud bands.
   Scientists believe Earth's jet streams meander across latitudinal
lines because of interference from continents and temperature
differences in the oceans.
   It may be that the bands are straight on the giant planets
because those worlds have extremely thick atmospheres with
relatively simple wind patterns, said Hansen and Caltech planetary
scientist Andrew Ingersoll.
   Jupiter's 250-mph jet streams are found along the edges of its
cloud bands, and scientists suspect the same is true on Neptune,
Stone said. There is no obvious association between jet streams and
cloud bands on Saturn, he added.
   Stone said that on Jupiter, and possibly Neptune, the cloud bands
help create the jet streams and then are blown by them. Jupiter's
clouds are pushed to high altitudes by winds stirred up by heat
within the planet. They try to fall back to lower elevations by
moving north or south. But the planet's rotation deflects the
falling clouds to form jet streams, he said.
   Voyager is still too far from Neptune to determine if the bands
contain dark high-altitude clouds or if they are broad ribbons of
clear sky that allow Voyager to peer at dark clouds lower in
Neptune's atmosphere, said Rich Terrile, a Jet Propulsion Laboratory
astronomer.
   Studying Neptune's atmosphere will give scientists ``an
understanding of the circulation pattern on a planet at one of the
most remote fringes of our solar system,'' Terrile said, adding that
knowledge of alien atmospheres ``improves our ability to understand
our own atmosphere.''
   Voyager 2 and its twin, Voyager 1, were launched from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., in 1977.
   They explored Jupiter in 1979. Voyager 1 flew past Saturn in 1980
and is headed toward interstellar space. Voyager 2 encountered
Saturn in 1981, Uranus in 1986 and will fly about 3,000 miles above
Neptune's north pole cloudtops at 9 p.m. PDT Aug. 24.
   Five hours later it will encounter Neptune's backward-orbiting
moon, Triton, at a distance of about 25,000 miles.
   Neptune usually is the eighth planet from the sun, but because of
Pluto's elongated orbit Neptune will be the ninth and outermost
until 2007.

POP MUSIC SPECIAL;

<P>
THE RECORD INDUSTRY'S BIG PUSH 
</P>

The fall season is always the most active time for pop record releases, as the 
music industry gears up for its November-December season, during which nearly a 
third of all records, tapes and CDs are sold. But that can mean confusion for 
even the most serious music fans, as old favorites compete with newcomers for 
consumers' attention. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the albums expected to generate the most critical and commercial 
interest of all the post-Labor Day releases during the hectic year-end rush. 
The selections, presented in alphabetical order, cover all parts of the pop 
music spectrum, from heavy-metal fathers (Aerosmith) and sons (L.A. Guns) to 
rap innovators (the D.O.C., Young M.C.); from rock kings on the rebound (Bob 
Dylan, the Rolling Stones) and pop queens living the lush life (Linda Ronstadt, 
Barbra Streisand) to country chartbusters (Randy Travis) and folkie mavericks 
(Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked). 
</P>
<P>
 The comments are by the Times pop writers indicated, but the star ratings (one 
is poor, five a classic) sometimes reflect additional pop staff input. 
</P>
<P>
 The reviewers are Robert Hilburn, Dennis Hunt, Mike Boehm, Richard Cromelin, 
Jonathan Gold, Steve Hochman, Connie Johnson, Craig Lee, Kristine McKenna, 
Randy Lewis, Don Snowden, Chris Willman, Paul Grein, Duff Marlowe and Don 
Waller. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 GRATEFUL DEAD, "Built To Last,"Arista. The best songs are the three 
valedictory numbers sung and co-written by Jerry Garcia. When it's Uncle 
Jerry's Band, the Dead is something to hear. But when he steps back and lets 
the other guys take over, "Built to Last" subsides into something less durable. 
(Boehm) 
</P>
<P>
*** BILLY JOEL, "Storm Front,"Columbia. He's obnoxious, derivative, almost 
always playing to the grandstand with oversized gestures. But that can be 
overlooked when the craftsmanship and tunefulness are as strong as they are 
here. A rock-oriented treat for Joel's fans, and maybe even a guilty pleasure 
for those who think of him as an obnoxious, derivative grandstander. (Boehm) 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 ELTON JOHN, "Sleeping With the Past,"MCA. The album is dedicated by John 
and Bernie Taupin to soul pioneers, but it's no juicy soul update. Instead, 
it's a savvy piece of smooth pop craft, with warm singing, consistently 
hummable melodies and as strong a sequence of tunes as John has put together 
since his mid-'70s days as a dominant force on the pop charts. (Boehm) 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 THOMPSON TWINS, "Big Trash,"Red Eye/Warner Bros. While nothing here is 
as good as the Twins' mid-'80s hits, "Big Trash" does serve as a credible 
comeback album. Tom Bailey and Alannah Currie don't have anything deep or 
original to say, and they are fairly shameless about stealing from such sources 
as the Doors and Talking Heads, but they offer more humor and vitality than 
most of the dance-rock competition. (Boehm)

   ``Here Comes the Groom'' (Sire) _ John Wesley Harding
   
   ``Bob Dylan is my father. Joan Baez is my mother. And I am their
bastard son,'' sings John Wesley Harding.
   Harding, who takes his name from a Dylan album, is a gleeful
musical vandal. On his debut album, he sounds eerily like Elvis
Costello, and even shares Costello's music publishing company and
two members of his former band, the Attractions. Harding's song
``Cathy's New Clown'' quotes from the Everly Brothers classic.
   But faster than anyone can spell ``derivative,'' Harding is
laughing. His thievery is so blatant, and he makes such a joke
about it, that it's thrown back in the face of people overly
concerned with originality in rock 'n' roll.
   Besides, it's awfully hard not to like this album.
   ``Wes'' is the real-life Wesley Harding Stace, a 24-year-old
Englishman who once aspired to be a sportscaster. His backup band,
the Good Liars, features former Costello rhythm section Bruce and
Pete Thomas and shares the Attractions' mastery of several
different styles.
   Harding doesn't hesitate to take them in all sorts of
directions: ``Affairs of the Heart,'' with its accordion and pedal
steel guitar, sounds like French country music.
   Some of ``Here Comes the Groom'' is like ``Get Happy'' with a
brass section, some is clearly folk-influenced. On ``The Devil in
Me,'' about the darker side of human nature, it's both in the same
song.
   Like Costello, Harding has the gift of gab. Words often pour out
faster than most human ears can pick up. There's little of
Costello's bitterness, however, as this couplet suggests: ``If
there's a nuclear winter, at least it will snow.''
   The cassette has 15 songs, and many of them are crackling good.
There are slower moments _ such as the uninspired folkie duet with
Peter Case, ``Things Snowball,'' and other cuts buried on Side 2.
But Harding has an unexpectedly high batting average on this
audacious debut.

   ``Pale'' (Columbia) _ Toad the Wet Sprocket
   
   Toad the Wet Sprocket's new album, ``Pale,'' exemplifies
everything that's wrong about the wheezing alternative rock scene.
   Far from the cutting edge, the underground scene has too many
imitators instead of innovators. The reigning gods are still
R.E.M., which methodically built a successful career with
originality and relentless work.
   Since the early 1980s, R.E.M. has had more impersonators than
Elvis Presley. Toad the Wet Sprocket is only the latest to emulate
the form rather than the substance of R.E.M.
   ``Pale'' is loaded with moody, slightly incongruous lyrics. The
guitar rock mixes the jangle and the drone. The cover's a grainy
picture of something indistinguishable and the band photo is blurry.
   Sound familiar?
   Admittedly, the failure of an entire genre is a tough burden to
place on the shoulders of an unassuming California rock band.
They're somewhat adept interpreters; the sound is more muscular
than ``Murmur'' era R.E.M. though the songs, of course, lack
distinctiveness.
   But it would be far better to see bands try to make their mark
with their own visions rather than someone else's.

POP BEAT: JAPANESE ROCK TURNING AMERICAN; 
</P>
<P>
HEAVY METAL: THE ALL-FEMALE GROUP SHOW-YA TAKES A GODZILLA-SIZE STEP AT THE 
PALACE TOWARD SUCCESS IN THE WEST.

Business management style, Godzilla movies and cartoons about big-eyed kids and 
flying robots. That's the top of the list of cultural exports from Japan to the 
United States. Yet rock 'n' roll -- in many ways a combination of the three -- 
has rarely made the eastward Pacific crossing. 
</P>
<P>
Show-Ya, a Japanese all-female hard-rock quintet that is a huge hit at home, 
conjured images of all those things Wednesday at the Palace in Hollywood: 
</P>
<P>
Its career is being overseen by a determined Tokyo-based management team that 
made sure the show was not just a concert, but an event, replete with both U.S. 
and Japanese camera crews to document the evening. (In contrast, two shows at 
the Roxy and one at Gazzarri's last year -- the only other times the band has 
played in the States -- were kept low-key and not very well publicized.) 
Musically, Show-Ya crunches like a monster on a rampage, performing rock-hard 
songs with accomplished flair -- maybe a bit too neat and clean in its 
execution, but still quite impressive. And the young women perform with a sense 
of innocent, cute fun that one record industry observer compared, positively, 
to the cartoon rock star Jem. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday, it all added up to a Godzilla-size step toward U.S. success as the 
showcase won over an at-first dubious crowd. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you hear I'm breaking up L.A. Guns to join Show-Ya?" joked Hollywood 
rocker Tracii Guns after the show. But Guns and the hard-rock fans and 
musicians he was standing with at the show were legitimately impressed by 
Show-Ya's mastery of contemporary heavy-metal styles and staging, and by the 
band's exuberant performance. Whatever novelty factor exists in the band's 
cultural and gender make-up was supplanted quickly by the professional quality 
of the show. 
</P>
<P>
"They're very good," concurred Lisa Johnson, an A&amp;R scout for the RCA 
subsidiary Zomba Records, and one of many industry representatives in an 
audience split about 50/50 between young Japanese Angelenos and Hollywood 
insiders. "They remind me of Jem . . . and also of the Runaways." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the '70s all-female Los Angeles hard-rock Runaways (Joan Jett and Lita 
Ford were both original members) are a prime example of a U.S. group that was a 
much bigger success in Japan than here. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately no one was reminded of the sugar-coated duo Pink Lady, the only 
Japanese female pop act to make any kind of impact in the U.S. pop market, 
though there's little question that the Show-Ya strategy for success is 
calculated to the last detail. There's more than a hint of sexiness in the 
women's stage outfits, but even that, as one observer noted, is done with a 
safe, doll-like quality. And lead singer Keiko Terada readily admitted 
backstage after the show that her trademark rose tattoo over her right breast 
is actually a decal. 
</P>
<P>
But despite that calculation, Show-Ya -- which plays 15,000-capacity and larger 
halls in Japan and has sold millions of albums -- proved itself a band with 
legitimate merits Wednesday. The four instrumentalists are all solid players, 
if not particularly original, and the songs rock hard with memorable melodic 
hooks sung in a powerful yet controlled voice by Terada. The fact that most of 
the lyrics are in Japanese didn't seem to interfere with anyone's enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
But if you're looking for real Japanese rock 'n' roll, look somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
When asked after the show to identify the Japanese qualities in her music, 
Terada, 26, demurred: 
</P>
<P>
"Probably the only difference is the language, because we are trying to be like 
an American rock 'n' roll band," she said through translator John Bell. 
</P>
<P>
The three members of Show-Ya's management team, all clad in conservative 
business suits, stressed that point as they sat nervously in the Palace 
restaurant before the concert. Massy Hayata and Osamu Horiba, president and 
executive producer respectively of International Artmotion Inc., a company that 
represents American painters in Japan and is now working with Show-Ya, and Yuji 
Nishi, who has been managing the group since discovering them at an amateur 
show nearly 10 years ago, were vague about just what the difference between 
Japanese and American rock 'n' roll is. 
</P>
<P>
Nishi, a boyish-looking 34, said, "When they play in Japan they're Japanese. In 
America they're American." 
</P>
<P>
But none of them could elaborate on just what that means, referring only to a 
"Japanese feeling" and an "American feeling." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Jensen, the Los Angeles based publicist who has worked with Show-Ya 
since seeing the band at the "Music Summit" in Moscow last summer, thinks it's 
inappropriate to look to Show-Ya's music for insight into Japanese culture the 
way one might look to the Gipsy Kings' music to learn about Gypsy culture. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't compare them to the Gipsy Kings," Jensen said. "But I wouldn't call 
(German hard-rock band) Scorpions representative of German culture either. . . 
. The bottom line is I don't think a metal-head is ready to accept the subtle 
nuances musically of Japanese musical culture." 
</P>
<P>
And acceptance is definitely what it's all about. 
</P>
<P>
"That is the No. 1 priority," Jensen said. "They want to be accepted, be one of 
the No. 1 rock bands around the world." 
</P>

<HEAD>Strange Twists and Turns In Springsteen's Tunnel Of Love Tour</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>

   The huge American flag has been replaced
with tapestries of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. And Bruce
Springsteen has shed his bandana and work boots for the less
proletarian look of a boardwalk carny in his first return to the
road since 1985.
   But appearance is the least of the unexpected twists and turns
provided by the rock star on his `Tunnel of Love Express Tour,''
the 22-city show that opened Feb. 25 at the Centrum in Worcester.
   ``It's good to see you again. I missed you,'' Springsteen told
the opening night crowd of 12,500 midway through a surprising first
set that opened with the band as patrons at a boardwalk Tunnel of
Love and Springsteen as their host.
   The opener bore little resemblance to the ``Born in the USA''
world tour shows, sharing only length (more than three hours) and
intensity with the performances which made Springsteen a mega-star.
   The 38-year-old New Jersey rocker, aided by a five-piece horn
section and the usual assortment of E Streeters, rearranged and
restructured virtually every song in the show _ from such
Springsteen classics as ``Born to Run'' to such new cuts as ``Spare
Parts.''
   After opening with the title cut from his ``Tunnel of Love'' LP,
Springsteen _ wearing black jeans, a loose-sleeved white dress
shirt and white vest _ befuddled the crowd with an assortment of
seldom-heard songs.
   Virtually ignoring his albums ``Nebraska,'' ``The River'' and
``Darkness on the Edge of Town,'' the Boss and his 12-piece band
played an assortment of B-sides, unreleased songs, cover tunes and
new material that eventually put the crowd in a frenzy.
   ``Be True,'' a B-side dating back to 1981, was the second song
of the show; another B-side, ``Roulette,'' was performed before the
hit ``Brilliant Disguise.''
   Eight songs from ``Tunnel of Love'' were featured; in
comparison, only two from ``Born to Run'' surfaced during the show.
   A pair of new songs were introduced: the rhythm and blues-styled
``I'm a Coward When It Comes to Love'' and a reggae-flavored ``Part
Man, Part Monkey.'' Both were key elements in the second set, which
closed with Springsteen and company's version of ``Light of Day'' _
the song he wrote that was performed by Joan Jett in the Paul
Schraeder film of the same title.
   A highlight of the second set was a rockabilly tune, ``You Can
Look (But You Better Not Touch),'' with Springsteen leading a
conga-line of bandmates across the stage while pianist Roy Bittan
pounded out a Jerry Lee Lewis riff.
   The first encore featured an acoustic reworking of ``Born to
Run'' with Springsteen solo on guitar and harmonica, followed by
revamped versions of ``Hungry Hearts'' and ``Glory Days''
emphasizing the horn section of Jersey bar band favorites LaBamba
and the Hubcaps.
   After breaking new ground throughout the first 2{ hours of the
show, Springsteen returned to old territory for the knockout punch
_ killer versions of ``Rosalita'' and the Mitch Ryder ``Detroit
Medley.''
   Both these former show closers had been discarded during the
last tour, which ran from 1984-5; Springsteen revived them and
added covers of the 1960s classics ``Sweet Soul Music'' and
``Shake'' for good measure.
   ``I forgot how much work this is,'' a smiling Springsteen told
the crowd during the final encore. Looking out at 25,000 raised
hands, he quickly added, ``It's fun, too.''

<MEMO>  MUSIC  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     By 1979, when the rest of us started catching on, Lowell George was another
dead rock 'n' roll legend, and Little Feat was history.;   But 12 years later,
the Little Feat that regrouped in 1987 is playing more concerts to more people
than it ever did in its days with George.;   And the refitted Feat's latest
disc, "Shake Me Up," released last week, is the most recent step in a
carefully choreographed comeback that began with the 1988 album "Let it Roll,"
followed by "Representing the Mambo.";   "Shake Me Up," says keyboardist and
founding member Bill Payne, 42, is "a little more straightforward -- in a
word, accessible.";   "Accessible" is a new entry in the Little Feat lexicon.
From the group's beginning in 1969, when Payne hooked up with a brilliant,
moody, insecure ex-member of the Frank Zappa fold named Lowell George, it was
doomed to be a critics' darling and a commercial derelict.;   The group's
misfit style was pure Americana -- Memphis rock, New Orleans funk, Nashville
country, Mississippi gospel and Chicago blues, set against a sophisticated,
syncopated backbeat. Musicians loved it, but the music industry didn't have a
clue. That meant radio exposure was negligible.;   Fan power; Complicating
matters was the fact that, like the Grateful Dead, Little Feat never was much
of a studio band -- its energy came from its audience. But George had a strong
distaste for touring. To be a Little Feat fan, you had to work at it. But it
was worth it.;   George's sensuous slide guitar, second only to Duane
Allman's, tended to overshadow what is to this day the world's hottest bottom
in rock: drummer Richie Hayward, bassist Kenny Gradney, percussionist Sam
Clayton and Payne.;   The songs George wrote, including "Fat Man in the
Bathtub," "Dixie Chicken," "Sailin' Shoes," "Rocket in My Pocket" and "Willin'
" were classics the first time they were played. But possibly his greatest
genius was the sly, slippery way he could phrase a song.;   But even if George
had not died in an Arlington, Va., motel room after a concert promoting his
new solo career, Little Feat's days would have been numbered.;   "I was pretty
much fed up with the proceedings, mainly of Lowell's," says Payne. "There were
too many drugs, and I thought it alienated from what we were trying to
accomplish. I'd been doing a lot of sessions at that point, and I said, 'This
isn't the way normal people do it.' ";   The band dissolved. And then, without
a radio hit to their name, they became popular. People magazine dubbed them
"America's best unknown band." The Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin called them
their favorite rock 'n' roll band. Posthumously, their cult status was
cinched.;   Payne, always an in-demand sideman, hit the road with James
Taylor, Bob Seger, Jackson Browne and Linda Ronstadt.;   Barrere did two solo
albums and albums with the Bluesbusters band; Gradney toured with Nicolette
Larson and Warren Zevon; Hayward worked with Zevon, Robert Plant and Joan
Armatrading; and Clayton played with Jimmy Buffett for seven years.;  
Ironically, it was a dedication for George that inspired the band to regroup.
The former Feat were in North Hollywood to commemorate a room at a rehearsal
hall in George's name. An impromptu jam session ensued.;   The "R" word was
inevitable. But Payne had stipulations. "A:, that we get another singer to
cover Lowell's place, and B: if we couldn't write music to hold up to the old
songs, maybe we shouldn't do it at all.";   Search for one nets two; The
search for a singer lighted briefly on longtime Feat fan Bonnie Raitt and also
Robert Palmer. Never mind that Palmer was English and his suits Italian, an
obvious mismatch with the all-American Feat.;   The band ended up choosing not
one, but two new members to flesh out the gap left by George. Vocalist Craig
Fuller (of Pure Prairie League and "Amy" fame) and guitarist Fred Tackett were
both close associates of the old Feat.;   Payne's second criterion was little
problem, either. Payne, who wrote "Tripe Face Boogie," "Oh Atlanta" and "Time
Loves a Hero," among other Feat hits, and Barrere, who penned "Feats Don't
Fail Me Now," "All That You Dream" and "Old Folks Boogie," had begun to take
over the songwriting near the end of the Feat's first stand; they knew the
territory.;   Even so, why chance a comeback? With successful post-Feat
careers, why mess with a legacy?;   "It's definitely risky," says Payne. "If
the music and the management end of it isn't right, there's no sense in doing
it because I have too much to lose right now. I'd have to be out of my mind to
put something together that wasn't going to knock people's socks off."; Little

<HEAD>Court Rules Hank Williams' Illegitimate Daughter Can Inherit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The illegitimate daughter of the late
Hank Williams Sr. should share in the country music legacy of
lucrative songwriting royalties, the state Supreme Court ruled
Wednesday.
   The court, in a 5-2 decision, said Cathy Deupree Adkinson can
share in the income, interest and copyright royalties _ estimated to
be worth more than $500,000 a year _ from the time she filed her
initial claim on Aug. 5, 1985.
   The court said Mrs. Adkinson's interests were not properly
represented when Williams' estate was settled 21 years ago.
   ``For 35 years of her life, she's got the short end of the stick.
But in the last two weeks, she's won major victories,'' said her
attorney, David Cromwell Johnson of Birmingham.
   The Supreme Court ruling came one week after Mrs. Adkinson
reached an out-of-court settlement of her separate lawsuit seeking a
share of the $600,000 estate of her adopted mother in Mobile.
   Mary Deupree left her adopted daughter out of the will she wrote
in 1987 when dying with cancer. Mrs. Adkinson's attorneys claimed
Mrs. Deupree was a drug addict who was pressured by others to cut
out the adopted daughter.
   Ms. Adkinson of Washington, D.C., is a budding country music
singer whose stage name, Jett Williams, combines the names of her
father, the late country music entertainer, and her late mother,
Bobbie Jett, a Nashville, Tenn., secretary who lived with Hank
Williams Sr. in the summer of 1952.
   Johnson said his client was away from her home Wednesday and was
unaware of the ruling.
   He estimated the royalties from songs such as ``Your Cheatin'
Heart,'' ``Kowliga'' and ``I Saw the Light'' are worth ``at least a
half million a year and maybe close to a million a year.''
   Richard Frank, a Nashville attorney representing Williams'
publishers, said the ruling was complicated by an earlier federal
court ruling in New York that rejected Mrs. Adkinson's claim to a
share of the copyright royalties.
   Johnson said the case must go back to Montgomery County Circuit
Court for settlement, but anticipated Ms. Adkinson would get
one-third of the estate, which has been controlled by Williams' son
from his first marriage, country music entertainer Hank Williams Jr.
and the second wife of Williams Sr.
   Williams died on Jan. 1, 1953. His daughter was born five days
later and, because of an agreement the country singer had with Ms.
Jett, the child was raised by Williams' mother, Lillian Stone, until
her death on Feb. 26, 1955.
   Williams' sister, Irene Smith, had originally agreed to take the
child if something happened to Mrs. Stone, but changed her mind and
the child was placed for adoption by the state welfare agency, the
Supreme Court said..
   On April 23, 1959, the child, known as Cathy Yvonne Stone, was
adopted by George and Mary Deupree of Mobile, who, according to
court records, wanted to conceal her past and declined efforts by an
attorney to have the child involved in the settlement of her
father's estate in 1967-68.
   While a student at the University of Alabama, Mrs. Adkinson
became aware she might have a famous father. She started seeking
closed court records about her paternity.
   Hank Williams Jr. filed a lawsuit in 1985 to keep the court
records secret, prompting a long legal battle.
   Mrs. Adkinson won a lower court ruling that she was the daughter
of Hank Williams Sr., but the court said she could not inherit. The
Supreme Court reversed that part of the ruling, but said she could
inherit only from the time she made the complaint in 1985.

   Rock star Prince previewed his
forthcoming European tour by performing a benefit concert for the
family of his former bodyguard, who died April 2 of heart failure.
   The 650-ticket sellout show Monday at the suburban nightclub
Rupert's attracted fans who paid $100 a ticket and waited more than
an hour in freezing temperatures to get inside.
   Proceeds will benefit the family of Charles ``Big Chick''
Huntsberry, who gained fame in the mid-'80s as Prince's bodyguard
before turning to Christian evangelism.
   Jill Willis, a publicist for the rock star, said Prince decided
to combine the benefit with a run-through of his forthcoming
``Nude'' tour of Europe. The name of the tour refers to its
``stripped-down rock 'n' roll,'' she said.
   Prince's tour is scheduled to open in Rotterdam June 2 and will
continue through early August, including 15 sold-out dates at
Wembley Arena in London.

   Lady Bird Johnson says she is as dedicated
as ever to the National Wildflower Research Center but plans to
scale back some of her other activities.
   The former first lady has previously said she would do less work
with the Texas Highway Department Beautification Awards, a project
she has sponsored for 20 years.
   At a tree-planting ceremony Monday, Mrs. Johnson, 77, said she
also intends to cut back on activities such as public speaking.
   ``I am scaling down, but not on the Wildflower Research
Center,'' she said. ``But I will try to be a good citizen in the
field of environment, with emphasis on plant, wildflower and tree
beautification.''

   Prince Aya, second son of Emperor Akihito, will
marry graduate student Kiko Kawashima on June 29, the Imperial
Household Agency said Tuesday.
   An agency official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a
messenger from the emperor will call on Miss Kawashima, 23, and her
parents at their home on May 11 to formally notify them of the
wedding date.
   The government plans to spend about $1 million on the wedding of
Miss Kawashima and the 24-year-old Aya, second in line to the
throne after his elder brother, Crown Prince Naruhito. The crown
prince, 30, is unmarried.
   Prince Aya, who graduated from Gakushuin University in 1988, is
studying zoology at Oxford's St. John's college in Britain. He is
expected to complete his studies there and return to Tokyo on June
20.
   Aya and Miss Kawashima met five years ago on the campus of
Gakushuin University. Miss Kawashima, the daughter of a Gakushuin
professor, is taking graduate courses in psychology at the Tokyo
university.
   The couple announced their engagement in September.

   Country music star Hank Williams Jr. has
asked the U.S. Supreme Court to strike down ``feel-good
jurisprudence'' that gave his half-sister a claim to the estate of
their famous father.
   Williams' lawyers contended in the filing last month that the
state Supreme Court gave a share of the late country music Hank
Williams Sr.'s estate to his illegitimate daughter, Jett Williams,
even though the estate had been closed since 1975.
   Williams also asked the court to hear an appeal of a New York
appeals court that, relying on the Alabama case, gave Ms. Williams
a share of continuing music royalties stemming from songs written
by her father.
   Hank Williams Sr. died five days before his daughter was born in
1953 to Bobbie Jett. The Alabama court noted that her paternity was
not suggested to her until 1974, when she was a 21-year-old
University of Alabama student.
   For the next few years, her efforts to get documents from the
state were thwarted because the case had been sealed, along with
evidence that lawyers had been setting aside part of Hank Williams
Sr.'s estate for her.
   She launched her music career under the name Jett Williams,
although she is identified in court documents as Catherine Yvonne
Stone.

   Billionaire Warren Buffett took to the stage
of an ornate, renovated theater and dispensed his financial
philosophy to an audience of more than 1,200 shareholders gathered
for their annual meeting.
   Buffett, who has overseen the growth of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
from $22 million in 1964 to its current $4.9 billion worth,
concluded the business of re-electing officers Monday with nary a
word of dissent or discussion.
   ``With the events of Eastern Europe, this may be the last
bastion of undiluted authoritarianism left,'' said Buffett, 59,
chairman of the Omaha-based investment company.
   The company, valued at $4.9 billion, has holdings that include
Coca-Cola Inc., Gillette Co., Salomon Inc., Capital Cities-ABC

   The hunk flunked ... again.
   John F. Kennedy Jr., who's made magazine covers touting him as
sexy and an heir to the Kennedy dynasty, took the state bar
examination for a second time. Again, he failed.
   ``I'm clearly not a major legal genius,'' he told reporters
Monday.
   So Tuesday's city tabloids had headlines screaming about him
going belly up on the bar exam. Undaunted, Kennedy said he would
take the test again and again ``until I'm 95'' _ or until he passes.
   The 29-year-old son of the late President Kennedy has only one
more chance to pass the grueling 12{-hour, two-day test if he wants
to keep his job as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan.
   Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau, said Kennedy, a prosecutor since August, will be asked
to resign from his $30,000-a-year post if he fails again.
   ``All assistants get three chances,'' Roche said. ``It's a
longstanding office policy. He will take it again in July.''
   Kennedy fell 11 points short of the passing score of 660 out of
1,000 points, said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Kennedy, a graduate of the New York University Law School, first
took the bar exam last July with 64 other new members of
Morgenthau's staff, Roche said. Of the 65, she said, Kennedy was
one of seven who flunked.
   He took the test again in February along with those who failed.
Of the seven, at least two passed on the second go-round.

   Simon Townshend thinks the day is coming
when rock 'n' roll fans will have a Townshend other than his big
brother Pete to admire.
   ``I did my work in the same way that Pete did,'' the 29-year-old
guitarist said as he prepared for a club date in Nashville.
   ``A lot of people think that was a gift that Pete passed onto
me,'' he said, noting it takes more sweat than favors to get a
musical career off the ground. ``I intend to prove myself, however
long it takes.''
   His big brother is a tough act to follow. Pete is a guitarist
for The Who and as composer of such rock classics as ``Tommy.''
Simon's mainstream rock band has an album partly recorded in
Nashville nearing release.
   Simon was 14 when he began his music career by recording ``When
I'm a Man'' for Warner Bros. in England.
   ``A friend of my Dad's said, `Why don't we put Simon in the
studio and make a record?''' he recalled. ``I suppose in a way it
was trying to cash in on the family name and make a quick buck.''

JOHN WESLEY HARDING'S LYRICS POINT TO THE BRASH BRITISH ROCKER'S ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
What do you say to an Englishman bold enough to drop out of a Ph.D program at 
Cambridge University to pursue his rock 'n' roll dreams, and one daring enough 
to take his stage name from the title of an old Bob Dylan album and then write 
his own '90s version of a Rolling Stones classic? 
</P>
<P>
The man is John Wesley Harding and the thing you say to him is, "How about a 
recording contract?" At least if you're Seymour Stein, the Sire Records chief 
whose discoveries include Talking Heads, Madonna, k.d. lang and the Pretenders. 
</P>
<P>
"My manager went into Seymour's office ahead of me and said, 'Here's the future 
of rock 'n' roll' or whatever it is managers say," Harding said good-naturedly 
when recounting his audition early last year at the Sire office in London. 
</P>
<P>
"I played two songs and he said, 'Fine. . . . Do you want the contract before 
or after lunch?' " 
</P>
<P>
When asked in a separate interview to confirm the account, Stein, president of 
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and a stickler for accuracy, paused when the 
story was repeated to him. Something didn't seem right. 
</P>
<P>
"No . . . no," he said finally, quite seriously. "It was after dinner -- not 
after lunch. It was dinner, I'm sure." 
</P>
<P>
But what about the two-song part? Was that really all that it took to get the 
contract? 
</P>
<P>
"I always respond quickly," Stein said. "When I hear something, I know it. I 
remember the time I stood outside of CBGB in New York waiting to see the 
Ramones and all of a sudden I heard David Byrne singing (with Talking Heads) 
and I was swooped up. 
</P>
<P>
"The same with Wes. He was just sitting in our conference room, but I was 
swooped up again. I could picture what the record would sound like and I could 
picture him in front of an audience. He's got a great future. He's young, he's 
prolific and he wants to be a success." 
</P>
<P>
Once you meet Harding, the new brash young man of British rock, it's easy to 
see why the compact-disc version of his first U.S. album contains 65 minutes of 
music, almost 50% more than the average album. 
</P>
<P>
Harding, 24, is a such a waterfall of energy, ideas and ambition that it's a 
wonder his U.S. debut collection, "Here Comes the Groom," didn't end up a 
three-record set. 
</P>
<P>
Harding has the good looks and confident aura of a campus leader, speaks with a 
sprinter's speed and ricochets between subjects so often during interviews that 
you wonder if he has disciplined enough to be a meaningful artist. 
</P>
<P>
Born Wesley Harding Stace, Harding claims to have written more than 140 songs 
in the two years since he dropped out of Cambridge, where he was pursuing a 
doctorate in social and political science. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the 15 songs on the new album are too wordy and some images collide 
rather than reinforce each other, but the best songs -- including "The Devil in 
Me," his lively update of the Stones' "Sympathy for the Devil" -- add up to an 
exceptionally promising U.S. debut. 
</P>
<P>
"With half an eye on history / and half an ounce of hope," Harding sings in the 
album's opening tune, and it summarizes nicely the evocative blend of innocence 
and savvy in what is the most appealing blend of lyric invention and emotional 
grace since Peter Case's "The Man With the Blue Postmodern Fragmented 
Neo-Traditionalist Guitar" album last year. 
</P>
<P>
In songs such as "Spaced Cowgirl," a reflection on a woman being consumed by 
her misplaced dreams, Harding asserts the dazzling wordplay and verbal sting 
associated with another Englishman, Elvis Costello: 
</P>
<P>
 You can be a good lover 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer nails into hearts 
</P>
<P>
 You can be a big loser 
</P>
<P>
 When the real horror starts 
</P>
<P>
 One of the complaints raised about the album, in fact, is that Harding sounds 
too much like Costello, both in the lyrics' irony and wit and in his vocal 
phrasing. But the comparisons don't seem to bother Harding. 
</P>
<P>
"If I was worried about being accused of (copying) Costello, I would never have 
used two members of Elvis' backing band because that draws even more attention 
to the Elvis issue," Harding said, sipping coffee at a fast-food restaurant 
around the corner from the Palace in Hollywood, where he would later perform an 
acoustic set on a tour with two other young attractions, the Mighty Lemon Drops 
and Ocean Blue. 
</P>
<P>
"Elvis is a great songwriter and he has been an influence on me, but not as 
much as Nick Lowe and Graham Parker, who were both influences on Elvis. I'm not 
in the same generation as Elvis, but we both heard a lot of the same music 
growing up." 
</P>
<P>
The "Groom" album hasn't broken into the national pop charts, but it is already 
a Top 20 favorite in the CMJ New Music Report, which surveys playlists of 
college and alternative rock radio stations and often spotlights artists of 
commercial and/or critical significance long before the formal pop charts. 
Harding's "The Devil in Me" video is also being shown on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
"The Devil in Me," which has been released as a single, and "Cathy's New 
Clown," a play on the Everly Brothers' old hit "Cathy's Clown," show how 
Harding uses the literature of rock to his advantage. Elsewhere on the album, 
he offers a virtual resume of his own musical influences and intentions in a 
song titled "Bastard Son." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Dylan is my father 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Baez is my mother 
</P>
<P>
 And I'm their bastard son ... 
</P>
<P>
 Though my roots show through 
</P>
<P>
 I'm just 22 ... 
</P>
<P>
 And I don't belong to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the frequent references to rock history in his songs? 
</P>
<P>
"I happen to believe that rock has a history just as literature does and it's 
good to use that history," Harding said. "Some of the best literature reflects 
on other literature. Some of the best films are responses to other films. So 
rock should have those same liberties. 'Cathy's New Clown' is a 1990 version of 
the Everly Brothers tune. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were to sing the original 'Cathy's Clown,' I would 
</P>
<P>
be accused of trying to be Jonathan Richman, someone who was very naive or 
whatever. So this is trying to express the same emotion, but within the context 
of today's musical attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
Harding grew up in Hastings, a town south of London, in a musical family -- his 
mother sang opera and his schoolteacher father played piano. The highly 
opinionated Harding cites the Beatles as early rock heroes. 
</P>
<P>
He was heavily into Dylan during his early teens, but Harding didn't begin 
thinking about songwriting himself until much later. 
</P>
<P>
"Dylan was too intimidating," he said. "He was like a genius and he still is to 
me. How could you imagine ever writing a song as great as 'It's Alright, Ma 
(I'm Only Bleeding)'?" 
</P>
<P>
Through his interest in Dylan, however, Harding began listening to other 
folk-oriented songwriters, including Phil Ochs, Steve Goodman, David Blue, John 
Prine and Eric Andersen -- and those records eventually made him think about 
writing songs himself. 
</P>
<P>
After earning his degree in English literature from Cambridge and then spending 
a few months in the Ph.D program, Harding gave in to his rising passion for 
music and dropped out of school in 1988. Within a few months, he landed the 
opening slot on a tour by the then largely unknown Irish group Hothouse 
Flowers. 
</P>
<P>
The tour turned the Flowers into stars in Europe and attracted enough attention 
for Harding that he put out a hastily recorded album on Demon Records, an 
independent label in England. 
</P>
<P>
But Harding -- a name he had adopted playfully in the tradition of Dylan's and 
Costello's appropriation of their heroes' names -- was already looking beyond 
the cultish, independent record scene. He wanted the exposure and promotion 
muscle found only on major labels. Thus, the Sire audition. 
</P>
<P>
After the Lemon Drops/Ocean Blue tour ends, Harding hits the road again in the 
U.S., opening this time for singer Michelle Shocked. That tour is expected to 
reach Southern California early in June. Then he goes on the road in Europe for 
the first time with a rock band. 
</P>
<P>
Harding's themes, laced with humor and commentary, mostly revolve around 
questions of integrity and values, but he often treats those issues in ways 
that encompass both personal and social agendas. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of my material is autobiographical, though I try to write them in a way 
that doesn't focus on that," he said. "A lot of my songs make leaps from a 
political situation to a personal situation. That's because it is as important 
to be nice to your mother as to vote labor." 
</P>
<P>
As feisty as his most biting lyrics, Harding feels alienated from much of 
modern pop-rock, which he dismisses as lacking in passion and purpose. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a fan of pop music, but I hate what it has become," he said. "It's so rank 
at the moment, so terrible, the most grotesque thing. There are dozens of 
artists I love, from Peter Case to John Hiatt. But there are hundreds who are 
disgraceful and they're the ones who always seem to be on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wrote a song called 'The People's Drug.' I got the title from a 
pharmacy chain in Washington. It's about how religion used to be called the 
opium of the people, but now it's pop music. It is music without ideas or charm 
. . . music that has been filtered through synthesizers to remove the humanity 
and the heart. I just think it's time to go back to what made rock 'n' roll 
important in the first place."

Joan Lesnick sometimes has fun answering the phone in a little girl's voice, 
forcing the caller to ask, "Is your mommy home?" 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that she's 53, has four children and four great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's fun," she says. 
</P>
<P>
It's the same voice she uses while singing in her own band. It's reminiscent of 
the tiny-voice style of Wee Bonnie Baker, who recorded the 1930s hit "Oh 
Johnny, Oh Johnny, Oh!" 
</P>
<P>
"I really don't have a singer's voice," said Lesnick. "I have a funny voice, 
and everyone laughs. Kids love it, and when I sing in a club -- even the chef 
comes out to see who's singing." She also plays a banjo and a washboard in her 
novelty band called the Raggtimers, made up of mostly retired people. "I'm the 
youngest one, and I'm no spring chicken but I feel like one," she said.

The band was one of the featured entertainment groups at the Fourth of July 
Concert on the Green at Irvine High School. They've also performed in Long 
Beach at the Spruce Goose and at Disneyland. 
</P>

Lesnick played in an all-banjo band in El Monte for eight years before forming 
the Raggtimers. 
</P>
<P>
She also plays banjo with the 33-member Long Beach Senior Band every Wednesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy with my life," said the Irvine woman, whose first job was as a 
roller-skating waitress in a roller rink. She was 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to tell you that music keeps people young," she said during an 
interview at her home. 
</P>
<P>
That's one of the reasons she likes to take her band to retirement homes 
throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"They hug us, and we hug them," she said. "I love to be with them." And she 
likes to tell everyone she is the spitting image of Bette Midler -- or at least 
used to look like her. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm a little heavy, but I can't worry about that because my life is so 
busy," she said in her rat-a-tat speaking delivery. But she notes that "when I 
dress up I really look good." 
</P>
<P>
She also said she was a waitress in a Detroit nightclub where Lily Tomlin was a 
hatcheck girl. 
</P>
<P>
With that fact out of the way, "let's talk about music," she sort of ordered. 
"People should hear music from all over the world because music is love." 
</P>
<P>
When her band performs and plays upbeat songs, "you see men and women jumping 
all around. Songs like that make people happy because they remember the old 
days when they felt good." 
</P>
<P>
And then she added: "Did I tell you I play with another band called High 
Society in Costa Mesa? We play for balls and private parties." 
</P>
<P>
Lesnick said she can play just about any song on her $1,300 banjo and notes 
that she has only taken a few lessons. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a picker, and if I hear it (a song) I can play it," she said. "I'm not 
accomplished, but I have the rest of my life to improve myself." 
</P>
<P>
She also had a parting message: "Tell everyone I can make any party a success." 
</P>

   Bob Dylan will return to his home state
this summer for RiverFest, a 10-day festival of music along the
banks of the Mississippi River.
   Born in Duluth and raised in Hibbing, Dylan got his start
singing in coffeehouses near the University of Minnesota in 1959.
But he has performed locally only three times since _ at the
Minneapolis Auditorium in 1965, the St. Paul Civic Center in 1978
and the Metrodome in 1986.
   Other scheduled performers in the festival to be held July 28 to
Aug. 6 include blues-rockers Stevie Ray Vaughan and George
Thorogood, rapper Tone Loc, and rock bands Cheap Trick and Joan
Jett and the Blackhearts.
   But festival promoter Randy Levy said Dylan undoubtedly will be
the star attraction: ``Let this festival be known as the one that
brought Bob Dylan home.''

   Country singer Lorrie Morgan was
appointed to administer the estate of her late husband, singer
Keith Whitley, and a judge ordered an inventory of Whitley's
outstanding recording royalties.
   Whitley, who died May 9 of an alcohol overdose, left no will,
according to a Probate Court petition filed by Morgan, under her
legal name of Loretta Lynn Whitley.
   The petition said the late singer owned real estate worth more
than $100,000, which will automatically go to his wife as the
surviving joint owner.
   Morgan, a member of the Grand Ole Opry, estimated the value of
her husband's personal property at more than $80,000 and the gross
value of Whitley's estate at $50,000. She said she and the couple's
two children are Whitley's only heirs.

   Andrei Sakharov and his wife Yelena Bonner
have accepted an invitation to visit Norway later this month, the
Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research,
said Thursday.
   Sakharov was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975 while still
branded a dissident. His wife was permitted to accept the prize on
his behalf in Oslo.
   Both the Council and the Norwegian Nobel Committee have
frequently invited the couple to visit Norway after Sakharov was
allowed to leave the closed city of Gorky, where he spent several
years in internal exile.
   The couple plan to leave Moscow on June 15 and visit the
Netherlands and Britain before arriving in Oslo on June 26 or 27.

   Employees at Riverside Hospital chose
Kenny G to perform at a special concert and the saxophonist
rewarded them with a special musical preview while they worked.
   Offered the choice of a dinner or a show, hospital employees
opted for a show and selected Kenny G over Ray Charles, Johnny
Cash, the Statler Brothers, Frankie Avalon, dancer Gregory Hines
and others. The hospital hired him to perform Wednesday night at
the Ohio Theater in a concert for employees and their families.
   Kenny G also performed for several patients at the hospital and
stopped by the nursery to serenade 1- and 2-day-olds.
   ``After he played he said, `That's all right, you guys you don't
have to stand,' '' said Erie Chapman, the hospital's president and
chief executive officer.
   ``I think it was a thrill for the atients and the people taking
care of them,'' Chapman said. ``You almost feel like it (music) has
a healing effect itself.''
   Chapman said he did not know how much the hospital paid for
Kenny G's one-hour performance, but it would cost about the same as
dinner for 3,000 people _ about $30,000.
   The hospital's employee recognition program was scheduled to be
held before the concert. In the program, employees receive awards
for years of service and other accomplishments.

   Jean Harris, killer of ``Scarsdale Diet Doctor''
Herman Tarnower, says she is remorseful about his death.
   ``Remorse has become an appendage to me,'' Ms. Harris told
Independent Network News in an interview this week at the Bedford
Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester County.
   ``It's like another skin and I live in it and I always will,''
said Ms. Harris, 66.
   She said she feels ``terrible, terribly sorry. You don't throw
it off.''
   Ms. Harris said Tarnower could have prevented his death by
talking to her calmly when she confronted him about a love affair.
Instead, she said, he called her ``crazy'' and hit her in the face.
She then shot him to death.
   Ms. Harris was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison in March
1981. She has appealed twice to Gov. Mario Cuomo for clemency,
without success.

   As bluish fog swirls across the Phantasy Theater stage, a punk-rock group called the Dead Boys unleashes its ferociously loud tune called "Sonic Reducer." 
Youths in black leather jackets and in miniskirts are moving to the beat, and so is a bleached blonde old enough to be their grandmother. 

   Wearing earplugs and bifocals and clutching a bulging, oversized handbag, Jane Scott appears to have wandered into the wrong auditorium. 
But Miss Scott, who considers herself the "world's oldest teenager," plays a critical role in determining whether regional groups like the Dead Boys make it in the multibillion-dollar rock industry. 

   At the age of 67, Miss Scott is the nation's senior rock 'n' roll critic in a city as much associated with rock music as New Orleans is with jazz. 
Indeed, Cleveland is to be the future home of the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame. 

   As a launching pad, "Cleveland was the break-out city," says Don George, the regional promotional manager for MCA Records. 
And Miss Scott was often a seminal influence. 
"She was at the first gigs of lots of stars when they were zeros," declares Steve Popovich, the executive vice president of Nashville operations for Polygram Records Inc. 
"She's a real national treasure who belongs in the Hall of Fame." 

   Since the Beatles came to town in 1964, her reviews in the Cleveland Plain Dealer have helped launch such stars as Bruce Springsteen; David Bowie; Blood, Sweat & Tears; and the Fabulous Thunderbirds. 
Paul McCartney, on tour with his group, Wings, told her recently that he remembered her from his early Beatle days because, Miss Scott says, "I was the only middle-aged woman who interviewed him." 
She adds: "I wasn't flattered." 

   A local group called Beaucoup, on the verge of cracking the big time, plans to record a song called "Jane," just to thank her for her help. 

   In part, Miss Scott has succeeded by outlasting almost everyone else in a business in which burnout often strikes early. 
For two decades, she covered not just rockers but also the elderly -- leading a local magazine to say she ran the gamut from "geriatrics and pacemakers to Gerry and the Pacemakers." 
But several years ago she began devoting full time to rock coverage. 
"I like the excitement and the turmoil," Miss Scott says. 

   Her longevity in her job reflects a knack for reviewing groups through the eyes of a teen-ager. 
In her critique of the Dead Boys, for instance, she complains that the lead singer "didn't try to hang himself . . . 
He didn't flop around like a dying trout. 
He didn't even spit or knock his forehead on the floor." (He had pulled such stunts in earlier shows.) 
And rather than take the four-member group to task for obvious mistakes, she notes that "the band has all the potential to get down to work, tighten up and soar." 

   Unlike many of her peers, most of whom are males in their 30s, she never takes herself too seriously. 
Once she led a platoon of golden agers, box radios tucked under their arms, who picketed a local radio station to pressure it into playing an album called "The Golden Age of Rock." 
When singer Lou Reed was with the Velvet Underground, Miss Scott posed in his lap for a magazine cover. 

   Yet Miss Scott is tenacious. 
She has a legendary knack for getting interviews, even from tight-lipped performers -- by offering to read their palms, by analyzing their handwriting, or by getting them to autograph their albums. 

   If such ploys fail, Miss Scott sometimes will try acting the understanding matron. 
Joe Eszterhas, a contributing editor of Rolling Stone magazine and writer of the movies "Jagged Edge" and "Flashdance," recalls unsuccessfully competing against her for an interview with the late Jim Morrison of the Doors. 
"I had all the right accouterments," he says. 
"I was bearded, my hair was long. 
But I didn't get anywhere." 
Miss Scott, however, got Mr. Morrison to spend an hour on the phone discussing religion, the future and life in general. 
"Maybe because I was older, he found it easy to talk to me," says Miss Scott with a shrug. 

   Miss Scott leads a double life, as possessions in her cluttered apartment demonstrate. 
One large closet is jammed with shelves of rock 'n' roll albums. 
A bedroom overflows with antique gum-ball machines and maps, newspapers and directories dating back to the early 1800s. 
In her living room, a stereo surrounded by dozens of books about rock music faces an Edison wind-up phonograph that plays cylinders of turn-of-the-century tangos. 
She uses two telephones -- one modern and the other made in 1910. 

   "I collect antiques because I get absorbed in another world, and it's very relaxing," says Miss Scott. 
So even at home, she tends to span the ages. 

   Indeed, Miss Scott claims that one difference between her and most of her friends is that they are locked musically into certain time periods. 
"Some of my girlfriends who are 20 years younger will light up when you say Four Tops," she says, "but they don't know anything about Joan Jett." 
She is referring to the emerging rock star who plays actor Michael J. Fox's older sister in a current movie, "Light of Day," which was filmed in Cleveland. 

   "I'm always with younger people, so I don't know that I'm not 15 to 19 years old," Miss Scott says. 
She would like to write about rock forever, she says, because "it's always new and crazy -- and always changing." 

   The Plain Dealer uses only a limited amount of free-lance and syndicated articles to back up Miss Scott because she is so prolific. 
She writes at least three columns and features for the Plain Dealer's Friday tabloid and another two to three reviews for the rest of the week. 
Rumors circulated recently that she might be forced to give up the rock beat. 
Plain Dealer editors, excited that the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame is coming to Cleveland, confided to some reporters that they were thinking of replacing her with a younger, flashier writer. 
That prompted 126 Plain Dealer colleagues to petition editors to reconsider. 
Also, a local FM station, WMMS, which is consistently picked the best rock station in the country by Rolling Stone magazine, rallied behind her. 

   Thom Greer, the Plain Dealer's managing editor, says any change involving Miss Scott's beat "is an internal matter. 
I can't discuss it further." 
But, for the moment at least, it appears that Miss Scott will keep the rock beat. 

   Miss Scott, a one-time Sunday-school teacher and Republican Party booster, didn't always spend her evenings and weekends with pimply-faced adolescents. 
She started with the Plain Dealer in 1952, typing up bridal announcements for the society page. 
"That was the only way a girl could get a job on a newspaper," she says. 
In 1958, she landed on the paper's "Boy &amp; Girl" pages, which led to writing about pop-music groups at area high schools. 

   Miss Scott didn't get hooked on rock until 1964. 
That's when Cleveland's mayor briefly banned rock concerts after a Beatles performance turned into a riot. 
After that, she covered virtually every performer who stopped here as well as emerging local groups. 

   Miss Scott continues to address her readers' varied and changing tastes. 
Larry Collins, a talent buyer and promoter at a local club called Peabody's Down Under, says that while other critics cover only mainstream rock 'n' roll, Miss Scott "tries to turn people on to college groups, cult stuff, alternative stuff." 

   Take the Mentors, for example. 
"They're a porno rock group," explains Miss Scott. 
She interviewed them for a story even though, she says, "the names of their songs aren't printable in a family newspaper. 
They're disgusting. 
But my theory is that you still have to know what's going on out there." 

   Miss Scott blends into most concert audiences, dressing casually in slacks and flat shoes, but she refuses to smoke marijuana. 
Occasionally, she flashes a handwritten sign that says, "Yes, I'm a reporter" to ease fears that she is a narcotics agent. 

   Over the years, Miss Scott has made only minor adjustments to deal with her demanding beat. 
She never leaves for a concert, for instance, without taking her earplugs. 
"I don't put them on till it really gets loud. 
Then, you hear the concert, but anything beyond the pain level is eliminated."

   Although much has been made of the Woodstock
generation's aging, the heroes of the festival are for the most
part doing now what they did then.
   In the order they appear on a monument at Yasgur's farm, here's
who are and what became of them:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Richie Havens: Still performing, still an activist. Currently
on a 20th anniversary tour with several other Woodstock veterans.
   _ Arlo Guthrie: The son of legendary folk singer Woody Guthrie
is still performing.
   _ Joan Baez: Her activist work continues unabated. She appeared
at Live Aid. In 1987, she released her memoirs ``And a Voice to
Sing With,'' and a new album, ``Recently.''
   _ Joe Cocker: His career took off after Woodstock. Still
performing; nominated for an Academy Award in 1983 for ``Up Where
We Belong,'' his duet with Jennifer Warnes for the movie, ``An
Officer and a Gentleman.''
   _ Ravi Shankar: The sitar player who introduced George Harrison
to Eastern music is still performing. He is 69.
   _ Janis Joplin: Died on Oct. 4, 1970, of a drug overdose. She
was 27.
   _ Jimi Hendrix: Died on Sept. 18, 1970, of a drug overdose. He
was 27.
   _ Johnny Winter: The original (and only) albino blues guitarist
enjoyed his greatest success after Woodstock; still playing.
   _ Creedence Clearwater Revival: Broke up in October 1972. Lead
singer John Fogerty's latest solo release was 1986's ``Eye of the
Zombie.''
   _ Mountain: Split in 1972. Guitarist Leslie West released a solo
album last year; bassist Felix Pappalardi was shot and killed by
his wife in April 1983.
   _ Santana: The band has flourished for two decades with a
variety of line-ups. A Carlos Santana retrospective, titled ``Viva
Santana!,'' was released last year.
   _ John Sebastian: Also on the 20th anniversary tour. His last
hit was 1976's theme for ``Welcome Back, Kotter;'' his name is
misspelled on the Woodstock memorial plaque as ``Sabastian.''
   _ The Who: Singer Roger Daltrey, guitarist Pete Townshend and
bassist John Entwistle are on a 25th anniversary tour, ending a
seven-year layoff. Drummer Keith Moon died of an overdose on Sept.
7, 1978. He was 32.
   _ Canned Heat: Broke up in 1976. Two of its founders died:
guitarist Al ``Blind Owl'' Wilson on Sept. 3, 1970, and vocalist
Bob ``The Bear'' Hite of a drug-related heart attack in April 1981.
   _ The Grateful Dead: Touring again this summer. A new album is
due in September from the band, which has repeatedly called its
Woodstock performance mediocre. Keyboardist Ron ``Pigpen'' McKernan
died of a liver ailment in May 1973. He was 27.
   _ Paul Butterfield Blues Band: The pioneering white blues band
started the blues explosion of the 1960s and broke up in 1972.
Butterfield died on May 5, 1987, of a drug overdose. He was 44.
   _ Sly and the Family Stone: Despite a brilliant Woodstock set,
the group's success was short-lived; by 1973, their heyday was
over. Leader Sylvester Stewart has been plagued by drug problems
and last released an album in 1983.
   _ The Jefferson Airplane: After years of in-fighting, personnel
switches, lawsuits and a divorce, the Airplane reformed this summer
with original members Grace Slick, Jorma Kaukonen, Jack Casady,
Paul Kantner and Marty Balin.
   _ The Band: The only act whose members lived in Woodstock. They
disbanded after ``The Last Waltz'' in 1976. Pianist Richard Manuel
committed suicide on March 4, 1986; its other members are still
performing.
   _ Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young: Reunited last year for
``American Dream,'' their first studio album since 1971's ``Deja
Vu.'' All four continue to perform separately and together. Crosby
detailed his drug addiction last year in a best-selling
autobiography, ``Long Time Gone.''
   _ Blood, Sweat and Tears: Their string of hits ended abruptly in
1971. They have continued to play, with and without vocalist David
Clayton Thomas.
   _ Melanie: Her career slowed down after such early '70s hits as
``Brand New Key.'' Also on the 20th anniversary tour, and has an
album due out this year.
   _ Ten Years After: Guitarist-vocalist Alvin Lee's band
dissembled in May 1975. Reunited this year with new LP, ``About
Time,'' their first in 15 years. During split, Lee has been
performing, while bassist Leo Lyons, keyboardist Chick Churchill
and drummer Rick Lee have stayed in music, producing, engineering
and managing. Last summer a German promoter offered to hire Ten
Years After for four festivals.
   _ Sweetwater: The Los Angeles group released three albums and
broke up in 1971. Lead singer Nancy Nevins de Johgh is now a
short-story writer.
   _ Sha-Na-Na: The '50s revival band has enjoyed continued success
(including a brief network television show) since Woodstock. Their
tour schedule includes shows in Las Vegas.
   _ The Incredible String Band: The Scottish group mixed Indian
music with rock 'n' roll. They split in the mid-'70s, although
co-leader Bruce Williamson still performs in Los Angeles.
   _ Country Joe and the Fish: The stars of the Woodstock movie and
soundtrack album split after the festival. Country Joe McDonald is
on the 20th anniversary tour.

   Jane Wiedlin's group consciousness started at
age 10 _ in church.
   ``I was raised Catholic, but we went to this sort of hippy
Catholic church,'' explained Wiedlin, the former Go-Go who has
released her third solo album, ``Tangled.''
   ``The preacher was this young, hip, cute priest. We had this
church band I was in. We'd sing the popular songs of the time. We'd
sing `Leaving on a Jet Plane' in church. We got away with bloody
murder.
   ``That environment sort of nurtured people to be socially aware,
and to try and be a good person. That group of people was trying to
live out the Christian ethic, trying to help other people.''
   She's craved community ever since, as a punk in Hollywood, as
rhythm guitarist for the Go-Go's and as an active member of the
animal rights movement. But she also takes time off to be alone, to
write songs about peace and love and consider the challenge of
making happy music in a sad world.
   ``I am somewhere in the middle,'' she said, dressed cheerfully
at the EMI Records office in a purple sweatshirt and purple shorts,
a purple headband wrapped around her jet black hair.
   ``I can really start thinking too much about everything, but on
the other hand, you can't give up. You got to keep trying. I think
life is full of small little joys that you have to grab onto.''
   Happiness is offered in three-minute bites on ``Tangled.'' This
is ear candy, but bittersweet, with fears of the future hidden
under sunny harmonies. In ``Flowers on the Battlefield,'' she
worries ``innocence gets crushed beneath the anger and desire, and
everything that's pure and good gets caught in the crossfire.''
   ``I wanted to write a song about war and not be so specific so
that that's all it could be about,'' she said. ``I wanted it to be
on all different levels, in war and relationships in general.
   ``It's not just the battlers that get hurt, but the innocent
victims as well. I'm kind of on the outside looking at the
situation. I was thinking more about children, really. The picture
in my head was of war and think of what gets decimated in the war,
of soldiers and children and animals.''
   With the Go-Go's, Wiedlin was right in the middle, the one who
left the band first and helped speed its breakup in 1985. She met
the other members _ Belinda Carlisle, Charlotte Caffey, Gina Schock
and Kathy Valentine _ in the late 1970s, in the Hollywood punk
clubs where Wiedlin hung out as a teen-ager.
   The Go-Go's, like the Beach Boys in the 1960s, presented fun as
a way of life. ``We Got the Beat'' set the tone, a snappy update of
the Beach Boys' ``I Get Around'' that captured the attitude of five
young women who wrote their own songs and played their own
instruments.
   But the breakup in 1985 was a nasty affair with name-calling and
finger-pointing and rumors of drugs and emotional problems.
Briefly, Wiedlin recalls, she was glad to get away.
   ``First there was the whole relief that everybody else's
problems weren't my problems anymore,'' she said. ``I had to deal
with emotional problems with four people who were worse off than I
was, basically.
   ``On my first solo album (`Jane Wiedlin'), I had a song called
`Traveling Heart,' which was about feeling disloyal and I was
writing about it because I was in love with two different men.
   ``But in the end, the song was about leaving the Go-Go's.
Because I had terrible guilt feelings about leaving the band. Talk
about leaving a deserting ship. I really felt like a rat.''
   ``Tangled'' is a good way of summing up her solo career. ``Jane
Wiedlin,'' which included a song called ``One Hundred Years of
Solitude,'' sold poorly. Her next record, ``Fur,'' quickly produced
a hit single, ``Inside a Dream,'' but was forgotten after the next
single flopped.
   ``They just of dropped the whole project. Goodbye Jane Wiedlin
until the next record,'' she said of her record company. ``It was
horrible at the time. I talked to them about it probably a thousand
times.
   ``I try and be nice about it, but shoot, it not only hurt my
feelings it hurt my career. I need some support this time. I know
everybody feels stupid and bad about that record.''
   Meanwhile, group consciousness has caught up with her again.
She's patched things up with the other Go-Go's and a November
reunion tour is planned.
   Wiedlin's married now and says a part of her really has settled
down and adjusted to being on her own. But still, there's something
about walking into a room and finding it filled with all these
people.
   ``I started missing the camaraderie and support system of being
in a band. I walked into the rehearsals straight off a plane,
having spent four nights on my own with this album in England,''
she said.
   ``They had already been in rehearsals for a week and I was so
panicked about being a Go-Go again and doing all these songs. But
it felt comfortable, and within minutes everybody was coming up
with jokes that we used to crack up at.''

   Four years ago in Austin, Texas, Laurie Freelove
had a plan: She wanted to meet Gretchen Phillips and start a band
with her.
   Around that same time, Phillips was mourning the demise of her
previous group, Meat Joy, and longed to start another one. She and
Freelove met and were soon playing guitar together at coffee houses.
They performed Monkees songs, rock 'n' roll, old movie tunes as well
as their own material.
   They called themselves Two Nice Girls.
   A few months later, Freelove and Phillips met Kathy Korniloff and
were so pleased with how their voices and guitars sounded together
they decided to add her to the group.
   The name? Two Nice Girls.
   ``That was my idea,'' Phillips explained. ``It beat the hell of
out of The Jackson Five. Some friends of mine were in a band called
Five Happy Guys. One of them left so they changed the name to The
Happiness Crew. We were called Two Nice Girls and hired somebody
else, but I didn't want to change the name.''
   They are a major part of a lively Austin music scene that has
attracted the attention of critics around the country. All three
Nice Girls, however, grew up elsewhere.
   Phillips attended Houston's High School for the Performing Arts
and headed to Austin after graduating.
   ``My first song was a duet that I wrote for my sister and I,''
she recalled. ``We would take baths together and it would take
forever. The song went, `102, oo oo oo . . 107, 111.' That was it.
Then we would take the washcloth and suck the water out of it. I had
no idea what it was about.''
   Freelove grew up in Alexandria, Va., and went to a Catholic
girls' high school outside of Rome.
   ``I've been writing songs since I was this high,'' Freelove said.
``I used to have to vacuum and clean the house and I used to make up
songs. I have tapes of almost everything I've done. I've got gobs of
tapes of when I was a little guy. I was a much better songwriter
when I was 13.''
   Korniloff, the daughter of violinists, lived in The Netherlands
and Scarsdale, N.Y.
   ``My first song was a very, very sad love song about a boy who
was supposed to my boyfriend who I caught with another girl. I was
so devastated. I went upstairs to the attic of my house with my
little guitar and played my heart out.''
   Their debut album, ``2 Nice Girls,'' features original songs from
all three and a unique overlapping of Lou Reed's ``Sweet Jane'' and
Joan Armatrading's ``Love and Affection.'' The version on ``2 Nice
Girls'' was a live performance on an Austin public radio station.
   ``We went on for an hour-long program called `Live Set,'''
Korniloff said. ``Our friends were all invited to be in the studio
and lend that live clapping air to the show.
   ``We tried a couple of times to record the song in the studio,
but we could never recapture vocally what we did that one time. As
it turned out, the station still had the master copy on two-track
which they let us use. They said, `It's your performance; we only
have the tape.'''
   The melodies and sweet harmonies make Two Nice Girls easy to
listen to, but ``My Heart Crawls Off,'' written by Phillips and Sara
Hickman, is a bitter song about jealousy.
   ``That's the power of being a songwriter,'' Phillips said. ``I
just wrote this horrible song about (President) Bush that's got a
really lovely melody. If I just made another punk anthem called `I
Hate You,' it wouldn't be really effective.''
   Freelove wrote ``Money,'' a long way from the Motown hit of the
same title that proclaimed, ``The best things in life are free, but
you can keep it for the bird and bees.'' Instead, Freelove warns
against being ``a slave to money.''
   ``It's about money and obsession and the ways it numbs you out,''
Freelove said. ``Money keeps many of us protected from distressing
things, disturbing things. People who have money can shield
themselves from observing the homeless.''
   Their sound recalls The Roches and Indigo Girls. But what could
have influenced Phillips' ``I Spent my Last Ten Dollars (on Birth
Control and Beer)'' or ``The Holland Song,'' in which Korniloff
sings, ``The Dutch are too much''?
   ``I don't really think of these songs as song of experience, but
songs of perspective,'' she said. ``I think that the content of the
songs are much more about how life ought to be. What we'd like for
it to be like.
   ``We consciously try to create a sense of community. It's more
likely to save us from horribly depressing lives. You have some sort
of good feelings. Bands are at an advantage, they're capable of
doing that.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Raitt Doesn't Want to Mellow With Age</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   As a Quaker, Bonnie Raitt has devoted long hours
to the cause of world peace. Once she straps a guitar around her
shoulder, however, the gloves come off.
   Equally adept at singing hard rockers and soulful ballads, she
emphasized in a recent interview that at 39, she does not intend to
mellow with age.
   Her new album, ``Nick of Time,'' contains music worthy of such
titles as ``I Will Not Be Denied,'' ``Real Man'' and ``I Ain't
Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again.''
   ``If anybody had any doubts about how I feel, they can just
listen to those three songs. `I Will Not Be Denied' is the
strongest statement on what I feel about love at the moment. The
songs are cathartic and I will be not denied. I will get what I
deserve. When you get beat up, you eventually stop taking it.''
   The past decade has been difficult for Raitt. Warner Bros., her
longtime record label, dropped her in 1983, refusing to release the
album she had just completed for three years. Contractual
difficulties forced her to tour without a band for the last two
years, and she had to overcome a drinking problem.
   But her luck has begun to change. When producer Hal Wilner put
together an album of Disney songs last year, he paired Raitt with
Don Was of Was (Not Was) on ``Baby Mine,'' from the ``Dumbo''
soundtrack. Raitt and Was became fast friends and he ended up
producing ``Nick of Time,'' released on Capitol Records.
   The album's 11 songs include covers of John Hiatt and Jerry L.
Williams as well as two Raitt compositions.
   ``I wanted to make it a roots, stripped down record,'' she said.
``It was an easily accomplished, well thought out, very smooth
album _ the best recording situation I've ever had.''
   Raitt, the daughter of Broadway singer John Raitt, was born in
Los Angeles and quickly became interested in music, learning folk
songs at summer camp.
   ``All the counselors were from colleges that were experiencing a
folk music revival. Being a little 10-year-old impressionable kid,
I idolized my counselors. I completely bought into Bob Dylan's
lyrics as seriously as the rest of America, but I was a little
kid.''
   Joan Baez was also an early favorite.
   ``She killed me when I was a kid. She was Quaker also. I wanted
so badly to have long hair and be thin. I'd look in the mirror and
wonder when I was going to get cheekbones.''
   Raitt's musical interests broadened as a teen-ager. She would
listen to early rock 'n' roll and soul music, and began a lifetime
passion for blues after entering Radcliffe College in 1967.
   ``Through the college radio station I met Dick Waterman, who
managed `Big Boy' Crudup and Mississippi John Hurt and had helped
rediscover Son House. We became really good friends and through him
I met all those blues guys. I got to travel, carry their things for
them and got to know all of them and watch them play.
   ``I was a complete blues nut but I never expected to do this for
a living. I just kind of played as a hobby. Then one day I needed
to make some money and a girl was playing at a club. I knew I was
at least as good as her.''
   Raitt's first two albums, ``Bonnie Raitt'' and ``Give It Up,''
came out in the early 1970s and showed her love of jazz, soul,
blues, folk and rock. She covered songs by the Marvelettes, Stephen
Stills, Jackson Browne and blues singer Sippie Wallace, another
major influence.
   Although just in her early 20s, Raitt showed surprising depth
and confidence, tackling the complex emotional themes of ``Love Has
No Pride'' and ``Too Long at the Fair.''
   ``People call and say the songs have really touched them, that a
song has gotten them through a difficult period or they met their
boyfriends through my show. You either touch people or you don't,
and if you're lucky you get to do it for a living.''
   She used a variety of producers in the '70s, including Paul
Rothchild and Peter Asher, who also worked with Linda Ronstadt and
James Taylor.
   ``I basically produce myself,'' Raitt said. ``I pick the songs
with the collaboration of the producer. The producer's a partner,
another set of ears. It's a voice of rationality when I get too
emotionally involved. ... You need to have a partner in there
because it's a lot of pressure.''
   Her political and musical interests merged in 1979 when she
helped organize the celebrated MUSE (Musicians United for Safe
Energy) concerts at Madison Square Garden. She continues to help
with a variety of causes, including the anti-apartheid movement in
South Africa, and the campaign against deforestation in the Amazon
jungle.
   ``I used to go to peace marches and civil rights marches when I
was a kid. I stuffed envelopes when I was 11. I first picked up the
guitar when I was a little kid because Bob Dylan and Joan Baez were
singing protest songs at peace marches.
   ``Justice is justice, whether it's between a man and a woman or
a guy and his dog.''
   Raitt concludes ``Nick of Time'' with an original song, ``The
Road's My Middle Name,'' a bluesy stomp that reaffirms her
dedication to music.
   ``I never pretended to be a great artist or a great
originator,'' she said. ``I'm just an interpreter of good music. If
my voice and guitar playing, sensibility of putting together a
band, and arrangement of songs appeals to a certain group of
people, then all I need is enough fans to allow me to pay the
musicians.''

<P>
In the parlor below the deck of her houseboat docked on the Potomac, a youngish 
woman -- blond and dressed in white -- recounts the dream and nightmare of her 
search for her long-hidden legend-filled past. 
</P>
<P>
Among the framed old photographs decorating the wood-paneled room, there is 
only one that really matters to Jett Williams: a black-and-white picture of a 
handsome young man in a cowboy hat with a dreamy expression on his face. 
</P>
<P>
It is no ordinary face, no ordinary family photograph. The man is famous, an 
immortal icon of popular culture. Pictures just like this belong to his fans 
all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
But this 37-year-old married woman, who has embarked on a show business career 
of her own, is more than an overzealous fan. The man in the photograph is the 
object of a 15-year obsession that has taken her down a long, lonesome road of 
legal battles and family feuds that have resulted in a complete transformation 
of her identity. 
</P>
<P>
He is the legendary country singer-songwriter Hank Williams. And she -- unaware 
of it until she was 21 -- is his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Hank Williams is more than just a singer and composer; he can be credited, with 
the equally legendary Roy Acuff, of being a founder of country music. His songs 
emphasize the poetic beauty of romantic misery. Such Williams classics as "Your 
Cheatin' Heart" and "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry" formed the basic vocabulary 
of the country repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
The story of Jett Williams -- adopted at age 3 -- and her struggle to establish 
her identity as her father's daughter is a tale of more pathos, more twists and 
turns, than a country ballad. 
</P>
<P>
It is a story that has the ingredients of a Southern Gothic novel: a baby whose 
father dies five days before she is born and whose mother abandoned her; 
betrayal by relatives who placed her for adoption; a fight over an inheritance; 
the refusal of the legitimate son to recognize his illegitimate sibling; 
persistence in the face of great odds; a fortuitous discovery of a hidden 
document; and, for good measure, a love affair with and eventual marriage to 
the lawyer who helped right the wrongs. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond and above all the maneuverings and scheming is the transcendent theme of 
the love of a daughter for a father she would never know and her belief in his 
love for her. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe that I've had a guardian angel -- I really, really do. And I've 
implied that I think my father is my guardian angel, and that he's looking 
down," Williams says in her Alabama accent. 
</P>
<P>
With the help of ghostwriter Pamela Thomas, Williams has written about her life 
in "Ain't Nothin' as Sweet as My Baby" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich). The book's 
publication date is today, the birthday of Hank Williams Sr. 
</P>
<P>
If there is one thing Jett Williams has learned from her decision to get to the 
bottom of the truth about her past, it is that her efforts to establish herself 
as who she really is -- Hank Williams' daughter -- have been met with less than 
sentimental appreciation by many people, including relatives in her real and 
adoptive families. 
</P>
<P>
Her half-brother, Hank Williams Jr., 42, a celebrated country singer in his own 
right, refuses to acknowledge his half-sister, although he and his lawyers have 
been aware of her existence for at least 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
They declined to discuss the case. "Since there is ongoing litigation between 
us, our policy is not to comment," said attorney Chris Horsnell of Wyatt, 
Tarrant, Combs, Gilbert &amp; Milom, the Nashville firm that represents Hank 
Williams Jr. 
</P>
<P>
In 1987, Jett Williams -- as she is known professionally and to most of her 
friends but whose legal married name is Cathy Deupree Adkinson -- established 
in Montgomery County Circuit Court in Montgomery, Ala., that she was the 
biological daughter of Hank Williams. 
</P>
<P>
But she has yet to succeed in laying hold on the corollary to that fact: her 
share of her father's estate and his royalties -- which are said to amount to 
about $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
Many of those who knew Hank Williams Sr. and have met his daughter agree that 
she resembles him. She has the same distinct features and steady gaze. 
</P>
<P>
Her quest for her father has a character of almost religious intensity that 
represents an unsettling precedent for other families with adopted children who 
decide to seek out their roots. 
</P>
<P>
She always knew she was adopted because she could remember arriving at the home 
of her adoptive parents, a prosperous Mobile, Ala., businessman named Wayne 
Deupree and his wife, Louise. When Jett Williams was 21, her adoptive parents 
visited her at the University of Alabama in Montgomery to tell her about a 
$2,000 legacy left her by a relative of her real father. 
</P>
<P>
With a clumsiness that only well-meaning relatives can achieve, Louise Deupree 
informed her adopted daughter that her real father was famous, a famous 
musician from Montgomery, and suggested that she take a guess at who he was. 
The then-Cathy Deupree guessed Hank Williams quickly, not an odd coincidence in 
view of his celebrity in Alabama. Her mother went on to tell her that there was 
no proof. 
</P>
<P>
In her 20s, Williams married and worked as a recreational officer in the parks 
system of Montgomery. The idea of Hank Williams would not go away, and she set 
about trying to garner information about her past. She encountered many brick 
walls. Finally, as she was about to give up, she was introduced by a relative 
to a Washington lawyer, F. Keith Adkinson, who had served as chairman of 
Democrats for Reagan in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately, Adkinson took an interest in the case and, subsequently, a 
personal interest in Williams. After Williams was divorced from her first 
husband, she and Adkinson married in 1986, and Williams says much of her 
strength is due to her relationship with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, she and Adkinson had initiated legal action in Alabama and New York. 
In July, 1989, the Alabama State Supreme Court found that Williams had been the 
victim of fraud and ruled that the estate of Hank Williams Sr. be reopened, 15 
years after it was closed. Williams has been judged an heir of equal dignity 
with her half-brother; his application to have the case appealed to the U.S. 
Supreme Court has been denied. 
</P>
<P>
In New York, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals reversed earlier orders 
denying Williams a claim on her father's royalties and the Federal District 
Court, Southern District of New York, has judged that she should be given a 
jury trial to hear the merits of her claim. 
</P>
<P>
Williams and Adkinson are understandably delighted with their legal 
achievements. For five intense years, they have lived with the emotional 
repercussions of intra-family litigation. Since that time, Williams has also 
sued her adoptive family over the contested will of her adoptive mother, who 
died in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
There have been few questions in Williams' mind as to whether it has been worth 
it. "I feel I'm a more positive person now," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't choose your real parents. For me the point is finding out what my 
father wanted and then carrying out his wishes," says Williams, and she returns 
to this idea, over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, she says, her life, from the time she was adopted, has always been in 
the power of the courts. "My life is still being decided by the stroke of pens 
-- somebody signs an order, and all of a sudden 'Bingo.' " 
</P>
<P>
There have been many personal changes as a result of the pen strokes that have 
brought her closer to her real father. 
</P>
<P>
She has adopted a stage name made up of the last names of both her natural 
mother (Bobbie Jett) and father. She moved from Montgomery to Washington after 
she met and married Adkinson. And she has long since ceased being a recreation 
officer and embarked on a singing career that emulates that of her father, 
including singing his songs, and wearing white, his signature color. 
</P>
<P>
Williams recognizes that her quest has not been without its complications: "On 
this hand, I got this, and on that hand, I lose that. You win a father and you 
never saw him." 
</P>
<P>
Her story is different in several respects from that of the typical adoptee. 
Although her natural parents were not married, they never planned to put her up 
for adoption. She was put up for adoption because of the action of her father's 
sister, contrary to wishes he had expressed in writing. This distinction has 
given extra credence to her camp's legal arguments that she is a legitimate 
heir. 
</P>
<P>
Before her birth, Williams' parents signed a contract that provided for her 
custody, partly with her father, Hank Williams, and partly with her mother. 
This document had been hidden for 30 years and came to light in circumstances 
that Adkinson will not divulge except to say that it was found in 1984 in 
Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
For Williams, who never dreamed she would see written, signed, notarized 
evidence that she was her father's daughter, it was the high point of her 
search. "When I got that contract and I knew that he wanted me and that he was 
my father, I just knew that I had to carry out his wishes, which I feel weren't 
carried out." 
</P>
<P>
Hank Williams' songs aptly reflected a life of emotional confusion. Williams' 
mother, Bobbie Jett, was six months pregnant with her when Hank Williams 
married his second wife, Billie Jean Eshliman. 
</P>
<P>
In 1953, five days before his daughter was born, Williams died in the back of a 
baby blue Cadillac. The cause of death, though never definitely established, 
has been presumed to have been from complications brought on by alcohol and 
drug addiction. He was 29 years old. 
</P>
<P>
However, Hank Williams had considered what would happen to his daughter should 
he not be around to take care of her personally. He had asked his mother, 
Lillian Stone, to adopt the child should such a situation arise. 
</P>
<P>
This she did. But her action did not protect the little girl, then called Cathy 
Yvonne Stone, from the state adoption system. In a second twist, Lillian Stone 
also died a short time after the adoption was legal. Provisions that had been 
made to care for the baby in the Williams' family by Hank's sister, Irene 
Smith, were not taken up. Hank Williams' daughter went to the state for 
eventual adoption. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know exactly why Irene Smith chose not to keep me. I think it might 
have been because of wagging tongues, but I'll never know for sure," Williams 
says. Contacted by telephone in Texas, Irene Smith said she did not want to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
As part of her battle to assemble the truth about her past, Williams has had to 
face unpalatable facts. "I guess, as an adopted child, once you cross the 
barrier of 'I want to know' then you pursue it. It's the 'want to know' 
strength that keeps you going, even when you hit a dead end." 
</P>
<P>
But Williams cautions other adoptees to think carefully before pursuing a 
course like hers: "I wanted to warn adopted children to be careful when you do 
this because it doesn't always turn out. You have to prepare yourself for the 
worst-case scenario. I encourage adoptive parents that if the time comes, you 
should be a part of it -- if you can be a part of it, then you don't alienate 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
In Williams' own case, her adoptive father, Wayne Deupree, who died in 1983, 
had been able and willing to support his daughter in her search. Her adoptive 
mother found every part of her daughter's efforts toward her parents 
emotionally painful. 
</P>
<P>
Now that she knows who she is and where she came from, Williams' life has some 
of the trappings of celebrity that her father knew. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after they met, Adkinson had the idea that Williams should consider a 
singing career and saw to it that she was introduced to country music producers 
in Nashville. Owen Bradley, who produced Patsy Cline and other country stars, 
listened to her sing and felt she had potential. 
</P>
<P>
Williams received voice coaching and took steps toward her own singing career. 
Members of her father's original backing band, "The Drifting Cowboys," play for 
her whenever she performs, which she does with increasing frequency at state 
fairs, nightclubs and charity events. She says Hank Williams fans seem 
fascinated to see what she calls "the little more of him" that she represents. 
</P>
<P>
The Adkinsons live on a restored house boat, "The Jett Stream," moored on the 
Potomac in sight of the Washington Monument. Although her legal battles have 
yet to bear financial fruit, she hopes she is on her way to becoming Jett 
Williams, country star. 
</P>
<P>
"They say my father was the king of country music, which makes my brother the 
prince, the crowned prince," says Williams. "But I'm Cinderella, not that I 
marry the prince but that my life is totally transformed into being the 
princess. 
</P>
<P>
"To be a celebrity in the United States is like being royalty. Fairyland is the 
word you're looking for. For me, at this point in my life, it's happening. I 
haven't gotten to that fairy land, totally, but it's happening." 
</P>
<P>
For Hank Williams' baby, it has been a long, lonesome, mixed-up road to get 
there.

INTO THE NIGHT: VIXEN INVADES CRAWFORD'S HAUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL HIGGINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Scene: Party for the release of the all-woman, hard rock/heavy metal group 
Vixen's second album, "Rev It Up," at what was Joan Crawford's Brentwood estate 
from 1929 to 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Who Was There: Among the 700 guests in the back yard (yes, it was that big) 
were a heavy-metal who's who that included members of Winger, Bad English, 
Stryper, Mr. Big, Kik Tracee, XYZ, Warrant, Ratt, Faster Pussycat and The Cult. 
Also on hand were Capitol/EMI CEO Joe Smith, EMI president Sal Licata and 
hundreds of the backbone of rock 'n' roll types -- road managers, sound 
technicians, stock clerks from Tower Records. 
</P>
<P>
The Buzz: The next person who does the "no more wire hangers" routine from 
"Mommie Dearest" wears one home. 
</P>
<P>
Chow: Charcoal grills were set on the back lawn for cooking chicken, hamburgers 
and hot dogs. There were also a number of bars with a daunting selection of 
liquor. "When you've got an album called 'Rev It Up,' " said bass player Share 
Pedersen, "you've got to have lots of booze at the party." 
</P>
<P>
Sign of the Times: All four women in Vixen carry stun guns. 
</P>
<P>
Dress Mode: As one of the rare female hard-rock bands, Vixen members wear a 
variation on the standard black-leather rocker outfit. "We buy some things at 
Trashy Lingerie," said Pedersen. "I don't think the guys do that." 
</P>
<P>
Architectural Note: The bathtubs Crawford had removed because she regarded 
sitting in bath water unsanitary have been replaced. The present owners also 
had the mansion exorcised by a minister from the Healing Light Church. Fans can 
rest assured the ghost was not Crawford herself. The ghosts of a caretaker and 
a dog eluded the exorcist, however, and are still in the house, the owners 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Quoted: "If Ozzy Osbourne can wear eyeliner, women can play guitar," said 
Michael Des Barres. 
</P>
<P>
Glitches: For most of the evening, guests were restricted to using the one 
bathroom in the pool house. This was not the sort of crowd that looks kindly on 
long waits. 
</P>
<P>
Triumphs: Whoever came up with the idea of recycling Hollywood legend by 
linking Joan Crawford and a heavy-metal band has secured a place in the hype 
hall of fame.

   Warner Records is betting on Zvuki Mu, even though
its flashy lead singer, Peter Mamonov, insists on singing in
Russian. Columbia is going with Boris Grebenshikov, a rock 'n' roll
switch-hitter who can belt 'em out in both Russian and English.
   It's all part of a rush by major entertainment companies to
bring out albums by Soviet rock musicians.
   The companies hope the curiosity of Americans about contemporary
Russia will sell records. They say the Gorbachev era has made
Soviet culture a hot product.
   But record executives have widely varying views of how authentic
a sound the public will pay to hear. Some are deliberately
Westernizing the music, prompting critics to say Americans are
missing the real soundtrack of glasnost.
   At one end of the spectrum is Grebenshikov's solo album ``Radio
Silence,'' which Columbia Records plans to release in June. Ten of
the 12 songs are in English and were written especially for the
album. All were recorded in the West by a successful British
producer, David Stewart of the rock group the Eurythmics.
   It has poetic, dreamy lyrics that are not overtly political or
even distinctively Russian in content. Aside from the raspy voice
of the chain-smoking, pony-tailed Grebenshikov, ``Radio Silence''
bears little resemblance to his wildly popular Leningrad band
Akvarium (Aquarium), which has sold 3.5 million official albums and
countless underground tapes in the Soviet Union.
   Jack Rovner, Columbia vice president for marketing, said
Grebenshikov himself decided to do the album in English because,
otherwise, the music's appeal ``obviously would have limitations.''
   Some record companies, however, are taking the plunge into
Russian lyrics.
   In late April, Opal-Warner Bros. released an album entirely in
Russian by Zvuki Mu, a Moscow band whose name means ``Sounds of
Mu'' _ a tongue-in-cheek tribute both to ``The Sound of Music'' and
to the mooing of cows.
   Like Columbia, Opal-Warner used a big-name Western producer,
Brian Eno. But the recording was made in a Moscow studio and
preserved Zvuki Mu's homegrown flavor, a blend of intellectual rock
and funk. The initial 50,000 records, cassettes and compact disks
have just reached the stores.
   Zvuki Mu is scheduled to bring its rambunctious stage act to New
York's Lincoln Center in July. Grebenshikov also is planning a U.S.
tour, probably in the fall.
   Of all the new releases, perhaps the most authentic is ``Gruppa
Krovi'' (Blood Type), a collection of Russian protest songs and
dance numbers by singer-poet Viktor Tsoi and his punk group Kino
(Cinema). The album was recorded in the apartment of one of the
band members.
   Joanna Stingray, an American singer married to Kino guitarist
Yuri Kasparyan, said she recently sat in a plush Leningrad
restaurant with a group of Soviet rock performers reminiscing
``about the old days when they literally went hungry.''
   Today, she said, top Soviet stars travel back and forth to the
West and earn tens of thousands of dollars from record contracts,
as well as commanding thousands of rubles per concert in the Soviet
Union.
   ``It used to be they couldn't afford a taxi ride home at
night,'' Stingray said. ``Now they are getting rich, at least by
Soviet standards.''
   Kino's four-track recording was released in April by Gold Castle
Records, a small Los Angeles label, but has the muscle of Capitol
Records' distribution network behind it.
   ``We wanted to make sure it was the real Russian stuff,'' said
Gold Castle promotion director Jeff Heiman. ``That seemed like the
hippest thing to do.''
   It is also the smallest release, at 10,000 copies, an example of
the trade-off between artistic integrity and commercial success
that worries Stingray and others on both sides of the rapidly
parting Iron Curtain.
   Artemy Troitsky, a Moscow rock impresario, has warned that the
newfound respectability of Soviet groups is fraught with peril, not
only because the government could crack down at any time, but also
because bands may be tempted to sell out.
   ``We've waited a long time for this, and it's a great day,''
Troitsky wrote in ``Back in the USSR,'' a history of Soviet rock
published last fall. ``But previously, musicians exercised their
creativity under the slogan `We've Got Nothing To Lose,' and thus
didn't think much about altering their work to ... win official
prestige.
   ``Now, whether they recognize it consciously or not, the new
conditions push them toward compromise.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: The Fleetwood Mac of Country Music</HEAD>

   Highway 101, the hottest vocal band in
country music, took its name after roads in California and Minnesota
and its style from the pop group Fleetwood Mac.
   The four-piece band, voted group of the year in 1988 and 1989 by
the Academy of Country Music, formed in California in the mid-1980s
with the idea of becoming the Fleetwood Mac of country music.
   Highway 101 hasn't sold 15 million albums like Fleetwood Mac's
``Rumours,'' but the energy of its music and the vocals of Paulette
Carlson have drawn comparisons to Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks and
Christine McVie.
   In a rapid rise to the top in country music, Highway 101 has
turned out three No. 1 records: ``Do You Love Me Just Say Yes'' last
September; ``Cry, Cry, Cry'' in 1988; and ``Somewhere Tonight'' in
1987.
   Four other singles made the Top 10 of the country charts. The
band's two albums, ``Highway 101'' and ``Highway 101 2,'' also did
well. They performed 140 concerts last year, doing shows with
country stars such as Hank Williams Jr., the Judds and Reba McEntire.
   ``I think it was the right time for a band situation like this,''
said Highway 101 guitarist Jack Daniels. ``We have kind of a style,
an approach, that's carefree and dynamic as opposed to playing it
safe and smooth and slick.''
   Said lead guitarist Curtis Stone, ``It was definitely a musical
adventure we all participated in.''
   Scott ``Cactus'' Moser, the band's drummer, rounds out the four.
The men are all from the Los Angeles area and Carlson is from
Minnesota, calling both tiny Winsted and equally small Moose Lake
her home.
   Borrowing from roads in their home states, the four decided to
call themselves Highway 101.
   ``It was the link between the guys on the West Coast and Paulette
in Minnesota,'' said Daniels. ``But in our travels, we've seen
several others in the country. It's sort of a network.''
   All four members had solid professional experience before forming
Highway 101. Moser had played drums for Johnny Rivers, Jennifer
Warnes and others. Daniels hit the road at age 17 with country
performer Freddie Hart. Carlson had recording experience as a solo
singer. Stone, the son of a song publisher, had written songs for
Crystal Gayle, Juice Newton and others.
   ``We had put in time in various other bands,'' Stone said. ``I
think we paid our dues individually.''
   Just as the band was getting together, Moser and Stone even
appeared briefly in the movie ``Back to School'' with Rodney
Dangerfield and did the soundtrack to the film.
   ``I sang the first verse to `Twist and Shout' and Cactus played
the drums,'' Stone said. ``Rodney took the mike away from me and
that was about it.''
   Their configuration is unique among country music recording
artists: a woman lead singer who also plays guitar with three
accompanying musicians who share vocal responsibilities.
   ``It's helped,'' Stone said of the arrangement. ``We're the first
band that did it; we're the first that had a female singer.''
   Said Daniels, ``We are all musicians and all singers. It's
nebulous why it all works. If anyone knew the answer, everyone would
be lining up doing it.
   ``We did a few things experimentally to find our groove, our
niche. It wasn't necessarily what would sell to the public. It was
what do we do best together. It took us a little bit to discover
that. Once we did, we felt good with it and fortunately, people
liked that.
   ``When we first came out, other musicians said we were playing
raw energy. I think that sometimes music gets homogenized in the
recording process. To be clean and safe, it loses its humanism. Our
records were more live sounding.''
   Stone agrees.
   ``There's a lot of spontaneous things that happen in our music
that you don't hear a lot on record (elsewhere).''
   There's a good-natured tiff among the group about numbering their
albums. The guys think it's clever but Carlson doesn't.
   ``We went with `Highway 101 2' and got a lot of flak from
Paulette,'' Stone said. ``But we thought it was pretty cute because
it could be Highway 101 2, Highway 101 squared, Highway 101 to the
second power, whatever you want to say. But she's adamant about
fighting it.''

POP BEAT: GUNS N' ROSES SHOWS SOME METTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Axl made the gig. Clapton joined the Stones. "Angie" entered the repertoire. 
Living Colour jumped into the Great Guns N' Roses bigotry debate. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the main twists on Thursday, the second night of the Rolling 
Stones-Guns N' Roses-Living Colour four-show stand at the Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The question on most people's minds going in wasn't what color Mick Jagger's 
jacket would be, but whether Guns N' Roses would play at all, after singer Axl 
Rose's declaration during the previous night's show that he was through with 
the band because of some members' excessive drug use. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, when GNR hit the stage on Thursday, Rose wasn't up there with the 
four musicians. What was up? Was the group trying to carry on without its 
charismatic leader? Before the music even started, lead guitarist Slash asked 
for the crowd's attention and launched into an extended discourse on the perils 
of drugs, admitting the group's transgressions but concluding, "Guns N' Roses 
is not gonna be a band that falls apart because of it." 
</P>
<P>
With that, Rose strode from the rear of the stage into the spotlight, to be 
greeted by a welcoming roar from the approximately 72,000 people on hand. After 
thanking Slash -- who was wearing a Betty Ford Clinic T-shirt -- for his 
statement, Rose the singer said, "I'd like to apologize for my actions and 
comments last night. I just didn't want to see my friends slip away." 
</P>
<P>
In the fiery set that followed, Rose and company were on their best behavior. 
He didn't fall off the stage, as he did Wednesday; he didn't dig himself deeper 
into racial controversy, as he did Wednesday, and he even thanked the Rolling 
Stones for having them on the show. 
</P>
<P>
You've got to hand it to a band that not only throws its tantrums in front of 
the multitudes, but turns them into high psychodrama and squeezes every 
possible drop of ink from them. (A source close to the band strenuously denied 
that the "breakup" was a publicity ploy. "There has been real tension in the 
band," the source said Friday. "The only thing that surprised me was that Axl 
went public with it. It might have been the pressure of the big engagement.") 
</P>
<P>
The Stones wrote the book on that kind of thing in their early days, but now 
that they're an entertainment institution, no such scenarios are likely to be 
played out in their well-oiled "Steel Wheels" show. If you wanted spontaneity 
Thursday, you had to be thankful for small favors, like a brief microphone 
failure at the start of "Mixed Emotions" that proved that all the players up 
there were awake. 
</P>
<P>
Things were a millimeter looser Thursday, as Jagger did more bouncing off the 
other musicians, at one point wrapping the stoic bassist Bill Wyman in a 
makeshift wrestling hold. Set-list archivists note: "Angie" replaced "Play With 
Fire" in the show's slow-song segment, and Keith Richards inserted "Before They 
Make Me Run" before "Happy" in his spotlight turn. 
</P>
<P>
The clear highlight for the audience came during the opening bars of Willie 
Dixon's "Little Red Rooster," the slide-guitar slow blues they recorded in 
1964. The video screens above the stage suddenly showed a close-up of 
un-introduced guest guitarist and fellow graybeard Eric Clapton, eliciting a 
mighty roar of recognition from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The Thursday concert began with another installment in the Issue That Won't Go 
Away: Guns N' Roses alleged bigotry. The band has been under serious fire for 
the racial and sexual epithets in the song "One in a Million," which they 
haven't been performing at the Coliseum. At the start of Wednesday's show, Rose 
tried to justify their use as social realism and deny that he is a racist, but 
once again revealed a profound obliviousness to the inflammatory nature of the 
language. Rose's Thursday apology didn't appear to cover those comments. 
</P>
<P>
Living Colour, the black, New York-based hard-rock band that has been at the 
forefront of attacking racism in rock, didn't have anything to say on the 
matter Wednesday, but on Thursday guitarist Vernon Reid stepped to his 
microphone and said, "It's been cool on this tour opening for the Stones, but 
some things were said on this stage last night that I have a problem with. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have a problem with gay people, don't call them (epithet). If you 
don't have a problem with black people, don't call them (epithet). I haven't 
met a (epithet) in my life." 
</P>
<P>
The Stones and their supporting sideshow play the Coliseum today and Sunday at 
5 p.m. The headliners sing "It's only rock 'n' roll," but it's obviously more 
than that. 
</P>
<P>
LIVE ACTION: Expose and Young M.C. are set for the Universal Amphitheatre on 
Nov. 10. Tickets on sale Sunday. . . . Also on sale Sunday for the Universal 
are Squeeze (Dec. 11), Joan Baez (Dec. 16) and second nights for both the 
Eurythmics (Nov. 22) and Jethro Tull (Dec. 6). . . . The reunited Buzzcocks 
will be at the Santa Monica Civic on Nov. 25. On sale Sunday. . . . L.A. Guns 
heads a bill at the Hollywood Palladium on Nov. 24.

MTV'S UNNATURAL MUSEUM MAY GET POTATOES OFF COUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Faithful viewers of MTV, it's time once again to temporarily cease and desist 
from being a lethargic couch potato and get in on some of the on-screen action 
yourself. 
</P>
<P>
For the second year in a row, the North County Fair shopping center in 
Escondido will this week host MTV's Museum of UnNatural History, a traveling 
road show of pop music, culture, fashion and technology. 
</P>
<P>
Step inside the 3,000-square-foot museum, set up Thursday through Sunday in the 
mall's central walkway, and you'll get a firsthand look at the MTV life style 
through more than 20 displays, grouped in four areas: 
</P>
<P>
* In the "New Music" section, a wall of 16 television monitors, stacked into a 
square, will broadcast the latest music videos from established artists as well 
as promising upstarts. Visitors will also get the chance to make their own 
videos, using MTV cameras, stages and props. 
</P>
<P>
* The "Long Live Rock" exhibit will display rock 'n' roll memorabilia on loan 
from the Hard Rock Cafe collection. There will be gold records, rare 
photographs, autographs, clothes and guitars from such pop heroes as Keith 
Richards, Bon Jovi, George Michael, Joan Jett, the Fat Boys and the Traveling 
Wilburys (Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne and the late Roy Orbison). 
</P>
<P>
New this year is a painting of what, from up close, looks like an aquarium full 
of fish. But stand back and what suddenly emerges is the face of the late Jim 
Morrison. MTV commissioned artist Doug Auld to paint the portrait. Auld will be 
on hand to sign autographs all four days the museum is in town. 
</P>
<P>
* The "Addicted to Style" section celebrates the latest pop fashion and beauty 
trends. The highlight promises to be the campy 3-D "Gone Fishing" display, a 
series of moving scenes that will show you the right look for leisure-time 
pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
* The "Products for Better Living" area will showcase the latest in pop 
technology through a variety of commercially sponsored displays. Among them are 
Sunkist Soft Drinks' "Make Your Own Surf Video" booth, which will give museum 
visitors the chance to be videotaped aboard a simulated surfboard; a 
nickelodeon with continuous showings of Hershey's animated Twizzlers licorice 
promotional clip; and Designamics' exhibit of innovative inventions that have 
yet to catch on, like the amphibious car. 
</P>
<P>
The star attraction: "Robo Doc's Body Shop," will take a futuristic look at 
automobile-repair garages, complete with a greasy-fingered robot mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
On last year's inaugural tour of shopping centers throughout the country, MTV's 
Museum of UnNatural History was visited by more than 5 million people, and host 
malls reported traffic increases of 5% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
This year's 28-week, 24-city cross-country swing began in March in Durham, 
N.C., and concludes next month in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, almost to the day, Blue Oyster Cult headlined a sold-out show at 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium attended by more than 50,000 screaming fans. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently most of those screams have long since been silenced. When the 
pioneering New York heavy metal band returns to San Diego this week, it will be 
for a two-night stand, Thursday and Friday, at the 500-seat Bacchanal in Kearny 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
The rise and fall of Blue Oyster Cult, described by the Rolling Stone 
Encyclopedia of Rock 'n' Roll as "semi-satiric exponents of the high-decibel 
apocalypse," is a testament to the inherent fickleness of pop-music audiences. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, Blue Oyster Cult helped usher in the first wave of heavy 
metal with such savage head-banging anthems as "Tyranny and Mutation," "Cities 
on Flame" and "Hot Rails to Hell." 
</P>
<P>
In 1975, the live "On Your Feet or On Your Knees" LP became the group's first 
gold album, and a year later, after adopting a less explosive, more mainstream 
pop sound, they scored their first Top 40 single with "(Don't Fear) The 
Reaper." 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the 1970s and early '80s, Blue Oyster Cult continued to do quite 
well, both on the charts and on the concert trail. 
</P>
<P>
But, in recent years, the group's place in the hearts of heavy metal fans has 
been taken over by newer, younger bands like Bon Jovi, Guns 'n' Roses and Great 
White. Blue Oyster Cult's last hit album was 1982's "Extraterrestrial Live," 
and their last Top 40 single was 1981's "Burnin' For You." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other first-generation heavy metal bands like Led Zeppelin and Grand 
Funk Railroad, however, Blue Oyster Cult has steadfastly refused to give up. 
</P>
<P>
And, from the sounds of their last couple of albums, they're still able to 
raise as much commotion as their younger, more commercially successful 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: San Diego techno-pop duo Red Flag, whose debut album, "Naive Art," 
has just been released on the Enigma Records label, will co-headline the 
upcoming Ocean Aid concert with veteran new wave zanies Devo. The two-day 
concert, on Sept. 3 and 4 at the Irvine Bowl in Laguna Beach, is a benefit for 
the Ocean Aid Foundation, a nonprofit trust that distributes funds to 
environmental groups concerned with protecting the ocean. . . . Tickets go on 
sale Saturday at 10 a.m. for the Doobie Brothers' Oct. 1 concert at the 
Starlight Bowl in Balboa Park, and for The Cure's Sept. 12 show at the Sports 
Arena. Tickets go on sale Saturday at noon for The Judds' Oct. 1 show at San 
Diego State University's Open Air Theater, and Monday at 10 a.m. for Michael W. 
Smith's Nov. 5 show at the Starlight Bowl.. . . Foghat will appear at the 
Bacchanal Sept. 8, and not at Diego's El Cajon two days later, as reported last 
week. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: the Bullet Boys, Spider Blue and Bang 
Tango, Thursday at Iguana's in Tijuana; Jimmy Cliff, also Thursday, at the 
Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach; Joe Jackson, Saturday at the Open Air Theater; 
Jackson Browne, Sunday at the Open Air Theater; Al Green, also Sunday, at 
Humphrey's on Shelter Island, and the U.K. Subs, Aug. 28 at the Spirit in Bay

   Southern rockers Alabama got the artist
of the decade award from the Academy of Country Music, but it was
1989's top entertainer Hank Williams Jr. who provided the show's
wallop.
   Williams was one of three double winners, taking his third
consecutive entertainer of the year trophy and second video award
during Monday night's 24th-annual presentations.
   K.T. Oslin won album of the year and best female vocalist and
Kathy Mattea's ``Eighteen Wheels and a Dozen Roses'' won for record
and song.
   Randy Travis was shut out despite three nominations.
   It appeared to be Alabama's night as the band joined Marty
Robbins and Loretta Lynn in the artist of the decade ranks.
   But Williams, the wild-eyed Tennessean whose rowdiness has been
embraced by country music in recent years, brought a tear to many
of the 1,600 people present when he accepted his trophy.
   ``I'm a late bloomer, a survivor, a fighter, a contender,''
Williams said. ``I can be a champion, but I'm nothing without all
of you in this room and all the fans out there.''
   Williams then referred to his current hit record and video, the
father-son duet ``Tear in My Beer,'' which uses a tape his late
father made decades ago.
   ``The video with Daddy was the most special thing I ever did in
my life,'' Williams said, choking back tears and biting his lip.
   Backstage, he conceded it was as emotional for him as the
audience.
   ``When I started talking about that video I had to get off that
stage because the man of steel just about lost it,'' he said.
   The presentations broadcast on NBC-TV also brought a videotaped
salute from President Bush, who said ``howdy'' and told the artists
he had a ``deep appreciation for country and western music, and the
values you represent.''
   The big surprise was Travis' leaving empty handed. He's won
eight ACM trophies since 1986 and this year has won American Music
Awards and a Grammy Award.
   The crowd inside Walt Disney Studios gave a standing ovation to
Alabama members Randy Owen, Jeff Cook, Teddy Gentry and Mark
Herndon.
   ``I'd like to accept this award for all those artists that have
deserved awards but never won awards,'' said Owen.
   Alabama has won 13 Country Music Awards since 1982. It has had
21 consecutive No. 1 singles, including ``Feels So Right,'' ``The
Closer You Get,'' ``Roll On'' and ``You've Got the Touch.''
   Cowpoke balladeer Robbins prevailed in the 1960s and coal
miner's daughter Miss Lynn was crowned the decade's best in the
1970s.
   Miss Oslin, the robust queen of down-home music known for her
irreverence, thanked ``the fans, the radio that played me and me.''
   Strait won his third male vocalist trophy, the last time in 1986
when he also won album of the year.
   ``This means a lot to me. My little boy has been asking me,
`Dad, when are you going to win another award?' Well, we got one
tonight Bubba,'' Strait said, referring to 7-year-old George Jr.
   Los Angeles-based Highway 101 beat out Alabama, the Desert Rose
Band, the Oak Ridge Boys and Restless Heart to take their second
consecutive vocal group trophy.
   The Judds, Naomi and her daughter Wynona, took their fifth
consecutive duet award.
   Suzy Bogguss was named top new female vocalist and Rodney
Crowell, whose wife is country singer Rosanne Cash, was named the
top new male vocalist.
   Buck Owens, the academy's top male vocalist in 1966, was
presented the non-competitive Pioneer Award for outstanding
achievement.
   In awards announced earlier, the Desert Rose Band won the
academy's top touring band trophy.
   Winners in the instrumental categories were Curtis Stone, bass;
Steve Duncan, drums; Mark O'Connor, fiddle; Al Bruno, guitar; John
Hobbs, keyboard; Charlie McCoy, specialty instrument (harmonica);
Jay Dee Maness, steel guitar; and Nashville Now, non-touring band.
   Nashville radio station WSIX was voted the nation's best in
country music and southern California's Crazy Horse Steak House &amp;
Saloon was named top nightclub.
   There was a tie for disc jockey of the year between Jon Conlon
of WGKX in Memphis, Tenn., and Dandalion of WRKZ in Hershey, Pa.
Dandalion is the first woman to win the honor.
   The winners were decided in a vote by the 2,000-member academy.

   The government is preparing to ban almost all
uses of asbestos, ending a decade-long debate over the health risk
posed by the cancer-causing substance in such items as brake linings
and water pipes, according to sources.
   The regulatory action, which will end the manufacture of most
asbestos products in three phases over the next seven years, was
expected to be announced by the Environmental Protection Agency
today.
   According to government and private sources who spoke on
condition they not be identified, the agency action will allow
asbestos to be a component in only a small number of items,
prohibiting its use over the next seven years in an estimated 94
percent of the products in which it currently can be found.
   Among those products are automobile brake pads and linings,
cement water distribution pipes, roofing shingles, floor and pipe
wrapping and other construction products.

   Longtime leader Janos Kadar, who rose to
power after the Soviets crushed the 1956 revolt and steered Hungary
through relative prosperity until hard times and liberals forced him
out, died today at age 77.
   The Communist who led Hungary for 32 years until last year _ but
ultimately came to symbolize stagnation and resistance to democratic
change _ died after a ``prolonged and grave illness,'' the state-run
MTI news agency said.
   Kadar was rushed to the hospital Monday with pneumonia and severe
breathing and circulatory problems.
   MTI said the ruling Communist Party ``informs the party
membership, and the entire Hungarian people, with profound sorrow
that comrade Janos Kadar died following a prolonged, grave illness
on Thursday July 6 at 9:16 a.m.''

   An outbreak of rapidly fatal bacterial infections
in at least four western states could mark the return of dangerous
strains of strep germs that mysteriously disappeared almost 50 years
ago, researchers reported today.
   The newly recognized illness, which doctors call streptococcal
toxic shock syndrome, can lead from a minor skin infection to death
in a day or two.
   Strep germs are common but usually result in relatively minor
illnesses, such as sore throats. More virulent forms of the microbes
were once frequent causes of life-threatening illnesses, including
scarlet fever and rheumatic fever. But for reasons unclear, the
dangerous strains of strep largely faded away in the early 1940s.
   In today's New England Journal of Medicine, doctors describe 20
cases of severe illness, including six deaths, that were seen
between 1986 and 1988 in Idaho, Montana, Utah and Nevada. They
believe the illness was caused by strep bacteria that produce
scarlatina toxin, the poison responsible for scarlet fever.

   Neptune's poles may be encircled by broad
bands of dark clouds blown by jet streams like those on Earth and
Jupiter, say scientists studying a new photograph from the Voyager 2
space probe.
   Two dark bands, each about 2,700 miles wide, are clearly visible
forming a collar around Neptune's south pole. The photograph also
shows hints of similar banding around the north pole, said Edward
Stone, Voyager project scientist for NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They are probably regions of clouds associated with high-speed
jet streams,'' said Stone, a physicist and vice president at the
California Institute of Technology.
   The planet's southern hemisphere bands stretch from 50 degrees
south latitude to 70 degrees south latitude, said Candice Hansen, a
planetary scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

<TEXT>     This neglected classic has been fully restored to its full color majesty
through a joint effort by the UCLA Film Archives and AMC. The restored version
premieres on AMC, but also will tour theaters this winter as part of the
United Service Organizations' 50th anniversary celebration.;   All proceeds
from the film version of Irving Berlin's 1942 musical stage smash were donated
to Army Emergency Relief. Director Michael ("Casablanca") Curtiz put an
all-star cast, including Ronald Reagan, Joan Leslie and George Murphy, through
a super-patriotic series of songs and sketches. Highlights: Berlin himself
singing "Oh, How I Hate to Get Up in the Morning," Kate Smith's moving "God
Bless America" and the show's rousing hit song, "This Is the Army, Mr.
Jones.";   (check) "The Sky's the Limit" (1943), Tuesday at 6 p.m.;   Fred
Astaire's an air hero trying to enjoy a quiet leave, but photographer Joan
Leslie thinks he's a shirker. Highlight: Astaire's dazzling dance solo,
trashing all the glassware in a saloon while supposedly inebriated, to the
Harold Arlen/Johnny Mercer classic "One for My Baby.";   (check) "Four Jills
in a Jeep" (1944), Wednesday at 6 p.m.;   In 1942-43, stars Kay Francis,
Carole Landis, Martha Raye and Mitzi Mayfair toured for the USO and in 1944
they played themselves in a fictionalized version of the same tour. Highlight:
The re-creation of Landis' real-life marriage to a GI.;   (check) "Stage Door
Canteen" (1943), Thursday at 6 p.m.;   Written by Stanford grad Delmer Daves,
who also wrote and directed the 1944 "Hollywood Canteen," this huge all-star
musical celebrated the American Theatre Wing's wartime hangout for servicemen.
Among those on hand: Katharine Hepburn, Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Ray
Bolger, Helen Hayes, Ethel Merman, Gypsy Rose Lee and the bands of Count
Basie, Xavier Cugat, Benny Goodman, Kay Kyser, Guy Lombardo and Freddy Martin.
Highlights: Too many to list.;   (check) "The Fleet's In" (1942), Friday at 6
and 11:30 p.m.;   Maybe the best of the breed of World War II musicals:
William Holden is a handsome sailor, pushed by pal Eddie Bracken into trying
to date, on the night before shipping out, the beautiful but icy San Francisco
club singer known as the Countess of Swingland, played with gusto by Dorothy
Lamour. Great numbers, from the rousing title tune by Betty Jane Rhodes to
Lamour's immortal "I Remember You," sung in close harmony with Helen
O'Connell, to the classic "Tangerine" from O'Connell, Bob Eberly and the Jimmy
Dorsey band. With incredible specialty numbers by Betty Hutton, in her film
debut, Cass Daley and Lorraine and Rognan, an eccentric dance team you won't
believe even after you've seen them. (box)  </TEXT>

Valley pioneers William Hewlett and David Packard, all tossed into an

says Stephen Peeps, associate vice president for public affairs and director
of Stanford University's centennial celebration.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Stanford Centennial Stadium Spectacular, the culmination of a year full
of lesser centennial events at the university, storms Stanford's football
stadium at 8 p.m. Monday -- the last night, Peeps says, of Stanford's first
century.;   "It is, in effect, our new century's eve," he says.;   To help
celebrate, the university has enlisted a line-up that's more than eclectic.
It's downright eccentric.;   Besides Goldberg, Koppel, Feinstein, Hewlett and
Packard, the line-up includes performances by rock 'n' rollers the Doobie
Brothers, singer Bobby McFerrin, folk musician Joan Baez, flutist James
Galway, gospel singer Edwin Hawkins and the jazz fusion group Hiroshima.;  
Also on hand will be such "Stanford personalities" as former Stanford football
coaches Bill Walsh and John Ralston, Olympic decathlon champion Bob Mathias,
Olympic skating champion Debi Thomas and astronauts and Stanford alumnae
Tamara Jernigan and Mae Jemison.;   What do all of these people have in
common?;   "Most of them have either a tie with Stanford or the Bay Area,"
says Peeps. "We wanted very much to enlist entertainers that crossed cultures
and generations, and that have something to do with the Bay Area.";   Everyone
who takes the stage Monday night will have some part in the 100-minute,
four-act extravaganza. Goldberg, for example, is rumored to have been cast as
the formidable Jane Lathrop Stanford, wife of Sen. Leland Stanford and mother
of Leland Jr., for whom the university is named.;   The show takes place on
five stages and tells the history of Stanford's first hundred years using
fireworks, 70-foot-high video projection screens and a cast and crew of more
than 500. The script was written by Stanford alumnus Harry Muheim, class of
'41.;   Barnett Lipton, whose New York-based events company produced
ceremonies for the 1990 Goodwill Games in Seattle and the fizzy celebration of
Coca Cola's centennial in Atlanta, is now behind the pyrotechnics and
big-screen heroics of the Stanford story. His master of ceremonies is the
usually unflappable Koppel, who has a master's degree from the university.;  
"This show has never been performed before and never will be performed again,"
says Peeps. "It is a genuine one-shot opportunity.";   The university expects
tens of thousands of tickets to be sold. But because the show's in the
stadium, tens of thousands of seats will be available right up until show
time, even though the university is using only half of the stadium because the
stages will be visible from only one side.;   General-admission tickets are
$25. Tickets for Stanford students, faculty and staff, and anyone 18 and
under, are $15. And, in an effort to perk up ticket sales, the university
announced recently that anyone with a ticket stub from Saturday's football
game against the University of Colorado will get $5 off the $25 tickets.
They're on sale at the Stanford Athletic Department and through
BASS/Ticketmaster outlets. Call (408) 998-2277 or (415) 762-2277.;   While the
Stadium Spectacular is open to everyone, Stanford ties or not, the real
community party will probably take place Sunday night. That's when the
Downtown Palo Alto Centennial Celebration takes place, free of charge.;   The
Palo Alto celebration starts with a parade from the top of the Stanford Oval
(at Roth Way and Palm Drive on the Stanford campus) down the city's main
street, University Avenue. Seventy-five marching units are signed up to make
the trek, including 10 marching bands, Stanford yell leaders from the 1930s
and Jane and Leland Stanford's carriage, carrying winners of the Jane and
Leland look-alike contest.;   Members of the community are invited to march in
the parade as well, in one of five open units.;   Children under 12 can march
with the Stanford Hopefuls or in the Children With Pets Category. Older
marchers, or rollers, can join up with the Wheels category, the Bicycles
category or the Historical Costumes category. Meet at the parade information
booth at the corner of Roth and Lomita ways on the campus by 5 p.m.;   The
parade begins at 5:30 p.m.;   Before and after the parade, musicians will
entertain on four stages in downtown Palo Alto. They include rock 'n' rollers
the Hit Men and Jerry &amp; the Jets, bluesman Michael Osborne and his band and
artists from Palo Alto-based Windham Hill Records.;   The music continues in
and around University Avenue until 8 p.m.  </TEXT>

   Rowdy country singer Hank Williams
Jr. and his late father shared top Academy of Country Music Award
nominations Tuesday with the 40-year-old weepy saloon duet
``There's a Tear in My Beer.''
   Williams got six nominations, including entertainer of the year,
and the Grammy-winning song collaboration led to five nominations
for his father.
   ``The ones for daddy are particularly important. I want to see
daddy shine after these 37 years,'' Williams said from Paris, Tenn.
   ``I just wish daddy could be there to enjoy it all,'' he added.
``But I feel deep in my heart that daddy's watching somewhere.''
   Clint Black also got six nominations, including best album and
song for ``Killin' Time,'' and five went to Grammy-winning singer
Rodney Crowell for ``After All This Time.''
   Crowell joins Hank Williams Jr., Randy Travis, George Strait,
Dolly Parton and Alabama in the top entertainer category.
   Multiple nominees for ``Hat'' trophies included Alabama, Travis
and Miss Parton with three apiece. Strait, Kathy Mattea, Reba
McEntire, Garth Brooks and the group Shenandoah each had two.
   The 25th edition of the academy's two-hour awards show take
place April 25 in Hollywood and will be televised by NBC-TV.
   Nominations in 12 categories were announced by members of the
band Highway 101, nominated for top vocal group, and Buck Owens,
nominated for the duet ``Act Naturally'' with Ringo Starr.
   ``I feel great. How else could a person feel? It's a sunny day,
we find out we're nominated, it's wonderful,'' said Paulette
Carlson of Highway 101.
   In addition to the top entertainer nomination, Williams was
picked for the duet with his late father ``There's a Tear in My
Beer,'' which also was nominated for top song, record and video.
   Trophies are given to the artist and composer in the song
category and the artist and producer in the record, video and album
categories.
   ``There's a Tear in my Beer'' was on a Hank Williams Sr. demo
tape found in the attic of songwriter ``Big Bill'' Lister. The
elder Williams died in 1953, but modern technology allowed the
addition of his son to the song and video.
   Several nominees won big during last week's Grammy Awards show:
``There's a Tear in My Beer'' was best country vocal collaboration,
Crowell's ``After All This Time'' was country song and k.d. lang
was female country singer for ``Absolute Torch and Twang.''

   Chris Hillman considers the Desert Rose Band the
best band in which he has ever been.
   In fact, he'd just as soon not even talk about the others,
including the most famous one, the Byrds _ which he and Roger
McGuinn founded just 25 years ago _ and the Flying Burrito Brothers.
   Country music fans like the Desert Rose Band, too. They've made
five straight singles go No. 1 on the best-selling country chart.
And ``Hello Trouble'' is climbing toward the top.
   The band also is nominated as vocal group of the year in the
upcoming Country Music Association awards, for song of the year for
``I Still Believe in You'' and for the Horizon Award, the
association's highest honor.
   Hillman and McGuinn are nominated for country event of the year,
for a performance at Red Rocks in Colorado. Their duet, ``You Ain't
Going Nowhere,'' also is on the current country singles chart.
   ``This band feels the best,'' Hillman says. ``The others never
felt right. The Byrds felt OK. It was such a diverse group of
individuals it self-destructed. This feels like the chemistry is
right.
   ``The six of us are trying to think alike, trying to focus
everybody's vision into one vision.
   ``This has got the best players and singers. It has proven itself
with the chart singles. We're right on the track. A man would be a
fool to wreck this train _ give me a pen, I've got a song title.''
   Guitarist John Jorgenson says, ``In Nashville, everyone is a
songwriter. Every third or fourth line of conversation, somebody
says, `That would be a good song.'''
   In January, Hillman, McGuinn and David Crosby performed as the
Byrds in Los Angeles, trying to trademark the name, countering an
attempt by the group's original drummer, Michael Clarke, to use it.
   ``They talk about re-forming the Byrds,'' Hillman says. ``I don't
think that is going to happen. The Byrds would be wonderful to do if
it didn't interfere with the Desert Rose Band.
   ``I love the other guys but I don't want to look over my
shoulder. This is something that's challenging right now. It takes
enough of my time just to keep abreast of the business and try and
come up with something unique each time we jump into the studio.''
   After the Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Stephen Stills'
Manassas, Souther-Hillman-Furay, McGuinn Clark &amp; Hillman and time
out for spiritual stocktaking, Hillman cut two solo country albums
for Sugar Hill Records: ``Morning Sky'' and ``Desert Rose.''
   In his teens in San Diego County, he played in country bands
before he and McGuinn created folk-rock with the Byrds and he and
Gram Parsons pushed on into country-rock with the Burritos.
   ``You don't have to be from Kentucky to hear country music,''
Hillman says. ``In the '30s people came to California from
Appalachia, the Midwest and Texas because of the Dust Bowl. In World
War II, came the aircraft industry and then the housing boom which
attracted people from the Southeast, South and Midwest. They brought
their music with them _ hence the real country music style from
California.''
   In 1985, Hillman formed a quartet to open shows for Dan
Fogelberg. He named it the Desert Rose Band when he later added two
more players, making it an electric band with the ability to play
acoustic.
   ```Desert Rose' was one of my songs,'' Hillman says. ``It was a
nickname for somebody's child. I like the song. I've been toying
with the idea of recutting it with this bunch. These guys can play
and sing it better.''
   During a January 1986 booking at the Palomino in North Hollywood,
a Curb Records executive heard the band and later signed it. The
second LP on Curb, ``Running,'' came out last November. Curb is
distributed by MCA.
   Guitarist John Jorgenson, who was interviewed with Hillman in
MCA's office, says that the band early on performed songs from
Hillman's ``Desert Rose'' album.
   Hillman wrote most of the songs on ``Running,'' collaborating
with Steve Hill, a friend from Ventura, Calif. ``I write. We work it
out, see how she flies,'' he said.
   ``Hopefully it retains the personality of the band,'' Jorgenson
said. ``You've got the same six guys playing it, putting their ideas
and feelings into it. On our latest single, we've been hearing that
people listening to it say, `That must be the Desert Rose Band.'''
   Other band members are guitarist Herb Pedersen, Jay Dee Maness on
pedal steel, bassist Bill Bryson and drummer Steve Duncan.
   The hit singles include ``One Step Forward'' and ``He's Back and
I'm Blue'' from the 1987 ``The Desert Rose Band,'' and ``Summer
Wind,'' ``I Still Believe in You,'' ``She Don't Love Nobody'' and
``Hello Trouble'' from ``Running.''
   The band, touring since March 1, took off June to finish
recording a third album for January release.

   Jamie Kalven spent a decade shaping a book out of
1,000-page manuscript and a mountain of raw material _ the
unfinished life's work of his father, a legal scholar.
   Although Harry Kalven died with his task incomplete, he helped
his son see it through.
   The result is ``A Worthy Tradition,'' a 700-page act of filial
devotion, a scholarly essay on the First Amendment and how its
protections were broadened by the Supreme Court between World War I
and the early 1970s.
   ``Almost everything I know about my father's views of the Fiame after
his death,'' said Kalven, who is not a lawyer.
   The First Amendment, his father said, has been continually
enriched and elaboraterst
Amendment cd by the ongoing dialogue of society and
courts addressing the countless issues it embraces.
   Among the book's central themes is an argument that criticism of
the government or its officials _ seditious libel _ should never be
a crime.
   ``A Worthy Tradition'' was published this year by Harper &amp; Row
and sells for $35. The book bears the elder Kalven's name as author
with a notation that his son edited it.
   Harry Kalven was a noted legal scholar at the Universiteatle.
   McCartney played piano, sang harmony and was producer of the song
``T-shirt'' on the Nashville band's current album of the same name.
   ``They are probably the first rock 'n' roll band I remember,''
McCartney said in a promotional videotape for the Crickets. ``I've
always been a fan of theirs.''
   The McCartney-Crickets collaboration, done at McCartney's
recording studio in England, evolved from the Crickets' appearance
two years ago at McCartney's annual Buddy Holly Week celebration. At
that time, the ex-Beatle said he was interested in working with the
group.
   The album is the first in about 10 years for the Crickets, whose
name inspired McCartney and John Lennon to name their band after
another insect.
   ``It is basic rock 'n' roll with three pieces (instruments),''
says Cricket Jerry ``J.I.'' Allison, a drummer. ``It's basically
what we did back in the '50s.''
   Allison, Holly and Joe B. Mauldin, who is still a member, founded
the Crickets in Lubbock, Texas, in 1957. They were known for such
hits as ``Peggy Sue,'' ``That'll Be the Day'' and ``Maybe Baby.''
   Holly died on Feb. 3, 1959, with Ritchie Valens and J.P. ``Big
Bopper'' Richardson when a tour plane they were flying in crashed in
a Iowa cornfield. The pilot also perished.
   Holly's life was the subject of the 1979 movie, ``The Buddy Holly
Story'' starring Gary Busey. Valens' life was recounted in the
recent motion picture ``La Bamba.'' Los Lobos did a version of the
traditional Mexican song Valens had made into a hit, ``La Bamba,''
and made it a No. 1 tune on the record charts in 1987.
   Allison and Mauldin were not with Holly when the plane crashed
because Holly had moved from Texas to New York City and was using
new members of his band.
   The two performed occasionally as Crickets in the 1960s, but did
not really get back together until 10 years ago. At that time, they
began performing as Crickets again as the opening act for country
music star Waylon Jennings, who had been accompanying Holly on the
concert tour when he was killed. In fact, Jennings gave up his seat
on the plane to the Big Bopper.
   The third current Cricket is Gordon Payne, lead vocalist and
guitarist, who joined in 1985.
   Payne admits he doesn't sound like Holly. ``I've tried, but I
don't,'' he said of the former bandleader's style.
   The band plays an equal amount of new and old material, though
the album is new songs. They close their concerts with ``That'll Be
the Day.''
   ``It was our first song and got us started and out of Texas,''
Allison recalled. ``It seems to be the most familiar one to all the
people.''
   In the past year, the three have performed throughout the United
States and Europe and in Australia and Canada. A tour of Japan is in
the works for 1989.
   Allison said the Crickets played in garages in Lubbock in the
1950s, but did not take their name from a cricket they heard
chirping as portrayed in the movie about Holly. Instead, they were
inspired by another band called the Spiders.
   ``We thought insects were a neat name. We got a list from
somewhere and decided to pick another insect,'' Allison said.
   He said Holly's legacy is that ``he showed that you don't have to
be a real `pretty boy' or that you don't have to have a lot of money
to entertain or have a rock 'n' roll band.
   ``It showed a lot of people that you could get up and write some
songs and play and not have a whole bunch of publicity behind you.
We sort of wrote the songs ourselves and produced them ourselves. He
wasn't your idol-looking kind of guy you'd see in Photoplay. He just
wanted to sing and play,'' he said.
   ``It was simple music, uncomplicated so anybody could pick it up.
I've heard that anybody could go get a guitar on Saturday night and
learn `That'll Be the Day' and those three-chord songs and have 'em
a little group. Before that, it seemed harder.''
   Said Payne: ``He sang with such feeling and intensity. Even Bruce
Springsteen says he listens to old Crickets' records to `keep it
honest.' He left behind a mold for other singers: what you're
supposed to try to do.''
   Mauldin, the Crickets' bass player, said he didn't try to
interfere with McCartney's work on their album. ``He asked for
suggestions. My answer was usually, `Whatever you think, Paul. '''
