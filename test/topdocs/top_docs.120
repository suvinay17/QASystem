   CHICAGO -- The Chicago Board of Trade said its members
voted to add St. Louis as a delivery point for soybeans and
wheat.
   The exchange's members had been widely expected to approve
the addition of St. Louis, which is already used as a
delivery location for corn. Like corn traders, traders of
wheat and soybeans can already fulfill their delivery
obligations in Chicago and Toledo, Ohio.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The move is subject to approval by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. If regulatory approval is given, the
first soft red winter wheat contract to include St. Louis
would probably be for delivery in July 1993. The first
soybean contact to include St. Louis would probably be for
delivery in November 1993, according to a CBOT spokesman.
   Traders of agricultural futures contracts usually don't
take physical delivery of the underlying commodity. Grain
exporting firms, for example, use futures contracts to
protect themselves from changes in the price of the crops
they handle. The public uses futures contracts to speculate
on price swings.
   Nonetheless, delivery locations are important because they
help keep the futures market in line with the spot market.
The move follows an intense debate over whether Chicago is
growing obsolete as a delivery point. Relatively little grain
flows through the city anymore. A significant portion of the
Midwest's crops are transported down the Mississippi River
for export through the Gulf of Mexico.
   CBOT Chairman William F. O'Connor said the addition of St.
Louis will help futures contracts "conform better" with the
cash grain markets.

   ``We're soaked pretty good now,'' said Lyon County, Kan.,
Emergency Preparedness coordinator Steve Davis, who was watching
the Neosho and Cottonwood rivers. ``If we get more, it could be
bad. The rivers will rise.''
   From midnight until mid-afternoon, thunderstorms produced

<HEAD>Strong Thunderstorms Over Midwest, Winter In The Rockies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong thunderstorms developed over parts of Iowa and Missouri
today, while snow continued to pile up in the Rockies.
   Storms on Thursday produced scattered tornadoes in Iowa and
Nebraska, officials said.
   One twister swooped down within 1,000 yards of Bluffs Run
greyhound race track in Council Bluffs, Iowa, sending track patrons
scrambling for cover, officials said. One man was injured when he
was struck in the head by debris and required stitches, a security
guard said.
   In a separate incident, Jerry Ostendorf, operations chief for
the Iowa Office of Disaster Services, said a woman was injured when
a mobile home was overturned in Corning, a town in southwestern
Iowa.
   A security guard at Bluffs Run said he climbed into a ditch as
the twister passed overhead.
   ``I grabbed a pretty sturdy tree in the ditch and I could feel
the pressure pulling up on me,'' said James Wanner, 23, of Council
Bluffs. ``I felt the hair on my arms standing up. We were pretty
scared.''
   Showers and thunderstorms today were over southeast Nebraska,
northeast Kansas, central Illinois, central Indiana, southern
Wisconsin and southern Minnesota.
   A few showers and thunderstorms were also over south-central
Texas and southeastern Louisiana.
   Omaha, Neb., received an inch and a half of rain in the six

in New Hampshire.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over eastern sections
of the Dakotas, and from north-central Missouri to the lower Ohio
Valley.
   Thunderstorms developed across sections of western Texas.
   Temperatures soared into the 90s from western Texas into
southwestern Kansas as a result of a stagnant upper-level high
pressure system over northern Mexico.
   Record highs for the date included 93 at Concordia, Kan.; 82 at
Denver; 94 at Dodge City, Kan.; 86 at Kansas City, Mo.; 96 at
Midland, Texas, and 89 at Wichita, Kan. Amarillo, Texas, tied its

   Winds gusted to about 70 mph at Denver and Marshall, Mo., to 65
mph at Trenton, Ill., and to 60 mph at St Louis and near Vandalia,
Mo.
   Winds also gusted to 61 mph at Guadalupe Pass between Carlsbad,
N.M. and El Paso, Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms lingered late Tuesday in parts of the
Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Washington state,

   Tornados killed a child, injured at least 14 others and damaged
scores of buildings in northern and western Oklahoma on Tuesday.
   Water from a swollen reservoir tumbled through floodgates in an
ever more powerful flow today, threatening to swamp 200 square
miles of southeastern Texas.
   Parts of Arkansas flooded since May 1 were declared a disaster
area Tuesday by President Bush as National Guardsmen worked to
shore up a weakened levee protecting a small town from the Red
River, which climbed toward a 45-year high.
   There was serious flooding along the little Blue, the Blue and
Platte rivers around Kansas City, Mo. Highways were closed by
flooding near Lees Summit, Smithville, and Independence, all in
Missouri.
   The little Blue was expected to crest as much as 26 feet higher
than flood stage.
   Flood warnings remained along the upper and middle reaches of
the Marais des Cygnes River in Kansas. The crest was expected to
reach Quenemo, Kan., Tuesday night, nearly 7 feet over flood stage,
and Pomona, Kan., today, about 2 feet over flood stage.
   Major flooding continued along the lower half of the middle Red
River basin. The river's predicted crest of about 7 feet higher
than flood stage at Coushatta, La., was expected to be higher than
the 1957 flood but about 2 feet lower than the record flood of 1945.
   A flood warning was posted for the little Miami River at
Milford, Ohio, and the river was out of its banks and flooding the
road near Loveland.
   Flooding also was reported at Greensurg, Ky., Tuesday evening.
   A few temperatures were unseasonably high. Records for the date
were set or tied in several cities, including Fort Myers, Fla, with
96 degrees, breaking the 95-degree record set in 1985.

   Thunderstorms spread from southern Ohio to southeast Kansas and
eastern Oklahoma and were scattered across the East and Gulf coasts,
dampening the hopes of many Americans for a glimpse of Wednesday

   Soaking rain continued faling over the central United States on
Tuesday, and wet weather was scattered over the northwestern and
southeastern corners of the nation.
   Showers and thunderstorms dumped rain on parts of Kansas and
Missouri during the morning.
   Last year at this time, parts of northern Missouri were begging
for rain as annual rainfall amounts were off by nearly 10 inches.
   But over the weekend and up to Tuesday, Maryville, Mo., had
recorded 8.20 inches of rain. Other amounts included 5.74 inches at
Amity, Mo.; 3.93 at Unionville, Mo., and 3.46 at Kansas City, Mo.

<HEAD>More Hot, Dry Air Over Central Part Of Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An area of high pressure accompanied by high temperatures was in
place Sunday to continue dry weather over the central part of the
nation, while thunderstorms rained on the South.
   The high pressure area, centered over northeastern New Mexico,
extended northward to cover the central Plains, the central Rockies
and the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah.
   It would divert any major weather systems up across southern
Canada and maintain dry weather across much of the Plains and as
the Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee valleys.
   During the night, showers and thunderstorms moved across parts
of Minnesota and Wisconsin but drought-stricken areas of
northwestern Minnesota got little benefit.
   The high pressure also pushed hot air across the central Plains
and Missouri Valley with highs in the mid 90s as far as South
Dakota and southwestern Minnesota, and between 100 and 105 degrees
over parts of south-central Nebraska and north-central Kansas.
   Record highs Sunday were 92 at Alpena, Mich., a tie; 89 at
Duluth, Minn.; 88 at International Falls, Minn., a tie; 97 at
Kansas City, Mo.; 86 at Marquette, Mich.; 100 at North Platte,
Neb.; 100 at Sioux City, Iowa; and 102 at Sioux Falls, S.D.
   Thunderstorms were widespread across the lower Mississippi
Valley, accompanied by heavy rain.
   Thunderstorms also occurred over the central Appalachians, the
Florida Peninsula, the southern tip of Texas, central California
and northwestern Arizona. Thunderstorms also developed during the
afternoon across western Georgia.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56
degrees at Crescent City, Calif., to 105 at Cozad, Neb., and Hill
City, Kan. Sunday morning's low was 36 at Gunnison, Colo.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from central and southern Georgia into the eastern half of the Gulf
Coast and Florida. Scattered showers and thunderstorms also were
forecast between the central Sierra Nevada and the central Rockies,
and over northern New England.
   Highs in the 70s and 80s were predicted along the California
coast into the Pacific Northwest, and from the northern Great Lakes
region into the upper Ohio Valley and the northern Appalachian
Mountains; around 100 from south-central Nebraska through western
and central Kansas into western Oklahoma, from extreme eastern
Montana into western South Dakota, and from the central valleys of
California into the desert Southwest; and in the 90s across much of

northern Maine; in the 90s from southwestern sections of Washington
state through central Oregon into the valleys of California;
between 95 and 105 from the central Rockies through the northern

<HEAD>Tornado, Large Hail Batter Illinois And Missouri</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms rolled across the Midwest on Thursday with
high wind, a tornado, large hail and heavy rain.
   The storms, forming in unstable air along a cold front, spawned
a tornado near Vandalia, Ill., and dropped hail as big as baseballs
east of that city. The tornado damaged some trees.
   Parts of the Chicago area received more than an inch of rain
between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m., said National Weather Service
meteorologist Rich Brumer.
   ``This is the springtime weather which we should have got last
year when we had the drought,'' Brumer said. ``Farmers still need
more rain.''
   The night before, tornadoes flattened farmsteads and wrecked
mobile homes in Iowa and Wisconsin, and one person was killed.
Early Thursday, a tornado in northwestern Ohio damaged buildings in
one village and ripped the tops off trees, the weather service said.
   Hail more than 3 inches in diameter pelted areas near Dittmer
and Herculaneum, Mo. Hail as big as golf balls damaged cars in
northern Webster County, Mo., and broke windows and tore siding off
houses at Greenfield, Ill.
   Hail the size of golf balls also fell in Illinois at
Taylorville, Carrollton, Litchfield and Carlinville, and in
Missouri near St. Clair and at Marshall.
   Hail 1{ inches in diameter broke windows in Lafayette County,
Mo., and caused crop damage in Lafayette County, the weather
service said.
   Thunderstorm winds gusted to 58 mph at Jefferson City, Mo., and
to 60 mph at Midway, Mo.
   Wind overturned a mobile home with five people inside near
Mexico, Mo., but no one was injured, the weather service said.
   A storm that hit a campground at Springfield, Ill., damaged
seven trailers, including two that were overturned, and a 30-foot
recreational vehicle was moved 40 feet, officials said. Six people
suffered minor injuries.
   Elsewhere, snow showers tapered off over the mountains and
foothills of north-central Montana. Two to 3 inches of snow fell in
the Bearpaw Mountains of Montana.
   Temperatures across western and southern Texas climbed into the
90s and above 100 again, and San Antonio reached a record high of
97 degrees.
   By contrast, a freeze advisory was posted overnight for
southeastern Wyoming, where temperatures were expected to drop to
the 20s and 30s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 36
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 104 at Laredo,
Texas. Thursday's low for the 48 contiguous states was 19 degrees
at Truckee, Calif.
   For Friday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the Texas Panhandle to Arkansas, the Ohio Valley, the central
Appalachians and New England. Scattered showers were forecast
across the Great Lakes and over the Pacific Northwest.
   Highs in the 50s were predicted from eastern North Dakota to
northern Minnesota; the 60s from the Pacific Northwest to the
northern and central Rockies, the northern Plains and upper
Michigan; the 90s from inland Southern California to southern New
Mexico, all of Texas except the Panhandle, much of the Gulf Coast,
Florida and the southern Atlantic Coast; above 100 degrees in the
desert Southwest and along the Rio Grande Valley of southwestern
Texas; and in the 70s or 80s over the rest of the nation.

   A broad area of thunderstorms soaked the central Plains with
heavy rains on Labor Day, but most of the western half of the nation
had sunny skies and eastern skies were clear to partly cloudy.
   The rain fell heaviest across eastern Nebraska, eastern Kansas,
western Iowa, and northern and western Missouri, with most places
getting about 2 inches, with between 3 and 5 inches reported in some
areas.
   Flood warnings issued for eastern Nebraska's Maple Creek in Dodge
County, which swelled to 2 feet above flood stage, expected to reach
4 feet above flood stage Tuesday morning. High water closed some
roads around Kansas City, Mo.
   Strong southerly winds followed the thunderstorms in southern
Iowa and extreme northern Missouri. Wind gusts reached 58 miles an
hour at Ottumwa, Iowa, and 47 miles an hour at Spickard, Mo.
   Heavy rain also fell in parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin as
thunderstorms moved across the area.
   Thunderstorms were scattered across coastal parts of the Gulf and
South Atlantic states, including the Florida Peninsula.
Apalachicola, Fla., got 1{ inches of rain in two hours Monday
afternoon.
   Skies were sunny on Labor Day across most of the Western half of
the nation. Skies were partly cloudy or clear over inland sections
of the Gulf Coast states, the Tennessee and Ohio valleys, the
Appalachians and the Middle and North Atlantic coast states.
   Hurricane Gabrielle, with highest sustained winds of 125 mph,
continued to move toward the west northwest over the open Atlantic.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 106 degrees at Palm Springs, Calif.
The low in the Lower 48 states on Labor Day morning was 19 degrees

   The national forecast for Tuesday called for showers and
thunderstorms from Florida and southern Georgia to the central Gulf
Coast; scattered showers and thunderstorms from the lower Great
Lakes region across the lower Ohio and middle Mississippi valleys to
parts of Kansas, Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle; widely scattered
thunderstorms in the mountains of Arizona; and scattered showers
from western Montana to Washington state.
   High temperatures will be in the 70s from North Carolina to New
England, and from northern Michigan to Minnesota; in the 60s and 70s
from the northern Rockies to the Pacific Northwest and along the
California coast; 100 degrees in parts of Texas, and between 100 and
110 degrees in the desert Southwest. Elsewhere, highs will be in the
80s and 90s.

<HL> Kansas City Southern's Pursuit of Unit Of Santa Fe Is Imperiled by Jury Award </HL>

   Last week's stunning jury award against Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. threatens to derail the company's pursuit of a Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. railroad unit.

   The success of that quest was in doubt even before the verdict, largely because Santa Fe already had accepted a competing offer from a unit of Rio Grande Industries.

   A federal district court jury in Sioux Falls, S.D., awarded South Dakota between $243 million and $611 million for antitrust violations and contract interference related to a coal-slurry pipeline project that, the state argued, Kansas City Southern and unidentified co-conspirator railroads conspired to block.

   The jury award surprised the company and industry analysts alike, especially since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the company's favor earlier this year on a minor issue related to the case.

   "It's a huge, unexpected judgment when most of the signals were in favor of management," said Gary Saunders of Josephthal &amp; Co., New York.
He added that Kansas City Southern's effort to acquire the Southern Pacific Railroad was "unlikely even prior to this liability.
Now it's going to be even more difficult to convince the Interstate Commerce Commission and shareholders that the acquisition is in its (Kansas City Southern) best interest.
It's extremely negative."

   Yesterday, Kansas City Southern's stock closed at $39.875, down $5.125, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

   Kansas City Southern is a Kansas City, Mo.-based railroad and data-processing concern.

   An analyst said the stock was hit heavily by a double whammy -- the South Dakota verdict and the end of speculation that Kansas City Southern was itself a takeover target.
That speculation ended after New York investor Howard Kaskel, who made a hostile bid for the company, sold his 11.3% interest for $60 a share to Kansas City Southern and Hallmark Corp., the Kansas City, Mo.-based greeting card company.

   Not all analysts were highly pessimistic about the verdict.
"It seems like a preposterous (verdict)" said an analyst.
"On appeal, they (Kansas City Southern) ought to win."

   If the antitrust verdict is upheld, Kansas City Southern would be faced with paying the $611 million judgment, which mostly represents the triple damages the federal law allows.
Should the antitrust portion of the verdict be overturned, the company still would have to pay $243 million for contract interference, a violation of state laws.

   Analysts likened the judgment to the famous Pennzoil Co.-Texaco Inc. case where Texaco was hit with a staggeringly high judgment that forced Texaco into bankruptcy-law proceedings.
"Where would they ever get the money?" asked Michael D. Smith, an analyst with First Kansas City Securities Inc., Kansas City, Mo.
He estimates that the low-end $243 million verdict would represent about two-thirds of Kansas City Southern's book value.

   South Dakota had claimed the Kansas City Southern and the unnamed railroads had a vested interest in keeping the coal slurry -- which would transport coal from Wyoming's Powder River Basin, through South Dakota to customers in the south -- from being built since the pipeline would directly compete with the railroads.
South Dakota charged Kansas City Southern with instigating costly, time-consuming litigation against the pipeline that eventually resulted in the project being abandoned.

   Kansas City Southern said it will file for the verdict to be set aside by the court as well as for a new trial.
And a spokesman said the company probably would appeal the verdict if it's allowed to stand.
For support, the company pointed to a unanimous Supreme Court decision in February, which invalidated South Dakota's agreement to sell Missouri River water to an entity that was formed to develop the coal-slurry pipeline.

   But Roger Pellinghuisen, South Dakota's attorney general, said the state is "confident in the strength of the verdict.
We've been successful on the same issues they've raised and expect to be successful on appeal."
He said the Supreme Court decided on a minor issue that is irrelevant to the antitrust and contract interference questions.

   Landon H. Rowland, Kansas City Southern's president and chief executive officer, said the company still intends to file its application for acquiring Southern Pacific as well as its objections to that railroad unit's sale to the railroad unit of Rio Grande Industries, itself a subsidiary of Denver-based Anschutz Corp.

   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said that as a result of the jury verdict, it's reviewing for possible downgrading the single-A-3 rating on about $63 million in of Kansas City Southern debentures.
Mr. Rowland said, "I appreciate that they have a job to do, but I think they're premature."

<HEAD>Rain, More Record Heat In East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain was scattered along the Mississippi Valley on Saturday and
along the southern East Coast and central Appalachians, and there
was more high humidity and record heat across the eastern half of
the nation.
   Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and atmospheric disturbance
produced heavy showers and thunderstorms over the middle
Mississippi Valley and near a stationary front from Wisconsin
across Minnesota to North Dakota.
   Showers and thunderstorms spread along the southern Atlantic
Coast from Florida to the Carolinas, and a few showers and
thunderstorms developed from West Virginia to western New York.
   About an inch of rain fell in just one hour at both Sioux Falls,
S.D., and Key West, Fla. St. Peters, Mo., near St. Louis, got more
than three-quarters of an inch of rain, most of it in just 10
minutes.
   Alexandria, Minn., got 1.83 inches of rain in the six hours up
to 2 p.m. EDT, while Park Falls, Wis., got 1.22 inches and Sioux
Falls, S.D., got 1.01 inches.
   During the night in northern Minnesota, 3.50 inches fell at
Hibbing, and more than 4 inches fell at Grand Rapids and Nashwak.
   A tropical depression had formed off the Florida coast, but ship
reports and other observations indicated that it was poorly
organized and no significant change in strength was expected into
Sunday.
   Detroit and Williamsport, Pa., both hit 90 degrees Saturday, for
the 37th day this summer for Detroit and and 38th time for
Williamsport. Many other cities have similar experiences this
summer.
   Temperatures rose above 100 degrees over parts of western
Oklahoma and southwestern Kansas. Altus Air Force Base, Okla.,
reached 105 degrees at 2 p.m. CDT.
   The airport just inland from Atlantic City, N.J., hit a record
high for the date of 95. But along the beach, temperatures were
only in the 70s, the National Weather Service said.
   Other record highs Saturday were 92 at Alpena, Mich.; 90 at
Binghamton, N.Y.; and 97 at Hartford, Conn. Muskegon, Mich., tied
its record of 90; New York City tied its record of 96; and Traverse
City, Mich., tied its record of 94.
   At the other extreme, Alamosa, Colo., had a record low of 36.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Arcata, Calif., and Bremerton, Wash., to 106 at Gila
Bend, Ariz. The nation's low Saturday morning was 32 at Gunnison,
Colo.
   For Sunday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the northern Atlantic Coast states across the Great Lakes
region, the Ohio Valley, the upper Mississippi Valley, sections of
the Dakotas and Montana to eastern Washington. Scattered showers
and thunderstorms also were forecast from the Carolinas coast
across Florida, the Gulf Coast states and Arkansas to eastern and
north-central Texas.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s were predicted along the Pacific Coast;
ranging from 75 to 85 over northern New England, from northern
Michigan across Minnesota to eastern North Dakota, and from the
northern Rockies to the Pacific Northwest; above 100 across
sections of the Plains from South Dakota to Texas; between 100 and
112 in the desert Southwest; and in the upper 80s and 90s across
most of the rest of the nation.

   Canadian air chilled the upper Midwest on Wednesday and brought
wet, blustery weather to the Great Lakes region.
   Cold air flowing from the north over Lake Ontario produced
scattered showers and thunderstorms over western New York state.
Small hail pelted Oswego, and pea-sized hail was reported near
Saratoga Springs.
   Showers fell along the southern shores of Lake Erie in northwest
Pennsylvania and the southern shores of Lake Michigan. Rain showers
mixed with light snow over upper Michigan. Light rain dampened
Oklahoma and southern Kansas.
   Thunderstorms formed over northern Arizona, southern Utah and
southern Nevada, and showers and thunderstorms also were over
central Colorado and along the Atlantic Coast of Florida.
   Heavier rainfall in the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
nearly half an inch at Tulsa, Okla., and a third of an inch at
Mcconnell Air Force Base, at Wichita, Kan.
   Temperatures dipped to the middle 30s in Illinois Tuesday night,
and were in the 30s Wednesday afternoon in parts of Minnesota,

Kentucky frost.
   By contrast, temperatures were in the 70s in the south half of
Texas, the Gulf Coast region, northern Florida, eastern parts of
the southern Atlantic Coast states, inland northern California and
the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah. Temperatures in the 80s

Scattered showers and thunderstorms were expected in southern
Florida, Arizona and Utah. Cloudy skies were predicted in the
middle Mississippi Valley.
   High temperatures were forecast to be in the 40s in the northern

<HEAD>Severe Storms Linger in Much of Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms blanketed much of the nation today, soaking
Kansas with heavy rain, after destructive tornadoes and fierce winds
ripped through parts of Missouri and Texas.
   Showers and thunderstorms drenched the eastern Dakotas, central
Oklahoma, western Minnesota, Iowa, eastern Missouri, Illinois,
southern Indiana, western Kentucky, western Tennessee, northern
Mississippi and northern Alabama this morning. Showers also were
scattered from eastern Montana across Colorado.
   In Kansas, about 30 families were evacuated from their homes in
Coffeyville early Sunday after flash flooding over the weekend, said
police Officer Ray McDaniel.
   ``A lot of the families are back at the houses cleaning up now,''
McDaniel said late Sunday. ``But nobody has moved back in.''
   Besides street flooding in the southeastern Kansas community,
cars were submerged and several power outages were reported, he said.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT included
2 inches at Cape Girardeau, Mo., and 1\ inches at Burlington, Iowa.
   A tornado tore through Steele, Mo., on Sunday evening, leveling
at least two homes, and leaving one woman hospitalized after she
suffered a heart attack, authorities said.
   The twister struck an area south of Steele, in southeast
Missouri, at about 6 p.m.
   A tornado also touched down west of Groom, Texas, late Sunday.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorm winds caused damage at Meridian, Miss.,
and thunderstorm gusts hit 52 mph at Las Vegas, Nev.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
Great Lakes across the Ohio Valley, the central and southern
Appalachians, the Tennessee Valley, much of the Mississippi Valley,
northern Texas, Oklahoma, the Dakotas, eastern Montana and much of
Colorado.
   Predicted highs: 60s and 70s from northern New England across the
northern Appalachians, the Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley, the upper
Mississippi Valley, the northern Plains, from Montana across eastern
Colorado, and the California coast; 90s from southern South Carolina
across Florida, the lower half of the central Gulf of Mexico states,
much of Texas and New Mexico, and from southwest Oregon across
eastern and central California; near 105 across the desert
Southwest; and in the 80s over the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 85 at Phoenix.

<HEAD>Snow, Freezing Rain in Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy snow, freezing rain, or a mix of the two hit the Midwest
today, leaving up to a foot of snow and making roads treacherous,
while the next storm churned off the Pacific Coast.
   Snow fell in North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Indiana, and
freezing rain in Wisconsin, Iowa, Michigan and Ohio.
   Winter storm warnings were in effect for northern Minnesota and
for eastern North Dakota, where 20 to 35 mph winds were expected to
make wind chills a dangerous 50 degrees below zero.
   The storm Monday dumped up to 12 inches of snow on Chicago and on
Thief River Falls and Bemidji, Minn., and was expected to leave as
much as 14 inches in northwest Minnesota.
   Three to 5 inches of snow covered southern Wisconsin before
changing to rain as warmer air moved in Monday evening. Indiana got
up to 7 inches.
   The freezing rain left a layer of ice on top of 1 to 3 inches of
snow that fell Monday, making roads slick and dangerous.
   In the lower Missouri Valley, showers and thunderstorms brought
winds gusting to 45 mph and brief heavy rain. By early today, the
thunderstorms extended southwest into northwest Texas.
   The next big storm was off the northern Pacific Coast. A freezing
rain advisory was in effect for the western Columbia Gorge in
Oregon, and an advisory for 6 or more inches of snow was posted for
the state's Cascade Mountains.
   In Nevada, temperatures dropped to minus 17 degrees late Monday,
breaking the 1962 record for the date of 12 below. Freeze warnings
were up today in the California valleys, where temperatures were
expected to drop into the 20s.
   By contrast, a high-temperature record was set Monday in Kansas
City, Mo., where it was 60 degrees, 10 degrees higher than the 1979
mark. The 75 degrees in Wichita Falls tied the mark set in 1942.
   The nation's high was 85 degrees in Beeville, Texas, where
President-elect Bush flew Monday for a quail-hunting vacation.
Cotulla, Kingsville and Laredo, Texas, also had 85-degree readings.
   Today's forecast called for snow, with rain at lower elevations,
from the northern Rockies to the northern Pacific Coast; snow from
the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles to sections of Oklahoma, Kansas,
Missouri, Iowa, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan and
from New York state to the central New England coast. Snow was
expected to change to freezing rain over parts of Oklahoma, South
Dakota and Wisconsin; rain and occasional thunderstorms was expected
from the eastern three-quarters of Texas to the lower Mississippi
Valley, Missouri, Illinois, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania
and much of inland New York.
   High temperatures were forecast in the single digits in eastern
Montana and North Dakota; the teens and 20s in the Rockies, the rest
of the northern Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley, Upper
Michigan, northeast New York and northern New England; the 30s and
40s in central New England, Maryland, Delaware, the rest of the
Great Lakes, the central Mississippi Valley, the eastern two-thirds
of Kansas, western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, southern sections
of New Mexico and Arizona, and the northern two-thirds of the
Pacific Coast; the 70s and 80s in Florida, the lower Mississippi
Valley and the Texas coast; and in the 50s and 60s in the rest of
the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 20
degrees below zero at Butte, Mont., to 74 degrees at Homestead, Fla.
   Other reports:
   _East: Atlanta 44 partly cloudy; Boston 21 fair; Buffalo 26

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms rumbled over parts of the eastern half of the
nation early today, hours after tornadoes touched down in southern
Kansas.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed over the eastern coast of
Florida, New York, Kentucky, northern Tennessee, southern Illinois,
Missouri and northern Arkansas.
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms doused parts of South Dakota,
northern Kansas, eastern Montana, New Mexico, western Texas and
western Washington state.
   Twisters hit Sunday night near Burden and Latham, Kan. No
injuries were reported.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included almost an inch at Kirksville, Mo.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms over New
England, northern Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, the Ohio Valley,
Illinois, the middle Mississippi Valley, eastern Kansas, northeast
Oklahoma, Florida and the Alabama coast; scattered showers along the
South Carolina coast and over northwest Montana and southeastern
South Dakota; and rain over northwest Washington state.
   Highs were expected to be in the upper 60s in northeast Minnesota
and northwest Washington state; in the upper 80s and the 90s in
Maryland, Florida, Tennessee, the central Gulf Coast, the lower
Mississippi Valley, the southern Plains, southern New Mexico and
central California; in the 100s in the desert Southwest; and in the

<HEAD>Tornadoes in Wyoming; Snow in Great Basin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Tornadoes skipped across portions of Wyoming on Thursday as a
storm system crossed the Rocky Mountains. The same weather front
brought snow to parts of Nevada, Idaho and Utah and locally heavy
rains.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell on parts of the Midwest and
Florida, and scattered showers fell from the Pacific Northwest to
the Rockies.
   There were five tornado sightings in eastern Wyoming, and a
funnel cloud was reported in Sheridan County in the north-central
part of the state. A funnel cloud becomes a tornado once it touches
the ground.
   Although five sightings were reported, there may have been only
two or three tornadoes, said Mike Weiland of the National Weather
Service. ``Some of these reports might be of the same tornadoes,''
Weiland said.
   There were no reports of injuries or damage.
   Snow fell overnight in northeastern Nevada and parts of Idaho
and Utah. Five inches of snow fell at Austin, Nev.
   Further south, a wind advisory was posted for northern Arizona,
where gusts to 43 mph were reported at Winslow. Strong, gusty winds
were also reported in northern Utah.
   Showers were scattered from eastern Washington state, eastern
Oregon and northeastern Nevada to the northern and central Rocky
Mountain region. Showers also were reported over western Nebraska
and western South Dakota. A mixture of rain, snow and hail fell at
Yellowstone National Park, Wyo.
   A tornado watch was in effect for parts of east-central and
southeastern Montana, much of eastern Wyoming, portions of western
South Dakota and portions of the Nebraska Panhandle.
   Showers and thunderstorms were clustered over eastern Kansas,
western and central Missouri and southern and central Iowa early
Thursday afternoon. Showers and thunderstorms south of Kansas City,
Mo., produced 2 inches of rain at Stilwell, Kan.
   Showers and thunderstorms were also reported over southern
Florida.
   Dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation, with sunny
skies over much of California, Nevada and Arizona.
   Temperatures dipped into the 30s in New England and eastern New
York state, and into the 30s and upper 20s in the Great Basin and
the northern Plateau region.
   The low of 47 degrees at Cape Hatteras, N.C., was a record for
the date.
   The low for the Lower 48 states was 29 degrees at Lakeview, Ore.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Persist in Central U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms, some record-setting in intensity,
brought more desperately needed relief today to parts of the
central United States choking under a record-setting drought.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell over much of the central Plains,
and rain was widely scattered over much of the High Plains, the
lower and middle Mississippi Valley and along the Atlantic Coast.
   A few of the thunderstorms on Wednesday unleashed high winds and
in southwest Texas spawned a tornado.
   Springfield, Mo., received more than 3{ inches of rain, more
than double the record of 1.51 inches set on the date in 1905.
Nearly 5 inches deluged Wilsey, Kan., 60 miles southwest of Topeka,
and Hill City, S.D., got 2 inches.
   Thunderstorms in eastern Kansas produced wind gusts up to 60
mph, downing several large trees at Pittsburg, gusts to 69 mph
south of Glasgow, Mont., and gusts to 65 mph at Miami, Okla.
   A break from the heat continued in most areas, although the
mercury hit 105 degrees in Jackson, Miss., on Wednesday, surpassing
the June record of 103 set in 1969. Shortly before midnight, the
temperature at Youngstown, Ohio, dipped to 48 degrees to break the
previous record low of 51 for June 29.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
central and lower Missouri Valley through northern and eastern
Oklahoma and into much of the Tennessee Valley and the southern
Atlantic region; showers and a few thunderstorms from the northern
and central Plains through Arkansas into much of the Southeast
states and Florida; and showers scattered across northern parts and
coastal areas of New England.
   Highs were expected to be in the 60s across the northern parts
of the Great Lakes into New England; the 50s for extreme northern
New England; the 90s from the southern Rockies through the southern
Plains, the lower Mississippi Valley and the southern Atlantic
Coast into Florida; around 100 in parts of central Mississippi and
the Rio Grande Plains of Texas; and between 100 and 110 from the
valleys of California into the Southwestern deserts.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 41
degrees at Burns, Ore., to 89 degrees at Las Vegas, Nev., and
Phoenix, Ariz.

   Rain soaked the drought-stricken Plains today, but prayers for
precipitation by Alabama's governor went unanswered and forecasters
cautioned that a lot more rain would be needed to reverse the long
dry spell.
   ``It's likely to get worse before it gets better,'' Michael
Hudlow, director of hydrology for the National Weather Service said
as long-range forecasts were released Wednesday.
   Showers and thunderstorms fell today over much of the central
Plains, and rain was widely scattered over much of the High Plains
and the lower and middle Mississippi Valley.
   Americans who prayed or danced for rain in recent weeks got it
in spades in some places Wednesday.
   In North Platte, Neb., more than 2 inches of rain fell in about
90 minutes, flooding city streets, caving in the roof of a downtown
business and causing at least $25,000 damage to a hotel,
authorities said. A tornado touched down near the city, but no
injuries were reported.
   Springfield, Mo., received more than 3{ inches of rain
Wednesday, more than double the record set on the date in 1905, the
weather service said. Nearly 5 inches deluged Wilsey, Kan., 60
miles southwest of Topeka, and Hill City, S.D., got 2 inches.
   The 3.7 inches of rain that fell Wednesday in west-central
Minnesota was the first significant moisture since the Memorial Day
weekend, said John Cunningham, agricultural extension agent in Big
Stone County.
   ``Those people that got this rain will get some corn now,'' said
Cunningham, who called the precipitation a psychological boost for
farmers. ``It keeps things alive.''
   But the weather service issued an advisory Wednesday saying the
nation's driest areas remained basically unchanged. The most
critical area extends from the Gulf of Mexico to the Canadian
border east of the Continental Divide and west of the Applachians.
Drought conditions are severe to extreme in the inland Pacific
Northwest, California, the nothern Rockies, the northern Plains,
the Great Lakes, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the southern
Applachians and northern New England.
   Record heat has exacerbated the problem. In the first 25 days of
June, nearly 550 high-temperature records were set or tied, the
service said.
   For the next 30 days, below-normal rainfall was expected in
Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky and most of California.
   However, above-normal rainfall was predicted for some
drought-plagued parts of Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska,
Kansas, New Mexico, Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas.
   As the weather service released its forecast, Republican Vice
President George Bush attended a livestock auction in Marion, Wis.,
and his Democratic presidential rival, Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, visited an Iowa corn field.
   ``We do want to help,'' Bush told about 200 people at the
auction. ``I don't want to over-promise,'' he said, cautioning no
major changes should be expected in federal dairy policies.
   Dukakis, visiting a farm south of Des Moines, stressed ``the
importance of pulling together'' during the drought.
   ``We're one nation and one community and one family,'' he told
about 250 people under threatening skies and in chilly weather that
caused many to don sweaters.
   ``I don't know whether those storm clouds overhead mean Dukakis
brings good fortune,'' he said. ``I hope so.''
   In Alabama, Gov. Guy Hunt, a Primitive Baptist preacher who ran
a farm before his 1986 election, declared Wednesday a day of prayer
and asked all Alabamians to join him.
   ``Many of our people are suffering,'' Hunt said in a prayer at
the start of a meeting with legislators at the Governor's Mansion.
He asked God to ``bless our state, our lands with bountiful rain.''
   There was no measurable precipitation anywhere in the state as
of this morning, but John Hoffner of the weather service in
Birmingham said Wednesday the prayers were well-timed because a
storm was approaching northern Alabama.
   In other developments:
   _Grain and soybean futures prices tumbled on the Chicago Board
of Trade as the Midwestern rain spurred some of the steepest
declines in the exchange's history.
   ``It was just panic liquidation,'' said Jay Homan, an
independent trader.
   _The Agriculture Department reported the average soybean price
jumped this month to its highest level since May 1977 and the fifth
highest ever. Corn and wheat prices increased to their highest
levels since August 1985 and May 1984, respectively.
   _The Ohio River, which reopened only Friday after a barge
traffic jam, was closed again for more dredging near its confluence
with Mississippi.
   ``Conditions, based on what I see, are just deteriorating,''
said Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Jim Clifton at Paducah, Ky., predicting
that the latest closure would last three to four days.
   _On the Mississippi, nine towboats ran aground, said Coast Guard
Cmdr. Michael Donohoe, who tightened shipping restrictions for the
third time in a week. Donohoe limited southbound towboats with
nine-foot drafts to 12 barges, down from 20.
   _Country clubs from the Corn Belt to the East Coast are
reporting that golf courses are cracked and parched from the
drought. Officials of the Professional Golfers Association and
Ladies Professional Golfers Association said tour courses are
holding up because they're better maintained to begin with, but
links that lack irrigation systems or depend upon restricted city
water are suffering.

   Rain and thunderstorms were scattered across broad sections of
the nation Wednesday, and hot weather continued from the central
Plains into the Ohio Valley.
   Kansas City, Mo., hit a record high of 95.
   Several schools in Nebraska scheduled early class dismissals for
a second day this week because of the heat and lack of air
conditioning in classrooms.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from western New York state
across northern and western Pennsylvania during the afternoon, and
across eastern Ohio, northern West Virginia and Maryland, with a
threat of heavy rain.
   Showers and storms also reached over Florida, southeastern
Louisiana, and along the lower Texas Gulf Coast.
   Late Tuesday, wind up to 78 mph ripped the roof from at least
one building and knocked out power to 46,000 homes and businesses
during a brief but heavy thunderstorm that hit the New Orleans area.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over western Upper
Michigan, northwestern Wisconsin, east-central through northwestern
Minnesota and eastern North Dakota.
   Showers and storms extended over the southern half of New
Mexico, north-central Colorado, southwestern Montana, northeastern
Wyoming, eastern Idaho, southern Nevada and southeastern California.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.48 inches at West Palm Beach, Fla., and 0.86 of an inch at the
Naval air station near Jacksonville, Fla.
   Tropical Storm Isidore formed over the Atlantic but was not a
threat to any major land area. Its center was 750 miles southwest
of the Cape Verde islands off the coast of Africa.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 31 at Truckee, Calif.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57 at
San Simeon, Calif., to 102 at Longview, Texas.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Rumble Across Midsection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms rumbled across parts of the nation's midsection
earlier today after storms dropped large hail and heavy rain.
   Thunderstorms were scattered from northern Montana into northern
North Dakota, central and southwest Minnesota and southwest
Nebraska early this morning.
   Golf ball-size hail and 1-2 inches of rain fell near Miller,
S.D., Thursday evening, but many of the thunderstorms that were
rumbling over the southern Atlantic Coast and Gulf Coast regions
earlier in the day weakened by late Thursday. Many of these storms
developed due to very warm and humid air in the afternoon, then
died out as the evening air cooled.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered Thursday night over
parts of eastern Colorado and extreme western Kansas. Thunderstorms
also were widely scattered in northeast and central New Mexico.
Nearly 1\ inches of rain fell in 20 minutes in the Four Hills area
of Albuquerque, where street flooding was reported.
   Thunderstorms also were scattered over western Arizona on
Thursday evening. Strong thunderstorm winds damaged several
trailers near Surprise, Ariz.
   Widely scattered thunderstorms developed from south-central and
southeast Kansas into southwest Missouri.
   Rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT included
nearly an inch at Kennedy Airport near New York City, a half-inch
at Joplin, Mo., over a third of an inch at Alexandria, Minn., and
Huron, S.D., and over a quarter inch at Albuquerque.
   For today, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast for
the southern Atlantic and Gulf Coastal states, the lower Missouri
and middle Mississippi valleys, northeast Minnesota and the High
Plains of Colorado.
   High temperatures were predicted to be in the 90s across much of
the nation; in the 80s along much of the California coast, the
northern parts of the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies, and
from the upper Ohio Valley into New England; in the lower 80s near
the front range of the Rockies; up to 100 degrees over parts of
north-central Texas and Illinois; and between 100 and 110 degrees
from the valleys of southwest Oregon and California into the desert
Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 53
degrees at Laramie and Lake Yellowstone, Wyo., and Arcata, Calif.,
to 91 at Phoenix and Nellis Air Force Base near Las Vegas.

   A cold front brought rain to parts of the parched upper Midwest
on Friday and record chill to the sweltering Northeast, but hot,
dry weather elsewhere withered crops and boosted the cost of
everything from grain to fish bait.
   It was the eighth straight day of 100-degree heat over the
central part of the nation.
   A plan to pour more water into the Missouri River for shipping
ran aground because it would have destroyed nesting areas for
endangered birds. But the Mississippi was reopened to barges at
Memphis, Tenn., after dredging opened a channel through a shallow
area.
   Forest fires fanned by hot wind blazed in Montana and Idaho, and
at least seven North Dakota counties have banned fireworks on July
4 because of the fire danger. Wisconsin banned outdoor smoking,
open fires and fireworks in all state parks, forests and other
state land Friday.
   Temperatures soared again at the end of a week that saw scores
of high temperatures records shattered. The sun was barely directly
overhead when the temperature at Sioux Falls, S.D., hit 100 degrees
and tied the record. The overnight low at North Platte, Neb., was
hardly low at all, dipping only to a record 74.
   Fewer cities reached record high temperatures Friday. They
included 97 at Casper, Wyo.; 101 at Chattanooga, Tenn.; 93 at
Cheyenne, Wyo.; 100 at Des Moines, Iowa; 101 at Kansas City, Mo.;
101 at Paducah, Ky.; 103 at Sioux City, Iowa; and 103 at Sioux
Falls, S.D. It was Sioux City's fifth consecutive record. The
official 3 p.m. EDT high for the 48 contiguous states was 109 at
Pierre, S.D., the National Weather Service said.
   In St. Louis, the medical examiner's office said three elderly
women had died of hyperthermia. In Georgia, Thomas County Coroner
Sam Brown said a woman died of a heart attack brought on by heat
stroke while working in a tobacco field.
   In Savannah, Ga., the Senior Citizens of Savannah-Chatham County
and the Savannah Energy Aging Consortium distributed 25 fans to the
elderly Thursday, making it 424 given out since May.
   Grain and soybean futures opened lower Friday on the Chicago
Board of Trade after overnight thundershowers spread rain over
parts of Minnesota across Wisconsin and Iowa into Illinois.
   Some parts of Iowa got more than 2 inches of rain before the hot
air returned to bake the soil.
   ``Last week the (soy) beans and corn were all curled and
shriveled, and now it looks like they're coming back,'' said Morris
Greenley, who farms near Independence, Iowa. But he said he still
faces a 20 percent cutback on his normal yields even if he gets an
average of 1 inch of rain per week for the rest of the growing
season.
   Steve Hollinger of the Illinois State Water Survey said that as
of June 15 there was ``virtually no moisture available to plants in
the top six inches of soil.'' Below that, down to 40 inches, he
said, there is about a two-week supply of moisture.
   The front ushered cool air into the Northeast and record lows
were reported in a half-dozen cities, including Burlington, Vt.,
with a chill 40 degrees. Cool air also hit the Northwest, and
Olympia, Wash., tied its record of 39.
   It's not just plants that suffer in the heat.
   Farmers have dumped about 40,000 pounds of dead cattle and hogs
a day at the Worthington Rendering Co. in southwestern Minnesota,
four times the usual volume, said manager Marlin Terhark. The
majority were victims of heat, he said.
   ``It just hurts more when you stand there and count 'em,'' said
Loren Forest of rural Luverne, Minn., saying he couldn't bear to
count the 3-month-old pigs that died this week when a cooling
sprinkler failed at his farm.
   Urban shoppers may notice some price hikes caused by the
drought, but a more immediate effect is visible at farmers' markets
in some cities.
   Candi Elston, who manages a farmers' market in Urbana, Ill.,
said five to seven regular vendors were missing this week and
people who do show up have ``less and less to sell. The drought is
the major topic of conversation.''
   Even the price of fishing is going up because nightcrawlers, a
large variety of earthworm popular as bait, have gone deep
underground seeking cooler, moist habitat.
   ``Wholesale prices of nightcrawlers are the highest in the 46
years we've been in business,'' said Phil Koep, who runs a
wholesale bait supply business in Clitherall, Minn. By July 4, he
said, the wholesale price of nightcrawlers will have doubled from a
year ago.
   On the Missouri River, the Corps of Engineers can't increase the
flow of water from the Gavins Point Dam on the South
Dakota-Nebraska border to aid shipping because that would threaten
nests of the federally protected piping plover and interior least
tern. ``Our attorneys tell us the Endangered Species law takes
precedence over the corps' obligation to maintain navigation,''
said Chet Worm, chief of reservoir operations in Omaha, Neb.
   Barges are carrying reduced loads because of low water, and
corps officials fear two weeks more without rain could endanger
traffic in some sections.
   Dredging continued on the Ohio River near Mound City, Ill.,
which was closed Tuesday when a towboat ran aground in shallow
water.
   A section of the Mississippi north of Memphis, Tenn., also was
closed much of the week for dredging.
   A fire in ponderosa pine forest grew to 15,000 acres Friday in
the Custer National Forest of southeastern Montana and was fought
by 600 firefighters. The blaze shifted late Thursday and trapped
firefighters, injuring 18. They survived by lying inside one-man
aluminum fire shelters while flames passed over them, said Bureau
of Land Management spokeswoman Michelle Ravnikar.

<HEAD>Storms Bring Hail, Strong Winds To Parts of Mid-Mississippi Valley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Intense thunderstorms, which developed ahead of a cold front
pushing through the middle Mississippi Valley, produced heavy rains
and hail Monday in portions of Illinois and Missouri, and strong
storms also were reported in Florida.
   Three hangers and two small airplanes were destroyed and seven
were damaged at the Morgan County Airport in central Missouri. Two
cars and three boats were severely damaged and one airplane was
thrown into a trailer home. No injuries were reported.
   Three-quarter-inch hail fell near Bloomington, Ill., and hail
accumulated 1{ to 2 inches deep near Cooksville, Ill.
   Strong thunderstorm winds felled power lines near Eldon, Mo.,
and hail with winds up to 65 mph were reported near Sedalia, Mo.
   These thunderstorms extended along the cold front into Indiana,
Ohio and lower Michigan, where pea-size hail was reported.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms produced pea-size hail, brief heavy
rains and gusty winds in western Maine and Vermont.
   Strong thunderstorms also hit parts of Florida. A home near St.
Petersburg sustained severe wind damage, the National Weather
Service reported.
   In the South, marble-size hail fell in Marshall County, Miss.,
prompted by thunderstorms extending from southern Arkansas to
western Alabama.
   Other showers and thunderstorms were scattered in the Carolinas,
north-central Texas, central Arizona and along the front range of
the Rocky Mountains.
   Temperatures were in the 70s in the Great Lakes states and the
northern half of New England, and even dipped into the 60s in
portions of the California coast. But much of the nation had
temperatures in the 90s, and in the desert Southwest, temperatures
climbed up to 110.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included nearly 1\ inches at Decatur, Ill., 1.05 inches at Terre
Haute, Ind., and about two-thirds an inch at Springfield, Mo., and
Memphis, Tenn.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 60
degrees at Arcata, Calif., and Crescent City, Calif., to 110
degrees at Needles, Calif. The early morning low for the nation was
35 at Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Tuesday is for scattered showers and
thunderstorms in the lower Mississippi Valley, the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys and the northern Atlantic coast states. Scattered
showers and thunderstorms also are predicted in Florida, Alabama
and Georgia and in northern Wisconsin, the front range of the
Rockies, western Utah and northern Arizona.
   Highs in the 70s were forecast along the Pacific Coast and
northwestern Washington state, as well as the upper Great Lakes and
northern Maine; in the 80s in the upper and middle Mississippi
valley, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys and from the Appalachians to
New England; above 100 degrees in north central Texas, parts of the
Rio Grande Valley, in the desert Southwest and the valleys of
California, and from northeastern Oregon to southwestern Montana;
and in the 90s elsewhere.

   Thunderstorms rumbled across much of the nation on Saturday,
sweeping through Arkansas, the lower Missouri Valley, the lower
Great Lakes and the upper Ohio Valley.
   A low pressure center in northeastern Missouri combined with a
couple weak upper-level weather systems moving southeast across
Oklahoma to create showers and thunderstorms.
   In Arkansas and the lower Missouri Valley, showers and
thunderstorms were developing early Saturday afternoon.
   Showers and thunderstorms moving along a warm front were
scattered through the lower Great Lakes region and the upper Ohio
Valley. The rain and storms also hit the southeastern United

degrees at Arcata and Crescent City, Calif., to 106 degrees at
China Lake, Calif.
   The low for the nation Saturday was 38 degrees at Baker, Ore.
   Sunday's forecast called for scattered showers and thunderstorms
from the southern Plains to the lower Great Lakes and the southern
and middle Atlantic Coast states, and from New Mexico and Arizona
to western Montana; numerous showers and thunderstorms from the
eastern and central Gulf Coast, in the middle Mississippi Valley,
and in northern and central Arizona; and sunny skies throughout the
rest of the nation.
   Sunday afternoon highs were forecast in the upper 80s and lower
90s in the southern and middle Atlantic Coast region; above 90
across much of Texas, much of the northern Plains and most of the
western United States; above 100 degrees in the southwestern
deserts; and in the 70s along the Pacific Coast.

<HEAD>Storms Hit Midwest; One Dead, Widespread Flooding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Severe thunderstorms hit parts of Missouri, Kansas and Nebraska,
causing hail, tornadoes and flooding that swept two boys into a
storm drain.
   Flooding was widespread Friday afternoon and evening across
northern portions of the Kansas City, Mo., metropolitan area.
   Robert Ragsdale, 13, was killed when he was swept into a storm
drain in North Kansas City about 5 p.m., police said. A friend,
William East, 14, was in critical condition at North Kansas City
Hospital late Friday, a hospital spokesman said.
   Police said the boys were playing in a drainage ditch when they
were swept into the drain tunnel.
   ``They were riding the drainage ditch like a water slide and the
water current just got too strong,'' said Bob Jones, a spokesman for
the Kansas City Police Department.
   More than 3{ inches of rain fell in the Kansas City area late
Friday.
   The cities of Parkville, Claycomo and Liberty in suburban Kansas
City reported minor street flooding, and officials evacuated a day
care center in Riverside.
   In Lincoln, Neb., more than an inch of rain fell in 25 minutes,
and the Topeka, Kan., area received nearly 5 inches of rain on
Friday, the National Weather Service said.
   Large hail fell in Kansas near Concordia, Washington and
Fairmount.
   Two tornadoes also were reported in the state. Fort Riley
military police said a tornado touched down about 7:20 p.m. at the
army base in open range land in Riley County, and another funnel
cloud was reported in Kingman at 8:20 p.m., about 30 miles west of
Wichita, officials said. No damage or injuries were reported.
   A third tornado touched down near Thurman, Iowa, and thunderstorm
winds gusted to 60 mph at Wichita, Kan., and Douglas, Kan.
   The weather service's regional forecast today called for showers
and thunderstorms with a chance of heavy rains.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Cause Injuries, Evacuation; Heat Abates in Some
Regions</HEAD>

   Thunderstorms continued this morning in various parts of the
nation after forcing 50 people to evacuate a motel and injuring 14
people at a circus tent.
   Meanwhile, areas that have been scorched by record heat could
look forward to some relief today, forecasters said.
   In Branson, Mo., a storm tore the roof off the Music Country
Motor Inn, blowing it into the parking lot of a country music show.
One person suffered minor injuries and several cars were damaged,
police said. The American Red Cross helped the people displaced
from the motel find new lodging.
   Authorities in Lavallette, N.J., said a 30-foot-high circus tent
was mostly empty Wednesday night when a furious thunderstorm with
high winds knocked it down, slightly injuring 14 people. The tent
over Vidbel's Old Tyme Circus of Wyndham, N.Y., collapsed minutes
after Wednesday night's first show ended, and after patrons had
been advised to leave early.
   A heat wave departed Ohio after delivering a final blast of
scorching temperatures that set records across the state, prompting
unprecedented use of electricity.
   And with forecasters predicting a cold front, Illinois residents
looked today for some respite from the scalding summer heat that
brought record triple-digit temperatures to most of the state.
   A storm that stalled over Denver dumped up to 2 inches of rain
Wednesday, flooding Interstate 25 with two feet of standing water
that closed the highway at rush hour.
   In Michigan, severe thunderstorms produced large hail and
damaging winds. Gusts up to 65 mph at Mount Pleasant downed many
trees and severely damaged three homes, and a thunderstorm at
Webberville knocked trees onto parked cars.
   Thunderstorms extended from southeastern Wisconsin across lower
Michigan into northern Ohio early this morning, and widely
scattered showers and thunderstorms continued across the southern
and central Plains. A few storms also developed in South Dakota.
   Showers also were widely scattered in Washington state, northern
Idaho and northwestern Montana. A few showers and thunderstorms
also lingered over Arizona and New Mexico.
   Cloudy skies prevailed to the north of a cold front in the
north-central United States, while the South and West enjoyed fair
skies.
   The nation's high Wednesday was 114 degrees at Borrego Springs
and Palm Springs, Calif., and Laughlin, Nev.
   Today's forecast called for cooler temperatures through the
Middle Atlantic states and the lower Ohio Valley. Showers and
thunderstorms were expected from the mid-Atlantic Coast through the
lower Ohio Valley into eastern Iowa and southern Wisconsin, and
from the central Rockies through the central Plains, Arkansas,
eastern and southern Texas and the Gulf Coast region into Florida.
   Highs should be in the 80s or 90s across much of the nation;
near 100 in the Tennessee Valley; in the 70s along the Pacific
Coast into the Pacific Northwest, and from the upper Mississippi
Valley through the Great Lakes region into New England; in the
upper 60s in northeast Minnesota and northern Maine; and 110 from
the desert Southwest into the California valleys.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 46 at Yellowstone Park,
Wyo., to 95 at Phoenix.

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Rip Though Central United States</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 18 grafs to UPDATE with lightning death, new info
on Tropical Storm Beryl, picking up 12th graf pvs, `Today's
forecast ....'

   Fierce thunderstorms ranged from Michigan to Kansas today after
much of the central United States was belted by storms bringing
large hail, drenching rains and winds that blew out windows and
leveled trees and power poles.
   Lightning killed a teen-age girl and critically injured her
friend at a Racine, Wis., park.
   In the South, Tropical Storm Beryl moved across New Orleans
today, prompting the National Weather Service to alert 16 coastal
parishes for possibly heavy rains.
   Strong storms ripped through northeast Kansas and northern
Missouri early today but the intensity of many storms began to fade
in early morning.
   In southern Wisconsin, high winds toppled trees across Highway
24 at Muskego, while in Vernon, winds gusted to 60 mph. Streets in
Lake Geneva were flooded by the torrential rain, and at least one
funnel cloud was sighted.
   Strong thunderstorm winds also scattered trees at Roscoe and
Rockton, Ill., as well as in Plainview, Donahue and Walcott, Iowa.
Power poles fell in high winds at West Liberty, Iowa.
   In Kansas City, Mo., strong winds brought down trees and blew
out windows.
   Hershey, Neb., was blasted by winds up to 60 mph and hail the
size of golf balls.
   The storms also brought a deluge of rain. More than 2 inches
fell at Kearney, Mo., and Madrid, Kan.
   In Chicago, rain forced officials to cut short the Cubs' first
night baseball game at Wrigley Field.
   ``This is typical,'' said one disgruntled fan. ``It doesn't rain
all summer long, and then on the first night game ever, it has to
rain.''
   In Racine, witnesses told police that a lightning bolt hit a
tree at Lincoln Park, then apparently traveled through the ground
and struck the two girls Monday afternoon.
   Karla Kay Hedding, 17, died immediately, said Thomas Cloyd,
assistant Racine County medical examiner. Her friend, who was not
identified, was listed in critical condition at Milwaukee County
Medical Complex.
   As Beryl, the Atlantic hurricane season's second named storm,
moved over New Orleans, forecasters said its movement raised hopes
that it might dissipate.
   Earlier, several coastal communities were evacuated as the
storm, which has already forced thousands of oil workers from their
offshore rigs, intensified off the Louisiana-Mississippi Gulf Coast.
   At 8 a.m. EDT today, the Beryl's center was just northwest of
New Orleans at latitude 30.2 north and longitude 90.3 west. Highest
sustained winds were 50 mph.
   Warnings were in effect from Morgan City, La., to Pensacola, Fla.
   Thunderstorms spawned by Beryl poured heavy rain along the Gulf
Coast from southeast Louisiana to Mobile, Ala. Biloxi, Miss.,
received more than 3 inches of rain early today.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
Florida and southern Georgia across southern Louisiana; numerous
thunderstorms from northwest Florida to western Louisiana from
Tropical Storm Beryl; scattered showers and thunderstorms through
lower Michigan, southeast Wisconsin, northern Indiana, Illinois,
much of Missouri, Kansas, northern Vermont to northern Maine; and
fair weather throughout the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were forecast in the 70s over Upper Michigan,
northwest Washington and parts of the California coast; in the 90s
or higher from southern New England to Florida, from the Ohio
Valley across to the central Gulf of Mexico coast, over the lower
half of the Mississippi Valley, through eastern Montana, through
the central Pacific coast and the Great Basin, between 100 degrees
and 105 degrees over Oklahoma, central Texas and across the desert
Southwest; in the 80s through the rest of the nation.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 44
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 92 degrees at
Phoenix, Ariz..
