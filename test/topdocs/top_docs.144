The English novelist Aldous Huxley, accompanied by his wife, Maria, arrived in 
America in 1937 to spend a few months lecturing on pacifism, a "lost cause" 
subject that had gripped Huxley's interest in the few years preceding World War 
II. The Huxleys found the United States endlessly fascinating. It was the 
outbreak of the war in Europe, however, that kept them from returning home. The 
short stay originally planned by the Huxleys became a permanent relocation. 
</P>
<P>
Huxley spent the last 25 years of his life in and around Hollywood, writing, 
while there, a number of screenplays for films that have become classics, like 
"Pride and Prejudice" and "Jane Eyre." He also wrote two novels that were 
highly regarded in their day, "After Many a Summer Dies the Swan" and "Time 
Must Have a Stop." He also wrote a book that became influential in the 1950s 
and '60s, "The Doors of Perception," Huxley's account of his own experiences 
with hallucinogenic drugs. His circle of friends in Hollywood included a 
remarkable number of the interesting people then in residence: Charlie Chaplin, 
Igor Stravinsky, Christopher Isherwood, Greta Garbo, Bertolt Brecht, Anita 
Loos. 
</P>
<P>
In "Huxley in Hollywood," David King Dunnaway has written an account of these 
American years. As his publisher notes, Dunnaway has written two distinct 
books: One is the story of Huxley's intellectual and personal life in 
California. In the second, running as a sort of counterpoint to his 
biographical narrative, Dunnaway has filled up many of his nearly 500 pages 
with brief sketches of the lives and careers of the many new friends Huxley 
made in Hollywood. In the long run, these background interruptions to the main 
story become tedious and add little to our knowledge of Huxley. 
</P>
<P>
Although very nearly blind, the Huxley who began living in California in 1938 
struck many as a truly awesome figure. At 6 feet 4, he was a walking and 
talking tower of knowledge on every conceivable subject. His awareness of 
things was aided by his reading and rereading, from cover to cover, the 11th 
edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, for which he had luggage specially 
constructed for his endless travels in the 1920s and '30s. In America, Huxley 
turned more and more to mysticism, and it was perhaps to be expected that in 
time he would turn his attention to the newly discovered hallucinogenic drugs. 
He tried them all: mescaline, psiloxbin and, finally, LSD. This combination of 
mysticism and drug-taking led to his writing "The Doors of Perception," his 
little book that, in a sense, legitimized for some the taking of these 
mind-altering drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Huxley made no bones about why he took these drugs when he said that "It's a 
very salutary thing to realize that the rather dull universe in which most of 
us spend most of our time is not the only universe there is." In short, Huxley 
eventually found the real world to be lacking in the phantasmagoric images he 
encountered in his drug trips. It is fair to ask that if Huxley had possessed 
normal vision, would he have preferred this inner world? 
</P>
<P>
It seems that Huxley's ever-growing preoccupation with the state of mind 
produced by the drugs resulted in the steady deterioration of his novelistic 
talent. It became harder and harder for him to express himself meaningfully in 
fictional terms about all the vital issues -- nuclear warfare, environmental 
pollution -- that threatened the lives of his fellows. His last two novels, 
"Ape and Essence" and "Island," suffer badly from the fierce intrusion of the 
essayist into the realm of the storyteller, a strategy that he had been able to 
handle brilliantly in the 1932 "Brave New World." 
</P>
<P>
There is little doubt that Huxley's reputation has faded: The current trading 
value of his stock on the literary exchange is not very high. Except for his 
novel of the future, "Brave New World," which has become a staple in the 
American high school curriculum, few of his nearly 60 books are read much any 
more. When he came to America in 1937, Huxley was perhaps the best known among 
the serious English novelists of his generation. His books were international 
best-sellers, but they were thought to be distinguished contributions to modern 
English literature. However, even before his death in 1963 (the same day as 
John F. Kennedy), Huxley's fame had been eroded sufficiently to make it clear 
that there were at least three of his contemporaries who had displaced him in 
the critical canon: His old friend D. H. Lawrence, James Joyce and Virginia 
Woolf. 
</P>
<P>
Except in a single area, Dunnaway's account does not differ significantly from 
the long and excellent life of Huxley written in 1973 by his close friend the 
English novelist Sybille Bedford. Although Dunnaway has interviewed many of 
Huxley's friends, the Bedford Life presents us with a far more sympathetic, 
warmer Huxley. Indeed, the Huxley in Bedford's book emerges as a much more 
confused man than does the one in Dunnaway's pages. 
</P>
<P>
There is not much that is new here about the famous people that Huxley knew in 
these years. Shockingly, none of them emerge very clearly in the reader's mind 
unless one has read about them elsewhere. Even Garbo and Brecht remain 
perfectly faceless and voiceless. 
</P>
<P>
Dunnaway attempts to make much of Maria Huxley's lesbianism, almost the only 
area in which he offers fresh material. Drawing largely from her letters to her 
family in Belgium and France, as well as from the testimony of friends, 
Dunnaway reveals that Maria conducted a number of affairs with various members 
of the film community. While it has long been known that Maria functioned as 
the principal go-between in arranging her husband's many affairs, Dunnaway 
believes that Maria's sexual nature had much to do with her presumed 
indifference to his marital infidelities. My set of the advance proofs of 
"Huxley in Hollywood" contains many passages concerning Maria's lovers expunged 
by Dunnaway's publishers for, presumably, legal reasons. No such censoring was 
required, however, for the names of the women in Aldous' life. Dunnaway was 
not, apparently, able to obtain them. As for Maria's love life, these 
revelations are mildly interesting, but fail to tell us much about Huxley or 
what he thought about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Huxley in Hollywood" is marred by factual errors: Bertolt Brecht was not at 
any time married to Salka Viertal; Howard Hawks' film "Sergeant York" is not 
"an anti-Nazi blockbuster" but is about an American pacifist in World War I; 
the Kurt Weill and Paul Green play "Johnny Johnson" is a work of 1936, not 1939 
as Dunnaway would have you infer from his text. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the endless potted-history passages that clog the narrative, the 
book is weakened by the carelessness of the writing style. Even by planting the 
idea in David Selznick's mind, it would appear insane to describe Huxley's 
participation in the writing of the "Jane Eyre" script in these terms: "While 
not Bronte's sort of novelist, he spoke like an English don." One short example 
of stylistic banality will suffice: 
</P>
<P>
"He and Maria were soon steering across the Atlantic toward the remains of 
their former lives: What had become of their villa at Sanary? Of Juliette and 
Maria's sisters? They sailed on a Cunard liner."

THE HIDDEN HUXLEY: CONTEMPT AND COMPASSION FOR THE MASSES edited by David
Bradshaw Faber and Faber Pounds 17.50, 255 pages
As the pieces re-printed in The Hidden Huxley make clear, Aldous Huxley was
a push-over for a great many crackpot ideas as well as sensible ones. His
genius was to absorb abstruse ideas and to promote them as ironic paradoxes.
David Bradshaw, who is working on a fresh life of the author, causes us to
ask whose side Huxley was really on in his celebrated anti-utopian fantasy,
Brave New World (1932).
Bradshaw points to Huxley's hitherto neglected admiration for the work of
the American journalist HL Mencken, the co-editor of The Smart Set
periodical, 'the most celebrated adversary of mass-democracy in the
English-speaking world'. Huxley gave laudatory coverage to Mencken's book
Prejudices in the Athenaeum arts and literary weekly and sent Mencken his
novel Crome Yellow, which was duly praised for its masterly irony.
Bradshaw shows Huxley approvingly echoing Mencken's division of society into
an elite of ability and the toiling masses and finds Huxley similarly
welcoming HG Wells's world-order headed by a ruling caste of Samurai.
Bradshaw also quotes from Huxley's Athenaeum column and reprints his later
pre-second war journalism in support of philosophers such as Pareto, who
contributed significantly to the ideology of fascism.
In later life Huxley found his guru in that enigmatic character Gerald
Heard, with whom he was in contact when he moved from Europe to California
in 1937. Heard appears as the mystic Propter in Huxley's novel After Many a
Summer (1939). Time Must Have a Stop (1944), set in pre-war London and
Florence, preached asceticism and showed the direction in which Huxley's
thought had moved, as did his study of consensus among the religions of
mankind, The Perennial Philosophy (1946).
His Doors of Perception (1954) describing his experience with the drug
mescalin, became a bible of the Beat Generation. He also turned at this time
to history, in studies like The Devils of Loudon (1952), where he found
object-lessons for the madnesses of the present in the past.
One of his greatest gifts was for conversation. In a live recording made in
1961, Personally Speaking, he talks uninhibitedly about writing as a career,
Freud, DH Lawrence, drug-taking, mysticism - all his pet hobby-horses.
The voice is an upper-class sing-song in which every syllable is clearly
enunciated rising in a crescendo as his conclusions are rammed home. He
argues, for example, that advances in the arts often come about in an
inexplicable and unprecedented manner rather than as a response to
historical circumstances. 'Out of the blue' he said, 'Chaucer developed
individual psychology . . . art has its own internal logic'. In his own
case, however, his art - quasi-mysticism apart - was highly dependent upon
events in the external world.

<TEXT>
Never have I felt so glad to return to London as I did last weekend. Good
old England; praise God for Naffshire. How snug things seemed. Comforting.
Familiar. A government of tired incompetents lecturing an electorate of
(mainly) idiots on how to comport themselves. Another Tory scandal.
Decrepitude. Banality.
I am a surprisingly simple soul: always highly amiable, a boon in office or
home. But I was in such a depressed state when I returned from Delhi last
weekend that I almost fell to the ground at Heathrow and kissed Naffshire's
sod, so pleased was I to be back.
I had not been to India before. I was there only briefly. But I was outraged
by what I saw - filth, pollution and poverty on a scale hard to stomach;
people milling wretchedly; the degradation of humanity on an eye-popping
scale.
I had to keep rubbing my eyes, for India seemed a parody of a country, so
unreal, so far off-course, that I felt I had strayed into a time-kink from
the middle of the next century, when population pressures will be exacting a
dreadful price for our inability to control our breeding.
By coincidence I was reading, while in Delhi, Aldous Huxley's Brave New
World Revisited. It was published in 1959, as Huxley's second opinion on the
phantasmagoric prophesies contained in his novel, Brave New World, written
in 1931.
I would guess that for every 1,000 who have read Brave New World, only a
handful have read Brave New World Revisited. You should try it, especially
if you have just handed a small boy, only five or six years old, one of
India's Untouchables, a few rupees in a Delhi street and have watched his
scabbed little face light up with a smile of disbelief.
Huxley was much exercised by over-population. This was not the space age but
the age of over-population. In the Brave New World of his fable, he wrote,
the problem of human numbers in relation to natural resources had been
effectively solved. But in the real world the problem was 'becoming graver
and more formidable with every passing year. It is against this grim
biological background that all the political, economic, cultural and
psychological dramas of our time are being played out.'
That quote is from the first chapter of Brave New World Revisited. It is in
the second chapter that Huxley really let rip, and he did so by venturing
into areas that are simply not discussed today.
In his Brave New World, he said, eugenics and dysgenics were practised
systematically: Betas, Alphas and even Alpha-pluses out of one set of
laboratory bottles; biologically inferior, almost sub-human, creatures from
another set.
In the real world, we did nothing systematic about our breeding. 'But in our
random and unregulated way we are not only over-populating our planet, we
are also, it would seem, making sure that these greater numbers shall be of
biologically poorer quality . . . Under the conditions now prevailing, every
advance in medicine will tend to be offset by a corresponding advance in the
survival rates of individuals cursed by some genetic insufficiency.'
Result: no improvement, or perhaps a deterioration, in average health
standards, and perhaps a decline in average intelligence. Going further,
Huxley quoted a Dr WH Sheldon as claiming that it was 'the fashion in some
academic circles to assure students that the alarm over differential
birth-rates is unfounded; that these problems are merely economic, or merely
educational, or merely religious, or merely cultural or something . . . This
is Pollyanna optimism. Reproductive delinquency is biological and basic.'
What chilled me especially as I stared through the windows of my tourist
coach in Delhi was Huxley's conclusion. 'What,' he asked, 'about the
congenitally insufficient organisms, whom our medicine and our social
services now preserve so that they may propagate their kind? . . . the
wholesale transmission to our descendants of the results of unfavourable
mutations, and the progressive contamination of the genetic pool from which
members of our species will have to draw, (is) obviously bad.'
Huxley didn't have any answers. But at least he asked the questions. Where
have those questions gone? Why have they been purged? Why the great silence?
I believe I know the answer. I think we have grown afraid. The thing that is
frightening us most is the sight of our own teeming shadows.

   BY DEFINITION, science fiction isn't obliged to reflect
reality. Not today's, not tomorrow's.
   That said, it's still fun to hold the futurists to
account. The following are seven images of high technology in
the home, dreamed up by some of history's notable visionaries
-- and seven reports on how accurate those images have turned
out to be. The main lesson, probably, is that guesses about
the direction of technology (yes, including those made in
this publication) shouldn't be taken too seriously. As George
Orwell would be happy to learn, the only certainty about
prophecies is that they often miss the mark.

   1516: Thomas More "Utopia"
                                                                                                       

   The roofs be plain and flat, covered with a certain kind
of plaster that is of no cost, and yet so tempered that no
fire can hurt or perish it. . . .They keep the wind out of
their windows with glass, for it is there much used, and
somewhere also with fine linen cloth dipped in oil or amber .
. .
                                                                                                       

   Although it isn't set in the future, Thomas More's seminal
book is an early form of futurism. Following his era's
literary conventions, More simply places his futuristic
society on a faraway island rather than in another time.
   Although the book is mainly a political treatise, some of
the technological features of Utopian houses remain
interesting today. Utopia's fireproof plaster, for example,
might draw emissaries from the construction industry. And
glass windows have yet to be improved upon, although some
companies are now experimenting with windows that can be made
opaque -- and perhaps, in the future, made to display video
pictures -- at the touch of a button.

   1888: Edward Bellamy, "Looking Backward"
                                                                                                       

   She made me sit down comfortably, and, crossing the room,
so far as I could see, merely touched one or two screws, and
at once the room was filled with the music of a grand organ
anthem. . . ."Grand]" I cried, as the last great wave of
sound broke and ebbed away into silence. "Bach must be at the
keys of that organ; but where is the organ?"
                                                                                                       

   Edward Bellamy's hugely popular romance, in which the hero
awakes from a mesmeric sleep to find himself in the year
2000, predicts several technological advances -- although, as
with More, the author's main point is a political one.
Bellamy typified the utopianism of the late 19th century,
which embraced technology as a way to increase human
happiness.
   The Music Room described above is a prescient vision of
radio. Bellamy didn't foresee "wireless" broadcasting, but
imagined that live performances would be transmitted through
special telephone lines to subscribers. In other words, cable
radio. A cable system is now being tested in the U.S. for
high-quality digital audio transmissions, and some
cable-television companies -- especially those in Europe --
tout interference-free reception of regular radio stations.
   Egregiously, Bellamy makes no mention of recorded music,
even though Thomas Edison's phonograph was 10 years old at
the time. He can be forgiven, however, for failing to predict
the latest stereo components -- digital sound processors that
allow listeners to "reshape" their living room's acoustics to
mimic much larger spaces. If Bellamy had only known, his hero
would have been mystified not only by organ music but also by
cavernous echoes that seemed to issue from 100 yards behind
his sofa.
                                                                                                       

   1902: H.G. Wells, "Anticipations of the Reaction of
Mechanical and Scientific Progress Upon Human Life and
Thought"
                                                                                                       

   One always imagines a cook working with a crimsoned face
and bare, blackened arms. But with a neat little range,
heated by electricity and provided with thermometers, with
absolutely controllable temperatures and proper heat screens,
cooking might very easily be made a pleasant amusement for
intelligent invalid ladies.
                                                                                                       

   In addition to writing some of the first true science
fiction, H.G. Wells was also the dean of all futurism. Among
other things, he correctly predicted the growth of suburbia
and the atom bomb. In his "Anticipations," which started as a
series of articles envisioning life at the end of the
century, Wells anticipates the transformation of the era's
dark, sooty kitchens to bright, clean rooms where even the
idle rich experiment with recipes. Clearly, he wouldn't have
been surprised to find that many cookery books became best
sellers by the close of the millennium.
   But even the gadget-happy Wells never hinted at many of
the myriad devices that populate today's kitchens -- talking
refrigerators, fuzzy-logic bread makers, dishwashers with
brains as powerful as early computers. Especially puzzling
would be the microwave oven, a truly new technology that has
become so commonplace and easy to use that companies now sell
microwavable snacks that little kids can nuke for themselves.
                                                                                                       

   1932: Aldous Huxley, "Brave New World"
                                                                                                       

   A blast of warm air dusted her with the finest talcum
powder. Eight different scents and eau-de-Cologne were laid
on in little taps over the wash-basin. She turned on the
third from the left, dabbed herself with chypre and, carrying
her shoes and stockings in her hand, went out to see if one
of the vibro-vacuum machines were free.
                                                                                                       

   Futurism turned pessimistic after the Great War, and
technological progress began to be feared because of its
potential for abuse -- a more sophisticated fear than the
visceral Luddism of previous eras. To dramatize such fears,
dystopian literature flourished and reached an apotheosis of
sorts in Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," which depicted an
ominous society of genetic manipulation and drug-hazed
consumerism.
   Like the rest of the book, Huxley's vision of home
technology depended heavily on sensuality. In the home, the
decadent tone of his other inventions -- scent organs,
synthetic music, and feelies (movies where the audience
actually "felt" the action) -- had its most natural
expression in the bathroom, to which his characters retreated
as regularly as cocaine addicts. But strangely, apart from
the still-rare Jacuzzi, technology has had little to say
about the bathroom since the advent of indoor plumbing.
   Innovation seems to entail putting more nozzles in a
shower stall or heating toilet seats. Despite an emerging
Japanese interest in the electronic bathroom, the only widely
used modern items that echo Huxley's lush vision -- apart
from potpourri, which continues to exert its low-tech charm
-- are cheesy gadgets such as electric back-massagers and
"aroma disks" that play on mail-order scent diffusers.
                                                                                                       

   1949: George Orwell, "1984"
                                                                                                       

   "Smith]" screamed the shrewish voice from the telescreen.
"6079 Smith W] Yes, you] Bend lower, please] You can do
better than that. You're not trying. Lower, please] That's
better, comrade."
                                                                                                       

   Anyone who sweats regularly through a Jane Fonda workout
tape will cringe at George Orwell's dark vision of "Physical
Jerks," daily exercises coordinated and enforced through
telescreens, the two-way video screens that monitor the dingy
lives of the citizens of Oceania. Fortunately, two-way
screens linked to the government aren't yet standard issue in
our homes -- though it could be argued that the spirit of Big
Brother lurks now in ordinary devices such as pagers, credit
cards and cellular telephones.
   Inside the home, two-way communication has never really
caught on. Household intercom systems flared and died years
ago and, while many cordless telephones now double as in-home
pagers, most parents are probably relieved to have the kids
out of mind. In a corporate experiment that may someday reach
the home, a Xerox Corp. lab is now testing a system of
two-way video screens that allows workers to "enter" another
office for a chat -- or stay tuned in all day, just like a
telescreen. Unlike Big Brother's screens, however, these
monitors can be switched off.
                                                                                                       

   1952: Ray Bradbury, "The Veldt"
                                                                                                       

   Perhaps Lydia was right. Perhaps they needed a little
vacation from the fantasy which was growing a bit too real
for ten-year-old children. . . .It seemed that, at a
distance, for the past month, he had heard lions roaring, and
smelled their strong odor seeping as far away as his study
door. But, being busy, he had paid it no attention.
                                                                                                       

   In Ray Bradbury's chilling tale of consumerism, the Hadley
family falls victim to the ultimate in home technology: The
Happylife Home, "which clothed and fed and rocked them to
sleep and played and sang and was good to them." Central to
the story is a nursery whose walls can create convincing
illusions of reality, complete with sounds and smells -- an
immersion experience akin to Huxley's feelies. Things go
awry, however, when the spoiled Hadley children ask the
nursery to conjure up an African scene.
   Much of the Happylife Home is deliberately cartoonish (the
dining-room table cuts food into bite-size pieces, for
instance), but Bradbury's nursery can be seen as the ultimate
in a new technology called virtual reality. In virtual
reality, people don goggles, gloves and other devices that
let them feel as if they're moving in, and interacting with,
a computer-generated world. Bradbury takes it one step
further and creates a world so enveloping that no gloves or
goggles are needed: The viewer is swallowed up by the
illusion.
   Research into virtual reality is being conducted now at
firms such as VPL Research Inc., but early consumer devices
have already emerged. For the home, Mattel Inc. makes a gizmo
called PowerGlove, which lets kids control Nintendo video
games with hand gestures. It's a long way from the Happylife
nursery -- but maybe that's not such a bad thing.
                                                                                                       

   1968: Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick, "2001: A Space
Odyssey"
                                                                                                       

   "Are you coming to my party tomorrow?"
   "I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't."
   "Why not?"
   "Well, you know -- Daddy's traveling."
                                                                                                       

   Daddy, of course, is calling home from a Bell PicturePhone
while en route to the moon -- and paying a mere $1.70 for the
privilege. Video telephones, first demonstrated in the early
1960s, are perhaps futurists' biggest flub so far: The
reasonable rates in "2001" notwithstanding, they have always
cost too much to catch on. Even in the corporate world, where
video teleconferences were supposed to be a cheap alternative
to air travel, it wasn't until earlier this year that a firm,
PictureTel, started selling a complete system for less than
$20,000.
   Part of the problem is infrastructure: Conventional
telephone lines don't have the capacity to transmit moving
pictures, meaning that exotic means such as satellites or
special lines must be used. Since it will be a decade or more
before high-capacity, fiber-optic cables are commonplace,
video phones won't become a household appliance for a long
time. In the meantime, Japanese consumer-electronics firms
have been offering phones that can transmit still images;
they've met with an understandably tepid response. Similarly,
other relatively modest prophecies of "2001" -- a permanent
space station, for example -- are years behind schedule. The
human-seeming HAL 9000 computer, of course, is only slightly
closer to reality than he was when Arthur C. Clarke dreamed
him up.
   Still, one piece of "2001" technology has already made it
into many homes: a computer that can wallop most humans at
chess. It may not seem like much compared with HAL, who was
supposedly completed in 1992 to be "foolproof and incapable
of error." But then again, HAL ultimately snapped and turned
homicidal. Some prophecies are best left unfulfilled.

PARADISE DREAMED
by Pamela Neville-Sington and David Sington
Bloomsbury Pounds 18.99, 322 pages
I HAVE for years been fascinated by the Freelanders. Almost certainly you
have never heard of them, and they do not rate any reference in this
wide-ranging book about utopias. The 'International Freeland Association'
flourished briefly in the early 1890s, inspired by a moderately-nutty
Austrian economist called Theodor Herzka who preached the abolition of
interest rates and property rights. He sent a pioneer party of his European
followers to East Africa in 1894 to found 'Freeland' on the slopes of Mount
Kenya. The utter failure of this expedition is interesting partly because it
helped persuade the Zionists to turn down the British government's offer of
a territory for 'Israel' in Uganda. It also offers a comment on the fatal
attraction for utopianists of the reality of their dreams.
The Freelanders were just one excellent example (there must have been
hundreds of other such groups over the years), of humanity's chronic search
for utopia, and their story would have usefully illustrated the themes of
Paradise Dreamed. That is to say, they were inspired by the vision of a
single man; they followed a blueprint which had been laid down in extreme
and imaginative detail, however optimistic; they paid particular attention
to their proposed constitution; and they were the extremest of radicals in
that they were emigrants setting sail not to seek their fortune in a
transplanted Europe in the Americas or the Antipodes (as so many did at that
period) but precisely to get away from the system which they had learned to
reject.
More than that - more than the Singtons seem to admit - they were true
utopians in that they were motivated by a despair for their natal society.
This despair is surely a central element to utopianism, from Thomas More to
Aldous Huxley's critique in Brave New World. William Morris, for example,
only wrote News from Nowhere after he had lost faith in his Socialist
movement. I like to think of the Freelanders as some of the first drop-outs
of our modern age.
Pamela and David Sington have produced a helpful survey of utopian thinking,
starting from Hesiod's Golden Age but concentrating on the years since the
Renaissance. This does not pretend to be a work of original thought, and it
often reads too much like a BBC series (as it originally was, for the World
Service), fashioned into a neatly-assembled round-dozen of chapters and
including too many trim one-para summaries of this or that. But the book
serves a purpose: I don't know of a more accessible introduction to the
subject.
Inevitably, we have to be taken through the sources: Plato, Aristotle, More
('one of the founding documents of the modern world'), Campanella, Ledoux,
Bacon, Fourier, Saint-Simon, Diderot and Sade, Edward Bellamy (very keen on
Bellamy - he predicted credit cards), Morris and BF Skinner, and so on and
so forth. And Hawthorne, with this wonderful description of his own Utopia:
he 'has ventured to make free with his old and affectionately remembered
home at Brook Farm as being certainly the most romantic episode of his own
life - essentially a daydream, and yet a fact - and thus offering an
available foothold between fiction and reality'. There you have the creative
tensions in utopianism: daydream/fact, fiction/reality.
The chapters never quite focus on a sustained theme - perhaps that is left
to us. 'Utopias have succeeded in changing the world'. Well, yes, up to a
point. Both the US and the Soviet Union have been inspired by different
versions of utopia, we are told: that is a leading meaning of the 'pursuit
of happiness', and Andre Gide once described the USSR as 'a land where I
imagined Utopia was in process of becoming reality'. But there were deep
distinctions between the European and the American utopian traditions:
crudely put, the European line led from More to Rousseau to Marx and
emphasised the equal distribution of economic resources; the American came
to emphasise 'equality of condition' and therefore 'equality of opportunity'
in which individualism would easily lead on to entrepreneurial capitalism.
Marx may once have observed, of utopias, that 'the man who dreams up a
programme for the future is a reactionary', but that hardly denies him his
place in the utopian galaxy, although his visions were untypically vague and
short on detail.
We are assured by the authors that utopias are frequently realised, if only
in part, and that utopias have been among our principal philosophical and
political guidelines for 500 years. That seems too bold. Some utopias made
sense, others did not; like acorns dropping in profusion, only a tiny
fraction have ever taken root. Coleridge's 'Pantisocracy' came to nothing;
the Freelanders survived only three months in the real Africa of 1894.
Perhaps it would be good to read a more impassioned study. Whose side are we
on, Miranda or Prospero? ''O brave new world/ That has such people in it' -
'Tis new to thee.'' Discuss.

LISTENING TO PROZAC by Peter D Kramer Fourth Estate Pounds 16, 409 pages
Prozac is a drug which, with few side-effects, transforms depressed or
anxious people, or those with low self-esteem or poor social skills, into
confident, quicker-thinking, more assertive and less inhibited achievers. It
is, in short, a 'psychopharmacological cosmetic', a safe chemical
personality enhancer; and it is raising a storm of debate.
Peter Kramer is a psychiatrist and one of Prozac's earliest prescribers and
most eloquent defenders. In this fascinating and sometimes disturbing book
he explores the dramatic questions it prompts about mind, selfhood and
ethics.
The real significance of Prozac lies not so much in its mind-brightening
effects as its safety. Other psychotherapeutic drugs carry risks. In
promising nearly costless relief from psychological problems - and not mere
relief, but enhancement - Prozac opens new possibilities. Is Prozac the
miracle drug that can make life easier and more successful for all?
The ethical dilemmas thus prompted come attached, as Kramer fascinatingly
shows, to other questions. The efficacy of psychotropic drugs suggests that
the argument between those who think of mind as a wholly physical entity,
and those who think it cannot be explained solely in such terms, is being
handsomely won by the former.
Among many other things, the success of the biological view suggests that
all mental illness reflects brain damage. Kramer argues that such damage,
whether caused by genetic factors or trauma, might be degenerative, so that
a present mild depression might augur major illness later in life; and that
chemical treatment of early signs is important.
Should anyone have Prozac who wants it? In effect Kramer says yes. His
answer is characteristically American. The stereotypical American assumes
that he has a right to a happy, feel-good life. If he has less he feels
short-changed. To be worried, or hesitant in speech, or shy; to feel tired,
or downhearted; to to have few friends, to be single; all this is failure.
Prozac solves the problem. One safe and simple pill a day, and where a wimp
entered the telephone box, superman flies out.
What is wrong with that? Nothing, except that to erase one's anxiety and
sense of struggle is to dull one's contact with reality, to forego the
possibility of emotional growth, to lessen one's ability to cope with major
grief when it comes, to be less sensitive to oneself and others, to reduce
one's autonomy by putting a chemical compound in the place of the
personality forged by experience and endeavour and to make one's creativity
less fully one's own.
To such points Kramer replies that Prozac simply gives people what they
would have had if they had enjoyed a 'more benign childhood' and other early
advantages. But this precisely exposes the flaw in the pro-Prozac case. You
have to make a large value judgment about what life 'should' be like, and
about our model of what a successful, flourishing person is, before you can
claim that Prozac provides it. Is the American feel-good model the highest
ideal of human existence?
If autonomy, endeavour, and full contact with the world and other people do
not much matter, there seems to be no barrier to following Aldous Huxley's
Brave New World suggestion, and adding Prozac to the water supply. Kramer
stops short of suggesting as much; but in coming close, he gives us an
absorbing insight into scientific and psychological questions that we
urgently need to resolve.

California Senate Bill 813, enacted in 1983, asks that the content of 
secondary-school courses stimulate an improvement in the effort and performance 
of students nationwide. Thus spurred, the State Board of Education adopted 
school curriculums (developed by the superintendent of public instruction) with 
literary works of "compelling, intellectual, social or moral content," whose 
example by way of excellent use of language would encourage writing and 
discussion. 
</P>
<P>
Individual choices are made by Orange County school district committees, taking 
into account the perceived needs and abilities of their students. The Santa Ana 
Unified School District has a short core list of requirements for teachers to 
choose from (for example, one epic or one play among two or three). Extended 
readings are made at teachers' discretion: English is a second language for a 
large percentage of students. 
</P>
<P>
The Huntington Beach Union High School District, at the other end of the 
spectrum, offers four tracks from grades 10 to 12: Honors, College Prep, 
Readings List and Fundamental. 
</P>
<P>
In the Capistrano Unified School District, junior and senior years don't share 
a central curriculum: Students may choose from a variety of electives to 
fulfill the necessary credits. The lists below only include English, American 
and world literature classes; other elective classes offer such topics as sea 
literature, sports literature and science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
The lists compiled here began as lists of novels. However, because plays are 
not distinguished from novels within the core list in the Santa Ana and 
Capistrano school districts, drama has been added into other school district 
lists for the sake of consistency.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor and announcer Vic Perrin, who provided
the spooky voice that told viewers of ``The Outer Limits'' TV show
that their sets had just been taken over by mysterious forces, has
died of cancer. He was 73.
   Perrin, who died Tuesday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, was
known to millions in the 1960s for saying at the beginning of each
``Outer Limits'' show: ``There is nothing wrong with your television
set. ... Do not attempt to adjust the picture. ... We are
controlling transmission.''
   He would come on again at the show's conclusion to ``return
control'' of the set to the viewer and leave the audience with a
moral for that week's episode of the science fiction anthology
series.
   Perrin, born in Menomonee Falls, Wis., graduated from the
University of Wisconsin before moving West in 1940. In Hollywood, he
embarked on a career in radio that was to make his voice, if not his
face or name, known to millions.
   His worked as a radio announcer for both ABC and NBC and was a
regular on such shows as the radio version of ``Gunsmoke,'' ``One
Man's Family,'' ``Fort Laramie'' and ``Yours Truly Johnny Dollar.''
   In 1956, Perrin joined ``The CBS Radio Workshop'' a short-lived
but critically praised series that broadcast experimental dramas and
classics, including a narration by Aldous Huxley of his ``Brave New
World.''
   Later, Perrin appeared regularly on such TV shows as ``Dragnet,''
``Mission Impossible,'' ``Gunsmoke,'' ``Star Trek,'' ``Big Valley''
and ``Maverick.''
   He also was the announcer on several commercials, but refused to
go before the cameras to sell products, saying that ``if they see me
in a commercial, they can't believe me as an actor.''
   Perrin's voice can still be heard on reruns of ``The Outer
Limits,'' which originally aired form 1963 to 1965, and at Disney
World's The Spaceship Earth and Exxon Energy Pavilion attractions.
   He is survived by his wife, Rita; a son; and a stepson. A
memorial service was scheduled for Wednesday in Studio City.

FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (2): Faded beauty of the
Swedish Model
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISE AND FALL OF THE SWEDISH MODEL by Hans de Geer Carden Publications
Pounds 25, 208 pages
THE Swedish Model seduced the outside world for a long time. For many
overseas admirers the paradigm of the good society - rational, efficient,
progressive - to its enemies it was Aldous Huxley's Brave New World of
stifling conformity and well-meaning authoritarianism.
Swedes themselves saw the Model less as an abstraction or prototype and more
as a way of life in which a dynamic free market economy coexisted
harmoniously with a huge and generous public sector based on high taxes.
This corporatist system worked impressively for nearly 30 years and helped
make Sweden one of the world's most prosperous economies.
Today the Model appears to be drowning beneath the stormy waves of global
recession. Sweden's mounting unemployment, its huge foreign debt and
economic stagnation have combined to undermine faith in the country's
exceptionalism. Now it is having to adjust painfully to outside pressures
with its social and economic integration into western Europe.
But adapt it will. The value of Hans de Geer's book lies in its focus on a
neglected part of the Model, namely its dependence on the active role of SAF
 -The Swedish Employers' Federation. Without the consent of capital it is
difficult to see how the Model could ever have grown to maturity.
Formed in 1902 in reaction to the rise of the LO manual worker union
federation, SAF grew rapidly into a formidable association. With centralised
sanctions over its disparate members and a firm commitment to the absolute
right of employers to manage, it established a common fund to fight strikes
and impose lock-outs. But SAF was never really an anti-union organisation.
On the contrary - as De Geer shows - it agreed to recognise trade unions and
collective agreements from its early days, while in return the trade unions
gave up the principle of the closed shop.
Sweden's industrial consensus was never a flabby middle way but a
hard-headed bargain between capital and labour on their mutual
self-interests. While SAF wanted 'unchanging labour costs' out of it, the LO
favoured solidaristic deals based on wage equality. As the author
emphasises, it was not until the mid-1950s that the central bargaining
system emerged. Over the following 15 years SAF and LO often toured the
world together selling the virtues of the Model they created.
But by the end of the 1960s Sweden's Labour Movement had launched a
workplace reform programme based on legislation, not negotiation, that
brought an end to employer prerogatives, while the rapid growth of the
public sector and arrival of an organised white-collar salariat weakened the
symmetry of SAF-LO bargaining. Wage drift undermined national pay deals and
labour costs grew uncompetitive.
The strain this imposed on SAF was considerable. It brought a clear
ideological shift with a more robust defence of free markets. In more recent
years SAF began to shed its corporatist ways and champion decentralised pay
bargaining. Its leaders talk more boldly today than they used to do about
competition and private enterprise.
But this is all a matter of degree. What de Geer calls Sweden's 'negotiation
culture' remains intact beneath the surface of its industrial life. The
power balance has shifted more towards employers and away from unions, but
not dramatically so. As the book makes clear, continuity remains as strong
as change in Sweden. The Model may after all just be having a face lift.

<HEAD>Pioneer Modernist Architect Is Dead At Age 88</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Berthold Lubetkin, an architect who played a
leading role in founding the Modernist school in Britain in the
1930s, has died at age 88, his family said.
   Lubetkin died Tuesday at Bristol in western England, the family
said Wednesday. No cause of death was given.
   The son of an industrialist, he was born in Tblisi in what is
now the Soviet republic of Georgia.
   He was reticent about his early years, saying ``there is no such
thing as a fact.'' But news reports said he was educated in Moscow
and St. Petersburg, now Leningrad, witnessed the Bolshevik
revolution of 1917 and absorbed the progressive ideas of
Constructivism prevalent at that time.
   In 1922, he accompanied an exhibition of Soviet art to Berlin
and went on to pursue architectural and engineering studies at
various European centers.
   In 1925, he went to Paris, then the focus of the European
avant-garde movement, and acted as site supervisory architect for
Konstantin Melnikov's dynamic Constructivist Soviet pavilion for
the Paris Exhibition of Decorative Arts of that year.
   In the French capital he met among others the Russian-born
writer Ilya Ehrenburg and the painters Georges Braque, Fernand
Leger and Pablo Picasso and worked with Jean Ginsberg, with whom he
designed an apartment block in the Avenue de Versailles.
   By then a glamorous and exotic figure, Lubetkin came to London
in 1931 and the following year set up Tecton, a co-operative of
young architects committed to radical ideas.
   Modernism was named after the Modern Architecture Research Group
which Lubetkin helped found in 1933. But Lubetkin's first buildings
in Britain were designed not for people but animals.
   In 1932, thanks to the influence of scientists Sir Solly
Zuckerman, later Lord Zuckerman, ad Sir Julian Huxley, brother of
writer Aldous Huxley, he was commissioned to design the gorilla
house at London Zoo and in 1937 the penguin pool.
   The famous pool's composition of curved planes of reinforced
concrete still draws acclaim from students of architecture.
   His first opportunity to build for humans came in 1933, when he
was commissioned to design a luxury apartment block at Highgate in
north London, the capital's highest point.
   Highpoint One, as the block was called, was the most conspicuous
statement of the so-called new ``white architecture'' in Britain.
Many of its details, like the S-curved front to the balconies, went
on to become cliches in the 1950s.
   Lubetkin's London monument to Vladimir I. Lenin, unveiled by the
Soviet ambassador in 1942, was later removed because of repeated
attacks by anti-Communists.
   After World War II, the architect concentrated on designing
homes for blue-collar workers.
   Tecton broke up in 1948 and Lubetkin abandoned architecture to
take up farming in Gloucestershire in western England.
   An often impatient man and an inveterate gambler, Lubetkin
radiated cosmopolitan charm and had an engagingly mischievous sense
of humor. But he was unable to conceal his anger at the direction
taken by post-war architecture.
   In 1982, in belated recognition of his pioneering work, the
Royal Institute of British Architects presented him with its Royal
Gold Medal for Architecture.
   In his acceptance speech, he attacked the architectural style
known as Post-Modernism that flourished after the war as a
``transvestite'' aberration, the ``mumbo jumbo of a hit-and-miss
society.''
   He was equally critical of the style dubbed High-Tech.
   Lubetkin married architect Margaret Church in 1936. She died in
1978. They had two daughters and a son, who survive him.

FT  01 JUN 92 / The new politics of dependency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The notion that governments should seek to mould the behaviour of citizens
is somewhat chilling. It conjures up images of Aldous Huxley's Brave New
World, where the social and genetic conditioning was so absolute that even
the subhuman 'deltas' were perfectly content with their menial lot. Yet this
seems to be the direction in which US social policy is moving. Many poverty
experts argue that the obstacles to self-advancement in the inner city and
elsewhere are internal rather than external: psychological rather than
economic.
Modern society may be moving into a third phase. In the first pre-capitalist
phase, only an aristocratic elite enjoyed high living standards. The
industrial revolution ushered in a second 'progressive' phase during which
the mass of working people improved themselves, partly through the
opportunities created by free markets and partly by pressing successfully
for a host of social reforms, such as government pensions, healthcare and
jobless benefits. In this phase, reformers of all political stripes made a
critical assumption: the poor are no different from anybody else and will
respond readily to market incentives and government programmes.
Yet entrenched poverty in an economy as wealthy and open as the US perhaps
indicates the start of a third social phase. Here, the bulk of the
population lives comfortably because obstacles to personal advancement,
while real, are minor by historical standards. However, a significant
minority - most visible as a disaffected urban underclass - is dependent:
either unable or unwilling to grasp new opportunities. Poverty experts see
policies aimed explicitly at changing behaviour as the only way to energise
the passive, non-working poor and hence propel them into the social
mainstream.
Mr Lawrence Mead, an academic at New York University, is one of the most
articulate exponents of such theories, known as 'the new paternalism'. In a
recently published book*, he argues that conventional social policies fail
because they take for granted people's competence to respond positively to
incentives. By competence, he means all the qualities that allow a person to
get ahead economically - not only intelligence but foresight, energy,
discipline, and the ability to sacrifice for the future. He believes the
challenge is no longer to alter the economic or social structure of society,
but to change the personal psychology of dysfunctional adults.
Controversially, Mr Mead blames poverty squarely on lack of work effort, not
low wages. If the poor worked as hard as the middle classes they would not
be poor. On his figures, only 16 per cent of the heads of poor families work
full-time; less than half work at all. The top fifth of the income
distribution works seven times as many hours as the bottom fifth. He claims
that most barriers to work are largely imaginary: there are still plenty of
unskilled jobs; most women can arrange childcare quite cheaply; welfare
benefits are too low to provide a rational alternative to employment. The
problems lie mainly in people's heads.
It is not that the poor are social rebels. Surveys indicate that welfare
claimants share the same values as the rest of society: for example, they
affirm the importance of steady employment and law and order. On many social
issues, the poor are actually more conservative than the better off: 'They
value external controls on behaviour exactly because their internal controls
are less secure.' For Mr Mead, the core problem is that the poor have
difficulty organising their lives and responding constructively to the
opportunities that do exist. They are 'dutiful but defeated', unable to put
good intentions into practice.
The solution is not more incentives or opportunities but - horror of horrors
 -enforcement. Mr Mead strongly supports workfare, or policies that make
welfare benefits conditional on work or training. Mandatory requirements are
necessary to 'overcome the defeatism of the clients, to engage their own
energies in the quest for employment'. He claims that workfare is much less
resented by the poor than intellectuals suspect, mainly because the aim is
to enforce values that clients already possess. Indeed, some clients are
gratified to be chased up by officials because it indicates an interest in
their lives. The main purpose is not to force people unwillingly into jobs
but to ensure they organise themselves for regular activity outside the
home. 'Authority thus operates as the midwife, not the antithesis, of
freedom,' he claims.
New paternalism is still a sideshow. But as states implement the 1988 Family
Support Act, workfare requirements will become more common. It is likely to
mark the beginning of a new trend, in which government agencies demand
rather than merely encourage changes in behaviour.
The reliance on authority leaves a sour taste. But market liberals who put
freedom first should remember how much their philosophy takes for granted.
Those who flourish under capitalism have usually been subject to heavy
psychological moulding during childhood, both at school and in the home.
They have been trained to respond to the right incentives. The new
paternalists are no more authoritarian: they merely want to tackle
dependency by providing a little extra training for those who missed out in
childhood.

<HEAD>Father Of LSD Helping Raise Money To Improve Drug's Image</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The psychedelic drug LSD is 50 years old this
year, and the Swiss chemist who discovered the now-illegal drug
that influenced a generation is trying to help raise money to
spruce up its image.
   Albert Hofmann made the first batch of lysergic acid
diethylamide-25 in 1938. But it wasn't until April 19, 1943, that
he took the first LSD trip, by accident.
   ``Some trace entered my body,'' he said. ``I don't know by which
way, maybe a drop of the solution came on my fingers.''
   While riding his bicycle home from the lab, Hofmann started to
feel like he was losing his mind.
   But as the dosage dissipated, he said, he started to ``enjoy the
experience. Then I realized it was an important discovery.''
   The mind-altering drug eventually fueled millions of trips and
inspired a new wave of poets and musicians, before a government ban
on LSD filled the streets with rivers of bad acid.
   Hofmann, 82, is touring Southern California to raise money for a
foundation that is seeking to improve LSD's image and hopes to
build a Los Angeles library in his name, dedicated to LSD and the
psychedelic movement.
   Dr. Oscar Janiger, a professor at the University of California,
Irvine, who has taken the drug 13 times, is the founder of the
Albert Hofmann Foundation.
   He said his research between 1954 and 1962 on LSD and creativity
showed the drug has important scientific applications.
   ``It was a very valuable tool because it allowed us to make some
inferences about how brain chemistry works and how the mind really
functions in perceiving things around us,'' said Janiger. ``It was
a very important adjunct to neuroscientific research, and it was
used in that way.''
   The foundation's board of advisers include poet Allen Ginsberg,
who first took LSD in a 1959 government experiment; Ram Dass, once
known as Harvard professor Richard Alpert; neuroscientist John
Lilly; and Laura Huxley, widow of author Aldous Huxley.
   Janiger envisions the library as a ``world information center''
for the study of inner space, complete with lectures, seminars,
workshops and a newsletter.
   Not everyone is as enthusiastic about the library as Janiger.
   ``If it is strictly a research thing, you can't have enough of
that,'' said Michael Pavlick, head of the Drug Enforcement
Administration's Dangerous Drug Unit in Washington. ``But with the
people involved, I hope they are not going to glorify it.''

USC SELLING PACIFIC PALISADES MANSION FOR USE AS U.S.-EUROPE RESEARCH CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Pacific Palisades mansion that was a gathering place for intellectuals who 
fled Hitler's Germany is being bought by a West German foundation for use as a 
research center for European-American relations and German exile literature. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by USC, which inherited the house in 1987, to sell it for $1.9 
million is a victory for the German foundation and for preservationists who two 
years ago opposed a plan by the university to sell the property and move its 
prized 36,000-volume library to the university's Exposition Park campus. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans -- with the support of West German President Richard von 
Weizsaecker and former Chancellor Willy Brandt -- wanted to keep the house and 
library intact as a monument to German writers and artists who fled Nazi 
persecution and settled in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed in December, USC will allow approximately 22,000 
volumes to be kept at the mansion on a long-term loan. The remaining books -- 
all rare first editions or volumes printed before AD 1500 -- will be kept in a 
temporary storage facility near the campus until they can be moved into a 
permanent wing to be built in Doheny Memorial Library in the next several 
years, said George Abdo, USC executive assistant to the president. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-style house, featuring a sweeping view of the Pacific from a bluff 
above Sunset Boulevard, was bought by the late German novelist and playwright 
Lion Feuchtwanger in 1943 and served as a hub for the German exile community in 
Los Angeles and other European notables. Among its regular visitors were Thomas 
Mann, Charlie Chaplin, Bertolt Brecht, Aldous Huxley, Arnold Schoenberg and 
conductor Bruno Walter. 
</P>
<P>
"For them, the Villa Aurora was a productive and important meeting place during 
the exile period," said Lothar C. Poll, spokesman for the group that is buying 
the house and publisher of the West Berlin Tagesspiegel, the city's main daily 
newspaper. "It was a kind of 'Weimar on the Pacific.' " 
</P>
<P>
At least twice a year, members of the exile community would gather at the house 
to hear Feuchtwanger read from manuscripts of his latest plays or novels, 
according to USC professor Harold von Hofe, senior fellow of the new research 
center, called the Villa Aurora Institute. After discussions, the group would 
adjourn downstairs for herring salad followed by apple strudel, recalled Hilde 
Waldo, Feuchtwanger's personal secretary. 
</P>
<P>
The house was built in 1927 by the Los Angeles Times as a showcase of the 
latest in home design. 
</P>
<P>
Feuchtwanger's widow, Marta, left the mansion and library to USC upon her death 
in 1987, but her will gave the university the option of selling the house and 
using the proceeds to build a Lion Feuchtwanger Memorial Library on campus. The 
house's library would have been moved to the new library on campus, in that 
case. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to buying the house, the German foundation, called the Circle of 
Friends and Supporters of the Villa Aurora, has agreed to pay an estimated $2 
million to upgrade the house's interior and shore up its crumbling foundation. 
The group also will be responsible for raising funds to run the Villa Aurora 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Von Hofe said the West German Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, and the 
West Berlin senate, as well as private donors, contributed funds to the 
preservation effort. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the institute have yet to be worked out, but university officials 
said the main focus will be European-American relations, a topic they say will 
become increasingly critical as political events in Europe continue to unfold. 
</P>
<P>
Among speakers already lined up for institute-sponsored lectures in the summer 
and fall are Brandt and West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper, said Daniel M. Evans, 
attorney for the Friends of Villa Aurora, the California counterpart of the 
German group. The lectures will probably be given at USC or at other facilities 
that can hold large audiences, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
The house will also serve as a center for research into German exile 
literature, including studies of works by Feuchtwanger, Mann, Alfred Doeblin 
and other German writers who produced many of their best-known works in Los 
Angeles. The exile studies center will be closely tied to the existing 
Feuchtwanger Institute for Exile Studies on the USC campus, said Von Hofe, who 
also heads the campus institute. 
</P>
<P>
Von Hofe said the research center will necessarily operate on a small scale -- 
the house does not comfortably hold more than about 50 people, he said, and 
parking on the narrow and winding road that leads up to it is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, plans for the institute must first be presented to neighbors at a 
public hearing chaired by a city zoning administrator, who will decide whether 
to recommend a conditional use permit for the center, said Claire Rogger, 
deputy to City Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement caps two years of long-distance negotiations between USC and the 
German foundation. USC initially rejected the Germans' preservation proposal, 
but several weeks later said it would reconsider it, if the group came up with 
$15 million to pay for the new Feuchtwanger library on campus, repair the house 
and establish an endowment to run a research center at the mansion, which the 
university would continue to own. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans said they would agree to such a plan only if half the money could 
be raised from American donors, a proposal that ultimately fell through because 
the U.S. fund-raising effort failed, Von Hofe said. However, the Germans' 
fund-raising campaign was more successful, and USC changed its position and 
agreed to sell the house. 
</P>
<P>
Final terms of the agreement were worked out last fall, Von Hofe said, and a 
board of trustees of the Villa Aurora Institute will be chosen soon after 
escrow closes in the next few months. Von Hofe said the institute's acting 
director will be Daniel S. Hamilton, who recently joined the Carnegie Endowment 
for International Peace as a senior associate after seven years as deputy 
director of the Aspen Institute Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
"There was an evolutionary process, and in the end it simply proved that this 
was the most effective way to resolve the situation and accomplish the ends 
that they and we wished to accomplish," Abdo said. "We are obviously pleased 
and supportive. We think it provides the grounds for the development of the 
Feuchtwanger Library on the campus and for the development of an important 
institute for exile studies and Euro-American studies in Los Angeles."

Imagine a world in which short children are treated with a drug to make them 
taller. Although it borders on the Brave New World -- depicted in the 1930s 
novel by Aldous Huxley in which human embryos were tampered with so that they 
developed standard traits -- the technology necessary to turn this science 
fiction into fact is already being explored. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, physicians have been treating some midget children with growth 
hormone extracted from human cadavers to boost their height by the time they 
reach adulthood. (Unlike dwarfs, who have disproportionately large heads in 
relation to their limbs and torso, midgets are proportionately short). 
</P>
<P>
But only since 1985 has genetic engineering made it possible to generate the 
hormone in large enough quantities to be used for short children who are 
growing so slowly that they are not expected to reach more than 5 feet, 3 
inches if they are boys or 4 feet, 10 inches if girls. 
</P>
<P>
The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Md., 
is currently conducting clinical tests to assess the effectiveness of growth 
hormone in these "normal" children, who, unlike midgets, do not have a classic 
growth hormone deficiency. The results will not be in for at least 10 years, 
but that has not stopped some doctors from using the therapy on such children. 
</P>
<P>
The use of growth hormone is presenting an ethical dilemma in a society that 
often measures the worth of people by their height. Others argue that no 
substance, regardless of one's ethical point of view, should be used widely 
until it is proven safe and effective. 
</P>
<P>
At a recent state-of-the-art conference on growth hormone therapy sponsored by 
the Swedish Medical Research Council in Stockholm, about the only point 15 
experts on the therapy could agree on was that tests used to detect a growth 
hormone deficiency are not reliable, said Louis Underwood, a University of 
North Carolina pediatric endocrinologist who attended the conference. 
</P>
<P>
Without dependable tests, physicians cannot separate children who are growing 
slowly because of a medical condition that is stemming their growth hormone 
production from children who are merely following a family tradition of being 
short. While it makes sense that physicians should correct the former, treating 
genetically short children with the hormone raises thorny ethical issues. 
</P>
<P>
Short stature is not necessarily a disease, points out Leona Cuttler, a 
University of Chicago pediatric endocrinologist in an article in the Journal of 
the American Medical Assn. last year, but part of the normal variation in human 
appearance. Physicians who try to boost a normal short child's height with 
growth hormone may be likened to plastic surgeons who try to improve appearance 
with nose jobs and tummy tucks. 
</P>
<P>
But consenting adults submit to these cosmetic procedures, not children. 
Because growth hormone therapy is only thought to be effective in children and 
not full-grown adults, a child's parents and physician must decide if he should 
be treated. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to be very careful when deciding whom to treat," says pediatric 
endocrinologist Gilbert August of George Washington University. "Often it isn't 
the kids who are worried about being short, but their parents. 
</P>
<P>
"These parents, who are short themselves, vicariously relive through the child 
their own failures in high school about not being able to make the team, etc. 
I've often joked that if you could just do a 'parentectomy' these kids would be 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
But even without parental pressures, short stature can be emotionally costly in 
our society, which values height. "The money you save by not giving growth 
hormone," says August, "you may as well give to a psychiatrist." 
</P>
<P>
Some scientists cite studies showing success is tied to height, with taller 
people making more money or having more prestigious jobs on the average than 
shorter individuals. The midgets who portrayed the munchkins in the movie "The 
Wizard of Oz," for example, earned less money than the dog Toto. 
</P>
<P>
Short height, however, is a relative term that is dependent on the range of 
height in a population. When August told a group of dwarfs, for example, about 
the possibility of using growth hormone to boost a normal but short boy's final 
adult height from 5 feet, 1 inch to 5 feet, 3 inches, they were horrified. 
"People 5 feet tall are like giants to dwarfs who typically aren't taller than 
4 feet, 3 inches," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
By definition, a child is short if he is in the lowest 5% of height in a normal 
population. But if doctors were able to effectively treat all these children 
with growth hormone, they would not eliminate short stature but rather create a 
new crop of short kids -- there will always be someone in the short range of 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
"Where to draw the line and decide whom to treat with growth hormone is a 
dilemma we're struggling with right now," says pediatric endocrinologist Susan 
Rose of the University of New Mexico Medical Center in Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
The high cost of growth hormone therapy is also an issue. "We're talking 
$60,000 to $70,000 per inch," says pediatric endocrinologist Melvin Grumbach of 
UC San Francisco. "Is a few inches worth the equivalent of what it costs to 
send a kid to college?" 
</P>
<P>
Another reason not to treat a normal short child with growth hormone, Grumbach 
added, is that "the jury is still out" on the effectiveness and long-term 
safety of the therapy used on these children. "If you know a therapy is 
effective and has no risk tied to it, you do it," says endocrinologist Gordon 
Cutler of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. "But if 
both the risk and the effectiveness are uncertain, you should do nothing and 
let nature take its course, or you should enroll the patient in a clinical 
trial so we can learn what the risks and benefits are." 
</P>
<P>
There are no clear-cut health risks associated with growth hormone therapy, but 
there are some unconfirmed findings that indicate the therapy -- which usually 
consists of three injections of the hormone per week for several years -- might 
boost a person's chances of developing diabetes, hypothyroidism or leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
"If we knew the therapy would give a person a four-inch gain in their final 
adult height rather than just a two-inch gain, the risks are probably worth 
taking," says Cutler, "but we don't know that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Since most normal children who have been tested with growth hormone therapy 
have not reached adulthood yet, their final gain in height is not known. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the parental pressure on pediatricians to treat more short 
children with growth hormone is building. "Unfortunately, everybody imbues 
growth hormone with magical qualities because we value growth so much," says 
Rose. 
</P>
<P>
What decisions pediatricians make on whom to treat with growth hormone will 
have bearing on the use of future therapies likely to be developed to boost the 
appearance rather than the health of children. "If pediatricians do not respond 
to these dilemmas thoughtfully, carefully and forcefully," Cuttler wrote in her 
article, "other decision makers, whose decisions may reflect political, social 
or market forces, may then respond in ways that do not reflect the best 
interests of children."

FT  09 JAN 93 / Lucky seven cut their literary teeth: A look at the work of
the new novelists that WH Smith is launching this month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of Aldous Huxley's characters says: 'No publisher would ever publish a
first novel if he could possibly avoid it.' This is not quite true. One or
two exceptional first novels, such as Donna Tartt's The Secret History,
published earlier this year, are fiercely competed for and reap huge
pre-publication advances.
But for the most part, taking on first novels is to publishing what planting
oak trees is to forestry: you do it more for the benefit of your successors
than yourself. A first novelist may take 10 years or more to mature into a
steady, profitable seller. WH Smith, sometimes criticised in the literary
world for its alleged indifference to the existence of worthwhile
non-bestselling novelists, is taking an initiative to try to remedy this.
It has got together with a number of fiction publishers to select seven
first novels which will all appear as paperbacks and will be given the same
high profile promotion in its shops as is currently afforded to the likes of
Danielle Steel, Catherine Cookson, Robert Ludlum and Stephen King.
Although none of the lucky seven has had a novel published before, several
of them have experience in other forms of creative writing or in working for
publishers. Valerie Windsor, whose psychological thriller Telling Stories
comes from Sinclair Stevenson, cut her dramatic teeth as one of the writers
on the Channel 4 Brookside team and has had plays broadcast.
American Jane Stanton Hitchcock is also a playwright turned novelist. Her
play, Vanilla, caught the attention of Harold Pinter, who put it on at the
Lyric Theatre in Hammersmith, London, where it rapidly came off. But it
seems she will have better luck with her novel Trick of the Eye (Penguin),
where the investigative heroine is an artist who specialises in illusion.
The assignment to re-design the ballroom of a grand Long Island home plunges
her into a world of illusion and counter-illusion that for once is not
entirely of her own devising.
Anne Billson has lived professionally in a world of illusion as the film
critic of New Statesman and, clearly, her novel Suckers (Pan) is an attempt
to cut through all the pretence this engenders, especially that surrounding
the affluent young financial high-livers of contemporary London.
Elizabeth Palmer began her professional life as a graphic designer in a
publishing house. She moved from there to the Financial Times, where she met
her husband David, now its chief executive, and then became a freelance book
designer. Two years ago, she began writing The Stainless Angel (Arrow) and
on submission of the manuscript was rewarded not just with acceptance but
also a forward-looking deal for further novels.
The story she tells is of Camilla, a widowed Englishwoman with a small son
living in Rome. She marries a fellow member of the British set. His roots
are in upper-class rural England where she finds herself obliged to live -
far from permissive Rome. How she comes to terms with his background - and
it with her - is developed in a traditional linear narrative.
Ben Woolfenden was for eight years deputy manager of a bookshop in Covent
Garden. He saw for himself all too well what shifted and what stuck on the
fiction shelves.
The model for his The Ruins of Time (Black Swan) is the Penelope Lively type
of novel which begins with an investigation of the past, after which the
trail loops disconcertingly forward into the investigator's present. In this
case, the past is that of a late 19th artists' colony in Newlyn, of which
the hero's grandfather was a member - an attractively bohemian setting.
In the case of Joanna Hines, the model is even more illustrious. Hines's
heroine in Dora's Room (Coronet) becomes the chatelaine of Chatton Heights,
where a sequence of revelations and painful remembrances awaits her in
shades of Daphne du Maurier. To underline the comparison, Hines has lived
with her Canadian husband and children in Cornwall for the past 18 years.
And, finally, Marika Cobbold is Swedish, married to an Englishman whom she
met when he was part of a Royal Naval helicopter squadron visiting
Gothenburg. Her father was the editor of a leading Swedish newspaper. But
Nordic Strindbergian gloom is the last epithet to be applied to her Guppies
for Tea (Black Swan). It is in that vein of domestic social comedy beloved
of English women novelists from time immemorial.
Martin Lee, WH Smith's product group manager for adult books who is putting
his muscle behind the launch of these seven new novelists on January 7,
said: 'We do not see the hardback as the natural format for these titles and
believe that they can become more successful as paperbacks.'
That may be so, but it does not, surely, entirely preclude their eventual
hardback publication, and indeed at least one of the titles - Dora's Room -
is being published in both formats simultaneously by Hodder &amp; Stoughton. The
fiction hardback is dead. Long live the fiction hardback]

<HL> Modern Morality Play: 'Everyman' in a Test Tube

<TEXT>
   Anthropologists are uncertain when our primitive ancestors learned the role of the male in reproduction. 
In the earliest human groups, says Will Durant in his "The Story of Civilization," "the physiological role of the male . . . escaped notice as completely as among animals." 
But when people finally saw the connection between the sexual act and a birth many months later, the discovery launched a profound social revolution. 

   Until then primitive society was basically feminist. 
The female alone seemed responsible for the child growing inside her, for some mysterious reason, and she alone was responsible for the continuation of the species. 
That gave her a preeminent position. 
The male's role, while important, was limited to the hunter and nurturer of the woman and her offspring. 
Kinship was recognized only through the female. 
The gods worshipped were all female. 

   But once the mystery of birth was unlocked, all changed. 
Gone were casual sexual relationships. 
To be sure of their children, men began to restrict the lives of women, at first with rigidly controlled polygamy and ultimately with monogamy. 
The chief gods became bearded males. 
The subjugation of women had begun. 

   Today we seem to be in the midst of another reproductive revolution likely also to have profound if unknown social consequences. 

   It began with "the pill," which freed women from the burden of constant child bearing. 
That started the sexual revolution, with its breakdown of old mores. 
It is not unusual today for women to bear children openly without marriage, often children of unknown fathers. 

   But this was only the beginning of the way technology is making a revolution. 
Today, women can and do have children using sperm from artificial insemination. 

   From this has come the growing prevalence of "surrogate mothers." 
In this practice a woman rents her body to be inseminated by an absent man, and brings the child to term for another woman who cannot or doesn't wish to bear her own. 

   This has given us the controversial case of "Baby M." 
Here a Mrs. Whitehead agreed for $10,000 to accept the sperm of William Stern, bear the child and then give the child to the Sterns to raise as their own. 
But once the child was born, old and deep maternal feelings took hold of Mrs. Whitehead and she refused to give up her child. 

   The result was a lawsuit brought by the Sterns alleging breach of contract, and the trial judge in New Jersey ruled that the law of contracts did apply. 
Mrs. Whitehead had agreed, accepted her fee and must live up to the agreement. 
The judge also held that Mrs. Whitehead was not the best mother to rear the child and that Baby M should be raised by Mrs. Stern, who had nothing to do with the nine-month nourishing of the unborn child. 

   We have not heard the last of this case, of course. 
It will be appealed and higher courts may rule otherwise. 
Meanwhile, legislatures are grappling with what to do, if anything, about both the legal and moral questions so dramatically presented. 

   Under older mores Baby M would be considered illegitimate since her father (in absentia) and her mother were not married, but that has hardly been mentioned in the resultant controversy because illegitimacy is no longer a social stigma. 
So much for older mores. 

   But the Baby M case is only the beginning of both the technological and social revolutions. 
Male sperm can now be preserved almost indefinitely, so it is possible for a woman to bear a child fathered by a man long dead. 
And it will not be long before the eggs of females can be removed and preserved as well. 

   We have then the possibility of conception without copulation, of children born not from acts of love or passion but from the ministrations of technicians in a laboratory. 
And it's hardly surprising this brings much public debate about the social, political and moral issues it raises. 

   Following the debate makes me feel I am watching a modern morality play unfold. 
Those popular plays in the 15th century, such as "Everyman," revolved around the clash of good and evil. 
The characters in them had names but they were intended as symbols to illustrate moral issues. 
Usually, but not always, good won over evil; either way the plays were designed to teach dramatically the moral questions of the time. 

   Today, Baby M is a real person, as are her unrelated parents, but all are also symbols for new moral questions. 
Nobody really knows how many surrogate mothers have played their role to bring forth other Baby Ms to perturb us with questions of social policy. 

   Nor is this necessarily the end of questions to plague us. 
In time, science may bring us to the situation imagined by Aldous Huxley in his "Brave New World." 
That is, embryos nurtured not in a woman's body but in incubators row on row, with parents unknown of either sex. 

   Even as it is, we've learned that sex can be removed from propagation; all that is necessary is a laboratory with people in white coats. 
What that portends for the Baby Ms grown to adulthood no one knows. 
What will be their feelings when they come to know how they came to be? 
What ties will bind them to a father who was only a sperm in a test tube or to a mother who was only briefly a rented body? 
To which one, if either, does the child belong? 

   And what will this do to the relationship between women and men, to the institution of marriage and family, already diminished in social importance? 
Will we, like the Cro-Magnons, come to think of sex as no more than a casual matter since it is of no importance to continuing the species? 

   I do not know how this modern morality play will end, how we will resolve the current issue of surrogate mothers or how much farther technology will take us in divorcing sex from reproduction. 

   I can see that if the miracle of birth becomes merely a matter of matching sperm and egg in a test tube, the social revolution will be as far-reaching as the one wrought long ago among our primitive ancestors.

   Science and Literature Reconciled

   Literary types have always tended to take a pretty dim
view of science. Their attitudes range from Romantic contempt
-- Wordsworth's "We murder to dissect" -- to the snobbery of
Oxford dandies who used to refer to the subject as "Stinks."
The big gulf between the scientific community and the
humanities crowd, already noted by the
scientist-turned-novelist C.P. Snow in his famous "Two
Cultures" lecture in 1959, has not gotten any smaller.
   "A Literary Guide to Science" (Norton, 517 pages, $24.95)
is the latest ecumenical gesture on the part of science
toward the literary world. Its editor, Walter Gratzer, is a
researcher in biophysics at London University, who must also
have been doing rather a lot of bedtime reading over the
years. Here he has compiled more than 200 excerpts from
novels, memoirs, biographies, plays, reportage and verse,
plus a few complete short stories -- that represent
"incursions of science into literature." Each is preceded by
a pithy introduction. Although the selection is heavily
weighted toward the 20th century, he's not forgotten about
Swift, Pope, Byron, Flaubert and Samuel Butler. There is
almost no science fiction, which by and large is neither very
literary nor very scientific.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "A Literary Guide" is well-leavened with comedy, beginning
with an amusing account by James Thurber of his inability to
see absolutely anything through a microscope, to the immense
annoyance of his botany professor. Only after a year of
trying every conceivable adjustment of the instrument did he
finally manage to record an image of "a variegated
constellation of flecks, specks, and dots," which he took for
plant cells until his enraged instructor pointed out that
Thurber had drawn a reflection of his own eye.
   Elsewhere in the book we are treated to the spectacle of
Renaissance astronomer Tycho Brahe's tame elk imbibing too
much beer and falling fatally down some stairs; of
archbishops struggling with books on relativity theory (only
to be told by Einstein that "it is a purely scientific matter
and has nothing to do with religion"); and of Alexander
Graham Bell trying to get the dying President Garfield to
swallow a light bulb so that the assassin's bullet inside his
body could be located.
   Otherworldly though scientists are reputed to be, here we
see them acting all too human, both in fact and in fiction.
They sabotage one another's experiments, steal credit for
discoveries, bicker about the order of authors' names on
scientific papers, develop neurotic obsessions with the Nobel
Prize, and get duped by psychics; one even pronounces nuclear
as "nucular," just like Jimmy Carter.
   A particularly unattractive physicist named Otto Warburg
accepts the status of "honorary Aryan" from the Nazis so that
he can remain in his Berlin laboratory even though he is half
Jewish. Asked by a journalist how he felt about the charge
that he was "a great scientist but a rotten human being,"
Warburg replied without a twinkle in his eye: "I am glad they
do not say the other way around."
   More appealing is the rounded character portrait drawn of
that towering British physiologist J.B.S. Haldane -- who was
also a classics scholar, an ardent communist, a war hero and
a wag. We are given engaging views of the man from
biographies, memoirs, and from Aldous Huxley's novel "Antic
Hay," in which he was a character. Also included is a
surprisingly good short story by Haldane himself, a dryly
witty thriller about a conspiracy to extract gold from sea
water.
   Pop topics are not scanted by "A Literary Guide." Those
who have forgotten about Kurt Vonnegut's "ice-nine" will find
a brief refresher from his "Cat's Cradle," plus another
account by Mr. Vonnegut of how the idea for this
ocean-congealing substance was first offered by a General
Electric scientist to H.G. Wells, who declined to make
fictional use of it. Wilhelm Reich's notorious orgone box,
which was supposed to do everything from healing wounds to
improving orgasms, gets sent up by that great puncturer of
science frauds, Martin Gardner.
   Mr. Gratzer admits that he may have omitted worthy stuff
due to ignorance, but how did he come to ignore Joyce and
Nabokov? Did science touch their writing? It did. Nabokov's
memoirs include a marvelous account of his scientific
fascination with butterflies. Joyce devoted an entire episode
of "Ulysses" to the theme of science and coined the term
"quark" (used by physicists to denote the basic building
blocks of matter) in "Finnegans Wake."
   There are sins of commission as well as omission: Many of
the excerpts Mr. Gratzer has included from forgotten
scientific novels are too brief to achieve critical mass, and
are written in less than delicious prose. But the average is
pushed up well above the purchase threshold by literary gems
from the likes of Primo Levi, Michael Frayn and John Updike,
who plainly knows as much about contemporary physics as he
does about Kierkegaard and funky sex. With items such as his
charming bit of doggerel about neutrinos streaming through
the bodies of lovers in Nepal, this guide ought to keep even
the most jaded literary aesthete amused.

Zambia is the subject of the last of BBC2's series Out Of Darkness (7.50)
which has been looking at efforts to reshape African societies. The
programme considers Frederick Chiluba's chances of reversing the effects of
Kaunda's 26-year presidency which was marked by widespread corruption.
Perhaps we should be relishing current affairs programmes in peak viewing
time since many may be pushed to the margins in January when ITV comes under
the government's new whelk-stall philosophy of broadcasting. World In Action
must be a prime candidate. Today's programme records recent cases in which
American children (well, American lawyers on behalf of children) have used
the law to oppose their parents' smoking habits. Shades of Huxley's 'Brave
New World' (8.30 ITV).
The second of C4's documentaries Animal Squad Undercover (9.00) finds the
RSPCA's Special Unit investigating organised dog fighting. Panorama looks
for once at the EC from the vantage points of France and Germany, asking
whether they will create a European 'premier league'.

HUNGRY GENERATIONS
by John Wain Hutchinson Pounds 15.99,
378 pages
CATALYSTS
by Stanley Middleton
Hutchinson Pounds 15.99,
266 pages
When John Wain died in May, aged 69, he had been working on his trilogy of
novels set in Oxford for the past decade.
Parts one and two, Where The Rivers Meet and Comedies, appeared in 1988 and
1992. Posthumous publication of Hungry Generations completes the work; it is
built around the lives of two brothers, the sons of an Oxford publican. One
is a skilled worker at the Morris factory at Cowley, and the other a history
don at an imaginary college called Episcopus.
Where Rivers Meet is the over-all title. Not only does Oxford stand at the
confluence of the Thames and the Cherwell, it also has two distinct faces,
as a centre of industry and of learning, both of which are contained in the
work.
There is rather more of gown than of town in this final volume. Events are
seen through the mind of the academic brother Peter Leonard. By 1948, when
it starts, he has reached the age of 38, and he remains in Oxford teaching
history until the crunch-year of 1956 with news of the Suez adventure, and
the march of Soviet troops into Hungary, reaching him as the story ends.
It was a conscious gamble by the novelist to stake everything on Oxford. It
has been done to death in detective fiction and often used by serious
novelists such as Compton Mackenzie, Waugh and Murdoch who have looked back
to their time there as an essential element in a larger work - Sinister
Street, Brideshead Revisited, The Book and The Brotherhood. But to find it
treated by a novelist as the summation of a lifetime's experience is unique.
Wain leaves one in no doubt as to his deep affection for the city in spite
of the spoilations of Billy Morris, as the hero's father calls Lord
Nuffield.
His clever son, historian of the 18th century, shares Wain's insatiable
curiosity about everything from the mating habits of the sparrows on the
college lawn, to the construction of the P3 MG racing-car and the sex
theories of Wilhelm Reich.
Their main function seems to be to distract the reader from the hard core of
pain that might otherwise make the book unbearable to read.
Pessimism about human possibility is the dominant mood. There is the long
agony of Leonard's divorce and humiliating return to live like a single man
in college; the pain of trying to reconcile the bitter after-taste of his
first marriage with the domestic bliss of his second (a cloying note); the
pain of the death of his son in a motor-racing accident and the series of
disasters that befall other members of the senior common room.
The hero is Wain's alter ego, the Oxford don that Wain never became.
Teaching and research was a way of life he firmly rejected when he resigned
his lectureship at Reading in 1955 after the success of Hurry On Down. Wain
could then have become a leading journalist critic in London. But he did not
want to be that either. He was made a fellow of the Royal Society of
Literature; after a year he resigned that too.
Instead he went to live near Oxford. It was a quiet, industrious and
inevitably insecure existence, but it enabled him to do his own thing, which
was to write novels and poetry.
With Catalysts Stanley Middleton shows that he belongs to that small number
of novelists able to integrate convincing accounts of musical performance
into the texture of a novel of contemporary life. They include Proust, EM
Forster, Aldous Huxley and JB Priestley.
Here we are with the elderly music teacher at a school in the Midlands.
His son is a cellist of renown whose mistress is an opera star. There are
several fine descriptions of them in action in a novel that shows with great
subtlety the way professional life acts as a catalyst upon private life.
It does this just as much in the unglamorous professions of the other main
characters - accountancy and English teaching.
This quintet weave in and out of each others' lives in a novel that is not
so much written as delicately scored.
Middleton, joint Booker Prize-winner, is a master-technician of the form.
His latest piece of work will give much pleasure to its connoisseurs.

FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (30): Understanding
Hypermedia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HYPERMEDIA IS the product of the collision of electronic cultures; radio,
television, voice telephony and computing. It includes futuristic concepts
like hypertext, a variety of automated, electronic encyclopaedia, and
virtual reality, where the subject is transported into an electronic dream
world via a video visor and sensory gloves. A more mundane example is the
interactive video programmes extensively used in education and training.
Understanding Hypermedia: From Multimedia to Virtual Reality by Bob Cotton
and Richard Oliver (Phaidon Pounds 19.95, 160 pages) sets out to explain,
through a kaleidoscope of text and images, how individual electronic media
can be combined to yield a new and revolutionary technology which can be
controlled through language and physical gestures.
The authors believe it will dominate mass culture in the next century.
Pioneers like Ted Nelson and Vannevar Bush have argued that the hypermedia
approach to a topic is closer to the way humans think than the sequence of
information presented in books or films. Aldous Huxley would have felt
vindicated.

From Alexis de Tocqueville to ALF, foreigners traditionally have offered the 
most insightful comments on American mores and foibles. During the early '60s, 
Indian novelist R. K. Narayan traversed the United States, carefully recording 
his bewilderment at such curious American phenomena as cafeterias and the New 
York subway system. He's bemused by the cheerful vulgarity of a woman who 
expects facile answers to complex metaphysical questions, dismayed by the 
crudely made brew American restaurants call coffee and charmed by the reclusive 
Greta Garbo. A chapter on Los Angeles includes notes on meeting Aldous Huxley 
and various studio executives, descriptions of the vanished charms of Pershing 
Square and dismayed reactions to the smog and traffic. Highly entertaining 
sketches of the United States as seen through Indian eyes.

<LEADPARA>  IF "Hudson Hawk" (opening today) is half as juicy as the gossip that
surrounded it during production, we're in for one helluva ride. Bruce Willis,
fresh from his villainous turn in "Mortal Thoughts," plays the legendary cat
burglar of the title, a guy named Eddie Hawkins. Eddie is just back from a
10-year stretch in stir, and he's telling everybody he's a reformed man. Of
course no one believes him, and before you can say "To Catch a Thief -- 1991
Style," our hero is pressed back into service for a round-the-world heist that
involves three works by Leonardo da Vinci.;    "Hudson Hawk" reportedly ran
into trouble with test audiences, who couldn't tell whether it was supposed to
be arch or straight-faced or both. With Michael Lehmann ("Heathers," "Meet the
Applegates") in the director's chair, we're predicting an elaborate
cat-and-mouse number with lots of quirky twists.  </LEADPARA>

leaving us to surmise: 1) the producers don't feel Lehmann pulled off his
first big-budget assignment, or 2) Eddie Hawkins shares more in common with
Steven Seagal than Peter Ustinov and the other debonair felons of "Topkapi,"
still the prototype for this kind of thing.;    - Glenn Lovell; THE ROCKING
SOUND OF NEO-FOLK SONGS;    JOHN WESLEY HARDING, last year's hands-down
favorite for Rock Rookie of the Year, is back with further proof that the age
of the neo-folkie-singer-songwriter is not over yet. The Cambridge-educated
Englishman with the rapier-sharp wit and the rather presumptuous stage name
has a second hit album on college radio ("The Name Above the Title"), a full
band and the dubious distinction of sounding more like Elvis Costello than
Costello himself.;    Saturday, Harding and the Deceivers have a 9:30 p.m.
show with the Judybats at the Catalyst, 1011 Pacific Ave., Santa Cruz.
Tickets: $6 advance, $7.50 at the door. Call (408) 423-1336. Sunday, they'll
roll into Slim's, 333 11th St., San Francisco, for a 9 p.m. show, also with
the Judybats. Tickets: $12 advance and at the door. Call (415) 621-3330.;    -
David Plotnikoff; SACRED MONSTERS AND TRIALS BY FIRE;    COLLEGE theater
rushes in where angels fear to tread -- quite literally, this week, with "The
Devils" at the University of California, Santa Cruz.;    Based on a novel by
Aldous Huxley, "The Devils of Loudun" (1952), it was adapted for the Royal
Shakespeare Company in 1960 by the brilliant playwright John Whiting, who died
in 1963 at the tragically young age of 45.;     It was drawn from a historical
incident, the 1623 witch trials in Loudun, France, where an innocent priest,
Father Urbain Grandier, was burned at the stake after he was accused of
sorcery by a convent of Ursuline nuns. Huxley clearly intended his novel to
comment on the witch trials of the McCarthy era. So does Michael Edwards,
director of Shakespeare/Santa Cruz, who is staging "The Devils" as a
commentary on Moral Majority politics.;    "The Devils" plays at 8
tonight-Saturday and 3 p.m. Sunday in the Performing Arts Theater. It repeats
next weekend on the same schedule. Tickets: $8, $4.50 for students and
seniors. Call (408) 459-2159.;    - Judith Green; TERRIFYING IMAGES OF A
LUNATIC WORLD;    WITH his smooth surfaces and hallucinatory realism, Bay Area
painter Alonso Smith gives us images that reflect the madness of our times,
the tyranny of technology and war.;    Smith takes on big issues in his
retrospective spanning the years 1943-90 at the Rosicrucian Egyptian Museum.
In "Cornucopia," an abundance of trinkets that dazzle and bind consumers to a
"no-win game" emerges from a Pentagon wheel-of-chance. In "Medical
Malpractice," the surgeon, knife in hand, is about to remove a peace symbol
from his patient's brain.;    The exhibition continues through June 9. The
museum is at Rosicrucian Park, Park and Naglee avenues, San Jose. Hours: 9
a.m.-5 p.m., Tuesdays-Sundays. Tickets: $4, $3.50 seniors and students, $2
children. Call (408) 287-9171.; - Dorothy Burkhart; WOLFGANG HELPS EAST MEET
WEST;    THERE are countless performances of Mozart's "Requiem" around this
year, but none is like Wednesday night's 7:30 p.m. concert in St. Joseph
Cathedral, San Jose.;    The singing will involve an international
brotherhood: the San Jose Symphonic Choir joined by the Washu Citizens' Chorus
from San Jose's sister city, Okayama, Japan. Leroy G. Kromm will conduct with
orchestra.;    In addition, the Japanese choir will perform traditional
numbers under director Yasukazu Kondo, including "Sayonara" and, for female
voices only, "Aru Kazu ni Yosete.";    Tickets: $10 at the door. Call (408)
280-0265.; Paul Hertelendy; SACRAMENTO LETS THE GOOD TIMES ROLL;    Forget the
Big Easy. If it's jazz you want this weekend, go to the Big Tomato. The 18th
annual Sacramento Dixieland Jubilee -- the largest such festival in the world,
with 118 bands playing at 46 sites -- is expected to draw more than 100,000
from today through Monday. But that's no reason you should stay away.;   
Getting into one of those jazz sites isn't that hard. Head to a ticket trailer
at one of the six centers (free shuttles run between them): Old Sacramento,
Cal Expo, the Clarion, the El Rancho, the Radisson, the Convention Center.
Badges run from $20 for half a day to $65 for the full weekend. (For more
information, call 916 372-5277.);    Old Sacramento is the festival's home
base, but the hotels offer more comfortable seating and dance floors and the
parking is easiest at Cal Expo. For jazz with a foreign accent, listen to the
Allotria Jazz Band from Germany or the Budapest Ragtime Band from Hungary. For
country-western jazz, it's Igor's Cowboy Jazz Band. The Bay Area's polished
Royal Society Jazz Orchestra specializes in early '20s jazz.;    Other crowd
favorites to check out are Mr. Jack Daniel's Original Silver Cornet Band and
Big Tiny Little. And when you've heard "Do You Know What It Means to Miss New
Orleans" 57 times, you'll know it's time to head home.;    -- Linda Zavoral  </TEXT>

THE GREAT NEW AGE OF CRAIG HUXLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1967, a 13-year-old actor named Craig Hundley was cast as Captain Kirk's 
nephew in an episode of television's "Star Trek." At that time he was plunging 
into dual careers as a TV actor (he won roles in "Kung Fu," "The Flying Nun" 
and "Bewitched") and as a prodigy pianist. 
</P>
<P>
Many years later he returned to the "Star Trek" saga in a very different role; 
now a successful composer in the electronic music field, he supplied some of 
the eerie sounds in the Klingon sequence of the film "Star Trek: the Motion 
Picture." He also worked on the synthesizer programming for parts of "Star Trek 
II" and was involved with the movie series through "Star Trek V." 
</P>
<P>
Today the one-time teen-age whiz, now 35, is at the center of his own musical 
and electronic empire. Now known as Craig Huxley (he wanted to identify with 
the family of philosophers), he owns a $3-million recording studio in Burbank, 
named (what else?) Enterprise. He records his own music and the music of 
countless others who use his studios; he produces and performs during many of 
the sessions, often using instruments he invented. In some cases he releases 
the results on his own New Age label, Sonic Atmospheres, or on his recently 
launched pop label, Sling Shot Records. 
</P>
<P>
During his teen years, Hundley/Huxley was identified with jazz; he even had a 
young trio that played at Shelly's Manne Hole. But at around age 20, he says, 
"I got out of jazz because I couldn't stand what fusion was doing to it. I 
found myself more interested in philosophy, and in electronics and New Age and 
the avant-garde. Then I began inventing and building instruments." 
</P>
<P>
One of his more celebrated inventions, heard during those weird interludes in 
"Star Trek" movies, is the Blaster Beam. Its sounding board resonator, along 
with magnets, strings and an 18-foot aluminum beam, can create some of the 
strangest sounds ever heard. "Some of them," says Huxley, "can be felt rather 
than heard, as they go a whole octave lower than any note on the piano." 
</P>
<P>
Though he still occasionally plays piano, Huxley's world today is populated by 
synclaviers, Yamaha TX816s, Roland Super Jupiters, a Flexitonal Clavichord and, 
of course, the Blaster Beam, all of which can be heard in "Quantum Mechanix," a 
recent album in which he took part as leader, composer, arranger, producer and 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
One of the participants in "Quantum Mechanix" is Hyman Katz, who like Huxley 
has become as much a businessman as a musician; he is now general manager of 
Sonic Atmospheres. He and Huxley jammed together as children. Katz is the son 
of noted cellist Fred Katz, who played in the original Chico Hamilton Quintet. 
</P>
<P>
Here and there in this curious and intriguing CD, along with effects that 
sometimes suggest a latter-day, toned-down counterpart of Weather Report, are 
brief reminders of Huxley's past associations: saxophonists Bud Shank and Bob 
Sheppard are heard on several tracks. For the most part, though, it's 
Spacemaster Huxley who's clearly in charge. 
</P>
<P>
More typical of Huxley's catalogue, which now includes 22 albums (all available 
on CD) are two contributions by Don Harriss, considered one of the masters of 
New Age pop, whose "Elevations," accorded good airplay and respectable sales, 
was followed by "Vanishing Points," which has earned impassioned praise from 
the likes of John Sebastian, who programs for the radio station KTWV, "the 
Wave." Harriss is a virtual one-man band, with his Steinway grand, synclavier, 
Yamaha and Macintosh computer, and with engineer Gary Chase organizing the 
synclavier programming for such Harriss pieces as "Sunlight Samples" and "The 
Rajah's Tea Party." 
</P>
<P>
"With people like Don Harriss, Michael Stearns and L. Subramaniam," says 
Huxley, "we have a great line of albums. What we have to contend with is the 
confusion about categories -- whether this or that album should be classified 
as adult contemporary, AOR (album-oriented rock) or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
"After four years of running the company we have a better product. The only 
real hang-up is distribution, which seems to be a harder problem than ever." 
</P>
<P>
But Huxley has enough other irons in the fire to minimize any need to worry 
about the evolution of his label. His studios are in constant use by other 
companies. Answering a phone call the other day, he said: "I'll have to call 
you back -- we're busy in all four studios at the moment. We have the Doobie 
Brothers in one room, Melissa Manchester in a second, Tom Jones in another, and 
the flutist Steve Kujala is making an album in the fourth." 
</P>
<P>
Before the dream of building his own studios and record companies became a 
reality, Huxley had a long run as a performer and composer in TV and movies, 
working on countless sessions with Quincy Jones, Michael Jackson, James Ingram 
and other pop biggies. 
</P>
<P>
For the movie "Dreamscape" he produced the entire sound track, working with the 
composer Maurice Jarre and programming the synthesizers. (He released the 
"Dreamscape" sound track album on Sonic Atmospheres.) Shortly afterward MGM 
hired him to co-produce the score for "2010," for which he collaborated with 
composer David Shire on a predominantly electronic score. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the pressures of his multiple operations, Huxley continues to keep his 
hand in as a composer. "I still do 'Knots Landing' about once a month, with 
Jerry Immel as co-composer, and I collaborated with Leon Ware on writing and 
producing 'Undercover,' which was the title number for Leon's album on Sling 
Shot Records." 
</P>
<P>
At present the Sling Shot label is more or less dormant, but Huxley and Katz 
have come up with a third company, Sonic Edge. "We want to use this for 
material that is, so to speak, on the cutting edge of today's developments," 
says Katz -- a surprising statement, since it would hardly seem possible for 
anything to be more contemporary than what can already be found in the Sonic 
Atmosphere lists. 
</P>
<P>
With his studios, his record companies, the composing and arranging and 
inventing and constant search for expansion and innovation, Huxley has 
succeeded in areas far beyond anything that was predicted for him during his 
years as a teen-age piano prodigy and part-time actor. 
</P>
<P>
Today he is a successful businessman, a husband, father of a 2-year-old 
daughter, and, at heart, a musician who has never forgotten the old values. 
</P>
<P>
"You know," he said, "I still play Bill Evans tapes in my car."

<TEXT>
   Naguib Mahfouz, winner of the 1988 Nobel
Prize for Literature, is a habitue of bazaar coffee shops and once
called his writing ``fourth or fifth rate.''
   Although he ranks among Egypt's most popular writers, Mahfouz's
realistic, almost Dickensian portrayals of the wretched conditions
under which his country's poor live have made his popularity less
than unanimous.
   One book of his was banned from Egypt, and another attacked
then-President Gamal Abdel Nasser's domestic and pan-Arabist
policies.
   Widely translated, he writes in Arabic but has little respect
for Arab writers, including himself. Once asked to rate his work,
Mahfouz said: ``Probably like the rest of modern Arabic literature,
fourth or fifth rate.''
   He spends an hour a day in the coffee shops of Khan Khalili,
soaking in the ambiance of one of the Middle East's oldest and
largest bazaars.
   He is widely popular throughout the region but does not relish
public acclaim.
   Mahfouz was born in Cairo in 1911, the youngest child of a
lower-middle-class family. He showed no interest in foreign
literature before he entered the King Fuad I University in 1930,
but his strongest influences in college became the
turn-of-the-century British social realist novelists and Victorian
writers.
   Scholars generally place Mahfouz's writing in three periods:
   The first featured ``Trilogy,'' a 1,500-page partly
autobiographical work he completed in 1952. That period entailed
three historical novels and then a series on social themes,
detailing the struggles of Egyptian society.
   Mahfouz's second period began in 1959, when he turned away from
social realism toward metaphysical allegory. The specialists
Marsden Jones and Hamdi Sakkut wrote in 1978 that in this period
Mahfuz ``forsook ... man in society for man in time.''
   Beginning with ``Miramar'' in 1967, which took aim at Nasser's
domestic and pan-Arabist policies, Mahfouz's third period shows a
synthesis of the first two periods.
   Mahfouz's novels are more historical chronicles than political
treatises, their only political meaning being a tangential
reflection of conditions that politics cause.
   Nevertheless, after Nasser's Free Officers Movement overthrew
the Egyptian monarchy in 1952, Mahfouz showed his displeasure by
stopping writing for seven years.
   His 1959 allegory ``Children of Gebelawi,'' which included
characters based on Adam and Eve, Moses, Jesus, Mohammed and a
modern scientist, was banned because it contained religious themes
deemed unacceptable in Arab society.
   Although he writes in Arabic, his knowledge of ancient Arabic
literature is slight. He much prefers writers of the English
language _ Joyce, Huxley, Orwell, Faulkner, Hemingway _ and Balzac,
Sartre, Proust and Camus in the French.
   He once told an interviewer that William Shakespeare, James
Joyce and Leo Tolstoy are examples of first-rate writers;
second-raters were H.G. Wells, Dickens, Thackeray, Shaw,
Galsworthy, Huxley and D.H. Lawrence.
   But he said he never had read doesn't want to read lesser
European writers than those, ``adding that he did not suppose many
Europeans would be interested in modern Arabic literature, as it
has produced only such writing.''
   John Rodenbeck, a professor of literature at the American
University in Cairo who as head of the university press was
Mahfouz's publisher for nine years, called him ``the greatest
novelist of the Arab world, living or otherwise.''
   He said Mahfouz's ``impact on prose narrative will probably be
everlasting in the Arab world.''

<HEAD>Fashion Editor Madge Garland Dies at 92</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lady Ashton, better known as Madge Garland, who
was fashion editor of English Vogue in the 1930s and founded the
Royal College of Art's Fashion School, has died, according to news
reports Wednesday. She was 92.
   She had been cared for at a London convent in recent years and
died Sunday, The Times of London reported. It gave no cause of
death and funeral details were not announced.
   She was born Madge McHarg on June 12, 1898, in Melbourne,
Australia, where her father was in business. She grew up in London
and became a journalist in the 1920s, first working for English
Vogue with novelist Aldous Huxley and photographer Cecil Beaton,
and later free-lancing for Women's Wear Daily in the United States.
   Her friends included the couturier Paul Poiret and the sculptor
Brancusi. She chose clothes for Virginia Woolf. Artists Marie
Laurencin and Edward Wolfe painted her and she was one of Beaton's
earliest subjects.
   She returned to English Vogue as fashion editor from 1933,
bringing readers the best of Paris fashion until World War II.
   She became merchandising manager for London's main department
store, Bourne and Hollingsworth, during the war and designed some
fashion. After the war, she visited the United States to study
ready-to-wear marketing methods for the British fashion industry.
   In 1947, Sir Robin Darwin of the Royal College of Art invited
her to found the first British school of fashion. As Professor
Garland, she opened the school the following year and remained at
its head until 1956. Designers David Sassoon and Gina Fratini were
among her students.
   During the 1960s, she produced five books on fashion, beauty and
the history of costumes.
   She was married briefly in the 1920s to Capt. Ewart Garland. In
1953, she married Sir Leigh Ashton, then director of Victoria and
Albert Museum. The marriage lasted less than a year although they
were not divorced until 1962. She retained the name Lady Ashton for
formal purposes.
   She had no children.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Arts: Community life - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST Sunday, Radio 4, determined to ease us out of the distress we must all
have felt at the Merseyside news, showed us lives of restraint. First, the
start of Goodbye to All That, where Simon Parkes visits artistic
communities. His first was Deya in Majorca, famous as the retreat of Robert
Graves. Even in its best days it was evidently not without its faults; the
poet Brian Patten recalled 'screaming drunks'. But quiet and, in those days,
hard of access.
An hour after this came In Search of Utopia, also about life in communities,
but of a different kind. Presenter Felicity Goodall dealt mainly with the
feelings of children in such places, where (at Bruderhof, for example)
child-care, meals and property are all communally organised, and no intimacy
is allowed until a couple are engaged. At Findhorn in the north of Scotland,
perhaps the oddest of the visits, there is communication not only with
plants but with fairies and elves, and this a religious foundation. It seems
to work; cabbages grow there up to 40 lb] More communities next week.
Until the end of March, Radio 3 is reviewing the arts of the 1920s. Here is
some of what is to come: archive recordings of literary grandees on their
contemporaries; popular music of the time, English, American, German and
even Russian; today's critics on new views of the then-current novelists;
Maria Jolas, wife of the founder of Transition, on Paris figures like
Picasso, Stravinsky and Joyce; a reappraisal of Aldous Huxley, with readings
of some of his stories. Last Sunday's talk by Vita Sackville-West on Orlando
and tomorrow's by Prince Antoine Bibesco on Proust make a good start. But
Radio 3 listeners who complain about too much talk will be very cross.
Fay Weldon's The Hole in the Top of the World on Radio 3 on Sunday is
basically a romantic piece. Matt, a famous scientist, studies the ozone
layer from a lab in the Antarctic with Nina, a young female scientist and
rival to his wife Simone, but Ms Weldon does not write basic pieces. Simone
thinks Matt to be in danger, not only from Nina, sharing his work and
contemplating marriage, but from 'the UVs' through the hole in the ozone.
The hole, Simone believes, is due not to CFCs but to all our illusions
breaking out into space. This theory is more interesting than Simone's trip
to the Antarctic lab with her toy-boy Andrew, soon seduced by Nina. Perhaps
it is basic, after all. The cast are all American, with Walter Matthau as
Matt, not one of his great performances. The co-production with LA Theatre
Works was recorded in Santa Monica under Shaun MacLoughlin.
On Thursday Radio 4 gave The Architect's Dream by Neil Rhodes. The dream was
to build a two-mile-high city, clearing all the neighbouring land, but
Ashley, the architect, retired first, and is now just building an extension
to his retired neighbour Eric's house. Eric's wife, Mildred, is as silly as
Ashley's wife Kay is bossy, and the two dislike one another within
neighbourly bounds. Eric, making a model of Ashley's dream, sensibly bashes
Mildred with a hammer. Disputes are forgotten when Ashley visits him in the
prison hospital. Kay and Mildred become mates too, and that's about all
there is. I thought the characters boring and the dialogue dull. Richard
Wortley directed.

CYBERIA: LIFE IN THE TRENCHES OF HYPERSPACE by Douglas Rushkoff Flamingo
Pounds 6.99, 320pp
The Utopian urge has been with us since Cro-Magnon man started bumping his
head on the cave ceiling, so it is hardly surprising that some people
maintain that quantum advances in information technology might give birth to
a vastly better society.
The young American journalist Douglas Rushkoff is such a believer. His
lively and informed book is an ode to computers and fibre optics, a glowing
map of a brave new world called Cyberspace.
Rushkoff defines Cyberspace as a 'consensual hallucination accessed through
the computer' - hence, anything from two people speaking by satellite link,
to a boy wandering deep in the latest virtual reality program.
For Rushkoff, Cyberspace is a realm ripe with possibilities for new human
organisation and development. It is a place potentially free of governmental
oversight and personal neuroses, where human impulses can be infinitely
perfected with the help of the microchip.
The author is at his most convincing while charting recent advances in
hardware technology and showing how these have benefited the human
imagination. For Rushkoff, the existence of a 'datasphere', where a large
number of people are plugged into one another's computers, provides an
imaginative arena of unbridled possibility.
He posits a world where business meetings and classrooms no longer require
physical proximity, where correspondence occurs without delay, where news
can be transmitted without need for media conglomerates. Rushkoff
breathlessly scans the future horizon, catching glimpses of scenarios such
as cyber-sex between two people using Virtual Reality software and 'wet',
body-reactive hard-
ware.
It is hard to argue that technology like Video Toasters, which allow us to
'sample' television shows as disc jockeys now do records, and 'wireheading',
hardware that plugs directly into the human brain, promise a whole new way
to work and play.
What Rushkoff seems to have less of a stomach for is the dark side of this
world, the dystopia in which technology is used as a means of repression and
conformity rather than liberation. Believing that 'as computer-networking
technology gets into the hands of more cyberians, historical power centers
are challenged,' he seems to forget that the reason so much power is
centralised is that the people who wield it have a knack of staying one step
ahead of the rest of us. Cyberia's relation to its Soviet namesake may be
more meaningful than just a facile pun. That said, Rushkoff's examination of
the technological aspects of Cyberspace remains essential for those
interested in the subject.
Where the book proves far less effective is in its second part, which deals
with the non-computing side of Cyberia. Smart drugs, house music and
Cyberpunk fiction are all subsumed under a tatty umbrella of New Age
thinking that would have us believe is in some way related to the
information revolution.
Rushkoff's arguments are far from convincing - one need only listen to the
monotonous drone of rave music or the cretinous babble of a 'smart drug'
saleswoman to understand that this is nothing more than warmed-over
hippyism. Rushkoff's prose, so lucid in the early parts of the book, becomes
unmoored and jargon-ridden as he takes us through the poorly-lit labyrinth
of 'neopaganism' and 'technoshamanism'. Where he started off largely
convincing us that a brave new world was being born, we leave the book
thinking that Cyberia is little more than an enclave for the sort of
drop-outs who have always found their utopia in the same place - anywhere
but here.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Books: Ottoline, a lady loved in fiction - Anthony Curtis
admires a stylish brand of eccentricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OTTOLINE MORRELL: LIFE ON THE GRAND SCALE by Miranda Seymour Hodder &amp;
Stoughton Pounds 25, 452 pages
'THE so-called portraits of Ottoline can't possibly be Ottoline', DH
Lawrence wrote from Florence in 1928 to the subject of this biography. It
was a letter ostensibly to commiserate with Ottoline on her 'mysterious
illness' and operation on her jaw, where cancer had been diagnosed. The
resulting shape of her chin was a hideous disfigurement of a once beautiful
woman. As well as sending a get-well-soon greeting Lawrence took the
opportunity to try to heal the 12-year-long breach in their relations.
Contact between them, initially so warm, had ceased abruptly on the
appearance of Women in Love.
Almost all the novelists whom Ottoline entertained in her celebrated salon
in Bedford Square before the First World War, and at Garsington Manor during
and after the War, found her stylish brand of eccentricity an irresistible
challenge. Ottoline, a half-sister of the Duke of Portland, was a maze of
contradictions - simultaneously an aristocrat, an aesthete and an artists'
groupie.
Aldous Huxley put her into three of his books: as Priscilla Wimbush in Crome
Yellow (1921) - where she appears against the background of a typical
Garsington weekend; as Mrs Aldwinkle in Those Barren Leaves (1925); as Mrs
Bidlake in Point Counter Point (1928). Virginia Woolf embellished letters to
friends they had in common and her journal with some coruscating vignettes
of 'Ott'. Miranda Seymour believes that there is also more than a hint of
Ottoline in Clarissa Dalloway. Graham Greene confessed to borrowing Ottoline
for Lady Patricia Bury in Its A Battlefield.
Osbert Sitwell in Triple Fugue (1924) called her Lady Septugesima Goodley.
The name guys Ottoline's lifelong passion for do-gooding. It had been
sparked by Charles Kingsley, whose books she loved as a child and who was a
friend of her parents, the Bentincks. Readings from Thomas a Kempis
confirmed her ambition to occupy the high moral ground. Height was indeed
what immediately struck you on meeting Ottoline. As Sitwell put it: she was
so tall she looked like 'an animated public monument' and with a voice that
resembled the 'peaceful lowing of cattle and the barbed drone of wasp and
hornet'.
Miranda Seymour also cites obscure Otto-novels by Gilbert Cannan, 'JA
Revermort' (John Cramb), the Australian-born music critic WJ Turner, and the
Irish actress Constance Malleson, Ottoline's rival in the great game of
being bedded by Bertie Russell. This the actress eventually won, but only
after a series of strenuous heats. Ottoline had ditched the painter Henry
Lamb as her lover for the more intellectual allurements of the philosopher.
Ottoline shrugged off the lesser fictional caricatures. It was Lawrence's -
Ottoline as Hermione Roddice ('. . . she had no natural sufficiency, there
was a terrible void, a lack, a deficiency of being within her . . . ', etc.
etc.') - that left the lasting wound. But in that belated olive-branch
letter Lawrence did his best to restore Ottoline's self-esteem. 'And in the
world today', he continued, 'full of women, how rare to find one that can
move the imagination] No, I wish, and wish deeply, there could be Ottoline
again and Garsington again, and we could start afresh'.
Crocodile tears? Lawrence had at that moment just completed a new novel. It
concerned a married woman with a title who had a passionate affair with a
game-keeper on her estate and he felt sure that Ottoline would understand
what he was trying to do in it - 'the re-entry into life' he told her 'of a
bit of the old phallic awareness and the old phallic insouciance.' Could
this, Miranda Seymour asks, have been yet one more fictional go at Ottoline
herself?
The parallels between Ottoline and Lady Chatterley are in some respects
close. Ottoline's relations with her husband Philip Morrell, the lawyer and
Liberal MP by whom she had a daughter, soon became companionable rather than
passionate. Though not disabled like Clifford Chatterley, Philip did suffer
from bouts of mental illness that had probably prevented him from reaching
ministerial rank; even though Asquith was a personal friend of theirs who
enjoyed meeting literati like Desmond MacCarthy on the Garsington lawn, he
never promoted Morrell
After Ottoline ceded Russell to the Irish actress she had what her
biographer believes to be the only truly satisfactory sexual liaison of her
life. It was with a local Oxfordshire stone mason - Lionel Gomme, always
known in her journals as 'Tiger' - who had come to mend a damaged plinth in
the garden at Garsington. It wasn't only the statue around which he put his
arms and relocated.
Clearly a woman of this calibre, reflected in so much of 20th-century
fiction and its annals, deserves a biography. There was a life of her
published in 1976, but much new material has become available since then.
Unlike the previous biographer, Miranda Seymour has a double-focus: on Ott
in the foreground and, in the middle distance, on her ever-changing circle
of eminent friends.
Sybil Colefax certainly entertained as many, if not more, celebrated people
in her time; but she was, at heart, a mere collector. Ottoline, for all her
absurdities, was an inspiration. From an early age she saw her role as one
of helping creative people to realise themselves, and in this regard her
discernment was exceptional and her altruism tireless - even though,
contrary to general belief, the Morrells were never really rich. Among the
many writers she encouraged when they were unknown was Henry Green, who paid
a memorable tribute to her after her death in 1938 aged 64.
What Ottoline had not quite bargained for was the astonishing vindictiveness
of the inhabitants of the London literary world, their compulsion to bite
the hand that feeds them. In Ottoline's far too forbearing case she would
often continue feeding someone after he or she had snapped at her. She was
immensely supportive of Roger Fry when he was being reviled for organising
the first post-impressionist exhibition in London, and she helped him in the
formation of the Contemporary Art Society. They became great friends until
he turned on her viciously because someone had spread the rumour that he was
in love with her. The other Bloomsberries followed suit in undermining her
reputation.
Logan Pearsall Smith had more cause for hatred since his sister was
Russell's first wife. But luckily Ottoline acquired new friends as easily as
she shed old ones. She made much of the Oxford connection. A visit to
Garsington was essential for any undergraduate with literary leanings in the
Brideshead years. Evelyn Waugh, Peter Quennell, David Cecil, LP Hartley,
Eddy Sackville-West, Robert Gathorne-Hardy and Anthony Powell were among her
visitors.
Miranda Seymour is infinitely more successful here than she was in her
previous group-book, Ring of Conspirators, concerning Henry James and his
circle at Rye. Here, there really was a ring of conspirators who did what
they did in envy of great Ottoline. They are all seen off the premises
brilliantly.

ROBERT BRIDGES: A BIOGRAPHY
by Catherine Phillips
Oxford Pounds 25, 363 pages
LARKIN gave Bridges five entries in The Oxford Book of Twentieth Century
English Verse and that seems about right compared (say) with Yeats's 20. 'A
Passery-By' and 'April 1885' show Bridges at his solemnly rhetorical best;
the much anthologised 'London Snow' reveals his skill at delineating
landscape and in matching sound to sense; and 'Poor Poll' his humorous
virtuosity with the long syllabic line, incorporating sentences in Latin,
Greek, German, Italian and French into its texture.
Then Larkin ends with 'Ethick,' part of the final section of The Testament
of Beauty containing Bridges' thoughts on prayer. That poem in four parts -
an extended paean as much to Reason as to Beauty, published in 1929 - was
Bridges' swan-song. By then, he was a vigorous 85-year-old poet laureate,
awarded the OM by King George V to whom the Testament is dedicated.
Its sales took the Clarendon Press at Oxford by surprise. They originally
printed around 2,000 copies, but 19,000 had been sold by January 1930 and it
went through edition after edition until the mid-1940s. It went out of
fashion as Eliot's Four Quartets, a similar kind of poem, came in.
The face Bridges presents to us in his work, and in the photographs
contained in this biography, is that of a Georgian man of letters par
excellence. He belonged to the last generation of poets before modernism
took over and subversion of the social order through literary work became
the norm. In Bridges, we have a supreme example of the writer, not as any
kind of rebel, but as a respectable member of society helping to prop up its
foundations.
Bridges combined this with deep concern for the purity of the English tongue
and a zeal to reform our language's illogical spelling. That campaign, which
involved the Oxford Press trotting out several new typographical symbols in
order to print his Society for Pure English pamphlets in his private
alphabet, came to nought.
Ezra Pound, who was a contemporary, admired one or two of Bridges' lyrics.
The two men met and Bridges - of whose charm of manner Catherine Philips
gives examples - went through Pound's Personae and Exultations helpfully,
commenting on the style.
Afterwards, though, Pound could not resist putting in the boot. 'I spose,'
he wrote in a note to TS Eliot, 'I can cite what I once said of Britches? I
managed to dig about 10 lines of Worse Libre out of one of his leetle
bookies.'
It is characteristic Poundage: highly amusing and grossly unfair. Bridges
was not a particular champion of vers libre and his 'leetle bookies' are
full of examples of a consummate use of rhyme and other meticulously
executed metrical forms. As a poet, Bridges was not in the least complacent;
he experimented continually, at one stage taking classical prosody as his
model.
Beginning in 1912, Bridges' reign as poet laureate was long and prestigious,
but he has had bad luck since. He is remembered by the literary world not as
a poet in his own right but as the friend and literary executor of Hopkins,
especially as the individual responsible for preventing Hopkins' work from
seeing the light of day fully until the end of the First World War.
Many years after Hopkins' death. Bridges wrote to Hopkins' mother and
explained that it was because he himself was trying to write poems in sprung
rhythm that he did not wish the poetry-reading public to have - for the
present, at any rate - the confusing example of Hopkins' eccentric use of
it.
Was Bridges merely being self-seeking in this most controversial decision of
his life? Bridges' latest biographer has a foot in both camps, being also
the editor of the Oxford Authors' edition of Hopkins and of his selected
letters. Phillips suggests, somewhat tentatively, that it was more a case of
Bridges being naive and perhaps a little arrogant than of anything else.
Bridges admired the work of his old Oxford contemporary and friend but,
having rescued it from the Jesuits, did not see just what a poetic bombshell
he was sitting on. It was only after the great success of Bridges' wartime
anthology The Spirit of Man (1916) - a fascinating insight into Bridges'
eclectic taste in literature and philosophy, in which he published some of
Hopkins' poems alongside Rimbaud's - that he felt the time was ripe for an
edition of them.
Phillips does not allow the relations with Hopkins to take up a
disproportionate share of this carefully written life. She traces Bridges'
early years - after his education at Eton and Oxford - as a doctor,
including a spell in the casualty department at a top London hospital. There
followed his happy marriage to Monica, daughter of Alfred Waterhouse, the
architect.
Bridges met his wife through living on Waterhouse's estate at Yattendon,
near Newbury. After that came Bridges' decision to give up medicine and
become a full-time poet and essayist. Like Maugham's similar decision, it
eventually paid off.
When Waterhouse died, the couple used some of their inheritance to build a
permanent home they called Chilswell on Boar's Hill. Once they were
established there (surviving a disastrous fire), Oxford welcomed Bridges
back into the academic and musical fold with honorary fellowships, recitals
and dining rights. Bridges' early friendships with late Victorians like
Henry Newbolt, Digby Mackworth Dolben and Canon Richard Watson Dixon are
balanced at the other end of the scale by his exchanges with Bloomsberries
like EM Forster and Clive Bell.
Let us leave him entertaining Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley and Ottoline
Morrell on Boar's Hill. Woolf writes that Bridges 'sprang from a
rhododendron bush, a very lean tall old man with a curly grey hat and a
reddish ravaged face, smoky fierce eyes, with a hazy look in them; very
active, rather hoarse, talking incessantly.' This book serves him well in
the quiet, painstaking, scholarly way he would, surely, have appreciated.

MRS. HUMPHRY WARD; EMINENT VICTORIAN, PREEMINENT EDWARDIAN BY JOHN SUTHERLAND 
(OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $24.95; 432 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jenny Uglow, Uglow's most recent books are George Eliot (Pantheon) and The 
International Dictionary of Women's Biography (Continuum). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On April 10, 1920, Virginia Woolf noted in her diary, "Mrs. Ward is dead; poor 
Mrs. Humphry Ward; and it appears that she was merely a woman of straw after 
all -- shovelled into the grave and already forgotten." 
</P>
<P>
Mary Ward had been dead two weeks. Seventy years later, although largely 
unread, she is not altogether forgotten, and John Sutherland's bold 
disinterment of this prolific writer and prodigious personality who towered 
over Victorian and Edwardian England makes enthralling reading. 
</P>
<P>
At the height of her fame, Mrs. Humphry Ward, as she always styled herself 
(less a gesture of matronly modesty than a claim to masculine authority), 
commanded vast readerships and vast advances on both sides of the Atlantic. 
From 1888, America was swamped by competing pirate editions of "Robert 
Elsmere," her mammoth novel of religious doubt. To her horror, free copies were 
given away with Maine's Balsam Fir Soap, described by Sutherland, with typical 
dryness, as "a newly launched product which wished to impress on consumers the 
literal truth of cleanliness being next to godliness." 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland compares the novel's American success to that of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" 
in Britain, both nations being virtuously fascinated by problems they did not 
have to face. The issue now raised, in Oliver Wendell Holmes' words, was the 
long-needed purging of "the obstructed channels of the decrepit theological 
system," and even, so it was thought, the separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the excitement was caused by the reaction of Gladstone, the British 
prime minister to whom the book represented a dangerous national trend toward 
agnosticism. He wrote a long, vehement, essay, "Robert Elsmere, and the Battle 
of Belief," and, obsessed by the book, demanded a private interview with its 
author on the evening after her mother's death. Their passionate argument was 
resumed at breakfast; she left "the wonderful old man" white-faced, leaning on 
the table, while she, trembling but unbeaten, went to follow the hearse. 
</P>
<P>
The encounter typifies more than Mary Ward's love of a good fight. She wrote, 
Sutherland suggests, precisely to prove herself to men of authority and power 
like Gladstone; the heirs of her grandfather, Thomas Arnold of Rugby: Jowett, 
Pattison and Pater at Oxford and J. R. Green in London; and above all, her own 
errant, backsliding father, Tom, and her uncle, Matthew Arnold. Her best novels 
-- "Robert Elsmere," "Marcella" and the fine "Helbeck of Bannisdale" -- 
re-worked not only her own experience but the religious rifts that drove her 
parents, and her age, apart. 
</P>
<P>
"Uncle Matt" memorably dismissed Mary's first novel, "Miss Bretherton," 
published in 1884: "No Arnold can write a novel; if they could, I should have 
done it" -- doubly cruel, since she so wanted acceptance as a true Arnold. 
Nonetheless, she went on to become, in Sutherland's phrase, a "fiction 
machine," churning out novels to support her family. 
</P>
<P>
Her earnings were high, and her fiction was serialized for top prices in 
America in the Century, Harpers and the Ladies' Home Journal (whose cheap 
presentation galled her pride while it filled her purse). But rather than 
helping her family, she may have crushed them instead. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband Humphry, art critic of the Times of London, took refuge in buying 
old masters (often fakes) and playing billiards at the Athenaeum. Refusing to 
enfranchise her clever daughters, Mary heaped her ambitions on her son, the 
ominously christened Arnold: Ineffectual in politics, disgraced in the army, 
his gambling debts absorbed all she had so laboriously gained. 
</P>
<P>
Irony also marks Mary Ward's other achievements. A founder of Somerville, the 
first women's college in Oxford, in 1879, she went on to become the tireless 
leader of the Anti-Suffrage Movement and to write a virulently anti-suffragist 
novel, "Delia Blanchflower." She opened two settlements for the London poor 
(University Hall and the Passmore Edwards Settlement), started the day-center 
movement and introduced schools for the physically handicapped, but spent her 
last years among the Hertfordshire gentry, a staunch Conservative and 
imperialist. 
</P>
<P>
A final flourish of transatlantic fame followed her vivid, jingoistic accounts 
of life in the trenches. The first of these, "England's Effort," was written in 
response to a suggestion made in December of 1915 by her friend, former 
President Theodore Roosevelt, that articles from Mary Ward, who was at the 
time, Sutherland says, "the best-known Englishwoman in America," might help him 
to swing American opinion in favor of entering the war. 
</P>
<P>
What lay behind her urgent, swerving career? In 1856, when she was 5, her 
family returned to England after Tom Arnold's first swing to Catholicism had 
put an end to a promising career as education secretary in Tasmania. When her 
parents, with her younger brothers and sisters, decamped to live under John 
Henry Newman's wing in Dublin, Mary was left stranded in Westmoreland with her 
Arnold grandmother. Lonely and fiery-tempered, she struggled through grim 
boarding schools for the next 10 years until she rejoined her family, by now 
established in Oxford. From then on, Sutherland portrays her as driven by a 
desperate need to be "at the center" -- of Oxford, London, the nation. 
</P>
<P>
Steely self-will and hidden vulnerability were blended in her dealings with her 
family, her publishers and her political allies. All are meticulously 
chronicled here. 
</P>
<P>
Sutherland's approach, though cool and unblinkered, is consistently 
sympathetic; yet even he sometimes displays an appalled fascination at his 
subject's monstrous energy, all the more striking since she was wracked by 
constant, devastating illnesses (which, like those of Josephine Butler or 
Florence Nightingale, often proved strategically useful). She battled on 
against all odds, dosing herself with remedies that would make a pharmacist 
pale, including a cherished hoard of "cocaine lozenges." 
</P>
<P>
As the Great War ended, younger writers -- Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, H. 
G. Wells, Rebecca West -- attacked or ridiculed "Mrs H. W." as the embodiment 
of the most stifling Victorian values. Their hostility was a measure of her 
power. Even 16 years after she died, her nephew Aldous Huxley drew her as the 
smothering Mrs. Foxe in "Eyeless in Gaza." 
</P>
<P>
She left no literary heirs, and in that sense she was, as Woolf said, "a woman 
of straw." But "splendid" was Mary Ward's favorite adjective -- and splendid, 
in an awesome, even tragic way -- is exactly what she was.

TECHNOLOGY SERVED THE CAUSE OF LIBERATION IN EAST EUROPE. THE POWER OF 
INFORMATION IS CLEAR, BUT IS IT DEMOCRATIZING?

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
1989 was the year George Orwell was proved wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Television, it has turned out, is not the ultimate tool of repression. 
</P>
<P>
In the year that Eastern Europe surged toward democracy, communications 
technology served the cause of liberation. The stories trickle in from country 
after country -- of Solidarity videotapes secretly screened in Polish church 
basements, of Cable News Network broadcasts picked up by satellite dishes in 
Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as Europe reshapes itself, the question is whether the opposite is true: 
</P>
<P>
Is technology actually democratizing? As the Eastern Bloc moves further toward 
economic modernization, does democracy become inevitable? 
</P>
<P>
The ultimate answer may be long in coming. The information revolution has 
barely begun in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
More than that, some believe Orwell's only mistake in his novel "1984" was 
thinking that television exercises control by inflicting pain. Maybe, as Aldous 
Huxley suggested, TV controls by inflicting pleasure -- a notion that might 
produce the advertising expert as political kingmaker and the pitchman as 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
But what is clear, and still largely unappreciated, is that the fall of the 
Iron Curtain was at least in part a revolution of technology. 
</P>
<P>
It was the need to modernize in the technological age that forged Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms in the first place. The act of 
modernizing then granted people access to the outside world that fueled their 
discontent -- and later helped their underground movements escape detection. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, Gorbachev's challenge now is largely technological: How can he 
maintain political control while embracing technology that will decentralize 
information and undermine central authority? 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, Solidarity leader Lech Walesa asked the question differently: "Is it 
possible for a new Stalin to appear today who could murder people?" In an era 
of computers and satellite TV, he concluded, "It's impossible." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly technology is not the single cause of change in Eastern Europe. 
Events of such sweep require a confluence of factors, from the talents of 
Mikhail Gorbachev to the aging of the postwar generation that embraced 
communism, from mounting ethnic strife to -- perhaps most critically -- the 
growing economic gap with the West. 
</P>
<P>
But today economic opportunity goes hand in hand with technology. "These 
reforms are a result of civilization -- of computers, satellite TV (and other 
innovations) that present alternative solutions," Walesa told a recent luncheon 
gathering of journalists from the Washington Post and Newsweek. Gorbachev and 
he, Walesa said, "just happen to be people in the right time in the right 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
He is right that throughout the last decade, technology seemed the servant of 
revolution, not of repression. 
</P>
<P>
One of the first cases actually was in Iran. The Islamic revolutionary 
underground used audio cassettes to circulate the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's 
speeches throughout Iran, where one in four citizens was either working for or 
informing to the shah's secret police. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the use of technology for revolution spread to the very medium 
Orwell had seen as the ultimate tool of suppression -- television. 
</P>
<P>
Orwell feared the medium because it was centrally controlled, perfect for an 
authoritarian regime he called Big Brother. But in the 1980s the nature of the 
medium changed, at least in degrees, with the spread of satellite technology 
and videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Irresistible Machines 
</P>
<P>
Videocassette recorders gave people some choice over what they could watch and 
allowed them to interact, even record their own images. So irresistible did the 
machines become to Eastern Europeans that they were allowed even in the most 
closed societies, such as Romania. In 1988, the Soviet daily newspaper Izvestia 
talked about "the currently fashionable passion for videotapes." 
</P>
<P>
The effect was distinctly political, even if people were mainly watching 
Western films on videotape. "Blue jeans and rock music and the message of 
possibility . . . the underlying message of being an individual," these were 
the subliminal political cues of the VCR, said Jessica Lipnack, whose 
consulting firm, the Networking Institute, studies the impact of technology on 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
In Poland, where the opposition was better organized, the VCR became a way of 
sustaining an underground, not merely fueling dissent. Solidarity kept itself 
alive from 1981 to 1988, among other means, by making video documentaries -- 
everything from biographies of Solidarity leaders to documentaries about 
demonstrations the official media tried to dismiss -- and screening them in 
secret in church basements and community centers. 
</P>
<P>
Another force undermining government control of television was satellite 
technology. Those who had satellite dishes -- some of them homemade -- could 
receive programming from anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Channel 
</P>
<P>
One of the most watched channels was the U.S. Cable News Network, which CNN 
executive vice president Ed Turner said was received in government offices in 
several East Bloc countries. 
</P>
<P>
"Even second-level and third-level managers and clerks can see another way of 
life," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
And when CNN correspondents arrived in such capitals as Bucharest, Sofia and 
Budapest, they were viewed as celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
The political impact of satellites was most profound in Hungary and Poland, 
where the manufacture and purchase of satellite dishes were legal. 
</P>
<P>
The effect, even if only the elite class had the dishes, was to force Polish 
and Hungarian official television to either become more open or become 
irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
When Poland instituted martial law in 1981, media-savvy Poles were already 
disgusted enough with official media that they moved their TV sets to face out 
of their windows as a silent protest. 
</P>
<P>
By 1985, the Polish media had changed so much that the government signed a 
contract to air a nightly half-hour newscast from CNN. Among other things, that 
program forced Polish television to dump its longtime anchor for someone more 
telegenic. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was what experts have taken to calling "spillover" viewing. 
</P>
<P>
People in East Berlin could watch West German TV. They watched Austrian TV in 
Hungary, Finnish TV in Soviet Estonia and the liberalized Polish TV all over, 
in East Germany, Czechoslovakia and parts of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The spillover viewing forced the "democratization of official Soviet TV," said 
Adrian Karatnycky, research director for the AFL-CIO, which was instrumental in 
supplying technology and funding to Solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
In Timisoara, Romania, ethnic Hungarians saw the liberalized Hungarian 
television and could watch news each night about the changes elsewhere in 
Eastern Europe. That was one reason, some think, that the Romanian revolution 
started in Timisoara. 
</P>
<P>
And so the media became the force behind the domino, as the Poles inspired the 
Hungarians, the Hungarians inspired the East Germans and the East Germans 
inspired the Czechoslovaks. 
</P>
<P>
"What happened in Poland could not be kept silent. Everybody saw it," said 
Gordon Schultz of the Walker Center, an ecumenical group working to support 
democratic change in China and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the power of the video and satellite underground was that, unlike 
Western radio broadcasts such as Radio Free Europe and the British Broadcasting 
Corp., it offered visual proof that made its message undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
And it was indigenous. It did not bear the stigma of originating with the 
American government. 
</P>
<P>
Less important in Eastern Europe were fax machines. But they played a major 
role in China. 
</P>
<P>
The Walker Center estimates that during the democracy movement last spring, 
there were 30,000 fax machines in China, many of them in private businesses, 
and 3 to 4 million phone lines in Beijing alone. Schultz said the fax machines 
provided a crucial way for reformers to communicate with the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't think people in the rest of world know or care that you are 
giving up your life," Schultz said, "you are much less likely to give it up." 
</P>
<P>
And in some countries there were even computers. 
</P>
<P>
John Micgiel, assistant director of the Institute on East Central Europe at 
Columbia University, estimates there are now 1.5 million personal computers in 
Poland, probably the highest number in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
On occasion, Solidarity even tried to transmit lists of technical needs to the 
West on computers in secret code, according to Karatnycky of AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
Taken together, technology aided the surge toward democracy by offering people 
"knowledge that there was a better life beyond their borders," said Richard 
Perle, a former assistant secretary of defense who is now at the American 
Enterprise Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Technology offered people hope by letting them know they had support in the 
West. It gave them the power to communicate, without detection by the 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Catch-22' Seen 
</P>
<P>
And on a deeper level, technology also proved to be a fundamental cause of the 
democratic movement. Laurien Alexandre, director of global studies at the 
Immaculate Heart College Center in Los Angeles, sees a "Catch-22" in the 
Eastern European Communist regimes' need for technology to compete economically 
with the West. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as you integrate these technologies into your economy and make them 
available to a larger range of people, you develop an information middle class 
who are not part of your leadership," Alexandre said. "And this stuff you can't 
control. You can't close down the fax machines because your economy will stop." 
</P>
<P>
S. Frederick Starr, the Soviet scholar who is president of Oberlin College, 
calls the result "technocratic glasnost." 
</P>
<P>
"Privatized information stimulates the formation of public opinion" and 
"induces individuation," Starr has written in an essay still unpublished. 
Subjects became citizens. Their world became more international. 
</P>
<P>
Technology, in other words, bred pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
And once the technology became decentralized, controlling it would have exacted 
a high price, economically and politically. As Wilson Dizard of the Center for 
Strategic and International Studies put it, "You don't pull out the phone 
system." Thus, Dizard said, "whether Gorbachev lasts or not, it will last." 
</P>
<P>
But if technology is not inherently suppressive, it is also not perfectly 
democratizing. 
</P>
<P>
If it were, logically television and computers would have improved democracy in 
America. Instead, they seem to have brought on an era of media consultants, 
negative campaigning and the science of sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
Even apart from the American experience, not all technology is inherently 
democratizing. The fax machine, for instance, is actually no more secure from 
being monitored than any phone line, said Kenneth Flamm of the Brookings 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
Monitoring fax machines requires technology to record and then decode the fax 
transmissions. And in China, where technology is scarce, that was difficult. 
Still, about two weeks after massacring protesters in Tian An Men Square, the 
Chinese government managed to quash the fax underground by stationing a guard 
near most of the fax machines in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
More complex is television. While it was made more democratic and interactive 
by satellites and videocassettes and small cameras, it is still largely a 
centrally controlled medium. In most countries in the world, indeed, television 
is government-run. 
</P>
<P>
So some analysts say one factor that will determine the new face of Eastern 
Europe is which factions control the television stations, and whether they will 
allow open and pluralistic programming. 
</P>
<P>
"That fight is going on now," said Dizard, who has written extensively about 
the information revolution. 
</P>
<P>
And the outcome, he said, will be determined by internal politics more than by 
technology. The strong tradition of a healthy underground press in Poland, for 
instance, was one of the reasons that Solidarity was able to survive in secret, 
experts said. The same traditions are not nearly so strong in Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
If any technology possesses intrinsically liberating qualities, those who study 
politics and communications believe it is the computer. 
</P>
<P>
Computers empower the individual, granting access to vast resources of 
information. "You can crunch a hundred pages onto a floppy disc, reproduce it 
cheaply and disseminate it to thousands," said Flamm of Brookings. "Compare 
that even to a Xerox machine." 
</P>
<P>
To date, however, there are not enough computers in Eastern Europe even to help 
modernize those countries' economies, let alone to dictate democratic social 
organization, those familiar with technology there report. 
</P>
<P>
And the other forms of communications technology are also in short supply. A 
month ago, Karatnycky of the AFL-CIO tried to fax some information to the 
Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry, only to find that "there are no fax machines in 
the Foreign Ministry in Czechoslovakia." 
</P>
<P>
"There is a long way to go," conceded Eric Chenoweth, who is studying the 
information revolution in the Eastern Bloc for the American Federation of 
Teachers and who believes that democracy is inevitable if technology advances 
quickly enough. 
</P>
<P>
Nor does technology eliminate the other sources of authority. 
</P>
<P>
Even if communism can no longer demand total conformity, said Walter Raymond, 
assistant director of the U.S. Information Agency, "that doesn't mean you don't 
have a state power structure that keeps the troops in line." 
</P>
<P>
And not everyone is convinced of the microchip's democratizing qualities in the 
first place. Karatnycky of the AFL-CIO believes technology may have abetted 
reform in the 1980s simply because "these guys are much more clever and 
technology-oriented than the ossified elites they were confronting." 
</P>
<P>
Technology can still be used to maintain central control, he said. "Computers 
can be used to keep track of dissidents." 
</P>
<P>
Orwell's only mistake may have been in predicting the means by which television 
controlled the population, argued Neil Postman, author of "Amusing Ourselves to 
Death," a scathing critique of the social impact of televison in America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Trivial Culture 
</P>
<P>
"In Orwell's book," Postman said, "people are controlled by inflicting pain." 
The truth, he said, may be closer to Aldous Huxley's vision, in which people 
are controlled by inflicting pleasure. "Huxley argues that you can control 
people by making their culture essentially trivial," Postman said. 
</P>
<P>
The experience of the United States supports Postman's argument. As the power 
of the centralized political parties has waned, individual politicians have 
learned to use the media to practice a more subtle form of influence and 
manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
Thus "spin control" could replace the old Communist technique of airbrushing 
people out of photographs -- a technique rendered obsolete by satellites and 
VCRs. Conducting sophisticated studies of survey research to better manipulate 
public opinion could replace the old-fashioned technique of registering 
typewriters. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, that is the path Gorbachev seems to be following, scholars such as 
Dizard and Starr argue. Gorbachev's great insight, said Postman, is that "he 
understood at some level that it was no longer possible to have a closed 
society," thanks to forces in place long before he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
That is one explanation of why he founded two major institutes, complete with 
25 regional centers, to study public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
They even measure Gorbachev's popularity rating now. 
</P>
<P>
But the tools of modern pluralistic politics do not guarantee success. Poland's 
leaders founded an institute to study public opinion in 1983 -- two years 
before Gorbachev came to power. Czechoslovakia and Hungary started public 
opinion institutes in 1988. Yet the governments of all three countries fell in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's "calculated gamble," said Dizard, is that Soviet leadership can 
move toward a pluralistic society "and still keep essential control." 
</P>
<P>
Dizard, for one, does not like the Soviet leaders' odds: "The long-term answer 
is they are not going to be able to."

You cannot escape themes these days. This is British Science Week and Radio
3 is having a 1930s season. One programme manages to fit under both
headings: Yesterday's Tomorrows looks back to a time when, it is claimed,
'there was no science fiction but there was scientific romance' from HG
Wells to Aldous Huxley (9.30 R3). Before that Radio 3 offers an opportunity
to hear Let 'Em Eat Cake, a musical by George and Ira Gershwin, first
performed in 1933. This production stars Denis Quilley, Kim Criswell and
Joss Ackland (7.30).
There is more evidence of British Sience Week on BBC2, which is mounting
four discussions on successive nights at Bristol's science museum, The
Exploratory which is also the title of the series. Today's subject is why
some people win Nobel Prizes while others are ostracised (11.15).
Earlier Horizon looks back to the extraordinary hullabaloo which followed
the claim five years ago that fusion had been achieved in water by
Fleischmann and Pons in a test tube in an ordinary lab (8.00 BBC2).

THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTION INSPIRED A RENAISSANCE IN
DESIGN FOR THE THEATER. LESS THAN 25 YEARS LATER
THE NEW SOVIET STATE WOULD SNUFF IT OUT  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Theater; See also related article on page 19 of this section.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "Theater in Revolution: Russian Avant-Garde Stage Design 1913-35" (opening
Saturday and running through Feb. 16 at the California Palace of the Legion of
Honor) tackles the important contribution of early Soviet artists to
contemporary theater, where their work was truly revolutionary.;   Futurists
all, they saw art as the way to betterment, an upward vector in the maelstrom
of civil war, political turmoil, revolutionary splinter groups and economic
chaos that characterized the first years of the new Bolshevist state.;   "Art
is a powerful means of infecting those around us with ideas, feelings and
moods," said Anatolii Lunacharsky, the new Soviet republic's Commissioner of
Enlightenment, in a proclamation quoted in the exhibit catalog. "Agitation and
propaganda acquire particular acuity and effectiveness when they are clothed
in the attractive and mighty forms of art.";   Especially in theater, as well
as the related disciplines of opera and ballet, these artists turned the world
upside down -- a masculine inversion sorely needed after the woolly femininity
of the Mauve Decade. Theater has never looked back.;   Except in the Soviet
Union. Less than 25 years later, the artistic establishment, held in the
brutal grip of politics, turned on itself in an unprecedented act of
self-hatred. Repudiating its former brilliance, it instituted a system as
reactionary as it had been progressive, as trivial as it had been profound, as
simplistic as it had been intelligent.;   It was easy to fix the bracketing
dates of the exhibit, explained its organizer, Nancy van Norman Baer of the
Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. "Victory Over the Sun," a 1913 opera with
music by Mikhail Matiushin and design by Kazimir Malevich, was virtually a
manifesto of the new Soviet art: forward-looking, aggressive, complex and
bold. As for the ending: By 1935, the creeping petrifaction of socialist
realism, whose doctrines had been first set forth by the Union of Soviet
Writers three years earlier, reached the theater.;   THE premise of "Theater
in Revolution" would be striking enough if the art came from Western museums.
(In fact, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco's substantial holdings of
work by Russian emigre designers who created for Serge Diaghilev and the
Ballets Russes were shown in 1986 and 1988.) But the 260 pieces showcased here
come from the Bakhrushin State Central Theatrical Museum in Moscow, a
bittersweet irony that viewers will only half savor.;   The museum is itself a
metaphor of the course of Soviet art over 7 1/2 decades of Soviet politics.
Established in 1894 by Alexei Bakhrushin, an avid collector of theatrical
memorabilia, it became a government institution in 1913 and a Soviet one in
1919, when Lenin renamed the museum for its founder.;   But by 1924, the witch
hunt that followed Lenin's death found Bakhrushin, who had indulged his hobby
with money inherited from his merchant family. A workers' commission called
him "a class enemy of the worst kind," and the collection was apportioned out
to other museums.;   Despite the popular success of Bakhrushin's landmark 1927
exhibit "Theaters of the October Decade," which partly rehabilitated him, the
collection was reassembled only with great difficulty. Over succeeding
decades, while the art it contained was out of official favor, it has kept
very quiet about its holdings, though the museum is officially a central
repository and archive for all the republics of the USSR.;   "They could sell
but not display" the art, said Baer, who first became aware of the magnitude
of the collection 2 1/2 years ago, when John E. Bowlt, a professor of Russian
studies at the University of Southern California, brought word of its
existence after a sabbatical in the Soviet Union. Cautiously testing the
waters of glasnost, the museum wanted to exchange exhibits with a Western
institution, and it was especially interested in the Fine Arts Museums because
of Baer's 1986 show of Nijinska memorabilia and designs.;   Baer said a
disastrous fire in the late '40s wiped out part of the collection. But it also
showed the staff's faithfulness to the museum's mission, for many of the
pieces were literally snatched from the flames. A drop-curtain rendering by
Alexandra Exter for a 1921 production of "Romeo and Juliet" at the Kamerny
(chamber) Theater has been mounted for the show with its burned edges proudly
untrimmed.;   THE show includes costume and set renderings (and 12 tabletop
scale models) by 39 artists: some as well known as Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir
Tatlin and Alexander Rodchenko, the prime movers of Suprematism; some, like
Exter, known primarily to dance historians; but most erased from the
collective memory by the shifting winds of politics.;   And there are some
surprises, such as Sergei Eisenstein, the great Soviet film director who
invented the art of montage -- itself a technique he learned from his studies
in Kabuki theater. He got his start as a designer and director at the
Proletkult (Theater of the People) in Moscow, where his first major production
-- a 1920 adaptation of Evgenii Zamiatin's "We," a dystopian novel that
inspired both George Orwell's "1984" and Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" --
was banned.;   As Russia fought its way into the 20th century through repeated
uprisings and reform movements, its theater, as one might expect, followed
suit. In the first seasons of the Moscow Art Theater, naturalism ruled:
Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard," a sweet farewell to the old order, strove with
the bitter verismo of Gorky's "The Lower Depths.";   Soon enough, as
governments fell and the censors changed sides, the theater pieces became
strident, exuberant, sardonic: Vladimir Mayakovsky's "Mystery-Bouffe" (1918),
a parody of a medieval mystery play; "Victory Over the Sun," in which the
Strongmen of the Futurity capture and subjugate the sun; "Good News for
Horses" (1922), a revue that began as a maudlin ode to a fallen equine
comrade, then turned into a series of fast-paced, jazzy cabaret acts. Gogol's
"The Inspector-General," a savage 1836 satire, was not only a favorite
candidate for revival but the inspiration for such Gogolesque take-offs as
Mayakovsky's "The Bedbug" (1929).;   Pollination of styles;   But where the
progression of themes, from naturalism to caricature, was straightforward and
bold, the mutation of style was more complex.;   Until the start of World War
I, artists traveled freely between Russia and Paris, the center of avant-garde
art. Cubism, which broke down the image into its planes and solids, and
especially the machine-worship of Italian Futurism entered the Russian
artistic bloodstream and traveled like a virus through the system.;   Exter,
for instance, rendered the costume designs for "Famira Kifared," a 1916
classical erotic tragedy, in rich swirls and cones of brooding expressionistic
color. By 1917, for the Kamerny Theater's "Salome," the geometric drapery
shows she had reworked the canons of cubism into something uniquely her own.
For "Romeo and Juliet" (1921), she reverted guiltlessly to expressionism. When
she returned to Paris and London after the war, she was far ahead of her time
in the flat, bright, cut-out geometry of her designs for the late
collaborations with choreographer Bronislava Nijinska.;   Tatlin, to cite
another, looks positively Ibsenesque in his Sturm und Drang set design for
Richard Wagner's opera "The Flying Dutchman." (Because it was never produced,
we will never know whether its crow's-nest and spars were to be real elements
of a three-dimensional, multi-level set, or a painted fantasy.) But he, too,
heard the siren song of the Futurists, and his designs for his performance-art
piece, "Zangezi" (1923), are flat, funny cartoons.;   And Rodchenko's costumes
for Eisenstein's doomed production of "We" (1920) are no more than block
prints, hardly legible to the cutters and stitchers in a costume shop. It's as
if, knowing they would never be constructed, he felt free to play with
abstraction.;   In set design, the Russians far outpaced their European
contemporaries. Until the stage experiments of Vsevolod Meyerhold and
Eisenstein and Vladimir Tairov's Kamerny Theater, theater was performed
against painted drops, literally as well as aesthetically dusty.;   The young
Soviet designers exploded tradition with glorious geometric fantasies
(Alexander Khostenko-Khostov for "Mystery-Bouffe"), fairy-tale frontispieces
(Exter's curtain and portal for the Kamerny Theater) and busy folk art
paintings in what Baer calls "molecular" style, so colorful and complicated
that actors must have disappeared right into them (Rebekka Leviton's mural for
a 1927 revival of "The Inspector-General" in Leningrad).;   The idea of a
constructed, three-dimensional set was born in the new Soviet Union's
theaters. Some of the more idealistic designs probably could never have been
built; but Tatiana Bruni's elaborate, funhouse factory for Dmitri
Shostakovich's worker's ballet, "Bolt" (1931), was produced to great acclaim,
as was Liubov Popova's stark fantasy machine of interlocked wheels for "The
Magnanimous Cuckold" (1922).;   Exter may have been the first designer to rake
the stage, and she did it for purely democratic reasons: so those sitting at
the back of the house could see. And Eisenstein was among the first to play
with environmental art, issuing gas masks to his audience and walking them
around a chemical factory that made poison gas for the scenes of "Gasworks."; 
 The dizzy sense of freedom, the idea that anything was possible, came
directly from Russia's bumpy, even dangerous political climate. Even as the
Communist Party centralized its power and the doors of progress were brutally
slammed in the faces of the Russian people, artists looked through them for
tantalizing glimpses of the future.;   Imagining the unimaginable;   As
Stalin, Zinoviev and Trotsky snarled over the bones of Lenin, the yeasty
experiments of Nikolai Foregger's MASTFOR workshop were just beginning. As
Stalin consolidated his gains and the purges began, the artists of the new
Russia continued to imagine the unimaginable long after common sense should
have told them it was time to stop. Some died not knowing the tide of history
had turned against them; others became worker ants in the new Soviet
bureaucracy.;   Saddest of all may have been what happened to Shostakovich,
whose beautiful Symphony No. 5, written after an official censure by the Union
of Soviet Composers, is defiled by the crow-eating subtitle: "A Soviet
artist's practical, creative response to just criticism." Or to Kasian
Goleizovsky, the mentor of George Balanchine, who made jazz ballets in the
'20s, saw the handwriting on the wall and in 1931 produced "One-Sixth of the
World," a rah-rah revue about the death of capitalism. If Balanchine had not
fled Russia with the Ballets Russes, he might have ended up like Goleizovsky
or the even-more-forgotten Mikhail Dyskovsky: making politically correct
propaganda like "The Red Poppy," an uplifting ballet about life on a
collective farm.;   But for a few heady years in the new Russia, nothing was
impossible.;   The art in this exhibit ranges from the very practical to the
joyously impractical. Some artists didn't know the difference; others knew and
didn't care. Their pieces are, in a real sense, limitless. They looked toward
the horizon and saw the sun rise. For them, the future was then. (box);

The chief aim of the three Sitwell siblings - Edith, Sacheverell and Osbert
 -was, according to Aldous Huxley, 'to REBEL'. But, he added, 'though a
charming idea, the steps which they are prepared to take are so small as to
be hardly perceptible.' The National Portrait Gallery's new exhibition and
accompanying catalogue (Pounds 14.95 pbk, Pounds 19.95 hbk, 240 pages)
chronicles in paintings, photographs, music, literature and letters the
Sitwell's influence in the arts of the early 20th century and leaves us
lamenting the decline of the Great English Eccentric.

<P>
Every so often, you run into an architect who uses the letters FAIA after his 
name. This means he's a "fellow" in the American Institute of Architects. 
</P>
<P>
Who are these AIA fellows? How to they get to be one? 
</P>
<P>
Is the honor a recognition of significant contributions to the field, or a pat 
on the back from an organization known for its old-boy networking? 
</P>
<P>
San Diego has about a dozen AIA fellows among the local chapter's nearly 700 
state-licensed members. They are Richard Bundy, Ward Deems, Homer Delawie, 
Harry Hallenbeck, Frank Hope Jr., William Lewis, Robert Mosher, Dale Naegle, 
Harold Sadler, Thomas Tucker, William Watson and Stan Livingston. 
</P>
<P>
While many of these architects have made significant design contributions over 
long careers, others are better-known for their work in AIA activities and 
political offices. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Become a Fellow 
</P>
<P>
Achievement in design isn't the only way to become a fellow. Several other 
categories include innovative construction methods, writing books or articles, 
educational work, service to the profession, public service, historic 
preservation, research, urban design, achievement in government and industry, 
and skill in running a practice. 
</P>
<P>
Just last month, for example, architect Ed Huxley was made a fellow, primarily 
because he founded the AIA's Monterey Design Conference in 1979. Unfortunately, 
Huxley, who moved to Canada not long ago after a lengthy career in San Diego, 
died in a plane crash on his way to the induction ceremony in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
The Monterey Design Conference has become an annual highlight on many 
architects' calendars, one of the few West Coast events where important 
architectural issues are addressed in thoughtful and innovative ways. 
</P>
<P>
Potential fellows are nominated by a local AIA committee, and selected by a 
seven-member national jury, all AIA fellows. 
</P>
<P>
For 1989, Huxley was the only new fellow from San Diego among 44 named 
throughout the United States. Architect Paul Buss, a founder of the San Diego 
firm BSHA, was also up for the honor. Buss, a past AIA president, now a 
developer with Oliver McMillan in San Diego, is known at least as well for his 
politics as his designs. He's had a prominent role in Mayor Maureen O'Connor's 
Centre City planning committee. By some accounts, he lobbied hard for his own 
nomination before he finally received it. 
</P>
<P>
Next year's nominees have just been notified by the local AIA chapter. They are 
Rob Quigley, an award-winning designer who's also had a hand in many community 
planning efforts; Doug Austin, a partner in Austin Hansen Fehlman Group, known 
for his design work, leadership role in the AIA (he is a past president) and 
the success of the firm he helped start; and Michael Wilkes, a partner in 
Delawie Bretton and Wilkes, known both for his design work and for his AIA 
leadership role -- he too is a past president. 
</P>
<P>

FT  30 OCT 93 / Books: From killer to conservationist - J D F Jones
considers Peter Scott's biography
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
PETER SCOTT: PAINTER AND NATURALIST
by Elspeth Huxley
Faber Pounds 17.50, 361 pages
IT is remarkable how some of our most famous conservationists learned their
trade - discovered their passion - in the killing fields.
Here is Peter Scott ('Because of him, more than any other single person,
animals that 40 years ago seemed doomed to extinction still exist' - Sir
David Attenborough) at play before the war: he and two friends shot a score
of ducks at Leighton Moss, rushed to the Lake District to kill two stags,
then charged back to the marsh for another 100 geese before supper.
He saw nothing untoward in this. 'They were man's traditional quarry,' he
wrote, 'and it was part of man's instinct to hunt: it was part of the birds'
instinct to be hunted' (my emphasis). To which I can only say, balderdash
and humbug.
Eventually - slowly - the sinner repented, and by the early 1950s Peter
Scott had sold his guns. Gavin Maxwell had trodden the same path, just like
those professional white hunters in Africa who, today, have become game
wardens. Perhaps our own king-in-waiting will one day follow their example
as he attends to his duties as president of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust
which, successor of the original Severn Wildfowl Trust at Slimbridge, is
Peter Scott's most concrete legacy.
But peaceful co-existence between hunters and bird-watchers was very much on
Scott's mind in the early days of the Trust. He had observed in America the
benefit of partnership between shooters and savers.
So long as a species was not endangered, the trust's annual reports could
talk about 'the notion of wildfowl as a natural resource which can be
harvested like any other crop'. It still sounds pretty rum to me, coming
from a man who committed his life to, and built his international fame upon,
a passion for geese.
Peter Scott was a famous man for 40 years. His father, of course, was even
more famous, and everyone has always assumed that it must have been a
problem for Peter to be automatically associated with the gallant Captain
who died on the way back from the South Pole.
In fact, according to this authorised biography, there seems to be next to
no evidence of a complex. On the contrary, Peter throughout his life found
every door open to him, and he had the energy to take full advantage of his
role as a golden boy of the Establishment. Elspeth Huxley's thesis is that
his father's fame was a double-edged legacy: it smoothed his path but also
confronted him with the need to achieve the highest standards. That sounds
about right.
From babyhood he mixed with the good and the great, thanks to his formidable
sculptress mother, Kathleen. At Cambridge he managed a pass degree by the
skin of his teeth - he was never an intellectual - but it was there that he
discovered wildfowl. He had a facility for drawing and, as we all know, he
became a painter, a trade which was to fund him for much of his life. The
biographer is polite: 'Although his paintings tended to be ignored or
patronised by avant-garde critics, they sold well and continued to do so for
many years to come, affording pleasure to his patrons and a comfortable
income for himself'. The print called 'Taking To Wing' sold 355,423 copies
between 1934 and 1959. Later on he saved himself exertion by making
cardboard stencils of geese in flight which he could pin to his landscape
canvases in the appropriate position.
He had a good war, in destroyers in the North Atlantic and then commanding a
steam gunboat; he also made an important contribution to the technique of
camouflage. A first marriage to the teenaged Elizabeth Jane Howard quickly
failed (his portrait of that distinguished future novelist was to grace the
jacket of Paul Gallico's best-selling The Snow Goose which he illustrated).
He almost became a Tory MP. And he was a sportsman - skating, sailing,
gliding - of world class; at the ripe age of 55 he was the British Open
Champion glider.
The war matured him, says his biographer, which hardly seems surprising. It
might be worth underlining (as she does not) that his powerful mother died
soon after. In 1945 he discovered Slimbridge, on the south bank of the
Severn, where Whitefronted geese arrived in immense numbers from Russia
every winter. This time he did not shoot. He transferred his own collection
of birds, which he had started in 1933, and the Wildfowl Trust was born.
Portly, balding, bespectacled, Peter Scott became first a national figure
and then an international committee man and lobbyist. He was a pioneer of
television nature programmes, which turned him into an indefatigable
globetrotter, but Slimbridge (and its later satellites) was his first and
true mission as he churned out the canvases to pay the bills. He was a
mighty pioneer of the Green Movement and it was inevitable that in 1961 he
should have been centrally involved in setting up the World Wildlife Fund
(now the World Wide Fund for Nature). All this, be it noted, before we knew
about acid rain and ozone holes and global warming. A voice before his time,
he wrote: 'I personally believe that all other species of flora and fauna
have as much right to their place on earth as does Homo sapiens'. It was his
lifelong crusade.
This is not a book that calls for detailed criticism. Huxley has told a long
and interesting story lucidly - no mean achievement for a writer in her
mid-80s whose first biography, the definitive life of the Kenyan Lord
Delamere, goes back nearly 60 years. She has evidently enjoyed a trusted
relationship with the family (15 years ago she wrote a biography of Captain
Scott). Peter, knighted, a Companion of Honour, Fellow of the Royal Society,
is an Establishment hero and Huxley is not the biographer to scrutinise the
emperor's clothes.
Once she asks whether he was 'too good to be true', but she prefers not to
chip too deeply into the inner man. She is unnecessarily discreet about
Kathleen's uninhibited life and, unsurprisingly, coy about the son's private
concerns, but these things need not matter: the tale of a busy, worthwhile
life, so superior in its achievement to that of the famous father, will
carry you happily through a couple of winter evenings.

<TEXT>
   Old Etonians thronged ``ye distant spires,
ye antique towers, that crown the wat'ry glade,'' and Queen
Elizabeth II came for lunch Tuesday to mark the 550th anniversary
of Eton College.
   The queen praised the school as ``second to none,'' though she
sent her three sons to Gordonstoun in Scotland. She told students
she had asked the headmaster to give them an extra holiday each
October.
   Why October? Because the actual 550th anniversary of the
foundation of Eton College by King Henry VI falls on Oct. 11.
   Eton celebrated Tuesday, a school official explained, because it
was the day before the annual June 4 holiday in honor of King
George III _ which Eton chose to celebrate on May 30.
   Eton's calendar, like its modes of speech and dress, is all its
own.
   The school long ago disposed of top hats, flogging, and the
humiliating ``bum freezer'' jackets for its shortest boys, but it
remains its own world.
   Masters are still ``beaks,'' classes are ``divs,'' rowers are
``wet bobs,'' cricketers are ``dry bobs'' and students are either
``tugs'' (King's Scholars) or ``oppidans'' (fee-paying students).
Students wear long-tailed black coats, white ties and stiff collars
in class.
   The myth of Eton is that the school, nestled in the shadow of
Windsor Castle, inculcates superiority of mind, grace and social
status.
   ``The thing Eton majors in is arrogance _ so deep-rooted it is
totally unselfconscious. It's ugly and unappealing, and I've spent
the past 30 years trying to unlearn it,'' said Mark Fisher, a Labor
Party lawmaker.
   Lord Longford says he once was interrogated by King George VI
about why he, an old Etonian, became a socialist. It came down to
``the conviction that we are all equal in the sight of God,''
Longford said. ``Well, I think Eton stands for something far
removed from that.''
   Fisher and Longford were among 50 ``old boys'' interviewed by
Danny Danziger for his recently published book, ``Eton Voices.''
   George Orwell, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Henry Fielding, Aldous
Huxley, the economist John Maynard Keynes and the poet Thomas Gray,
who wrote about ``ye distant spires,'' all attended Eton. So did a
score of prime ministers and three members of the current Cabinet.
   The Old Etonian Association had hoped to lure 8,000 old boys for
the festivities, including fireworks and a ``supper box'' priced at
about $105 but sold half that many tickets.
   John Butterwick, chairman of the Old Etonians, blamed an out of
date mailing list, and a computer that couldn't deal with titles or
the strings of honors behind some former students' names.
   Derek Malcolm, film critic of The Guardian newspaper, left Eton
feeling equal to any occasion. ``I mean, there's no higher you can
go socially,'' he told Danziger.
   Pish and tosh, says Philip Howard, literary editor of The Times
of London. ``You should see some of the diffident, insecure ...
boring Etonians I meet, if I don't see them coming first,'' he
wrote in the newspaper.
   ``I do get irritated by people who think that because we look
traditional and old-fashioned, the Establishment is hidebound and
backward-looking,'' the headmaster, Eric Anderson, told the Daily
Express.
   ``Underneath all that, it's a very modern school.''
   Nine out of 10 Etonians go on to universities, a quarter to
Oxford or Cambridge. The school has two dozen science labs, a
``beak'' for every 9.5 students and even a golf course among the
famous playing fields where, as it's said, the Battle of Waterloo
was won.
   The school has at least three applicants for each of its 1,260
places, and parents pay $14,450 a year for an education, plus those
incomparable intangibles.
   ``Being known as an Etonian is a handicap, because of false
expectations of snobbery and wealth it arouses,'' wrote Howard, who
said one of his old school companions wound up managing a bus
station.

<LEADPARA>  THE literary output of one of this century's most prolific authors will be
increased even more by the decision of the Enoch Pratt Free Library, the
financial and literary executor of the H.L. Mencken estate, to publish a
collection of the Baltimore writer's recently unsealed papers.;    Ashbel
Green, a senior editor at Alfred A. Knopf, said the publishing house expects
to choose an editor in a few weeks for the four-volume collection of papers,
titled "My Life as Author and Editor." That selection is expected to be
announced Sept. 14, during Mencken Day observances at the Enoch Pratt library,
according to library spokeswoman Averil Kadis.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I see 'My Life' as a very worthwhile, publishable book," Green said. "My
guess is that we'll publish sometime in 1993.";    "My Life as Author and
Editor" and a three-volume memoir, "Thirty-Five Years of Newspaper Work," were
unsealed at the Pratt Jan. 29 -- 35 years after the writer's death -- as he
had instructed in a memorandum to the library. They are thought to be the last
unpublished papers by "the Sage of Baltimore" and thus could have particular
literary importance, considering Mencken's status as probably the pre-eminent
American literary critic and editor in the first three decades of the 20th
century.;    Mencken himself thought so. "I knew so many American and English
authors during the 1914-1930 period that my account of them should be of
interest and use to future historians of the national literature," he wrote in
an April 1946 entry in "The Diary of H.L. Mencken," published by Knopf in
1989.;    As co-editor of the influential magazine Smart Set from 1914-1923,
he published such authors as Aldous Huxley, Somerset Maugham, James Joyce,
Theodore Dreiser, Sherwood Anderson, Willa Cather and F. Scott Fitzgerald. As
a critic, Mencken championed such authors as Dreiser and Sinclair Lewis when
it was not popular to do so.;    Green said that of the four crates of papers
that compose "My Life," "two represented his text and two were appendices." He
added: "The body as a whole runs over 2,000 pages. A lot of appendix material
is not of particular interest.";    He said the time frame "ends sometime in
the 1920s." As for the contents, not surprisingly, "There's some very pungent
commentary.";    Only a handful of people have seen the papers. They were read
by a four-person committee at the Pratt before it voted to offer the papers to
Knopf, and only a few scholars will be permitted to view them at the library
before their publication, Kadis said.;    No publisher has been found for
"Thirty-Five Years of Newspaper Work," which covers much of Mencken's career
as writer and editor with the Baltimore Sun and Baltimore Evening Sun. Green
said those papers were not offered by the library to Knopf.  </TEXT>

Last week's Assignment reported on malaria in countries such as Cambodia and
Thailand, and showed that the disease was killing 20 times as many as Aids,
yet receiving much less research money. This week's programme quotes what it
calls 'Asia's leading Aids prevention campaigner' saying that Aids is
'Asia's largest non-military security threat'. It seems that Aids spreads
through Thai brothels and 95 per cent of Thai men are said to use the
brothels (7.45 BBC2). We progressed from de Quincey to Aldous Huxley in last
week's survey of artists and drugs in Without Walls. Today (9.00 C4) we move
on to the 1960s and such characters as Ken Kesey, Timothy Leary and JG
Ballard. 40 Minutes finds nine young men from north-east England packed into
a Benidorm flat intended for four. 'Loud, aggressive, abusive, they drink
too much and leer at the topless girls', we are told. 'It looks like an orgy
of loutish behaviour but, for them, the excesses are an escape from the
drabness of life in everyday Britain'. Surprising really that they are not
all mass murderers given the unique horror of the drabness (9.50 BBC2).

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FAMOUS for Fifteen Minutes, that began on Radio 4 on Thursday, is typical of
Radio 4, where folk of transient fame are constantly held up for us to
wonder at. The point in this series is that the fame has worn out. Mark
Lester, the first exhibit, was the universally-loved Oliver in the film of
Oliver] in 1968, when he was eight. In an interview with Jenni Mills, he
told how he went on in films for ten years more, until the offers ended. He
spent his unexpected money, he says 'irrationally', has since done various
jobs, is now a trainee osteopath. Next week Jenni Mills talks to Diana
Gould, a PE teacher who once flummoxed Mrs Thatcher on a TV programme.
It is like clearing the wardrobe of old coats you thought so smart before
they wore out. And there are other coats on other hangers. On Sunday we had
Jack's Last Tape, an autobiographical tape made casually in his last days by
Jack Trevor Story, the successful hack writer - nothing much that he had not
told us already, it just had that Story label in it. In Thursday's Radio
Lives there was the player Jimmy Clitheroe whose 15 minutes are over. Radio
2's Star Quality coat on Tuesday, formerly worn by Evelyn Laye, was kept
happily wearable by the electronic mothballs that preserved its charm as
new.
Soundtrack (Radio 4, Thursday) dealt with fine people who will never make
any 15 minutes. The Bill for Service dealt quietly with the effect on the
police of the stressful events they meet on duty - a prisoner hanged in his
cell, the Lockerbie disaster, the Clapham rail crash and so on. There was a
plea for some kind of psychiatric debriefing. I thought the arguments
important and the police reactions admirable.
Not all drama comes from the BBC. On Sunday, Clyde 2 in Glasgow gave A Case
of Legionary's Disease, by Ewart Hutton, a police tale with a plot as
complex as a tartan. Gordon, a known crook, is given a new identity by the
police, so that he can lead them to the Miami Mafia folk who have Dollars
100,000 for him to launder. They also lend him Morag, a woman police escort.
In a quiet country place, they see a skull, said to be a Roman legionary's,
with a little hole in it and a used pistol round inside. Why was the skull
not smashed when this was fired into it? Because the skull's owner had been
no Roman, a former German, now Scots, explains. He was the pilot of a German
bomber that crashed near-by; he had baled out but been shot. The Miami Mafia
get an occasional look while the skull problem is examined, and then they
are shopped by Morag, by now pretty fond of Gordon. She was nicely played by
Louise Beattie, Gordon by John Bett, and Finlay Welsh directed. Good fun.
LBC's Images for the End of the Century (Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, 10
minutes each), by Damien Chalaud, was different. In a suite of recorded
chat, documentary extracts and archival recordings, it tries to map the 20th
century. But the instant images were not sharp enough; all we had was a
pincushion of events that did not relate to one another.
Curiously, what I have enjoyed most in Radio 3's 20s season is the Hindemith
Composer of the Week. It is not for me to analyse it, but I find much of it
lively and as individual in its way as Mozart - good material for Classic
FM. The Aldous Huxley stories I heard were good magazine stories, no more.
Of course there were good magazines then, where informed stories about the
arts might be expected. On Saturday, Richard Mayne's Dancing on a Tightrope,
an account of Cocteau, spread widely over the 1920s, taking in Stravinsky,
Les Six, Picasso, even Genet. He may have been considered as much a showman
as an artist in his day; but the plays and films remain as much part of our
time as of his.

FT  11 MAY 91 / How To Spend It: An old lady of distinction - Lucia van der
Post celebrates a fashionable lady's 75 years and finds bespoke tailoring
that won't cost men a fortune
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR SUCH a fashionable lady 75 is quite an age to admit to. But yes, it is
true, Vogue really is 75 years old this year. The first British issue was
published during the First World War, on September 15 1916. Most of the
editorial matter was supplied from New York, although there were some sops
to local British interests. It sold for just a shilling. Wartime
restrictions meant that it carried no advertisements.
Times may be hard now in glossy magazine advertising circles but even so the
current issue sells for Pounds 2.50 and there are at least 89 pages of
glossy advertisements keeping apart the 204 pages of editorial. At the
height of the boom times, in October 1988, the fattest issue of all carried
333 pages of advertisement and 170 of editorial. If Conde Nast himself could
have lived to see it]
For a magazine which sells just 172,387 copies it has always had an
influence that goes way beyond size. As Peter York, that subtle interpreter
of current trends and attitudes puts it: 'It's a big little circulation. It
is the biggest, most glamorous, full-tilt, paid for, glossy there is. It has
a huge pass-on readership and is read by far more people than those who pay
for it. It doesn't appeal to a single class more it unites an attitude
group, people who think clothes and fashion are important.'
Vogue was always intended to be a very classy number. Conde Nast, who
founded one of the world's most famous magazine empires, never started a
magazine himself. He bought them all, from Vanity Fair and House and Garden
through to his flagship Vogue. 'Class not mass' was the company motto and
the culture has hardly changed. Circulation was never of prime importance
but Conde Nast is not in the business of running loss-making operations for
the sake of prestige. Daniel Salem, chairman of Conde Nast Publications,
makes it very clear that 'Vogue is the flagship not just in terms of
prestige but also in terms of profit.'
Nobody is talking precise figures because nobody has to. One Vogue strength
is that Conde Nast is answerable to nobody but itself - Si Newhouse, his
brother Donald and other family members own Advance Publications, the parent
company. There are no outside shareholders, nobody whose opinions they are
obliged to listen to. If the Newhouses want to do something, it is done.
According to a recent Time magazine article, the Advance empire is one of
the largest family fortunes in the US, probably worth Dollars 11bn.
Si Newhouse's father was the man who bought the Conde Nast empire back in
1963 after Conde Nast himself had suffered a series of complicated financial
reversals.
Rather like the man who liked the razor and so bought the company, rumour
has it that in 1959 Si Newhouse's wife Mitzi asked him to go out and buy her
Vogue. Some Dollars 5m poorer he came back with Conde Nast.
Vogue has always generated a mythology of its own. To those whose
journalistic lives were spent outside its glossy environs it always seemed
an infinitely frothy place. It always seemed a centre of happenings, of much
weeping as fearsome editors conducted their reigns of terror, of top editors
hired for mouth-watering sums and, above all, as home of the mysterious
breed universally known as Voguettes. These were the numerous junior
assistants or reporters who followed in the wake of their high priestesses,
the section editors. They were rumoured to be paid a pittance but always had
a way of making everybody else's designer clothes look like last year's
rejects.
Georgina Howell, in her book Sultans of Style, describes how she won Vogue's
annual talent contest and was initiated into the Voguette's code. She was
given 'a small red paper-bound book entitled So You Have Joined Conde Nast.
It told her to 'wear a plain dark costume to the office, not to wear
jewellery other than a string of pearls, and to have a hat and gloves for
the journey to and from the office.' It warned her on no account to discuss
her salary. This, remember, was in the early 1960s when Biba, Mary Quant et
al were just about to burst upon the scene.
Her reward for winning the talent contest was to water the plants and take
messages for Peter Coats, the distinguished garden editor. 'Tell Peter,'
commanded the Duchess of Westminster, 'that I must have my feather boa back
by Saturday.'
But even Vogue has to change. Once upon a time, so legend had it, Vogue had
only to decree that it was a beige and cream year and every shop in town did
its windows in beige and cream and lo and behold the people did wear beige
and cream. These days it does not try to dictate. It edits, refines and
presents a variety of the best options. Or, as Daniel Salem would put it,
'it sets a mood.'
It changes, as all things must, to survive. It has always been primarily a
visual magazine but Vogue and Conde Nast have always nurtured and supported
a range of talented people.
Looking back over the years the list of contributors is impressive. It
ranges from famous photographers such as Cecil Beaton, Bailey, and Snowdon,
writers like Gertrude Stein, Aldous Huxley, DH Lawrence and Colette, and
food stars such as Boulestin, Robert Carrier and Elizabeth David.
Designers like Mary Quant, Ossie Clark, Foale and Tuffin, Zandra Rhodes were
all given spreads and exposure. Most of went on to become household names
but they were unknowns when Vogue spotted them.
There have been times, though, when the opposition has given Vogue quite a
run for its money. Queen under Jocelyn Stevens in the 1960s gave it quite a
fright. The Face and Arena gave it pause for thought and it is no accident
that Conde Nast now owns 40 per cent of them. 'Buying into those magazines
magazines gives us a foothold in the future and access to a hothouse of
talent,' says Daniel Salem.
'There is no doubt that times now are tough - I personally have never known
them so bad in 35 years in publishing but we have the resources to see them
out. Sometimes it is much more interesting to improve the bottom-line than
turnover. The key, above all, is to be number one in your field. There can,
after all, be only one bible.' There Vogue seems secure.

GERMANS TO BUY MANSION THAT WAS HUB FOR EXILES FLEEING NAZIS

<P>
A Pacific Palisades mansion that was a gathering place for intellectuals who 
fled Hitler's Germany is being bought by a West German foundation for use as a 
research center for European-American relations and German exile literature. 
</P>
<P>
The decision by USC, which inherited the house in 1987, to sell it for $1.9 
million is a victory for the German foundation and for preservationists who two 
years ago opposed a plan by the university to sell the property and move its 
prized 36,000-volume library to the university's Exposition Park campus. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans -- with the support of West German President Richard von 
Weizsaecker and former Chancellor Willy Brandt -- wanted to keep the house and 
library intact as a monument to German writers and artists who fled Nazi 
persecution and settled in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed in December, USC will allow approximately 22,000 
volumes to be kept at the mansion on a long-term loan. The remaining books -- 
all rare first editions or volumes printed before AD 1500 -- will be kept in a 
temporary storage facility near the campus until they can be moved into a 
permanent wing to be built in Doheny Memorial Library in the next several 
years, said George Abdo, USC executive assistant to the president. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish-style house, featuring a sweeping view of the Pacific from a bluff 
above Sunset Boulevard, was bought by the late German novelist and playwright 
Lion Feuchtwanger in 1943 and served as a hub for the German exile community in 
Los Angeles and other European notables. Among its regular visitors were Thomas 
Mann, Charlie Chaplin, Bertolt Brecht, Aldous Huxley, Arnold Schoenberg and 
Bruno Walter. 
</P>
<P>
"For them, the Villa Aurora was a productive and important meeting place during 
the exile period," said Lothar C. Poll, spokesman for the group that is buying 
the house and publisher of the West Berlin Tagesspiegel, the city's main daily 
newspaper. "It was a kind of 'Weimar on the Pacific.' " 
</P>
<P>
At least twice a year, members of the exile community would gather at the house 
to hear Feuchtwanger read from manuscripts of his latest plays or novels, 
according to USC professor Harold von Hofe, senior fellow of the new research 
center, called the Villa Aurora Institute. After discussions, the group would 
adjourn downstairs for herring salad followed by apple strudel, recalled Hilde 
Waldo, Feuchtwanger's personal secretary. 
</P>
<P>
The house was built in 1927 by the Los Angeles Times as a showcase of the 
latest in home design. 
</P>
<P>
Feuchtwanger's widow, Marta, left the mansion and library to USC upon her death 
in 1987, but her will gave the university the option of selling the house and 
using the proceeds to build a Lion Feuchtwanger Memorial Library on campus. The 
house's library would have been moved to the new library, in that case. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to buying the house, the German foundation, called the Circle of 
Friends and Supporters of the Villa Aurora, has agreed to pay an estimated $2 
million to upgrade the house's interior and shore up its crumbling foundation. 
The group also will be responsible for raising funds to run the Villa Aurora 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
Von Hofe said the West German Bundestag, or lower house of parliament, and the 
West Berlin senate, as well as private donors, contributed funds to the 
preservation effort. 
</P>
<P>
Details of the institute have yet to be worked out, but university officials 
said the main focus will be European-American relations, a topic they say will 
become increasingly critical as political events in Europe continue to unfold. 
</P>
<P>
Among speakers already lined up for institute-sponsored lectures in the summer 
and fall are Brandt and West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper, said Daniel M. Evans, 
attorney for the Friends of Villa Aurora, the California counterpart of the 
German group. The lectures will probably be given at USC or at other facilities 
that can hold large audiences, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
The house will also serve as a center for research into German exile 
literature, including studies of works by Feuchtwanger, Mann, Alfred Doeblin 
and other German writers who produced many of their best-known works in Los 
Angeles. The exile studies center will be closely tied to the existing 
Feuchtwanger Institute for Exile Studies on the USC campus, said Von Hofe, who 
also heads the campus institute. 
</P>
<P>
Von Hofe said the research center will necessarily operate on a small scale -- 
the house does not comfortably hold more than about 50 people, he said, and 
parking on the narrow and winding road that leads up to it is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, plans for the institute must first be presented to neighbors at a 
public hearing chaired by a city zoning administrator, who will decide whether 
to recommend a conditional use permit for the center, said Claire Rogger, 
deputy to City Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement caps two years of long-distance negotiations between USC and the 
German foundation. USC initially rejected the Germans' preservation proposal, 
but several weeks later said it would reconsider it, if the group came up with 
$15 million to pay for the new Feuchtwanger library on campus, repair the house 
and establish an endowment to run a research center at the mansion, which the 
university would continue to own. 
</P>
<P>
The Germans said they would agree to such a plan only if half the money could 
be raised from American donors, a proposal that ultimately fell through because 
the U.S. fund-raising effort failed, Von Hofe said. However, the Germans' 
fund-raising campaign was more successful, and USC changed its position and 
agreed to sell the house. 
</P>
<P>
Final terms of the agreement were worked out last fall, Von Hofe said, and a 
board of trustees of the Villa Aurora Institute will be chosen soon after 
escrow closes in the next few months.

<TEXT>
IT IS A few years since one of the 96 chambers at the Albany in London came
on to the open market. In offering the 'freehold' on one seven-room
apartment in the buildings, Richard Crosthwaite of the Mayfair office of
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171) explains that it is an executors' sale.
Otherwise, outsiders would be unlikely to hear of it.
'There is a strong tradition of owners making private arrangements,
assigning leases, renting apartments; keeping it in the family wherever
possible,' says Crosthwaite.
Albany, lying behind private courtyards off Piccadilly and Savile Row, has
strong claim to be the most exclusive of London's apartment blocks.
Historically, the main house on Piccadilly dates from 1774 when it was
completed, to Sir William Chambers' designs, for the first Viscount
Melbourne. It was not until 1802 that the building was converted into
bachelor apartments, and substantially extended at the back on each side of
the garden.
Two centuries on, and the Albany's residents' lists groan with the weight of
the Great and the Good, ranging wide across the talents. Gladstone and
Graham Green, Dame Edith Evans and Aldous Huxley, Sir Thomas Beecham and JB
Priestley have, at various times, enjoyed the quiet of what Crosthwaite
describes as 'a very club-like atmosphere.'
A freehold asking price of Pounds 475,000 for 'Set E5', on the second and
third floors of one of the rear garden buildings, does not look too
demanding given the rarity of the sale. Servants' and storage space on floor
three have been converted into a dining room and kitchen, leaving a drawing
room, master bedroom and bathroom plus a potential second bedroom or
dressing room on the lower floor.
It may take more than money to buy at Albany. As in a New York condominium,
residents' trustees have to vet and approve the purchaser. Even then they
have to accept rules accumulated since the Regency, including no resident
children under 13 and no pets. The current estate charge is Pounds 2,994 a
year.
The freehold rights of individual apartment owners predate Commonhold by two
centuries. The system applied here, of a freehold and a parallel Deed of
Covenant committing purchasers to the usual common costs of a multi-occupied
block, clearly works with occupier-selection of prospective new residents.

FT  01 FEB 92 / Arts: A look at the Pop era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1960s, it seems, are always with us, at once so ambiguous and so
positive, so hopeful and so meretricious, so stylish and so vulgar. How we
believed then, in that false dawn, when we would throw off the shackles of
the stuffy, academic past, reform the art schools and so move forward into
that brave new world.
Up to a point we did, forgetting that it was precisely that old formal
academic grounding, with its emphasis on observation, understanding and
technique, that allowed us the luxury of our precocious posturings. If last
autumn's Pop Art Show at the Royal Academy taught us anything, it was that
the British variety was so much the better made than the American, richer
and more complex in its references and associations, for all the superficial
gloss.
For Ready Steady Go at the Royal Festival Hall (until February 23, then on
an extensive tour well into 1993), the South Bank Centre draws upon the Arts
Council's own collection of work of the 1960s, bought at the time, cheap and
cheerful. The title may naturally evoke the generality of Pop, but it does
so with a gentle, perhaps unconscious irony. What it offers is another look
at those supposed Pop artists in company with those of their contemporaries
similarly engaged with the currency of American art, albeit the nouvelle
vague of hard-edge and post-painterly abstraction.
There on the one hand are Blake, Hockney, Kiff, Hodgkin, Caulfield, on the
other Hoyland, Huxley, Ayres, Riley, Moon, Denny, Irwin and Sedgely; and
somewhere in between come Tilson and Smith. What comes through is a sense of
a well-mannered and thoughtful engagement, responsive to what was going on
in the world but still its own creature, an authentic national school,
distinct in its sensibility from any other, and certainly no worse. As such
it was the staple of our official representation in major shows and
festivals at home and abroad throughout the period.
But it was never the whole story, and the absence here of such artists as
Auerbach, Freud and Kossoff, to say nothing of that far larger group of
older figurative artists centred upon the Academy, the Royal College and the
Slade - Weight, de Grey, Coker, Middleditch, Symons, George, Buhler,
Greenham, Coldstream, Gowing and the rest - is conspicuous. Perhaps other
shows are mooted to put the record straight, but serious questions remain
about the nature of our public patronage, that at every period would seem to
celebrate quite arbitrarily work of a certain kind above all others, a
matter not of merit at all, though that may be high enough, but of pure
luck.
Figurative painters were by no means the only ones to suffer, then or later.
A positive response to American abstract expressionism in the late 1950s was
all very well, but the fashion soon changed. The awkward fact is that some
of our very best painters suffered long neglect in consequence. The Pomeroy
Purdy Gallery (at Jacob Street Film Studios, Mill Street SE1, until February
22) is showing the work of four of them, dating not from the 1960s but from
the years either side of 1980.
Two are in Ready Steady Go, but then John Hoyland had yet to evolve from the
colour-field towards actual expressionism, and Gillian Ayres was to be all
but ignored for the next 15 years. Here her paintings are at their most
mysterious and atmospheric, the surfaces dense and impacted, the colour rich
and deep, the spaces unspecific. They are neither better nor worse than her
more recent work, that is more open, graphic, more particular in its
suggestion of landscape: only different, and very beautiful.
Basil Beattie, who has lately emerged as among our most authoritative
painters, seemed then to be painting the paintings one might almost hope
Hoyland would paint now, for being freer in the gesture, less dry and flat
in the paint itself, and more open in imagery and surface. Here Hoyland's
prints are so much the more confident, integrated and expansive in the
handling.
And there is Brian Fielding, who died in 1987. He showed seldom, and so
slipped through the net, but to his peers and students he was a constant
standard and abiding influence and example. His paintings here are in the
true character of his work, the sensibility at once oriental and occidental,
the surfaces flat yet deep, the statement painterly yet calligraphic. He
held such contradictions in perfect balance, with deceptive ease and true
conviction.

Los Angeles is once again in throes of dubious delight, calling itself 
America's second-most important art center and waiting nervously for somebody 
to laugh. That last happened in the '60s when the town dawned on the world as a 
hot-rod hotbed for flashy contemporary art. By now a lot of folks tend to think 
that time was the genesis if not the exodus of the whole L.A. enchilada. It 
wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
Before there were Bengston Dentos, Bell boxes and elegant Irwin voids there 
were a couple of generations of lonely pioneers crying "Art!" in the 
wilderness. Lest we forget the Laguna Art Museum presents an unexpectedly 
important exhibition called "Turning the Tide: Early Los Angeles Modernists, 
1920-1956." 
</P>
<P>
On view to Sept. 16 and organized by the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, the 
show's catalogue essays raise larger questions about Los Angeles' cultural 
history. Has the town always been a philistine wasteland awash in the fleeting 
values of Hollywood? Is it a place with no sense of time, history or social 
togetherness? If so did that sense of anonymity, immediacy and the ephemeral 
create a climate of creative freedom? Did it make Los Angeles a post-modern 
city decades before the term was invented? That's what essayist Paul Karlstrom 
thinks. He curated the show along with Susan Ehrlich and Barry Heisler. 
</P>
<P>
Some questions are more interesting than answers. 
</P>
<P>
The 80-work exhibition is organized in such fashion as to have an odd, timeless 
quality. You can't tell when pictures were painted by looking at them. Tacked 
down, the dates could unmask them as provincial versions of styles invented 
elsewhere but there's a local-vintage twist to their look that saves them. At 
least some of them. Lacking chronological guidelines there is no way to judge 
except by quality. The work divides into pictures that stand up handsomely and 
those that have turned into quaint period pieces. 
</P>
<P>
But the show does prove there were at least 20 artists who took the avant-garde 
culture seriously when the Red Cars ran, the Richfield Building stood and Aimee 
Semple McPherson exhorted the faithful to pin their offerings to the velvet 
rope on the back of the pew. 
</P>
<P>
That's not very many but -- particularly during World War II -- there were 
high-level writers, musicians and filmmakers around from Thomas Mann and Igor 
Stravinsky to Jean Renoir and Aldous Huxley. Just how much cross-fertilization 
existed between the various arts is a question that's beginning to be answered 
when we learn that the L.A. avant-garde created contact between architect 
Richard Neutra, bookseller Jake Zeitlin, director Joseph von Sternberg, 
photographer Edward Weston and painters such as Lorser Feitelson and Stanton 
Macdonald-Wright, among others. 
</P>
<P>
The archly aristocratic Macdonald-Wright returned to Los Angeles in 1918 after 
inventing Synchronism in Paris and before a conversion to Oriental philosophy 
that would take him repeatedly to Japan. He became a linking figure symbolizing 
local absorption of European formalities and Zen spontaneity that remains 
operative to this day. Paintings on view look, naturally, like color-Cubist 
Chinese landscapes. Where but here could such exotic hybrids grow? 
</P>
<P>
For awhile Macdonald-Wright headed the local division of the WPA where he met 
Lorser Feitelson and Helen Lundeberg, among others. They evolved "Post 
Surrealism," which exorcised Freudian weirdness and eventually involved Knud 
Merrild and Grace Clemens. The show finds the style evolving from Lundeberg's 
"Microcosm and Macrocosm" of 1937 to Feitelson's geometric-abstract "Magical 
Space Forms" of the '50s. For awhile he had a black-and-white PBS art-education 
show where he pushed the product with the fervor of a Madman Muntz car 
salesman. Pop culture meets cultivated culture. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of that and the supposedly nefarious influence of Hollywood, two of 
the most interesting artists on view both painted and made animated films, 
Oskar Fischinger and Jules Engel. Fischinger's painting, like a number of the 
others here, bounces around too much, but his jazzy abstract animated film 
looks great on videotape and has the artistic density we associated with great 
Bauhaus work. Eventually critic Jules Langsner would dub the growing tendency 
to T-square composition as an indigenous style called "Hard Edge Abstraction." 
It's best-known and most subtle practitioner was John McLauglin but the term 
acts as a magnet for artists with purist tendencies from Karl Benjamin and 
Frederick Hammersley to June Wayne and Peter Krasnow. His pastel hues capture 
that L.A. light that gives one the impression that all the buildings have been 
freshly painted while we were out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally there had to be a corrective to all this crisp purism. It came under 
the mantle of various forms of figurative Expressionism practiced by Hans 
Burkhardt, Rico Lebrun, Howard Warshaw and William Brice. His abstract 
landscapes hold up heroically but generally this is the hardest work to link up 
to our ideas about Los Angeles' cool hedonism. Maybe it proves that cities, 
like people, have lurking demons within. 
</P>
<P>
High on the list of Los Angeles' stereotypical quirks is its putative talent 
for fostering all manner of crackpot cults. That seriously suggests a lot of 
lonely people looking for something to believe in. Art itself has often been 
characterized as a kind of surrogate religion and several artists here betray 
specific leanings to mysticism. 
</P>
<P>
Lee Mullican has long been noted for work that links to the metaphysic of 
Southwest American Indian culture. Two others are figures that dwelled in 
obscurity until recently, Henrietta Shore and Agnes Pelton. Both bear generic 
resemblance to Georgia O'Keeffe's more abstract art. In this exhibition Pelton 
looks slightly more interesting in works that combine leanings to decadent 
symbolism with an exquisite execution that prefigures the best of Billy Al 
Bengston. 
</P>
<P>
"Turning the Tide" leaves us with provocative hints suggesting the truth of a 
long-held hunch that the L.A. artistic sensibility has a real, if slippery, 
originality that matches the weird uniqueness of the place itself.

   Today is Wednesday, Jan. 11, the 10 day of 1989. There are 354
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On Jan. 11, 1935, aviator Amelia Earhart began a trip from
Honolulu to Oakland, Calif., that would make her the first woman to
fly solo across the Pacific Ocean.
   On this date:
   In 1757, the first secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton,
was born in the West Indies.
   In 1805, the Michigan Territory was created.
   In 1861, Alabama seceded from the Union.
   In 1913, the first sedan-type automobile, a Hudson, went on
display at the 13th Automobile Show in New York.
   In 1943, the United States and Britain signed treaties
relinquishing extraterritorial rights in China.
   In 1964, Surgeon General Luther Terry issued the first government
report saying smoking may be hazardous to one's health.
   In 1977, France set off an international uproar by releasing Abu
Daoud, a Palestinian suspected of involvement in the massacre of
Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics.
   In 1978, two Soviet cosmonauts aboard the Soyuz 27 capsule linked
up with the Salyut 6 orbiting space station, where the Soyuz 26
capsule was already docked, making it the first time three
spacecraft were brought together in orbit.
   Ten years ago: Billy Carter, brother of President Carter, denied
remarks he had made while touring Georgia with a group of Libyans
were anti-Semitic, and said, ``This trip is not being conducted to
be an embarrassment to my brother.''

THE MODERN BRITISH NOVEL by Malcolm Bradbury Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 20, 512
pages
AS I read this survey of the British novel over the past 100 years, I have a
picture before me from the silent movie screen. Our hero, played by Buster
Keaton, running for all he is worth in the middle of the railroad track, is
in hot pursuit of a moving train; just as he seems to be reaching it, the
train accelerates and pulls away from him. Clamping his hat firmly on his
head, he makes a superhuman effort and struggles on top just before the
train reaches the tunnel. He emerges clinging to the outside of the last
carriage covered in grime and soot.
No ingratitude is intended for a book from which I have benefited
enormously, and that has already acquired an honoured place on my reference
shelves, but there seems something similarly farcical and heroic in
Bradbury's attempt to discuss, or at least mention, every novel of some
significance by a British novelist published since the 1870s. Bradbury has
peppered his pages with an overwhelming plethora of names. At the conclusion
he appends a further List of Major Works from 1876 to the present that, he
says, 'reaches well beyond the authors it has been possible to cover in the
text but, though full, remains personal and selective.'
An idea of the extent of ground covered may be seen from two successive
entries in this list:
'DOYLE, ARTHUR CONAN (1859-1930). A Study in Scarlet (1887), The Sign of
Four (1890), The White Company (1891), The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
(1892), The Memoirs of Sherlock Homes (1894), The Return of Sherlock
Holmes(1905) DOYLE, RODDY (1958- ) The Commitments (1988), The Snapper
(1990), Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha (1993).'
Roddy Doyle is one of six favoured novelists on another list - the short
list of this year's Booker Prize for fiction to be awarded next Tuesday and
Doyle's novel on that list is the last one mentioned above by Bradbury. It
consists of an Irish schoolboy's random thoughts at a time when his parent's
marriage is breaking up. If it wins it will be very good going on Bradbury's
part to have got it in.
After Joyce and Beckett whom he deals with at length, Bradbury is
surprisingly weak on the Irish contribution. It is where the master-word
'British' in his title poses problems. He glances only summarily at major
writers like Brian Moore and William Trevor, and as for more recent ones he
is content with a quick round-up in his final chapter, '1979 to the
Present':
'Ireland (he writes) had of course long been a major centre of important
fiction in the English language, to the point where its tradition now seemed
distinct and independent. Still, a significant part of the best fiction read
in Britain came from there. To the work of well-established notables . . .
were now added the novels of John Banville . . . John McGahern . . . Claire
Boylan . . . Deirdre Madden . . . Neil Jordan . . . Patrick McCabe . . .'
It is not by such scrambles against the time-control that the book must be
judged but by the earlier chapters where the story is told of the novel's
fluctuating fortunes from the days of Hardy, George Moore, Kipling through
the two world wars and the decades that followed. These chapters are
exemplary, models of clarity and compression. Not only does Bradbury deal
with the various clusters of novelists who give a period its distinctive
tone, he sees well beyond them to the historical events, the main influences
from abroad and the critical theory to which they reacted.
Bradbury starts his survey in 1878 because it was around then that the
Modern (in the opposite sense to Victorian) novel began to emerge; it was
then that Henry James, recently settled in London, went to what he thought
was tea with George Eliot whom he revered. No tea was served and as James
was leaving her lover GH Lewes handed him a couple of books. They were the
two volumes of his The Europeans that had been sent on in advance of the
visit.
In that put-down of the emerging Modern by the declining Victorian, Bradbury
finds an emblem of the great fictional take-over. In The Portrait of a Lady
published two years later James canonised his debt to Eliot in the use he
made of the feminine consciousness in his novel. From then on Bradbury's
survey is sign-posted by words like modernism, realism, surrealism,
post-modernism, post-post-modernism, utopianism, and dystopianism (a word
that crops up more and more as the century progresses and describes a novel
like Orwell's 1984). The familiar names - Ford Madox Ford (whose complex
novels are excellently expounded), Forster, Lawrence, Woolf, Dorothy
Richardson, Evelyn Waugh (still underrated, Bradbury thinks), Huxley, Green,
Greene, Isherwood, Koestler, Angus Wilson, Iris Murdoch, Anthony Burgess,
remain in their predictable places in an intricate chronological tapestry.
As an example of the amount of critical punch Bradbury can pack into a
couple of sentences take this comment on the world of Ivy Compton-Burnett:
'The time is that less of late-Victorian life than the late-Victorian novel,
which Compton-Burnett does not reject but subverts, preserving it in an
eternal stasis, for repeated decoding. This is the eternal world of Samuel
Butler's The Way of All Flesh and Edmund Gosse's Father and Son, and
Butler's deep irony and Gosse's sense of patriarchal crisis are both
essential elements of her method.'
An old stager like CP Snow gets his due as a traditional realist and there
are comparisons between him and his 'saga novel' - the Strangers and
Brothers sequence - and others who have written novels on the instalment
plan, Henry Williamson, Anthony Powell, Doris Lessing in her Martha Quest
sequence. In further comments on Lessing Bradbury underlines the importance
of The Golden Notebook.
As the train moves closer to the present we become curious to see who is on
board and who is not. Muriel Spark and Margaret Drabble are both comfortably
esconced in a first-class compartment and so are AS Byatt and Angela Carter,
the latter with an amazing amount of luggage. John Fowles gets in at the
West Country, and we find the two Amises, pere et fils in the restaurant car
with Peter Ackroyd.
The fils whom Bradbury rates as highly as the pere and whose style derived
from Saul Bellow he discusses, is described as 'a pained post-modern
ironist'. Salman Rushdie has a carriage to himself; good to see his work
assessed on its true artistic merits for a change. John Le Carre, JG
Ballard, Ishiguro, Ian McEwan, Julian Barnes, Graham Swift, Iain Banks, are
all aboard, and so are Beryl Bainbridge, Elaine Feinstein, Alice Thomas
Ellis (but not AE Ellis), Penelope Fitzgerald, A L Barker, Bernice Rubens,
Emma Tennant, Rose Tremain . . . but I could go on for ever. The reliable
old locomotive called the novel continues to pull this lot steadily along
and shows no sign even now of running out steam.

FT  20 AUG 94 / Fashion: The body as billboard and palette - Me and My
Wardrobe / Jane Mulvagh meets art consultant Fausto Calderai who dresses to
show clients his discretion and taste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE MULVAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine Art-World Man: surely a dyed-in-the-wool aesthete? Scrutinising a
Donatello bas-relief he is surely a veritable work of art in himself.
Perhaps he wears a three-piece suit in dove-grey, shot with lilac? It is cut
from a vicuna-mink super 120 cloth and its high waist is undoubtedly styled
a little too emphatically. His lavender silk shirt, buttoned in blonde
tortoise shell, is fastened at its promiscuous cuffs by links set with
Mesopotamian curios. His delicate, mauve-gloved fingers probably lean on a
cane carved from a narwhal tusk topped with a hand-painted glass eye.
Dream on] Sadly, the average Art-World Man cuts an unmemorable figure. In
spite of being surrounded by a richness of aesthetic stimuli, he tends to
subscribe to one of two visually bland dress codes: the formulaic
conservatism associated with lawyers and civil servants or the
thigh-slapping 'wit' of bond dealers and TV personalities who guffaw over
loud ties and conversation-piece cufflinks from Tiffany and Cartier.
Fausto Calderai, an art consultant in his late 30s, steers between the two.
His Anglepoise lamp figure is clad in matt wool and reminds me of the
centenary-celebrating images we have recently seen of Aldous Huxley's
beautiful attire. Calderai's sartorial efforts are widely acknowledged -
last year he was selected as one of the 'exhibits' in the self-laudatory
exhibition organised by the Italian fashion body Pitti Immagine, entitled
'One Hundred Years of Italian Male Elegance'.
Calderai's style communicates sobriety but not temperance. His slender,
dry-wool suits are easy on the eye and apparently unremarkable until closer
inspection yields pleasing details. The fine electric-orange thread lighting
up the grey cloth of his suit, like a kinetic flicker dancing across a flat
grisaille, and the shaved tufts protruding from his plain white cotton
shirts, are virtually undetectable as he strides by along Bond Street.
You will not catch him wearing a 'daring' Jeremy Paxman tie, or a 'novelty'
waistcoat. 'They don't work,' he says emphatically. 'They highlight a part
of your body when the whole figure should be a melange which is harmonious
to the eye. And if you're tall (more than 6ft 6in) they look ridiculous.'
His other pet hate is baggy clothes, on men or women.
Calderai runs a Florence-based art consultancy which offers independent
valuations. He advises, rather than trades and enhances his scholarly
reputation by occasionally writing articles and books on furniture made by
architects and artists.
His dress is extremely measured, for he regards it as an eloquent
communicator to his potential clients. He strives to project a balance
between discretion and aesthetics.
'The typical client wants a valuation on house contents which will be split
between the heirs, for in Italy we don't have primogeniture. As most of my
clients are afraid of academics and wary of dealers, they will turn to
consultants.'
Compromise between elegance and practicality is his goal. Passing many hours
in private homes, rather than public places, he must melt into the setting
and take part in their social occasions.
One moment he will be crawling on his hands and knees across a parquet floor
to inspect the underbelly of a table, the next scaling a step ladder to
reach a painting hung high up under the ceiling of a quattrocento palazzo.
Roomy pockets are essential for a lens, a measuring tape and a notebook. Dry
wools from English mills serve him well as they do not look shiny or creased
after a few climbing or crawling sessions, and he prefers their dated mood.
He loathes the faddish taste for cashmere - coats, jerseys, socks - which he
thinks are both impractical and expensive.
He keeps his luggage modest, for 'it would be considered far too vain to
turn up at a house with too many suitcases'.
Unlike British professional clothing, in Italy it is incorrect and
overdressed to wear a dark suit and black shoes in the morning, so Calderai
wears dry brown or grey suits, with a matching, high-buttoned waistcoat and
brown shoes for the day, and the same suit, with a low-cut waistcoat and
black shoes for dinner.
Most of Calderai's suits are made to measure by Di Preta whom he considers
superior to the better-known Italian tailor Caraceni because he prefers his
suits cut relatively close to the body and 'unstructured so they follow you
easily. I don't like very structured suits with big shoulders - like' . . .
sniff, sniff . . . 'those body guards you see in Los Angeles.'
He despises the florid and attention-seeking style of many, typically
Italian, art dealers. 'They look like shop window dummies aping London or
New York gents,' he says. He allows himself two areas of 'fantasy' - coat
linings and cufflinks.
Calderai's cufflinks are by and large costume jewellery rather than family
heirlooms: characters from Disney, lewd parts of the anatomy by Vivienne
Westwood, kitsch from the 1950s. Pride of place goes to a series of silicon
cufflinks made by the Spanish artist Joaquin Blanco in the shape of insects.
The delicate turn of his ankle is caressed by knee-high socks so fine that
you can almost count the freckles up his instep.
Calderai is also opinionated about women's wear. Emphatically out is the
modern taste for all-black: 'It can't be beautiful if 99 per cent of women
look the same. It's a kind of security and they all end up looking like shop
assistants which is rather sad.'
Other hates are big furs, though he is not an animal rights supporter, flat
shoes - 'so sad and unfeminine, don't you think?' - and the fad for going
about stocking-less in the city because 'I just think that a woman without
stockings doesn't care and looks dirty'.
His biggest criticism of Italian women is their taste for too much gold
jewellery during the day and 'those awful tailored gilt earrings favoured by
so-called smart Americans'. He loves feathers - 'a woman in feathers, wow]'
His advice for a young professional man starting out with a limited budget
is to seek good quality second-hand clothes and to have one or two well-made
classic suits.
'Have very few things. The most difficult lesson when you're young is to
stop buying bits and pieces - you need very few things. Only buy what you
really love and wear it all the time. I still wear the two suits I had made
when I started out - one of them is my favourite.'
There they hang, 18 years later, alongside a dozen others in his dressing
room which is styled like a faux-Regency shrine to external sensibilities.

<TEXT>     His words, almost maddeningly elliptical, seemed always to be answering
some question that had not been asked. Yet perhaps all were clues to the one
big question: "What is Art?";    "Creating a garden must be a work of art,"
said Burle Marx, who in his 81 years has created nearly 3,000 gardens, from
the Spartan city rooftops of Brasilia to the sprawling old coffee plantations
of the rich.;    "The medium is different . . . but if you cannot think in
such terms, of Shakespeare, of Debussy, of the more important moments in life
. . .";    He stopped, as if the listener had already completed this epic
thought, and then flowed seamlessly on to another: "A plant is an actor in the
garden, but you have many plants acting together . . . as in a painting with a
big surface, but also like a sculpture seen from different sides. In a garden,
you have to have volume. You need to work with time and space.";    Roberto
Burle Marx, who was trained as a painter, has been called the greatest
landscape designer of the 20th century. Ten of his most significant works,
illustrated by plans, models, photographs and a video, are on view through
August at the museum.;    "It's put together with cleverness and abundance of
heart," said Burle Marx, gazing about the room, his shock of wavy white hair
as invincible as the bromeliads.;    "Roberto Burle Marx: The Unnatural Art of
the Garden" was assembled by a guest curator, William Howard Adams. A garden
historian and Jeffersonian scholar, Adams left his own Virginia farm for a
month last year to immerse himself in the artist's work, in Rio's mountains
and clouds, in the exuberant life of the Brazilians.;    "Roberto just takes
you into his life," Adams said. "And his energy . . . he could kill anybody.";
   Burle Marx is the first landscape gardener -- and that is the term he uses
more than "architect" -- whose work has been exhibited at the Museum of Modern
Art.;    An odd situation, if one thinks of the ancient gardens of Persia and
China, of Versailles in the 17th century, of England in the 18th, when
Capability Brown "improved" on everything by tearing down walls for lawns.;   
Growing a whole world;    These were artists who used water like music and
placed plants with stone and earth and buildings to form one complete whole.
The minds who made them were trying to understand, and embody, the world in
its entirety. And all were controlling Nature. By definition, there is no such
thing as a natural garden.;    "People ask me influences," said Burle Marx,
who grew up in Rio de Janeiro when its coastline was still more a wild sweep
of mountain and sea than high-rise city. Such shapes get into the bones.;   
"I have influences of what I saw during my whole life," he said. "The
influence of man going to the moon, of what Einstein told people, of
Donatello, of Braque, of Piero della Francesca and Picasso.";    He went on.
"Today we are in contact with everything in the world. Yesterday I was in
Brazil. Today I am in New York. Many gardeners don't understand this. They
think it is not necessary to know about music, painting, literature, social
problems.;    "But everything is together: the man walking on the moon, the
war in the Persian Gulf, the disaster in Bangladesh. And certainly, we express
this agony.";    Why, Adams was asked, don't North American landscape
architects speak of artistic agony?;    "I don't know why," said Adams, whose
history of gardens, "Nature Perfected," will be out this fall. "It's
downplayed in this country. If you can draw, you're told to go to architecture
school, because landscape designers are just gardeners. Just sort of
decorators, you know. I could not name a single landscape architect in the
United States who would call this an art form.";    He gestured toward a stand
of tall elegant pines framing the flat wilderness surrounding an estate
outside Sao Paulo. "Imagine planting those trees when they were five feet high
and envisioning them 90 years later, at their maturity," Adams said. "Unlike
any other art form, a garden is designed for the future, and for future
generations. Most of us today want a garden to look good in 10 minutes because
we're going to move next year.";    Burle Marx revolutionized the gardens of
Brazil when his mother was still tending roses and boxwoods in Rio, when the
New World was still imitating the Old.;    In the late 1920s, Brazilians were
pioneers beating back the jungle. They saw their own exuberant plants -- their
rugged palms and bromeliads, their wild orchids and lily pads, their boat-size
philodendron leaves -- as lowly weeds.;    It wasn't until the 19-year-old
Roberto Burle Marx stood in the Dahlem Botanical Garden in Berlin that he
realized the weeds were treasures.;    Gardens fit for city sizzle;    He
returned to Rio to study painting, architecture and landscape design at the
Escola Nacional de Belas Artes. He rubbed shoulders with Lucio Costa, Oscar
Niemeyer and Le Corbusier, and soon he was designing gardens to complement
their bold lines and forms, and the electric quality of city life.;    Yet his
designs also spoke of sky and mountain and sea. And unlike most landscape
architects, he was a botanist. He apprenticed himself to the botanist Henrique
Lahmeyer de Mello Barreto, head of Rio's zoological garden. He knew plants
intimately: what survived in a dry wind, what needed the shade of the jungle.;
   The two forayed into the Amazonian rain forest, finding plants no one had
yet discovered. Burle Marx became one of its most outspoken defenders. And his
tropical collection at his home south of Rio is one of the largest in the
world.;    So when Roberto Burle Marx put a plant on the hot windy roof of the
Safra Bank in Sao Paulo, it lived.;    "You know you're in a tough urban
setting," said Adams, staring at a picture of the garden's curving patterns of
artificial stone. "You feel it in the material, in the plants: big ferocious
things that look like they could take down the satellite antennae next door."  </TEXT>
