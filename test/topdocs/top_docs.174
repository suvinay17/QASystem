<TEXT>
   The executive producer of ABC's ``20-20''
acknowledged Saturday that the television show was duped by an
impostor claiming to be Buckwheat from the classic ``Our Gang''
comedies.
   William ``Billy'' Thomas, the actor who played Buckwheat, died
nearly a decade ago.
   On ``20-20'' Friday night, Hugh Downs narrated a segment in
which the series claimed to have found Buckwheat working as a
grocery bagger in Tempe, Ariz. The impostor, Bill English, said he
had changed his last name from Thomas and refused to sign
autographs because it would interfere with his work.
   ``20-20'' spokeswoman Maurie Perl said Saturday that Thomas'
obituaries proved English was a fake and the show would apologize
during its next broadcast Friday.
   ``(Executive producer Victor Neufeld) feels indeed there was a
lapse in the research done by the production team and we may very
well have made a mistake,'' Ms. Perl said. ``Obviously we are upset
and dismayed with the mistake.''
   Thomas' friends and family said they were angry the impostor
received a national television audience.
   Thomas died Oct. 10, 1980, of a heart attack at age 49, said his
son, William Thomas Jr. of Covina, Calif.
   The elder Thomas appeared in 89 ``Our Gang'' films, starting in
1934 - when he was 3 years old - until the series ended in 1944.
   ``I just can't believe `20-20' didn't investigate this better.
I'm somewhat dumbfounded by the whole thing,'' Bill Thomas said
Saturday.
   ``We did not mean to cause any pain or unpleasantness for any of
Buckwheat's family or friends,'' Ms. Perl said. ``With regard to
the production team, obviously they will be reprimanded and that
will be handled internally.'' Thomas, who runs Buckwheat
Enterprises and makes a living licensing the character, said
impostors threaten his business. He has filed several lawsuits to
protect the name.
   George McFarland, 62, the child star who played Buckwheat's
sidekick Spanky, said he spoke Saturday with Neufeld and the
producer ``was terribly concerned about what had happened.''
McFarland, who lives in Fort Worth, said he too has been dogged by
impostors.
   Richard W. Bann, who co-wrote the 1976 book ``Our Gang, the Life
and Times of the Little Rascals,'' with Leonard Maltin, said the
error hurt the ABC news magazine show's credibility.
   ``What kind of research is this? You would think that at this
level of investigative reporting, you would catch something like
this,'' he said from his Los Angeles home. ``It sort of undermines
anything you'll ever see on that show again. And next week, they'll
find Elvis.''
   A Tempe viewer suggested the profile, said Ms. Perl.
   ``I don't believe in the 12 years of the broadcast we have ever
had such a problem and we will without question tighten all
research and review processes,'' she said.
   The ``Our Gang'' series, which included 221 short films and one
of feature length, began in 1922 with the dual billing: ``Hal Roach
presents his Rascals in their latest Our Gang comedy titled ...''
   The term ``Little'' was added to ``Rascals'' when the films were
broadcast on television beginning in 1955.
   The series starred several child actors, including Robert Blake
and Jackie Cooper. The kids had a pit bull named ``Pete the Pup''
with a circle painted around one eye.
   A year to the day after Thomas died, Eddie Murphy began his
parody of an adult Buckwheat on NBC's ``Saturday Night.''

   A man who appeared on ABC's ``20-20'' claiming he
played Buckwheat in the classic ``Our Gang'' comedies was an
impostor, the actor who played Spanky said.
   The child actor who portrayed Buckwheat died nearly a decade ago
at age 49, George ``Spanky'' McFarland said.
   A ``20-20'' news magazine segment narrarated by Hugh Downs
reported Friday that an elderly man who portrayed Buckwheat in the
Hal Roach film comedies was found working as a grocery bagger in
Tempe, Ariz.
   The man, who identified himself as Bill English, said he had
changed his name from Bill Thomas.
   The real Buckwheat, whose name was William ``Billy'' Thomas,
died nearly 10 years ago, McFarland said.
   ``I don't have the slightest idea who he was, but he wasn't
Buckwheat,'' said McFarland, 62, who watched the ``20-20'' program.
   McFarland said from his Fort Worth home that he last saw the
real Buckwheat at an ``Our Gang'' reunion in Los Angeles in 1980,
shortly before Thomas died of a heart attack.
   Richard W. Bann, who co-wrote a 1976 book on the ``Our Gang''
stars, also said the real Buckwheat is dead.
   ``Buckwheat ain't giving no more interviews,'' said Bann, who
watched the show in Los Angeles.
   ``20-20'' spokeswoman Maurie Perl said the show thought it had
the right Buckwheat. ``We did our research, and to the best of our
knowledge, we're not aware that he passed away,'' she said.
   The man claiming to be Buckwheat could not immediately be
reached for comment. There was only one William English listed in
the Tempe-area phone directories, and a person who answered that
number said it wasn't the same one.
   According to the book ``Our Gang, the Life and Times of the
Little Rascals,'' by Bann and film critic Leonard Maltin, William
``Billy'' Thomas appeared in 89 ``Our Gang'' films from 1934 until
the series ended in 1944.
   The ``Our Gang'' series, which included 221 short films and one
of feature length, began in 1922 with the billing: ``Hal Roach
presents his Rascals in their latest Our Gang comedy titled ...''
   The term ``Little'' was added to ``Rascals'' when the films were
broadcast on television beginning in 1955.
   A number of well-known actors starred in the shows over the
years, including Robert Blake and Jackie Cooper.

Lynn Murray, the producer responsible for an interview with what has proven to 
be a bogus Buckwheat on last Friday's installment of "20/20," resigned in a 
"mutual decision" with the network, an ABC News spokeswoman confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Victor Neufeld, the program's executive producer, decided that Murray did not 
properly handle the research of a segment entitled "Whatever Happened to 'Our 
Gang'? " and that it would be best if she resigned, said Maurie Perl, the 
show's spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Murray had worked on the program in a variety of jobs for the past 10 years, 
Perl said. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, "20/20" claimed to have found the actor who played Buckwheat in 
the "Our Gang" comedies of the 1930s and '40s working as a grocery bagger in 
Tempe, Ariz. He was interviewed on the air. 
</P>
<P>
William Thomas, the man who actually portrayed Buckwheat, died in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Downs will apologize on the air in tonight's broadcast of the 12-year-old 
news magazine "for any pain and discomfort" the mistake might have caused 
Thomas' family, Perl said. 
</P>
<P>
After last week's show, Thomas' son, Bill Thomas Jr., and George McFarland, who 
played Spanky in the "Our Gang" comedies (later retitled "The Little Rascals" 
for television), criticized the "20/20" report, and ABC subsequently 
acknowledged having been duped. 
</P>
<P>
The imposter, Bill English, told ABC that he changed his last name and refused 
to sign autographs because it would interfere with his work at the supermarket. 
Perl said that the idea to interview English came in a letter from a viewer, 
not from English himself. English apparently has been telling people he is 
Buckwheat for the past 30 years, Perl said. 
</P>
<P>
Several observers, including Richard W. Bann, who with Leonard Maltin wrote the 
1976 book, "Our Gang: The Life and Times of the Little Rascals," maintained 
that the mistake undermines "20/20's" credibility. "Next week, they'll find 
Elvis," Bann quipped to the Associated Press.

a Buckwheat impostor on ABC's ``20-20'' has resigned, the network
says.
   Lynn Murray resigned in a ``mutual decision'' with ABC after

   Thomas' son, William Thomas Jr., and George McFarland, who

broadcast. ABC later acknowledged the bogus Buckwheat, Bill
English, had pulled a hoax.
   English had told ``20-20'' during the interview that he had
changed his name so he could work at the supermarket without being
recognized.
   Perl said the interview was suggested by a viewer and that
English apparently has told people for the past 30 years that he
played Buckwheat.
   The ``Our Gang'' episodes were renamed ``The Little Rascals''
for television.

inside the man has managed to get out in recent years and re-establish
himself.;    "I started to bring Spanky back about six years ago," said George
McFarland, 62, who was in Memphis for the North American Film Festival.;   
"Spanky had never really been away," said McFarland, who is still short and
stocky and resembles the character he played 50 years ago. "But it was only
recently that I started actively making money on the name.";    For years,
McFarland had allowed Spanky to fade into obscurity while he tried to
establish himself as a breadwinner by working at various nondescript jobs,
including laborer, chauffeur and hamburger cook.;    Twice, after his
childhood acting career had ended, McFarland tried to find work in Hollywood.
"I didn't want to be a star or even have supporting parts," he said, "I wanted
to work as an extra. I was tired of pumping gas, frying hamburgers and trying
to sell insurance. I really didn't know how to do anything but act. But I
couldn't get myself re-established and so I finally told 'em to stick it -- I

he's retired now -- he was never quite able to put Spanky behind him.;    "I
make personal appearances in video stores and sign autographs and talk about
the 'Our Gang' comedies," he said. "And occasionally I come to one of these
film festivals, where fans are interested in movies that were made in the '30s
and '40s.";    McFarland, a grandfather, has no regrets.;    "I had a good
life. I wouldn't take a nickel for the experience of being Spanky, and I
wouldn't give you a nickel to do it again. I made 95 of those short films. I
started at $50 a week and when it was over 13 years later, I was making $1,350
a week. Within a year, I was broke. But it turned out all right, and I'm happy
about it." (box)  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   George McFarland, the chubby child star
Spanky of ``Our Gang'' and ``Little Rascals,'' wants about $100,000
from a saloon that he says used his name and face for 13 years
without permission.
   Federal Judge James Rosenbaum on Thursday ordered the saloon not
to use the ``visage or name'' of Spanky. It's not enough for
McFarland.
   In March, seven months after McFarland filed a lawsuit, the
owner of the bar changed its name from Spanky's Saloon to Checker's
Nightclub.
   Drawings of a round-faced kid wearing a beanie came down from
the front of the building and from interior walls. Patrons no
longer could buy jackets, T-shirts and hats imprinted with the
Spanky's Saloon logo.
   Other businesses pay the McFarland, 62, who lives in Fort Worth,
Texas, for the right to use his name and childhood face. McFarland
wants similar retroactive payments from the owner and former
co-owner of the St. Paul bar.
   ``He's after 5 percent of their gross profits for 13 years and
that's an exorbitant amount of money, even if they did something
wrong,'' said Dennis Johnson, a lawyer for the bar's former owner,
Michael Kalis.
   Kalis sold his interest in the bar to his partner, Walter
Engelhardt, in 1982.
   Johnson and Engelhardt, who represented himself in court,
contend that the bar's name had little to do with its business and
that the connection with McFarland was unintentional.
   Marshall Tanick, a Minneapolis attorney representing McFarland,
said they denied his client his legitimate livelihood. He said the
Spanky name and image are McFarland's meal ticket.
   Tanick also accused the bar owners of tarnishing McFarland's
name by associating it with heavy metal bands that perform at the
bar. McFarland was shocked when he discovered his name had been
linked to such bands as ``Raw Meat,'' ``Primal Scream'' and ``Blue
Murder,'' Tanick said in court papers.
   ``Spanky's wholesome appeal, particularly to families and
children, is debased by associating him with these morbid
musicians,'' the lawsuit contended.
   In addition to 13 years of licensing fees and legal costs,
McFarland also wants all the merchandise and bar equipment
featuring the Spanky's logo.
   Rosenbaum urged attorneys to work out an agreement regarding the
merchandise and took McFarland's other claims under advisement.

   Like many other citizens these days, Spuds MacKenzie has grown concerned about pit bulls. 

   Not that the Bud Light "Senior Party Consultant" worries about having his leg chomped off. 
Rather, some people have been making, well, insinuations. 

   They're suggesting that though he may wear tuxedos and appear on talk shows, when you get right down to it, Mr. MacKenzie may actually be a. . . . 


   "Absolutely not! 
Spuds is not a pit bull," says William Stolberg, a spokesman for Anheuser-Busch Cos., which uses the dog to sell beer. 
"Spuds is an original. 
He's an executive." 

   But amid the recent flurry of charges about the dangers of American pit bull terriers, few dogs have avoided suspicion. 
Even famous canines like Nipper, the RCA Victor dog; Petie, of "Little Rascals"; and Buster Brown's dog, Tige, are being scrutinized. 

   Employees and customers have been calling the dogs' masters demanding to know if the celebrity canines are really pit bulls. 
The masters say the suspicions result from erroneous media portrayals. 

   USA Today, for example, editorialized that pit bulls have changed since Nipper's prime (and now deserve names like Killer, Ripper and Chopper). 
A New York Newsday headline read: "Petie the Pit Bull." 

   "The truth of the matter is, Petie is a lovable mutt and not a vicious dog," says a spokesman for King World Productions Inc., syndicator of "Little Rascals," in which Petie began appearing in the '20s. 

   A spokesman for General Electric Co., RCA's parent, says Nipper is a fox terrier, not a pit bull -- though he concedes the dog got its name "from nipping at people's heels." 
Kent C. Robinson, chief executive of Buster Brown Apparel, says, "We're sure a dog as wise and loving as Tige is not a pit bull." 
Besides, Tige was just a cartoon character, never a real dog. 

   As for Spuds, Mr. Stolberg says that if he were a dog and not an executive, he "would prefer to be an English bull terrier (his actual breed) because they are extremely cool and mellow." 
For people worried about Spuds's bloodlines, Anheuser-Busch even sends out a formal statement on the distinction between English bull terriers and pit bulls. (The company strongly denies reports that Mr. MacKenzie is pregnant; as to whether he is actually a she, Mr. Stolberg says only that Spuds "likes to keep his privacy.") 

   While the name-calling may annoy the dogs' masters, others have tried to turn it to their advantage. 
GE's spokesman says he has been contacted by several pit bull owners' groups seeking confirmation that Nipper is a pit bull. 
"They were trying to ride on Nipper's image," he says. 
"We told them they were barking up the wrong tree."

   Roseanne Barr faces a lawsuit that claims she
paid ``thugs'' $50 to beat a celebrity photographer as he took
pictures of her.
   Ralph Dominguez claims in a Superior Court suit filed Monday that
he was photographing the star of the hit TV series ``Roseanne'' in
her car outside the trendy restaurant Spago on July 14 when the
beating took place.
   The suit, which seeks unspecified damages, said several men
approached the car Ms. Barr was in and spoke with her. She allegedly
paid them $50, after which they began to beat the photographer,
according to the suit.
   Ms. Barr, who plays an earthy, sarcastic housewife in
``Roseanne,'' had no comment on the lawsuit, said her publicist Lisa
Kasteler.
   No criminal charges were filed but West Hollywood sheriff's
deputies were investigating.

   The boy with a beanie painted on the wall
outside Spanky's Saloon is ``just some fat-faced kid,'' its owner
says. But George ``Spanky'' McFarland thinks it's him.
   The lawyer for the star of ``Our Gang'' and ``Little Rascals''
movies from 50 years ago sued in U.S. District Court on Thursday,
insisting the boy is McFarland, a 60-year-old businessman in Fort
Worth, Texas.
   The lawsuit accuses bar owner Walter Engelhardt of
misappropriating McFarland's name, identity and likeness without
permission or compensation. McFarland is seeking damages of more
than $50,000 and a court order prohibiting Engelhardt from using
McFarland's name and image.
   McFarland makes personal appearances as the grown-up Spanky.
   Engelhardt said that besides the boy painted outside his rock
music saloon, two other representations of the bar's namesake are
inside: a Spanky on a wooden plaque and a neon light depicting
Spanky with orange hair. All three look different and none
represents Spanky McFarland, he said.
   ``I must have missed the (movie) where he had orange hair,''
Engelhardt said. ``If every kid with a beanie on his head is him,
this country is in trouble. If there were actual pictures of him
here, I could understand, but not when it's just some fat-faced
kid.''

   The Rolling Stones will rehearse on a
110-foot-high stage early next week at John F. Kennedy Stadium,
where they planned a concert before city officials closed the
63-year-old stadium to the public.
   If the rehearsal stage being built is satisfactory, another just
like it will be built in Veterans Stadium, where the tour's opening
concerts will be held next week.
   A stage can't be built inside Veterans Stadium until after the
Philadelphia Eagles play the Pittsburgh Steelers in an NFL
exhibition game Saturday.
   After that stage is completed, the rehearsal set is to be
transported to Toronto, where the Stones have a Sept. 3 concert date.
   Ron Bond, the city's deputy recreation commissioner and manager
of the stadium, said that even though the city decided fire code and
other safety problems prevented a concert attended by 100,000 fans
at JFK Stadium, a rehearsal on the field would be safe.

   A graying and glib Paul McCartney formally
announced an international concert tour that he hopes will attract
both misty-eyed Beatlemaniacs and a new generation of fans.
   ``There was a time when you thought music equals youth. I don't
think that applies anymore,'' said McCartney, 47, joining other
middle-aged rockers on tour this year _ the Who, the Rolling Stones
and former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr.
   Asked on Thursday if he was touring to avoid being ``left out,''
he replied, ``I suppose there's an element of that ... but it's not
my prime reason for going out.''
   Instead, he credited the continual touring of the Grateful Dead
and its leader, Jerry Garcia, with inspiring his first tour since
1976. ``If Jerry can still do it that good, there's hope for us
all,'' McCartney said.
   McCartney also said several nieces and nephews have asked him:
``Please play, because we weren't there the first time around.''
   The tour opens with three shows at the Los Angeles Forum Nov.
27-28-29.

   Charley Pride's golf game may not be as
smooth as his singing, but the veteran country and western star
still is succeeding on and off the course.
   As a co-sponsor of the Sunwest Bank-Charley Pride Senior Tour
Tournament, Pride has helped raise more than $447,000 during the
past three tournaments to help four Albuquerque hospitals.
   Pride, a former baseball player in the Negro American League
before making it big in Nashville, performs annually at a pair of
shows and also plays in the pro-am competition that accompanies the
regular tournament.
   ``I need to play more and get more consistent, but that's what
everybody says, isn't it?'' said Pride, who has a 10 handicap.
   Pride, who describes his age as ``plenty nine,'' has been playing

   Mayor Sonny Bono says he's thinking
of taking his political act on the road - to Washington.
   ``If I made a move, I would decide for the Senate,'' said the
former restaurateur, singer, television star and husband of
Oscar-winning actress Cher.
   ``At this point,'' he said Thursday, ``I have to really question
whether for another four years I want to just continue being mayor
of Palm Springs.''
   Bono said he had talked with Sen. Pete Wilson, ``about going
beyond this point in politics.''
   If Wilson, a Republican, wins his bid for governor, he would be
in a position to choose his own Senate replacement.
   Bono, also a Republican, returned Wednesday from a promotional
trip for his new line of chocolate chip cookies.

   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - George ``Spanky'' McFarland, the former
child star of ``Our Gang'' and ``Little Rascals,'' says he deserves
about $100,000 from a bar that had used a logo depicting a chubby
boy in a beanie.
   Federal Judge James Rosenbaum on Thursday ordered the saloon,
now called Checker's Nightclub and formerly Spanky's Saloon, not to
use the ``visage or name'' of Spanky. It's not enough for
McFarland.
   Drawings of a round-faced kid wearing the beanie came down from
the front of the building and from interior walls. Patrons no
longer can buy jackets, T-shirts and hats imprinted with the
Spanky's Saloon logo.
   Other businesses pay McFarland, 62, who lives in Fort Worth,
Texas, for the right to use his name and childhood face. McFarland
wants similar retroactive payments from the owner and former
co-owner of the St. Paul bar.
   ``He's after 5 percent of their gross profits for 13 years and
that's an exorbitant amount of money, even if they did something
wrong,'' said Dennis Johnson, a lawyer for the bar's former owner,
Michael Kalis.
   Kalis sold his interest in the bar to his partner, Walter
Engelhardt, in 1982.
   Johnson and Engelhardt, who represented himself in court,
contend the bar's name had little to do with its business and that
the connection with McFarland was unintentional.
   ``If every kid with a beanie on his head is him, this country is
in trouble,'' Engelhardt said last year. ``If there were actual
pictures of him here, I could understand, but not when it's just
some fat-faced kid.''
   Rosenbaum urged attorneys to work out an agreement regarding the
merchandise and took McFarland's other claims under advisement.

   SEATTLE (AP) - A leukemia victim whose search for a perfect bone
marrow match inspired 50,000 people to offer theirs was recovering
Friday after leaving the hospital.
   Allison Atlas, 20, was discharged from the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center's bone marrow transplant floor Thursday,
about a month after receiving marrow from her mother.
   She went to an apartment near the center that her family has
rented since they came to the area for her treatment this summer.
   ``She's at day 36 (after the transplant) today and she will not
be going home until she's at day 100'' or so, said the center's
spokeswoman, Susan Edmonds.
   It will be six months to a year before it is known if her immune
system has returned to normal.
   ``The bone marrow graft is well established and functioning
appropriately,'' said Dr. David Peace, one of Miss Atlas'
physicians. ``At this time, there is no evidence of recurrent
disease.''
   The transplant was conducted after her diseased marrow was
destroyed by chemotherapy and radiation. A nationwide search for a
perfectly matched marrow donor brought 50,000 would-be
contributors, but none were suitable for her.
   Miss Atlas, from Bethesda, Md., was a student at New York
University before she became ill.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Singer-songwriter Paul Anka and his wife are
suing their former attorney for allegedly giving bad tax and
financial advice, court documents show.
   The lawsuit filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court alleges
that Albert A. Rettig cost Paul and Anne Anka hundreds of thousands
of dollars in back taxes and fines and ``threatens to cause the
Ankas more than $600,000 in additional damages.''
   Anka's writing and recording career has spanned four decades and
includes hits such as ``Lonely Boy,'' ``Puppy Love,'' ``She's a
Lady,'' and ``My Way,'' made famous by Frank Sinatra.
   Rettig, the Anka attorney and accountant for 30 years, was fired
in June. Rettig's law and accounting associates also are named in
the suit.
   A woman who answered the phone at Rettig's Beverly Hills home
said he was out of the country and could not be reached for
comment.
   The Ankas, residents of Nevada, say that Rettig did not tell
them that they would have to pay income tax if they spend more than
nine months in California.
   In 1988, the California Franchise Tax Board, billed Anne Anka
for $400,000 in state income tax because she had spent more than
nine months in Carmel. Paul Anka is a Canadian citizen.
   The Ankas appealed following Rettig's advice and had to pay an
additional $100,000, the couple claimed in the lawsuit. Court
documents say the Ankas claim Rettig ignored letters from the state
tax board asking that he file the taxes.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Winckler, an entertainment lawyer
whose Hollywood career began as a child actor on the ``Our Gang''
film comedies, has died of stomach cancer, his son said. He was 62.
   Winckler died Dec. 28 at his home in Woodland Hills, the Los
Angeles Daily News reported Thursday.
   Winckler's acting career began at age 9 at Hal Roach Studios,
after Charlie Chaplin's former wife, Mildred, provided him with a
letter of introduction.
   By the late 1930s, he had appeared as the bully in at least
eight Little Rascals features. He also was cast in numerous films,
appearing in ``Boys Town,'' ``Knute Rockne _ All American,'' ``Blue
Montana Skies,'' and ``Stagecoach.''
   Winckler graduated from the Southwestern University School of
Law in 1953, and subsequently represented stars such as George
``Spanky'' McFarland and Billy Barty.
   Recently, Winckler had been representing Adam West, the former
television star of ``Batman,'' in a lawsuit against several
advertising agencies over the alleged imitation of West's Batman in
a television commercial.
   West is seeking $900,000 in damages over a commercial for Zayre
Stores. The case was taken over by other attorneys and will go to
trial Monday, said Winckler's son, Bill Winckler.
   In addition to his son, Winckler is survived by his wife of 27
years, Betty, and daughter Patricia Winckler, all of Woodland Hills.

<HEAD>Scientist Begin Training And Feeding Broad Bay Dolphin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young dolphin that has refused to
leave Broad Bay's chilly waters for six weeks despite two federal
rescue attempts is being trained to survive the winter.
   ``Because he's young, he would normally be in a herd of dolphins
and depend on the experience of older animals for guidance,'' Joseph
R. Geraci, a U.S. Marine Mammal Commission veterinarian, said Sunday.
   ``Without that guidance, his greatest need as I see it is for
social contact. Being in cold water, he also needs a lot of food.''
   Dolphin trainer Richard L. Trout has begun school for the young
animal, nicknamed ``Rascal'' by residents.
   Trout, who has trained the sea mammals for 15 years, raps on the
side of his boat three times to bring Rascal to the surface. When
the dolphin surfaces, Trout tosses him a sea trout or herring.
Rather than gobble the treat, Rascal bounces it on his nose or kicks
it with his tail.
   Trout said that is a natural habit of dolphins who consider dead
fish toys rather than food. He must train Rascal to stop playing
with his food.
   The decision to help Rascal learn to adapt to his new
surroundings ends six weeks of debate over his fate. Residents
became concerned when he stayed in the bay while other dolphins
headed down the Atlantic Coast in the fall.
   Rascal had become a favorite of boaters as he would swim along
side pleasure boats and entertain residents along the shore.
   Federal officials approved two rescue attempts, but both failed.
   Because of the dropping water temperatures _ now in the low 40s _
most of the small fish that dolphins feed on have left the bay, and
Geraci said that Rascal, at about 250 pounds, is lighter than
normally would be expected.
   Federal law prohibits training or feeding of wild dolphins in
open water, but Geraci said Rascal's circumstances made him a
special case.
   ``He's got none of the scars that dolphins get by wrestling and
playing in the herd,'' Geraci said. ``He's in good physical
condition. He's bright-eyed, very alert and responsive.''
   Rascal's apparent health and the fact that the animal has adapted
to cold water in Broad Bay probably means the animal can survive
until warmer weather arrives in six to eight weeks, Geraci said.

   When five people were indicted on charges
of sexually abusing children at a day-care center, the news
reverberated through this town of 5,800, seemingly touching
everyone.
   In the months since the first allegations were made against
Little Rascals' Day Care Center last January, wave after wave of
indictments have been handed up. Court documents listing 202
charges say day-care workers had intercourse in front of children
and performed oral and anal sex with them from September 1988 to
January 1989.
   The initial reports were based on evidence from 21 children who
were allegedly molested, but prosecutors say all of the
approximately 70 children who attended the center are potential
witnesses. The center lost its license in June and was closed.
   Nearly everyone here knows someone who has been indicted or the
family of a child involved in the case.
   ``I've watched some of the parents of victims grow up,'' said
Alton Elmore, owner of Edenton Furniture and a Chowan County
commissioner. ``And I've watched some of them who've been charged
grow up.''
   That sense of community makes it doubly difficult for residents
to deal with the sudden onslaught of news media and curiosity
seekers.
   A clerk at a children's clothing store shied away from
discussing the case with a stranger. ``The manager of the store's
little girl is involved in it, so I don't think I should say
anything,'' she said.
   Other people offered similar responses.
   ``It's just a bad situation. Some are very upset,'' said John
Smith, owner of Edenton Floral Co., a block away from the choppy
waters of the Albemarle Sound.
   But while people are reluctant to talk about the case to
outsiders, they are freer among themselves. Rumors grew so abundant
at one point that District Attorney H.P. Williams issued a
statement warning residents that they could jeopardize the state's
case.
   Townspeople are beginning to tire of the lengthy pre-trial
hearings, sometimes grumbling that Williams has been dragging his
feet since the first hearing April 14, when the first arrest
occurred.
   Williams, up for re-election next November, has sometimes found
himself in an unkind public spotlight and appeared reluctant to
discuss even tangential issues.
   Public outrage and a concern for the children may have prompted
bonds ranging from $375,000 to $1.5 million _ so high that only one
defendant has been released.
   All but one of the defendants is charged with the same four
crimes: engaging in sex with a child under 13, taking indecent
liberties with a minor, crimes against nature, and conspiracy to
commit indecent liberties with a child.
   The fifth, former Little Rascals' employee Shelley Stone, is
charged with all but crimes against nature.
   All five defendants have pleaded innocent.
   Robert Kelly Jr., 41, who operated Little Rascals with his wife,
Elizabeth Kelly, 34, is in jail on $1.5 million bond. He is charged
with 152 counts involving at least 21 boys and girls under age 13.
   Mrs. Kelly is charged with 19 counts involving eight children
and faces a $1 million bond. A friend of the Kellys', Willard Scott
Privott, 40, has been charged with 13 counts involving six
children, plus kidnapping and terrorizing one girl. He is being
held on $1 million bond.
   Kathryn Dawn Wilson, 23, another employee, is charged with 19
counts involving eight children.
   Ms. Stone, who is accused of nine counts, is the only one of the
five to post bond _ $375,000 in her case. However her lawyer said
he was worried that she might be named in new indictments and
arrested without warning.
   Joe Cheshire, the Raleigh attorney representing Kelly, called it
``an incredible case.'' He contended that much of the children's
testimony would show that nothing wrong had taken place, and would
exonerate his client.
   ``It's very strange to me,'' Cheshire said. ``You have a couple
of kids make some statements and months later you have some more
and now we hear there are some more. I'd just like to find out how
that process happened.''
   But Assistant Attorney General Bill Hart said there is no
mystery about the process.
   ``We have had continuing disclosure just like the defense has
been getting,'' he said. ``Children don't just come running out of
their houses screaming, `I've been molested.'''
   Elmore said each new revelation rocks the community in a way
he's never experienced. ``A lot of good people and the families of
good people have gotten hurt,'' he said.

   A seventh arrest has been made in a sexual
abuse case in which at least 70 children were believed molested by
day-care workers.
   The latest arrest came Tuesday, nearly a year after an
investigation of the Little Rascals Day Care Center began. A sixth
person was arrested Monday.
   Robin Boles Byrum, 19, of Edenton, was jailed on $500,000 bail
on charges including taking indecent liberties with a minor and
conspiracy.
   In the months since the first allegations were made, wave after
wave of indictments have been handed up. Court documents say
day-care workers in 1988 and 1989 had sex in front of children and
had sex with youngsters.
   The initial reports were based on evidence from 21 children who
were allegedly molested, but prosecutors said in court papers filed
in November that more than 70 children, ages 2 through 7, were
abused in some way.
   The day-care center in this town of 5,800 on the Albemarle Sound
lost its license in June and was closed. The first arrest was in
April.
   On Monday, Darlene Harris, 25, was jailed on $75,000 bail on
charges including conspiracy and taking indecent liberties with a
minor. District Attorney H.P. Williams said she had taken
photographs of adults participating in sexual acts with children at
the center.
   Robert F. Kelly Jr., 41, who owned the center with his wife,
Elizabeth T. Kelly, is jailed on $1.5 million bail, his wife on $1
million.
   The investigation was triggered by a complaint to social
services authorities department by an person not identified by
investigators.
   Little Rascals had been considered one of the best day-care
centers in the area. Its enrollment changed daily, with 25 to 40
children cared for each day.

   Rascal, a dolphin rescued from a cold
Virginia bay after failing to migrate to warmer waters, is going
home after five weeks of Southern hospitality.
   The dolphin gained 30 pounds on a diet of smelt and herring and
is healthy enough to be returned to the Atlantic Ocean on Thursday,
Becca Moore, a spokeswoman for Sea World in Orlando, Fla., said
Tuesday.
   Rascal also was treated for parasites during his stay, she said.
   The 2- to 3-year-old mammal, which is 7{ feet long and weighs 356
pounds, will be taken by van to Cape Canaveral and then carried by
boat 20 miles offshore for release, Ms. Moore said.
   ``The area is known to be inhabited by populations of coastal
dolphins,'' she said. ``We're hoping to find a nice group of
dolphins to release him in.''
   The National Marine Fisheries Service appproved the release. The
federal agency also authorized Rascal's rescue from Broad Bay at
Virginia Beach last month.
   Bay residents had noticed the animal refused to migrate south
with other dolphins last fall. The dolphin eluded rescuers in
December, but Sea World officials called in in February quickly
netted Rascal and flew him to Florida.
   Ms. Moore said the dolphin's fin will be marked with two parallel
lines applied painlessly with an extremely cold instrument.
   ``We will not officially be tracking him, but it is a marking
that we wanted to include in case people are spotting him,'' she
said.

developing efforts to observe comets and meteors.
   Her special interest was celestial navigation, the guiding of
ships by the stars. Among her students were Army engineers and Navy

   Frederic Ernest Morrison, who was already an
acting veteran when he joined the original ``Little Rascals''
comedy team nearly 70 years ago, died of cancer last week at age 76.
   Known as ``Sunshine Sammy,'' Morrison appeared regularly on
stage and in films during the '20s, '30s and '40s before leaving
show business to become quality control inspector in the aerospace
industry.
   Rediscovered by ``Little Rascals'' fans nearly 30 years later,
he went on to make guest appearances in the 1970s on such TV shows
as ``The Jeffersons'' and ``Good Times.''
   Morrison broke into acting at age 3 in a series of Baby Marie
Osbourne films. ``The Sunshine Sammy Series,'' which followed,
lasted only one episode, but Hal Roach saw him in it and cast him
as a Little Rascal in 1922.
   Morrison, the oldest of the group, appeared in 28 episodes
before leaving two years later to do vaudeville in New York City.
He returned to Hollywood in the 1940s, appearing regularly in
``Dead End Kids'' and ``East Side Kids'' movies.
   Morrison was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame in

people with open arms. How come?;    Well, as they grow, organizations have a
natural tendency toward conformity. Complexity mounts, and there's a greater
need for stable, predictable structures.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This tendency exists whether we're talking about a growing family or a
growing business. After a while, standard operating procedures kick in.;   
For businesses, that can be deadly. Continuing to do the same things in the
same ways while the world around you is changing can become an express ticket
to bankruptcy court.;    So, successful businesses put mechanisms in place to
shake themselves up, to literally upset themselves, whenever complacency sets
it. Successful businesses see to it that they always have a few rascals on
board. Rascals are employees whose natural tendency and ability is to foster
dissatisfaction, even subversion, when the doldrums set in.;    According to
Lundberg, rascals come in several persuasions. For example, adventurers tend
to work outside established structures -- making their own schedules, finding
their own workplaces, exploring and using technology to find new things to do
and new ways to do them.;    Authenticators are known for the high value they
place on candidness and truth. Unafraid to "tell it like it is," they often
embarrass the company clones around them with their passionate, on-target
observations.;    It is because, not despite, the fact that they are different
that these employees serve as catalysts for change, change that is essential
when stagnation threatens to smother your enterprise.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Child Sex-Abuse Case Drags on in Picturesque Carolina Town</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOBBS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EDENTON, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Colonial-style buildings still line the
business district in this town on Albemarle Sound that once was
North Carolina's colonial capital. The picturesque small town
retains a quaint charm.
   But Edenton also is the site of the state's biggest and most
complicated child-abuse case.
   Prosecutors allege that over the course of a year at the Little
Rascals Day Care Center, 29 children were sexually assaulted by the
owners, employees and a friend of the owner. All seven deny the
charges.
   With more than 400 counts, the case exceeds that of the McMartin
Pre-School trial in California in which the defendants were
acquitted earlier this year. One of those defendants, Raymond
Buckey, was tried a second time, but the prosecution ended with a
deadlocked jury in July and the charges were dropped.
   The McMartin case consumed seven years of court time ad cost
Los Angeles County more than $13.5 million, making it the longest,
most expensive criminal court case in U.S. history.
   Many of Edenton's 5,800 residents are uneasy discussing the case
here. Many have close friends on both sides, and District Attorney
H.P. Williams has asked residents not to spread ``unfounded''
statements about the case.
   ``I'm getting tired of hearing about it,'' said Steve, an
attendant at a service station who wouldn't give his last name. ``I
wish they'd just get going and get it over with. A lot of people
feel that way.''
   The case broke when someone lodged a complaint in January 1989
alleging abuse of children at the center. The state Child Day Care
section in Raleigh revoked the center's license in March 1989 and
one of the center's owners, Bob Kelly, was arrested shortly after.
   Prosecutors allege that children between the ages of 2 and 7
were raped, sodomized and assaulted. The indictments allege that
most of the assaults occurred between September 1988 and January
1989.
   The defendants are Little Rascals co-owners Kelly, 41, and his
wife, Elizabeth Twiddy Kelly, 34; Willard Scott Privott, 40;
Darlene McDonald Harris, 25; and three former employees of the
center - Shelley Alyce Stone, 34; Kathryn Dawn Wilson, 24; and
Robin Boles Byrum, 19. All but two remain in jail in lieu of bond.
   All seven could face multiple life sentences if convicted.
   The case hit a snag in October when the judge handling the case
cited its ``complexities'' and withdrew after the state Supreme
Court overturned his ruling that the defendants should be tried
separately.
   A new judge was selected.
   ``I would say we may not be at square one, but we're certainly
at square two,'' said Joe Cheshire, a lawyer representing Mrs.
Kelly, referring to the new judge.
   The new judge is still looking over the case, Cheshire said
Sunday. ``He is reviewing the file and I assume we are waiting for
a court date at which we will discuss where we stand.'' He said no
decision had been made on whether the defendants would stand trial
together or in small groups.
   Bill Hart, a lawyer from the state attorney general's office
assigned to help prosecute the case, said that the earliest it
could go to trial would be January.
   ``We're hoping (the trial) will only take six to eight weeks,''
Hart said. ``Of course, you never can guarantee about the length of
a trial.''
   Cheshire said that in his opinion, a January trial is``highly
unlikely, seeking as how it's almost Thanksgiving.''
   A civil suit filed against Mrs. Kelly provides a glimpse into
what kind of case the prosecution could present.
   ``We anticipate that some of the children will testify, some of
parents will testify and counselors will testify,'' said C. Everett
Thompson II, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs in the negligence
suit. The suit has been put on hold at the request of prosecutors.
   Some of the children are still troubled, Thompson said.
   ``They're going through therapy, they're getting treatment,'' he
said. ``We think it will be a long time before we really know the
extent of the damage and the scarring that occurred to these
children.''

<HEAD>Newsprint Recycling Board Named in Maryland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer appointed a
nine-member board Oct. 10 to oversee Maryland's newspaper recycling
law.
   The law passed this year by the General Assembly requires that
by 1992, 12 percent of newsprint used by Maryland newspapers must
be recycled paper. The quota rises to 40 percent by 1998.
   Fees will be levied against publishers that do not meet the
goals.
   The Newsprint Recycling Board will have authority to waive the
fees for publishers that prove they cannot reach the quota.
   The board is made up of representatives of newspaper publishers,
state agencies, private businesses and environmental groups.

<HEAD>Post, Paper Firm in Venture To Boost Newspaper Recyling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUNDALK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington Post and a Baltimore waste
paper processor are planning a newspaper recycling venture.
   The Post and Canusa Corp. hope to open a paper-bundling plant in
Dundalk that could handle up to 6,000 tons of old newspapers a
month.
   A corporation they formed, Capitol Fiber Inc., has submitted the
proposal to Baltimore County. Under a county law the plant must be
approved by county environmental officials.
   The plant would sort and bundle the papers in 2,000 pound bales,
prior to shipment to recycling plants, said Bruce Fleming,
president of Canusa.
   Capitol Fiber's application says it would initially be getting
about 1,800 tons of old newspapers a month picked up from
Washington sidewalks. The company would charge the city $10 a ton
for the paper.
   Fleming said he hoped to strike similar deals with Baltimore and
Baltimore County for their newspaper, once they implement recycling
plans.

   Newspapers in Louisiana will begin
printing on recycled newsprint by 1992, officials of the Louisiana
Press Association said Oct. 9.
   The voluntary plan calls for recycled paper to account for 10
percent of the state's newsprint consumption in 1992, 20 percent by
1995, 30 percent by 1997 and 40 percent by 2000.
   David Manship, associate publisher of the State Times and
Morning Advocate in Baton Rouge, said the program is similar to one
now in place in New York state.
   He said most major producers should be able to supply newsprint
with recyclable fibers by 1992.

   CBS Earnings Down 30 Percent in Third Quarter
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. reported a 30 percent decline in
earnings in the third quarter, citing higher television
expenditures, partly for news coverage of events in the Middle
East.
   The network said Oct. 10 that its after-tax profit fell to $43.5
million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to earnings of
$61.9 million during the same period in 1989. Revenue rose 12
percent to $662 million from $593 million.
   Laurence A. Tisch, CBS president and chief executive, said
increased programming costs contributed to the weak quarter. He
said the televison network spent more money on new program
development, first-run summer programming and the aquisition of
program rights for sporting events.
   The company said revenue growth increased primarily from
broadcasts of major league baseball games.
   ``CBS's earnings rre likely to continue to decline,'' Tisch
said. ``However, CBS has the cash reserves to steer through an
economic downturn, while sustaining our long-term plan to improve
ratings.''
   For the first nine months of the year, CBS earned $266.8 million
on revenue of $2.34 billion. That compared to a net profit of
$236.8 million on revenue of $2.10 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>`20-20' Producer Resigns Over Bogus Buckwheat Interview</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A producer responsible for an interview with
a ``Buckwheat'' impostor on ABC's ``20-20'' resigned, the network
said.
   Lynn Murray resigned in a ``mutual decision'' with ABC because
of the Oct. 5 segment, ``Whatever Happened to `Our Gang?',''
spokeswoman Maurie Perl said Oct. 11.
   The news magazine aired an interview with a man who claimed he
played Buckwheat in the ``Our Gang'' comedies of the 1930s and '40s
and was now working as a grocery bagger in Tempe, Ariz.
   William Thomas, who actually portrayed Buckwheat, died in 1980.
   Victor Neufeld, the program's executive producer, decided Murray
did not properly handle research for the segment, Perl said. Murray
had worked with ``20-20'' in several capacities for 10 years, Perl
said.

<HEAD>Divers Will Try To Save Dolphin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEAN McNAIR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bottlenose dolphin has become stranded in
the chilly waters off Virginia Beach after failing to migrate south
this fall, and authorities are planning a risky rescue to try to
reunite it with its brethren.
   The dolphin, nicknamed Rascal, was spotted in early October in
Broad Bay, and residents around the bay began requesting that the
government do something to save it.
   On Monday, the National Marine Fisheries Service agreed that the
animal's life was in jeopardy and that an attempt should be made to
save it.
   ``It's only done in extreme circumstances when the welfare of the
animal is believed to be in danger,'' said Bob Stone, special agent
with the service in Newport News.
   Kathy Read, a diving instructor at the bay, said Rascal has
slowed down and become thinner. ``That's probably due to the food
source probably drying up out there,'' she said.
   Divers hope to go into the bay Wednesday, trap the aquatic mammal
and then deliver him for a flight to warmer waters off the Carolinas
or Georgia.
   Earlier this fall, the plight of three whales icebound off Alaska
attracted worldwide attention. One of the whales died, but the other
two made it to open water after a Soviet icebreaker carved a path
for them.
   Rascal's rescue is to be supervised by Robert Schoelkopf,
director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center in Brigantine, N.J.,
because he has captured dolphins before, Stone said.
   The Virginia Institute of Marine Science in Gloucester Point had
opposed an attempt to capture the dolphin, saying it could drown in
the net or take in water and develop pneumonia. Bob Byrne, associate
director for research at the institute, said today that it will work
with Schoelkopf on the rescue effort.
   Schoelkopf agreed that a rescue is risky.
   ``You weigh that against the ultimate fate of the animal if
nothing's done,'' he said. ``That animal would die in the area if we
didn't do anything.''
   The dolphin is the second to become stranded in the bay in three
years. Schoelkopf oversaw that rescue three years ago and helped
save dolphins off the North Carolina coast several years ago. An
attempted rescue of a dolphin in Delaware a few years ago failed
when the animal died of a heart attack, he said.
   Rascal may fare better, he said, because apparently it is young.
   Residents have said the animal may not have joined other dolphins
in migrating south because it was frightened of bridge construction
in a narrow channel that links the bay and open water.

FT  11 SEP 92 / Fat rascals rescue the US dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN tourists worried that their currency will not stretch to three
meals a day in over-priced Britain can rest assured: a thin dollar still
buys a fat rascal.
Hungry Americans can find the cake-cum-scone at Taylors Tea Rooms in York,
where they sell for only Pounds 1.85 each. A mere Pounds 3.20 will buy a
Palace Ploughmans (bread, cheese and salad) at the Crystal Palace pub in
Bath.
With American tourists wincing at British prices, the British Tourist
Authority has come up with some less-than-overwhelming illustrations of how
affordable Britain is.
The culinary bargains cited above appear in a book called Amazing Britain -
How to have an amazingly affordable holiday in Britain this year. The BTA is
handing out 250,000 free copies in the US.
The book sings the praises of Norwich ('An amazing corner of East Anglia'),
Stratford-upon-Avon ('Where the Bard comes amazingly to life') and Glasgow
('An amazingly cultural city').
But it is London which is the main UK attraction.
The BTA says it has carried out a survey of 17 cities which found that
London was only the eleventh most expensive, being cheaper than cities like
Tokyo, Rome, Brussels, Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt. When it came to
shopping, the BTA claimed London was the cheapest of the lot. Mr William
Davis, the BTA chairman, said yesterday that London 'is still one of the
greatest capitals in the world.' But he wrote in the authority's annual
report: 'There is no doubt that people's desire to visit Britain is largely
determined by their image of London, which regretably, has become more than
a little tired, even tarnished.' Amazing Britain invokes DH Lawrence, who
once said: 'The English . . . are the nicest people in the world . . .' but
says this now applies equally to the Scots and Welsh. Amazing.

<F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "Human Rights Infringer's </F>
Ballad on the Respect of Human Life"] 
  [Text] The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam held a so-called 
report meeting on life reforms on 7 January. Talking about life 
reforms, he raved that the spirit of respecting human life 
should be put into practice and that many people must not be 
made lawbreakers because of unrealistic legal systems. The 
rascal raved that the people should actually feel the success of 
life reforms within a year at the most. This is another 
brazen-faced mockery of the people, which can be raved by 
traitor Kim Yong-sam, that is, the political impostor well 
versed in fraud, trickery, cheating, and machination. 
  To renovate the spirit of respect for human life in South 
Korea, the colonial fascist rule should, above all, be put to an 
end. Fascist vicious laws, including the National Security Law, 
which systematically infringes upon the people's freedom and 
rights; and suppressive organizations, such as the police, 
prosecution, and the Agency for National Security Planning 
[NSP], and the Defense Security Command should be abrogated and 
dissolved. Then new laws and organizations centered on the 
people should come into being. Otherwise, the spirit of 
respecting human life cannot be displayed. 
  In fact, even today, that is, the era of respecting human 
life, human dignity, and freedom have been fully trampled 
underfoot in South Korea. It is in South Korea where youths, 
students, and patriotic figures who struggled for independence, 
democracy, and reunification, have been secretly assassinated 
and dumped into rivers and seas. It is also in the rotten South 
Korea where husbands kill wives and vice versa, sons and 
daughters kill parents and secretly bury them, and traffickers 
in human flesh for a little money prevail. The worst human 
right infringement activity has been committed by the Kim 
Yong-sam ring babbling about respecting human rights. 
  Under the pretext of a civilian regime, the Kim Yong-sam 
puppet ring is suppressing the people more mercilessly than at 
the time of the military dictatorial regimes. By mobilizing the 
police, the puppet ring trampled underfoot the workers who 
staged sit-ins calling for the right for subsistence last year. 
It mercilessly suppressed youths, students, and citizens 
calling for revealing the truth behind the Kwangju incident and 
punishing those responsible for the Kwangju incident, by 
mobilizing approximately 100,000 policemen. The number of 
people who were injured by the police is more than three times 
those injured at the time of the Sixth Republic. This shows 
that the Kim Yong-sam puppet ring is mercilessly suppressing the 
people. 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam raved that many fellow countrymen must 
not be made lawbreakers because of an unrealistic legal system. 
This is also a brazen-faced maneuver. Many kinds of vicious 
laws, which can be applicable under any circumstances, exist in 
South Korea. The National Security Law is the most vicious law 
of all laws. 
  It goes without saying that the National Security Law is an 
unrealistic one in view of the background of the enacted law and 
its reactionary characteristics. For this reason, the South 
Korean people have strongly demanded that the National Security 
Law--the vicious fascist law against democracy and 
reunification--be rescinded. 
  However, the Kim Yong-sam ring has aggravated North-South 
relations and arrested and persecuted many people by brandishing 
this law. This nonetheless, he had the face of raving that many 
fellow countrymen must not be made lawbreakers because of an 
unrealistic legal system. How brazen-faced the rascal is! 
  Traitor Kim Yong-sam babbled about the spirit of respecting 
human life from the beginning of the new year. The reason he 
spat out such words is clear. As everyone knows, since traitor 
Kim Yong-sam seized power under the pretext of a civilian-regime 
president, he has babbled about the improvement of human rights 
and the development of democracy. Even though one year has 
passed since he seized power, nothing has changed in South 
Korea. Vicious fascist laws, including the National Security 
Law, which is a legal and systematic device for infringing upon 
human rights, have existed as they are or have been turned for 
the worse. The NSP, the hotbed of human right infringement, has 
remained intact. 
  In addition, the rulers' infringements of human rights are 
more prevalent than those of the time of the Fifth and Sixth 
Republics. Thus, people cannot breathe to their heart's content. 
  The so-called civilian regime's color was clearly brought to 
light. The people, who have been deceived by the rascals' 
ballad of reform, are trying to rise up to struggle against the 
rulers. Taken by surprise, traitor Kim Yong-sam is trying once 
again to deceive the people and maintain power by means of the 
ballad on human rights. It is unreasonable to babble about the 
respect of human life in South Korea--a land barren of democracy 
and a living hell-- where human rights have been fully trampled 
underfoot. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet ring should abrogate and dissolve 
the 
vicious fascist laws, including the National Security Law, and 
the other suppression organizations, including the NSP; should 
stop suppressing the people; and should immediately release all 
patriotic figures who have been illegally arrested.

ISN'T THE REAL WALL ST. INTERESTING ENOUGH?; 
</P>
<P>
RASCAL MONEY BY JOSEPH R. GARBER (CONTEMPORARY BOOKS: $17.95; 401 PP.; 
0-8092-4285-0) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Rothchild, Rothchild is a free-lance writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
You could almost make a case that Wall Street has been ignored in literature. 
"Bonfire of the Vanities" was the first important novel on the subject to be 
published in 50 years. The last one before that was Dos Passos' "The Big Money" 
(1936). These two are the only major works that come to mind. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, there's been only a smattering of minor works that could be called 
literary -- Louis Auchincloss' "The Embezzler," a satirical play called "The 
Henrietta" and a lighthearted poem, "Pan in Wall Street," all written decades 
ago, and all of which could fit into into a single briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
Upton Sinclair, who specialized in capitalism, wrote novels about the meat 
packers and the coal barons but not about the stock market, and few characters 
from fine novels ever have even worked on Wall Street. There's Nick Carraway 
from "The Great Gatsby," a bond trader, and then Tom Wolfe's bond trader -- but 
who else? No writer has done for the stockbroker what Sinclair Lewis did for 
the real-estate agent or Arthur Miller for the traveling salesman, and the last 
interesting bookkeeper to come out of a novel is Uriah Heep. 
</P>
<P>
The scarcity of Wall Street novel is curious, considering that Wall Street is 
the capital of capitalism where fortunes are won and lost every day, where 45 
million of us are directly invested and millions more are indirectly involved. 
Enough nonfiction books on investing are published each year to fill several 
library shelves, and readers have an insatiable appetite for financial stories 
in magazines. Why is it, then, that these money-making dramas are so rarely 
played out in fiction? 
</P>
<P>
One explanation is that financial maneuverings on Wall Street are so 
complicated that to describe them correctly and still hold a reader's interest 
is next to impossible. It's no problem for the how-to writer who knows he has a 
captive audience: People will slog through hundreds of incomprehensible pages 
if they think there's a profit in it. Not so with a novel. By the time you've 
explained how your main character, a futures and options speculator, hedges his 
long position by selling baskets of stocks he doesn't own, you've lost the 
narrative drive and nobody much cares what happens to him. 
</P>
<P>
A second explanation is that the people who write novels have it in their heads 
that Wall Street is very dull. I don't know where this notion got started, but 
it certainly was shared by all the participants in every creative writing class 
I took -- at Yale, even, which is a regular boot camp for Wall Street. Whenever 
we had to describe an interesting subject in 300 words or less, the subject 
always was a hot dog vendor or a lady sleeping on a park bench, and never an 
investment banker, a mergers-and-acquisitions specialist, a securities analyst. 
The professors didn't actually say Wall Street was dull, but the artsy 
viewpoint was that financial types were unromantic and shallow, not to mention 
piggy, and could hardly inspire a mediocre short essay, not to mention a 
350-page opus. 
</P>
<P>
When we went to New York on a creative-writing trip, it was not to visit Wall 
Street at the opening bell but rather the Fulton Fish market at 5 a.m. There 
was something worth being creative about. 
</P>
<P>
I don't know this for a fact, but I wouldn't be surprised if such diverse 
talents as Updike, Hemingway, Salinger and Bellow also believed that Wall 
Street was dull, or else they would have at some point put it in a story. Since 
baseball, fishing, adolescence and being Jewish appealed as subjects to these 
great writers, then Wall Street must have seemed terrifically boring for them 
to have overlooked it. 
</P>
<P>
(I went to school in the late 1960s, when the idea of Wall Street's being dull 
was widely accepted. In the recent college classes, where there's wild 
enthusiasm for the $250,000 starting salaries on Wall Street and 75% of the 
students aspire to careers in mergers and acquisitions, perhaps Wall Street has 
become more popular in the writing seminars). 
</P>
<P>
The truth of the matter is that Wall Streeters do, in fact, try as hard as they 
can to appear to be dull. They accomplish this by all wearing the same tan 
Burberries and dark suits, carrying the same burgundy briefcases, behaving 
predictably at public functions, and saying nothing to reporters that is 
remotely odd or controversial. This helps along the impression that they aren't 
really worth writing about, and may have kept the better novelists off their 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
This brings us to "Rascal Money," a new Wall Street novel that if nothing else 
ought to be praised for simply having been written. On the other hand, the 
author, described in the publicity blurb as a "well-respected business 
analyst," must think that Wall Street is pretty boring himself. I'm presuming 
this because of the considerable effort he makes to jazz up his story with 
silly characters, including a mobster named Guiseppe Verrazano (alias Joey the 
Bridge), a Hopi Indian, a demented computer hacker, two bumbling KGB agents, 
several thugs from the Japanese Order of the Chrysanthemum, an advertising 
executive who batters her husbands and leaves them in traction, and a CEO's 
wife who writes pornographic novels on the side. 
</P>
<P>
The basic plot -- small and unprofitable company run by inept manager attempts 
to acquire large and profitable company run by very capable manager -- is 
exactly the kind of thing we've been reading about in the newspaper, but here 
it's lost in gratuitous nonsense. A big crane falls on corporate headquarters, 
the KGB agents try to assassinate the computer hacker, General MacArthur is 
dragged up from the Inchon Landing, a Hollywood producer attempts to seduce 
adoring starlets at lunch, and there are stories within stories from Icelandic 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
Also, we're introduced briefly to a gay Jesuit prom queen; Daphne X, a black 
woman who's against sexism; Rama Krishna Shapiro, a "saffron-robed wellness 
therapist," and a banker named Nick Lee, whose real name turns out to be 
Nicodemus Leibowitz even though his parents are Anglicans. These are only a few 
of the silly characters -- caricatures mostly -- who detract from the story. 
</P>
<P>
"Rascal Money" could have been a satire, except that half the time it's trying 
to be serious, and by then it's too late. 
</P>
<P>
My purpose is not to criticize this uneven first effort, but simply to point 
out that it's one more example of a novel that isn't really about Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
Come to think of it, with Boesky in jail and Bilzerian convicted, Milken 
indicted, Warner chasing Time, Time chasing Warner, Warner chasing Paramount, 
Kravis suing Kohlberg (or is it the other way around?), Pickens raiding Japan, 
Japan buying the Rockefellers, and Campeau nearly ruined, who needs Wall Street 
fiction, anyway?

<P>
If voters impose Proposition 140's severe term-limits on the California 
Legislature, its members will have themselves to blame. They gerrymandered 
their districts so effectively during the 1980s that they made it extremely 
difficult for voters to displace them. 
</P>
<P>
Term limits are not a good answer to the problem, but voters now seem likely to 
seize on the proposal as their only way of throwing the rascals out. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of across-the-board term limits, the right reform would be to eliminate 
gerrymandering and to create districts in which both parties had a chance to 
win and voters had better opportunities to defeat incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
But repeated efforts to reform the redistricting process failed during the 
1980s. The Democratic legislative leadership -- with the quiet approval of some 
Republican legislators who like the status quo even if it means being the 
long-term minority party -- financed misleading campaigns that distorted the 
redistricting issues and hoodwinked voters into defeating reform initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
In their efforts to defeat Proposition 140, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and 
Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti have hired the same consulting team of 
Michael Berman and Carl D'Agostino, whose campaigns of deceit and distortion 
persuaded voters to turn down redistricting reform measures. It will be much 
harder to obfuscate the issues this time, however: Voters are much more likely 
to grasp the idea behind term limits -- throwing the rascals out, even if it 
has the unfortunate effect of throwing out some decent and useful lawmakers 
along with the rascals.

<TEXT>
   Veterans of successful efforts to limit
the number of years lawmakers stay in office offered advice
Thursday on how to throw the rascals out. Lesson No. 1: Don't call
'em rascals.
   ``Most of them aren't rascals,'' said Colorado state Sen. Terry
Considine, who backed his state's term-limiting law. ``They come to
it (lawmaking) with a good heart.''
   Considine spoke at a daylong conference attended by more than
100 people from at least 20 states who say they are part of a
growing national movement to get rid of the ``career lawmaker.''
   ``People are organizing in all 50 states,'' said Paul Beckner,
executive director of Citizens for Congressional Reform in
Washington, D.C., another conference panelist. ``It's clear we have
a broad-based movement.''
   Considine's panel comprised political activists who led
victorious campaigns to limit the terms and re-election bids of
legislators in California, Colorado and Oklahoma.
   Negative campaigns are tempting but unwise, they said. Recent
history offers the best illustration. Despite widespread anger at
politicians for such blunders as the savings and loan crisis,
voters across the country in 1990 reelected 97 percent of
incumbents running for state and congressional offices.
   Instead, the activists said, campaigns to limit service in the
state houses and Congress should emphasize a return to a citizen
legislature: the people's government intended by the nation's
founders.
   ``What we need is citizen legislators who call it like they see
it then return home to their real jobs,'' sais Considine.
   The movement, if it is one, has a sense of humor. In Oregon the
effort to limit lawmakers' tenure goes by the slogan: Let
Incumbents Mosey Into The Sunset, or LIMITS.
   Ed Crane, president of the Cato Institute in Washington, D.C.,
which does policy analysis, said the public no longer wants career
legislators but people who view service as their civic duty.
   ``What we want are people in a citizen legislature who view
themselves as on a leave of absence from their real jobs,'' Crane
said. ``This movement is an opportunity for Americans to regain
control of their government.''
   Crane warned that the grass roots movement, though widely
supported, could be hurt if politicians support it. That includes
President Bush, who will call for limits on congressional terms
during his State of the Union address next month. That was
disclosed earlier this week by Chief of Staff John Sununu, though
he didn't give specifics.
   ``It would be much better if the movement were citizen-led,'' he
said. ``Bush and (Vice President Dan) Quayle did real damage when
they came to this state to support Proposition 140.''
   Colorado voters this year approved limits of eight years in
office for members of both chambers of their state legislature.
They also approved a limit of 12 years in office for their U.S.
senators and representatives. The first such initiative to deal
with jobs in Congress, conference organizers said.
   The California referendum, which passed in November with 52
percent of the vote, set limits of three two-year terms for
Assembly members and two four-year terms for state senators. The
law also limited state executives, including the governor, to two
four-year terms.
   In Oklahoma this year voters approved a limit of 12 years in
office for their state lawmakers.

  [Text] According to military sources, the South Korean 
puppets conducted provocative gun firing [tobalchogin chongpo 
sagyok haengwirul kamhaeng] on 28 February near the DMZ in the 
frontline in front of us, agitating [chaguk] us. 
  The puppet army's large-caliber artillery group, moved and 
deployed in Yulli-ri and Waechon-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County, 
Kangwon Province, South Korea, showered tens of shells on the 
area near the DMZ that day. The puppet army's armed rascals 
occupied battle positions in Sogong-ri, Paju County, Kyonggi 
Province and Korangpo-ri, Yonchon County and created a stir by 
firing at random as many as some 2,000 shells of large-caliber 
machine guns and automatic rifles, while advancing toward the 
Military Demarcation Line [MDL]. 
  On the same day, the South Korean puppets openly and in 
broad 
daylight moved and deployed some 10 armored cars and many armed 
rascals near the DMZ in the north of Kajon-ri, Inje County, 
Kangwon Province, South Korea. They also mobilized hundreds of 
armed rascals to Chungse-ri, Chorwon-up, Chorwon County, Kangwon 
Province, South Korea, and were immersed in a war frenzy 
[chonjaeng kwanggirul puryossumnida]. 
  Meanwhile, the puppet army's fighter-bombers flew in 
formations in the skies above Changsin-ri and Haesang-ri, Kosong 
County, Kangwon Province, South Korea and were frenzied in 
ground striking aimed at the northern half of the Republic. 
Armed helicopters and transportation helicopters moved out in 
formations in the skies above Yonchon, Paju, and Hwachon and 
were frenzied in ground-attack supporting and air-borne 
operations exercises, flying at low and very low altitudes. 
  This worthless fire game [mumohan pulchangnan sodong] shows 
even more clearly the South Korean puppets' bellicose nature 
[hojongjok chongche].

Many must have envied the Italians last weekend. They could choose among any
number of new parties, usually led by totally new politicians. For the first
time in the history of a democracy, voters could go to the polls without
being tempted from the path of reason by the siren call: 'Throw the rascals
out.' The rascals had already been thrown out by the police and the
judiciary.
But this cheery view was mistaken, as Monday's perceptive fantasy in the
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung indicated. It highlighted the problems faced
by the typical Italian voter: 'Mr Rossi has nothing to complain about. His
wife had come through her operation satisfactorily, the children bring
average reports home, the textile industry in his central Italian small town
is working well. But this election breaks Mr Rossi's head.'
Too much had changed, little was left over from the old system. New symbols,
new words, new faces. So, even by Sunday night, Rossi had not been able to
make up his mind. When he did, it seems he voted for Silvio Berlusconi's
Forza Italia.
The victory of this grouping and what the press call le tre destre italiani
 -the three Italian right wing parties - led to some complex speculation.
Corriere della Sera decided they each had, more or less, 'ancient and
profound roots but together represent a new phenomenon'. This is part of the
truth.
Berlusconi's policies were described by an Italian professor, writing in Le
Monde, as 'all originating in the Thatcherite pharmacopoeia of Anglo-Saxon
neo-conservatism.' That highlights what was truly a new phenomenon in Italy.
A party had not only put forward a political programme but had actually won
the election, too.
According to the professor, Marcello Da Cecco, Berlusconi's borrowed
programme ends in the 'definitive defeat of the trade unions and the
re-distribution of income in favour of the rich'. But Da Cecco did,
accidentally, explain how an Italian party had been able to succeed when
burdened with a political programme, especially such an appalling one. He
noted that it had 'neither been questioned nor discussed' during the
campaign.
By tradition, politics were never discussed on such occasions. Italian
parties had highly political names - Christian Democrats and so on - but no
content. Only slogans. Berlusconi's party seems to be the opposite: it has
policies, and a football supporters' slogan as its name.
But will Forza Italia, in fact, now try to put its published programme into
practice? The contradictions within the ramshackle electoral coalition which
the party leads have been well documented.
If, however, there should be an Italian government with policies that go
beyond paying off appropriate interest groups and being blown half-heartedly
by any wind that seems to prevail, the possibilities are revolutionary. Will
foreign policy no longer consist solely of trying to find out what
Washington thinks it ought to be? Will Italy's Euro-policies cease to be a
poorly constructed replica of France?
Berlusconi has no love for Brussels, though, and we could see one crucial
element of the 'Thatcherite pharmacopoeia' emerge as the new Italian
government pursues a European policy that is nearer to that of Britain.
Perhaps Italy will no longer be a reliable opponent of anything that smacks
of the free market and liberalisation.
Such a change would vindicate fully the complex game played by the British
government which, this week, ensured an increase in the number of votes
needed to block proposals in the EU's council of ministers.
Still, any kind of political activism will worry Rossi and the millions who
voted for Forza Italia. Italy's post-war success, a real economic miracle,
has been founded on the basis of a government which does nothing and creates
obstacles. As an Italian colleague, an expatriate Rossi, told me: 'The
trouble with policies is that they can go wrong.'
He is comforted that Berlusconi was helped to his present eminence by his
contacts with the former socialist leader, Bettino Craxi, now charged with
corruption. And that he was a member of the powerful P2 Masonic lodge which
seems to have lurked behind some unsavoury milestones of contemporary
Italian history.
So, the answer to the above question might still be a reassuring 'niente'.
Perhaps not that much has changed, even though all the papers write of 'the
Italian revolution'. As Niccolo Machiavelli, the greatest political
commentator of them all, noted: 'People are always taken in by appearances
and the outcome of events.'

   Television encountered the off-year elections
Tuesday night like a doctor ordering a full set of tests to take a
patient's temperature.
   ``It was the election of our discontent,'' CBS correspondent
Bruce Morton said in the early going, before the nation's dreaded
anti-incumbency mood stopped short of actually ousting any major
rascals.
   It had fewer commercials.
   And, for the first time, Cable News Network and the Big Three
broadcast networks pooled resources for election night exit polls
and winner projections, in a collaborative effort called Voter
Research and Surveys, or VRS.
   ``There are always problems the first time you do anything,''
said VRS spokeswoman Susan Morrison, adding that there were no big
problems with winner projections or the state exit polls.
   There was a delay in national exit polls, which tended to arrive
all at once, because VRS chief Warren Mitofsky wanted to ensure the
``weighting'' of 9,000 to 10,000 interviews accurately reflected
the national trends.
   ``It worked very well for us,'' said CNN spokeswoman Melinda
McIntire. By 9 p.m. EST, she said, VRS let the cable network
project 38 governor and Senate races. ``It's been extremely helpful
in our analyzing voters in geographic and demographic breakdowns.''
   By midnight, VRS had issued 72 projected winners in senate,
governor and referendum questions, Ms. Morrison said.
   ABC and NBC kept the first two hours of their prime time
entertainment, coverage, dropping in brief spot reports until
hourlong specials at 10 p.m. EST. CBS' coverage went the distance
from 9 p.m. to 11.
   But NBC's one-hour special and CBS' two hours were
``sustaining'' - read ``unsponsored'' - programs which don't count
in the November ratings ``sweeps'' that help local stations set
their advertising rates.
   The overall ratings race is tight this year, and typically low
election night ratings could pull down a network's overall numbers.
Top-rated NBC quickly followed suit after CBS said it would air no
commercials.
   CNN, which has no prime time entertainment programs, began its
coverage at 6 p.m. EST as ``The World Today'' neatly capsulized key
races. By 7 p.m., CNN's main coverage was in full swing.
   ABC and CBS led their nightly news shows with six-minute
election reports; their second story was the assassination of
radical Rabbi Meir Kahane. NBC led its news with nine minutes on
the election before getting to the Kahane story.
   CBS' election night anchor, Dan Rather, spent the night in
shirtsleeves, red tie and burgundy-striped suspenders. He also got
off the best quote, early ``We're going to be all over these races
like paint on a wall.''
   And the graphics!
   ABC and CBS colored their Democrats blue and the GOP red;
contrariwise, NBC made its Democrats red and the Republicans blue.
   ABC's ``The '90 Vote'' computer graphics screens had a
traditional look to them. Candidate pictures, numbers, percentages,
precincts reporting; and the network closed its main coverage with
a roll of the winners.
   NBC's ``Decision '90'' graphics were busy and postmodern: the
candidate pictures, superimposed on a split ppurple grid, beside
human silhouettes extending across a red or blue bar to the numeric
vote percentage.
   Then there were three diagonal red slashes pulsating across the
lower left corner while a narrow blue bar descended down the
screen.
   CNN listed the winners' names in gold, the losers in gray,
declaring projected winners with a chubby little check mark on a
bright red box.
   Unfortunately, CNN's party tags were donkey and elephant logos -
with blue backgrounds and red frames.
   CBS had outstanding line-score graphic rundowns of the winners,
picture, name, state, and a cute little logo of the state syumbol
(Hint: Maine was a lobster, Tennessee a coonskin cap
   CBS graphics outdid all others. Its snazzy, computer-driven,
green relief map of the United States giddily panned and tilted
from state to state at breakneck speed until some high-strung
producer probably told them to cut it out.
   CNN excelled with its team of four regional anchors who kept on
top of various races. In addition, CNN political reporter Brooks
Jackson covered the campaigns finances, coming up with some
surprising insights,
   CNN also gave the last eight minutes of each hour to the verbal
fisticuffs of ``The CNN Capital Gang,'' a four-member hodgepodge of
righty and lefty political pundits Michael Kinsley, Mark Shields,
Pat Buchanan and Robert Novak.
   After eight minutes, even the most casual viewer would want to
review U.S. policy against peacetime use of nuclear weapons.
   Shortly before 9 p.m. EST, the gang cut back to the venerable
CNN anchor Bernard Shaw, who looked bemused to the point of
snakebite. ``Don't you just love them?'' Shaw said without a
question mark in his voice.

The world will probably seem pretty gloomy to the government a fortnight
from now. Pause a moment, while we rub our hands in glee. The big day is
Friday June 10. The Tories expect to wake up on that morning to news of the
loss of their formerly safe seat of Eastleigh to the Liberal Democrats.
Better yet, they may find that their candidate, their sacrificial lamb, has
been beaten into third place behind Labour. The weekend papers will be full
of talk about alternative leaders of the Labour party, perhaps spiced by
musings on the future of the prime minister.
The results of the elections to the European Parliament will follow. We will
see the great match taking shape: a revived opposition vs a flagging
government. It may become harder than ever to believe that the Conservatives
can recover sufficient support to win a fifth general election, even in the
nearly three years still available to them.
Good. They deserve to be thrashed. I say this in the electoral rather than
the Singaporean sense, you understand. Those of us who doubt the efficacy of
corporal punishment should not change our principles, not even in the case
of Mr John Patten, the education secretary. Mr Patten's sense of honour may
be measured by his retailing earlier this week of what he said was said to
him in a private conversation in a railway carriage. So much for the
gentleman who preaches to the nation's children about moral standards. This
is the kind of thing that gives hypocrisy a bad name.
It is not, however, a reason for encouraging the Conservatives to leave
office. If the bad manners of one particular minister were the problem, the
solution would be simple. The case for throwing all the rascals out is more
complicated. To appreciate it, step back a bit. After 1979 the gov-ernment
of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher undid much of the damage wrought by the
Labour administration that preceded it. She vanquished the trade unions,
initiated the rolling pri-vatisation of industry, and taught us that simple
book-keeping is a necessary skill in all walks of life and all institutions.
Her successor has curbed inflation, maintained Britain's position at the
Maastricht negotiations on the European Union, and established rapport with
Dublin on the future of Northern Ire-land. These achievements, among others,
deserve recognition. The balance of advantage, however, has turned.
Today the prime minister is struggling to manage an unruly coalition of what
should be separate parties. The government is unable to do very much, beyond
blather. It promises a green paper on this and lists existing policies in a
white paper on that. Here a charter, there an inquiry, everywhere a working
party. It is a ministry of paper initiatives, a taxpayer-financed agency for
self-advertisement. Civil servants are unwilling to propose very much, and
determined not to write down what they do discuss. The urge to further
radicalism may be genuine, but the performance is disappointing.
If that were all, there would be little cause for complaint. The government
could be said to be in a state of do-nothing equilibrium, a minimalist's
ideal. Sadly, that is not all. 'Do-nothing' is often a harmful choice.
Do-something can be worse. Local government has been hobbled. The behaviour
of parliamentarians has brought political life into disrepute. Ministers
spend too much of their time dishing out money and jobs to favoured
individuals, companies or organisations. Fifteen years of continuous office
has resulted in the creation of a patronage state, as described in a report*
published on Monday by a pair of pressure groups, Charter 88 and Democratic
Audit.
The report suggests that there is now one executive quango for every 10,000
population, and that these bodies are responsible for nearly a third of
public spending. It may be right, if not precisely so. Let us halve the
authors' figures to eliminate any chance of exaggeration. The picture that
remains is startling. Britain is replete with opportunities for patronage,
secretive deal-making and good old fashioned corruption. We do not need a
democratic audit to prove this. Just observe. There stands the health
secretary, arms outstretched, guarding every health service trust from
public scrutiny, arousing suspicion by the zealousness with which she
defends the secrets of these spenders of our money.
The Conservatives have torn the heart out of the unwritten British
constitution. The democratic checks on executive power have been replaced in
the name of customer choice. What the latter phrase often means is
placemen's self-preservation. The irony is that the latest evidence of this
comes in a week when all three national parties have published manifestos
for the elections to the European Parliament. Labour and the Liberal
Democrats balance their views on possible reforms of EU institutions with
programmes for the restoration of civic life in Britain. Both summarise
their proposals for domestic constitutional reform in their Europe
manifestos.
Not the Tories. They will have none of it. They talk as if subsidiarity
stops at Calais. They cannot win elections to town halls, so they emasculate
local authorities. They are rejected by the Scots, but will not look at
Scottish self-government. 'A separate Scotland would be relegated to the
lower divisions of Europe,' says their manifesto.
This refusal to contemplate any improvement in our constitutional
arrangements applies to all areas of public life. They shy away from reform
of the House of Lords, although individual Tory peers are more sensible than
that. Simple improvements to House of Commons procedure make little headway.
Several suggestions of reform of the way bills are prepared have been made;
none accepted. The consequence is that more legislation is made in
amendments than in initial bills.
Conservatives need to think these matters through. They have run the country
as if they were in office forever. They govern by ever-increasing
centripetal force. Finding out what an unscrupulous administration of a
different political colour could do with the powers ministers have
accumulated for themselves would teach them a lesson, at our expense. We
must hope that Labour, which is still an unappetising alternative, makes
itself electable before we have to choose.

   Thanks to Astrid's Law, dogs' tails in
Sweden are safe from cosmetic trimming and barnyard animals are
guaranteed a better life, at least until they get to the
slaughterhouse.
   The law, which took effect July 1, was the result of a campaign
by children's author Astrid Lindgren, creator of Pippi Longstocking
and a host of other characters who have enchanted children in
dozens of countries.
   It was a remarkable achievement, even for a woman who once
helped bring down a government. It reflected the reverence with
which Swedes regard a storyteller who has spellbound three
generations.
   The law was Mrs. Lindgren's birthday present from the
government. When she turned 80 last November, Prime Minister Ingvar
Carlsson visited her Stockholm apartment to tell her the the Animal
Protection Law was being drafted and would be informally but
affectionately called ``Lex Astrid.''
   ``We are going to take much more consideration of the animals'
health and well being,'' he told her.
   Mrs. Lindgren, a farmer's daughter, long had agitated against
cruelty to animals, but the campaign gained momentum last year when
she wrote in an open letter to Carlsson: ``every pig is entitled to
a happy pig life.''
   She complained that calves often were locked in barns and
slaughtered ``without ever seeing a summer pasture.'' She asked
Carlsson ``to make life a little bit easier for many unhappy
animals in our country.''
   The wide-ranging law guarantees cattle the right to graze, and
cows and pigs the right to stalls with straw and bedding. It says
chickens should be freed from their coops within 10 years, and
animals should be protected from undue suffering before slaughter.
   It also outlaws the drugging of horses in racing and riding
competions and says animals may not be beaten repeatedly with a
stick or whip beyond ``a light strike.'' Riding schools and fur
farms must be licensed.
   It made Sweden the second country after Norway to ban the
cropping of dogs' tails for cosmetic reasons.
   It was not the first time Mrs. Lindgren ventured from her
fantasy world to shake up the politicians.
   In 1976 she wrote a satirical fairy tale widely publicized in
the daily press dramatizing her complaint against the system of
taxation that finances the generous social benefits of the Swedish
welfare state.
   Mrs. Lindgren calculated that she paid more than 100 percent in
taxes on her income, because of a quirky combination of local tax,
income tax and social tax for the self-employed.
   Her indignation at having to pay to write profitable books
contributed to a growing fatigue among the voters with the Social
Democratic Party, which had governed Sweden for 44 unbroken years.
   Right-wing opposition parties had decried the tax system as
unfair for years, but Mrs. Lindgren's lament had a far wider impact
in the 1976 election. The Social Democrats were ousted, returning
to power in 1982.
   Mrs. Lindgren has political punch because she is a non-political
national symbol whose books are universally embraced. They are as
much a part of growing up in Sweden as dancing around the maypole
in summer and eating herring at Christmas.
   Many of her 70 books have been translated into 60 languages and
have been the source of 29 films or television series. She has won
35 Swedish or international awards since publishing her first book
in 1944.
   Her stories were often set in rural Sweden, where children
romped through green forests in summer, skated on frozen lakes in
winter and went fishing in the autumn.
   Her most popular character is Pippi Longstocking, a rebellious
girl with red pigtails, a chest full of money and incredible
strength.
   Pippi mocks society's venerated institutions, such as charitable
old ladies, and doesn't go to school. The book was an instant hit
when it was published in 1945.
   Her books betray her early interest in animals: Pippi has a
horse who lives on the veranda and a monkey named Nilsson who
sleeps in the house. Emil, an endearing rascal from another popular
series, also has a horse and a pet pig.
   Mrs. Lindgren recently collaborated on an American production of
a Pippi Longstocking film and is working on a new book.

   The struggle for hearts and minds in the black community,
which ultimately will be more important than the civil-rights
bill Congress is debating, has recently grown a lot more
complicated.
   Growing numbers of blacks are calling for self-help,
independence, progress through education and black
enterprise. In Milwaukee, for example, state legislator Polly
Williams conceived a school voucher program for the poor. Bob
Woodson, who has led an effort to convert public housing to
tenant ownership, this week was awarded a MacArthur
Fellowship, known in some quarters as "the genius grant."
Former EEOC head Clarence Thomas, now a federal judge, and
economists like Thomas Sowell voice similar sentiments.
Shelby Steele, an essayist and teacher, has lately garnered
considerable attention for writting on race and the harm done
by affirmative-action programs.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Meanwhile, grass-roots members of the black community are
showing some impatience with racism as the all-purpose excuse
for misbehavior, and with calls for racial solidarity at all
costs. Most especially, as the trial of Washington Mayor
Marion Barry accumulates evidence of drug use, a recent poll
showed blacks viewing the mayor negatively by a margin of 47%
to 19%.
   On the other side are the militants who are calling,
essentially, for a new black separatism. They include people
like minister Louis Farrakhan, the Rev. Al Sharpton, and
lawyers Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox, who gave us the Tawana
Brawley story. Include in this number, also, those calling
for an Afro-centered school curriculum for black children.
   Both groups pose challenges to traditional civil-rights
groups. Perhaps inevitably, that challenge has led to some
confusion -- the sort that was on display last week at the
NAACP's 81st annual convention, particularly by NAACP head
Benjamin Hooks. Throughout his career, Mr. Hooks has been
nothing if not eloquent about the responsibilities of black
leaders and image-makers. To take just one example, he
recently delivered a scathing denunciation of 2 Live Crew,
excoriating them particularly for trying to "wrap the mantle
of black cultural experience" around their "vicious and
sadistic" works. And in the course of his speech, Mr. Hooks
strongly attacked those who would use racism as an alibi for
the ills of the black community, and called for "a moratorium
on excuses."
   Yet in his fire-and-brimstone speech, Mr. Hooks charged
that black elected officials were being subjected to
victimization and harassment, comparable to the post-Civil
War Reconstruction era. The victimized official he apparently
had in mind was none other than Mayor Barry, whose
prosecution Mr. Hooks presented as a typical instance of
racial harassment, despite evidence that is nothing short of
overwhelming.
   Matters became still more confusing when at the same
convention, Mr. Hooks lashed out at black scholars who have
pointed out the harms that accompany affirmative action.
Referring to the scholars as "some of the biggest liars the
world ever saw," Mr. Hooks told a reporter, "They're just a
new breed of Uncle Toms as far as I'm concerned." Mr. Hooks
said he particularly resented one "lowdown dirty rascal" for
writing "a big story in a white magazine."
   The particular dirty rascal Mr. Hooks seems to have had in
mind was Professor Steele, who recently wrote a piece
published in the New York Times Magazine. In it, Mr. Steele
argued forcefully against racial-entitlement programs. He
noted that racial-preference programs did not teach skills or
educate, but that they did "encourage blacks to exploit their
victimization" while also stigmatizing them with an implied
inferiority.
   Mr. Hooks offers a melange of black attitudes, but it is
not clear for whom he actually speaks. Other influential
blacks were quick to take issue with some of his statements.
Columnist Carl Rowan wrote that Mr. Hooks encouraged
thousands of black youngsters at that convention "to wallow
in the absurd notion" that Mayor Barry was on trial because
of selective prosecution of black leaders. Is this
leadership, Mr. Rowan asked, "Or is it pandering to black
frustrations and hatred that are being fanned by Farrakhan
and those of his mentality?"
   The confusion coming out of the NAACP convention is part
of a larger ferment that signals an important turn in the
road toward black progress, and one that is a lot more
significant than the rhetoric wafted about the halls of
Congress. Over the past generation, blacks in general and the
NAACP in particular have won important and well-deserved
victories. But surely there's room for more players and new
thinking when as earnest a leader as Mr. Hooks finds himself,
in the name of the black community, attacking Professor
Steele and defending Mayor Barry.

<TEXT>     Stop! You're killing me!;    Cassara expects a lot of people to emerge from
the Towne Theatre on Sunday afternoon, holding their aching sides, dabbing at
their watery eyes, silly smiles smeared across their faces, as the San Jose
chapter of the Sons of the Desert co-sponsors a film festival featuring the
comedy duo whose Hollywood heyday ended in the 1940s.;    The festival
includes three of the more than 200 shorts and feature films Stan Laurel and
Oliver Hardy made between 1927 and 1945, mostly at the comedy mill known as
Hal Roach Studios.;     The films, which are still owned by Hal Roach Studios
and are not generally circulated, are being hand-delivered to the Towne by
Lois Laurel Hawes, Laurel's daughter. Hawes, accompanied by one of the
original members of Our Gang/Little Rascals, Dorothy DeBorba, will introduce
the films.;    The Towne will show two shorts, "Two Tars" and "Towed in a
Hole," and the feature film "Saps at Sea.";    "Two Tars" is an early silent
short that will have piano accompaniment at the Towne. "Saps at Sea," made in
1940, is the last feature film Laurel and Hardy made for Roach, Cassara says.
It signals the end of the duo's most productive period.;    Cassara learned
his love of Laurel and Hardy from his father, who used to rush to the Jose
Theatre in downtown San Jose whenever one of their new features was released.
Cassara fed his affection for their slapstick, physical comedy by watching the
Laurel and Hardy shorts, which were widely shown on television in the 1950s.; 
  Now, Cassara says, films are enjoying a small revival, as they are released
on video.;    "First of all, it's like a nostalgia feeling of times when
things were simpler, and comedy was true," says Cassara, explaining the appeal
of Laurel and Hardy almost 50 years after they stopped making films. "They did
not rely on smart-alecky remarks or words. They were very, very visual, like a
living cartoon.";    And then there's the appeal of the men themselves, says
Cassara. "They're very dignified, but life just slams the door in their faces.
But they're still very optimistic. They keep on trying. You just have to root
for them."; LAUREL AND HARDY FESTIVAL; When: 1:15 p.m. Sunday; Where: The
Towne Theatre, 1433 The Alameda, San Jose.; Tickets: $5 general admission, $4
for students and $3 for children under 12 and adults over 62.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Historian: Johnson Didn't Steal Election; Others Did</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lyndon Johnson didn't steal the
1948 Senate election, as a recent biography contends, but a
political boss might have rigged the election to get Johnson's
opponent, says a close Johnson associate.
   Joe B. Frantz, now a history professor, contends the election
was stolen for Johnson, possibly without his knowledge, by a
disgruntled south Texas political boss eager to derail the
opponent, Coke Stevenson.
   Johnson won the election by 87 votes out of almost a million
cast, collecting 99 percent of the south Texas vote.
   ``There's no question the election was stolen,'' Frantz said,
but he contends that political boss George Parr filched it to spite
Stevenson, not necessarily to help Johnson.
   Frantz said he revealed the information at a recent historical
society banquet because of accusations against Johnson by Robert A.
Caro in ``Means of Ascent,'' the second volume in Caro's biography
of Johnson.
   Frantz, a White House aide under Johson and former chairman of
the University of Texas history department, teaches at Corpus
Christi State University.
   Frantz put together the Oral History Project for the Johnson
Presidential Library in Austin, taping interviews with nearly 1,000
people, including Johnson's political enemies.
   He said his information about Parr's political vendetta against
Stevenson came from an interview he conducted with Stevenson when
the former governor was in his 80s. Stevenson died in 1975 at age
87.
   ``It would have been in the early 1970s,'' Frantz told The
Associated Press. ``He set me down and he said, `I'm going to give
you the straight story' ...''
   Stevenson and Parr had always been close allies, Stevenson told
Frantz, until Parr asked Stevenson, then governor, to name a
certain man judge at Laredo.
   Stevenson refused because ``the fellow was an absolute rascal
and into evey sort of political sin available,'' Frantz said.
   Parr promised revenge, the professor said.
   ``The feeling is that Parr decided, `I'm going to teach Coke
Stevenson a lesson and, at the same time, get in very good with the
new senator from Texas,''' Frantz said.
   Frantz was unable to locate Parr to interview him before Parr
died in the mid-1970s.
   Frantz said he interviewed the man responsible for disposing of
votes from a contested box before a recount could be held.
   He said he came away from the encounter convinced the south
Texans were guilty of stuffing the box, which disappeared after the
count, with illegal votes.
   ``They were a bunch of rascals,'' he said.
   Frantz said he thought Caro's characterization of Johnson in his
first volume, ``The Path to Power,'' was slanted against his
subject.
   He said that he felt that in the second book Caro expressed
annoyance ``as if Johnson had pulled off the dirtiest steal in
history. He doesn't see things in the context of the times.''
   ``We didn't know what a secret ballot was,'' Frantz said. ``I
grew up in Weatherford, and all the precincts used to vote in the
same room in the courthouse and all the courthouse hangers-on would
stand around and watch you.''
   It was not at all unusual for campaigners to know how a vote was
going before balloting ended, he said, and for people to round up
votes midway through the voting to counteract trends.
   ``I was sort of amused by Robert Caro's almost innocence in how
dirty all this was,'' said Frantz, former director of the Texas
State Historical Association. ``When the national press seized on
it, it's like he expected some sort of local paradox down here.
Actually it's no dirtier than anywhere else.''

<F P=106> [Unattributed talk: "The Puppets Are Accelerating Chemical </F>
War Preparations"] 
  [Text] Today our people and peaceloving people of the 
world are strongly demanding complete abolition of chemical 
weapons, in addition to nuclear weapons -- mass lethal weapons. 
  Chemical weapons, which kill and injure people by using 
poisonous chemical materials, are branded as the most cruel 
massacre weapons in the world and thus their use and development 
have been prohibited by international commitments. 
  Only traitor Kim Yong-sam, who hangs out the signboard of 
civilian politics, is openly pursuing possession of chemical 
weapons. 
  This shows that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is going to 
openly perpetrate not only nuclear war, but also chemical war, 
against fellow countrymen. We cannot but regard it as very 
grave. As has already been known, successive ruling bunches have 
produced and stockpiled chemical weapons from long ago. There 
are more than 40 underground nuclear warehouses and underground 
chemical weapon warehouses in areas around Mt. Kyeryong in South 
Chungchong Province and in the area near Suwon, Kyonggi 
Province. Many ion chemical weapons, known as malicious mass 
lethal weapons, are stockpiled there. 
  While talking about possession of independent chemical 
warfare capability, former South Korean dictators built more 
than 10 poisonous gas plants in South Korea and produced a great 
number of chemical weapons. 
  The rascals brought from the United States on a large scale 
military aircraft capable of dropping chemical bombs and 155-mm 
[word indistinct] guns capable of firing the bombs. They also 
purchased gas masks on a pretext of preparing for chemical 
warfare. 
  A chemical, biological, and radiological unit school has 
been 
operating in the puppet Army for a long time to train 
professional chemical warfare experts. 
  By loudly raving that chemical warfare has become a 
worldwide 
trend, the former puppet warmongers exhibited various chemical 
equipment they produced and even propagandized its superiority. 
  The Team Spirit joint military exercise, conducted every 
year 
in South Korea, has become an important leverage to achieve not 
only the nuclear war plan, but also the rascals' chemical war 
plan. New chemical war equipment was mobilized in the recent 
Team Spirit joint military exercise and units specializing in 
chemical war training participated in the exercise. 
  Reporting on the true aspect of chemical war exercises 
conducted during the Team Spirit joint military exercise several 
years ago, a South Korean broadcast said that in addition to 
aircraft attacks on simulated areas in the North side, smoke 
bombs, chemical shells, bacterial shells, and even explosive 
shells, were dropped during the exercise. As the result, all 
living things can barely survive. 
  Just as former dictators, puppet Kim Yong-sam, who claims to 
be a civilian politician in South Korea, is also scheming to 
inflict, not only nuclear disaster, but also poisonous gas 
calamity on fellow countrymen by clinging to the sleeves of 
outside forces. 
  The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, in a so-called conference of 
offices and agencies concerned, decided to possess chemical 
weapons and to submit the bill to National Assembly for 
ratification. 
  This clearly shows how frantically the rascals are running 
amok with chemical war preparations. 
  Going against the trend of the time toward disarmament and 
detente, the civilian warmongers are accelerating production of 
chemical weapons -- mass lethal weapons the use of which is 
prohibited worldwide -- and are attempting to inflict the 
disaster of chemical weapons on fellow countrymen. Their crime 
will not be pardoned forever. 
  The puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam should give up criminal 
chemical war preparations and should act with discretion. 
  If the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, in spite of the warnings 
of our people and the people of the world, is advancing along 
the road of continuously committing antinational maneuvers to 
accelerate preparation of nuclear war and chemical war on the 
Korean peninsula in collusion with outside forces, the rascals 
cannot avoid the responsibility for all consequences arising 
therefrom nor can they evade the stern judgment of history.

<HEAD>Not Many `Rascals' Out, But THRO Vows to Try Again</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national grassroots drive to oust incumbent
politicians may have failed this election year, but its founder
said Thursday he is already looking ahead to the 1992 elections.
   ``We're going to take a look at what we did wrong and how we can
make it better. Then it's back to business,'' Jack Gargan said.
``Now we have the funding, credibility - and two years.''
   Gargan said his group, ``Throw the Hypocritical Rascals Out'' or
THRO, intends to buy a full-page advertisement in USA Today to
thank supporters nationwide, then begin looking toward 1992 and
races for president and Congress.
   ``We're going to say `thank you, America' and let folks know
we're going for bear in '92,'' he said.
   Gargan said a national taxpayer association representative told
him Thursday that Tuesday's races involving incumbents were roughly
12 percent closer than had been predicted.
   ``When you can go from a dead stop in 132 days and make a 12
percent impact with no staff, no funding and no experience, it's
heartwarming,'' he said.
   Gargan, 59, who is a financial planner, formed the non-profit
THRO in June and targeted members of Congress as irresponsible
spenders to be voted out. He used $9,000 in retirement money to buy
a full-page local newspaper advertisement headlined: ``I'm mad as
hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!''
   Since then, he said he's received about $600,000 in
contributions and letters from more than 70,000 people. As the
money came in, he bought ads in newspapers small and large, urging
people to vote against all incumbents in all races.
   While he doesn't have final figures yet, Gargan said the
campaign war chest should have $100,000 to $200,000 left.
   ``We became sort of a threat and we forced them (incumbents) to
spend much more of that PAC (political action committee) money to
boost themselves,'' he said. ``We also made people across this
nation step back and look at who's running this country.''
   Gary Koops, spokesman for the Republican Congressional Campaign
Committee in Washington, said THRO reflected the discontent of
voters nationwide who were weary of ``business as usual'' in
Congress.
   ``Many incumbents who'll be going back to Washington were scared
for their political lives,'' Koops said.
   Others - such as Hollis Friedman, a spokeswoman for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington - said
the anti-incumbent sentiment was overblown.
   ``The few incumbents that did lose lost because they weren't
addressing the people's needs and interests properly and not
because people just wanted to get rid of an incumbent,'' Friedman
said.
   Robin Krivanek, Hillsborough County supervisor of elections,
said the anti-incumbent mood came through loud and clear locally.
   ``What amazed us is that there were people out there taking a
blanket approach to this campaign,'' Krivanek said. ``We had people
who had no idea of who these people were but wanted their names so
they could vote them out.''

<F P=106> [Commentary by station commentator Chong Pong-kil: "Not </F>
Separation But Collusion"] 
  [Text] Broadcast reports from Seoul disclosed the fact 
that Yi Pyong-tae, the recently appointed puppet defense 
minister, was a member of the Hanahoe. 
  The Hanahoe, a political military club at the center of 
criticism from every strata of South Korea, was a powerful group 
of fascist military hooligans basically composed of former 
members of the Chilsonghoe. The Chilsonghoe had consisted of 
seven generals--namely Chon Tu-hwan, No Tae-u, Son Yong-kil, 
Chong Ho-yong, Kwon Ik-hyon, Choe Sung-tae, and Paek 
Un-taek--who hailed from Kyongsang Province and graduated in the 
11th class of the South Korean Military Academy. 
  While under the patronage of traitor Pak Chong-hui following 
the 16 May Coup, they changed the name of Chilsonghoe to the 
Hanahoe when they were pinned with the insignia of major on 
their shoulders. Being on the lookout to seize power, they 
increased membership to approximately 200. 
  Following this, the rascals expanded their area of influence 
to include all graduates between the 11th to 36th graduating 
class of the South Korean Military Academy. Chon Tu-hwan, No 
Tae-u, Chong Ho-yong, and Pak Chun-pyong, the chief culprits 
behind the 12 December coup and the Kwangju massacre, were 
Hanahoe members. Chang Se-tong, Ho Sam-su, and Ho Hwa-pyong, 
the henchmen to traitor Chon Tu-hwan in the Fifth Republic, were 
nests of the Hanahoe. 
  The fact that Yi Pyong-tae, who has assumed the position of 
puppet defense minister, was a member of the notorious secret 
military group shocks the South Korean people. 
  The appointment of Yi Pyong-tae a member of the secret group 
of vicious military gangsters as puppet defense minister by 
puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam all but shows his intention to 
revive the Fifth and Sixth Republics's influence and repeat the 
fascist suppressive rule of the Fifth and Sixth Republics in 
South Korea. 
  As everyone knows, the Kim Yong-sam group has prattled as 
though the Hanahoe had been broken up and took measures as 
though to remove Hanahoe members not only from the puppet 
regime, but also from the military when Traitor Kim Yong-sam 
raved that he would wipe out the Hanahoe members from the 
civilian regime, and the puppet Army announced that 10 colonels 
who were Hanahoe members would be excluded from promotions. 
  However, this was a trick to deceive the South Korean 
people. 
The chieftain of the civilian regime has not separated itself 
from the Fifth and Sixth Republics but are colluding with them. 
  With the people's spirit of resistance growing higher due to 
the rice market opening, traitor Kim Yong-sam attempted to 
appease the people's protests by means of shifting the blame 
onto his stooges and firing them, while naming vicious military 
gangsters to important posts. 
  These facts show that the Kim Yong-sam group has not 
eliminated the Fifth and Sixth Republics's forces and prove, 
even worse, that it drew the rascals into its civilian regime in 
order to resurrect the Fifth and Sixth Republics' military 
fascist terrorist rule. 
  In reality, the Kim Yong-sam group is carrying out fascist 
suppressive rule over the South Korean people more than ever 
before. On 28 December, traitor Kim Yong-sam, during his visit 
to the Seoul District Prosecution Office to check 
end-of-the-year readiness, made outbursts that he would not 
tolerate violent demonstrations. Even before taking office, the 
puppet interior minister, raved that it is okay for the 
investigators to torture political criminals. 
  By following the puppet traitor's suppressive order, South 
Korea is dripping with a warlike atmosphere and the people's 
righteous struggle for independence, democracy, and 
reunification are now being brutally oppressed. 
  Needless to say, the worsening fascist suppressive maneuvers 
of the Kim Yong-sam group are aimed at suppressing and 
obliterating the people's struggle to oppose the rice market 
opening. 
  Attempting to defuse his regime's crisis, puppet traitor Kim 
Yong-sam named the Hanahoe group's military gangsters and 
fascist oppressors whom the South Korean people criticize in 
order to oppress and obliterate the people's antigovernment 
struggle. Nonetheless, this is nothing but a last-ditch 
resistance by one who faces a tragic end. The fascist 
suppression will only heighten the resistance of the people and 
hasten the self destruction.

A national push to "throw the rascals out" didn't materialize in Southeast-area 
congressional races this year. 
</P>
<P>
Seven incumbents, some of them fending off spirited attacks by challengers, won 
reelection by solid margins in Tuesday's election. 
</P>
<P>
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a conservative Long Beach Republican, won handily 
despite being stung in recent weeks by allegations that he used drugs as a 
youth and by the defeat in Congress of his proposal to withhold federal funding 
for art he considers obscene. Rohrabacher defeated political science instructor 
Guy Kimbrough in District 42, which stretches from Huntington Beach to 
Torrance. Rohrabacher also defeated Kimbrough two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a very outspoken congressman," Rohrabacher said. "If I can do that 
and still have a solid victory, it's a signal from the voters to our elected 
leaders that they should come out with strong stands." 
</P>
<P>
Four Democratic incumbents and two other Republican lawmakers easily prevailed 
in Southeast-area congressional races over an array of opponents. 
</P>
<P>
The only non-incumbent elected was Maxine Waters, a veteran Democratic 
assemblywoman who recorded a lopsided victory in District 29 to succeed the 
retiring Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins (D-Los Angeles). Hawkins has occupied the 
seat in the heavily Democratic district since 1962. The district covers 
South-Central Los Angeles, South Gate, Huntington Park and part of Downey. 
</P>
<P>
Rohrabacher's race against Democratic challenger Kimbrough heated up following 
the allegations of drug use, which first appeared in an article in New Republic 
magazine. But on Tuesday the congressman said the drug issue wasn't a factor 
because "it was so long ago." 
</P>
<P>
He called the controversial debate over funding for the National Endowment for 
the Arts a "wash" in the election. "It alienated some wealthy Republicans who 
go to the symphony," Rohrabacher said, "but it gave me support from some of the 
blue-collar Democrats." 
</P>
<P>
In his second term in Congress, he said, he plans to concentrate on expanding 
the opportunities for employee ownership of companies in the United States and 
developing a plane that will take off from a runway and fly into space. 
</P>
<P>
"Whichever nation controls that technology will dominate the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Rep. Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro) also rolled up a solid victory, 
despite being accused by his challenger of being a once-vigorous legislator who 
no longer had the energy to do the job after serving 11 terms. 
</P>
<P>
"This was a little tougher election, especially for incumbents," said Anderson, 
77, whose victory margin was a bit smaller than two years ago. "Normally when 
we have elections we don't have several hundred thousand troops someplace where 
there might be a war. People are unhappy about that and there was lots of press 
about throwing the rascals out." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson, who defeated Republican Sanford Kahn, said he didn't believe voters 
were swayed by the attack on the veteran lawmaker's ability to do the job. "I 
feel I'm much better now than I was 10 years ago," Anderson said. "I know more 
about the problems." 
</P>
<P>
District 32 covers San Pedro, Harbor City, Wilmington, Lakewood and parts of 
Long Beach and Downey. 
</P>
<P>
At a victory celebration at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles, Waters, 52, told 
a crowd of about 300 cheering supporters that she was going to Congress to 
continue fighting for the poor and disadvantaged as she had done during her 14 
years in the state Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to do what I've always done," she said. "I'm going to be a voice for 
the people who sent me." 
</P>
<P>
One of her first priorities, she said, will be passing a civil rights measure. 
President Bush recently vetoed the Civil Rights Acts of 1990 and the move to 
override his veto failed by one vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I plan to talk with all of (the congressmen) and let them know that we're not 
going away on this issue of civil rights," Waters said. "I'm going to fight and 
fight and fight to ensure that we pass a civil rights bill." 
</P>
<P>
Waters' Republican opponent, Bill DeWitt, a former South Gate councilman, said 
he had no illusions about winning in a district where Democrats outnumber 
Republicans 7 to 1. "I went into it with my eyes open," he said. "I knew the

FT  16 JUL 94 / World Cup '94: Losing wagers litter path to final
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Betting-wise, the World Cup has not proved my finest hour, writes Michael
Thompson-Noel. No bookmakers have topped themselves as a result of my bets,
which is always the bonus I savour most.
I got over-heated to start with; then slowed to a crawl; and was finally
flattened by queasiness at the sight of Brazil's shrinking odds. In short:
bad strategy, poor money management, and loss of nerve.
I started too excitedly, backing Colombia and Argentina, then Romania,
Nigeria and Germany, and eventually Bulgaria - six squads of shirt-lifters.
Between them, these australopithecines cost me Pounds 308 (including tax).
The only sensible bet I made all month was Pounds 60 Brazil to win the World
Cup at 3-1, which was the best price you could find in London on June 17.
Italy were 6-1 that day, but I have never backed Italy in my life. On the
other hand, the bookies were offering half-odds if teams reached the final,
so there must be thousands of Italians already showing a huge collective
profit.
This is what attracted me to Romania at 33-1 after they trounced Colombia.
Romania - I divined - were a team from the 21st century; pity about their
penalty-taking.
As the tournament progressed and Brazil looked far from convincing, I stared
in horror at their rapidly-shrinking price. This was my big mistake.
There is a streak of showiness in my character which at times mutates into a
bulging vein of vulgarity. Among other things, this makes me a
contra-bettor. I disdain sensibly-priced favourites such as Brazil and
instead bet on flashy outsiders such as Nigeria, Romania and Bulgaria.
As things stand, I will lose Pounds 134 even if Brazil win tomorrow. So
yesterday I rang the wretched bookies, looking for an escape.
I started with the rascals at Ladbroke, which calls itself, smugly, the
biggest bookmaker in the solar system. Brazil, said Ladbroke, are now 8-15
to win the cup, and Italy 11-8. This is no help to me. I never bet odds-on.
So I questioned the rascals severely. I asked them what the odds were
against Brazil beating Italy 4-1, as they did in the World Cup final in
1970. Answer: 40-1. Brazil to win by 10 goals to nil? Answer: 100-1.
These odds are inhumanly cramped. I would rather buy blood from a vampire.
But I believe I have no choice. With a mighty smirk and swagger, I will
today bet Pounds 20 on a 4-1 Brazilian win and Pounds 20 on a 10-0 pasting.
I mean, Italy?

   How many episodes of a situation comedy does it take to enrage the Polish-American community in one of the nation's largest cities? 

   Just one, as WDIV-TV here abruptly learned last week. 

   On Thursday the National Broadcasting Co. affiliate aired the first episode of "Hamtramck," its very own locally produced sitcom about the life and times of the Hamlin family in Hamtramck, Mich. 
The town, (pronounced Ham-TRAM-ick), is a largely Polish community on Detroit's east side. 

   Never mind that Hamlin isn't a Polish name, and that the family -- according to one of the characters on the show -- is supposed to be "one-quarter Irish, one-third French, two-fifths Armenian and three-eighths Czechoslovakian . . . with a dash of Viking thrown in." 
The Polish-joke stereotypes were still there. 

   The oldest son is a priest. 
The teen-age son thinks Ronald Reagan is president of the local Polish Century Club. 
And the mother invites both the pope and Mr. Reagan to attend her daughter's marriage. 

   At the wedding, which is held in Hamtramck, one guest steals a centerpiece, some female guests show up wearing stockings tied at the knees, and the "orchestra" is a rag-tag group called "Stan the Man and His Polka Rascals." 

   Such delicate humor was lost on the real-life residents of Hamtramck, some 500 of whom called Mayor Robert Kozaren on Friday to complain. 
Late that afternoon he issued a statement, declaring: "Everything that Poles stand for -- traditions, respect for our priests and our Pope . . . even the gaiety and color of our weddings -- was portrayed in a crude and insulting way." 

   At a Saturday news conference with the mayor, WDIV's president and general manager, Amy McCombs, apologized for the show and announced that the station would air a prime-time special about "the real Hamtramck." 
She added, "We knew it was risky to use comedy, but we felt that by using comedy, we would get people to laugh at themselves." 

   Although Ms. McCombs and Alan Frank, vice president for programming and production for Post-Newsweek stations, which owns WDIV, indicated that they still have plans for a locally produced sitcom, it won't contain the Hamlins, and it won't be named "Hamtramck." 

   "People react strongly when you use the name of their city," says Mr. Frank. 
"I think the reaction here is more to the name than to what was in the program."

  [Text] The South Korean puppets committed a grave military 
provocation by illegally infiltrating a combat ship deep into 
our side's territorial waters on the West Sea yesterday [5 
December]. 
  At around 1358 [1058 GMT] yesterday, in broad daylight, the 
South Korean puppets infiltrated three combat ships from 
Taechongdo into our side's territorial waters. The combat ship 
group, which infiltrated deeply into our side's territorial 
waters, undertook a combat formation near Chaejak-ri, 
Ongjin-county, South Hwanghae Province with the purpose of 
realizing a hostile attempt. 
  The Korean People's Army's Navy patrol ships, which were 
thoroughly defending the sea guardpost of our socialist 
fatherland, immediately went to the spot and the sea-based 
cannons [haesangpo] undertook a combat posture to take a 
self-defensive measure. Taken by surprise, the rascals 
hurriedly fled southward. 
  The South Korean puppets' reckless maritime infiltration 
activity is a deliberate and premeditated military provocation 
to aggravate artificially the tension on the Korean peninsula. 
  The South Korean puppets should deeply consider the grave 
consequence of the rascals' military provocation and should not 
act rashly. 
  If the South Korean puppets constantly go down the road of 
confrontation and war in spite of our repeated warning, our 
people and People's Army will impose a thousand-fold stern 
retaliation against the aggressors.

  [Text] According to military sources, on 14 June the South 
Korean puppets committed a provocative act of illegally bringing 
recoilless guns into the Demilitarized Zone [DMZ]. 
  At around 09:15 [00:15 GMT] on 14 June, the puppet army's 
armed rascals brought in, and installed at an encampment, 90-mm 
recoilless guns inside the DMZ 600 meters south of the Military 
Demarcation Line [MDL] Marker No. 0412 in front of Kumsa-ri, 
Chorwon County. They took a firing position at our side, thereby 
gravely threatening the safety of our People's Army soldiers who 
were on routine duty at a guard post. 
  At around 08:40 [23:40 GMT] on the same day, a numerous 
number of the puppet army soldiers equipped with automatic 
weapons were inciting a war atmosphere while touring about this 
area by sneaking into the DMZ area southeast of the MDL Marker 
Nos. 0140 and 0170 in front of (?Mt. Taedok) in Changpung County 
on the western frontline and--prior to this, at around 07:50 
[22:50 GMT]--into the DMZ area south of the MDL Marker No. 0468 
in front of Mabang-ri, Chorwon County on the central front line. 
  This is the South Korean puppets' intentional and 
premeditated maneuverings aimed at artificially aggravating the 
situation inside the DMZ area on the MDL and arousing a 
North-South confrontation. 
  The South Korean puppets should profoundly consider the 
grave 
consequences the rascals will cause by their reckless 
provocative acts and should not do rash and thoughtless acts.

<TEXT>
   The tiny band of voters who shaped the 1990
primary election season sent a clear message: beware of jumping to
any conclusions about the mood of the electorate this year.
   Consider these bits of conventional wisdom widely circulated in
1990:
   _Public concern about a squishy economy and anger over the
savings and loan scandal have created an anti-incumbent mood.
``Throw the rascals out,'' will be the battle cry of voters.
   _The 1989 Supreme Court decision giving states latitude to
restrict access to abortion changed the impact of that issue
decisively in favor of candidates who support abortion rights.
   But the only rascal thrown out in a primary was Rep. Donald
``Buz'' Lukens, an Ohio Republican who had been convicted of having
sex with a minor.
   Others seemed threatened _ most recently, Gov. Rudy Perpich of
Minnesota and Rep. Roy Dyson of Maryland. But both Democrats turned
back primary challenges on Tuesday. And a month ago, Republican
Gov. Mike Hayden of Kansas won a primary he was widely expected to
lose.
   The Perpich and Dyson victories also defied the conventional
assumptions on abortion. Both incumbents were in the anti-abortion
camp and defeated challengers who were pro-choice.
   Patricia Ireland, executive vice president of the National
Organization for Women, contended that Perpich's victory was not a
clear test of abortion sentiment because the governor's running
mate was a pro-choice woman and he was considered very supportive
of women on other issues.
   ``It was not a clear up-or-down vote, although, of course, if we
had won it we would have been much happier,'' she said.
   Democratic Party chairman Ronald H. Brown, when asked about an
anti-incumbent trend, said, ``I haven't seen any.''
   ``There's some sign of that, but not a prairie fire,'' said
Charles Black, the leading spokesman for the Republican Party.
   Both party officials claimed they were pleased with the
candidates who have emerged from the primaries. After Tuesday's
elections in 10 states and the District of Columbia, only a handful
of states have yet to hold their primaries.
   ``I wish the general election was tomorrow,'' said Brown.
   ``We're happy with the nominees that we've got,'' said Black. He
also said he was delighted that the Democrats had renominated
Perpich, whom the Republicans consider one of the most vulnerable
incumbents.
   In several other states, Democratic primary voters tossed aside
the assumptions of party leaders and arguably strengthened the
party's ticket.
   Most prominent among those was California, where the party
establishment was strongly behind state Attorney General John Van
de Kamp for the gubernatorial nomination. But Van de Kamp also was
widely viewed as a certain underdog in a contest against Republican
Sen. Pete Wilson.
   Party leaders gave former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein
little chance to sidetrack Van de Kamp's drive for the nomination.
But she won the primary going away and is in a dead-heat race with
Wilson.
   In Kansas, Democratic leaders assumed former Gov. John Carlin
was their strongest challenger to Hayden. But the voters clearly
saw Carlin as part of the state's economic problems and gave the
Democratic statehouse nomination to state Treasurer Joan Finney.
   Florida Democratic primary voters overwhelmingly backed former
Sen. Lawton Chiles over the early establishment choice, Rep. Bill
Nelson, for governor.
   Harvey Gantt is running a close race against Republican Sen.
Jesse Helms of North Carolina. Gantt, the black former mayor of
Charlotte, had been given little chance last spring of beating
prosecutor Mike Easley in a runoff.
   The latest round of primaries was particularly tough on
assumptions about the impact of abortion.
   Not only did Perpich and Dyson successfully defy the
conventional wisdom, but the issue failed to make a perceptible
dent in the victory margins in New Hampshire of Rep. Bob Smith and
Sen. Gordon Humphrey.
   Try as he might, lawyer Tom Christo failed to make abortion an
issue in the Republican Senate primary in which he and Smith
competed for the nomination to succeed Humphrey.
   Humphrey, surrendering his U.S. Senate seat and seeking a seat
in the New Hampshire Senate, overcame a primary challenge from a
state legislator who had strong backing from the National Abortion
Rights Action League.
   ``There's no one we'd rather beat than Gordon Humphrey,'' said
NARAL's Peg Dobbie. Despite NARAL's best efforts, the senator
captured 58 percent of the primary vote.
   But pro-choice advocates also had races they could cite to
support their view of the impact of the abortion issue. Three
Maryland state senators who led a filibuster against abortion
rights legislation were defeated by pro-choice primary challengers.
   ``What we learned from the primary season is that abortion is
not necessarily a silver bullet in every race,'' said NARAL
executive director Kate Michelman. ``It can be powerful, but ...
it's not going to make every candidate a winner.''

<LEADPARA>  WHY did the pre-mellow Miles Davis turn his back on his audience and walk
offstage when someone else was soloing? He must have been thinking of Duke
Ellington's 1935 brass section swaying to the music, nearly breaking their
faces with idiotic grins. Or perhaps he was remembering Louis Armstrong decked
out in a leopard-skin toga and mugging relentlessly on "I'll Be Glad When
You're Dead, You Rascal, You" from "Rhapsody in Black and Blue" (1932).;   
Both examples can be seen tonight in "Giants of Jazz," a compilation of short
films and film clips from the 1930s to the 1960s, the Towne theater's salute
to the San Jose Jazz Festival (details, Page 17).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But the eye-rolling, exaggerated gestures and other humiliating theatrics
that blacks adopted in the name of entertainment are only half the story. For
one thing, jazz artists don't have to do that anymore. (Now they can starve
with dignity while the airplay goes to white, heavy-metal clowns.);    But
seriously, the creative energy of Armstrong, Ellington and Fats Waller shines
through the tragic, pasted-on smiles and bedazzles us even today. And the
progress that has been made since the '30s can be seen on the screen.;   
Although the poor sap with "an ear for music and a nose for pork chops" gets
crowned with a mop in "Black and Blue" (1932), by the time we get to "Date
with Dizzy" (1956), it's the white producer (of a commercial for Instant Rope
Ladder) who's the foil, while the musicians are treated with respect.;   
They're even named, which is not, unfortunately, the case throughout this
compilation. In fact, there's an appalling lack of information. Who's playing
and when? Why couldn't we be told in subtitles?;    And for my taste, there's
too much material from the '30s and '40s (Count Basie, Cab Calloway, Lionel
Hampton) and not enough from the '50s and '60s (Lester Young, Gillespie, John
Handy).;    To these ears, "Giants of Jazz" implies something more
comprehensive. Where are Coleman Hawkins, Thelonious Monk, Charles Mingus, Art
Blakey, Miles Davis?;    These reservations aside, it's still two hours well
spent. We get to hear a slouching Lester Young produce miraculously sensual
lines through a tenor sax held sideways with fingers clutching a lighted
cigarette. We get to see the faces of young and old, the blissful and puzzled
listeners as the John Handy Quintet storms San Francisco's Stern Grove in a
1968 performance of "Spanish Lady," the grove's first jazz show.;    And we
get to see Eubie Blake's orchestra pop out of a "blackbird pie" (1932); Nat
King Cole sing "Little Girl" (1951) and tickle the ivories without ever
looking at his hands; a clay-figure Jimmy Carter emote to (Ray Charles')
"Georgia on My Mind"; and Pearl Bailey "beat out that rhythm on a drum" --
with a lot of help from Max Roach -- in a clip from "Carmen Jones" (1954).;   
The quality of the music and the sound reproduction are uneven, as one would
expect, but all the clips are serviceable. The films vary from the sublimely
ridiculous (Armstrong) to downright offensive (Calloway) to just plain sublime
(Young). Fans of jazz and/or film history will have a field day.;     Giants

He is summoned to "The Pits" and handed the ball. In this drill, Too Short is 
mano a mano against Stanley Carranza, a 14-year-old freshman. It's a fair match 
up: Stanley himself is 5 feet, 3 inches and 105 pounds. It's Jose's job to get 
past Stanley and Stanley's job to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
"Come on, Too Short!" a teammate calls out. "Do it, Too Short!" shouts another. 
</P>
<P>
Jose breaks right -- he's quick -- and there is the crunch of helmets and 
shoulder pads. Legs pumping, he gains a yard, maybe two, before Stanley steers 
him to the turf.

147 Students Try Out 
</P>
<P>
The glory, if it comes at all, comes in the fall. But for players, football 
season begins during the dog days of summer vacation. Jose and Stanley are just 
two of 147 students giving it the old high school try at Belmont near downtown, 
the state's largest secondary school with more than 4,300 students, mostly 
immigrants. In Los Angeles County, home to more than 180 high schools, 
thousands of boys are out for football. 
</P>
<P>
About 10% drop out during conditioning drills -- three weeks of endless 
push-ups, sit-ups and wind sprints. Those who survive are rewarded with "Hell 
Week," the first practices in helmets and pads. At most schools, "Hell Week" is 
a grueling ordeal of two-a-day practices -- a period that helps coaches 
separate players by ability and character. Year-round schools such as Belmont, 
able to have only one practice a day, are given two weeks to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its size, Belmont is no powerhouse. Last year, the varsity won four 
games and lost six. As for their chances this year, "Hope springs eternal," 
says Coach Rob Leavy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Will Warm Benches 
</P>
<P>
Winning is not the only thing at Belmont. For many, in fact, practice will be 
the only thing. Several players will go the full season, the coaches say, 
without playing a single down. 
</P>
<P>
What players get from football, Leavy says, is "a sense of belonging." 
</P>
<P>
Nobody gets cut for lack of size, only for poor grades or gang membership. In 
the neighborhoods around Belmont, gangs go by such names as Rockwood, 
Headhunters, Echo Park, Rascals, Crazy Riders, Big Top, Diamond Street and 
Satanas. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach says, 'This is our gang. You belong to any other gang and you're out,' " 
one player explains. A few players are "gang-bangers," the player confides, but 
they're quiet about it. 
</P>
<P>
Only a few will score touchdowns or make the big tackle. At Belmont, 53 players 
are assigned to varsity and junior varsity, and 93 are on the "B team," made up 
essentially of the younger, smaller players. Each team is allowed only 11 
players on the field at a time, which means that scores of Sentinels will be 
bench warmers. Nobody likes to sit on the bench, yet only a few quit. The 
common denominator is desire. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Determined to Play 
</P>
<P>
Joe Alviar, a 17-year-old, 120-pound defensive end, didn't play a single down 
last year but is determined to play this year. "That's why I came out. . . . I 
didn't want to waste all that time out there running last year," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Alex Palomares, a 14-year-old freshman, is a 5-foot, 2-inch, 104-pound running 
back and a Belmont High legacy. His older brother, Jesse, was a star running 
back from the Class of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to try the hardest I can, but not make any promises to myself" about 
playing, Alex says. "It's not how big or how small you are, it's how much you 
want it." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Mario Serrano, a Belmont graduate now playing nose tackle for 
San Jose State, came to practice one day to give a pep talk about football and 
the classroom. When Serrano started out on Belmont B team, he weighed 130 
pounds and could bench-press 200, Coach Leavy recalls. Now Serrano weighs 235 
and presses 400.

Parents Happy 
</P>
<P>
The littlest football player in the biggest school has earned the respect of 
his teammates. Born in Guatemala, Jose Gaspar is a shy English-as-a-second 
language student. He tried playground basketball, "but I wasn't good enough." 
One of seven children, Jose says his parents are not worried about him playing 
such a violent game. "They're happy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Teammates remember when Jose first showed up in the weight room. Some people 
laughed, they said, because the weights he placed on the barbells were so 
small. 
</P>
<P>
One month ago, Jose was bench-pressing 85 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he's up to 130.
