   As the Middle East teeters on the edge of another war, my
thoughts go back to another time of tension in that troubled
and troublesome part of the world.
   I was in Israel on a journalistic mission in early June,
1967, just before the outbreak of what would be known as the
Six-Day War. Although war clouds were gathering -- as they
are now -- there was no certainty war would come. That the
outcome would be a decisive Israeli victory in only six days
was beyond belief.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In those tense days, a group of western reporters was
taken by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to a place near
Israel's southern border to watch a military training
exercise. It was a lackluster performance and I later
suspected that the Israelis put their rawest recruits on
display as part of efforts to persuade the world, and the
Arabs especially, that they were a weak country. Indeed, some
influential military analysts were convinced of that and it
may well have contributed to Arab overconfidence.
   During this low-key event, some of us chatted with a young
IDF lieutenant, who looked like what he was, a clean-cut
college kid who had only recently climbed into his reservist
uniform. He was not enthusiastic about fighting. "Wars never
settle anything," he said with some vehemence.
   War came anyway. Gamal Abdul Nasser, the Arab world's
strongman of that day, moved large numbers of tanks up
through the Sinai desert and told the U.N. "peacekeeping"
force near the Israeli border to get lost, which it quickly
did. He made a military alliance with Jordan's King Hussein.
Syria, Iraq and Kuwait mobilized. Nasser blockaded the Strait
of Tiran, denying Israel access to its southern port of
Eilat, and called up 100,000 reserves.
   Israel, of course, launched its famous early morning
pre-emptive air strike on Egypt, destroying most of Nasser's
air force on the ground and gaining mastery of the air.
Israeli tanks swept into the Sinai, and with the benefit of
close air support, routed the Egyptian forces. Syria and
Jordan were dealt with next, giving Israel command of the
Golan Heights, from which the Syrians had periodically
shelled Israeli kibbutzim, and possession of the land west of
the Jordan river that Jordan had previously occupied. Israel
achieved all of its military objectives in six days. Few
victories in history have been more complete.
   Whether a war with Saddam Hussein will be a short or long
one will be decided similarly. Allied planes and missiles
will be employed, as the Israeli air force was in 1967, to
try to knock out the enemy air force and antiaircraft
batteries. If this can be done, it will be decisive, and a
costly full-scale ground war will be avoided. Saddam's tanks
and their supply lines will have no defence against
systematic destruction inflicted from the air.
   This will be more difficult today than it was for the
Israelis in 1967. The Israeli attack caught the Egyptian air
force totally by surprise, something that cannot happen with
Iraq. The Iraqi tank deployments near the Saudi border are
covered by large numbers of surface-to-air missiles (SAMs),
which will have to be destroyed along with the Iraqi air
force. Complicated games with electronics and electronic
countermeasures will come into play, testing whether U.S.
technological superiority really exists to the extent
assumed.
   Aside from the military issues, there is another question
that can be illuminated by the lessons of the Six-Day War. It
has to do with whether the Middle East will become a more, or
less, peaceful place after a military action on the scale now
threatened. Recalling that young Israeli lieutenant, will a
war settle anything?
   The Six-Day War settled one thing with certainty. It
insured Israel's continued existence. I still remember the
sight of two young Israeli soldiers, one male and the other
female, roaring into Tel Aviv on a motor scooter from the
desert, joyously waving a captured Egyptian battle flag. For
them, it was a great victory.
   But only six years later, in the Yom Kippur War of 1973,
the whole process was repeated. This time it was the
Egyptians under Anwar Sadat who had the advantage of
surprise, pushing across the Suez Canal in force on Oct. 6.
By then the Egyptians had Russian SAMs to ward off Israeli
planes, and Egyptian generals handled their tank armies with
proficiency. Had it not been for a daring tank maneuver led
by Israeli General Ariel Sharon, crossing the Suez Canal to
get behind the Egyptian SAM batteries, the Egyptians might
have won.
   That second war settled something further. The Egyptians,
having given a good account of themselves, were ready to talk
peace and the ultimate result was the Camp David peace
accord. The U.S. sponsored the peace at some considerable
taxpayer expense in the form of financial aid to both sides.
But Camp David, which President Carter counted as the major
achievement of his presidency, left other matters still
unsettled, as they remain to this day. The insistence by
Saddam Hussein on a broad Middle East "peace conference"
focuses on Israel's continued occupation of the West Bank.
The Palestine Liberation Organization, claiming to represent
Palestinians displaced by Arab-Israeli wars since 1948, has
aligned itself with Saddam, helping him try to shift world
attention from his rape of Kuwait -- which also displaced a
lot of former Palestinians -- to the longstanding Arab
objective of mastering Israel.
   So if yet another war comes to the Middle East, what is it
likely to settle? One kind of answer is provided by a
memorable line of foreign affairs veteran George Kennan, who
once commented that there are no "final solutions" in
diplomacy. War, the ultimate coercive weapon of diplomacy,
never quite settles all scores.
   But it does settle some. Israel fought for its life in
1967 and won. Egypt decided after a second try in 1973 that
it wanted peace. Japan and Germany turned to democracy after
utter defeat in World War II and have benefitted greatly from
that change.
   Yet some wars settle very little. Korea remains divided.
Vietnam is a harsh and impoverished Communist police state.
Lebanon, where Ariel Sharon's attempt at pacification and
expulsion of the PLO in 1982 was ultimately defeated by world
opinion, was until recently a charnel house.
   The question that will face the U.S. and its allies if
they go to war over Kuwait will be a question of objectives.
Expulsion of Iraq from Kuwait is the objective set out in
U.N. Resolution 678. But a lasting solution will require
pacification of Iraq. It will demand a permanent western
military presence in the region to keep the peace.
   Which brings me back to that young IDF lieutenant. He was
killed on the first day of the Six-Day War, hit by shrapnel
while directing the fire of his rifle squad from an exposed
position in a half-track. Perhaps a premonition of his own
death motivated his anti-war remarks. He was both right and
wrong about wars settling things. A lot depends on the skill
and determination of the peace makers.

<HEAD>Mitterrand Inaugurates Normandy Battle Museum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR ALLEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAEN, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand inaugurated a
museum devoted to peace Monday at the site of one of the world's
great battles, and said he hoped it would help unify Europe.
   Flanked by dignitaries, Mitterrand marked the 44th anniversary of
the D-Day invasion of Normandy by calling on world leaders to be
``masters of our history,'' united frustrating a resurgence of ``the
forces of intolerance and oppression.''
   He said the museum was intended to emphasize that unity is
essential to peace.
   ``Peace will be based not only on the superpowers but also on a
strong, independent Europe,'' he said.
   Among those at the ceremony were the first German delegation to
attend a D-Day anniversary and a multinational group of 160
schoolchildren.
   Three million men fought in the 76-day Battle of Normandy that
began June 6, 1944, and 367,000 were killed or wounded. Victory for
the Allies forced the Germans into retreat and marked a turning
point in the war.
   The glass-and-white-stone structure stands on a bluff in a suburb
of Caen, atop a bunker used as a German division headquarters during
the Allied invasion. Fractured granite lines the narrow entrance to
the spacious main hall.
   Caen, in the British sector of the invasion front, was among the
many Normandy cities leveled. The museum was the idea of Mayor
Jean-Marie Girault, who called it the crowning achievement of the
city's reconstruction.
   It contains a collection of war relics including a British
bomber, German tanks, old rifles and uniforms. The six exhibits,
assembled by a team of top French historians, seek to explain the
causes of the war rather than glorify its battles.
   World War II was the first great war fought over political
ideology, museum organizers said.
   ``Although we were fighting battles over real estate, the war was
really about ideological matters,'' said U.S. Rep. Sam Gibbons, a
Florida Democrat and member of the American delegation to the
ceremony.
   Gibbons, a captain in the 501st Parachute Infantry, dropped
behind German lines during the invasion. He is the only Normandy
veteran in Congress.
   Historians of the French Institute for the History of the
Present, who developed the exhibits, said they were intended to
balance the traditional depiction of various phases of the war in
French textbooks.
   Textbooks tend to glorify the Resistance, while skirting the role
played by the Vichy regime, collaborators and the foreign troops who
freed France, historian Denis Peschanski said.
   ``The idea of this museum is to give cause for reflection rather
than to make the traditional arguments and appeals to emotional
response,'' he said.
   Along with British, Canadian and American regular armies, the
Normandy invasion force included soldiers from Czechoslovakia,
Poland, Norway, Greece, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and
France.
   Delegations from Italy, the Soviet Union and Japan also were
present Monday, including Yoshitaka Kawamato, director of the Peace
Museum at Hiroshima, Japan, site of the first nuclear bombing.

   Nations that fought in the Battle of Normandy will
mark the 44th anniversary of D-Day on Monday by opening a museum
dedicated to world peace.
   Instead of rusty tanks and yellowing propaganda posters, the
mammoth glass-and-stone memorial outside the city of Caen will house
multi-media exhibits that stress the lessons of World War II as much
as the battle itself.
   The museum includes a research center with computerized access to
war archives in France and overseas, a film and photography archive,
and six exhibits that explain the development of the war from its
origins in the post-World War I period.
   French President Francois Mitterrand will inaugurate the memorial
outside the Normandy town on Monday.
   Caen Mayor Jean-Marie Girault said his objective in building the
museum was to stress the fight against fascism, not to glorify
battlefield victories. U.S. Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., a supporter of
the project, concurred in an interview Saturday.
   ``Although we were fighting battles over real estate, the war was
really about ideological matters'' said Gibbons, who parachuted
behind German lines during the invasion and is the only Normandy
veteran still serving in Congress.
   He said the museum would show the ``whys'' of the
``disintegration of the world after World War I.''
   Allied forces landed along an 80-mile front of Normandy coastline
on June 6, 1944. More than 3 million soldiers fought for 76 days,
during which 367,000 men died or were wounded. The Allied triumph
crushed Nazi forces in France and marked a turning point in the war.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It started as a backyard picnic. Over the past
42 years it has become a family tradition for a special American
family, the veterans of the famed World War II jungle fighting unit
known as Merrill's Marauders. As one says, ``We're more than
friends.''

   They are old men now, many in their 80s, but they remain as
fierce in their loyalty to one another and to an annual tradition
as they were when they fought and suffered together and earned the
nickname Merrill's Marauders.
   For the 42nd year in a row the graying Marauders will assemble,
this time in Charlotte, N.C., on Sept. 2-4, to refight the old
battles and talk about Bull-Fight Brandy, a concoction of their own
never approved by the medics, and swap pictures of grandchildren.
   ``I'm sure there will be a few who will attend for the first
time along with those who show up every year,'' says Tom Martini of
Charlotte, this year's reunion chairman.
   ``The difficulty is in getting the word out. With so many moving
to new homes in retirement it's hard to keep a current mailing
list, which was never complete to begin with.
   ``After all these years, some guys arrive and say `I never knew
about it before.'''
   But they have never forgotten the Marauders.
   For six months in 1944, twice as long as the operation had been
originally planned, the Marauders became the stuff of legend. They
fought in five major and 30 minor actions against veteran Japanese
troops behind enemy lines in northern Burma. When their final
objective was taken, their force of 3,200 numbered fewer than 500
who could be classified as effective fighting men.
   ``Yes,'' says Marauder Phil Piazza of Seneca, S.C., ``we were
all volunteers, and, yes, we have discussed at our reunions why we
volunteered.
   ``Why did I? I guess I was a little bit crazy. I was single. I
was anxious to see some action. Don't forget, World War II was not
like the Vietnam War. We had a clear purpose. I wanted to be a part
of it. I think most of the others would tell you just about the
same thing.
   ``It was an experience none of us would want to relive. But it
had to be done, and we would do it again if necessary.''
   They had all responded to a request for volunteers for ``a
hazardous mission somewhere.'' They were never told where. And
there is evidence supporting Piazza's idea that they were men who
actually liked combat.
   In a book about the unit (written in part from material gathered
at a reunion) Marauder Charlton Ogburn, of Beaufort, S.C., recalled
the 1st Battalion commander suggesting, in a lull between battles,
that if nothing else was going to happen they might cross the ridge
and start a fight with 2nd Battalion.
   ``Of course he was joking,'' writes Ogburn, ``but all the same
...the idea had occurred to him.''
   Merrill's Marauder's was the name given by a Time Magazine
reporter to honor their commander, Brig. Gen. Frank Merrill. Their
official designation was 5307th Composite Unit (Provisional), which
led one Marauder, under fire, to wonder what the hell had become of
the other 5,306.
   They had come from Army units in the South Pacific, Puerto Rico,
Panama and the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Ga. Their job was
to cut Japanese communications, hit the enemy from the flank and
rear, and open the strategically important Ledo Road.
   They fought in jungle, never knowing what terror lay beyond the
next bend in the trail, and made famous such forgettable names as
Walawbum, Shaduzup, Nhpum Ga, Inkangatawng and Myitkyina. But they
never forgot.
   They lost 93 killed, 293 wounded and five times that many to
disease. ``In the end,'' wrote the medical historian of the
China-Burma-India theater, ``amoebas, bacteria, rickettsiae and
viruses, rather than Japanese soldiers and guns, vanquished the
most aggressive, bravest and toughest outfit that fought in the Far
East in the Second World War.''
   In the end, Merrill's Marauders won a Presidential Unit
Citation, six Distinguished Service Crosses, four Legions of Merit,
44 Silver Stars and a Bronze Star for every man in the regiment.
Their shoulder patch lives on as the symbol for the 1st Battalion
of the 75th Infantry Ranger Regiment.
   A few years ago a Marauder spotted a decal of the patch on the
window of a car ahead, chased the car for miles along the
Pennsylvania Turnpike, caught up, motioned for the driver to pull
over _ and learned about the reunion.
   Phil Piazza was the one who started the reunion. He was
commander of a heavy weapons company of Blue Combat team of 2nd
Battalion.
   ``We had three battalions, each with two combat teams.
Naturally, nobody in the unit could know all the 3,000 men in the
regiment, but I knew my company and my battalion. I lived in
Bridgeport, Conn., then, and after the war a few of us in the area
would get together from time to time and finally I said to them,
`Why not make it an annual affair?'
   ``We were all back working at new jobs and none of us had any
vacation time accumulated, so we picked Labor Day weekend. We held
the first reunion in my back yard. We worked from a list of
who-knows-where-who-is, and about 75 guys showed up.
   ``Well, Labor Day weekend became the traditional time to hold
it, which makes it difficult for some who have other family plans,
but in recent years we have always had 300 to 400 on hand. That
includes wives and children, and now, grandchildren.''
   Over the years, the generations, the reunion has grown from a
gathering of warriors to a fellowship of families. Some save up all
year for the annual blast.
   ``We've had some wonderful trips,'' says Jean Martini, whose
courtship with Tom included frequent letters to him in Burma.
``We've been to Phoenix, Chicago, Savannah, Charleston, St. Louis,
New York, Boston, Orlando and I can't remember where all. Last year
we went to New Orleans.''
   Romance has blossomed. The widow of a Marauder married a
Marauder widower. The son of a Marauder married the daughter of
another.
   ``We are closer than friends,'' Jean says. ``We are family. It's
a family reunion.''

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty years ago, the Soviet Union
invaded Finland and met the fierce ``ghost army'' of white-clad ski
troops whose gallant fight in a hopeless cause was admired around
the world.
   The Finns lost the 105-day war to their huge neighbor, but
memories of their courage helped make their independence secure
after World War II.
   ``The Russians were badly organized and stuck out like sore
thumbs against the white snow in their dark uniforms,'' said Capt.
Toivo Ahjopalo, who was a junior artillery officer on the shores of
Lake Ladoga on the Karelian isthmus.
   Although the Red Army soldiers were well equipped, their
strategy and planning were poor. Ahjopalo said his artillery unit
of two 57mm guns killed 1,600 Soviets in 48 hours.
   ``It was too easy ... almost shameful to kill them,'' he said.
``The Russians kept coming at us in straight lines and our two guns
picked them off like flies. The frozen lake was awash with blood.''
   A new Finnish movie called ``The Winter War'' will open
Thursday, the anniversary of the outbreak of what may have been the
coldest war in history. Several books and articles on the war also
have been published recently.
   In the era of glasnost, Soviet historians have increased their
casualty figures from fewer than 50,000 Soviet soldiers killed to
74,000, with more than 200,000 wounded.
   The official Finnish estimate of total Soviet casualties is
nearly 1 million, a number also hinted at in the memoirs of Nikita
S. Khrushchev, the former Soviet leader.
   Finland, a nation of 3.7 million in 1939, suffered 22,000
soldiers killed and 43,000 wounded.
   On Nov. 26, 1939, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav M. Molotov
accused Finnish troops of shooting across the border near Mainila,
a village in southeastern Finland. The Finns denied it, and Soviet
historians now say Josef Stalin used the incident as a pretext to
invade Finland four days later.
   ``It looks very likely that Stalin ordered the shots to be fired
by his own troops,'' said Alexander Dongarov, a Soviet Foreign
Ministry researcher. ``The Soviets were worried about developments
in Europe and a possible German attack on their territory through
Finland. Besides, there was great anti-Russian feeling and mistrust
in Finland at the time.''
   Dongarov spoke with The Associated Press during a visit to
Helsinki.
   The Winter War was fought in temperatures as low as minus 49
degrees. The severe cold caused frostbite and hallucinations that
forced guard duty tours to be reduced from two hours to 30 minutes.
   Adolf Hitler had occupied Austria in 1938, and in secret
negotiations with the Finns, Stalin demanded the right to build
fortifications in the Gulf of Finland to protect Leningrad. Finland
rejected that and other Soviet demands as violations of its
sovereignty.
   Negotiations broke down after 18 months. The Finns still did not
believe Stalin would attack, but Field Marshal Carl Gustaf
Mannerheim mobilized more than 180,000 men near the border for what
was called ``refresher training.''
   ``I was literally admiring the sky above Helsinki when suddenly,
totally unexpectedly, Russian planes broke through the clouds and
dropped their bombs,'' said Paul Sjoblom, who covered the war for
The Associated Press.
   Minutes later, he scrambled out of a bomb shelter and found the
mangled remains of his bicycle in the street.
   When the Finns had fought for three months against the Red Army,
which sent in 450,000 soldiers at the start of the war, they were
suffering from lack of reserves and ammunition.
   After a Soviet offensive in March 1940, Mannerheim rejected an
offer of aid from the Western powers as ``too little too late,''
and recommended a negotiated peace.
   A treaty was signed March 12 that forced Finland to cede large
areas of eastern Karelia to the Soviets. More than 400,000
Karelians had to be evacuated.
   ``The Winter War demonstrated once again that, when a great
power is faced by a small nation whose only goal is to survive,
calculations of strength cannot be based on pure arithmetic,''
wrote Max Jacobson, a former Finnish ambassador and statesman.
   ``In the vast drama of World War II, it was but a short episode.
Finland, like a recalcitrant pawn, refused to move to the square
assigned to it by those who controlled the chessboard. ... Finally,
it had to submit to fate.''
   Fifteen months after the battle ended, Finland went to war with
the Soviet Union again, on the side of Germany.

   Win the War, but Win the Peace Too

   As the Middle East teeters on the edge of another war, my
thoughts go back to another time of tension in that troubled
and troublesome part of the world.
   I was in Israel on a journalistic mission in early June,
1967, just before the outbreak of what would be known as the
Six-Day War. Although war clouds were gathering -- as they
are now -- there was no certainty war would come. That the
outcome would be a decisive Israeli victory in only six days
was beyond belief.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In those tense days, a group of western reporters was
taken by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to a place near
Israel's southern border to watch a military training
exercise. It was a lackluster performance and I later
suspected that the Israelis put their rawest recruits on
display as part of efforts to persuade the world, and the
Arabs especially, that they were a weak country. Indeed, some
influential military analysts were convinced of that and it
may well have contributed to Arab overconfidence.
   During this low-key event, some of us chatted with a young
IDF lieutenant, who looked like what he was, a clean-cut
college kid who had only recently climbed into his reservist
uniform. He was not enthusiastic about fighting. "Wars never
settle anything," he said with some vehemence.
   War came anyway. Gamal Abdul Nasser, the Arab world's
strongman of that day, moved large numbers of tanks up
through the Sinai desert and told the U.N. "peacekeeping"
force near the Israeli border to get lost, which it quickly
did. He made a military alliance with Jordan's King Hussein.
Syria, Iraq and Kuwait mobilized. Nasser blockaded the Strait
of Tiran, denying Israel access to its southern port of
Eilat, and called up 100,000 reserves.
   Israel, of course, launched its famous early morning
pre-emptive air strike on Egypt, destroying most of Nasser's
air force on the ground and gaining mastery of the air.
Israeli tanks swept into the Sinai, and with the benefit of
close air support, routed the Egyptian forces. Syria and
Jordan were dealt with next, giving Israel command of the
Golan Heights, from which the Syrians had periodically
shelled Israeli kibbutzim, and possession of the land west of
the Jordan river that Jordan had previously occupied. Israel
achieved all of its military objectives in six days. Few
victories in history have been more complete.
   Whether a war with Saddam Hussein will be a short or long
one will be decided similarly. Allied planes and missiles
will be employed, as the Israeli air force was in 1967, to
try to knock out the enemy air force and antiaircraft
batteries. If this can be done, it will be decisive, and a
costly full-scale ground war will be avoided. Saddam's tanks
and their supply lines will have no defence against
systematic destruction inflicted from the air.
   This will be more difficult today than it was for the
Israelis in 1967. The Israeli attack caught the Egyptian air
force totally by surprise, something that cannot happen with
Iraq. The Iraqi tank deployments near the Saudi border are
covered by large numbers of surface-to-air missiles (SAMs),
which will have to be destroyed along with the Iraqi air
force. Complicated games with electronics and electronic
countermeasures will come into play, testing whether U.S.
technological superiority really exists to the extent
assumed.
   Aside from the military issues, there is another question
that can be illuminated by the lessons of the Six-Day War. It
has to do with whether the Middle East will become a more, or
less, peaceful place after a military action on the scale now
threatened. Recalling that young Israeli lieutenant, will a
war settle anything?
   The Six-Day War settled one thing with certainty. It
insured Israel's continued existence. I still remember the
sight of two young Israeli soldiers, one male and the other
female, roaring into Tel Aviv on a motor scooter from the
desert, joyously waving a captured Egyptian battle flag. For
them, it was a great victory.
   But only six years later, in the Yom Kippur War of 1973,
the whole process was repeated. This time it was the
Egyptians under Anwar Sadat who had the advantage of
surprise, pushing across the Suez Canal in force on Oct. 6.
By then the Egyptians had Russian SAMs to ward off Israeli
planes, and Egyptian generals handled their tank armies with
proficiency. Had it not been for a daring tank maneuver led
by Israeli General Ariel Sharon, crossing the Suez Canal to
get behind the Egyptian SAM batteries, the Egyptians might
have won.
   That second war settled something further. The Egyptians,
having given a good account of themselves, were ready to talk
peace and the ultimate result was the Camp David peace
accord. The U.S. sponsored the peace at some considerable
taxpayer expense in the form of financial aid to both sides.
But Camp David, which President Carter counted as the major
achievement of his presidency, left other matters still
unsettled, as they remain to this day. The insistence by
Saddam Hussein on a broad Middle East "peace conference"
focuses on Israel's continued occupation of the West Bank.
The Palestine Liberation Organization, claiming to represent
Palestinians displaced by Arab-Israeli wars since 1948, has
aligned itself with Saddam, helping him try to shift world
attention from his rape of Kuwait -- which also displaced a
lot of former Palestinians -- to the longstanding Arab
objective of mastering Israel.
   So if yet another war comes to the Middle East, what is it
likely to settle? One kind of answer is provided by a
memorable line of foreign affairs veteran George Kennan, who
once commented that there are no "final solutions" in
diplomacy. War, the ultimate coercive weapon of diplomacy,
never quite settles all scores.
   But it does settle some. Israel fought for its life in
1967 and won. Egypt decided after a second try in 1973 that
it wanted peace. Japan and Germany turned to democracy after
utter defeat in World War II and have benefitted greatly from
that change.
   Yet some wars settle very little. Korea remains divided.
Vietnam is a harsh and impoverished Communist police state.
Lebanon, where Ariel Sharon's attempt at pacification and
expulsion of the PLO in 1982 was ultimately defeated by world
opinion, was until recently a charnel house.
   The question that will face the U.S. and its allies if
they go to war over Kuwait will be a question of objectives.
Expulsion of Iraq from Kuwait is the objective set out in
U.N. Resolution 678. But a lasting solution will require
pacification of Iraq. It will demand a permanent western
military presence in the region to keep the peace.
   Which brings me back to that young IDF lieutenant. He was
killed on the first day of the Six-Day War, hit by shrapnel
while directing the fire of his rifle squad from an exposed
position in a half-track. Perhaps a premonition of his own
death motivated his anti-war remarks. He was both right and
wrong about wars settling things. A lot depends on the skill
and determination of the peace makers.

   These days you can hardly turn on your television or scan your newspaper without being reminded of the Vietnam War.
And the thrust of much of it is that we were the "bad guys" who pulverized Indochina.
This is in spite of the fact we now know what the Communists of North Vietnam did to South Vietnam and its people after we fled.

   The last war in which we were the "good guys" was World War II -- although in Germany and Japan today there are rumblings of "revisionist views" in which it is said that Hitler did much good for Germany and that we were as murderous as the Japanese, what with the fire-bombings of Tokyo and the atom bomb.

   Either way, these two wars and the Korean conflict are much in our national consciousness.
All are recent enough to linger in the memories of millions -- both those who served in them and those who waited at home and sorrowed for those who were there.
Reruns of "The Longest Day," commemorating the landing in Normandy, and "Victory at Sea," that stirring account of our navy at war, still show up on late night television.

   But there was another war of our century that is hardly ever mentioned these days and which has almost disappeared from our national memory.

   That is the war of 1914-18, first known as the European war and then, after others including the U.S. were drawn into it, as the Great War or the World War.
Only much later did a roman numeral need to be attached to it to identify it in our minds and the history books.

   The near disappearance of World War I from our national consciousness is usually explained by the fact that it happened long ago.
It's been almost 70 years since Armistice Day marked its ending.
There are very few left who fought in it and not too many who even have memories of it.
And much else has happened since then.

   But, curiously, wars fought even longer ago are better remembered.
Recently on TV there was a series on George Washington and his role in our Revolutionary War.
Books on the Civil War of the last century (including coffee table picture books) fill shelves at local bookshops; "Gone With the Wind," both book and movie, has become popular folklore.
Indeed, the Civil War has become a booming industry and the arrangement of grounds at Manassas can still stir controversy.

   So I'm not so sure that the passage of time explains the fading of that first World War.
Even a youthful septuagenarian like myself remembers it.
When about four years old, I was taken by my mother to the railroad station where she and other ladies served coffee and doughnuts to laden troop-trains headed for embarkation to Europe.
I remember the windows with gold stars on them.
I remember the epic movie "The Big Parade" (with John Gilbert) playing at the local theater.
Even now I still know a few veterans who came back from those fields where poppies grew until we tore them up again in 1945.

   I think the fading of that war a pity.
For it was a pivotal event in the history of the world and, more particularly, in the history of our own country.

   It was the first war in which the whole of nations were involved and the first in which the distinction between soldiers and civilians vanished.
All who lived through it in Germany, France and Britain were in a true sense veterans, as were those who lived through World War II.
So will whole populations be if we ever have another.

   The First World War, too, marked an irreversible change in the role of the U.S. in the world.
We became involved in those "foreign entanglements" George Washington warned us against.
For the first time the new world, in Winston Churchill's phrase, had to come to the rescue of the old world.
And now, 70 years later, the U.S., whether we wish it or no, carries the burden of the whole world.

   After World War I we tried to leave the world to look after itself while we retired into splendid isolation.
Doing so, we helped bring on World War II. Hitler thought he could ignore us.
Tojo thought that if he flung down the gauntlet we would not have the strength to pick it up.
Even Admiral Yamamoto, architect of the attack on Pearl Harbor and one who comprehended our latent strength, thought to do his conquering quickly and doubted our will to pay the price of reconquering.

   Only Churchill, perhaps because he was half American, knew instinctively that, once in, the new world would not withdraw.
And ever since we have not been able to.

   Today, in our presidential campaign, neither candidate talks of isolation.
Neither doubts our inescapable entanglement in the whole world; they differ only in their views of how best to meet that challenge.
From Latin America to Africa to Asia to Europe again, we have no exit.
We are not involved in Nicaragua or the Persian Gulf because we want to be; we are there because there is no one else to take up the burden.
And neither of those who would be president knows where next the burden will fall.

   I am not arguing we should have stayed out of World War I.
Had we done so Europe would have bled itself into total exhaustion.
Even as it was, that war paved the way for Lenin and his Communists.
Without our role, all of Europe -- not just half of it -- probably would lie under the yoke of the Soviet Union.
So it would be even now, no doubt, if we laid down that burden.
At the very least much of the world would be in chaos, and that would hardly bring us peace.
No, all I am saying is that World War I was pivotal in the history of our century.

   Most historians agree that the 19th century didn't truly end until the Guns of August sounded in 1914, ushering in the 20th with its devastating wars and changing mores.
The Roaring '20s could never have occurred in that old, dead era.

   So while it is right that we should hold in memory World War II, Korea and Vietnam, and honor those who fought these wars, we should not let that "first" Great War fade from our national consciousness.

<TEXT>
   Regardless of which war it was or how many years
have passed, the grunts _ the infantrymen who've fought in a war _
don't readily talk about it with those who've never been in one.
   A common reason: only other grunts can possibly understand what
combat is like. It takes an uncommon interviewer to draw these men
out, yet avoid a succession of war stories that become routine
through repetition.
   But Bill Moyers somewhow accomplishes the former while largely
avoiding the latter in his ``From D-Day to the Rhine,'' an
old-soldier special, which the Public Broadcast Service is showing
Sunday.
   In it, Moyers, just a boy when World War II ended, takes a
memory-lane visit to the battlefields of France, Belgium and
Germany with a group of U.S. Army veterans who fought there in the
last two years of the war.
   Now gray-haired and in their 60s and 70s, most move slowly and
talk quietly, occasionally chuckling or grinning about the odd,
sometimes funny, little memories that any war produces.
   They recall the guy who spent a half-hour each day trimming his
mustache, the sound of gears cranking as a German tank's turret
turned to fire, and the Army pilot who showed up at the Normandy
beachhead not long after D-Day in June 1944. He stood out. He was
all dressed up, in his class-A uniform.
   It's a thoughtful, impressionistic show in which recollections
of war are illustrated with old newsreels of combat, or contrasted
with scenes of today, like French kids clambering over a Sherman
tank, now a museum piece.
   A rolling tour of the bloody past, the program always is headed
toward the Rhine, with occasional pauses for interviews in little
towns or gently rolling fields where men once killed each other and
where cows now peacefully graze.
   The veterans include a Medal of Honor winner from San Antonio,
Texas, Jose Lopez. Now 79, he won the nation's highest military
award when he was over 30, which is ancient for a combat
infantryman.
   But he'd lied back then and said he was two years younger. Why?
He wanted to be a paratrooper. Why? He shrugs. ``So we could meet
the enemy as soon as possible and get the thing over.''
   The vets inspect a museum and a graphic tapestry of a much
earlier war, the bloody battle of 1066 in which William the
Conquerer's troops went to war in Normandy.
   Moyers later asks one of the soldiers of World War II, a
battalion surgeon then, how the tapestry strikes him. The doctor
gently smiles.
   It makes him think, he says, about how endless war is, ``how
it's a part of everbody's life, war and death and men fighting
men.''
   There are the expected visits to U.S. military cemetaries _ but
also a stop at a neatly trimmed German military cemetery in France,
where the grave of one soldier who fought for Hitler is simply
marked ``Ein Deutscher Soldat.''
   At times, this 90-minute documentary, filmed and produced by
David Grubin, drags a bit. Several stories go on too long; they
could have been edited more tightly.
   It might have made a better show had Moyers brought in a few
German ex-grunts, heard their stories, gotten their perspective.
They visit the old battlefields, too.
   But ``From D-Day to the Rhine'' is a good effort, flaws and all.
And what strikes you most about it is how quietly humble and
plain-spoken most of its old soldiers are.
   Their manner, their lack of I-was-there bombast, may make a few
old-timers think of Ernie Pyle's musings on life after the war,
thoughts that the famed war correspondent wrote in France in August
1944.
   ``Submersion in war does not necessarily qualify a man to be the
master of the peace,'' he wrote. ``All we can do is fumble and try
once more _ try out of the memory of our anguish _ and be as
tolerant with each other as we can.''
   __
   Elsewhere in television ...
   ``TODAY'' STILL IS TRYING HARDER: NBC's once-dominant ``Today''
show last week was in second place again. For the ninth straight
week, it trailed ABC's ``Good Morning America'' in the ratings.
   GMA averaged a 4.5 rating. ``Today,'' which had NBC sportcaster
Dick Enberg subbing for the genial Bryant Gumbel from Tuesday
through Friday, got a 3.8, while ``CBS This Morning'' had a 2.8.
Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.

   The Korean War, sometimes called the forgotten
war, began June 25, 1950. More than 5 million American men and

no peace treaty has been signed.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a Sunday morning 40 years ago,
North Korea sent thousands of troops across the 38th parallel into
South Korea, starting a war that killed more than a million people,
including 54,000 American soldiers.
   It is the only war the United States has entered in this century
that remains unresolved. The Korean peninsula, divided after World
War II, still is split between the communist North and the
capitalist South.
   The invasion stunned and enraged the West. The North Koreans
occupied Seoul, the South Korean capital, in three days and overran
most of the southern half of the peninsula in six weeks.
   Fifteen nations sent soldiers to fight for South Korea under the
U.S.-led United Nations Command. Another 25 provided medical aid,
food and weapons.
   China, with war just across its border, sent hundreds of
thousands of soldiers to help the North.
   When a cease-fire took effect 37 months later, the losses were
staggering: an estimated 2.4 million soldiers and 4.4 million
civilians killed or wounded. Military dead totaled more than
800,000. A land of remarkable beauty lay ravaged, treeless, burned
Jand barren.
   The Korean War was a traumatic chapter in American history and
its impact on succeeding generations has been profound.
   It was an inglorious war without victory, often nearly
forgotten, patched into history between World War II and Vietnam.
No peace treaty has been signed.
   ``It was a war in which we turned the tide against communism for
the first time, in a victory regrettably sometimes ignored by
history,'' President Bush said at a dinner for veterans of the war.
   Korea was the first confrontation of the big powers in the
nuclear age. It intensified hostilities between East and West, and
and spurred a U.S.-Soviet arms race that only now is ending.
   From it grew the notion that communism in East Asia could be
contained with help from the U.S. military. That led to American
intervention in Vietnam a decade later.
   Forty years after the battle, North and South Korea watch one
another from behind barbed wire and concrete bunkers on either side
of a demilitarized zone 2{ miles wide and 155 miles long.
   The single telephone line between them is in Red Cross offices.
There is no mail, radio or television communication, no direct
travel without the permission of both governments, which is hardly
ever given.
   Nearly 9,000 American military personnel still are unaccounted
for or listed as prisoners.
   Last month, in a gesture seen as a political overture to
Washington, North Korea returned what it said were the remains of
five American soldiers. It was the first such action since 1954.
   The American Korean War Veterans Association says it has reports
from witnesses indicating some Americans still may be alive in
North Korea or other communist countries.
   Sporadic dialogue has occurred between the Koreas over the
years, but little progress has been made in lessening tension,
mutual suspicion and distrust. They have accused each other of more
than 1 million violations of the armistice agreement, an average of
75 a day since the war ended.
   Reunification of the peninsula, long a dream of Koreans on both
sides, remains elusive.
   The United States keeps 43,000 soldiers in South Korea to deter
another invasion. There are plans to reduce the number, but some
U.S. forces are expected to remain indefinitely.
   For Washington, the conflict of 1950-53 was a war in which the
politicians wrenched control from the generals. It is remembered as
much for President Harry Truman's firing of Douglas MacArthur as
for the general's bold strategy of pushing the enemy back with an
amphibious landing at Inchon, a western port.
   Historians divide the Korean war into the first year of
dramatic, far-reaching maneuvers and the next two years of static,
positional battle.
   Americans were not prepared mentally or physically for a war
fought in foxholes and trenches on rugged, mountainous terrain that
was freezing in winter and scorching in summer.
   No place was so cold, so dirty. Grease from a hundred C rations
was frozen to parkas and gloves. Underwear wasn't changed for
months. Perspiration in boots turned to ice in winter. Blood froze
on wounds before it could coagulate.
   Men fought hand-to-hand for small pieces of territory called
Punchbowl, Pork Chop Hill, Heartbreak Ridge, Bunker Hill. Each
changed hands many times.
   More than 5 million men and women served in the American forces.
Their casualties were 103,284 wounded and 54,246 dead, including
33,629 killed in combat. The infantry bore the brunt of the
fighting.
   What began as a crusade to save South Korea from communism
enjoyed only brief public popularity. Soldiers returned home not to
a hero's welcome, but to a public dissatisfied with an unpopular,
unsatisfactory war.
   Weary soldiers, disheartened and dispirited, faded into the
placid, properous American society of the 1950s, keeping their pain
to themselves.
   Not until Vietnam veterans received public attention did the
Korean vets begin to organize. They formed an association five
years ago and are trying to raise $10.5 million for a memorial.
Korea is the only war without a memorial in Washington.
   In South Korea, the war is called the 6-25 incident, reflecting
the date it began and the Korean preference for numbering rather
than naming events.
   Some South Koreans feel shame that the country needed help to
defend itself and the anniversary is not a cause for celebration.
   Many people who remember those days remain deeply grateful to
the Americans. Monuments have been built in rice paddies and town
squares to all nations that sent soldiers and aid.
   The relationship between South Korea and the United States has
changed dramatically in the past 40 years. South Korea's booming
economy and growing pride in its own accomplishments make it less
tolerant of pressure from Washington on economic, trade and
political issues.
   Anti-American sentiment continues to grow. Visiting
Korean-Americans say relatives and others scold them for wearing
American-style haircuts and clothes, and for speaking Korean with
American accents.
   Most Koreans disapprove of militants who burn U.S. flags and
shout ``Yankee go home,'' however, and polls indicate they want
American troops to remain.

<F P=106> [Interview with Serbian General Ratko Mladic by Valerio </F>
Pellizzari in Belgrade; date not given: "I, The War-And-Death
Lord"]
  [Text] Belgrade --Ratko Mladic is the true warlord in
Bosnia. His artillery has shelled Knin, Sarajevo, Tuzla, and all
the other towns with Muslim majorities -- without making any
distinction between civil and military targets. This general
has become Greater Serbia's protector, the symbol of ethnic
cleansing in Bosnia. The appointment was on Belgrade's hills,
far from the din of war.
  [Pellizzari] Why did you relentlessly shell Gorazde, a UN
safe area?
  [Mladic] We attacked after the Muslims had attacked us for
15
days. They were firing on our positions in an attempt to link
up with the other safe areas which are under their control --
not to defend themselves, but in order to spread the war in
Serbia and Montenegro.
  [Pellizzari] The snipers were targeting children too, and
the
shells were falling on hospitals.
  [Mladic] You should have asked Izetbegovic these same
questions two years ago, when they attacked our military
hospital. Or in 1991, when the Croats were beheading women and
children on the banks of the Korana river, or when they blew up
Serbian homes with people still inside them, and then sang
"Thank You, Germany" in German.
  [Pellizzari] Near Tuzla, late at night, you also fired on UN
Blue Helmets.
  [Mladic] The report you saw is completely false. The clash
took place in the night of 29 April. The Blue Helmets fired 72
shells, killing nine people and wounding others. They attacked
because they want to transform Tuzla into a NATO airfield. In
the past, they could move very freely in that area, and they did
not fulfill their commitment to station Russian officers there.
  [Pellizzari] Why do you always prefer Russian Blue Helmets?
Do they favor you?
  [Mladic] No, they are neutral. But a great country must
intervene in this war in which all foreign countries are
intervening.
  [Pellizzari] Tito, however, did not believe all that much in
Slav brotherhood and in Russia's disinterested involvement in
this area.
  [Mladic] This is a political question, and I do not wish to
answer political questions, ever. However, I will make an
exception. Without Tito and his drunken followers, this war
would have never taken place. In any case, it was not us who
started it.
  [Pellizzari] Any agreement or compromise reached with you
becomes fragile, uncertain. You were supposed to move away six
tanks, under UN supervision, but instead you did things your own
way.
  [Mladic] It is a small episode.
  [Pellizzari] Yes, but a significant one.
  [Mladic] This is my country, and my country is sovereign
within its borders. I am the one who decides where to locate
troops and military equipment. Just as you decide at Aviano or
Falconara [Italian air bases].
  [Pellizzari] Is there any difference between a war fought
between armies and a war fought against unarmed civilians?
  [Mladic] I have studied Hannibal, Alexander the Great, the
Crusades, and World War I and II. This is the most difficult
and the strangest war ever to have been fought on earth. It is
a different conflict because our enemies were citizens in our
own state. And it is a low-intensity war, as military experts
say -- one decided abroad, by Europeans, by the Americans, by
the Turks.
  [Pellizzari] You see things in a very black-and-white
fashion, with all the blame on one side.
  [Mladic] Listen, to quarrel there must always be two sides,
and to make peace you need two sides too. But the greatest
blame must go to those who attacked us. We are defending our
people and our land, and here we can see the international
community's double-dealing. Instead of being neutral, the
United Nations, too, has provided the Muslims with fuel and arms
which were sent together with the humanitarian aid.
  [Pellizzari] There is one village that you have always
refrained from attacking.
  [Mladic] Yes, Suni, where the Ustashas killed my father
during World War II. I never found my father's grave. The
majority of the population there are Muslims, but I never
attacked those people. I would have been accused of wanting to
take revenge for family reasons.
  [Pellizzari] Sum up your biography in a few sentences.
  [Mladic] I was born in Bosnia and I am like many other Serbs
who were born there. I attended all the various military
schools, and went through all the various ranks. But I have a
tragic fate. Toward the end of the 20th century, I must use
weapons to react against the extermination of my people.
  [Pellizzari] You have a very bad reputation in the Western
press. You are the symbol of ethnic cleansing.
  [Mladic] I am aware of it. I am a general and I am more
aware than others that war is a very dirty business. This word
ought not even exist in human speech. Weapons are a terrible
invention. I believe that even toy weapons ought to be
forbidden throughout the world, from north to south.
  [Pellizzari] If some day politicians decide that this war
must end, that the embargo must be lifted, and that Mladic must
step aside, what will you do then?
  [Mladic] Politicians start wars, and generals carry them out
-- it is like this everywhere. Again, it is politicians who
decide when the moment has come to put an end to war. But this
war's true warlords are to be found in the West. The Serbian
people are awaiting their decisions. The fewer aircraft take
off from UN bases, the easier will it become to achieve peace in
this region. The key to the war lies in NATO's command. NATO is
an alliance to defend its member countries, but no one here has
ever threatened any of its member countries.
  [Pellizzari] You place the Serbian nation above all other
considerations.
  [Mladic] There are two sacrosanct things in life: my country
and my women. The soil and women bear life. In fact, only a
few among them have any say in the battles waged between armies.
Mrs. Thatcher wants to do so. She is helping the Croats and
Muslims, this is why they are losing. After mothers, wives, and
daughters, it is soldiers who most loathe war.
  [Pellizzari] The conflict in Bosnia looks like a religious
conflict.
  [Mladic] Perhaps we Serbs are no better than others, but we
are not any worse either. Nor are we a tennis ball that can be
struck in all directions. Nor do we want to become like an
Amazonian tribe on its way to extinction, or like a rare species
confined to a reserve. Islam wants to penetrate into Europe,
and the West will see it grow like a mushroom. However, I have
always showed myself humane toward enemy soldiers. I may add
that I have prevented the conflict from spreading.
  [Pellizzari] How do you mean?
  [Mladic] When shells start flying, they can fly in all
directions, even very far from here. Toward the Pyrenees,
toward Siberia. Let me remind you of the attempt in Sarajevo,
in 1914.
  [Pellizzari] Why do you prevail in battle?
  [Mladic] I have a mind of my own, but I want no publicity.
Ultimately, publicity does not allow you to live. Contrary to
what is being said and written, I am not waging a war against
the Croatian or the Muslim people. I am waging a war against
their leaders, and against those instigating them from abroad.
I respect my enemies, but I do not hate them. This is why I
win.

   The Korean War, sometimes called the forgotten

no peace treaty has been signed.

<TEXT>
   On a Sunday morning 40 years ago,
North Korea sent thousands of troops across the 38th parallel into
South Korea, starting a war that killed more than a million people,
including 54,000 American soldiers.
   It is the only war the United States has entered in this century
that remains unresolved. The Korean peninsula, divided after World
War II, still is split between the communist North and the
capitalist South.
   The invasion stunned and enraged the West. The North Koreans
occupied Seoul, the South Korean capital, in three days and overran
most of the southern half of the peninsula in six weeks.
   Fifteen nations sent soldiers to fight for South Korea under the
U.S.-led United Nations Command. Twenty-five others provided
medical aid, food and weapons.
   China, with war just across its border, sent hundreds of
thousands of soldiers to help the North.
   When a cease-fire took effect 37 months later, the losses were
staggering: an estimated 2.4 million soldiers and 4.4 million
civilians killed or wounded. Military dead totaled more than
800,000. A land of remarkable beauty lay ravaged, treeless, burned
and barren.
   The Korean War was a traumatic chapter in American history and
its impact on succeeding generations has been profound.
   It was an inglorious war without victory, often nearly
forgotten, patched into history between World War II and Vietnam.
No peace treaty has been signed.
   ``It was a war in which we turned the tide against communism for
the first time, in a victory regrettably sometimes ignored by
history,'' President Bush said at a dinner for veterans of the war.
   Korea was the first confrontation of the big powers in the
nuclear age. It intensified hostilities between East and West, and
spurred a U.S.-Soviet arms race that only now is ending.
   From it grew the notion that communism in East Asia could be
contained with help from the U.S. military. That led to American
intervention in Vietnam a decade later.
   Forty years after the battle, North and South Korea watch one
another from behind barbed wire and concrete bunkers on either side
of a demilitarized zone 2{ miles wide and 155 miles long.
   The single telephone line between them is in Red Cross offices.
There is no mail, radio or television communication, no direct
travel without the permission of both governments, which is hardly
ever given.
   Nearly 9,000 American military personnel still are unaccounted
for or listed as prisoners.
   Last month, in a gesture seen as a political overture to
Washington, North Korea returned what it said were the remains of
five American soldiers. It was the first such action since 1954.
   The American Korean War Veterans Association says it has reports
from witnesses indicating some Americans still may be alive in
North Korea or other communist countries.
   Sporadic dialogue has occurred between the Koreas over the
years, but little progress has been made in lessening tension,
mutual suspicion and distrust. They have accused each other of more
than 1 million violations of the armistice agreement, an average of
75 a day since the war ended.
   Reunification of the peninsula, long a dream of Koreans on both
sides, remains elusive.
   The United States keeps 43,000 soldiers in South Korea to deter
another invasion. There are plans to reduce the number, but some
U.S. forces are expected to remain indefinitely.
   For Washington, the conflict of 1950-53 was a war in which the
politicians wrenched control from the generals. It is remembered as
much for President Harry Truman's firing of Douglas MacArthur as
for the general's bold strategy of pushing the enemy back with an
amphibious landing at Inchon, a western port.
   Historians divide the Korean war into the first year of
dramatic, far-reaching maneuvers and the next two years of static,
positional battle.
   Americans were not prepared mentally or physically for a war
fought in foxholes and trenches on rugged, mountainous terrain that
was freezing in winter and scorching in summer.
   No place was so cold, so dirty. Grease from a hundred C rations
was frozen to parkas and gloves. Underwear wasn't changed for
months. Perspiration in boots turned to ice in winter. Blood froze
on wounds before it could coagulate.
   Men fought hand-to-hand for small pieces of territory called
Punchbowl, Hamburger Hill, Heartbreak Ridge, Bunker Hill. Each
changed hands many times.
   More than 5 million men and women served in the American forces.
Their casualties were 103,284 wounded and 54,246 dead, including
33,629 killed in combat. The infantry bore the brunt of the
fighting.
   What began as a crusade to save South Korea from communism
enjoyed only brief public popularity. Soldiers returned home not to
a hero's welcome, but to a public dissatisfied with an unpopular,
unsatisfactory war.
   Weary soldiers, disheartened and dispirited, faded into the
placid, properous American society of the 1950s, keeping their pain
to themselves.
   Not until Vietnam veterans received public attention did the
Korean vets begin to organize. They formed an association five
years ago and are trying to raise $10.5 million for a memorial.
Korea is the only war without a memorial in Washington.
   In South Korea, the war is called the 6-25 incident, reflecting
the date it began and the Korean preference for numbering rather
than naming events.
   Some South Koreans feel shame that the country needed help to
defend itself and the anniversary is not a cause for celebration.
   Many people who remember those days remain deeply grateful to
the Americans. Monuments have been built in rice paddies and town
squares to all nations that sent soldiers and aid.
   The relationship between South Korea and the United States has
changed dramatically in the past 40 years. South Korea's booming
economy and growing pride in its own accomplishments make it less
tolerant of pressure from Washington on economic, trade and
political issues.
   Anti-American sentiment continues to grow. Visiting
Korean-Americans say relatives and others scold them for wearing
American-style haircuts and clothes, and for speaking Korean with
American accents.
   Most Koreans disapprove of militants who burn U.S. flags and
shout ``Yankee go home,'' however, and polls indicate they want
American troops to remain.

BACKGROUND
</P>
<P>
Korea, historically one land was divided into two countries after World War II
as part of the breakup of the Japanese empire. Japan had occupied Korea since
the early 20th Century. After the partition, the Soviet Union dominated the
northern section, the United States the southern section. The Soviet Union
refused to sanction elections in 1948 that would have unified Korea. Separate
governments evolved in each section that remain to this day.

   A British group said Friday it could not afford to
buy a secondhand Spitfire for a new World War II museum in France.
   More than 20,000 of the famous British fighters were built and
saw service from 1938-1954. The wartime cost of a Spitfire was
5,000 pounds _ then about $24,000.
   ``There aren't many Spitfires left and when the French asked us
to try to get one, we were told the cost would be 300,000 pounds
($522,000) or more. We couldn't face up to that,'' said Lt. Gen.
Sir Ian Harris.
   Haris' British support committee for the Memorial Museum of the
Battle of Normandy at Caen is now trying to raise the equivalent of
$87,000 to buy a secondhand Typhoon fighter-bomber.
   ``It's not a bad substitute,'' Harris said.
   Harris, 77, was the first British regimental commander to enter
Caen on July 9, 1944. He spoke at a news conference to announce his
committee's appeal for a total of $261,000 for the museum.
   The money will pay for British war relics ranging from a
Churchill tank to a miniature radio transmitter used by
intelligence agents landed before the invasion of France on June 6,
1944.
   ``It's somewhat disconcerting that while it was British troops
who first entered Caen, other countries whose forces were never in
the city are giving the museum substantially more importance and
support than we are,'' Harris said.
   He said that in the United States, for example, 300,000 members
of a Normandy Society plan to support the museum project.
   Troops from Germany and 11 allied countries fought in the 78-day
battle around Caen, and nearly 300,000 soldiers were killed.
   Caen, 115 miles west of Paris, suffered 10,000 civilian deaths.
   Caen Mayor Jean-Marie Girault flew to London for the news
conference at the Imperial War Museum.
   He said France is spending nearly $21 million on the museum that
will be opened on the June 6 anniversary.
   The nations involved in the battle have been invited to send
representatives for the opening, the mayor said.
   He said those countries were France, East and West Germany,
Belgium, Britain, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway, Poland and the United States.

<TEXT>
   Just in time to serve as an antidote to the
wave of sentimental reminiscence arising from the 50th anniversary
of World War II, scholar Paul Fussell has written an angry book with
this startling proposition:
   The whole truth about the war is still not known and never fully
will be known because it is too horrible to tell.
   ``For the past 50 years the Allied war has been sanitized and
romanticized almost beyond recognition by the sentimental, the loony
patriotic, the ignorant and the bloodthirsty,'' writes Fussell. ``I
have tried to balance the scales.''
   The result is ``Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second
World War,'' an iconoclastic, opinionated and bitter rebuttal of the
heroic version that's making the newspapers these days.
   His book does not address the war's morality, necessity or
inevitability.
   Instead, his purpose is to dig out the untold fragments _ untold
because they were suppressed by propagandists and censors at the
time, romanticized by the survivors or still too discomforting to
tell _ that make his point.
   Some of Fussell's truths:
   _Wars are fought by boys, innocent of life's experiences.
   ``Boys who had never shaved machine-gunned other boys creeping up
with Panzerfausts in their adolescent hands,'' is Fussell's
description of what World War II combat sometimes came down to.
``Among the horribly wounded the most common cry was `Mother!'''
   At the start, men had to be 21 to be drafted but that soon
dropped to 18. By late 1944, these boys were facing, across the
front, the Hitler Jugend, consisted of boys age 16 or 17, sometimes
as young as 12.
   _Death comes not as cleanly as the mind imagines. Soldiers are
just as likely to have their belly blown open as to be shot neat,
clean and noble, where the movies always have soldiers shot, in the
shoulder or the chest.
   ``You would expect front-line soldiers to be struck and hurt by
bullets and shell fragments, but such is the popular insulation from
the facts that you would not expect them to be hurt, sometimes
killed, by being struck by parts of their friends' bodies violently
detached,'' writes Fussell.
   ``In the face of such horror, the distinction between friend and
enemy vanishes, and the violent dismemberment of any human being
becomes equally traumatic.''
   _Home-front propaganda to the contrary, allied troops were not
the best armed in the history of warfare.
   ``They knew that their automatic rifles (World War I vintage)
were slower and clumsier, and they knew that the Germans had a much
better light machine gun. ... They knew that their own tanks, both
American and British, were ridiculously under-armed and
under-armored, so that they were inevitably destroyed in an open
encounter with an equal number of German Panzers. ... And they knew
that the greatest single weapon of the war, the atomic bomb
excluded, was the German 88-mm flat-trajectory gun, which brought
down thousands of bombers and tens of thousands of soldiers.''
   _Far more often than is known, soldiers are killed by blunders on
their own side, hushed up to preserve homefront morale.
   Fussell devotes a chapter to such disasters, telling, for
example, how nervous Navy gunners shot down 23 planes carrying
paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division during the invasion of
Sicily.
   A Canadian soldier tells of an American who confused him for the
enemy at Normandy and wouldn't stop firing. ``It's him or me. So I
shoot that boy even though I know he's a Yank. ... Poor bugger. A
corporal from some Texas outfit.''
   After the Normandy landing, the Americans ordered up a round of
bombing to soften Nazi fortifications inland. Accidentally, American
planes dropped their bombs on American lines, killing 25. The next
day the American line was secretly pulled back to avoid a disastrous
repeat. This time the planes killed 110 GIs and a general.
   Fussell quotes an eyewitness:
   ``Some enraged American units opened fire on their own aircraft,
a not-uncommon practice among all the armies in Normandy when
suffering at the hands of their own pilots.''
   So much for ``precision bombing'' or its latter-day equivalent in
Vietnam or Libya, the ``surgical air strike.''
   Fussell's book is going to displease some who would prefer to
remember the courage and forget the carnage.
   His own biography denies such critics ammunition. The author is
professor of English literature at the University of Pennsylvania
but, more pertinently, was a young army lieutenant in the 103rd
Infantry Division in France in World War II. He was severely wounded
in combat.
   The war that author Studs Terkel calls ``The Good War'' is his
war, too. But his word for it is ``stupid.''
   The ``terrible fact,'' he says, is that ``military successes are
achieved only at the cost of insensate violence and fear and agony,
with no bargains allowed.''

<LEADPARA>  Bob Montano, knowing he was bound for Vietnam after high school, enlisted,
hoping the Army would put him anywhere but the 1st Infantry Division. He had
heard how its soldiers were the first American troops in Europe in World War I
and spearheaded the assault at Normandy in World War II.;    When he learned
in 1966 that he was being assigned to the 1st, "I just kind of puckered up,"
Montano said. Today, he's proud to be part of the first U.S. combat division
sent to Vietnam -- and to be among the four generations of the "Big Red One"
holding their national reunion at the Fairmont Hotel on Saturday.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The division's legacy was carried on in the Persian Gulf war as its tanks
and soldiers drove into Iraq to block any retreat. The desert battles became
part of the war stories swapped during the reunion, which began Wednesday.;
"We've brought in another herd from Desert Storm," said World War II veteran
Vaughn Manning, 76, of San Antonio, Texas, adding that the newest generation
admirably carried out the division's motto: "No mission too difficult. No
sacrifice too great. Duty first!";    "Every man in the division knows what
that means real well," Manning said. "All these folks live by it.";    Staff
Sgt. Jim Wesser, 28, of Winthrop Harbor, Ill., who spent 4 1/2 months in the
desert as a tank commander, said he'd "never known that there was as much unit
pride in this division until today.";    World War II veteran Jean G. Peltier,
73, of Columbus, Ohio, explained where that pride comes from: "We developed an
attitude that nobody could beat us. . . . We thought we had the best cooks,
the best machine gunners.";    For the handful of Vietnam veterans, whose
battles were just as fierce but whose victories were fewer, the reunion was a
chance to see old buddies and mingle with other veterans of the fabled
division.;    Joe West, a Vietnam veteran from Merced, noticed the World War
II veterans appeared to be a tighter bunch.;    "Guys (I served with) were
rotating all the time," West said. "You didn't have that esprit de corps.";
West and Montano have mixed emotions about the welcome home for Desert Storm
troops, compared with the reception for the Vietnam veterans. They're glad the
war ended quickly and with light casualties. But, West said, "They did four
days, and they're getting discounts on cars.";    Montano, touching his chin
with the back of his hand, said, "I'm up to here with these damn (yellow)
ribbons.";    He remembers being flown back to Travis Air Force Base at 3 a.m.
so nobody would know they had come back.;    Wesser, who wore his sandy Desert
Storm fatigues, said he almost feels guilty for getting such a tremendous
reception. "They got screwed out of their homecoming," he said.;    Manning,
who fought in the Battle of the Bulge, sees the division's next big battle as
one for the Wests and Montanos -- the battle for survival of the Society of
the First Division.;    "Ninety percent of us are World War II, and we're
reaching that age," Manning said. He estimates that in the next 10 years, the
society's ranks could shrink 80 percent unless the Vietnam veterans keep the
ball rolling.;    "The boys don't feel like exposing themselves, and this is
tragic," he said.;    West, Montano and the other Vietnam veterans at the
reunion are the exception.;    West said he enjoyed hearing the stories of
others who've worn the big red "1" patch on their shoulder, and discovered
they have more than that in common: "We've all had the pucker factor."  </TEXT>

days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On June 5, 1968, at 3:16 a.m. EDT, Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was
shot and mortally wounded at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles
shortly after claiming victory in California's Democratic
presidential primary. Five other people were wounded. Kennedy's
assassin, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, was immediately arrested.
   On this date:
   In 1723, economist Adam Smith was born in Kirkcaldy, Scotland.
   In 1783, Joseph and Jacques Montgolfier publicly demonstrated
their hot-air balloon in a ten-minute flight over Annonay, France.
   In 1883, economist John Maynard Keynes was born in Cambridge,
England.
   In 1884, Civil War hero General William T. Sherman refused the
Republican presidential nomination with the words, ``I will not
accept if nominated and will not serve if elected.''
   In 1888, the Democratic National Convention in St. Louis
nominated President Grover Cleveland for a second term in office.
He lost to Benjamin Harrison that November, but was elected
president again in 1892.
   In 1917, about 10 million American men began registering for the
draft in World War I.
   In 1933, the United States went off the gold standard.
   In 1940, the Battle of France began during World War II.
   In 1947, Secretary of State George C. Marshall gave a speech at
Harvard University outlining a program of aid for Europe that would
become known as the Marshall Plan.
   In 1967, tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbors erupted
into the Six-Day War. The fighting ended June tenth with a United
Nations-negotiated cease-fire.
   In 1975, Egypt reopened the Suez Canal to international
shipping, exactly eight years after it was closed because of the
Six-Day War with Israel.
   In 1976, 11 people were killed when the Teton Dam in Idaho
burst, sending 80 billion gallons of water churning down the Upper
Snake River Valley.
   Ten years ago: The Supreme Court decided that states could give
veterans an advantage in public service employment, ruling that the
practice did not discriminate against women.
   Five years ago: Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale
won the New Jersey and West Virginia primaries, while Gary Hart
took California, New Mexico and South Dakota. The next day, Mondale
claimed victory in the race for the Democratic nomination.
   One year ago: In Tel Aviv, Secretary of State George Shultz

   James M. Gavin, a World War II general
who helped lead the D-Day invasion and was later an outspoken
critic of U.S. military policy, was buried Wednesday with full
military honors.
   An honor guard from Gavin's famed 82nd Airborne Division fired a
three-volley salute at the funeral at the U.S. Military Academy
attended by about 200 people. Gavin was buried at the Army post's
cemetery alongside such legendary military figures as George
Armstrong Custer.
   Gavin, who died Friday in Baltimore at age 82, was one of the
last great generals from World War II.
   Old comrades in arms recalled Gavin's courage in battle and his
eagerness to embrace innovations in battlefield tactics and weapons.
   ``His physical courage was unchallenged,'' said retired Gen.
William T. Ryder. ``His intellectual bent for battle was proven.
The thing that endeared him to me the most was his integrity.
   ``Jim was one of those perceptive people, and they come few and
far between, who knew the next war would not be fought with the
last war's tools,'' Ryder said.
   Ryder parachuted into Sicily during World War II with Gavin. He
said that when the paratroops were first organized, Gavin
immediately wanted to get involved.
   ``As soon as he heard about airborne, he wanted to get out with
the paratroops,'' Ryder said. ``He was always an avant-garde
innovator.''
   Frederick Spataro of New Brunswick, N.J., a paratrooper who
fought with Gavin in Normandy, Holland and the Battle of the Bulge,
said the general was ``always the first one out of the plane.''
   Another foot soldier under Gavin, H. Joseph Hirlemann of West
Orange, N.J., said he remembered fighting at a remote outpost and
calling for more ammunition. Gavin delivered it personally.
   Gavin worked his way to the upper echelon of Army command during
a 34-year career that began in 1925 when he enlisted as a private
at age 17. He had dropped out of school after the eighth grade, but
completed his high school education as an Army private, gained
admission to West Point and was commissioned a second lieutenant in
1929.
   By the time he resigned at 51 in a dispute over the Army's role
in missile development, he was the youngest three-star general.
   A captain when World War II began, Gavin was promoted to
brigadier general by D-Day and later was given command of the 82nd
Airborne Division. At the end of the war he was a highly decorated
major general.
   After World War II, Gavin was instrumental in developing the
Army's use of the helicopter, which was used extensively in Vietnam.
   An outspoken critic of President Eisenhower, his former
commander, Gavin resigned in 1958 out of principle over his
disagreement with Pentagon policies. At the time, he was about to
take command of the Seventh Army in Europe.
   Gavin became an executive with the industrial and consulting
form of Arthur D. Little Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.
   He was appointed ambassador to France by President Kennedy.
   As a civilian, Gavin continued to criticize the American
military, and was was one of the first to criticize U.S.
involvement in Vietnam.
   Gavin's wartime medals include the Purple Heart, Silver Star,
and the Distinguished Service Cross with oak leaf cluster. France
gave him its Croix de Guerre with palm and Britain named him to the
Distinguished Service Order.

WAR: LIKE OTHER WWII VETERANS, THOSE WHO LANDED ON GUADALCANAL 48 YEARS AGO SEE

<P>
The setting at Jeremiah Collins' little Costa Mesa outpost couldn't have been
more military gung-ho, more rousingly patriotic, more evocative of a
battle-forged camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
The five World War II Marine Corps veterans were meeting in Collins' garage,
converted into a retired Leatherneck den overflowing with all sorts of banners,
posters and other wartime memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
Overhead, fluttering in the breeze and visible to the whole street, was Old
Glory itself, raised dutifully by Collins daily for the last 28 years.
</P>
<P>
And the men themselves were there to remember once again that day -- exactly 48
years today -- when they landed on a Godforsaken, Japanese-held Pacific island
named Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
Guadalcanal?
</P>
<P>
It may be forgotten by most in today's younger generations, but history books
tell us that the U.S. victory at Guadalcanal was a World War II turning of the
tide, coming eight months after the debacle at Pearl Harbor and two months
after the epic defeat of the Japanese fleet off Midway.
</P>
<P>
But that was too many yesterdays ago.
</P>
<P>
"Our grandchildren barely know about World War II, let alone a Guadalcanal. I
don't think they're even being taught about it in the schools," said Norton
Henninger, 68, of Villa Park, who was 20 when he landed at Guadalcanal with
thousands of other Marines on Aug. 7, 1942.
</P>
<P>
But Henninger and the other Orange County veterans -- including Ed LeBlanc, 67,
and Frank Aiello, 72, both of Costa Mesa, and Norris Cole, 66, of San Juan
Capistrano -- have learned to live with this type of obscurity.
</P>
<P>
After all, since 1942 two other wars have come and gone -- one of them, Korea,
now just as obscure, the other, Vietnam, still shrouded by divisive debate.
</P>
<P>
So, they said, why get worked up when people ignore a war fought more than four
decades ago?
</P>
<P>
"No big deal. Hell, Guadalcanal was a long time ago, and people have short
memories," said Collins, 67, who was a 22-year career Marine who also served in
China in 1946 and in Korea in 1950, where he earned a Silver Star.
</P>
<P>
Then, before anyone gets the idea that these Marines are getting too soft -- or
too mellowed with age -- Collins, in a barracks-booming voice, added: "But we
remember! You can count on that!"
</P>
<P>
Like other World War II veterans, Collins, Cole, LeBlanc, Henninger and Aiello
see it as their duty to keep alive the achievements -- and significance -- of
their war, despite growing obscurity and the shadows of time.
</P>
<P>
Although they belong to the 3,000-strong Guadalcanal Campaign Veterans Assn. --
which includes Army, Navy and Coast Guard members -- they seldom make the
association's national or regional reunions.
</P>
<P>
Most of the time, they gather to shoot the breeze in impromptu mini-reunions at
local Veterans of Foreign Wars halls or at their homes, like the visit last
week to Collins' garage museum.
</P>
<P>
"Look," Cole said, "most of us aren't sitting around swapping old war stories.
We talk about our families, about trips.
</P>
<P>
"When it's about war, it's about the good times, or what now seem like the
funny incidents to us," said Cole, who retired in 1961 as a gunnery sergeant
after 20 years in the Marines.
</P>
<P>
"We don't get into the sadder stuff, the grisly memories, unless someone asks
us," added LeBlanc, a businessman ever since his World War II service. "It's
not something you bring up on your own."
</P>
<P>
Although all five men were with the 1st Marine Division at Guadalcanal, they
didn't know each other during the war. That does not matter. Their lives are
marked by an historic common denominator, an unspoken comradeship. They have
Guadalcanal to remember.
</P>
<P>
"It's with you all your lives, a wound mentally if not always physically," said
LeBlanc, who, like the four other men, escaped serious injuries in the
Guadalcanal and later Pacific campaigns. "You can't forget -- even if,
sometimes, you wished you could."
</P>
<P>
On the morning of Aug. 7, 1942, flanked by a Navy armada, a 19,000-member
Marine force landed -- the first units on four small nearby island strongholds,
the main force on the 90-mile-long Guadalcanal itself, where the Japanese were
completing a key airfield.
</P>
<P>
To the U.S. high command in Washington and the Pacific, the taking of the
Guadalcanal sector was absolutely essential in halting Japan's seemingly
invincible push toward Allied-held Pacific bases and Australia itself.
</P>
<P>
But that was the big picture.
</P>
<P>
To the U.S. troops at ground zero, in the oppressively hot Guadalcanal sector,
where thousands of Japanese soldiers were holed up in the jungle and ridges,
the immediate concern was starkly more simple.
</P>
<P>
"It was no tropical paradise, believe me," said Collins, who was with an
engineer battalion. "It was a hellhole, a stinking, jungle-rotting island."
</P>
<P>
"We were scared the day we landed until the day we left," recalled Cole, member
of an intelligence patrol unit. "We didn't have enough to eat -- except tons of
Japanese rice, crawling with vermin. We were short on vital equipment. We were
left on our own for months."
</P>
<P>
What happened was that the U.S. armada -- with much of the troops' supplies
still unloaded -- had left after the first landings in the face of a powerful
Japanese counterattack by sea. Also, as the Marines moved inland, they met
fierce resistance from the Japanese, who were pouring in large numbers of
reinforcements.
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc, a member of a rifle company, said: "We were pinned down by snipers or
subjected to those wild, incredible banzai attacks. They kept charging, even
though we kept cutting them down."
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc remembers this especially horrendous sight: "We were moving forward
behind our tanks. The tanks had to go over an area littered with Japanese
bodies by the hundreds. The tanks chewed them up, like a meat grinder."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the day-and-night bombardment from Japanese ships, artillery and
planes seemed ceaseless.
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't sleep," said Henninger, who was a gun-placement crew member
protecting the airstrip. "You felt helpless. All you could do was crawl into
your dugout or foxhole and just pray."
</P>
<P>
When the fighting ended in early 1943, more than 2,100 U.S. troops, including
members of Army units, had been killed, according to the Guadalcanal veterans
group. Another 4,000 Navy personnel were killed in the sea fighting. The number
of Japanese troops killed was estimated at 23,000.
</P>
<P>
But this was only the beginning for the members of the 1st Marine Division.
They went on to other bloody Pacific island campaigns: Cape Gloucester on New
Britain in 1943, then Peleliu, an island east of the Philippines, in 1944.
</P>
<P>
When the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, and the
surrender ceremonies were held Sept. 2 in Tokyo Bay, the five of them --
Aiello, Cole, Collins, Henninger and LeBlanc -- were back in the United States
with units being readied for the expected invasion of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Except for Henninger, who remembers a big parade and a key-to-the-city ceremony
in 1944 in Chicago, there were no big homecomings. However, like all the other
military from the World War II campaigns, they were treated as heroes.
</P>
<P>
"America had been in mortal danger," Henninger said. "Everyone believed in the
struggle, in what we were fighting for.
</P>
<P>
"America was unified behind us . . . at least, back then."
</P>
<P>
 To their dismay and disgust, America as a society seemed to fall into disarray
in the "shooting wars" that followed: Korea and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"They wouldn't let us win it," said Collins, who fought in late 1950 with the
1st Marine Division at the Chosin Reservoir in North Korea, near the China
border. "They (civilian authorities) stopped us at the Yalu (River). They
didn't want us to get into China."
</P>
<P>
It was far worse when it came to Vietnam in 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
"We should have stayed out of Vietnam," Cole said, "if we didn't have the
stomach to go all the way and win. Instead, in that war it was political bull
all the way."
</P>
<P>
The way returning Vietnam veterans were treated was "shabby and a disgrace,"
LeBlanc said. "People spat on them, tossed tomatoes at them. You had people
running around the campuses, stirring up all those protests. Patriotism in this
country really went down the drain in the '60s."
</P>
<P>
 However, LeBlanc and the others believe that much of the protests and the
"anti-military" attitude had subsided by the late 1980s. Vietnam veterans are
now, very belatedly, getting hero treatment.
</P>
<P>
"Patriotism is now back in style," said Henninger, another career sergeant, who
also served in Korea with the 1st Marine Division. "Well, OK, except for the
flag burners. I don't even mind the flag burners . . . as long as it's wrapped
around them when they burn it!"
</P>
<P>
Some World War II veterans still feel an unrelenting enmity toward the
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Henninger said: "We have every right to be so bitter. I was for a long time. We
saw a lot of buddies killed -- my own brother was lost at Peleliu.
</P>
<P>
"But you can't go on hating forever. After all these years, you have to live
and let live."
</P>
<P>
To Collins and the others, the image of their role in World War II has not
changed in the 48 years since Guadalcanal.

   Joe Drodwill stood in cemetery
overlooking the sea on Tuesday, remembering the fellow soldiers who
fought and died there to free France from Nazi tyranny.
   ``It's like I'm reliving the war all over again, there are so
many memories,'' said the war veteran from Middletown, Conn., who
had not been back to the Normandy coast since the end of World War
II.
   About 1,000 people gathered by the reflecting pool at the
American military cemetery at Omaha Beach on Tuesday, the 45th
anniversary of the invasion. Among them was a large group of
gray-haired veterans from the United States.
   The ceremony at the cemetery was one of several over three days
by British, Canadian, French and U.S. groups to mark Tuesday's
anniversary. At Bayeux, Queen Mother Elizabeth of Britain dedicated
a stained-glass window in the cathedral in honor of the fallen
soldiers.
   Canadian Veterans Affairs Minister Gerald S. Merrithew joined in
commemorations at the Canadian cemetery at Beny sur Mer.
   Drodwill was in a group of 225 U.S. Army Rangers who just after
dawn on June 6, 1944, scaled the 9-story high cliff at Point du Hoc
on Omaha Beach using grappling hooks and ladders to reach the big
German guns above.
   Nazi soldiers fired straight down on them, cutting the ropes to
send many Rangers plummeting to their deaths.
   ``I couldn't sleep last night, I kept thinking of the beach,''
said Drodwill, who lost four men under his command during the
assault.
   Surrounded by a group of veteran Rangers, Drodwill cried softly
as a single bugle played taps, the melancholy notes lofting over
the manicured green lawn lined with 9,368 white marble crosses.
   The sun emerged and warmed the crowd, damp from standing in
heavy morning showers. A military band played the Star Spangled
Banner and the Marseillaise.
   Four F-16s flew low over the sparkling English Channel and the
cemetery that overlooks a long, curving beach where American troops
stormed ashore to drive back German forces in what was the
beginning of the end of Adolf Hitler's tyranny.
   The Germans, in trenches and concrete bunkers perched on the
bluff 150 feet above the beach, shot at the wide-open Yanks as they
struggled onto the beach, stumbling knee-deep, hip-deep, neck-deep
through the surf, some of them shot to death before ever touching
shore.
   ``I lost one in the water,'' said Drodwill, 68. ``He went down
under the weight of his gear and never came up.''
   The dead and wounded were sprawled everywhere, their blood
soaking into the sand.
   ``Some of my men fell, but there were so many others, all around
me, all Americans, all young. That's the picture in my head I can't
get rid of,'' Drodwill said.
   Up and down a 50-mile stretch of Normandy coast, 180,000 U.S.,
British and Canadian soldiers battled on Utah, Gold, Juno and Sword
Beaches in operation Overlord, the largest amphibious operation in
history.
   With reinforcements, the assault force numbered 3 million men.
   Compared to the relatively light American casualties at Utah,
Omaha was the roughest of the fighting. It took all day for the 1st
and 29th Infantry Divisions to cross 250 yards of sand and rock and
climb onto the bluff where the 172-acre military cemetery now
stands as a memorial to those who fought and died.
   ``I don't usually cry,'' Drodwill said. ``Maybe this trip will
help soften the memory.''

REMEMBERING ARMISTICE DAY
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month the big guns
fell silent. It was the armistice of World War I in 1918. Who in my generation
did not know the story? Who in this generation has heard it?
</P>
<P>
It was the great world war -- the first time America had joined Europe's wars
overseas. We were saving the world for democracy. We were fighting the Kaiser
and the Krauts. Our lads were dying in "no man's land" -- the battle line of
trenches where huge cannons lined up opposite each other between Germany and
France. That was the way wars were fought then. Our tanks were there. Our newly
invented airplanes were dogfighting overhead. In a fervor of patriotism war
bonds were sold, shortages and rationing were endured, women went to work so
their men could go. How long? How long could it be?
</P>
<P>
Then the news came. There was no television, no radio. Telegraph and telephone
and extras quickly spread the news. A truce had been declared and the big guns
that never quit firing night and day ceased sounding. On the eleventh hour of
the eleventh day of the eleventh month there was silence all along the front.
</P>
<P>
Jubilant celebrations broke out all over America. Bells. People danced in the
streets of all the small towns as well as in Times Square. Parades were quickly
formed and the Kaiser was burned in effigy. The celebration when peace came
after World War II could not match the pure joy of that first cease-fire. There
was no doubt. Our boys were coming home. The world had been saved. A holiday
was set to remember this momentous day.
</P>
<P>
How did the holiday get changed to Veterans Day? We already had Memorial Day.
Did people forget? Did the Second World War wipe out the memory of the first?
Or was it that people didn't want to remember the truce -- a time to pause in
the fighting to make peace.
</P>
<P>
Let's remember. Let's not let Nov. 11th be a confused, semi-holiday, a sort of
imitation Memorial Day. Let's sing the old songs -- "There's a Long, Long Trail
A-Winding," "Smile the While, I Kiss You Sad Adieu," "It's a Long Way to
Tipperary," "How Can You Keep Them Down on the Farm After They've Seen Paree."
Let's tell our children how it was. Let's celebrate armistice.

<TEXT>
   Scores of people wounded in nine days of
war between Lebanon's main Christian armies are dying in hospitals
that have no power and little blood, medicine or clean water,
police said Wednesday.
   They said 365 people had been killed and 1,682 wounded since the
battle for supremacy began Jan. 30 between nearly 20,000 soldiers
commanded by rebel Gen. Michel Aoun and the Lebanese Forces militia
of Samir Geagea, which has about 6,000 regulars and an estimated
30,000 reservists.
   Many of the victims have been civilians, some of them Moslems
killed or wounded by shells that strayed out of Christian territory.
   On Wednesday, families in Christian east Beirut searched for
relatives in hospitals where surgeons operated by candlelight.
   Police said food was so short that some people fought over bread
in Christian neighborhoods, where hundreds of thousands of people
have spent a week or more in basements or bomb shelters.
   French Cabinet minister Bernard Kouchner and Rene Ala, the
French ambassador, arranged a 90-minute truce on a single street so
seven ambulances could take seriously wounded people from a
hospital in the Ashrafiyeh district.
   Snipers from both sides fired overhead as the convoy dashed to
evacuate the wounded, who included an 8-month-old baby with a head
wound. They were driven to Beirut airport in the Moslem sector,
where a French jet took them to Paris for treatment, along with
other wounded civilians.
   The French foreign ministry said the plane carried 16 victims
who were transferred to eight hospitals in Paris after their
arrival.
   Meanwhile, mediators representing Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah
Sfeir, the highest ranking Christian prelate in the Christian
enclave, convened a cease-fire committee with representatives from
the two warring factions.
   Christian-controlled radio stations said the meeting lasted six
hours. There was no immediate announcement.
   A police spokesman said Aoun, who has been dismissed as army
commander but refuses to step aside, appeared to be reorganizing
his forces for a major drive against Geagea's besieged strongholds
in the 310-square-mile Christian area north and east of Beirut.
   If Aoun is successful, his control of Christian territory might
be difficult to break even for the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in
Lebanon, with whom Aoun fought a six-month artillery war that ended
in September.
   At a news conference, Aoun blamed the fighting on Geagea and
claimed the United States was using the militia chieftain to force
implementation of a peace plan designed to end Lebanon's
15-year-old civil war.
   Aoun rejects the peace plan because it does not include a
timetable for the withdrawal of the Syrian troops, and he refuses
to recognize President Elias Hrawi, who was elected as part of the
plan.
   Hrawi, Aoun and Geagea are Maronite Cathlics, the Christian sect
that has dominated the government, army and judiciary since
independence from France in 1943. Geagea recognizes Hrawi as
president but has not taken a public position on the peace plan
negotiated last fall at Taif, Saudi Arabia.
   ``The Trojan Horse never said in public he was in favor of the
Taif accord, although he staged his war against the army with
American blessing to enforce implementation of the humiliating
agreement,'' Aoun told the news conference, broadcast by his
station, Radio Lebanon.
   Artillery generally was silent Wednesday, allowing civilians to
emerge from shelters and search for food and missing relatives,
said the police spokesman, whose name cannot be used under standing
regulations.
   ``We received several calls from hospitals asking us to send
patrols to deal with thousands of nervous and worried people
inquiring about missing relatives,'' he said.
   ``Many of them had pictures of their missing ones. Others wanted
to have a look at the bodies or the unconscious wounded. The
hospitals didn't have staff to deal with such cases.''
   He said surgeons operated by candlelight, using water boiled on
kerosene stoves.
   Crowds filled the few open bakeries, and some people who didn't
want to wait ``tried to steal a few loaves,'' he said. ``Fistfights
developed.''
   On Tuesday, Aoun achieved his most significant victory by
ousting the Lebanese Forces from their seven barracks in the hills
of Dbaye on Beirut's northern flank.
   That put him in postiion to attack the remaining militia
strongholds in east Beirut and in Kesrouan, Byblos and Batroun
provinces north of the capital.
   Geagea's men are experienced street fighters, however, and Aoun
cannot claim undisputed mastery of the Christian enclave until he
drives them from east Beirut and Jounieh, a port town north of the
city.
   Two-thirds of the 1 million Christians live in east Beirut,
where the militia is entrenched in the Karantina, Ashrafiyeh and
Ein Rummaneh districts, and in Jounieh, where Geagea has total
control.
   Hrawi has hinted at requesting help from the Syrians, who
support him, but their intervention would need advance
international approval. On Tuesday, Hrawi appealed to Western
nations, the Soviet Union, the United Nations and the Arab world
for help in ending the fighting.
   The Syrian soldiers were deployed in Lebanon in 1976 to quell
civil war fighting. Aoun says they violated their peacekeeping
mandate by siding with the Moslems in the civil war.

   DAMASCUS, Syria -- Black-and-white images pop like gunfire
on the television screen: Soldiers charge a hillside, tanks
roll across a desert plain, MiG jets fly, howitzers sound,
paratroopers drop from the sky.
   The action fades and a smiling fellow in a black tuxedo
and a dark mop of blowdried hair -- a Syrian Tony Orlando --
appears as narrator. In the gentle voice of a lullaby, he
begins telling of the glorious October War of Liberation.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "Arab soldiers made history" in that 1973 conflict with
Israel, he explains. "They won because they were defending a
just cause."
   They won?
   Throughout the Arab world, but particularly here in Syria,
it is time once again to honor the Arab armies which, in the
words of Syrian President Hafez Assad, "liberated the will of
the nation from all fetters." It is October, or "Tishrin,"
the 18th anniversary of the last major Arab-Israeli war and
an annual rite of revisionism in which history is firmly in
the eye of the beholder.
   This year's Tishrin celebration reprises many of the same
TV specials, art exhibits, plays, films, concerts, rallies
and wreath-laying ceremonies of Octobers past. As usual, no
mention is made of how the 1973 war ended -- with 6,000
Syrians dead, Israeli troops on the outskirts of Damascus,
and the Soviet Union threatening military intervention to
save the Syrian capital.
   Rather, Tishrin is one war memorial that celebrates the
start of hostilities -- the surprise attack by Syrian and
Egyptian forces that caught Israelis hungry and off guard
over the Jewish fast of Yom Kippur. And before they were
turned back, the Arab armies inflicted heavy casualties on
Israel and reclaimed some land they had lost six years
earlier in the Six Day War. The 1973 achievement, fleeting as
it was, still buoys Arab pride.
   So glorious were those first few days -- Oct. 6 to 10 --
that the state-run Syria Times recently remembered them as
"the miracle that ushered in a new era to the Middle East . .
. A passage to a new phase of history . . . A turning point
that gave birth to dramatic world changes which led to the
so-called new world order."
   Though the rhetoric hasn't changed much over the decades,
this year, with Syria planning to attend next week's Mideast
peace conference in Madrid, commentators have drawn some new
lessons from the epic battle. But whether Mr. Assad is ready
to proclaim "victory" once and for all and make peace with
Israel -- as the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat did in
1979 -- remains to be seen.
   The very roots of today's peace process, the Syria Times
reports, were laid in the 1973 war, when Arabs threw off
their "inferiority complex" and showed the world their true
strength. Perhaps most important, says the TV narrator, even
Americans have come to realize the moral of October: Why
else, he asks, would President Bush have denied $10 billion
in loan guarantees to Israel last month?
   "The U.S. has started to read history properly," the
narrator explains. "The game of little, threatened David
doesn't work any more."
   Syria is awash in official jubilation. Government and
Ba'ath Party officers all month have been inaugurating
public-works projects to honor the people's "steadfastness."
In the city of Aleppo, a new laboratory for testing seeds was
consecrated to the glory of October. In rural areas,
officials have cut ribbons at schools, at new
agricultural-extension stations and at electrification
projects.
   In Damascus, Defense Minister Mustafa Tlas opened an
exhibit at the National Military Museum. Paintings by
military artists show Syrian rockets, planes and tanks
pounding Israeli forces on the Golan Heights. Others depict
Palestinians being beaten by Israeli soldiers. One shows
Jesus nailed to the cross with a snake coiled round his feet.
On the serpent's back is a Star of David.
   In the museum's October War of Liberation room, twisted
fragments of Israeli planes and tanks are displayed in glass
cases as if they were crown jewels. A captured Israeli flag
lies in a heap. Huge photographs show Israeli
prisoners-of-war sitting, heads between their knees and
wrists tethered behind their necks.
   Another old photo shows a grave and brooding Golda Meir,
Israel's prime minister during the 1973 war. Meanwhile, her
defense minister, Moshe Dayan, has his head buried in his
hands in obvious distress. A bigger photograph shows a
beaming Mr. Assad, surrounded by celebrating Syrians as he
hoists the nation's colors over the Golan town of Kuneitra,
which was given back by Israel after the war.
   Despite all the propaganda, most Syrians seem to know what
actually happened in 1973, and how the war turned out.
Although Syrians dismiss the government's version of Arab
victory -- as they do much of what Mr. Assad's autocratic
regime tells them -- many cherish their own personal
memories.
   "It's not a matter of victory in military terms; it can't
be measured meter by meter," explains Amin Bounni, whose
film, "Kuneitra, My Love," is one of more than a dozen Syrian
movies on the conflict. "The October War was the first Arab
initiative to liberate Arab land. Israel and the
Zionist-controlled media had said repeatedly that Arabs
couldn't fight. We proved that, when organized, we can
fight."
   The October War inspired all sorts of Syrian artists and
intellectuals. Some glorified the event merely to please the
government and keep their jobs. But many acted out of deep
feelings about Arab valor. Now, the very possibility of a
negotiated peace with Israel is making many Syrian thinkers
uncomfortable.
   "Arab intellectuals, especially Syrians, are like those
Japanese soldiers, lost in the islands after World War II,
who didn't know the war was over," says poet and playwright
Mamdou Adwan. "We know we lost the war, but inside, we're not
defeated."
   Several years ago, short-story writer and critic Mohammed
Khadur, took time off from his literary work to pursue a
special project: a comparison of Israeli jokes from the 1967
and 1973 wars. What he found confirmed suspicions here that
Israel had been humbled.
   After the Six Day War, Mr. Khadur explains, Israeli jokes
depicted Israelis as invincible, while describing Arabs as
"dirty, cowardly liars, afraid of their own shadows." In one,
Mr. Dayan asks President Lyndon Johnson for permission to
conquer the Golan Heights, West Bank and Gaza Strip. The
request granted, Mr. Dayan asks: "What shall we do in the
afternoon?"
   In the 1973 war, however, Israeli humor had turned dark.
In one cartoon from the midst of war, says Mr. Khadur, edging
forward in his chair to be ready for his next punch line, a
sign is posted by the door of the war-room at Israel's
military headquarters in Tel Aviv: "Last man out," it reads,
"Turn out the lights."

<TEXT>
   Two men who served Japan's war effort in
Malaysia during World War II and remained in a remote jungle to
help Communist rebels for 45 years returned home Saturday saying
they hope to help modern-day Japan.
   Relatives and friends greeted Shigeyuki Hashimoto, 71, and
Kiyoaki Tanaka, 77, with flowers at Tokyo's Narita airport as the
men, appearing frail and weary, were taken from their plane in
wheelchairs.
   The two, who left in 1944 to work in a wartime Japanese iron
factory in Malaysia _ then called Malaya _ said they joined
Communist guerrillas after the war in 1945 to help the country gain
independence from Britain, Japan's former enemy.
   ``We fought for a long time and faced a range of difficulties,''
Hashimoto told reporters. ``We lost touch with all of our old
friends. Now only the two of us are still alive.''
   On Wednesday, the two men left the Malaysian border jungle where
they and their comrades in the Communist Party of Malaya fought for
45 years.
   The insurgency ended in December, when Communist leaders reached
a peace agreement with Malaysian and Thai government officials.
   ``We're Japanese, so we never forgot about Japan, even for one
day,'' Tanaka said. ``We looked forward greatly to returning to
Japan, but as Japanese we couldn't leave behind the people we were
fighting alongside for all those years until this opportunity.''
   Tanaka's wife, Haruse, 72, was unable to travel to the airport
because of illness, but she watched her husband's return on
television.
   Several other relatives had flown earlier to Thailand to meet
the men and accompanied them back to Japan.
   ``I never doubted he was still alive but I did not hear from him
or about him for nearly 50 years, so of course I was worried,''
said Hashimoto's sister, Kikuko Ishiwatari, 74.
   Both will be hospitalized for about 10 days for medical
check-ups, a Health and Welfare Ministry official said.
   ``I don't know anything about modern-day Japan,'' Hashimoto told
reporters in a weak voice. ``But I hope to learn as much as
possible and do what I can to help the nation.''
   When Malaya gained its independence from Britain in 1957,
Hashimoto said, ``We could have returned to Japan but it would have
required our surrender to the Malaya government, and we chose not
to do so.''
   He said they decided to fight until the Communist insurgency
ended and they succeeded in establishing a Maoist state. ``But last
year, a peace accord was reached and we became finally free so we
could come back to Japan.''
   His account was interrupted by doctors who cautioned him against
further efforts to speak.
   While in the jungle, the two men reportedly learned of changes
in Japan from a shortwave radio.
   During the insurgency, the Communists fought against British
Commonwealth forces in bloody battles during what was known as the
1948-1960 ``emergency.'' Fighting then continued on a lesser scale.
More recently, Thai-Malaysian military strikes and a Thai amnesty
badly hurt the guerrilla movement, leading to December's peace
agreement.
   Over the years, a number of former Japanese Imperial Army
soldiers have emerged from long periods of isolation in remote
areas of Asia controlled by Japan during World War II.
   The government is investigating the cases of 48 former Japanese
soldiers who could still be alive, according to the Health and
Welfare Ministry.

   Today is Sunday, June 5, the 157th day of 1988. There are 209
days left in the year.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   Twenty years ago, on June 5, 1968, at 12:16 a.m. local time,
Sen., Robert F. Kennedy was shot and mortally wounded at the
Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles shortly after claiming victory in
California's Democratic presidential primary. Five other people
were wounded. Kennedy's assassin, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, was
immediately arrested.
   On this date:
   In 1723, economist Adam Smith was born in Kirkcaldy, Scotland.
   In 1783, Joseph and Jacques Montgolfier publicly demonstrated
their hot air balloon in a 10-minute flight over Annonay, France.
   In 1883, economist John Maynard Keynes was born in Cambridge,
England.
   In 1884, Civil War hero Gen. William T. Sherman refused the
Republican presidential nomination with the words, ``I will not
accept if nominated and will not serve if elected.''
   In 1888, the Democratic national convention in St. Louis, Mo.,
nominated President Grover Cleveland for a second term in office.
(He lost to Benjamin Harrison that November, but was elected
president again in 1892.)
   In 1917, about 10 million American men began registering for the
draft in World War I.
   In 1933, the United States went off the gold standard.
   In 1940, the Battle of France began during World War II.
   In 1947, Secretary of State George C. Marshall gave a speech at
Harvard University outlining a program of aid for Europe that would
become known as ``The Marshall Plan.''
   In 1967, tensions between Israel and its Arab neighbors erupted
into the Six-Day War. (The fighting ended June 10 with a United
Nations-negotiated cease-fire.)
   In 1975, Egypt reopened the Suez Canal to international
shipping, exactly eight years after it was closed because of the
Six-Day War with Israel.
   In 1976, 11 people were killed when the Teton Dam in Idaho
burst, sending 80 billion gallons of water churning down the Upper
Snake River Valley.
   Ten years ago: The U.S. Supreme Court let stand a lower court
decision striking down a New Hampshire statutory rape law because
it named only young girls as potential victims, and therefore
discriminated against men.
   Five years ago: ``Cats'' won the best musical award and ``Torch
Song Trilogy'' was recognized as best play at the 37th annual

FT  14 SEP 93 / Israel and the PLO: Old soldier in front line for peace

MR BENJAMIN Ben-Eliezer, Israel's minister of housing, has seen the worst
side of Arab-Israeli wars. Now, after 27 years as a combat soldier in all of
Israel's main post-independence conflicts, he is one of Israel's most ardent
supporters of peace.
'Its a very, very special day for me,' he said in an interview yesterday. 'A
day which could end years of fighting and offer new hope, new opportunities
and new challenges.'
Apart from Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, Mr Ben-Eliezer - known in
Israel by his Arabic name Fouad - is the only general in the Israeli
cabinet. His support for the peace agreement springs directly from his long
career as a military man which began in 1954 when, at age 18, he joined the
elite Golani brigade of the Israel Defence Force.
'I owed some answers to my five children,' said the 58-year-old minister,
who was born in the Iraqi town of Basra and speaks, reads and writes fluent
Arabic. 'I wanted to make sure that after they completed their military
service if they were ever called again to fight another war with Arabs they
should know that my generation - the generation that fought for the country
across all those painful decades - had taken all the risks to change the
future and the destiny of our country.'
It is a remarkable statement for a man who has been at the cutting edge of
the battle against the Palestine Liberation Organisation. During the 1967
Six Day War he served as a commander of an elite reconnaissance battalion
making raids across enemy lines, in 1969 he was wounded during an airborne
raid on a PLO camp in Jordan and throughout the 1970s he fought the PLO in
Lebanon - becoming, in 1976, the first Israeli military officer to enter
Beirut when he slipped into the country from a missile boat to help build up
the Lebanese Christian Phalange militia, then fighting the PLO on the
streets of Beirut.
Later he was commander of southern Lebanon, military governor of the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and co-ordinator of government activities in all
the occupied territories.
'For years we thought there was no alternative but to fight and fight and
fight. That is why this is such a historical change - hopefully to bring an
end to wars and battles and to bring something new - a new Middle East,' he
said.
In 1984 'Fouad' left the army, joined the Labour party and entered Israel's
parliament. He quickly earned the disapproval of many MPs when, in a
now-famous speech made a year before the eruption of the intifada
(Palestinian uprising) - he warned that the territories were heading for 'a
rebellion or mass civil disobedience. The process has begun and within three
to five years we will have a full-scale revolt on our hands'.
He said a whole generation of Palestinians had grown up knowing nothing but
military occupation and he urged Israel to seize the moment, make a drastic
change of direction, and give the Palestinians autonomy over their own
affairs. Nobody listened then. Six years later the Israeli nation agreed.
And the man tipped one day to be prime minister is looking like a visionary.
The agreement, Mr Ben-Eliezer says, is not without risks but they are
calculated risks. The greatest risks, he says, are the possibility of a
change in the leaderships of neighbouring Arabic states and the rise of
Islamic fundamentalism.
The greatest opportunities, he adds, are in a new Middle East of economic
co-operation, and he believes his ministry will be in the forefront of
building new roads and ports to service the Middle East.
Much will depend, he stresses, on whether the experimental trial period of
interim Palestinian self-rule works out and builds confidence on both sides.
And in a symbolic gesture, the minister yesterday opened a new housing
project for Israeli Arabs in Lod, right next to a Jewish neighbourhood.
'For centuries Arabs and Jews lived together. We are both Semitic peoples,
after all. I hope we can live in peace again, separately, but with mutual
respect, understanding and co-operation. We need to live together but also
separately because everyone has to live with something that belongs just to
him.'

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Today, as armies mass for war on the desert
sands of Arabia, aging veterans of another desert battle will
gather 1,000 miles away to honor their fallen comrades. They fought
at El-Alamein on Egypt's northern coast in an epic clash of tanks
that stopped Germany's Desert Fox and gave the allies a crucial
victory in World War II.

   EL-ALAMEIN, Egypt (AP) - They were young soldiers, far from
home, huddled in desert sands, waiting for the nighttime sky to
explode.
   The last time some of them would ever look at their watches was
9:39 p.m., Oct. 23, 1942. In one minute the wails of bagpipes would
summon the guns of Bernard Law Montgomery's 8th Army, the Desert
Rats, and the final battle at El-Alamein would begin.
   Such abombardment had not been seen since World War I. What
followed was one of history's great tank battles along Egypt's
barren but beautiful northern coast.
   How many died to turn the tide of German victories, nobody
knows. But after El-Alamein, it was the Allied forces marching
forward. After El-Alamein, Adolf Hitler's dreams of world conquest
began to sour.
   Lance Barnard, a former deputy prime minister of Australia,
served with the 9th Australian Division, the Diggers, who took the
brunt of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's fury at the end of
El-Alamein's final battle.
   ``Each generation seems to produce another dictator and somebody
has to go out and stop him,'' Barnard said.
   Twelve hundred Diggers are among the 7,354 men of the combined
British Commonwealth forces buried at El-Alamein. They proved that
Germany's seemingly invincible Rommel, the Desert Fox, and his
famous Afrika Korps could be beaten after all.
   Six days after the Allied victory on Nov. 4, British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill gave El-Alamein its place in World War
II history: ``This is not the end. It is not even the beginning of
the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.''
   Patience would prove him right. The ordeal of Stalingrad was
then only beginning, American Marines were digging in at
Guadalcanal and D-day - the beginning of the end - still was almost
two years away.
   Historians debate whether El-Alamein was the most crucial battle
of the war, but none ignores what happened here.
   After sweeping through Libya, Axis forces under Rommel sped
along the only road on northern Egypt's coastline toward Cairo, the
Suez Canal and the rich oil fields of Persia. They could smell
victory.
   Allied commander Montgomery had other ideas. He sent escape
vehicles to the rear and told his troops: ``If Alamein is lost,
Egypt is lost. If we cannot stay at Alamein alive, we will stay
there dead.''
   The cost of winning and losing the battles of El-Alamein, which
raged off and on from July until November 1942, was staggering.
Dead still lie in unfound desert graves, but the number of
casualties on both sides has been estimated at 65,000. The Allies
suffered 13,500 dead and wounded. Half the forces of Germany and
Italy were killed, wounded or captured.
   The opposing forces were uneven. Montgomery had 11 divisions,
about 210,000 men. He had 1,200 tanks, more than 1,000 field and
medium guns, adequate fuel and ammunition and a short line of
communications to his home base in Cairo.
   Rommel commanded four German and eight Italian divisions and
some independent units. He had no more than 108,000 men and 600
tanks but plenty of artillery. Also, he relied on 5 million mines
planted in the 50-mile-wide El-Alamein bottleneck between the
Mediterranean Sea and the quicksand of the Qattara Depression. His
fatal flaws were the lack of fuel and a steady supply line.
   The battle of El-Alamein should have been a showpiece for tank
warfare. It wasn't. Tanks broke down - the tinny Italian version
was nicknamed ``self-propelled coffin'' - and the Qattara to the
south prevented brilliant manuevering.
   Montgomery lost 600 tanks, about the number Rommel had when the
battle began, and by Nov. 2 Rommel was fighting with only 30.
   In his diary Rommel lamented the battle: ``Rivers of blood were
spilled over a miserable strip of land which in normal times even
the poorest Arab would never have bothered about.''
   Today's El-Alamein is not much better. But its stilled
battlefields, a military museum and monuments of the famous battles
beckon visitors to make the four-hour trek from Cairo.
   Each year since 1978, individual countries have put aside
differences to honor the fallenWorld War II desert fighters of all
sides at observances on the Sunday nearest the Oct. 23 battle
anniversary. The service, attended by hundreds of diplomats,
veterans and well-wishers, rotates among the Commonwealth Cemetery
and the German and Italian memorials.
   This year's is Oct. 21 at the Italian monument atop a hillside
overlooking the Mediterranean.
   El-Alamein's newest memorial is a simple but poignant obelisk
honoring the Australian Diggers. The 20-foot-tall monument of
locally quarried limestone and Australian granite stands before the
Commonwealth Cemetery and its thousands of Allied dead.
   The monument was dedicated in the spring of 1989, and for the
Australians it was long overdue.
   Barnard, the former deputy prime minister, and Everard Baillieu
of Melbourne, a gunner severely wounded at El-Alamein, spearheaded
the campaign for a monument to honor their fallen comrades-in-arms.
   ``It's such an emotional experience for me to go back to
Alamein. It was the place we stopped Rommel's advance, forced him
to go back, leave North Africa,'' Barnard said by telephone from
Melbourne. He has made the pilgrimage four times.
   ``The first visit I made I was looking at the graves of my
comrades, the graves of my friends. Each time I come I believe more
and more that victory was made possible because of the efforts of
the 9th Division.''
   Melbourne attorney Frank Minotti, another veteran of the 9th,
has written a division history. He wrote that until the obelisk,
``no one visiting the cemetery would find anything to tell them
what part the Australians played in those famous battles, and in
what circumstances those in the cemetery gave their lives.''
   There are guest registers at the memorials for the Commonwealth,
German and Italian soldiers. Few leave El-Alamein without shedding
a tear.
   Last July 18, Australian Margaret Gillespie visited the
Commonwealth Cemetery. ``My brother Jim, always remembered by his
family,'' she wrote.
   David and Myrna McDonell of Brisbane: ``May there never be cause
for such a sad place.''

<TEXT>
   An Army board has refused to grant the Medal
of Honor to a World War II veteran who colleagues claimed was
passed over for decoration because he was Jewish, an Army official,
Lt. Col. Terry Adkins, said today.
   David S. Rubitsky, then an Army sergeant, had been recommended
for the medal by company and battalion commanders. They cited a
battle in the jungles of New Guinea in which he was said to have
killed more than 500 Japanese soldiers.
   Adkins said an ``exhaustive'' two-year investigation into
Rubitsky's claims showed the battle ``did not occur as alleged.''
   As for the claim that Rubitsky was denied the medal because of
anti-Semitism, he said, ``I could not find any basis of fact in
this.''
   Rubitsky, who lives in Wisconsin, was notified Thursday night of
the decision and the army presented its findings to Congress today,
Adkins said.
   The Army's decision was first reported today by The New York
Times.
   Board officials said the lack of official records, the death of
witnesses and the failing memories of those who survived the
campaign thwarted their review.
   But the toughest obstacle was the implausibility that one
soldier _ armed with a machine gun, automatic rifle and a carbine _
could inflict such damage singlehandedly.
   They said Rubitsky would have needed large amounts of ammunition
and would have been able to fire only one weapon while the Japanese
returned his fire, forcing him to keep his head down and shoot
without taking aim.
   Board officials said it was most likely Rubitsky fought well and
had inflicted heavy casualties.
   The story of Rubitsky's heroics had been largely forgotten until
1986, when during a reunion of the 128th Regiment he fought in, it
was learned he had never been recommended for the Medal of Honor.
After the war, Rubitsky traveled the world as a merchant marine for
more than 30 years.
   J.M. Stehling, his company commander, said in a recently
notarized statement: ``I personally inspected the battle scene and
there were more than 500 Japanese killed or wounded by the actions
of Sgt. Rubitsky. His actions were heroic, and he should receive
the Medal of Honor.''
   In another statement, Herbert A. Smith, a retired major general
who was Rubitsky's battalion commander, said he passed Stehling's
recommendation to Col. John H. Mott, chief of staff of the 32nd
Division.
   ``Col. Mott's answer was, `You mean a Jew for the Congressional
Medal of Honor?''' said Smith, who died three months ago.
   Smith said Mott, who also is dead, ``just laughed and walked
away.''
   The board also looked at a handwritten notation on a yellowing
photograph that had been removed from the body of a Japanese
officer 47 years ago. He said he would commit suicide to atone for
having sent into battle ``600 fine Japanese soldiers (who) died
because of a solitary American soldier.''
   Secret Service experts in counterfeiting told Sen. Herbert H.
Kohl, D-Wis., that the ink and paper of the photograph that
recently came to light were consistent with materials used in 1942.
They concluded there was no reason to believe the photo was
``anything other than genuine.''
   Kohl's office had interceded on behalf of Rubitsky, a Wisconsin
resident.
   Of 295 Medals of Honor awarded in World War II, none went to
black soldiers. Only two went to Jews, according to the Jewish War
Veterans of America.

   The white marble headstone on Vladimir
Mikhalev's grave is a reminder in this bastion of World War II
valor that he died in Afghanistan, but there is no monument to
those who fought the war the Soviets didn't win.
   The Soviet Union's 115,000 troops are to begin the long-awaited
march home this spring. And the nation must deal with the problem
of how to remember those who served and those who died in
Afghanistan.
   The human losses suffered since Soviet soldiers entered
Afghanistan in December 1979 and the emotional wounds were
unmentionable topics in 1981, when Mikhalev, 23, was buried in
Chizhukovskoye cemetery among the heroes of World War II.
   The troops were sent in to defeat a revolt by anti-communists
and leave behind an Afghan army capable of standing on its own.
Neither goal was fulfilled, war weariness has set in and Soviets
are now anxious for withdrawal.
   The Afghan war has left many returning soldiers deeply disturbed
by their tour of duty in that Asian land. Drug addiction, a
predilection for violence, apathy, disease, crippling wounds and
broken marriages also are byproducts of the Afghan war.
   Significantly, the veterans are called ``the Afghans'' by many
Soviets _ a clear sign, say many returning soldiers, that they are
branded as outcasts.
   In few other cities is the contrast between the social status of
Afghan veterans and those who struggled against the Nazis more
apparent than in Minsk, a ``Hero City'' virtually destroyed in
World War II and rebuilt as a monument to Soviet suffering and
perseverance.
   Every major intersection and park has a war memorial or statue
depicting a local hero. Here and in other cities, veterans of what
is known as the Great Patriotic War proudly wear their medals and
campaign ribbons.
   But not a single memorial has been erected in the Soviet Union
to the soldiers killed in the 8-year-old Soviet military
intervention in Afghanistan.
   The sole reminders are the stern young faces and bronze busts of
young men staring from graveyards around the country. Few
tombstones say the youths were killed in Afghanistan, but all who
pass by know the meaning of the inscription ``he died while
fulfilling his internationalist duty.''
   At Chizhukovskoye cemetery, the plaque on Vladislav Ivanovsky's
headstone is engraved with rare directness: ``Perished in
Afghanistan.''
   An estimated 10,000 Soviets died in the war that was
unmentionable until Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for
``glasnost,'' or openness, made it acceptable conversation.
   The casualty estimates by Western sources pale in comparison
with the 20 million Soviets killed during World War II. But grief
is no easier for survivors of Afghanistan victims, and veterans
from both conflicts acknowledge the problem goes deeper than
numbers.
   ``It's been 40 years since World War II,'' Sergei Kuznetsov told
an American reporter at a recent meeting of Afghan vets in Moscow.
``We are sometimes an uncomfortable reminder to those accustomed to
peace.''
   Soviets cling to the euphemisms used to label their activity in
Afghanistan, denying it was a war, contending they never sought
victory, and always lowering their voices when the subject comes up.
   ``It cannot be said that we went there to win. We went there to
help,'' explained Alexander Maslov, a metal worker in Minsk who
alongside his twin brother Mikhail served two years in Kabul. ``The
leadership of Afghanistan asked us to help.''
   A tone of defensiveness permeates his discussion of the war.
``There is no reason to consider this a mistake,'' the 24-year-old
veteran said, referring to the Kremlin's decision to send in
troops. ``If it were necessary, we would do it again.''
   The Maslov twins contend Afghanistan veterans receive priority
for housing and jobs. Yet each lives with his wife and child in a
single room of a city dormitory.
   State-run media have come a long way in the past few years in
acknowledging that Soviet soldiers were involved in combat and that
there was resistance at home, from fearful mothers of draft-age
boys to advisers at the top levels of power.
   The Soviets' experience in Afghanistan is similar to U.S.
soldiers' service in Vietnam. But the Vietnam War was brought home
to Americans daily through media coverage that focused as much on
individual suffering as on the political issues involved.
   In contrast, Soviet media have carefully sanitized reports to
cast the conflict as a ``situation around Afghanistan'' brought
about by imperialist interference.
   Spurred on by glasnost, about 2,000 Afghanistan veterans groups
have sprung up around the country to talk to school children about
their service, to help widows and mothers, and to talk over
experiences they say outsiders don't understand.
   In Moscow, Sergei Kuznetsov's group, which gathers on occasional
Saturdays, has found a medium in song for issues most of the men
find difficult to openly discuss.
   The mournful ballads about buddies killed in battle and the
frustration of fighting a distant and little understood war have
been collected and issued by the Young Guard recording company.
   One song reflects veterans' disillusionment, and a glimmer of
the belief that Soviet involvement in a foreign civil war was
pointless. In part, it says:
   ``They fight for the prophet Mohammed,
   ``While we defend only our Soviet truck.''
   ``The Return,'' a short documentary making its way into Soviet
theaters, for the first time shows wounded soldiers and blown up
tanks, and talks with troubled veterans and a bereaved mother.
   ``I'm a terrible enemy of this war,'' says a tearful Klavdia
Ilyin, with a picture of her fallen son on a shelf in the
background. ``I don't see why our children are there.''
   Newspapers have announced fund-raising campaigns to erect
monuments to the ``soldier-internationalists,'' and articles in the
national dailies have decried the second-class treatment of Afghan
veterans by those who don't want to be reminded of the war.
   ``Most people think our boys have been down there planting
flowers and building roads,'' observed one World War II veteran in
Moscow. ``How can they earn the respect they deserve when so few
know what they have done?''

AGING WORLD WAR II VETERANS ARE RUSHING TO COLLECT SOME LONG OVERDUE MEDALS.
THOSE COMBAT STORIES WERE TRUE, AFTER ALL.

<P>
After hearing the same story for 37 years, Jean Hemenway knew it by heart. Her
husband was a World War II hero who had dashed through machine gun and mortar
fire during a 1945 battle in the Philippines to save a wounded buddy's life.
</P>
<P>
Trouble was, Clyde Hemenway didn't have any Army medals to prove his mettle. If
he really had done what he said, where was his Purple Heart? Where were the
combat ribbons? And where was the medal for battlefield valor?
</P>
<P>
"I did believe him," Jean Hemenway said. "He'd told people about it all these
years. Not that they didn't believe him -- but there wasn't any proof."
</P>
<P>
There is now. Two months ago, the Army awarded the 78-year-old retired Norwalk
mailman six medals that it failed to present him 44 years ago. And officials
say a seventh battle ribbon is on the way.
</P>
<P>
Hemenway is among thousands of World War II veterans who are rushing to get the
military to present them with wartime commendations they earned but never
received. Former soldiers applied for 400,000 forgotten World War II ribbons
last year, according to Army officials. That was 60% more than the number of
requests received just four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Army officials say they ran out of medals when the war ended and they were
caught in a crush of GIs being discharged. Soldiers hurrying home from
battlefields in Europe and the South Pacific were told they could pick up their
medals later.
</P>
<P>
After the war, many of the servicemen were too busy establishing families and
civilian careers to bother.
</P>
<P>
But these days, ex-GIs who have reached retirement age have the time -- and the
inclination -- to track down their awards. And military officials are hurrying
to catch up with the crush of requests.
</P>
<P>
The medals are shipped from an Army warehouse in Philadelphia, not far from the
Liberty Bell. Officials at times have worked around the clock to fill the
requests. There is a four-month backlog now, said Larry Smith, acting chief of
the medals distribution office.
</P>
<P>
"I think a lot guys now want their medals as a legacy for their children or
grandchildren," Smith said. "Some of the requests are from elderly people who
are ill. We try to expedite them."
</P>
<P>
An Army records office in St. Louis that checks out each request for a medal is
six to nine months behind in its work, said Gladys Maeser, an Army spokeswoman.
The verification job has been complicated by a 1973 fire that damaged or
destroyed 80% of all World War II records.
</P>
<P>
Military officials predict that they will see new surges in medal requests as
servicemen who fought in Korea and Vietnam grow older. But they point out that
fewer Americans were called to duty in those conflicts than in World War II.
</P>
<P>
The Army has already shipped out thousands of Vietnam War medals. "Most of them
are first-time issue" and not replacements, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the guys have told me they didn't want them back then, when they got
out. But later on, they've thought about what they went through, or now their
kids want to see their medals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Military officials say their policy is to try to quickly and ceremoniously
award commendations to servicemen involved in the infrequent combat operations
of today.
</P>
<P>
The Army temporarily ran out of Combat Infantryman Badges when it started
awarding them to soldiers involved in battles during December's invasion of
Panama, said Kathleen Ross, an Army spokeswoman in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
To the dismay of some veterans of World War II, however, the only uniform they
see when they finally do receive their medals is that of the U.S. Postal
Service. The awards are simply mailed, as in Hemenway's case, unless advance
arrangements have been made with the Army or a congressional office.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the Army will arrange for an Army Reserve officer to present
the medals if requested. "If they ask, we try to accommodate them. It's an
honor they deserve," Ross said.
</P>
<P>
"More children now are getting involved. Their parents are getting older and
they want to make sure they get tributes and honors and feel special," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Gunnery Sgt. Douglas Pence, a Marine Corps spokesman in Los Angeles, said
former Marines are referred to a "decorations and awards" office in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"People lose track of time," said Christina Johnson, a Navy chief journalist
whose Los Angeles public affairs office refers ex-sailors' medal inquiries to
Washington. "Older guys are trying to tie up loose ends."
</P>
<P>
Former Army airborne trooper Tony Marincola, 72, of Canyon Country, received
eight overdue medals three months ago. He said he was not told of the awards he
had earned when he left the service in 1946.
</P>
<P>
"When you're first discharged, you're young and you don't care what happened,"
said the retired tool supervisor. "But as you get older, your children ask
about the war and whether you got any medals."

Marincola has placed his awards in a display cabinet, including a Purple Heart
belatedly received for a wound suffered in the Battle of the Bulge. "My two
daughters are real proud of me," he said.
</P>
<P>
Former Army Ranger Frank Romero, 71, of Canoga Park, also received eight medals
after sending copies of his military records to the Army last year. The retired
truck driver said awards were not discussed when he was liberated after
spending 16 months as a German prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
He had told his three children about his wartime experiences. "Now they know,"
Romero said.
</P>
<P>
Along with seven World War II medals, Bill Buckman, 67, of Chatsworth, was
surprised when he received four others for duty in Korea after asking Army
officials to check his records.
</P>
<P>
"Part of it was the way you were interviewed at the time of your discharge.
They didn't have access to my records at the time. And part of it was just my
memory," said Buckman, a retired electrical engineer now involved with American
Legion work.
</P>
<P>
Sigurd Carlson, a 62-year-old retired high school teacher from Studio City,
said that several of the five medals he recently received from the Marine Corps
"weren't made yet" when he was discharged in 1946 after fighting in four major
South Pacific battles.
</P>
<P>
"It makes my family feel good. It's something you can leave them," said
Carlson, who now works with veterans at the VA Hospital in Sepulveda through a
service organization called AMVETS.
</P>
<P>
Carlson has helped other veterans with the paper work required to collect their
medals. One of them, former Marine George Hatzadakis, received seven awards.
</P>
<P>
"There was awe in my two daughters' faces when they saw them," said Hatzadakis,
a former county auditor's investigator who has retired to the Greek island of
Crete but is currently visiting Los Angeles. "I'm going to fix them up in a
display and let them fight it out over who gets them."
</P>
<P>
Clyde Hemenway said he started writing letters to officials about his missing
medals two years ago. "I decided my grandchildren might like to see them," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad to finally get them. Of course, it would have been better if I'd had
them when I came home from overseas. Back then, everybody was talking about the
war being over. Everybody was interested in what you'd done."
</P>
<P>
His awards include a Purple Heart, Bronze Star and Good Conduct Medal and
American Campaign, American Defense, Asiatic Pacific Campaign and Victory
battle ribbons.
</P>
<P>
The Purple Heart and Bronze Star were awarded because of his actions as a
33-year-old Army medic on May 12, 1945. His rifle company was involved in a
five-hour battle in Manigima Canyon, on the Philippine island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"I went after a wounded rifleman. He was bleeding very badly and I knew he
didn't have all day," Hemenway recalled. "Machine-gun bullets were hitting the
ground on both sides of me when I ran about 25 yards to him. I got hit in the
back by a mortar fragment. I dragged him behind some grass to patch him up. He
had seven or eight machine-gun holes in him."
</P>
<P>
The soldier, named Snyder, survived his wounds. So did Hemenway -- who
remembers being grateful just to be alive when he shipped home five months
later.
</P>
<P>
"I'd spent the last eight months in a rifle company and not once had I gone
after a wounded man and not drawn fire," he said. "As a kid, I had never been
the hero kind. I would never climb as high in the tree as the other boys. But
here I was, doing it."
</P>
<P>
He plans to proudly show his medals to his 10 grandchildren at a family reunion
on Sunday. He expects to have to explain to the youngest of them what World War
II was.
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather used to talk about the Civil War when I was a boy and I thought
that was ancient history," Hemenway said with a grin. "So many people today
didn't live through World War II. To them, that's ancient history."

   Guns rumble in the dark and tracer bullets cut
across no man's land. Smoke hangs in the air, mingled with the
smells of cordite and frying bacon.
   ``I thought I was back,'' Tommy Keele, a 96-year-old veteran of
World War I, said at the opening last month of a reconstructed
trench of the Western Front.
   Then he added: ``The smell of death _ that's not here.''
   Keele was among guests invited to the unveiling of the Imperial
War Museum's latest attempt to convey the atmosphere of war to
generations that have never known it.
   Britain is caught up in memories of World War II this summer.
Keele, who fought in both wars, said his recollections of World War
I, and the slaughter of the trenches, were the more vivid.
   ``Two of my mates were buried under us by a shell,'' he said.
``We dug them out, horribly mangled, and buried them along the
trench. As I pulled one, he fell to pieces. The smell of death was
all over me and I couldn't eat or drink for three days.''
   A year ago, the Imperial War Museum opened a reconstruction of a
World War II air raid shelter.
   ``Now we have gone farther back to what it was like for the
infantry at the Battle of the Somme in 1916,'' said Dr. Alan Borg,
the museum's director.
   ``We tried to get the trench as right as we could. We found the
only machine left which could sew sandbags the way they were made
in that war, because the method of sewing was changed in the 1920s.
And we went to the old Somme battlefield in France and brought back
two bags of earth to get the texture right for the sides of our
trench.''
   Baron Hermann von Richthofen, the West German ambassador and a
descendant of the German air ace Manfred von Richthofen, the ``Red
Baron,'' attended the opening ceremony.
   The impact of a battlefield is created with life-size models of
soldiers carrying real guns, bayonets and gas masks. There are even
stuffed rats.
   In the freezing early hours of an October morning, a soldier in
a niche in the sandbagged wall fries bacon over a brazier while a
recorded Yorkshire voice reads a genuine letter home.
   ``You asked what life is like in the trenches,'' the soldier
wrote to his father. ``It is very boring most of the time. We sleep
in the day as there's not much to be had at night. You share house
and home with rats and burn lice out of the seat of your pants with
candles.''
   Two sentries light cigarettes. A Lewis gun fires tracers. A
shell has just exploded, demolishing sandbags and pouring fumes
into the narrow trench.
   Artillery roars in the distance. Commands and cries ring out
from a dawn attack going ``over the top.'' A soldier with head and
chest wounds groans.
   In a dugout lie relics from the Western Front: barbed wire
cutters, gas masks, a rattle to warn of a poison gas attack,
ammunition boxes, a sniper shield, a windup phonograph, canned milk
and postcards.
   Four periscopes show no man's land from 100 yards to 2 miles in
a vista created from contemporary photographs.
   Cyril Dennys, 93, fought in the 1917 Battle of Passchendaele. He
recalled that 65,000 tons of shells fired in 17 days to soften up
the enemy also destroyed the drainage system of the level Flemish
plain.
   The attack began and raged for weeks in pitiless rain; men
drowned in the mud. Britain lost 300,000 dead.
   Visitors leaving the trench see a display case containing the
four penciled sheets of the last letter to his wife Lizzie from
Pvt. Jack Mudd of the London Regiment, and the red poppy he sent
home from a Flanders field.
   He put nine crosses for kisses after his signature.
   ``God bless you and my children and may He soon send me back to
those I love is the wish of your faithful husband, Jack,'' is the
last sentence of the letter.
   Mudd was killed at Ypres on Oct. 26, 1917.

<HL> Letters to the Editor: What Would Douglas MacArthur Say? </HL>
<SO> </SO>
<G> SUP CNG </G>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. has acknowledged and corrected "a wrong" of imprisoning Japanese-American citizens in the early days of World War II by making a formal apology and compensating the individuals.
Recently Congress and the president have proclaimed that the Supreme Court was wrong in upholding that notorious law.

   Today, there is another "wrong" that our government should correct promptly.
In times of war our government bestowed U.S. citizenship upon aliens who fought in the U.S. Armed Forces.
The alien warriors of World War I, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War and Grenada have been rewarded by becoming citizens of the U.S.

   The only alien warriors who have been forgotten are the Filipino nationals who served in the U.S. Armed Forces/Far East from 1942 until 1945.
Even though Gen. Douglas MacArthur proudly proclaimed, "I shall return" to liberate the Philippines from the Japanese invaders, thousands of faithful Filipino warriors fought on for the U.S. in the Philippines during the entire war.
Many were captured, imprisoned, tortured and put to death by the Japanese.

   For 46 years these heroes of the infamous Bataan Death March and survivors of Corregidor have been "fighting" a legal battle with the U.S. for their U.S. citizenship.
Recently, the Supreme Court ruled that Filipino War Veterans do not qualify for naturalization if they did not file their petitions with the Naturalization Examiners in the Philippines before Dec. 31, 1945, because the Philippines became an independent republic in 1946.
However, no formal termination notices were provided to the Filipino heroes at that time.

   If Congress can legalize "illegal aliens," certainly our country can provide U.S. citizenship to alien warriors who fought and defended this government.
The survivors are now few in number and aged in years.
They are unable to fight in the courts as they have limited economic resources and do not qualify for legal aid.
Why can't Congress reward the Filipino War Veterans of the U.S. Armed Forces of World War II as Congress intended by the Nationality Act of 1940?

  [Text] Tokyo, May 7 KYODO -- Justice Minister Shigeto
Nagano resigned Saturday [7 May] over his remarks that the 1937
Nanjing massacre never happened and that Japan was not an
aggressor in World War II, and was replaced by Hiroshi Nakai of
the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP].
  Nagano, a 71-year-old former serviceman who served for only
10 days as justice minister, submitted his resignation to Prime
Minister Tsutomu Hata, who just returned from a six-day tour of
four European countries.
  Hata accepted Nagano's resignation and named a successor
from
the DSP, a party in the ruling coalition. Nagano is a member of
Shinseito, a core party of the coalition led by the prime
minister.
  Nakai, 51, is a House of Representatives lawmaker and a
former deputy secretary general of the DSP.
  Nakai's appointment is scheduled to be attested by Emperor
Akihito at 10 A.M. Sunday, government sources said.
  Nagano apologized to Hata for the trouble caused by his
"inappropriate remarks" and vowed personal action to show that
Japan will not start a war again, Nagano said after meeting Hata.
  Nagano told Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai earlier
in the day that he would resign because his comments had caused
so much turmoil among Japan's international relations.
  Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the largest opposition
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), called Nagano's resignation a
"matter of course," saying the remarks spoiled the LDP's
diplomatic efforts with neighboring nations during its 38-year
rule which ended last August.
  Nagano said in an interview published Wednesday in major
daily MAINICHI SHIMBUN, "the Nanjing incident was a fabrication."
  He also said, "I think it is wrong to define the war as a
war
of aggression (by Japan) ... Still, I doubt the Greater East
Asia War, as it was called in Japan, was aimed at aggression."
  Following criticism from China, North and South Korea and
other Asian countries Japan invaded before and during World War
II, Nagano retracted his remarks and apologized at a news
conference Friday.
  China estimates that imperial Japanese Army troops massacred
more than 300,000 Chinese civilians following their invasion of
the then Chinese capital of Nanjing in December 1937. But
Japanese historians tend to give lower estimates -- mostly to
the order of 100,000.
  Nagano is the third minister to resign in eight years over
similar remarks about the war.
  In September 1986, Masayuki Fujio resigned as education
minister under the administration of Yasuhiro Nakasone after
provoking China and Korea with his remarks on Japan's prewar
actions.
  Fujio said Japan's annexation of Korea in 1910 was based on
an agreement between the two countries and justified the
Japanese act of colonization of the Korean peninsula. He also
criticized Nakasone for canceling his visit to Yasukuni Shrine,
which is dedicated to 2.4 million war dead, including A-class
war criminals.
  Seisuke Okuno resigned as National Land Agency chief under
the administration of Noboru Takeshita in May 1988 over his war
remarks.
  "Japan fought the war in order to secure its safety ... Asia
was colonized by Caucasians at that time. Japan was by no means
a nation of aggression," he said.

<TEXT>
   Two years and another administration ago, the
Pentagon promised to study the records of black soldiers to
determine why none of them received the Medal of Honor for valor
during World Wars I and II.
   Since then, George Bush was elected president and the two
congressmen who were bird-dogging the Pentagon on the subject are
gone: Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas, died in a plane crash and Joseph
DioGuardi, R-N.Y., was defeated for re-election.
   But the probe has not been scuttled, a Pentagon spokesman said
last week.
   Neither has it been finished.
   ``The study is still going on and the reason it's taking so long
is most of these black soldiers were with French units,'' Maj. Doug
Hart, a Defense Department spokesman, said in an interview.
   The French records of one World War I unit became available only
in February, Hart said. Military researchers are also looking at
World War II records of three black Navy seamen who received the
Distinguished Service Cross, he said.
   Hart said the investigations will probably be completed later
this summer.
   That pleases Leroy Ramsey, an Albany, N.Y., historian who six
years ago began a lonely quest to correct what he feels is a great
injustice.
   ``I'm kind of perturbed that it's taken so long but I am pleased
that the Pentagon agreed to give it a full review,'' Ramsey said in
an interview last week.
   A black World War II veteran himself, Ramsey was stunned to
discover while researching a book that not one of the 1.5 million
black Americans who served in the world wars received the nation's
highest military decoration for bravery.
   Blacks were excluded from U.S. combat units in both world wars.
But more than a few were cited for bravery, Ramsey learned upon
examining the records of servicemen awarded the Distinguished
Service Cross and the French Croix de Guerre.
   Ramsey then read the nation's more than 1,200 Medal of Honor
citations and concluded that at least one black World War I soldier
and one black World War II seaman had records strong enough to
warrant the highest honor.
   ``I didn't want this to be token because these guys were
black,'' Ramsey stressed.
   The two he selected were Army Sgt. Henry Johnson of Albany,
N.Y., and Seaman Dorrie Miller of Waco, Texas. Both are dead.
   By 1987, Ramsey had succeeded in interesting DioGuardi and
Leland in his cause. The two sponsored legislation to award
posthumous Medals of Honor to Johnson and Miller but the Pentagon
opposed the bill because it singled out two individuals.
   In October 1988, then Defense-Secretary Frank Carlucci announced
the Army would review the records of black World War I heroes and
said he would ask the Navy about the feasibility of doing the same
with blacks in World War II.
   Hart said the Pentagon is now looking at the records of Johnson
and all the men in his unit. Miller's record also is under review,
along with those of Seamen William Cook Pinckney and Leonard Roy
Harmon, Hart said.
   Johnson, who fought with the French army in World War I, killed
four German soldiers, rescued a wounded comrade and captured a
stockpile of weapons, all despite severe wounds. He was awarded the
Croix de Guerre, France's highest military honor, but was never
cited by the United States. He died in 1930.
   Miller was a mess steward on the USS West Virginia when it was
attacked at Pearl Harbor. While the battleship was being shelled,
he helped moved its wounded captain from the ship's bridge, then
returned to man a machine gun. Miller received a Distinguished
Service Cross and a warship was named for him in 1971. He was
killed in a torpedo attack in 1943.
   Harmon, of Texas, was a mess attendant aboard the USS San
Francisco during a battle with the Japanese near the Solomon
Islands in 1942. He deliberately exposed himself to hostile gunfire
in order to protect a wounded shipmate and was killed, according to
his citation.
   Pinckney, of South Carolina, was a cook on the USS Enterprise in
a battle with the Japanese near the Santa Cruz Islands in 1942.
During heavy bombing, Pinckney carried a comrade to safety before
pushing his way out of a burning compartment.

<TEXT>     In Fremont, at least 3,000 people waved American flags, gobbled up free hot
dogs and hamburgers and settled in for an afternoon of music on the shore of
Lake Elizabeth in Central Park, where Mayor Bill Ball set the theme.;    "This
is not a war issue . . . nor is it a peace issue. We're just saying thanks to
everyone," said Ball, a World War II veteran.;    Throughout the park,
veterans of each war -- decked out in their uniforms -- clustered and
exchanged stories as families frolicked.;    "You see the best of a community
when you have a gathering like this," Capt. Nate Smith of the USNS Mercy
hospital ship said as he gestured toward the young soldiers, Marines, airmen
and sailors hand-in-hand with girlfriends or moving through the crowd with
proud parents.;    Also mingling were aging veterans such as Harvey Foutes,
78, a World War II fighter in France and Germany. His most harrowing war
memory was of the 19 days he spent on a troop transport. "I was seasick for
seven days. I almost died." He was relieved, he said, to get onto solid
ground, bullets or no bullets.;    Some Vietnam veterans expressed wistfulness
at the festivities.;    Eddie Gallegos, a 45-year-old who fought in such
places as Pleiku, Bong Son and Landing Zone English, stood under a tree with
his family and said, "I think it's great they did this. Too bad they didn't do
it for us.";    Across the nation, patriotism reigned Saturday as tens of
thousands marked Armed Forces Day. In Southern California, an estimated
200,000 people cheered at the Operation Orange County Victory Parade outside
the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. About 50,000 people watched a Patriot
missile launcher and other military equipment in a parade at Fort Monmouth,
N.J.;    In San Francisco, protesters clashed with Persian Gulf war supporters
at a parade intended to bury the city's anti-war image. Along the
Presidio-to-Fort Mason route, at least eight people were arrested on
misdemeanor charges ranging from throwing things at police to climbing aboard
military vehicles.;    One of those arrested was Jeffrey A. Paterson, a former
Marine from Hollister who refused to go to the gulf with his unit and later
was discharged as a conscientious objector. He climbed atop an Army truck, and
the parade came to a halt as two police officers scrambled up to pull him
down.;    But most of the 2,200 marchers and 20,000 onlookers ignored the
scuffles during the two-hour parade, which featured bands, tanks and jeeps,
parachutists and camouflage-painted C-130 planes roaring overhead.;
Protests in Fremont were peaceful.;    Marine Cpl. Thomas Hughes, 22, who
spent seven months based at Al-Jubail in the Arabian desert with a cargo
helicopter crew, was strolling with his parents when an airplane hired by a
group called Tri-City Peace Action pulled a message through the sky: "DON'T
CELEBRATE GENOCIDE.";    Hughes shrugged his big shoulders. "It's their right
to do that. They just wasted a lot of money.";    Earlier in the day, about 20
members of the peace group gathered on Paseo Padre Parkway for a
demonstration. One placard read: "130,000 civilians dead. No reason to
celebrate.";    They left just as the celebration was getting started.;    "We
did not want a confrontation," the Rev. Bob Herhold said. "We just wanted to
make our statement and leave.";    Roger Kendall, chairman of the Central Park
USA celebration and a Vietnam-era veteran, said some of the veterans were
angry when they first spotted the protesters.;    "This is what we fought for
-- so they could do this," Kendall told them.;    The veterans' tempers cooled
and the spirit of the day prevailed. One promised, "If (the protesters) stick
around, we'll take them to dinner."  </TEXT>

   Two Japanese men who fought for their
country in World War II and then with Communist guerrillas for 45
years in the jungles of Malaysia returned to Japan today, saying
they had looked forward to coming home the entire time.
   Shigeyuki Hashimoto, 71, and Kiyoaki Tanaka, 77, were greeted by
a group of about 20 relatives and friends bearing flowers and candy
at Tokyo's airport. It was their first time home since they left in
1944 to work in a wartime Japanese iron factory in Malaysia.
   They later joined Japan's Imperial Army and then took up arms
with the Communist Party of Malaya, now called Malaysia, when Japan
surrendered at the end of World War II in 1945. They wanted to help
the country gain independence from Britain, Japan's former enemy.
   ``We're Japanese, so we never forgot about Japan, even for one
day,'' Tanaka told a crowd of about 70 reporters at the airport.
``We looked forward greatly to returning to Japan, but as Japanese
we couldn't leave behind the people we were fighting alongside for
all those years until this opportunity.''
   The two appeared on Wednesday in Hat Yai, a town in southern
Thailand near the jungled Malaysian border where they and their
comrades in the Communist insurgency had fought for 45 years. Six
weeks ago, the insurgency was disbanded.
   ``We fought for a long time,'' Hashimoto said. ``We lost touch
with all of our old friends. Now only the two of us are still
alive.''
   Several of their relatives, including Tanaka's 51-year-old
daughter, had earlier flown to Thailand to meet them, and
accompanied the men back to Japan.
   Doctors in Bangkok had pronounced the two in satisfactory
condition, but Hashimoto, who suffers from high blood pressure,
traveled from the plane in a wheelchair with a nurse at his side.
   In a weak voice, Hashimoto explained his years away from home to
reporters and photographers who jammed a small airport conference
room.
   In 1957, when Malaysia, then called Malaya, gained independence
from Britain, ``we could have returned to Japan but it would have
required our surrender to the Malaya government and we chose not to
do so,'' he said.
   They decided to fight until the insurgency was over. ``Last
year, a peace accord was reached and we became finally free so we
could come back to Japan,'' Hashimoto said in a barely audible
voice.
   His account was interrupted by doctors who cautioned him against
further efforts to speak.
   ``I never doubted he was still alive but I did not hear from him
or about him for nearly 50 years so of course I was worried,'' said
Hashimoto's sister, Kikuko Ishiwatari, 74.
   Hashimoto, from Kanagawa prefecture, near Tokyo, and Tanaka were
scheduled to undergo tests at a hospital in Tokyo before returning
home. Tanaka, whose wife is still alive, is from Kumamoto
prefecture in the south.
   While in the jungle, the two men reportedly learned of the
enormous changes in Japan since World War II from a shortwave radio.
   British Commonwealth forces fought bloody battles with the
Communist insurgents during what was known as the 1948-1960
``emergency.'' Fighting continued on a lesser scale, but
Thai-Malaysian military strikes and a Thai amnesty badly hurt the
guerrilla movement in more recent years.
   In December, leaders of the party and Thai and Malaysian
government officials agreed to end the insurgency.

<F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "Commander in Chief Clinton Comes </F>
to Europe To Celebrate All Victories at Once"]
  [Text] Washington -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has left
on a nine-day tour of Europe with one main objective -- to lead
the ceremonies in France. Allied troops landed here on the
shores of Normandy 50 years ago, 6 June 1944. The colorful and
costly celebrations for which people in the United States and
Europe have been preparing for a long time are designed to show
that it was this event, known here as D-Day, that brought the
decisive breakthrough in World War II.
  One cannot help hearing distinctly chauvinistic notes in the
long, triumphal precelebration campaign. I must warn you right
away that, if anyone imagines that the mass media are denying
the role of the Soviet Army or events on the Eastern Front, say,
or that the Americans are scornful of and deaf to the casualties
and devastation suffered by the USSR, that impression is
mistaken.
  When I talk about chauvinism I mean the strictly U.S. form,
whereby recognition of the merits of other participants in the
great war gets lost in a boundless sea of highly varied and
excellent material in all conceivable genres. You get the
feeling from this plethora of material of a U.S. triumph -- U.S.
above all -- over the German military machine, and persistent
parallels with the victorious battle in the desert against
Saddam Husayn, not entirely overshadowed by what are in this
case inappropriate memories of Vietnam, create a general picture
of the logic and inevitability of the last and only superpower's
victory in the Cold War as well.
  By no means everything that is being broadcast at the moment
will remain in the memory of the pragmatic Americans once the
celebrations are over. But no means everything will be
forgotten. The theatrical rerun of the allied landing in
Normandy (and a precise copy of it on the same day in the United
States, near Norfolk) will remain in the memory as virtually
documentary evidence of insuperable U.S. might.
  President Bill Clinton, who has already gotten weary of
defending himself against charges of wavering and inconsistency
in the world arena and reluctance to offer the world U.S.
leadership, will speak solemnly and at length about the heroic
deeds of "our fathers and grandfathers." But he will voice
another conviction (and this may not please some people in
Europe) -- that the era of U.S. paratroops deployed far from the
United States is gone forever and that, while the Americans are
not averse to leading the planet -- with advice, open trade, all
manner of exchanges -- they no longer have the forces and do not
expect to have the forces to carry out such landings.
  The return to power in a number of European countries of
those whom people in the United States consider neofascists
(Italy) or Communists (Hungary, Poland, Lithuania) compels the
President to speak with unprecedented delicacy both on the
problems arising from the victories 50 years ago and the triumph
in the Cold War. Another tricky element is that the U.S.
President, who under to the U.S. Constitution is supreme
commander in chief, once refused to serve in the Army on
ideological grounds.
  What is more, he was an active participant in the pacifist
movement during his education at Britain's Oxford University.
That is why Bill Clinton has not included a visit to Oxford in
his agenda and in the United States chose a slightly older
audience in order to ensure that the commander in chief's thanks
for their good service did not elicit undesirable comparisons.
  During a meeting with World War II veterans on the eve of
his
departure for Rome President Bill Clinton said that he had been
studying specially for several weeks the course of the combat
operations in Europe.
  One can say without stretching a point that the U.S.
President is a fairly rare exception among his people. The
overwhelming majority of the U.S. population are quite sincerely
unaware of what kind of war it was, who fought whom during it,
and, importantly, why.

   Anzio, Normandy, and Jimmy Doolittle's ``Thirty
Seconds Over Tokyo'' _ World War II terms that probably mean nothing
to many Americans _ were cited by President Reagan in a farewell
address that cautioned his countrymen against forgetting their
history.
   Reagan urged building patriotism through better knowledge of
history.
   ``If we forget what we did, we won't know who we are,'' he said
in his broadcast Wednesday night. ``I am warning of an eradication
of the American memory that could result ultimately in an erosion of
the American spirit.''
   He specifically mentioned ``why the pilgrims came'' to America
from Europe in the 17th century in quest of religious freedom, ``who
Jimmy Doolittle was, and what those 30 seconds over Tokyo meant,''
as well as the battle at Anzio, Italy, and the landing at Normandy,
France.
   Those examples of American derring-do and heroism may mean little
to the 69 percent of the American population born since the end of
World War II.
   The details:
   _``Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo'' _ An America demoralized by the
surprise and destructive Japanese attack on American forces at Pearl
Harbor, Hawaii, on Dec. 7, 1941, and the subsequent heavy losses to
the Japanese in the first months of the war was electrified by news
of the first U.S. bombing raid of Tokyo and other Japanese cities.
The country finally had something to cheer about.
   The daring raid occurred on April 18, 1942. Lt. Col. James
Doolittle led 16 B-25 ``Mitchell'' bombers. First word came from
Tokyo Radio, but confirmation came a month later from President
Franklin D. Roosevelt, who said the planes took off from
``Shangri-La'' _ a fictitious place _ but later it was disclosed
that they had taken off from the deck of an aircraft carrier, the
USS Hornet. The raid, in addition to bolstering American morale,
slowed the Japanese offensive.
   Later, Doolittle, a former stunt flyer, flight teacher and
aeronautics pioneer, was awarded the Medal of Honor. The term ``30
Seconds Over Tokyo'' was the title of a popular movie about the raid.
   _Anzio _ The Anzio beachhead, 33 miles south of Rome, saw some of
the bloodiest fighting of World War II and accounted for many of the
10,000 U.S. battle deaths in Italy the first half of 1944. Anzio was
a bloody way station on the road to Rome.
   _Normandy _ The site, on the Atlantic coast of France, of the
Allied invasion by land, sea and air of the European mainland which
started June 6, 1944. After bitter fighting, the Nazis retreated.
The landing began the climactic stage of the war on the West
European front, the drive from the Atlantic to the German homeland,
culminating in the Nazi surrender the following year.
   Reagan recalled that on the 40th anniversary of the Normandy
landings he read a letter from a young woman whose late father had
fought at Omaha Beach, a Normandy sector.
   The writer, Lisa Zanatta Henn, ``said, we will always remember,
we will never forget, what the boys of Normandy did,'' Reagan noted,
adding, ``Well, let's help her keep her word.''
   Reagan said Americans who are 35 and older ``grew up in a
different America'' where they learned to love and appreciate their
country either from school, their own family or ``from the
neighborhood, from the father down the street who fought in Korea or
the family who lost someone at Anzio.''

   Soviet armor rumbled through an Estonian hamlet in
a show of military force Thursday, causing postponement of a
veterans' reunion that included soldiers who fought in Nazi
brigades, Estonian media reported.
   Organizers postponed plans for a reunion in the central village
of Tori on Saturday and Sunday after a convoy of 28 Soviet armored
vehicles and 15 loaded troop trucks passed through, the Estonian
News Service said.
   ``Today they arrived in Tori and drove through the town fully
armed,'' the Baltic republic's official news agency said. ``The
Estonian government and the Ministry of Internal Affairs were not
informed about the movement of the troops.''
   ``The Estonian government strongly protests the actions taken by
the army, which can do nothing but exacerbate the already tense
situation, especially in situations such as this where the actions
are connected to political ambitions,'' it said.
   An official of the news service said that soldiers apparently
were in the town only briefly, and then left.
   The reunion planned by the Heritage Society, a group seeking to
promtoe awareness of Estonian history, was indefinitely postponed,
it added. Calls to the Heritage Society's chapter in Tori went
unanswered.
   The dispute highlighted the sensitivity of World War II
allegiances among the Baltic republic's citizens, an issue
underlying Estonia's independence drive.
   Soviet soldiers entered independent Estonia in 1940 under Adolf
Hitler's pact with Josef Stalin dividing Eastern Europe into
spheres of influence. Estonia and its Baltic neighbors Lithuania
and Latvia were absorbed into the Soviet Union.
   Heritage Society members issued an open invitation to soldiers
who fought for Estonian independence, and included those who served
in the German army in World War II, Estonian news reports and
Heritage Society officials said.
   The invitation also was extended to the handful of soldiers
still alive who fought both Germans and Russians to establish
Estonian independence in 1918, and partisans who fought a guerrilla
war against Soviet power.
   A leader of the Heritage Society, Argakas Kullo, said by
telephone from the Estonian capital of Tallinn that about 65,000 to
70,000 Estonians served in German military units during World War
II. He said most fled west with the German army when it retreated
in 1944.
   He said the society does not know how many former German army
soldiers might still be in the republic, or how many would have
attended the gathering.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the reunion was to have
included Estonians who served in Nazi Germany's 20th SS Division
and the Omakaitse punitive squad. It called plans for the gathering
an ``outrage.''
   The Estonian News Service quoted Col. Gen. Fyodor Kuzmin, the
Soviet military commander in the Baltics, as characterizing the
gathering as that of ``fascists'' and members of former SS
divisions. He called the meeting ``inadmissible.''
   The report quoted Estonian State Minister Raivo Vare as
responding that the government had taken steps to prevent trouble.
He also urged the military commanders to avoid interference that
would ``bring a senseless and dangerous aggravation of the
situation,'' the news service said.
   Kullo called the military move through the village of Tori a
``pure provocation'' by the Soviet military.
   The chapter in Tori, a village of about 500 people 75 miles from
Tallinn, organized the reunion months ago with the approval of the
Heritage Society's leaders, Kullo said in a telephone interview.
   Soviet media previously have criticized the Estonian Heritage
Society for what they claim are its fascist leanings.
   But Kullo said Soviet officials have it in for the Heritage
Society because it was one of the first Estonian organizations to
raise nationalist issues in the republic's drive for sovereignty.
   It predated the Estonian People's Front, which has led the drive
to restore the republic's independence, and first raised the issue
of restoring the flag of the independent Estonian republic, Kullo
said.
   Since Estonia restored its blue, black and white flag, many
other Soviet republics have resorted to flags they used before they
became part of the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   Not one Medal of Honor went to any of the 1.5
million blacks who fought in World Wars I and II, a fact historian
Leroy Ramsey wants to change.
   Ramsey has found the records of two black servicemen he says
deserve the medal: Sgt. Henry Johnson, of Albany, N.Y., and Seaman
Dorrie Miller of Waco, Texas. Johnson served in the Army during
World War I; Miller was in the Navy in the Second World War. Both
have since died.
   It was an accident that Ramsey, also of Albany, discovered no
blacks had won the nation's highest military honor for bravery
during the world wars, although blacks have won the medal for
heroic deeds in other wars. It was also a discovery born of anger.
   ``In 1984, I was watching television when they celebrated the
40th anniversary of D-Day in Europe,'' he said in a telephone
interview last week. ``The president was over there, and the whole
week was as white as a Ku Klux Klan rally.''
   A black World War II veteran himself, Ramsey got angry that his
experience of the war was not recognized, but turned that emotion
into a useful pursuit.
   ``I decided to do a book on the black American in World War II,
and when I got into my research I began to realize that no black
had received the Medal of Honor in either World War I or World War
II,'' said Ramsey, a former associate history professor at Hofstra
University on Long Island. ``So I put the book on the back burner
and took off on an effort to see if I could get that righted.''
   Ramsey looked at the records of black servicemen who had won
other high military honors, including the Distinguished Service
Cross and the French Croix de Guerre. He looked into the history of
the Navy's Medal of Honor, established by Congress in 1861, and the
Army's, established in 1862. And, he said, he read the more than
1,200 citations of the Medal of Honor since its inception, ``to
make sure I was on solid ground.''
   ``I didn't want this to be token because these guys were
black,'' he said. ``I didn't want any compromising of principle on
the Medal of Honor.''
   Ramsey discovered that Johnson, who fought with the French army,
killed four German soldiers, rescued a wounded comrade and captured
a stockpile of weapons all despite severe combat wounds. For his
actions, Johnson earned the Croix de Guerre, France's highest
military honor. He died in 1930.
   Miller served at Pearl Harbor aboard the USS West Virginia,
Ramsey said. When the Japanese attacked, Miller, a mess steward,
helped move his mortally wounded captain from the ship's bridge,
then returned to man a machine gun, according to Ramsey's research.
   Afterward, the secretary of the Navy awarded Miller a letter of
commendation, but Adm. Chester Nimitz, commander in Hawaii,
upgraded that to the Navy Cross, the second-highest award, Ramsey
said. Miller was killed in 1943 in a torpedo attack.
   Ramsey built up his case, but for two years, he couldn't get any
public official to listen. He sent copies of a 21-page letter to
every member of the New York and Texas congressional delegations,
but ``102 percent of those people ignored the hell out of me.''
   ``It would have been easier for me to get a Boy Scout merit
badge for a communist,'' he said.
   Finally, he received a letter of support from Rep. Mario Biaggi,
D-N.Y., but Biaggi became embroiled in criminal trials in New York
and Ramsey's cause languished until New York Gov. Mario Cuomo
decided it had merit.
   ``Cuomo wrote me a very long letter and he took the time to
personally write each member of the congressional delegation in
Washington and ask them to help me,'' Ramsey said.
   ``Then, as if a voice from the dark, Joe DioGuardi came through.
And the effort never stopped.''
   Last October, DioGuardi, a Republican congressman from
Westchester County, N.Y., and Rep. Mickey Leland, D-Texas,
cosponsored bills to waive the statute of limitations for the Medal
of Honor so both men can be considered for the award.
   In the cases of Miller and Johnson, both the Navy and Army have
opposed the bills, which are now before the House Armed Services
Committee, DioGuardi said.
   The Navy did not specify why, according to DioGuardi, but the
Army laid out several reasons in a letter to Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wisc., who is chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
   Delbert L. Spurlock, assistant secretary of the Army for
manpower and reserve affairs, wrote that while others, including
members of Congress, had written to the Army requesting special
consideration for Johnson, ``At this late date, it would be
inappropriate to single out former Sergeant Johnson for award of
the Medal of Honor and to provide preferential treatment to him
over the thousands of other black soldiers who served so bravely in
combat.''
   Spurlock also said that Johnson's records were destroyed in a
fire in 1973 at the Army's National Personnel Records Center,
although Ramsey said he obtained certified copies from archives in
New York state.
   DioGuardi said he would not give up the fight.

   The mournful sound of buglers playing taps and the cadence of
marchers in Memorial Day parades helped Americans remember those
who died fighting for their country, while beaches and parks were
packed with holiday revelers.
   A sea of fluttering American flags marked the 72,000 graves at
Willamette National Cemetery in Portland, Ore. Officials planned
ceremonies of remembrance today at Arlington National Cemetery in
Virginia and at the Vietnam Memorial in Washington.
   In Gettysburg, Pa., Gen. William Westmoreland, commander of U.S.
troops in Vietnam during the war, planned to speak after a parade
honoring soldiers who died in the Civil War battle 125 years ago
this summer.
   In Omaha, Neb., a brass band today planned to wend its way
through a pioneer cemetery to salute a 19th century madam called
``the hooker with a heart of gold.''
   And on Attu Island, Alaska, Americans and Japanese erected a
monument that was to be dedicated to the thousands of soldiers from
both sides of the Pacific who died there _ the site of the only
World War II battle fought on North American soil.
   A snowstorm in the Southwest stranded some campers in Cedar
Breaks National Monument in Utah and whipped up waves that sank an
unoccupied 60-foot houseboat on Lake Powell, authorities said.
   Temperatures in the 80s lured hundreds of thousands of
sunbathers to beaches from Massachusetts to South Carolina.
   ``It's like the people are saying, `Welcome to summer,''' said
police Sgt. William Selig of Rockport, Mass. ``It's like this until
the cold weather comes. In a few months we'll be looking forward to
fall.''
   In Ocean City, Md., a swimmer drowned in the ocean 90 minutes
before lifeguards went on duty Saturday for the first time in the
season, police said.
   An estimated 100,000 people headed to New York City beaches on
Sunday to enjoy sun and sand on the opening weekend of the summer
beach season.
   Lifeguards were on duty for the first time this year at the
city's Jones Beach State Park, but there wasn't much for them to do
because of the cold water.
   ``Most people are just sunbathing,'' said Joseph Lescinski, park
superintendent.
   About 10,000 people, mostly bikers, ended their two-day American
Motorcycle Jamboree on Sunday in Cobleskill, 30 miles west of
Albany, N.Y.
   ``I didn't see a single wheelie,'' Mayor Nicholas Iorio said.
   The pace was quicker in Indiana, where an estimated 350,000 to
450,000 people watched Sunday's 72nd running of the Indianapolis
500. About 100 people were arrested in prerace revelry, and one man
died after falling out of a pickup truck, police said.
   Rick Mears, 36, overcame an early one-lap deficit to win the
race for the third time in his career.
   The Prospect Hill Preservation Brass Band planned its
eighth-annual Memorial Day tribute to Anna Wilson, who ran Omaha's
highest-priced house of ill repute for 30 years before donating it
to the city as a hospital shortly before her death in 1911.
   In Menands, N.Y., a veterans group took time out from the
weekend sun and fun to honor President Chester A. Arthur, who is
buried in the Albany Rural Cemetery.
   ``Nobody else had opted in an official capacity to do anything
for this former president,'' said Martin O'Connell, organizer of
the memorial service for the nation's 21st president, who served
from 1881-1885. ``I think it's shameful that the federal government
should ignore the grave of a former commander-in-chief on Memorial
Day weekend.''
   In Hackensack, N.J., submarine veterans Sunday held their 15th
annual ceremony in memory of the 52 submarines lost in World War II
and peace time.
   A wreath was tossed into Boston Harbor from the 190-year-old USS
Constitution, the nation's oldest commissioned warship.
   And about 1,200 Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Brownies and Cub Scouts
placed flags on all 78,200 graves at Los Angeles National Cemetery.
   ``You can see all those who fought, but it's sad because they
all died,'' said 9-year-old Andrew Marek.

It's sad: Once soldiers side by side. Now veterans waring among themselves.
</P>
<P>
Who should be listed on a proposed L.A. monument to American soldiers of
Japanese ancestry? The question threatens a community project designed to honor
those who served in three segregated World War II units.
</P>
<P>
One group wants the privately funded monument in Little Tokyo to list the names
of all 12,000 members -- living and dead -- of the Army's all-Japanese-American
100th Battalion and 442nd Infantry Regimental Combat Team, which served in
Europe, and the Military Intelligence Service in the Pacific. An opposing group
wants to honor only the 700 killed during World War II, but to include the
names of 325 Japanese-Americans who died during the Spanish-American War, World
War I and the Korean and Vietnam conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The debate is muddling the intent of the monument: To make a special
acknowledgement of the blood, sweat and tears of those Japanese-American
soldiers who fought hard to prove their loyalty to the United States so their
families, unjustly interned in U.S. concentration camps during the war, would
be more readily accepted by other Americans.
</P>
<P>
They were tested as few others were. They deserve an enduring testimonial --
one designed with the names of all the Japanese-Americans who served in World
War II as the centerpiece of the monument. The design also could incorporate
secondarily the names of others who died in combat.
</P>
<P>
They don't deserve to be fought over like this.

FT  04 JUN 94 / A second D-Day invasion
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID BUCHAN

<TEXT>
Normandy is bracing itself for this weekend's commemorative assault, writes
David Buchan in Caen.
The combined force includes some 14 heads of state and governments, 40,000
D-Day veterans, 100,000 tourists and battalions of broadcasters and press.
To ensure it does not finish off in the next few days what Operation
Overlord began 50 years ago, France has just declared the remains of
Hitler's Atlantic Wall defences an historic monument.
But the region will take a pounding before the main commemoration ends on
Monday night in a peace extravaganza in Caen. US, British, Canadian and
French paratroops are to re-enact tomorrow their 'drops' on the western and
eastern edges of the invasion zone. Most will be serving troops. But the
landing may feel on the hard side for the 38 veterans of US 82nd Airborne
Division, aged between 68 and 83, who have persuaded reluctant French
authorities that they are fit enough to fall out of the sky over
Sainte-Mere-Eglise, just as they did 50 years ago.
On Monday, the five kings and queens, five presidents, four prime ministers
and one governor general will criss-cross the area in a complicated
quadrille of bilateral ceremonies. One, France's 76-year-old President
Francois Mitterrand, will have to be virtually everywhere as host, while all
will be at the 'international' ceremony on Monday afternoon at Omaha Beach,
the scene of the worst allied casualties on June 6, 1944 with the deaths of
3,000 Americans.
Absent, perforce, will be any official representatives of Germany, which
lost 58,000 men in the Battle of Normandy to the 37,000 allied dead, even
though there will be at least one small unofficial American-German ceremony
at the private initiative of veterans of both sides. But Mr Mitterrand has
invited German troops belonging to the Eurocorps, and Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, to attend France's Bastille day parade in Paris next month. Germany
will be present, too, at next May's ceremonies marking the end of the second
world war.
Meanwhile, however, this weekend's events will require considerably more
troops than the free French were able to muster for D-Day - 15,000 soldiers
to ensure the logistics, 7,000 gendarmes to guard the roads, and 4,000
police controlling crowds. 'It's a bit like organising a summit meeting in
the middle of the Olympic Games,' says Mr Roger Gros, the harassed prefet of
Lower Normandy, referring to the problem of trying to ensure the safety of
so many bigwigs among so many other people in such a large area.
But he will have, as the allies did half a century ago, the advantage of air
superiority. An air exclusion zone will prevent anything but VIP helicopters
from circulating over the Normandy coast.
Controlling the sea may be harder. In the royal yacht Britannia, Queen
Elizabeth is expected tomorrow to lead a small armada from Portsmouth, where
tonight she is to host a state dinner. Her Majesty should have no problem.
Pressure on her civil list is not such that Britannia has had to take on
cheap Chinese crew, which is the reason that French sailors gave for
preventing two P&amp;O ferries from docking at Cherbourg on Thursday.
The presence of 45 warships, as well as several thousand private boats, will
ease the hotel squeeze in Normandy. The Queen will stay on the Britannia
moored in the port of Caen, while President Bill Clinton will repair, aptly,
to the Dwight Eisenhower aircraft carrier.
Other dignitaries have had to settle for staying in Paris, so as not to
disrupt long-made hotel reservations by D-Day veterans. On Wednesday a Caen
tribunal ordered a local hotel to pay 50 British veterans from the Lancaster
Regiment FFr1,500 each in compensation for cancelling their bookings.
In general, the welcome has been warm - and commercial. All sorts of
souvenirs for D-Day, or Jour-J as it is known in French, are on sale,
including Bordeaux and Beaujolais under the 'Debarquement 44' label.
Luckily, it is not actually that vintage, which would not have aged as well
as the veterans.

@  Ariel Sharon: An Israeli General's Own Story
@  ----
@  By George Melloan </HL>
<DD> 09/07/89 </DD>
<SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J) </SO>
<TEXT>
   Ariel Sharon's autobiography, "Warrior" (Simon &amp; Schuster, 571 pages, $24.95), summons up vivid memories.
In June 1967, with Egyptian tanks pouring into the Sinai and Jordan and Syria mobilizing forces along Israel's borders, I was camped with other correspondents at the Tel Aviv Hilton.
A Danish TV newscaster, feeling the pressure, issued a lament that echoed down the hall: "What's going to happen to this poor little country?"

   What happened, of course, is history.
The Israeli Defense Forces defeated the combined armies of five Arab nations in six days.
In the 19 years since Israel's war of independence, the IDF had become a formidable fighting force, likely the best, man for man, in the world.

   Ariel Sharon deserved much of the credit.
He had trained the paratroops and tankers.
He conducted a decisive battle, routing the Egyptian forces at Abu Agheila to open the way for the Israeli dash to the East Bank of the Suez Canal.

   Mr. Sharon's book, written with David Chanoff, has three levels, military, political and personal.
Soldiers and military historians will learn much from his accounts of battle management.
Describing the Abu Agheila clash, Mr. Sharon tells of his comrade Avraham Yoffe sending a tank brigade between dueling Egyptian and Sharon tanks, emerging unscathed to forge deeper into the Sinai interior.

   Mr. Sharon denies that he was the "king of improvization."
He believed in meticulous planning, but he planned battles in such a way as to create the unexpected, believing that the Arabs, while brave, often could not cope effectively with surprises.
He told his troops that they would never be left behind on a battlefield, even if recovering Israeli wounded or dead meant further casualties.
The confidence and solidarity this engendered more than offset the risks, he believed.

   He drilled his officers constantly on the importance of knowing the terrain intimately to gain tactical advantage, especially during night fights.
His explorations of the Sinai during the 1956 effort to block Gamal Abdel Nasser's takeover of the Strait of Tiran and the Suez Canal stood him in good stead in the Six-Day and Yom Kippur wars.
Interestingly, he makes little mention of how that 1956 effort, made jointly with the British and French, was undermined by U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles.
Some historians rank this as one of the greatest postwar U.S. foreign policy blunders.

   Mr. Sharon's maverick image originated with the 1956 campaign.
Ordered, mysteriously, to stay out of the strategic Mitla Pass, he requested permission to recover his wounded.
But in doing that he also seized the pass, opening the way to the Western Sinai.

   IDF commanders were as combative in strategy sessions as with the enemy, and Mr. Sharon was usually in the thick of the fights.
Yet in the 1973 Yom Kippur war, he clearly saved Israel from a major defeat by demanding from a reluctant and confused high command permission to strike across the Suez Canal at Anwar Sadat's Soviet-supplied anti-aircraft (SAM) batteries, which were keeping the Israeli air force at bay.
Later, the IDF changed its war doctrine to allow a field commander, subject to later court martial review, to disobey the orders of officers in the rear if it was clear they had no grasp of the tactical situation.

   "Warrior" draws much of its richness from Mr. Sharon's gentler side, however.
He gives a vivid account of a tour through Africa in 1964 with Mr. Yoffe and their discovery of a Jewish tribe in the wilds of Gondar, high on the Ethiopian escarpment.
These Jews had been cut off from mainstream Judaism for millenia, "yet still they nurtured their racial memories and they treasured their connection."

   After Camp David, Mr. Sharon entertained at his farm the Egyptian officers he had fought against in the Yom Kippur war.
"I had never seen their faces before, but their voices were all familiar.
In 1973, I had listened to them on the radio net."

   Mr. Sharon's personal tragedies have a Biblical quality.
His young wife, Gali, was killed in an auto crash, leaving him with their five-year-old son, Gur.
Later, Gur was killed by a playmate's accidental discharge of an antique shotgun.
In the Yom Kippur war, Mr. Sharon saw many of his dearest comrades fall in battle, which no doubt contributed to his bitterness about the conduct of that war.
Later, Mr. Sharon married Gali's sister, Lily, and they have two sons, Gilad and Omri.

   Mr. Sharon's individualism no doubt owes much to his parents.
His father, Samuil, and his mother, Vera, fled to Israel from Tiflis in 1921 to escape the Red Army, which had no love for Zionists.
Vera was never a very strong Zionist, and Samuil was not a socialist, which often put them at odds with the other residents of Kfar Malal, their "moshav," or farm cooperative, on the Plain of Sharon.
When young "Arik" was growing up, Jews and Arabs rubbed shoulders daily in Palestine.
That changed when refugees from the Holocaust began clamoring for admission against Arab resistance and British temporizing.
Further exacerbating the tensions, the Soviets began to promote Arab socialism, fomenting hatred of Jews as a unifying theme.
The Soviets have sponsored almost every major assault on Israel and have not given up their Mideast designs.

   Which brings us to today's Ariel Sharon, who as a leader of the conservative Likud government coalition is a major factor in Israeli politics.
As minister of defense in 1982, Mr. Sharon launched an offensive against the Soviet-equipped PLO army in Lebanon in response to shellings of Israel's northern villages.
As usual, the offensive was a military success.
It resulted in the expulsion of a part of the PLO force from Lebanon and blocked off Syrian intervention.

   But it also brought Mr. Sharon a major political setback.
Christian forces, entering the West Beirut neighborhoods of Sabra and Shatilla to try to rout out PLO fighters, massacred Moslem non-combatants.
Mr. Sharon was accused of instigating the massacre as a reprisal for the murder of Lebanese president Bashir Gemayel, who had become Mr. Sharon's friend.

   An inquiry commission absolved Mr. Sharon of that charge, although holding him "indirectly" responsible.
He later won a "blood libel" action against Time magazine for its claim of a "secret appendix" to the commission report alleging Sharon complicity.
But the Israeli left used the Sabra-Shatilla affair as a cue for attacking the Menachem Begin government, and the hue and cry was picked up by leftists internationally.
Mr. Begin asked Mr. Sharon to resign as minister of defense, although he continued in the government as a minister without portfolio.

   Mr. Sharon is seldom critical of the U.S., a country he much admires despite the State Department's often-inept Mideast interventions.
But he clearly is bitter about the bloodshed that has wracked Lebanon since the U.S. and his enemies, in effect, took matters out of his hands.

   Which brings me another memory of 1967, giving three Israeli soldiers a lift in my rented car on the road to Jerusalem in the last stages of the Six-Day War.
"Are you going to give back the land you conquered?"
I asked.
They looked at me mystified.
Of course not.

   Israel did give back some land to Egypt in exchange for peace.
But Mr. Sharon cites a maxim he told his soldiers: "To get the wagon up the hill, first you have to find a stone to put under the wheel.
First is the stone.
We should be secure, first of all, to enable normal life.
Then we have to deal with all the rest."

   "Warrior" will open new and rancorous debates in Israel's tempestuous politics.
But the book may serve Mr. Sharon's political goals nonetheless by reminding Israelis how often, over 41 years, they have needed that stone.

<TEXT>     In Fremont, at least 3,000 people waved American flags, gobbled up free hot
dogs and hamburgers and settled in for an afternoon of music on the shores of
Lake Elizabeth in Central Park, where Mayor Bill Ball set the theme.;    "This
is not a war issue . . . nor is it a peace issue. We're just saying thanks to
everyone," said Ball, a World War II vet.;    In San Francisco, protesters
clashed with Persian Gulf war supporters at a parade intended to bury the
city's anti-war image. Along the Presidio-to-Fort Mason route, at least eight
people were arrested on misdemeanor charges ranging from throwing things at
police to climbing aboard military vehicles.;    One of those arrested was
Jeffrey A. Paterson, a former Marine from Hollister who refused to go to the
gulf with his unit and later was discharged as a conscientious objector. He
climbed atop an Army truck, and the parade came to a halt as two police
officers scrambled up to pull him down.;    But most of the 2,200 marchers and
20,000 onlookers ignored the scuffles during the two-hour parade, which
featured bands, tanks and jeeps, parachutists and camouflage-painted C-130
planes roaring overhead.;    In Fremont, veterans of each war -- decked out in
their uniforms -- clustered and exchanged stories as families frolicked.;
"You see the best of a community when you have a gathering like this," Capt.
Nate Smith of the USNS Mercy hospital ship said as he gestured toward the
young veterans walking hand-in-hand with loved ones or moving through the
crowd with proud parents.;    Also mingling were aging veterans like Harvey
Foutes, 78, a World War II fighter in France and Germany. His most harrowing
war memory was of the 19 days he spent on a troop transport. "I was seasick
for seven days. I almost died." He was relieved, he said, to get onto solid
ground, bullets or no bullets.;    Some Vietnam vets expressed wistfulness at
the festivities.;    Eddie Gallegos, a 45-year-old who fought in such places
as Pleiku, Bong Son and Landing Zone English, stood under a tree with his
family and said, "I think it's great they did this. Too bad they didn't do it
for us.";    Protests in Fremont were peaceful.;    Marine Cpl. Thomas Hughes,
22, who spent seven months based at Jubail in the Arabian desert with a cargo
helicopter crew, was strolling with his parents when an airplane hired by a
group called Tri-City Peace Action pulled a message through the sky: "DON'T
CELEBRATE GENOCIDE.";    Hughes shrugged his big shoulders. "It's their right
to do that. They just wasted a lot of money.";    Earlier in the day, about 20
members of the peace group gathered on Paseo Padre Parkway for a
demonstration. One placard read: "130,000 civilians dead. No reason to
celebrate.";    They left just as the celebration was getting started.;    "We
did not want a confrontation," the Rev. Bob Herhold said. "We just wanted to
make our statement and leave.";    Roger Kendall, chairman of the Central Park
USA celebration and a Vietnam-era vet, said some of the veterans were angry
when they first spotted the protesters.;    "This is what we fought for -- so
they could do this," Kendall told them.  </TEXT>

FT  26 JUL 94 / Israeli warriors to fore at summit
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Veteran soldiers of wars against Jordan, relatives of the war dead, and the
few Israelis with any links to Jordan largely made up the delegation Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, brought to Washington for yesterday's
historic summit.
At a time of peace, the emphasis on battlefield losses may seem strange. Yet
it is a peculiar tradition of Mr Rabin's to emphasise throughout the Middle
East peace process the memory of Israel's sons who sacrificed their lives to
defend the existence of the Jewish state in the face of Arab aggression.
Mr Rabin, as chief of army staff, was responsible for the Israeli victory in
the 1967 Six Day War and the occupation of Arab lands. The warrior turned
peacemaker never completely shed his professional soldier personality, and
feels much more comfortable surrounded by military men.
Among the delegation are reserve Maj Gen Dani Matt, who was a commander in
the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and was taken prisoner by Jordan in the bloody
battles at Gush Etzion and paraded through the streets of Jericho on his way
to Amman; Dr Sharon Regev, the eldest son of Colonel Arik Regev who was
killed in 1968 during operations in the Jordan Valley against Palestinian
guerrillas infiltrating into Israel from Jordan; and Shimon Kahaner, one of
the paratroopers who fought successfully in 1967 to capture the old city of
Jerusalem from Jordan.
Mr Rabin also invited the few Israelis who were involved in early political
talks with Jordan including Mr Avraham Deskel, the 89-year-old director of a
power station. Mr Deskel knew King Abdallah, the grandfather of King Hussein
who was assassinated in Jerusalem in 1952 by extremists opposed to his peace
overtures towards Israel.
Mr Rabin's preference for soldiers and relatives is at the expense of
Israeli politicians. Mr Shimon Peres, the foreign minister who has done so
much to make the Middle East peace process a success, was only invited by Mr
Rabin to attend the summit at the last minute, reflecting a decades old
personality and power conflict between the two men.

<TEXT>     In the streets, people cried. In offices, grim eyes were keyed to
newscasts. In stores, malls and airports, word spread quickly.;    Thousands
went to protest. Many rushed home. Others joined lines to gas up their tanks.
Plenty went to pray. And a few knocked down stiff drinks.;    But perhaps the
most telling sign came from a man walking the wrong way into oncoming traffic
on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley. He carried a yellow poster with an ominous,
hand-lettered message:;    "The war has started.";    The shock was evident.;
  In NewPark Mall in Newark, shoppers stopped in their tracks.;    "Here I am
in a mall running an errand and somebody is getting killed," said Sandy Ayala
of Union City, who heard the news from a large-screen television at McDuff
Electronics.;    Around the bay, children learned of war for the first time in
their lives.;    Nine-year-old John England of Palo Alto was sitting at home,
playing Nintendo and watching cartoons when his mother, Connie Cassinerio,
came home to tell him the news.;    "I thought we were going to have peace,"
John said. "But I guess I was wrong. . . . Some day I'll tell my kids that
this is the day war broke out in Kuwait.";    And at Berkeley's Temple Beth
El, cantor Brian Reich was teaching a bat mitzvah student when he heard the
news.;    "I had a 12-year-old student who said this is her first war," he
said. "I got really shook up because I hoped it would be this generation of
children who would be spared the tremendous bloodshed of war.";    On local
college campuses, there was disbelief.;    Weeping, praying;  Marlene Moyer, a
freshman at Santa Clara University, tearfully knelt in prayer in the
candle-lighted campus mission.;    "I kept saying the 'Our Father' over and
over again," Moyer said. "I let my thoughts go for all the innocent people in
Baghdad being killed.";    Outside the federal courthouse in San Jose,
25-year-old Renee Eppard heard the news on the radio as she knelt on the
sidewalk and peeled vegetables for stew. She was planning to cook dinner on a
green camp stove -- for herself and about a dozen other anti-war protesters
who have maintained an around-the-clock vigil.;    Nearby, a young man named
Tom fought back tears as he heard the first reports of war. He hugged the man
next to him; both began crying.;    In almost every corner of the Bay Area,
there was spontaneous debate: A thumbs up in some circles, a defiant "no" in
others.;    Veterans back U.S. action;  A group of veterans in Fremont quietly
watched the president speak on a small black-and-white television in the
Veterans Memorial Building. Sentiment was strongly behind the U.S.-led
attack.;    "About time they did it," said Bob Bravo of Fremont, a Korean War
veteran.;    Throughout the building, veterans described Saddam Hussein as a
dictator and a madman -- a ruler comparable to Hitler, Napoleon, Tojo and
Mussolini.;    "Right now he's a little weed, but next year he'll be a great
big tree to chop down," said World War II veteran Clarence Furtado.;    In the
Santa Clara American Legion Hall, retired airman Carl Hoiem was cleaning up
the bar at 7 p.m., closing time.;    Television reports were flashing over the
bar and Hoiem, who served off and on from World War II to 1968, let out a
sigh: "He's probably in a bunker somewhere," saying of Saddam. "I hope a bomb
got lucky.";    Among other Bay Area veterans, there was disgust.;    Thoughts
of babies killed;  "The first thing I thought of were all the little babies
being killed," said De Anza instructor Charley Trujillo, an infantry sergeant
during the Vietnam War who came back with a Purple Heart, a Bronze Star and
deep doubts about his country's role there. "A lot of people look at this like
a sporting event. . . . I think they're going to find it's not that easy, as
we found in Vietnam.";    Fifteen minutes after word of war came in, Vietnam
veteran Doug Elfving  said he could barely stand up.;    "I'm almost
physically sick," said the organizer of the Berkeley-based peace group United
Bay Area Veterans.;    Within minutes of the bombing, lives already were
changing.;    Work comes to a halt;  Official work came to a standstill.
Bosses, secretaries and clerks became messengers of battle. At the Hall of
Justice in San Jose, half a dozen deputies were crowded around a circular
desk, listening to a radio. As attorneys filed out of elevators, Deputy Linda
Clark broke the bad news: "We are at war.";    Silicon Valley computer links
crackled. On-line bulletins were being entered so fast at one Sausalito-based
service that operators warned users the system might be paralyzed.;    "I'm
really scared for everybody," a 15-year-old girl messaged on one service.;
At another, the family of a Navy helicopter pilot stationed on a ship in the
Persian Gulf sent a message asking for support.;    At gas pumps, motorists
braced for the effects of war. Lines formed within hours as motorists stopped
on their way home from work to fill up before an anticipated price increase.;
  Price of oil surges $8;  Within an hour after the first bombs were dropped
on Baghdad, the price of oil had jumped $8 to $40 a barrel on commodity
exchanges. By then, cars already were backed up at one Cupertino station.;
"It was packed. It was into the street right after war broke out," said Mike
Muaddi, a cashier who was called in to the BP station at Wolfe and Homestead
roads to handle the rush.;    By nightfall, people were looking to escape.
Some went to the movies. Others went bowling. Many sought refuge in the
ordinary.;    "When I heard the news, I just wanted to get home," said Roger
Ingells, 38, a computer technician from Santa Cruz who left work 45 minutes
early. "I know my family's in no danger, but that just seemed the place to be
at a time like this."  </TEXT>

   Former paratrooper Chuck Beckman watched and
remembered Saturday as a group of modern Army Airborne troops
marched past him in combat dress, their backs straight, jaws out
and berets cocked just so.
   ``We were tough,'' he said, ``but I don't know if we were that
tough.''
   Beckman, from Southern Pines, N.C., was one of several thousand
former paratroopers who gathered in Washington over the weekend and
held a parade Saturday to mark the 50th anniversary of America's
Airborne military.
   Former paratroopers from World War II, like Beckman, as well as
those from the Korean and Vietnam wars, and the periods in between
and since, also took part.
   Some marched, and others chose to watch. Alex Madsen, 69, of
Solvang, Calif., watched from a park bench with a friend from the
old days, H.G. Bennett, 73, of Sun City, Ariz.
   ``You know, we've spent a lot of money just to come to a bull
session,'' Madsen joked.
   Both were members of the Army's 507th Airborne Regiment,
headquarters company, and both parachuted into Normandy on D-Day,
1944. They also parachuted at the Rhine crossing in 1945, and
Madsen wore his paratrooper's wings bearing a pair of stars, one
for each combat drop.
   There were veterans from all periods, but the World War II
crowd, the original paratroopers, were most in evidence. They
marched together with what was left of their old regiments.
   The brass also was there. Retired Gen. William C. Westmoreland,
who was U.S. military commander in Vietnam from 1964 to 1968,
received the marching men's salutes at a reviewing stand.
   Only 13 gray-haired men marched with the original 501st
parachute batallion, which was formed in 1940. In other groups,
some rode in wheelchairs or walked on crutches, and some wore what
they could of their old uniforms.
   ``It's air conditioned,'' one marching veteran said to the
crowd, tugging at the jacket that no longer met in the middle.
   The all-black 555th Battalion also marched.
   Charles McCloed, 63, of Philadelphia, became a member of the
555th in 1946, volunteering after a year in Germany with Army
intelligence. He served until 1950, and recalled when the order to
integrate came in 1948. The battalion was made a part of another
unit.
   ``It was just on paper,'' he said. ``We stayed in the same
place, at Fort Bragg. We just changed the patches on our
shoulders.''
   Paratroopers have always been a close-knit group, in a way that
transcended boundaries of race or rank, he said. ``I don't care
whether it's a general or a private, today we all just say, `How
you doing, trooper,''' McCloed said.
   There were old Jeeps, trucks, even a restored staff car _ all
privately owned.
   Tony Lambros, a Vietnam veteran from Fallston, Md., drove a Jeep
nearly as storied as the old veterans he carried in it. The Jeep
landed in the invasion in 1944 and carries documentation of its
stops through Belgium and France, where it stayed until it was sold
as salvage more than 15 years after the war, he said.
   The world they fought in has been changing rapidly, these
veterans of the war in Europe acknowledged. But there were few
regrets or sounds of alarm about the unification of Germany or the
easing of East-West tensions.
   ``I welcome it,'' Madsen said. ``Let's hope that the day will
come when it's no longer necessary to have such a vast amount of
money tied up in the military.''

   Your March 5 page-one article on military bands in the
Gulf was fun; it was good that none of the musicians wound up
with holes in either their instruments or themselves. It
wasn't always that way, however, and I know of at least one
band unit in World War II that wasn't nearly as lucky.
   When I was sent as an 18-year-old replacement in 1946 to
the 245th Army Ground Forces Band, then stationed in Rome,
two "old-timers" were still assigned to it: Mr. Frost, the
warrant officer in charge, and Mickey DeCeasre, master
sergeant. They knew what had happened to the band, and told
us replacements about it. Until it had been dropped off as
the post band after Rome was taken, the 245th had been part
of the 36th Infantry Division, a Texas National Guard outfit
and a terrific fighting unit. The 36th had been in battles in
North Africa, Sicily and other parts of Italy, including the
landings at Salerno and Anzio, and had fought at Cassino, San
Pietro, the Volturno and Rapido, etc.

   We were told that when the division was in action, the
band fought as a machinegun platoon, had had a 300% turnover
during the period, and that, of the original unit, "the drum
section was buried at Salerno, the brasses were buried at
Anzio, and the rest of the band was buried at Cassino." Early
in 1947, when the 88th Infantry Division might have needed
reinforcements for their near-daily fire fights with the
Yugoslavs in the Trieste area, the only combat units
immediately available in Italy were three bands, stationed in
Caserta, Rome and Livorno. We were alerted, although the
situation quieted down and we were not sent north. In any
event, my guess is that if the Gulf War had turned into a
long, bruising campaign, today's bands would have exchanged
their instruments for weapons, as did a lot of their
predecessors.

   Your article brought back memories.
   My aunt, Ray Cowen Sawyer, was a Marine in World War I --
one of the first 50 women Marines in our history, I am told.
She was assigned to collect sheet music for all of our
military bands, and we have a treasured letter from Gen.
Pershing thanking her for the good job she did.
   The Marines never forget: When my aunt died, they sent an
honor guard to her funeral.
