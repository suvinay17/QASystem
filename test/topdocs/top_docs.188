   It should be spectacular.

   Next Thursday, if plans work out, the space shuttle Discovery will roar from its launch pad as a million spectators cheer its rise into orbit.
The future of the U.S. space program rides on the flight.

   It is the first attempt to put Americans into space in the nearly three years since a shuttle explosion here killed seven astronauts, including a young teacher.
Discovery "will restore NASA as an agency that sails on the ocean of space," says Thomas Paine, once head of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

   But another tragedy would doom U.S. manned space exploration.
Even a triumphal mission won't resolve fundamental problems dogging the shuttle program.

   NASA dreams of exploring the solar system by sending shuttle astronauts to launch giant telescopes, construct a manned space station and fetch satellites.
But military and scientific critics complain that the shuttle is too expensive, too fragile and too unreliable for such missions.
They want to turn to unmanned spacecraft instead.
Even some of NASA's biggest supporters want to reduce shuttle launches to lessen the risk of another crash.

   "The nub of the debate is: What do you do with humans in space?" says Richard DalBello, a space analyst for the Office of Technology Assessment, a research arm of Congress.
"You don't need the shuttle if manned space isn't important."

   The shuttle's great sophistication -- Russian cosmonauts thud to Earth in charred capsules, while shuttle astronauts glide down in airliner style -- also works against it.
The shuttle performs more like a costly Indy 500 race car than the cheap, reliable cargo truck NASA once promised.

   At a time of huge budget deficits, shuttle costs keep rising.
In the early 1970s, NASA talked about launching a shuttle a week for about $10 million a launch.
Now it wants to send up one a month for maybe $300 million a launch.
Shuttle travel is so pricey that even an alchemist who could magically turn a cargo of lead into gold in space might lose money, says William Michael, a space expert at the National Academy of Sciences.

   "The shuttle was clearly a mistake," grumbles Sen. William Proxmire, the Wisconsin Democrat who heads the subcommittee that handles NASA's budget.

   The spacecraft's complexity raises safety questions.
A tiny flaw can send complex shuttle machinery hurtling toward disaster.
Joseph Lombardo, director of the orbiter's main engines, worries that a small heating-coil leak could shut down the engine or blow it up.
In the past year, he says, NASA found two heating-coil leaks during tests, although neither proved disastrous.
NASA Administrator James Fletcher frets about the redesigned booster.
"It's a more complicated beast than we thought it was," he says.

   There is reason for concern.
Already, Discovery's boosters are outfitted with only half the test instruments originally planned because NASA rushed to meet an early launch date, says Myron Uman, director of the National Research Council panel overseeing the booster redesign.
NASA will drop most of those sensors after flight three, instead of flight six, he adds, because of budget problems.
If NASA successfully launches a few shuttles, pressure will increase to quicken the pace -- and to slide a bit on safety.

   NASA must become enormously more efficient, or cut safety margins, or give up on meeting its schedule.
In 1985, the year before the Challenger disaster, NASA managed nine shuttle flights by working shuttle crews at the Kennedy Space Center to exhaustion and by recklessly cannibalizing spare parts from sitting shuttles.
Now it takes three times as long as it once did to assemble shuttle boosters and refurbish the orbiter.
But NASA still hopes to launch seven flights next year, 10 the year after that and, eventually, 14.

   NASA managers swear they have learned the lessons of the Challenger disaster and won't scrimp on safety.
Hot gases escaping from a faulty solid-rocket booster seal destroyed the shuttle in January 1986.
Since then, the agency has redesigned about 500 parts in the orbiter, booster and external fuel tank that constitute the shuttle, and tested the changes thoroughly.
NASA even riddled one booster with holes during a test firing to make sure it didn't blow up when damaged.

   A successful launch will revive flagging interest in manned space exploration, the space agency hopes.
"The public looks at the shuttle as the main event," asserts NASA's Mr. Fletcher.
"They're interested in seeing people in space, not robots."

   Initially, NASA will be content if it can launch its shuttle backlog of Pentagon spy satellites, unmanned planetary spacecraft and occasional commercial satellites without a glitch.
But the agency also wants to spend $1.2 billion for a new generation of rocket boosters and about the same to build an unmanned shuttle that can lift three times the load of the current model.

   With these improvements, NASA figures it can more easily construct a permanently manned space station and, from there, head out to the moon and Mars.

   "NASA will lead the world into a high-tech era of space exploration," predicts Mr. Paine, the former NASA chief who has mapped out a plan for colonizing Mars.

   But some of NASA's most important customers say they don't need a manned space shuttle to work in space, raising the question of exactly what NASA should use the shuttle for.
After the Challenger disaster, President Reagan banned the shuttle from carrying communications satellites, hoping to spur the growth of privately owned rocket companies.

   Now the Air Force, spooked by NASA's earlier attempts to grab all military payloads for the shuttle, wants to eliminate as many shuttle flights as it can.
It is spending lavishly to build a new fleet of unmanned rockets and has indefinitely "mothballed" a shuttle launch site it spent $3.5 billion to build at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

   Space scientists want to be next to dump the shuttle in favor of unmanned launchers.
Mr. Fletcher, NASA's chief, concedes that the shuttle has been a disaster for planetary probes because it isn't dependable enough to launch during the brief time periods -- sometimes only a week -- when the planets are properly aligned.
An unmanned mission to Jupiter, named Galileo, is 10 years late and $1 billion over cost because of missed launch dates and other shuttle problems.

   NASA once planned to equip planetary probes with powerful rockets for interplanetary travel, but after the Challenger disaster NASA discarded the rockets as too dangerous to fly on the shuttle.
Galileo's replacement rockets are so underpowered that the Jupiter spacecraft must travel first to Venus and then back to Earth before it can pick up speed to head to Jupiter -- adding four years to the journey.

   John Bahcall, an astrophysicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., argues that the shuttle also will cripple NASA's plans to launch four big telescopes, called "The Great Observatories," to plot the birth and evolution of the universe.
The first observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope, is already six years late because of shuttle delays.
The other three face similar delays unless they fly on unmanned rockets, he says.
"The shuttle has set back space science in the U.S. by at least a decade," he complains.

   Mr. Fletcher disagrees.
He says the shuttle will be able to rescue the space telescopes should they run into trouble.
NASA also plans to send shuttle astronauts to replace aging telescope parts with advanced instruments.

   "You can use the shuttle to maintain {the telescopes} for decades, and even improve the electronics," adds Lennard Fisk, head of NASA's space science division.

   The future of the shuttle is tied tightly to whether NASA finds the money to start projects to colonize the moon or Mars, or whether it is forced to settle largely for unmanned ventures.
That is a choice NASA has tried to avoid since the moon landings because it fears its budget and its public support will shrivel without astronaut heroics.
"NASA has no incentive for soul-searching," says Walter McDougall, a Pulitzer Prize-winning space historian.

   Just how the presidential election will affect the shuttle program isn't clear.
Neither of the candidates says what he will do with the shuttle.
The program's $3.5 billion-a-year budget will make any efforts to reduce the deficit more difficult, especially when combined with NASA's plans to build a space station.

   NASA plans to ask for $7.6 billion for the space station over the next three years as part of a project costing up to $30 billion.
NASA plans as many as 20 shuttle launches in the mid-1990s to haul up space station parts and bolt them together.
So if the president or Congress should decide to scale back the station to reduce the huge deficit, the need for the shuttle would drop.

   Even some NASA supporters urge the space agency to reduce shuttle flights because a fatal accident anytime soon could doom manned exploration.
Byron Leonard, an aerospace risk-assessment consultant in El Segundo, Calif., says that NASA should cut its planned flights from 14 a year to seven to stretch out the probable time between crashes.
Mr. Leonard estimates that the shuttle has about a 2% to 3% chance of a major failure in flight, but says it is impossible to predict the disasters.

   Other NASA boosters say the agency should enhance the shuttle's scientific value rather than promoting it as a cargo vehicle.
During the Discovery mission, for instance, the shuttle's five astronauts will concentrate on releasing a NASA communications satellite -- something unmanned rockets have mastered for 25 years.

   But the Discovery astronauts will also try to grow protein samples used in AIDS and cancer research that are difficult to make on earth, but which may blossom under near-weightless conditions.
"There's a whole host of biological problems that we're approaching with this flight," says Larry DeLucas, a University of Alabama molecular biologist.

   Future shuttle missions could boost scientific research even more.
Spacehab Inc., of Washington, D.C., plans to outfit shuttle missions with a lab deck that would increase the number of experiments astronauts could run on the shuttle to 23 from about three.
External Tanks Corp. in Boulder, Colo., proposes packing the shuttle's external fuel tank with instruments so it can take atmospheric measurements when it is jettisoned to earth.

   Louis Frank, a University of Iowa physicist, sketches even bolder experiments.
The shuttle could launch a small scientific satellite and circle around it while zapping it with radio waves, ion beams and electrons to measure the upper atmosphere and predict how satellite communications may be affected by turbulence.

   Shuttles could also be modified so astronauts could spend 30 days in orbit, rather than 10, making them guinea pigs for scientists studying the effects of weightlessness.
The shuttles then could spend weeks visiting smaller, cheaper space stations that could be built for, say, producing materials.
"It would be like a lighthouse tender visiting an automated lighthouse" for servicing, says Mr. Paine, the former NASA administrator.

   While these missions wouldn't be as dramatic as manned journeys through the solar system, they could make sensible use of the shuttle while the U.S. decides whether it wants to commit to more grandiose goals.
Even some of NASA's sternest critics admit they would like to get to Mars.
"It would be fabulous," says Mr. Bahcall, the astrophysicist.
"It would be like building the pyramids -- something to remember."

   The space shuttle Discovery cleared one of its final hurdles as the space agency successfully test fired a solid-rocket booster with flaws intentionally drilled into it.

   "The hardware and data tell us this booster is ready to fly," said Royce Mitchell, manager of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's solid-rocket booster program.

   The space shuttle Challenger exploded Jan. 28, 1986, when hot gasses escaped from a tiny gap in a faulty booster seal.
Seven astronauts were killed and the shuttle fleet has been grounded ever since.

   During yesterday's test, engineers drilled holes into the booster and intentionally left off critical adhesives in order to test whether the back-up seals would contain the leaking hot gasses.
"It was like a blowtorch" on some of the seals, said Allan McDonald, vice president of space engineering for Morton Thiokol Inc., which makes the solid-rocket boosters for NASA and tests them.

   The seals worked despite the intense heat and pressure, capping a poignant day for Mr. McDonald.
The evening before the Challenger launch, he had argued furiously against launching because of his fears about the seals, called O-rings.
But he was overruled by senior Morton Thiokol officials and NASA. Yesterday, he called the test "the final test" for the redesigned booster.
"We got an A-plus," he added.

   Morton Thiokol tested the rocket booster in an arid patch of land in Promontory, Utah.
The rocket fired for two minutes and eight seconds, sending up a billowing tower of green-tinged smoke.
Shortly after the rocket stopped burning, Mr. McDonald and Mr. Mitchell climbed over it to see how well the rocket performed.

   NASA's success yesterday follows by about a week a successful test firing of the shuttle Discovery's main engines, and reduces to a minimum the number of technical challenges facing the agency before it resumes shuttle launches.
At Kennedy Space Center yesterday, a NASA spokesman said the workers were ahead of schedule repairing a small steering-rocket fuel line leak.
For the first time, NASA is trying to accomplish this repair, which requires cutting into the shuttle, on the launch pad rather than rolling the spacecraft back to its hangar.

   If NASA's luck continues and if it can avert a rollback, the space agency stands a reasonable chance of meeting its much-postponed goal of launching the Discovery at the end of September or early October.
Still, the agency remained cautious yesterday and wouldn't venture a new target date for the launch.

   Shaking off weeks of embarrassing setbacks, the U.S. space program roared toward recovery by successfully test firing the space shuttle Discovery's three big engines.

   Senior officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration reacted jubilantly to the test, which provided a powerful image of a resurgent space agency.
"Super job; super team," NASA Administrator James Fletcher told the dozens of NASA engineers sitting in front of computer consoles in the flight control room.
"I can remember the days of Apollo and I don't think we did any better then."

   Test firing the Discovery was the most critical test facing NASA because it involved the actual spacecraft to be launched -- probably in October -- rather than test equipment.
Last week, NASA scrubbed the test a moment before ignition because a balky fuel valve closed too slowly.
This time, though, after the faulty valve was replaced, the countdown went flawlessly.

   The shuttle's engines fired in proper sequence, releasing a scarlet torrent of flame that pounded the launch pad for 20 seconds and kicked a billowing cloud of exhaust 200 feet into the air.
The power of the engines vibrated the wooden press stands, three miles away, and gave a taste of the shuttle's full power.
During an actual launch, the shuttle engines supply only a portion of the power needed to launch the massive shuttle into orbit.
Most of the power comes from two solid-fuel rocket boosters, which weren't tested yesterday because they can't be shut off once ignited.

   The test capped a night of tension for NASA.
Two weeks of delays had personnel on edge, and space-agency officials worried that they might be forced to postpone the test because of the threat of thunderstorms that later did soak the area.
"I was worried about the engines," and the possibility a problem might arise within 10 seconds of ignition, said Allyn Smith, a firing-room manager.

   NASA officials who examined data for three hours after the test said they could find only a few minor problems -- and none that would cause yet another shuttle delay.
NASA once hoped to get the shuttle flying by early 1987, and as early as this spring agency officials spoke confidently of an August liftoff.

   Robert Crippen, a former astronaut who gives the final go-ahead for shuttle launches, said NASA still has a "shot" at launching in late September.
"We proved {Discovery} works well," he said.
"We have a well-oiled team and a set of equipment that makes me confident to go ahead."

   The shuttle still has a number of technical hurdles to clear before launch.
Next week, NASA will test fire in Utah a solid-fuel rocket booster that has holes bored into it to see how well the booster's backup seals contain escaping gases.
A faulty rocket seal led to the Challenger disaster on Jan. 28, 1986, which killed seven astronauts and grounded the shuttle fleet.

   Meanwhile, here at Kennedy Space Center, engineers next week will start to repair a tiny steering-motor leak deep in the orbiter.
NASA proposes, for the first time, to cut into the orbiter while it sits on the launch pad to clamp the leak.
Thomas Utsman, Kennedy's deputy director, played down the difficulty of the task.
"It's not a chainsaw massacre," he said.

   NASA is doing its best to keep Discovery on the launch pad.
Pulling it back to the hangar would delay the launch by a month or so and would erase any gains the agency made yesterday in portraying itself as being on the mend.

   Separately, NASA said it signed a contract with Boeing Co. to modify a Boeing 747 aircraft to ferry shuttles from landing sites to the Kennedy Space Center.
The contract is valued at $55 million.
NASA already has one such shuttle carrier, but it wants a second as a backup.

   The ill-starred space shuttle program suffered yet another embarrassment.

   A moment before the space shuttle Discovery's three main engines were set to fire in a crucial test yesterday, an electronic engine controller automatically aborted the test.
The controller sensed that engine No. 2 -- a new engine that had never flown in space -- hadn't closed a critical valve fast enough and might leak pressurized fuel.
At worst, such a leak could rupture the engine.

   Scrubbing the test is the latest in a series of setbacks that have pushed the launching of Discovery far behind schedule.
This spring the National Aeronautics and Space Administration confidently predicted an August liftoff, and the agency still contends it can make it in September.
But now even October seems optimistic.
NASA has said it won't set a date until after it successfully completes the test firing.

   NASA first must figure out whether the shuttle engine actually malfunctioned or a sensor merely misread the situation.
The agency suspended the test until Sunday but said the delay could stretch until late next week depending on the severity of the problem.

   Boyce Mix, resident manager of NASA's Stennis Test Center in Bay St. Louis, Miss., where the engines are tested, said NASA hopes to decide today how to repair the problem.
The critical valve, an engine leak-valve, must be at least 80% closed before firing, NASA officials said, but in the test yesterday, according to the electronic controller, it had closed only 76%.

   Joseph Lombardo, project manager for the shuttle engines, said that NASA will remove the valve and sensor assembly if they are found faulty.
That would take about a week.
Alternatively, he said, NASA might decide to change the software controlling the valve.
That would take just a few days.

   Engine problems can sometimes lead to big delays.
During 1984, for instance, NASA delayed the maiden launch of Discovery for two months when it discovered an engine problem one second after the engines ignited.
NASA closed down the launch and later pulled the shuttle back to the assembly building, where workers replaced an engine.

   Neither of the changes contemplated by NASA would require the shuttle to be rolled off the launching pad.
But NASA faces additional delays because of a small fuel-line leak in a steering rocket.
NASA wants to repair the leak on the launching pad by cutting into the shuttle and clamping the leak.
But it hasn't attempted such a repair on the pad before.

   NASA had hoped to make yesterday's test firing a kind of confirmation party for the shuttle.
The space agency rolled the Discovery out of its hangar on July 4, a stirring sight that television news shows used as an optimistic counterpoint to stories about the U.S. Navy downing an Iranian passenger plane.
A successful test firing, which evaluates how spacecraft equipment performs under launch stress, would have demonstrated NASA's renewed technical prowess.

   About 50 reporters showed up to observe the 7:30 a.m. firing from a grandstand three miles from the launching pad.
NASA set up a souvenir stand nearby, and NASA workers watched the countdown from the roof of the flight control center, about a quarter-mile away.

   The countdown started flawlessly.
The escape walkway that astronauts use in case of disaster pulled back at seven minutes before ignition; the on-board computers switched on at 30 seconds before firing.
But then, at five seconds before launch, just when the main engines were to begin firing, the countdown shut down, the escape hatch jumped back into position, and NASA, once more, had to figure out what had gone wrong with the shuttle.

   No U.S. astronauts have been lofted since Jan. 28, 1986, when the shuttle Challenger exploded after liftoff and its seven crewmembers were killed.

   Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. on Friday won
a $550 million contract to design and build a solid-rocket booster
plant in northeast Mississippi.
   Jerry Berg, a NASA spokesman at the Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Ala., said the contract to Lockheed's Sunnyvale,
Calif., division includes $314 million to design and construct new
buildings or modify existing ones, and about $236 million to buy
equipment.
   The facilities will be constructed mainly at Yellow Creek near
Iuka, a government-owned site of an abandoned nuclear power plant.
Construction is expected to take 3{ years.
   NASA will also build a static motor test-firing stand at its
Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, add nozzle production at
its Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans, and modify test
installations at the Marshall space center to accomodate the
advanced solid rocket motor, or ASRM.
   Lockheed Missile and Space Co. was awarded a $44 million
contract to build the test-firing stand at Stennis, NASA also
announced Friday.
   The ASRM is designed to replace the space shuttle's current
booster rockets in the mid-1990s.
   The contracts awarded Friday were companions to one awarded to
Lockheed May 11 covering design, development, test and evaluation
of the new rocket motor. Lon Miller, a spokesman at Stennis, said
construction would begin later this year or next, after necessary
permits are obtained.
   Rocket motor testing is scheduled to begin in 1993.

   Space agency officials prepared to test fire the space shuttle Discovery's main engines today, after weeks of delays.
But problems could force another postponement.

   The engine firing is the most difficult test facing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration before launching Discovery sometime in September or October because it involves firing the actual spacecraft rather than test equipment.
But preparations for the test have become embarrassing for NASA, which has repeatedly discovered tiny fuel-line leaks, played down their significance and then delayed the test while scrambling to repair the leaks.

   This space-agency soap opera has raised anew questions of whether NASA has become too cautious for its own good, and ought to press on with the launch.

   Robert Sieck, the launch director at Kennedy Space Center here, where the test firing will take place, said he is confident that the agency has licked the leak problems.
"I think the hardware will be good to us," he said.
But doubts remain.
Workers at Kennedy spent all night Tuesday hunting for the cause of a small hydrogen fuel-line leak, but couldn't find it.
Instead, they installed new seals and filters, which they figure will take care of the problem.

   But Mr. Sieck said if the line unexpectedly started leaking again while fueling Discovery, NASA might have to postpone the test once again, even though he said the leak wouldn't cause an explosion.
He added that NASA planned to set off tiny explosions -- like "Roman candles" -- on the launch pad to burn off stray hydrogen and reduce the chance of a large explosion even further.

   In addition, Mr. Sieck said, NASA would cancel the test if it rained, on the off chance that the firing could be hit by lightning.

   During the test, NASA will fire Discovery's three main engines for 20 seconds.
These fireworks will rivet attention, but the test will largely evaluate how well the shuttle's unseen software works.
Shuttle software ties together individual flight equipment, which NASA already has tested, and orchestrates their complex workings.

   During the test firing, for instance, the software must ignite the shuttle engines one after the other, in a sequence that takes about one-third of a second to complete, and shut them off in precise order 20 seconds later.
Equally as important, the shuttle software must make sure the two giant solid-rocket boosters, which give the shuttle most of its power during liftoff, don't ignite during the test.
Once lit, the solid-rocket boosters burn until they exhaust their fuel or explode.

   Even if the test succeeds, NASA faces a host of technical hurdles before launch.
Kennedy workers soon will start trying to repair yet another leak buried deep in the orbiter -- the first time NASA has ever cut into the orbiter while it sits on the launch pad.

   Later this month, the agency also is expected to test a solid-rocket booster with holes bored into it to see how well the booster's back-up seals contain escaping gases.
A faulty rocket seal led to the Challenger disaster on Jan. 28, 1986.

   The space shuttle Discovery
flawlessly fired its three huge engines Wednesday and demonstrated
it is ready to carry Americans into space for the first time since
Challenger exploded 2{ years ago.
   ``We proved it works,'' Robert Crippen, deputy director of
shuttle operations, said after the engines spewed 6,000-degree
flames for 22 seconds. ``We really had a super test. We have seen
nothing today that would delay the march toward launch.''
   The first mission might still be possible in late September,
said an elated Forrest S. McCartney, director of the Kennedy Space
Center. Wednesday's flight readiness test had been postponed five
times previously, leading to expectations that Discovery might not
fly until October or later.
   ``Super job, super team,'' NASA administrator James C. Fletcher
told the launch team.
   Thomas E. Utsman, director of shuttle management, called the
test ``a clear demonstration that Discovery is a very good bird.''
   The only question mark was a possible leak of nitrogen gas in an
area where fuel lines join the external tank, Crippen said. The gas
was detected by instruments that had not been there before and
engineers were not certain the readings indicated something new.
   Asked how he felt, with the hot-fire test out of the way,
Crippen replied: ``You can't have a major milestone like that come
out as clean as it was and not feel good about it.''
   Setting of a firm launch date for Discovery awaited analysis of
Wednesday's test and repairs to a small gas leak in a thruster
system that was not involved in the test.
   ``I still think we have a shot at late September,'' Crippen said.
   The engine firing was a crucial step for resuming space flight.
   ``It is an opportunity to assess the readiness of the launch
team, the ground support equipment and flight hardware,'' said
National Aeronautics and Space Administration spokesman Hugh
Harris, reporting on the progress of the test. ``It provides
another measure of the readiness of people and hardware for launch
after many months of assessing and improving the entire shuttle
program.''
   Two other big hurdles stand between Discovery and its four-day
mission with five astronauts: a full-scale test of a redesigned
booster rocket and the sealing of a gas vent line in the shuttle's
space maneuvering system. The second task will require cutting a
hole in Discovery's cargo bay for access.
   The shuttle, its huge fuel tank and two flanking solid rocket
boosters were bolted to the pad during Wednesday's test as its
engines were started in a 3-2-1 sequence separated by 120
milliseconds. During a launch, the engines fire more than eight
minutes, with the boosters providing a powerful assist during the
first two minutes of flight.
   Discovery, which has flown in space six times, was treated as an
untried ship in having to undergo the flight readiness firing. A
total of 732 instruments, five times more than on any previous
shuttle test or launch, were installed throughout the shuttle stack
to take detailed measurements of all system operations.
   The test took special note of the strains placed on the booster
rockets as the engines reached full power. The Challenger exploded
while lifting off on Jan. 28, 1986, because of a leak in a joint on
the right booster, near its attachment point on the fuel tank.
   The shuttle fleet, now numbering three, has undergone numerous
design changes since the accident which killed the seven-member
crew. The orbiter alone has had 220 design changes, the boosters
145, and each of the main engines 30.
   Just before ignition, water poured into the flame trough beneath
the shuttle at the rate of more than 100,000 gallons a minute. When
the fire hit the water, a huge cloud of steam rose toward the sky,
forming a ``V'' that must have seemed a symbol of victory for
firing room personnel who had agonized through the five
postponements.
   The huge stack, 18 stories high, strained against the holddown
bolts, 3.5 inches in diameter and 28 inches long. During a launch,
the nuts to those bolts would be exploded apart to release the ship.
   The engines built up to 1.1 million pounds of thrust in the
first 6.6 seconds, the energy output of 23 Hoover Dams, and a
thunderclap rolled across the launch site.
   The countdown had only one problem. A liquid oxygen pump in
ground support equipment failed and crews shifted to a backup pump.
   Two of Discovery's reusable engines are new. The third has been
used on four shuttle missions.
   A firing attempt Aug. 4 was aborted a fraction of a second
before ignition when an electronic sensor erroneously reported a
valve was not closing properly. Engineers replaced the valve
containing the sensor and made a computer change to lessen the
possibility that a bad signal could force another shutdown.
   The earlier delays were caused by problems with ground support
equipment.

   A space shuttle main rocket engine will
be test-fired Wednesday at the Marshall Space Flight Center, the
first extended firing since the roar of Saturn rockets echoed
across Huntsville in the 1960s.
   ``It's going to be something Huntsville hasn't heard for quite
awhile,'' Marshall spokesman Dom Amatore said.
   The 15-second firing is part of a series of tests on the shuttle
main engines and coincides with the city's ``Space Awareness Week.''
   NASA engineers want to determine how long the rocket motors,
fueled by hydrogen and oxygen from the shuttle's huge external
tank, can run if needed. The engines now operate for about eight
minutes during a shuttle launch.
   Shuttle engine No. 0208, installed in the test stand in August,
was ``warmed up'' in a 1.5-second start test last month.
   After this week's test, a third test firing of 45 seconds will
be scheduled in November. Amatore said the primary goal of the
first brief tests is to verify that Marshall can handle the firings
and whether a metal ``flame bucket'' on the test stand can handle
the rocket exhaust.
   The last test firing of a big rocket motor at Marshall was a
Saturn test on Sept. 11, 1969, about two months after men first set
foot on the moon.
   Marshall is NASA's main propulsion center. In addition to
developing the Saturn rockets, it manages space shuttle propulsion
systems, including the main engines and solid fuel booster rockets,
which are test-fired in Utah.
   ``Space Awareness Week'' includes a visit by the crew of the
shuttle Discovery.
   The five astronaunts who flew last month in the first
post-Challenger shuttle mission are to be in Huntsville on Thursday
and Friday to thank Marshall engineers.
   They also will lead a parade and appear at a public reception
Thursday.
   On Wednesday, singer John Denver and former New Mexico senator
and Apollo astronaut Harrison Schmitt will be in town to discuss
proposed new space missions.
   Denver, who hopes to ride into orbit with a Soviet crew in 1990,
will talk about Earth observation missions while Schmitt will
discuss proposals for manned missions to the moon and Mars.

   An examination of space shuttle
Discovery a day after its test firing turned up no problems to
stand in the way of getting the shuttle ready for flight, NASA said
Thursday.
   ``This vehicle is the cleanest we've ever had after a
flight-readiness firing,'' said Lisa Malone, a spokeswoman for
NASA's Kennedy Space Center. ``We haven't turned up anything
unusual.''
   The successful firing of the three huge engines was a spirit
lifter for space workers here who have had to overcome one problem
after another since Discovery was transported to the launch pad
July 4.
   Miss Malone said officials of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration will not set a launch date until a repair unrelated
to the hot-fire test of the engines is completed.
   That repair, which involves cutting a hole in the Discovery's
bulkhead to gain access to pipe connection that is leaking gas, is
scheduled to begin Wednesday and will take about six days. The leak
is in the system used to steer Discovery in space.
   NASA has one other milestone to meet before setting a date for
the first flight since Challenger exploded in January 1986. That is
a test, scheduled for Aug. 18, of a shuttle booster rocket at the
manufacturing plant in Utah. The test is the fifth in a series of
the booster, which was heavily redesigned after Challenger.
   A faulty joint in Challenger's right booster allowed flames to
escape and triggered the destruction of the shuttle. The joint and
other booster systems have been thoroughly redesigned.
   The rocket will be deliberately flawed, with grooves, cuts and
debondings introduced in critical areas like insulation and O-ring
seals.
   ``It is a significant flaw demonstration test,'' said Robert
Crippen, deputy director of shuttle operations. ``Some say there is
a risk in it, but we have to test the booster to withstand these
worst-case situations.''

   An intentionally flawed space shuttle
booster rocket was successfully fired today in the last of a series
of tests for Morton Thiokol's redesigned booster before resumption
of manned U.S. space flights.
   The two-minute horizontal test firing, the fifth full-scale test
of the booster, sent clouds of dust billowing thousands of feet in
the air as hundreds of NASA and company observers cheered.
   ``Fantastic! It looked really good. This is it,'' said John
Thirkill, vice president of space operations for Morton Thiokol.
   If engineers deemed the test a success after inspecting the
prone rocket, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration
workers can plug a tiny fuel leak in Discovery, NASA officials will
be able to set a firm date in late September or early October for
the first shuttle launch in 32 months.
   Kennedy Space Center workers today planned to clamp a
4-inch-long clamshell-like device over the gas leak and fill it
under pressure with a sealing compound while Discovery remained on
the launch pad.
   To reach the leak, workers used a routing tool Wednesday to cut
two holes in the rear wall of Discovery's 60-foot-long cargo bay
and two more in the adjoining hull of the steering engine
compartment.
   The holes, separated by structural supports, enable a technician
to put both hands into the compartment.
   The tiny leak of nitrogen tetroxide gas was 12 inches from the
newly drilled access panels, on a fitting in a vent line. The leak
was detected more than a month ago and has been stopped by putting
pressure on the line. However, it must be plugged before launch to
prevent additional leakage.
   Because Discovery is standing vertically on the launch pad, the
rear wall of the cargo bay is parallel to the ground, forcing the
technicians to work on their hands and knees or on their stomachs.
   The repair and subsequent testing are expected to take about a
week, said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
   When the leak was discovered last month, officials at first
feared they might have to move Discovery to a hangar for repairs,
which could have delayed the launch as much as two months. But
engineers came up with the innovative idea for making the fix on
the pad.
   The repair was delayed until the launch team conducted a
successful test firing last week of Discovery's three main engines,
powered by liquid fuel. The leak is in a separate engine system
used to steer the shuttle in orbit.
   Scores of improvements have been made to Thiokol's 126-foot-long
booster, but the main emphasis has been on reworking the field
joints that hold together the rocket's cylindrical segments.
   The Challenger explosion was blamed on a faulty joint that
allowed a plume of super-hot gas to burn through an O-ring seal and
ignite the main liquid fuel tank.
   For today's booster test, two of the three field joints _ the
case-to-nozzle joint and the igniter-to-case joint _ were riddled
with 11 intentional flaws to test the joints to their limits as the
rocket burned 1.1 million pounds of propellant in 120 seconds. The
unflawed joint was a control.
   Among the defects were separations in the bonded adhesive
insulation that helps hold the joints together, and channels that
would allow the fiery gas to reach the joint's middle O-ring, one
of three designed to contain heat from the burning fuel.
   The joints also are equipped with heaters to keep their
temperatures at a minimum of 75 degrees. Freezing air the night
before the doomed Challenger launch were found to have contributed
to the joint's failure.
   With the exception of the flaws, the rocket is virtually
identical to a version Morton Thiokol successfully test-fired on
June 14 and to those now attached to Discovery.

   A gas leak in a steering engine
compartment was sealed by technicians Friday, another step toward
clearing the space shuttle Discovery for launch in late September
or early October.
   Working in cramped quarters in Discovery's up-ended cargo bay,
the workers bolted a clamshell-like device on a one-half-inch
diameter fuel line that was detected leaking nitrogen tetroxide gas
more than a month ago.
   Once the 2-inch clamp was in place, the technicians filled it
with a sealing compound. Then they subjected the line to pressure
tests, and NASA spokesman Karl Kristofferson reported initial data
indicated the leak had been plugged. He said the seal would be
monitored for several days to be sure there was no additional
leakage.
   If the seal holds as expected, and if initially encouraging
results of a solid fuel booster rocket test in Utah hold up, the
space agency may set a date next week for launching Discovery on
the first shuttle mission since Challenger exploded and killed its
crew of seven on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Officials have been considering a launch in late September or
early October, with Sept. 29 listed as one internal planning date.
   An intentionally flawed booster was fired for two minutes
Thursday at the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah in the fifth and final
pre-flight test of the redesigned rocket. A faulty joint in a
booster was blamed for the Challenger accident.
   ``We're ready to fly; it looks like an absolutely great test
from top to bottom,'' said Royce Mitchell, NASA's solid rocket
booster project manager.
   However, officials said that while initial results looked great,
it would take several days to thoroughly analyze the test data.
   To reach the nitrogen tetroxide leak, workers Wednesday used an
electric router to drill holes through the rear wall of Discovery's
60-foot-long cargo bay and through the adjoining hull of a steering
engine compartment.
   The tiny leak was 12 inches from the newly drilled access
panels, on a fitting in a vent line.
   Because Discovery is standing vertically on the launch pad, the
rear wall of the cargo bay is parallel to the ground, forcing the
technicians to work on their hands and knees. They worked in a
cramped quarters surrounded by a tent-like canvas to prevent loose
debris from reaching other areas of the shuttle.
   When the leak was discovered more than a month ago, officials at
first feared they might have to move Discovery off the launch pad
to a hangar for repairs, a move that could have delayed the launch
for as much as two months, into November.
   But engineers came up with the innovative idea for making the
fix on the pad.
   The repair job was delayed until after the launch team conducted
a successful test firing last week of Discovery's three liquid fuel
main engines. The leak is in a separate engine system used to steer
the shuttle in orbit.

<HEAD>New Engine Not Perfect, But Good Enough To Fly Shuttle Again,
Experts Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When NASA engineers set out to develop a new
design for the space shuttle rocket boosters, they had to do it
fast, do it cheap and do it right.
   The result, say most experts, is a rocket that is just short of
the best design possible, but certainly good enough to get America
back into space and keep it there until better rockets are built.
   ``If you started with a clean sheet of paper, there are things
you could do'' to improve the rockets, said Russ Bardos, NASA's
director of shuttle propulsion. But he added: ``I'm perfectly
comfortable with what we have on there now.''
   Space shuttle Discovery stands poised to ride into space before
the end of the month on redesigned solid rocket boosters developed
in a crash program that lasted 31 months, required hundreds of
thousands of man hours and cost the nation $800 million.
   Better rocket engines will be built, said Bardos, but it will
take an additional four to five years and require even more money.
   The redesign program started after the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger
explosion that bared serious problems with the boosters that 24
times previously had sent astronauts into orbit.
   Engineers deep in the structure of NASA had known as early as
1984 that leaking seals on the boosters threatened disaster. A
quiet program to develop a new booster design had been started at
the Marshall Space Flight Center and at Morton Thiokol, the Utah
manufacturer of the rocket.
   In the meantime, NASA expressed confidence in the boosters, and
withheld any concerns from the public and even from the astronauts.
The shuttles kept flying.
   A member of the Rogers Commission, which investigated the
Challenger accident, later described the decision to continue
flying as playing ``Russian roulette'' with a flawed and dangerous
system.
   The game ended when Challenger exploded and seven astronauts
died.
   A new team was named to correct the flawed boosters and some
members of the group later said they were amazed to find how little
data there was about about the internal workings of the rockets.
What appeared to be a simple steel tube filled with propellant was,
in fact, a complex machine.
   ``There was so much we didn't know,'' said Bardos. ``It needed a
lot of design work and changes.''
   The shuttle boosters are the largest solid-fueled rockets ever
made. Two are used to launch the shuttle and each is 149.16 feet
long and 12.17 feet in diameter. Loaded with 1.1 million pounds of
propellant, each boosters weighs 1.3 million pounds and produces
about 3.3 million pounds of thrust at launch, providing more than
two-thirds the lifting power to get the shuttle airborne.
   Because the boosters are so massive, they are manufactured in
four segments. Each of the steel casings are filled with a mixture
of chemicals that cure into a tough, rubber-like solid. The
segments are shipped to the Kennedy Space Center where they are
assembled.
   When the segments come together, they join at what is called a
field joint. It was a failed field joint that leaked and destroyed
Challenger.
   The field joints used for Challenger had a metal lip, called a
tang, that fit into a deep metal groove called a clevis. One side
of the clevis housed two O-rings, or rubberized seals. Bolts held
the clevis and tang together.
   When the propellant was ignited inside the rocket, a pressure of
up to 900 pounds per square inch and temperatures of several
thousand degrees immediately surged against the joint. The surge
was supposed to force the O-rings to seal the joint.
   However, engineers learned early in the shuttle program that the
sudden pressure actually caused the heavy steel casings to balloon
out, an action called ``rotation.'' This caused the joint to open
slightly. If the action was severe enough, the O-rings could lose
their capacity to seal.
   Low temperatures also affected the O-rings. When chilled, the
rubberized material became hard and sealed more slowly.
   When Challenger was launched, the boosters had been chilled by
sub-freezing temperatures overnight. Photos of the launch showed
that superheated gas escaped immediately from the lower field joint
on the right-hand booster. The rocket gases later melted through a
brace to free one end of the shuttle's massive fuel tank. The tank
ruptured and Challenger exploded just 73 seconds after launch.

   Will the U.S. muster the nerve to launch another space shuttle?

   No doubt it will, someday.
But for now, the terrible specter of Challenger stands in the way.

   Tormented by the 1986 disaster, second-guessed by congressmen and others, and overwhelmed by paper work, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's shuttle program advances warily.
NASA's efforts to guarantee a safe launch are complicating an already complex project.
The upshot: new and unpredictable risks.

   Says John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University: "Somebody has to have the guts to say the damn thing is safe enough, and that it will never be 100% safe."

   The Discovery shuttle, already a year behind schedule, is supposed to be launched on Aug. 4.
But that will take "a miracle," says NASA administrator James Fletcher.
Another glitch, and the launch may get delayed until 1989, three years after the world watched an endearing young schoolteacher and six other all-American astronauts perish on live television.

   The memory is all too fresh here, and officials insist they'll never be rushed into another launch.
"We'll take whatever time it takes," snaps Forrest McCartney, the retired Air Force general who runs the Kennedy Space Center.
"We're not playing games here; we're talking about killing people.
Think I want to be part of an accident?
Not this boy."

   NASA is acutely aware the space program's future may ride on Discovery's success or failure.
Richard Truly, head of space flight at NASA, says another accident would deal a "fatal blow" to the shuttle.
Charles Redmond, a NASA spokesman who witnessed the Challenger explosion, says he and some other NASA managers won't travel to Florida to watch the next launch because of their "dread" of another crash.

   The next launch's crew will be strictly G.I. No women or civilians, and certainly no schoolteachers, will risk their lives in front of the nation's schoolchildren this time.
NASA, which once promised to send a journalist into space, now is considering keeping reporters 15 miles from the launch pad.
An explosion, the agency figures, could propel 100-pound chunks of metal into the press stands three miles away.

   Any one of a half-dozen NASA officials could have called off the Challenger countdown two years ago, but nobody spoke up.
The decision next time won't be made by default.
The final call will rest with one man, Robert Crippen, a dashing 50-year-old who piloted the first shuttle flight in 1981.
He can cancel the launch alone -- and he says he will certainly do so if any one of 20 key launch managers, in a last-minute poll, raises an objection.

   Mr. Crippen, whose 1981 flight prompted tens of thousands of letters from admiring female fans, keeps a figure of a rocket-riding Superman -- with Mr. Crippen's face -- in his office.
Mr. Crippen vows he won't be intimidated by senior NASA officials.
"If they don't like my decision," he says with cocky self-confidence, "they can fire me."

   But Superman never worked for a NASA.
The agency's management style discourages decisive action and encourages delays.
The launch is still a long way off.
Minor technical glitches have brought work on the shuttle to a halt at times.
Endless meetings have preoccupied managers and eroded their self-confidence.
Until the launch date, says James Beggs, a former NASA administrator, "There are too many people who can say no."

   Some old NASA hands say the caution could backfire, and compromise the mission's safety.
If "jumpy" officials allow a series of delays, says Alex Roland, a former NASA historian who now teaches at Duke University, "then they'll be in the same fix as they were before Challenger; they'll feel under public pressure to launch."

   Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, when hot gases escaped from a tiny gap in a rocket-motor seal.
On a warmer day with milder winds, the seal might well have held.
NASA later rejected advice that it simply patch the seals and launch only on a warm day to eliminate the risk.
It chose to redesign the entire system.

   The cautious approach has created new problems, as when workers found they couldn't tighten some bolts on Discovery's solid rocket boosters exactly the way instruction manuals dictated.
Before they tried again, Mr. McCartney says, he insisted the California engineer who wrote the instructions rewrite them.
In other cases, decisions have been bucked upward.
For example, the shuttle director in Washington, D.C., must give his approval before workers in Florida can use parts from reserve shuttles on Discovery.

   Astronauts had little management responsibility before.
Now they play a major role in management.
"Everybody thinks test pilots are brave," says Mr. Truly, himself a former test pilot and astronaut, "but really they are the most conservative people I know.
The way to become a successful test pilot is to stack up as many of the odds you can in your favor, and then fly.
Space flight is like that, 10 times over."

   While Mr. Crippen's decision will determine whether Discovery lifts off or remains earthbound, he shares with Mr. Truly control of the launch date.
A rear admiral who piloted the second space shuttle mission, Mr. Truly heads review sessions at which NASA employees and contractors swear that subsystems are in working order.
A few weeks before the launch, Mr. Truly will preside over a final review.

   Then Mr. Crippen, a midlevel manager, takes over.
He will start the countdown 55 hours before launch, order the final Go nine minutes before blastoff -- and, if any last-minute glitches go unrepaired, cancel it.
Afterward, he will jet to the Johnson Space Center in Houston to track the shuttle's flight.

   Mr. Crippen blames himself for not asking more probing questions of shuttle engineers before the Challenger disaster.
Now he says he's pressing them to ensure that Discovery is safe.
But many other people take part in decision-making before launch.
And NASA, sensitive to complaints that it ignored critics before the Challenger accident, will listen to nearly anybody now.
Its safety work and redesign are reviewed by two National Academy of Sciences panels and by other panels in NASA and Congress.

   On launch day, Mr. Crippen will huddle with a team of 20 NASA managers and contractors in a glass-enclosed corner of the launch room, while most of his bosses will peer over his shoulder from another glass enclosure across the room.
They are linked by intercom and telephone.

   Mr. Crippen says he will poll the members of his team at nine minutes before launch to make sure every one of them agrees to proceed.
He requires unanimity.
"I can't foresee circumstances where if someone is uncomfortable about launching on my team, I'll override them," he says.

   At least one of Mr. Crippen's bosses across the launch room, George Rodney, NASA's chief of safety, says he wants to vote on the launch, too.
"I'll have no compunction telling Bob Crippen there's something wrong and he'll have to react to it," Mr. Rodney says.

   For all its prudence, NASA is still capable of boners.
In March 1987 -- more than a year after Challenger -- a NASA team launched an unmanned Atlas Centaur rocket into a thunderstorm and watched, awestruck, as a bolt of lightning destroyed it.
The agency now says it won't launch Discovery if there is a cloud nearby.

   NASA also says it won't launch if the temperature is below 39 degrees, even though it added heaters to make such launches safe.
To make triply sure nothing goes awry, it will refrigerate a solid rocket booster for 30 days and test-fire it if the launch is scheduled for an autumn, and probably cool, day.

   The harsh truth is that none of this guarantees a safe launch.
The agency says it has spent $800 million and made about 400 changes in the orbiter, two solid rocket boosters and giant fuel tank that constitute the shuttle.
But it remains an astonishingly fragile machine.
Should any of nearly 5,000 critical components fail during flight, NASA calculates, the shuttle could crash.
Should one solid rocket booster fire just a moment before the other, the shuttle would topple in an enormous explosion.

   Besides this, says Charles Perrow, a Yale University sociologist who studies complex mechanical systems, improvements to machines often create new and unexpected faults.
"The safety devices themselves become more and more the source of accidents," he says.

   On the shuttle's solid rocket boosters, for instance, NASA engineers worried that a gap could open in the joint connecting a nozzle to the bottom of the rocket, leaking hot gases.
So they tightened the joint by adding 100 bolts.
But Roger Boisjoly, a former engineer for rocket-maker Morton Thiokol Inc. who warned NASA against launching the Challenger, thinks the redesign may make the Discovery less safe.
Now there are 100 more places to spring a leak.
Says Mr. Boisjoly: "NASA violated the cardinal rule in mechanical design: Keep it simple, stupid."

   NASA says it has confidence in its joint design.
It is being rigorously tested along with the rest of the shuttle system.
The agency plans to fire two more solid rocket boosters at Morton Thiokol's Wasatch, Utah, test range, and then spend two weeks dissecting the rockets to see how their parts performed.
NASA also will fire Discovery's liquid-propellant engines at Kennedy before launch.

   But the tests can't predict whether Discovery's rocket boosters will work as well as the test rockets.
Each booster is essentially made by hand and differs a trifle from others.
Those of the Challenger era worked well enough in tests and on 24 flights, only to fail catastrophically on the 25th.
"The ultimate test is the launch," says David Winterhalter, NASA's director of systems engineering and design.

   Before testing, NASA predicts how parts will fare.
Afterward it compares its predictions with results.
This post-Challenger procedure detects flaws but also can create new problems.
In a test last December, a rocket-motor part unexpectedly burned off in testing.
Had this occurred in flight, it wouldn't have endangered the shuttle.
Nonetheless, NASA replaced the part with one made from a backup design, delaying the launch another two months more.

   Another delay is likely.
The prospect dismays Rep. Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat who sits on a House panel overseeing NASA.
Once he had criticized NASA for ignoring safety.
Now he says he's more worried about "NASA's failure of nerve."

   Mr. Truly shrugs it off.
"How do I balance being called a wimp on the one hand and unsafe on the other?" he asks.

   Safety features in the redesigned space
shuttle booster rocket appear to have performed as designed during
a crucial test-firing despite deliberately incorporated flaws, a
spokesman said Monday.
   The test was the fifth and final full-scale firing needed to
qualify the solid-fuel booster for flight.
   Engineers from Morton Thiokol Inc. and NASA have torn down the
aft skirting and nozzle section of the 126-foot-long rocket that
was fired last Thursday at Morton Thiokol's plant 25 miles west of
Brigham City, said company spokesman Rocky Raab.
   ``Everything continues to look very, very good,'' Raab said of
the weekend examinations. ``No problems whatever were uncovered
.... From what they've seen so far, it looks like the best nozzle
yet.''
   If the positive evaluation of the rocket holds, NASA officials
have said they expect to set a firm launch date in late September
or early October for the first shuttle flight since Challenger
exploded on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Engineers also examined the test booster's nozzle section,
looking for any indications of unexpected failure in features
designed to contain super-hot exhayst gases, Raab said.
   A NASA-designed nozzle component failed during the second of
five qualifying firings last December. Subsequent test-firings
incorporated a Morton Thiokol nozzle design that had been
successfully used in the first full-scale test in August 1987 _ and
has performed well since.
   NASA grounded the shuttle program after the Challenger disaster
in which seven astronauts died. A presidential commission blamed
the disaster on a faulty booster seal between segments of one
booster which allowed exhaust to escape sideways and ignite the
spacecraft's external liquid fuel tank.
   Raab said detailed inspection and analysis of the tested rocket
will continue through the rest of the month, with engineers
removing another of the booster's four segments about every two
days.
   ``We should be able to remove the aft segment about Thursday,
allowing them to look at the most-flawed field joint. There will be
extensive documentation and testing done when they break that
joint,'' Raab said.
   ``They should finish up about two weeks after the firing,'' he
said, adding that final NASA clearance for the booster's use should
come shortly after that.
   Last week's $20 million test-firing was the climax of Morton
Thiokol's 2{-year, $470 million effort to redesign the solid-fuel
rocket.
   For the test-firing, two of the three joints, the case-to-nozzle
joint and the igniter-to-case joint were riddled with 14
intentional flaws. Morton Thiokol officials said the flaws were
intended to test the new booster's safety features to their limits.
   The third joint was left unflawed in order to serve as a
comparison, Raab said.
   Among the defects were separations in bonded adhesive insulation
that helps hold the joints together, and channels cut to allow
gases to reach the joint's middle O-ring _ one of three gaskets
designed to contain heat from the burning fuel during a launch.

   Space shuttle Discovery roared to
life on the launch pad today as NASA ignited its main engines in a
crucial 22-second test leading up to the first U.S. manned space
mission since the Challenger disaster 2{ years ago.
   NASA officials pronounced the test a success.
   ``It's a clear demonstration that Discovery is a very good
bird,'' Thomas E. Utsman, director of shuttle management, said
after the firing that checked modifications to the engines and
other systems with ground-shaking fury and a V-shaped steam cloud.
   Robert Crippen, deputy director of shuttle operations, said a
firm launch date would not be set until the test data is thoroughly
analyzed and a small gas leak in a thruster system discovered
several weeks ago is repaired.
   ``I still think we have a shot at late September,'' Crippen said
at a news conference.
   Crippen said the only question mark today was a possible leak of
nitrogen gas where fuel lines join the external tank. But he also
pronounced the firing a ``a super test'' and said, ``We have seen
nothing today that would delay the march toward launch.''
   The firing, delayed five times in two weeks by leaks and other
mechanical problems, was critical to certifying the shuttle for the
first post-Challenger launch. Many officials believe the liftoff
won't come until October.
   At the end of today's near-flawless countdown, the three main
liquid fuel engines on the delta-winged spaceship flashed to life.
The launch pedestal was engulfed in steam as the fiery exhaust
collided with protective water pouring over the base.
   A thunderclap rolled across the Kennedy Space Center as the
engines, fed by liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, generated thrust
equal to the energy output of 23 Hoover Dams.
   ``Super job, super team,'' NASA administrator James C. Fletcher
told the launch team following the test.
   ``It was a very smooth countdown; the team and the hardware all
worked successfully,'' Forrest S. McCartney, director of the
Kennedy Space Center, told the team. ``It's been a long night, but
it sure ended right.''
   The 85-ton spaceship strained against eight 3-foot-long hardened
steel bolts holding it down on the pad. On an actual launch, two
solid fuel booster rockets would ignite and explosive charges would
sever the bolts to free the shuttle.
   A total of 732 instruments were installed throughout the shuttle
to take detailed measurements of all system operations. That's five
times more than on any previous shuttle test or launch.
   The test-firing followed five postponements, including a
computer-ordered halt a split second before ignition last Thursday.
   Launch director Bob Sieck today thanked his crew ``for making
our toughest test look easy. You should be pleased because it was
an excellent performance and you should look forward to the launch
count with confidence.''
   The 22-second burst of power today was just a fraction of the
more than eight minutes that the engines are to burn in propelling
Discovery into orbit. But engineers said the firing was long enough
to test the entire shuttle system.
   ``We'll test the hardware and the software and the people,''
launch director Bob Sieck said before the exercise. ``We want to
demonstrate the readiness of the total system for flight.''
   NASA spokeswoman Cindy Buck said a liquid oxygen pump in ground
support equipment failed early today but crews shifted to a backup
pump. Ignition was on time at 7:30 a.m.
   Two of the engines, which are reuseable, are new. The third has
been flown on three shuttle missions.
   A firing attempt last Thursday was aborted a fraction of a
second before ignition when an electronic sensor erroneously
reported a valve was not closing properly.
   Engineers replaced the valve containing the sensor and made a
computer change to lessen the possibility that a bad signal could
force another shutdown.
   Earlier delays were caused by problems with ground support
equipment.
   Still facing the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
is a small gas leak in a steering engine system separate from
Discovery's three main engines. Shuttle managers are expected to
give a go-ahead within a few days to a plan for engineers to cut
through the rear wall of the shuttle's cargo bay to reach and
repair a nitrogen tetroxide leak in a vent valve seal.
   The shuttle program also must pass another key propulsion test
before Discovery can be certified for flight: a full-scale
two-minute firing, the fifth in a series, of the redesigned solid
fuel booster rocket. That is scheduled Aug. 18 at the Morton
Thiokol plant in Utah.
   A faulty booster rocket joint was blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986,
explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed its crew of seven.
   Checked today were modifications to turbopumps, valve actuators,
electronic controllers and other engine systems. Also being tested
were ground support equipment, communications links, new countdown
procedures and personnel.
   Five veteran shuttle fliers have been assigned to the Discovery
mission. During the four-day flight they are to deploy a
communications satellite, conduct experiments and evaluate new
spaceship systems.

   A booster rocket that was to be tested in two
weeks in Utah was damaged when a workman incorrectly installed a
test gauge, but NASA said today that the accident is not expected
to delay the resumption of space shuttle flights.
   The space shuttle Discovery is poised on its launching pad at
Cape Canaveral, Fla., for liftoff on Sept. 4. The successful
outcome of the booster rocket test in Utah is a requirement for the
launching to take place.
   NASA spokesman David Garrett said the test motor will have to be
disassembled as far as the center field joint for evaluation and
possible repairs, and then be reassembled.
   That, he said, will reuire rescheduling of the test from July 25
to ``at least mid-August.'' But, he added, ``We do not expect it
will affect the STS 26 launch schedule. ''
   STS-26 is the official designation for the first flight of a
space shuttle since a 1968 explosion destroyed Challenger and
killed seven crew members.
   Edward S. Campion, a National Aeronautics and Space
Administration spokesman, said a Morton Thiokol worker damaged the
test rocket over the weekend while attempting to install a gauge
that was to be used during a test firing.
   ``It (the gauge) was installed with an incorrect setting which
caused the hardware to be damaged,'' said Campion.
   Ed Medal, a spokesman for NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala., said the rocket's center field joint was
inadvertantly overpressurized during leak checks.
   He said one section of the joint was subjected to pressure of
1,000 pounds per square inch. Another section, he said, was to have
been checked at 100 psi, but was mistakenly subjected to the higher
pressure.
   The rocket engine was to be test fired in Utah on July 25.
Campion said NASA officials have said that that test must be
successfully completed before the space shuttle can fly again.
Space shuttle Discovery is now on a launch pad at the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida and is scheduled to be launched early in
September.
   Campion said officials are trying to determine how long the test
firing in Utah will be delayed by the needed repairs and if this
delay will affect the space shuttle launch.
   The test rocket in Utah incorporates a new booster design
created after the January 1986 Challenger accident, which killed
seven astronauts. Space shuttle Challenger exploded after its
launch from the Kennedy Space Center. The explosion was blamed on a
flawed rocket booster design. The space shuttle fleet has been
grounded while the booster had been redesigned and tested.
   NASA officials said the July 25 test was crucial for clearing
the shuttle for the resumption of space flights.

   No matter the care taken and the tests
conducted, eventually there will be another space accident and the
Marshall Space Flight Center probably will once again be the target
of the nation's anger and anguish.
   That, says J. R. Thompson, director of Marshall, is a truth
engineers learn to live with at the NASA center that designs and
develops the most dangerous parts of a space machine.
   ``Ours are the two high-risk elements _ the shuttle main engine
and the shuttle solid rocket,'' Thompson said in an interview at
the facility in the forested hills of northern Alabama. ``In 9
chances out of 10, when there is a catastrophic failure, it will
rest with those two elements.''
   ``When a mission goes good, the focus is going to be on the
operations end,'' he said. ``When things go amiss, the attention is
going to be right here ... It's not an unfair thing. We're big boys
and we know that's the job we've got.''
   A presidential commission concluded that the explosion that
destroyed Challenger and killed its seven crew members on Jan. 28,
1986, was caused by a flawed solid rocket booster that blowtorched
against the external tank.
   Marshall engineers became personal targets of blame. Their
judgment was ridiculed, their diligence belittled and their
competence questioned.
   Larry Mulloy, who headed the solid rocket booster program at
Marshall, received hate mail and endured the collapse of a 23-year
career at NASA. William Lucas, director at Marshall, resigned, with
parting, bitter shots at the press. Ten other managers also left,
retiring or seeking jobs in private industry.
   None of the more than 3,400 workers at Marshall escaped the
stain.
   ``It was devastating,'' said Bob Erwin, an engineer who analyzes
stresses on the spacecraft. ``Everybody was pretty low. There was
not so much a sense of guilt as of loss. There was also the sense
of professional embarrassment. Something had gone terribly wrong
and Marshall was responsible.''
   The drumbeat of blame, recalled Jerry Patterson, an organic
chemist and materials expert, seemed to last forever.
   ``All the nails were driven in place and we were just hanging
there and they were still beating on us,'' he said. ``Eventually it
got to be too much ... We had accepted the responsibility. What we
had to do then was make it right.''
   That involved the most massive effort at reevaluation, repair
and redesign ever attempted by NASA.
   Teams of engineers at Marshall dissected every piece of hardware
developed at the Alabama center. Every design was reexamined. Every
test was checked over and new ones were ordered where needed.
   Work days stretched from 10 to 12 to 14 hours, and, for many,
weekends were forgotten.
   Thompson said more tests were made on the main engines and on
the solid rocket boosters than were conducted before the shuttle
first flew in 1981. The goal was not to find out if the equipment
was just ``good enough,'' but to demonstrate that it was better
than it had to be.
   The full-scale solid rocket engine, with a new design for the
flawed joint, was fired five times at a test site in Utah by its
manufacturer, Morton Thiokol Inc. There were hundreds of other
firings using sub-scale models or partial propellant loads.
   In one full-scale test, flaws were intentionally introduced to
see if the new rocket had a margin of safety. It was a test never
before attempted in the solid rocket industry.
   ``A lot of people inside and outside the agency didn't like that
test because they thought it was pushing the engine too far,'' said
Thompson. If it had failed, it could have caused a long delay in
shuttle flights. But Thompson and the Marshall engineers insisted
because, he said, they ``believed in our design and wanted to go
out on the test stand and prove it.''
   The new rocket engine passed the test with margin to spare.
   Before Challenger, engineers recalled, dissent against consensus
technical views was discouraged. Public differences of opinion were
rare and quickly silenced.
   ``You were part of a team and it seemed a betrayal to take a
contrary view,'' said one engineer.
   Challenger changed that.
   ``The accident strengthened the hand of the engineers in the
trenches,'' said Erwin. ``Before, if you objected to something the
manager could say you were overcautious because we had never had an
accident. Now if a manager wants to yield to schedule pressures, we
tell him that he's on his own.''
   The new openness has resulted in conflicts unknown before
Challenger. In one case, some experts believed a material in a
solid rocket part needed one more test and refused to approve its
use despite pressure from a manager. At conferences, it has become
common for engineers to stand up and object to positions taken by
their own managers.
   ``You admire a guy who has the courage to take a position
different from the crowd,'' Thompson said. ``But that doesn't mean
it's a democracy. You're not going to launch with a democracy.
You've got to have certain people in the system who make decisions
and go.''

   The pieces are coming together and
officials here are confident they soon will launch their first
space shuttle mission since Challenger exploded nearly 2{ years ago.
   Two 126-foot-tall solid fuel booster rockets were hooked up
Friday with a huge external fuel tank, and on Thursday the stack
will be joined with the shuttle Discovery.
   The projected liftoff date is Aug. 31. But NASA officials
caution the schedule is tight, with many milestones to be passed.
   ``The August target is optimistic, for sure, but given where we
are today, we've got a shot at it,'' launch director Bob Sieck said.
   ``We're getting close and there's a feeling of excitement
here,'' said astronaut Bob Crippen, who as deputy director of
shuttle operations will make the decision in the closing minutes
whether Discovery should be launched.
   Crippen, a veteran of four space shuttle flights, and Sieck
spoke at a news conference.
   When Discovery reaches the launch pad, workers will prepare it
for a critical flight readiness firing of its three main liquid
fuel engines.
   The 20-second ignition, with Discovery bolted firmly to the pad,
will test several modifications made to the powerful engines during
the long period the shuttles have been grounded.
   It also will provide countdown experience for the launch team.
   Also ahead, on Tuesday and on July 26, are two more full-scale
firings of test models of the solid fuel booster rockets at the
Morton Thiokol facility in Utah. A faulty booster joint was blamed
for the explosion of Challenger and loss of its seven crew members
on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Testing of the redesigned booster has gone so well that NASA was
able to confidently assemble here the two rockets for Discovery's
flight.
   Assigned to fly Discovery on the mission will be Frederick H.
Hauck, the commander; Richard O. Covey, the pilot; and mission
specialists George Nelson, Michael Lounge and David Hilmers.
   They are to deploy a communications satellite and conduct 11
science and technology experiments.

   An apparently flawless test-firing of
the space shuttle's redesigned booster rocket has improved the odds
of NASA meeting its goal of resuming manned space flight in
mid-August, officials say.
   Wednesday's two-minute firing of the 126-foot rocket went
smoothly, but spokesmen for NASA and Morton Thiokol, which
manufactures the booster, say it will take a week to 10 days to
verify the test was a success.
   A cursory inspection of the rocket afterward indicated the
redesigned seals in the booster's joints prevented an escape of hot
gases despite deliberately built-in flaws.
   ``It's a happy day for a lot of people,'' said Royce Mitchell,
solid rocket program manager for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. ``So far, it looks excellent.''
   In a post-test briefing, Alan McDonald, Morton Thiokol vice
president for engineering, displayed a graph on which nearly
identical curves compared engineers' predictions with a preliminary
test evaluation taken from electronic monitors.
   ``Unless you're about only eight millimeters away, you can't
tell any difference,'' McDonald said.
   Barring discovery of problems as the rocket is dismantled,
Wednesday's success means Morton Thiokol must conduct only two more
full-scale tests, in June and July, before NASA can proceed with an
August launch of the shuttle Discovery.
   It would be America's first manned space flight since the
shuttle Challenger exploded 70 seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28,
1986, killing seven crew members.
   ``It's like finally winning the quarterfinals of the NCAA,''
McDonald said of the test.
   The critical concern is whether super-hot gases escaped the
flawed seals. A presidential commission blamed the Challenger
disaster on a joint between segments of the booster rocket whose
seals failed, allowing gases to escape and ignite the space craft's
exterior fuel tank.
   Since then, engineers have added a third O-ring to the seals and
a metal lip, or capture feature, to contain gases that may leak
around the joints linking the four segments of the rocket.
   The case-to-nozzle joint also has been strengthened with 100
radial bolts to prevent vibration during launch, part of a redesign
planned before the Challenger exploded. This joint attaches the
nozzle to the aft segment.
   In the middle joint, engineers left a gap one-tenth of an inch
wide between two sections of insulation to see if it would seal
itself, under pressure from the expanding gases, as it has in
short-duration tests.
   A second flaw was placed in the adhesive binding insulation
inside the case-to-nozzle joint. A tiny ``blowhole'' was created to
allow gases to reach the ``wiper'' O-ring, which was installed as
part of the new design to keep the adhesive in place. However, it
also acts as an additional seal to protect the primary and
secondary O-rings. In the short-duration tests, gases have hit the
wiper ring but have not gone past it.
   McDonald said the flaws were more severe than anything likely to
occur during manufacture or assembly.
   ``It is, indeed, a fail-safe. If at any time gas gets beyond the
point we expect it to, the joint still is going to perform,'' he
said.

   NASA today rescheduled the crucial
hot-fire test of shuttle Discovery's engines for Wednesday morning
after replacing the defective valve-sensor combination that caused
a last-second scrub last week.
   The test, in which all three of the shuttle's engines are fired,
was set for 7:30 a.m. EDT. Technicians will begin the countdown for
the test at 6:10 p.m. Tuesday.
   The shuttle's engines were to have been tested last Thursday,
but the sensor reported that a one-inch valve which circulates
coolant before firing had not closed to where it was supposed to
be. The engines' onboard computer, sensing a malfunction, aborted
the test before ignition.
   Technicians spent the weekend swapping out the mechanism. Today,
the blast doors that protect the shuttle during the firing were
being installed and scaffolding removed.
   The engines will be fired for 22 seconds with the shuttle bolted
firmly to the pad. The ship's two solid fuel booster rockets will
not be ignited.
   The firing tests not only the engines, but the entire countdown
process, the shuttle system and launch teams. It is a requirement
since no shuttle has flown in the more than 2{ years since the
Challenger explosion. Dicovery is being treated as if it were an
untried new ship.
   No date has been set for Discovery's launch with five astronauts
on board, but five postponements of the hot-fire test to date have
made it all but certain that NASA can't meet a late September
target.
   The sensor, which signals the valve's open-closed position to
the ship's onboard computer, gave a wrong reading last Thursday,
and the flight readiness firing test was aborted. Engineers
determined that the valve was in the proper position but decided to
replace both because they are in the same subassembly.
   That work was finished by midnight Saturday; crews spent Sunday
reconnecting lines and hoses and testing everything for leaks.

   Discovery moved into the glare of
spotlights early Monday on its long-awaited trip to the launch pad
and a giant step toward America's first space shuttle flight since
the Challenger tragedy.
   A flag-waving Fourth of July crowd of several hundred space
workers cheered as the 85-ton spaceship edged out of an assembly
building at 12:50 a.m., riding upright on the broad back of a giant
tracked transporter called a crawler.
   The 4.2-mile journey to Launch Pad 39B was scheduled to take six
to seven hours. Attached to Discovery were a 154-foot-tall external
fuel tank and the two 149-foot solid fuel booster rockets that will
hurl the craft into space on a flight scheduled for early September.
   As the rollout began, Kennedy Space Center director Forrest S.
McCartney presented astronaut Dave Hilmers, one of Discovery's five
assigned crew members, with an autograph book containing the names
of 15,240 engineers, technicians, managers, secretaries, clerical
workers and other center employees who have labored to return the
shuttle fleet to flight.
   The astronauts will carry the book into orbit with them.
   McCartney, Hilmers and other NASA officials watched the rollout
from a flag-bedecked grandstand outside the assembly building.
   The early morning move was planned to avoid thunderstorms and
lighting which are common during the day this time of the year.
   Center officials originally said all five of Discovery's
astronauts and NASA administrator James C. Fletcher would be here
for the rollout. But four of the crew members elected to spend the
holiday weekend with their families in Houston, and Fletcher's
office said Friday he couldn't make it.
   The failure of a seal in a booster rocket joint doomed
Challenger 73 seconds after it lifted off on Jan. 28, 1986. All
seven crew members perished in the massive explosion.
   Since then the booster has been significantly redesigned and
tested and hundreds of other modifications have been made to the
shuttle main engines and other systems.
   Once at the pad, Discovery will be readied for a critical July
24 test of modifications to the three main liquid-fuel engines.
With the spaceship bolted firmly to its launch mounts, the power
plant will be ignited for 19.4 seconds at the end of a practice
countdown.
   The following day, one final pre-flight test-firing of a
redesigned booster rocket is planned at the Morton Thiokol plant in
Utah. Both tests must be passed before Discovery is certified for
flight.
   On Sunday, a test of an intentionally damaged version of the
shuttle rocket's redesigned joint was apparently successful, Morton
Thiokol said. The test was conducted at a plant near Brigham City,
Utah.
   ``It appears no gas leaked outside the joint, in spite of the
very severe intentional flaws,'' said Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab.
``That has really raised our confidence for the (full-scale) test
at the end of the month.''
   The 1 p.m. MDT test was performed on a simulator that uses three
shortened rocket cases, two joints and 385 pounds of propellant to
mimic pressures present during when a full-scale rocket motor is
fired.
   Last week, NASA announced that it had changed the liftoff date
from late August to early September because it was taking longer
than expected to prepare Discovery for flight.
   Hilmers and four other veteran shuttle pilots will be at the
controls when Discovery blasts off to mark what NASA is counting on
to revive America's manned space program. The others are Commander
Rick Hauck, Dick Covey, Mike Lounge and George Nelson.
   During their four-day mission, the astronauts will deploy a
communications satellite, conduct scientific and technical
experiments and check out changes made to the orbiter systems.

   Discovery's successful launch pad
test firing shows it's ``a very good bird,'' the shuttle's chief
says, but NASA has two major hurdles to clear before its first
post-Challenger manned space flight.
   Both could be resolved in the next week, and if they are,
shuttle managers are expected to set a firm launch date of late
September or early October for the crew of five astronauts.
   ``I still think we still have a shot at late September,'' Robert
Crippen, deputy director of shuttle operations, said after
Wednesday's 22-second firing of Discovery's three main liquid fuel
engines.
   The remaining technical problems are the repair of a small gas
leak in Discovery's steering engine system and the final prelaunch
test of the redesigned solid fuel rocket booster that caused
Challenger's destruction 2{ years ago.
   Wednesday's firing not only tested the engines, but other
orbiter systems, countdown procedures and the launch team, which
has added several new faces since Challenger and its crew of seven
were lost in the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion.
   ``We proved it works,'' said Crippen, a 50-year-old Navy captain
who commanded the first space shuttle flight in 1981 and has been
on more shuttle flights than any other astronaut.
   ``It's a clear demonstration that Discovery is a very good
bird,'' added Thomas E. Utsman, director of shuttle management.
   The flawless firing was a spirit lifter for space workers here
who have had to overcome one problem after another since Discovery
was moved to the launch pad July 4.
   Mechanical and other difficulties had delayed the engine firing
five times, and, combined with the unresolved gas leak, pushed
Discovery's launch date off from early to late September, with
October a distinct possibility.
   Crippen said that while it would take several days to thoroughly
analyze test data, ``you can't have a major milestone like that
come out as clean as it did and not feel good about it.''
   He said the only question turned up in a preliminary look at
data was a possible leak of nitrogen gas in an area where fuel
lines join the external fuel tank. He said he did not think it was
a significant problem.
   Engineers will begin concentrating on the steering system leak
early next week when they climb into Discovery's cargo bay with a
plan to cut a hole in the rear bulkhead to gain access to an engine
compartment.
   The leak is in a fitting on a vent line, and the plan is to
clamp a clamshell-like device around it and fill it with a sealing
compound. The repair is expected to take about a week.
   The fifth and final full-scale test firing of the shuttle's
redesigned solid fuel booster rocket is set for Aug. 18 at the
Morton Thiokol plant near Brigham City, Utah.
   A faulty joint in Challenger's right booster allowed flame to
escape and triggered the explosion. The joint and other booster
systems have been thoroughly redesigned.
   The rocket in the Aug. 18 test will be deliberately flawed, with
grooves, cuts and debondings introduced in critical areas like
insulation and O-ring seals.
   ``It is a significant flaw demonstration test,'' said Crippen.
``Some say there is a risk in it, but we have to test the booster
to withstand these worst-case situations.''

   Seals in a revamped version of the shuttle
booster joint blamed for Challenger's destruction worked in a test
firing despite intentional flaws, helping Discovery pass its ``most
significant milestone,'' the rocket's manufacturer says.
   An analysis of the Aug. 18 test at Morton Thiokol Inc.'s
northern Utah plant found that the aft seal, though the worst
flawed deliberately, succeeded in preventing superhot gases from
escaping, the company said Thursday.
   The success of the test, the fifth and final qualifying firing
of the new 126-foot solid-fuel booster, was vital to NASA's plans
to resume shuttle missions grounded since the Challenger disaster
on Jan. 28, 1986.
   ``This may be the most critical milestone as far as getting us
back into space,'' said Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab. ``It's
certainly the most significant milestone we've had to pass in the
solid rocket motor design.''
   If the positive evaluation of the test holds, NASA officials
have said they expect to set a firm date late next month or in
early October for Discovery's mission, the first shuttle flight
since the Challenger accident.
   Engineers who took apart the booster's aft segment ``looked at
the intentional flaws and were very pleased to see that hot gases
had not blown by the primary O-ring, that it had sealed properly,''
said Ed Snow, another company spokesman.
   A presidential commission blamed a faulty aft joint on one of
Challenger's two boosters for the spacecraft's explosion shortly
after liftoff. A plume of superhot gas burned through a rubber-like
O-ring in the joint and caused Challenger's outside fuel tank to
explode, killing all seven astronauts.
   Meanwhile, the FBI and NASA are investigating what appear to
have been deliberate cuts in some O-ring seals destined for use in
shuttle boosters, but none of the damaged O-rings had been shipped
to Morton Thiokol, said James Dockstader, vice president of
operations for HydraPak Inc., the West Jordan, Utah, company that
produces the O-rings.
   None of HydraPak's 85 employees has been dismissed, Dockstader
said, but he would not say if any had been disciplined.
   The redesigned joint incorporates a so-called ``capture
feature'' designed to seal the rocket during liftoff, preventing
hot gases from escaping.
   Snow said Morton Thiokol and National Aeronautics and Space
Administration engineers will continue tearing down the
four-segment rocket over the next week and a half.
   Earlier this week, Morton Thiokol workers completed the first
stage of evaluating the test firing by disassembing the booster's
nozzle section.
   Engineers found no problems, declaring it ``the best nozzle
yet,'' Raab said.
   Last week's $20 million test culminated Morton Thiokol's 2{-year
redesign effort.
   For the test, two of the rocket's three field joints _ including
the aft joint, the case-to-nozzle joint and the igniter-to-case
joint _ were peppered with 14 intentional flaws intended to test
the booster's safety features to their limits. The aft joint was
the most flawed.
   Defects included separations in the insulation that holds the
joints together, and channels cut to allow the gases to reach the
joint's middle O-ring.
   The O-ring is one of three such seals in each joint designed to
contain heat generated by ignition of the rocket's 1.1 million
pounds of propellant during launch.

   NASA officials said Monday that a
new valve had tested out satisfactorily in the space shuttle
Discovery's engine compartment and they rescheduled the ship's
oft-postponed main engine test firing for Wednesday.
   The countdown for the test will begin at 6:10 p.m. EDT Tuesday.
The 22-second engine firing is set for 7:30 a.m.
   The engine test was halted Thursday in the last second when a
sensor reported that a valve had not closed as it was supposed to.
Engineers determined that the sensor, not the valve, was
malfunctioning but decided to replace both parts as a unit.
   That required erecting scaffolding, removing extensive plumbing
and wiring and gaining access to the crowded engine compartment.
The changeout was completed by midnight Saturday. The work of
reconnecting and testing all parts and removing the work platforms
was being completed Monday.
   ``Work on changing the hydrogen fuel bleed valve in Discovery's
number two main engine went better than expected over the
weekend,'' the space agency announced Monday, in setting the new
test date.
   ``The recovery from the problem on Thursday shows that the team
is working smoothly and I am expecting an on-time engine firing on
Wednesday morning,'' said Hugh Harris, a spokesman for NASA's
Kennedy Space Center.
   All three of Discovery's engines will be fired, using only a
portion of the half million gallons of fuel in the external tank,
while the shuttle remains bolted to the launch pad. The two solid
fuel rocket boosters flanking the shuttle tank will not be ignited.
   In the past, a flight readiness firing has been required only
for new shuttles, except for one time when a malfunction made a
retest necessary. But the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration is treating Discovery as an untried ship because of
the long time since the last flight and the many changes made since
the Challenger disaster.
   Challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch on Jan. 28, 1986,
with the loss of seven lives and there have been no American manned
missions since then. A leak in Challenger's right booster was
blamed for the accident. The boosters have been redesigned to
prevent a recurrence.
   Discovery's test-firing has been postponed five times for
various malfunctions, including leaks in ground equipment and last
wee's abort.
   No date has been set for Discovery's four-day flight with five
astronauts aboard, but the delays have made it all but certain that
NASA can't meet a late September target.

   Morton Thiokol conducted a full-scale
test of a space shuttle booster rocket with deliberately flawed
seals today to see whether hot gases would penetrate the joints as
they did when the Challenger exploded.
   ``It looked good. We've got to wait and see the data, but you
always like to see it go off on time and see it run 120 seconds,''
said J..R. Thompson, director of NASA's Marshall Space Flight
Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   ``If we get good results, then we'll press on at the Cape,'' he
said, referring to preparations for a mid-August launch of the
shuttle Discovery at Cape Canaveral.
   The two-minute firing of the 126-foot-long, 1.2 million-pound
booster at 11 a.m. was the third in a series of five full-scale
tests scheduled before the shuttle returns to space.
   The test was designed to reveal any weaknesses in the new
booster, which was redesigned following the Jan. 28, 1986,
explosion of the shuttle Challenger that killed seven astronauts.
   For the test, the rocket was assembled with deliberate flaws in
the sealing material of two joints to see if hot gases would
penetrate them. Flawed seals have been tested previously in
short-duration tests, but never in a full-scale firing, Raab said.
   A plume of bright yellow flame erupted from the rocket, sending
a cloud of grayish-brown smoke and dust billowing hundreds of feet
in the air. Cattle grazing nearby bolted at the roar and hundreds
of company workers and school children cheered and applauded.
   Company engineers and NASA officials planned a briefing after
they conduct a preliminary inspection of the prone rocket. A
detailed analysis of the results was several days away.
   The Challenger disaster was blamed on a booster rocket joint
improperly sealed by a rubber O-ring, which allowed hot gases to
escape and ignite the shuttle's external fuel tank.
   The redesigned joint has a third O-ring to protect the primary
O-ring from hot gases. The old joint had two rings. A gap between
sections of insulation in the old joint is now filled with putty.
   Engineers also have added a metal lip, called the capture
feature, that rests between the insulation and the O-rings. The lip
is designed to prevent the joint from bulging under the pressure of
burning gases during launch.

   The remaining full-scale tests are scheduled for June and July.
If all goes well, the shuttle's first post-Challenger launch is set
for sometime in mid-August.
   The test comes at a critical time for Thiokol. The company is
NASA's sole supplier of booster rockets, and views a successful
launch as a sign that the stigma of the Challenger tragedy can be
set aside.
   While praising Thiokol's work in the redesign effort, NASA also
has asked Congress for a $1.2 million government plant to build
advanced space shuttle booster rockets. The space agency wants the
proposed plant to be accessible by rail and water, which would
exclude Thiokol's plant in land-locked Utah.

   Morton Thiokol Inc. test-fired its
redesigned solid fuel booster rocket Tuesday with no apparent
problems in the second-to-last test before shuttle flights are to
resume.
   ``All indications are we had an excellent test,'' said Royce
Mitchell, solid rocket program manager for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration. ``Everything went smoothly. The motor
performed very, very well.''
   Brilliant yellow flame erupted from the 126-foot-long rocket and
grayish-brown smoke billowed thousands of feet into the air amid a
roar that could be heard for miles.
   The 122-second horizontal test, conducted at 1 p.m. MDT at
Morton Thiokol's Wasatch Operations plant west of here, was the
fourth of five tests required to qualify major design features of
the solid fuel booster before the shuttle program, grounded after
the 1986 Challenger disaster, can resume.
   ``We've got a lot of work to do,'' said J.R. Thompson, director
of the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. ``Barring
some surprise, I feel very good about'' an August launch.
   Allen McDonald, Morton Thiokol vice president of engineering,
said preliminary data indicated that the motor successfully
withstood the simulated liftoff and flight stresses.
   ``From all aspects, we can say it was a totally successful
test,'' McDonald said. ``I hope it looks as good from the inside as
it does on the outside.''
   ``It's an extremely good test,'' Mitchell said.
   He said engineers will spend the next two days studying computer
readouts of the test and disassembling the motor, and officials
expect to have a complete analysis within two weeks.
   Fifteen minutes after the test, a nozzle exit cone toppled from
the rear of the motor to simulate its separation from the motor
during a flight.
   NASA has scheduled an Aug. 31 launch of the shuttle Discovery.
   The booster tested Tuesday was free of planned flaws introduced
in previous tests to determine whether the joint can withstand the
intense heat and pressures of launch even in the event of some
failures, Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab said.
   It also was the first use of a new $22 million test stand, which
has 1,216 channels of instrumentation and uses hydraulic struts to
duplicate steering, flight turbulence and other stresses the motor
will endure during launch, he said.
   The building also can heat an entire motor to 110 degrees
Fahrenheit or cool it to 20 degrees. The rocket's 1.1 million
pounds of propellant has been heated to a uniform 90 degrees, or
about 20 degrees warmer than the usual launch temperature, to allow
engineers to test its performance at the upper limit for an actual
launch, Raab said.
   David Ewing, deputy director of program management for Morton
Thiokol, said the hydraulic struts that duplicate launch stresses
are based on ``the worst-case sideloads'' experienced in past
shuttle flights.
   During launch the boosters flex about 26 inches at the tip,
creating a ``twang,'' he said. The test simulated those pressures
on the rocket motor's joints.
   The Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986, was blamed on a
faulty booster joint that allowed a plume of superhot gas to snake
through an O-ring, triggering the blast that killed the seven crew
members.
   The new joint incorporates three Viton O-rings instead of two, a
metal lip to help hold the joint together and an adhesively bonded
relief slot that reduces stresses and increases the sealing action
of the bonded surface under pressure, Raab said.
   Moreover, the rocket's three field joints are equipped with
heaters to maintain a minimum temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit.
Sub-freezing temperatures the night before the doomed Challenger
launch were found to have contributed to the failure of the joint.
   For the experiment simulating the nozzle exit cone's separation
during flight, the test device was fitted with an explosive
severance system activated 15 minutes after the test.
   Dozens of visitors from Chicago-based Morton Thiokol, NASA and
various subcontractors were at the remote desert plant to watch
Tuesday's test.
   The final full-scale test is scheduled for some time in July. At
that time, severe flaws will be introduced in the joints ``to test
the system to its limits,'' Raab said.
   Testing of the redesigned motor has gone so well, he said, that
Discovery's two boosters were hooked up Friday with an external
fuel tank at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and the stack was to be joined
with the shuttle Thursday.

   NASA computers aborted the
test-firing of space shuttle Discovery's engines a fraction of a
second before ignition today after reporting a valve problem,
marking another disappointment for the space program.
   Engineers hoped to ready the shuttle for another attempt on
Sunday, but one official said the delay could be as much as a week.
The delay threatened to push back further the first post-Challenger
launch, planned for late September.
   It was the fifth such postponement in two weeks. The test is
considered crucial for qualifying Discovery for the first shuttle
flight since the Challenger explosion 2{ years ago.
   ``That's why we have flight readiness firings, to work the bugs
out of equipment before we launch,'' said NASA administrator James
Fletcher.
   Discovery's three main engines, generating total thrust of 1.1
million pounds, were to fire for 20 seconds in a test of the entire
shuttle system. Steel bolts were to hold the spaceship firmly on
the pad during the firing.
   The engines were to have begun firing six seconds before the
zero mark. The shutdown came just after the ``go'' for starting the
engines was issued but before ignition actually began, launch
control center commentator Hugh Harris said.
   Harris said the shuttle's master computer ``did not see that the
engine bleed valve had fully closed'' and automatically sent a
shutdown signal.
   Engineers were trying to determine if there was a faulty valve
or if the sensor had given an incorrect reading, he said. The bleed
valve vents excess gases.
   If the engines had fired with the valve open, excess pressure
might have built up in the fuel line and caused a rupture that
could had led to an explosion, said Joseph Lombardo, the main
engine program manager.
   If the problem is with the valve or a sensor, Discovery's flow
director, John Talone, said the delay could be between three and
seven days while the faulty equipment is replaced.
   If the problem can be corrected by simply changing computer
software, Talone said, the turnaround time could be cut to three
days.
   Immediately after the shutdown, the launch team remotely began
to make the vehicle safe as it sat on the pad, its 154-foot-tall
tank loaded with 385,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and 143,000
gallons of liquid oxygen, Harris said.
   He said the propellants would be drained from the tank, and the
igniters in each engine would have to be replaced before another
attempt.
   Engine No. 2, where the problem occurred, is one of two brand
new engines on Discovery. Engine No. 1 has been flown on three
shuttle missions.
   Program managers have been grooming Discovery for the first
shuttle flight since the loss of Challenger and its crew of seven
in an explosion 73 seconds after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Even before today many officials believed the launch would slip
into October because of earlier delays in the test and an
unresolved gas leak in a steering engine system that is separate
from the main engines.
   Launch director Bob Sieck said Wednesday that a one-day delay in
the firing test would move back the launch one day.
   Among the disappointed observers today were two of the five
astronauts slated to fly Discovery on the first post-Challenger
mission, Navy Capt. Rick Hauck and Marine Lt. Col. Dave Hilmers.
   Soon after the test firing, shuttle managers expect to give the
go-ahead to a plan for engineers to cut a hole through the rear
wall of Discovery's cargo bay in an effort to reach and repair a
nitrogen tetroxide leak.
   The shuttle program also must pass another key propulsion test
before Discovery can be certified for flight: a full-scale firing,
the fifth in a series, of the redesigned solid fuel booster rocket
at the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah. It is scheduled about Aug. 20.
   The Challenger explosion was blamed on a faulty booster rocket
joint that allowed flame to escape and ignite the external fuel
tank.

   A computer spotted a valve problem
and scrubbed NASA's test firing of space shuttle Discovery's
engines in the final second Thursday, dealing another setback to
America's 2{-year effort to return to space.
   Engineers said it will be three to seven days before they can
try the test again. The postponement was the fifth in two weeks and
made it almost certain that Discovery's flight will be delayed from
late September into October.
   ``That's why we have flight readiness firings, to work the bugs
out of equipment before we launch,'' said James Fletcher, the
administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   No American has been launched into space since the shuttle
Challenger exploded 73 seconds after liftoff Jan. 28, 1986, killing
seven crew members.
   The problem Thursday either was a valve that didn't close as
fast as it was supposed to or a sensor that gave a wrong reading of
the valve's open-closed position.
   ``We don't know whether it was a faulty indication or really a
malfunction in the valve,'' said Joseph A. Lombardo, engine program
director at NASA's propulsion facility in Mississippi.
   Engineers were looking at the possibility that the sensor might
have been affected by long exposure to the extreme cold of the
liquid hydrogen fuel. The tanks were loaded for 10 hours, four
hours longer than normal, so that special tests could be run on the
fuel system.
   To remain liquid, hydrogen must be kept at 423 degrees below
zero.
   Boyce Mix, engine manager at NASA's Mississippi engine test
facility, said historically some sensors are more
temperature-sensitive than others.
   As the tanks were being drained, he said, the valve was tested
and it worked sluggishly the first time but normally after it
warmed up.
   The computer, which controls all operations in the final 31
seconds of a launch countdown, received an indication that the
valve still was partially open, which would allow high-pressure
gases to enter areas unable to accommodate them, possibly causing a
rupture and explosion. The computer reacted as it was supposed to.
   ``The actual start commands to the engine were never given,''
Lombardo said. ``The incident that occurred was not that we had a
start failure of the main engines but that we had a failure to
start.''
   If the sensor is at fault, Lombardo said, a change in computer
commands might be a way around the problem. Swapping out the sensor
and the valve could take three days to a week, said John J. Talone,
who manages scheduling for Discovery.
   ``We just don't have all the answers this early,'' Lombardo said.
   The valve operated perfectly in earlier tests but ``sluggishness
is what we determined today,'' he said.
   During the test, the shuttle is secured to the pad by bolts
three inches in diameter and three feet long. The two solid booster
rockets that flank the orbiter and the huge fuel tank are not fired
in the test.
   If all had gone well, the shuttle's three main engines should
have fired for 20 seconds _ the major test before committing a
shuttle to flight. Two of the engines _ including the one with the
valve problem _ had not flown before. The third had been used on
four missions.
   At least two days is required to drain more than a half-million
gallons of fuel from the shuttle tank and to refill them. But
Talone said an extra day was added to the minimum time to give
crews a rest.
   In the past two weeks, officials had made four other attempts to
prepare the shuttle for the flight readiness test. All failed
because of faults in the ground servicing equipment.
   NASA had hoped to launch Discovery in late September, but even
before the test abort, many officials believed the launch would
slip into October because of earlier delays and an unresolved gas
leak in a steering engine system that is separate from the main
engines.
   Launch director Bob Sieck has said each day of delay in the
firing test would move back the launch by one day.
   Among the disappointed observers Thursday were two of the five
astronauts slated to fly Discovery, Navy Capt. Rick Hauck and
Marine Lt. Col. Dave Hilmers.
   ``Although we were disappointed today's test did not go full
term, we were impressed with the professional manner in which the
launch team responded to the situation,'' Hauck said, in a
statement distributed by NASA.
   The shuttle program also must pass another key propulsion test
before Discovery is OK'd for flight: a full-scale firing, the fifth
in a series, of the redesigned solid fuel booster rocket at the
Morton Thiokol plant in Utah. It is scheduled for Aug. 20.

   Space shuttle Discovery was linked
Friday to the two solid fuel booster rockets that are to hurl it
into space this summer on the first post-Challenger shuttle mission.
   A giant overhead crane hoisted the 85-ton spaceship on a metal
sling and gingerly guided it into position for mating with the
126-foot-tall boosters and a 154-foot fuel tank that will feed the
craft's three liquid fuel engines.
   NASA workers then made electrical, fuel line and other
connections. On Sunday, they will begin testing the connections.
   Barring problems, Discovery will be transported to the launch
pad in the glare of powerful floodlights Friday, starting at 12:01
a.m. The ship's five-man astronaut crew and NASA officials will
participate in the rollout ceremony from a flag-bedecked grandstand
outside the shuttle assembly building.
   Forrest McCartney, director of the Kennedy Space Center, will
present the astronauts with an autograph book which they will carry
into space on their four-day mission. The book contains the
signatures of the 15,000 center workers here who have labored to
return the shuttle fleet to space.
   McCartney has invited center workers and their families to drive
their personal cars onto the spaceport that day for a drive around
the launch pad to view Discovery there.
   Discovery's linkup with the boosters was delayed more than a day
while engineers overcame a problem with a mechanism controlling the
landing wheel doors in Discovery's nose.
   The shuttle was moved into the assembly building Tuesday after
undergoing an extensive overhaul of several of its systems, many of
the changes the result of the Challenger explosion that killed
seven astronauts shortly after liftoff on Jan. 28, 1986.
   The disaster was blamed on a faulty joint in one of Challenger's
solid fuel boosters. The joint has been redesigned and has passed
four test-firings, with one more set for July 26 before Discovery
is cleared for flight.
   The three main engines also must undergo a pre-flight test. That
20-second firing, with Discovery bolted on the pad, is set for July
22.
   The current launch target date is Sept. 3 but officials say
there is a chance liftoff could occur in late August.
   During the flight, commander Rick Hauck and his crew will deploy
a communications satelite, conduct science and technology
experimets and test modifications made to the shuttle. The other
crew members are Dick Covey, Mike Lounge, George Nelson and David
Hilmers.

   An old-model nozzle inlet ring was
used in the final test of Morton Thiokol's redesigned space shuttle
booster rocket, but NASA doesn't believe the discovery will delay
next week's scheduled shuttle launch, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   NASA spokesman Ed Medal said it had not yet been determined if
the outdated ring was used in the two boosters attached to the
space shuttle Discovery, scheduled for launch Sept. 29, but
preliminary investigation showed it had not.
   ``There's no indication that the old configuration is in the
boosters (in Discovery). But we've got to go ahead and check the
records and clear that,'' Medal said.
   ``We certainly don't believe the situation will impact the
launch, though,'' Medal said at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Ala., which oversees the booster rocket contract.
   Asked how the ring with the old design might have been installed
on the test rocket, he said, ``We're taking a long, hard look at
how the old ring got there. One of the leading possibilities is a
cross labeling of parts.''
   Medal said it is necessary to check records because actually
searching through Discovery for the ring would be too difficult.
   ``We are going through the records and checking to clear the
boosters for flight. If one of the old inlet rings was there, there
would be no safety issue for flight. The old design worked
perfectly well on all space shuttle flights. The modification was a
very minor one,'' Medal said.
   The ring, located inside the nozzle assembly at the tail of the
shuttle booster, was redesigned for production models of the solid
rocket motors.
   But for some reason the nozzle installed in the Aug. 18 test
booster contained a ring of the old, pre-Challenger design, Medal
said.
   ``It is true that a nozzle forward nose ring, not of the
redesigned solid rocket motor design, the RSRM design, was
inadvertently installed in the PV-1 (Production Verification Motor,
fired Aug. 18),'' said Ed Snow, a Morton Thiokol spokesman at
Ogden, reading a prepared company statement.
   ``The forward nose ring performed satisfactorily. The error was
discovered during regular post-test examination and analysis of the
part. NASA and Morton Thiokol are working to discover how the error
was made and how it can be prevented in the future,'' the statement
said.
   Medal said he believed the mistake was discovered within the
last day or two.
   Barbara Selby, a spokeswoman at NASA headquarters in Washington,
said space agency officials now are concentrating on trying to
determine if the old ring, or the redesigned ring was installed in
the rockets on the launch pad.
   She said no decision would be made about the effects on the
launch until this was known, but added: ``When I left, they didn't
think it would cause a postponement.''
   A firm decision on that may come on Thursday, she said.
   ``We fully believe the correct parts are in the flight set,''
company spokesman Rocky Raab told the Associated Press. ``We and
NASA are researching the record, the documents, to make sure they
are the correct parts. Even if they were not, they would not affect
the safety of the flight.''
   Raab said the discovery was made during X-ray analysis of the
part after the test firing. ``There is no visible difference
between the two parts,'' he said.
   Raab said the search would include X-rays of the nozzle rings on
the Discovery booster and engineers should have an answer within
days.
   ``We expect to be able to tell that by two days before launch,
and perhaps sooner, but certainly by then,'' he said.
   The Aug. 18 test, the fifth full-scale static firing of the
redesigned booster, was conducted at Thiokol's Wasatch Operations
plant 25 miles west of Brigham City under NASA and Thiokol
supervision.
   After the test, engineers disassembled the rocket and began a
lengthy process of examining it. NASA later pronounced the test a
success and certified Discovery for launch.
   Most of the booster redesign was aimed at making the rocket
safer. A faulty O-ring seal on one of the booster segments was
blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the space shuttle
Challenger, which grounded the nation's manned space program.
   Medal said that uder the old design, the flame from the rocket
hit the ablative carbon cloth fabric on the ring at an angle of 90
degrees. Under the new design, it hits at an angle of 45 degrees.
   ``That's slightly improves the ablative tolerance of the ring,''
he said.
   An ablative substance melts off in layers when hit by the rocket
flame, protecting the ring and preventing it from burning through.
   He said these parts are not marked for technical reasons. ``The
old design ring certainly did not affect that test in August,'' he
said.

   Engineers today sought the source of
a small gas leak in a space shuttle steering engine, a new problem
NASA officials said could further delay the first shuttle flight
since the Challenger explosion.
   Experts were probing deep into Discovery's left Orbital
Maneuvering System engine pod in an effort to locate the leak. But
the leak was so tiny it was difficult to isolate, and the process
could take several days, said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
   Launch pad workers detected an odor of nitrogen tetroxide gas
Friday while preparing Discovery for its planned early September
launch, she said. It was in a pod covering one of the two engines
used to maneuver the shuttle in orbit.
   Nitrogen tetroxide serves as an oxidizer in the engines,
providing oxygen to ignite the fuel when the shuttle is in
oxygen-poor space.
   Officials could not say whether the leak would further delay the
launch, already postponed several times since NASA set a liftoff
date for last February, Malone said.
   ``It will depend on where the leak is and how severe it is,''
Malone said.
   Officials said they believed the leak was in one of three
places: a power valve, an oxidizer tank filter or a jet thruster.
   If the leak is too inaccessible to be repaired on the pad,
Malone said Discovery might have to be returned to an assembly
building, a move officials estimated could delay the launch by
several weeks.
   When initially detected, the leak rate was 15 parts per million,
considered very minor, Malone said. The rate later dropped to 3 or
4 ppm, she said.
   Discovery is being readied for the first space shuttle flight
since the Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts 2{
years ago.
   Elsewhere, engineers at the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah
continue to inspect a solid fuel booster rocket damaged last week
when a joint was mistakenly overpressurized.
   A ground test-firing of the rocket has been delayed from late
July until at least mid-August while experts consider what repairs
have to be made.
   The test, the fifth full-scale firing of the redesigned rocket,
is considered essential before Discovery can be committed to
flight. A faulty booster rocket joint triggered the Challenger
explosion.

After Test Firing Breaks Rocket Nozzle

   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it indefinitely postponed the next launch of the space shuttle after a section of the redesigned rocket motor broke off during a test.

   NASA didn't estimate how long the rocket problem would set back the launch, which had been scheduled for June 2.
The space agency, which fired the rocket last Wednesday, said it only recently discovered that a portion of a nozzle had broken off.
The rocket nozzles are important because they steer the rocket during takeoff.

   David Winterhalter, NASA's director of systems engineering and analysis, said the launch delay would likely be measured in "weeks, not days."
He said about one-third of a membrane that anchors a nozzle component broke off.
Should that happen in flight, he said, it could mean that the nozzle would be unable to move or, in the worst case, hot gases could leak and explode.
Neither happened during the test, he added.

   NASA said it didn't know yet what caused the nozzle problem, but said it was unrelated to the O-ring joints, which join the sections of the rocket and which failed during the Challenger disaster nearly two years ago.
NASA said the redesigned joints had operated properly during the test.

   Morton Thiokol Inc., which built the booster rockets for the Challenger, is redesigning the rocket to be used when shuttle flights resume.
Separately, four Morton Thiokol workers were killed and one was seriously injured in a fire that destroyed an MX missile plant in Utah.

   A NASA official said booster rocket segments that were to be used in the June launch were scheduled to begin arriving at the Kennedy Space Center from Morton Thiokol on Jan. 6, and their assembly was to begin on Jan. 27.
But he added that until NASA understands what went wrong in the recent test, the booster rockets would be held at Morton Thiokol's Utah plant.

   A NASA spokeswoman said that the nozzle part that failed in the test was redesigned after the Challenger disaster because of previous problems with it.
But those flaws, she said, didn't play a role in the shuttle accident.

   The shuttle program has been stalled since the Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, 74 seconds after liftoff, killing its seven crew members.
The disaster, which was followed closely by launch failures of NASA and Air Force unmanned rockets, crippled the country's ability to launch satellites and severely undermined NASA's credibility.

   Since that time, the government has been pushing private companies to move into the satellite launch business, using unmanned rockets.
French and Chinese rocket launch companies also have moved to fill launch demand.
The redesigned shuttle, once it begins regular flights, is expected to be largely devoted to military cargo.

   A Morton Thiokol spokesman declined to comment on the incident.
He said the company wouldn't elaborate on NASA's statement.

   A new countdown begins tonight for a
22-second firing of space shuttle Discovery's three main engines, a
vital test that has been postponed five times because of
malfunctions.
   If this test succeeds, NASA officials will set a date for the
first American manned space flight since the Challenger burst into
flames on liftoff in January 1986. The Discovery launch date,
already officially moved four times, is not likely to be before
October because of all the test delays.
   The flight readiness firing, as it's called, is an overall
workout of the main engines, computer software, ground support
equipment, communications lines and the launch teams.
   The ``call to stations'' that begins the countdown was scheduled
for 6:10 p.m. with the test set for 7:30 a.m. Wednesday. Without
further problems, fueling of the shuttle's huge tank begins a half
hour before midnight.
   The shuttle's No. 2 engine is fitted with a new ``hydrogen bleed
valve'' and sensor to replace units that caused a scheduled test to
be scrapped last Thursday in the split second before the start of
ignition.
   ``The recovery from the problem on Thursday shows that the team
is working smoothly and I am expecting an on-time engine firing on
Wednesday morning,'' said Hugh Harris, a spokesman for NASA's
Kennedy Space Center.
   Discovery's three engines will be fired with slightly different
start and stop times, using only a portion of the half million
gallons of fuel in the external tank.
   Bolts 3 feet long and 3 inches in diameter hold the shuttle to
the pad while the engines generate 1.1 million pounds of thrust.
   The two solid fuel rocket boosters flanking the shuttle tank
will not be ignited but will be subjected to the same bending
movements that led to a leak in one of the joints during
Challenger's liftoff. That leak allowed flame to escape and led to
the shuttle's destruction and the deaths of seven astronauts.
   Flight readiness firings have been required in the past for new
shuttles only, except for one time when a malfunction made a retest
necessary. But the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is
treating Discovery as an untried ship because of the long time
since the last flight and the many changes since the Challenger
disaster.
   Last Thursday's engine test was aborted in the last second when
a sensor reported that a valve had not closed as it was supposed
to. Engineers determined that the sensor, not the valve, was
malfunctioning but decided to replace both parts.
   The designer of the shuttle rocket booster, meanwhile, announced
Monday that the last of five full-scale test-firings for the
booster will be held Aug. 18.
   The fifth in the series of firings of the 126-foot-long
redesigned rocket will be conducted at Morton Thiokol Inc.'s
northern Utah plant.

   An intentionally flawed space shuttle
booster rocket performed successfully Thursday in the last
test-firing required before the resumption of manned U.S. space
flights, officials said.
   ``We're ready to go launch,'' Alan McDonald, Morton Thiokol vice
president for engineering, said on examining the booster after the
122-second, horizontal test.
   The $20 million firing was a ``redundancy verification test'' to
make sure the booster's new joints do what they're supposed to:
contain super-heated gases during launch. The failure of the seals
on one joint led to the explosion of shuttle Challenger and the
death of its seven-person crew in 1986.
   Engineers deemed the test a success after preliminary inspection
of the prone rocket. If that evaluation holds, and National
Aeronautics and Space Administration workers are able to plug a
tiny fuel leak in the shuttle Discovery, the space agency will be
able to set a firm date in late September or early October for the
first shuttle launch in 32 months.
   The fifth full-scale test of Morton Thiokol's redesigned booster
sent clouds of dust billowing thousands of feet in the air as some
300 NASA and company observers cheered.
   ``Fantastic! It looked really good. This is it,'' said John
Thirkill, vice president of space operations for Morton Thiokol.
   ``We have had no indication of any anomaly,'' said Royce
Mitchell, solid rocket motor project manager at the Marshall Space
Center in Huntsville, Ala. ``It looks like just an absolutely great
test from top to bottom. ... The end of September is still within
our sights.''
   Morton Thiokol and NASA engineers planned to begin tearing down
the motor Monday and expected final test results within two weeks,
said company spokesman Rocky Raab.
   McDonald said preliminary indications were that every safety
feature intended to prevent leakage had worked and there was no
immediate evidence of problems in any of the four flawed joints. He
said he believed the joints were the safest parts of the shuttle
launch vehicle.
   ``The hardware and the data will tell us this booster is ready
to fly,'' Mitchell said.
   With the $470 million redesign and motor testing, Morton Thiokol
has run five or six times the number of tests that were done prior
to the first shuttle launch, and in half the time, he said.
   David Ewing, the company's deputy director of program
management, called the redesign result ``very, very robust. We've
put on the belt and suspenders and we've even added garters.''
   The test firing at Morton Thiokol's test bay 25 miles west of
here capped the company's 2{-year effort to revamp the rocket
blamed for the January 1986 explosion that destroyed Challenger,
killed its seven-member crew and grounded the nation's space
program.
   Scores of improvements have been made to the 126-foot-long
booster, most related to reworking the field joints which hold
together the rocket's cylindrical segments.
   The Challenger explosion was blamed on a faulty joint that
allowed a plume of super-hot gas to burn through an O-ring seal and
ignite the main liquid fuel tank.
   For Thursday's booster test, two of the three field joints, the
case-to-nozzle joint and the igniter-to-case joint were riddled
with 14 flaws intended to test them to their limits as the rocket
burned 1.1 million pounds of propellant. The third joint was left
unflawed as a comparison.
   ``We're demonstrating that the motor is so fault-tolerant that
even with flaws that deliberately circumvent all the safety factors
that we've built in, it's still a safe motor,'' Raab said.
   Among the defects were separations in the bonded adhesive
insulation that helps hold the joints together, and channels cut
with an Exacto razor knife that would allow the fiery gas to reach
the joint's middle O-ring, one of three designed to contain heat
from the burning fuel.
   The joints were equipped with heaters that maintain their
temperatures at a minimum 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Freezing
temperatures the night before the doomed Challenger launch were
found to have contributed to the joint's failure.
   With the exception of the flaws, the rocket is virtually
identical to a production-quality version Morton Thiokol test-fired
June 14 and to the pair now attached to Discovery.
   The June 14 test, said Raab, was an ``unequivocal'' success, as
were the three that preceded it in the past year. Thursday's test
had been scheduled last month, but was delayed when a worker
over-pressurized a joint, causing slight damage that since has been
repaired.

<HEAD>Computer Glitch Halts Discovery Astronauts' Simulated Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A simulated shuttle mission
designed to test the Discovery astronauts' trouble-shooting skills
was halted just before a mock landing because of a real-life
computer crash, NASA officials said.
   The five astronauts were preparing to end their 56-hour mission
Thursday afternoon by simulating a shuttle landing with a flat tire
when the computer shutdown cut the rehearsal short.
   ``I'm sure they'll be looking at it to see why it went down, but
nobody here considers it to be a big problem that the simulation
ended early,'' said NASA Johnson Space Center spokesman James
Hartsfield.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials stressed
that there was no problem with any kind of computer used in actual
flight control.
   In Huntsville, Ala., meanwhile, engineers at Marshall Space
Flight Center said Thursday's fifth and final test of seals and
joints on the space shuttle booster rocket lifted their confidence
in parts redesigned after the Challenger disaster.
   ``Based on all appearances the test was a complete success,''
said Jim Thomas, technical assistant to the manager of the solid
rocket motor project.
   The two-minute static test firing, with the booster segment
anchored in a $25 million test stand, put launch-style pressure on
the redesigned joints.
   The seals are designed to keep internal hot gases inside the
twin rockets that help kick shuttles into earth orbit. The failure
of a joint in one of Challenger's two boosters was blamed for the
January 1986 explosion that killed all seven crew members.
   Before the computer crash at Johnson Space Center, officials
said, the Discovery crew handled all the simulated problems posed
to them during a dress rehearsal for their flight, which is slated
for late September or early October.
   The 56-hour mock mission began about an hour late Tuesday
morning because of an earlier problem with the shuttle simulator.
   But other glitches faced by the Discovery crew were intentional,
as commander Rick Hauck, pilot Richard Covey and mission
specialists David Hilmers, Mike Lounge and George Nelson were
placed in situations designed to test their ability to solve a
multitude of problems that could encounter on an actual mission.
   Shortly after launch Tuesday, the astronauts were forced to
alter their course and enter a low orbit after NASA trainers staged
a main engine failure.
   On Wednesday, Nelson and Lounge had to go outside the orbiter to
fix a stuck tilt-table needed to deploy a $100 million
communications satellite. That simulation was done in a water tank,
spokeswoman Barbara Selby said.

<HEAD>Third Full-Scale Test-Firing Set Wednesday For Redesigned Shuttle
Booster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The third full-scale test firing of
the redesigned space shuttle booster rocket will be conducted
Wednesday, Morton Thiokol Inc. announced.
   Morton Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab said the 1 p.m. horizontal
firing of the 126-foot-long rocket will last two minutes. The
booster, 12 feet in diameter, contains 1.1 million pounds of
propellant.
   During the second full-scale firing on Dec. 23, the rocket's
NASA-designed nozzle boot ring broke apart. The boot ring, about
two inches thick, protects a flexible bearing that allows the
nozzle to swivel and steer the rocket.
   Company officials said the test will incorporate the nozzle boot
ring designed by Morton Thiokol which performed successfully during
the first full-scale test last August.
   Wednesday's firing, although the third of its kind at the
Wasatch Operations test site, is the first of three required to
qualify the new booster for flight. Subsequent tests are scheduled
June 3 and July 6.
   The August and December tests evaluated primary and alternate
elements of solid rocket motor design, Raab said.
   He said the center field joint on the motor to be tested next
week has been assembled with an ``intentional manufacturing-type
flaw'' in the bonded insulation's J-seal.
   ``This defect may allow hot gases to penetrate the bonded
insulation'' and reach an O-ring barrier, but Raab added that
short-duration test firings with similar defects have shown that
such defects tend to seal under motor pressure, preventing the
release of gases.
   The escape of such super-hot gases from a Morton Thiokol booster
was blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the shuttle
Challenger and deaths of its seven crew members.
   The resumption of shuttle missions is tentatively scheduled for
Aug. 4, although NASA officials have said technical problems could
further delay the launch.

   NASA is taking a slow, cautious
approach in returning space shuttles to flight, but a leading
shuttle engineer says that doesn't mean anyone at the agency is
afraid to fly.
   ``I don't see anybody in the decision-making process who is
reticent about pressing on and let's get back in the air. ...
Personally, I have no hestitancy about returning to flight,'' John
Thomas said Monday.
   Thomas is manager of the team that has redesigned and is testing
the solid fuel booster rocket that caused the shuttle Challenger
explosion 26 months ago. The accident killed the seven crew
members, and the remainder of the fleet has been grounded while
NASA tests the redesigned booster joint.
   Workers here have begun assembling the first of the two booster
rockets intended to propel the shuttle Discovery into space when
flights resume. NASA has set a launch date of Aug. 4.
   ``We've been very careful with our design and test programs and
we've been very cautious in the assembly process,'' Thomas said at
a news conference at the Marshall Space Flight Center, in
Huntsville, Ala., which was monitored by reporters here.
   Thomas said the redesign test program has gone so well that the
stacking of the rocket segments could proceed with confidence even
though three critical test firings remain for the overhauled model
of the rocket.
   ``We're well on our way in the test program,'' he said.
``Everything is going well with the processing at the Kennedy Space
Center.''
   On May 1, the two boosters are to be mated with the huge
external fuel tank, and on May 14, Discovery will be attached to
the stack. Rollout to the launch pad is set for May 24, and a
20-second on-the-pad firing of the shuttle's three main engines is
scheduled for June 15, leading to the Aug. 4 launch with a crew of
five.
   Thomas said three more full-scale tests of the redesigned
booster must be accomplished successfully before Discovery can fly.
They are scheduled for April 20, June 3 and mid-July at the Brigham
City, Utah, facility of the manufacturer, Morton Thiokol.
   Asked if there was anything that could delay the August launch
date, Thomas said, ``We have a very ambitious processing flow down
at the Cape, and we could always stub our toe someplace along the
way ... or have something unusual turn up in the test program.
   ``But I don't see anything now that would prevent an August
launch.''

   More than 2{ years after a flawed
booster rocket joint doomed the Challenger, the redesigned part is
``the safest thing on the space shuttle'' and elated engineers say
the craft is ready to launch.
   Meanwhile, technicians at Cape Canaveral, Fla., bolted a clamp
over a gas leak on the Discovery and applied a sealing compound
today as they worked to clear one of the last remaining hurdles to
liftoff.
   NASA spokeswoman Pat Phillips said the compound would have to
set for several hours, then workers would run pressure checks over
the weekend to determine how well the seal worked.
   NASA and Morton Thiokol hailed Thursday's performance of a
deliberately flawed booster in the last in a series of five
test-firings required before Discovery can proceed with its
scheduled flight this fall.
   ``Fantastic! It looked really good. This is it,'' said John
Thirkill, vice president of space operations for the company, which
designs the booster rockets.
   ``We're ready to go launch,'' said Allan McDonald, Morton
Thiokol's vice president of engineering, after inspecting the
126-foot-long booster following the two-minute horizontal test.
   The test culminated a $470 million effort to correct a faulty
joint seal that on Jan. 28, 1986, allowed a plume of fiery gas to
escape, triggering the explosion that killed Challenger's seven
crew members.
   ``It's been a long 2{ years. We did what we said we were going
to do, and yet it seems like yesterday that it happened,'' said
McDonald, who had argued before the Challenger launch that cold
temperatures would imperil the craft.
   Investigators later found that freezing temperatures the night
before contributed to the failure of one of the three joints used
to hold the rocket's cylindrical cases together.
   ``I think the (redesign program) went far beyond what anybody
anticipated it would do, as a result of that failure 2{ years
ago,'' McDonald said. ``We built in a joint that is clearly, in my
mind, the safest thing on the space shuttle vehicle.''
   For Thursday's booster test, two of the three joints, the
case-to-nozzle joint and the igniter-to-case joint, were riddled
with 14 intentional flaws intended to test them to their limits as
the rocket burned 1.1 million pounds of propellant. The third joint
was left unflawed as a comparison.
   Among the defects were separations in the bonded adhesive
insulation that helps hold the joints together, and channels cut
with a razor knife that would allow the fiery gas to reach the
joint's middle O-ring, one of three designed to contain heat from
the burning fuel.
   The flaws were introduced to prove the new joints would contain
the gas despite defects far more severe than any that could escape
Morton Thiokol's inspection process, said company spokesman Rocky
Raab.
   After the test, which sent clouds of dust and smoke billowing
thousands of feet in the air and shook the ground at an observation
station 9,000 feet away, some 300 NASA and company observers
cheered.
   Engineers deemed the $20 million test a success after a
preliminary inspection. If the evaluation holds, and NASA workers
can plug the fuel leak in Discovery, NASA officials will be able to
set a firm launch date in late September or early October, said
Royce Mitchell, solid rocket motor program manager at the Marshall
Space Center in Huntsville, Ala.
   ``It looks like just an absolutely great test from top to
bottom,'' he said. ``The end of September is still within our
sights.''
   Progress appeared to be made today in fixing the hard-to-reach
fuel leak.
   With the Discovery upright on its launch pad, technicians
squeezed into the ship's cramped cargo bay to attach a
clamshell-like clamp on a half-inch diameter line that was detected
leaking nitrogen tetroxide gas more than a month ago.
   Once the 2-inch device was in place, the workers began filling
it, under pressure, with a sealing compound.
   Morton Thiokol and NASA engineers planned to begin disassembling
the motor Monday and expected final test results within two weeks,
Raab said.
   McDonald said preliminary indications were that every safety
feature intended to prevent leakage had worked and there was no
immediate evidence of problems in any of four flawed joints.
   ``The data says we got pressure where we wanted to get it and we
didn't get any pressure where we didn't want to get it. And that's
extremely good news,'' said Mitchell.
   With the motor testing and redesign, which included scores of
improvements to other components, Morton Thiokol has run five or
six times the number of tests that were done prior to the first
shuttle launch, and in half the time, he said.

   The first test of the redesigned space shuttle booster rocket engine became an embarrassment for Morton Thiokol Inc. when the company was forced to abort three separate countdowns before a large crowd of dignitaries and other spectators.

   In two of the tries at the crucial test, the countdown was stopped within 15 seconds of ignition.
A fourth attempt of the test wasn't expected until tomorrow.

   The failure to conduct the test -- regarded as a major hurdle for the space shuttle program -- was a setback for Morton Thiokol officials and appeared to underscore the difficulties of obtaining reliability in space technology.
When the countdown was cut short the third and final time, there was an audible groan from the spectators on the scene.
Morton Thiokol officials shook their heads.

   The object of the test -- the main element of the redesigned shuttle booster rocket, especially the joints holding the rocket segments together -- apparently wasn't at fault on any of the occasions.
Nevertheless, test officials were clearly dismayed that the countdown hadn't gone smoothly.
It was also another dose of bad news for the nation's space program.
"We're obviously disappointed," said one Thiokol executive.
The company had been at work on the redesigned engine for nearly 20 months and had prepared long in advance for the test.

   Company officials said the first countdown was stopped because of a malfunction in a water system designed to cool the rocket after the firing.
On the second occasion, computer systems weren't synchronized properly.
The third time, an auxiliary power unit that controls the rocket motor nozzles failed to pressurize properly nine seconds before iginition.
The last problem was one that would have forced the scrubbing of an actual space shuttle launch.

   U.E. Garrison, president of Morton Thiokol's aerospace division, said, "It's a very complicated test.
Literally hundreds of things have to operate properly."

   Space industry officials regard the scheduled test as a critical one for the space shuttle program.
A failure in the test most likely would force the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to postpone its goal of a June 1988 launch.
It also could severely damage the company's efforts to remain the major supplier of the shuttle boosters.

   It was also hoped that the test would be a boost to the sagging morale of Morton Thiokol employees.
Instead, it may have had just the opposite effect.

   The test is the first attempted firing of the redesigned shuttle engine with a full load of propellant.
The main feature of the new engine -- changed because of last year's explosion of the space shuttle Challenger -- are new joints that connect the four sections of the rocket.
A presidential commission concluded that cold temperature on the day of the Challenger launch in January 1986 caused two O-rings in one of the joints to contract, allowing hot gases to escape and ignite the shuttle's liquid fuel tank.

   Thousands of spectators focused on the 1.2 million-pound rocket, mounted on a horizontal test stand in a barren mountain setting here.
During the first countdown, a test official announced the proceedings over a loudspeaker.
Just after reaching 15 seconds, the official said "abort motor . . . emergency . . . shutdown."

   NASA and Thiokol officials immediately exited from a special viewing platform and disappeared from sight.

   The officials later returned to say that a hose had broken in the cooling system.
Following the malfunction, however, there appeared to be considerable confusion about when the test might be restarted and the schedule was repeatedly changed.

   The test was attempted again two hours later, but stopped early in the countdown because of the computer problems.
The third attempt occurred late in the day and appeared to frustrate company officials the most.
The culprit in the final attempt was a power unit -- formerly called a thrust-vector control -- supplied by United Space Boosters Inc.

   Morton Thiokol officials sought to play down the significance of the aborted tests, by calling it "disappointing, but not unusual."
Said Mr. Garrison: "We're not really panicked to get the test off."

   NASA officials also shook off questions about whether or not test officials had succumbed to the same sort of pressure that led to the misstaken decision to launch the Challenger in cold weather.
Adm. Richard Truly, the highest-ranking NASA official present at the test, said there was "no pressure to get the test off today."

   He added, however, that he was "frustrated" by the day's events.

   The aborted tests are bound to lead to renewed debate about the ultimate reliability of modern space technology.
Earlier this week, a solid-fuel rocket being developed by Morton Thiokol for the Delta launch vehicle flew along the ground after a motor failed during at test firing in Huntsville, Ala., according to wire service reports.

   Yesterday's scheduled firing was the first of several full-scale tests planned for the 126-foot-long rocket.
During the test, solid fuel in the rocket was to burn for almost two minutes.

   Officials estimated the cost of the test at $15 million.
The budget for the redesign program is $460 million.
As part of a settlement with NASA, the company agreed to do the redesign work at cost.

   Company officials described the redesigned rocket as a "quantum jump" over the previous model.
They said this particular test wouldn't fully determine if the new design is adequate.
Among other things, they said it wouldn't be capable of determining how the new joints would be affected by gravitational forces that build up in an actual launch, the pressure and temperature changes that take place as the shuttle rises, or how the motor would react when attached to the actual shuttle, with its large external fuel tank.

   Mechanical problems are starting to
take a toll on NASA's shuttle schedule, and the space agency is
wondering whether the troubles are random or somehow related.
   Columbia stands silently at Launch Pad A this week, grounded
first by a bad cooling valve and now by a mysterious hydrogen leak
that threatens to push its astronomy mission into July or later.
   Hardly a month before, one of Discovery's power units had to be
replaced at NASA's other shuttle launch pad, an unprecedented job
that delayed the Hubble Space Telescope's ride into orbit.
   Despite the breakdowns, few blame the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
   ``Imagining you can fly the shuttle without any problems is like
trying to imagine you can drive to work without hitting any red
lights,'' said John Pike, director of the Federation of American
Scientists' space policy project.
   David Winterhalter, director of systems engineering and analysis
for NASA, said the life of the shuttles _ the fact ``they've been
around a while'' _ may be at the heart of the mechanical problems.
   John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George
Washington University, says NASA should keep plugging away.
   ``What's the alternative? Quitting? We deal with the system we've
got,'' he said.
   Problems with the thousands of components that comprise the
shuttles _ nearly 90 tons without solid rocket boosters and external
tank _ normally are discovered in the hangar.
   On Columbia and Discovery, the troubles were not spotted until
they were at the launch pads.
   Replacing Columbia's cooling valve and Discovery's auxiliary
power unit was the first time such work had ever been performed at
the pad. Both resulted in two-week delays. And a shuttle launch had
never been scrubbed during fueling until last Wednesday's Columbia
scratch.
   ``I see it as the odds,'' said Brewster Shaw, deputy director of
shuttle operations for NASA. ``It's complicated hardware. It's going
to break once in a while. I don't get too depressed over that.''
   NASA officials said they do not intend to scale down future
flight plans as a result of this year's disruptions. Nine shuttle
missions were scheduled for 1990, the same number as in 1985, which
was the year before Challenger exploded and put the program on hold
for 2{ years.
   One of the remaining six missions _ possibly Columbia's _ likely
will slide into next year.
   ``You cannot anticipate all the problems,'' said NASA launch
director Bob Sieck.
   A test is set for Wednesday in which Columbia's external tank
will be partly filled with super-cold liquid hydrogen. Officials
want to duplicate the conditions under which hydrogen escaped into
the rear engine compartment during fueling for the scratched launch
last Wednesday.
   Shaw said he doubts the test will pinpoint a cause that can be
fixed easily at the pad. If so, Columbia will have to be returned to
the hangar for repairs, making it July before the shuttle can lift
off with seven astronauts and the $150 million Astro observatory.
   Columbia's last-minute problems would have halted the launch even
if more stringent checks had not been added following the Challenger
accident, NASA officials said. The same is true of Discovery's
auxiliary power unit failure.
   NASA officials still believe each shuttle is capable of 100
flights. With a goal of 12 flights a year, that would keep the fleet
aloft until the year 2020, said Keith Hudkins, chief of NASA's
shuttle orbiter program. After that, he said, no one knows where the
future lies.
   ``If tomorrow makes the anti-gravity machine that's always been
in all the comic books, where you just push the button, obviously we
would start working on that the day after tomorrow,'' Hudkins said.

won't be before Aug. 14.
   May 4: Explosions level the plant of Pacific Engineering in
Henderson, Nev., one of two U.S. makers of ammonium perchlorate, a
key component in the shuttle boosters. With only four flight sets
of boosters on hand, NASA worries whether there will be enough fuel
to meet 1989 flight schedule.
   June 10: NASA says Aug. 31 launch target possible.
   June 14: The redesigned booster passes the fourth of its five
full-scale test firings.

shuttle is ready to be mated with its fuel tank and boosters.
   June 28: NASA concedes it can't meet August launch target; aims
for early September.
   July 4: Discovery is moved to the launch pad.
   July 15: Small gas leak found in one of Discovery's steering
engines; NASA sees possibility of additional delay in launch, now
set for Sept. 3.
   July 22: Launch-pad test firing of shuttle delayed two days, to
July 30, after officials decide not all elements are ready.
   July 29: Test delayed a third time in week by leak in hydrogen
line during fueling; set for Aug. 4.
   Aug. 1: Another hydrogen leak is detected but NASA goes ahead
with a countdown rehearsal.
   Aug. 4: Test firing is aborted when a computer reports a valve
not closed and shuts down engines a fraction of a second before
they were to ignite. Valve is replaced in succeeding days.
   Aug. 10: Discovery's main engines fire flawlessly.
   Aug. 18: A shuttle booster, deliberately flawed, undergoes the
fifth and final full-scale firing and use of the new design is
approved for flight.
   Aug. 19: Leak in steering engine sealed by a clamshell device
after workers cut access hole through cargo bay wall.
   Aug. 29: A $100 million Tracking and Data Relay satellite, the
main cargo for the first post-Challenger flight, is loaded into
Discovery. NASA officials decide not to announce a launch date
until after a flight readiness review on Sept. 13-14.
   Aug. 30: NASA revamps its schedule and postpones the June 1,
1989, launch of the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope from the
shuttle until Feb. 1, 1990.
   Sept. 2: A Titan 34D rocket launches a spy satellite from Cape
Canaveral, but its apogee stage fails to fire and it is put into a
useless orbit.
   Sept. 9: Discovery crew finishes two days of countdown rehearsal
in the shuttle, proclaim themselves ready to fly.

<HEAD>Aug. 4 Space Shuttle Launch Threatened By Engine, Rocket Problems</HEAD>

   Discovery, scheduled to make the
first post-Challenger space shuttle flight, is beset by persistent
technical problems which could delay its scheduled Aug. 4 liftoff.
   In recent weeks, there have been troubles with fuel and oxidizer
pumps, engine controllers and booster rocket insulation.
   ``We've always said Aug. 4 is the target, and like most targets,
it's the bull's eye,'' said Thomas Utsman, deputy director of the
Kennedy Space Center. But the technical troubles ``certainly are
going to make that target a small bull's eye.''
   ``I still think from where we are today, an August launch is
achievable,'' he said.
   The problems have forced NASA to delay the rollout of the
shuttle to the launch pad by a week, from May 24 to June 1. Also
delayed a week, until June 22, is a 20-second firing of Discovery's
three main engines with the vehicle locked onto the pad.
   Hugh Harris, a NASA spokesman, said there are several days of
contingency time built into the launch preparation after June 22,
and ``although there are problems, we haven't given up on early
August.''
   A decision on whether to postpone could be made April 14 when
senior NASA managers meet at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
However, officials said a launch date assessment might not be made
until after technicians finish assembling the two soild fuel
booster rockets in late May.
   The newest problem cropped up Tuesday: a faulty controller in
one of Discovery's in-flight maneuvering engines. Replacement is
expected to take two or three days.
   Workers also are removing and checking the high-pressure
oxidizer turbopumps from each of the three main engines, a
procedure that is taking several days.
   Earlier, the hydrogen fuel turbopumps in all three main engines
had to be replaced after a defective weld was found in a non-flight
pump.
   Technicians also are repairing several small areas on a segment
of a solid fuel booster rocket. In these areas, insulation
separated, or debonded, from the steel rocket casing either before
or during shipment here from the Morton Thiokol plant in Utah.
   Failure of a joint on one of Challenger's two solid fuel
boosters caused the shuttle's explosion and loss of its seven crew
members in January 1986. The shuttle fleet has been grounded since
then.
   The redesigned booster has undergone extensive redesign and
successful test-firings in Utah. Three more full-scale tests must
be passed before the rocket is certified for flight. These are
scheduled April 20, June 3 and July 6.

   Those uneducated in the art of
NASAspeak might think LOX is eaten with bagels, a POD is home to a
pea, SMU is a college in Texas and MUM describes a pantomimist.
   Many of the journalists covering the flight of space shuttle
Discovery were new to the space agency's jargon and quickly became
frustrated trying to translate the language of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   For its part, NASA hummed along SOP.
   ``When we bring someone in to brief reporters, they speak in
their normal tongue. It becomes a quick way of communicating,''
said Pat Phillips, a NASA spokeswoman.
   ``At the end of their first mission, they (reporters) are pretty
conversant. It's like (at the end of a trip to Paris) being able to
order your meals in French and navigate around the city,'' she said.
   Phillips said there are about 20 to 30 ``major'' acronyms and
that ``once you learn these you are truly conversant.''
   Frequently at the shuttle briefings, NASA officials referred to
GSE, for ground support equipment, IMF, or in-flight maintenance,
TAL, trans-Atlantic abort landing sites, and TDRS, pronounced
tee-drus and standing for Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, the
$100 million communications satellite that was deployed on
Discovery's first day in orbit.
   NASA included a 4{-page glossary of acronyms in its press kit
for the Discovery flight, which drew 2,318 news media
representatives to the Kennedy Space Center to cover the first
shuttle launch since the Challenger disaster Jan. 28, 1986.
   The acronyms in the press kit were culled from a 138-page
terminology guide given to space center employees. NASA
headquarters in Washington has a 305-page guide, with about 15
terms per page.
   At one pre-launch briefing, a frustrated reporter suggested
another acronym for the space agency's lexicon: AFE, meaning
acronyms for everything.
   Other reporters, including longtime space writers, applauded his
request that NASA briefers speak English.
   ``It's a problem,'' said Ron Kotulak, a Chicago Tribune reporter
who has covered space launches for more than 20 years. ``It's like
the priesthood using symbols to keep the outside out.''
   Hugh J. Martin, covering his first shuttle launch for the Tampa
Tribune, said some reporters were confused by NASA's explanation of
a damaged O-ring on a rocket being prepared for a future shuttle
flight.
   ``A large number of people didn't understand most of that
(explanation), but what they did understand was that there was a
cut in an O-ring,'' he said.
   It was a flawed O-ring joining segments of a booster rocket that
allowed superheated gas to burn through and spark the explosion
that destroyed Challenger.
   Martin said some newspapers reported the story incorrectly,
making the problem seem more critical than it actually was.
   ``In that case, NASA shot themselves in the foot,'' he said.
   Frank Merlino, NASA test director, said the jargon ``really
helps to condense conversations to the action. It's like slang. It
lets you get your point across quickly.''
   FYI, LOX stands for liquid oxygen, POD is the payload operations
director, SMU means speaker-microphone unit, and MUM is the mass
memory unit manager.

<HEAD>Test Of Booster's Nozzle-To-Case Joint Called Success</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The space shuttle program took another
step toward America's return to space with the apparently
successful fourth test of a joint on the redesigned booster rocket,
a NASA official says.
   Flaws deliberately built into the nozzle-to-case joint for
Wednesday's test allowed hot gases to reach the joint's primary
O-ring seal. But the O-ring stopped the gases from reaching the
secondary or final seal, said Royce Mitchell, NASA solid rocket
motor manager.
   ``It will prove that we can give up two of our seals, or two of
our lines of defense against this hot gas, and still have a good,
safe motor,'' Mitchell said following the six-second test at Morton
Thiokol Inc.'s Wasatch Operations plant 25 miles west of here.
   ``All indications are it's a good test, but we've got another
couple of these to go and, of course, our next motor test will be
in April,'' Mitchell said, adding that a complete analysis of the
joint's performance was not expected for several weeks.
   The solid-fuel rocket booster has undergone extensive redesign
since the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the shuttle Challenger that
killed the seven-member crew. The disaster was blamed on a faulty
seal in a booster joint that allowed hot gases to escape and ignite
the fuel tank.
   Wednesday's test, delayed two hours by replacement of a computer
board, was the fourth of six Nozzle Joint Environment Simulator
experiments and one of hundreds of booster component tests.
   The initially favorable results showed the shuttle program is
moving slowly but surely toward resumption of flights, Mitchell
said.
   ``We are maintaining our schedule for the August launch of
Discovery,'' he said. ``It's a very conservative approach.''
   The test was designed to evaluate the main seal's ability to
contain any gases that might leak through bonded adhesive
insulation and a rubber-like ``wiper'' O-ring during launch, said
Thiokol spokesman Rocky Raab.
   Engineers made a quarter-inch-by-five-hundredths-inch hole
through the insulation and disabled the wiper ring, creating two
flaws that assured a gas path to the primary seal.
   The double defects simulated coincidental manufacturing defects
in the insulation and wiper O-ring, a ``worst possible case'' that
likely could never occur, Raab said. It also subjected the joint to
more severe conditions than previous tests.
   The next test will increase the pressure because the primary
O-ring will be purposely flawed to permit gases to reach the
secondary O-ring, Mitchell said. The final test will simulate
complete failure.
   Engineers concluded after the third nozzle-joint test Oct. 8
that the O-ring system withstood gas pressure after a single flaw
was built into the joint, which connects the nozzle to the body of
the segmented booster rocket.
   However, during a full-scale test Dec. 23, a ``blow hole'' was
detected in the joint's adhesive sealant, a defect NASA had not
built into the test.
   Blow holes can occur during assembly of the 126-foot-long
rocket, ``so it happens here at the factory, if it happens,'' Raab
said.
   While the blow hole was not considered a major problem, the
failure of a nozzle boot ring during the December test prompted
NASA officials to delay the scheduled June 2 resumption of shuttle
flights.
   Raab said the test Wednesday simulated ``the most difficult
portion of the environment for the O-rings, that is the first one
second'' of launch.
   In addition to the final two nozzle-to-case tests scheduled
before shuttle flights resume, NASA and Thiokol will conduct
several more Joint Environment Simulator Tests of the booster
rocket and three more full-scale horizontal tests, in April, June
and July.

   The third full-scale firing of a
redesigned solid fuel booster rocket for the space shuttle was
scheduled for Wednesday with deliberate flaws built in to test
safety features.
   The two-minute firing of the 126-foot-long, 1.2 million-pound
booster was scheduled for 3 p.m. EDT at Morton Thiokol's Wasatch
Operations plant 25 miles west of Brigham City.
   ``This is a really important milestone in the resumption of
flight,'' said company spokesman Rocky Raab. ``In a sense, it's the
culmination of the redesign effort of two years. If all three of
the (final) tests proceed satisfactorily, the launch preparations
proceed.''
   The horizontal test is designed to reveal any weaknesses in
booster, which was redesigned after the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of
the shuttle Challenger.
   The disaster, which killed Challenger's seven-member crew, was
blamed on a flawed booster rocket seal that allowed blazing exhaust
to escape through a joint in the side and ignite the shuttle's
external liquid fuel tank.
   Wednesday's test is the first in the last series of firings
planned by Morton Thiokol and NASA before the shuttle's first
post-Challenger launch, scheduled for mid-August. Other full-scale
tests are scheduled for June and July.
   The rocket for Wednesday's test was assembled with deliberate
flaws in sealing material in the joints between segments of the
booster. Flawed seals have been tested previously in short-duration
tests, but never in a full-scale firing, Raab said.
   In one joint, a defect was cut into the surface of a J-shaped
seal where sections of insulation meet inside the rocket casing.
The defect could let hot gas penetrate the insulation and hit the
innermost of three O-rings. In the short-duration tests, the defect
sealed itself during firing and gas did not reach the O-ring.
   In another joint a small ``blowhole'' was created in the
adhesive that binds the insulation to the rocket casing. In
short-duration tests, hot gases have followed the blowhole to a new
O-ring, but have not gone beyond it.
   The test comes at a critical time for Morton Thiokol. The
company is NASA's sole supplier of booster rockets, and views a
successful launch as a sign the stigma of the Challenger tragedy
can be set aside.
   While praising Morton Thiokol's work in the redesign effort,
NASA also has asked Congress for a $1.2 million government plant to
build its own boosters.
   Though not related to the shuttle program, the company's image
also was tarnished by the deaths of five employees in a Dec. 29
fire that destroyed a first-stage MX missile rocket motor.
   State safety inspectors cited Morton Thiokol for alleged safety
violations, which are being contested by the company.
   But both Air Force and Morton Thiokol investigators concluded
the workers violated company safety rules by being in the building
during a critical stage of the fueling process that normally is
carried out by remote control.
   Raab said confidence at the company remains high.
   ``The morale here is extremely good as far as the redesign and
success we've had to date,'' Raab said. ``What most people don't
realize is this redesign effort is about three times as intricate
as the original design process, and is being completed in half the
time.''

<TEXT>
   The redesigned space shuttle booster
performed to near-perfection during a critical firing earlier this
month despite being peppered with intentional flaws, Morton Thiokol
announced Tuesday.
   ``It was as near perfect a test as you can imagine,'' spokesman
Rocky Raab said. ``The test was so perfect that everyone associated
with it has taken leave. Brother, there's nobody out at the plant.''
   Raab said workers had completed disassembly and primary analysis
of the 126-foot-long solid-fuel booster tested Aug. 18 at Morton
Thiokol's northern Utah plant 25 miles west of Brigham City.
   Success of the firing, the fifth and final qualifying test
required before Thiokol's redesigned booster is cleared for flight,
was critical to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
plans to resume shuttle missions, grounded since the Challenger
disaster 2{ years ago.
   NASA says it plans to launch the shuttle Discovery in late
September or early October if sluggish oxygen valves and a hydrogen
leak are repaired in time.
   Raab said NASA and Morton Thiokol engineers have ``gotten all
the primary results'' from their painstaking examination of the
rocket. All that remains is mostly computer analysis of the ``more
minor details'' of the test-firing, he said.
   Meantime at Space Center, Houston, the five Discovery astronauts
and ground support teams began staging their final long-duration,
pre-launch rehearsal Tuesday.
   The crew will face about 150 simulated problems during the
lengthy test.
   Morton Thiokol's $20 million, two-minute test-firing culminated
its efforts to redesign the booster, blamed for the Jan. 28, 1986,
Challenger explosion.
   A presidential commission found that a faulty O-ring seal on one
of the rocket's joints failed during launch, allowing super-hot
gases to escape and ignite an exterior fuel tank. The Challenger
and its seven-member crew were destroyed in the subsequent blast.
   For the Aug. 18 test, two of the rocket's three field joints,
the case-to-nozzle joint and the igniter-to-case joint were
peppered with 14 intentional flaws.
   One field joint was left unflawed for use in comparison.

<TEXT>
   Two of three redesigned joints on the
space shuttle booster rocket passed their first qualifying tests
with flying colors, Morton Thiokol Inc. engineers said Thursday.
   Engineers have inspected both the aft and center joints between
segments of the solid fuel booster and found both worked as
designed during an April 22 full-scale test-firing, Dave Mobley,
NASA deputy project manager for the redesign effort, said.
   Results of tests on the forward joint are expected Friday.
   The center joint held up even though an intentional flaw was
built into it for the test-firing at the Morton Thiokol plant 25
miles west of here.
   Two more full-scale qualifying tests of the booster are planned
for June and July, and the shuttle is tentatively set for launch in
late August or early September, the first since Challenger exploded
on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Mobley said the center joint flaw allowed superhot gases from
the burning fuel to reach insulation and the joint's O-ring gasket,
but the ring held.
   ``There was no damage to the O-ring at all,'' he said. ``There
was no evidence the gas got past'' the ring.
   Failure of an O-ring seal is blamed for allowing exhaust gas to
escape from one of Challenger's boosters. A presidential commission
found the gas ignited the shuttle's exterior liquid fuel tank,
triggering the explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed its
seven crew members.
   Mobley also said engineers found no damage to the rocket's
nozzle section. In a December test-firing, a NASA-designed boot
ring on the section came apart. The April test used a Morton
Thiokol-designed boot ring that was reliable in the past.
   A final report, based on more extensive study, isn't expected
for several weeks, he said.

<HEAD>NASA Selects Mississippi Sites For New Rocket Engine Work</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA has selected two sites in Mississippi as
the best locations for proposed government-owned facilities for the
production and testing of a new space shuttle solid rocket motor,
the space agency announced today.
   A location in northeastern Mississippi known as Yellow Creek was
selected as a production site for the space shuttle advanced solid
rocket motor, NASA said, and the Stennis Space Center near Bay St.
Louis, Miss., has been selected as a site for the testing of the
motor.
   Yellow Creek is owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority, and
Stennis is a NASA facility.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said work at
the Yellow Creek site could provide about 1,400 new jobs, and an
additional 600 jobs would be created at Bay St. Louis.
   The space shuttle advanced solid rocket motor is planned to
replace the current redesigned shuttle rocket motor in the
mid-1990s. The advanced motor is expected to provide more
reliability and safety, and enable the space shuttle to carry more
cargo into orbit.
   Under the NASA advanced rocket motor plan, the space agency will
now ask for contract proposals for work on the rocket motor at the
two Mississippi sites. Companies will be asked to make bids on
building a government-owned facility that would be operated by the
contractor.
   Companies may also propose that the work be done in facilities
built and owned by contractors at a privately owned site of the
contractor's choosing.
   After evaluating the options, NASA will make a final decision on
the advanced solid rocket motor contract.
   NASA said that an advanced solid rocket motor program in
Mississippi will make ``maximum utilization'' of the Michoud
Assembly Facility and the Slidell Computer Complex, both located
nearby in southeastern Louisiana.
