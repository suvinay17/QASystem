<HEAD>Officials Cancel Yoga Class Because of Devil-Worshiping Argument</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOCCOA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yoga is a form of New Age mysticism that can
lead to devil worship, says a man who led protests that forced
officials to cancel a city-county sponsored yoga class.
   ``The people who are signed up for the class are just walking
into it like cattle to a slaughter,'' said Philip Lawrence. ``Half
of yoga is a branch of Eastern mysticism, and it has strong occult
influences.''
   Lawrence said he is opposing the yoga class as a Christian. He
said other people opposing the classes are from Baptist, Lutheran
and Church of God congregations.
   The class, sponsored by the Toccoa-Stephens County Recreation
Department, was scheduled to begin Monday. It was canceled Aug. 31
after city and county commissioners received a number of complaints
from church members in Toccoa.
   ``The different commissioners got together on the phone, and the
majority decided the class should be canceled,'' Mayor Bill Harris
said. ``Some felt that they were under too much pressure.''
   Leonard Greenspoon, a Clemson University religion professor,
said yoga has become a secularized form of exercise and relaxation.
   ``There's certainly no necessary connection between yoga and
devil worship,'' he said. ``Anybody who's equating Eastern religion
with devil worship has made a big mistake.''
   Roger Terrell, program director for the recreation department,
said he met with yoga teacher Carolyn Davis to make sure the class
would involve only simple stretching and relaxation techniques.
   ``We can't be promoting religion or anything,'' he said. ``It's
strictly for health reasons.''
   Some of the 26 people who had signed up for the yoga class say
they won't let the matter drop. ``This is not the end,'' said
Deborah Hartley. ``This is just the beginning as far as I'm
concerned.''
   She and Katherine Hodges, another would-be yoga student,
complained Tuesday to the county commissioners. She said she also
plans to fight for the class at the next meetings of city-county
commissioners and the recreation board.

KEEPING FIT: INSTRUCTOR THAWS OUT THE USUALLY FROZEN YOGA 
</P>

<P>
It was in the early 1970s that Geo Takoma lost sight of himself as he battled 
the hellish nightmares of running bird dog patrols in Vietnam. Within a few 
months of his honorable discharge, the former Marine sergeant took a long, hard 
look in the mirror. 
</P>
<P>
The frightening image staring back -- an abusive, overweight alcoholic -- shook 
him back into reality. Takoma stopped resisting what Vietnam had given him, the 
desire to live in a peaceful world, and set immediately to work re-creating 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
By adopting a Hindu philosophy, Takoma transformed himself from an aggressive 
individual into one who teaches peace through yoga. His classes attract 150 
students a week around Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I'm American," said Takoma. "Real American. I played football in 
high school, went to war, and liked the aspect of competition this society 
thrives on. I used to thrive on it, too. The brutal aggression of war closed my 
heart. That was killing me." 
</P>
<P>
Takoma wanted to regain the muscular build and physical endurance he had as a 
football player, but he didn't want to re-enter the competitive side of 
athletics. He was drawn to the nonaggressive philosophy of yoga. 
</P>
<P>
"I absolutely fell in love with yoga," he said. "I wanted to learn everything I 
possibly could about it." 
</P>
<P>
In his study, the wanna-be yogi traveled to India but discovered he disliked 
traditional yoga methods. 
</P>
<P>
"Imagine, going all the way to India only to discover that . . . , " he said. 
"India didn't have the intense level of yoga I was seeking." 
</P>
<P>
By 1975, he gained certification under the guidance of Indra Devi, considered 
to be the first lady of yoga. "Now she's 90," Takoma said, "and she's still 
teaching today. 
</P>
<P>
"In studying many different yoga philosophies I began to see that, whether in 
Southern California or India, the morose nature of those spiritual classes 
where you walk around like you're half-dead bores me. And it bores most 
Americans. We're an action-oriented society, so I devised a new American-style 
yoga." 
</P>
<P>
Takoma broke some rules in establishing "Power Yoga," an intense hourlong 
session filled with stretching and visualization exercises. Postures blend 
ancient yoga teachings with the fact that Americans have wider hips, bigger 
legs and tighter necks than the yoga masters of Buddha's day. 
</P>
<P>
The avant-garde meditations are offered at the Girl's Gym in Newport Beach, 
Club Postnuclear in Laguna Beach and Sports Club Irvine, or Takoma will guide 
you through his teachings in the privacy of your home. Classes vary in size but 
average around 20 students, with both men and women participating. The cost is 
$8 a session or $55 a month, in a public or private setting. 
</P>
<P>
"More women than men attend," Takoma said. "But men need to learn to relax. Men 
need to open their hearts and awaken the child within too." 
</P>
<P>
In Takoma's philosophy, to be fully alive is to be fully spirited like a child, 
so he imitates movements a baby makes. Under his guidance, he says the body can 
respond to the arching, twisting yoga postures with the elasticity and the 
enthusiasm of youth. 
</P>
<P>
"Americans carry stress in our necks," he said. "So I reworked the positions to 
eliminate any additional neck stress. But most of the positions are derived 
from a baby's natural movements used to strengthen its newly formed body." 
</P>
<P>
Some of Takoma's poses are drawn from his experiences as a football player and 
weightlifter. In the "linebacker" pose, students maintain a position like a 
defensive linebacker with their legs set shoulder-width apart, knees slightly 
bent, body weight forward, hands out in front. This stretches the hamstrings 
and works the lower back into a fully relaxed position. 
</P>
<P>
The "Russian weightlifter" is designed to strengthen the upper body and tighten 
the triceps. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the students imagine they're one of those Russian weightlifters lifting 
900 pounds," Takoma explained. "With one big breath they hoist the weight over 
their heads. Then we quickly repeat this exercise for 10 repetitions. By the 
last lift, everyone is heaving and puffing from the strain of the imagined 
weight. It's a real high to look out at those straining, grimacing faces." 
</P>
<P>
Looking for a real workout that wouldn't strain her knees led Debbie 
Heussenstamm to "Power Yoga." Advised by an orthopedic surgeon to cut aerobics 
classes from her exercise regimen, which also included swimming and speed 
walking, Heussenstamm decided to give yoga a try. She heard about power yoga 
through a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought this was going to be a class on stretching," she said. "I had no 
idea you could build up such a sweat. Power yoga has even replaced my swimming 
and speed-walking routine." 
</P>
<P>
At first, Heussenstamm attended classes once a week; now she's developed a 
four-times-a-week habit. Debbie, a weaver, and her husband, Paul, an artist, 
open their art-filled home to Takoma and his yoga devotees four mornings a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"Classes used to be held at the fire station in Emerald Bay," Debbie said. "But 
the floors were hardwood and the firemen were noisy. It will be a year ago 
tomorrow that we were told we'd have to cancel class because of the voting 
booths. I have a big living room, so I invited every one up to my house. Pretty 
soon we decided to just move the classes to our house." 
</P>
<P>
Recovering from a severe auto accident led Jan Ernst of Huntington Beach on her 
search for an exercise regimen that could rebuild her sprained back but support 
her weakened spine. Although she was unable to do many of the traditional 
inverted yoga postures, she found she could participate in Takoma's class. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been into yoga for over 20 years," Ernst said. "Geo's program is a 
complete physical and spiritual workout. His techniques build muscles and 
tissues through isometrics and stretching. There's no need for stress-inducing 
equipment." 
</P>
<P>
For Geo Takoma, power yoga is an offshoot of the Love Generation. 
</P>
<P>
"The '60s planted the seed," he said. "The '90s gets rid of the mythology and 
moves toward reality."

<HEAD>Officials Decide Yoga Isn't Devil's Work</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOCCOA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials decided Monday that yoga isn't so
devilish after all.
   During a special meeting Monday night that drew about 100
spectators, members of the Toccoa City Commission, the Stephens
County Commission and the county recreation board decided they
would allow yoga enthusiasts to practice their exercises in a
county recreation center.
   But in an attempt to appease those in this small northeast
Georgia town who believe yoga is a form of devil worship, the yoga
classes will won't be sponsored by the county or funded with tax
dollars.
   The move reversed a decision last week to cancel a class after
some residents complained.
   Phillip Lawrence, a local chiropractor who has led the fight
against yoga, said last week those who practice it are opening the
door to the devil.
   ``The people who are signed up for the class are just walking
into to it like cattle to a slaughter,'' he said last week. ``Half
of yoga is a branch of Eastern mysticism, and it has strong occult
influences.''

   These Guys Must Already Know
   All About Doing Long Stretches

   At the maximum security ward of the state penitentiary in
Walla Walla, Wash., stern prison guards patrol a tiny
classroom. Inside, 16 murderers and rapists are practicing
yoga.
   The muscled and tatooed convicts take deep breaths, stand
on their heads and stretch on mats as they listen to ocean
sounds and flute music coming from a portable tape recorder.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Big, strong, silent types that they are, the men don't
tell their instructor very much. "But I think most of them
come to yoga class to find themselves and to learn how to
cope with the stresses of everyday prison life," says Sandi
Wicher, an aerobics and yoga teacher at a nearby community
college who each week conducts four classes at the prison,
three in maximum security and one in medium security.
   Because many of the inmate students are built like power
lifters, the Lotus Position isn't even attempted in Yoga I-A,
though it is in Yoga I-B. "One guy in my class has so much
muscle it's really difficult for him to stretch. He just
comes to breathe," says Ms. Wicher.
   About 40 of the facility's 1,800 prisoners are taking yoga
lessons, a surprisingly good turnout as prisons go. Most
prisons don't want it, reports the National Correctional
Recreation Association. "Yoga and prison don't mix," says one
prison official, who asks not to be quoted by name. "It's not
a very macho thing. Real men don't have stress."
   "Put it this way," explains David Montgomery, NCRA
secretary, "We're not exactly rushing to set up yoga classes
{in prisons} all over America."
   Ms. Wicher says teaching yoga in prison isn't much
different from instruction anywhere else: "Convicts are
people, too." Even so, the 40-year-old instructor keeps
physical contact to a minimum. "At the {community} college, I
won't hesitate to physically wrap myself around students to
get them stretched correctly; at the penitentiary, I'll maybe
brush their toes with my fingers. My husband thinks I'm crazy
to want to be in a room with 16 murderers and rapists."
   She has her limits, though. She won't teach convicts in
protective custody, the ones whose crimes are so notorious,
other inmates want to harm them. She says, "I got chills even
hearing their names."
   But Ms. Wicher adds: "I would love to give a class for
prison officials. Many of them smoke and are so out of shape.
But the prison can't afford it."

<TEXT>     Yoga developed as part of the Hindu faith; it has many branches, each with
its own esoteric liturgy that requires many pages to explain.;    The branch
concerned with twists, balances and stretches, as well as meditation -- the
branch that interests many Americans who get into yoga -- is hatha yoga.;   
Yoga came into being in India over the course of centuries.;    According to
Yoga: The Technology of Ecstasy, by Georg Feuerstein, the discipline has roots
in the northern Indian peninsula, at least 2,000 years ago, when priests did
complicated ritual chants, which needed to be done with absolute accuracy if
the gods were to hear and respond. Techniques for breathing and concentration
came out of the need for precision.;    The goal of hatha yoga students is
physical well-being and/or spiritual grace. Many yoga books, such as the
recent one by actress Raquel Welch, put almost all their emphasis on physical
improvements.;    Some students report that physical improvements lead to a
deeper feeling for spiritual things. A few people plunge all the way into
yoga, pursuing, sometimes for decades, its ultimate promise -- transcendence;
an intense feeling, writes Feuerstein, of "God-realization, or
Self-realization.";    The most eloquent description of yoga written in this
century is the 600-word foreword that violinist Yehudi Menuhin did for B.K.S.
Iyengar's book Light on Yoga. Menuhin writes, "The practice of Yoga induces a
primary sense of measure and proportion. Reduced to our own body, our first
instrument, we learn to play it, drawing from it maximum resonance and
harmony. With unflagging patience we refine and animate every cell as we
return daily to the attack, unlocking and liberating capacities otherwise
condemned to frustration and death. . . . Whoever has had the privilege of
receiving Mr. Iyengar's attention, or of witnessing the precision, refinement
and beauty of his art, is introduced to that vision of perfection and
innocence which is man as first created." Iyengar has codified a school of
thought about how best to teach and perform hatha yoga. He focuses on
extremely precise movements of muscle and bone; emphasizes strength, stamina,
stability and balance; places considerable importance on several standing
poses; and uses specially designed props, such as benches and ropes.;    There
are many other schools of thought today created by other gurus. Within the
yoga community, differences in these approaches are discussed with some of the
fervor of 11th century Christians debating the existence of the Trinity, or
SDS factions seeking the true path to revolution in dorm rooms at Columbia in
the spring of '68.;    To the layperson, distinctions between yoga schools
might appear confusing and unimportant; yoga teachers are aware of this, and
there have been efforts toward ecumenism. Some other styles of instruction are
Integral Yoga; Viniyoga, the style followed by respected Marin County teacher
Richard Miller; and Divine Life, the Chidananda branch of which is followed by
popular TV teacher Lilias Folan.;    The overall health and image of yoga in
America today appears to be robust and shock-proof, judging from steady, often
increasing numbers of students at many schools; consistent sales of numerous
books; and daily yoga TV shows.;    The circulation of the bi-monthly magazine
Yoga Journal, based in Berkeley, has steadily grown from 300 when it was
launched in 1975 to 60,000 today.;    Despite celebrity followers and daily TV
shows, the yoga community sees itself as outside the mainstream of American
life, and therefore treads carefully. It worries, for example, about attacks
and criticisms by some Christian groups. Some fundamentalists consider yoga a
branch of Satanism or a "doorway for Satan," according to the religious tract
Prepare for War, by Rebecca Brown, M.D. And in December 1989, the Vatican told
Catholics they should not substitute things like yoga and Zen for Christian
prayer.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 130 pounds;    PERSONAL: Divorced; has two children, three
grandchildren and lives in San Jose;    OCCUPATION: Office manager, Metalfab
in Santa Clara;    FITNESS BACKGROUND: "I've always been loaded with energy
and anxious to try new things," Burrow says. Until she moved from the
Sacramento Valley 10 years ago, her list of "adventures" included water
skiing, tennis, horseback riding and jumping, aerobics, running, weight
lifting, tap dancing and ballet. "I even tried belly dancing.";    But the
only activity she sustained, she admits, was her smoking habit.;    After her
divorce, however, she turned to another form of exercise: yoga.;    REGIMEN:
For the past seven years Burrow has been practicing Hatha yoga in the Iyengar
tradition, a style that emphasizes posture and body alignment, breathing and
relaxation. She attends classes three times a week. The series of exercises
she does to incorporate the body, mind and spirit requires precise attention
to movements and postures. "It's not like counting one, two, three, four as
you're doing sit-ups. And it's not competitive or repetitive.";    She also
practices at home several mornings a week and at work when she feels stress.
Burrow walks two miles, rain or shine, during her lunch hours. If she and a
friend miss their brisk walk after work, they make it up at Rancho San Antonio
on the weekend with a five-mile hike.;    RESULTS: "I feel healthy, happy and
more mentally balanced." And because yoga made her feel like she should "walk
her talk," she kicked her 30-year smoking habit four years ago.;    GOALS:
"You're never 'there' in yoga, regardless of your age. It's wonderful
discovering you are able to go beyond what you thought were your limits.";   
OBSTACLES: "Nothing. An occasional birthday party, maybe. Otherwise I try to
plan obligations around my routine.";    TIPS AND COMMENTS: "I plan to
practice yoga for the rest of my life. I've never felt more energy,
enthusiasm, zest and joy than I do now and am looking forward to the
challenges left in my life."  </TEXT>

   A vegetarian diet, quitting cigarettes,
moderate exercise and up to an hour a day of yoga meditation can
help reverse heart disease symptoms without the use of drugs,
according to a California study.
   Dean Ornish, a professor of medicine at the University of
California, San Francisco, said that instead of using any drugs, his
program forced dramatic changes in lifestyle to bring a significant
improvement in the health of patients with coronary artery disease.
   The program is radical, he admits, but for the small group
tested, it worked.
   ``For many who have heart disease,'' said Ornish, ``the
conventional therapy (which includes drugs or surgery, some diet
revision and exercise) may not go far enough.''
   Ornish outlined his research in a paper presented Monday at the
annual meeting of the American Heart Association.
   He devised a strict program that started with a week of training
and preparation, a vegetarian diet that was less than 10 percent
fat, and 16 hours a week of group therapy. Patients who smoked were
required to quit. A moderate exercise program, usually walking, was
devised individually for each patient. And, to manage stress, the
patients were taught yoga meditation and relaxation exercises.
   To test the concept, Ornish put 50 patients with coronary artery
disease into two groups. All were tested to find the condition of
their arteries, how well their hearts were supplied with blood, and
the amount of cholesterol in their bloodstream. Cholesterol is a
fatty material in blood that can lead to clogged arteries.
   For those in the first group, Ornish provided the traditional
lifestyle care, which included some counseling on how to lower
cholesterol levels, controlling high blood pressure and quitting
smoking.
   The second group, however, was placed on what Ornish called ``a
very demanding regimen'' of lifestyle changes.
   ``We were asking them to make huge changes in their lifestyle and
then evaluated the effects'' using high technology X-ray and imaging
techniques, he said.
   The program started with a seven-day retreat during which the
patients were evaluated by a psychologist and by exercise experts.
They were taught how to use yoga to relieve stress, and were placed
on the strict diet.
   After the retreat, the group met for eight hours, two days a week
for instruction sessions in exercise, yoga and food preparation.
   ``We provided the low-fat food for some in take-home
containers,'' said Ornish. ``They found it was not as hard as you
would think. The group support goes a long way.''
   At the end of a year, 29 patients completed the testing analysis
_ 12 in the lifestyle changes group, and 17 in the ordinary care, or
control, group.
   For the control group, the arterial lesions, or clogging of
vessels supplying blood to heart, grew worse. Vessels that were 44.1
percent blocked closed further, to 46.2 percent blocked.
   For the lifestyle group, the progression of the disease was
halted and some arteries measurably opened up, providing additional
blood flow to the heart. They went from an average of 44.4 percent
blocked to 40.8 percent, a clear regression improvement in the
artery health, said Ornish.
   ``There was a significant decrease in blockages in the lifestyle
treatment group and a significant increase in blockages in the
control group,'' he said.
   Ornish said he used yoga and other stress control techniques
because earlier studies have shown ``emotional stress can play a
role in increasing and reducing lesions.''
   Also, he said, ``stress can increase cholesterol (in the
bloodstream) regardless of diet.'' Ornish said studies have shown,
for instance, that cholesterol rates go up for drivers during auto
races and for students during final examinations.
   ``Yoga is an ancient way of managing stress,'' said Ornish.
``It's very practical.'' He said patients were urged to meditate an
hour a day.
   Cholesterol counts in the treatment group declined from a median
of 227 milligrams per decaliter to 135, well below the recommended
maximum of 200.
   Patients in the study were aged 40 to 74, he said, and those who
were the sickest seemed to be helped the most.
   ``The blockages that were the most severe seem to improve the
greatest,'' said Ornish.
   The California scientist cautioned that though the results were
encouraging, they are preliminary, and that the number of patients
was too small to draw final conclusions on the value of the
treatment system.

ONE OF the curious things about the health and beauty business is that most
people - four out of five, according to Allied Dunbar's annual report on the
physical state of the nation - believe that some form of exercise is good
for them, but only half of them do anything about it. In other words, most
take the classic advice when overcome with the urge to deal with flab - they
sit down until they feel better. But slowly, more of us are realising that
fitness is not only good for us, it can also be fun. It can be about
enjoying yourself, meeting friends and colleagues in warm, congenial clubs,
and about feeling better, too.
As David Giampaolo, who founded the Espree clubs and now distributes fitness
equipment, puts it: 'These days the emphasis is much more on health than
fitness. It's about exercising in a way that is physically, psychologically
AND spiritually rewarding. The idea nowadays is to be energised, not
exhausted.'
The days of the Jane Fonda mantra, No Pain, No Gain, are gone. High-impact
aerobics, exercising till you drop, are out of vogue. In have come
low-impact aerobics, stretch and step, yoga, flotation, inline skating, Tai
Chi, dance - the key is to find something you actually enjoy - then there is
a chance that you might stick with it.
Fitness is also big business. The health, youth and fitness business is
predicted to be one of the five fastest growing commercial sectors in the
next decade - but as in all successful businesses, it needs sharp footwork
to keep ahead of the game.
With the emphasis on fun and (sign of the times) stress relief the
fashionable way to hone limbs and tone up cardiovascular function is with
such new age concepts as Step Training, Inline Skating, The Slide Trainer,
water aerobics and personal trainers. Crucial, too, are the ancillary
servies - aromatherapy, reflexology, massage, the holistic approach that all
the best, most advanced clubs now offer.
David Giampaolo was probably the first, with Espree, to see that most
1980s-style British clubs lacked allure. They were spartan and functional;
people came, worked out and went home. With Espree he made sure that a club
was a nice place to be - comfortable, inviting, warm, with a restaurant
serving decent food.
Nowadays many clubs are selling the new age message: that you need not
suffer to be beautiful and well. The Riverside Club, some of the David Lloyd
ones, the medium-market Metropolitan Clubs and lots of small health clubs up
and down the UK are all now more inviting to visit than the spartan clubs of
yesteryear.
The new Harbour Club at Watermead Lane, London SW6 (tel: 071-371-7700) is
not due to open until March 22 but so far is making all the right noises. It
describes itself as a multi-sports club with 14 tennis courts (10 indoors),
a 4,000 sq ft gymnasium, a 25 metre pool, a creche, good parking and every
sort of class from stretch and step, yoga and dance to flotation tank and a
proper restaurant with a serious chef (ex-Halcyon Hotel).
There is a resaleable membership fee of Pounds 1,695 and the monthly full
membership charge is Pounds 88. This lets you use all the facilities free
except the indoor tennis courts at peak time for which there is a Pounds 10
an hour charge. There will also be off-peak membership of Pounds 55 per
month and a joining fee of Pounds 430 for those who only use the club Monday
to Friday from 6.30am to 6pm. Some 900 people have already signed up.
For those for whom those kind of sums are out of the question it is worth
mentioning Jamie Addicoat's Fatbusters - wonderful name - classes. When I
last looked at the fitness business Addicoat's Fatbusters was running some
of the cheapest classes around, at Covent Garden's Jubilee Hall for Pounds
2.50 a class. Today prices have risen to just Pounds 4 a time. For that
reasonable sum you get Jamie himself, shouting, strutting, urging you on to
that (attainable) goal - the lean and trim body. Hours are for serious
workaoholics - 7.30 am on Monday, Tuesday and Thursdays, 7.15 pm on Tuesdays
and 1 pm on Sundays. Classes are held at the Jubilee Hall, 30, The Piazza,
Covent Garden, London WC2. Tel: 071-836-4007 for details.
The ultimate luxury (or necessity, depending on your point of view), is the
personal trainer. Puritanical Britons tend to feel this is the decadent way
to fitness but in New York, where personal trainers are nearly as ubiquitous
as personal analysts, they are seen as just another sensible use of
hard-pressed time. Trainers come in every discipline and though Pounds 35 an
hour (the average rate at which they come in London) may sound a lot, if you
get two or three friends to join it is good value.
My personal preference at the moment is for yoga: muscle toning, increased
suppleness and flexibility, not to mention a sense of renewed energy, are
just some of the benefits that yoga addicts notice. As evidence of my
devotion to my readers I proffer the name of my own much-valued yoga
teacher, Lisbeth Russell, tel: 071-431-2668, for those in the London area
who think yoga may be the thing for them. Otherwise the British Wheel of
Yoga Central Office (tel: 0529-306851) has a list of trained teachers in the
UK.
For other personal trainers - whether in low-impact aerobics, stretch and
step, body-sculpting - ring Melanie Reigber at Lifeworks (tel: 081-520-7344)
and she will put you in touch with teachers and classes in your area.
If you like keeping your physical inadequacies to yourself and just want to
work out in privacy at home there is now a vast range of in-home equipment
and supporting videos. The Step is currently much in vogue (see caption top
right) but the hot coming thing (according to David Giampaolo) is The Slide
Trainer, which should be in most sports shops in mid-March for Pounds 79.
Whereas most exercises work the front and back of the legs the Slide Trainer
promises (ah, delicious prospect) to stretch and tone the abductors (the
outside thigh muscles) and adductors (the inner ones). It also tones the
medial and lateral muscles on the inside and outside of the knee. So there
you have it - thinner thighs, stronger knees could be yours.
One last thought. The inescapable fact is that the toned body, the lithe
shape, the inner tranquillity does not come from the odd hour in the gym or
the couple of hours on the tennis court. It depends upon a whole way of
life. It reflects what you eat, how you move, how you feel and how you
exercise. Nothing is ever quite as simple as it seems . . .

COPING WITH STRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Life.

Stress. The very sound of the word makes the heart palpitate, the stomach cramp 
and the jaws clench. It seems everyone knows stress, battles stress and, 
ironically, thrives on stress. "We need some degree of stress in our lives," 
said Anaheim psychiatrist Dorothy Savarirayan. "Otherwise, we wouldn't have any 
motivation." You can't totally eradicate it. So the secret to managing stress 
is not living without it but learning to live with it. Here, then, are some 
pointers for coping with stress. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
NAP AWAY THAT STRESS 
</P>
<P>
On just about every afternoon for the past 10 years, Benjamin Epstein has 
shoehorned a catnap into his busy schedule. 
</P>
<P>
"It just seems to get me back on track. It's instant stress relief," said 
Epstein, 37, the vice president of a Newport Beach-based advertising firm. 
</P>
<P>
All he needs, or wants, is 15 minutes of 40 winks. "The process of falling 
asleep seems to be the magic, more than the actual sleep," he said. "You wake 
up to a clean slate." 
</P>
<P>
Epstein has become so attached to his post-lunch ritual that he organizes his 
life around it. "Ever since I first discovered naps, I've always made sure to 
live within 10 minutes of my office," he said. 
</P>
<P>
When a business appointment prevents him from breaking for Zs, Epstein suffers. 
"I feel infinitely more tired by 5 p.m.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It's only natural our energy level takes an afternoon dip. "The human body is 
predisposed to fall asleep two times during the 24-hour day -- one peak between 
4 and 6 a.m. and another peak between 1 and 3 p.m.," said Merrill Mitler, 
director of research for the Sleep Disorder Center at Scripps Clinic in La 
Jolla. "It's no accident that many Latin cultures have an afternoon siesta. It 
fits very well with the way the body is built." 
</P>
<P>
However, siestas would be unrealistic for most American employees, Mitler said. 
"If a worker says, 'It's my human nature to take a nap right now,' his boss 
might say, 'Well, then, it's my human nature to fire you.' " 
</P>
<P>
While daily naps may be a nice way to calm the nerves, sporadic snoozing can do 
more harm than good, Mitler warned. "Napping that's done intermittently -- one 
or two days a week -- is probably a bad idea. It disturbs the cycle of 
wakefulness and sleep and can make falling asleep at night difficult. When your 
sleep cycle gets out of whack, your stress is increased instead of reduced." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STRESSED OUT OVER WORKING OUT 
</P>
<P>
Usually, exercise is considered an antidote to stress -- not a cause. But 
overexercising can become an additional source of stress rather than a relaxer. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, a lot of the people who are compulsive about athletics are 
compulsive individuals to begin with," said Peter Reynolds, a Huntington 
Beach-based orthopedic surgeon who specializes in sports-related injuries. 
"They go at athletics the same way they go at business and everything else. 
They carry into their exercise the same thought process that got them into 
trouble with stress. 
</P>
<P>
"Exercise should be done as relaxation -- not as another form of competition," 
he said. "You probably shouldn't have a stopwatch out when you're running. You 
shouldn't try to run faster and longer each time." 
</P>
<P>
Psychiatrist Martin Brenner, medical director at Community Psychiatric Center, 
Santa Ana Hospital, said that perfectionism-driven exercisers become agitated 
over unavoidable disturbances in their routine. "If they like to work out for 
one hour, but due to business responsibilities can work out for only 52 
minutes, that creates stress for them. 
</P>
<P>
"Plus, the time pressure people put themselves under is really a strain -- 
trying to do more and more in less and less time. They carefully jam one hour 
in the schedule to go to the health club, change their clothes, do their 
workout, shower, get dressed and go back to work. So instead of relaxing, 
they're compulsively racing through their routine." 
</P>
<P>
Brenner suggests long, brisk -- and silent -- walks to reduce stress. "Don't 
talk. Don't wear headphones. Lose yourself in the exercise," he said. "Boredom 
is what produces stress reduction." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SHUTTING DOWN A SPEEDING MIND 
</P>
<P>
If you practice meditation in secret for fear your friends will think you're 
weird, come out of hiding: 16% of Orange County residents use meditation or 
yoga to reduce stress, according to The Times Orange County Poll. 
</P>
<P>
Brea cardiologist John Zamarra said he has practiced transcendental meditation 
regularly for 18 years and often recommends it to his patients. "It quiets the 
activity of the mind, and when the mind relaxes, the body relaxes." 
</P>
<P>
The common prescription for transcendental meditation is twice daily, 20 
minutes a stint. TM requires neither chanting nor an unusual posture. "You do 
it sitting in a chair," Zamarra said. "You're not withdrawing, you're not dull; 
you're restfully alert. You've gone beyond thought." 
</P>
<P>
The meditation is not intended as a quick fix for periodic bouts of anxiety, 
Zamarra said. "It's more an overall improvement in the body's resilience to 
handle stressful situations. I liken it to brushing your teeth to prevent 
cavities. You don't start brushing your teeth after you have the pain." 
</P>
<P>
Zamarra believes stress-management techniques, whether through meditation or 
another form of relaxation, are important in today's society. "I tell my 
patients that a practical way to relax -- be it meditation, yoga, exercise, 
reading or counseling -- is essential to a total health program." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Gray Fallat opts for yoga as her stress reducer. "I'm in a high-stress 
profession," said the 46-year-old restaurant manager. "Yoga slows me down 
internally." 
</P>
<P>
Fallat, a Santa Ana resident, started taking yoga classes six years ago. "I was 
losing my wits while managing a restaurant in North Hollywood, partly because I 
was commuting 80 miles a day. My friends were worried about me. One of them 
suggested yoga." 
</P>
<P>
With some reluctance, she gave yoga a try -- and loved it. Her husband soon 
thereafter took her lead. "We never imagined we would be so involved in yoga," 
she laughed. "We didn't think we were the yoga types. Since I've been 
practicing yoga, I feel less stress in general -- less of it seeps in." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DON'T DRIVE YOURSELF CRAZY 
</P>
<P>
When you're stalled in a traffic jam, the world can look like an awful place to 
be. What are all these jerks doing on your personal freeway? Why didn't you 
move to Fresno years ago? Why did your dumb boss make you drive into Los 
Angeles today? 
</P>
<P>
Calm down. Working yourself into a tizzy isn't going to get you to your 
destination any faster -- nor will it enhance your driving enjoyment. 
</P>
<P>
"Just say to yourself, 'I'm here, there's nothing I can do about it,' and move 
into an accepting state," said Suzanne Hard, a Laguna Beach-based business 
consultant who presents seminars on stress reduction. 
</P>
<P>
Although the snail's pace of traffic is beyond our control, the tantrum is not, 
Hard said. "We tend to think that the upset is outside of us, that it's 
somebody else's fault. It's that attitude of victimization that gets us hooked 
on thinking, 'This is terrible.' " 
</P>
<P>
She suggested that commuters, first off, quit fiddling with the car radio in 
search of traffic updates. "You already know you're stuck, so do something 
pleasant with your time. I never leave the house without a bag of educational 
tapes. Then if I get stuck in traffic, I say, 'Well, I thought I was going to 
get one hour of listening to tapes; instead I'm going to get two hours.' " 
</P>
<P>
Assume the worst before you even open your car door. "To say you can get to 
L.A. in an hour these days causes stress right away, because most often it 
takes more time than that," Hard said. "Leave early, take your favorite book, 
and if you arrive 30 minutes ahead of schedule, go to a coffee shop and read."

<MEMO>  Health &amp; Fitness; How I Stay Fit  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 128 pounds;   PERSONAL: Single and lives in San Jose;   OCCUPATION:
Fourth grade teacher, Anderson School in San Jose;   FITNESS BACKGROUND: For
five years during junior and senior high school, Caffiero rode 50 miles a day
on his bike as a messenger. That didn't leave time for sports. Besides, he
says, "I always felt I wasn't athletic. When I played football I got creamed,
on skates I was a klutz, and in center field I always hoped the ball would
fall into my glove." He lost his hair in junior high school -- heredity, he
says -- and started wearing a hairpiece, which made swimming impossible and
weightlifting uncomfortable because of perspiration. "I was never successful
at anything I tried. I started closing down and putting up a wall of armor."; 
 While studying psychology at San Jose State, he turned to an aikido class as
his way "out of hiding." Physical size didn't matter, and he liked the win-win
situation involved when working with a partner while training. Ten years ago
he added tai chi, another system that involves more balance, poise and a
"mindful presence." Three years ago he rounded out his routine with yoga to
concentrate on breath and body alignment without movement.;   REGIMEN: Aikido
and yoga classes on alternating mornings are "my cup of coffee before work,"
he says. He takes tai chi on Tuesday evenings and teaches it on Thursdays.
After another yoga class on Saturday mornings, he teaches two hours of aikido.
And on Sunday mornings, when he isn't hiking in Big Basin, he practices yoga
before going to church services at Center for Spiritual Enlightenment in San
Jose. Caffiero still rides a bike, but it's a tandem now, about 15 miles
round-trip on weekends when he has a partner. He gave up desserts four years
ago, eats fruit in the mornings, and complex carbohydrates and vegetables the
rest of the day.;   RESULTS: He doesn't get sick, he says, even with children
sneezing on him all day. A former "watcher" who too frequently said "I won't,"
"I shouldn't," and "not enough," Caffiero now says, "I'm a participating
person who says, 'there's nothing I can't.' ";   GOALS: To give away what he's
learned. All the money he earns from teaching martial arts is donated to his
church. "It's a form of tithing," he says. "There's a universal energy that
gets us through life, and church is a great support system for that.";  
OBSTACLES: "Ten percent of the time, I don't feel like going (to class), but
half of that time I go anyway and am always glad I did." On the mornings he
decides to skip, he takes a walk, does "mental gymnastics" or goes to school
early.;   TIPS AND COMMENTS: Unlike other forms of exercise that are done
"outside the body," Caffiero says his exercises are more joyful and meaningful
because of the way body, mind and spirit are integrated. "I am comfortable
with my body and am at ease being inside it."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Thousands of Romanians Turn to Yoga to Seek Inner Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINA PIRVULESCU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With their outer world beset by
economic hardships and political turmoil, several thousand
Romanians turned to yoga Wednesday in an effort to seek inner peace.
   More than 2,000 people gathered in the capital's Polivalenta
Hall _ once used for government-organized rallies in support of
deposed Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu _ for a yoga
convention.
   The gathering was organized by a group of yoga specialists from
different European countries.
   Ceausescu, ousted in December's revolution, banned yoga in the
early 1980s after a group of prominent intellectuals held a
``transcendental meeting'' at the Institute of Psychiatry.
Participants were later demoted from their posts and the institute
was closed down.
   As Oriental music played in the background and the scent of
burning incense filled the air, Romanians of all ages kicked off
their shoes and sought inspiration through yoga.
   Antonio Nazare, a French assistant to the Indian guru Shri
Mataji, exhorted the crowd to ``regain their inner peace,''
instructing them to reach out with their hands a huge framed
photograph of the Shri ``to absorb her energy.''
   ``I'm asking you to experience the peace of the self ... here
where comfort is more difficult to attain than in other places in
the world,'' Nazare said.
   Most of those attending the yoga meeting said they wanted to
seek refuge from the tension and confusion that have gripped
Romania since December's bloody revolution.
   ``I am happy to discover that I can find peace and calm in the
general political pandemonium with yoga,'' said 31-year-old
engineer Sandu Bidan. ``I can also find liberty.''
   Romania is suffering a severe economic crisis, marked by
shortages of many basic consumer goods. Political tensions have
been on the rise since June when the government of President Ion
Iliescu broke up a demonstration by anti-Communist activists and
jailed dozens of opponents.
   Nazare said he expected even more people to attend a second
Bucharest yoga meeting scheduled for Thursday.
   He also announced that Shri Mataji planned to visit Romania in
October. Mataji has been touring Eastern Europe, and recently
appeared before 15,000 people in Bulgaria, Nazare said.

<HEAD>Quirky How-To Cassettes Highlight Video Convention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Entertainment Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps ``Room Arranging Dos and Don'ts''
won't sell as many videocassettes as ``Batman.'' But business for
how-to videos is up, and even the most obscure instructional
cassettes have a chance.
   At the ninth annual Video Software Dealers Association
Convention here this week, hit films like ``Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles'' are drawing most of the attention from the 15,000 video
retailers, distributors and producers. In the corners of the VSDA's
convention floor, though, lurk more intriguing productions.
   Pacific Arts Video offers ``Sirius Puppy Training,'' with hints
on how to teach man's best friend to sit, stay, heel and go to the
bathroom outdoors. The Crocus video distribution company is pleased
with sales for ``Aerobics With Soul,'' a workout set to African
music. Wood Knapp Video is featuring ``Yo-Yo Man,'' an
instructional cassette hosted by the Smothers Brothers that comes
with a free yo-yo.
   ``The how-to, self-instruction category is one of the fastest
growing,'' said John Bjerke of Better Homes &amp; Gardens Video. In
addition to its new ``Room Arranging'' release, Better Homes is
selling the popular ``Building a Deck,'' ``Refinishing Furniture,''
``Wallpaper Like a Pro!'' and ``Foolproof Flower Beds.''
   According to figures compiled by Nielsen Media Research,
exercise and instructional titles accounted for an estimated 16
percent of pre-recorded cassettes sold last year. Another study
found that demand for instructional titles is growing.
   Two of the four most popular selections from Wishing Well
Distribution are yoga cassettes: ``Alive With Yoga With Lilias
Folan'' and ``Richard Hittleman's Yoga Course.''
   ``People are focusing more on stress reduction and relaxation
these days,'' said Wishing Well's Kim Heron. ``And that's what yoga
is.'' The cmpany's sales more than doubled from 1988 to 1989.
   Proudly proclaiming ``Identify birds by video!,'' MasterVision
is showcasing a five-volume series called ``The Audubon Society's
Video Guide to Birds of North America.''
   ``It's sight and sound _ perfect for bird-watching,'' said
MasterVision President Richard Stadin. ``No book can do this. Books
are two-dimensional, but the video is three-dimensional.''
   Other MasterVision cassettes include one on little-league
baseball tactics and ``Basic Arabic by Video.'' ``This is very
current today,'' Stadin noted.
   Not all of the new how-to titles are necessarily tame. Playboy
Home Video introduced ``Secrets of EuroMassage,'' with a Playboy
bunny giving convention goers free massages to help boost sales.
   One how-to video that would interest convention guests isn't
available in any booth. That's a cassette that would give
distributors and retailers tips to help stop slowing video sales
and consumer dissatisfaction.
   In a glum convention keynote address, Robert Klingensmith,
president of the Paramount Picture's video division, said that
after 10 years of explosive growth the cassette business now has
stalled.
   ``We have new customers who are hard to reach and old customers
whose interests may be waning or need to be reinforced,''
Klingensmith said. He called on store owners to make the practice
of renting and buying tapes more pleasant.
   To help generate business, Paramount pledged $100,000 to a
proposed industry-wide advertising campaign that would highlight
the joys of videocassettes.
   For another reason, Paramount wasn't welcomed warmly on the
convention floor. Its decision to sell copies of ``The Hunt for Red
October'' at a retail price of $99.95 _ instead of the traditional
$89.95 or less _ means that many store owners may have to raise
their rental fees or see their profit margins narrow.

<HEAD>Vatican Warns of Eastern Meditation Practices</HEAD>
<HEAD>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Vatican warned Catholics on Thursday
that such methods as Zen, yoga and Transcendental Meditation can
``degenerate into a cult of the body,'' and it urged proper
Christian prayer.
   A document issued by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine
of the Faith, the pope's guardian of orthodoxy, said increased
attempts to fuse Eastern and Catholic meditation pose ``dangers and
errors.''
   It said these efforts ``need to have their contents and methods
ever subjected to a thorough-going examination so as to avoid the
danger of falling into syncretism'' _ the merging of different
religious practices.
   It was believed the first time the Vatican has addressed
publicly the problems raised by what it ackowledged is the strong
attraction for some Catholics of methods inspired by Eastern
religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism.
   The 23-page document, approved by Pope John Paul II and
addressed to bishops, said some forms of Eastern meditation can be
positive.
   ``One can take from them what is useful as so long as the
Christian conception of prayer, its logic and requirements are
never obscured,'' the document said.
   ``The love of God, the sole object of Christian contemplation,
is a reality which cannot be `mastered' by any method or
technique,'' it added.
   The congregation president, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger of West
Germany, said the report was not condemning Eastern methods but
elaborating on guidelines for genuine Christian prayer.
   ``The fundamental affirmation of the document is very simple,''
Ratzinger told a news conference. ``Christian meditation is not
submersion in an impersonal divine atmosphere, in an abyss without
face or form.''
   Without identifying them, Ratzinger and other Vatican officials
said the document was directly especially to religious movements,
associations, prayer groups, monasteries and convents that have
strayed in the use of Eastern meditation practices.
   The document defined Christian prayer as a ``personal, intimate
and profound dialogue between man and God.''
   Such prayer ``flees from impersonal techniques or from
concentrating on oneself, which can create a kind of rut,
imprisoning the person praying in a spriritual privatism.''
   In a footnote, the document described Eastern methods as Zen,
Transcendental Meditation and yoga, which involves prescribed
postures and controlled breathing.
   The document said some Catholics turn to these techniques for
therapeutic reasons and to escape from the stress and pressures of
modern-day life.
   ``Without doubt, a Christian needs certain periods of retreat
into solitude to be recollected and, in God's presence, rediscover
his path,'' it said. ``Nevertheless ... his method of getting
closer to God is not based on any technique in the strict sense of
the word.''
   The church has faced the problem of ``erroneous ways of
praying'' from its early history, the document said. These forms
``seem once more to impress many Christians, appealing to them as a
kind of remedy, be it psychological or spiritual, or as a quick way
of finding God,'' it said.
   The document expressed particular concern over misconceptions
about body postures in meditation.
   It said the exercise of the ``Jesus Prayer,'' which is adapted
to the natural rhythm of breathing, can ``be of real help to many
people.'' The ``Jesus Prayer'' consists of repeating a formula of
invocation and supplication such as ``Lord Jesus Christ, Son of
God, have mercy on me.''
   But other forms of Eastern ``psychological symbolism'' can
``degenerate into a cult of the body and can lead surreptitiously
to considering all bodily sensations as spiritual experiences,''
the document said.
   ``Some physical experiences,'' it added, ``automatically produce
a feeling of quiet and relaxation, pleasing sensations, perhaps
even phenomena of light and of warmth, which resemble spiritual
well-being. To take such feelings for authentic consolations of the
Holy Spirit, would be a totally erroneous way of conceiving the
spriritual life.''
   A false mystical experience represents ``a kind of mental
schizophrenia which could also lead to psychic disturbance and, at
times, to moral deviations.''
   Ratzinger said improper forms of meditation are based on
egotistical concerns.
   ``The spiritual or infinite which has assumed an impersonal
dimension becomes simply a bath, in which the human being
strengthens himself ... Religion becomes a flight into pleasing
sensations or therapeutic means,'' he said.
   Asked whether he accepts yoga, Ratzinger said it was a
simplistic question which he could not answer simply. But he said
he opposed forms which ``become only a therapeutic technique or a
type of sport.''

<LEADPARA>  IF YOU could buy fitness, chances are it would be this season's most popular
gift. Who wouldn't like stronger muscles, a leaner body or a healthier heart?
But even though you can't shape up your loved one for the holidays, you can
wish them well with a gift geared to boosting their joy of motion.;   But
before you plunk down your gold card for the latest fitness fad consider this:
"The No. 1 thing I see is people spending a fair amount of money on exercise
equipment, then not using it," says Coke Farmer, director of the Wellness
Research Lab at the University of Maryland. To ensure that your gift doesn't
get stuffed in a closet or sold at the next yard sale, make sure it's
something the recipient is at least reasonably interested in, she advises.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It has to be fun or it won't get done.;   Think childhood;   If you're
shopping for a sedentary adult who needs to get moving, think back to the
activities that person enjoyed as a child. Then look for items that will help
them start dancing, swimming, bicycling or playing ball again. If your gift is
for a child, consider active toys such as skates, balls, pogo sticks,
mini-trampolines, jump ropes, Frisbees and sleds. Or choose something that can
get the whole family moving together, such as a ping pong table, basketball
backboard, bicycles or rollerblades all around.;   If you're considering
expensive equipment, always try before you buy, and ask if you can rent the
item for a few weeks first. Expect to spend at least $400 for a good
stationary bike, stair climber, ski machine or rower, and several thousand
dollars for a treadmill.;   In general, pick sturdy over pretty and buy the
best equipment you can afford as an investment you'll use hard and often.
Shoddily made items are likely to break down or work improperly, so they're no
bargain. If you need to shave dollars, choose a well-made, no-frills model
without fancy electronics or decorator colors. Or check the ads for a good,
used one.;   Go to the pros;   When buying for a sophisticated exerciser, shop
at a sports specialty store and get advice from a knowledgeable sales clerk.
Or consider a gift certificate from his or her favorite pro shop. Always be
sure -- particularly if you're buying for someone else -- that the gift is
returnable.;   You don't have to spend a nickel for a fitness gift. Promise to
walk with someone daily, become their workout buddy or teach them an activity
you know -- from the fox trot to a slam dunk. If you have up to $100 to spend,
here's a sample of exercising options:;   (check) Fitness evaluation and/or
exercise session with a personal trainer, about $30 to $60. To find a good
one, contact a university physical education department, hospital-based sports
medicine facility or reputable gym.;   (check) Hand or ankle weights, about
$15 to $25 per set.;   (check) Audio tapes with exercise instruction, great
music or books read aloud to accompany exercise activities, $10 to $15.;  
(check) Belt with sleeve for personal stereo, about $15.;   (check) Exercise
mat, about $30.;   (check) Fitness book, such as "The Aerobics Program for
Total Well-Being," by Kenneth H. Cooper ($12.95), "Fit for Success," by James
M. Rippe ($19.95) or "Walking Off Weight" ($8.95) by Rob Sweetgall.;   (check)
Subscription to a fitness magazine, such as Walking, Shape or Runner's World
($12 to $18).;   (check) One-hour sports massage, about $50.;   (check)
Membership in a fitness organization, such as the American Running and Fitness
Association, $25 for an individual, or the League of American Wheelmen, $25.; 
 (check) Appointment with a sports nutritionist, about $60.;   (check) Lessons
with a pro, from $20 per half-hour on up.;   (check) Series of aerobics or
yoga classes, about $8 to $12 per class.;   (check) Workout videos, such as
"Creative Steps" with Tim Culwell for intermediate/advanced bench steppers
($29.95), Jane Fonda's new Lower Body System for all levels, ($19.95) or Yoga
Journal's Yoga for Beginners ($29.95). For a free, 47-page guide to exercise
videos call Collage Video, (800) 433-6769.;   (check) Safety gear. Kneepads,
helmets, gloves and reflective vests for bikers, skateboarders, roller
skaters, $10 on up.;   (check) Aerobic bench, like the adjustable Step II,
which retails for $64.95 (call (800) 729-7837), or the 8-inch BenchStep 2000,
$54.95, plus about $8 shipping (800-25-BENCH) or the 6-inch TUFF-BENCH,
$44.95, plus $4 shipping (219-665-1635).;   (check) Walking shoes, gift

How I Stay Fit  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 118 pounds;    PERSONAL: Single mother of two grown children. She
lives in Morgan Hill.;    OCCUPATION: Office manager, Seagull Precision Inc.
in Morgan Hill.;    FITNESS BACKGROUND: Three years after the birth of her
second child, Campbell felt she could no longer justify weighing 140 pounds by
saying, "I just had a baby.";    She started yoga classes and began jogging.
The pounds began to drop, "but I never enjoyed it. All I could think about
while running was when I would be done." A year later she tried an aerobics
class and enjoyed it so much she taught at the Morgan Hill YMCA for nine
years. "Unlike running, the hour was always up before I thought about it.";   
REGIMEN: For the past two years, since Campbell quit teaching, she has been
working out every weekday morning at home. She begins a 45-minute aerobics
workout at 5 a.m., which is followed by a weight routine for her upper body
and a cool-down period of yoga and meditation. On weekends, she prefers
unstructured workouts and a change of pace, which include mountain biking and
hikes.;    She is careful about what she eats, but rewards herself
occasionally. "When I'm tempted to binge, I use a few mental tricks, like
reminding myself how that two minutes of pleasure lowers my self-esteem and is
not worth it, compared to the long-term pleasure I get from looking and
feeling good.";    RESULTS: "My doctor says I have the heart of an athlete. I
have incredible energy and stamina, and my self-esteem is boosted --
especially when I'm with my daughter and people say, 'You can't possibly be
her mother.' ";    GOALS: "To live each day to the fullest and keep exercise a
priority in my life.";    OBSTACLES: "They are created in your mind. If I have
to, I push myself because I know I'll regret it later in the day if I don't.
It helps that I am a morning person, though, because if I waited until I got
home from work, I'd be doomed.";    TIPS AND COMMENTS: "When you feel healthy
and fit, enthusiasm and enjoyment of life is enhanced by your age."  </TEXT>

FT  17 JUL 93 / How To Spend It: Fit for a Fiver: test-drive your body -
Lucia van der Post on the FT's latest offer which allows readers to try out
their local health and fitness centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'SHE LIKED going to the gym, or rather, she liked having been to the gym,
and the only way to have been was to go.'
Suzanne Vale in Postcards from the Edge by Carrie Fisher.
IN JANUARY, just when most of us were feeling at our lowest, the Weekend FT
gave readers the chance to lunch for a fiver at many of the country's top
restaurants. Now, at the start of the high holiday season, just when our
bodies are most on show, the Weekend FT offers a chance to get Fit for a
Fiver.
Health and fitness centres are one of the business phenomena of the age.
From Land's End to John O'Groats classes in everything from step aerobics
and yoga, from cross-training to weight-lifting and Stretch 'n' Tone are on
offer while in the treatment rooms the pampering with oils and lotions and
potions goes on. No smart hotel wooing sophisticated international customers
would hope to get by without a mini-spa and almost every small town has one.
But there are plenty of us who have never been near one. If you have ever
wondered just what goes on in them or what they could possibly offer you,
now is the time to find out.
The FT's Lunch for a Fiver offer is a hard act to follow but we believe many
of you will jump at the chance to try our Fit for a Fiver scheme. Around 100
top health and leisure clubs have agreed to open up their clubs and allow FT
readers to sample their facilities for just Pounds 5 a time.
All the clubs have been carefully selected - we wanted to give a good
geographical spread so that as many readers as possible could benefit and we
wanted to make sure the clubs could cope with the demand. Though no two
clubs are identical they all have a gym and offer a proper fitness
assessment, a range of classes and treatments and many, but not all, have
swimming pools and saunas.
For your fiver you can enjoy everything a member enjoys for half a day,
including a fitness assessment and one of the available exercise classes.
The specialist beauty treatments and therapies are not included.
The fitness assessment varies slightly from club to club but all should take
a verbal history of illnesses and injuries, test the blood pressure, weigh
and measure you, do some sort of cardio-vascular test which usually involves
assessing the heart-beat when resting and after several minutes of vigorous
exercise. Some add in blood tests, many do fat tests (a most unedifying
business - callipers measure the fat at different points on the body), some
test oxygen intake, some test cholesterol.
Fit for a Fiver starts today and runs up to and including Friday, August 13.
The list of clubs is printed in the box on the right of this page and if you
want to have a go all you need to do is make an appointment with the club of
your choice, take along the application form (also printed here) and present
it together with your Pounds 5. If you are keen to try, I suggest you lose
no time - those who dithered about where to go for lunch for a fiver found
that most of the restaurants they wanted to try were already booked up.
Of course, we are not suggesting that any of our readers could possibly
become truly fit after just one visit to a health club but what we are
hoping is that it may be just the kick-start that many of you need to embark
on a sensible sustained programme of exercise. Now is your chance to build
up your muscles, to tackle your cellulite, to try out a facial, to get rid
of the flab and generally feel better and stronger.
It should give anybody who has been seriously considering joining a gym or
health club a wonderful opportunity to see just what they have to offer and
to talk through, at the fitness assessment, just what you hope to achieve -
greater aerobic fitness, greater suppleness or strength or simply a modicum
of gentle exercise such as yoga, some complementary treatments and
companionship. If you do decide to join afterwards (and absolutely no
pressure will be put on you to do so) a good club should help you find ways
of doing all this.
One of the great mysteries is why, when almost everybody agrees that a
certain amount of exercise is essential for most people's health and sense
of well-being, so few people actually do anything about it. I reported
earlier this year how Allied Dunbar (which produced an excellent study on
the physical state of the nation) had found that though four out of five
people believe some form of exercise is good for them only half of those who
believed it ever got around to doing anything about it.
Dr James M Rippe (Associate Professor of Medicine at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School) in a series of learned papers on the research
into the effects of exercise on people with medical ailments as well as
healthy people is in no doubt at all about the benefits. 'The jury is in,'
he writes - he may be short on colourful phrases but his message is clear -
'There can no longer be any doubt that daily habits and practices have a
profound impact on long-term health . . . the decision to lead an active
life is one of the most positive steps an individual can take not only to
improve quality of life but also to reduce the risk of developing a host of
chronic diseases.' More than that: 'A sedentary lifestyle, is hazardous to
an individual's health.'
But this does not mean you have to go in for pain and punishment. Those who
fear that a gym or health club has nothing to offer but stress, sweat and
toil should take heart. Health clubs these days are much gentler, less
punishing places, as concerned about reducing stress as taking off the
inches and increasing aerobic strength. Holistic is the buzz-word for
1990s-style clubs. Dr Rippe, for instance, in his researches found that
'gentle exercise, such as slow or moderate paced walking, when coupled with
a cognitive component, such as the 'mindful' exercise disciplines of yoga or
t'ai chi or other relaxation techniques (which most up-to-date clubs offer),
results in immediate physical and psychological benefits.'
I've always felt we could learn a lot from the French when it comes to
health and beauty. When things begin to get her down, a French woman (and in
case this sounds sexist let me just say I don't recall any French men having
recourse to this particular ploy) can indulge in a small crise, nothing too
serious, of course, just a little crise, of les nerfs or la foie, depending
on her temperament, which then allows her to indulge herself at one of those
marvellous instituts de beaute that are so practised at recognising the
intimate connection between health and beauty. There women are pampered and
polished, massaged and soothed and, if things are really serious, they go in
for a cure de detente, from which they emerge all cleansed and rested ready
to face the world again.
British clubs are at last adopting something of this approach. Women readers
will find many of the clubs absolute havens - no longer cold and draughty
with inadequate showering arrangements, most of them now go in for piles of
fluffy towels, generous boxes of tissues, plenty of hot showers,
hair-dryers, restaurants with delicious (but low-fat) food.
They are places where you can take time out from the world, where you can
have any or all of the lovely pampering treatments that are part of today's
approach to health and beauty . . . aromatherapy, massage, facials,
manicures, reflexology. You do not need to perform like a hamster on a
treadmill or sweat away re-aligning your muscles. Today health and fitness
clubs are much more like the old-fashioned, proper clubs . . . places where
you can go to feel good, to swim or have a massage, take a class, have a
meal and meet some friends.
My final thought is that if you take as your motto 'If I don't enjoy it I'm
not going to do it' you cannot go far wrong. Have a go - you may enjoy it
all a great deal more than you think.
Over the next two weeks a selection of participating clubs will be listed
daily in the FT. The application form will be included on alternate days.

   What's in a name? Plenty, if it happens to be
Spa, Belgium. For that town in the eastern Ardennes with its
healing waters has given its name worldwide to the spots where
people go to feel better, shape up physically, unknot their
tensions, shed excess pounds and be pampered with manicures,
pedicures, facials, hair-styling and the like.
   Spa, Belgium, was mentioned by the Roman Pliny the Elder in the
first century A.D., it is believed. In the Middle Ages, its healing
waters began to be exploited. Beginning in about the 16th century,
royalty including Margaret of Navarre, Queen Christina of Sweden,
Peter the Great of Russia and Austrian Emperor Joseph II frequented
the resort.
   It is still there, catering not only to those who seek a
``cure,'' but to those who just want a pleasant vacation, with
golf, riding, fishing, tennis, a casino, concerts, a nearby
racetrack and parachute jumping exhibits at a nearby airfield.
   From Alaska to Brazil and Australia and Japan to Greece and
Hungary, people are going to spas _ all kinds of spas.
   Spa-Finders, which puts out a spa catalogue and also uses a
computer to help match people with the right spa for them, lists
eight major categories. They include classic fitness spas that
combine exercise, diet and relaxation in fairly equal proportions;
spas that specialize in behavior modification; those that feature
mineral springs, and holistic spas. The holistic spas are often
vegetarian and offer such Eastern practices as yoga and Siatsu
massage.
   Spas have a vocabulary of their own _ including Siatsu, which is
a Japanese method of massage that follows the patterns used in
acupuncture. A person can become involved with a Scotch hose, Swiss
shower, salt glo, polarity, reflexology, thalassotherapy _ or sit
it out in a Roman bath, a heated sea-water jacuzzi with benches.
   The average person pedaling an exercise bike and swimming laps
at the ``Y'' may think spas are not for her or him. Too expensive.
Not so, say the spa people, who say you can find some costing only
a few hundred dollars a week per person.
   Ryan Vollmer, in ``Affordable Spas &amp; Fitness Resorts,'' says
nearly 90 percent of spas now operating in the United States cost
less than $1,000 a week, and some are priced in the $400 to $500
range.
   Some are advertised for even less: Spend a week at a New
Hampshire retreat that emphasizes stress-reduction by massage,
yoga, meditation, long walks in the woods, sunbathing and swimming,
for instance. Or you can get spruced up at a resort hotel and spa
in the Arkansas Hot Springs National Park-Ouachita Mountain area.
In California, one is invited to bathe in hot springs at
temperatures of 98 to 120 degrees at a kerosene-lit hotel on ground
that was considered sacred for healing by the Indians. Bring your
own food and cook it on a country stove. All these places are under
$400.
   At the other end of the price list are such establishments as
California's Golden Door, whose fans insist it's worth every bit of
the more than $3,000 one will spend for a week's hospitality.
   Jeffrey Joseph of Spa-Finders has found that the spa market is a
United States one. If Americans go abroad, he says, it's usually to
well-known resorts such as Montecatini in Italy, Baden-Baden, West
Germany, or Baden, Switzerland.
   But there are bargains waiting all over Europe and other
countries - including Australia, Margaret Island in the Danube at
Budapest, the Greek island of Kos, Yugoslavia and Austria _ and
Spa, Belgium.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Sally Kirkland Has Retained Her Vivacity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year ago, Sally Kirkland won an Academy
Award nomination as best actress and became the year's Cinderella
story, even if the coach and horses arrived a few decades late.
   The actress made her film debut in 1964, then got sidetracked
into off-Broadway plays and underground movies, many of which
displayed ample views of the admirable Kirkland frame. She later
played minor roles in films from ``The Sting'' to ``The Incredible
Shrinking Woman.''
   A few years ago, she campaigned for a low-budget drama, ``Anna,''
adding pounds and aging herself to fit the role of a faded Czech
film actress adrift in New York. She won the role and the
nomination, and no one was more tickled than she with such
recognition.
   Now, four films later, she retains her native vivacity.
   ``I got to turn down 10 to 15 scripts right away, because they
all came at once,'' the 44-year-old actress said. ``I chose the
parts I did because frankly, they gave me chances to make real
contributions; some of the other scripts may have been big-studio
deals, but they were smaller parts.
   ``A lot of people said, `Don't work, wait until you get the next
honest script.' I didn't want to be overly idealistic about that. I
wasn't sure when the `next honest script,' whatever that is, would
come. I wanted to keep working, and so I have been working nonstop.''
   The starring roles are in ``Melanie Rose,'' ``Paint It Black''
and ``Cold Feet.'' She also played a cameo role in ``Revenge,'' with
Kevin Costner and Anthony Quinn.
   ``Cold Feet,'' which will be released in April, is a modern
Western filmed in Montana and Arizona with Kirkland, Keith
Carradine, Tom Waits and Rip Torn. Playing with such an eccentric
group, she said, ``was very much like being a Marx sister.''
   She chose ``Cold Feet'' because ``I was dying to do light comedy
after such a tragic story as `Anna.'
   ``I also got to look very pretty, which I wasn't able to do in
`Anna.' I practically signed my life on the line, saying they could
do a `Raging Bull' number on me. Otherwise I wouldn't get the
part.'' The reference is to the critically acclaimed film about
boxer Jake LaMotta for which Robert DeNiro added 60 pounds.
   ``Revenge'' also took her to a rugged location in Durango, Mexico.
   She was impressed with Kevin Costner: ``He's so human, he's so
real. I pointed out a few things in the script that could be
reworked. Right away he went to Tony (Scott, the director) and said,
`Could Sally and I improvise for you?' Tony was wonderful in the
sense that he let us try new things.''
   Sally Kirkland's ambition came early. Growing up in New York City
the daughter of a fashion editor, she became acquainted with the
rich and famous. An early mentor was legendary producer David O.
Selznick, who predicted she would become a star. But he also
cautioned that she would be a late bloomer.
   The frustration of waiting caused a collapse in 1964.
   ``I think I had a breakdown,'' she recalled. ``I had so many
wide-eyed dreams, and one after another, things started going wrong.
   ``But when I came back, I had learned to meditate, I meditate a
couple of hours now. I do an incredible amount of exercise, Hatha
yoga and dance. I dance like a nut.
   ``I like to think that I have the body of a 20-year-old and the
energy of a 15-year-old. So the minute anything happens in the
business like rejection, I go run a mile, swim a mile, do three
hours back-to-back of hatha yoga, something very physical. Or, I
create a psychodrama session with a couple of actors and scream it
out. I don't sit on it.''
   Kirkland said the Oscar nomination was ``like a dream.''
   ``I was so high. I was like a little 12-year-old, so excited that
I don't think my feet were on the ground. my feet are back on the
ground now, and I'm still kind of amazed.
   ``I ran into a bunch of young actors yesterday, and they told me
how their acting teachers used me as an example in class. That
amazed me. I can remember when I used to look to Kim Stanley,
Geraldine Page and a lot of wonderful Broadway actresses. I thought,
`Oh God, some day I hope I can act as well as them.'''
   She admits that losing the Oscar to Cher was a bummer, since she
had been dreaming of a dark-horse victory. But, characteristically,
the depression didn't last long.
   ``I tell young actors: Make sure you do something else besides
acting. For me, it was painting and teaching. I think that if you do
acting and nothing else, when you're out of work you tend to turn
everything in against yourself and reject yourself,'' she said.
   ``If you have anything else you enjoy doing, particularly of the
arts _ writing, directing, producing, painting, music _ do it.
Because unless you can have fun with the game of the business, the
business is tough. It's tough no matter how you look at it,
particularly for women, although that's changing.

<HEAD>Study Finds Aerobic Exercise Good for Older People, Too</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Healthy older people who did aerobic exercises
in a four-month study improved their physical well-being and their
outlook on life.
   The study of 101 healthy men and women age 60-83 found that
those who participated in an hour-long aerobic exercise program
three times a week showed improved cardiorespiratory fitness, lower
cholesterol, a small weight loss and an increase in bone mineral
content among subjects at risk of bone fractures.
   The moderate-intensity exercise program included a 10-minute
warmup, 30 minutes of bicycling, 15 of brisk walking-jogging and 5
of cool-down exercises.
   Other subjects in the study participated in a yoga and
flexibility exercise program or were part of a control group whose
members did not change their physical activity habits. These groups
showed no improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness.
   While the study found no significant changes in a battery of
psychological tests, members of the aerobic and yoga groups felt
healthier and slept better and ``reported improved family
relations, better sex life, less loneliness and a better social
life ... improved mood, self-confidence and life satisfaction, and
that they had better memory and concentration,'' the researchers
reported.
   Members of the control group noticed little change over the four
months.
   The research, carried out by scientists from Duke University
Medical Center and the North Carolina Spine Center, was financed by
grants from the National Institute on Aging and the National Heart,
Lung and Blood Institute.
   Results of the study, led by Dr. James A. Blumenthal, were
reported in the September issue of The Journal of Gerontology:
Medical Sciences, published by The Gerontological Society of
America.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Residents Often See Life as Over</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elderly people often consider their
life stories to be over by the time they enter a nursing home, says
a sociologist who asked nursing-home residents to divide their
lives into chapters.
   ``Rarely does the last chapter include their current
situation,'' said Jaber Gubrium, of the University of Florida. ``It
may end at retirement or when a spouse dies _ but it rarely ends
with the nursing home.''
   Although the elderly acknowledge their current existence in a
nursing home, they do not deem it part of their lives, Gubrium said.
   His study, funded by the National Institute on Aging, found that
the few people who have close relationships in a nursing home are
likeliest to consider the institution home-like and the experience
a meaningful part of their lives.
   ``When we ask nursing home patients if the place is home,
they'll say `No. It's homey, but it's not home.' One woman who did
call the place home said her roommate was like a sister to her and
several other people were like family to her,'' Gubrium said.
Others said nursing homes would be more like home if they were free
to come and go. Dependence and poor health _ not the nursing home
itself _ separated ``just living'' from life in these people.
   ``We chose people close to the end of life for this study
because we wanted to see if life extends subjectively to the very
end,'' he said.
   Gubrium began his two-year study this fall by interviewing
residents of nursing homes, adult congregate living facilities and
the general community in the Gainesville area. Unlike nursing home
residents, other people in the study include their current living
circumstances as part of their lives.

   Followers of the late Bhagwan Shree
Rajneesh, the free-love guru who was expelled by the United States,
today danced, meditated and chanted the mystic's favorite mantra _
``hoo, hoo, hoo'' _ a day after his death of a heart attack.
   Rajneesh also made a final ``appearance'' before 10,000 of his
followers in a videotape and told them: ``Think deep. Go deeper.''
   The 58-year-old mystic has not named a successor, and his death
Friday launched a wave of speculation about the future of his
commune, its 500 worldwide branches, and its claimed 500,000
members.
   The videotape was played at the mystic's southern commune in the
city of Poona, where Rajneesh set up an international headquarters
after his deportation from the United States in 1985.
   ``Osho is very much here,'' said follower Ma Yoga, using an
honorific name that Rajneesh called himself in recent years. The
term means ``on whom the heavens shower flowers.'' ``Bhagwan'' is a
Hindu honorific meaning ``god.''
   ``It is like any other day here. It does not matter if Osho has
left his body,'' said Ma Yoga, a member of the 23-year-old cult's
Poona commune, in a telephone interview. ``He lives, the commune
lives.''
   A statement from the commune quoted the guru as saying hours
before his death, ``My work will go on and grow stronger after I
leave my body.''
   In a statement telexed from Poona, Rajneesh's personal doctor
said the guru was in pain for many weeks before his death.
   ``I asked Osho if he wanted us to prepare for cardiac
resuscitation, and he said, `No, if I die it will be relief from
the pain,''' said British physician Swami Amrito.
   Rajneesh died of a heart attack, according to a doctor's death
certificate.
   However, a commune statement released today said the guru died
because ``living in the body had become a hell.''
   It repeated Rajneesh's charges he was poisoned in U.S. jails
before he was deported.``While he was in Oklahoma County jail (in
Oklahoma state), he was poisoned with heavy metal thallium. They
exposed him to radiation in a way that it will not leave any
proof.''
   Thallium is used in making rat poison.
   Local health officials said Rajneesh suffered from AIDS, but the
commune denied those reports about two years ago.
   Rajneesh's most famous commune, the Rancho Rajneesh, was founded
in Oregon in 1981.
   He brought his teachings of free sex and materialism to the
scrubby hills near Antelope, Ore., drawing thousands of slavish
disciples. They were rewarded with the guru's daily ``drive-by'' in
one of his 93 Rolls-Royces _ many painted psychedelic colors, and
some decorated with peacocks and lacy curtains.
   To many nearby residents, the commune known as Rajneeshpuram was
a monstrous intrusion. It was disbanded in 1985 when Rajneesh, a
native of India, was expelled from the United States in a plea
bargain on immigration fraud charges.

   Relaxation Classes Rile Many Parents

   CALABASAS, Calif. -- As birds chirp on a tape recorder,
teacher Betty Mehling soothingly instructs her squirming
fourth-graders to lie on the floor. "Make your teeth tight,
your forehead tight]" Ms. Mehling says. "Now let that tension
go free]"
   Later, the children are told to close their eyes and use
the "TV set in your head" to take a guided-imagery tour of a
happy, magical place. "You feel so rested] So nice]" says Ms.
Mehling, who knows a restful state when she sees it: She
isn't called Lupin Hill Elementary School's "relaxation
teacher" for nothing.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Even here in California, the mecca of mellowness, kids are
stressed out. "These little five-year-olds are coming to
school tight as rocks," says Jeanne St. John, director of the
relaxation program for Santa Cruz County's public schools,
where most teachers take an "experiencing energy" course to
help them relax their pupils.
   Lupin Hill's weekly 30-minute
kindergarten-through-fifth-grade relaxation program is only
one of a number of public-school projects aimed at easing
student tensions with approaches ranging from drawing to deep
breathing to massage.
   "Relaxation should be the fourth `R,'" says Ms. Mehling.
Because it promotes better health, creativity and an ability
to concentrate, she says, relaxation "helps kids be their
best -- in sports, academics, and emotionally."
   One of Ms. Mehling's pupils, nine-year-old Kyle
Burlingame, says he switches on his mental TV set every
night, sometimes envisioning Lupin Hill Elementary -- not as
a school but as a playground. "It really helps me get to
sleep," he says.
   But as relaxation programs proliferate around the U.S. --
in part to provide coping mechanisms for drug, alcohol and
classroom-violence problems -- they are increasingly meeting
vehement opposition from conservative Christian groups, who
many teachers say represent a vocal minority of parents.
   Some critics warn that relaxation techniques are "mind
control" or can undermine parental authority and undercut
home-taught religious beliefs. As a legal basis, some claim
relaxation classes violate separation of church and state by
promoting aspects of Eastern religion.
   Last Tuesday, Michigan's statewide model health-education
program dropped the use of deep-breathing stress-reduction
exercises because of opposition from Christian parents. The
one million elementary and junior-high-school students who
take the class will instead be taught to count to 10 or put
their heads on their desks.
   In Pinellas County, Fla., scores of parents pulled their
kids out of classes conducting stress-reduction exercises,
then threatened to move to the courts and got the program
banned. They argued successfully that the use of guided
imagery, where elementary students were to envision a "wise
person" to counsel them through trouble, was a form of mind
control. New Mexico's Education Department has asked all
school-district counselors to refrain from such techniques
without an express policy and parental consent; a pending
Georgia law, if passed, would require parental review for use
of deep breathing to relax.
   Even at Lupin Hill, where most parents strongly support
and finance anti-stress programs, some raise concerns that
the techniques might constitute a quasi-religious experience;
the school now requires parental consent. One parent, James
R. Buckley, has his two stepchildren sent to the library
during the classes. He wrote to the school that guided
imagery is satanic in origin and that Ms. Mehling's class
taught his children they could control their emotions and
world "to the exclusion of their relationship with God."
   Such concerns helped kill a two-year statewide pilot
program in Minnesota in 1987. Minnetonka, Minn., minister
Patrick Misener accused the schools of using pagan religious
practices. "I can't bring Christianity into the schools, and
they shouldn't be able to use this, even if it's under the
guise of helping children," says Mr. Misener, who with others
petitioned the St. Paul school board to ban "New Age or
Hindu" techniques.
   "They are teaching the child to escape reality by going
within themselves," charges Lou Souders, co-host of a
Marietta, Ga., Baptist church-sponsored radio show that last
year was instrumental in prodding the Cobb County school
board to ban all therapeutic uses of such relaxation
techniques as yoga and guided imagery.
   On one radio program, a mother described how her
five-year-old dealt with a nagging younger brother by
withdrawing into an imaginary world. Shaken out of the state,
the girl was said to have told her parent, "Oh Mommy -- I was
in the most beautiful place inside of me. When I go there, no
one can bother me."
   The subject is so volatile that "it's almost like talking
about abortion," observes Robert Moore, supervisor of
elementary health and physical education for schools in Cobb
County.
   Christians' criticisms aren't the only obstacle to the
programs: Some parents fret that such therapies, because they
involve physical contact, could lead to child molestation,
and some psychologists worry about the power of such
techniques as guided imagery getting into the wrong hands.
   All the criticism notwithstanding, educators around the
country are pressing forward with relaxation classes. A third
of Lincoln, Neb., elementary schools this year are testing
anti-stress programs, despite opposition from several hundred
parents, and a number of other programs in the Midwest and
South seem to be surviving controversy.
   Schools promoting anti-stress classes can point to
research supporting the concept. Studies tie overproduction
of stress-related hormones to imbalanced immune systems and
such health problems as heart disease, cancer, hypertension,
diabetes and asthma. Stress has a more profound effect on
cholesterol levels than does diet, says the Yonkers, N.Y.,
American Institute of Stress.
   Michael Bernard, a visiting scholar at New York's
Institute for Rational-Emotive Therapy, estimates that as
many as 35% of the nation's children have moderate to extreme
stress. It is a condition that can have a "devastating"
effect on school performance, according to Harvard Medical
School psychiatric professor Steven Berglas. And while
"children are more stressed than ever," according to Philip
C. Kendall, director of Temple University's child and
adolescent anxiety disorders clinic, stress is expected to
mount as youngsters are pushed to tackle academic and other
responsibilities for which they aren't developmentally
prepared.
   Outside of the school programs, "no one is communicating
to children how to deal with" stressful situations, says
Saratoga, Calif., stress consultant Donna Wolf. Moreover,
schools pressed to boost academic performance compound the
problem by curtailing such traditional scholastic stress
antidotes as music classes and recreational programs.
   Those schools fighting stress point to the academic
benefits that can be derived from relaxation programs. A
study of four Prince Georges County, Md., schools found
elementary-school children who received two 30-minute
Introduction to Stress classes had higher reading and math
scores, and Irvine, Calif., anti-stress students rolled up
higher grades, fewer absences and a stronger ability to
resist substance abuse. In Santa Cruz, three-quarters of the
special-education children studied showed gains in
psycho-motor, communication and other skills after stress
training.
   Once skeptical, Lupin Hill teachers now rave about
relaxation. "Tension tends to close {pupils'} minds," says
Joan Bitter. When her fifth-graders fidget or tap their
pencils, she has them sit in a "magic circle" and give each
other neck rubs. Before tests, she guides children to an
imaginary beach and into tide pools. "I don't see the
screaming, the anti-social behavior anymore," she says.
   At Lupin Hill, 10-year-old Sheila Rothstein tells how she
uses Ms. Mehling's techniques: "Sometimes, I get so stressed
out. . . . When I'm nervous, I use the TV set in my head. I
tighten up my muscles. I close my eyes. I imagine I'm at the
beach." Before going to sleep, she imagines her house full of
animals for her to play with -- hamsters, cats, rabbits.
"When I wake up, I feel so much better."
   Many of Sheila's schoolmates also say they have begun
using Ms. Mehling's techniques outside school. Eight-year-old
Lauren Frescia says she used relaxation tools when her
friend, Nicole, poured water on her doll. And when another
friend, Tiffany, was troubled watching her parents splitting
up, she taught her how to do deepbreathing exercises to feel
better. "I helped her lots," she says.
   "A majority of parents understand we aren't trying to
create a cult," says Lupin Hill principal James H. Robertson.
"We are just trying to teach children to relax."

<HEADLINE>  SILICON GRAPHICS CEO LOOKS WITHIN FOR NO.

<TEXT>     Not Ed McCracken.;    On Sunday, the president and chief executive officer
of Silicon Graphics Inc. will spend the day teaching a course on Siddha yoga
meditation, an Indian spiritual discipline intended to promote inner peace and
unleash creativity.;    McCracken, 47, is just about the total opposite of an
Indian spiritual guru. An electrical engineer with a master of business
administration degree from Stanford University, McCracken is a tall,
soft-spoken, blond-haired native of Iowa who describes Siddha meditation as a
way of escaping the stress of 80-hour workweeks.;    "Giving myself a day once
a month to spend in meditation is a neat thing with my busy schedule,"
McCracken said. "There's a lot of burn-out in this valley. It's important to
take care of yourself.";    Silicon Valley may be a pressure cooker, but it is
also sprinkled with New Age sensitivity. A CEO in New York, Boston or Chicago
undoubtedly would face considerable pressure not to publicly associate with
anything so untraditional as Siddha meditation. This willingness to experiment
with new ideas is one reason Silicon Valley is so successful and more
innovative than other parts of the country, according to Stanford business
school Professor Michael Ray.;    "I think it's always been accepted here that
if you get the job done, stay on top of the market and treat your people well,
then you're accepted" said Ray, a 14-year Siddha veteran who is joining
McCracken to teach the class Sunday.;    McCracken is certainly getting the
job done. Mountain View-based Silicon Graphics is one of the hottest companies
in Silicon Valley, building sophisticated computer work stations used for
everything from designing jet fighters to creating the special effects for the
movie "Terminator 2." From a start-up in 1982, the company has grown to 2,600
employees and yearly sales of $550 million.;    But McCracken is resisting the
Silicon Valley pattern of overwork that turns individuals into nothing more
than extensions of their jobs.;    "I really am something other than that," he
said. "Here in the valley, there's a lot of encouragement to do new things, to
do things differently than other people." Meditating helps him stay centered
at work, he explained, "detached from the battle at hand" and capable of
looking at the big picture.;    McCracken said he's always had a
"contemplative nature," tracing back to his family's adherence to the Quaker
faith. He was introduced to Siddha meditation by his future wife Sandhya when
the couple met in 1984.;    Siddha is a Sanskrit word that roughly translates
as "perfected." Masters of Siddha meditation strive for a perfected state of
concentration, rising above the distractions of the outside world and their
own bodies to concentrate solely on the Shakti, or spiritual energy, within
their own minds.;    "All meditation is a process of getting in touch with
yourself, a part of you inside that is a source of creativity and inspiration,
happiness and joy," McCracken said. "It's a smart thing to do. Who wants to
live their whole life and never get acquainted with themselves?";    He
typically meditates for 20 minutes in the morning at his Los Altos home,
sitting quietly in a chair. "It's turning the focus inside rather than
outside," McCracken said. "That's it. There's no magic.";    Siddha meditation
is a low-key pursuit, with none of the pressure associated with Indian cult
religions. The Syda Foundation of South Fallsburg, N.Y., which supports Siddha
meditation in the United States, doesn't maintain a list of members and
doesn't proselytize. But the movement's New Age sensitivity is attracting
celebrity supporters, including actress Phylicia Rashad, who plays Bill
Cosby's television wife on "The Cosby Show.";    The all-day seminar on
Sunday, which costs $125, is aimed at introducing Silicon Valley professionals
to Siddha meditation. Participants will gather in an appropriate setting -- a
conference room belonging to the brokerage firm Dean Witter Reynolds on the
11th floor of a downtown San Jose office building. The day will alternate
between lectures and periods of meditation.;     IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The
Siddha yoga meditation seminar will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Sunday
in downtown San Jose. The registration fee is $125. For information on this
seminar and other Siddha meditation seminars to be held later this year at
various South Bay locations, contact Carola B. Hixson at 408-947-3735
(weekdays) or 408-559-0644 (evenings and weekends).  </TEXT>

Age 60 was something of a bummer for Burt DeGroot Jr., of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
Back in his pole vaulting days at Stanford, he had injured his right ankle. The 
years had gone by, and now the effects of that injury were bothering him to the 
point that he had to give up his longtime conditioning program of running and 
jumping and volleyball playing. 
</P>
<P>
"I was dean of student activities at Santa Monica College, and I began using my 
lunch hour, instead of eating, to lift weights in the gym," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tried Putting the Shot 
</P>
<P>
"That was turning out so well that when I reached age 64, my brother, who was 
track coach at Fullerton High School, suggested that I stop by and have a try 
at putting the shot and throwing the discus." 
</P>
<P>
DeGroot, now 82, is busy prepping to compete in the second biennial U.S. 
National Senior Olympics this June in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
His specialty: Shot putting and discus throwing. 
</P>
<P>
"I practice three times a week at San Clemente High School," the octogenarian 
said proudly. "I can put the shot about 28 feet, and I can throw the discus 
about 90 feet." 
</P>
<P>
Many seniors still hesitate to join the fitness craze in America, but what with 
the increasing graying of the nation, attention is turning more and more to the 
issue of what extent older people should participate in exercise. 
</P>
<P>
Surveys, according to the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, 
show that only about one-third of American adults age 65 and older exercise 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Benefits of Activity 
</P>
<P>
This is unfortunate, health experts say. "The four most common chronic 
conditions among adults age 65 and older are arthritis, hypertension, hearing 
impairments and heart disease," said a spokesman for the Council. "All but 
hearing impairment can be positively influenced by appropriate exercise." 
</P>
<P>
But those seniors who have tried intensive exercise seem to have caught the 
bug. Two years at the first Senior Olympics, about 3,000 people showed up from 
38 states to compete in swimming, archery, volleyball and other events. A 
spokesman for the Senior Olympics expects 4,000 to show up this year. 
</P>
<P>
Who better to proclaim the exercise gospel than an elderly person himself, 
78-year-old Dr. John H. Williams of Valdese, N.C., a former health educator who 
continues to practice what he preaches. 
</P>
<P>
Five days a week he drives 50 miles round-trip just to swim at the YMCA in 
Conover -- about 600 yards daily at present -- in preparation for the swimming 
events at the coming Senior Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"Swimming is ideal exercise for seniors," Williams said by phone. "There is no 
pressure on the bones, joints and tendons. An older person can harm those 
things, especially by pounding them on the pavement while running or jogging. 
</P>
<P>
"But the buoyancy of water means you can get an aerobic workout without putting 
any stress on the joints." 
</P>
<P>
Another oldster who believes in the value of swimming is 66-year-old Doris 
Peters of Imperial, Mo., also a participant in the inaugural Senior Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
"There is something about the water that is very relaxing," she said by phone. 
"If you run, you may finish exhausted. But if you swim, you finish refreshed. I 
feel like I'm a 66-year-old in the body of an 18-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a retired public health professor at Appalachian State University in 
North Carolina, member of the President's Conference on Physical Fitness and 
Aging, and author of numerous articles on the subject, also had these thoughts: 
</P>
<P>
"The body at any age is biologically meant to move; otherwise it will atrophy. 
I recall breaking my leg skiing in Germany in the 1940s. When the leg came out 
of the cast after eight weeks, it was thin as a pencil. Similarly, in the later 
years of one's life, if the body isn't used, it begins to say: 'OK, I'll just 
shrink.' " 
</P>
<P>
The retired professor pointed out the advantages that today's seniors have over 
those of decades past: "In former days, there weren't nearly as many swimming 
pools, bowling alleys, bike paths, urban walking paths." 
</P>
<P>
Octa DeLamater doesn't need those sort of facilities for her daily exercise. 
Just give her a Nerf ball to pitch or kick or toss into a basket. 
</P>
<P>
DeLamater, by the way, is 105 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Not one to let wheelchair confinement interfere with working out, she shows up 
regularly three times a week in a room near hers at Hollenbeck Home, a 
life-care facility in Boyle Heights. 
</P>
<P>
She has a hearing problem, but activity director Betts Hall described the 
remarkable centenarian: 
</P>
<P>
"She is a physical marvel. Up until she was 101, she would lie on her back on 
the floor, and kick both her feet up over her shoulders and her head. 
</P>
<P>
"Octa would also sit in a chair in her room with weights on her ankles, and 
lift her legs. Until a couple of years ago she would walk unassisted through 
the home every day -- and keep records to see how many miles she was piling 
up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Still Exercising 
</P>
<P>
At 105, this native Kansan can only walk with assistance now, and navigates in 
a wheelchair. But this doesn't hinder her in any way from showing up thrice 
weekly for a half-hour exercise class. 
</P>
<P>
"About 15 residents participate, and they sit in wheelchairs in a circle," the 
activity director said. "Part of the time is spent tossing a ball either to a 
neighbor, or to whoever is in the center conducting the class. 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually a portable basketball hoop is brought out, and they take turns 
trying to score baskets. Also, they play a form of soccer. They sit and kick a 
ball to one another. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes the others protest because Octa will stretch a leg out and try to 
get in a kick before the ball reaches the person next to her. She is still a 
competitor." 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone, however, gets to the same destination via the same route. 
</P>
<P>
Chauncey Depew, a U.S. senator from New York at the turn of the century who 
lived to be 94, once said: "I get my exercise acting as a pallbearer to my 
friends who exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Fred Kuraner, age 80, of Sherman Oaks, seems to have the same outlook. "I've 
never done any special exercising in my life," he said. "It has gotten me this 
far, so I figure it'll get me to the end, whenever that is." 
</P>
<P>
Kuraner allowed as how he does sometimes bicycle to the bank or post office, 
but added that he does so because he doesn't like to drive anymore. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm basically a lazy person," Kuraner said. "My wife wants me to walk more, 
and sometimes I do. But I never make it a habit to do so. I do nothing 
regimented. 
</P>
<P>
"I eat whatever I like. I have never done a diet. I eat eggs every day -- I 
think they are the most complete nourishment there is. I am healthy, and I 
don't see doctors much at all." 
</P>
<P>
You might say that Kuraner marches to a different drummer -- one with a slower 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bob Wiswell, an associate professor of exercise science at USC, touts the 
idea of seniors devoting part of their leisure time to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For cardiovascular endurance. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For maintenance of muscular strength. 
</P>
<P>
 -- For mobility/flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To keep body fat down. 
</P>
<P>
The important thing for the older folks is that they don't have to reach 
exhaustion to benefit from exercise, Wiswell explained. "The younger get 70% to 
85% of maximum heartbeat output, the older can get the same benefit from 35% to 
45%." 
</P>
<P>
Wiswell mentioned Harry Truman's favorite exercise, walking, as something most 
seniors can do. "Walking a mile will burn off 100 calories. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Options 
</P>
<P>
"Such people might also consider lawn mowing, riding either a stationary or 
moving bike, swimming, deck shuffleboard, lawn bowling, badminton, folk dancing 
-- something other than just sitting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those looking for statistical evidence should consider the remarks of Dr. 
Everett L. Smith, director of the biogerontology lab at the University of 
Wisconsin: 
</P>
<P>
"Currently, the average individual loses functional capacity at the rate of 
0.75% to 1% a year after the age of 30. . . . In my opinion, about 50% of the 
average aging decline is self-induced by life style, and the other 50% is due 
to the genes or the makeup of the individual biological system." 
</P>
<P>
Although not all experts agree that an exercise program should include running, 
a recent study by the Stanford University School of Medicine seems to dispel 
the notion that the older shouldn't run, because of damage they might cause to 
their knees or hips. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford studied 41 long-distance runners between the ages of 50 and 72, and a 
comparable group of non-runners. The runners, both male and female, had 40% 
more bone material than the non-runners, but showed no significant differences 
in the onset of joint disease or osteoarthritis. 
</P>
<P>
Walking, according to gerontologists, is by far the most popular exercise 
activity for people 65 and older. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica Place, as have some other Southland shopping malls, has begun a 
program to encourage it. Theirs is called Sea Strutters. 
</P>
<P>
"The program is offered from 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. Monday, Wednesday, 
Friday," explained Liz Von der Heide of the marketing department. "Walking the 
full length of each of our three levels equals one mile." 
</P>
<P>
Jean and Donald Cotner of San Juan Capistrano do their daily walking at Dana 
Point Harbor. By now they are used to the wisecracks: "Is somebody chasing 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old wife and the 66-year-old husband are both rapid walking buffs. 
So good have they become in their few months at it that they have won prizes in 
three competitions, and will strive in the coming national Senior Olympics -- 
in the 5-K race walking event. 
</P>
<P>
"It sort of started by accident," Donald Cotner said. "I had taken up running 
at age 63, and was competing in events for seniors. Two years ago we went to 
Melbourne (Australia) where I was entered for an event. 
</P>
<P>
"I came down with the flu. Had gone all that way, and didn't even get to 
participate in the parade. I was so disappointed I decided the heck with run 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Going Faster 
</P>
<P>
When the Cotners returned home, they did a little recreational walking at Dana 
Point, and in due time they noticed something: They seemed to be walking faster 
than most of the other pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
Which led to race walking. "It's great for the cardiovascular system," Jean 
Cotner said. "Gets your pulse up, and keeps your body moving. 
</P>
<P>
"I still like swimming and bicycling, but walking can be done anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, as she has for 21 years, Jean Cotner teaches yoga classes. "Some 
of my students are seniors. It's a safe way to keep the body flexible and in 
tune." 
</P>
<P>
As for the couple's fast walking, they do about four miles together daily, four 
days a week. 
</P>

<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Gary Parker -- Mercury News; Kim Lenox, a senior art major at

This semester, she had to take classes in swimming and yoga just to have the

<LEADPARA>  Budget cuts have made competition for classes so stiff this semester that more
than 3,000 students on six California State University campuses started the
term with no courses at all on their schedules, according to a survey by the
Assembly Committee on Higher Education.;   Instead, students sat in on already
overcrowded classes, or waited in long lines to get courses. Many just settled
for whatever was available, even though it wouldn't count toward their degrees.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  CSU CUTS WREAK MAJOR HAVOC
SCARCITY OF CLASSES THROWS GRADUATION PLANS OFF
COURSE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Q &amp; A: Chancellor Barry Munitz on budget cuts and the search for a new SJS
president. Page 4A  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     "It's pretty dismal," said Ann Blackwood, a consultant for the committee.; 
 Despite raising fees by 20 percent, CSU trustees were forced to cut $170
million out of this year's $1.6 billion budget. More than 5,000 classes were
canceled and about 3,000 faculty members lost their jobs. At San Jose State
University, more than 500 classes were canceled when 300 instructors were laid
off.;   One fallout is that students are taking even longer to graduate --
costing both students and the state more money in the long run. Even before
the budget crunch, CSU students could count on taking 5 1/2 years to earn a
degree. Now, an increasing number are looking at six years or more to
graduation.;   Kim Lenox, a senior art major at San Jose State, is already in
her sixth year. This semester, she found course offerings so scarce that she's
taking two classes in swimming and one in yoga just to have the 12 units
necessary to remain a full-time student -- and keep her scholarship.;   None
of the three counts toward her art degree. In fact, only one class on her
schedule -- advanced computer projects -- counts, and she's dropped plans for
a minor in deaf education because she couldn't get into the one class she
needed in that field.;   'Not so much by choice'; The scarcity of classes is
why the 23-year-old Lenox has hung around campus so long, "not so much by
choice. But over the years, if I couldn't get a course I needed to graduate, I
would take another course to make up my 12 units.";   Like three out of four
CSU students, Lenox has worked her way through school, clerking in clothing
stores, working in photo labs, assisting a commercial photographer and helping
run galleries on campus. The difficulties of matching class and work schedules
have added semesters to the majority of CSU students' academic careers.;   But
while work has been a problem for most students, 62 percent also said their
graduation was delayed by problems in getting courses in their major. More
than half said they had to wait to get the general education courses they
needed.;   The situation has deteriorated dramatically this year, said Jeffrey
Chang, legislative director for the California State Student Association.;  
Lines at 3 a.m.; "The first week here at Sacramento State, people were lining
up at 3 and 4 in the morning trying to get communications classes," Chang
said. "By the time the sun rose, the line was clear around the building and
over to the library.";   Barbara Pearce, 19, was the ninth person in line
outside the Sacramento communications building. A self-described "third-year
sophomore," she hadn't received any courses through computerized
registration.;   When Pearce finally got into the right office, "they had a
list of about 20 classes there were spaces available in," she said. "I picked
four out of that . . . then I sat in on classes.";   Today she has the five
classes she needs to remain a full-time student and eligible for her parents'
health insurance, but only one counts toward her major in organizational
communications, a business-oriented field.;   'Five with summer school'; "I
was hoping to graduate in 4 1/2 years. Now I'm looking more toward five with
summer school," Pearce said.;   "It is possible to graduate in four years, but
most people who do go to a private school. At any state school, I don't think
it's possible anymore, especially with the budget cuts.";   And everyone pays
when students postpone graduation. The Postsecondary Education Commission
calculates that it costs the state $7,500 for every year it takes a student to
graduate. The longer a student spends in school, the bigger the total bill.;  
"The key thing here is it's the equivalent of a double tuition increase," said
Blackwood, the assembly consultant. "It costs the state more money and it
costs the student more money."  </TEXT>

2). I only hope you and others could see through his stories. I would like you
to see video footage of the animals at Ringling Brothers Barnum &amp; Bailey being
hit quite brutally with a bull hook. There's a picture of Gebel-Williams
standing on an elephant. I hate to think what it took to "break" the spirit of
that elephant so it will take the domination of Gebel-Williams.;    As
Gebel-Williams said, "They are still wild animals." If they are wild animals
and he doesn't dominate but loves them, why are the elephants chained by their
legs and the other "wild" animals in cages most of the time?  </LEADPARA>

not detail solutions that can prevent sexual misconduct or other abuses of
power. As the problem is universal, the question of how to respond effectively
to confront such behavior is paramount.;    Research indicates that such
abuses of power can be restrained through education about the problem, through
upholding appropriate standards of ethical behavior and by providing a safe
process for reporting abuse and misconduct. The Iyengar Yoga Institute of San
Francisco has instituted these and other measures to protect its students.;

<TEXT>     WEIGHT: 130;   PERSONAL: Married 23 years; she has a 21-year-old daughter
and an 18-year-old son; and lives in Menlo Park;   OCCUPATION: Community and
school relations coordinator, Foothill College in Los Altos Hills;   FITNESS
BACKGROUND: While growing up, summer camp, family vacations and recreation
centered around "fun" competition, Davis says, and she loved participating. "I
tried and took lessons at everything," she says. "I ended up a jock of all
sports and master of none.";   During college, stress from studies and a
fast-food diet took their toll. "I didn't turn into a butterball, but I didn't
look the same." She played tennis and jumped on a trampoline, but did nothing
to promote strength or stamina.;   Two kids and 10 years later, when aerobics
and exercise studios were becoming the trend, it occurred to her that she
should be in better shape. Davis took to aerobics right away and has taken
classes for 12 years. For variety, she alternated aerobics with running, lap
swimming and yoga, modern jazz and ballet for the past 10 years.;   REGIMEN:
Davis' favorite fitness fun has always been aerobics, she says, because of the
level of energy expended during the movements to music. During her lunch hour,
she takes aerobic step and stretch classes three times a week. And on
weekends, she adds a "cardio funk" aerobics class offered at the YMCA in Palo
Alto. She takes longs walks and plays an occasional tennis game.;   RESULTS:
"Some people are surprised to learn I have a 21-year-old," she says. At least
20 years older than the other students in her aerobics classes, she says she
keeps up and "I am really proud of that.";   GOALS: "I would like to have more
muscle definition and shave a couple of inches off my thighs, but as I get
older I'm learning to be less critical of my body -- which is a lot easier to
do when you feel so good.";   OBSTACLES: Planning and packing shoes, workout
clothes and a towel in the mornings before work gives time for pause, she
says. "I just remind myself how good it feels afterward, then throw my bag in
the car anyway.";   TIPS AND COMMENTS: "Good health is the thing I value most
and it's not something I take for granted. We're only given one body and I'm
paying attention to this one."  </TEXT>

<P>
TEMPLES: BUDDHISTS ARE VISITING HIGHLAND PARK SANCTUARIES TO COMMEMORATE THE 
PURIFICATION OF BUDDHA.

<P>
Except for the colorful paper lanterns and large statue of the mother of Buddha 
in its front yard, the narrow house on North Figueroa Street in Highland Park 
hardly merits a second look. 
</P>
<P>
Such details might merely indicate Asian occupants. But the wooden bungalow in 
the 6800 block of Figueroa houses a Buddhist shrine. 
</P>
<P>
It is headquarters for the Pureland Lotus Community, an organization of 
Vietnamese Buddhists. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the only Buddhist sanctuary inconspicuously nestled among 
Western-style houses, apartments and small businesses in northeast Los Angeles. 
Down the street about two miles, at Figueroa and Avenue 52, is the Mystic 
Dharma temple. A few blocks west in the 900 block of Terrace 49, on Mt. 
Washington, is the Kanzeonji Zen house of prayer. 
</P>
<P>
The three temples represent divergent strains of Buddhism from Vietnam, China 
and Japan. This week the faithful of all three are visiting their shrines to 
commemorate one of Buddhism's most important events, the purification of 
Buddha. 
</P>
<P>
Although the rituals at each shrine may vary, worshipers usually come bearing 
offerings of flowers, fruits and pastry to put on an altar lightly clouded by 
the smoke of incense and candles. As the members gather, a priest leads the 
chant of prayers retelling the life of Buddha on earth. 
</P>
<P>
He was born Siddartha Gautama in India to a wealthy family. His deification in 
566 B.C., marking his attainment of enlightenment through meditation and 
rejection of materialism, is the event being celebrated this week. The Buddha's 
teachings first spread north through Asia over the next thousand years and came 
to the United States in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Handbook of Denominations, the first Buddhist temple in the 
United States was consecrated in San Francisco a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985 the Buddhist Churches of America said there were 250,000 followers of 
Buddha in America practicing in 62 temples, the largest of which is in Hacienda 
Heights. 
</P>
<P>
Last winter the Buddhist spiritual leaders gathered in Hacienda Heights' temple 
complex for the 16th conference of the World Fellowship of Buddhists. It was 
the first time that the biennial conference was held outside Asia. 
</P>
<P>
In America some temples are formed by immigrants as a part of their ethnic 
expression and others are established to spread the teachings of Buddha to new 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
The Rev. Ryugen Watanabe of the Kanzeonji Zen shrine is one of the Buddhist 
spiritual leaders who has reached beyond Asian followers. 
</P>
<P>
At the Kanzeonji Zen shrine, 34-year-old Watanabe and his followers sat all day 
Saturday in meditation before an altar that was donated by Japanese 
businessmen. Watanabe, who was born in Japan, said that 90% of his members are 
Caucasians. He has all of the shrine's literature printed in English to 
encourage membership from all backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
The Pureland Lotus and the Mystic Dharma, on the other hand, are oriented 
toward immigrants who speak Vietnamese and Mandarin Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
Thich Duy Tin, an apprentice priest, said most of the members of the Pureland 
Lotus shrine are Vietnamese from Monterey Park, which has a population that is 
slightly more than 50% Asian. 
</P>
<P>
Lily Lee, a worshiper, said the Mystic Dharma temple caters to Los Angeles 
worshipers originally from mainland China. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said the priest who usually presides over the monthly services was in Hong 
Kong to oversee the construction of two gigantic statues for the temple, which 
is on property the Buddhist congregation bought from a Christian church about 
nine years ago. Because he could not return in time for the purification 
services, worshipers conducted their services with a tape-recording of the 
ritual chants, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Lee said that up to a hundred worshipers would attend the big services 
conducted in the main sanctuary. Otherwise, about 10 members come to the 
monthly services in the basement of the fenced two-story building. 
</P>
<P>
It is largely coincidence that Highland Park has become home to three Buddhist 
shrines. The Pureland Lotus and Mystic Dharma, whose congregations are widely 
dispersed, merely found the right buildings at the right price. 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe, who ties his waist-length hair in a ponytail, said that it was no 
coincidence that he established his shrine in northeast Los Angeles. He said 
divine guidance informed him that Mt. Washington was one of the holiest 
mountains in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I didn't like Los Angeles at all," he said. His first home here 
was a car, but then a friend asked him to watch the house on Mt. Washington. 
The friend never came back. Eventually, Watanabe bought it and started his 
teachings in 1983. It was also through unforeseen circumstances that Watanabe 
and his followers bought the house across the street from the shrine for a yoga 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
"Too many people were attending my yoga class, and it was crowded here," he 
said. "I had been praying to Buddha to tell me what to do. Then one day, a real 
estate man knocked on the door and asked if I knew of anyone who wanted to rent 
the house across the street." 
</P>
<P>
Watanabe said he and his disciples make incense, body oils, meditation cushions 
and greeting cards to support the temple. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned through meditation that I have been doing this for many lives," 
Watanabe said. "I want to help the world. It hurts me so much to see what is 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
He said he came to America in the 1960s after a friend told him of a prediction 
saying that world peace will be attained when a tribe of American Indians 
receive Buddha's teachings from two holy men from the East. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought that might be me," he said.

<HEAD>Opera Lover Who Won Record Shopping Spree Planned It Like a
Military Maneuver</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Given two minutes to gather all the compact discs
she could, Lisa Lyles knew preparation _ physical, mental and
emotional _ would be key.
   So the opera-lover, who won the shopping spree through a bank
promotion, trained for the task. She swam laps for endurance,
practiced yoga for control, figured out how to make her hands
sticky, drew maps of the terrain and developed memory-nudging
devices.
   ``I knew this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I had to go
for it and meet the challenge,'' Lyles said Saturday.
   In the end, she raced through the Tower Records building Friday
scooping up 60 compact discs, chiefly classical ones, and ran up a
bill of $2,054 during her two-minute allotment _ five times what
the promotors figured each contestant would rake in.
   The 34-year-old Melrose resident was one of three people whose
names were drawn a week ago for a two-minute shopping dash.
   The folks at BayBank had estimated shelling out about $400 per
contestant to promote a new branch. Little did they realize that
lavish boxed sets of some classical music collections go for $250
per.
   ``I didn't do it intentionally, but I was told outright there
were no restrictions,'' Lyles said. ``I knew I could not afford to
purchase 180 boxed sets so I said to myself: `I'm going to hit
these.'''
   Lyles, a fund-raiser for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, spotted
which aisles had the best things, estimated the trips she would
need and made up sing-song ditties to jog her memory about what she
wanted.
   She also discovered that a tacky cloth she and her husband used
to strip furniture gave her sticky fingers. When her time came at
Tower Records, she was ready.
   ``When I see something, well, don't stand in my way!'' Lyles
said. ``Yoga helps you get a hold of yourself, but in the end its
that animal drive and knowing what you want.''
   ``This is her normal way of doing things, only very condensed,''
said her husband, James.
   Jaymes Leavitt, a Northeastern University freshman from Paxton,
eclipsed Lyles' haul by gathering up 86 compact discs, but his
taste was less expensive at a grand total of $1,300 worth of
merchandise.
   Another Northeastern freshman, Edward Monette of West Hampton
Beach, N.Y., was the third entrant, staggering out the door with 59
compact discs worth $900 and weighing about 30 pounds.
   Over the past week, Leavitt and Monette were looking over the
store's second floor layout of $15 hard rock CDs while Lyles was on
the third floor, checking out $250 boxed sets of Bach's organ works
and Wagner's Ring Cycle.

<LEADPARA>  YOGA IS THE MOST POWERFUL force in the universe, according to the most
prominent yoga teacher in the world, B.K.S. Iyengar of Pune, India.;    On the
purely physical plane, its devotees say, yoga can enhance personal energy,
reduce stress and ease such problems as lower back pain. A deeper yoga
practice can be profound therapy, as serious an investigation of one's life as
Freudian or Jungian analysis.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Here's how the therapeutic process might unfold. A prospective student,
watching a yoga program on Channel 9, decides to get out of the chair and
learn a few yoga poses, known as "asanas." There are about 200 asanas in hatha
yoga. The point of doing them is to relax and balance the body.;    They range
in difficulty from the apparently simple triangle pose, which involves
spreading the feet and twisting the trunk; to the more intricate headstand; to
postures that take years even to attempt, where the arms point north, the
torso twists south and the legs fly off toward Bombay.;    After a few weeks
of watching classes, the student heeds the advice of the TV teacher and
attends a local class or takes a private lesson. A live teacher is vital to
yoga.;    Teachers are trained to help each individual body adapt to the
rigors of a pose. Often, a feeling of trust develops between teacher and
student; this contributes significantly to the learning process.;    The first
months of yoga can be a wonderful time; after years of stiffness, students
begin to feel what it is to have a relaxed, balanced, flexible body. It's
exciting. It's also scary, because the psychic armor of a lifetime is being
softened. The personal guidance of a teacher can help focus the excitement and
allay the fear.;    Progress usually slows after the first few months. The
process of softening and unfolding becomes more subtle and gradual. Some
students get discouraged and quit; many others level off their practice and
are content with feeling better. But some students stick with the discipline,
and for them, the teacher becomes indispensable -- keeping their spirits up
over the difficult years of daily practice, teaching the seemingly infinite
subtleties of relaxing and opening, demonstrating a belief that one's true
self, one's core self, is OK. Demonstrating, in short, the value of trust.;   
SOMETIMES THINGS GO wrong. Occasionally, the relationship between teacher and
student is betrayed.;    A leading teacher at the Bay Area's foremost yoga
school has admitted publicly that he engaged in sexual misconduct with female
students. Among several allegations against the teacher, Manouso Manos, 39,
are charges that he fondled female students during classes. Manos said at a
yoga convention last June that he had "disgraced" himself.;    The case has
been kept under wraps by the yoga community; this article is the first
disclosure of it to the general public. Some yoga teachers and students are
outraged not only by the sexual misconduct, but also by the subsequent
unwillingness of the yoga world to disclose the case to the general public.
They question the decision made last October by the school, the Iyengar Yoga
Institute of San Francisco, to allow Manos back to teach classes open to
members of the public who have no knowledge of his alleged misbehavior.;    "I
was sexually abused by my father as a small child," says Stephanie Lawrence,
46, an artist and yoga student living in Mill Valley. "I came to the San
Francisco Iyengar institute six years ago to heal those wounds. Fortunately, I
did not study with Manouso when I first came to the institute; had I been
molested in a yoga class, it could have easily re-enacted the molestation I
suffered as a child, and the result could have been psychically disastrous."; 
  Some observers believe this case also points up fundamental flaws in the
Iyengar style of teaching yoga. That style, following the ideas of B.K.S.
Iyengar, is the leading instructional method for yoga in the United States
today, with about 500 teachers. There are some 100 Iyengar schools around the
country.;    The allegations against Manos are also a reminder that a series
of sex scandals has plagued the spiritual/New Age community in the United
States in recent years. They raise again the question of what constitutes
appropriate behavior between men in positions of power or influence, such as
teachers, therapists and gurus, and women who are their students, patients and
followers.;    SINCE OCTOBER, AT LEAST five teachers at the Iyengar Yoga
Institute of San Francisco have resigned to protest the school's handling of
the Manos case.;    The school, located on 27th Avenue in the city's Sunset
District, is the Harvard University of yoga, home base for many of America's
leading instructors and a mecca for students from around the world. The
school's showpiece is its respected teacher-training program. The non-profit
institute is licensed by the state of California as a vocational school.;   
Manos has for years taught well-attended classes at the school, and conducted
workshops around the country.;    Allegations of sexual improprieties caused
the institute to suspend him as a teacher in October 1989. Sources say that
"many" allegations against Manos have been reported in letters and phone calls
to the institute in the last two years. The charges have been reviewed by at
least a dozen people at the institute. The misconduct is said to have occurred
both at the institute and in yoga workshops Manos has given around the
country. No police charges or lawsuits have been filed against Manos.;   
According to three separate sources familiar with the case, all of whom
insisted on anonymity, Manos allegedly rubbed his pelvis against women
students in a sexually provocative way as the women were doing yoga poses,
touched them in private places during classes under the guise of pose
adjustments, and asked certain women students individually into an institute
classroom after group classes, where, behind closed doors, he performed
sexually charged physical manipulations, and had intercourse.;    When he was
informed that the specific allegations made against him would be cited in this
article, Manos declined comment other than this written statement: "Though
there are inaccuracies in the statements made in this article I do recognize
the gravity of the subject matter. I urge anyone who is involved in a
relationship that may be inappropriate (incest, employer-employee,
minister/rabbi-parishioner, therapist-patient, teacher-student) to seek
outside help and guidance.";    The director of the institute, Mary Peirce,
did not respond to repeated requests for comments.;    Accusations of sexual
contact between Manos and students first surfaced in 1987. Confronted with
them, Manos promised an institute representative he would not repeat the
offense. In the late summer and fall of 1989, instances of sexual contact were
again reported, and he was suspended as a teacher that October.;    In the
course of meetings and interviews about the case, Manos apparently never
declared that he was innocent of charges of sexual misconduct. The master and
mentor of the San Francisco Iyengar school, B.K.S. Iyengar, reviewed the
allegations last year and discussed them with Manos. Iyengar, who had the
authority to lift Manos' teacher certification or impose other restrictions,
decided action was not warranted and asked the yoga community to forgive
Manos. The school's board voted to reinstate him in October 1990.;    One of
the leading yoga teachers in the United States, Judith Lasater, then resigned
from the institute's board of directors because, she says, "I did not want to
be associated professionally with such behavior." At least four other teachers
-- Jennie Arndt, Toni Montez, Donald Moyer and Mary Lou Weprin -- resigned in
protest from the school's teacher training faculty.;    A STUDENT WHO MADE AN
allegation against Manos agreed to describe her experience on the condition
that she remain anonymous. The incident, she says, took place in 1986 in a
city where Manos had gone to give a workshop.;    "He had been very
flirtatious with women in the class -- touching women he didn't know well,
putting his arm around their waist and so on. This bothered me a little; it
set a strange tone for the class.;    "At the end of the class we all lay down
in Savasana." (This is the traditional last pose of Iyengar sessions. Students
lie on their backs, close their eyes, breathe in a measured way, and deeply
relax for about 10 minutes.) "He came by and put a block under my shoulders."
(A standard yoga procedure to elevate and open the chest.) "After about three
minutes he came by and put his hand inside my leotard and, basically, gave me
a breast massage.;    "It made me feel horrible. I didn't know what to do. It
scared me. I didn't know if I had done something to bring this on; all the
victim's guilt and shame, 'Am I responsible? Am I at fault?';    "These
thoughts went on for two minutes. I then said, 'That's enough.' He said, 'Oh,
sorry' and walked away. I didn't talk about it to him afterwards. I felt
ashamed and embarrassed -- mortified, actually.;    "I carried guilt around
for a long time, and the feeling that I should have stopped it immediately,
and maybe I had done something to cause it -- but I hadn't.;    "One of the
reasons it was so hard to accept was that it had been done in the context of
yoga. Yoga is a thing we turn to in order to begin opening our bodies; there
needs to be that element of trust there because it can be a very vulnerable
experience.;    "It went on for two minutes because I was in shock, basically.
It took me that long to realize what was happening and to realize it was wrong
-- I had crazy thoughts like, 'Oh, this is the way they do yoga in California,
where he's from, and if I react he'll think I'm uptight about my body.' He was
the teacher, after all; students really abdicate a lot of power to teachers.
I've had many thoughts since then about what I should have done -- instantly
get up and say, 'Get your hands off me, you pig!';    "I didn't report it
right away because I was ashamed and embarrassed, and felt guilty, thinking I
would be judged and not believed. It was easier to go on and forget about it.
And it wasn't as if I had been raped.;    "I felt like I was the only one it
had happened to; when I heard that it had happened to others I thought I could
come forward and be believed.";    MANOUSO MANOS, WHO lives in San Francisco,
is a native of the United States. He became prominent as a yoga teacher in
1984 after successfully organizing and managing the first national Iyengar
convention, in San Francisco. He is perceived as B.K.S. Iyengar's "right-hand
man" in America and as one of the master's "star teachers.";    As a forceful
advocate for Iyengar's yoga and organizational ideas, Manos came into serious
conflict with others in the Iyengar circle who were more inclined to a
flexible approach. The conflict also colored the institute's handling of the
allegations against Manos, according to one teacher. "When we spoke out
against the school's handling of the sexual misconduct matter, we were accused
by some people of waging a personal vendetta against Manouso," the teacher
says. "Our objections to his conduct were discounted on the grounds that we
had personal grudges.";    Iyengar, 72, is "widely regarded as the world's
leading exponent of hatha yoga," according to Yoga Journal. (There are several
branches of yoga; hatha yoga is the branch concerned with physical poses. In
addition, hatha yoga students learn meditation and various breathing
exercises.) Iyengar's Light on Yoga, published in the mid-1960s, is considered
a modern classic in the field. Iyengar's regal demeanor, vigorous air and
fervent teaching style have earned him the nickname "Lion of Pune" (pronounced
poo-nah). After becoming known in India as a yoga master, he attracted
attention in the West in the mid-1950s as yoga tutor of violinist Yehudi
Menuhin, who grew up in San Francisco. (Menuhin's mother, Marutha, lives in
Los Gatos.) A grateful Menuhin gave Iyengar a wristwatch inscribed "To my best
violin teacher B.K.S. Iyengar. Yehudi Menuhin, Gstaad, Sept. 1954.";   
Reached by phone in India and asked if he believed the allegations against
Manos by the woman quoted above, Iyengar replied, "No. That is an old, old
story. I doubt its truth. I do not believe past things when they are kept
quiet for so long.";    Asked if he thought perhaps the woman had been too
embarrassed or ashamed to report the incident, he said, "I do not believe
that.";    Did he question Manos about whether the woman's charge was true?
"He did not say," Iyengar replied. "Why should I ask him? I don't want to
listen to hearsay. When a report is fresh, immediate, then it is more likely
to be true. When reported later it is all dexterous words.";    The fact that
no charges or lawsuits have been filed against Manos has helped keep the case
contained within the yoga community. But there are other reasons for the
community's silence on the matter. Yoga teachers don't know how Iyengar will
react to presentation of the case to a broader public. Teachers do not take
lightly the prospect of displeasing Iyengar. The Iyengar institute may also be
concerned about losing students, especially because it has experienced
financial problems in the past year.;    Iyengar said he does not believe some
of the the charges against Manos, but insisted that Manos has become a
"changed man" who will not repeat his previous actions. Manos is "not the same
person" today as a year or two ago; he is "transformed," Iyengar said.;   
Asked how he was able to judge this, Iyengar replied, "I trust him. I trust
his words. I have taken an oath from him. He told me he had lost so many
others but he did not want to lose me. I told him that I can forgive once but
not twice.";    But is he not in fact forgiving Manos twice, because of
allegations that were reported in 1987, followed by the surfacing of
allegations in '89?;    "No," Iyengar said. "I never knew about 1987. Nobody
told me in 1987. I was only informed later.";    Iyengar said he views the
Manos case as an opportunity to "teach one and all" the importance of high
ethical conduct in yoga: "This is a stepping stone for others to follow. I see
it from this angle, as a learning experience." Ethical conduct, he continued,
is a paramount concern of his.;    When he was asked if, as some sources
claim, he believes Manos was seduced by some of the women, Iyengar said, "Yes,
naturally. Unless a woman shows willingness, the man will not act.";    Does
even strong temptation excuse such behavior on the part of a yoga teacher?;   
"Man is weak; forgiveness is what is important. Did not Christ forgive many
people?";    When she was told of Iyengar's doubts about her veracity, the
student whose allegations are quoted above said, "Well . . . I'm sitting here
trying not to scream or cry. It makes me want to forget about ever doing
Iyengar yoga again.";    "I BEAR MANOUSO NO ILL WILL," SAYS LINDA COGOZZO,
managing editor of Yoga Journal magazine and an 11-year student of Iyengar
yoga. "But thus far there has been no attention paid by the yoga community to
what I believe are the key issues in this situation: the misuse of power and
the betrayal of a student's trust by a teacher.;    "The emphasis in the
community, from Iyengar on down, has been on forgiving Manouso. No one has
talked at all about the women involved. And this makes me wonder what
representation and value I, as a woman, have in the Iyengar community. I'm
thinking not much.";    Others in the yoga community feel the case has been
dealt with properly. Lolly Font, owner/director of the California Yoga Center
in Palo Alto, says the situation "has been a very good thing for Manouso. I
think he's learned an awful lot from having to come clear and admit to what
he's done." Font said she takes classes regularly from Manos and considers his
teaching on par with the best she has experienced.;    Betty Eiler, owner of
Yoga Fitness in San Jose, considers the Manos case "water over the dam." She
adds, "Nobody, really, has a completely clean slate in their lives. Manouso
has suffered greatly over this; he's paid his dues.";    But many agree with
the teacher who says, "I'm disgusted and disillusioned. This event is like a
festering wound that has never been cleaned out. It's still dividing the yoga
community in the Bay Area, and since this area is the center of yoga for the
United States, it's dividing the community nationally, and in fact
internationally.";    Although many teachers say Iyengar should not be blamed
for Manos' alleged misconduct, others, probably a minority, believe he must
share in the responsibility. An experienced teacher said, "Mr. Iyengar can be
physically abusive when teaching. He sometimes slaps students, or hits them in
the head or kicks them, as a way of 'creating awareness,' of saying, 'Hey,
wake up!' And he can be verbally abusive, calling people 'stupid.' Not all
people, and not all the time. I have come to view Iyengar's physical abuse as
related to Manos' sexual abuse. If Iyengar doesn't respect people's physical
integrity, if he crosses physical boundaries, it creates a climate where
sexual abuse can occur.";    Larry Hatlett, co-director of the Yoga Center of
Palo Alto, disagrees. He does not see how Iyengar's style could have led to
Manos' alleged misbehavior. "I think it's Manouso, period," Hatlett says.;   
For his part, Iyengar denies that he is aggressive. "I do not think that word
is accurate. I am intense. I am intense because it is important, the work that
we do. Why waste time?";    THE WORD "GURU" HAS ROOTS IN HINDUISM. In the
strictest sense of the word, a guru is someone "enlightened," profoundly
spiritual and close to God; today, the word is often used by various
disciplines to describe any revered teacher/leader/guide.;    The very first
Indian guru to get widespread attention in the Western mainstream press, the
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, got caught up in charges of taking advantage of the
guru-devotee relationship.;    Several Beatles biographies say the group got
fed up with the Maharishi in 1968 because they felt he was conducting an
illicit romance with one of his female disciples. The Maharishi has apparently
never commented on the matter. The Beatles did make a comment -- their bitter
song "Sexy Sadie" was originally titled "Maharishi.";    Sexual misbehavior is
an extremely delicate topic in the U.S. spiritual/New Age community -- in part
because it seems to occur so often, especially among American devotees of
Eastern religions. In the November/December 1990 issue of Yoga Journal,
Katharine Webster writes, "Sexual contact between gurus and their American
disciples is not a new or rare phenomenon. Over the past 15 or 20 years,
numerous spiritual teachers have admitted to, or been charged with, having
sexually exploitative relationships with their female students.";    In the
1980s, the Zen Center of San Francisco was hit hard by a sex scandal involving
its leader, Richard Baker. The center has rectified its problems. Also in the
'80s, revelations about the sexual conduct of Swami Muktananda and Eknath
Easwaran, among others, generated controversy.;    One of the latest cases
involves Swami Rama, guru of the Himalayan Institute of Yoga Science and
Philosophy. The institute, a huge enterprise based in Pennsylvania, is a hub
for East Coast spiritual seekers, with a publishing company, scientific lab,
yoga teacher-training program and health clinic. Writing in Yoga Journal,
Katharine Webster describes allegations of numerous instances of sexual
misconduct by Swami Rama. The Himalayan Institute has not publicly responded
to the charges.;    Dr. Peter Rutter, a prominent San Francisco psychiatrist
and Jungian analyst, said, when interviewed for this article, that he knows
personally and "conservatively" of about 250 victims of sexual misbehavior in
U.S. and British communities that study and practice Eastern religions. These
250 include his patients, people who have attended his workshops and people
who have written to him.;    In his well-regarded book Sex in the Forbidden
Zone, Rutter discusses the issue of sex between men in positions of power or
influence and women who come to them seeking guidance.;    "The forbidden
zone," he writes, "is a condition of relationship in which sexual behavior is
prohibited because a man holds in trust the intimate, wounded, vulnerable or
undeveloped parts of a woman. The trust derives from the professional role of
the man as doctor, therapist, lawyer, clergy, teacher or mentor, and it
creates an expectation that whatever parts of herself the woman entrusts to
him (her property, body, mind or spirit) must be used solely to advance her
interests and will not be used to his advantage, sexual or otherwise.;   
"Under these conditions," Rutter continues, "sexual behavior is always wrong
no matter who initiates it, no matter how willing the participants say they
are. In the forbidden zone the factors of power, trust and dependency remove
the possibility of a woman freely giving consent to sexual contact. Put
another way, the dynamics of the forbidden zone can render a woman unable to
withhold consent, and because the man has the greater power, the
responsibility is his to guard the forbidden boundary against sexual contact
no matter how provocative the woman.";    The four major "talking" therapy
groups -- psychiatrists; psychologists; marriage, family and child counselors;
licensed clinical social workers -- all forbid relationships between therapist
and patient/client. And in January 1990, California enacted a law making it
illegal for a psychological therapist to have sex with a patient. Seven states
currently have such laws. Yoga teaching, while considered by many a therapy,
does not fall into the framework of the laws.;    As noted, no charges or
lawsuits have been filed in the Manos case. "It's difficult for women to come
out with these charges publicly," Rutter says. "It's a terrible ordeal,
requiring them to make public the most personal, intimate aspects of their
lives, which they would not have to undergo had there not been a violation of
the relationship in the first place.;    "There's tremendous risk for them. If
they speak out they're often punished within a community, or blamed. People in
the community might say initially that a charismatic man 'couldn't possibly
have done such a thing.' The next step in the denial process is 'Well, he may
have done it, but he was seduced.' ";    As Katharine Webster writes in Yoga
Journal, "The followers of 'enlightened' men are usually reluctant to find
fault with them, since to do so could invalidate the students' own years of
study and devotion. Instead they deny the experience of the 'unenlightened'
women who are the guru's victims.";    "Personally," Rutter says, "I am in
favor of women going public with such charges. I think they have more to gain
than lose if they do.";    Rutter adds that today, within some professions,
such as therapy, there is "universal" condemnation of sexual contact. In other
professions, such as teaching, there is only "a gradually growing awareness of
the problem." A number of universities have passed internal rules making
teacher-student sexual contact illegal. The model rule in the academic world,
Rutter says, is a University of Iowa edict that states in part, "Voluntary
consent by the student in such a relationship is suspect, given the
fundamentally asymmetrical nature of the relationship.";    WHY DO SEX
SCANDALS KEEP HAPPENING in the spiritual/New Age community?;    There is, of
course, sexual misbehavior in corporations, volunteer organizations,
mainstream religious groups, professional and collegiate athletics. And many
spiritual/New Age gurus and teachers conduct themselves impeccably, without a
breath of impropriety.;    But in this community -- especially among Western
followers of classical Eastern religions -- there are unique and potentially
volatile dynamics at work. These have to do with the exalted status of the
guru/spiritual teacher, and the spiritual hunger of many people in the West.; 
  Followers sometimes initiate, or welcome, sex with gurus and teachers
because they believe that sex under such circumstances is an especially
life-enhancing thing to do, a way to be permeated with the guru's enlightened
essence.;    "A woman might try to see it as a positive experience," Peter
Rutter says, "but in 99 percent of cases, that veil of illusion sooner or
later falls away and the woman realizes she has been terribly abused and
exploited. This might happen five minutes later or 20 years later.";    A
central reason the woman eventually feels exploited, Rutter believes, is that
the experience is a reinforcement of one of the most degrading things she's
heard (directly or indirectly) about herself: "Sex is all you're good for."
When such a message comes from a trusted guru or spiritual teacher in the form
of a sexual episode, Rutter says, it is especially painful and damaging -- "it
strikes at the heart of her psyche and soul.";    Ganga White, president of
the White Lotus Yoga Foundation in Santa Barbara, identifies "an amazing
spiritual gullibility among those of us in the West." Westerners may have a
hard time differentiating authentic spiritual leaders from those prone to
exploitation, he says, because we have a different way of judging things -- a
way of judgment based on materialism. "Maybe we see spirituality as an
accumulation of things -- accumulation of merit, knowledge, power -- rather
than what it really is: a subtle process of inner opening and understanding.; 
  "The question," he continues, "is not why so many spiritual leaders have
fallen; the question is, who says they had risen to a state of true
enlightenment in the first place? Somebody can be the head of a big
organization and write books and have a lot of centers, but they may not be
any more evolved than you or I. We're duped or mesmerized by a person's
possessions -- possessions of knowledge, charisma and so forth. These are not
necessarily indications of a higher awareness.";    There doesn't appear to be
any easy, sure-fire way to find authentic spiritual guides not prone to
sexual, financial or philosophical exploitation. Indicators of authenticity,
says White, are "love and compassion, and an absence of the 'Me' -- an absence
of ego and self-centeredness. What I suggest to people is, accept teachers who
start setting you free right from the beginning, not ones who ask you to sit
at their feet. There's a difference.";    Donald Moyer, one of the teachers
who resigned from the San Francisco Iyengar institute, says, "The question is,
how do we take a practice like yoga, from a culture, India, accustomed to
hierarchy and dealing with power in a different way, and bring it to the West,
and avoid lapsing into some sort of patriarchal throwback? Westerners, when
they first are attracted to Eastern thought, sometimes tend to put down all
Western attitudes. We need to be able to see the value of our own
contributions -- democratic values, psychological understandings, and
developing a sense of personal responsibility for our actions.";    "The
problem is not yoga," says yoga teacher Arthur Kilmurray. "Yoga is a process
of purification that stirs things up within a person. How those stirred-up
issues are dealt with is a function of such things as the culture, the times
we live in and how an individual is able to deal with the issues.";   
Stephanie Lawrence of Mill Valley says that she is doing yoga exclusively at
home these days. She quit going to classes because of what she terms a
"humbling attitude" exhibited by some male yoga teachers. "The cumulative
effect of many years of studying yoga led me to feel that I had handed some
integral part of myself over to some of the teachers, that I had allowed
myself to be humbled by them, and forgotten that I was my own best teacher.;  
 "I think that climate may be due to a kind of passivity among women that's
confused with surrendering, a word that is often used in yoga. When women
can't stand up for themselves, are passive in that particular way, then that
passivity is almost handing the power to the teacher to do what he wants with
them."; BOB FROST is a contributing writer for West.  </TEXT>

<HL> Medicine &amp; Health (A Special Report): Taking Charge

...But Some Firms Try to Help

   STRESSED-OUT employees can be bad for business. 
They're grouchy. 
They get sick a lot. 
They procrastinate and miss deadlines. 
Often they lack creativity. 

   When tension mounts at Doug Greene's magazine-publishing company in New Hope, Pa., he and his co-workers start juggling. 
Any three objects will do -- oranges, staplers, erasers. 
"To juggle and finally get that third ball going, you have got to relax," he says. 

   Like Mr. Greene, more managers now figure they can improve the bottom line by helping workers get rid of stress. 
The Association for Fitness in Business estimates that 12,000 companies offer programs ranging from counseling services, lunchtime stress-management seminars and "wellness" publications to elaborate company-run fitness centers where employees can sweat out the tension. 
Stress-management consultants are proliferating, and many companies hire them to teach coping skills like meditation, deep-breathing exercises or yoga. 
Massage therapists make the rounds at a few headquarters, giving at-the-desk relief to tense, aching necks, shoulders and backs. 

   "It's amazing the amount of stress some people are under," says John Thompson, Campbell Soup Co.'s manager of corporate health and fitness. 
"They might build up so much stress from a morning meeting they'll be useless in the afternoon unless they can release that." 

   Campbell's sleek new fitness center at headquarters in Camden, N.J., is a beehive at lunchtime. 
Walkers do laps on a track. 
Top executives and plant workers alike thump treadmills and whir stationary bicycles. 
An aerobics class claps to theme music from "Fame." 

   Joe Scott, a 59-year-old engineer at Campbell's electrical power plant, says he used to drink a case of beer a day. 
"I felt like if I didn't drink, I would end up in the nuthouse," he says. 
Now, instead of frequenting the taproom, he goes to the fitness center to pedal a stationary bike and lift weights. 
He is 85 pounds lighter and says the tension is gone. 
"Exercise has taken the place of drinking," he says. 

   Campbell employees who work out together often develop a camaraderie that reduces tension back in the office. 
"We have a common bond," says William A. Schmidt, vice president of engineering. 

   But not everyone takes stress seriously. 
In fact, Campbell says only 25%, or about 877, workers from its Camden offices and plant use its fitness center, despite its convenience and low cost of only $50 a year. 
And some companies are skeptical of whether such fitness and stress programs are worth the expense and effort. 
To be effective, the company culture has to be supportive. 

   In some cases, if managers have been "mean to employees and thrust a health program on them, nobody signs up or pays any attention," says Alexander Leaf, chairman of the department of preventive medicine at Harvard Medical School. 

   Seven years ago, Johnson &amp; Johnson set out to create a program that would work. 
Called Live for Life, the program is credited with reducing health costs and absenteeism. 
Now officials are trying to market the plan to other companies. 
For roughly $150 a year for each employee, Johnson &amp; Johnson offers periodic checks on blood pressure, weight, cholesterol levels and other health barometers, as well as an exercise regimen and eight health seminars. 
One is devoted specifically to managing stress. 

   "The evidence is clear that it works," asserts Frank H. Barker, president of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Health Management Inc. unit, which sells Live for Life. 

   He says the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School studied 2,000 employees over five years and found that absenteeism dropped to four days a year from five among employees taking part in the fitness and health program, while it rose slightly during the same period for people who didn't use the techniques. 
In addition, researchers found, job satisfaction and company loyalty rose while health costs dropped significantly. 

   Some dispute the Wharton study, citing the high number of variables that determine healthiness and attitudes. 
Regina E. Herzlinger, a professor at Harvard Business School, says that nonetheless, the "assumption" that such programs work is a pretty safe bet. 

   It didn't take a Wharton study to convince Bea Firgau that she needed help managing her stress. 
Between shopping, cooking and keeping house for her family and working as a secretary to three Johnson &amp; Johnson managers, stress took over her life. 

   After taking Live for Life's stress-management seminar, she started to walk 15 minutes to work every morning instead of driving and to use deep-breathing exercises when she feels tense. 
When she goes home at night, she lies on her bed and listens to a tape that instructs her to tense and relax her muscles. 
"Gradually, your body feels very soothed," she says. 

   Sally Fitzhugh, 33, balances her job mothering a six-month-old and a four-year-old with her job as a marketing staff manager for Southwestern Bell Corp. in St. Louis. 
Her company's course taught her to take her children's spilled oatmeal in stride and not to give up when management turns down a project idea. 

   Control Data Corp.'s course, "How to Relax," includes assertiveness training in how to get along with other workers, another common source of tension. 
Rather than taking offensive behavior from another employee personally, for instance, the course instructs employees to understand that the colleague might be unhappy or insecure. 

   At the very least, workers are encouraged to personalize their offices and surround themselves with relaxing images. 
Paul Terry, a stress consultant, keeps a picture of his favorite fishing spot on his office wall. 
"It's inherently relaxing," he says. 

   But as a rule, little is done to address a chief source of tension: the boss. 
Says T George Harris, editor-in-chief of American Health magazine: "Bosses are the people giving the ulcers."

<HL> Far-Out Guru Behind U.S. Best-Seller Arouses Fear and Violence in Calcutta </HL>

<TEXT>
   In his best-seller, "The Great Depression of 1990," Ravi Batra acknowledges his intellectual debt to the guru who inspires him -- P.R. Sarkar, a 67-year-old, bespectacled former railway cashier who began a yoga cult in 1955. 

   Mr. Batra, an economics professor at Southern Methodist University in the U.S., cites Mr. Sarkar 34 times in the book, which has made its author an overnight millionaire. 
He describes the guru only sketchily as a "leading scholar from India who has profoundly enriched the literature of many disciplines." 

   Mr. Batra doesn't mention the swami's teaching that the key to life is a form of yoga that uncoils the sexual energy trapped at the base of your spine. 
Nor the teaching that sex should be indulged in no more than four times a month. 
Nor the guru's statement that plants are people, too. 

   In Calcutta, Mr. Sarkar's cult is feared and despised. 
In 1982, 16 of its members were burned alive by angry Calcutta mobs. 
Mr. Sarkar served six years in prison for conspiring to kill six of his acolytes (the conviction was reversed on appeal). 

   Today, Mr. Sarkar claims 4,500 full-time acolytes. 
Mr. Batra has been a follower of Mr. Sarkar since 1964 and says it was his perusal of one of Mr. Sarkar's books that convinced him history moves in cycles. 
Much of "The Great Depression of 1990" is a statistical argument that a cataclysmic downturn in the world's economic cycle is due in 1990. 

   The guru's organization operates in 182 countries. 
He mostly runs preschool centers, where tykes are taught to sit crosslegged on the floor, squeeze their eyes shut and access the sexual energy at the base of their tiny spines. 

   The Calcutta police say Mr. Sarkar's other main subsidiary is a terrorist nationalist group called Amra Bengali that plants time bombs in government offices. (Mr. 
Sarkar refused a request for an interview; followers say he rarely entertains unenlightened non-meditators.) 

   To the devoted, Mr. Sarkar is a font of knowledge in many disciplines -- botany, linguistics, history, philosophy and pyschology included -- and a bundle of superhuman energy. 
He talks and sings 20 hours a day. 
Every week he writes one book; every day he composes several songs. (More precisely, his followers do the actual bookwriting and the transposing of the songs. 
Mr. Sarkar just talks and sings as he walks in his six botanical gardens, his zoos and his two houses, trailed by aides with notebooks and tape recorders.) 

   "Every word is a pearl," says Sister Susan, a blue-eyed American acolyte who refuses to be identified fully in fear of deportation. 
"When you transcribe his words, they're like poems." 

   Epic poems, Susan means. 
The cult's bookshop is stacked to the ceiling with Mr. Sarkar's pearls. 
The "nutshell" version of his economic theories runs 12 volumes. 

   Currently being transcribed: the tail-end of Mr. Sarkar's three-year discourse on philology, his exhaustive theories on agriculture and a series of children's stories. 
In perennial demand: his own molecular theory, which provokes hilariously confused discussions among the faithful, and an eye-opening dictionary full of novel etymologies. (The word "God," Mr. Sarkar instructs, is an acronymn for the words generator, operator and destructor. 
The litchi fruit was named for a Chinese horticulturist named Lee Chi.) 

   Mr. Sarkar's cult, called Ananda Marg, or "Path of Joy," may have its silly side. 
But it is taken very seriously here in Calcutta. 
It has 1,500 monks and nuns -- celibate vegetarians who wear orange robes -- and 3,000 married acolytes. 
Five hundred of the monks and nuns come from the West, bringing much of the cult's financial resources, police say. 
The cult's "world headquarters" is surrounded by high walls and barbed wire -- a symbol of the cult's relations with its neighbors. 

   The "margis," as they are known, bring homeless children to orphanages that are, in fact, training camps for the cult. 
The group says its methods are legal, but its neighbors are doubtful and accuse the clan of child-stealing. 

   Public anger reached its zenith April 30, 1982, when angry mobs stopped three taxis bearing margis, dragged them from their cars, bludgeoned and poured acid on them and finally burned them to death. 
The cult claims the incident was planned and carried out by the left-wing local government. 
The group's official literature claims the government, and behind it the Soviet Union, is alarmed at the cult's success. 

   Incidents involving the group have become so commonplace in Calcutta that a news story headlined "95 Ananda Margis Arrested" merited only two paragraphs in the local papers. 

   The cult denies that it operates the local terrorist group, although it admits the group has taken intellectual succor from Mr. Sarkar. 
"And no one blames the pope for an Irish terrorist," Sister Susan says. 

   Sister Susan shakes her head sadly when the awkward issue of the swami's wife, Uma Sarkar, rears its ugly head. 
Corrupted by an evil acolyte, Sister Susan says. 
Power crazy. 
There's no truth, Susan says, to the murder charges made against the swami in 1971 by Mrs. Sarkar, who is now separated from her husband. 

   Mr. Batra, the author, admits in an interview in New Delhi that he is now the most famous margi in the world and perhaps the richest. 
But he emphasizes that he doesn't work full-time as an acolyte. 
He says he doesn't contribute any of his book's proceeds to the group, and the margis' sour reaction to the topic suggests he's telling the truth. 

   But Mr. Batra's devotion to Mr. Sarkar remains strong. 
The author reads the swami's works "constantly" and meditates using his method. 
He recently made a pilgrimage to see Mr. Sarkar, "to see if I was interpreting his ideas correctly." 

   But even if he wanted to be a full-time margi, he probably couldn't squeeze it into his hectic book-promotion schedule. 
Since "The Great Depression of 1990" was published in June, Mr. Batra has given at least 500 interviews and 75 lectures. 
On a recent trip to Australia, he gave 19 interviews in one day. 
During one five-day stay in Japan, he appeared on 40 television shows. 
In the middle of one lecture in Japan, an earthquake occurred. 

   "They all shouted, 'It's an earthquake!'" says Mr. Batra. 
"I said, 'No, it's a depression!'"

   When producer Woody Fraser created ABC's
``Home'' show two years ago to help people live their lives he
didn't know it was going to get so personal.
   ``What the show is really about is to give people ideas and help
them make decisions,'' said Fraser.
   The morning show offers practical suggestions on health,
cooking, home buying and remodeling, automobiles and arts. It has a
number of regular experts, including one who reviews movies and
videos from the standpoint of families with small children.
``Home'' marks its 500th show on Thursday and celebrates its second
anniversary on Jan. 18.
   But for Fraser, who established ABC's ``Good Morning America,''
``The Mike Douglas Show,'' ``That's Incredible'' and many other
shows, it got very personal seven months ago.
   Fraser, 55, suffered a heart attack and underwent bypass
surgery. Since then, he's lost 47 pounds by changing his eating
habits and exercising.
   ``I cut out fats and dairy products from my diet and took up
exercise,'' he said. ``I went from being a sedentary individual to
a person who's active again. I get more sleep. I do yoga. I found
that doctors don't know anything about diet. I read all the books
that people sent me when I had my heart attack. I picked out the
things that worked for me.''
   He put his personal experiences on the air and made a rare
appearance as a guest. Last July, after he returned to work, he
devoted a week to a series called ``Heart and Soul.'' The show was
devoted to a study that showed yoga, meditation and positive
affirmation are helpful in preventing and recovering from heart
attacks.
   ``Home'' also undergoes a change next Tuesday. Gary Collins
takes over as host, replacing Robb Weller. Collins has been host of
the Miss America Pageant for the past five years and was the
Emmy-winning host of ``Hour Magazine.''
   Fraser said he's wanted to do ``Home'' ever since he founded
``Good Morning America'' in 1975.
   ``I wanted a show that would go later in the morning,'' he said.
``Its purpose is to give women information that they can apply to
their lives. The key word here is information. I said to ABC, `Give
me 60 minutes and I'll give you 30 ideas you've never heard of.'
It's a hard show to promote because we offer help for the home.
   ``Recently in the TV listings `Oprah' had a show about women who
had shot their husbands and still loved them. `Geraldo' had satanic
babies. `Donahue' had cross-dressing. And we had a show about
barbecuing.
   ``We don't have a great come on. But the people who watch our
show come back. That's why Gary Collins is taking over. I want to
add his marquee value to the show. I think he'll bring us viewers.''
   Of all network shows on daytime television, ``Home'' has the
largest audience among women 18-34, Fraser said. ``Home'' also puts
out a newsletter that goes to two million subscribers.
   A show on poisons in the home got 44,000 responses to a 900
number. For $2 viewers got a newsletter, information on poisons and
$6 in coupons. The sponsor had expected only about 5,000 responses.
   Since it began, the show has expanded to an hour from 30 minutes
and has gone to live telecast instead of tape. The live telecast
allows the show to have satellite remotes and to take instant polls.
   ``Home'' has also taken its name to heart and has purchased
three houses and is about to purchase a fourth.
   ``We take the viewer through every step of the purchase and
financing,'' said Fraser. ``Then we go in and remodel and
redecorate the house. We started with a house that cost about
$160,000. Then we sold it and bought a house for $240,000. Each
time we apply the profit to buying a more expensive house. The last
house we bought for $300,000 but we haven't been able to sell it
because of the poor real estate market.
   ``The last house is a duplex. People had asked us to do
something on apartments. Each side of the house is like an
apartment, so we were able to show people things to do with smaller
space.''

<HL> Pampered Pooches Can Lap Up the Life Of Luxury in Japan --- Bikinis, Yogurt and Spas Fill Dog Days of Summer; Kitty's $6,000 Necklace </HL>

<TEXT>
   After traveling 400 miles from Tokyo to one of Japan's most popular hot spa resorts, Mary decides she doesn't like bathing outdoors, especially with male company. 
She takes one dip in the steaming water, then springs up, clutching the edge of the tub. 
She glances indignantly at Harry, who sits relaxed, head back in the water, eyes closed. 

   Mary, an eight-month-old miniature spaniel, and Harry, a two-year-old Chihuahua, are spending a relaxing weekend at the Kinugawa Kokusai Hotel's "pets-only, mixed-bathing" outdoor spa. 
After the bath, they will get a thorough blow-dry, and then chow down a low-fat dinner of boiled chicken and milk, at the same table as their owners. 

   Such are the lengths that Japanese pet lovers go to to pamper their pooches. 
Californians may have their dog cemeteries and cat psychics, but in the last few years, Japanese pet freaks have become every bit as eccentric, creating a $2 billion-a-year industry. 
Goods and services now available to Japan's 12 million dogs and cats include diapers, bikinis, dating services, weddings, yoga and funerals. 

   "This pet boom is absurd," says Katsumi Hoshino, a lecturer on changing social trends at the University of Tsukuba. 
"There are more businesses for pets than for people." 

   The cause of all this is simple: Some Japanese have more money than they know what to do with. 
Few can afford to buy housing in Japan's overheated real-estate market, so some spend the surplus yen on canned oxygen (used by sports buffs and others) and electric nail shavers. 
Others, particularly middle-aged women, buy $1,900 Maltese dogs or $3,800 Scottish Fold cats, give them American names, which they think are cute, and then shower the little darlings with luxuries. 

   "Whenever I see cute pet clothes, I keep wanting to buy them," says Kinue Gunji, a housewife living in the south of Tokyo. 
"Sure they cost money. 
But I love my dog more than my child." 
Mrs. Gunji is staying at the spa with her daughter, her husband, and her Pomeranian, Shelley, who gets a monthly medical check-up, and was recently treated to a new set of rain boots. 

   Hotel owner Keiko Akutsu began offering pet lodging and meals last year, after she took a trip to Europe and was impressed by the welcome many hotels there extended to animals. 
Expanding on the European concept, Mrs. Akutsu charges people $110 a night to stay at her hotel, and allows their pets to stay with them for an extra $4. 
Her hotel's revenues have nearly doubled. 

   "The owners are so pleased when we treat the pets like people," says the 55-year-old Mrs. Akutsu, who even has little futon mattresses for the pets. 
Animal guests, who tend to arrive wearing hats and dresses, are referred to as "little boys" and "little girls." 
Owners are discreetly handed a plastic pick-up bag and a packet of tissues before they go for a walk. 

   These boys and girls are free to socialize in the lounge beside the pet souvenir shop, while their owners chat. 
Squeezed into a tight denim jumpsuit, Chuji, a chubby male Pomeranian, bounces off the table, flapping the red ribbons tied around his ears. 
Two of his buttons have burst. 
"We have a jumpsuit just like that one," says Mrs. Gunji, the devoted owner of Shelley. 
"But ours has a little pocket to put tissues in." 

   Chuji and Mary rub noses, and their owners coo in delight. 
Shingo, a two-pound Chihuahua wrapped in a red kilted vest, is jealous. 
Seeking attention, he strolls over to the bar and urinates on the carpet, making Mrs. Akutsu rush over with a can of deodorant spray. 
His owner, a middle-aged woman in pink pajamas, gives him a little slap, then cuddles him tightly. 

   Those looking for more things to put on the dog, will enjoy the Osaka pet fair this month. 
Along with pet clothes, wigs and good luck charms, there will be $380,000 cats prancing around wearing $6,000 necklaces. 
Then, there will be the wedding. 
Two Shetland sheepdogs, one dressed in a tuxedo and the other in a wedding dress, will exchange collars in front of a human "priest," as bow-tied St. Bernards and Pomeranians watch and wag. 

   Actually, the groom is lucky to have found a bride. 
In Japan, where many pet owners live in apartments, most male house pets can't sneak out at night, and thus have no chance to meet girls. 
They end their lives single and sad, says Isoroku Kimura, a Tokyo pet-shop owner. 
He felt so sorry for them that last year, he set up a pet dating service. 
Twenty dogs, each of whose owners has dished out snap shots, resumes and $75 for each date, have high hopes for the coming mating season this fall. 

   Even pets' everyday food and clothing are becoming more upscale. 
At Adachiya, a pet fashion boutique in Tokyo's Asakusa district, a baseball uniform, with cap and socks, hangs next to a raincoat and a dress with huge sunflower patterns. (Sunflowers are also the fashion for human girls in Japan this summer.) 

   "We sometimes wonder if these things are really necessary," confesses Yoshio Iida, an Adachiya executive. 
But the tiny store sold 170 pet garments one cold winter day. 
The clothes, priced $30 and up, are made in all sizes, to fit anything from Chihuahuas to Great Danes. 
A simpler T-shirt, jumpsuit, or cotton kimono is recommended for sharp-nailed cats. 
There are also a red bikini for the beach, a knapsack for the mountains, a $300 kimono and a $7,600 white mink coat for special photo-taking occasions. 

   Sogo department store in Yokohama prepares elaborate take-out meals for pets. 
The most popular, says a store official, is the $75 pet steak dinner of premium rare beef, unsalted ham, sausages and cheese, and white chocolate for dessert. 
Yasuaki Ohmori, a Tokyo high-school teacher, confesses to having stolen a bite of his dachshund's meal, a meat dish in a special sauce. 
"It was quite tasty," he says in embarrassment. 

   When too much rich food starts showing as flab, Fido can turn to jogging machines and yogurt, made especially for dogs. 
At Japan Trimming School, pets can take a 45-minute private yoga lesson for $35: An instructor personally stretches them into 15 poses, intended to improve blood circulation and relax muscles. (Concentration is said to be essential, so distracting observers aren't allowed.) 
Although most students are canines, someone once brought a rabbit for a stretch. 

   After the prized pet eventually passes away, a funeral service will cremate the pet right outside the owner's door. 
Jippo Corp., a truck company, sends a young woman ceremony director in the "Pet Angel Service" truck. 
Clad in a pink jumpsuit to give the event a rosier image, she instructs tearful owners to place flowers on the pink altar, next to the truck's incinerator. 
"Thank you for taking care of me up till now," says a recorded woman's voice. 
The ashes are placed in a candy jar. 

   A more symbolic ritual proceeds in a planetarium-like dome in the basement of a western Tokyo pet shop. 
Mourners gaze upward at a $520,000 computer-generated image of a galaxy, while music blares. 
A pulsing blob of light in a clear pyramid, meant to represent the pet's soul, shoots a spark of light into a star. 

   "There," says the funeral director. 
"The pet has gone back to the land of stars."

<LEADPARA>  DISTRAUGHT over breaking up with lover Barbara Hershey, David Carradine threw
himself into the Pacific during a storm in 1975. It threw him back.;   Walking
back to his Malibu house after that Jonah-like experience, he wondered why he
was still alive. "I decided I had to do something," he says.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  KUNG FU BECOMES 'KUNG FU' STAR'S REAL-LIFE MISSION  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Cover Story; Religion &amp; Ethics  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     His future, he eventually concluded, lay in his past: the Chinese martial
art of kung fu, which he had shown off for five years on network TV. He had
been taking daily formal training in kung fu for a year; now he would delve
deeper into its spiritual aspects.;   The decision has blossomed into a new
goal and a new book, "Spirit of Shaolin" (Charles E. Tuttle Co., Boston),
which he hopes will bring others toward "the way" he still seeks.;   "Kung fu
put me back together, but it's only a preamble to real knowledge," says
Carradine, now 54. "You've got to go beyond that, to the teaching. Within
these moves, and the blending of mind and body, there is an experience that is
somewhat spiritual.";   The book, published this month, returns Carradine to
the fore of a movement he helped popularize. Despite graphically violent films
by the likes of Chuck Norris and Steven Seagal, devotees insist that breaking
faces for revenge is not the point of the martial arts. It is, many believe, a
way to achieve inner peace -- and even a way to explore metaphysical reality.;
  That deeper purpose, Carradine says, is what he hopes readers will
carryReligion &amp; Ethics; (box) Science vs. politics, Page 10C; (box) Missing
Swaggart, Page 10C; (box) Bishop's Charity Ball, Page 10C; away from his book.
"To me, kung fu is a metaphor -- a way to examine the fabric of the universe
with my fingers.";   Not all martial-arts students have such ultimate goals.
But in thousands of schools nationwide, students are kicking, throwing,
chopping -- and, in many cases, meditating and philosophizing -- their way to
what they believe is a fuller lifestyle.;   Take William Collazo, 19, of North
Lauderdale, Fla., who won three medals last year at the Junior Olympics in
Tallahassee, including two in karate.;   He began studying karate at age 5,
prompted by his father, but his interest went far beyond the physical. This
year, he switched his major at Cornell University from engineering to Asian
studies. He has studied Buddhism and Hinduism, but he especially admires
Jainism -- a Hindu religion 2,500 years old that reveres all living things,
down to the microbe level.;   He says friends sometimes ask if the teachings
clash with his Catholic upbringing. He admits, "I'm going through a period of
questioning my beliefs. Who knows? Maybe I'll come out of this a Buddhist.
Maybe not.";   Most people come to martial arts for non-religious reasons: to
get in shape, beat up a bully, reduce stress. Any reason is fine, according to
Carradine.;   In his book, he writes that kung fu can bring "serenity, lack of
tension, heightened awareness, greater moral fiber, increased will power, less
fatigue, better understanding of oneself and one's environment, better social
relations, confidence, material success, oneness with nature, freedom from
fear, anxiety and boredom, resistance to illness, freedom from vice, increased
longevity and the ability to kick ass.";   In a phone interview, he says the
"kick ass" part is "just a hook to get the young people in." But he points out
that Kwai Chang Caine, also known as "Grasshopper," the Chinese immigrant he
played in the 1971-'75 "Kung Fu" TV series, fought only to defend himself and
others, not to even a score.;   "The real essence of kung fu is not
self-defense but philosophy," he says. "If even two classes can enrich your
life, go.";   He takes his own advice, having broadened his study to seven
kung fu styles, with names such as law horn, ling po and praying mantis. It
was his sifu, or teacher, Kam Yuen, who urged him to write "Spirit of Shaolin"
-- and even offered to write it for him.;   In the martial arts, the
metaphysical both arises from the physical and gives rise to it. The thrust,
counterthrust and whirling moves are often compared to a dance executed with
no thought, only trained responses. "Stillness in movement," one saying calls
it.;   That feeling can transform into mystical, transcendent moments of
"expanded consciousness." Experts say the opponent frequently seems to move in
slow motion, telegraphing his every move.;   Kung fu goes back at least to 500
A.D., when, a story says, an Indian monk started exercising Chinese Shaolin
students to keep them from nodding off during meditation. This developed into
hundreds of methods for armed and unarmed combat.;   Over the next few
centuries, kung fu helped create karate on the island of Okinawa and tae kwon
do in Korea. Japan, which in 1922 adapted karate -- a word meaning "empty
hand" -- already was home to the empty-handed arts of aikido and judo, as well
as the swordfighting art known as kendo.;   More than fighting;   Inevitably,
their Asian practitioners infused the martial arts with philosophy, which
generally teaches oneness with the universe. Some used Zen Buddhism to
cultivate the idea of a mental stillness. Some used the 64 hexagram patterns
in the "I Ching," the Chinese book of philosophy and divination, as the model
for the shifting movements in kung fu. (The patterns are believed to have come
originally from the cracks in baked turtle shells used for divination by
prehistoric Chinese -- something the inventors of the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles probably didn't have in mind.);   The yin-yang symbol, the circular
symbol showing the exchange of opposites in Taoism, became the symbol for tai
chi chuan. The discipline uses movements of opposing animals such as the snake
and the stork as exercises to help stimulate the body's life-force flow. Even
the Japanese samurai saber is thought to have a spirit, imparted by its user.;
  So subtle are Taoistic concepts that many Westerners may never grasp them
fully.;   Missing the subtext;   David Jones, an anthropologist at the
University of Central Florida in Orlando, has studied aikido for 20 years,
including two years in Japan. He also has studied hatha yoga and tai chi
chuan. He cites an Asian maxim not to "confuse the moon with the finger that
points to it.";   Jones' interpretation is that Westerners keep trying to
emulate the surface effects -- the weapons, the "kiai" shrieks, the flying
kicks -- and miss the main point of being at peace with oneself and others.;  
Faced with the cultural gap, some Asian instructors try to Americanize their
teachings. One is Ngo Dong, an entomology professor at the University of
Florida. In 1977, he fled his native Vietnam, bringing his cuong nhu martial
art, which he pieced together from karate, judo, kung fu and other arts.
Today, he teaches cuong nhu in Gainesville, Fla.;   Dong's amalgam also uses
elements of Eastern philosophy, such as a 10-step circle or sphere of learning
derived from Taoism. The circle sees a novice as a "nobody" who becomes a
learner, then an achiever, then a leader and so on, until he finally becomes a
"nobody" once more -- ready to expand further across the sphere.;   But the
philosophy is couched in rhyme, repetition and alliteration to make it
palatable to Americans. An example is his "5 Res's for interrelations" --
responsibility, respect, responsiveness, resolution, resiliency.;   "It's like
cooking Indian, Chinese or Vietnamese," he explains. "All of them have their
very traditional side, but they're wide open, technique-wise. I blended what
was most easy to digest from each.";   In cuong nhu, along with the other
martial arts, Eastern influence is apparent in the use of a mystical life
force known as chi in Chinese, ki in Japanese, gi in Korean. The force,
according to the sages, is in the air and in all living things. In humans, it
can concentrate about two inches below the navel, the body's center of
balance. One aim of meditation and breathing exercises is to "sink your ki" to
this spot, to anchor yourself and prepare to use it.;   Chi packs a punch;
Practitioners say they can use the force to heal with a touch or occasionally
down a student with just a look. Carradine says that in 1976, he accidentally
knocked two people across a room with the flick of two fingers. Kam Yuen, his
kung fu instructor, later taught him to control his chi.;   Is "the force"
real? That's what separates the mechanics from the mystics. Some teachers,
such as Florida kung fu instructor Andrew Chung, see it as a simple natural
law. "Chi is in the air, in the food we eat. When I teach tai chi chuan, I
tell people to feel like they're swimming in the air, that they're connected
outside their bodies.";   Diehard Episcopalian; Carradine -- whose book
touches on mysticism, nutrition and medicine -- says he divorces philosophy
from creed. He still regards himself as Episcopalian, the church into which he
was baptized as a baby. He sees no difference between Taoism and
Christianity.;   "In Christianity it wasn't spelled out; it was demonstrated,"
he says. "Christ was probably the only real example of the Tao ever."  </TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Communist Party leader Egon Krenz was too
busy to receive him, but otherwise all went well for a swami who
returned to East Berlin on Saturday to retrace a bizarre flight
over the Berlin Wall six years ago.
   Officials at East Berlin's government headquarters on the
near-deserted Marx Engels Platz were nonplussed but welcoming when
Swami Vishnu Devananda showed up in his flowing pink and orange
peace robes to present a thank-you message to Krenz for opening the
Berlin Wall.
   ``They're swearing in the new government right now. Times are
changing and Mr. Krenz is a bit busy,'' an official at the
headquarters explained. ``But we'll see he gets the letter.''
   Swami Devananda later said he received a personal welcome from
Krenz as the party leader left the building, but there was no
official confirmation.
   The swami, head of the Svinanda Yoga Vendata sect based in
Canada, was arrested last time he dropped by in 1983.
   On that visit, he flew over the wall from West Berlin in a
motorized kite with a bunch of flowers, landed in a field outside
the eastern sector and, after six hours under arrest, was sent back
over the wall.
   On Saturday, the 62-year-old swami drove through the Checkpoint
Charlie border post, offering a homemade ``peace passport.'' The
border guard turned that down, examined the real one and then waved
the silver-haired swami and three followers through.
   At the government building, guards smiled cheerfully when the
swami settled down on the sidewalk for a yoga session.
   ``You're very happy now. Last time everyone was uptight,'' he
said.
   In his letter to Krenz, the swami asked for the motorized kite
back. But officials told his followers earlier in the week that it
had been destroyed.
   On Friday, the swami released peace balloons and pigeons at the
wall in a day of commemoration that went wrong.
   The balloons and most of the pigeons flew West and a model plane
built to commemorate the original flight crashed twice before
buzzing round the West Berlin airstrip from where he took off
secretly in 1983.

<HL> LEISURE &amp; ARTS -- Bookshelf: Mom's Troubles at an Ashram </HL>
<AUTHOR> Raymond Sokolov </AUTHOR>

<TEXT>
   What does this woman want? 
She's left her doctor-husband and her big suburban house near Boston and her daughter, and betaken herself to Ashram Arhat in Arizona. 
It all seems to be a classic midlife crisis, part self-assertion, part self-denial. 
Perhaps Sarah Worth's flight into the arms of meditational communalism in the Southwestern desert is merely an extension of her earlier life, a postgraduate fellowship that builds on yoga classes she used to take at home. 

   Sarah is the "S." of John Updike's latest novel (Knopf, 279 pages, $17.95), and he leaves no doubt where he is coming from (as one of the Arhat subgurus might have put it). 
Sarah's initial is an update on the "A" that Hester Prynne wore for adultery in "The Scarlet Letter." 
Nathaniel Hawthorne is not, however, Mr. Updike's only inspiration. 
Much more central to his enterprise was the journalism done by Frances Fitzgerald and others about a real-life ashram based on sex and cash and fascism in Oregon called Rajneeshpuram. 
That blighted utopia has since vanished in a haze of criminality and Rolls-Royce exhaust. 
Mr. Updike's version of it, seen through the eyes of a WASP mom, will probably not endure much longer than Rajneeshpuram did, but its author deserves only mild condemnation. 
There are no jail sentences for pretension or for creating inconsistent characters. 

   The pretentious part of "S." is its flaunting of unassimilated lingo from the world of yoga and allied fields. 
Mr. Updike is frank to tell us that he has crammed Eastern religion from various standard sources. 
He quotes, with attribution, from "The Dhammapada," and he provides the puzzled reader with a glossary of technical terms ("bhaga: womb; vagina; good fortune, happiness, excellence"). 
Admittedly, some of the entries have a certain lightheaded poetry to them, as does some of the rest of the book. 
But "S." is no place to learn about Buddhism. 
Mr. Updike is no guru, nor does he really intend to be. 
And yet he spends so much of his time blathering in tantric terminology that the ironic or humorous potential of it as yogobabble or yogibberish gets lost. 

   The book falls between, as it were, the linga and yoni of satire and true belief, mocking and yet not mocking. 
And Sarah Worth herself fails to straddle the gap, but it's not for want of trying. 

   You have to admire Sarah. 
She really gives it a go out there, without losing much dignity. 
Oh, she does suffer a bit of what the defendant in the "Preppy Murder" of Jennifer Levin termed "rough sex." 
And she has to endure some obscene name calling. 
But after a little initial discomfort, Sarah rises to the top of the heap at Arhat, finding multiorgasmic satori with the guru of gurus and bilking the place out of a good hunk of its capital. 

   This all develops in the time-honored manner of the epistolary novel. 
In other words, we know only what Sarah writes home to friends or records on cassette. 

   The trouble is that Sarah's too big and too sensible a character for the nonsense world she has inexplicably run off to. 
She is no Alice blundering into a new-age Wonderland, but a shrewd, manipulative and completely unscrupulous adult, hiding behind a deceptively genteel facade. 
First, she bilks her husband, then the Arhat. 
And no regrets. 
Here is a woman who makes Ivan Boesky look like a sanctimonious loser. 
Except that you have to ask yourself how the same person could have been so misguided as to have married her husband or to have thought that Ashram Arhat was the place to go after shedding him. 

   This is how Sarah sounds, explaining in a letter to her daughter, Pearl, that the spots on the stationery are tear stains: "I'm wearing the silk sari, in case the Master comes in. 
Water is bad for silk and saltwater must be worse. 
But it felt good to cry. 
The Master has given me so much of his own peace I'd almost forgotten how to manage a good old Occidental convulsion -- a "Schmerzfest," a purgative "deluge des larmes chaudes." 
So, then, to continue." 

   The best we can say about that kind of stuff is that it's what comes out when a writer of great glibness lets himself go. 
Perhaps Sarah should be taken as an Updikean Miss Marple, a preposterous but lovable woman who only seems to be a ditz. 
But even if you are willing to read this book as an E.F. Benson comedy with saguaros and sagebrush in the background instead of perennial borders and copper beeches, Sarah will stop you. 

   Sarah is simply too many people all at once, too many voices. 
Writing to her exhusband, she says: "Don't you see, dear muddlehead, we were a "wave,"a certain momentary density within the maya-veil of karma -- events that produced Pearl, but now she is moving on and we must too. 
Let go of her and me." 
But in the next sentence, she changes from airhead to hardhead: "You have the houses and the New Hampshire land and all the silver that didn't come from either the Prices or the Peabodys -- the Worth stuff is clunky but sterling and you could sell it on consignment through Shreve's if you're feeling so desperately poor." 

   Sarah could have been salvaged with some tinkering, her disparities knitted smoothly together. 
She requires dvandvanabhighata, the "cessation of trouble from pairs of opposites." 
But for that kind of rewriting, a man has to achieve ekagrata, "the state of concentration whereby the "yogi" eliminates distractions and gains control over his restless consciousness."

PRIVATE LIVES: WALK LIKE A MAN...OUT OF MY AEROBICS CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN LITTWIN, Susan Littwin is a feature writer for TV Guide. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I'M MIDDLE-AGED and middle-class and have no history of violence. In fact, the 
only thing I do with any physical force at all is exercise, and I do that in a 
fancy health club in the Valley. So I surprised myself a few weeks ago when I 
nearly came to blows with a half-naked man in my aerobics class. 
</P>
<P>
The man had planted himself front and center in a fast-paced class and refused 
to budge when the class began moving back and forth across the room. He just 
stood there, doing his own little duck paddle. When I crossed what he 
considered to be his territory, he pushed me -- hard. This was no warning 
nudge. This was an outright mean shove. 
</P>
<P>
I turned on him like a kid in a schoolyard fight. The music stopped; luckily, 
no fists flew. We stood toe to toe, eyes blazing. "Don't you ever push me 
again!" I said, teeth clenched. "You'd better watch out!" he lashed back, jaw 
jutting. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind that I felt foolish. What matters to me now is why I was so angry 
with this otherwise unprepossessing middle-aged man. At the time, I just felt 
that he was an intruder, an intolerably male and self-important intruder. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is -- and I'm fully aware I'll be called a reverse sexist, but I've 
lived with direct sexism a long time, and now it's my turn -- I'm highly 
annoyed by men in aerobics classes. This is simply because, in my experience, 
men -- with the exception of professional athletes and the Chippendales dancers 
-- are not good at aerobics. Their movements are too big, too lumbering, too 
uncoordinated. No aerobics teacher will admit this publicly because men are 
paying customers, and fitness people tend to be evangelical. Instead, teachers 
offer special (meaning "slow") classes to introduce men to aerobics. (I even 
read somewhere that a gym was using martial music for men's classes, the theory 
being that they respond to it better.) 
</P>
<P>
But men seem to like aerobics, and more and more of them are showing up at my 
health club's crowded advanced workout at 5:15 p.m., wearing their gym shorts 
and tank tops, swinging their arms and perspiring heavily. They don't notice 
the women around them edging a few extra inches away. And it doesn't occur to 
them that they are annoying, maybe even, well, unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
I hasten to say I'm not suggesting that men be banned from aerobics classes -- 
not now anyway, when the Jonathan Club and the California Club have finally 
admitted a few women. I just wish men would understand that they are entering a 
woman's domain and learn how to behave acceptably. 
</P>
<P>
After all, women have always struggled to live in a man's world. As children, 
we were tossed out of games for "throwing like a girl," or even worse, "running 
like a girl." As adults, some of us wear suits and neckties to enter business 
and politics and straight-hipped pants to join the police and fire departments. 
We labor valiantly to act like men, to be more competitive, to hide our tears, 
to hold our liquor. We spend a good part of our lives trying one way or another 
to be one of the boys. 
</P>
<P>
But men never have to be one of the girls. When they enter what they consider 
female territory -- the produce section of the supermarket, for instance -- 
they turn adorably bumbling. "What are baking potatoes?" they ask aloud, 
clutching a list prepared by a woman, until a clerk or a female shopper comes 
forward to help them. It's a subtle form of slumming, a way of saying, "I don't 
need to know this." 
</P>
<P>
I got angry in that exercise class because I realized that men are so 
comfortably at home in the world that it never dawns on them to act like women. 
For instance, women are self-conscious, a little self-effacing, about their 
physical abilities. A woman who couldn't keep up with the class would tuck 
herself discreetly in the back or to the side of the room. Men don't seem to 
mind not keeping pace with their companions, at least not in aerobics. They 
blithely stand up front, blocking everyone else's view of the instructor, and 
step to music only they hear. One man does odd yogalike stretches while the 
rest of us are following the warm-up routine. Another jogs monotonously from 
side to side. 
</P>
<P>
Women also use space humbly. Notice the way men and women sit. He sprawls over 
both armrests in the movies; she keeps her knees together and elbows close to 
her side. In the gym, women mentally cordon off enough territory to raise their 
arms and keep repositioning to make room for others. Men stand where they 
please and expect others to watch out for them. 
</P>
<P>
And physically, women have better control and coordination. We can remember 
steps and keep the beat. Maybe it's a matter of hormones. A recent study 
connects greater verbal skills and muscular coordination with high estrogen 
levels. But it's also a matter of values. Some men (the ones who don't just 
duck-paddle in place) think that the benefit of aerobics comes from the sheer 
hurtling of the body. They heave and flail, sometimes with weights precariously 
clutched in their slippery hands. Gasping for air and dripping lakelets on the 
floor, they'd be a serious distraction even if they weren't out of step and off 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
One man at my health club pins his locker key to his shorts so that it jingles 
off beat with him. A friend who works out at a famous Westside studio says a 
man there once sweat so profusely that six women shouted in unison, "Get a 
towel!" Minutes later, he lost his grip on a weight and sent it flying into 
someone's face. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, men can't trade in their large muscles for our small ones; they 
can't control their sweat glands, and they probably shouldn't take estrogen. 
But they could emulate us and strive for grace, rhythm and control, instead of 
sticking to the masculine ethos that all exercise is a show of force. And if 
they can't keep up with the class, they can do their modest jog in the back of 
the room until their stamina and coordination improve. 
</P>
<P>
They might also dress like women. This is a touchy point, I know, because men 
feel funny about wearing tights. But a man in shorts, spread-eagled on a mat, 
is no sight for strangers. Anyway, tights are useful garments. They absorb 
perspiration; there's no way to pin a locker key to them.

Men could think of it as dressing for success.

<LEADPARA>  WITH the economy in recession, now's the time to save. And a good place to
start is taxes. Although Congress eliminated most tax shelters and loopholes
in 1987, there still are deductions and credits available for older taxpayers.
Here's a roundup:;    (box) Credit for the Elderly or Disabled: You may
qualify for this credit if, by the end of 1990, you were age 65 or older or
were retired on permanent and total disability and had taxable disability
income during the year. There also are income limitations to consider. Call
800-TAX-FORM to request IRS publication 524, "Credit for the Elderly or the
Disabled" for details.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (box) Credit for Child and Dependent Care Expenses: If going to work last
year meant paying someone else to care for a disabled spouse or a dependent,
then you may qualify for this credit. The amount of the credit ranges up to 30
percent of qualified expenses or your total earned income, whichever is less.
Qualified expenses include those for care provided in your home or in a
day-care center and housekeeping services.;    (box) Deduction for Medical and
Dental Expenses: If you itemize deductions, you can deduct medical and dental
expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income. Some examples
of qualified expenses: insurance premiums for medical and dental care;
out-of-pocket payments to doctors, dentists, nurses and hospitals; and
payments for prescription drugs, hearing aids and dentures.;    (box) Older
Homeowners Tax Exclusion: If you're 55 or older and sold a principal residence
in 1990, you may claim a once-in-a-lifetime exclusion of up to $125,000 of
profit generated by the sale. To qualify, you must have lived in the home for
three of the five years preceding the sale.;    Q I am 65 years old and in
good health except for severe headaches. Recently I had a complete medical and
neurological examination. The doctors found nothing wrong and concluded that
my headaches were caused by stress. They suggested I attend a
stress-management class offered by the hospital. Can stress really cause
headaches? How can I better manage stress?;    A All people experience some
degree of stress, the response of the mind and body to physical and emotional
events. Change, whether positive or negative, can cause stress.;    Doctors
and scientists have studied body responses to stress and found it causes
physical discomfort and can be a major cause of illness. The accumulated
effects of stress have been linked to ulcers and heart attacks.;    When a
person experiences stress, his or her nervous system is activated, pumping
adrenaline and other chemicals into the bloodstream. Breathing becomes shallow
and muscles tense up. If nothing is done to reverse the physical reaction, the
body remains in a state of tension.;    Symptoms associated with prolonged
tension include headaches, hyperventilation, lower-back pain, dry mouth, heart
palpitations, sleeplessness and stomach aches.;    Stress-management
techniques include assertiveness training, exercise, breathing exercises,
meditation, yoga and biofeedback. Consult books and your hospital's
health-education department for information on stress management.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  THE pros do it. We should, too.;    Stretching can keep us loose and limber,
able to do more. It can relax us, which is a boon to sleep and stress
reduction. And it can release muscle tension, easing headache or back pain.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Although stretching is an easy way to exercise, exercise tapes often give
it lip service or skip it entirely. So do many joggers and other weekend
warriors -- until muscle pulls send them to a doctor.;    Why stretch?;  Just
the stress of daily life sets up chronic, energy-draining contractions in many
of our bodies' 600-plus skeletal muscles. Both laughing and crying release
that tension by stretching muscles from head to groin. But exercising does it
better, because we tailor the stretches to our needs.;    Youngsters are
naturally limber, but as muscles age and become taut with daily stress,
stretching becomes a path to soothing both body and mind. Some find that this
quiet muscle work, descended from centuries-old yoga positions, becomes a
day's most serene moment.;    Athletes have much to gain, but benefits are
clear-cut even for sedentary people. Physiologists say everyday movements are
harmless to flexible bodies but hurtful to stiff ones. For example, twisting
to exit a car can strain, or "pull," a muscle in the back. Such an injury
could be prevented by daily stretching.;    Recent research at the University
of Texas casts doubts on claims that post-exercise stretching prevents delayed
muscle soreness after hard exercise or other activity. But other studies show
what baseball players already know as they take wide swings with a weighted
bat before stepping up to the plate: Stretching a muscle to about 120 percent
of its relaxed length allows the most powerful contraction possible when the
muscle is used moments later.;    How to stretch;  People unused to stretching
will be stiff and creaky at first. Two weeks of daily sessions, however, even
as brief as five minutes each, can make a body more supple.;    Bouncing, or
ballistic, stretches now are verboten. Physiologists learned the body has a
protective mechanism called the stretch reflex, which triggers a contraction
in response to a sudden stretch, defeating the point of a bounce stretch.;   
Modern advice calls for non-moving, or static, stretching. "On these exercise
videos, when they show someone reaching and saying, 'And stretch! And
stretch!' that's not it. Stretching is when you hold a position," says Gail
Tait, a stretching expert at the University of Michigan.;    In stretching,
regularity is far more important than intensity, coaches advise. Don't strain
while you stretch.;    Coaches and physiologists advise putting tension on a
muscle, then holding for 10 seconds as you relax and breathe rhythmically. And
then, the experts say, stretch slightly farther and hold another 20 seconds or
so, for optimal gains in flexibility.;    For non-athletes, holding a stretch
for the count of three is less boring, and fine if you repeat the move five
times, says physical therapist Carol Greenberg, author of the new "Pretend
Your Nose Is a Crayon and Other Strategies for Staying Younger" (Houghton
Mifflin, $9.95).;    When to stretch;  Some experts say we should stretch
anytime, anywhere. "I know people who stretch in bed while they're still
waking up. I call that the continuation of a yawn," says Bob Anderson, author
of the million-plus seller "Stretching" (Random House, $9.95), a 1975 classic
among fitness buffs.;    Anderson says industrial athletes will feel better
and be more productive and less injury-prone after stretch breaks on the job.
His most recent book is a self-published manual, "Stretching for Working
America" ($7.95; 800-333-1307), written with Sally Carlson, a former General
Motors-United Auto Workers health consultant.;    Others say that only when
done after exercise -- or a thorough, heart-pounding workout -- is stretching
effective in preventing injury.;    Perhaps the best bet is to stretch some
now, more later. Research at Auburn (Ala.) University showed unique benefits
to stretching before and after exercise.  </TEXT>

'FEEL-GOOD' PANEL HELD IN LOW ESTEEM;

NEW AGE: AFTER THREE YEARS AND $735,000, THE STATE'S TASK FORCE ON SELF-ESTEEM 
IS PROMOTING "YUPPIE EVANGELISM," SAN DIEGO'S LONE REPRESENTATIVE SAID.

<P>
San Diego County's lone representative on the much-lampooned state Task Force 
to Promote Self-Esteem says that the group's proposed final report is 
tantamount to "yuppie evangelism." 
</P>
<P>
Yogi devotee David Shannahoff-Khalsa, neuroscience researcher and director of 
the Khalsa Foundation for Medical Science in Del Mar, says that, after three 
years of hearings and $735,000, the controversial panel has yet to find proof 
that there is a link between self-esteem and the solution to social ills such 
as teen-age pregnancies, gang violence and drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, he says the report, scheduled to be released in mid-January, is 
sorely lacking in practical advice to help those on the lowest rungs of 
society. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Task force members rejected his suggestion to include guidelines 
for special breathing exercises, which Shannahoff-Khalsa says help reduce 
stress, fear, anger, addictions, obsessive-compulsive disorders and dyslexia. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel (the report) is a bunch of yuppie evangelism," he said in a telephone 
interview Thursday. "It is superficial in content, and I don't think that it 
has the depth of understanding to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
A draft copy of the final report was circulated at a task force meeting Monday 
in Sacramento. The panel voted to approve the document and send it to the 
printer for its expected Jan. 16 public release. 
</P>
<P>
Shannahoff-Khalsa, a 41-year-old biologist-turned-devotee of kundalini yoga, 
was nominated for a spot on the 25-member panel by Sen. William Craven 
(R-Oceanside) and has attended every one of the task force meetings since it 
began in early 1987 to explore the social ramifications of self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Shannahoff-Khalsa said he has grown disillusioned with the group 
because of its reluctance to go beyond feel-good buzzwords, like "esteeming," 
and boldly go where no New Age committee has gone before. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw this task force, I believed that what it was mandated to do was 
look for the mother lode of cure for these social problem areas," said 
Shannahoff-Khalsa. "And ultimately, I find the final report not to be 
acceptable, that it is an ineffective prescription for those most in need." 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the Del Mar meditation expert said, the task force is mistaken in 
its conviction that self-esteem is the key to alleviating many of today's 
social plagues. Research in the link between a good self-image and being a good 
citizen is, at best, incomplete and inconclusive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The task force has wanted to hang its hat on a positive causal relationship, 
or strong linkage," he said. "Unfortunately, the findings of the academic 
literature cannot support that." 
</P>
<P>
Shannahoff-Khalsa also said that the task force became so engrossed in the 
concept of self-esteem that it virtually ignored the more difficult questions 
of what a person should do to feel good about himself in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't tell somebody to be creative. You can't tell somebody to be 
spiritual. You can't tell somebody to appreciate their mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can teach them ways to learn to have a conscious relationship with it, 
and there are a lot of techniques that are out in the community at large that 
lend instruction in that way. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are suffering from anxiety, and you use one of these techniques, and 
five minutes later you can reduce the anxiety and feel a stillness and a peace 
of the mind, you've engaged yourself to lift yourself out of your own 
negativity," he said. "If you can lift yourself out of your depression, you may 
not suffer from problems of drug and alcohol addiction." 
</P>
<P>
One such technique, he said, is informed breathing. 
</P>
<P>
Shannahoff-Khalsa -- the latter an adopted Sikh surname that means 
"consciousness and purity" -- said he tried in vain to interest his task force 
colleagues to include breathing exercises in their proposed final report. One 
of the techniques he suggested would be a simple way to check for the side of 
the brain that is in charge at any given moment. 
</P>
<P>
Those under the influence of the left side of the brain would be more prone to 
defense, aggression and up on their verbal skills; those under the influence of 
the right side would tend to be more sensitive to others, attuned to their 
health and possessing a "global perspective of what is right." 
</P>
<P>
The way to know which one is the strongest is by the "congestion-decongestion 
response" in a person's nostrils, said Shannahoff-Khalsa. If the right nostril 
is the more congested, the left brain is calling the shots, and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Simple, but would the task force take heed? Not a chance. 
</P>
<P>
"Why are their eyes closed to it?" he asked. "Why are their ears closed to this 
approach? And it is certainly nothing new, and I don't think it would shock the 
media if findings were addressed in the task force approach. I think it is more 
shocking that it was left out." 
</P>
<P>
Shannahoff-Khalsa said he is especially disappointed with the task force's 
reaction in light of the fact that the National Research Council has hired him 
to write a report on how meditation can help military personnel perform better 
under stress. 
</P>
<P>
Robert R. Ball, executive director of the task force, said Thursday that task 
force members "bent over backwards" to accommodate Shannahoff-Khalsa's views, 
and at one point agreed to the Del Mar resident's request that the final report 
recommend a Sikh drug and alcohol rehabilitation center in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
"He wanted a 'how to' (in the task force report) on breathing, place the tip of 
your tongue on the roof of your mouth and so forth," Ball said. "Those are very 
specific exercises related specifically to his group that the task force as a 
whole did not feel were appropriate for a document that would be sent out to 
the whole state." 
</P>
<P>
But Shannahoff-Khalsa said such decisions were politically safe and resulted in 
a report that, in New Age terms at least, was pretty vanilla. 
</P>
<P>
"This task force is an effort to look beyond the mainstream of thought," he 
said, "but, from my perspective, we're still in the middle of the stream."

Inner Peace Costs a Mere $10

Is There Anything to It?

<TEXT>
   Nearly every day, Carol Cramer comes to the Paradise Shopping Center to buy her piece of nirvana. 

   "I was looking into Transcendental Meditation, but it takes so long" to learn the techniques, says Mrs. Cramer, a Sausalito homemaker. 
"I like something fast and easy. 
This takes no effort." 

   Universe of You, a new Marin County salon, offers help for high-strung people too busy to meditate. 
Now they can try to zap stress by hooking themselves up to a device called a Synchro-Energizer, which is supposed to "tune up" the wavelengths of the brain. 

   The machine costs about $50,000 and can accommodate up to 32 serenity seekers at a time. 
It uses electronic sound impulses and flashing light -- to balance, so the pitch goes, the left and right hemispheres of the brain. 
For $10 a pop, Marinites in goggles can enhance their creativity, increase their learning ability and find inner peace in about 45 minutes. 

   "Yogis are out, gurus are out. 
No one wants dogma anymore," says Randy Adamadama, a former night watchman at a science museum who now runs the brain-tuning salon. 
"This can get a person to a level of meditation in 15 minutes that would take a yoga instructor 10 years." 
Says a Synchro-Energizer salesman: "We're selling Buddha in a can." 

   Is there really anything to this stuff? 
"If flashing lights and goggles help you relax, that's good," says Stephen Peroutka, an assistant professor in Stanford University's neurology department. 
"Relaxation is always good for the body." 
He adds, however, that "there's no scientific evidence that any mechanical device can enhance learning or creativity. . . . 
There's no magic way to do it." 

   But Dr. Peroutka isn't surprised that people would use such devices. 
"This is the same country that bought pet rocks," he says. 
He suggests that memorizing multiplication tables or other types of studying would do more to "exercise" the brain. 

   Nevertheless, a growing but still tiny number of retail outlets are offering brain-enhancing sessions. 
Michael Hutchison, the author of "Megabrain," a book about brain machines, predicts that such brain spas "will be the Jack LaLannes of the future." 

   Mr. Hutchison, a poet and novelist, has been conducting Megabrain workshops around the country. 
He says that more than 1,000 people have paid about $100 to spend the day trying a dozen different brain machines. 
The interest, he says, reflects "people's tremendous desire for self-improvement, especially in their mental state." 

   Altered States, based in West Hollywood, Calif., has for several years been operating flotation tanks, where customers meditate in warm water. 
Recently, the center added a small, two-station Synchro-Energizer; a Mind Mirror, which monitors brain waves; and a Graham Potentializer, a table that rotates counterclockwise while generating an electromagnetic current. 
Altered States now offers $300 "Mind Gym" memberships, allowing patrons to use the assorted devices for 20 sessions. 
Says attendant Bart Miali: "It's really like using Nautilus equipment, only on the mind." 

   The Institute for DeHypnotherapy, in Soquel, Calif., offers "Sacred Journey Home" weekends for $150. 
They include sessions on its 32-station Synchro-Energizer and a Mind Mirror, as well as instruction in power breathing and other meditation techniques. 
"A whole lot more people are interested in higher consciousness, especially since the Harmonic Convergence," says C.C. Chaitanya of the institute's marketing department. 

   At Tranquility Center, a New York salon using the small Synchro-Energizer, operator Christine Zerrer says, "I've meditated 15 years and the experience is similar. 
In fact, I've hooked Zen monks up to it, and they even noticed some increased awareness. 
There's always room for improvement." 

   Each brain-machine entrepreneur has his own style. 
The big appeal of Universe of You is low price. 
"We're like the K mart of consciousness-raising," says Mr. Adamadama. 

   To understand the goals and people at Universe of You requires an open mind. 
"If you've never done anything like this before, you might just think of it as another Marin mind trip," concedes Mrs. Cramer, who once attended a Shirley MacLaine mind-expanding seminar and who last spring, she says, walked across seven feet of burning coals. 
She hopes the brain-tuner will help her have more lucid dreams, improve her memory and "make it easier to get into the vacation mode" for a coming trip to Hawaii. 

   Arthur Knadler, a Sausalito investor, calls himself a skeptic. 
"I don't embrace that mysticism stuff," he confides. 
Still, he gets Synchro-Energized a couple of times a week and finds it better than lying in flotation tanks, which he tried before. 
The Synchro-Energizer, he says, "gives you a general sense of well-being, and you don't have to get all wet." 

   Patrons enter a lavender lobby, decorated with symbols of yin and yang and pictures of a wizard and a waterfall. 
In a dimly lit room with mirrored walls and reclining padded chairs, the machine's operator invites customers to remove their shoes and loosen their clothing. 

   The customers put on headphones and goggles with four lights around each eye. 
Lights begin to flash at different speeds and intensities. 
Through the headphones comes the sound of a heartbeat, then assorted clicks, then a sound like a lawn sprinkler. 
Later there is synthesized music accompanied by the sound of the pounding surf. 

   An operator sitting at a console twists knobs that control intensity and pitch. 
"I use a very gentle, comfortable pitch to get them inside their niche with the machine," she says. 
"Toward the end, I get them alert and focused, so they can go back to work or drive their car without hitting a tree." 

   Afterward, patrons are invited into an adjoining room where an orange statue of Buddha, wearing Walkman headphones, sits between a pair of ferns. 
There they can sit in bamboo chairs, help themselves to herbal tea -- choice of carob or licorice flavor -- and share their experiences. 

   Bob Zatko, a hot-tub and sauna salesman from Oakland, says his first session provided "an alternative reality to normal reality." 
He found the experience "very relaxing; in fact, I fell asleep." 
One man marvels that "it sounded like you were right there at the ocean." 
The ocean, in reality, is a little bit down the road. 

   The operators at Universe of You make no medical claims, though patrons contend the machine has done everything from growing hair on bald spots and improving hearing to unleashing more-ethereal experiences. 
Stephen Landess, a maker of massage machines, says he wasn't prepared for an out-of-body experience that happened during one of his sessions. 
"I wasn't planning on going anywhere," he says. 
"My light body walked right out the door and went to the gas station." 

   The Synchro-Energizer is the brainchild of Denis Gorges, a Cleveland psychiatrist. 
He invented the machine, and his company, Synchro-Tech Inc., sells it. 
Dr. Gorges says he spent about 30 years developing it. 
"I walked around in a jogging suit hooked up with electrodes for two years," he says, "experimenting on myself with different stimuli." 
He says the machine's signals are "all brain-friendly." 

   Mr. Adamadama wants to franchise brain-tuning centers. 
To maintain quality control, he says, he would have to be sure franchisees are knowledgeable about holistic medicine, astrology and New Age music. 
"The California market is a natural," he says. 
"This kind of thing isn't new or alien to them."

". . . OK, almost done. Can you feel that? Two more . . . now let's switch to 
the other side. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Half a dozen women are stretched out on the floor in front of instructor 
Caroline Everette, performing an exercise that benefits both their inner thighs 
and their favorite cause: Opera Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The women are members of the New You Guild, the most recent addition to the 
Opera Pacific Guild Alliance. Each month, members get together for a workout 
and/or educational session. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had programs on yoga, low-impact aerobics, tap-dancing and stretching," 
says Nancy Jaffee, who chairs the guild. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent meeting was a combination of exercise, nutrition instruction 
and a health-conscious lunch, all provided by Le Meridien Hotel in Newport 
Beach, where Everette, a fitness buff and former opera singer, is employed. 
</P>
<P>
What do opera and fitness have in common? Both consider the human body a 
valuable instrument, the more finely tuned, the better. 
</P>
<P>
The idea of a fitness guild was born not in health-obsessed Southern 
California, but in Miami, where an opera fitness guild was formed last year. 
Laila Conlin, president of the guild alliance, heard about the idea and thought 
it would work in Orange County as well. So she asked Jaffee, who already worked 
out regularly, to lead the group. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen Opera Pacific supporters have signed up for the guild, although 
not all of them participate in the exercises. "A lot more come for the lunch," 
Jaffee says. 
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the hotel's French theme, Everette shared one of her favorite 
tips for exercising while traveling. "I used to take weights with me, but that 
wasn't very practical," she said. "And I also took along bottled water. So one 
day it occurred to me that I could use the water bottles as weights. You can 
carry them empty, and then fill them with water or even sand when you get to 
your destination." 
</P>
<P>
Everette asked the makers of Evian water to donate some samples for use as 
weights for the guild's exercise session. "They told me, 'We've had promotions 
before, but never anything like this.' " 
</P>
<P>
Participants used the bottles as weights for arms, legs and even stomachs. 
Everette's choice of music for the session, of course, was classical music and 
opera. 
</P>
<P>
"Ooh, 'Madame Butterfly!' " Conlin exclaimed when she heard an excerpt from one 
of her favorites. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the water bottle weights, Everette also provided extra water for 
drinking and a brief lecture on the importance of proper hydration. 
</P>
<P>
"Your thirst lags behind your need for water, so don't wait until you get 
thirsty," she said. "You should drink 8 ounces before exercising, 4 more ounces 
every 15 minutes and another 8 ounces within 20 minutes after exercise." 
</P>
<P>
After a 45-minute workout, the group adjourned to another room for a 
presentation by chef Pamela Sheldon on the virtues of olive oil, which several 
studies have found may reduce the risk of heart disease. Guild members and 
guests then were treated to an olive oil tasting, dipping chunks of fresh bread 
into sample cups of oil and rating them for color, taste and aroma. 
</P>
<P>
Olive oil, the group learned, contains mono-unsaturated fat, which is now 
considered healthier than other forms, including polyunsaturated fat. It's 
still fat -- about 115 calories a teaspoon -- but Sheldon said a healthful diet 
could include up to 30% fat. 
</P>
<P>
"Olive oil is the only edible oil available that's cold-pressed and not derived 
from heat," Sheldon said. "That makes a difference in cooking." 
</P>
<P>
The New You Guild isn't the first Opera Pacific support group to combine 
fund-raising with a favorite activity, Conlin said. Other guilds cater to 
gourmet diners, bridge players and travel buffs, among others. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it because it helps me stay fit and also helps the opera," Jaffee said. 
"And it's fun to get together with people who have similar interests." 
</P>
<P>
At lunchtime, the women drew curious stares as they walked from the meeting 
room to the patio. "Now that's a diverse group," said one onlooker, as the 
women, clad in everything from Spandex and sweats to dresses and high heels, 
strode past. 
</P>
<P>
"We are diverse," Conlin said later. And although she'd like to get more women 
involved in exercise, that will never be a prerequisite for participating in 
guild activities. "A lot of people may not be interested in exercise, but 
they're still interested in a healthy diet. It's whatever you want to do to 
improve yourself." 
</P>
<P>
Lunch featured recipes by Jacques Maniere, an innovator in fitness cuisine, 
including breast of chicken, steamed vegetables and dried fruit compote for 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
It's too soon to say whether the New You Guild will follow the lead of its 
Florida counterpart. "They put together a video called Operaerobics," Conlin 
said. "So that name's taken. 
</P>
<P>
"But we might do Operacize."

FT  06 JAN 93 / Management: Resolute approach to good health - Health Check

<TEXT>
MANY of us soon find that the new year's resolutions we made with much
enthusiasm only a few days ago quickly fall victim to the demands of
business life. But it need not be that way if you derive real pleasure from
the resolutions you make. My suggestion is to replace the stoic flavour of
traditional resolutions with new priorities on improving your quality of
life. The following should all be considered:
Rekindle close relationships. A stress-filled business life can damage
personal relationships. But remember that they are the key to your health
and happiness.
Respect your body and mind and listen to the signals they send you. Sleep
when you are tired and eat when you are hungry instead of out of habit.
Stay active. You may not like swimming and jogging. That's OK. There are
alternative exercises ranging from chopping wood to going for long walks.
Remember, diseases of all kinds tend to hate moving targets.
Make alcohol part of a larger ritual; convivial dinners are a healthy use of
alcohol. Drinking alone is a problematic form of self-medication.
Manage stress. Reading, yoga, music, sex, walking and meditation are
constructive ways to relax.
Quit smoking. There is no easy way out of this one. But if you do smoke,
limit yourself to those cigarettes you really 'enjoy'. And smokers should
avoid alcohol - it lowers their resistance.
Develop hobbies that are totally absorbing, different from your job, fun and
satisfying. If they involve your family, so much the better.
There is mounting scientific evidence that the age-old axiom 'laughter is
the best medicine' contains more than a kernel of truth. Humour is the
easiest way to reduce stress.
Make enjoyment of life a priority. Keep in mind that life is your real
career, not business or a profession.
The author is the medical director of the Insead Business Health course.

AL MARTINEZ: STRESS AND THE MAHARISHI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's a stressful world, and everyone needs a way to keep his head from 
exploding. I saw a head explode once and it isn't a pretty sight. Walls were 
spattered with shards of suppressed rage, sinewy strips of free-floating 
anxiety and small, hairy chunks of an inability to cope. It took weeks to clean 
up. 
</P>
<P>
Some method of reducing tension is obviously necessary if we are to survive in 
today's tense urban environment. There are hundreds of techniques, from 
squeezing rubber balls to screaming in the cemetery where your mother is 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
Someone in our neighborhood, for instance, beats tom-toms occasionally to, one 
presumes, put him or her (or them) into a state of restful meditation. 
</P>
<P>
Others down the block gather to chant in an effort to attain nirvana. The chant 
assumes a humming quality and on certain quiet nights sounds like a horde of 
wasps descending on Sweet Jesus Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
But if it helps ease stress, I say go for it. A Hum and Tom-Tom Band might even 
be in order. 
</P>
<P>
There are dangers to stress-reduction, of course. A friend tried yoga once to 
quiet his Furies and became entangled in a position from which he was unable to 
free himself. His wife was out of town and he was near starvation by the time 
someone found and untangled him. 
</P>
<P>
My point, if indeed I have one, is that there's no safe, sure-fire way of 
reducing stress and finding perfect peace. Unless, of course, you live in a 
City of Immortals. 
</P>
<P>
It's this way. There's a company called the Maharishi Heaven on Earth 
Development Corp. that is promoting the creation of 50 stress-free communities 
based on the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the guru of transcendental 
meditation. 
</P>
<P>
Company headquarters are in Malibu, but you probably already suspected that. 
</P>
<P>
The idea is to build tracts in accordance with natural laws, to the extent that 
houses will be placed on sites that utilize cosmic energy and are at peace with 
those spiritual cross-currents that enhance the beneficial purpose of each 
room. 
</P>
<P>
You'll walk into a dining room of such a home, for instance, and enjoy a 
healthy appetite. In the den, your most complex thoughts will snap into focus. 
In the bedroom, you'll feel either sleepy or sexually stimulated. I personally 
feel stimulated in the kitchen, but our house wasn't built under the 
Maharishi's Vedic guidance. 
</P>
<P>
Parks, vegetable gardens, nontoxic building materials and a kind of holistic 
conditioning are expected to create a collective happiness in each City of 
Immortals not unlike that enjoyed in the old days by Ozzie and Harriet Nelson 
on Sycamore Street. 
</P>
<P>
Picture the Nelsons, the Cleavers, kindly Dr. Kildare, Henry Aldrich, Aunt Bee, 
little Opie and the gang from "Father Knows Best" living in the same glorious 
neighborhood and you'll have some idea of what the corporation hopes to achieve 
in its heavenly communities. 
</P>
<P>
Transcendental meditation, or TM, for those ignorant of psychic 
self-improvement, taps one's universal energy to create a state of "restful 
alertness" that clears the mind, improves health and frees you from tension, 
anxiety and stress. 
</P>
<P>
Kinda makes you wanna sing and dance. 
</P>
<P>
I stopped by the office of the Heaven on Earth Co. the other day and talked 
with men in suits and ties who somehow seemed more . . . well . . . serene than 
most people. One was Curtis McDonald, a vice president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
This all began, I was told, two years ago at a gathering in India where the 
Maharishi declared that the problem of war was over and mankind ought to 
concentrate on quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
The concept somehow evolved into real estate speculation that shaped the notion 
of sweet-peace cities, a dozen of which are in various stage of development in 
the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
The difference between them and any other high-priced communities, McDonald 
says, is the removal of stress through many means, including programs of 
purification involving diet, exercise, meditation and, of course, the 
Gandharva-Ved music concerts with which we are all so familiar. 
</P>
<P>
When I suggested that stress might be a little difficult to leave behind in 
this era of people with Uzis who do not abide by the principles of spiritual 
fulfillment, he assured me that, in that case, security systems would be 
incorporated into each of the housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
Where good vibes fail, hire guards. 
</P>
<P>
This all sounds pretty good to me and I plan on moving into a City of Immortals 
myself. The possible intrusion of criminal mischief doesn't worry me at all. I 
am confident that Sheriff Andy of Mayberry, and his sidekick Barney, will be 
around to keep me safe and serene.

<P>
Are certain personalities attracted to specific sports? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, says James Gavin, a professor of applied social science at Concordia 
University in Montreal. Our personalities affect our choice of sports, our 
willingness to participate in a sport and how we perform in the sport. Which 
may explain why you're gagging on your weekly regimen of running, aerobics or 
yoga. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain emotional qualities reinforced by the choice of exercise, 
and within that exercise," Gavin says. "It's hard to get people to adhere to an 
activity that doesn't feel right to them." 
</P>
<P>
Define your measure of sociability, spontaneity, discipline, aggressiveness, 
competitiveness, mental and risk-taking abilities, and you'll have a better 
understanding of your sport of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin, who has written "Body Moves: The Psychology of Exercise," says that any 
physical activity can be analyzed in three dimensions he refers to as the 
psychological, physical and body movement domains. Our psychological 
preferences are bolstered by our body type and preference for certain kinds of 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
On Gavin's scale, swimming ranks very high in requiring discipline, and low on 
spontaneity, sociability and mental focus. In other words, once you get 
yourself into the water, you can glide solo on autopilot. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, "Basketball demands you pay attention; you have to be riveted in 
the moment," Gavin points out. "The activity by definition draws certain things 
from you." 
</P>
<P>
Like swimming, running demands discipline, but it's also low on spontaneity, 
risk-taking and mental focus. 
</P>
<P>
Walking may be the ultimate sport for meeting physical fitness needs over a 
broad range of personalities. It can be played either way for spontaneity and 
sociability. It requires little in the way of competitiveness, mental focus, 
risk-taking or aggressiveness, and it offers plenty of opportunity for 
spontaneity and sociability; in other words, walking is tailor-made for the 
individual seeking exercise without commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin's psychological parameters may give you some clues as to why you're not 
enjoying your fitness program, and what you can do about it. But while 
psychological and physical factors may determine what sport you'll enjoy most, 
there are other considerations. Time, convenience and cost also enter the 
picture, Gavin points out. 
</P>
<P>
Scientific research seems to show that a person will be motivated to exercise 
if he or she picks an activity that appeals to him. A study of Harvard 
graduates by a Dartmouth Medical School researcher indicated personality was an 
important factor in determining if an individual would stick with a fitness 
program. 
</P>
<P>
In the March, 1989, issue of Psychology Today, Gavin presented a chart showing 
how various sports and fitness activities rank according to seven parameters. 
Gavin refers to these parameters as Psychosocial Activity Dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
Gavin provided a work sheet that allowed us to rank ourselves from very high to 
very low in each dimension. Then we can compare our preferences to his 
evaluation of specific fitness activities. (In evaluating the activity, Gavin 
assumed the individual participates regularly in the sport or activity). 
</P>
<P>
The psychosocial activity dimensions include: 
</P>
<P>
* Sociability: Do you most enjoy being alone or having people around? 
</P>
<P>
* Spontaneity: Are you a quick decision-maker or do you prefer detailed 
planning? 
</P>
<P>
* Discipline: Do you prefer to stick it out once you start something? Or do you 
abandon activities that require continued effort? 
</P>
<P>
* Aggressiveness: Do you try to control events? 
</P>
<P>
* Competitiveness: Do you enjoy competitive situations or shy aware from them? 
</P>
<P>
* Mental focus: Are you able to concentrate on one thing when you want or have 
to? 
</P>
<P>
* Risk-taking: Do you enjoy taking risks or do you prefer tried-and-true 
approaches? 
</P>
<P>
Answering such questions gives us a clearer idea of how well our sport suits 
us, and why certain sports won't satisfy us. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem in determining an individual's sports personality is that 
people may play the same sport in different ways. An individual's behavior 
pattern in sports may be either participatory or competitive, according to Dick 
Lister, a clinical psychologist and sports psychologist in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"The participatory golfer may be on the course as much to enjoy its aesthetic 
qualities, the trees and the lakes, as he is to put the ball in the hole," 
Lister explains. "The competitive golfer may see the lake because his ball is 
in it." 
</P>
<P>
The participatory and competitive categories are roughly equivalent to the Type 
A and Type B behavior patterns with which we're familiar. In their book, "Type 
A Behavior and Your Heart," Drs. Meyer Friedman and Ray H. Rosenman define the 
Type A behavior pattern as an "action-emotion complex" in anyone "aggressively 
involved in a chronic, incessant struggle to achieve more and more in less and 
less time." 
</P>
<P>
There's also an environmental element to Type A behavior, the physicians say; 
an individual may behave in a hard-driving fashion only in certain situations, 
for example, at work, or on the racquetball court. 
</P>
<P>
An individual with a Type A personality who is trying to relieve some of the 
stress his behavior creates, may want to choose a sport that doesn't lend 
itself easily to competition, Gavin says. What the Type A character may need is 
a dose of playtime -- going out to walk streets he has never traveled before or 
maybe going fishing. 
</P>
<P>
"While (their favorite sport) may benefit them cardiovascularly, it may not be 
the best psychologically, because it reinforces qualities they already have an 
abundance of," Gavin says. "The Type A personality will go into a sport with 
real aggression. From health to performance to super performance in a very 
short time. If a Type A takes on a Type B activity, it quickly becomes a 
performance contest." 
</P>
<P>
But while the participatory athlete may be more relaxed than the competitive 
athlete, both may be benefiting from their approach to exercise. The 
competitive athlete doesn't have to consider taking the participatory approach 
unless he's doing damage to himself, Lister says. Competitive jocks are usually 
having a good time improving their performances. It's when the obsession with 
improvement actually leads to declining performance that things get weird. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers believe different personalities prefer different movements. 
</P>
<P>
"Type A movements are typically quick and linear, a sudden changeability as 
opposed to a flow," Gavin says. "The movement would be more in tune with 
racquet games or running than with yoga or t'ai chi. A Type A individual will 
gravitate toward those types of movements. There's a quantitative, performance 
emphasis." 
</P>
<P>
The Type B personality has a different attitude toward movement. "More likely 
you'd find them doing activities with more enjoyment to them, and with more 
movement flow," Gavin says. "Type B's may be runners, but they won't be likely 
to enter races with the same emphasis. (And) they might be more varied in the 
routes they take." 
</P>
<P>
While sports can be played in either a participatory or competitive fashion, 
some require more concentration than others even in the participatory mode. If 
you want to escape the pressures of your own personality, choose your sport 
wisely. After all, it's all in fun. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WHAT'S YOUR SPORT PERSONALITY? 
</P>
<P>
Matching your personality with your sport of choice will increase the 
likelihood that you'll stick with it, says Dr. James Gavin, a professor of 
applied social science at Concordia University in Montreal and author of "Body 
Moves: The Psychology of Exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Bodybuilders are characterized by Gavin as people who are persistent despite 
the obstacles. They don't like to change plans and they try to control 
situations by being forceful. Downhill skiers, on the other hand, are very 
social people who love spur-of-the-moment decisions. Sticking with things is 
difficult for them but they love a challenge and taking risks. Where do you

<HEAD>American Calls Off Milk Bottle-Balancing Walk Due To Upset Stomach</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A health food store manager from
New York said an upset stomach today kept him from trying to beat
his previous world record of walking with a bottle of milk on his
head for 32 miles.
   Ashrita Furman, of Queens, who has more listings in the Guinness
Book of World Records than anyone else, was going to perform the
feat on the track at Independence Stadium.
   ``I was throwing up and having diarrhea all night long,'' Furman,
35, told reporters.
   He said he will take another shot at the record later this month
when he travels to Chiangmai, Thailand on a tour by the Queens-based
Sri Chinmoy Center for meditation, yoga exercises and culture.
   Furman, who has rolled, hopped, jumped, rowed, clapped, skipped,
somersaulted and balanced his way to 11 world records, was presented
a ``versatility'' record by the Guinness Book of World Records in
1987 for having records in more categories than anyone else in the
world.

FT  30 SEP 92 / Management (Health Check): Tackling the types who take
stress to heart - Dr Michael McGannon looks at new research into coronary
disease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the 1960s, attempts have been made to define certain personality
characteristics that make some people more prone to coronary heart disease
than others. 'Type A' people, as opposed to their more laid-back 'Type B'
counterparts, have been described as the sort of people who are always in a
hurry, are inordinately impatient, aggressive or even hostile, speak in an
explosive way, and are goal-oriented, competitive and driven.
Over the years there has been no clear verdict on whether Type A personality
can be categorised as an independent risk factor for heart disease. However,
new research is shedding light on this complicated issue.
Two characteristics of Type A behaviour which may well lead to heart
disease, and which have also been linked to suppressed immune function and
cancer deaths, have been isolated by US researchers. They are: hostility -
antagonism as a form of severe competitiveness - and time urgency - 'never
enough hours in a day'.
These two traits are interrelated: to a person who has a sense of needing to
compress more and more activity into a shrinking day, anyone or anything
blocking that process will cause irritation and may provoke a hostile
reaction.
The human nervous system evolved during more primitive times when the main
threats to survival were physical. When faced with stress, the body's
systems, therefore, are geared to an appropriate physical response. The
nervous, cardiovascular and hormonal systems prepare the body either for
flight or a fight.
For example, blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rates all rise,
increasing oxygen demands by the heart; muscle tension increases in
preparation for a flight to safety, or a fight; and sweating increases as a
cooling mechanism.
In a modern context, there is usually no physical resolution to this stress.
Moreover, at the moment when the mind and body scream for simple things such
as oxygen and water, modern managers inappropriately respond with
cigarettes, which decrease the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, or
immoderate alcohol, which can depress lucidity, raise blood pressure and
force the body to lose precious water.
A personal strategy for coping with stress should include:
Broadening your definition of success to include self-preservation. This
first step, already adopted by younger managers on the rise, is taken not
just for your own career but also for your family and friends. Do not
exchange precious years of your life, your marriage or your health for a
perceived need for professional control. Ask yourself of every stressful
situation: 'Is it really worth getting sick for?'
Listening carefully to your body and mind. Start to decipher individual
signs and symptoms, not as something to escape or anaesthetise, but as
valuable warning of a potentially serious underlying problem. Watch for high
blood pressure, chronic fatigue, nervous eating or drinking, sleeplessness,
peptic ulcers, tension headaches, obesity and depression.
Managing your time intelligently. Start by living in the real world and
planning accordingly. Plan breaks into your daily agenda - even five minutes
to take a breath of fresh air and re-evaluate - and make daily checklists.
Finish what you have on your plate before loading more on.
Planning some physical exercise in your daily life. Walk for 10 minutes
after lunch and dinner. This will help periodically to decompress an
otherwise chronically compressed cardiovascular system. If you need a
structured exercise programme, consider joining a health club near your
office.
Not making your reaction to stress more dangerous to your life than the
stress itself. There are healthy ways to detach yourself from the stresses
that threaten your quality of life: for example, talking things over with
your spouse, a health professional or a member of the clergy, deep breathing
and yoga, meditation and prayer, going to see a film, humour, massage,
delegating, taking a holiday, engaging in physical activity, decreasing the
use of coffee and alcohol or going fishing.

   VACAVILLE, Calif. -- It's not easy teaching transcendental
meditation in prison. During the first group meditation at
the prison here last year, instructor Kofi Kondwani told the
inmates to close their eyes. The 60 prisoners eyed each other
suspiciously -- and refused. Mr. Kondwani finally got them to
close their eyes by promising that the other two teachers
would keep their eyes open for any trouble.
   Things went smoothly for a while. Then, in a later
session, Mr. Kondwani said someone decided to burn some
incense. That set off a fire alarm. Fifty guards rushed into
the room on full riot alert.

   But the prisoners here say it's all worthwhile. As Paul
Brar, 36, who's serving a life term for murder, says: "It
puts your brain at ease, man."
   TM is the mind-opening technique introduced to the West
about 30 years ago by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, a former Hindu
monk and onetime guru to the Beatles. It has been taught by
volunteers here and in prisons in such states as Indiana,
Vermont and Massachusetts since at least 1975. Now, Maharishi
has instructed his followers to try to spread TM throughout
the entire prison system in the U.S., which is swollen with
about 800,000 inmates.
   Since December, TM followers have submitted proposals to
prison officials in California, Iowa, Texas and Arizona. The
proposed cost of TM training: $1,500 per inmate, which
Maharishi says is a small price to pay. "Prisons are very
concentrated stress areas. The only way to create a
crime-free society is to disallow stress to be formed," he
says from his European headquarters in Vlodrop, Netherlands.
"Then their logic will always be nourishing."
   Indeed, Mr. Brar and some other inmates say they have
found happiness -- nirvana, in fact -- by reaching deep
within themselves in the dreary confines of their own cells.
Twice each day for about 20 minutes a session, they sit in
their cells, intoning a secret mantra to escape the reality
of prison life. They spend the remainder of the day, they
say, shielded from stress and anxiety. "Without TM,
everything is bumpy. With TM, everything is smooth," says
murderer Roy Folsom, 31.
   Even so, TM will be a tough sell. Texas says it will
consider the proposal, but a prison spokesman adds, "We're on
a tight budget." Arizona rejected the idea. "The biggest
problem was that it was not cheap," says corrections
spokesman Michael Arra. "And it was also unproven, as far as
we're concerned, in a corrections environment." Even the
warden here, Eddie Ylst, says that while he is "fully
supportive of inmates' self-help programs," he needs to spend
his scarce resources on things like food and clothing.
   Small thinking, says the Maharishi. "People should have
happy lives, and when the walls are no barrier they will rise
to a higher state of consciousness," he says. "Everyone lives
in a room, but no one is closed up in a room. This
transcendental meditation immediately injects a feeling of
unbounded awareness." Besides, he says, it's cost-effective.
He says the outlay would be more than offset by savings from
reduced recidivism. "I can guarantee that {a prisoner} will
not commit another crime so long as he uses TM," he says.
   When asked if even Charles Manson could be rehabilitated,
Maharishi responds with a vigorous yes. "Within two or three
days, his face will change," he says.
   Oh, sure, says Vincent Bugliosi, who prosecuted Mr.
Manson. "I think he's beyond redemption," says Mr. Bugliosi,
now an author and private attorney in Los Angeles. "No, I
wouldn't want to see him out," with or without meditation. In
fact, skeptics of Maharishi's program say it's outlandish to
suggest that simple meditation will cure the underlying
social and psychological problems that drive many crimes.
While nearly all the experts concede that TM is useful for
alleviating stress and anxiety, they say it's no more than a
relaxation tool. "It's a nice thought, but it's not the
ultimate solution," says John Blamphin, spokesman for the
American Psychiatric Association.
   Dennis McFarland, a 13-year TM practitioner, is proof of
that. A 47-year-old convicted drug dealer serving 10 years in
prison at San Luis Obispo, he says he "backslid" into drug
abuse between stints in prison despite his twice-daily
meditation. Mr. McFarland had been released from a five-year
sentence in about 1985, only to be returned a year and a half
later for a second drug conviction. "I'm a . . . three-time
convicted felon with a long history of hypochondria,
compulsive gambling and drug addiction with related
problems," he points out.
   But he expects to be paroled in about a year, and he says:
"I am very optimistic that I will make it this time."
   Maharishi's followers cite more than 500 scientific
studies as proof of the rehabilitative benefits of TM, but
they were mostly conducted by TM devotees whose objectivity
is questioned.
   Some prison officials are leery of what they call TM's
cultish overtones. Robert Dickover, chief of research for the
California Department of Corrections, says he would not
recommend that his system pay for the TM program because of
"garbage like the notion of the mantra and genuflecting" to
Maharishi. Mr. Arra says Arizona officials received many
angry calls about the TM proposal from citizens who believed
TM was a religious program.
   Maharishi's devotees, who refer to Maharishi as "His
Holiness," say this is no cult. Charles N. Alexander, a
Harvard-educated researcher at Maharishi International
University in Fairfield, Iowa, says the mention of TM
invariably raises eyebrows because it's different and
unusual. But he says TM is better than nothing for the
overcrowded, tense U.S. prisons. "When you're in a system
that's not working, then you have to look at innovation," Mr.
Alexander says. In at least one prison, even yoga classes
have been conducted.
   A thin, gaunt man named George Ellis introduced TM to
California's tough Folsom State Prison in 1975. Mr. Ellis was
teaching psychology in the prison and hardened criminals
marveled at his poise and relaxation in their midst. "I
thought he had some kind of wonder drug. I said, `Give me
some,'" says Patrick Corum, a murderer who was paroled in
1986. "That was my first introduction to TM."
   Mr. Ellis, now 41 and a Miami businessman, had taught the
meditation technique extensively on the outside, but recalls
feeling some apprehension doing so to prison inmates. "I
didn't know it at the time, but one man I was teaching had
killed five people," Mr. Ellis says. "When we were sitting
together, he said to me, `I could kill you now.' I said,
`Well, why don't we meditate and see how you feel
afterwards?' He meditated, opened his eyes and said, `Well,
you're still in the room, so I guess you're all right.'"
   As word of TM spread, more and more inmates began signing
up for classes. The program was administered both at Folsom
and San Quentin prisons, and last year it was started here on
a trial basis. Mr. Brar, the murderer, says each of the 29
inmates currently in the program sets aside times of the day
to silently intone a sound that was given them by their TM
teacher. In his case, Mr. Brar says he hangs a sign outside
his cell that says "Do not disturb: Meditating." Then he sits
on his bunk meditating quietly early in the morning and again
during late afternoon.
   Mr. Folsom, the convicted killer, says he experienced an
almost immediate transformation. He says he began penning
children's stories and felt at ease for the first time in his
confinement. "It works -- there's no ifs, ands or buts," Mr.
Folsom says.
   But it's not a perfect setting. Sid Landau, 51, a burglar,
says he tried meditating in his cell here, but was too
distracted by jail-house noise.
   Others swear by it. John E. Glidewell, 49, served 17 years
on a drug conviction, but he's been out for 11 years now and
is a sculptor living in seaside Arroyo Grande, Calif. "I
started doing TM in 1979 and this is the only reason I'm
still out," Mr. Glidewell says. "As soon as you meditate,
it's like a line is drawn inside of you and you know what
side you want to be on."
   Maharishi says that's the point. If every prisoner in the
U.S. were signed up for the TM program, it would mean more
than just $1 billion in revenue for Maharishi. "It would be
heaven on earth," he says.
