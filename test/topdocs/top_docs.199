<HL> Plastic Money Takes On a New Meaning As Australia Introduces a 3-D Currency </HL>

   If Australian inventors have their way, the world's currencies will never be the same. 

   Their prototype of future money is a revolutionary plastic bank note that sports a three-dimensional hologram. 
Holograms have been used on credit cards for several years to foil forgers. 
But Australian monetary authorities believe they are the first to incorporate such a device on a bank note. 
They hope it will put counterfeiters out of business. 

   The first batch of the new bills, in denominations of 10 Australian dollars ($7.17), came out in late January as part of Australia's bicentennial celebrations. 
The matte finish makes the notes feel like conventional paper money, but they don't fold as easily. 
Plans call for the plastic money to replace all 10-dollar notes this year. 

   Providing the new notes stand the initial test of public handling, Australia intends within three years to replace all its currency with the plastic-hologram notes. 
Like most countries, Australian notes are currently printed on cotton-fiber paper. 

   Moreover, the Reserve Bank, Australia's central bank, hopes to benefit by selling the technology to other countries that print their own money and to companies that print legal tender. 
"We're talking multimillion-dollar export potential," says Bob Pearson, deputy general manager of the Reserve Bank's note-printing branch. 

   Some bank-note printers are skeptical of plastic notes because previous experiments have foundered. 
Du Pont Co. of the U.S. tried to tap the bank-note market in the early 1980s with Tyvek, a plastic used in surgical gowns and other products. 

   Haiti, Costa Rica and the Isle of Man issued Tyvek notes, but a Du Pont official says Haiti and Costa Rica withdrew most of them because the ink tended to rub off. 
The notes fared better on the less-humid Isle of Man, he says. 
Consequently, Du Pont has "temporarily withdrawn" from the bank-note market, says Richard Ludwig, a Du Pont product-development manager in Wilmington, Del. 

   The U.S. considered, and rejected, the use of holograms, primarily because of cost, says a spokesman for the U.S. Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing in Washington. 
"Also, holograms wouldn't necessarily stand the rigors of circulation," he says, adding that the holograms tend to lose their special qualities when the bills are creased. 

   While the Reserve Bank's Mr. Pearson and others won't divulge much about their own technology, they say they have mastered the printing problem by employing, among other things, a modified ink. 
But they have had other headaches. 
Publicity about the note's indestructibility provoked some people to try to prove the inventors wrong and triggered a new round of laboratory testing, Reserve Bank officials say. 

   The 10-dollar note depicts an aborigine on one side and a montage of the settlement of Australia on the other. 
An upper corner bears the holographic image, stamped on a clear-plastic background, of Capt. James Cook, the British explorer who claimed much of the east coast of Australia for Britain in 1770. 

   Unlike in a typical hologram, his image is visible on both sides of the note. 
Different angles produce rainbow patterns, and developers say such an image is harder to counterfeit than a conventional hologram. 

   The clear plastic background of Capt. Cook's portrait also is designed to thwart counterfeiters who use the latest laser-scanner photocopiers. 
The clear plastic areas come out black on photocopies. 

   Holders of about two or three dozen of the initial run of 350,000 10-dollar notes complained to the Reserve Bank that the Cook portrait vanished. 
But examination of the allegedly faulty notes showed evidence of "vigorous rubbing" and "willful damage," a Reserve Bank spokesman says. 
One complainer turned in a note that he said had shriveled when left in the sun on a car dashboard. 
The bank did its own dashboard test and proved it couldn't have happened. 
They suspect the man laid the note on a hot radiator. 

   It is against Australian law to deliberately deface bank notes, but authorities aren't taking action against anyone who presents a damaged note, even if they suspect foul play. 
They don't want to scare away legitimate complaints that might help overcome real flaws. 

   Meanwhile, developers have come up with coatings for the hologram that they hope will stop even the most determined defacers from "taking the smile off Capt. Cook's face," Mr. Pearson says. 
The plastic-based notes, he contends, will stand up to "normal wear and tear." 
They cost slightly more than conventional notes to make but should last 10% to 20% longer. 

   For now, the new 10-dollar notes are in short supply. 
An industrial dispute at the bank's printing facility in Victoria halted production after the initial runs. 
The dispute is resolved, and more notes should be in circulation by the end of the month. 

   Mr. Pearson hopes the next run of notes will be treated less like a curiosity to be scratched and mutilated, and more "for what it is, a damn good bank note."

<HL> Du Pont Will Start Pay-Incentive Plan For All Fibers Business Workers in '89 </HL>
<AUTHOR> Laurie Hays (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> DD LABOR </CO>
<IN> CHM </IN>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont Co. will introduce next year a novel pay-incentive plan for every employee in its $6 billion fibers business that's designed to help sustain the unit's healthy profit levels. 

   The plan, which ties pay increases to profit increases, represents Du Pont's most drastic step to date toward shedding its image as a cumbersome, benign employer and becoming a slim, aggressive competitor in the chemical industry. 
Du Pont also is one of the first companies of such size and stature to consider this kind of comprehensive pay plan during profitable times. 

   Pay incentives for managers have become common in many companies in recent years, but compensation experts say Du Pont's approach of applying such incentives to lower level supervisors and rank-and-file workers is still far from commonplace. 
Moreover, while the automobile and steel industries have adopted comprehensive incentive plans as cost-cutting measures, Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont said its plan is different because it doesn't seek wage cuts. 

   Du Pont's concept is to tie the salaries of all 20,000 employees in the fibers business, from group vice president to hourly workers, to the unit's profitability. It will work like this:
   After a phase-in period of five years, fibers employees will be paid base salaries that are 6% lower than their counterparts in the rest of Du Pont receive. 
The fibers workers will recoup the 6% difference only if the unit meets 100% of its profit goals. 

   The employees don't collect any of the 6% difference if the fibers group makes less than 80% of its profit goals. 
At the 80% level, employees get a 3% pay raise. 
If the unit reaches 150% of its goal, employees receive a bonus that makes their salary 12% higher than their counterpart's. 

   The purpose of this plan, Du Pont officials said, is to reinforce its new "team spirit" and to make employees feel that they have a stake in how the business fares. 

   "I'm looking for people to want to have more ownership in the business," said James F. Kearns, Du Pont's group vice president, fibers. 
Added Steven E. Gross, general manager of Hay Associates and an architect of the plan, "There's a whole change in how people view employees. 
They're asking people to work harder, and now they're asking them to share the fruits of their labor." 

   An advantage to such an approach is flexibility. 
Management can avoid big increases in fixed costs while doing more to reward performance. 
Robert C. Gore, a Philadelphia-based vice president and compensation consultant for Towers Perrin Co.'s TPF&amp;C unit, notes that many corporate managers have felt constrained in the 1980s by small merit-raise budgets. 
"They're uncomfortable giving many employees zero so they can give a few people 12% raises," he said. 

   At Du Pont, extra pay earned for a year will take the form of one-time bonuses paid in February of the next year, not permanent increases in base salaries. 
Fibers employees' base pay will move in lock step with those of other Du Pont workers as they continue to receive annual company raises. 
Those raises, however, will represent only 94% of what others receive to maintain the 6% difference. 

   In salary terms, a manager earning $94,000 at the end of the phase-in period has a counterpart in another part of the company earning $100,000. 
The fibers manager will receive $100,000 only if the unit makes 100% of its projected profit goal. 
He'll make only $94,000 if profits come in at less than 80%. 
He stands to make $112,000, however, if 150% of the goal is met. 

   For Du Pont, the plan means a payroll savings of $36 million a year if less than 80% of the profit goal is met. 
It also means a payout of $72 million in new cash bonuses if profits reach 150%. 

   News of the plan immediately generated some criticism from union officials representing about 6,000 of the fibers unit's hourly employees. 
The officials said they consider the plan unfair if workers don't have any voice in setting the profit goals and the mechanics of the plan. 

   They also think it's unfair to tie salaries to profits when the level of profits may have nothing to do with individual performance. 
Profits, for example, could sink in a general economic recession. 

   "How about job guarantees if the workers are going to put their pay at risk?" asked Kenneth Henley, an attorney for the union. 

   Towers Perrin's Mr. Gore warned of other potential dangers in such plans. 
"Effective communication with employees is absolutely essential," he said. 
"The employees have to trust the numbers, they have to believe this isn't really an illusory reward or a pay cut in disguise. 
Otherwise the ship is sunk before it leaves the harbor." 

   Du Pont said such criticisms are legitimate concerns, but noted that workers will benefit from good times that also have nothing to do with performance. 
In addition, Mr. Gross, the Hay consultant, said even low-ranking employees can make a big difference in the profitability of an operation, by seeking ways to reduce material waste, for example, or by saving money on repairs to equipment. 

   "We want people to think of more than just their own little job. 
This provides direct reinforcement," Mr. Gross said. 

   Du Pont said it will propose the plan to the union and bargain on it. 
If the union rejects it, the plan will procede without choice for the operation's remaining 14,000 non-union employees, and union workers will be exempted. 

   The fibers division is one of Du Pont's most profitable businesses, generating after-tax operating profit last year of $624 million on sales of $5.3 billion. 
Sales are expected to reach $6 billion this year with an after-tax operating profit goal of $626 million. 

   Du Pont had total profit of $1.78 billion, or $7.39 a share, last year on sales of $30.5 billion. 

   Excluding inflation, Mr. Kearns said he expects 4% average annual profit growth for the fibers business in the next five to 10 years. 
Goals will be set accordingly, he said. 
The unit has about doubled its profit margin since 1983 by markedly reducing the number of employees (to 20,000 from 27,000) and by increasing productivity. 
Profits have also been boosted recently by the success of products like Stainmaster carpet and fibers like Kevlar, Nomex and Tyvek. 

   Mr. Kearns acknowledged that the fibers operation is considered a mature business and one that is vulnerable to a general economic recession if one should occur. 
He said, however, that he expects to maintain growth by increasing production capacity for current products and by introducing new uses for those products. 

   He said his division developed the pay-incentive plan with Hay and requested that it be implemented. 
He doubts it will be used eventually by the entire Du Pont company, though it may serve as a model for other operations considering similar possibilities.

   Du Pont, in Cost-Cutting Move, to Trim
   Thousands of Jobs, Take Big Write-Off

   Du Pont Co., seeking to boost profits at its sluggish core
businesses, plans to cut at least $1 billion in fixed costs,
including several thousand jobs, by the end of next year.
   The cost-cutting will require a fourth-quarter charge of
about $350 million, or 50 cents a share, said Edgar S.
Woolard Jr., Du Pont chairman and chief executive officer. In
last year's fourth quarter, Wilmington, Del., Du Pont
reported net income of $468 million, or 69 cents a share.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Mr. Woolard wouldn't disclose the number of jobs that will
be eliminated in the company's chemical, fiber and plastic
businesses, saying only that "there will be a substantial
reduction in the number of our employees" through early
retirement and dismissals. Mr. Woolard said he doesn't
anticipate any plant closings or asset sales as part of the
cost-reduction plan.
   Weakness at Du Pont's major U.S. customers, including the
auto, textile, rubber and computer industries, has depressed
results at Du Pont's chemical and specialty-products units.
Du Pont isn't the only chemical company whose results have
been hurt.
   Investors applauded the cost-cutting move, which analysts
say should widen Du Pont's profit margins as the economy
starts recovering later this year or next year. Du Pont's
stock was quoted at $48.125, up $1.375, in heavy New York
Stock Exchange trading yesterday.
   Securities analysts estimated that at least 10,000 jobs
will be cut, many of them at the company's Wilmington
headquarters. Du Pont has about 143,000 employees world-wide,
including about 26,000 in Delaware. The company's Conoco
petroleum division, which went through a stiff cost-cutting
process in the late 1980s, when oil prices slumped, is
largely going to escape from the cost-cutting.
   Paul Leming, a securities analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp;
Co. in New York, said Du Pont is focusing on total cost
savings, not on an employee head count, as the most effective
way to trim its bloated costs. "They're not going to let
managers play games and do things like hire people back as
consultants," Mr. Leming noted.
   The company said that in addition to eliminating jobs
through a combination of early-retirement incentives and
dismissals, it's spurring managers to look at cutting
redundant computer systems, consulting and contracting costs,
and travel and entertainment expenses.
   Analysts estimated that Du Pont could save about $1 a
share annually from the planned cost-cutting. But William
Young, an analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
Securities Corp. in New York, predicted that the savings
would be closer to 75 cents a share, because a portion is
likely to be passed on to customers in the form of lower
prices.
   Sluggish demand accounted for much of the 21% drop in Du
Pont's second-quarter earnings released earlier in the week,
when Du Pont posted profit of $549 million, or 81 cents a
share, compared with $694 million, or $1.02 a share, a year
earlier.
   Du Pont's U.S. sales of chemicals and specialty products
grew less than 1% a year during the 1980s, and the company's
profit margin dropped from 8% to 7%, Mr. Woolard said. Growth
overseas for Du Pont during the same period was nearly twice
as strong, he added.
   Mr. Woolard said that the productivity of Du Pont's
overseas divisions is higher than in the U.S. in part from
the higher growth rates of the European and Japanese auto and
electronics industries.
   Du Pont isn't the only chemical company suffering from
slack customer demand and overcapacity in certain core
chemical and plastics businesses. Earlier this month,
Monsanto Co., St. Louis, reported a second-quarter charge of
$325 million, or $2.54 a share, to cover restructuring and
cost-cutting expenses.
   Moreover, Quantum Chemical Corp. yesterday reported a
second-quarter loss of $87.1 million, or $3.01 a share,
compared with profit of $7.1 million, or 27 cents a share, a
year earlier. Sales fell slightly to $582.5 million from $586
million. The New York-based company said the loss included
write-offs of $53.4 million, mainly from the closing of an
ethylene cracking unit and shrinking petrochemical profit
margins.

   Quality of Du Pont's Revisionist Management
   Draws Raves From Wide Range of Analysts

<LP>
   NEW YORK -- How's this for a rare bird: A U.S. industrial
giant's stock is being recommended because of the quality of
its management, of all things.
   Wall Street chemical analysts are stretching their
metaphors to the limit to praise the new leadership at Du
Pont, where Chairman Edgar S. Woolard Jr. took control little
more than a year ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "You're seeing the same kind of change in the management
at Du Pont that you've seen in the Kremlin," Paul Leming, an
analyst at Morgan Stanley, says. "You've literally seen a
generational shift from an old guard to the new guard." He
also notes that Du Pont's board has been slimmed to 23
members from more than 30, sharply reducing directors'
average age in the process.
   For the first time, Mr. Leming says, Du Pont has a
management system where "in underperforming businesses,
they're taking managers out and shooting them. You don't have
lifetime job security anymore."
   As an example, Mr. Leming points to Du Pont's decision,
announced last January, to cut 900 jobs from its polymer
products department, as part of an effort to trim costs in
that unit by $100 million a year. The cutbacks followed a
management shake-up in the polymer unit late last year.
   Even analysts who have a neutral stance on Du Pont's
shares are impressed by the new approach at Du Pont
headquarters in Wilmington, Del. "The management is working
hard to change the culture and the cost structure," Leslie
Ravitz, a chemical analyst at Salomon Brothers, says. He
notes that Du Pont has closed an operation that made acrylic
fiber, which the company well nigh invented.
   In addition, the analysts note that Du Pont's management,
while continuing a huge capital spending program, has been
more aggressive in raising the company's dividend and buying
back stock. Du Pont raised its dividend 10.5% in January 1989
and an additional 14% in October 1989.
   To some analysts, Du Pont seems undervalued, compared with
other big industrial companies. George Krug of Oppenheimer,
who put the stock on his firm's recommended list in May, says
Du Pont shares are selling at about 10 times his estimate of
the company's 1990 earnings, a multiple that is about 40%
less than the earnings multiple for stocks in the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 index.
   Mr. Krug also says Du Pont should benefit from an expected
drop in commodity chemical prices over the next few years.
Though Du Pont produces some commodity chemicals, Mr. Krug
argues that the company is, on balance, a buyer of commodity
chemicals, which it uses to produce other chemicals with
fatter profit margins.
   Despite the raves for Du Pont management, Mr. Ravitz of
Salomon and Paul Christopherson, chemical analyst at Bear
Stearns, point to a series of uncertainties that could keep
Du Pont's earnings from growing rapidly in the next year or
so.
   With more than $35 billion in annual sales, Du Pont is a
huge company exposed to vagaries in many sectors of the
economy. As a big supplier of basic chemicals for paints and
coatings, and a big producer of carpet fibers, Du Pont has
been hurt by slowdowns in auto and home sales. As the owner
of Conoco, a major oil producer and refiner, Du Pont is
affected by oil price swings. And though the company's
medical products unit is expected to revive from a $25
million loss last year (on revenue of about $1.5 billion), it
remains a weak spot.
   At yesterday's closing price of 37 1/8, Mr. Christopherson
says, Du Pont is "probably at the low end of the range" of
fair valuation, "but it's not enough to make it a buy with
us."
   Mr. Ravitz, who is estimating that Du Pont will earn $3.50
a share this year and $3.75 a share next year, believes its
earnings won't really take off until 1992 or 1993, because
the company now is in the midst of a major capital spending
program. Du Pont, which had capital outlays of $5.09 billion
last year, is projecting $5.2 billion of spending this year.
   Among the spending programs are two that will expand Du
Pont's production of two mainstay fibers: nylon and Lycra.
Over the next decade, Du Pont will spend $1 billion to expand
nylon production in Asia alone.
   But the real snap for Du Pont earnings could come from
Lycra, a fiber that got its start in women's underwear, moved
into swimsuits, and now is widely used in pantyhose and
exercise clothes. Du Pont is betting between $400 million and
$600 million that more designers will weave Lycra into
dresses, suits and skirts, even after the spandex minidress
fades from the scene.

   Akzo N.V. said it won a round in its bitter and long-running dispute with Du Pont Co. over Kevlar, a steel-like fiber made by the Wilmington, Del.-based chemical and energy concern. 

   Akzo, a Dutch chemical company, said a judge in Britain ruled Monday that Du Pont has been violating Akzo's patent in Britain on a key solvent used in manufacturing Akzo's similar aramid fiber. 
The court said it will outline next month the measures that it will take against Du Pont; such measures could include an import ban, according to Akzo. 

   John E. Falon, director of Du Pont's industrial products division, said: "We are surprised by the court's ruling and will be reviewing it." 
The decision won't affect Du Pont's plans to begin production of Kevlar this summer at its plant currently being built in Northern Ireland, Mr. Falon said. 
Du Pont exports Kevlar to Britain. 

   Aramid fibers are synthetic materials that are five times stronger than steel and have growing industrial applications, especially in the automotive, aerospace and construction materials sectors. 
Du Pont and Akzo are the world's primary manufacturers of aramid fibers.

   Du Pont Co. and Akzo N.V. have called a truce to their bitter and costly 10-year patent dispute over steel-like aramid fibers, respectively known as Kevlar and Twaron. 

   Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont and Akzo, a Dutch chemical concern, agreed to an out-of-court settlement that will permit both companies to manufacture and distribute the fibers world-wide. 
Suits pending in 20 different courts in the U.S. and overseas will be terminated, Du Pont said. 

   Du Pont officials said they consider the agreement "an attractive alternative" to litigation because it removes uncertainty in the market. 
The legal tangles were causing customer confusion and anxieties over continuity of supply, said John Fallon, director of Du Pont's industrial products division. 

   Mr. Fallon said he expects the truce to expand demand for the fibers and doesn't anticipate the resulting increased competition from Akzo to cut into Du Pont's markets. 
Du Pont has annual Kevlar sales of about $300 million, mostly in the U.S. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Du Pont's stock closed at $83.25, up 50 cents. 

   Aramid fibers, the family of synthetic materials that include Kevlar and Twaron, are five times stronger than steel and have growing industrial applications in automotive, aerospace and construction materials sectors. 
Kevlar is used in bullet-resistant vests and army helmets. 
Du Pont and Akzo are the world's primary manufacturers of aramid fibers. 

   The International Trade Commission has restricted Akzo from selling Twaron in the U.S. until 1990. 
Under the agreement with Du Pont, Akzo will be able to export to the U.S. but will continue to have some restrictions on the shipments, Du Pont said. 

   Du Pont began the legal battle in 1979 by suing Akzo in the United Kingdom for patent infringement. 
Earlier this year, a judge in Britain ruled that Du Pont had been violating Akzo's patent in Britain on a key solvent used in manufacturing Twaron. 
Du Pont plans to begin production of Kevlar this summer at a plant under construction in Northern Ireland.

   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co. said it will get out of
the acrylic fiber business after 40 years of supplying the
fiber to makers of sweaters, socks and other products.
   Du Pont, which sold the fiber under the Orlon trade name,
said it had been losing money on the business in recent years
because of imports and the loss of customers to polyester and
cotton. "Each market, for its own set of reasons, has been
under attack," said Paul G. Gillease, director of Du Pont's
textile division.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   He said annual sales of Orlon were about $200 million. In
1989, total fiber sales by Du Pont, including those of nylon,
were $5.97 billion.
   Mr. Gillease said Du Pont will withdraw from the acrylic
fiber business as soon as possible to concentrate on its
other apparel fabrics, Dacron polyester and Lycra spandex. He
said the company will probably be able to offer other jobs to
a majority of the 775 people currently employed in the Orlon
business. Du Pont makes Orlon along with other fabrics at
plants in Camden, S.C., and Waynesboro, Va.
   The exit by Du Pont should give a boost to other acrylic
fiber makers, who have been operating amid excess production
capacity. Monsanto Co., which counts itself the largest U.S.
producer, said there is more than enough domestic capacity to
absorb the closing of Du Pont's production lines.

   Forty years after it introduced Orlon to
the world of sweaters, socks and knit outerwear, Du Pont Co.
announced Monday it will stop production of the acrylic fiber as
soon as possible.
   The fiber has been overproduced worldwide and consumers now
prefer cotton and polyester fabrics, said Paul G. Gillease,
director of Du Pont's textile division.
   ``As a result, the business has not been sufficiently profitable
in recent years,'' Gillease said.
   Byron J. McCutchen, the company's Orlon business manager, said
that for the past several years, Orlon sales have been about $200
million annually.
   Du Pont plans to focus production on its Lycra spandex fiber,
used in clothing such as swimming suits and leotards; nylon; and
its Dacron polyester.
   Gillease said those fibers ``present significant growth
opportunities (and) will be more beneficial to the long-term
interests of Du Pont and its customers and will strengthen our
position in the U.S. apparel market.''
   Orlon is produced at Du Pont plants in Camden, S.C., and
Waynesboro, Va. There are about 725 employees divided between the
two plants.
   J.J. Pryor, a company spokeswoman, said Du Pont will try to
absorb the workers into other operations.
   She said about 50 Orlon marketing and business employees are
spread among company headquarters in Wilmington, New York and
Charlotte, N.C.
   McCutchen said the phase-out will not affect the Beaumont,
Texas, plant where acrylonitrile is produced. Acrylonitrile is the
raw material used to make Orlon. McCutchen said the raw material
will be sold to other companies.

   GENEVA -- A common thread runs through European designer
Karl Lagerfeld's fall fashions: Lycra. He uses the elastic
fiber in everything from flowing formals to body-hugging
sportswear. "Europeans are mad about Lycra," says U.S.
designer Norma Kamali.
   That's great news for Du Pont Co., the fiber's inventor.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Lycra symbolizes what Du Pont is striving to become in
Europe in the 1990s: flexible, high-tech -- and very
profitable. With Lycra leading the way, the Wilmington, Del.,
chemical producer is applying its technological savvy --
gained by spending $1.4 billion a year on research -- to
European markets where it can command top dollar for its
products.
   The strategy means emphasizing products with a clear
technological edge while scaling back on commodity-type
chemicals, even when it means closing whole operations.
   So far, the approach has helped the company succeed in a
market where some major rivals and other big U.S. companies
are floundering. Du Pont's European division, including the
Conoco petroleum operations, is expected to contribute more
than 40%, or about $1.1 billion, of Du Pont's estimated $2.55
billion in operating profit this year. That's nearly twice
the European operation's contribution to operating profit
just four years ago. Du Pont's European sales during the same
period have surged more than 50%, even though a stronger
dollar recently and weak European economies have slowed
growth somewhat.
   Europe holds a growing allure for multinational companies.
When most European Community trade barriers fall by the end
of next year, the largest single market in the industrialized
world will be up for grabs. Without a significant European
operation, corporations risk being global also-rans by the
turn of the century.
   "We've done well so far, but we have to have a much
stronger presence in Europe to be a great global company,"
says David Williamson, Du Pont Europe president.
   The company operates a network of 45 European plants and
has begun an ambitious expansion program. In northern Spain,
a $200 million factory to make flame-retardant Nomex fibers
is under construction, part of a planned $1 billion expansion
project in that country. Near Dunkirk, France, an
agricultural chemicals plant is being built.
   Besides Lycra and Nomex, other products Du Pont is pushing
include extra-strong Kevlar synthetic fibers used for
bullet-proofing, Arylon polymers for auto interiors, and
chemicals used to purify water and make paint pigments. In
addition, fewer of Du Pont's low-margin commodity chemicals
that have been a recent drag on U.S. earnings are being made
in Europe. During the past decade, Dupont has closed or
trimmed production of such basic products as Orlon synthetic
fiber and certain commodity chemicals in Europe.
   The economies of scale that Du Pont wrings from its
factory network helps it keep costs low and profit margins
high. Its facilities and marketing strategies also serve all
of Europe, not just France, Germany or Britain. Many other
U.S. corporate giants, including leading auto and computer
companies, are still revamping country-by-country production
and distribution channels in preparation for a unified
European market.
   What Du Pont has done with Lycra offers a glimpse of its
European strategy. The elastic fiber has grown from a modest
start 30 years ago as a rubber substitute in women's girdles
to become the company's largest product world-wide. While Du
Pont doesn't break out financial results by product, industry
analysts estimate that worldwide operating income from Lycra
this year will reach $250 million, or 10% of the company's
total estimated operating income, on sales of $900 million.
   Indeed, Du Pont's fibers division, where Lycra sales
account for most of the profits, was the sole bright spot in
the company's third-quarter earnings. While Du Pont's net
income and sales were each down 5% for the quarter, after-tax
operating profit from fibers more than doubled to $150
million from $72 million a year earlier.
   To capitalize on Europe's fashion trendsetting position,
all Lycra production and sales are managed from Du Pont's
European headquarters here. Du Pont has successfully promoted
the fiber for a variety of applications beyond the lucrative
activewear market that boomed during the fitness craze of the
1980s.
   Ms. Kamali, the New York designer, lately has been
incorporating the fiber into a host of materials, including
cotton T-shirts and what she calls "stretch velvet." Designer
Donna Karan mixes Lycra with wool in men's jackets.
   The fiber also is used extensively in women's hosiery. And
Du Pont scientists hit the jackpot a few years ago when they
developed a version of Lycra used instead of rubber along the
edges of disposable diapers. One-in-four disposable diapers
now use Lycra.
   Since the original Lycra patent lapsed long ago,
look-alike spandex fibers are being marketed by several
European and Asian competitors, such as Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC of Britain. But they aren't making much of a
dent in sales of Lycra, which command a 60%-plus share of the
world market.
   Another product giving Du Pont an edge in Europe is a
hollow polyester fiber called Quallofil, used in mattresses
and bedding material. A fire-retardant version gained
popularity after a number of fatal hotel fires in Britain a
few years ago forced Parliament to adopt legislation
mandating fire-resistant mattresses.
   Du Pont's European researchers also have developed a
firmer version of polyester fiberballs, called Comforel, that
mimic the feel of goose down. French furniture maker Pierre
Roset is using the material to stuff cushions in his fall
line of furniture.
   Du Pont's European operations haven't been error-free. Two
years ago the company paid more than $600 million for two
British photo printing companies and so far has little to
show for its investment. Analysts claim the company erred in
purchasing businesses not tied closely to its core operations
and in underestimating the time and money required to turn
the operations around. In the third quarter, the imaging
companies cost Du Pont an additional $16 million in
restructuring charges.
   Du Pont also has had trouble converting promising research
in drugs into commercial products in the U.S. and Europe. To
compensate for a lack of marketing muscle in drugs, the
company in January formed a joint venture with giant Merck &amp;
Co. to produce and market drugs. The venture is expected to
be only modestly profitable this year.
   Du Pont's success with Lycra, though, should help it buy
time to remedy its strategic shortcomings. "Lycra," asserts
designer Calvin Klein, "isn't in or out of fashion, it's a
way of life."

   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co. disclosed plans to build a
$100 million chlorofluorocarbon-substitutes facility in
Texas.
   The plant, which will be the world's largest making such
products, represents a vote of confidence by the chemical
company in the new product line.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, are widely used as
refrigerants. But growing scientific evidence has suggested
the compounds damage the earth's protective ozone layer. An
international agreement calls for CFCs to be phased out by
the year 2000, and chemical companies have been developing
alternative products to meet that deadline.
   Du Pont introduced its family of CFC substitutes, with the
trade name Suva, earlier this year; the new products have
one-fiftieth or less of the ozone-depleting potential of
Freon, the CFC-based coolant Du Pont makes for a range of
cooling products.
   Du Pont said the plant, which will make the alternative
refrigerants HCFC-124 and HFC-134a, will open in 1993 in
Corpus Christi at the site of a smaller Suva plant. The
company also has a Suva plant currently under construction in
Japan, and a fourth is planned to open in the Netherlands in
1994.
   Earlier this summer, a research consortium of Du Pont and
other chemical makers reported potentially troubling research
results, which showed that lab animals exposed to a CFC
replacement known as HCFC-123 developed nonmalignant tumors.
The Texas plant, however, won't be making that line, which is
aimed at a specialized market for large "chiller" systems.
   Du Pont said its CFC-substitute development expenditures
will total $1 billion by the end of the decade.

   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co.'s huge fibers division
showed "some improvement in April" sales, but the U.S.
recession is still depressing results in other units, said
Edgar Woolard, chairman and chief executive officer.
   Mr. Woolard said the fibers division, which accounted for
$6 billion of the company's $40 billion in sales last year,
is "sometimes a leading indicator" for the rest of Du Pont.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As for a sales recovery at other divisions, "we don't see
it anywhere else" yet within the company, he said. While he
and other Du Pont executives said they believe the recession
in the U.S. has bottomed out, Mr. Woolard added, "there are
no multiple signs that the recession is over," based on sales
results from Du Pont's different units.
   Theodore Semegran, a securities analyst with Shearson
Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York, said he recommended Du Pont
stock for purchase earlier this month, partly on the strength
in the fibers division. He said that Du Pont's April
shipments, including exports, of nylon and polyester yarn and
staple to industrial users were 15% to 20% higher than in
March in many cases, although most segments still lagged
year-ago levels.
   Mr. Woolard said it is still too early to project how Du
Pont will fare financially in the current quarter, adding
that it is company policy not to comment on specific earnings
projections. Noting that in the first quarter the company
nearly matched year-earlier earnings per share, reporting 88
cents a share compared with 90 cents a share in 1990's first
quarter, he added, "we don't see a major short fall" this
year compared with last year.
   He said the company's mix of businesses, including
chemicals, fibers, plastics, petroleum, coal and a grab bag
of diversified businesses, plus its strong presence in
Europe, where most economies are stronger than in the U.S.,
"will allow us to have a decent year."
   In March, Du Pont agreed to sell a 50% stake in its
Consolidation Coal Co. subsidiary to the German coal company
Rheinbraun A.G., a unit of RWE A.G. Terms weren't disclosed,
but analysts have estimated the sale price at $1 billion to
$1.25 billion. The sale is expected to be completed by year
end.
   Some Wall Street analysts estimate the company will earn
roughly 80 cents to 90 cents a share for the current quarter,
compared with $1.02 a year ago. Of 18 securities analysts
following the company, the mean earnings estimate for 1991 is
$3.06 a share, and $3.55 a share for 1992, compared with
$3.40 a share last year, according to Zacks Investment
Research. The estimates don't include any anticipated gain
from the sale of the coal interest.
   Mr. Woolard said the company expects the economy to begin
rebounding sometime this year, "but we don't expect a robust
recovery."
   Du Pont's fibers unit incorporates mature, high volume
businesses such as nylon and Dacron polyester, which are
closely linked to the U.S. economy with heavy sales to the
textile and housing markets. Faster growing specialty
products range from Lycra spandex to flame retardant Nomex
and Kevlar, a high strength fiber used in tires, bullet-proof
vests and U.S. Army infantry helmets.
   Another bright spot, albeit a relatively small one in Du
Pont's constellation of multibillion businesses, is its joint
venture in pharmaceuticals with Merck &amp; Co. The joint venture
posts about $700 million in annual sales and will be
"modestly" profitable in its first full year of business, Mr.
Woolard said. Pharmaceuticals had been losing about $50
million a year in recent years when operating as a Du Pont
unit, he said.
   The company decided it needed to link up with drug giant
Merck in pharmaceuticals in order to have the resources and
expertise to be a global player in what is expected to be a
rapidly growing market, he said.
   Mr. Woolard noted that while Du Pont's chemical and
plastics businesses were benefiting from declining raw
material prices during the recession, the prices Du Pont has
been able to charge for its finished products also are coming
down.
   Du Pont's petroleum business, acquired 10 years ago when
the company bought Conoco, is benefiting from continued
strength in refining margins, despite the slowdown in the
U.S. economy, Mr. Woolard said. The petroleum business,
buoyed by the jump in oil prices last year following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, accounted for $16 billion out of the
company's $40 billion in 1990 sales, and $1.1 billion out of
$2.3 billion in net income.

<HEAD>Du Pont's Fibers Employees Get Bonus Payout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THERESA HUMPHREY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DOVER, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees in Du Pont Co.'s fibers department
will receive bonuses equal to 3 percent of their 1988 salaries next
week in the first fruit of an experimental pay plan, an executive
said Friday.
   When the plan takes full effect next year, a portion of
employees' pay raises will be tied to the department's
profitability. The Wilmington, Del.-based chemical giant has touted
the plan as a way to increase profitability by giving employees a
stake in the business.
   The 20,000-employee fibers department makes products such as
nylon, Dacron, Lycra, Orlon, Kevlar and Antron.
   Next week's bonuses are considered an incentive because the
program is not fully in operation and no portion of employees'
salaries was actually at risk.
   Next year if the department performs poorly they could lose the
entire amount they put at risk.
   ``We announced to employees in early February that our
performance in 1988 was such that we would have a 3 percent payout.
Checks will be distributed Monday and Tuesday,'' said Robert McNutt,
who led the team that developed the plan.
   If the department meets 80 percent of its 1989 earnings goal,
employees will receive half of their pay that was at risk. If the
goal is met, employees will receive all of the ``at risk'' money.
Employees could receive three times the amount at risk if earnings
goals are exceeded by 50 percent.
   For 1988, the department overshot its goal for after-tax
operating income of $626 million by about 12.5 percent, resulting in
the 3 percent payout, according to McNutt.
   The bonuses are ``an incentive for the people participating in
the program. It's a way of saying thanks for the job that we did
together as a team in 1988 and so it's a bonus as we move toward
variable pay for 1989,'' McNutt said.
   It is expected to take three to five years to fully phase in the
plan until the employee has a maximum amount of money at risk equal
to 6 percent of what their pay would have been if they had received
all scheduled raises.
   Employees who do not receive a raise this year will not have pay
at risk and thus will not be eligible for bonuses.
   During the phase-in period, each employee will always receive at
least 1 percent of any raise, regardless of the fibers business
performance.
   McNutt noted, however, that late last year about 10,000 employees
voluntarily put 2 percent of salary ``at risk'' for this year.
   The plan was mandatory for all department employees except
unionized workers. About 2,000 production workers at the Spruance
plant in Richmond, Va., voted against the plan, McNutt said, while
the others voted to be in. The department has about 6,000 to 7,000
union workers at plants in Delaware, Tennessee and Virginia.
   Du Pont said if the plan works, it could become a model for the
whole company.

   Du Pont Co. said it is moving "aggressively" to phase out production of chemicals thought to be depleting the earth's ozone layer, and plans to complete the process by the year 2000. 

   Du Pont created a big stir when it announced the phase-out in March, but it didn't make public its timetable for accomplishing the goal. 
Now the Wilmington, Del.-based chemical and energy concern says it will commercialize alternatives to the widely used chemicals, chlorofluorocarbons, starting in 1990. 
Du Pont plans to start its first commercial-scale manufacturing facility for two of the substitutes as early as this fall. 

   Replacing the chemicals, also known as CFCs, is considered a big job, because the world is dependent on them for a wide variety of uses, including plastic foam, cleaning agents and refrigerants. 
While a number of countries have agreed to reduce production, Du Pont's plans for a complete phase-out caught the industry and environmentalists by surprise. 
Du Pont is the world's largest producer of CFCs and markets them under the trade name Freon. 
Pennwalt Corp., the third-largest producer, is the only other concern to have followed Du Pont's call for a complete phase-out. 
Pennwalt, however, hasn't announced a timetable. 
Allied-Signal Inc., the second-largest producer, said yesterday it is seeking substitutes. 

   Joseph P. Glas, director of Du Pont's Freon division, said he is "disappointed" more producers "haven't come on board" with phase-out plans. 
Du Pont, he said, has decided to move more aggressively than it initially planned in order to fulfill its promise of an orderly phase-out and to allay concerns about societal disruptions from shortages of products. 

   Richard Barnett, chairman of the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy, which represents producers and users of CFCs, said he hopes Du Pont's customers can change processes quickly enough to keep up with the scheduled phase-out. 

   Stephen O. Anderson, an ozone specialist with the Environmental Protection Agency, said Du Pont's plans "reflect optimism for alternatives. 
It adds to confidence that alternatives are available." 

   Du Pont said it will spend more than $30 million this year, twice the previously announced amount, on process development, market research, applications testing and small-lot production of alternatives. 
An even larger sum will be spent next year, according to Mr. Glas. 

   The first commercial production startup is for two blowing agents used in a variety of insulation and cushioning applications. 
Du Pont will convert an existing manufacturing facility in Montague, Mich., to make "multimillions" of pounds of the alternatives, known as HCFC-141b and HCFC-142b. 

   Hitches in Du Pont's schedule for the total phase-out could develop if customers can't convert equipment and products to match the new materials, or if some of the products don't meet toxicity guidelines, said Mr. Glas. 
He estimated that customers will need about five years for conversion, and said the company is working with those customers. 
He added that toxicity testing is underway. 

   The new products are considered less than 5% as harmful to the ozone layer as CFCs, Du Pont said. 
CFCs are considered dangerous because it is thought that they are eating away the earth's protective shield that screens out harmful ultraviolet rays. 
The rays cause health and environmental problems.

   Five former Du Pont Co. employees
threatened to sell secret documents on synthetic fibers to a
competitor or begin production themselves if the chemical giant
didn't pay them $10 million, authorities said.
   Four of the five were arrested on extortion charges Monday in
Switzerland in a hotel parking lot after they failed to meet with Du
Pont officials and an undercover FBI agent where an exchange was to
take place, said FBI agent Joseph V. Corless.
   Du Pont had planned to turn over a bogus $10 million check for
the documents, which deal with the production of Lycra, the
company's trade name for spandex fiber used in clothing such as
swimming suits, leotards and pantyhose.
   The suspects also were to sign a contract agreeing not to produce
spandex fiber for five years, Corless said.
   The five had worked at the Du Pont plant in Mercedes, Argentina,
one of several plants that make spandex. Du Pont was contacted about
the documents in December. Four of the five had quit since
September, authorities said.
   Those arrested were Bruno Skerianz, age unknown; Raul A.
Giordano, 36, operations supervisor for Lycra production; Antonio R.
Inigo, 39, maintenance supervisor for Lycra production; and Maria I.
Lorenzo de Bianchini, 39, secretary of the Lycra information office,
authorities said.
   Corless said Ms. de Bianchini had the most access to the
documents.
   Skerianz, who worked at the plant about 20 years ago, was
believed to be the ringleader and recruited the others while they
were working for Du Pont. The others had been Du Pont employees for
13 or 14 years.
   A warrant was issued for Jose M. Petrosino, 44, specialist
engineer for Lycra processing, who remained at large.
   William Carpenter, an assistant U.S. attorney, said the five have
been charged with one count each of attempted extortion and if
convicted, face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   There are being held by Swiss authorities, and the United States
will seek extradition, Corless said.
   Corless said the documents were recovered, but he admitted there
were no guarantees that copies had not been made.
   ``Considering Du Pont was willing to pay, we hope there are no
more copies,'' he said. ``We still have a lot of investigating to
do.''
   John R. Malloy, Du Pont spokesman at its Wilmington headquarters,
said, ``The information was very valuable and probably would have
enabled them to set up a competing plant.''
   After the suspects contacted Du Pont, several meetings were held
inside and outside the United States, and telephone calls were made
to discuss the documents, Corless said. Skerianz met with Du Pont
officials in Wilmington and offered to sell the company certain
spandex technology, the FBI said.
   Corless said that Skerianz refused to bring the documents to the
United States, but Du Pont officials examined the approximately
1,000 documents at a meeting in Milan, Italy, in January.

   Du Pont Co., which has spent several years slimming down, streamlining operations and sharpening its marketing efforts, expects to begin a sustained period of improved profitability. 

   "We've done a lot of work shaping Du Pont into a modern corporation," said Richard E. Heckert, chairman and chief executive officer. 
"Now it's time for the good results to begin to flow." 

   Mr. Heckert said 1987 profit should be "somewhat better" than last year's net income of $1.5 billion, or $6.35 a share, barring an unforeseen change in the economy. 
Such variables as the price of oil, international trade balances and the profitability of the automotive industry make a more precise prediction difficult, he said. 

   The chemicals and energy giant expects most of its growth to be "internally generated" through research and development, rather than through acquisitions. 
This year, the company plans to match 1986 spending of $1.1 billion on such research. 

   Du Pont went on an acquisition binge last year, spending about $1 billion for companies and businesses, the most it has spent in a single year since it bought Conoco Inc. in 1981 for $6.8 billion. 
Last year's targets included the U.S. agricultural-chemicals business of Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co., Ford Motor Co.'s automotive-paint operations and Baxter Travenol Laboratories Inc.'s American Critical Care unit. 
All three will contribute to Du Pont's 1987 earnings. 

   In contrast, the acquisition pace this year should be "less busy," Mr. Heckert said in an interview. 
But he noted that Du Pont "doesn't feel constrained from making a major acquisition" whenever conditions are right. 
John J. Quindlen, chief financial officer, said the company's core businesses are generating a "discretionary" cash flow of $4.5 billion a year. 

   Du Pont "might make a major play" in the pharmaceuticals area, but it isn't in any hurry to do so, Mr. Heckert said. 
"Du Pont doesn't need diversification for its own sake." 
Neither does it want to buy "somebody else's unique contribution that's already fully priced." 
For example, he indicated that Du Pont wouldn't be interested in acquiring A.H. Robins Co., the health-products maker that has been in bankruptcy-law proceedings since August 1985. 

   Du Pont's core businesses of textile fibers, polymer products and chemicals will be big contributors to 1987 earnings and are "throwing off cash" to support smaller, faster-growing segments. 

   The fibers segment, which earned $542 million last year, has been experiencing annual productivity gains of 7%. 
Response has been strong to a new line of stain-resistant carpet material and Kevlar, a steel-like fiber used in such items as clothing, bulletproof vests and helmets. 
Polymer products, which contributed $266 million to 1986 profit, is "having a renaissance" by branching out into thermoplastics, Mr. Heckert said. 

   Du Pont's biomedical-products segment is still evolving. 
Mr. Heckert said he hopes it will have a "major impact" on earnings by 1990. 
In the meantime, he said, "it's not a drain." 
He added, "We'll just take our time." 
Much of the emphasis is likely to remain on diagnostic products and medical services, but Du Pont researchers also are developing blood-processing systems and drugs. 
"When we find the right formula for pharmaceuticals, we'll go at it," Mr. Heckert said. 

   In recent years, Du Pont has trimmed its work force about 20%, to 141,000 employees from 175,000. 
No more big cutbacks are planned, but the streamlining has become a constant at Du Pont. 

   "We have less bureaucracy, the paperflow is shrinking and we will continue to become more efficient," Mr. Heckert said. 
Though he said he is eager for Du Pont to get "back in the growth mode" through joint ventures, selective internal expansion and some acquisitions, "I'm not anxious to see us in a fattening mode." 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Du Pont shares closed at $109, up $1.

   Du Pont Profit Fell
   16% in Quarter;

   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co. said first-quarter
earnings declined 16% because of softness in the U.S.
automotive and housing markets, and one-time restructuring
charges.
   Net income fell to $615 million, or 90 cents a share, from
$736 million, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier. The latest
period included restructuring charges of seven cents a share,
while the year-earlier quarter included a gain of five cents
a share. Sales increased 8.4% to $9.40 billion from $8.67
billion.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Analysts said Du Pont's performance was slightly better
than the 85 cents a share they had been expecting. Some
analysts raised their 1990 earnings estimates to a range of
$3.40 to $3.70 a share, from $3.30 to $3.50 a share.
   Profit declines in the quarter for polymers, fibers and
energy were less than predicted, and there were some early
benefits from cost-cutting. But higher raw material and
energy costs, and weather-related outages, caused industrial
products earnings to be worse than expected.
   Edgar S. Woolard Jr., chairman and chief executive, said
Du Pont began to see "signs of strengthening" in March as a
result of cost-cutting programs. "We believe we will extend
our four-year trend of steady earnings improvement and
achieve our stated goal of maintaining or exceeding 16%
return on equity through a business cycle," Mr. Woolard said.
   The company said combined sales for industrial products,
fibers, polymers and diversified businesses increased 3%,
reflecting a 4% increase in selling prices and a 1% decrease
in unit sales.
   Analyst Leonard Bogner of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
said polymers were the main reason for Du Pont's
better-than-expected first quarter. After-tax profits for
polymers were $109 million, excluding one-time charges of $27
million for the planned closing of two automotive finish
plants, compared with $131 million a year ago.
   "Most people may have been looking for $50 million to $80
million from polymers," Mr. Bogner said. Fibers profits of
$168 million, compared with $173 million a year ago, were
helped by growth in specialty fibers, such as Kevlar, Lycra
and Nomex.
   "Du Pont will look better than other major chemical
companies this year due to cost-cutting and less reliance on
traditional plastics and commodity chemicals," Mr. Bogner
says. He said he raised his 1990 estimate to $3.70 a share,
from $3.50.
   However, Leslie Ravitz of Salomon Brothers says the first
quarter was "no great surprise" and he won't change his $3.50
estimate for 1990. Despite encouraging business trends, "we
think the economy will slow down during the second half due
to higher interest rates," Mr. Ravitz said.

   Du Pont Co. third-quarter net income rose 32% as its fibers, chemicals and coal businesses performed better than expected. 

   Net increased to $452 million, or $1.87 a share, from $343 million, or $1.42 a share, in the year-ago period. 
Results included $31 million, or 13 cents a share, from the sale of businesses in 1987, and $21 million, or nine cents a share, from nonrecurring items in 1986. 

   Sales for the quarter grew 19% to $7.59 billion from $6.39 billion a year ago. 

   Richard E. Heckert, chairman, said the strong results show the benefit of steps the Wilmington, Del.-based chemical and energy concern has taken recently to increase productivity. 

   He also said, "The overall demand for the company's products remains strong and we look ahead to the balance of the year with confidence." 

   John J. Quindlen, senior vice president for finance, said Du Pont has "started off the fourth quarter with no reason to believe it won't be as good as we thought." 
He added, however, that it "may be too early to judge if there's any impact" from the stock market's swings. 
If there is, Du Pont won't feel it for about another 30 days, he said. 

   Some analysts who had forecast earnings of between $1.70 to $1.75 a share for the third quarter increased their year-end forecasts. 
Leonard Bogner, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities, said he expects Du Pont to earn $7.25 a share for 1987, compared with his early projection of $7.05 a share. 
In 1986, Du Pont earned $6.35 a share. 

   "At least through the end of September, business was going gangbusters," he said. 

   Mr. Bogner said he will watch Du Pont's fourth-quarter results closely for signs of an economic slowdown, which may have been forewarned by last week's stock market crash. 
For example, if retailers cut orders for fibers products, which are sold to the carpet, housing and automobile industries, "we're in for tough economic sledding," he said. 

   But in the third quarter, fibers profit increased 15% to $154 million from $134 million in the year-ago quarter, while sales increased 9% to $1.29 billion from $1.18 billion. 

   Agricultural and industrial chemical profit nearly doubled to $131 million from $68 million in the year-ago period. 
The 1987 figures included a gain of $31 million from the sale of a chlorine and caustic soda production facility. 
Sales grew 19% to $929 million from $783 million a year ago. 

   Profit from the coal business more than doubled to $51 million from $23 million the previous year as sales increased 26% to $456 million from $363 million. 

   Caught in a severe market decline yesterday, Du Pont closed at $81.25 a share, down $6.75, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

   Du Pont Co. posted a 5.4% drop in third-quarter net income
because of weak economies in the U.S. and Europe and a sharp
drop in profit from its Conoco oil unit's continuing
operations.
   The results, in line with Wall Street expectations,
included one bright spot in an otherwise recession-dimmed
earnings report. Du Pont said that operating profit from its
synthetic fibers division, dominated by sales of elastic
Lycra spandex, more than doubled to $150 million from $72
million a year earlier.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Wilmington, Del., chemical company's net fell to $504
million, or 75 cents a share, from $533 million, or 79 cents
a share, a year ago. Excluding non-recurring items in each
period, per-share profit fell 17% to 60 cents from 72 cents.
Sales slid 5.1% to $9.43 billion from $9.93 billion.
   Separately, Quantum Chemical Co. posted a sharply wider
third-quarter loss of $38.1 million, or $1.33 a share,
resulting mainly from a steep drop in price for polyethylene
plastic, its major product. In last year's third quarter, New
York-based Quantum had a loss of $1.4 million, or five cents
a share. Sales fell 7.9% to $573 million from $621.9 million.
   Du Pont Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Edgar S.
Woolard Jr. said, "We expected the economic recovery to gain
momentum in the second half of the year, but except for
improved demand for {synthetic} fibers, that has not yet
happened." Du Pont said it remains optimistic that the U.S.
economy will rebound next year.
   Bruce Beardwood, a Du Pont spokesman, said that the Conoco
unit was hurt by a roughly $5-a-barrel plunge in the price of
crude oil from last year's third quarter, when Iraq's
occupation of Kuwait roiled oil markets. Excluding one-time
gains in each period, Du Pont's petroleum income fell 38% to
$175 million from $280 million a year ago. Du Pont's interest
income was also boosted by a big one-time gain from tax
refunds at Conoco.

<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An affidavit filed in a case stemming
from a $10 million attempted extortion of the Du Pont Co. shows
stolen documents detailed company secrets for its spandex fiber.
   In the affidavit filed in U.S. District Court, FBI Special Agent
Charles Flagg said the documents ranged from ``blueprints for the
construction of the Du Pont Lycra manufacturing plants'' to the
company's specific process for manufacturing the spandex fiber,
``including mixtures, formulas, pressures, operating temperatures,
plant maintenance and all necessary related technology.''
   In the affidavit, Salim M. Ibrahim of Geneva, Switzerland, who
directs Du Pont's worldwide Lycra business and helped develop the
spandex fiber process, told Flagg, ``a knowledgeable individual or
chemical company would be in a position to duplicate the Lycra
manufacturing process'' if they had access to the documents.
   Lycra is primarily used in swimming suits, sportswear and
stockings.
   Four former employees at the Du Pont Lycra manufacturing plant in
Mercedes, Argentina, were arrested Feb. 28 in Geneva after an
aborted meeting at which they were to pick up the $10 million in
exchange for more than 1,000 documents stolen from the plant.
   A fifth suspect, also a former employee, remained at large
Tuesday.
   All are charged with attempted extortion and conspiracy to
extort, according to Assistant U.S. Attorney Edmond Falgowski.
   If the suspects fight extradition, it could take up to two months
to have them returned to the United States, Falgowski said, adding,
if they waive extradition, they could be in Delaware in about a week.
   The affidavit alleges Isaac Assa, a Mexican citizen who
manufactures spandex in Mexico City, hired Bruno Skerianz, who in
turn enticed three employees of the Argentina plant to work for him.
   Skerianz, who worked for Du Pont 20 years ago, was among the
Argentine nationals arrested last week.
   Raul Armando Giordano, 36, former superintendent of Lycra
operations, and Antonio Ruben Inigo, 39, former maintenance
supervisor of Lycra production at the plant, were allegedly
recruited by Skerianz and arrested last month.
   Maria Ines Lorenzo de Bianchini, 39, former custodian of the
technical records at the plant with access to the documents, was
also arrested. The affidavit says she was drawn into the scheme by
Inigo, who allegedly was her lover.
   Jose Maria Peterosino, 44, a former engineer on the Lycra
production line, remains at large. He too, was allegedly recruited
by Skerianz.
   The affidavit says Assa's first contact with Du Pont came in a
meeting Nov. 10 and a second meeting the following day at company
headquarters in Wilmington with Ibrahim and Paul G. Gillease, who
directs Du Pont's textile fibers division.
   Assa told them he had hired Skerianz to gather technical
information about spandex to make his company more competitive and
that Skerianz had Du Pont secrets. Assa said Skerianz was
negotiating to sell the information to the Italian fiber maker
Ridici, the affidavit says.
   Skerianz met in December in Wilmington with Ibrahim and Gillease,
demanding $10 million for the documents and promising the former
employees would not open a competing spandex operation for five
years, the affidavit says.
   Skerianz met again with Ibrahim and Gillease in Wilmington on
Jan. 9. The Du Pont executives were accompanied by an undercover FBI
agent, the affidavit says.
   After examining the documents Jan. 27 in Milan, Italy, Gillease
called Skerianz to agree to the $10 million payment.

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $5 million plant to recycle plastics now
mostly buried in landfills will open here in the spring in a joint
venture between Du Pont Co. and Waste Management of North America
Inc.
   Known as the Plastic Recycling Alliance, the 50-50 venture would
demonstrate, first, the companies' commitment to recycling and,
second, that household plastics collected at curbside can have a
new life, officials of the two firms said Tuesday.
   They said they plan to build the concept into an environmentally
safe, nationwide trash disposal network.
   Nicholas Pappas, Du Pont executive vice president, and Waste
Management President William Hulligan said the 70-employee plant is
the first that completes the recycling loop _ from picking up trash
to turning it into new products like baseball gloves, park benches
and home siding.
   ``Our plant is a very clean process,'' Pappas said. ``It doesn't
affect the environment at all.''
   Other firms operate similar plastic recovery plants, notably in
South Carolina and New Jersey, but none is involved in trash
collection.
   If the plant succeeds as expected _ handling up to 40 million
pounds of residential-generated plastic annually the first few
years _ another facility will open later next year in the Midwest
at a site to be selected.
   ``Future recycling facilities will be located in areas where the
joint venture can purchase materials from curbside and deposit
return programs throughout the United States,'' Pappas said, noting
that Waste Management is the largest collector of trash in the
world while Du Pont is one of the largest plastic makers.
   The two executives said the joint venture will have a total
capacity of 200 million pounds from various trash sources by 1994.
   Du Pont is headquartered in Wilmington, Del., and Waste
Management has its base in Oak Brook, Ill.
   Pappas envisioned a minimum of three plants. If enough new
product is produced in what he called an infant industry the
venture might sell to other companies besides Du Pont, which has
been recycling industrial plastics for about a decade.
   ``After the plastic materials are delivered, the venture sorts,
cleans and reduces them to plastic flake, a usable raw material for
processing by Du Pont,'' Pappas said.
   ``Du Pont's requirement for raw materials for use in attractive
new products assures the joint venture of a market and it assures
Du Pont of a steady and reliable source of feedstock,'' Hulligan
said.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode, praising the site selection, said
Philadelphia today spends almost $65 million for solid waste
disposal. A sound trash recycling program for which there is a
market can save the city money, he said.

<TEXT>
   One day five years ago, a Du Pont Co. manager met with the company's biggest shareholders, Seagram Co.'s chairman and co-chairman, Edgar M. and Charles R. Bronfman, to tell them about a new marketing effort. 
The manager presented slides and videos. 
He said he had consulted Harvard Business School professors. 

   His audience didn't seem impressed. 
Instead, the atmosphere grew chilly, he recalls, and the Bronfmans asked, "Why haven't you brought in the greatest marketing people in the world -- us?" 

   Today, Du Pont managers aren't likely to overlook the Bronfmans. 
Once thought of as outsiders who had sneaked into the company through the back door, the Canadian-born distillers now are playing a visible and vigorous role as advisers to the world's largest chemical concern. 

   Du Pont took on the Bronfmans as investors in 1981 in the course of playing white knight (and paying $6.8 billion) to save Conoco Inc. from a takeover by Seagram, a company the Bronfman family controls. 
The Conoco shares Seagram had accumulated were converted into Du Pont stock, and now Seagram has a 22.6% stake in the chemicals giant, valued at some $6.5 billion. 
Inside the company, the Bronfmans are referred to as "the new du Ponts." 

   On the board of directors, Seagram appointees now outnumber du Pont family members. 
They get special briefings that officers once worked up only for the du Ponts. 
A team of Seagram advisers monitors the investment, and Seagram's board even meets once a year at Du Pont's Wilmington, Del., headquarters. 

   A three-bedroom suite at Wilmington's Hotel Du Pont has just been renovated for the Bronfmans. 
At one dinner party, hotel employees scrambled to find TV sets so the Canadian guests could watch the Montreal Expos baseball team, of which Charles Bronfman is the principal owner. 
Edgar Bronfman has been hobnobbing with the horsey set in nearby Chadds Ford, Pa. 

   The Canadians have their say about Du Pont affairs not just at board meetings but also, says Du Pont Chairman Richard Heckert, in "the kind of dialogue that is half social, half business." 
He is quick to insist that the Bronfmans don't dictate policy. 
But their influence is evident. 

   The Bronfmans, for instance, apparently broke Du Pont of its longtime habit of issuing new shares for employee bonus and stock plans. 
The company had found this less bothersome than buying back stock, but when Seagram officials noticed, says William Buxbaum, a former chief financial officer at Du Pont, they phoned him to complain about the dilution. 

   "They got a little bit alarmed," he recalls. 
"But I ran upstairs {to the executive offices}, and we agreed this was a legitimate concern. 
I assured Seagram we would repurchase on the open market." 

   The Bronfmans "don't walk down the hall saying, 'You're hired and you're fired,'" explains Harold Fieldsteel, a former Seagram executive vice president and retired Du Pont director. 
"But they are actively involved." 
On a scale of one to 10, he says, "on major questions, their influence is an eight, nine or 10." 

   The Bronfmans will soon gain even more influence through a new retirement policy for Du Pont directors, adopted last fall but little noticed at the time. 
The policy calls for 10 du Pont family members and retired executives, including former Chairmen Charles B. McCoy, Crawford H. Greenwalt and Irving S. Shapiro, to leave the board by 1989. 
The first six, including Mr. McCoy, retired in May. 

   The resulting shrinkage of the board not only will accommodate the 25% Seagram representation provided by a 1986 standstill agreement but also, in a break with tradition, reduce to about 50% the representation of family members and current or former Du Pont executives. 
"We have to make some room for the new owners," says Irenee du Pont Jr., a director and retired official. 

   Adds Mr. Shapiro, who will leave the board next year, "This is a tacit recognition that the Bronfmans are the main players." 

   But the new ownership and board structure pose some potential problems. 
Some company officials worry that the board's institutional memory will be hurt by the loss of three former chairmen. 
And no matter how comfortable Du Pont's relationship with the Bronfmans is now, the balance remains delicate. 
Fears lurk that a misunderstanding could cause bad feeling and wreck the marriage. 

   Mr. Heckert acknowledges the concern. 
"I now have what I consider to be an excellent ownership structure," the chairman says. 
"You'll forgive me if I tell you I don't want it screwed up." 
As for the Bronfmans, they decline to be interviewed about the relationship. 

   The very existence of such a large block of stock as the Bronfmans' worries some Du Pont people. 
They are nervous about a recent public disagreement between the Bronfman brothers over the succession at Seagram, of which Bronfman family members own more than 38%; speculation about a rift intensified when the Bronfmans decided to dissolve their joint investment holding company, Cemp Investments Ltd. 
Some at Du Pont wonder whether the stake held by Seagram could someday end up in the hands of Bronfman heirs who aren't friendly to management of Du Pont or knowledgeable about its business. 

   "Selling booze and wine isn't the same thing as running a world-wide chemical company," notes one disgruntled Du Pont director, who adds that, in his view, the Bronfman "children aren't demonstrating that they are great businessmen." 

   Ten years ago, the company and the du Pont family dissolved Christiana Securities, the holding company for the family's 28% stake, because of worries about the next generation's lack of involvement with the company or knowledge of its operations. 
With the Bronfmans' indirect stake in Du Pont, contends Mr. Shapiro, "what you've done is create a new Christiana, with all its problems." 

   But for now, the alliance appears to be steady. 
Seagram has been given enough positions on the Du Pont board to make sure the Bronfmans' views are heard, and Du Pont is resting easier because a standstill agreement bars Seagram from acquiring more than a 25% stake in Du Pont until 1999. 
The Bronfmans now "are playing as part of the team," says John L. Weinberg, the chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and a Du Pont director chosen by Seagram. 
"We've become part of the Du Pont management structure." 

   Meanwhile, Seagram's investment in Du Pont is paying off nicely; last year, it yielded $323.2 million of the liquor company's net income of $423.5 million. 

   The transition, however, wasn't smooth. 
When Seagram first gained its interest by buying 27.8 million Conoco shares and exchanging them for 47.4 million Du Pont shares, it was granted only three seats on a 31-member board. 
And Du Pont found itself scrambling to teach the Bronfmans about their new investment, providing them with a week of chemistry classes and a demonstration of how nylon is made. 
They asked so many questions that an officer had to be assigned full time to answer them. 

   Edgar Bronfman also managed to offend some people at Du Pont. 
In 1985 he publicly criticized its then-lagging core business of synthetic fibers (a portion of which has since been sold) and boasted to the press that he had helped pick the company's next chairman, Mr. Heckert. 
The appointment hadn't yet been made public, and his remarks rankled some officials. 
"Edgar has a big mouth," says Harold May, a retired Du Pont executive. 

   Analysts and investors were calling the company frequently those days to ask how much power it was going to give the Bronfmans. 
Du Pont finally agreed to increase Seagram's role on the board to match its investment, in exchange for assurances that the Canadian company wouldn't buy more than 25% of Du Pont's stock. 
"We wanted the standstill extended so people wouldn't think there would be some war," says David Barnes, a Du Pont director and former officer. 

   Some insiders say the Bronfmans have brought greater financial savvy to the board. 
They have come aboard at a time when Du Pont is trying to become less a family-run business and more a company of professional managers. 
In the past five years, it has retired more than 25,000 employees and removed layers of management, while linking salaries and bonuses more closely to performance. 

   "Du Pont has been inbred for a long time," says Anantha Raman, an industry analyst who follows the company closely. 
"They needed outside blood to move into the 20th century." 

   The Bronfmans have become visible allies of Du Pont's drive to sell some lagging traditional businesses and instead focus on acquisitions in life sciences. 
They have devoted many hours to learning about the new fields, according to David D. Mooberry, Du Pont's group vice president of medical products. 
When the company was preparing to buy a drug business called American Critical Care last year, Charles Bronfman questioned Mr. Mooberry closely on the pros and cons. 

   "The company is changing," says Mr. Mooberry. 
"We have a stronger focus on shareholders, and all those kinds of things Mr. Heckert talks about are consistent with what {the Bronfmans} would like to see from a company." 

   Some Du Pont managers say that while the company has been cutting costs and bureaucracy since the Bronfmans' arrival, it has loosened the purse strings in other ways. 
It spent more than $1 billion on acquisitions last year, in agricultural chemicals as well as in the health field. 
Recently, Seagram's director of consumer research visited Wilmington to teach Seagram's methods of pinpointing consumer trends. 

   But Du Pont executives bristle at the suggestion that Seagram has originated ideas or dictated policy changes. 
The Bronfman-Du Pont arrangement is no "master-servant relationship," Mr. Heckert declares. 

   He says that he began long ago trying to improve marketing and increase shareholder value and that Du Pont is shrinking the board not just to give the Canadians a bigger role but also because directors have found it unwieldy. 
"This was a nice confluence of objectives," he says. 
"I want to get away from a show-and-tell kind of board meeting, which is what we've really had in the past, to a participative-type meeting where everyone has a chance to react when they have views on each important issue." 

   Still, Mr. Heckert says the Bronfmans have been "constructive participants" in such areas as direct marketing to consumers and corporate financing. 
"Those are areas where we're particularly inclined to check with them when we're wanting to do something, to make sure their view of life is similar to ours," the Du Pont chairman says. 
"They are just good business people broadly, and I think we have benefited from their inputs."

   Many Big Chemical Concerns Expected
   To Post Sharp 2nd-Quarter Profit Drops

   Many big chemical companies, plagued by an oversupply of
commodity chemicals and plastics and slack demand, are
expected to report sharp earnings declines in the second
quarter.
   While there are indications that demand picked up over the
past several weeks for some companies, industry earnings
aren't expected to improve significantly until sometime next
year.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "The second quarter didn't show any signs of life, but
we're close to the bottom of the cycle and should start
recovering by year end," says John Roberts, a securities
analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York. Chemical
companies speak frequently with Wall Street analysts but
don't comment on earnings projections before the release of
quarterly figures.
   Hardest-hit are the major producers of building block
chemicals and plastics, such as ethylene, styrene and
polyethylene. Strong demand and limited capacity in the late
1980s led to several major commodity plants being built over
the past few years. But the plants recently began adding to
the world's supply of these products just as demand from
developed countries around the world began slowing down.
   Dow Chemical Co. remains the flagship commodity chemical
company in the minds of most investors and analysts, even
though it has been lessening its reliance on the commodity
chemical business for the past decade. Most analysts polled
expect the Midland, Mich., chemical maker to report per-share
earnings of 70 cents to 90 cents a share, compared with $1.34
a year ago.
   "Plunging ethylene and styrene prices are killing Dow,"
says Paul Leming, an analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New
York.
   Dow is fighting back against falling prices, having
announced a four-cent-a-pound increase for certain grades of
polyethylene effective Aug. 1, notes William Young, an
analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. in
New York. But the effort may be a holding action at best, he
says. "They'll be lucky if they can keep the price from
falling further" from current levels of nearly 30 cents a
pound, he adds.
   Union Carbide Corp. has also been hit hard by falling
commodity chemical prices. Analysts expect the Danbury,
Conn., company to report second-quarter per-share earnings of
between 30 cents and 40 cents, compared with 81 cents a year
earlier.
   Du Pont Co., the nation's largest chemical company, relies
much less on commodity chemicals for profits than do Dow and
Union Carbide. But other major business lines at the
Wilmington, Del., company, such as fibers and plastics sales
to the auto and housing industries, have also been suffering.
And quarterly profits from its huge Conoco petroleum
subsidiary also were less than expected, some analysts say.
   Du Pont is expected to report 75 cents to 85 cents a share
for the second quarter, compared with $1.02 a share a year
earlier.
   Operating profit from Du Pont's polymer, or plastics,
division, fell 47% to $70 million in the quarter from $133
million a year ago, estimates Anantha Raman, head of a
research firm bearing his name in Parsippany, N.J. The
company's fibers division sustained a 36% decline in
operating profit, to $100 million from $157 million, and
chemical operating profit plunged 41% to $80 million from
$135 million, Mr. Raman estimates.
   He estimates that the Conoco unit's operating profit from
petroleum products jumped 40% to $232 million from $166
million.
   But Merrill Lynch's Mr. Roberts is less sanguine about
Conoco's performance. This week he cut his second-quarter
estimate for Du Pont to 75 cents a share from 85 cents,
mainly on the belief that refining margins were
"disappointing relative to what people thought they would
be."
   Similar concerns led Mr. Roberts to lower his estimates
for Lyondell Petrochemical Co., Houston, to 75 cents a share
from 85 cents a share, compared with $1.93 a year earlier.
And he cut his second-quarter estimate for Houston-based Arco
Chemical Co. to 40 cents a share from 60 cents a share,
compared with $1.06 a share a year earlier.
   Most analysts had until recently been expecting Monsanto
Co., St. Louis, to report second-quarter per-share profit
fell to $1.65 to $1.80 a share from $1.90 a year earlier.
   But on June 28, Monsanto announced that it was taking a
restructuring charge of $325 million, or $2.54 a share, in an
attempt to make its chemical division more profitable. The
restructuring involves cutting 2,500 employees, or 6% of the
company's 41,000-member work force, and closing several small
plants.
   The fact that Monsanto's stock hardly budged after
announcing the hit to earnings that will leave it with a loss
for the quarter indicates that investors are looking beyond
the latest quarter's results, in expectation of a recovery
beginning by year end or early next year, analysts said.
   American Cyanamid Co. is the healthiest major chemical
company, and may pleasantly surprise Wall Street with
stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings, predicts Mr.
Roberts. The Wayne, N.J., company is evolving into a medical
concern, with less of its business relying on chemical
products monitored and well understood by chemical analysts,
he said. The company's agricultural chemical business is also
rebounding well compared with last year, and it recently has
been buying back its own stock.
   Analysts estimate American Cyanamid will report
second-quarter profit of $1.30 to $1.40 a share, compared
with $1.16 a share a year ago.

<HL> Technology: Du Pont Co. to Sell Gene-Spliced Mice For Cancer Studies </HL>
<AUTHOR> Laurie Hays (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR>
<SO> </SO>
<CO> DD </CO>
<IN> PHA </IN>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont Co. said it plans to begin marketing genetically engineered mice with a high susceptibility to cancer. 

   The mice, developed by scientists at Harvard University, will be sold starting next year to researchers in nonprofit academic and government laboratories who are studying the causes of and treatments for cancer. 
Longer range, Du Pont said it sees a "significant" market for the mice in sales to pharmaceutical and chemical concerns that want to screen potentially carcinogenic products. 

   Du Pont, based in Wilmington, Del., is a major sponsor of the research that led to the development of the so-called transgenic mouse. 
The company owns exclusive rights to the technology. 
According to the U.S. Patent Office, the mouse is the first genetically altered animal to be sold commercially. 
The only patent for such animals issued by the office is for the Harvard-Du Pont invention, though 30 other applications are currently pending, said a spokesman for the office. 

   Du Pont declined to predict the size of the eventual market for the mice. 
Each animal will sell for less than $50, about the same price as other specially bred mice, a spokesman said. 
Du Pont will take orders for the mice, but they will be produced by a commercial breeder, he said. 

   The advantage of the mice is that they are predisposed to get cancer as a result of the implantation of cancer genes during the embryonic stage of development. 
The mice can be used to test whether small amounts of substances are carcinogenic or whether new cancer treatments are effective. 
Scientists believe they will be helpful in leading to better cancer diagnosis, therapy and prevention. 

   The mice generated considerable controversy earlier this year when they were patented. 
Critics fear broad consequences stemming from abuses of such genetic engineering. 
They are particularly concerned, for example, about current research to develop mice that carry the AIDS virus. 
The fear is that such mice could escape from the laboratories and spread the virus. 

   Du Pont and others, however, have defended the technology as providing an important tool for research. 
Until now, such mice have been available only to researchers who could develop them in their own laboratories. 
The Du Pont mice will be offered first to academic researchers because they have the greatest need for the animals, Du Pont said.

<HEAD>Du Pont Agrees To Build $1 Billion Complex In Spain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont and the Spanish government are to
invest $1 billion over the next 12 years to build a high-tech
industrial complex in the northern region of Asturias under an
agreement signed Thursday.
   Industry Minister Claudio Aranzadi said Spain agreed to put up
$300 million, not counting an undisclosed sum by the Asturian
regional government, to win the complex, which is to employ 1,000
people in the hard-pressed region by 2001.
   Du Pont Chairman Edgar S. Woolard, Jr. said the complex, to be
inaugurated in 1993 with a $200 billion Nomex fiber plant, would
produce a range of chemicals, fibers and polymer products for the
fast-growing European market.
   ``We will bring some of our highest-technology, most specialized
products into this site with the objective of supplying the entire
European market,'' said Woolard, who signed the agreement with
Aranzadi.
   He said the project would further Du Pont's goal of doubling its
annual $5 billion European sales of chemicals, plastics and fibers
over the next decade.
   Both Aranzadi and Woolard said they expected the eventual
investment to exceed the agreed-upon $1 billion and added the
presence of Du Pont would act as a magnet for small- and mid-sized
companies making finished products.
   Even without the additional companies, Du Pont Iberica Chairman
German Lastra said, the complex could be expected to indirectly
create an additional 4,000 to 5,000 jobs in the area.
   The site of the complex is in the Tamon Valley, 6 kilometers
(3.7 miles) from the city of Aviles, which is near the Atlantic
Ocean.
   Woolard said it would be at least six months before the company
would decide on the product to follow Nomex, an aramid fiber used
in aerospace and protective clothing now made exclusively at a Du
Pont plant in Richmond, Virginia.
   But he said the company's commitment to the overall project was
firm.
   ``Du Pont would not be opening this site if there were any
possibility that we were going to build Nomex and stop. It would
not be of interest to us,'' Woolard said.
   Construction on the Nomex plant is to begin in August, with
production expected to start at the start of 1993, Woolard said.
The plant is to employ 300 people.
   Du Pont Iberica now concentrates mostly on marketing in Spain
and Portugal, where it employs 300 people and had sales last year
of $200 million, the company said.
   In Europe, Du Pont employs 20,000 people in 14 countries, and
registered $11 billion in sales last year, company officials said.

   Du Pont Co., as part of an expansion plan, said it will increase its annual capacity for sodium cyanide more than 50%, or 100 million pounds, by mid-1989. 
Terms of the investment weren't disclosed. 

   Under the program, Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont will build in Texas City, Texas, a plant with capacity of 60 million pounds a year; construction is expected to begin by June. 
The chemical and energy concern said that it will own and market the product world-wide, and that closely held Sterling Chemicals Inc., Houston, will operate the facility, with initial production targeted for the middle of next year. 

   Sodium cyanide is a leaching agent for precious-metals mining. 
The compound also is used in electroplating and in making drugs, vitamins and insecticides. 

   Du Pont said the expansion program also includes a 35-million-pound capacity increase for sodium cyanide over the next six months at its Memphis, Tenn., plant. 
Du Pont also is building a plant in Mexico, with a capacity of 20 million pounds annually, expected to start up in 1989.

   MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. -- Allied-Signal Inc. charged Du
Pont Co. with "illegally monopolizing" the $80 million U.S.
market for materials used in military and civilian
bullet-resistant vests.
   Allied-Signal, in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court
in Newark, N.J., said that Du Pont unlawfully restrained it
from competing with Du Pont's Kevlar synthetic fiber. It also
accused Du Pont of false advertising, which it said
disparaged Allied-Signal's Spectra fiber and Spectra Shield.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The company said that until it introduced Spectra, Du
Pont's Kevlar fiber was virtually the only fiber used in
police and military vests. Allied says it currently has about
3% of the market.
   In response, Du Pont said Allied-Signal's suit was
"without merit" and that it will "vigorously" contest the
suit. Du Pont is based in Wilmington, Del.

An affidavit filed in a case stemming from a $10-million attempted extortion of 
Du Pont Co. shows stolen documents detailed company secrets for its spandex 
fiber. 
</P>
<P>
In the affidavit filed in U.S. District Court, FBI Special Agent Charles Flagg 
said the documents ranged from "blueprints for the construction of the Du Pont 
Lycra manufacturing plants" to the company's specific process for manufacturing 
the spandex fiber, "including mixtures, formulas, pressures, operating 
temperatures, plant maintenance and all necessary related technology." 
</P>
<P>
In the affidavit, Salim M. Ibrahim of Geneva, who directs Du Pont's worldwide 
Lycra business and helped develop the spandex fiber process, told Flagg, "a 
knowledgeable individual or chemical company would be in a position to 
duplicate the Lycra manufacturing process" if they had access to the documents. 
</P>
<P>
Lycra is primarily used in swimming suits, sportswear and stockings. 
</P>
<P>
Four former employees at the Du Pont Lycra manufacturing plant in Mercedes, 
Argentina, were arrested Feb. 28 in Geneva after an aborted meeting at which 
they were to pick up the $10 million in exchange for more than 1,000 documents 
stolen from the plant. 
</P>
<P>
A fifth suspect, also a former employee, remained at large Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
All are charged with attempted extortion and conspiracy to extort, according to 
Assistant U.S. Atty. Edmond Falgowski. 
</P>
<P>
If the suspects fight extradition, it could take up to two months to have them 
returned to the United States, Falgowski said, adding, if they waive 
extradition, they could be in Delaware in about a week. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit alleges Isaac Assa, a Mexican citizen who manufactures spandex in 
Mexico City, hired Bruno Skerianz, who in turn enticed three employees of the 
Argentina plant to work for him. 
</P>
<P>
Skerianz, who worked for Du Pont 20 years ago, was among the Argentine 
nationals arrested last week. 
</P>
<P>
Raul Armando Giordano, 36, former superintendent of Lycra operations, and 
Antonio Ruben Inigo, 39, former maintenance supervisor of Lycra production at 
the plant, were allegedly recruited by Skerianz and arrested last month. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Ines Lorenzo de Bianchini, 39, former custodian of the technical records 
at the plant with access to the documents, was also arrested. The affidavit 
says she was drawn into the scheme by Inigo, who allegedly was her lover. 
</P>
<P>
Jose Maria Peterosino, 44, a former engineer on the Lycra production line, 
remains at large. He too, was allegedly recruited by Skerianz. 
</P>
<P>
The affidavit says Assa's first contact with Du Pont came in a meeting Nov. 10 
and a second meeting the following day at company headquarters in Wilmington 
with Ibrahim and Paul G. Gillease, who directs Du Pont's textile fibers 
division. 
</P>
<P>
Assa told them he had hired Skerianz to gather technical information about 
spandex to make his company more competitive and that Skerianz had Du Pont 
secrets. Assa said Skerianz was negotiating to sell the information to the 
Italian fiber maker Ridici, the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
Skerianz met in December in Wilmington with Ibrahim and Gillease, demanding $10 
million for the documents and promising the former employees would not open a 
competing spandex operation for five years, the affidavit says. 
</P>
<P>
Skerianz met again with Ibrahim and Gillease in Wilmington on Jan. 9. The Du 
Pont executives were accompanied by an undercover FBI agent, the affidavit 
says. 
</P>
<P>
After examining the documents Jan. 27 in Milan, Italy, Gillease called Skerianz 
to agree to the $10-million payment.

   Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical Co. was cleared by the Food
and Drug Administration to market a drug that simulates the
effect of exercise in heart-stress testing.
   Joseph A. Mollica, president and chief executive officer
of Du Pont Merck, estimated that sales of the drug, called
I.V. Persantine, could reach between $20 million and $30
million a year. The drug will be available in early February.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The drug is the first pharmaceutical alternative to
exercise in stress testing, the company said. Elderly and
disabled patients may be injected with I.V. Persantine as an
alternative to running on a treadmill during a diagnostic
test. The drug simulates the effect of exercise. Doctors
inject thallium as an imaging agent to observe the flow of
blood for a variety of diagnostic tests. As many as a half
million patients can't be tested effectively with current
methods, Du Pont Merck said. More than 1.5 million thallium
studies are performed a year.
   Du Pont Merck, a Wilmington, Del., 50-50 joint venture of
Du Pont Co. and Merck &amp; Co., began operating Jan. 1. The
company has an exclusive license to make and market the
intravenous form of Persantine in the U.S. under an agreement
with a unit of Boehringer Ingelheim International G.m.b.H. of
Germany.
   The announcement follows one late last month by Du Pont
Merck that it received clearance for another product used in
diagnosing heart disease. The product, Cardiolite, is an
injectable chemical tracing agent that can help doctors
diagnose and treat the damage caused by heart attacks without
using invasive procedures. Cardiolite can produce images of
blood flow in the heart when viewed under certain medical
imaging cameras.
   The two products, along with Ethmozine, a treatment for
abnormal heart rhythms, and Coumadin, an anti-coagulant, form
the basis of the company's cardiovascular segment. Du Pont
Pharmaceuticals, the former Du Pont unit that constituted the
Wilmington chemicals giant's contribution to the joint
venture and formed its nucleus, received FDA clearance to
market Ethmozine last June. Merck, Rahway, N.J., contributed
capital, some products and funding for research and
development to the joint venture.
   Another heart product the company is developing has a
mechanism called an angiotensin receptor blocker, which
treats hypertension and congestive heart failure. Mr. Mollica
expects that product to be on the market in the mid-1990s.
The company anticipates approval of a controlled-release form
of Sinemet, which Merck developed to treat Parkinson's
disease.
   Mr. Mollica expects sales for the venture's first year of
operation to be about $700 million, but he wouldn't comment
on whether the venture would be profitable. Du Pont
Pharmaceuticals had estimated 1990 sales of about $550
million. About 70% to 75% of the partnership's sales will
come from Du Pont products and the rest from Merck. He said
the major impact of the venture on its parents' earnings
wouldn't be felt before the mid- to late-1990s.
   "The goal is by the end of the decade . . . to be a
multibillion-dollar multinational company," Mr. Mollica said.
Du Pont Merck will spend about $230 million, or about
one-third of sales, on research and development this year, he
said. The company probably will be doubling its spending on
research and development in the next five years, he added.
   The venture's sales now are about 80% in the U.S. and the
rest international; the goal over the next decade is for
sales to be derived at least 50% overseas, he said.

   Technology:
   Du Pont to Drop
   Products Based
   On Cetus Patent

   EMERYVILLE, Calif. -- Cetus Corp. said Du Pont Co. agreed
to an injunction to stop sales of all its research products
using the patented GeneAmp polymerase chain reaction process.
   Two Cetus patents covering PCR, a process used to amplify
the genetic code, were upheld in a federal court in San
Francisco last month. Du Pont had sought declaratory relief
since 1989 to invalidate Cetus's patents, claiming the
process was anticipated more than a decade earlier by
scientists working at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. The six-member jury at that trial rejected all of
Du Pont's 58 claims to invalidate the patents.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Cetus filed a motion in December seeking injunctive relief
to halt the sale of Du Pont products using the PCR patents.
Cetus said Du Pont agreed to the injunction at a court
conference held late last week.
   PCR acts as a genetic zoom lens to magnify fragments of
the genetic code for use in diagnostic tests and in forensic
analysis of criminal suspects. The PCR process has many
potential applications, and has been described by Cetus
officials as a market "still in its infancy."
   Last month's jury decision was a big victory for Cetus, a
small company fighting to protect its patent and potential
profits from a giant contender. But Du Pont's withdrawal
won't necessarily mean a sales windfall for Cetus. The
biotechnology concern claimed Du Pont's role in the market
was negligible, and thus it didn't anticipate a rapid sales
increase. "It might mean a small increase in business," said
Peter Staple, associate general counsel.
   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Cetus
stock closed at $14.125, up 25 cents a share.
   The court set a June trial for the next phase of
litigation, to determine whether Du Pont willfully infringed
on the Cetus patents, and to set possible damages in the
case.
   Cetus said it hadn't determined if other companies also
were infringing on its patent. "The important thing is that
in the jury trial we vindicated our ownership of the
technology," said Katharine Russell, a company spokeswoman.
As previously reported, Cetus filed another lawsuit against
Du Pont in December, charging infringement of a recently
issued patent relating to methods of performing PCR.
   In Wilmington, Del., a Du Pont spokesman said the company
had voluntarily withdrawn commercial sales of its PCR
products last week. The chemical and natural-resource concern
said cessation of the sales "is not material in a financial
sense." Du Pont attorneys weren't available to discuss what
legal alternatives the company is weighing.

   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co., hit like its competitors
with sluggish markets and excess industry capacity, said
second-quarter earnings dropped 21%, despite a slim increase
in sales.
   But the nation's largest chemical company also said its
big fibers operation is seeing what may be the first
glimmerings of a rebounding economy.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Net income fell to $549 million, or 81 cents a share, from
$694 million, or $1.02 a share, a year earlier. The earnings
downturn, which was in line with analysts' expectations, came
on sales that increased 1.9% to $9.83 billion from $9.65
billion.
   Du Pont's petroleum operations, acquired when the company
acquired Conoco a decade ago, turned in a sharply higher
performance, with operating profit climbing 38% to $229
million on sales that rose 12% to $3.72 billion. The company
cited higher prices for crude and better margins in U.S.
refining.
   But the company's chemical operations, "reflecting general
economic weakness and depressed prices," saw operating profit
tumble 43% to $77 million. The chemical segment's sales
slipped just 1.2%, to $918 million.
   Earnings also fell at the fiber operations, where products
include nylon and Dacron polyester. Because of its sales to
the textile and housing markets, the fiber group's fortunes
are closely tied to the U.S. economy; Du Pont said weak
demand for carpet fibers "more than offset" strengthening
markets for all of its other fiber products. A spokesman said
those upturns in the fiber lines marked for Du Pont the
"first indication of any movement in the economy."
   Coal and polymer operations also showed earnings declines
because of softer markets, the company said. The polymer
operations are particularly aligned with the fortunes of the
automotive and construction markets, which remain depressed.
   In late New York Stock Exchange trading, Du Pont shares
were up 50 cents at $46.75.

   Occidental Petroleum Corp. said it agreed to buy a Du Pont Co. chlorine and caustic soda production facility in Corpus Christi, Texas. 
Terms weren't disclosed. 

   Occidental, a large chlorine and caustic soda producer, said purchase of the Du Pont plant would raise Occidental's chlorine production capacity 17% to 8,585 tons a day from 7,325, and boost its caustic soda capacity 18% to 9,300 tons a day from 7,880. 

   Chlorine and caustic soda are used in the production of polyvinyl chloride resin pellets, a plastic raw material used in the building and construction, automotive, paper, aluminum and cleaning industries. 

   Occidental, a natural resources, chemicals and food-processing concern, said it expects to complete the acquisition in the third quarter, subject to approval by the Federal Trade Commission, other government agencies and the boards of both companies. 

   Du Pont, a Wilmington, Del.-based chemicals concern, recently closed the Corpus Christi plant. 
It will employ about 200 workers, including some former Du Pont employees, and probably resume production during the second quarter of 1988, Occidental said.

Du Pont Co. has authorized money to develop four production facilities for its 
line of non-ozone depleting alternatives to chloroflourocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
The plants -- in Corpus Christi, Texas; Louisville, Ky.; Dordrecht, the 
Netherlands, and Chiba, Japan -- will be operational between 1992 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The company didn't say how much their construction would cost. 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont executives said the plants will be capable of producing more than 140 
million pounds of hydrofluorocarbons annually -- enough to supply most 
worldwide refrigeration needs through the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
The HCFCs would be produced for automobile air conditioners, appliances and 
commercial refrigeration. 
</P>
<P>
"These commercial facilities would be among the first to produce world-scale 
quantities of non-ozone-depleting alternatives," said Joseph Glas, director of 
Du Pont's Freon Products division. 
</P>
<P>
Including the $240 million that it invested through 1990, the company said, its 
total investment to commercialize CFC alternatives will top $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Du Pont announced that it would stop production of CFCs by the end of 
the century. 
</P>
<P>
The Wilmington chemical and fibers company has 10 facilities operating or under 
construction for the production of hydrofluorocarbons. Later this year, three 
facilities will begin operation in Corpus Christi; Maitland, Ontario, and 
Humberside, England. 
</P>
<P>
"Du Pont is working very closely with its customers during the transition, 
particularly since the substitutes are not drop-in replacements, and companies 
will have to modify and redesign equipment to use them," Glas said. 
</P>
<P>
HCFCs are expected to be able to replace 30% of current CFC uses. The 
alternatives have on average 95% less ozone depletion potential than CFCs.

   Du Pont Unveils Coolants to Substitute
   For CFCs; GM Plans Use in 1994 Cars

   NEW YORK -- Du Pont Co. introduced a family of
refrigerator and air conditioner coolants as substitutes for
ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs.
   In one of the first major uses of the substitutes, General
Motors Corp. said it will switch to one of the air
conditioner coolants in cars starting with the 1994
model-year. GM's agreement to use the CFC substitute gives
considerable boost to a line of products whose practical use
had been in serious doubts.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Wilmington, Del., chemical company introduced the CFC
substitutes under the trade name "Suva" at a news conference
here. CFCs have been known by Du Pont's trade name "Freon,"
introduced in 1931. But in recent years, scientists have
gathered evidence suggesting that CFCs may be destroying the
ozone layer that shields the earth from the sun's harmful
ultraviolet rays.
   The commercial introduction of the new products will help
Du Pont phase out its CFC production by the year 2000 under
an international agreement known as the Montreal Protocol. Du
Pont executives said the company so far has invested $240
million in 10 facilities in operation, or under construction,
to manufacture the substitutes. Total investment through this
decade is likely to be about $1 billion. Du Pont accounted
for a quarter of the worldwide CFC sale of 1.9 billion pounds
in 1989.
   But the CFC alternatives won't be cheap. The Suva product
aimed at replacing CFC-12, also known as Freon-12, which is
used as a coolant in automobile air conditioners, will sell
for $10 a pound. CFC-12 currently sells for $2.40 a pound,
which includes $1.37 in a special tax instituted by Congress.
   Du Pont officials said the price of Suva, however, will be
cheaper than CFC-12 by 1995. That's because the tax imposed
on CFCs will rise under a scale, and the cost of
manufacturing the alternative will decrease as sales volume
rises.
   Cost aside, the new coolant must overcome other problems.
Use of the product, also called HFC-134a, in automobile air
conditioners will require an all-new lubricant to be mixed
with the refrigerant. But no lubricant has yet been found to
be quite compatible with the 134a, according to a GM
spokesman, who also said the new coolant is slightly less
efficient.
   Nevertheless, GM has committed itself to using the
product. "We are confident that we'll solve the problems,"
the GM spokesman said.
   To accommodate 134a, GM must develop a larger evaporator
and condenser and redesign the compressor on its air
conditioners. Although the GM spokesman declined to say how
much all this would add to the cost of the new car, or what
the auto maker's total retooling costs would be, Du Pont
officials estimated that GM will have to spend up to $1
billion over the next two to three years to convert to the
new coolant.
   Du Pont's products would compete with similar products
introduced last year under the trade name "Klea" by Britain's
Imperial Chemical Industries PLC. A spokesman for ICI's U.S.
unit said the British concern is working with various
automobile manufacturers in the U.S., but doesn't yet have a
firm sales agreement.

@  19% Profit Rise
@  For 3rd Quarter

   Du Pont Co. reported that third-quarter profit grew a robust 19% from a year ago on the strength of the company's operations in various chemicals and fibers, and in petroleum. 

   Du Pont also raised its quarterly dividend to $1.20 a share from $1.05, a change that will increase the annualized payout to shareholders by some $140 million. 

   Du Pont, unlike companies hurt badly by sharp price declines for basic chemicals and plastics, is benefiting from its broad range of businesses. 
The profit gain was made despite a weakening in the housing market, for which the company is a supplier, and a strengthening in the dollar, which lowers the value of overseas earnings when they are translated into dollars. 

   The Wilmington, Del., company reported net of $547 million, or $2.36 a share, which was in line with Wall Street estimates. 
In the year-earlier period, the company earned $461 million, or $1.91 a share. 
Sales in the latest quarter were $8.59 billion, up 9.4% from $7.85 billion. 

   The dividend increase was Du Pont's second this year, an affirmation of statements by top executives that they intend to increase rewards to shareholders. 
"We haven't benefited the shareholder as much as we need to," said Edgar Woolard Jr., Du Pont's chairman and chief executive officer, in an interview several months before he entered his current position in April. 

   The largest beneficiary will be Seagram Co., which owns about 23% of Du Pont. 
A spokesman for Seagram, the Montreal wine and spirits concern controlled by the Bronfman family, said the company will post additional pretax profit of about $33 million a year because of the additional Du Pont dividends. 

   Du Pont also announced plans for a 3-for-1 stock split, although the initial higher dividend will be paid on pre-split shares. 
Du Pont's stock rose $2.50 a share to close at $117.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. 
Seagram closed at $84.75, up 12.5 cents a share in Big Board trading. 

   Leading the gains for Du Pont in the latest quarter was its industrial products segment, where profit soared to $155 million from $99 million a year earlier. 
The company benefited from continued strong demand and higher selling prices for titanium dioxide, a white pigment used in paints, paper and plastics. 

   James Fallon, a New Providence, N.J., marketing consultant to the chemicals industry, says Du Pont still holds an edge in making the pigment because the company was "first in with the technology" to lower costs. 
He said Du Pont holds about 23% of the world-wide market, the largest single share, at a time when growing uses for the pigment have kept it in tight supply, although others are now adding low-cost production capacity. 

   Profit climbed to $98 million from $71 million in the petroleum segment, as Du Pont's Conoco Inc. oil company was helped by crude oil prices higher than a year ago and by higher natural gas prices and volume. 

   In the diversifed businesses segment, which includes herbicides, profit grew to $64 million from $27 million. 
A spokesman said herbicide use in some areas of the U.S. was delayed earlier in the year by heavy rains, thus increasing sales in the third quarter. 

   In the fibers segment, profit rose to $180 million from $155 million, a gain Du Pont attributed to higher demand in the U.S. for most textile products. 

   Two segments posted lower earnings for the quarter. 
Profit from coal fell to $41 million from $58 million, partly because of a miners' strike. 
And profit from polymers dropped to $107 million from $122 million amid what Du Pont called lower demand and selling prices in certain packaging and industrial markets. 

   For the nine months, Du Pont earned $2 billion, or $8.46 a share, up 18% from $1.69 billion, or $7.03 a share, a year earlier. 
Sales increased 10% to $26.54 billion from $24.05 billion. 

   The increased dividend will be paid Dec. 14 to holders of record Nov. 15. 
The stock split, which is subject to holder approval, would be paid on a still unspecified date in January to holders of record Dec. 21.

<HL> Du Pont-N.V. Philips Optical-Disk Unit
Is Running Up Against Tough Hurdles

<TEXT>
   Du Pont Co.'s much touted venture with N.V. Philips into the optical-disk industry has been disappointing so far and still faces difficult challenges. 

   The joint venture, Philips/Du Pont Optical, was formed in early 1986. 
It aimed to generate sales of $1 billion by 1990 by capturing 25% of a fast-growing world market for compact audio, video and computer-data storage disks. 
The company publicized its high hopes in slick publications and news releases. 

   Instead, Philips/Du Pont has run up against stiff competition, excessive capacity, aggressive price cutting and languishing market growth. 
Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont won't provide any sales figures, but the venture hasn't shown any profit yet, according to Alfred Bok, chairman and chief executive officer of Philips/Du Pont. 
He predicts it will break even this year. 

   For Du Pont, the experience shows the difficulty of shifting from traditional commodity-based fibers and plastics businesses into such higher-margin areas as electronic products, agricultural chemicals and biomedical products. 
The technologies advance quickly and competition is everywhere. 

   Edgar S. Woolard, Du Pont's president and chief operating officer, nurtured the establishment of the venture. 
He says Du Pont is still "very optimistic" about its prospects, but he acknowledges hurdles that must be overcome. 
"The real challenge," he says, is whether Philips/Du Pont Optical "can get there and stay ahead." 

   Philips/Du Pont also demonstrates the challenges that arise when two large companies like Philips and Du Pont combine operations. 
Philips/Du Pont is the largest non-energy joint venture Du Pont has ever tried. 
So far, each parent has invested about $150 million, and each plans to spend an additional $100 million in the near future. 

   Netherlands-based Philips, one of the largest electronics concerns in the world, has been a leader in optical-disk technology. 
Du Pont, the world's largest chemicals concern, has contributed the strength of its plastics know-how to the venture. 

   Officials from both companies say they have encountered "cultural differences." 
Some industry analysts speculate that those differences may have slowed the venture, causing it to lose ground to stiff competition from Japanese concerns. 

   "Du Pont is very conservative and very prestigious," Mr. Bok says. 
"Philips is prestigious, too, but has a different way of doing business. 
Different cultures slow you down, but it makes other things go very fast." 
He declined to be more specific. 

   The venture took its biggest blow in the compact-audio-disk market. 
Only one year ago, Philips/Du Pont had captured the biggest share of this fast-growing industry. 
Consumers were snapping up disks so fast that suppliers couldn't keep up with demand. 
Philips was out in front with a commanding lead over Sony Corp. and other Japanese companies that hadn't yet come up with the technology. 

   The growth potential, however, looked so attractive that producers, particularly the Japanese, quickly popped up everywhere. 
Announced capacity grew to 450 million units in 1987 from 120 million in 1986. 
In one year, the Philips/Du Pont market share dropped to 20% from 35%, according to Mr. Bok. 

   Meanwhile, the consumer buying spree turned out to be short-lived. 
According to some analysts, the disks have appealed to serious music buffs and college students, but middle-of-the-road Americans have been slow to convert their record collections. 
The biggest obstacle is the disks' high cost -- about $15 apiece compared to about $8 for a black vinyl record. 

   Then, as a result of even greater manufacturing overcapacity, drastic price cutting occurred much more quickly than expected. 
Disks that were selling to the music company from the manufacturer at $3 to $4 each dropped to $1 each. 
Philips/Du Pont's profits before tax dropped to between 5% and 10% of sales from 25% of sales, according to Mr. Bok. 
While analysts hope the price cutting may revive the market, it will also reduce revenue and profit margins. 

   Philips/Du Pont doesn't expect consumer sales to improve in the near future, though supply and demand should even out eventually. 
"CD audio profits are very meager," says Mr. Bok. 
"Next year will be difficult. 
It won't be a rich year." 

   So Philips/Du Pont now looks to the professional market. 
It plans to spend a major part of the $200 million capital budget for technology and plants on storage and video disks, Mr. Bok says. 
But even there, some markets for product lines are growing more slowly than expected. 

   Despite the troubles that have developed, neither Du Pont nor Philips suggests having any plans to abandon the venture. 
"If you have two big companies like Philips and Du Pont, it's not something you do overnight," explains Mr. Bok. 
"It's a big investment over time."

<HL> Teflon Is 50 Years Old, but Du Pont Is Still Finding New Uses for Invention </HL>

   Teflon is already just about everywhere. 

   But 50 years after inventing the nonstick coating, Du Pont Co. doesn't plan to get stuck with a mature product that has only average sales and profits. 
So the push is on to make Teflon even more omnipresent. 

   Du Pont's search for new products is accelerating and advertising budgets and sales forces are being strengthened. 
The goal is to double sales growth to a 10% to 12% annual rate. 
On the industrial side, Du Pont is directly tailoring ideas to customer needs, seeking a greater share of the world's market and looking for ways to reduce production costs. 
On the consumer side, Du Pont wants to increase awareness of Teflon. 

   This spring, for example, the Wilmington, Del.-based chemicals giant will introduce Teflon in a spray can. 
The company envisions coating neckties with it to repel food stains and spraying walls and light switches to protect against dirty fingers. 
The spray was recently exhibited at a ski show as a way to keep clothes dry despite falls in the snow. 
It's already being marketed by General Motors Corp.'s Mr. Goodwrench parts operation as protection for car upholstery. 

   "This stuff is really a nifty chemical," says John Thackrah, business manager for the performance products division of Du Pont. 
"You need a lot of ideas to keep a 50-year-old invention alive." 
Adds David Sanders, director of Du Pont's fluoropolymers business, "We're average on profitability and trying to do better." 

   Finding new uses for Teflon has been an ongoing corporate goal. 
That's how it got on everything from pots and pans to synthetic joints, athletic gear and buildings. 
Industrial applications are its biggest market, with wiring and cables its single biggest use. 
Du Pont, which has captured more than 50% of the world market for such coatings, has produced 2.4 billion pounds of the stuff, enough to coat one frying pan for every human being in the world. 

   For many years, Du Pont couldn't make enough Teflon. 
Its inert, slippery and superior insulating properties were in high demand. 
Sales grew at rates as high as 25% a year and totaled $300 million in 1987. 
But in recent years, sales growth has slowed to between 6% and 8% a year and profits have been "average," according to Mr. Sanders. 

   Du Pont's new strategy extends even to pots and pans. 
It plans to have manufacturers reintroduce its low-end cookware, Teflon 2, the first version of non-stick cookware Du Pont introduced in 1962. 
Teflon 2 was succeeded in the U.S. eight years ago by superior versions -- SilverStone and SilverStone Supra. 

   The Teflon 2 strategy has two objectives. 
Du Pont intends to recapture some of the low-price market that now goes to Silverstone rivals. 
The company hopes that by offering three price choices, shoppers will be willing to pay a little extra for a Du Pont certified product at any level. 
Also, consumers are apparently self-inspired to upgrade purchases, so Du Pont wants to build loyalty starting at the low-end of the scale. 

   On yet another front, Du Pont is working to dust off and modernize Teflon's 1950s image. 
Now under way is a campaign to sell Teflon-treated fabrics and wallpaper as convenience products. 
The fabrics have been around for years, but have "slipped into low profile" and lost ground to Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co.'s better-known Scotchgard treatment, according to Cynthia Gray, a Du Pont publicity specialist. 
Du Pont believes women today care less about having a spotless sofa -- the old promotion line -- and more about carefree living styles, she says. 

   "It used to sound like a detergent or polish, something that came in a bucket rather than something that makes your life easier," she says. 

   Yesterday, Du Pont presented the concept at a New York tea party and it plans for the first time to advertise in consumer decorating magazines like House Beautiful and Metropolitan Home. 

   Teflon-treated wallpapers are a new product that Du Pont pins high hopes on. 
"They're scrubbable," says Ms. Gray. 
"You'd have to shoot them to kill them."

   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co. said it developed two
prospective substitutes for Halon fire extinguishants that
don't cause depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer.
   Based on preliminary tests over the past year, the new
bromine-free agents cause "zero to extremely low" ozone
depletion, said Donald P. Dunn, a Du Pont marketing manager.
Halons, which can do severe damage, are being phased out by
international agreements that call for a production freeze by
1992.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont, a chemicals and energy company, currently sells
about $8 million to $10 million a year of fire
extinguishants. The world-wide market is about $80 million.
Du Pont's new products could be used in aircraft, ships,
computer rooms, museums, hospitals and petroleum-production
facilities, Mr. Dunn said.
   Du Pont has invested more than $170 million on research
into alternatives to chlorofluorocarbons and Halons, which
are both substances widely blamed for damaging the ozone
layer. Du Pont is concentrating on substitutes made up of
hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, and hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or
HCFCs.
   By excluding the bromine compound, the active agent in
Halon, Du Pont's new products are safer for the environment,
Mr. Dunn said. But he added that they would be two to three
times more expensive, and would require using more volume for
comparable effectiveness.
   Du Pont's products will be produced commercially at its
Maitland, Ontario, facility and in small quantities at a
pilot facility in Deepwater, N.J.
   Approval of the products are subject to separate
applications and standards testing by the U.S. Army, Air
Force and Navy, as well as the National Fire Protection
Association. Mr. Dunn said the company expects to market the
products commercially beginning in 1995.
   Du Pont's main competitors in manufacturing fire
extinguishants are Imperial Chemical Industries PLC in
Britain and Atochem in France as well as Great Lakes Chemical
Co. and several smaller companies in the U.S.

Plan Venture Tied
To Liquid Toner

   Xerox Corp. and Du Pont Co. said they plan to form a joint venture to develop and manufacture copying equipment based on a new type of liquid toner technology. 

   The agreement is expected to give new life to the technology, which was overtaken by so-called dry toner technology as the integral part of imaging and copying equipment in the late 1970s. 
The two companies licensed the new liquid toner technology, called Electroink, from Savin Corp., a copying machine company that developed a method that makes the use of liquid toners more economical than before. 

   Under the agreement between Du Pont and Xerox, the two companies said they will form a new jointly owned company called DX Imaging. 
It initially will employ about 200 people, and the companies are seeking to locate it in a high-technology "corridor" west of Philadelphia. 

   The companies said they already have invested $80 million in developing the technology and expect to invest an additional $40 million to support the project this year. 

   In Stamford, Conn., David Sadler, chairman of Savin, said the company last year licensed the liquid toner technology to Xerox for $28 million and to Du Pont for $9 million. 
Under the licensing agreements, Du Pont and Xerox can develop machines for high-speed copying, for color proofs, color printing, phototypesetting and engineering graphics. 
Savin said it licensed the technology to Ricoh Ltd. of Japan for the development of office copying machines, which Savin expects to market in the U.S., beginning in 1988. 

   A spokesman for Xerox, the Stamford-based office equipment and financial services company, said DX Imaging initially will use the new technology to produce color proofing and color printing machines. 

   In the 1970s, dry toner technology produced high-resolution images and products that were better than those produced by liquid toner products. 
But the dry powder also increased the cost of the machines and caused repair problems. 
The new liquid toner appears to produce equally sharp images and may do so in machines that can copy faster than those using the dry toner technology, a Xerox spokesman said. 

   Savin is a unit of Canada Development Corp., a Toronto-based Canadian government holding company. 
Du Pont is a Wilmington, Del.-based chemical products maker.

   Du Pont Co. is launching a sweeping program to cut costs
and improve operating efficiency in a bid to boost annual
pretax profits about $2 billion in five years.
   This latest streamlining by the country's largest chemical
company is in addition to a plan announced in July to cut
costs by $1 billion by the end of 1992.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Last year, the Wilmington, Del., company earned $2.31
billion, or $3.40 a share, on sales of $40.05 billion.
   Du Pont and many other chemical companies are retrenching
to cope with excess supplies that have forced down prices of
their commodity chemicals and plastics. Economic slowdowns
around the world also have hurt demand for many chemicals and
plastics.
   Edgar Woolard Jr., Du Pont chairman and chief executive,
said the latest plan calls for the "continuous improvement of
operations" across the company. Du Pont is focusing on
nuts-and-bolts issues such as increasing capacity
utilization, eliminating duplicative work and reducing staff,
among other steps, he said. "This is old fashioned industrial
engineering, not rocket science," he said.
   What he termed Du Pont's "integrated operations" plan
could yield about $1 billion from increased capacity
utilization at Du Pont's manufacturing plants without making
any new investments in them. An additional nearly $1 billion
could come from improving yields, boosting revenue and
eliminating an undetermined number of jobs, he said.
   Mr. Woolard said the company doesn't have a targeted
number of job cuts for the latest plan, adding that the cuts
would come from many areas and wouldn't be concentrated in Du
Pont's white-collar ranks. Du Pont has about 140,000
employees world-wide.
   Mr. Woolard said company planners project that in about
five years the plan could "improve pre-tax earnings in the $2
billion range."
   Investors responded favorably to the news. Du Pont shares
were quoted at $45.625 each, up 62.5 cents, in late New York
Stock Exchange trading yesterday.
   Harvey Stober, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.,
said he raised his rating on Du Pont to "accumulate" from
"hold" based on news of the latest plan. He estimated that
the projected increase in pretax profit translated into about
$2 a share in earnings for Du Pont.
   Mr. Woolard said the plan is being directed by Robert
Luft, senior vice president in Du Pont's chemicals business.
It already has been tried out within a few polymer divisions,
one in chemicals and one in Du Pont's electronics business,
he said.
   Portions of the latest plan were reported in yesterday's
News Journal in Wilmington, where many Du Pont employees read
about it for the first time.
   Mr. Woolard emphasized that the longrange program is
distinct from the plan Du Pont announced earlier this summer
to cut $1 billion in costs by the end of next year. As part
of that plan, Du Pont so far has identified about 5,000 job
cuts.

   Du Pont Co. said it will increase its planned
fourth-quarter charges by $350 million, or 50 cents a share,
to cover costs of recalling its Benlate DF fungicide and a
previously announced $1 billion restructuring.
   The chemical company previously announced a fourth-quarter
charge of $325 million, or 50 cents a share, tied to the
restructuring plan that was announced in July. The total
expected fourth-quarter charge of about $675 million, or $1 a
share, will leave it with a net loss for the quarter,
analysts said.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   In last year's fourth quarter, Du Pont had net income of
$483 million, or 71 cents a share.
   Du Pont said that $175 million, or 25 cents a share, of
the added charge is for the estimated costs, net of expected
insurance coverage, of recalling Benlate. The Wilmington,
Del., company pulled Benlate off the market in March because
some shipments were found to be contaminated with a
herbicide. Benlate is used on fruits, vegetables and
ornamental plants to curb fungus growth.
   Du Pont spokesman John Malloy declined to estimate the
insurance payments Du Pont expects to receive to help cover
damage payments and other costs tied to the recall.
   In this year's first half, Du Pont took a charge of $41
million, or six cents a share, related to Benlate.
   Scientists at Du Pont and outside researchers say they
aren't sure what is causing Benlate to kill plants. But it
appears to be unrelated to the incident that led Du Pont to
take the product out of circulation. The 20-year-old
fungicide was pulled from the market by Du Pont this spring
after traces of the herbicide atrazine were detected in some
Benlate batches for the second time. Atrazine was first
detected in certain Benlate shipments in 1989.
   The other $175 million, or 25 cents a share, of the latest
charge is related to cost-cutting in the company's fibers,
imaging and electronics divisions, among others, Du Pont
said.

<HEAD>Synar Raps Du Pont Co. Plan To Pay Severance to Weapons Plant
Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee chairman said Tuesday he
would investigate Du Pont Co.'s plan to use $75 million in federal
funds to pay severance benefits to 6,500 workers at a nuclear
weapons plant, even though virtually all will keep their jobs under
new management.
   Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., said ``there is no logical or
equitable reason for the taxpayers to provide a $75 million
windfall to workers who will not lose their jobs or benefits,
solely to enhance Du Pont's corporate image.''
   Synar charged that the Department of Energy, which owns the
Savannah River Nuclear Plant in Aiken, S.C., has failed to actively
resist Du Pont's plan to invoke cost-reimbursable language in its
contract to pay severance to its employees when the company
withdraws from the facility in October 1989.
   He said he had instructed his staff to investigate the matter.
   Du Pont designed and constructed the plant, and since 1950
operated it under government contract before deciding last year to
pull out when the currect pact expires. Under DOE rules, the new
contractor, yet unnamed, must offer jobs and comparable benefits to
all Du Pont employees except for those in 37 key positions or among
support staff at the company's Wilmington, Del., headquarters.
   Synar, chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee
on the environment, energy and natural resources, said,
``Department of Energy officials appear to be more concerned about
protecting the corporate interests of private contractors than the
government or taxpayers.''
   An Energy Department spokesman, Will Callicott, declined comment
except to say ``it's an issue still under review.'' That review was
triggered in April by the DOE's own inspector general, after it
appeared initially that the department would accept the Du Pont
plan.
   Synar, in a letter to Energy Secretry John S. Herrington, said,
``This delay and inaction only casts doubt on DOE's willingness to
be aggressive in its stewardship of public funds.''
   Synar asked DOE to provide ``all internal analyses, memos, legal
opinions, communications, responses and any other documents
generated by DOE or contractor staff or officials related to the
severance pay issue.''
   Earlier, a Du Pont spokesman, Jim Felder, declined comment on
the case except to note that ``Our employment plans call for the
payment of severance, and we expect the federal government to
reimburse Du Pont for the cost of severance.''
   Under the plan, Du Pont employees would receive a week's pay for
each year of service with the company up until Sept. 30, 1985. That
was the year when Du Pont and DOE agreed to stop accrual of
severance benefits for employees who actually would keep their jobs
under new management.
   Synar said there has been no instance in which the government
paid severance to workers who retained their jobs when there was a
change of contractors at other federal nuclear facilities.

<HEAD>Du Pont And Waste Management To Build Plastic Recycling Plant In
Philly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Du Pont Co. and Waste Management of
North America Inc. announced today Philadelphia is the site for a
plastic recycling plant to serve the northeastern United States and
eventually anchor a national network.
   Nicholas Pappas, Du Pont's executive vice president, said the
nation's fifth largest city ``will provide an excellent site for us
to demonstrate that plastic recycling is a vital tool for reducing
the nation's solid waste disposal problem.''
   The Philadelphia plant is expected to be the first link in the
largest recycling system ever, Pappas said. Du Pont is
headquartered in Wilmington, Del., and Waste Management is based in
Oak Brook, Ill.
   Pappas said DuPont and Waste Management expect to announce early
next year the site of a Midwestern plant. Others will be located in
areas where the companies can buy materials from curbside and
deposit programs.
   The Philadelphia plant, which will have an annual capacity of up
to 40 million pounds initially, is scheduled to begin operating in
the spring of 1990 and will employ about 70 people.
   Noting that 60 percent of Philadelphia's neighborhoods already
participate in recycling programs, Pappas said by locating the
facility here, ``we expect to be able to purchase a steady supply
of source material and will have access to viable markets for the
high-value, end-use products Du Pont intends to develop.''
   Pappas said Du Pont expects to use the recycled plastics in the
automotive, consumer and building industries.
   William Hulligan, president of the Waste Management, said ``the
recycling experience and polymer technology possessed by Waste
Management and Du Pont, coupled with public enthusiasm for plastic
recycling will make this a successful venture.''
   The two executives said the joint venture will have a total
capacity of 200 million pounds from trash sources by 1994 and will
provide an integrated recycling system that includes collection,
separation, sorting and reclamation of the plastics.
   Waste Management claims to collect waste from more than 8
million residential and industrial customers in the United States.

ODDBALL BUILDINGS NEED CARPET, TOO; 
</P>
<P>
ADVERTISING: A NEW DU PONT CAMPAIGN AIMED AT SMALL-BUSINESS OWNERS WILL USE 
CALIFORNIA STORES SHAPED LIKE THE PRODUCTS THEY CARRY TO INTRODUCE A NEW BRAND 
OF FLOOR COVERING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
There will always be those who ridicule California as the home of the wacky. A 
new ad campaign for a Du Pont carpeting is about to give those critics more 
fodder. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign features some of the funkiest-looking mom-and-pop shops in the 
state. All are California businesses housed in buildings that look like the 
products they sell. 
</P>
<P>
There's the doughnut-shaped Donut Hole in La Puente. There's also the hot 
dog-like Tail O' the Pup in West Hollywood. And, of course, the camera-shaped 
Photo Express in Westminster. Not to forget a shoe repair store in Bakersfield 
that looks like a giant shoe. Also, a heavy-equipment company in Turlock in a 
building designed to look like a bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
These -- and several other California small businesses -- are the off-the-wall 
centerpieces of a multimillion-dollar print and TV ad campaign for Du Pont 
Flooring Systems. The ads will all note: "No matter what they look like 
outside, businesses prefer Du Pont Certified Carpet inside." 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the ads is to introduce a new name-brand carpet -- Du Pont 
Certified. None of the ads show the carpet. None tell customers where to get 
the carpet. And none tell what the carpet costs. Rather, the ads simply use 
some of California's most architecturally unusual small businesses to try to 
catch the eyes of small-business owners. 
</P>
<P>
"Commercial carpeting is not the kind of thing that immediately leaps to 
peoples' minds," said Dave Nevergall, account supervisor at Rumrill Hoyt, the 
Rochester, N.Y., agency that created the campaign. "We're trying to attract 
attention in a way that will be memorable." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly the ads will be memorable to some California residents. Of the 13 
offbeat locations that will appear in the TV and print ads, eight are in 
California. And those who own the small businesses featured in the ads are 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been used in ads before," said Eddie Blake, who has co-owned the 
43-year-old hot dog stand, Tail 'O the Pup, for 15 years. A recent picture of 
the stand in an advertisement for Haggar slacks boosted business a bit, he 
said. "People recognized the place in the ad, and they decided to come by." 
</P>
<P>
Photo Express, the drive-in film processing shop that looks like a camera, was 
also recently used in an ad for Avon. 
</P>
<P>
"People called from all over and told me they saw the ad," said Mary Dokter, 
who purchased the 11-year-old shop about a year ago. "But you don't really get 
a lot of customers from these kinds of ads. It's free coupons that bring in 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
Why did Du Pont select California businesses? "There just seems to be a greater 
number of these buildings in California," said Alan Trei, marketing programs 
manager at Du Pont's Flooring Systems division. "Sure, you can find some of 
these buildings in other places, but we didn't want to take a film crew all the 
way to say, Lexington, Ky., just for one shot." 
</P>
<P>
Despite this large ad campaign for carpeting, Du Pont doesn't actually make 
carpet. What Du Pont makes is the fiber that is used to make carpeting. In 
fact, no one makes more of it. Experts estimate that of the estimated $4.8 
billion in commercial carpeting sold last year in the United States, Du Pont 
fibers were woven into nearly half of them. 
</P>
<P>
Now, Du Pont wants more. "Obviously, their objective is to increase market 
share," said Ron VanGelderen, president of the Carpet &amp; Rug Institute, a 
trade group for carpet manufacturers based in Dalton, Ga. "They can probably do 
it, too." 
</P>
<P>
The way Du Pont executives figure it, every year about 8.5 million 
small-business owners buy new carpet -- without consulting designers. These are 
the customers that the new Du Pont campaign will try to reach. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign is scheduled to air next week on several cable-TV stations, 
including CNN and ESPN. It will also appear in issues of Architectural Digest, 
Fortune, Money and Time magazines. 
</P>
<P>
But at least one marketing expert thinks that Du Pont is way off base. 
</P>
<P>
"The ads seem to be equating Du Pont with something that is less than serious," 
said Donald Kanter, professor of marketing at Boston University. "None of this 
will make any sense to the guy who is serious about his business. And I assure 
you, most small-business people are very serious about their businesses."

   Du Pont Co. reported that second-quarter profit rose 12% with operating gains in all business segments except its strike-hurt coal operations. 

   The chemical company earned $714 million, or $3.02 a share, compared with $639 million, or $2.67 a share, a year earlier on more shares outstanding. 
Sales were $9.28 billion, up 11% from $8.34 billion. 

   Those results were in line with Wall Street estimates, after accounting for nonrecurring items in the latest and the year-earlier quarters. 

   "Everything was a little bit better than we expected, except coal" said Leslie Ravitz, a chemical-industry analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. 

   If not for the nonrecurring items, per-share earnings would have grown 35% in the second quarter, despite more signs that the economy is weakening. 
That would support Du Pont's contention that its change in business mix and its belt-tightening has left it less vulnerable to cyclical swings. 
Still, analysts expect the company's pace to slow in the second half. 

   Edgar Woolard Jr., Du Pont's chairman, acknowledged in a statement that the year's last half may be hurt by "a somewhat weaker U.S. economy and the stronger dollar." 
A stronger dollar reduces profit that the Wilmington, Del.-based company reports when translating overseas results into dollars. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Du Pont shares rose 37.5 cents to close at $115 a share. 

   In the latest quarter, the sharpest improvement came in industrial products, where profit soared 93% to $158 million. 
The segment was helped by strong results for white pigments, which are used as whiteners in paper, plastics and paints. 

   Du Pont has benefited from a pigments manufacturing process that satisfies tightening environmental regulation as well as from continuing strong demand. 
Some competitors have had to close plants or take on the expense of altering them. 

   In the fibers segment, profit rose 19% to $182 million, as higher volume and selling prices for most textile products more than offset higher raw material costs. 
And in Du Pont's diversified businesses segment, profit was $166 million, up 18%, mostly because of strong demand for agricultural products. 

   Du Pont's Consolidation Coal Co. confronted striking members of the United Mine Workers only toward the end of the second quarter. 
Although volumes and prices rose from year-earlier levels, so did costs for each unit of coal shipped because there remained fixed costs at the struck mines. 
Profit edged down 2% to $48 million. 
The miners struck in sympathy with workers at Pittston Co., which has refused to sign an industry labor contract. 

   Profit also fell at Du Pont's Conoco Inc. oil company, by 16% to $115 million, but only because of nonrecurring items. 
Operating profit climbed 66% on higher crude oil prices, refined product margins and natural gas volumes. 

   Likewise, the polymers business showed a 4.7% drop in profit to $142 million because the year-earlier quarter included a $28 million gain on technology sales. 
On an operating basis, however, the segment posted a 17% profit increase in strong markets for ethylene-based polymers, used in packaging, among other things, and for fluoropolymers, such as Teflon. 

   In the first half, net increased 18% to $1.45 billion, or $6.10 a share, from $1.23 billion, or $5.12 a share, a year earlier. 
After the exclusion of nonrecurring items, per-share earnings climbed 30%. 
Sales were $17.95 billion, up 11% from $16.2 billion.

Du Pont's Woolard
Named President,
Operating Chief

   Du Pont Co. named two top-level executives as part of its efforts to continue grooming its next chief executive officer and provide new leadership for its Conoco Inc. unit. 

   In a move that was widely expected, Du Pont's vice chairman, Edgar S. Woolard Jr., was named president and chief operating officer. 

   In addition, Constantine S. Nicandros was named president and chief executive of Conoco. 

   The promotions consolidate the power of the 52-year-old Mr. Woolard and signal that Du Pont and Conoco are likely to stick to their current strategies. 
Mr. Woolard's advancement also appears to confirm widespread speculation that the giant chemicals and energy concern intends for him to succeed Richard E. Heckert, 63, as chairman and chief executive. 

   Mr. Nicandros, 53, has been president of Conoco's world-wide petroleum operations. 
When his new assignment begins March 1, he will remain an executive vice president of Du Pont and a member of its executive committee. 
Du Pont acquired the Houston-based energy concern in 1981. 

   In addition, Ralph E. Bailey, vice chairman of Du Pont and chairman of Conoco, will retire, effective March 31. 
When Mr. Bailey, 62, steps down, his posts will be abolished. 

   According to the company's announcements, Mr. Woolard assumes new posts, and his old position will be eliminated. 
Mr. Nicandros also assumes a new post, which takes in his previous responsibilities for the petroleum operations. 

   Mr. Nicandros has helped Conoco earn a reputation as a lean, fast-moving organization with fewer layers of bureaucracy than many of its competitors by trimming staff and becoming directly involved in operations. 

   Nevertheless, Mr. Nicandros has had to make painful cutbacks because of sharply lower crude oil and natural gas prices. 
Earlier this month, he decided to close Conoco's big Milne Point drilling operation in Alaska. 
Although the site opened in December 1985 amid much fanfare, it quickly ran into trouble as the price of crude oil fell. 
The decision to close Milne Point "took some guts," said a Conoco insider, "but it probably got applause." 

   Mr. Nicandros said, "You could continue to eat it (the operating loss) and be very proud of being in Alaska, or you could say, 'Hey, proud as I may be, I'm not in the business of losing money.'" 

   Mr. Nicandros, who rose through the ranks as a strategic planner, quickly earned a reputation at the company for helping it to maintain its own identity. 
After Conoco was acquired by Du Pont, he forbade the oil company's employees to answer any questions from Du Pont's Wilmington, Del., headquarters until the requests had been cleared by him. 

   "A lot of people were trying to handle us like a department of Du Pont," he once recalled. 
"We told them forget it. 
Most of the time, it was just an awful lot of people making work." 

   Despite a hands-on style as a manager, Mr. Nicandros likes to delegate authority. 
For example, he avoids getting involved in decisions about fuel prices or production-run levels. 
"I don't expect anyone to be right all the time," he says. 
"As long as they are right most of the time, delegation works very well." 

   In recent years, Du Pont has tried to adopt the business philosophy, which includes giving subordinates more latitude, that Mr. Nicandros is widely credited with fostering. 
Second-guessing, he believes, creates a competitive disadvantage. 
In his view, rank-and-file employees need to hold themselves more accountable for their performance. 

   In his new role, Mr. Woolard will take on the additional responsibility of overseeing Conoco. 
After spending most of his career in the company's textile-fibers business, he was named vice chairman in 1985 in response to what some viewed as pressure from Seagram Co., a major shareholder.

<HEAD>Three Convicted in $10 Million Du Pont Extortion Attempt</HEAD>

   Three Argentinian nationals have been
found guilty of trying to extort $10 million from the Du Pont Co.
for the return of stolen documents the company claimed contained
trade secrets for the production of Lycra.
   Lycra is Du Pont's trade name for spandex, an elastic fiber used
primarily in clothing such as swimming suits and leotards.
   A federal jury deliberated about two hours Tuesday before
returning guilty verdicts for conspiracy and attempted extortion
against Bruno Skerianz, Raul Armando Giordano and Antonio Ruben
Inigo.
   They each face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
U.S. District judge Joseph Longobardi set sentencing for Feb. 26.
   Jose Petrosino, another defendant, is fighting extradition from
Italy. Charges were dropped against Maria I. Lorenzo de Bianchini,
who agreed to testify for the federal government.
   During the nine-day trial, the prosecution portrayed Skerianz as
the mastermind behind the extortion attempt.
   The defense, however, claimed Skerianz had not attempted
extortion because he and the others had planned to manufacture
spandex for Radicci, an Italian textile manufacturer.
   The defense argued that Du Pont initiated the contact with
Skerianz after Mexican textile manufacturer Isaac Assa told the
Wilmington-based chemical giant that Skerianz had the documents.
Assa was a former employer of Skerianz.
   The prosecution argued Du Pont had been induced against its will
to agree to pay $10 million for 1,581 documents concerning Lycra
production that were stolen from its Lycra manufacturing plant in
Mercedes, Argentina.
   The prosecution said Du Pont was forced to enter into an
agreement with Skerianz and the others. Under the agreement,
Skerianz and the others would not work in spandex production for
five years. In addition, during that period, Du Pont would agree to
sell 20 tons of spandex yarn per month to a company chosen by
Skerianz.
   The negotiations had been conducted between Du Pont officials
and New York attorney Marvin Gersten, who represented Skerianz.
   Among the prosecution witnesses were Skerianz' two brothers,
both of whom work for Du Pont. One brother, Ferre Scheriase, a Du
Pont vice president for Latin American operations, testified that
during a conversation with Skerianz, his brother said, ```I am
willing to talk with anybody in Du Pont. If someone needs to know
the value of this (the documents), it is worth $10 million to me.'''
   Skerianz had worked for Du Pont more than 20 years ago, while
the others had resigned from the Mercedes plant in the fall of 1988.
   The three defendants and Lorenzo de Bianchini were all arrested
in February in Geneva, Switzerland, after an aborted attempt to
return the documents and pick up the $10 million.
   Petrosino was arrested later.
   Last year, Du Pont had Lycra sales of more than $600 million.
The company said it plans to invest more than $1 billion over the
next four years to expand its Lycra capacity. According to Du Pont,
the Lycra demand has exceeded the supply.
   Du Pont controls more than 50 percent of the spandex market
worldwide, according to company officials.

   WILMINGTON, Del. -- Du Pont Co. said its
agricultural-products unit licensed to Bio-Rad Laboratories
Inc. the exclusive rights to a genetic-particle delivery
system it calls Biolistics.
   The process involves propulsion of microscopic DNA-coated
particles directly into plant and animal cells. The genetic
material introduced via the so-called "gene gun" combines
with existing DNA and can impart new traits.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Du Pont said applications of the process include possible
production of disease-resistant or insect-resistant crops, or
higher-yielding plants, as well as potential biomedical
applications.
   The gene gun was developed in the late 1980s by Cornell
University scientists, who formed a closely held company,
Biolistics Inc.; Du Pont acquired rights to the technology in
1989.
   The system uses microscopic pellets of titanium, to which
tiny dabs of genetic material have been attached. The
gene-delivery system then fires millions of such particles
into plant or animal tissue. Du Pont said the system "has
been used successfully to introduce genes into corn,
soybeans, mammalian tissues and microorganisms."
   Bio-Rad, based in Hercules, Calif., makes research
products, diagnostic kits and anlaytical instruments. Under
the pact with Du Pont, it has the right to make instruments
for, "and sell consumables resulting from," the delivery
system.
