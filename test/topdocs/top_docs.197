<LEADPARA>  ACCORDING to legend, Buffalo chicken wings took flight in 1964 at the Anchor
Bar in Buffalo, N.Y. At that time, Buffalo's pre-eminent bar food was roast
beef on weck, thinly sliced meat wrapped in thin gravy on a kimmelweck roll, a
kaiser roll topped with coarse salt and caraway seeds.;    One evening, Anchor
Bar co-owner Teressa Bellissimowas asked by her son Dom to throw together some
freebie eats for a bunch of regulars who were hungry after spending a lot of
money at the bar.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  See related articles pages 1C and 6C  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Not wanting to use expensive ingredients but endeavoring to provide
something substantial, Teressa cut off the wings from a few handy chickens.
Then she removed the bony tips and cut the remainder in half at the joint.
(The meatier part of the wing has become known as a drumette for obvious
reasons. No name has been given to the other part, which looks like an
oversize safety pin covered with skin.);    Teressa deep-fried the wings and
tossed them with some hot sauce. She served them with celery sticks taken from
an antipasto platter and some blue cheese dressing, normally reserved for
salads. Buffalo chicken wings were born.;    Most great bar foods have staunch
advocates who insist they can only be made one way. In the case of Buffalo
chicken wings, purists insist on the following:;    (check) Wings should never
be breaded or floured.;    (check) Deep frying is the only accepted cooking
method. The choice of fat is up to you. If you want to make some concession to
health, use canola oil.;    (check) The choice of hot sauce is crucial. The
original hot sauce was Frank's Louisiana Red Hot Sauce. Durkee's has a hot
sauce that it claims is formulated from Frank's original recipe. I tested
Durkee's against Crystal Louisiana Hot Sauce. I preferred Durkee's because it
had a creamier texture and a more appealing color (some wings have a putrid,
pale orange color). The level of heat and spice was about the same.;
(check) It ain't Buffalo wings unless it has blue cheese dressing and celery
sticks. Yes, these accompaniments came about by accident, but so did the
elements in chicken Marengo. Some people try to cheat with ranch-style
dressing instead of blue cheese. Sorry, no dice.;    BUFFALO CHICKEN WINGS;
20 chicken wings;   Oil for deep frying;  4 tablespoons butter;  5 tablespoons
Durkee's Louisiana Hot Sauce;  1 tablespoon white vinegar;   Remove the tips
from the wings. Discard or save for stock. Cut the rest in half at the joint.
Dry thoroughly on paper towels.;    Put oil in a large skillet, saucepot or
fryer to a depth of 2 inches. Heat to a temperature of 350 degrees or until
hot but not smoking. Add as many wings as possible in one layer so that they
do not crowd. Fry 7 minutes, turning periodically to cook evenly. Drain on
paper towels. Repeat until all the wings are cooked. Cool. (You can cook the
dish all the way at this point by adding 2 minutes to the cooking time.);
Make sauce by melting butter with hot sauce and vinegar. When ready to serve
wings, reheat oil and cook wings 2 minutes until just crisped and heated
through. Drain again on paper towels. When all the wings are cooked, put them
in a large bowl. Pour sauce over them and toss thoroughly. Serve on a platter
with excess sauce poured over. Serve with celery sticks and blue cheese
dressing.  </TEXT>

There's more capitalism than altruism these days behind the resurgence of the
once nearly extinct buffalo -- the shaggy animals are easier to raise, fetch
more per pound and are lower in fat and cholesterol than beef.
</P>
<P>
The buffalo, which once roamed the Great Plains like a moving black robe, was
hunted for meat and hides in such great numbers that historians say by 1889
fewer than 600 remained. Since 1970, the number of buffalo has doubled in this
country to about 60,000, according to the American Bison Assn.
</P>
<P>
About 400 stockmen, ranchers like Brian Ward of Center, have gone into raising
buffalo because of a beef market made unstable by American eating habits. Ward
runs 1,700 head on his 100,000-acre spread in southern Colorado's San Luis
Valley and sells about 100,000 pounds of boneless meat a year.
</P>
<P>
"We get long winters in this valley," he said. "The buffalo hide's thicker
(than cattle), they got a lot more hair and they eat and tend to be more like
wild animals -- store fat in the fall and their metabolism slows down in the
winter, so they require less feed.
</P>
<P>
"There are some exciting times. We drive them about 35 miles to pasture and
back every year, cross-country. We used to use horses but we use motorcycles
now. The buffalo don't charge the cycles as bad as they do horses."
</P>
<P>
The price of good buffalo breeding stock has doubled in the last five years to
about $1,500 for a young breed cow, twice what a comparable beef cow brings,
according to the Denver-based ABA. But buffalo meat also brings twice the price
of beef, and it's lean meat. A 3-ounce serving has 93 calories, compared to 183
for beef; 43 milligrams of cholesterol, compared to 55 for beef; and 1.8 grams
of fat, compared to 8.7 for beef, the association says.
</P>
<P>
A buffalo cow can bear calves for 30 years or more, while a cow is usually sent
to slaughter after about 10. Stockmen can also sell skulls for $100 or so,
uncured robes for $6 to $12 a square foot and mountable heads for $400 on up.
</P>
<P>
The symbol of the American West is an imposing animal. It has a black-brown,
shaggy head and cape and short curved black horns. A mature bull stands more
than 6 feet tall at its hump and weighs 2,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
A century ago, the buffalo was nearly exterminated as the railroads pushed
westward. The slaughter was triggered by demand for meat to feed the rail crews
and the crowded East, a new tanning method that let the spongy hides be used as
leather, and political expediency -- to destroy the Plains Indians' food
supply.
</P>
<P>
Historian Francis Haines said: "The rush of new hunters to the Kansas plains
resembled the stampede to a new gold strike. . . . In the spring of 1872 . . .
the constant booming of the big guns sounded more like a battle than a hunt."
</P>
<P>
In 1872, Col. Richard Irving Dodge wrote there was "apparently no limit to the
number of buffaloes." A year later, he found "myriads of carcasses. The air was
foul with a sickening stench and the vast plain, which only 12 short months
before teemed with animal life, was a dead, solitary putrid plain."
</P>
<P>
Historians estimate that 6.3 million buffalo were killed in seven years.
</P>
<P>
The Plains Indians, whose society depended on the buffalo for food, shelter and
clothing, either starved or surrendered. Their lives were so miserable that the
"Ghost Dance" cult sprang up, preaching that whites would be buried and the
buffalo would return. The Army's massacre of 200 Sioux at Wounded Knee at the
end of 1890 ended the "Ghost Dance" movement.
</P>
<P>
It wasn't until the early 20th Century that buffalo preservation became a
concern. The newly created American Bison Society and President Teddy Roosevelt
were able to persuade Congress to set up preserves in Oklahoma and Montana in
1907. By then there were several hundred buffalo in private herds.
</P>
<P>
"It was the ranchers who really took it upon themselves to save the bison,"
said Duane Lammers, president of the ABA. "Some of those early people who
wanted to save the buffaloes had Indian heritage, some had Indian wives. It was
very important to them to save the bison. . . .
</P>
<P>
"I think, too, it was just out of genuine care for them."
</P>
<P>
Buffalo stockmen warn that the bison remains a wild animal, extremely powerful
and territorial. There is an old saying that you can push a buffalo anywhere it
wants to go. Another is never turn your back on a buffalo.
</P>
<P>
But the advantages are apparent as well.
</P>
<P>
"They are easier to take care of," said Lammers, who runs about 1,000 head on
his Triple Seven ranch in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
"Beef producers are living with their cow herds during the calving season. That
first spring when we didn't have cattle we went through calving here with free
time. It was like (taking) a couple of weeks off," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If a storm comes up, I'm losing sleep over my cattle. With my buffalo, I can
just sleep through the night."

REFLECTIONS: 'BUFFALOES ARE VERY LEAN ANIMALS, SO IT ULTIMATELY RESULTS IN A

Ken Childs, once a tool salesman in Central California, now has a home where
the buffalo roam. And to him, it approximates paradise. Childs and his wife,
Denice, both 37, have a buffalo ranch in Ramona, which produced the American
Bison Assn.'s Gold Trophy Champion for 1989. Times staff writer Leslie Wolf
interviewed Ken Childs at the Star B Ranch in Ramona, and Kenneth Lam
photographed him.
</P>
<P>
 People think of San Diego as palm trees and yachts and beaches, yet they
should realize that the No. 1 buffalo in the nation came from right here in San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
We started raising buffalo mainly out of a need to keep this ranch in the
family. My wife's father had the ranch for about a year before we came here to
manage it for him. He's a big businessman up in Los Angeles. I had a
tool-distributing business, but typical of any business, it just totally
drained my time and my family life was suffering. We knew we had to make a
change. Then the opportunity came up here, and my wife's father urged us to
come down and see what we could do.
</P>
<P>
Our first intention was to develop, but it didn't take us long to see this is a
special place. We thought we'd try to create a business here first.
</P>
<P>
We needed an idea. We looked into horses and cattle, but realistically, 1,000
acres is not enough to raise a lot of cattle, and the horse business is very
competitive. We heard about exotic animals, so we looked into it, and here we
are nine years later, full on into the buffalo business.
</P>
<P>
We had a lot of learning to do. We had to build up all the fences around the
place, and build a good solid corral. Then we had to create a market for the
buffalo meat.
</P>
<P>
I don't have much marketing experience, but I really like what I'm selling.
Buffalo meat is becoming more and more in demand because buffaloes are very
lean animals, so it ultimately results in a meat that is low in fat,
cholesterol and calories. It has a lower cholesterol content than chicken. It's
good for heart patients who are starving for a good old burger. We also do not
give them any growth stimulants or steroids, so the public really appreciates
that. It tastes just like beef, but actually has more flavor to it because it
has less fat.
</P>
<P>
It also gives the restaurants a good gimmick. Everybody can relate to the
history of the American bison. . . . Most people don't know it, but an influx
of water buffalo is coming into the country, and the quality of meat doesn't
even compare. So we tell people to make sure they're getting American bison
meat.
</P>
<P>
We also sell buffalo skulls, trophy heads, bones, and hides to make buffalo
robes from. We ship the skulls everywhere, especially to art galleries because
of the Southwestern art interest right now. It gets back to the Plains Indian
and how they utilized the buffalo as their lifeblood. They worshipped the
buffalo. You can decorate buffalo skulls in ways that have a lot of spiritual
meaning, but I'm not an Indian and don't profess to know the spiritual
meanings, so I try to stay away from that.
</P>
<P>
A lot of people ask me if bison isn't an endangered species, but they are not.
They were protected by the government back around 1874, so that hunters
wouldn't wipe out the species. The government put the buffalo in different
state parks, and they did very well at preserving the herd. Their numbers got
to be so many, they started selling them to the public, which makes it possible
for people like us to raise them.
</P>
<P>
The only wild herd left is in Yellowstone Park. But they have a disease called
brucellosis, which is a problem, and the herd is getting so big they are
leaving the park. You just can't have a bunch of buffalo roaming around free
into highways and towns. The state of Montana is giving out permits for people
to go shoot them, and it's causing a lot of problems. The buffalo are the ones
suffering, unfortunately.
</P>
<P>
Even the ones on this ranch are wild animals, basically. Some of them will eat
out of your hand, but that's about as friendly as we get. They can be very
dangerous, actually, because they know how to use those horns and they can ruin
you real quick. I've been chased many times, but fortunately I've always gotten
away.

<HEAD>Native Buffalo Weather Drought In Fine Fashion</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HAYES, S.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seemingly unaffected, buffalo roam the
parched South Dakota prairie on America's largest bison ranch while
crops wither and domestic livestock suffer and even die because of
the drought.
   ``Nature sure gave them about everything it takes to survive ...
except the bullet,'' said Roy Houck, who with his late wife,
Nellie, started the Houck Buffalo Ranch nearly three decades ago.
   The hardy bison, native to North America, were hunted to near
extinction in the late 1800s for its skins and meat.
   Houck's buffalo forage on brown grass and linger near water
holes. The ranch has more than 200 ponds, all of which have been
drawn down by the drought, and some are almost dry.
   Depending on the season, 3,000 to 4,500 buffalo inhabit the
50,000-acre ranch that's fenced into 35 pastures.
   After the various herds are allowed to graze in one pasture for
a few weeks, the gate to the next pasture is opened, and the huge
beasts move into the area to resume foraging.
   ``The main breeding herd, we don't feed them anything but
grass,'' said the 83-year-old Houck. ``We try to supplement the
calves a little the first year to give them a boost.''
   Although the drought seems not to have affected the herd, its
impact may show up next spring in a smaller calf crop, Houck said,
explaining that this is the mating season.
   ``These cows won't conceive if they're not in good shape,''
Houck said, glancing over at the rummaging animals about 30 yards
away. ``But so far these cows look pretty good. They're holding
their meat pretty well.''
   The ranch hasn't had a decent rain in more than a year, and
100-plus-degree temperatures have been common all summer.
   But the drought of 1988 is no match yet for the Dust Bowl days
of the 1930s, Houck said.
   ``The dry dust storms of the '30s still haunt me,'' he said.
``It was so dry in the spring of 1934 the grass never even
sprouted.''
   Not that Houck isn't concerned now.
   ``If we're forced into another year of drought, we'll probably
have to graze our pastures a lot longer than we'd like to,'' he
said. ``After going through those dry '30s, you wonder how long
it's going to last.
   ``We've got to be pretty cautious because you can't just load
buffalo on a truck and take them to the sale barn.''
   Buffalo enjoy their freedom, and are handled as little as
possible.
   ``When you get them in confinement, they've only got one thought
in mind and that's to get away,'' Houck said. ``If you happen to be
in the way, that's too bad.''
   Horses once were used to round up the buffalo. Four-wheel drive
trucks are now used.
   ``Buffaloes don't seem to like horses'' and besides can outrun
them, Houck said. One of his sons once ``got his horse knocked
right out from under him'' by an angry buffalo.
   When buffaloes are 2 years old, they are sorted for bulls and
heifers. Most bulls go to slaughter and heifers are kept for
breeding.
   Between 800 and 1,000 are butchered on the ranch each year,
Houck said.
   The market for buffalo meat, which is very low in fat, has been
good, Houck said. ``Right now, we're getting $2 a pound for dressed
buffalo meat.''
   Once an endangered species, buffalo have made a remarkable
comeback, said Mary Duvall, executive director of the National
Buffalo Association. Buffalo numbers are estimated at between
75,000 and 100,000, she said.
   Their numbers reached into the millions before pioneers began
forging westward and found them to be easy prey, dipping to a
historical low near 1,000 head in 1889, Duvall said.
   Realizing the common misconception that buffalo still are
endangered was a hindrance to marketing efforts, Houck helped form
the Fort Pierre-based association, whose members now number about
1,200 buffalo producers.
   The Houcks began ranching by raising cattle. They switched to
buffalo after a March 1966 blizzard that killed more than 200 of
their cattle but not a single buffalo.
   ``They'll just stick their noses down into the snow and eat this
grass, and they'll stay fat on it,'' Houck said. ``I wonder how
they do it, but they do.''

<HEAD>Bison Hunt An Experience Of A Lifetime For Some; For Others, A Disgrace</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVINGSTON, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hunters call it the experience of a
lifetime, a trophy retrieved from the long-ago days of the American
frontier; critics call the century's first large-scale buffalo hunt
a slaughter and a disgrace.
   More than 15 percent of the Yellowstone National Park buffalo
herds have already been killed this winter as they wandered beyond
the park's boundaries to forage, victims of a state law that permits
the shootings to avert the spread of disease to cattle.
   A total of 500 likely will be killed by Monday. And the state was
mailing letters today to 250 hunters, notifying them that they can
come to Paradise Valley to shoot their buffalo if the beasts cross
into Montana.
   ``If any animal, even a bloodthirsty Montana hunter, could be a
part of this and say it's exciting, it's such stupidity that I can't
believe it,'' said Cleveland Amory, president of the Fund for
Animals in New York. ``This is no longer a hunt, it's a massacre.''
   East Coast animal-rights activists are not the only people
critical of the hunt.
   Ellery Merrell, a 73-year-old rancher who has lived his entire
life in Tom Miner Basin about 18 miles north of Yellowstone, said it
was sickening to watch the buffalo fall.
   ``They're about as smart as a damned old milk cow,'' Merrell said
of the bison.
   Merrell said he had nine buffalo on his property Wednesday
morning. He allows no buffalo hunting, but the animals are killed
when they cross the road to other property, he said.
   Its legendary lack of intelligence notwithstanding, the buffalo
fascinates hunters and wildlife lovers equally. The stubborn, shaggy
giants represent the frontier lost 100 years ago.
   Many of the hunters, most of them Montanans who have hunted all
their lives, call the bison hunt an experience they will never
forget.
   U.S. Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont., said he had looked forward to
killing a bison with his .44-magnum pistol, but was unable to get
away for the hunt.
   ``I think that both the National Park Service and the state are
acting in a responsible manner,'' Marlenee said. ``There are too
many buffalo in the park. The harvest of those buffalo is a humane
harvest of animals that would otherwise starve to death.''
   For the state of Montana, however, it's an economic issue.
   About half of Yellowstone's bison carry brucellosis, a disease
which some scientists say could be transmitted to Montana cattle
herds. Brucellosis causes cows to spontaneously abort their calves.
   Herds could be quarantined if the disease should start to spread.
   The Legislature cited that concern when it decided in 1985 to
allow hunters to kill bison entering Montana. The previous winter,
state wildlife officials shot 88 bison in Montana to control
brucellosis.
   But Louisa Willcox of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition dismissed
disease as a justification for the hunt, saying cattle in the area
are vaccinated against it.
   ``Theoretically, it's certainly possible,'' she said of the
disease risk. ``Realistically, it's not.''
   Once numbering in the millions, the buffalo faced extinction by
late in the 19th century. Yellowstone's buffalo herd has rebounded
from fewer than 50 at the turn of the century to about 2,700 last
winter.
   Park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said that even if all 750 hunters
on the state's list were to kill a bison, the survival of the
Yellowstone herds and the species is not at all threatened by the
biggest hunting death toll of the century.
   Anzelmo also said there won't be another year like this one soon.
Large numbers of buffalo are being killed this year because recent
mild winters allowed the survival of many animals that normally
would have died.
   Last year only 39 bison were shot.
   Montana originally chose 250 names of hunters from those who
applied for $200 bison tags at the beginning of the current season
Oct 1. Another 250 were called in January, said Nancy Craft of the
Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department.

   Modern pioneers of bison genetics are
trying to bring back large numbers of the burly beasts as a source
of low-cholesterol meat.
   Using cattle as surrogate mothers, a Cheyenne-based group of
scientists and ranchers plans to breed bison as the animal of the
future for an increasingly health-conscious society.
   ``We see there is nowhere near the number of bison for the
demand,'' said Paul Butler, manager of the group, Livestock
Research and Innovation. ``In order to make any type of dramatic
increase you've got to use the new techniques.''
   Bison were on the brink of extinction at the end of the last
century, when hide-hunters of the Great Slaughter reduced herds of
millions to fewer than 300. Now bison are multiplying slowly,
numbering 80,000 to 100,000, according to the Denver-based American
Buffalo Association.
   The animals also are arousing appetites in the meat market.
   ``Basically the meat's better,'' Butler said, referring to
positive results in recent taste tests. ``It's got more protein and
less fat, and yet it's tender and flavorful.''
   LRI wants to capitalize by getting cattle to give birth to bison
and nurse the calves until they reach the age of slaughter. With
help from the University of Wyoming, researchers have been
artificially inseminating female bisons treated with hormones.
Fertilized embryos are flushed out of the bisons and implanted in
cattle, allowing bison cows to produce more embryos without waiting
to give birth themselves.
   So far cows have rejected all implanted bison embryos, but the
confidence of embryo transfer experts and interest expressed by the
Wyoming Department of Agriculture have fueled optimism.
   ``We've got to perfect the techniques,'' Butler said. ``There
are certain adjustments we have to make when working with bisons.
They are a big, strong, wild animal. They're not easy to handle.''
   Colorado State University professor George Seidel, a
reproductive physiologist who pioneered embryo transfer techniques
with horses, cows, sheep and rabbits, does not doubt the methods
will work with bison.
   ``The technique is not too different from the test-tube baby,''
Seidel said. ``I would expect it would work.''
   Similarly, University of Wyoming Animal Science professor Gary
Moss, who is guiding the LRI project, said he is sure it can be
done.
   Butler has been talking with buyers in New Zealand and
Australia. Besides bison he envisions selling frozen bison embryos
guaranteed to grow for about $10,000 each.
   Not everyone is so enthusiastic.
   Embryo transfer proponent David MacKenzie, a Lousiana State
professor of plant pathology, cautioned, ``We've got to get smarter
about how we do this.''
   And activist Jeremy Rifkin, president of the Foundation on
Economic Trends, warned in an appearance in Wyoming that mixing
breeds in high-technology projects can lead to an undesirable
homogenization of species.
   Nonetheless, a University of Wyoming marketing study suggested
further uses of the bison.
   ``With bison, you can sell everything from the head to the
tail,'' researchers wrote. ``Bison by-products include heads,
robes, skulls, leather goods, wood and jewelry made from their
bones and horns.''
   Bison ranchers are quick to point out the profit potential of an
enterprise that could dramatically increase the number of the
species.
   ``There's an incredible market for it,'' said John Flocchini,
who manages a herd of about 2,500 buffalo on the Durham Ranch near
Gillette. ``I wish we had about five or six times the number of
animals that we have.''
   The Durham ranch sells bison meat in California, where Flocchini
found ``there's just way more demand than there is supply.''
   Moreover, Flocchini and others believe few animals are more
suitable than bison for Wyoming, where harsh weather and predators
pose problems for cattle ranchers.
   A recent study sponsored by the Canadian Wildlife Service found
that bison use nutrients in poor feed grain more efficiently than
cattle. The study concluded that ``bison ranching could be an
alternative to cattle in areas of poor forage and severe winters.''
   Despite these bright economic prospects, Flocchini said he would
be reluctant to dive into bison genetics.
   ``The way things are right now we're happy with the profit
margin that we are making,'' Flocchini said.
   ``I have a hard time messing with Mother Nature. The buffalo is
an animal that's already been too screwed up by human
intervention.''

   A herd of a relative of the buffalo known as the
beefalo roamed onto the Florida Turnpike early Sunday, causing five
accidents and costing the lives of seven of the huge animals,
police said. One motorist was slightly injured.
   ``About 75 to 100 buffalo broke through a hole in the fence on
the Florida Turnpike Extension'' in northwest Dade County about
12:30 a.m., said Florida Highway Patrol Sgt. Alvis Chinn.
   The animals _ part buffalo, part beef cattle _ were part of a
400-head herd kept on a ranch near the turnpike extension, which
borders the Everglades northwest of Miami.
   Five of the beefalo died instantly or nearly so after they
collided with vehicles on the highway, Chinn said. ``I believe that
two other buffalo had to be killed later by the humane society,''
he said.
   The animals caused an estimated $18,000 to $20,000 damage
overall to the cars that collided with them, he said.
   The injured motorist was treated at a local hospital and
released, Chinn said.
   State troopers, animal-control officers, passers-by and workers
from the ranch herded the rest of the animals back home.
   Investigators believe the beefalo left their pasture after horse
thieves cut the fence.
   ``What they're doing apparently is stealing the horses in the
early morning hours, and they're leaving without fixing the
fence,'' Chinn said.
   Police have recorded 29 horse thefts in the area, with seven
horses stolen in the last two weeks, Chinn said.
   Dr. Arnie Oper, owner of the ranch, did not return messages left
on his answering machines Sunday.
   Oper recently made the news by offering any would-be Buffalo
Bills a chance to hunt and kill his animals for $3,500 each _ with
the hunter getting to keep the meat and the hide.

<TEXT>
   The National Park Service said Wednesday it
will try to keep the bison herd in northern Yellowstone National
Park from roaming into Montana, but conceded as many as 200 of the
animals may be shot this winter if they enter the state.
   The killing of nearly 600 Yellowstone buffalo by Montana
ranchers and hunters last winter and spring prompted sharp
criticism from environmentalists and conservationists.
   K.L. Cool, Montana's wildlife director, said Wednesday the state
is trying to av300 animals, so that they can be better
managed and kept out of Montana rangeland.
   Cool and Bob Barbee, superintendent of the park, briefed some
members of Congress as well as environmental and conservation
leaders, on the bison management plan. But they conceded they
haven't figured out how the huge animals will be kept from roaming
out of the park, or how the size of the herd will be reduced.
   ``On the long haul, trying to herd a buffalo doesn't work.
Buffalo are herded where they want to go,'' said Barbee, adding
that efforts will be made to keep the bison in the park by ``gentle
hazing'' and whatever else might work.
   Cool said the state will maintain its policy of shooting any
bison that cross onto Montana state lands until the northern
Yellowstone herd is reduced to about 200 animals. Hunters and
ranchers will be given license to shoot the animals under
supervision from a game warden, he said.
   ``Montana does not want to be viewed as being unrealistic or
uncooperative,'' he said. But he said the state legislature has
required that hunters be free to shoot the bison that roam into the
state.
   Ranchers have complained vigorously that the buffalo cause
damage to property and they fear that they will transmit
brucellosis _ a disease the interferes with reproduction _ to their
cattle. Blood tests have shown that more than half of the bison
killed in Montana last year had brucellosis, he said.
   Most of the vast, federally-owned Yellowstone park lies in
Wyoming but its northern end extends into Montana.
   Wyoming does not allow the shooting of stray bison.
   Yellowstone has about 2,500 bison in three major herds on its
more than 2.4 million acres. But only the northern, or Lamar, herd,
poses a concern to Montana ranchers. Because of a series of mild
winters and other factors, the northern bison herd grew to more
than 900 last year year and most of them roamed along the
Yellowstone River Valley into Montana, where 569 of the animals
were killed last winter and spring.
   That number was unprecedented and prompted criticism from
conservationists and environmentalists. Buffalo have roamed onto
Montana lands for years, but not nearly in the numbers that left
the park last winter.
   According to Montana officials, 190 Yellowstone buffalos were
killed in Montana in 1984 through 1988.
   Barbee said the Park Service will try to develop ways to better
control the size of the northern herd to keep it below 300 animals.
But he said ways to do that ``haven't been worked out.'' He ruled
out the possiblity that hunters would be allowed to hunt the bison
within park boundaries.

   Bison that blunder over the line from
Yellowstone National Park are fair game for hunters again this
winter, but park officials expect the harvest to be smaller than
the 500 taken last season.
   Just how many of the big, furry, dumb beasts will wander outside
the park boundaries to graze depends on how severe the winter is
and how pinched the food supply within the park, officials say.
Hunters aren't allowed to shoot buffalo in the park.
   But statements by a leading zoologist have added weight to the
state's contention that the slaughter of wandering bison is
necessary to prevent the spread of brucellosis among Montana cattle
herds, despite the outrage such killings may produce.
   Dr. Don Davis, a Texas A&amp;M University specialist in the highly
infectious bacterial disease, said previous claims by park
officials that the bison bug could not be transmitted to cattle
have proven false.
   ``Montana has spent in excess of $260 million of federal and
state money to rid the domestic livestock of brucellosis,'' Davis
said. ``So you can see why you're not real crazy to get it back
again.''
   Davis, scientific adviser to a committee on brucellosis in
Montana, Wyoming and Idaho, said the National Park Service could do
more to eradicate brucellosis in the Yellowstone herds by isolating
and slaughtering infected bison.
   But that would mean killing the animals on park property, and
that isn't going to happen, he said.
   ``We're talking big-time political and economic concessions if
they were to do that,'' Davis said.
   The Park Service says that unless scientists can prove
brucellosis was not in the park when Yellowstone was created in
1872, it may classify the bacteria as a ``native species.'' Park
policy forbids eradication of any native species.
   Eradicating brucellosis from the buffalo herd could prove
useless if the organism is native to the area and simply reinfects
the animals, said Yellowstone spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo. And the
buffalo would no longer be a wild, free-roaming species if they
were treated like domestic cattle, she said.
   Brucellosis, also called Bang's disease, causes domestic cattle
to lose their calves. It can cause undulant fever _ characterized
by recurring fever and aching joints _ in humans who get it through
unpasteurized milk or direct contact with infected animals. It
generally can't be transmitted through meat.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department has been trying for decades to
eliminate the disease from commercial herds. So far, USDA says, 27
states are free of brucellosis, with the disease most prevalent in
the South. Brucellosis was eradicated from Montana cattle in 1984.
   Last year, due to food shortages caused by the massive 1988
forest fires and an ensuing harsh winter, hundreds of hungry bison
wandered north onto Montana cattle ranches.
   Hunters were called in to snag strays, and a record 569 bison
were killed. Of these about half were found to be infected with
brucellosis. Park officials counted 418 buffalo in the northern
herd last week and estimate a park total of about 2,000 animals in
the park's three major herds.
   Wyoming, where most of Yellowstone is located, does not permit
the shooting of stray bison.
   Animal rights activists sought unsuccessfully to stop last
year's hunt, which to some was sadly reminiscent of the massive
buffalo slaughter of a century ago that signalled the final taming
of the Wild West.
   Although the bison season legally began Oct. 1, it does not
actually start until and unless bison begin leaving the park. That
usually happens in December, although it may not happen at all if
the winter is mild.
   ``The biologists can't predict whether they'll move as they did
last year,'' Anzelmo said. ``We hope not. Maybe only a few will
leave the park.''
   Previously officials have said they expect no more than 200 to
be harvested this year.
   In preparation for the hunt, 3,217 people have paid $5 to apply
for a bison permit. If summoned by the wildlife department to hunt,
Montanans pay $200 for a license, while non-residents pay $1,000.
   The hunt itself is less than thrilling. Buffalo are accustomed
to seeing humans, and game wardens lead each hunter directly to the
animal to be killed. The hunters shoot at close range at animals
that often are standing still, grazing.

   The ``no trespassing'' sign is out in Montana
_ for the Yellowstone bison, that is.
   And violators will be shot.
   The National Park Service promised Wednesday to try to keep the
northern herd of about 400 bison at Yellowstone National Park from
roaming onto Montana rangeland this winter, as state officials said
that once again they stand ready to shoot bison that wander north
of the park.
   Last winter nearly 600 bison from the Yellowstone herd were shot
and killed by ranchers and hunters under the eyes of Montana game
wardens, prompting an outcry from some environmentalists and animal
rights organizations.
   Montana officials said the ``controlled harvesting'' of
wandering bison is needed to protect ranchers, although the state
and park authorities have reached agreement on an interim bison
management plan within the park.
   ``Montana does not want to be viewed as being unrealistic or
uncooperative,'' said K.L. Cool, the state's director of fish and
wildlife, during a visit to Washington where he sought to explain
the state's policy.
   ``If the bison leave the park they are fair game. ... We're
faced with a threat to our own livestock industry,'' he said. ``The
animal is not welcomed in Montana.''
   Bob Barbee, superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, who
along with Cool met with reporters to discuss plans to deal with
the bison problem this winter, acknowledged that the northern herd
has grown too large. It is down to 400 bison from more than 900
last year, but is still at least 100 animals more than what park
officials and authorities in Montana say is manageable.
   Barbee said he and state officials have agreed on developing a
bison management plan that would limit the northern herd to between
200 and 300 animals. At those numbers it is hoped the herd could be
contained to the park, he said.
   But the park superintendent acknowledged that ways to reduce the
herd have yet to be worked out, short of letting them roam onto
private rangeland and be killed. He said he has no way of assuring
that the bison now in the park will remain within its boundaries by
January and February.
   ``Trying to herd a buffalo doesn't work. Buffalo are herded
where they want to go,'' said Barbee, adding that park workers hope
to influence the big animals by ``gentle hazing,'' perhaps by
helicopter.
   Ranchers have complained vigorously that the buffalo that roam
from the park damage property and threaten to infect cows with
brucellosis, a bacterial disease that causes cows to abort their
calves. Montana has struggled for years and spent an estimated $30
million to rid its cattle of the disease, according to state
officials.
   Although no cases have surfaced where Montana cows have been
infected from bison, Cool attributed that largely to efforts to
keep the bison and cows separated. Blood tests have shown that more
than half of the bison killed in the state last year had the
disease, he said.
   Yellowstone has about 2,500 bison in three major herds on more
than 2.4 million acres. But ranchers are concerned only about the
northern herd that grazes near the Montana border.
   Montana officials, National Park Service officials and many
conservationists agree that the long-term answer to the bison
problem is to control the number of buffalo in the park, so that
they are less inclined to roam for food and better habitat.
   Douglas Inkley, a wildlife resource specialist for the National
Wildlife Federation, suggests one answer might be to reintroduce a
natural predator, the Rocky Mountain wolf, into the park.
   Barbee was careful to stay away from that idea. Proposals to
reintroduce the wolf to Yellowstone have been even more
controversial among area ranchers than has the roaming bison.

than 900 last year and most of them roamed along the Yellowstone
River Valley into Montana where 569 of the animals were killed.
   Barbee said the Park Service will try to develop ways to better
control the size of the northern herd to keep it below 300 animals.
But he said ways to do that ``haven't been worked out'' yet. He
ruled out the possiblity that hunters would be allowed to hunt the
bison within park boundaries.
   Wyoming, on the park's southern edge, does not allow the
shooting of stray bison.

BUFFALOES THRIVING ON SANTA CATALINA UNDER WATCHFUL EYES OF CONSERVANCY

<TEXT>
<P>
Doug Propst maneuvered his Jeep down a dry ravine through scrub oak, prickly
pear cactus and scorched grass. One hundred yards away, dust hung in the air
like baking powder flung skyward.
</P>
<P>
"That's them," he exclaimed, squinting into Santa Catalina Island's shimmering,
mid-morning light.
</P>
<P>
As the vehicle eased over a knoll, the object of his search appeared on the
valley floor. More than 50 large, shaggy buffaloes lounged around the foot of
Cape Canyon Reservoir, drinking, snacking and sunning themselves -- not unlike
the tourists on Avalon's beach 10 miles to the southeast.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grunted Nervously
</P>
<P>
Chocolate brown buffalo cows, with caramel colored calves at their side,
grunted nervously and turned their bearded faces toward the intruders. A bull,
the size of a Volkswagen, rolled on the ground, powdering his coarse, matted
hair with dirt -- nature's version of mosquito repellent. Bath complete, he
pushed to his feet and emitted a belch-like snort before casually rambling up
through the sage scrub. At the top of the rise, he stood poised against the
azure sky.
</P>
<P>
The fact that most people have seen such profiles only on nickels is not lost
on Propst, who is president of the Catalina Conservancy. He has been roaming
these back roads for more than 34 years, but speaks as enthusiastically as
someone seeing the magnificent beasts for the first time.
</P>
<P>
A former Montana rancher, he was hired to run the Santa Catalina Island Co.'s
cattle ranch. But the cattle were soon phased out, and he found himself
caretaker of the island and one of the largest herds of bison in the country
outside of such refuges as Yellowstone National Park and the National Bison
Range in Montana.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Less Than a Thousand
</P>
<P>
The bison count nationally, which numbered an estimated 60 million in the
1800s, dwindled to less than a thousand at the turn of the century as hunters
shot the animals for their hides and meat. Whole carcasses were left across the
plains as hunters took only the gourmet delicacy of the day, buffalo tongue.
Still others were slaughtered for sport.
</P>
<P>
Bison protection laws were enacted in 1907. Since then, the numbers have
increased to about 80,000, according to the American Bison Assn. Of these,
about 1,500 are found in California, most of those on ranches in the southern
part of the state.
</P>
<P>
But on Catalina, the buffaloes, first by circumstances and then by ambitious
conservation efforts, have been given refuge.
</P>
<P>
As is often the case with non-natives who move to California, the first
buffaloes arrived on Catalina to become movie stars. Approximately a dozen
animals were shipped in for cameo appearances in the 1924 silent film, "The
Vanishing American."
</P>
<P>
A few years later, a few more were brought in from their traditional Great
Plains home to strengthen the island herd. Today, the buffaloes still get top
billing in the Catalina Conservancy's extensive preservation program.
</P>
<P>
Since 1919, the 21-mile-long island has been owned by the family of chewing gum
magnate William Wrigley Jr. through the Catalina Island Co. In 1975, the
company deeded more than 86% of the island, or about 42,000 acres, to the
nonprofit, private conservancy to preserve and restore the island's plants and
animals and control recreation use. Financing for the programs comes mostly
from a stock portfolio donated by the Wrigley family and private donations.
</P>
<P>
Much of the wildlife was introduced to the island by settlers and later by
state game officials.
</P>
<P>
As Propst drove through rugged Cape Canyon on a recent morning, animals
nonchalantly showed themselves. A black and white feral pig and her piglet
trotted up a hillside, a wild turkey ambled through a small grove of red barked
manzanita and swallows dived onto ponds to scoop up bugs.
</P>
<P>
It is rutting season, and the buffaloes are gathered near ponds and streams in
larger herds, sometimes as many as 100 cows, yearlings and calves band under
the watchful eyes of bulls who have won the harem. At one watering hole, a
large bull with ribs showing lumbered by. Usually weighing about two tons, the
bulls often lose two or three hundred pounds this time of year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Pushed From Herd
</P>
<P>
Here and there, solitary old bulls will be seen, pushed out of the herd by the
younger bulls. "See that old guy. He's been in a lot of wars," Propst said,
pointing out a rangy animal with one horn broken off and the other chipped.
</P>
<P>
Some live to be more than 30 years old.
</P>
<P>
At Middle Ranch, the conservancy's working ranch, dozens of young buffaloes are
lured into corrals each year and shipped to ranchers for breeding stock.
Without such measures, the island would be overrun.
</P>
<P>
The conservancy staff does no hands-on work with the buffaloes unless there is
an emergency. Herding them is out of the question.
</P>
<P>
"You can drive cattle where you want to go. And you can drive buffaloes where
they want to go," Propst said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled one bull that the staff tried to snare in hopes of removing a long
strand of wire tangled around his leg.
</P>
<P>
"We tried to herd the bull through the brush where one of our men, a good
roper, was hiding in bushes on horseback. Well that animal got one sniff of
what was awaiting and took off -- buffaloes can make horses look like they are
tied to the ground -- we never saw him again."

<TEXT>
   Midwest buffalo buyers got a chance to place their
bids at an unlikely auction site this week: Fermilab _ the only U.S.
atom-smashing facility with a herd of the proud beasts.
   While scientists rammed high-energy atomic particles into each
other underground in the world's most powerful accelerator, farmers
and ranchers from Illinois and five other states on Thursday placed
bids from a flatbed truck for 64 animals being sold so Fermilab
could thin its herd before spring calving.
   ``I knew it was going to be a good sale, and it was,'' said Dan
Shepherd, president of the National Buffalo Association and owner of
320 of the animals at his farm in Clifton Hill, Mo.
   Shepherd said he was thankful the animals commanded high prices
at the auction _ an average of $1,145 each and a total of $73,300
for all 64, according to Fermilab.
   Rudy Dorner, land manager for federally owned Fermilab, or Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory, said the facility has been in the
buffalo business on a break-even basis for about 20 years.
   ``Dr. Robert Wilson, our first director, was born in Wyoming and
loved the outdoors. And he felt bison, as representative (animals)
of the prairie in Illinois, would be a good thing to have,'' Dorner
said. ``And his idea has proven very, very popular.''
   Hundreds of visitors come on warm-weather weekends to see
Fermilab's herd, normally comprising about 80 animals, at the lab's
90-acre site 40 miles southwest of Chicago, he said.
   Besides their popularity as symbols of Americana, bison are
growing in value as food source for meat-eaters, Dorner said.
   ``It's a very healthy meat, very low in cholesterol,'' he said.
``And it's very good meat.''
   Contrary to popular belief, the bison is no longer an endangered
species. About 120,000 of them live in the United States, up from
around 1,000 at the turn of the century, Shepherd said.
   ``It's an alternative agriculture. The buffalo business has been
pretty good to us over the years. It's been a solid moneymaker,''
Shepherd said.
   Dorner said Fermilab, with more land than most other particle
accelerator facilities, is the only one in the country with a herd
of buffalo.

<HEADLINE>  CANADA'S WAR OVER THE BUFFALO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     So Beaver, other natives in this subarctic wilderness and environmentalists
around the world are coming to the defense of the 3,500 buffalo in and around
Wood Buffalo National Park -- the largest free-roaming herd in the world.;
The bison have been threatened with mass destruction by the Canadian
government because many of them are afflicted with tuberculosis and
brucellosis, diseases that could scar the lungs of cattle or cause them to
abort. The disease is transmitted by physical contact and inhalation.;    As
cattle and buffalo habitats slowly converge, the Canadian beef industry has
been calling for the elimination of the diseased bison, and the federal
Agriculture Department agrees. Under the plan, the bison herd would be
exterminated, then slowly rebuilt with disease-free beasts.;    However, a
recent outcry forced the government to back off from its extermination plan.
Instead, federal officials appointed a 19-member board, which has begun
meeting to devise an alternate plan.;    The Indians fear the killing of the
bison because they are a source of food and are a cultural icon. They and
others also noted the irony of the government's original plan. Wood Buffalo
Park was established in the 1920s as a haven for the bison, which numbered 60
million in North America before invaders hunted them down to mere thousands.;
  Reaching a consensus on the bison's future is sure to be difficult. The
natives, according to Beaver, favor testing the buffalo, segregating the
diseased animals and regenerating the herd with the healthy ones.;    "It's
ecologically, environmentally and economically the best way," Beaver said.;
The beef industry thinks there's no other way but to eliminate the diseased
herd, according to Jim Graham, president of the Canadian Cattlemen's
Association. That is how ranchers deal with partly tainted cattle herds.;
"We believe in disease eradication," said Graham. "If it is necessary to
depopulate, then we depopulate. That would apply to all species.";    Either
plan will be costly. Cost of the mass-slaughter option was estimated at $17.8
million. Beaver said the natives' plan might cost $26.7 million to $71.2
million.;    The diseases were introduced in the 1920s, when nearly 7,000
buffalo from central Alberta were brought north.;    Henry Beaver said he
shoots two buffalo a year to get meat for his wife and five children. He wants
the buffalo preserved:;    "It is food on our table, but it has a spiritual
value, too, because it shows our relationship with the earth. We know that our
people will get stronger spiritually if we help the buffalo."  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Renegade Buffalo Corraled In Roundup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twelve of 14 renegade buffalo were rounded up on a
south Florida range _ bordering Interstate 75 and Florida's
Turnpike _ by latter-day trailhands on all-terrain motorcycles.
   The two bison still at large, a female calf and a bull, are the
last of 250 that escaped in March from a livestock ranch near Miami
when horse rustlers cut through a fence, said Dr. Arnold Oper,
their owner.
   The roundup didn't come off without incident. A 30-year-old
television reporter, Albert ``Bud'' Fraga, tumbled seven feet onto
his head from a swamp buggy, and was reported in serious condition
Monday with a broken sternum and two cracked vertebrae.
   The roundup of the buffalo, also known as bison, began at dawn
Sunday in 240 acres of marsh and pasture land near the border of
Dade and Broward counties.
   Oper, 64, risked jail for himself and confiscation of his
animals if he did not round up the renegades this weekend,
according to officials with the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission. He had made several efforts to capture the animals.
   Since the breakout, the 800- to 900-pound animals have
frightened golfers at the Hollywood Lakes Country Club in Pembroke
Pines and startled motorists on I-75 and Florida's Turnpike.
   On Aug. 16, a Florida Highway Patrol dispatcher hit one of the
buffalo while driving on the interstate, killing the animal and
demolishing her car.
   About 35 volunteers on seven all-terrain motorcycles and four
swamp buggies drove the buffalo herd west through scrub myrtle and
Florida holly and into a camouflaged pen where they were coaxed
back into a cattle trailer for a trip back to the livestock ranch.

RANCHERS SWITCH TO RAISING OSTRICHES, DEER AND BUFFALO

<P>
The entrepreneurial spirit thrives in the U.S. livestock industry, with farmers
and ranchers raising new and exotic livestock.
</P>
<P>
In Minnesota, domesticated deer are raised in a feedlot where cattle were once
fed, and ostriches roam on a Texas ranch next to quarter horses and
Thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
"The ostrich industry is over 100 years old, but not in the United States,"
said Cooper Campbell, who started raising the birds on his Odessa, Tex., horse
ranch three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Campbell expects in four to six years that there will be enough commercially
raised ostriches to sustain markets for the meat, feathers and hide. Until
then, the best market will be for breeding stock.
</P>
<P>
Newborn and young ostriches are expensive, costing $6,000 for a pair of
3-month-old chicks and escalating to $45,000 to $75,000 for a pair of
3-year-olds, Campbell said. However, prices should drop sharply once the
industry matures and populations increase, he said.
</P>
<P>
A lot of economic hurdles face these fledgling livestock industries. Markets
have to be developed for the meat, hides and breeding stock, and government
standards for the meat must be established.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has a large commercial ostrich industry, and meat from the giant
birds is marketed throughout Africa and Europe, said Campbell, who is a
director of the American Ostrich Assn.
</P>
<P>
"It is a lean, red meat that more closely resembles beef than anything else,"
he said. It is low in cholesterol and fat and can be processed into steaks and
roasts.
</P>
<P>
Better-established in the United States is the market for ostrich hides, which
are used for jackets, boots, belts and shoes.
</P>
<P>
In Minnesota, Dennis Gibson's feedlots were empty for six years after he quit
the cattle-feeding business in 1981. Then in 1987 he began commercially raising
fallow deer, a domesticated Asian deer that is more disease resistant than the
white tail and mule deer indigenous to the United States.
</P>
<P>
His herd of 250 deer is primarily for breeding purposes, and he regularly sells
stags to other breeders.
</P>
<P>
"The deer are flighty but have no trouble adapting to the northern climate," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In five years, Gibson hopes that supplies will be sufficient to develop and
sustain marketing channels for venison. Local cattle slaughter plants presently
process the small amount of commercial venison on the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The University of Minnesota extension service has supported deer farming with a
symposium and educational material. Deer farming is successful in New Zealand,
where there is a commercial herd of 700,000 head, and the industry is growing
by 30% a year, the university said.
</P>
<P>
"In the U.S., there isn't enough product (venison) available to establish a
market, but we take 25% of the venison New Zealand exports," said R.M. Jordan,
a University of Minnesota extension animal scientist.
</P>
<P>
Venison contains 3% to 4% fat, compared to 35% for high-quality beef, Gibson
said.
</P>
<P>
Still in its infancy is the commercial raising of native American bison,
commonly known as the American buffalo. The University of Minnesota extension
service reports about 90,000 head in the United States, of which 85% is under
private ownership.
</P>
<P>
Demand for bison meat has increased in some areas because of its leanness and
perceived lower cholesterol content.

   Where the Buffalo Don't Roam

   Yellowstone National Park, Wyo.
   The solitary buffalo crossed an open field near Rescue
Creek Trail. Enormous, old, he walked stiff-legged and
without hurry. His massive head with its thick, curling,
almost-black hair bobbed up and down, sniffing the earth,
delicately picking up bits of grass to eat. On his shoulders
and hump the curling hair had turned pale cinnamon, as it
often does in old bulls, while his slender back and hips were
the same deep brown they had always been. Noble ice-age
beast, he ambled through sagebrush, carrying in his ancient
heart all the centuries of his existence. He has been in
Yellowstone since the last glaciers left, 10,000 years ago.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Rescue Creek trailhead is not far from the park's
north entrance, at Gardiner, and the boundary between the
park and the state of Montana. Would the old bull cross to be
greeted by a hunter's gun? A hunt takes place when there is a
chance buffalo (more correctly, bison) will wander onto
Montana ranchlands. Because they can carry brucellosis, which
causes cattle to abort if they come into contact with the
fresh afterbirth of an aborted bison fetus, ranchers are
understandably concerned if bison cross the boundary.
   But buffalo do not recognize boundaries. Their "captivity"
inside the park goes against their migratory nature. When
stressed by severe winters, nature prevails. They have left
the park periodically over the years, although never in such
great numbers as two winters ago when 569 -- half the herd --
were shot, nor in the presence of such media coverage.
   It was February when I watched the old bull. There was a
sense of spring in the air. Perhaps, I thought, we'll make it
through the winter with no hunt beyond the one buffalo shot
early in the season. But within a few weeks there was new
snow, and 20 bison left the park near West Yellowstone. The
hunt was on, and off, and on again as bison wandered back and
forth across the border. "Probably the number of animals
taken this year will be quite small," said John Cada,
regional wildlife manager for the Montana Department of Fish,
Wildlife and Parks. "If you can sting them a little when they
first come out," he explained, "they're more apt to go back.
If you let them lounge around, they begin to think of the
area as home. It's easier to keep them out of a new area than
run them out of home."
   In mid-March three bison were shot. Animal-rights
activists were on the scene to disrupt the event. Two
protesters were arrested, one on charges of misdemeanor
assault, the other for interfering with a lawful hunt. The
activists called their cohorts' behavior "inappropriate," but
reiterated their belief that the real crime is killing bison.
After that hunt the protesters tried herding bison back into
Yellowstone. Park officials warned them away, saying the
attempt constituted harassment of wild animals, which could
not be permitted in the park.
   It probably wouldn't have had much effect anyway. While
some bison can be moved for short periods of time, basically
bison will go only where bison want to go. Numerous attempts
to keep them in the park -- hazing, cattle guards, fences,
recorded wolf-howls, sirens, tin-can rattles and cracker
shells, flashing lights, rubber bullets -- have not worked.
Besides that, any plan designed to keep animals in the park
runs counter to park policy of keeping animals wild by
allowing them natural movement through their natural habitat.
   "Just as no one is saying we should keep all the elk in
the park, no one should be saying bison must be kept in the
park," said Ed Lewis, executive director of the Bozeman-based
Greater Yellowstone Coalition. "Yellowstone has the only
free-roaming bison population and any management plan must
allow for it to continue."
   GYC has been instrumental in initiating the possibility of
a viable management plan by bringing together the Park
Service, U.S. Forest Service and the Dept. of Fish, Wildlife
and Parks, the agencies that deal with bison in the
ecosystem. They also have succeeded in getting the agencies'
agreement to maintain a core herd of 200 to 300 bison,
enough, according to park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo, that
visitors will see bison herds in the park.
   Shooting a buffalo isn't really terrific sport. It's sort
of like shooting a cow. "They are pastoral animals," said
Bozeman sculptor Brian Persha, who is outraged at the hunt's
denial of the buffalo's nature. Mr. Persha, who feels that
GYC's attempt to find an alternative to the hunt must be
supported, is donating proceeds from the sale of his work to
them. Making multiples of his sculpture for the first time,
Mr. Persha has created three bronzes, one of them a small,
reclining buffalo. Resting, waiting, eternal, his buffalo is
an eloquent statement of that great animal's quiet power.
   It is also one approach to what, at times, seems an
impossibly polarized problem -- to shoot or not to shoot.
"Population control has to happen," the wildlife department's
Mr. Cada said, "either by ranger or other hunters, or
rounding them up and selling them to the slaughterhouses.
Thirty years ago we were doing the same thing with elk. For a
similar reason. We didn't have a place for those Yellowstone
elk. Even though it took us a few years, our goal was to
acquire key pieces of winter range. We'll still hunt elk, but
instead of a firing line at the park boundary, we can manage
them.
   "I look at this as an opportunity. Things have to be major
to get support and we're talking about a major commitment
from society. We hope that society says, `Hey, I'm willing to
put my money where my mouth is and authorize Congress to buy
range out of the park.'"
   Leaving the old bull at Rescue Creek, I drove on to the
Lamar Valley. Broad, wild, silent, filled with light and
time, the valley opens before you as you come out of Lamar
Canyon like some primeval dream of land. It was here that the
Buffalo Ranch was established in 1907, five years after
captive herds of plains buffalo were introduced into
Yellowstone in an attempt to reestablish a wild herd. The
remnant of the wild mountain buffalo that had always lived in
Yellowstone mingled and prospered under the improved
protection that came with the newcomers. The experiment
successful, the ranch was disbanded in the 1950s. Lamar is
one of three winter ranges now used by Yellowstone's buffalo.
   The Lamar River ran dark and sparkling between banks of
wind-polished snow. Groups of buffalo were spread along its
length, their tracks crisscrossing the broad flats extending
south and east of the river. Wherever the animals had
stopped, the snow was churned, scuffed, pocked and pawed.
Buffalo are as evident where they are not as where they are.
   The road through Lamar is one of the few park roads that
is plowed. Not many cars had passed as I watched the buffalo,
but as I drove back, I found myself in a traffic jam.
Buffalo, larger than my car, walked up and down the middle of
the road, then ran across it, stopped on the opposite side,
returned to the road, crossed back and, finally, ran a few
feet alongside the road before disappearing from my view
behind a small rise. How thoroughly this place is theirs, I
thought.

<HEAD>A Water Buffalo In Every Pot? Low-Cholesterol Breed Gains Popularity</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>

   High in exotic appeal and low in
cholesterol, the water buffalo is hitting health-food shelves and
haute-cuisine menus.
   To father-and-son ranchers Oley and Tom Olson, the smelly,
unsightly, ox-like animals are gentle giants with the potential to
alleviate world hunger.
   To Mitch Niayesh, vice president Polarica Game U.S.A., Bubalus
bubalis is pleasure for pampered palates _ at up to $17 a pound.
   ``I always have a freezer full of it,'' said Hugh Popenoe,
director of the University of Florida Center for Tropical
Agriculture. Popenoe, who is studying expansion of the breed, also
has acquired a taste for rich mozzarella made from water buffalo
milk. ``And the people who've eaten the hamburger say it's much
better than beef burgers, because they don't shrink,'' he said.
   ``A lot of people say the hamburgers are outstanding.''
   There are hurdles, however, to water buffalo reaching an
important place in the American diet. First, there's the small
supply _ there are only about 3,000 of the homely critters in the
United States. And regulations make it costly and time-consuming to
import animals from Asia, Australia and other sources.
   Nonetheless, Polarica, a San Francisco gourmet food wholesaler,
managed to sell about 20,000 pounds last year, Niayesh said. When
domestic sources ran short, he brought the dark-colored, lightly
marbled goods from Australia.
   His customers ranged from golf and country clubs to swank
restaurants and hotels; he sent 30 pounds to a Los Angeles bash
honoring the king of Sweden.
   ``These are middle- to higher-income people. First, they wanted
to have something different. Then they realized it's a good meat.
Now they're using it where they used to use beef,'' he said. He now
sells about 400 pounds a week of water buffalo tenderloin, the most
preferred cut.
   The `21' Club in New York has served water buffalo on special
occasions for regular customers, although it isn't a regular
offering, said Don Krindler, senior vice president of the posh
restaurant.
   ``As people become aware that they have got to watch their
cholesterol, they are going to turn to an alternative,'' he said.
``If it can be marketed or prepared right, who knows?
   ``Maybe we'll have water buffalo burgers _ grilled, as opposed to
fried.''
   During blind taste tests, Popenoe said, ``It comes out tasting
about the same as beef, or people can't tell the difference.''
   The Olsons, who tend 19, say there are many differences between
buffalo on the hoof and the Herefords on their ranch near the
Arkansas-Texas border.
   ``The water buffalo have 50 percent less cholesterol, 25 percent
less fat, but, we think, a lot more intellect,'' said Oley, 67, who
retired to the ranch from a Chicago lumber business.
   Tom, 30, said it's easy to think of the water buffaloes as pets,
since the family has concentrated on breeding to build the herd, and
not slaughtering.
   ``They'd come right in the house and watch TV. They are dirty and
scruffy, but so gentle, docile. They're just a fabulous animal,''
said Oley.
   ``They seem to grow about twice as fast as our cattle,'' said Tom.
   They also cost about twice as much _ $1,500 for a water buffalo
bull vs. about $700 for a Hereford bull. A pregnant water buffalo
brings about $3,500.
   Offsetting the purchase price, the Olsons say, is low maintenance.
   ``They've never been sick because they're so sturdy, and they eat
about anything _ leaves, weeds, any kind of grass, whatever,'' but
``it's just a drain right now. We aren't making anything from
them,'' he said.
   ``It could be a big money-maker some day,'' Popenoe said. ``There
is a sizable population that would be interested in meat with lower
cholesterol. The largest-growing segment of the U.S. food market is
exotic and ethnic, and this would fit nicely.''

   Hey, Buffalo Bill,
   Why Do You Kill?

   Michael Pearce's Jan. 9 Leisure &amp; Arts article, "Where the
Buffaloes Roam," or, more appropriately, "Won't You Come
Home, Buffalo Bill?," is another approach to cleansing guilt
by rationalizing the final phase of hunting -- the killing
portion. And with every paper on justifying the need to kill,
there is a paper expressing the ridiculous thesis of such a
farce.
   I am not a "weed eater" or animal-rights fanatic. So what
grinds me about Mr. Pearce's article? It's the contention
that hunting farm-raised buffaloes by men dressed in
buckskins and using black-powder rifles somehow overcomes the
true nature of the hunt. Hunting and killing animals is an
issue of control, of playing God over a living thing, and
nothing more. Unless, of course, you are stranded in the
middle of the wilderness and it is a means of survival.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   Roy English of the story went to get meat. Sure, right.
And low in cholesterol -- hey, that's important. Don't get me
wrong. When I hunted as a boy, I was taught not to shoot
anything I didn't plan to clean and cook. But I didn't hunt
with the idea that I was reliving history or putting food on
the table. It was for sport, and that is what hunting
buffaloes is. If hunting a herd of ranch-raised animals can
be considered much of a hunt. At least I assume that the ones
on the Smoky River Buffalo Ranch are wilder than the ones
that stroll out of Yellowstone National Park.
   The article should have been written for one of the
hunting magazines; then Mr. Pearce could have gotten the
romance for his article that it justly deserved. The article
may have been appreciated in this paper had it ended one
sentence before Darrell Wuertz's "humane insurance shot." But
Mr. Pearce has a right to submit his work to anyone. And this
paper has the right to print what it wants. Wilbur Williams
is within his rights to have a hunting ranch. He can stock it
with buffaloes or Holstein cows. Say, there's an idea.
   How many of you hunters out there ever got to sit around
the campfire and talk about the Holstein cow you brought
down? As for Mr. English, he could take a pail and stool with
him, milk the cow, then shoot it.

<TEXT>
   Ale and Carol Janssen have a home where
the buffalo roam.
   A pen behind their house in Pinckney is home to 11 of the shaggy
critters who once thundered across the American plains. Another 11
graze at their 200-acre farm in Kalkaska, further north.
   These reminders of the Old West are not for show. They're for
supper, said Janssen, who now eats buffalo instead of beef and
markets what he doesn't eat.
   ``The supply (is low) and demand is great. There's not enough in
existence,'' Janssen said.
   The public is acquiring a taste for buffalo, the Janssens say.
   ``It tastes like a good grade of beef,'' Mrs. Janssen said,
noting buffalo meat is lower in fat and higher in protein than beef.
``If somebody would give it to you and didn't tell you, you'd say,
`this is delicious.'''
   Janssen said he got into the buffalo business in 1976 with three
animals he ordered after seeing a herd near Sterling, Colo. By 1991,
he plans to have a herd of 60.
   The grass-grazing animals need less care than cattle, but require
more caution because of their size, he said. The bull in his herd is
six feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 2,600 pounds.
   ``They do dominate their aens raise the buffalo for slaughter, a
6-month-old calf has become Mrs. Janssen's friend.
   The 200-pound calf, called Charlie, was born with a fractured hip
and was cared for by Michigan State University veterinary students
for a month. When he was returned to his mother, the cow rejected
him so Mrs. Janssen feeds him goat's milk from a bottle.
   Although young Charlie someday will tip the scales at 1,600
pounds or more, for now he nuzzles Mrs. Janssen and tries to lick
her face.
   The Janssens are among 45 Michigan farmers who are members of the
National Buffalo Association, according to Kim Dowling, editor of
the group's ``Buffalo!'' magazine.
   Michigan is home to more than 1,000 privately owned buffalo, she
said.
   Huge herds once crisscrossed the plains, but the numbers of the
beasts had shrunk to 540 in the late 1800s, Dowling said. Public
concern over the future of the creatures prompted state and federal
parks to begin building herds in the 1920s and 1930s, she said.
   Americans began raising buffalo for slaughter in the 1950s and
now 60,000 are held in private herds nationwide, Dowling said.
Another 20,000 belong to public herds at state and federal public
parks.
   The National Buffalo Association claims about 1,000 members
nationwide, Dowling said, including 37 restaurants that feature
buffalo on their menus.
   One of those is Dominique's in Washington, which offers buffalo
sausage with fresh mushrooms and bordelaise sauce as an appetizer
for $7.95.
   ``People aren't afraid of it, ns, she said.
   Janssen's buffalo end up in the meat case at Janssen's party
store in Owendale, Mich., run by his brother, George.
   One buffalo yields at least 800 pounds of burgers, steaks and
roasts, said Audene Janssen, George's wife. Ground buffalo sells for
$3.39 a pound, she said.
   The association's magazine reports sale prices of buffalo, which
Carol Janssen said the family uses as a guide in setting the price
for the meat they sell.
   Janssen said he's yet to turn a profit on his herd and won't be
able to make a living from buffalo until his herd grows.
   In the meantime, Janssen said the animals are a mini-tourist
attraction, with passersby stopping to photograph them.
   ``When they get to running and jumping and the children start to
laugh, that makes it all worthwhile,'' he said.

   Russell Springs, Kan. -- The two hunters left the warmth
of the campfire in the grove of towering cottonwoods and
stepped out onto the vastness of the native prairie. A
serpentine path led them around the pointed leaves of yucca
cactus, around brittle sagebrush and impenetrable clusters of
tumbleweed.
   As they walked across the calm, sundrenched grassland I
noticed that one of the pair was shaking. "Cold?" I asked.
"No," he replied, "excited to be here." Not a sportsman in
the world could blame him.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The Kansas prairie that surrounded him is home to some of
America's most magnificent whitetail and mule deer. Where the
habitat is right there are antelopes, wild turkeys and
countless coveys of quails and pheasants. Without a doubt,
it's some of the finest game country that can be found today.
   Yet the hunters were looking for a hunt of the past rather
than the present. The short walk that took them to the top of
a small rise, in a way, took them back a dozen decades or
more. It was then that they saw it -- a half-ton, humpbacked
animal cloaked in a thick brown and chestnut coat, wearing a
pair of short, ebony horns on its massive head.
   A stalk was planned and the hunters were off. Though
unusual in modern times, a buffalo hunt is something that the
plains above the Smokey Hill River had seen countless times
through the centuries.
   "This used to be some of the finest buffalo country in
America," said Wilbur Williams, as he looked out over the
prairies of his Smoky River Buffalo Ranch, which offers
guided hunting expeditions. The main season runs from
November through March. "They were here in the millions; old
accounts tell of herds stretching as far as the eye could
see."
   And according to Mr. Williams, a self-trained naturalist
and historian, the vast herd attracted a variety of hunters
throughout the centuries. While roaming the ranch as both a
boy and a man, Mr. Williams has found tools and weapons from
such past hunters as the Pawnee, Cheyenne and Arapaho tribes.
   The grounds that now make up his buffalo ranch were
utilized by white hunters as well. Trappers headed for the
mountains and travelers headed for the promise of California
or Oregon relied on the buffalo for a source of food. Those
who followed, however, relied on them as a source for
money-making hides.
   "This area was at the heart of the big buffalo-hunting era
of the late 1860s and 1870s," said Mr. Williams. "There was a
lot of history made around here. Bill Cody and Bill Comstock
had their famous buffalo-hunting contest just north of here
to see who could use the name Buffalo Bill. And over the
years I've found at least two shoe boxes full of old
cartridges left behind by the hide hunters."
   The original herds and the hide hunters disappeared
roughly a century ago. A lifelong love of the big animals
caused Mr. Williams to bring them back. With a careful
breeding program and supplementation, the native Kansan has
reestablished a self-sustaining herd here. And the hunters
have returned, hunting an experience, trying to relive a life
of old.
   "The main reason I came was to fulfill a lifelong dream,"
said Darrell Wuertz, one of the pair of hunters. "Ever since
I was little I dreamed about walking the ground where the
buffalo lived and taking one with a black-powder rifle in the
way that the mountain men would have so many years ago. For
someone like me, just being here is worth the drive from
Indiana."
   That weekend eight hunters from a halfdozen states had
traveled to Mr. Williams's ranch for the same reasons as Mr.
Wuertz. All but one hunted with replicas of original
percussion or flintlock muzzleloaders, most of which they'd
built with their own hands. Some even walked the plains in
buckskin clothing.
   Other groups have pitched tepees and camped among the
cottonwoods. Mr. Williams contributes to the realism by
serving meals of buffalo around an open campfire. He and his
assistants wear dress of the period, and hunters who choose
to can hunt with one of Mr. Williams's original Sharps
"buffalo rifles."
   No matter what the gun of choice, those who come meet with
success. Though an animal of surprising quickness and speed,
the buffalo has never been as challenging as, say, whitetail
deer. The two hunters eventually were able to sneak within
range in the midst of the expansive prairie. Roy English was
first to fire and Mr. Wuertz was quick to add a humane
insurance shot.
   But the day was far from over for Messrs. English and
Wuertz. They, Mr. Williams and an associate labored far into
the afternoon. When they were done they had the skin removed
and readied to be made into a massive buffalo robe. More
importantly, the meat was trimmed and ready for the trip back
to Indiana.
   "That's another big reason why we came," said Mr. English.
"We're going to be taking home meat and you can bet we're
going to use it all."
   The two hunters will not only be eating a lot, they'll
also be eating well. According to Mr. Williams, the
three-year-old bull will produce close to 500 pounds of
superbly delicious meat. As an added bonus, it's a meat that
the hunters can feast on to their heart's content. "Buffalo
is a meat that's high in protein but very lean," said Mr.
Williams. "It's not zero-percent cholesterol, but it's much
less than beef. It's a very healthy meat."

<HEAD>Parks Chief Says Don't Feed Starving Yellowstone Elk, Bison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KUGLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Feeding hay to elk and
bison starving in this fire-scarred preserve could do more harm than
good, and even if many animals die the herds are in no danger of
extinction, says the head of the National Park Service.
   The reduction in natural grazing by last summer's drought and
huge fires, combined with a severe winter, have driven elk and bison
out of the park into southern Montana, where the state is allowing
hunters to kill hundreds of the animals. The state claims they carry
disease that could infect livestock.
   In the small town of Gardiner, Mont., just north of the park,
starving elk are eating hay donated by sympathetic people, along
with hedges and trees. Small herds of elk and buffalo have
congregated in parking lots.
   ``They are skinny and eak,'' said Trudi Taylor, who joined with
others in town to raise money to feed the animals after one elk died
in her yard. She admits the winter will probably claim older
animals, but hopes to save younger cows that will soon calve.
   ``In this town, most of the people make their money off these
animals. At least they could give a little back,'' she said,
referring to the area's popularity with hunters and tourists.
   But feeding hay to elk allows diseases to spread among the
animals when they gather in tight groups at feeding stations, park
service director William Penn Mott said at a news conference
Saturday at Yellowstone's headquarters.
   And if park rangers started feeding hay to elk in Yellowstone,
the expensive practice could go on forever as the animals become
dependent on it, as they have at the national elk refuge at Jackson,
Wyo., south of Yellowstone, Mott said.
   Mott was sent on a fact-finding trip to Yellowstone by new
Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan following national publicity about
the hunting in Montana and high mortality in the park's northern elk
herd _ the largest migratory elk herd in the world.
   Mott said one option he thought he could support was to have the
federal government acquire more winter game range north of the park
in Montana. The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation of Missoula, Mont.,
announced Friday that it will start a special fund toward expanding
winter range for Yellowstone's elk herd.
   Mott also said he will ask the Park Service and other state and
federal agencies and conservation groups to help draft a report on
Yellowstone's total wildlife management program, which he called
fragmented.
   ``We will look at the total ecosystem and how to best manage
wildlife,'' he said. ``If land is being overgrazed, we should look
at this.''
   Both elk and bison populations in Yellowstone are near all-time
highs because several mild winters before this year allowed more
animals to survive than in normal years.
   Almost 500 of Yellowstone's 2,700 bison have been shot in Montana
and 250 additional permits have been issued. And more than 2,350 elk
from Yellowstone's northern herd of 19,000 were shot by Montana
hunters this winter. Last year, only 39 bison were shot in Montana's
hunt.
   Inside Yellowstone, rangers have counted more than 300 elk
carcasses.
   This year's hunting has been denounced as a slaughter by such
animal-welfare activists as Cleveland Amory of New York, president
of the Fund for Animals.
   Mott repeated his support for reintroduction of wolves into
Yellowstone, not only because wolves could help keep big-game
populations in balance, ``but because wolves represent the West and
part of biological diversity.''
   That proposal is strongly opposed by ranchers outside the park.
   Mott said Yellowstone's herds are in no danger of extinction, but
in some areas visitors may see fewer animals this year.
   ``Even if winter kill (of elk) is 50 percent, there would still
be a core that would rapidly reproduce,'' he said.
   ``Bison have the biological capacity of recovering from low
numbers,'' said Mary Meagher, a Yellowstone research biologist,
noting that the park's bison started from a remnant population of 22
animals.
   Montana officials said they authorized the bison hunt because
about half of Yellowstone's bison carry the disease brucellosis,
which causes domestic cows to abort their calves.
   But Meagher said her best information from Montana's state
veterinarian was that no cases of brucellosis in Montana had ever
been traced to Yellowstone animals. She also pointed out that
ranchers vaccinate their calves against the disease.

THE BUTCHER: BUFFALO ROAM AGAIN -- NOW TO U.S. TABLE

The American bison is back. There are more buffalo grazing on the grasses of
this nation now than there have been since the mid-1800s. According to the
American Bison Assn. in Denver and the National Buffalo Assn. in Ft. Pierre,
S.D., there are between 60,000 to 80,000 head of bison in America and another
10,000 to 20,000 in southern Canada.
</P>
<P>
That's not many compared to the estimated 60 million that inhabited North
America when Columbus discovered it in 1492, or even compared to the 20 million
that still roamed the Great Plains in the 1850s. But compared to the 254 that
existed in the entire world (one was in a zoo in Calcutta, India) in 1910, I
think it is safe to say the American bison is making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
There seem to be three major reasons why the past few years have seen an
accelerated growth in people's interest in the buffalo, according to several of
the producers I have talked to across the country.
</P>
<P>
One is the tremendous interest that has developed in the past decade or so
(since the Bicentennial in 1976, I think) in American cuisine.
</P>
<P>
Whatever that is, it must include the American bison. The only other meat
products that I can think of truly indigenous to America are the country ham
and feedlot beef.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More Protein, Less Cholesterol
</P>
<P>
The second reason has to do with perceived or perhaps real, but in any case
well publicized, health benefits of buffalo meat. Buffalo is reported to have
25% to 30% more protein than most other domestic meats, less than half the
cholesterol and about one third the fat and calories. I'm not sure I "buy" all
that, but then I have come to suspect any nutritional claim made by almost
anybody who wants to sell me something. What I do buy when I buy buffalo is
taste. Buffalo steak comes about as close to being what a good steak should be
as any steak I've had in a long time.
</P>
<P>
I find it interesting that all of the millions of American bison that were
slaughtered on the Western Plains in the late 1800s were not killed for their
meat. It was the buffalo hide that was prized. Buffalo hides brought as much as
$1,500 in London and Paris. That's a lot of money even today. Imagine how much
it was in 1880. The only other part of the buffalo that was not left to rot in
the hot prairie sun was the tongue. That was the only part the "white man" had
any taste for.
</P>
<P>
In 1870, according to Western historian Sam Arnold, 72 freight cars loaded with
nothing but buffalo hides and tongues were shipped out of Denver to the East.
Tongue today is not as popular as it once was, nor are hides; 'tis buffalo
steak that folks have discovered a taste for. "Buffalo steak," Sam said,
"tastes the way a beef steak would like to taste."
</P>
<P>
Arnold grills the steaks over charcoal, after first coating both sides well
with oil. After turning, the steaks are seasoned with his own Western Seasoning
Salt; a mixture of 1/3 garlic salt, 1/3 red pepper, 1/3 black pepper and 1/3
lemon crystals. (Lemon crystals can be found in the spice section of most
supermarkets; in drug stores, where they're labeled "citric acid crystals"; or
in Jewish deli's, where they will likely be called "sour salt.")
</P>
<P>
While you are not apt to find buffalo meat in the meat case of your local
supermarket in the immediate future, at the rate the national herd of American
bison is growing it won't be long. There are a growing number of ranchers,
large and small, raising buffalo. Some like the Hulk Ranch in Pierre, S.D.,
have 3,000 head or more; others, like Wray and Roma Dawson at Phistlewood Farms
in Chantilly, Va., have only 75 to 80 head. "They're fun to raise," Roma told
me, "good to eat, and they kind of help us make ends meet."
</P>
<P>
Most producers sell to consumers by direct mail either from their own
USDA-inspected plant or through a USDA-inspected processor. All sell steaks and
roasts and ground buffalo, some sell buffalo sausage products and jerky and a
few even sell that Epicurean delight of days gone by -- buffalo tongue. Here
are some places you can buy buffalo today.

<HEAD>Parks Chief Advises Against Feeding Starving Yellowstone Elk, Bison</HEAD>

   Elk and bison in fire
ravaged Yellowstone would be better helped by long-term solutions
rather than by donations of hay, says the National Park Service
director.
   A severe winter and loss of natural foods because of last
summer's drought and huge fires have driven hundreds of elk and
bison over the park boundary into southern Montana.
   In the small Montana town of Gardiner, north of the park,
starving elk are eating ornamental hedges, trees, and hay donated by
sympathetic people. Small herds of elk and buffalo have congregated
in town.
   ``They are skinny and weak,'' said Trudi Taylor, who helped raise
money to feed the animals after one elk died in her yard. She said
she hopes to save younger cows that will soon calve.
   ``In this town, most of the people make their money off these
animals. At least they could give a little back,'' she said,
referring to the area's popularity with hunters and tourists.
   But feeding hay to elk is expensive and can spread disease when
elk gather at feeding stations, Park Service Director William Penn
Mott told a news conference at park headquarters.
   Once rangers start providing hay to elk in Yellowstone, the
expensive practice could continue indefinitely, like at the national
elk refuge in Jackson, said Mott, who was sent on a fact-finding
trip Saturday by new Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr.
   Almost 500 of Yellowstone's 2,700 bison have been shot in Montana
in a state-sanctioned hunt, and 250 additional permits have been
issued. More than 2,350 elk from Yellowstone's northern herd of
19,000 were shot by Montana hunters this winter. Inside Yellowstone,
rangers have counted more than 300 elk carcasses.
   Mott said one option he could support was to have the federal
government acquire more winter game range in Montana north of the
park. The Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation of Missoula, Mont.,
announced Friday that it will start a special fund toward expanding
winter range for Yellowstone's northern elk herd.
   Mott also said he will ask the Park Service, other federal and
state agencies and conservation groups to help draft a report to
look at Yellowstone's total wildlife management program, which he
called fragmented.
   ``This is needed so that everybody knows what is going to be done
for long-term management of Yellowstone Park and preservation of the
area,'' he said.
   Mott said he hoped a wildlife report would be completed within
six months.
   ``We will look at the total ecosystem and how to best manage
wildlife. If land is being overgrazed, we should look at this.''
   Mott repeated his support for reintroduction of wolves into
Yellowstone, saying they could help keep big-game populations in
balance and are part of the West's ``biological diversity.''
   Elk and bison populations in Yellowstone are near all-time highs
because of recent mild winters.
   The big-game herds are in no danger of extinction, but in some
areas visitors may see fewer animals this year, he said.
   ``Even if winter kill (of northern herd elk) is 50 percent, there
would still be a core that would rapidly reproduce,'' he said.
   Mary Meagher, a Yellowstone biologist, said ``bison have the
biological capacity of recovering from low numbers.'' She recalled
that the park's hundreds of bison started with a remnant population
of 22 animals.
   Montana officials authorized a bison hunt because about half of
Yellowstone's bison carry the disease brucellosis, which some
scientists say could be transmitted to cattle.
   But Meagher said her best information from the Montana state
veterinarian was that no cases of brucellosis in that state had been
traced to Yellowstone Park animals. She pointed out that ranchers
vaccinate their calves against the disease.
   Last year, only 39 bison were shot in Montana's hunt, and this
year's hunt has been denounced as a slaughter by activists such as
Cleveland Amory, president of the Fund for Animals.

of diseases, ruination of habitat and inevitable conflict with humans.  </LEADPARA>

ONUS IS ON RANGERS TO THIN HERDS THAT THREATEN
LAND AND HUMANS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Wildlife management, animal population control by any of various means, is
already a social and moral flash point between hunters and animal-rights
activists. It takes on even heavier emotional lading and symbolism when the
creatures in the sights live in national parks.;    Painfully, the National
Park Service, protector of America's wildlife, is facing up to a crisis of
mission.;    Already this year, park rangers have been ordered to shoot bison
outside Yellowstone. Some of the service's Washington policy-makers believe
this kind of strong-handed wildlife management inevitably will become part of
park service creed.;    The director of the National Park Service says it is
no longer enough to adhere to old and deeply felt traditions and let nature
run its course in the great parks.;    "We can allow nature to take its course
as far as is practical," park Director James Ridenour said. "But when it goes
out of balance we need to help move it back toward a more natural ecosystem. .
. . This is not a popular position to take, but this is not a contest for
popularity. We need to do what's right for the park, the public and the
animals.";    At parks, monuments, battlefields and other facilities managed
by the park service, animal overpopulation and animals wandering across
borders are frequently the No. 1 problem.;    At Gettysburg battlefield in
Pennsylvania, at Fire Island National Seashore in New York and at least 20
other park facilities in the Northeast, Midwest and South, park officials say
they have too many white-tailed deer, sometimes far too many.;    In
Yellowstone and to the south, in Grand Teton National Park and parks in the
Dakotas, bison are increasing and sometimes wander off park property onto the
range where buffalo are no longer welcome to roam.;    Cattle ranchers fear
the free-ranging bison as an economic threat. The wild animals can spread
brucellosis, a disease that affects reproduction in livestock.;    At other
parks, the problems are local but just as thorny: Mountain goats where they
don't belong at Olympic National Park in Washington, prolific exotic deer at
Point Reyes National Seashore, ponies on Cape Hatteras off North Carolina and
Cumberland Island off Georgia.;    Feral pigs are a problem in the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park, and so are goats, pigs and mongooses at Hawaii
Volcanoes National Park.;    "The problem is bigger than one would be led to
believe," said Lonnie Williamson, a hunting enthusiast and vice president of
the independent Washington-based Wildlife Management Institute.;    'M AN HAS
stuck his finger into every corner of this country. It's no longer enough to
say, 'Let nature take its course.' We need a park service policy to manage
wildlife. We need to get rid of the ancient mentality that if we lock it up it
will be all right.";    This has been years coming. A park service assessment
named animal overpopulation as the top natural resource issue more than two
years ago.;    Final approval was announced Wednesday for a cooperative
agreement under which park rangers and Montana state wardens are supposed to
kill bison cows that wander out of the park. The meat is to be given to the
needy. Hunters, chosen by lot, will be allowed to kill the bulls and keep the
meat. Calves will be captured, neutered and sold at auction.;    The trouble
is that the park service has always viewed itself, and sold itself to the
public, as the agency that protects wildlife. After all, the badge of the
ranger is emblazoned with a bison. Shooting animals, shooting bison, just does
not register with the image of the ranger.;    Then, too, the bison has
replaced the bear these days as the object of the public's affection at the
park.;    "Nobody here likes the idea of blowing away our symbol, but we're
going to have to make some hard calls and they're not going to go down
easily," Yellowstone Park Superintendent Bob Barbee said.;    So far, hunters
have taken 11 bulls. The planned deployment of park rangers has been
challenged in U.S. District Court by the Fund for Animals. Wednesday, the fund
also asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture to reject Montana's petition to
quarantine the bison in the park.;    Wayward bison remain near the boundaries
of Yellowstone.;    Conservation groups would like to avoid the killing by
eventually finding expanded range for the bison, perhaps by leasing private
land from cattle ranchers. They also argue that the brucellosis risk to cattle
is exaggerated. They note that elk also carry the disease and that no one is
suggesting slaughtering elk that wander onto livestock range.;    At park
service headquarters in Washington, spokesman George Berklacy says he can
foresee some unpleasant ramifications with the public. All four television
networks have asked to be given advance notice before the rangers join in the
shooting. The dinnertime pictures: A gun, the friendly hat of the ranger, a
bison falling dead.;    "This," he said, "is going to give us the worst image
we've had in our 75-year history."  </TEXT>

   As Angelo Abbate addressed a golf
ball with a nine-iron at Hollywood Lakes Country Club, a herd of 13
buffalo addressed him with wide-eyed stares.
   ``I got kind of scared there for a second,'' said Abbate, 73,
who blames his bogey on the bison.
   Buffalo have roamed Broward and Dade counties for two months
after a horse thief inadvertently freed 250 of them from a ranch.
Since then, they have surprised motorists on Interstate 75, hung
around farmers' fields and even grazed on the greens at golf
courses. Last week, a buffalo died after it was hit by a
tractor-trailer in Dade.
   State troopers and wildlife officers say the buffalo problem is
getting out of hand.
   ``It is just a question of time before someone is going to get
hurt,'' said cattle farmer George Williams. ``What they need to do
is catch them in a steel pen that can hold them once and for all.''
   Officers from the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission
rounded up the bison at the golf course Wednesday and put them
inside a barbed wire fence on Williams' nearby pasture.
   But the free-spirited buffalo broke through the fence Thursday
morning and headed to civilization, clogging rush hour traffic on
Interstate 75 until wildlife officers chased them off the road.
They were moved to another fenced-in field in Broward County, where
they remain.
   The buffalo saga began March 20, when horse thieves cut a hole
in the fence surrounding Chi-O Ranchero in Miami Lakes.
   While the thieves made off with 26 horses, about 250 buffalo
escaped from the 2,000-acre pasture, said Arnold Oper, a Chi-O
stockholder.
   Oper has hired free-lance cowboys to track down the buffalo,
valued at $2,000 each. About 200 of the bison have been rounded up
so far.
   Oper and his partners invested in the buffalo with the hope the
meat would become popular in Florida.
   Wildlife officers charged Oper with a second-degree misdemeanor
of housing wildlife in an unsafe manner and allowing them to
escape, said Jim Huffstodt, the wildlife commission's information
officer.
   Bob Harper, the golf course superintendent at Hollywood Lakes,
said buffalo have twice left tracks on the links during the past
two weeks.
   ``At first nobody believed me when I told them there were
buffalo out there,'' he said. ``The police thought I was crazy. The
farmer out back thought I was crazy. (But) I'm from Kansas. I grew
up around farms and cattle. I know buffalo.''

<HEAD>Herd Eating Chippewa Tribe's Budget</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELCOURT, N.D. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Indian reservation sounded like a good
home for a buffalo herd, but the Chippewa tribe wishes someone would
take them away.
   ``We don't want a herd of buffalo,'' said Fred ``Fritz'' Monette,
a Chippewa tribal councilman. ``Unfortunately, we got stuck with a
herd of buffalo, and we don't know what to do with them.''
   Feeding the herd is costing the tribe about $100 a week and will
become more expensive come winter, he said Monday.
   The National Park Service gave the herd to the Turtle Mountain
Indian Reservation under a program that distributes surplus animals
to reservations.
   The herd has grown from nine head in 1984 to 29.
   Louise Crosby claims the tribe is trying to cut expenses by
starving the buffalo. ``To see them starve like that is a horrible
thing,'' she said.
   Crosby, who ran a game farm before selling her animals to the
Minot Zoo, said she offered to buy the buffalo to show the tribe how
extreme she thinks the situation is. But she said she doesn't really
want them because she too is daunted by feed costs.
   Monette and Tribal Chairman Twila Martin-Kekahbah deny the
buffalo are starving.
   ``They cost some money to the tribe, which we really can't
afford,'' Martin-Kekahbah said. ``However, the buffalo are not
starving. Some believe the buffalo are better taken care of than the
membership.''
   Richard Peltier, caretaker for the buffalo, said the animals
usually are fed between 15 gallons to 30 gallons of ground barley a
day. The tribe also buys 80 to 90 bales of hay a year for the herd,
he said, and provides a barrel of canned food supplement and a salt
block. The herd also has a large spring-fed water hole, he said.
   ``I think they are fed better than a lot of places,'' Peltier
said.
   Complaints from people like Crosby may stem from a
misunderstanding about how buffalo should look, he said. ``A person
has to get pretty close to them to see what shape they are in,'' he
said.
   Monette said the tribe is asking for suggestions on how it might
reduce the herd to a manageable size, possibly by auctioning or
donating animals.

   In regard to Ruth Rudner's April 3 Leisure &amp; Arts article
"Where the Buffalo Don't Roam": Permitting the shooting of
bison that wander outside the boundaries of Yellowstone Park
makes no more sense than declaring open season on animals
that escape from their cages at the zoo. Park officials'
claim of "keeping animals wild by allowing them natural
movement through their natural habitat" is ludicrous. Are
bears that live off garbage and wander up to tourists' cars
begging handouts natural? Yes, "population control has to
happen," but surely it can be accomplished more humanely.
   I saw scenes of the "hunt" on TV -- animal-rights
activists pleading to have a bleeding, struggling animal put
out of its misery while "hunters" stood about laughing,
prolonging the creature's terrible suffering because they got
a kick out of the effect it had on the activists. Even the
park rangers, condoning this behavior and chasing away those
who attempt to keep the animals within park boundaries, don't
behave like real rangers in Yellowstone.

   While Ms. Rudner's article did a fairly accurate job of
portraying a complex situation, attention should be brought
to a coloring of an important fact. Ms. Rudner states,
"Because {bison} can carry brucellosis, which causes cattle
to abort if they come into contact with the fresh afterbirth
of an aborted bison fetus, ranchers are understandably
concerned if bison cross the boundary."
   That sounds like reasonable justification for the hunt --
but the Humane Society says there isn't a case on record of
brucellosis being passed from wild bison to domestic cows.
The ranchers' stated reason for protection is actually
nothing more than a smoke screen to masquerade their true
motives -- to eliminate competition from increasingly scarce
grazing lands.
   It's time the public took notice of this travesty, and let
Congress know that it won't put up with the senseless
slaughter of an American treasure.

<TEXT>
   Horse thieves cut a hole in a fence and allowed at
least 75 beefalo to wander onto the Florida Turnpike, leading to
five minor accidents, an injury to a woman and the deaths of seven
animals, police said.
   Five of the beefalo died in the accidents and two other injured
animals had to be killed by Humane Society workers, the Florida
Highway Patrol reported.
   The beefalo, part of a 400-head herd owned by Dr. Arnie Oper,
roamed through a hole cut by thieves and ambled onto the turnpike
extension north of Miami Sunday morning, said FHP Sgt. Alvis Chinn.
   ``What they're doing apparently is stealing the horses in the
early morning hours and they're leaving without fixing the fence,''
Chinn said.
   The accidents caused an estimated $18,000 to $20,000 in damage
to the vehicles involved, Chinn said. An unidentified woman who was
treated for minor injuries and released from Palmetto General
Hospital, he said.
   Motorist Shelley D'Errico said she slowed down when she spotted
part of the herd. When one started toward her car, she took off.
   ``My husband told me to gun it,'' she said, adding that her car
was unscathed. ``I don't know if my insurance company would believe
that a buffalo put a dent in my car.''
   The herd was rounded up by animal-control officers, passersby
and ranch workers, Chinn said. The beefalo, a hybrid of buffalo and
cattle, were valued at $1,500 to $1,800 each.

<TEXT>
   Once replaced by a fatter breed of cattle,
the legendary Texas Longhorn is on the comeback trail in grocery
stores as Americans become more health-conscious, cattle raisers
say.
   ``Probably the largest hurdle we have is convincing old-time
cattle raisers they need to change,'' Bill Anthony, president of
the International Texas Longhorn Association, said at the group's
first meeting Thursday.
   Anthony, an Ardmore, Okla. rancher, started raising Longhorns 25
years ago and has fallen in love with the breed.
   ``They are extremely intelligent. You can make housepets out
them if you want.''
   But it's not their intelligence that is putting them back on the
market.
   ``The bottom line is the Longhorn has qualities consumers want
on their dinner plates and the qualities many ranchers are seeking
to develop in their livestock,'' said Mike Moeller, deputy state
agriculture commissioner.
   Moeller said Longhorn beef has 10 percent fat and yields a
greater percentage of lean beef than any other breed. The hardy
breed had been replaced by fatter stock by the turn of the century.
   For cattlemen, Longhorns are a low-maintenance, genetic gold
mine.
   Descended from Spanish cattle brought here centuries ago, the
Longhorn has adapted to severe climates, can forage on poor quality
grass, is resistant to several diseases and produces rich milk.
   When bred with other breeds, the Longhorns cut down on the
number of calving problems, Moeller said.
   Also there is the mystique of raising an animal that helped
create the cowboy and turn the country into a people of beefeaters.
   ``When you have something that has been for so many years of
historical greatness, it's hard not to be fond of Texas Longhorn
cattle,'' Anthony said.
   The first Longhorns were sent out of Texas to New Orleans in the
1840s. A few were driven to Missouri later in that decade. In the
1850s, Longhorns were herded all the way to Chicago.
   But the Civil War intervened and the men who had been driving
cattle took up arms or sold the cattle they raised to armies from
both sides.
   After the war, driving Longhorns to railheads in Kansas became
big business.
   The Texas State Historical Association estimates that 10 million
Longhorns were driven northward on the Chisholm Trail during the
first 25 years after the the Civil War.
   The Longhorn replaced the buffalo as meat for men who were
building the railroads and helping the population move westward.
The huge buffalo herds had been decimated by too much hunting.

   Buffalo are more at home on the range, a
doctor has decided after five years of dealing with problems caused
by the freedom-loving American bison.
   Following a weekend in which seven fugitive buffalo had to be
killed after causing two accidents on Florida's Turnpike, Arnold
Oper has decided to sell all 60 remaining animals. They should go
for about $2,000 each, said his attorney Ron Lowy.
   That decision doesn't come soon enough for Greg Hintz, whose
1981 Chevrolet sustained $2,000 damage when he collided in the dark
with a group of four bison wandering across the highway Saturday
night.
   ``I was so mad that those things got on the turnpike,'' Hintz
said.
   Oper, south Florida's only buffalo rancher, was still trying
Tuesday to corral some of the 50 bison that escaped from his
Chi-O-Ranchero near the Dade-Broward county line. He has been
raising the animals for meat.
   Lowy said they have most of the remaining herd in a rock quarry,
but the bison keep swimming away into a lake every time wranglers
get near.

   Farmers seem to always be looking for ways of
adding to family income, sometimes by moonlighting in town, driving
a school bus, or by setting up roadside stands to peddle seasonal
produce.
   Sometimes a sideline can become a full-time business, one of the
alternatives to traditional crops-and-livestock farming. These days
it can include llamas, water buffalos, deer and ostriches.
   A two-day conference last week at the Agriculture Department
concentrated on LISA, the acronym invented to describe ``low-input,
sustainable agriculture.'' It means producing food by using more
sense and less chemicals.
   Mostly, the meetings included case histories of farmers who have
learned or are trying to learn how to reduce expenses by using less
fertilizer, pesticides and other ``inputs'' while making a living
and improving their land.
   The LISA program is part of an overall thrust by the government,
including legislation and $3.9 million provided by Congress, to help
farmers _ large and small _ look at alternative systems for
producing crops and livestock.
   One of the components is the Office for Small-Scale Agriculture,
which is operated by USDA's Cooperative State Research Service. For
some time, the office has been grinding out one-sheet reports about
the alternatives available to small producers.
   Some of the previous topics include sheep, goats, mushrooms,
foliage plants, herbs, wildflowers and specialty vegetables.
   The latest one-sheeter, prepared by editor George B. Holcomb, is
``Exotic Livestock.'' And the report begins by asking about beefalo,
the crossbred critter of beef and buffalo origins that stirred
imaginations a few years back.
   ``Where's the beefalo? It's still around, but the excitement is
gone,'' the report said. ``Such a query arises because introduction
of exotic types of creatures into a country where they are scarce
encourages speculators to bid prices extremely high.''
   In that case, breeding stock becomes the focus rather than the
basic use of the animal for meat, work, hide, fur or feathers.
   But American consumers, affluent and with sometimes incredible
appetites for exotic menu items, can exert powerful influence.
   For example, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, USDA's
agency that oversees inspection of meat and poultry, has changed its
rules to include reindeer, elk, antelope, water buffalo and deer as
``exotic'' animals.
   Previously, the agency's exotic list included only American
bison, or buffalo, and cattalo or beefalo.
   Officials say fewer than 2,000 ``exotic'' animals are slaughtered
annually in the United States, compared with more than 32 million
cattle each year.
   But because of rising demand from restaurants, small-scale
producers of exotic animals are finding it profitable to market
federally inspected meat from certain species, the report said.
   Meanwhile, there has been a growing demand for other exotic
animals, and sometimes the prices are sky-high.
   ``For the moment, the biggest dollar demand is for such exotics
as ostriches and South American humpless camels such as llamas,
alpacas, guanacos and vicunas,'' the report said. ``Little demand is
noted for Alaska's yaks or musk oxen.''
   According to a quarterly publication, Llama Life, in 1987 a
company called Camelids Inc. sold 52 male and female llamas at an
estimated cost of more than $1 million. One buyer paid $100,000 each
for two breeding males.
   ``Some people predict that 3,500 U.S. owners of 12,000 llamas
will begin to price themselves out of the market, even if camelid
wool is sought by handspinners and weavers, and the pack animals are
used in sorts of fund-raising events,'' the report said.
   Llamas, fabled pack animals in the Andes of South America, are
often used for that purpose by the USDA's Forest Service when
venturing into wilderness areas because they are less intrusive on
the environment than horses and mules.
   Unlike llamas, water buffalos aren't in great demand, the report
said. But there has been commercial herd development in the United
States since 1978. There are two types, both used for work and meat:
the swamp buffalo, or carabao, which is rarely used for milk, and
the river buffalo, which is noted for its milk.
   Breeds of the river buffalo are commonly found in the temperate
climates of Italy, Albania, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, some areas
of the Soviet Union, and in cold, mountainous areas of Pakistan,
Afghanistan and Nepal.
   ``Latin America countries are beginning to catch on to their
value,'' the report said. ``About 18 different breeds of both types
can work in tropical mud that can bog down a tractor. One of these
animals can work as many as 20 years.''
   The European fallow deer is another farming possibility on the
exotic side. Currently, U.S. restaurants import 500 to 1,000 tons of
venison annually, mostly from New Zealand. But a problem with deer
and elk is that a fence about seven feet high is needed to keep the
animals under control, a major expense in getting started.
   West Germany, which has about 2,000 deer farms, still imports
more than 20,000 tons of venison annually, the report said.
   If large poultry is preferred, try ostriches. There are several
ostrich ranches in Oklahoma, dating back to 1981, the report said.
Pairs of breeding size adults bring $12,000 to $30,000 each,
depending on age and quality. Chicks at last report cost $1,000 each
at eight weeks, when sex can be distinguished.

<HEAD>Scientists See No Quick Solution to Brucellosis Spreading to Cattle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government scientists say there is no quick
solution to the problem of brucellosis spreading from wild bison
and elk into cattle herds bordering Yellowstone National Park.
   A two-day meeting of scientists and others from the departments
of Agriculture and Interior was held here this week, but two senior
officials said in a joint interview Thursday that no one is close
to a decision on how to deal with the problem.
   Brucellosis of cattle has also been called Bang's disease and
infectious abortion. It can cause undulant fever in humans, usually
through unpasteurized milk or direct contact with infected animals.
   The Agriculture Department, in cooperation with state and local
governments, livestock associations and animal health groups, has
been striving for decades to eliminate the disease from commercial
herds.
   So far, according to USDA officials, 27 states are free of
brucellosis. Most of the remainder are in the South.
   The problem with bison, or American buffalo, and elk in the huge
Yellowstone National Park is that infected animals can roam onto
cattle rangelands, mingle with herds and thus spread the disease.
   ``While we're talking about a very small number of cattle and
bison and elk in the Yellowstone area, the potential threat can
extend over a much wider area,'' said John Dennis of the National
Park Service.
   Cattle, of course, greatly outnumber bison in the United States.
There are nearly 100 million head of cattle, compared with an
estimated 500,000 bison, including public and private herds.
Yellowstone has around 2,000 head.
   But prospective buyers and shippers of breeding cattle can be
highly wary of animals from known areas of brucellosis infection.
That is true on the growing international market for livestock as
well as domestically, Dennis said.
   ``It's a lot easier to do that interchange if everybody is in
the same status on brucellosis,'' he said. ``Some countries may not
even accept cattle from (the United States) if we have pockets of
brucellosis.''
   John Kopec of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
said that there is much to learn about brucellosis in Yellowstone.
   ``We don't know absolutely that this disease may have come from
infected elk and _ in one case _ maybe some bison running around,''
he said. ``We don't know this unequivocally. But we have more or
less ruled out all the other sources.''
   Kopec said that since the early 1960s there have six outbreaks
of brucellosis among cattle in the Yellowstone area in which
infection from other cattle has been ruled out. The most recent was
in February after the disease was detected in an Idaho packing
plant and the slaughtered animal traced to Wyoming.
   The owner of the exposed cattle decided to liquidate the herd,
sending older cattle to slaughter and younger animals to a
quarantined feedlot and subsequently to slaughter.
   Kopec said that one of the problems in the Yellowstone area is
that ``we haven't unequivocally answered the question'' whether
bison and elk in the park have carried the disease over many
centuries or whether it is more recent.
   Meanwhile, he said, the cattle industry is putting pressure on
federal and state authorities to help safeguard commercial herds
against the ``potential threat'' of brucellosis from wild creatures.
   Kopec and Dennis said more experiments and study are needed. The
answers will come slowly.
   ``We may be talking years,'' Kopec said. ``It's not something
that will be done overnight.''

   The Agriculture Department says the Soviet
Union has bought 410,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices for delivery in 1989-90, the seventh year of a long-term
grain supply agreement.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Thursday that shipments are
scheduled in January and February.
   The wheat was sold under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP, which provides subsidies to exporters selling U.S.
commodities to designated foreign markets.
   Dickerson said only 14,200 tons of wheat remain in the Soviet
Union's current EEP allocation of 1.5 million tons announced May 2.
   It was the second U.S. wheat sale since the seventh year of the
long-term grain agreement began Oct. 1, although more than 10.3
million tons of corn have been sold for 1989-90 delivery, along
with soybeans and soybean meal. A sale of 215,000 tons was reported
Monday.
   The pact runs through Dec. 31, 1990, and a new agreement is
being negotiated.
   In 1988-89, the sixth year of the current agreement, the Soviet
Union bought about 5.4 million tons of wheat and more than 16.3
million tons of corn, plus soybeans, soybean meal and grain
sorghums.
   A metric ton is 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of
wheat. The 410,000 tons are equal to more than 15 million bushels
worth about $57 million at recent U.S. farm prices.
   Dickerson reported the subsidies at an average of $16.81 per
ton, or about 46 cents per bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or
subsidies.
   Dickerson said the wheat was sold by Alfred C. Toepfer
International Inc., 150,000 tons; Louis Dreyfus Corp., 135,000;
Cargill Inc., 50,000; Continental Grain Co., 25,000; J. Aron &amp; Co.,
25,000; and Mitsubishi International Corp., 25,000.

   After being plagued for years by the
annoying buzz of the lusty humming toadfish, hundreds of houseboat
residents here decided to turn the other gill, er, cheek.
   The humming toadfish season usually marks a time when sleepy
houseboat dwellers put pillows over their heads to escape the
irritating nighttime sound of thousands of sex-starved male fish.
   But this year, houseboaters threw the Sausalito Humming Toadfish
Festival instead.
   ``They're just out looking for a mate, just like everybody else
in Sausalito,'' said John McCosker, the Steinhart Aquarium
ichthyologist and oceanographer who identified the humming toadfish
as the cause of the mysterious buzz in 1985.
   In its courtship ritual, the fish sidles up to a concrete
structure _ a cave or houseboat will do _ and blows air through its
bladder. The noise apparently drives female toadfish crazy with
desire. The hum usually begins in June and stops when the mating
season ends in August.
   About 5,000 people turned out for Sunday's fish festival in
which McCosker was crowned king of the festivities.
   ``It was overwhelming,'' McCosker said. ``Who would have thought
as an ichthyologist I would have risen to such heights, or, in
Sausalito, such depths.''

   America's palate apparently is honed to where
the buffalo roam, says Duane Helland, who specializes in bison
cuisine.
   Helland, who owns and operates Helland's Food and Locker Service
with his wife, Sue, decided to expand his menu to include the great
American bison in reaction to ``a changing society,'' he said.
   ``People want to eat meat that's low in calories, fat and
cholesterol and high in protein,'' said Helland, who has filled
orders for almost 5,000 pounds of buffalo meat.
   The average serving of beef contains 24 percent protein and 28
percent fat. Buffalo has 35 percent protein and 3 percent fat,
according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   There is about half the amount of cholesterol in a buffalo roast
than in a similar cut of beef, said Mary Duvall, executive director
of the National Buffalo Association, in Fort Pierre, S.D.
   ``If it's not overcooked, it's a little sweeter than beef.
There's no wild flavor,'' Helland said. ``It's real smooth. Texture
of the meat is very silky.''
   There's a catch, though. ``It's twice the price of beef,''
Helland said.
   In 1850, about 20 million buffalo thundered on the western
plains. In the late 1800s, hunters slaughtered millions of bison
until their numbers dwindled. By 1889, only 551 bison were found
alive in the United States.
   Today, as many as 100,000 exist, mostly in the hands of private
individuals, Duvall said.

<HEAD>Shipments of Federally Inspected Reindeer Steaks Would Be Allowed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shipments of federally inspected reindeer
steaks across the country would be allowed under a proposal
announced Thursday by the Agriculture Department.
   There is mandatory federal inspection of cattle, hogs, chickens
and turkeys at slaughter plants, which allows those carcasses to be
shipped across state lines.
   In addition, regulations permit the voluntary inspection of
certain exotic animals slaughtered for human food. Those include
the American bison, or buffalo, and the cattalo, a cross between
cattle and the buffalo.
   Lester M. Crawford, head of the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service, said producers of exotic animals have asked
that the inspection list be expanded to include reindeer, elk,
deer, antelope and water buffalo.
   ``This proposal is a response to their request and could
facilitate the sale and export of the carcasses, meat and meat food
products from these animals,'' he said. ``Once the animals and
products are inspected and passed, they can be sold interstate or
exported.''
   Producers of the animals would pay fees to receive the optional
inspection service. Crawford said fewer than 2,000 exotic animals
are slaughtered annually at the present time and that the slaughter
level is not expected to increase much if the exotic list is
expanded.
   By comparison, he said, annual cattle slaughter has been running
at more than 32 million head.
   Public comments on the proposal can be sent by April 26 to:

<HEAD>State Puts Off Decision On Whether To Continue Killing Bison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE MOORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELENA, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State wildlife officials put off a decision
Thursday on a temporary plan to kill wandering bison from
Yllowstone National Park to ensure they don't spread disease to
cattle.
   The plan, which was the subject of a hearing, includes a
provision to have federal rangers help state wardens kill the cows
that wander outside the park.
   Officials say cows are more likely to carry the disease
brucellosis than bulls, and putting the responsibility for their
killing in the hands of wardens and rangers should reduce the
chances of their spreading disease.
   About half of the 2,500 to 3,000 bison in the 2-million-acre
park are believed to carry brucellosis, a disease that causes
cattle to abort. Montana spent millions of dollars over a decade to
eradicate brucellosis in its cattle.
   Hunters would continue killing bulls outside the park and calves
would be captured, sterilized and sold at auction.
   Animal rights groups are lined up solidly against killing the
animals, contending the threat of passing brucellosis from bison to
domestic cattle is minimal or non-existent.
   The Montana Department of Livestock and the Montana
Stockgrowers' Association are equally adamant in demanding the
invading bison not be allowed even the slightest chance to
contaminate public and private rangeland abutting the park's
northern and western boundaries.
   The plan has caused a furor this winter, with critics -
including some sport hunters - complaining that killing the bison
has wounded Montana's reputation as a refuge for wildlife.
   ``Let's get hunters out of the business of shooting bison,''
Brian Kahn of Helena said during Thursday's hearing.
   He characterized himself as a life-long hunter and supporter of
hunting, and said state officials must take a serious look ``at
what this bison hunt is doing to the image of hunting.''
   Knute Hereim, a rancher from Martinsdale representing the
stockgrowers' association, said livestock producers support the
state's attempt to keep infected bison from possibly reinfecting
Montana herds.
   He said officials in Yellowstone have not taken steps to control
the animal health risk. ``Immediate action must be taken,'' he
said.
   Pat Graham, associate director of the state Department of Fish,
Wildlife and Parks, said all comment submitted at Thursday's
hearing, a previous hearing Dec. 14 and written comment would be
assessed before a final decision is made, probably next week.
   A decision had been scheduled for Friday. Graham said there is
no immediate threat of hundreds of bison moving from the park into
Montana, giving the department longer than originally anticipated
to make its decision.
   During both public hearings this month and in much of the
written comment, the National Park Service has been criticized for
not controlling bison movements or cleansing the herds of
brucellosis.
   Yellowstone Superintendent Robert Barbee said earlier that the
park is cooperating fully with attempts to find a long-term
solution to the bison problem. He also said the call by Montana
officials for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to issue a
quarantine order for the park was inappropriate.
   The Fund for Animals, based in New York City, filed suit in
federal court against the bison control plan. It contends the plan
reflects a ``shoot-anything-that-moves'' mentality by state
wildlife officials.
   In written testimony, the fund contended the plan is biased in
favor of ``the self-serving interests'' of Montana's livestock
industry. It called for non-lethal means of controlling the
infected animals.
   So far this winter, only hunters have been used to kill bison
wandering across the park's border in the region near West
Yellowstone. Eleven bulls have been killed.
   Two seasons ago, 569 bison were killed.

<TEXT>     His comment followed a federal judge's ruling Tuesday allowing the state of
Montana to proceed with a plan that calls for Yellowstone park rangers to join
state game wardens and citizen hunters in shooting bison outside Yellowstone.;
   Half of the estimated 3,000 bison in Yellowstone are believed to be
infected with brucellosis, a disease that causes domestic cattle to lose their
calves.;    Ron Aasheim of the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks
said Wednesday there were no immediate plans to begin shooting bison.;
Animal-rights activists gathered at the town of West Yellowstone to protest
the hunt. Yellowstone officials said there are fewer than a half-dozen buffalo
grazing back and forth across the park boundary that might be targets.;    The
national Fund for Animals went to federal court seeking an injunction to stop
the killing.;    U.S. District Judge Charles Lovell denied that request late
Tuesday, saying it "would not be in the public interest given the serious
threat of brucellosis, the large number of excess bison, and the lack of
feasible alternatives to control bison migrating out of the park.";
"Montana has an absolute right under its police powers, in protecting the
health, safety and welfare of its inhabitants, to remove by reasonable means
possibly infected trespassing federal bison which migrate into Montana," the
judge said.;    Alston said the plan is a "legitimate approach to the problem"
while efforts continue to devise long-term solutions, including a joint
federal-state environmental impact statement that is at least a year away.;
Last summer, Gov. Stan Stephens accepted Yellowstone Superintendent Robert
Barbee's offer of rangers to assist Montana wardens in killing wayward bison.;
   Park rangers once culled herds by killing surplus animals, but have not
done so since 1966.;    Lovell said "the anomaly of management through
non-management" has resulted in a surplus of 600 bison over the park's
capacity.;    In 1988-'89, Montana hunters and wardens killed 569 bison north
of the park boundary. Only four were killed the following winter when
animal-rights activists disrupted the hunts. So far this winter, 11 bulls have
been killed near West Yellowstone.  </TEXT>

<HEADLINE>  BOTSWANA'S GIANT FENCE IS KILLING WILDLIFE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The fence runs along the northwest rim of the Okovanggo, an
8,500-square-mile wilderness teeming with game in northwest Botswana, where
the Okovanggo River makes a fan-shaped inland delta before dying in the sands
of the Kalahari Desert.;    Besides cutting migration routes for some of the
Okovanggo's rarest herds, the "buffalo fence" under construction also places
outside the fence one of the wildest and most remote sections of the delta,
the Magwegqana peninsula.;     'It's a paradise';    "It's a paradise, I'm
telling you, a paradise," Phillips said. "And it'll all be cattle country
now.";    The fence is the latest part of a long-range plan by the government
to cordon this sprawling, desert nation into cattle and wildlife zones.;
The fences already have opened massive tracts of formerly wild country to
Botswana's cattle industry. They also have killed tens of thousands of wild
animals -- giraffe, springbok, zebra, eland -- that become tangled in the
sharp wires as they follow their centuries-old migrating routes. In the last
decade, Botswana's population of 300,000 wildebeest was reduced to a little
more than 1,000; they either died in the fences or of thirst in their
water-poor enclaves.;     Government defends fences;    Government officials
defend the program as necessary to Botswana's lucrative beef trade.
Environmentalists, they say, exaggerate the threat and underestimate the
ability of wildlife to adapt to the fences.;    Ove Nielsen, chairman of the
Botswana Meat Commission, complains that foreigners are trying to turn his
country into "a gigantic zoo.";    Botswana, long considered one of Africa's
most conservation-minded countries, recently has come under increasing attack
from international environmental groups -- partly because of the new fences
and partly for the proposed dredging of 15 miles of river leading out of the
swamps.;     Dredging draws attention;    The dredging, intended to tap the
delta's precious water, has drawn more international attention in recent
weeks. Greenpeace threatened to boycott Botswana's diamond industry if the
dredging isn't stopped. But many people think the buffalo fence poses the
greater threat.;    "As far as I'm concerned, this is worse than the
dredging," said one environmentalist in Gaborone, the capital.;    Coert Van
Hasselt, a lawyer based in Brussels, Belgium, represents a coalition of
environmental groups threatening to launch a global boycott of Botswana's beef
industry because of the fences.;    One concern is the timing of the
construction. Many of the Okovanggo's animals have left the swamp area to
migrate north toward the Angola highlands, where the rains begin in early
January. If the fence is finished in the next few months, environmentalists
argue, these animals will be caught outside.;     Delay promised;    In
response, the Botswana government promised only to plant the tall, wooden
posts for the fence, but to hold off stringing the steel wire until the rains
subside and the animals return to the central Okovanggo.;    But a Greenpeace
investigator said this month that an inspection showed that the wire was being
put in place and that the new fence's first casualty -- a young giraffe -- had
been found tangled and dead along one completed stretch.;    To
environmentalists, it is as though one of the world's greatest natural
treasures is being sacrificed for the benefit of a handful of major cattle
owners.;    To many Botswanans -- and to many landowners throughout Africa --
it is as though they are being asked to remain primitive and poor so
well-heeled foreigners will have a place to come on vacation.  </TEXT>

   When hunters legally killed 569 potentially
diseased bison outside Yellowstone National Park two winters ago,
citics complained that they wounded Montana's proud reputation as
a refuge for wildlife.
   Now officials are thinking of modifying the hunt to make it
clear that the purpose is to keep Montana cattle herds
disease-free. But conservation and animal-rights groups still
aren't satisfied.
   Montana's Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks is considering
a change in rules that now call for state game wardens and national
park rangers to join private hunters in killing adult bison that
cross from Yellowstone into Montana in search of winter forage.
   The department plans to make its decision on Friday after
today's hearing.
   ``I think the plan we have now is a good plan and will work,''
Gov. Stan Stephens said in a recent interview.
   But the New York-based Fund for Animals has sued to stop all
bison killing. The Greater Yellowstone Coalition, an environmental
group, says the state should consider non-lethal alternatives.
   The Montana Board of Livestock, frustrated with the long debate,
has asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture to quarantine
Yellowstone.
   About half of the 2,500 to 3,000 bison in the 2-million-acre
park are believed to carry brucellosis, a disease that causes
cattle to abort. Montana spent millions of dollars over a decade to
eradicate brucellosis in its cattle.
   ``Why should we have one vestige of infection left?'' asked
James Glossen of USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
``From an agricultural perspective, we don't want that reservoir of
infection in Yellowstone.''
   Under the current plan, negotiated with the National Park
Service, private hunters are called to kill bull bison, and game
wardens and park rangers may be called in to kill cows that wander
out of the park, sometimes onto private land. Calves would be
captured, neutered and sold.
   Bison that remain inside Yellowstone may not be harmed.
   Officials say the plan seeks to spread the responsibility for
the killings and mitigate some of the outrage that followed the
killing of 569 bison by private hunters during the winter of
1988-89. Eleven have been killed so far this season.
   Officials also say cows are more likely to carry brucellosis
than bulls, and putting the responsibility for their killing in the
hands of wardens and rangers should reduce the chances of their
spreading disease.
   But the Montana Wildlife Federation, a conservation group whose
ranks include hunters, says the bison killing ``is damaging the
Montana record as a progressive wildlife conservation state.''
   ``The eyes of all America are watching,'' Wayne Pacelle, Fund
for Animals' executive director, said last week. ``The Park Service
clearly is not going to benefit by having the public see its
rangers shoot its very symbol.''
   K.L. Cool, the state's Fish, Wildlife and Parks director, has
agreed there is no sport involved in shooting the slow-moving
animals, likening it to ``shooting cattle in a feed yard.''
   He said he would be willing to consider a better alternative but
that in the end the spread of brucellosis must be controlled.
   Ranchers in the area are watching the debate especially closely.
   ``Bison in Yellowstone Park are of great value to all of us,''
said James Stermitz, a rancher near the park's northern gate.
``Bison outside of Yellowstone Park can only offer problems that
would not get better.''

State wildlife officials in Helena, Mont., put off a decision on a plan for
federal wardens and state rangers to kill bison that wander out of Yellowstone
National Park to ensure that they do not spread disease to cattle.
</P>
<P>
About half of the 2,500 to 3,000 buffalo in the park are believed to carry
brucellosis, which causes cattle to abort. Animal rights groups contend the
threat of the bisons' passing the disease to domestic cattle is minimal, but
Montana ranchers say the invading bison should not be allowed even the
slightest chance to contaminate rangeland. Montana spent millions of dollars
over a decade to eradicate brucellosis.

respect and reverence, Indians hunted the wild, woolly animal -- a gift from
the Great Spirit -- for its physical and spiritual nourishment.  </LEADPARA>

RECOGNITION
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, TO BUFFALO  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Additional information attached to end of article.
Food Scene  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     That time is past. But the respect American Indians feel for the buffalo
lives on.;    For those attending the traditional Indian feast and silent art
auction recently at Mother Olson's Inn in San Jose, the entree -- roasted
buffalo in garlic sauce -- was as special as the occasion.;    The dinner, a
benefit for the South Bay Quincentennial Indigenous Council, was prepared by
Lee A. Sprague, the founder of Menomin Caterers in Oakland (today's Four-Star
chef). Menomin means "wild rice" in the Indian language of Anishanabe.;    The
menu featured fruited wild rice, blue cornmeal muffins and peppermint tea.;
A Potawatomi-Ottawa and Ojibwe Indian with almost waist-length braids, Sprague
held up a food-laden plate as he addressed the crowd. "This first plate," he
said, "is for Grandfather's spirit, which is here with us tonight.";
Sprague has savored the rich flavor of buffalo all his life. "It has a
nourishing quality about it," he says.;    That rich flavor was a hit at the
Indian feast, where diners listened to guitarist Ronnie Padilla and marveled
over their first taste of buffalo.;    "It's sweet," said Consuelo Underwood,
an art professor at San Jose State University and one of the auction's
exhibiting artists. Maria Luisa Alaniz, a social scientist, called it "lean
and tender.";    The tenderness and sweetness, Sprague says, come from
roasting it at low temperatures.;    For Betty Glass, the roast buffalo dinner
brought back memories from 45 years ago of her then-104-year-old grandmother,
an American Indian from the Ohio area.;    "She was an Indian princess,"
recalled Glass, 71. "She married an Irish-English trapper. Being here tonight
makes me proud of my Indian heritage.";    The buffalo was once an important
food source, playing a significant role in the everyday life of the Indians,
said the council's George Martin, a Thlinget Indian.;    "Our lives were tied
to the buffalo's life. But the United States government allowed the buffalo to
be hunted for sport," Sprague said. "We became dependent on food arranged
around the reservation system. Our lives changed.";    Though the buffalo
faced near extinction, today its numbers are growing. There are more than
90,000 buffalo nationwide, according to Kim Dawling of the National Buffalo
Association in South Dakota.;    The growing consumer demand for
low-cholesterol, lean meat may increase the popularity of buffalo meat,
Sprague predicts.;    Buffalo meat contains 50 percent fewer calories than
beef, as well as 30 percent more protein, 25 percent less cholesterol -- and a
quarter of the fat.;    "My frame of reference," Sprague says, "is that beef
tastes like buffalo -- only not as good.";    Buffalo meat also links American
Indians with their ancestral and historical legacy.;    As a caterer and an
Indian, Sprague says, "I feel a strong responsibility to use the foods that
came from our people. These foods, such as the buffalo meat, make me feel
connected to my ancestors.";    This concern with maintaining ancestral links
underlies the meaning behind the Quincentennial Indigenous Council. It was
established as a response to the upcoming 500th anniversary of Columbus' 1492
arrival in the Americas to voice an alternative quincentennial view: that
Columbus' arrival began an invasion that led to the genocide of the
continents' indigenous peoples.;    "To me," Sprague says, "1492 represents
the changes our people experienced during and after Columbus' arrival. Our
people didn't know of the changes to come. We welcomed him; we fed him; we
introduced new foods to him.;    "When I see tomatoes in Italian dishes or the
chocolate in candy bars -- that people may think originated in Switzerland --
I think of all of the foods that came from the Americas.;    "Buffalo is my
soul food," Sprague says. "Knowing that my grandfathers ate buffalo and wild
rice makes me feel closer to them.";     Where to buy buffalo;  Lee Sprague,
owner of Menomin Caterers in Oakland, gets his buffalo meat from the Durham
Meat Co., 1160 Sunol St., San Jose, (408) 298-6404, which owns 4,000 head at
its 60,000-acre ranch in Wyoming. (Durham is developing a retail line -- from
ground patties to steaks and roasts -- for frozen-foods sections.);    Other

(415) 737-5879;    Cooking tips;  Buffalo can be substituted in most beef
recipes, but it must be cooked at lower temperatures. Cook to rare or medium
for best results. Buffalo cooks faster than beef. Here are some cooking tips:;
   (box)  For roasting a 3- to 4-pound buffalo roast, Sprague gives these
directions: Rub it with crushed garlic and corn oil, then sprinkle it with
pepper and salt. Wrap foil around the bottom of the roast and place a bay leaf
inside the foil to season the drippings.;    Roast uncovered at 325 degrees.
During the first hour, baste with the drippings several times. Then turn the
roast over so it browns on both sides, and cover it completely with foil for
another half-hour or until a meat thermometer registers an internal
temperature of 130 to 140 degrees.;    To serve, make a gravy from the
drippings with added water and vegetable bouillon.;    (box)  For crock-pot
cooking: Use the lowest temperature and let it cook all day.;    (box)  For
broiling: Move the broiler rack as far as possible from the heat and shorten
cooking time.;    (box)  For grilling: Never put buffalo in the flame. Keep
the temperature low or let the coals die down. Marinate and then baste
frequently.;    (box)  For the microwave: Brown steaks quickly in frying pan,
then place in microwave at high for 24-40 seconds until medium or rare.;
(box)  For stir-frying: Cut into small strips or cubes and fry with a very
small amount of olive oil (just enough to coat the pan). Keep the heat down.;

and lush gardens, for more than a century.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "All the tour buses come by," said Dias, motioning as a bus of sightseers
slowed. Dias, or "Big Bison" to those who know him, tends the park's bison for
the San Francisco city zoo.;   While plenty can be said for zoo favorites such
as koalas and kangaroos, Dias claims that no other animal has the personality
or intelligence of a bison. On a recent morning, Dias looked upon his herd and
spoke proudly of the 16 horned and shaggy beasts.;   As the bison ruminated
their feed, Dias said he views his charges as characters out of Shakespeare.
Hence, their names: King Lear, Macduff, Lady Macbeth.;   Fittingly, these
namesakes have shown a flair for drama. The male bison named Macduff set off a
long-running feud when he challenged the pre-eminence of 1,800-pound King
Lear, the herd's dominant male.;   Macduff, moved by the oldest and strongest
of drives, was apparently seeking to mate with the female bison. "Macduff
wasn't the leader," Dias said. "Only the leader mates. So there was a lot at
stake.";   Finally, to stop the fighting, the San Francisco zoo sold Macduff
and a dozen cohorts to a private owner.;   If it were not for a few
benefactors, King Lear and the rest might have ended up stewed and slathered
over sourdough at a San Francisco restaurant.;   In 1984, Dick Blum, the
investment banker husband of former Mayor Dianne Feinstein, happened to jog
past the herd one day and noticed that many of the bison looked sickly. Blum,
who recalled visiting the bison as a child, decided to help.;   The bison, he
learned, were suffering from an epidemic of tuberculosis. When Blum offered to
open his checkbook to buy new bison, the zoo decided to move the sick herd to
city-owned land near the San Francisco jail, where the survivors remain.;
The question remained: Where to find new bison for sale? The city turned to
Tommy Harris of Tommy's Joynt, a restaurant whose fare includes buffalo stew.
Harris called his meat supplier, Blum said, and in short order, 16 bison were
shipped live, King Lear among them.;   Dias, 54, might have chosen a life of
suits and ties, but opted for the overalls and shovel of a zoo keeper at age
31.;   "I used to go to the zoo as my solace. I thought, 'Wouldn't it be
wonderful to work here?' So I did.";   To Dias, no other species has the
personality of a bison. They are "one-man animals," loyal to him.;   A friend
began calling him Big Bison years ago, after watching as Dias stared down a
bison trying to escape through a gate. It was apparent, the friend noted, that
Dias was "the Big Bison." The name stuck, and today he is even listed that way
in the phone directory.  </TEXT>

WILD ANIMALS ARE EATING AWAY AT PARCHED SANTA CATALINA ISLAND
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IAN M. ROSE, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the dry summer heat on Santa Catalina Island, wild buffalo roll in the dust
and munch on clumps of grass. Spotted baby boar scurry along the edge of a
trickling canyon stream, digging up roots under the soil. Goats meander on a
hillside and feed on green tree seedlings.
</P>
<P>
To tourists rambling through the hills of the 65-square-mile nature preserve,
owned and managed by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy, these scenes might
appear idyllic. But for the conservancy's naturalists and ecologists, they
spell disaster.
</P>
<P>
The grazing animals, introduced by man to Catalina's harsh semi-desert climate,
are literally eating away at the island.
</P>
<P>
To protect the island's scarce plants -- some of which are found nowhere else
-- the conservancy has tried for years to reduce the numbers of non-native
animals on the island, at times using controversial measures such as mass
killings.
</P>
<P>
"If let alone, they would totally overrun the place," said Doug Propst,
president of the conservancy.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to control the animals now are more critical than ever, conservancy
officials say, because of the four-year drought dogging Southern California.
</P>
<P>
What little vegetation grows during the winter is quickly eaten, threatening
the survival of some plant species and contributing to erosion.
</P>
<P>
The drought also has exacerbated other concerns of the conservancy: guarding
against fire and regulating water sources needed for residential and commercial
development.
</P>
<P>
"This is a worse drought than any recorded on the island in the past 30 years,"
said Keith LeFever, who manages the island's water supplies for Southern
California Edison.
</P>
<P>
During drought conditions, the animals' hearty appetites threaten to take an
even bigger bite out of the island's unique plant life. Young tree saplings,
for instance, are especially vulnerable to grazing but are crucial for the
nature preserve's survival, said Misty Gay, conservancy naturalist.
</P>
<P>
If the existing saplings are not protected now and new trees do not grow, Gay
warns, then "when our oak trees reach the end of their lives -- 100 or 150
years from now -- we could lose all of them."
</P>
<P>
In the island's interior, it is obvious where boar have ravaged whole hillsides
by uprooting plants and grass, leaving dark brown streaks and tufts of rootless
dying vegetation.
</P>
<P>
Looking out over a hillside where goats have cleared away stretches that look
as bare as the moon, Propst noted: "Everything evolved here under no grazing
pressure. It's a very tender flora."
</P>
<P>
In other parts of the island, conservancy officials say, the land is recovering
as a result of various animal-control measures.
</P>
<P>
This summer, the conservancy has been shipping a weekly average of 20 wild
buffalo to a ranch in Oklahoma. First brought to the island by filmmakers for
the 1924 silent film "The Vanishing American," the buffalo now number about
400, the fourth-largest herd of North American bison. The conservancy hopes to
reduce the herd to 100.
</P>
<P>
Goats, each capable of gobbling up 2,000 pounds of vegetation a year, are
perhaps the most destructive animals on Catalina, Gay said. Spanish
missionaries are believed to have introduced them to the island during the
1800s to help feed the Indian population.
</P>
<P>
Hired sharpshooters killed thousands of goats earlier this year on the island's
small west end, where renewed growth is now visible. Similar programs can be
expected throughout the island in the future, Gay said.
</P>
<P>
The conservancy also allows game hunters to shoot boar, deer and goats during
the fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
"We're not here to run a game preserve," said Propst, who noted that hunting
was the very reason deer and boar were originally brought to the island.
</P>
<P>
Because of the hunting and goat-killing, the conservancy has come under attack
from animal rights groups such as the Fund for Animals.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize that goats are destructive to the habitat, but there are
non-lethal alternatives," including sterilization, said Jerye Mooney, Los
Angeles coordinator for the Fund for Animals.
</P>
<P>
The Fund for Animals is particularly opposed to hunting with bow and arrow, the
only type of hunting now allowed on the island. "Bow-hunting is the cruelest
form," Mooney said, because many animals manage to escape but suffer from
implanted arrows.
</P>
<P>
But the conservancy says both animal and plant life on the island would
eventually be destroyed without the controlled killings -- that vegetation
would be ravaged and the island's animals would have nothing to eat.
</P>
<P>
The conservancy has tried in the past to trap and ship goats off Catalina, but
that led to widespread stress-related illnesses and deaths among the animals,
Propst said. Sterilizing the goats, many of whom live in out-of-the-way
canyons, is impractical, according to the conservancy staff.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't kill the goats, they'd kill themselves and the island with them,"
Gay said.
</P>
<P>
The grazing animals compete with the island's native mammals for scarce food
supplies, putting pressure on rare species such as the Channel Island fox,
listed by the state as endangered, said Penelope O'Malley, spokeswoman for the
conservancy.
</P>
<P>
Conservancy officials point out that the family of chewing-gum magnate William
Wrigley Jr., which owned the island and donated most of it to the conservancy
in 1975, specifically wanted to preserve native plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
The imported animals aren't the only threat to the fragile balance of plants
and wildlife. Although the native plants are well-adapted to drought, the
continuing dryness presents a fire risk in certain of the more heavily wooded
areas, such as the hills north of Avalon.
</P>
<P>
One fire in recent years nearly wiped out a grove of Catalina ironwoods --
tall, slender trees native only to the island.
</P>
<P>
Catalina usually gets between 12 and 14 inches of rain annually, Edison's
LeFever said. But during the last 12 months, there's been less than six inches.
</P>
<P>
Natural pools of water, used for drinking by animals, have dried up, LeFever
said. To help blunt the impact of the drought this summer, water troughs have
been placed in grazing areas for buffalo and other thirsty animals. Blocks of
molasses are also put out in the hills to help animals supplement their protein
diet.
</P>
<P>
The island's other animals -- the 2,500 human residents of Avalon -- also vie
for Catalina's scarce water.
</P>
<P>
To meet Avalon's needs, Southern Edison Co. has drilled wells in the
conservancy area, raising some concern that above-ground water sources, crucial
for plants and animals, might be affected.
</P>
<P>
As a result of a 1962 agreement that predates the conservancy's founding, the
utility company holds all the water rights on the island.
</P>
<P>
Conservancy and Edison company officials said they work together to ensure that
the pumping does not harm the environment. "We show great diligence in not
over-pumping any of the canyons," LeFever said.
</P>
<P>
"We have a gentlemen's agreement with Edison. If any of these spots dry up,
they'll have to stick some water back in there," Propst said.
</P>
<P>
For now, Avalon's impact on the interior is limited, conservancy officials
said. And development plans must be handled in such a way that life in the

<TEXT>     The animals that move into Montana from Yellowstone National Park are
killed in an attempt to keep them from spreading the disease brucellosis to
domestic livestock. The disease causes cattle to abort their young.;    Wayne
Pacelle, national director of the 200,000-member group, said the appeal was
filed Tuesday morning in San Francisco.;    Legality questioned;  "We don't
just want a hearing. We want our legal arguments to be heard," Pacelle said.;
  The fund contends that Lovell's decision failed to focus on legal issues.;
 "The court's pro-hunting opinions and its concern for the reputation of
Montana are irrelevant to this case," he said. "The salient legal issue is the
failure of the state of Montana and the (National) Park Service to obey the
standards of federal and state law.";    The fund contends that Montana's
bison-killing plan violates both the National Environmental Policy Act and the
Montana Environmental Policy Act.;    Long-range study;  The acts forbid
"significant interim action" on the bison while a long-range plan is being
prepared, the fund argues.;    Montana, the Park Service and the U.S. Forest
Service are conducting a long-range study of the bison migration problem that
will not be completed for at least a year, officials say.;    The interim
plan, approved early this month, allows for the shooting of all bison that
cross the park border into Montana.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Beef vs. Chicken: Preference Level Depends on the Bones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beef continues to be No. 1 with American
consumers over chicken, but that is only when the Agriculture
Department doesn't count bones.
   The USDA estimates per capita meat and poultry consumption in
several ways, including the retail weight sold at grocery counters,
and on a retail weight basis without bones.
   If it's the National Cattlemen's Association on an
end-of-the-year campaign to boost beef, the no-bone way is favored.
   Regardless, the association said Thursday that demand for beef
is stabilizing after declining for years. And part of the reason is
that farmers and ranchers have responded to consumer tastes by
producing leaner cuts.
   Looking ahead to 1990, industry leaders said little change is
expected in average per capita beef supplies and average consumer
prices in the coming year.
   According to USDA economists, total beef output may increase
slightly next year but still will remain below production levels in
the 1983-88 period. However, consumer prices are expected to edge
higher by only 1 percent to 2 percent in 1990, compared with 5
percent gains in 1988 and 1989.
   The USDA has figures to prove Americans eat more poultry than
beef. And other figures to prove they eat more beef than poultry.
   Using the method based on bone-in retail weights, USDA says the
per capita consumption of beef in 1990 may drop slightly to an
average of 67.8 pounds from 68.6 pounds in 1989, 72.1 pounds in
1988, and 73.4 pounds in 1987. The peak was 94 pounds in 1976.
   Total poultry, which includes broilers, baking hens and turkeys,
has been setting records annually and is forecast to average 89.4
pounds in 1990, up from 84.4 in 1989, 80.6 in 1988, and 77.8 in
1987, the year when poultry first nudged ahead of beef.
   But the cattle industry said that if you take away the bones,
beef is still way ahead of poultry, and Richard Stillman of USDA's
Economic Research Service agreed.
   Stillman said that on a boneless basis, 1989 per capita beef
consumption may average 67.1 pounds, down from 68.2 in 1988. A
further slight decline is expected in 1990.
   On the same boneless basis, he said, 1989 poultry consumption
may average 59.9 pounds, up from 57.2 pounds in 1988, with another
gain in the works next year.
   Cattle industry leader John Lacey of Paso Robles, Calif.,
president-elect of the National Cattlemen's Association, said the
practice of cutting away fat from retail cuts has helped improve
beef's image. He also cited breeding and feeding advances as
further boosts for the industry.
   Topper Thorpe, general manager of Cattle-Fax, a market
information service, said no dramatic changes are expected in the
nation's cattle herd or in U.S. beef production in 1990.
   But today's total cattle herd of about 100 million head,
including dairy animals, is producing almost as much beef as the
much larger herds of the 1970s, Thorpe told a year-end news
conference.
   Cattle herds peaked at about 132 million head in the mid-1970s
and generally have trended downward because of oversupply, rising
production costs, drought and other factors. Thorpe said the herd
liquidation has ended and a ``modest expansion'' has begun.
   ``Efficient cow-calf operators have made profits during the past
few years,'' Thorpe said. ``Now, if weather is favorable and if
financing becomes cheaper, more producers may hold back heifers and
expand their breeding herds. However, we do not see foresee rapid
expansion.''
   Stillman said in a telephone interview, ``Part of the reason
beef has been declining the last several years was that we've
corrected (the statistics) to allow for a closer trim on retail
cuts.''
   The main reason that today's smaller cattle herd produces almost
as much beef is due to a number of factors, he said.
   ``Genetically, you bred a larger animal,'' Stillman said. ``It's
true in hogs, sheep and lambs ... basically, it's feeding, an
increase in average weights.''
   At last month's USDA outlook conference, economist Steve Reed
said consumer beef prices have set new records each year since
1987. But competition from pork and poultry will have an effect.
   ``With per capita beef supplies beginning to stabilize in 1990,
the higher price of beef compared to competing meats could become a
bigger issue in the coming months,'' Reed said. ``These large
poultry supplies and continued large pork supplies could hold down
beef price gains.''

<TEXT>
   The prairie grass still rustles and the
buffalo still roam on Fred Tromp's place, a mom-and-pop wildlife
refuge where the public can learn about ancient Indians or look at
native wildflowers.
   Tromp, a retiree with a full head of white hair and thick arms
muscled from years of work, turned his family's farmstead back to
nature more than 30 years ago, charging $2.50 a head for a visit to
his Little Mackinaw Wildlife Park.
   ``This is my life,'' he said recently as he surveyed the rolling
hills and the stands of timber where his father and grandfather
once farmed with horse-drawn equipment. ``I don't smoke or drink.
That's not my entertainment.''
   The 400-acre park, 20 miles south of Peoria, is open on
Saturdays and Sundays only. Tromp, 52, commutes to the park from
his home in nearby Pekin for extended stays at a cabin on the land.
   ``If I want entertainment I come out here and mow, or build
fence or fish. I love it here and just want to provide something
for people to come and experience what I do here,'' he said.
   Tromp, a father of seven who runs the park with his wife,
restocked the land with native animals _ about two dozen bison,
about 40 white-tailed deer and sheep.
   The park is Tromp's way of exposing the curious to swamps,
prehistoric Indian culture, the beauty of prairie wildflowers and
the solitude found in the woods.
   He let the prairie grasses grow and built a display on Indians
who once lived on the land.
   ``Visiting Fred's park is more interesting than just about
anything on television,'' said Ralph Hubbard, a regular visitor
from nearby Hopedale.
   ``You get to see a little bit of everything _ the buffalo, wild
geese, deer, tourists. The buffalo are fascinating. And if you look
around you'll probably find some Indian artifacts.''
   The cabin, one room with no running water or electricity, is
attached to a gazebo and dock that overlook a pond, where ducks and
Canada geese splash and the various wildlife drink.
   When the weather is hot and humid, the bison, sheep and deer
disappear into the woods and brush, making sightings scarce by
visitors.
   To keep them happy, Tromp walks ahead of guests, disappearing
into the woods for several minutes before reappearing behind a herd
of bison.
   The land is strewn with shards of pottery, spear points and
other artifacts linked by archaeologists to Indian tribes that
lived between 8,000 to 10,000 B.C. and A.D. 600 to 800.
   Aerial photos tipped scientists to the existence of a mound
built by prehistoric Indians carrying dirt in baskets. It is
unclear whether the site is a burial mound or a location for
ceremonies.
   Tromp erected a display at the mound with stone spear tips, ax
heads, drills and other artifacts he found during his work on the
land.
   ``I'll spend the rest of my life here, I hope,'' he said.

<HEAD>Low Cholesterol Steaks From Cattle Brought by Columbus</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Monday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM H. HEATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maybe Columbus didn't really
discover America - the locals met him on the beach - but he brought
a hedge against cholesterol 500 years before everybody started
worrying about it.
   Argentine ranchers believe criollos, descendants of the hardy
cattle Columbus carried across the sea, can be the basis of new
crossbreeds that will produce leaner steaks for a diet-conscious
age.
   ``Columbus brought the first cattle to the New World on his
second voyage in 1493, and more on his third and fourth trips,''
said Dr. Sol L. Rabasa, a genetecist.
   ``You can accurately say the animals that subsequently populated
the Americas, from the Texas longhorn in the north to what we call
criollo cattle in Latin America, are their direct descendants.''
   Rabasa is president of the 6-year-old Argentine Criollo Cattle
Breeders Association, which is rescuing criollos from
near-extinction, and breeds them on his ranch near Villa Canas, 185
miles west of Buenos Aires.
   He said the criollo and its crossbreeds convert food to muscle
efficiently and produce leaner meat with less marbled fat.
   The Spanish word criollo is used throughout Latin America to
denote people or animals born in the Americas of European
parentage.
   Despite nearly five centuries of independent development, Rabasa
said, the Texas longhorn and Argentine criollo have the same long,
angular, short-haired body and the same colors - brown, red or
piebald.
   Carlos E. Dawney, a rancher and association officer, said the
only real difference is in the horns that give the Texas breed its
name - ``often 60 inches from tip to tip, longer than ours.''
   Rabasa believes Columbus chose the cattle from the arid regions
near Spain's southern ports, selecting animals that were ``gentle
for easy handling and hardy to stand the long trip in cramped
quarters.''
   They were used to establish breeding herds on Cuba and Hispanola
in the Caribbean. From there, they were taken to Mexico, the
Isthmus of Panama and to Peru for distribution through Spain's
South American colonies.
   Criollos arrived in Argentina in the mid-1500s and soon
multiplied into tens of thousands on the pampa, one of the world's
finest natural grazing lands.
   Argentina exported hides, but there was no way to preserve meat
for export and most of it was left to rot.
   Faster ships and use of salt as a preservative made ranching
highly profitable by the 1830s. To boost production, cattlemen
imported such faster-growing British breeds as the Hereford,
shorthorn and Aberdeen Angus.
   Zebu breeds from India, slow-growing and tough but resistant to
heat and disease, were introduced in semitropical northern
Argentina.
   Soon the criollo was seen as inferior and began to disappear,
absorbed by the herds of newcomers or banished to the least
hospitable areas.
   Rabasa, 75, is a former university rector noted for research. He
became interested in the criollo's potential 20 years ago when
ranchers asked him about the possibility of crossing it with Zebu
cattle.
   ``I had to tell them I didn't know, and we set out to find some
evidence,'' he said in an interview.
   A herd of Zebu-criollo crossbreeds was discovered on a ranch in
northwest Chaco province, and ``we found their production levels
and meat quality were surprisingly good,'' Rabasa said.
   Years of research by Rabasa and the National Institute of
Agricultural Technology followed, crossing the criollo with Zebu
and British breeds.
   Studies showed the criollo still had the gentleness prized by
Columbus, combined with superior fertility, body structure that
facilitates calving, resistance to disease and good milk
production, Rabasa said.
   ``The criollo calf gets up as soon as it is born and begins to
drink its mother's milk, allowing the mother to pass more of her
protective antibodies on to the calf during the first 24 hours,''
he said. ``The other breeds are slower to react and their calves
receive fewer antibodies.''
   Skin and eye pigmentation protect criollos and their crossbreeds
from cancers, conjunctivitis and other ailments provoked by the
bright sunlight prevalent in much of the Americas, the geneticist
said.
   Criollos also need water less often and can spend more time
searching for food over a larger area, making them ideal for
marginal land.
   Rabasa and his associates began a search for pure criollos
remaining in Argentina.
   They found them in pockets of the arid, thorn-forested Chaco and
in La Rioja, a desert province. A wild herd turned up in the
Glaciers National Park of southern Patagonia's Andean foothills
about 185 miles from the Strait of Magellan.
   Registered criollo cattle now number between 1,000 and 2,000 and
about 50 commercial herds use them as breeding stock.
   Rabasa said efforts to preserve criollo cattle are under way in
other countries, including the United States, ``where a gread deal
is being done.''
