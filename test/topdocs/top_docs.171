<HEAD>Mississippi Hoping To Cash In On Republican Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BILOXI, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mississippi Gulf Coast officials say they
hope a good share of Republican National Convention delegates
traveling to New Orleans will also drop in on the bordering
Magnolia state.
   Republicans crowding New Orleans for the Aug. 15-18 convention
will receive delegate packets that promote Mississippi attractions
along with those in the host city.
   ``We have always wanted to include the Gulf Coast, especially
since it is only an hour away,'' said Peggy Wilson, chairwoman of
the convention's media and hospitality committee. ``I have gone to
Mississippi to let the Mississippi people feel this is their
convention.''
   Since Vice President George Bush has locked up the GOP
presidential nomination, delegates will have more free time to
visit Mississippi attractions, said Sen. Bob Usey of Gulfport,
Bush's coast campaign coordinator.
   ``New Orleans can only offer so much. I think we will be
pleasantly surprised,'' he added.

MISSISSIPPI STATE SNAPS LOSING STREAK IN BIG WAY, 42-7

<P>
They had to go back -- to 1916 -- in the football record books to match what
happened Saturday night at Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
Ending a 10-game losing streak, Mississippi State used two-touchdown
performances by Orlando Wade and Kenny Roberts to beat Vanderbilt, 42-7, in a
Southeastern Conference opener at Starkville, Miss.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest victory margin ever for Mississippi State in the
Southeastern Conference, which was formed in 1933, and the largest over a team
now in the SEC since 1916, when Mississippi State routed Mississippi, 36-0.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State Coach Rockey Felker said: "We wanted to get off to a good
start and we did. This was a mighty big football win for us because it's that
positive start we've talked about.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be close, nothing like this."
</P>
<P>
The victory ended an 0-7 drought in the SEC over two seasons for Mississippi
State and was only the Bulldogs' fourth win in the SEC in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
The loss was Vanderbilt's sixth straight, including the final five games of the
1988 season.
</P>
<P>
After building a 14-7 halftime lead, Mississippi State, a four-point favorite,
scored on its first four possessions of the second half.
</P>
<P>
Wade ran for touchdowns of one and eight yards to cap third quarter drives, and
Roberts, a redshirt freshman, raced 37 yards for a touchdown late in the third
quarter and 87 for another early in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Tennessee 17, Colorado St. 14 -- In Earle Bruce's first game as the Colorado
State coach, the Rams gave the Volunteers a scare before falling at Knoxville,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
Tennessee scored the winning points on Greg Burke's 21-yard field goal with
8:37 left for a 17-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
Colorado State got close on Kevin Verdugo's two-yard touchdown run and a
two-point conversion pass from Verdugo to Sean Willis. The touchdown came four
plays after Bob Stratman recovered a fumble at the Tennessee 37.
</P>
<P>
Late in the third quarter, Colorado State lined up with 12 men on the field on
a Tennessee punt, allowing the Volunteers to keep possession. They scored seven
plays later on an 11-yard run by Greg Amsler.
</P>
<P>
The Volunteers scored first on a 21-yard run on a fake reverse by Reggie Cobb.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi 20, Memphis St. 13 -- John Darnell passed for 255 yards and one
touchdown as the Rebels won at Memphis, Tenn. Darnell's touchdown pass play to
Willie Green covered 53 yards and gave Ole Miss a 17-3 lead.

Liberty Bowl-bound Mississippi knows how to take advantage of the breaks.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Rebels earned a 21-11 victory over arch-rival Mississippi
State Saturday and will carry that momentum into their Dec. 28 bowl game where
they probably will play Air Force.
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't one of our better performances. Give Mississippi State a lot of
credit, they played good, solid football," said Mississippi Coach Billy Brewer,
who is taking his third Rebel team to a bowl in his seven seasons at his alma
mater.
</P>
<P>
"We were patched up and we played hard for 11 games. This is probably as good
an overall performance by a team that I have coached. To accomplish the seventh
win today against a solid intrastate rival makes this victory very meaningful."
</P>
<P>
In a Southeastern Conference defensive struggle before a crowd of 43,218, Ed
Thigpen and Randy Baldwin scored on one-yard runs and opportunistic Ole Miss
(7-4) won for the sixth time in the last seven games of the series.
</P>
<P>
Ending a two-game losing streak, Mississippi, 4-3 in the SEC, used a fumble
recovery to set up a short second-quarter touchdown drive and then went 93
yards after a pass interception for one of its two fourth-quarter scores.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State (5-6 overall, 1-6 in the SEC), was in the game until a gamble
backfired late in the third quarter and Ole Miss scored two fourth-quarter
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 7-3, Mississippi State had a fourth down and a yard for a first down
at the Ole Miss seven, but Todd Jordan's pitch to Jesse Anderson went awry and
the Bulldogs lost five yards.
</P>
<P>
The loss was particularly disappointing for Mississippi State, which was 1-10 a
year ago and had a shot at a bowl game until a loss last week at Louisiana
State.
</P>
<P>
"It was a physical game and I think we played really well in some spots,"
Mississippi State Coach Rockey Felker said. "But when we had the opportunities,
we didn't take advantage of them.
</P>
<P>
"In particular, the fourth-down call from inside the 10. It seemed after that,
all the momentum swung over to the Ole Miss side."
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State hurt itself with turnovers -- losing the ball three times --
and had a couple of costly penalties in key situations.

FLORIDA DOMINATES MISSISSIPPI STATE, 34-21

<TEXT>
<P>
Shane Matthews passed for 351 yards and three touchdowns and Errict Rhett
rushed for 143 yards and scored on a seven-yard pass reception to lead Florida
to a 34-21 victory over Mississippi State in a Southeastern Conference game
before 72,943 at Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
The 17th-ranked Gators improved to 4-0 overall and 2-0 in the SEC.
</P>
<P>
Florida's offense produced 567 yards in 94 plays, but had two fumbles returned
for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
"I think most of you can tell this team has got a chance for a big year if we
can eliminate those few bad plays that are happening each week," Florida Coach
Steve Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
"We did have some stupid plays, but I really believe our players played with a
tremendous amount of effort. . . . When bad things did happen, nobody put their
head between their legs and nobody started pointing fingers."
</P>
<P>
Matthews completed 27 of 42 passes and also scored on a one-yard quarterback
sneak. Rhett, in his second college start, carried the ball 25 times and was
the main reason Florida was able to build a 2-1 advantage in time of possession
(39:40 to 20:20).
</P>
<P>
But as effective as the Gators' offense was, the defense was better.
Mississippi State was held to 58 yards in the second half and finished with 19
yards net rushing in 21 attempts.
</P>
<P>
"It was a disappointing game," said Bulldog Coach Rockey Felker, whose team had
a two-game winning streak stopped in falling to 2-2 and 0-2.
</P>
<P>
"Last week (against Southern Mississippi) we were able to move the ball, but
Florida's defense caused problems for us," Felker said. "They applied a lot of
pressure and did a good job of keeping us off balance."
</P>
<P>
Matthews bounced back from a subpar performance against Furman with touchdown
passes of seven yards to Rhett, six yards to Kirk Kirkpatrick and 18 yards to
Ernie Mills. Arden Czyzewski also kicked field goals of 45 and 46 yards.
</P>
<P>
"Shane had a little bit of a hip pointer and came in there and had a gutsy
performance. He played super," Spurrier said. "He missed a few here and there,
but he hit for a bunch too. I think he is getting better each week."
</P>
<P>
Mississippi 31, Tulane 21 -- Randy Baldwin broke a 41-year-old Mississippi
single-game rushing record as he ran for 241 yards and two touchdowns in 17
carries in a nonconference game at Oxford, Miss.
</P>
<P>
Baldwin, who had only 80 yards in the first three games, opened the scoring on
his first carry by capping the Rebels' first possession with a 26-yard run. The
senior ended it with a 67-yard scoring run down the left sideline in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi (3-1) overcame five turnovers. Tulane is 2-3.
</P>
<P>
Georgia 19, East Carolina 15 -- Chuck Carswell's punt returns of 14 and 55
yards set up 10 fourth-quarter points at Athens, Ga., as the Bulldogs (3-1)
posted their third consecutive comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
Carswell, who sat out the 1989 season with a neck injury, set up a 51-yard
touchdown drive with his 14-yard return and his 55-yard set up a 20-yard field
goal by John Kasay.
</P>
<P>
Freshman Garrison Hearst capped the 51-yard touchdown drive on a one-yard run
on the first play of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
For East Carolina (2-3), quarterback Jeff Blake had two touchdown pass plays to
Luke Fisher, covering 69 and 14 yards.

WEBB, KELLY LEAD NO. 11 TENNESSEE OVER LSU

<TEXT>
<P>
Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors had a hard time singling out a turning point
Saturday, there were so many.
</P>
<P>
Chuck Webb, who rushed for 134 yards in 30 carries, ran for three touchdowns,
Greg Amsler scored twice, and Carl Pickens ran a kickoff back 93 yards as the
11th-ranked Volunteers outlasted Louisiana State, 45-39, at Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
Tennessee is 6-1 overall and 3-1 in the Southeastern Conference. LSU is 1-6 and
0-3, the Tigers' worst start since 1956.
</P>
<P>
"There were so many plays, I can hardly think about when the big play was in a
game like that," Majors said. "Without a question, the kickoff return had to be
as big a play as any we've had this year."
</P>
<P>
LSU led 14-0 at the end of the first quarter, but Tennessee came back to go in
front, 28-17, early in the third.
</P>
<P>
Volunteer quarterback Andy Kelly, who during a stretch in the first half had
nine consecutive completions, led the comeback.
</P>
<P>
LSU built its early lead on a pair of touchdown pass plays by Tommy Hodson --
30 yards to Tony Moss and two yards to Eddie Fuller.
</P>
<P>
Hodson also hit Fuller with a 23-yard scoring pass midway through the fourth
quarter and connected with Todd Kinchen for an 11-yard touchdown with 26
seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
Hodson, who holds almost all of LSU's passing records, had his first 300-yard
passing game and first rushing touchdown. He threw for 438 yards, completing 31
of 49 passes.
</P>
<P>
After LSU took a 17-14 lead on a field goal with 19 seconds left in the half,
Pickens took the ensuing kickoff at his seven-yard line, started up the middle,
swung to the right sideline and broke into the clear at midfield. He got a key
block on kicker Pedro Suarez at the 25-yard line.
</P>
<P>
Tennessee scored twice in the third quarter, a one-yard plunge by Webb and a
two-yarder by Amsler sandwiched around Hodson's two-yard scoring sneak for LSU.
</P>
<P>
Webb scored his final touchdown on a three-yard run in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Auburn 14, Mississippi State 0 -- James Joseph rushed for a career-high 172
yards and one touchdown in 35 carries in what otherwise was a defensive
struggle that the No. 16 Tigers won at Auburn, Ala.
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless first half, Mississippi State was forced to punt from its six
after taking the second-half kickoff.
</P>
<P>
The Tigers quickly drove 48 yards, with quarterback Reggie Slack scoring from
the two.
</P>
<P>
Joseph, a redshirt junior, later scored on a one-yard run to cap an 81-yard
drive that followed a missed 29-yard field-goal attempt by Joel Logan. The kick
hit the left upright.
</P>
<P>
Auburn is 4-2 and 3-1; the Bulldogs are 4-3 and 1-3.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi 24, Vanderbilt 16 -- For a third consecutive week, Ole Miss used a
fourth-quarter comeback to pull out a victory, using touchdown runs by Russ
Shows and Tyrone Ashley in an SEC game at Oxford, Miss.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Ole Miss scored a touchdown with 31 seconds to go defeat Georgia
and then a week ago beat Tulane on a touchdown with four seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
This time around it was a relative laugher.
</P>
<P>
Ole Miss trailed 10-0 at halftime and 13-10 early in the final quarter against
nine-point underdog Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
But Mississippi drove 70 yards in 11 plays with Shows, a backup quarterback,
scoring from three yards on an option play to make it 17-13. Ole Miss went 79
yards in just four plays for the clinching touchdown, a 16-yard run by Ashley.
</P>
<P>
Ole Miss, 6-2 overall, its best record at this point since 1971, is 3-1 in the
SEC. Vanderbilt is 1-6 and 0-5.
</P>
<P>
Georgia 34, Kentucky 23 -- Rodney Hampton scored touchdowns on runs of 18, 20
and 35 yards as the Bulldogs continued their domination of the Wildcats in this
SEC game at Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
It was the Bulldogs' 11th victory over the Wildcats in the last 12 years and
saddled Kentucky with its 15th consecutive road loss in SEC play.
</P>
<P>
Hampton gained 184 yards in 31 carries and also caught four passes for 43
yards.
</P>
<P>
Hampton's third touchdown came with 2:45 left in the game and was followed by
Kentucky's biggest play of the day, a 100-yard kickoff return by Kurt Johnson.
</P>
<P>
Georgia (4-3 and 3-2) got its other touchdown on a 34-yard pass play, Greg
Talley to Arthur Marshall.
</P>
<P>
Kentucky (4-3 and 1-3) hasn't won an SEC road game since beating Tennessee,
17-2, in 1984.

TENNESSEE BEATS FLORIDA WITH A BURST, 45-3

<TEXT>
<P>
The first half of Saturday night's game between No. 5 Tennessee and No. 9
Florida was the even struggle that most had predicted.
</P>
<P>
But the second half was all Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
Dale Carter returned the second-half kickoff 91 yards for a touchdown to start
a 28-point third quarter that gave Tennessee a 45-3 victory in a Southeastern
Conference showdown at Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
Carter's return gave Tennessee a 14-3 lead and signaled an abrupt end to what
had been a fierce defensive struggle between the Volunteers, 4-0-2 overall and
2-0-1 in the SEC, and the Gators (5-1, 3-1).
</P>
<P>
"Dale's kickoff return really built our confidence," Tennessee quarterback Andy
Kelly said. "Fact is, the entire second half was a confidence-builder. Being
realistic, we thought the game would be much tougher and certainly closer."
</P>
<P>
Florida fumbled on the ensuing possession after Carter's return and the
Volunteer offensive surge gathered momentum. Tennessee drove 68 yards in 10
plays, taking a 21-3 lead on Tony Thompson's 13-yard run.
</P>
<P>
The outburst reached its pinnacle when tight end Von Reeves took a handoff from
Kelly, faded back and threw a perfect 47-yard touchdown pass to Carl Pickens to
make it 28-3 with 4:40 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Florida tried to rally behind reserve quarterback Brian Fox, but he was
intercepted on three consecutive possessions.
</P>
<P>
Tennessee's Reggie Ingram returned one 42 yards for a touchdown to give the
Vols a 35-3 lead and cap the four-touchdown quarter.
</P>
<P>
"In 24 years, I can't remember one quite like it," Tennessee Coach Johnny
Majors said of the outburst. "I don't know that I've ever seen a game break
open like that one did the second half in my life."
</P>
<P>
The homecoming game drew the second-largest crowd in school history, 96,874,
and ended Florida's four-game winning streak in the series.
</P>
<P>
It was Florida's first loss under new Coach Steve Spurrier and represented the
largest margin of defeat in a 20-game series between the teams since 1916. The
previous biggest margin was Tennessee's 40-0 victory in 1944.
</P>
<P>
"We played lousy," Spurrier said. "We were beaten by a better team. It was
fairly close for a half, but things got out of hand fast."
</P>
<P>
No. 24 Mississippi 28, Georgia 12 -- Ricky Baldwin rushed for 106 yards and
scored on runs of three and 13 yards as the Rebels won an SEC game at Athens,
Ga. for the first time in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi had not won at Athens since 1970 when quarterback Archie Manning
led the Rebels to a 31-21 victory.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the toughest places to play in the country, and I thought our
composure in the second half was the difference," Mississippi Coach Billy
Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi (5-1 overall, 2-1 in the SEC), built a 21-3 lead in the first half,
then withstood a Georgia rally that cut the lead to 21-12 six minutes into the
second half.
</P>
<P>
The victory ended a nine-game losing streak on Georgia's home field. It was the
Rebels' second victory in a row over Georgia, after ending a 12-game Bulldog
winning streak in the series last year.
</P>
<P>
Georgia (3-3, 1-2) scored its only touchdown on a 15-yard pass from Greg Talley
to Kevin Maxwell and also got field goals of 22 and 38 yards from John Kasay.
</P>
<P>
"Ole Miss was the better team today," Georgia Coach Ray Goff said. "You can
give all sorts of reasons, but they came out and got the job done. We didn't."
</P>
<P>
Kentucky 17, Mississippi State 15 -- Noseguard Joey Couch deflected a
field-goal attempt with 3:26 left in the game, and Kentucky's defenders blocked
two other tries in leading the Wildcats (2-4, 1-1) to an SEC victory at
Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State (2-3 overall, 0-3 in the SEC) had rallied from a 17-3 deficit
to within 17-15 on Tony Shell's 23-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Bouldin with
14:22 left.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State got the ball with 6:17 left and drove to the Kentucky 31
where Couch blocked Chris Gardner's field-goal attempt.

Auburn Coach Pat Dye wasn't a bit surprised.
</P>
<P>
Darrel Crawford blocked Joel Logan's conversion kick with 2 1/2 minutes to
play, preserving Auburn's 17-16 Southeastern Conference victory over
Mississippi State Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Mississippi State certainly didn't surprise me. I guess I am the only one who
thinks they have a good team," Dye said. "The game turned out exactly like I
expected, but I hoped it wouldn't be that close at the end."
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State, 3-4 overall and 0-4 in the SEC, had a chance to tie the
Tigers (6-0-1, 3-0-1) after David Fair's two-yard run with 2:33 to play. But
Crawford, a junior linebacker, batted down Logan's kick to preserve Auburn's
unbeaten record.
</P>
<P>
Fair's touchdown, on his only carry of the game, capped an 80-yard, nine-play
drive keyed by a pass interference penalty on a third-and-10 play that gave the
Bulldogs a first down at the Tiger 45. Fair scored six plays later.
</P>
<P>
Auburn got what proved to be the margin of victory with 13:25 remaining in the
game when Jim Von Wyl kicked a 20-yard field goal after a drive was halted at
the Mississippi State three.
</P>
<P>
Auburn outgained Mississippi State, 405-292, in handing the Bulldogs their 10th
consecutive SEC defeat and ninth in a row against Dye.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see how you could expect any more from our players," State Coach
Rockey Felker said. "We came through and got the (final) touchdown when we
needed it, but I'm not sure what happened on the extra point."
</P>

Freshman quarterback Stan White directed two second-quarter scoring drives as
Auburn overcame a 3-0 Mississippi State lead.

"We moved the ball pretty well in the first half, we just couldn't quite get

seems to come down to one big play.

<P>
There was no talk of moral victories in the Cal State Fullerton locker room
Saturday night after the Titans' 27-13 loss to Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
Unlike last week's 38-17 loss to Southeastern Conference power Auburn, a
feel-good game for the Titans because they played well in the second half and
weren't completely embarrassed by the nation's third-ranked team, Fullerton
found little solace in its second loss to an SEC school in eight days.
</P>
<P>
What made this defeat less palatable than last week's was that, although it
wasn't a game they should have won, it was a game they certainly could have
won.
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 22,240 in Scott Field was stunned to see Fullerton take a 13-6
halftime lead, but the Titans collapsed in the third quarter, succumbing to
several mistakes, penalties and one costly turnover.
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs scored 21 points in an 8 1/2-minute span of the second half,
saving face for their school and the mighty SEC, considered one of the nation's
strongest football conferences.
</P>
<P>
Two pass interference penalties on consecutive plays accounted for 30 of
Mississippi State's 80 yards on a scoring drive that cut Fullerton's lead to
13-12 midway through the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Tony James returned a punt 51 yards for a touchdown to give the Bulldogs a
20-13 lead with 5:32 left in the third. It was the first time the Titans had
allowed a punt to be returned for a touchdown since 1982.
</P>
<P>
And Fullerton receiver Richard Harrison's fumble after a 34-yard catch was the
impetus for Mississippi State's last scoring drive, which culminated with Tony
Shell's 14-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Bouldin.
</P>
<P>
Fullerton freshman quarterback Terry Payne, in relief of injured starter Paul
Schulte, led the Titans on two long drives in the second half but couldn't
reach the end zone, as the Titans fell to 1-2. Two Fullerton possessions ended
with fourth-down incomplete passes, one from the Bulldog nine-yard line and one
from the 25.
</P>
<P>
"We should have won, no doubt about it," said Payne, who completed 11 of 22
passes for 139 yards. "Last week, we were supposed to be outscored, 55-0, and
we did pretty well. This week, we had the game plan to win and we didn't.
That's disappointing."
</P>
<P>
The Titans could have pointed to several factors that might have contributed to
the loss. They played the second half without Schulte, who completed 6 of 10
passes for 136 yards in the first half before re-injuring his collarbone late
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
They also played without starting cornerback Nuygen Pendleton, who has a
sprained ankle, and two starting linemen, John Cotti and Tim Drevno, who were
slowed by injuries.
</P>
<P>
What's more, on the way to Starkville, the Titans were stranded for six hours
in the Nashville airport because of thunderstorms. What was supposed to have
been an 11-hour journey from their Fullerton campus to Mississippi turned into
a 17-hour trek. The Titans missed a scheduled practice Friday and didn't arrive
at their Columbus, Miss., hotel until 11:45 p.m. (CDT).
</P>
<P>
"But fatigue is just an excuse, not the reason we lost," Fullerton Coach Gene
Murphy said. "We were outslept, though."
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State seemed to doze through the first half and the Titans took
advantage, using a trick here and a few kicks there to take a 13-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State scored first on Joel Logan's 22-yard field goal in the first
quarter, but J.J. Celestine returned the ensuing kickoff 45 yards to give
Fullerton good field position.
</P>
<P>
Schulte hit a wide-open Harrison on a post-pattern for a 43-yard gain to the
Bulldog 14 and, four plays later, Nevin lined up for an apparent 22-yard
field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
But holder Bob Baiz took the snap, rolled to his right and pitched a shovel
pass to Teddy McMillan, normally an inside linebacker, for a three-yard gain
and a first down at the Mississippi State two. Yarbrough scored on the next
play for a 7-3 Fullerton lead.
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, Nevin kicked a 27-yard field goal after a 71-yard drive
to give the Titans a 10-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
Logan's 33-yard field goal made it 10-6, but the Titans drove from their 25 to
the Bulldog 30 in seven plays, the last an 18-yard pass from Payne to Celestine
with three seconds left.
</P>
<P>
Fullerton was out of timeouts, but while the clock stopped for officials to
advance the chains, the Titans got their field-goal unit in position, and Nevin
kicked a 47-yarder just before the halftime gun.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was a little stunned at halftime -- we didn't plan on being behind,"
Mississippi State Coach Rockey Felker said. "But we showed a lot of character
coming back in the second. Maybe it helped us to fall behind like that because
it made us fight and scratch to come back and win."
</P>
<P>
The only thing that seemed to hold the Bulldogs back in the first half was the
inaccuracy of Shell, the senior quarterback who missed several open receivers.
But he found the mark in the second half and finished with 220 yards passing on
14 of 28 attempts.
</P>
<P>
Tailback Tay Galloway added 90 yards rushing for the Bulldogs, while Titan
running back Reggie Yarbrough had 101 yards in 29 carries.
</P>
<P>
However, Yarbrough's fumble on Fullerton's first possession ended a scoring
threat. Schulte had teamed with Celestine on a 58-yard pass play to the
Mississippi State 13, but Yarbrough lost control of a handoff and Albert
Williams recovered for the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
"It was a matter of depth," Murphy said about the loss. "Reggie (Yarbrough) was
tired, the offensive line was hurt and tired, and our defense was on the field
too long in the first half. We turned the ball over, and critical penalties
kept their drives alive. But we played hard."
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes
</P>
<P>
Starting quarterback Paul Schulte's injury is not considered serious, and
Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said Schulte would be back in the lineup for next
week's game at Akron. The senior tried throwing on the sidelines in the third
quarter but was unable to return. "I couldn't throw the ball much more than 10
yards," Schulte said. "I couldn't put any zip on it. I couldn't play." . . .
Fullerton receiver J.J. Celestine caught five passes for 121 yards, and Richard
Harrison caught four passes for 87 yards. . . . More travel travails:
Fullerton's return trip today was pushed up several hours, meaning the Titans
had to leave their hotel at 3:15 a.m. (CDT) for a bus ride to the airport at
Jackson, Miss.

Louisiana State's celebration didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
Just when it appeared a Hail Mary pass had given the Tigers a victory over
Vanderbilt Saturday in a Southeastern Conference game at Nashville, Tenn., it
was ruled that Todd Kinchen, who caught the pass, pushed cornerback Derek
Wilham.
</P>
<P>
The offensive pass-interference call enabled the Commodores to pull off a 24-21
upset.
</P>
<P>
Marcus Wilson, a sophomore quarterback making his first start, scored on a
four-yard run with 1:09 left, giving Vanderbilt the lead.
</P>
<P>
But Chad Loup brought the Tigers right back, moving LSU from its own eight to
the Commodore 42. On fourth and 10 from the 42, the freshman lofted the ball
into the air, and Kinchen came down with it between a pair of Vanderbilt
defenders in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
But the apparent touchdown was wiped out by the pass-interference call, and
Vanderbilt took over with three second left.
</P>
<P>
The victory allowed Vanderbilt, 1-1 overall and 0-1 in the SEC, to snap a
10-game losing streak. LSU is now 2-1 and 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Wilson rushed for 136 yards in 29 carries as he turned in a near flawless
performance in guiding the Vanderbilt wishbone offense.
</P>
<P>
Wilson gave way to backup Mike Healey after LSU had grabbed a 21-17 lead on a
16-yard run by Odell Beckham with 3:34 left. Healey took the Commodores from
their own 21-yard line to the LSU four.
</P>
<P>
Then Wilson returned and, on the first play, faked to Carlos Thomas off right
tackle and followed his fullback into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
No. 19 Florida 27, Furman 3 -- The Gators methodically pulled away from the
nation's top-ranked Division I-AA team at Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
Errict Rhett rushed for 98 yards in his first college start and Shane Matthews
passed for 238 yards and three touchdowns to pace Florida (3-0).
</P>
<P>
Furman, a perennial I-AA power that plays one game a year against a major
college opponent, fell to 3-1. The Paladins averaged 41 points per game in
their first three games but were limited to a first-quarter field goal.
</P>
<P>
Although the score was lopsided, Florida's performance was sloppy. The Gators,
with superior size, wore down the Paladins despite throwing two interceptions
and losing two fumbles.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State 13, Southern Mississippi 10 -- History repeated itself as
Joel Logan kicked a 41-yard field goal with 3:01 left to give the Bulldogs
(2-1) of the SEC a nonconference victory over the Eagles (2-2), an independent,
at Starkville, Miss.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Logan's field goal with four seconds left gave Mississippi State a
26-23 victory over Southern Mississippi, which still leads this series 14-12-1.
</P>
<P>
The Eagles got a chance to win Saturday night, but Jim Taylor's 47-yard
field-goal attempt with 1:15 left was wide left.
</P>
<P>
North Carolina 16, Kentucky 13 -- Clint Gwaltney kicked three field goals --
the last a career-best 50-yarder with 4:31 left -- and the Tar Heels (3-1) of
the Atlantic Coast Conference won a nonconference game against the SEC Wildcats
(1-3) at Chapel Hill, N.C.

<P>
Mississippi's offense sputtered at times behind backup quarterback Russ Shows,
but the 17th-ranked Rebels had just enough to get the job done against
Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
With starter Tom Luke out with an injured left knee, Shows guided the Rebels to
two first-half touchdowns that the defense made stand up for a 14-13
Southeastern Conference victory Saturday at Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
Shows completed eight of 20 passes for 155 yards and one touchdown and ran for
54 yards. Ole Miss halted three second-half Vanderbilt threats, limiting the
Commodores to a pair of field goals in the final 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Randy Baldwin gained 121 yards in 18 carries and Ed Thigpen had 96 yards and a
touchdown in 16 carries for Ole Miss, 7-1 overall and 3-1 in the SEC.
</P>
<P>
Vanderbilt (1-6, 1-4) has lost 21 of its last 23 games.
</P>
<P>
"This was just a remarkable football game," said Mississippi Coach Billy
Brewer, whose Rebels are nationally ranked for the time time since 1986. "We
were able to do the things in the end it took to win.
</P>
<P>
"Offensively, we just didn't have the rhythm we had in the last several games.
I don't know whether that's because Tommy didn't play or what. We just weren't
very consistent.
</P>
<P>
"You're going to get your opponent's best shot when you are a ranked team. This
was a golden opportunity for Vanderbilt."
</P>
<P>
The Rebels had 291 yards in 56 rushes and 446 yards overall to Vanderbilt's
314.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi led at halftime, 14-7.
</P>
<P>
Kentucky 26, Georgia 23 -- Doug Pelfrey kicked a 32-yard field goal with seven
seconds left in the game to give the Wildcats an SEC victory over the Bulldogs
at Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
Georgia (4-4, 2-3) went ahead, 24-23, when Chuck Carswell took Bill Hawk's punt
at the 31, broke right and raced 69 yards untouched down the sidelines with
6:19 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
Kentucky (3-5, 2-2) began its winning, 80-yard drive when Freddie Maggard,
replacing the injured Brad Smith at quarterback in the fourth quarter, passed
to Phil Logan for a 22-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
Maggard later connected on an eight-yard pass to Logan to the Georgia 45, a
17-yarder to Terry Samuels to the 30 and a 10-yarder to Rodney Jackson to the
23 with 40 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Kentucky then ran off four plays to the 14 before Pelfrey came on for his
winning kick.

<TEXT>     Twice, including last season, Florida had the best record in the SEC but
was denied the championship because of NCAA probation.;   "We've got it in
front of us," linebacker Carlton Miles said. "We're going to do whatever we
can to get it.";   What Florida hasn't been able to do in the past -- at least
when the team had the NCAA's blessing -- is get by the back-to-back blitz of
Auburn and Georgia. Seven times since 1960, the Gators have come in unbeaten
in the SEC, only to miss the championship by losing to either Georgia or
Auburn.;   "When the score got to 17-10, I'm sure a lot of people said, 'Ah,
here comes Auburn. They're coming back,' " Florida Coach Steve Spurrier said.
"But none of our players or coaches showed me any signs of panic.";   The
Gators, ranked first in the SEC against the run, limited Auburn (4-4, 2-3) to
85 yards rushing in 29 carries.;   On offense, Shane Matthews threw for 264
yards and two touchdowns and ran for another score. Twelve of his passes went
to Willie Jackson, who had a touchdown and accounted for 157 receiving yards.;
ALABAMA 13, MISSISSIPPI STATE 7: Stacy Harrison scored on a 64-yard

completed 28 of 37 passes for 319 yards, directed scoring drives of 64, 75,
65, 75, 58, 72, 60 and 55 yards. Freshman Aaron Hayden rushed 169 yards in 18

CAROLINA 38, TULANE 28: Jeff Blake threw three touchdown passes to Hunter
Gallimore to help the 17th-ranked Pirates (7-1) beat the Green Wave (0-9) in
Greenville, N.C.;   Blake became East Carolina's career leader in touchdown
passes (34), passing yardage (4,152) and completions (287). Travis Hunter, who

DIVISION I-AA CITADEL USES WISHBONE TO KNOCK OFF SOUTH CAROLINA, 38-35

<P>
Quarterback Jack Douglas scored from the one on fourth down with 22 seconds
left to give The Citadel a 38-35 victory over South Carolina Saturday at
Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
It was the Division I-AA Bulldogs' first victory over South Carolina since 1950
and first in Columbia since 1919. It was also the Gamecocks' first loss to a
I-AA opponent since 1982.
</P>
<P>
Douglas rushed for 104 yards and completed seven of nine passes for 125 yards
in directing the Bulldogs' wishbone attack.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time South Carolina had seen the wishbone since 1977 -- and it
showed. The Citadel moved the ball at will, gaining 396 yards against the
fourth-ranked defense in the nation, which had been giving up only 232 yards a
game.
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs (4-3) scored 10 points in the final 3:11 to earn the victory
before a crowd of 63,000 at Williams-Brice Stadium.
</P>
<P>
After The Citadel made it 35-31 on Howard Barnard's 37-yard field goal,
Torrence Forney recovered the ensuing onside kick for the Bulldogs at the South
Carolina 41-yard line.
</P>
<P>
Douglas hooked up with Terrance Young on a 24-yard pass to the 16. Douglas
fumbled on the next play, but the Bulldogs recovered at the 10. Douglas scored
four plays later.
</P>
<P>
South Carolina Coach Sparky Woods said the Gamecocks (4-2) weren't looking past
the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
"This game was a heartbreaker," he said. "They're a tough football team."
</P>
<P>
South Carolina had enough yards (480) on offense to win, just not enough
points.
</P>
<P>
No. 22 Clemson 24, North Carolina State 17 -- The Tigers needed every advantage
their nationally- ranked defense could provide to escape with an Atlantic Coast
Conference victory over the Wolfpack at Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
The struggle between Clemson, ranked second in total defense, and the Wolfpack,
ranked seventh, featured seven fumbles -- four by N.C. State. The third fumble
set up fullback Howard Hall's one-yard touchdown with 3:02 left that gave the
Tigers the victory. The fourth came on the ensuing kickoff, with Clemson's
David Joy recovering.
</P>
<P>
Clemson, 6-2, 3-2 in the ACC, and N.C. State (4-4, 2-4) were tied, 17-17, after
three quarters.
</P>
<P>
Clemson's Ronald Williams fumbled inside the Wolfpack 20 with 5:05 left, but
N.C. State quarterback Terry Jordan returned the favor three plays later to
give the Tigers the ball at the 11. Hall scored two plays later.
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State rolled up 328 yards against a defense that has been
allowing an average of 202 a game.
</P>
<P>
Clemson quarterback DeChane Cameron completed 14 of 26 passes for 182 yards and
Williams rushed for 95 yards in 26 carries, 87 yards coming in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Maryland 23, Duke 20 -- Dan DeArmas kicked three field goals in the second
half, including the game-winning 20-yarder with 50 seconds left, as the
Terrapins (3-4, 0-3) held off the Blue Devils (3-4, 0-3) in an ACC game at
Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
Blue Devil quarterback Billy Ray had thrown a 27-yard touchdown pass to Walter
Jones with 12 minutes left to tie the score, 20-20.
</P>
<P>
Southern Mississippi 23, Memphis State 7 -- Brett Favre's passing set up two
touchdowns and Jim Taylor kicked three field goals to lead the Golden Eagles
(6-2) over the Tigers (3-3-1) at Hattiesburg, Miss. Southern Mississippi held
Memphis State to 191 yards and 11 first downs.

<P>
It took Siran Stacy a long time to get back to Alabama, but when he arrived he
made it "an emotional happening."
</P>
<P>
A junior starting his first game at Alabama, the 5-foot-11, 195-pound halfback
tied two school records in scoring four times as the 16th-ranked Crimson Tide
defeated Memphis State, 35-7, Saturday at Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
"I've dreamed about playing here all my life," said Stacy, who went from
Geneva, Ala., to Coffeeville Junior College in Kansas, where he led all junior
college players in scoring last season.
</P>
<P>
Stacy was the first Alabama runner since 1945 to gain more than 100 yards in
his first game, winding up with 169, including scoring runs of 44 and 64 yards
against the winless Tigers.
</P>
<P>
Stacy, who also scored from the six and one, tied the school record for most
rushing touchdowns in a game and most points in a game.
</P>
<P>
Tennessee 28, Duke 6 -- Reggie Cobb ran for three touchdowns and 109 yards,
including a career-high 61-yard run, to lead the 17th-ranked Volunteers to a
victory over the Blue Devils at Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
Duke (1-2) threatened several times using their vaunted passing attack, but
could only manage two field goals.
</P>
<P>
Tennessee (3-0) stopped the Blue Devils with key interceptions by Darryl Hardy,
Mark Fletcher and Earnest Fields.
</P>
<P>
Auburn 24, So. Mississippi 3 -- James Joseph rushed for a career-high 149 yards
in 23 carries and Lamar Rogers led a relentless Auburn defense as the No. 5
Tigers defeated the Golden Eagles at Auburn, Ala.
</P>
<P>
The Auburn defense, one of the nation's toughest in 1988, held its opponent
without a touchdown for the second straight week as the Tigers improved to 2-0.
</P>
<P>
Southern Miss, which upset then-No. 3 Florida State to open the season, could
not put together a touchdown drive as Rogers and Craig Ogletree continuously
pressured quarterback Brett Favre, dropping the Golden Eagles to 1-2.
</P>
<P>
Georgia 15, Baylor 3 -- Quarterback Greg Talley scored on a four-yard run and
John Kasay kicked three field goals to lead the Bulldogs to a win the Bears at
Athens, Ga., making Bulldog Coach Ray Goff's debut a successful one.
</P>
<P>
Baylor (0-2) took a 3-0 lead early in the second quarter on a 32-yard field
goal by Jeff Ireland, but Georgia (1-0) scored 12 consecutive points to take a
12-3 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Florida 34, Louisiana Tech 7 -- Kyle Morris threw long scoring passes to three
receivers as the Gators ended a streak of 10 consecutive games without a
touchdown pass at Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
Ernie Mills and Tony Lomack scored on pass plays of 69 and 84 yards,
respectively, and Morris threw 43 yards to Terence Barber for a third-quarter
touchdown that helped the Gators pull away from a 10-7 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
Florida (1-1) had not scored on a touchdown pass since beating Indiana State,
58-0, on Sept. 17, 1988.
</P>
<P>
The three that Morris threw Saturday equaled his total of all last season, when
Gators lost five of their last six games.
</P>
<P>
Louisiana Tech is now 1-2.
</P>
<P>
Kentucky 13, North Carolina 6 -- Alfred Rawls scored a seven-yard touchdown on
the opening series and the Wildcats' defense dominated the Tar Heels at
Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
Kentucky (2-0) drove 72 yards in 11 plays with Rawls going around left end for
the score with 10:03 left in the first period for a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
Kentucky's Ken Willis connected on a 33-yard field goal for a 10-3 halftime
advantage and added a career-long 50-yard kick in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
North Carolina is now 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi 34, Arkansas St. 31 -- John Darnell threw for 412 yards and three
touchdowns as the Rebels rallied in the second half at Oxford, Miss.
</P>
<P>
Darrell had touchdown passes of 57, 42 and 46 yards to senior flanker Pat
Coleman. With five receptions, Coleman had 200 yards -- a school record.

<MEMO>  College Football; South  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Florida (5-1, 4-0), 9-0 at home the past two seasons, scored twice after
fumbles by Tennessee's Andy Kelly. The Gators also intercepted three of the
Tennessee quarterback's passes intended for Carl Pickens, the Volunteers'
explosive wide receiver.;   Pickens finished with seven receptions for 145
yards.;   Tennessee dropped to 4-1, 2-1.; MIAMI 26, PENN STATE 20: In Miami,
the second-ranked Hurricanes (5-0) persevered over the ninth-ranked Nittany
Lions (5-2) with a stunning propensity for big plays.;   Horace Copeland's
80-yard touchdown reception, Kevin Williams' 91-yard punt return and Lamar
Thomas' 42-yard touchdown catch buried Penn State's bid for an upset.;   The
Hurricanes survived 11 penalties (for 124 yards) and a last-minute blunder by
Darryl Williams, whose mistake was overlooked by officials.;   Williams
intercepted Tony Sacca's fourth-down pass at Miami's 1-yard line and ran
around in the end zone for a few seconds before crossing the goal line
momentarily and then returning to the end zone and running out of it for an
apparent safety. But the officials ruled the ball down at the 1 with 1 minute,
4 seconds left, allowing the Hurricanes to run out the clock.;   "The ruling
was momentum," referee John Nealon said. "The defender caught the ball on the
1-yard line, and his momentum carried him into the end zone. When you catch a
ball in the field of play and momentum carries you into the end zone, the ball
is spotted where the catch occurred.";   Penn State had closed to within six
points on Sacca's 9-yard pass to Terry Smith with 9:35 left.;   "Like Tyson
and Foreman," said Miami defensive tackle Anthony Hamlet, who a week earlier
had predicted the Hurricanes would beat Penn State by three touchdowns. "It
was just a matter of who was going to be standing at the end. I'm glad it was
us."; CLEMSON 20, VIRGINIA 20: Nelson Welch kicked a 40-yard field goal with
46 seconds left to give the 18th-ranked Tigers (3-1-1, 1-0-1) a tie with the
Cavaliers (3-2-1, 1-2-1) in an Atlantic Coast Conference game in Clemson,
S.C.;   Virginia drove to the Clemson 17 in the final seconds, but Michael
Husted's 34-yard field goal was short with five seconds left.; ALABAMA 62,
TULANE 0: Freshman David Palmer scored on a 69-yard punt return and two pass
receptions, and the 19th-ranked Crimson Tide (5-1) rolled over the Green Wave
(0-7) in Tuscaloosa, Ala.; GEORGIA 37, MISSISSIPPI 17: Larry Ware ran for 166
yards and two touchdowns as the 22nd-ranked Bulldogs (5-1, 2-1) ran past No.
23 Ole Miss (5-2, 1-2) in an SEC game in Oxford, Miss.; AUBURN 24, VANDERBILT
22: Jim Von Wyl, who had missed a field-goal attempt three minutes earlier,
connected from 27 yards with 1:27 to play, lifting the Tigers (4-2, 2-1) to an
SEC win over the Commodores (1-5, 0-3) in Nashville, Tenn.; OTHER GAMES:
Quarterback Sleepy Robinson ran for one touchdown, passed for a second and
rushed for 134 yards, sparking Mississippi State (4-2, 1-1) to a 31-6 SEC
victory over Kentucky (2-3, 0-2) in Starkville, Miss. . . . North Carolina

Eagles didn't surprise Coach Curley Hallman.
</P>
<P>
"We've got a bunch of doers," Hallman said after Brett Favre's two-yard
touchdown pass to Anthony Harris in the final minute gave Southern Mississippi
a 30-26 victory over the sixth-ranked Seminoles. "We knew it before we came
down here."
</P>
<P>
Florida State took a 26-24 lead midway through the final quarter on Bill
Mason's 27-yard field goal before Southern Mississippi put together a 6:34
drive to set up Favre's winning pass with 23 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
"The coach told us, 'If you have them in the fourth quarter, you will win it,'
" Favre said after completing 21 of 39 passes for 282 yards and two touchdowns.
"We knew they were scared."
</P>
<P>
Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden said he knew beforehand that Favre would be a
handful for his young secondary.
</P>
<P>
"He could make big plays and keep drives going," Bowden said. "Favre was good
enough that he took advantage of mistakes we made."
</P>
<P>
Actually, Southern Mississippi could have won the game in a runaway, but the
Golden Eagles made three turnovers inside the Florida State 15.
</P>
<P>
The Seminoles took advantage of the first two Southern Mississippi turnovers to
take a 10-0 lead on their first two possessions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Golden Eagles came back, capitalizing on fumbles by Florida
State's Shannon Baker and Dexter Carter to take a 17-10 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't knock them out when we had them down the first half," Bowden said.
"We couldn't make the big plays."
</P>
<P>
Southern Mississippi took its first lead with 11 seconds left in the first half
when Favre lobbed a four-yard scoring pass to Alfred Williams.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Ray Jackson's three-yard run tied the game, 10-10, early in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Seminoles rebounded from the 17-10 halftime deficit with a pair of
touchdowns in the third quarter to take a 23-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Dawsey caught a 23-yard scoring pass from Peter Tom Willis, and Dexter
Carter added a nine-yard touchdown run. But a bad snap prevented Mason from
making the extra point. Carter, who rushed for 118 yards, also scored the
game's first touchdown on an 11-yard run.
</P>
<P>
Willis completed 25 of 40 passes for 269 yards for the Seminoles, who have lost
their opener two straight seasons. Miami defeated Florida State, 31-0, a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
The Seminoles were 10-2 each of the last two seasons, losing both years to
Miami.

FLORIDA EXTENDS ALABAMA'S STREAK, 17-13
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Will White looked into the eyes of Alabama quarterback Gary Hollingsworth, and
what he saw there helped No. 24 Florida extend Alabama's longest losing streak
in 34 years.
</P>
<P>
White intercepted three Hollingsworth passes and Richard Fain covered a blocked
punt for the winning touchdown as Florida defeated the Crimson Tide, 17-13,
Saturday in a Southeastern Conference game at Tuscaloosa, Ala.
</P>
<P>
It was Alabama's fourth consecutive loss, and its second this season under new
coach Gene Stallings. Hollingsworth also had three passes intercepted in
Alabama's 24-21 loss to Southern Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
"All week long we studied how Hollingsworth looks at his receivers before he
throws," White said. "He holds it really long, and by reading his eyes and
knowing where the receiver was, I made the picks."
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Spencer blocked an Alabama punt on the second play of the final quarter,
and Fain recovered in the end zone to give Florida a 17-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
Florida (2-0), overcoming a 10-point deficit, gave its new coach, Steve
Spurrier, his first SEC victory.
</P>
<P>
Stallings said he thought the Crimson Tide played much better than a week ago,
"but the bottom line is we still lost the game."
</P>
<P>
Florida sophomore quarterback Shane Matthews completed 21 of 37 passes for 267
yards and a touchdown -- a six-yarder to Terrence Barber that came after
Alabama had taken a 10-0 lead on Hollingsworth's 15-yard pass to Craig
Sanderson and Philip Doyle's 41-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
No. 2 Auburn 24, Mississippi 10 -- The Tigers produced 367 yards of offense,
but couldn't put away Ole Miss until Dennis Wallace returned an intercepted
pass 36 yards for a touchdown with 24 seconds left in a SEC opener at Jackson,
Miss.
</P>
<P>
Auburn (2-0) trailed, 10-9, in the third quarter when freshman quarterback Stan
White led the Tigers on a 59-yard scoring drive.
</P>
<P>
James Joseph gained 35 yards in three carries during the drive that ended when
White connected with Greg Taylor on a 26-yard scoring play with 8:52 left in
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Tigers added a two-point conversion for a 17-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi drove to the Auburn 11 with 5 1/2 minutes remaining, but an illegal
procedure call and a 16-yard sack by Walter Tate led to a failed 46-yard
field-goal attempt.
</P>
<P>
Ole Miss (1-1) had two other late possessions, the first ending on downs and
the other when Wallace made the clinching interception.
</P>
<P>
"We knew they had the tools and ability to come back," White said. "They did
and they fought hard."
</P>
<P>
Joseph led Auburn's rushing attack with 119 yards in 22 carries.
</P>
<P>
White completed 16 of 31 passes for 208 yards.
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got a pretty good chance to be a decent team before it's over,"
said Auburn Coach Pat Dye, whose team limited Mississippi to 114 yards.
</P>
<P>
Auburn, after its fourth straight SEC title, led 9-0 after the first two series
of the game before a crowd of 41,500.
</P>
<P>
Led by White's passing, the Tigers rolled 62 yards in eight plays after the
kickoff. White completed three of four passes for 38 yards and Joseph ran the
final five yards for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi's first three plays from scrimmage lost 13 yards and on fourth down
Charles Childers' punt was batted out of the end zone by Bennie Pierce for a
safety.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi got rolling late in the second quarter behind No. 2 quarterback Tom
Luke, who drove the Rebels to the Auburn six but then was taken out after
suffering a concussion.
</P>
<P>
Three plays later, Russ Shows threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Camp Roberts
to complete the 75-yard drive.
</P>
<P>
LSU 35, Miami (Ohio) 7 -- Harvey Williams tied a school record by running for
four touchdowns as the Tigers routed the Redskins at Baton Rogue, La.
</P>
<P>
The LSU record was set in 1977 by Charles Alexander against Oregon and also
tied in 1984 by Dalton Hilliard against Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
LSU is 2-0; Miami 0-3.
</P>
<P>
Williams' touchdowns were from five yards and four yards in the second quarter,
and from four yards and three yards in the third.
</P>
<P>
Second-string quarterback Chad Loup got LSU's other touchdown on a run from
three yards out in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Tennessee 56, Texas El Paso 0 -- The Volunteers limited outmanned UTEP to
148 total yards, including just 45 in 32 rushing attempts, in breezing to a
victory at Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
UTEP's Mike Perez was sacked five times and finished with minus 31 yards
rushing. He completed 12 of 27 passes for 103 yards.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tennessee offense ground out 510 yards. Thirteen players carried
the ball at least once as Tennessee quit passing early in the second half and
Johnny Majors cleared his bench.

Ron Lee (Chuckie) Mullins, a University of Mississippi free safety, suffered a
paralyzing neck injury Saturday when he made a first-quarter tackle in the
Rebels' game against Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
Mullins, a 6-foot, 170-pound redshirt freshman from Russellville, Ala., was
airlifted 75 miles to Baptist Central Hospital in Memphis, Tenn. A spokesman in
the hospital's critical care unit said no condition was immediately available.
</P>
<P>
Mullins suffered a fractured-dislocation of the fourth and fifth cervical
vertebrae in the neck, said Leroy Mullins, Mississippi's trainer.
</P>
<P>
Mullins, was carried from the field on a stretcher with 6:57 left in the first
quarter of the Rebels' 24-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
Mullins was injured when he made a jarring tackle on Vanderbilt's Brad Gaines
at the Ole Miss three-yard-line to break up a pass play.
</P>
<P>
"He immediately told us he could not feel anything," Leroy Mullins said.
</P>
<P>
The trainers cut off a portion of Mullins' face mask and hinged it back in case
they needed to assist his breathing, said school spokesman Langston Rogers.
</P>
<P>
"Shallow breathing was evident," said Leroy Mullins, who is not related to the
victim.
</P>
<P>
"Chuckie (Mullins' nickname) is paralyzed from the neck down. I've been an
athletic trainer for more than 25 years, and this is the worst on-the-field
injury I have been involved with.
</P>
<P>
"It's the type situation you constantly worry about and hope you never face."
</P>
<P>
Rogers said Mullins never lost consciousness and talked to the trainers the
entire time they worked with him.

Rodney Hampton scored two touchdowns in a three-minute span of the second half
Saturday as Georgia overcame a sluggish start and upset No. 20 Florida, 17-10,
at Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
Hampton outrushed Florida's Emmitt Smith, 121 yards to 106, and had touchdown
runs of 10 and two yards to lift the Bulldogs to a 17-7 lead with with 3:54
left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs, 6-3 overall and 4-2 in the Southeastern Conference, held Florida
to a 24-yard field goal by John David Francis the rest of the way to win for
the 14th time in the last 18 meetings.
</P>
<P>
Florida, a last-minute loser to Auburn a week ago, was hoping to stay in the
running for a Jan. 1 bowl game but fell to 6-3 and 3-3 before a neutral-site
crowd of 81,577 at the Gator Bowl.
</P>
<P>
Ben Smith led the Georgia defense with two of the Bulldogs' three interceptions
of quarterbacks Donald Douglas and Lex Smith. Georgia also recovered a fumble
and stopped Florida twice on downs to kill third-quarter scoring threats.
</P>
<P>
Auburn 38, Louisiana Tech 23 -- Alexander Wright scored two touchdowns and set
up another with a 73-yard kickoff return as the No. 12 Tigers scored 28 points
in a 2:30 span in a nonconference game at Auburn, Ala.
</P>
<P>
Darrell Williams also scored twice for the Tigers (7-2), who trailed 10-7 at
the end of the first quarter. Louisiana Tech, which completed its first season
of NCAA Division I play, dropped to 5-4-1.

<P>
After a "fumblerooskie" play backfired on Florida State and helped Auburn tie
the score, Jim Von Wyl kicked a 38-yard field goal with two seconds remaining,
moving the fifth-ranked Tigers into the thick of the national championship race
with a 20-17 victory over the seventh-ranked Seminoles Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Stan White helped set up the winning kick with a fourth-down,
21-yard completion to Herbert Casey. After letting the clock run down to six
seconds, Von Wyl came on to kick his second game-winner of the year. Two weeks
ago, his 30-yarder beat Louisiana Tech, 16-14.
</P>
<P>
Stacy Danley tied the score, 17-17, diving over from the two with 3:47
remaining to cap a 57-yard drive that started after the blown "fumblerooskie."
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Casey Weldon put the ball on the ground for a lineman to pick up,
but it was Auburn's Walter Tate who covered it.
</P>
<P>
After Danley's touchdown, Weldon, who came off the bench to pass for 244 yards,
led the Seminoles back to the Auburn 37. But on fourth and five, Weldon was
grabbed by Ricky Sutton, stumbled backwards while trying to keep his balance
and finally fell for a 22-yard loss with 1:04 to play.
</P>
<P>
That led to Von Wyl's kick.
</P>
<P>
Auburn (5-0-1), which came back from a 17-7 halftime deficit, won on a Saturday
when two higher-ranked teams, No. 2 Miami and No. 3 Tennessee, were beaten.
Tennessee's 9-6 loss to Alabama was particularly important to Auburn, moving
the Tigers into sole possession of first place in the Southeastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
Florida State (4-2) had its national championship hopes dashed as Auburn
snapped a three-game losing streak in the series.
</P>
<P>
Weldon, who had passed for only 223 yards in Florida State's first five games,
entered the game late in the first quarter in place of starter Brad Johnson and
sparked the Seminoles to 17 second-quarter points.
</P>
<P>
Alabama 9, No. 3 Tennessee 6 -- Alabama came up with an unorthodox way to
generate some offense in the midst of a defensive struggle, and Philip Doyle
made it pay off.
</P>
<P>
The result was a 9-6 upset of No. 3 Tennessee Saturday at Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
The offense came in the form of a blocked field-goal attempt with 1:35 left.
The ball bounced hard off the chest of the Crimson Tide's Stacy Harrison and
bounced 23 yards downfield to the Tennessee 37.
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, Doyle won it with a 47-yard field goal, his third of the
game, as time expired.
</P>
<P>
It was a big victory for Alabama Coach Gene Stallings, whose team improved to
3-3, 2-2 in the Southeastern Conference. Tennessee fell to 4-1-2 and 2-1-1.
</P>
<P>
The blocked field goal "worked out great for us," Stallings said. "It gave us
30 or 40 yards when we needed offense. It was great to get that. We hadn't made
that much in a while."
</P>
<P>
Tennessee had a nation-leading, 12-game unbeaten streak halted.
</P>
<P>
No. 17 Florida 59, Akron 0 -- The Gators (6-1), coming off a 45-3 loss to
Tennessee, bounced back with an easy victory over outmanned Akron at
Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Shane Matthews paced an offense that produced 595 yards, completing
20 of 32 passes for 283 yards and three touchdowns. Willie McClendon rushed for
105 yards and one score.
</P>
<P>
Akron (3-4-1) gained only 87 yards and didn't make a first down in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
Georgia 39, Vanderbilt 28 -- Garrison Hearst rushed for 127 yards and two
touchdowns and Joe Dupree and Andre Hastings connected on a 68-yard touchdown
pass play for the Bulldogs in an SEC game at Athens, Ga. The Bulldogs (4-3,
2-2) also got a 58-yard touchdown run from Larry Ware and John Kasay kicked
field goals of 38 and 48 yards. It was the 21st consecutive SEC road loss for
the Commodores (1-5, 1-3).
</P>
<P>
LSU 30, Kentucky 20 -- Harvey Williams rushed for a career-high 213 yards in 28
carries, scored on a 60-yard run, and caught a four-yard touchdown pass to lead
Louisiana State (4-2, 2-2) over the Wildcats (2-5, 1-2) at Baton Rogue, La.
</P>
<P>
No. 18 Mississippi 42, Arkansas State 13 -- Randy Baldwin scored four
touchdowns in the first 19 minutes as Ole Miss (6-1) routed the Division I-AA
Indians at Oxford, Miss. The Rebels rolled up 495 yards, one shy of their
season high. They also ensured a second consecutive winning season, the first
time Ole Miss has accomplished that since 1970-71.

<TEXT>     Matthews broke up a defensive struggle with scoring passes of 23 yards to
Tre Everett and 13 yards to Willie Jackson after Florida built a 6-0 halftime
lead on field goals of 44 and 48 yards by Arden Czyzewski.;   Jackson also
caught a 12-yard TD pass in the fourth quarter, giving him three career
receptions -- all for touchdowns.; AUBURN 23, MISSISSIPPI 13: Redshirt
freshman Thomas Bailey returned a punt 83 yards for a touchdown and Joe
Frazier, another redshirt freshman, ran 59 yards for a score as the No. 15
Tigers (2-0) won a Southeastern Conference game in Auburn, Ala.;   Bailey's
punt return, the third longest in Auburn history, came with 25 seconds left in
the first half and seemed to wake up the Tigers, who trailed 6-3 at the time.
It was the first touchdown allowed by the Rebels (2-1) this season.;
MISSISSIPPI STATE 48, TULANE 0: Sophomore Greg Plump ran for two TDs and
passed for another in his first collegiate start as the 25th-ranked Bulldogs
(2-0) beat the Green Wave (0-3) in Starkville, Miss.; SYRACUSE 31, MARYLAND
17: Syracuse's offense had more turnovers than scoring plays in College Park,
Md., but it didn't matter, because the 22-ranked Orangemen's defense and
special teams made up the difference against the Terps (1-1).;   Syracuse
(2-0), which had four turnovers, didn't score a touchdown on offense in the
second half and got only three first downs. But the defense had three
interceptions and Shelby Hill returned a punt 61 yards in the fourth quarter
to cement the win.; OTHER GAMES: Carlos Thomas ran 32 yards for a touchdown
and Rico Francis returned an interception 31 yards for a score as Vanderbilt
(1-1) snapped the nation's third-longest losing streak (11) in Nashville,
Tenn., with a 14-11 victory over Southern Methodist (0-2), which has lost 12
straight. Fullerton State is worst at 13. . . . Keith West threw three TD
passes, two to Todd Dixon, as Wake Forest won its opener 40-24 over Western
Carolina (0-2) in Winston-Salem, N.C. . . . Randy Jordan returned to action
after a one-year injury layoff and rushed for 106 yards and two scores as
North Carolina opened its season with a 51-16 victory over Cincinnati (0-2) in
Chapel Hill, N.C. . . . Backup quarterback Bobby Goodman helped Virginia (1-1)

ALABAMA FINDS WAY TO BEAT TENNESSEE

<P>
Alabama came up with an unorthodox way to generate some offense in the midst of
a defensive struggle, and Philip Doyle made it pay off.
</P>
<P>
The result was a 9-6 Alabama upset of No. 3 Tennessee Saturday at Knoxville,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
The offense came in the form of a blocked field-goal attempt with 1:35 left in
the game. The ball bounced hard off the chest of the Crimson Tide's Stacy
Harrison and bounced 23 yards downfield to the Tennessee 37.
</P>
<P>
Four plays later, Doyle won it with a 47-yard field goal, his third of the
game, as time expired.
</P>
<P>
"When the ball was blocked, when I saw the ball rolling past the 50-yard line,
I knew it was a victory all the way," Harrison said. "We have one of the best,
if not the best, kickers in the nation. The whole team has a lot of confidence
in him."
</P>
<P>
It was a big victory for Alabama Coach Gene Stallings, whose team improved to
3-3 overall and 2-2 in the Southeastern Conference. Tennessee fell to 4-1-2 and
2-1-1.
</P>
<P>
The blocked field goal "worked out great for us," Stallings said. "It gave us
30 or 40 yards when we needed offense. It was great to get that. We hadn't made
that much in a while."
</P>
<P>
Doyle called it "the biggest kick of my life."
</P>
<P>
"Every kid dreams of winning the game on the last play, and to do it my senior
year against the No. 3 team in the country is the most unbelieveable feeling
I've ever had."
</P>
<P>
Defense dominated on both sides. Alabama held Tennessee to 175 yards, and the
Crimson Tide offense managed 222.
</P>
<P>
Doyle had field goals of 30 and 26 yards earlier in the game. Tennessee's Greg
Burke had a 20-yarder in the first quarter and a career-best 51-yarder five
minutes into the final quarter that tied the score, 6-6.
</P>
<P>
Tennessee had a nation-leading, 12-game unbeaten streak halted.
</P>
<P>
No. 17 Florida 59, Akron 0 -- The Gators, coming off a 45-3 loss to Tennessee,
bounced back with an easy victory over outmanned Akron at Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Shane Matthews paced an offense that produced 595 yards, completing
20 of 32 passes for 283 yards and three touchdowns. Willie McClendon rushed for
105 yards and one score.
</P>
<P>
The Gators have a week off and then play No. 5 Auburn on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
Akron (3-4-1) gained only 87 yards against Florida and didn't make a first down
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
The victory before a homecoming crowd of 74,558 at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium
improved Florida's record to 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Akron lost quarterback Jeff Sweitzer to a shoulder separation in the second
quarter and Coach Gerry Faust played reserves most of the second half. "We have
some important games left and we didn't want to get anyone else hurt," Faust
said.
</P>
<P>
Georgia 39, Vanderbilt 28 -- Garrison Hearst rushed for 127 yards and two
touchdowns and Joe Dupree and Andre Hastings connected on a 68-yard touchdown
pass play for the Bulldogs in an SEC game at Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs (4-3, 2-2) also got a 58-yard touchdown run from Larry Ware and
John Kasay kicked field goals of 38 and 48 yards.
</P>
<P>
It was the 21st consecutive SEC road loss for the Commodores (1-5, 1-3), who
had cut Georgia's lead to 33-28 four plays before Dupree, making his first
appearance of the year, connected with Hastings on the long scoring pass.
</P>
<P>
LSU 30, Kentucky 20 -- Harvey Williams rushed for a career-high 213 yards in 28
carries, scored on a 60-yard run, and caught a four-yard touchdown pass to lead
Louisiana State (4-2, 2-2) over the Wildcats (2-5, 1-2) at Baton Rogue, La.
</P>
<P>
Williams had 155 yards by halftime.
</P>
<P>
LSU also got three field goals from Pedro Suarez, and Chad Loup, a redshirt
freshman, passed to Todd Kinchen on a 45-yard touchdown pass play.
</P>
<P>
No. 18 Mississippi 42, Arkansas State 13 -- Randy Baldwin scored four
touchdowns in the first 19 minutes as Ole Miss routed the Division I-AA Indians
at Oxford, Miss.
</P>
<P>
The Rebels (6-1) rolled up 495 yards, one shy of their season high. They also
ensured a second consecutive winning season, the first time Ole Miss has
accomplished that since 1970-71.

<LEADPARA>  Even as coach of a perennial also-ran, Jackie Sherrill still finds a way to
beat Texas.;   With Sherrill pulling the strings from the sideline in
Starkville, Miss., on Saturday, Mississippi State (2-0) rode its big-play

win," said Sherrill, the former Pitt and Texas A&amp;M coach who has returned
after two years out of football. "They weren't afraid of Texas as much as I
was.";   Rodney Stowers capped a fourth-period defensive stand with a sack of
Texas' Peter Gardere, ending a Longhorns drive that had reached the
Mississippi State 19.;   The Bulldogs, who have had only one winning season in
the past decade, have given up only three field goals in winning their first
two games. Mississippi State last held consecutive opponents without a
touchdown in 1978.; CLEMSON 34, APPALACHIAN ST. 0: Tailback Ronald Williams
and the Tigers' defense picked up where they left off last year as the
nation's No. 8-rated team opened its season with a win over the Mountaineers
(1-1) in Clemson, S.C..;   Williams, the 1990 Atlantic Coast Conference rookie
of the year, had been plagued by injuries before Saturday. But he looked
healthy against the Mountaineers, rushing for 108 yards and one touchdown in
14 carries. He gained 183 yards last year in a 48-0 defeat of Appalachian
State.;   The Clemson defense was even more impressive, despite missing three
linemen who were suspended for violating team rules. The Tigers limited
Appalachian State to 18 yards and no first downs en route to a 24-0 halftime
lead.; ALABAMA 41, TEMPLE 3: Quarterback Danny Woodson ran 85 yards on
Alabama's first possession and Chris Anderson scored on a school-record
96-yard run as the 20th-ranked Crimson Tide defeated the Owls in the season
opener for both teams in Birmingham, Ala.;   Running back Siran Stacy, making
a comeback after a knee injury in Alabama's first game of 1990, scored on a
7-yard run and threw a 26-yard scoring pass.;   The game marked the first
meeting of a member of the new Big East Conference, Temple, against a
Southeastern Conference team. Alabama had defeated the Owls in their two
earlier meetings, in 1986 and 1988.; GEORGIA 31, LSU 10: Garrison Hearst
scored two touchdowns and Larry Ware went 38 yards on a screen pass for
another, leading the Bulldogs (2-0, 1-0) over the Tigers (0-1, 0-1) in the
Southeastern Conference opener for both teams.; MARYLAND 17, VIRGINIA 6: Troy

<TEXT>
   The lower Mississippi River region is so poor
that one section is called ``America's Ethiopia,'' and a federal
commission is seeking new ways to help its dying towns and end
generations of dependence on welfare.
   There are counties with more than a quarter of the work force
idled, a lack of capital to attract new jobs, and waste of human
resources, like teen-age mothers with sickly babies and adults who
cannot read or write.
   Unlike a foreign country in need, the region of 214 counties in
seven states covered by the study gets neither enough sympathy from
Washington nor bailouts from international financiers, says Wilbur
Hawkins Jr., executive director of the Lower Mississippi Delta
Development Commission.
   ``It's nice, well and dandy to take care of foreign nations,''
Hawkins said. ``But here we are in America _ we can afford to send
money to Poland, to the Caribbean nations, but not to the Delta.''
   ``There is a lack of care about the Delta's problems, a lot of
unconcern,'' said one commission member, Rep. Ed Jones, D-Tenn. ``I
think the Southern people are concerned, and now it's time for the
nation to be concerned.''
   The commission members represent Arkansas, Illinois, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee and are appointed by
the states' governors. Congress assigned the commission to come up
with a 10-year plan for government and private action to lift the
region out of poverty.
   Geographically, a river's delta is at its mouth; the
Mississippi's is the area below New Orleans where it spills into the
Gulf of Mexico. But Congress, noting common problems of the mostly
agrarian poor counties stretching from southern Illinois to the tip
of Louisiana, grouped the seven states under the common heading of
``Delta'' in creating the commission.
   The region has long relied on agriculture, river commerce and
industries that have suffered because of overseas competition. The
river is lined by rich farmland and dotted by small waterfront
towns, like Helena, and a few population centers, like Memphis,
Tenn., which have some prosperity.
   Of the 11 million people in the region, 40 percent fall below
federal poverty guidelines, according to Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.
   More than half the residents of northwestern Mississippi's Tunica
County, which earned the ``America's Ethiopia'' nickname, live below
the poverty level.
   Across the Mississippi at Lee County, Ark., the per capita income
is $6,542. The hospital was closed for lack of money.
   At Lakeview, Ark., south of Helena, rampant teen-age pregnancy
prompted distribution of contraceptives at the school health clinic
_ but the program was curtailed for lack of funds.
   One stumbling block to national action is a lack of awareness
about the Delta, Hawkins said. During a recent meeting in
Washington, Hawkins said he asked why more federal contracts go to
Puerto Rico than Mississippi.
   ``Puerto Rico is just as American as Mississippi,'' Hawkins
quoted an official as responding, ``Then in his next breath, he
said, `What can you make? What can you do?'''
   The swampy land lining the Big Muddy was drained and pioneered by
plantation owners over the last century. Rich in deep topsoil and
natural resources, poor in capital, the Delta counts agriculture as
its dominant industry.
   But wealth never trickled down from the landowners; residents,
many of them sharecroppers, stayed poor and got poorer with the
changing fortunes of farming, which has a reverberating effect in
the little-diversified economy.
   The commission's preliminary proposal for a 10-year improvement
plan, to be presented to Congress in October, was compiled during
the past six months. It runs more than 70 pages and is packed with
new statistical data, Hawkins says. The congressional mandate calls
for a final report in May 1990.
   Hawkins also says the mandate bars any release of details until
Congress gets the report.
   But long-time Delta residents say the region's problems can be
boiled down to one word: money. Money to attract jobs, train workers
and battle conditions that smother hope and erode families.
   Hawkins recently scouted Phillips County for a site for the
commission's late-summer meeting in Arkansas. At Elaine, as he
walked down a gravel road toward time-worn houses, he was surrounded
by curious youngsters.
   ``What are y'all doing this summer?'' Hawkins asked.
   ``Nothing,'' replied 12-year-old James Ellis.
   Hawkins hoisted another child, 2-year-old Bryant Hart, into his
arms.
   ``We want to make his tomorrow better. That is what this is
about,'' he said. ``You ask what this boy's life is going to be like
_ this is the future generation. His future depends on the success
of what we do.''

Terrell Buckley scored on a 53-yard interception return and Errol McCorvey went
77 yards with a recovered fumble to help Florida State defeat Virginia Tech,
39-28, Saturday at Tallahassee, Fla., and increase the nation's longest winning
streak to 14 games.
</P>
<P>
Florida State (4-0) didn't get the lead for good until Buckley's touchdown run
in the final minute of the third quarter made it 32-28.
</P>
<P>
McCorvey's touchdown with 3:59 left in the game completed the scoring, giving
Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden an opportunity to pick up his 200th career
coaching victory next Saturday against rival Miami.
</P>
<P>
Virginia Tech (2-3) led 21-3 early and 28-25 with 2:51 left in the third period
after a four-yard pass from Will Furrer to Vaughn Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Furrer, who completed 21 of 37 passes for 194 yards, also threw two first-half
touchdown passes to John Rivers on plays covering four and two yards.
</P>
<P>
Buckley stopped Tech's final drive with two minutes remaining with his second
interception of the game. Buckley, who has four interceptions this season,
returned his second theft 41 yards from his own end zone.
</P>
<P>
Florida State intercepted four passes by Furrer and one by backup Rodd Wooten.

No. 19 Clemson 26, Duke 7 -- The 19th-ranked Tigers, stung last season by their
first loss to Duke in nearly a decade, beat the Blue Devils in an Atlantic
Coast Conference game at Clemson, S.C.
</P>
<P>
"Duke spoiled things for us last year," linebacker John Johnson said. "We
wanted to let them know it wouldn't happen again, starting from the first
kickoff."
</P>
<P>
Duke, 1-3 overall and 0-2 in the ACC, trailed Clemson (4-1, 2-1) only 10-0
after the first half, but pulled away in the third quarter before 81,500 at
Death Valley.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Duke rallied from a 14-0 halftime deficit to beat Clemson, 21-17,
for the first time since 1980.
</P>
<P>
The Tigers drove 75 yards in 10 plays -- the key play a 30-yard run by Rudy
Harris -- on its first possession of the second half to go up 17-0. DeChane
Cameron, who also threw for two touchdowns, capped the march with a two-yard
run.
</P>
<P>
The Blue Devils' only score was a 78-yard kickoff return touchdown by Leroy
Gallman with 1:28 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech 27, No. 25 South Carolina 6 -- Quarterback Shawn Jones ran for the
Yellow Jackets' first touchdown and his passes set up two other scores at
Atlanta .
</P>
<P>
Jones scored on a bootleg from a yard out in the second quarter, Stefen Scotton
plunged two yards for another score and Jeff Wright scored from 20 yards out
for Tech (3-0), which also got field goals of 42 and 20 yards from Scott
Sisson.
</P>
<P>
Jones completed 11 of 20 passes for 136 yards, with two interceptions, before
being shaken up and taken out of the game midway through the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
South Carolina quarterback Bobby Fuller completed 14 of 28 passes for 143
yards, but he was intercepted three times and sacked five times by a Tech
defense led by Ken Swilling and Marco Coleman. Coleman sacked Fuller once and
twice hit him as he released the ball during a fourth-quarter drive.
</P>
<P>
The Gamecocks fell to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State 12, North Carolina 9 -- Damon Hartman kicked a 56-yard
field goal as time expired and turned the Wolfpack's afternoon of frustration
into a victory over the Tar Heels in a battle of field goals at Chapel Hill,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
Hartman's field goal, a line drive, completely silenced a partisan North
Carolina crowd which had earlier booed the decision to go for the tie when the
Tar Heels were at the North Carolina State five.
</P>
<P>
Hartman broke his own school record of 54 yards, set against North Carolina in
1988.
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State is now 3-2 and 2-2; North Carolina 3-2 and 0-1.
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Virginia 63, William &amp; Mary 35 -- Terry Kirby and Nikki Fisher paced
a 398-yard ground attack and the No. 7 Cavaliers used a third-quarter surge to
pull away to a victory over the pesky Indians at Charlottesville, Va.
</P>
<P>
Virginia, off to a 5-0 start for the first time since 1949, scored 22 points in
the opening 5:01 of the second half to build a 49-21 advantage.
</P>
<P>
Kirby ran 23 times for 188 yards and four touchdowns, and fellow tailback
Fisher had 164 yards and two scoring runs in 14 carries.
</P>
<P>
Virginia's Shawn Moore completed 15 of 26 passes for 291 yards and two
touchdowns, but he hit only seven of 16 in the first half, frequently
overthrowing open receivers.
</P>
<P>
William &amp; Mary (2-2), which beat the Cavaliers in 1987 and played them
tough in losses the last two seasons, trailed only 27-21 at halftime. The
Indians are ranked No. 20 in Division I-AA.
</P>
<P>
Southern Mississippi 25, Louisville 13 -- Tony Smith returned a punt 46 yards
for a touchdown to open a 22-point first-quarter blitz that helped the Golden
Eagles (3-2) win at Hattiesburg, Miss. Louisville is now 3-1-1.
</P>
<P>
Wake Forest 52, Army 14 -- Anthony Williams rushed for 136 yards and two
touchdowns and the Demon Deacons (2-2) capitalized on four Cadet turnovers for
24 points and breezed at Winston-Salem, N.C. Army is now 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Memphis State 22, Tulsa 10 -- Freshman Joe Allison kicked three field goals,
including a 49-yarder into a stiff breeze, and quarterback Keith Benton scored
on a five-yard run in the fourth quarter to lead the Tigers (2-1-1) at Tulsa,
Okla.

Jim Taylor, a hero a week ago, missed 42-yard field-goal attempt with 54
seconds remaining as Southern Mississippi failed in its bid for a second
consecutive upset Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Taylor's attempt hit the right upright and bounced away, taking with it a
chance at upsetting Georgia.
</P>
<P>
With the Bulldogs' Larry Ware scoring two second-half touchdowns, Georgia (1-1)
beat the Golden Eagles, 18-17.
</P>
<P>
The victory ended a four-game Georgia losing streak, dating to last season.
Southern Mississippi dropped to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Southern Mississippi upset Alabama, 27-24, on a 52-yard field goal
by Taylor.
</P>
<P>
Saturday, the Golden Eagles built a 17-6 lead before Ware, a junior, scored on
a 20-yard run to finish a 68-yard drive in the third quarter. He followed that
with a five-yard run with 6:04 left in the game, giving the Bulldogs the 18-17
lead.
</P>
<P>
Georgia missed two-point conversion passes, but got two 38-yard field goals
from John Kasay.
</P>
<P>
Brett Favre gave Southern Mississippi a 10-3 lead midway through the second
quarter when he hit Dwayne Nelson on a nine-yard pass after Terryl Ulmer had
recovered Andre Hastings' fumble on a kickoff at the Georgia 11.
</P>
<P>
With the score 10-6, Favre and Michael Jackson hooked up on a 68-yard touchdown
pass play to make it 17-10.

<LEADPARA>  Clemson and its quarterback, DeChane Cameron, tuned up for a Citrus Bowl date
with Cal by defeating South Carolina 41-24 Saturday in Columbia, S.C.;
Cameron completed 12 of 14 passes for 206 yards and rushed for 116 yards for
the 14th-ranked Tigers (8-1-1). His 322 yards total offense was the third
highest in school history.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "By far this is the best performance of my career," Cameron said. "I just
can't ask for anything more than a day like I had today. Everything was going
right.";   Cameron's 85.7 completion percentage broke the school record
(minimum 10 attempts) of 81.8 percent set by Bobby Gage in 1947 and tied by
Mike O'Cain in 1975.;   The Tigers, who led 17-10 at halftime, broke the game
open with 17 points in the third quarter.;   South Carolina (3-6-2), which
suffered its first losing season since 1986, gained 15 yards rushing in 19
carries.;   Clemson will finish the regular season next Saturday with a game
against Duke in Tokyo.; TENNESSEE 16, KENTUCKY 7: James Stewart rushed for 149
yards and a touchdown to help the 10th-ranked Volunteers (8-2, 4-2) beat the
Wildcats (3-8, 0-7) in a Southeastern Conference game in Lexington, Ky.;
John Becksvoort kicked a 22-yard field goal in the first quarter and connected
from 35 and 28 yards in the second period in giving Tennessee a 9-0 advantage
at the half in windy conditions.;   Stewart scored on an 8-yard run off right
tackle that gave Tennessee a 16-0 lead with 9 minutes, 47 seconds left in the
third quarter. Stewart carried six times for 44 yards in the 10-play, 65-yard
drive.;   The loss capped Kentucky's worst season since going 0-10-1 in 1982.;
VIRGINIA 38, VIRGINIA TECH 0: Matt Blundin capped his record-setting,
interception-free season by throwing for three touchdowns as the 20th-ranked
Cavaliers (8-2-1) beat the Hokies (5-6) in Charlottesville, Va.;   Blundin, a
6-foot-7, 232-pound senior, broke an NCAA mark by extending to 231 his streak
of consecutive passes without an interception. Jack Trudeau of Illinois had
215 in a row in 1985.;   "I'd call four or five interceptions a pretty good
year. I just wanted to keep them to a minimum, but I obviously never expected
anything like this," Blundin said. "It's just a great feeling."; NORTH
CAROLINA STATE 20, MARYLAND 17: Anthony Barbour rushed for a career-high 171
yards and Damon Hartman kicked the game-winning field goal with just over
seven minutes left as the 22nd-ranked Wolfpack (9-2, 5-2) downed the Terrapins
(2-9, 2-5) in an Atlantic Coast Conference game in Raleigh, N.C.;   North
Carolina State won nine regular-season games for only the third time in 100
years. The Wolfpack also accomplished the feat in 1927 and 1974.; MISSISSIPPI
STATE 24, MISSISSIPPI 9: Sleepy Robinson ran for a touchdown and passed for
another as the Bulldogs (7-4, 4-3) dominated Ole Miss (5-6, 1-6) in an SEC
game in Starkville, Miss.; NORTH CAROLINA 47, DUKE 14: Natrone Means rushed
for 181 yards in 30 carries to help the Tar Heels (7-4, 3-4) to an ACC victory
over the Blue Devils (4-5-1, 1-5) in Chapel Hill, N.C.; LOUISIANA ST. 39,
TULANE 20: Odell Beckham ran for 140 yards and two touchdowns as the Tigers

<LEADPARA>  Clemson shelved its orange uniforms Saturday and adopted a color it abandoned
in 1939.;   Northwest purple, to be exact, a flashy shade that came with

<TEXT>     No. 12 North Carolina State prepared for an orange-clad team so boring that
Coach Ken Hatfield pleaded last week with his fans to discontinue booing the
19th-ranked Tigers. That Clemson team never arrived, and the Wolfpack never
had a chance.;   An explosive first half that began with a Clemson reverse and
ended with a Clemson lead of 23-7 paved the way for a 29-19 victory over North
Carolina State (6-1, 3-1) in Clemson, S.C. A sellout crowd of 81,500 roared --
and never booed -- as the Tigers (4-1-1, 2-0-1) took control of the Atlantic
Coast Conference race.;   Clemson overcame the nation's fourth-ranked defense
and the pregame loss of starting tailback Ronald Williams with equal ease.
Williams, the nation's No. 10 rusher (116.2 yards per game), sprained his
right knee in warmups and is expected to undergo arthroscopic surgery today.;
 Senior quarterback DeChane Cameron rushed for 79 yards and a touchdown and
threw for 143 more to lead the new-look Tigers. Freshman kicker Nelson Welch
set a school record with five field goals.;   Hatfield said he resurrected the
purple because it's a part of Clemson history and it's different.; EAST
CAROLINA 24, PITT 23: Jeff Blake scored on a 2-yard run, then ran for the
conversion with 46 seconds left, lifting the 20th-ranked Pirates (6-1) over
the No. 23 Panthers (5-3) in Greenville, N.C.;   After East Carolina moved
ahead, the Panthers drove to the Pirates' 30 with seven seconds left. Instead
of trying a field goal, Pitt's Alex Van Pelt completed a 19-yard pass to Chad
Askew to the 11, but time ran out.; GEORGIA 49, KENTUCKY 27: Freshman Eric
Zeier passed for 302 yards and two touchdowns as the 24th-ranked Bulldogs
(6-2, 3-2) beat the Wildcats (2-5, 0-4) in an SEC game in Athens, Ga.; OTHER
GAMES: Jeff Owen kicked a 42-yard field goal with 22 seconds left as
Vanderbilt (3-5, 2-3) broke a 19-game SEC road losing streak with a 30-27 win
over Mississippi (5-3, 1-3) in Oxford, Miss. . . . Kenny Roberts, on his only
carry of the day, ran 61 yards for a touchdown with 1 minute, 49 seconds
remaining as Mississippi State (5-3, 2-2) won 24-17 over Auburn (4-3, 2-2) in
an SEC game in Auburn, Ala. . . . Shawn Jones became Georgia Tech's career
passing leader, throwing for 273 yards to lead the Yellow Jackets (4-4, 3-2)
to a 35-14 ACC victory over North Carolina (4-3, 1-3) in Atlanta. . . . Dave
Brown threw for 334 yards, leading Duke (4-1-1, 1-1) to a 17-13 ACC victory
over Maryland (2-5, 2-2) in College Park, Md. . . . Matt Blundin threw for 275
yards and two touchdowns as Virginia (5-2-1, 3-2-1) rolled to a 48-7 ACC
victory over Wake Forest (1-6, 0-4) in Charlottesville, Va.  </TEXT>

IN QUOTES
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati Coach Tim Murphy, after his team lost to Florida State, 70-21: "We
had our best day offensively since I've been here."
</P>
<P>
 Louisville's John Gainey, whose interception preserved a 17-10 victory over
Boston College: "We got into a huddle and said, 'No Hail Mary passes.' I was
going to either knock it down or take it. I took it."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
STREAKS
</P>
<P>
Brigham Young's Ty Detmer, who passed for 484 yards against Wyoming, has 21
consecutive games of at least 300 passing yards. . . . Virginia's Herman Moore,
playing despite two sprained big toes in a 24-10 victory over North Carolina,
caught a touchdown pass for the ninth consecutive game, an NCAA record. He tied
another record by catching a scoring pass in his 10th consecutive
regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
Illinois has lost five games in a row to Michigan and hasn't won at Ann Arbor
since 1966. . . . Georgia Tech extended its home-field winning streak to 12
games. The Yellow Jackets are unbeaten in their last 13. . . . Penn State won
its seventh game in a row, 24-10 over Maryland. The Terrapins have lost 32 of
34 games to the Nittany Lions and have lost 20 in a row at Beaver Stadium. . .
. Wisconsin tied a school record with its 11th consecutive Big Ten loss, 20-7
to Indiana.
</P>
<P>
Arkansas' 0-6 conference record is their worst since 1942. . . . Vanderbilt's
28-21 loss to Kentucky was the Commodores' 22nd consecutive Southeastern
Conference loss on the road. . . . Nebraska's 41-9 victory over Kansas was the
Cornhuskers' 22nd in a row over the Jayhawks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
Rod Smith's interception on the goal line with 46 seconds left ensured No. 1
Notre Dame's 34-29 victory over No. 9 Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
Florida's defense, ranked first in the Southeastern Conference and second
nationally, forced three turnovers in a 38-7 victory over Georgia. Tim Paulk's
fumble recovery set up one touchdown, Paulk's 36-yard interception return for a
touchdown gave the Gators a 14-0 lead 31 seconds later, and Richard Fain's
interception led to another touchdown for a 24-7 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State sacked Duke quarterbacks seven times and intercepted five
passes in a 16-0 victory. Duke scored 57 points last week against Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
Alabama's defense held Louisiana State to a field goal and has gone four
consecutive games without giving up a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
After falling behind, 27-0, in the third quarter, Utah stymied New Mexico,
intercepting three passes and recovering two fumbles on the way to a 29-27
victory.

<P>
Texas Tech intercepted five passes, and Ronald Ferguson returned one 75 yards
for a touchdown, in a 40-28 victory over Texas Christian.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
FIGHTING WORDS
</P>
<P>
The Iowa State-Missouri and Temple-Pittsburgh games were both interrupted by
brawls. One fight started after Iowa State's Shawn Walker intercepted a pass
late in the third quarter. Missouri players ran across the field to join in
action. One player from each team was ejected -- Iowa State's Malcolm Goodwin
and Missouri's David Frisch. At Pittsburgh, Temple was apparently inspired by a
fight in the first quarter. With Pitt leading, 6-0, the game was halted by a
10-minute fight along the Temple sidelines after the Owls' Tony Schmitz
intercepted a pass. Several Temple staff members, including Coach Jerry Berndt,
suffered bumps and bruises. Temple defensive lineman Alfonso Taylor was
ejected.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
SOMEONE HAD TO WIN
</P>
<P>
They didn't do much of anything right at Cheney, Pa., in game between Morgan
State and Cheney. Playing in rain on a sloppy field, the teams combined for 20
fumbles; Morgan State lost all four of its fumbles and Cheney lost half of its
16. Fittingly, Morgan State won, 2-0, on James Dozier's block of Mark Williams'
punt in the fourth quarter. No one recovered the ball, Morgan State getting the
safety when it went out of the end zone. The loss was Cheney's 14th in a row.
Morgan State is 1-10.

<LEADPARA>  Fifth-ranked Penn State won, and Coach Joe Paterno was embarrassed.;   "Nobody

<TEXT>     Tony Sacca threw for two touchdowns and four players scored two apiece as
the Nittany Lions scored their most points since Paterno became the coach in
1966.;   Sacca threw to Kyle Brady for two scores, freshman J.T. Morris had
two TD runs of more than 50 yards, and Sam Gash and Shelly Hammonds also ran
for two each.;   "We played so many kids early and really got them tired,"
said Paterno, who tried in vain to keep the score down by playing almost every
player he had.;   Cincinnati Coach Tim Murphy made a point to absolve Paterno
of any design on running up the score.;   "I think Joe's a class guy, and I
don't believe he'd do that in a hundred years," Murphy said.;   Penn State
(2-0) ran for 484 yards and passed for 222. It held the Bearcats (0-1) to 229
overall.; MICHIGAN 35, BOSTON COLLEGE 13: Desmond Howard caught three scoring
passes and returned the second-half kickoff 93 yards for another touchdown as
the second-ranked Wolverines (1-0) broke open a tight game against the Eagles
(0-2) in Newton, Mass.;   The Wolverines led only 14-13 before scoring three
touchdowns in the final eight minutes. Until then, the Eagles had stayed with
highly favored Michigan even after Howard's scoring return made the score
14-10.;   Sean Wright's second field goal, a 22-yarder 53 seconds into the
fourth quarter, cut the lead to a point. Then Michigan marched 70 yards in
nine plays, capped by Elvis Grbac's 8-yard pass to Howard on a slant into the
end zone with 7:54 left.; SYRACUSE 37, VANDERBILT 10: Tight end Chris Gedney
caught a 34-yard touchdown pass and defensive back Tony Montemorra returned a
fumble for a score as the No. 24 Orangemen (1-0) broke open a close game with
a six-minute scoring burst against the Commodores (0-1) in Syracuse, N.Y.;
The Orangemen, who gave new coach Paul Pasqualoni his first victory, scored 34
straight points after falling behind 10-3 late in the second quarter.;
PITTSBURGH 35, SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI 14: The Panthers (2-0) raced to a 22-point
first-half lead on Steve Israel's 81-yard interception return for a touchdown
and two scoring catches by Chris Bouyer, then withstood a third-period rally
by the Golden Eagles (1-1) in Pittsburgh.;   Freshman Curtis Martin scored on
a 10-yard run with 10:51 to play to push Pitt back into a two-touchdown lead
after Tommy Waters's two touchdown passes in a nine-minute span rallied
Southern Miss to within 22-14.; BALL STATE 33, NAVY 10: Corey Croom rushed for
190 yards and scored three touchdowns and the Cardinals (1-1) forced four

TITANS FIGURE THEY HAVE A CHANCE TODAY

<P>
Another week, another Southeastern Conference voyage, another dollar for the
Cal State Fullerton football team, which plays today at Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
Until last week, one might have figured this was just another lucrative loss
for CSUF (Cal State Under-Funded). The needy Titans will collect $150,000 to
play the Bulldogs.
</P>
<P>
But that was before Fullerton's strong second-half showing in a 38-17 loss to
Auburn last week, a performance that made the Titans believe they can come
here, take the money and win, not run.
</P>
<P>
"We're still definite underdogs," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. "But if we
play like we did in the second half against Auburn, we're capable of staying in
the game. We could beat them, but it would take a great effort by us, and some
great things would have to go our way."
</P>
<P>
It's amazing what outscoring Auburn, 14-7, in the second half will do for your
outlook on life.
</P>
<P>
There was virtually no talk of defeating the third-ranked Tigers last week. The
Titans' objectives were to be as competitive as possible and not be embarrassed
on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
Mission partially accomplished. The Tigers blew the Titans away in a 31-3 first
half, but Fullerton held its own in the second for a more-than-respectable
final score.
</P>
<P>
Many would have considered Mississippi State to be another heavy favorite
today, but the Titans' play against Auburn has changed Fullerton's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
The Titans figure if they can stick with Auburn, the SEC favorite, for a half,
why shouldn't they stick for two halves with Mississippi State, a lower-echelon
SEC team that lost to Tennessee, 40-7, last Saturday?
</P>
<P>
"We have a different confidence level this week -- we feel we can win,"
Fullerton running back Reggie Yarbrough said. "They're coming off a big loss
and are probably feeling low. We're at the point where if we put things
together, we can beat a lot of teams."
</P>
<P>
Murphy said if last Saturday's second half was an indication of how hard the
Titans can play, they'll do fine today. Problem is, Murphy doesn't know how his
inexperienced team will respond.
</P>
<P>
The Titans struggled to beat Division II Sonoma State, 38-24, in the season
opener and actually looked better in the second half against Auburn than they
did the entire game against Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know this football team at all," Murphy said. "We didn't play with a
lot of emotion against Sonoma State, but we did against Auburn. The toughest
thing to do is emotionally arouse your team to perform at its highest level of
ability every week. So anything that would happen today would not surprise me."
</P>
<P>
One thing working for the Titans is their offensive style, which is foreign to
most SEC teams.
</P>
<P>
SEC teams are used to power offenses -- most would rather line up and stuff the
ball down your throat than pass. Games are usually won in the trenches.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the SEC's "smash-mouth" style, Fullerton's offense wags its tongue
at defenses, pecking away with quick short-yardage passes and spreading the
field by sending out four or five receivers.
</P>
<P>
There are even times when Fullerton uses a no-back set -- disdainful to SEC
fans but often effective for the Titans. Some Auburn players admitted it was
difficult adjusting to Fullerton's offense, and Murphy hopes the Bulldogs have
similar problems today.
</P>
<P>
"You can't smash-mouth when your only running back is your quarterback," Murphy
said. "If you're not used to seeing a spread offense all over the field, you're
bound to make mistakes. It would be like us facing a wishbone team. It would
take longer for us to prepare, because we don't see that in our conference."
</P>
<P>
Fullerton also doesn't see the kinds of athletes SEC teams face on a weekly
basis. Mississippi State might not be the class of the SEC, but the Bulldogs
are in a class above the Titans when it comes to speed, size and strength.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes (our finesse) negates a mismatch in athletic ability," Murphy said.
"But for the most part, speed kills and athletic ability catches up to you."
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes
</P>
<P>
A connecting flight that was supposed to have taken the Titans from Nashville
to Jackson, Miss., was diverted from Detroit to Grand Rapids, Mich., because of
thunderstorms Friday, and that left the Titans stranded in the Nashville
airport for about six hours. When the team finally boarded another plane,
departure was delayed for another half hour because of thunderstorms. The team
missed a scheduled practice Friday evening and didn't arrive at its Columbus,
Miss., hotel until 11:45 p.m. (CDT). . . . Freshman kickoff returner Dwayne
McAfee missed the bus from Fullerton to LAX Friday morning and did not make the
trip to Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
Mississippi State Coach Rockey Felker said any thoughts his players entertained
of this being an easy victory dissipated when they watched films of the
Auburn-Fullerton game. "It certainly made our players realize that Fullerton is
a good team, even though we don't know much about them," Felker said. "They
battled Auburn, played very aggressively, and they gave them problems
offensively and defensively. . . . Fullerton has its share of problems, too.
Considered one of its strengths in the preseason, the Titans' defensive
secondary is hurting. Free safety Terry Tramble, an All-Big West Conference
pick in 1989, is out for the season with a broken forearm and cornerback Nuygen
Pendleton has been slowed by a sprained ankle. Auburn took full advantage of
the soft spots, passing for 339 yards and four touchdowns last week. . . .
Offensive lineman John Cotti and Tim Drevno are also questionable for today's
game with injuries. . . . One of Mississippi State's best defensive players is
nose guard Demetrius Hill, a cousin of former Fullerton defensive lineman Jerry
Leggett, who was recently cut by the Los Angeles Rams. Leggett, a Titan in
1988, played three seasons at Mississippi State before transferring to
Fullerton. . . . The Bulldogs have a dangerous return man in Tony James, who
had 82 yards on two kickoff returns last week and a 71-yard punt return for a
touchdown.

Jesse Anderson didn't expect to play such a big role in the Blue-Gray All-Star
football game.
</P>
<P>
"I thought I would maybe catch two of three passes," said Anderson, a tight end
at Mississippi State who caught nine passes for 93 yards and a touchdown Monday
and was named the Gray's most valuable player in a 28-10 victory over the Blue.
</P>
<P>
"It means a whole lot to me," he said of the award. "I thought we would run a
lot, but we mixed it up and it helped me out."
</P>
<P>
The Gray did have a balanced attack -- throwing 39 times and running 36 -- but
did most of its damage through the air behind Neil O'Donnell of Maryland and
John Gromos of Vanderbilt. They combined to complete 24 of 39 passes for 330
yards, while the Gray rushed for only 99 yards.
</P>
<P>
Ricky Proehl of Wake Forest caught a 48-yard touchdown pass and set up another
score with a 65-yard reception as the Gray rallied from a 10-0 deficit with two
touchdowns in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Anderson ran the lead to 21-10 on a 12-yard touchdown reception with 6:20 to go
in the third quarter. O'Donnell, who threw for 167 yards in an 11-for-20
performance, set up Anderson's touchdown with the 65-yard pass to Proehl, who
got loose down the right sideline and sprinted to the Blue 15.
</P>
<P>
Proehl sealed the victory with a juggling reception as he fell into the end
zone with 2:51 remaining.
</P>
<P>
"I kind of had to wait for the ball to come down because the quarterback had
some pressure," Proehl said. "It hit me in the shoulder pads and bounced a few
times before I finally was able to bring it down."
</P>
<P>
The most valuable player from the Blue team was Oregon's Latin Berry, who led
all rushers with 35 yards on seven carries. He also caught three passes for 14
yards.

Chris Gardocki kicked three field goals as Clemson upset No. 12 North Carolina
State, 30-10, Saturday at Clemson, S.C., keeping alive its hopes of winning an
unprecedented fourth consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference title.
</P>
<P>
The Tigers, 6-2 overall and 3-2 in the conference, defeated the Wolfpack for
the first time since 1985. N.C. State is 6-1 and 4-1, falling into a
first-place tie with Virginia, which defeated Wake Forest, 47-28, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Clemson, which had lost its last two ACC games, grabbed a 17-0 halftime lead,
holding N.C. State to a season-low 99 yards total offense.
</P>
<P>
After the teams traded field goals in the third period, N.C. State cut the lead
to 20-10 with 41 seconds left in the quarter on a five-yard run by Todd Varn.
Shane Montgomery keyed the 77-yard, 12-play drive, hitting seven of nine passes
for 69 yards.
</P>
<P>
N.C. State drove to the Clemson 38-yard line on its next possession, but ACC
interception leader Robert O'Neal picked off a pass from Montgomery to end the
threat. It was the freshman's fifth interception.
</P>
<P>
N.C. State turned the ball over again on its next possession. Linebacker Wayne
Simmons stripped split end Chris Corders of the ball and then recovered the
fumble at the N.C. State 12 to set up a 23-yard field goal by Gardocki with
7:15 left.
</P>
<P>
Duke 46, Maryland 25 -- The Blue Devils beat the Terrapins for the first time
since 1972 when quarterback Billy Ray threw for three touchdowns and ran for
another in an ACC game at College Park, Md.
</P>
<P>
Clarkston Hines, Dave Colonna and Mark Hayes each caught touchdown passes,
Randy Cuthbert ran for a touchdown and Wyatt Smith returned an interception for
a touchdown as the Blue Devils snapped a 15-game losing streak to the
Terrapins.
</P>
<P>
The victory, which raised Duke's record to 4-3 overall and 2-1 in the
conference, was the Blue Devils' first at Maryland's Byrd Stadium since 1960.
</P>
<P>
The Terrapins fell to 2-6 and 1-4.
</P>
<P>
Hines scored on a 19-yard pass to the left corner of the end zone from Ray 5:52
into the first quarter for his ninth touchdown of the season, giving Duke a 7-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
The touchdown gives Hines 30 in his career, four shy of the National Collegiate
Athletic Assn. record of 34 set by Elmo Wright from 1968-70.
</P>
<P>
Hines' seven catches gave him 166 career receptions, breaking the ACC record of
164 set by Wes Chesson of Duke.
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech 17, North Carolina 14 -- Quarterback Shawn Jones ran 30 yards for
a touchdown with 51 seconds remaining give the Yellow Jackets the victory at
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
North Carolina's Clint Gwaltney attempted a 52-yard field goal as time ran, but
it fell short.
</P>
<P>
The victory extended Georgia Tech's ACC winning streak to three after the
Yellow Jackets had dropped 16 league games in a row.
</P>
<P>
Jones, a redshirt freshman who also scored on a five-yard broken play in the
second period, guided the Yellow Jackets on a 60-yard, eight-play drive in the
final two minutes to lift Georgia Tech (3-3 and 3-2).
</P>
<P>
North Carolina (1-6 and 0-4), lost its sixth consecutive game and eighth in a
row in the ACC.
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech's Jerry Mays, the ACC's leading rusher, ran for 169 yards in 27
carries, but the Yellow Jackets had to overcome four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
East Carolina 14, Virginia Tech 10 -- Travis Hunter ran for one touchdown and
passed for a tie-breaking touchdown in the second quarter as the Pirates held
off two fourth-quarter threats by the Hokies for the victory at Greenville,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
A fumbled punt recovered by East Carolina with 4:16 left helped preserve the
victory. East Carolina is 4-1-1.
</P>
<P>
The Hokies (3-3-1) had two chances to score within a three-minute span. A
50-yard run on a broken play by Vaughan Hebron to the East Carolina 25 led
Virginia Tech down to the Pirate eight-yard line. But Hebron was stopped on
fourth and one at the East Carolina five with 12:53 left.
</P>
<P>
South Carolina 24, West Carolina 3 -- Harold Green ran for 150 yards and a
touchdown and Mike Dingle scored twice as the 24th-ranked Gamecocks won at
Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
Dingle, who had 63 yards rushing, gave the Gamecocks (5-1-1) a 7-0 lead late in
the second quarter. The Catamounts dropped to 3-3-1.
</P>
<P>
Virginia 47, Wake Forest 28 -- Shawn Moore, who entered the game as the NCAA's
Division I-A passing efficiency leader, threw three touchdown passes and ran
for a fourth as the Cavaliers won the ACC game at Charlottesville, Va.
</P>
<P>
Moore completed 15 of 30 passes for 280 yards as Virginia, 6-2 overall and 4-1
in the ACC, beat the Demon Deacons for the sixth consecutive time. Moore, a
redshirt junior, also had two passes intercepted, both on deflected passes, and
ran for 77 yards in 12 carries.
</P>
<P>
Wake Forest is 1-5-1 and 1-3-0.
</P>
<P>
Jake McInerney tied a Virginia record with four field goals.
</P>
<P>
Southwestern Louisiana 24, Southern Mississippi 21 -- Mike Lemoine kicked a
50-yard field goal with two seconds left to give the Ragin Cajuns the victory
at Hattiesburg, Miss.

KIMBLE TOPS 50 POINTS 3 TIMES
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Kimble's scoring assault during Hank Gathers' absence is taking on epic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
Kimble goes into Saturday's Oklahoma game with three straight performances of
more than 50 points (his 57 against Athletes in Action isn't officially
recognized as part of the schedule), raising memories of the late 1960s when
the likes of Pete Maravich, Calvin Murphy, Rick Mount and Elvin Hayes made
nightly raids on the record books.
</P>
<P>
Maravich, who set most NCAA scoring records for Louisiana State, scored 50 or
more 10 times, including three in succession as a junior -- 66 against Tulane,
50 against Florida and 54 against Auburn.
</P>
<P>
Murphy, a scoring whiz at Niagara, scored 50 points six times, including a
one-week span as a junior when he got 50 against St. Peter's, Buffalo and
Syracuse. Notre Dame scoring star Austin Carr managed back-to-back 50-point
games three times, including 61 against Ohio and 52 against Kentucky in the
1970 NCAA Tournament. Mississippi's Johnny Neumann hit 53 against Vanderbilt
and 60 against Baylor in successive games in 1970. Mount of Purdue, Hayes of
Houston, Bill Bradley of Princeton and Rick Barry of Miami are among the
all-time collegiate scoring stars who never managed back-to-back 50-pointers.
</P>
<P>
Kimble, with 51 against UC Santa Barbara and 53 against Oregon State, has
raised his season average to 34.4, which tops the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
What is unusual about Kimble's increased production is that he has shot fewer
three-pointers and is working inside with Gathers out. Basically, he's scoring
for two.
</P>
<P>
"I and my teammates try to make ourselves versatile so that we can play other
positions," Kimble said. "I'm trying to show my leadership. I wanted to take
the ball inside to replace Hank. I figure if I can take the ball to the basket
I have a higher percentage (of making the shot)."
</P>
<P>
In his recent spree, Kimble has hit 35 of 51 shots, 22 of 23 free throws and
six of seven three-pointers.
</P>
<P>
Even his teammates were amazed at how tough the 6-foot-5 Kimble has been on the
boards in Gathers' absence. He had 12 rebounds against Oregon State and 16 in
the exhibition against Athletes in Action.
</P>
<P>
"He's a great outside shooter," Lions Coach Paul Westhead said, "but he may be
even better inside."
</P>
<P>
Earl Martin's demeanor usually reflects his nickname -- Sleepy -- but the
fifth-year senior out of Carson has caught much of the Pacific-10 Conference
napping.
</P>
<P>
The forward for the Oregon State basketball team has played most of his career
in the shadow of stars like All-American guard Gary Payton but is quietly
moving up through the Beavers' record book in many categories.
</P>
<P>
Against Loyola on Tuesday, the 6-foot-5 Martin had a quiet 16 points, hitting
seven of 11 shots, to raise his season average to 12.9. That put him within 57
points of becoming the 23rd player in Oregon State's 1,000-point club. Martin
is 312 points from breaking into the Beavers' career top 10 scorers. If he
does, it won't get much mention because Payton -- who scored 48 points Tuesday
-- will be breaking most school career records.
</P>
<P>
Martin, who played only five games as a freshman due to injury and was awarded
another year's eligibility, cracked Coach Ralph Miller's starting lineup the
next season and has averaged 8.8 points on 50.4% shooting since. This season he
has added the three-pointer to his arsenal. After making only four of 21
three-point shots in the previous three seasons, Martin has hit 14 of 25 (56%)
this season, helping explain his increased scoring.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, everything up here is Payton, but I think I've helped the team a
lot and I'm looking forward to doing more," Martin said. "I checked where I was
this summer (in career standings) and figured I could get in the top 10."
</P>
<P>
Martin worked on his three-pointer this summer. He said the coaching changeover
from Ralph Miller to longtime assistant Jim Anderson has given the players more
individual leeway.
</P>
<P>
That game plan didn't include losing to Loyola at Corvallis. "That was a fun
game to play, but it didn't turn out the way we wanted," Martin said. "We try
not to lose any games at home. Our goal is always to be undefeated here, so it
was a letdown."
</P>
<P>
Martin has long been like a familiar character actor whose name nobody quite
remembers, even at Carson High where he signed an early letter of intent with
Oregon State then saw teammate Earl Foreman outshine him. But without doing the
spectacular, Martin has always been a steady.
</P>
<P>
Martin's nickname refers to the smallish Beaver team two years ago that was
known as Miller's Dwarfs. The laid-back Martin, appropriately enough, became
Sleepy.
</P>
<P>
"Now I'm trying to wake up a little bit," Martin joked. "If things go my way, I
hope to keep on playing (after college)."
</P>
<P>
That would be no small accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
The Loyola Marymount women's basketball team, which had lost five straight
games and its outside touch, got back in the groove this week in a 85-71
victory over visiting Western Michigan.
</P>
<P>
The Lions shot 52% from the field and had the best shooting night of the season
from guard Kristen Bruich, who hit nine of 17 shots, including five of seven
from three-point range to ring up 28 points. Her back-court companion, Lynn
Flanagan, added 20 points on six of 11 accuracy and hit eight of nine free
throws. The Lions' shooting was augmented by forward Jamie Jesko, who hit four
of six shots off the bench. The Lions held the visitors to 42.5% shooting, 35%
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
The victory raised the Lions' record to 3-5. After taking the Christmas weekend
off, they take a chilly holiday swing north, playing at Boise State on Thursday
and Idaho State next Saturday before returning to Gersten Pavilion in January
for a five-game home stand and the start of conference play.
</P>
<P>
College Notes: Basketball official Bill McCabe on working hectic Loyola
Marymount games: "I did six of them last year. I've paid my dues" . . . The Cal
State Dominguez Hills women's soccer team was honored with a proclamation from
the Carson City Council for its outstanding season.

TITANS GET LOST, THEN LOSE TO AKRON, 48-17;
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: AFTER FULLERTON FINDS THE RUBBER BOWL, AKRON CAPITALIZES ON
FIVE INTERCEPTIONS.
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
AKRON, Ohio
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cal State Fullerton was heading north for Cleveland Saturday until someone
informed the bus driver that the Titans were playing at Akron.
</P>
<P>
How foretelling: Fullerton's game against the Zips turned just as abruptly as
the Wrong-Way Titans did on Interstate 77.
</P>
<P>
Fullerton took a 10-point lead in the first quarter but collapsed amid a flurry
of turnovers and mistakes and lost, 48-17, in front of 10,241 at the Rubber
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
The Titans (1-3) looked like world-beaters in the first quarter but did a good
job of beating themselves during the next two, in which they were outscored,
48-7.
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Paul Schulte, who threw for 183 yards in the first quarter and
appeared headed for a school passing record, set a record all right -- for
interceptions in a game. He was picked off five times, tying Bob Caffrey's mark
of five against Utah State in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Fullerton also lost two of its three fumbles, had a punt blocked deep in its
own territory, missed several tackles and dropped several passes, one for a
potential touchdown.
</P>
<P>
The Titan defense, which held Auburn and Mississippi State to less than 200
yards rushing each, couldn't contain Akron's option offense, which featured the
running of quarterback Jeff Sweitzer (111 yards and two touchdowns) and
tailbacks Doug Lewis (63 yards, two touchdowns) and Marcus Reliford (86 yards).
The Zips had 285 yards rushing and 443 total yards.
</P>
<P>
"We met the enemy and the enemy was us," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said. "We
dropped passes, lost fumbles, threw interceptions . . . After the first
quarter, we should have got on the bus and got out of there."
</P>
<P>
The game turned during a four-minute span early in the second quarter. First,
Fullerton kicker Phil Nevin's 32-yard field goal attempt that would have
extended the lead to 13-0 was ruled no good, a call the Titans disputed and the
Zips even wondered about.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it went right through the uprights," said Akron center Mike
O'Connor, a Mater Dei High School graduate. "I couldn't believe the call. We
got a break there."
</P>
<P>
Then, after Daron Alcorn's 37-yard field goal cut the deficit to 10-3 with
13:22 left in the second quarter, J.J. Celestine fumbled on the ensuing kickoff
and Chris Owens recovered for the Zips (3-0-1) at the Titan 16-yard line.
</P>
<P>
It took Akron one play to tie the score at 10, as Lewis took a pitch and raced
around left end for a touchdown and Alcorn added the extra point.
</P>
<P>
Akron forced Fullerton to punt on its next possession, but Nevin's attempt was
blocked by Kenneth Greene and recovered by Shawn Donaldson at the Titan 10. Two
plays later, Lewis scored on a two-yard run for a 17-10 lead with 10:48 left in
the quarter.
</P>
<P>
The rest of Fullerton's game went just like the All-American Soap Box Derby
course located behind the Rubber Bowl -- all downhill.
</P>
<P>
Schulte, who completed seven of 12 attempts and ran a successful no-huddle
offense in the first quarter, completed one of 12 passes in the second and
third quarters before being pulled in favor of Terry Payne early in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
Zips cornerback Shawn Vincent had three of the five interceptions, helping
Akron increase its season total to 15 in four games.
</P>
<P>
"There were no major changes in the second quarter, we just started picking up
their offense," Vincent said. "After they drove on us a few times, our coach
(Gerry Faust) got on us on the sideline, screaming and yelling at us, and we
started playing ball."
</P>
<P>
And having a ball too. The Zips began picking up chunks of yardage on option
runs, many of them by Sweitzer. Sweitzer also evaded several Fullerton blitzes,
turning one scramble into a 30-yard touchdown run in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
"Watching Fullerton on film, I was more scared of them than any other team
we've faced," Sweitzer said. "I was surprised at how much running room we had."
</P>
<P>
The running game also opened up the passing game for Sweitzer, who completed
four of 13 attempts for 47 yards in the first half but improved to five of six
for 94 yards and two touchdowns in the second.
</P>
<P>
"We were down at the beginning of the game, but we showed what we're made of
and came out and blew them away," Sweitzer said.
</P>
<P>
Murphy isn't sure what the Titans are made of. Fullerton played well in losses
to Auburn and Mississippi State, teams the Titans weren't supposed to beat,
then they're blown out by a team they were expected to be competitive with.
</P>
<P>
Murphy believed the Akron game would give him an indication of how Fullerton
would do in Big West Conference play, which begins next week at Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
"If you take this game from the second quarter on, it doesn't look to good for
us," Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
Titan Notes
</P>
<P>
What should have been a 15-minute ride to the Rubber Bowl became a 75-minute
trip because the bus driver thought the Titans were playing at Cleveland's
Municipal Stadium. About 20 minutes into the trip, Titan associate athletic
director Walt Bowman, realizing they were going the wrong way, ordered the
driver to stop the bus. But the driver didn't know how to get to the Rubber
Bowl. "Three gas stations later, we finally made it," Bowman said. . . . Some
Fullerton highlights: Schulte's 48-yard pass to Richard Harrison in the first
quarter, his 63-yard pass to Greg West, who made a leaping catch between two
Akron defenders in the first quarter, and Reggie Yarbrough's 63-yard touchdown
run in the third. . . . Zips cornerback Shawn Vincent got a hand on Phil
Nevin's 32-yard field goal attempt, but the ball caromed off the right upright
and through the goal post in the first quarter. . . . Akron linebacker John
Clark, who is on the watch list for the Dick Butkus Award, and fellow
linebacker Brian Hilk each made 18 tackles. . . . Titan offensive tackle Mike
Simmons didn't play because of an ankle injury.

SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WILL SPLIT INTO 2 DIVISIONS, PRESIDENTS DECIDE

<P>
The presidents of the 12 Southeastern Conference schools have voted to divide
the SEC into two divisions, with each team playing eight league football games
a year, the SEC announced today.
</P>
<P>
The presidents also approved on Wednesday, during a telephone conference call,
a plan for a 16-game men's basketball schedule.
</P>
<P>
The division of the conference was made possible when Arkansas and South
Carolina agreed to become new members earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The SEC office said Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee and
Vanderbilt will be in one division. Alabama, Arkansas, Auburn, Louisiana State,
Mississippi and Mississippi State will be in the other.
</P>
<P>
The football schedule, expected to be in place for the 1992 season, when South
Carolina and Arkansas officially join the league, will feature a championship
game between the divisional winners.
</P>
<P>
Under a 5-2-1 format, each SEC team will play all five teams in its own
division and two permanent opponents in the other division each season, then
will rotate among the four other schools, playing one per season.
</P>
<P>
The two permanent opponents of each school are: Florida -- Auburn and LSU;
Georgia -- Ole Miss and Auburn; Kentucky -- LSU and Mississippi State; South
Carolina -- Mississippi State and Arkansas; Tennessee -- Arkansas and Alabama;
Vanderbilt -- Alabama and Ole Miss; Alabama -- Tennessee and Vanderbilt;
Arkansas -- South Carolina and Tennessee; Auburn -- Georgia and Florida; LSU --
Florida and Kentucky; Ole Miss -- Vanderbilt and Georgia, and Mississippi State
-- Kentucky and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Constitution, quoting an unidentified source close to the
presidents, said presidents voted 10 to 2 for the alignment. The SEC declined
to reveal the vote.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, every SEC member will play every other member at least twice
during an eight-year period. The order of non-divisional rotating opponents
will be determined later.

Quarterback David Klingler passed for 457 yards and a career-high seven
touchdowns in Houston's 62-28 victory over Arkansas, extending the Cougars'
winning streak to 11 and Razorbacks' losing streak to four. Arkansas (2-5) is
off to its worst start since 1958, when it opened with six losses. The 62
points were the most scored against Arkansas in a Southwest Conference game,
topping the 60 by Baylor in 1922. Klingler tied the school record of seven
touchdown passes set last year Andre Ware. The junior has passed for more than
400 yards in six of seven games this season. Roman Anderson's 19-yard field
goal with 6:18 left gave him 314 points, breaking the SWC scoring record of 312
by running back James Gray of Texas Tech from 1986-89. It was the 57th field
goal of Anderson's career, one shy of the SWC mark by Texas' Jeff Ward.
</P>
<P>
No. 19 Clemson sacked Wake Forest quarterback Phil Barnhill eight times in a
24-6 victory. It was the 500th victory in Clemson history and the 14th in a row
over Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
Penn State's 9-0 victory over Alabama was the Crimson Tide's first shutout loss
at home in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
No. 8 Miami bounced back from last Saturday's loss to Notre Dame with a 45-10
victory over Texas Tech. The Hurricane defense, ranked eighth nationally,
allowed Texas Tech only 93 yards and held the Red Raiders to 41 yards in 44
plays through three quarters. Defensive end Rusty Medearis had five sacks, and
Shane Curry and Darrin Smith each had two. Three of Craig Erickson's four
touchdown passes went to Lamar Thomas, who set a school record for most
touchdown receptions in a game.
</P>
<P>
Darren Lewis became the Southwest Conference's rushing leader for a career with
176 yards in 25 carries in Texas A&amp;M's 41-15 victory over Rice. Lewis has
4,453 yards, breaking the mark of 4,450 set by Eric Dickerson of Southern
Methodist from 1979-82.
</P>
<P>
Behind quarterback Greg Frey, Ohio State scored on its first four possessions
and five of its first six to take a 38-17 lead over Minnesota at the half. The
Buckeyes' 52-23 victory gave Minnesota its first Big Ten loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
Chip Hilleary passed for a personal best 221 yards and ran for 102 more in
Kansas' 27-24 victory over Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
Mark Brus of Tulsa broke Howard Waugh's record of 250 rushing yards set in 1952
with 312 yards against New Mexico State.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES
</P>
<P>
Iowa State Coach Jim Walden, after the Cyclones, playing without injured
running back Blaise Bryant, lost to Nebraska, 45-13: "This week, I had to
create an offense against one of the best defenses in the country. They are
good, and don't let anyone tell you that they haven't played anybody. They will
be just as good when someone finally decides that they are playing somebody,
and I think that will probably happen next week." The No. 4 Cornhuskers play
No. 10 Colorado Saturday.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
HE'S EVERYWHERE
</P>
<P>
Washington quarterback Mark Brunell did a little bit of everything in a 46-7
victory over California. He caught an 11-yard touchdown pass from Beno Bryant
and completed a 56-yard pass play for a touchdown to Greg Lewis in the third
quarter. After the 56-yarder, the point-after kick was blocked, and Brunell
picked up the ball and passed to Darius Turner for the two-point conversion.
Brunell also scored on a 32-yard run in the second quarter. Lewis had another
big day. He ran for 205 yards, his ninth game in a row of at least 100 yards.
With 1,126 yards this season, he became the first Washington runner to have
consecutive 1,000-yard seasons. Lewis' 13 100-yard games over two seasons are a
school record.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THIS ONE'S FOR YOU
</P>
<P>
Kevin Tisdel's 85-yard kickoff return for a touchdown helped No. 16 Georgia
Tech hold off Duke for a 48-31 victory. The Blue Devils had come back to trail
by 24-21 with 2:23 left in the third quarter before Tisdel broke four tackles
on his kickoff return, eluding three defenders who had him surrounded at the
Tech 45. It not only helped assure the victory, it got Tisdel, a sophomore
walk-on, a free education. "Tisdel now has a scholarship as of January."
Georgia Tech Coach Bobby Ross said. "I told him after the game that I'm not
holding it any longer. That son of a gun just gets it going for us."
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BIG PLAYS
</P>
<P>
Shaun Smith's interception in the end zone with 36 seconds left preserved
Rutgers' 20-17 victory over Akron.
</P>
<P>
Darrel Crawford blocked Joel Logan's conversion kick with 2 1/2 minutes to play
to ensure No. 2 Auburn's 17-16 win over Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
Chip Eichloff's 58-yard field goal in the fourth quarter broke the Kansas
record of 57 yards, set by Bruce Kallmeyer against Iowa State in 1983, and was
the difference in a 27-24 victory over Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
Raghib (Rocket) Ismail had 116 rushing yards in Notre Dame's 31-22 victory over
Pittsburgh. His 49-yard reception set up a field goal that gave the Irish a
17-7 lead, and his 76-yard touchdown run pushed the lead to 24-7. He had 214
all-purpose yards.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

THE 200 CLUB
</P>
<P>
There was nothing easy about Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden's efforts for his
200th victory. After failing in two previous games, No. 12 FSU defeated
Louisiana State, 42-3. But Bowden's victory celebration was marred by a
bench-clearing, free-for-all after Florida State was penalized for a late hit
on the game's final play. Coaches and stadium authorities moved in to separate
the players. Last Saturday against Auburn, a similar penalty helped the Tigers
beat Florida State, 20-17. The week before that, Florida State had lost to
Miami.

Terry Jordan ran for one score and passed for another, and Greg Manior ran 41
yards for a late touchdown, but it took a defensive stand to assure North
Carolina State's 31-27 victory over Brett Favre and Southern Mississippi in the
All American Bowl Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Jordan scored on a 10-yard run and passed 12 yards to Bobby Jurgens as the
Wolfpack (7-5) spoiled the coaching debut of Jeff Bower, who took over at
Southern Mississippi (8-4) when Curley Hallman left after the regular season to
accept the Louisiana State job.
</P>
<P>
N.C. State was leading, 24-21, when linebacker David Merritt intercepted a pass
with about six minutes left. Manior scored on the next play to make it 31-21.
</P>
<P>
Brett Favre, who passed for 341 yards, drove the Golden Eagles 86 yards for a
final touchdown, with a five-yard run by Michael Welch cutting the N.C. State
lead to four points. This proved to be crucial when, with time running down,
Favre drove the Golden Eagles to the N.C. State 20. With Southern Mississippi
forced to try for a touchdown instead of a field goal, Favre was sacked by N.C.
State's Mark Thomas as time expired.
</P>
<P>
Favre, who passed for 7,695 yards during his career, completed 28 of 39
attempts, throwing for two touchdowns with one interception.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who took over the starting quarterback job in the Wolfpack's sixth game
and finished with 1,221 yards, completed 15 of 25 passes for 166 yards and a
touchdown.

<TEXT>     The third-ranked Hurricanes acted like gentlemen Saturday in their season
opener against Arkansas. In fact, the only rude thing they did was rout the
home team 31-3 in Little Rock, Ark.;   "They were a very clean football team
today," said Arkansas center Mark Henry.;   Miami Coach Dennis Erickson has
urged his players to follow the new NCAA rule, which went into effect after
the Hurricanes piled up 202 yards in penalties during a 46-3 rout of Texas on
New Year's Day. Erickson's message apparently got through.;   Gino Torretta,
the latest in a long line of celebrated Miami quarterbacks, completed 17 of 33
passes for 297 yards and TDs of 99 and 42 yards.; AUBURN 32, GEORGIA SOUTHERN
17: The No. 17 Tigers rallied from a 17-0 deficit as Stan White threw for 236
yards and two touchdowns, to beat the Eagles, two-time defending Division I-AA
champions, in Auburn, Ala.; PITTSBURGH 34, WEST VIRGINIA 3: Alex Van Pelt
threw for two touchdowns as the Panthers routed the Mountaineers in the first
Big East football game for the two teams in Morgantown, W.Va.; ILLINOIS 38, E.
CAROLINA 31: Jason Verduzco threw three touchdown passes as the Illini built a
38-10 lead and held off the Pirates in Champaign, Ill.; GEORGIA 48, W.
CAROLINA 0: Freshman Eric Zeier passed for 172 yards and two touchdowns as the
Bulldogs overpowered the Catamounts in Athens, Ga.; SACRAMENTO ST. 43, PACIFIC
40: Jim Crouch kicked a 47-yard field goal with 4 minutes, 25 seconds left as
the Hornets edged the Tigers in Stockton. Troy Mills rushed for 193 yards for
Sacramento State. Pacific's Troy Kopp passed for 363 yards and Ryan Benjamin
rushed for 209.; UTAH 12, UTAH ST. 7: Bryan Rowley turned a deflected pass
into a 46-yard gain, then lateraled to teammate Greg Hoffman for what proved
the winning touchdown at the end of the first half as the Utes edged the
Aggies in Salt Lake City.; MISSISSIPPI ST. 47, FULLERTON ST. 3: Fullbacks
William Prince and Michael Davis each scored two touchdowns as the Bulldogs,
in their first game under Coach Jackie Sherrill, routed the Titans in
Starkville, Miss.; LOUISVILLE 24, E. KENTUCKY 14: Jeff Brohm threw for two

<TEXT>
<P>
Practicing on the beach proved to be a good way for the top-ranked Kansas
Jayhawks to prepare for Wednesday night's game at Miami.
</P>
<P>
Rick Calloway led seven Kansas players in double figures with 16 points as the
unbeaten Jayhawks blitzed Miami, 100-73, for their 17th victory of the season.
They had worked out on a court drawn in the sand after arriving Tuesday in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
Joe Wylie, who scored 16 points in the first half and 20 in the game, kept
Miami (4-6) in contention early before Kansas' depth began to take a toll.
</P>
<P>
Kansas, averaging 95.4 points going into the game, reached the 100 mark for the
fifth time. Miami gave up 100 for the first time this season and suffered its
most lopsided loss.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Pritchard had 14 points for Kansas, which shot 56%.
</P>
<P>
No. 5 Missouri 106, Southern 87 -- Even without its coach and two guards, the
Tigers had too much of everything. They scored the game's first 17 points at
Columbia, Mo., before coasting to their 14th victory in 15 games.
</P>
<P>
Missouri Coach Norm Stewart, who missed the team's final 14 games last season
after he was diagnosed as having colon cancer, was absent because of the flu.
</P>
<P>
Travis Ford, who started Missouri's last three games, was hospitalized with a
strained back, and Lee Coward was benched because of a cracked rib.
</P>
<P>
Doug Smith finished with 24 points and 15 rebounds for Missouri. Nathan Buntin
added 21 points and 17 rebounds.
</P>
<P>

points and grabbed seven rebounds as the Orangemen used a 19-9 spurt to pull
away in the second half in a Big East game at Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
Syracuse shot 67% in the second half to improve to 11-1, 2-1 in conference
play, and stop St. John's eight-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Thompson added 20 points and Billy Owens had 17 for Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
No. 12 Arkansas 99, Baylor 84 -- Todd Day and Ron Huery each scored 19 points
in the Razorbacks' Southwest Conference victory at Little Rock, Ark.
</P>

Maryland 98, North Carolina 88 -- Walt Williams scored a career-high 33 points
as the Terrapins beat the Tar Heels for the first time in nearly four years in
an Atlantic Coast Conference game at College Park, Md.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that North Carolina (10-6) lost an ACC opener since 1980.
The Tar Heels were behind, 85-72, with 2:35 to play before making a 14-5 run
and pulling within 90-86 on a three-point shot by Hubert Davis.
</P>
<P>
Maryland (2-1, 10-4) held on by making 20 of 22 free throws over the final
6:50.
</P>
<P>
Kentucky 89, Florida 81 -- Sean Woods made 10 of 12 free throws during a 17-9
spurt in the final 3:49 that helped the Wildcats snap a five-game losing streak
in an SEC game at Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
Florida (5-5 overall and 1-2 in the SEC) had tied the game, 72-72, when Dwayne
Schintzius sank one of two free throws with 3:57 remaining.
</P>
<P>
Woods led Kentucky with 20 points. Reggie Hanson added 19, Deron Feldhaus 14
and Derrick Miller 12.

half, as the Longhorns held off the Horned Frogs in a SWC game at Ft. Worth.

LSU BEATS OLD MISS IN GAME THAT BENEFITS PARALYZED PLAYER

<P>
Tommy Hodson passed for three touchdowns and ran for another Saturday as
Louisiana State held off Mississippi, 35-30, in a Southeastern Conference game.
</P>
<P>
Hodson, LSU's all-time leading passer, passed for 381 yards as the Tigers
improved to 2-6. Ole Miss, playing before a record crowd of 42,354 at
Vaught-Hemingway Stadium, dropped to 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Tailback Eddie Fuller caught two of Hodson's touchdown passes, a 46-yard,
first-quarter bomb to open the scoring and a 13-yarder in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fans at Saturday's game donated more than the expected $50,000 for a
health-care plan for Ole Miss player Roy Lee (Chuckie) Mullins, who was
paralyzed during a game last week. Final figures were not immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
"We will go well beyond our minimum goal," Ole Miss Chancellor Gerald Turner
said.
</P>
<P>
The reserve defensive back was injured on Oct. 28 when he tackled a Vanderbilt
receiver while breaking up a pass play. Mullins fractured the third, fourth,
fifth and sixth vertebrae in his neck when he took a blow on the top of his
head.
</P>
<P>
Ole Miss has set up a trust fund to help provide lifetime care for Mullins, and
one student collected at least $17,000 on her trip through the record 42,354
fans, and $19,000 was collected in a sky box.
</P>
<P>
"The best thing about this is the united effort of people from all
backgrounds," said Turner, who also predicted the fund-raiser would exceed the
$150,000 needed to set up a "significant endowment fund" for Mullins.
</P>
<P>
LSU officials donated money and other universities said they would send money
for what he called a long-term recovery effort for the injured athlete.
</P>
<P>
Mullins reportedly had been able to sit up and listen to part of the game on
radio.

<P>
Cal State Fullerton was heading north for Cleveland Saturday until someone
informed the bus driver that the Titans were playing at Akron, which was to the
south of the team's hotel in Fairlawn, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's game against the Zips in the Rubber Bowl wound up turning as
abruptly as the Wrong-Way Titans did earlier on Interstate 77.
</P>
<P>
Fullerton took a 10-point first-quarter lead but collapsed amid a flurry of
turnovers and mistakes and lost, 48-17, before 10,241.
</P>
<P>
The Titans (1-3) looked like world-beaters in the first quarter but did a good
job of beating themselves in the next three.
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Paul Schulte, who threw for 183 yards in the first quarter and
appeared headed for a school passing record, set a record all right -- for
interceptions in a game. He was picked off five times, tying Bob Caffrey's mark
set against Utah State in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Fullerton also lost two of its three fumbles, had a punt blocked deep in its
own territory, missed several tackles and dropped several passes, one a
potential touchdown.

The Titan defense, which held Auburn and Mississippi State under 200 yards
rushing, couldn't contain Akron's option offense, which featured the running of
quarterback Jeff Sweitzer (111 yards and two touchdowns) and tailbacks Doug
Lewis (63 yards, two touchdowns) and Marcus Reliford (86 yards).

"We met the enemy and the enemy was us," Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
"We dropped passes, lost fumbles, threw interceptions. After the first quarter,
we should have got on the bus and got out of there."
</P>
<P>
The game turned during a four-minute span early in the second quarter. First
Fullerton kicker Phil Nevin's 32-yard field goal attempt that would have
extended the lead to 13-0 was ruled no good, a call the Titans disputed and
even the Zips wondered about.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it went right through the uprights," said Akron center Mike
O'Connor, who is from Mater Dei High in Santa Ana. "I couldn't believe the
call. We got a break there."
</P>

Then, after Daron Alcorn's 37-yard field goal cut the deficit to 10-3 with
13:22 left in the half, J.J. Celestine fumbled on the ensuing kickoff return
and Chris Owens recovered for the Zips (3-0-1) at the Titan 16-yard line.

<P>
It took Akron one play to make the score 10-10, as Lewis took a pitch and raced
around left end for a touchdown and Alcorn added the extra point.
</P>
<P>
Akron forced Fullerton to punt on its next possession, but Nevin's attempt was
blocked by Kenneth Greene and recovered by Shawn Donaldson at the Titan 10. Two
plays later, Lewis scored on a two-yard run for a 17-10 lead with 10:48 left in
the quarter.

<P>
Schulte, who completed seven of 12 passes and ran a successful no-huddle
offense in the first quarter, completed one of 12 passes in the second and
third quarters before being pulled in favor of Terry Payne early in the fourth.

<P>
Zip cornerback Shawn Vincent had three of the five interceptions as Akron
increased its season total to 15. Akron used five defensive backs and played
mostly zone, but disguised its defense by covering Titan receivers close to the
line of scrimmage -- giving the look of man-to-man coverage.
</P>
<P>
"There were no major changes in the second quarter, we just started picking up
their offense," Vincent said.
</P>
<P>
"We came out flat in the first quarter and weren't ready for the hurry-up
offense. After they drove on us a few times, our coach (Gerry Faust) got on us
on the sideline, screaming and yelling at us, and we started playing ball."
