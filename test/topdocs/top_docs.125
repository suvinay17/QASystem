   Sony is thinking small in a big way about video. 

   A decade after its Betamax home-video format lost out to rival VHS, Sony Corp. of America, a unit of the Japanese consumer-electronics giant, is trying to force its way back into the video limelight with its 8mm format, launched four years ago. 
Sony hopes to popularize "Video 8" through the concept of "personal video" -- video wherever you go -- as exemplified by its Video Walkman line: tiny battery-operated color mini-TVs with built-in videocassette recorders. 

   Sony Corp. has heavily promoted the Video Walkman since the product's introduction last summer, but Bob Gerson, video editor of This Week in Consumer Electronics, says Sony conceives of 8mm as a "family of products, camcorders and VCR decks," whose sales will reinforce one another. 
He dismisses the Video Walkman as an attention-getting gimmick aimed mainly at well-heeled trend setters: "At $1,000 a pop, you don't sell many of these things." 
However, he adds, "It's no secret that Sony is looking at 8mm as an all-purpose format." 

   More important to the future of 8mm is Sony's success in the $2.3 billion camcorder market. 
The Japanese company already has 12% of the total camcorder market, ranking it third behind the RCA and Panasonic brands. 

   But 8mm video faces problems and tough competition. 
For instance, the rival VHS format has "really got its hooks into the American consumer," says Thomas Chesser, an electronics analyst at Smith Barney. 
And, 8mm cassettes can't be played on existing VHS equipment. 
In addition, there's a relative lack of film titles available in 8mm. 

   The great advantage of 8mm is size. 
Over the past four years, 8mm video camcorders have been a big success among home-video buffs and techno-junkies, who have bought more than one million of the compact units that record and play videos on tapes the size of audiocassettes. 
That compares with roughly paperback-book dimensions for VHS. 

   Accordingly, most VHS camcorders are usually bulky and weigh around eight pounds or more. 
In contrast, Sony this month will introduce a full-featured, $1,500 palm-sized 8mm model, the CCD-TR5 Handycam, tipping the scales at less than two pounds. 

   But 8mm is not automatically the walk-away winner in the compact-camcorder sweepstakes. 
To compete with Video 8, Matsushita Electric Co.'s 51%-owned JVC unit introduced in 1986 a compact version of its dominant VHS format, called VHS-C, that is nearly as small as an 8mm videocassette. 
And VHS-C can be played on existing VHS machines with only a simple adapter; by contrast, 8mm tapes are incompatible with the VHS machines. 

   At present, VHS-C machines can record for only 20 or 30 minutes, while 8mm tapes run as long as two hours. 
JVC says it is developing a 40-minute VHS-C cassette and that an enhanced Super VHS version of VHC-C (or S-VHS-C) due this fall would be long enough to show a feature film in the extended-play mode with little detectable picture deterioration. 

   This summer, JVC launched an ad campaign emphasizing the VHS-C's compatibility advantage over 8mm, while its sister company, Panasonic, recently cut list prices $100 to $200 on some of its VHS-C models, to as low as $799. 
List prices on Sony's camcorders begin at $1,300. 

   Another problem for Sony is that while nearly every movie title is available on VHS cassettes, there are currently only about 1,400 titles on 8mm video. 
Of those, roughly 250 are feature films; the rest are video magazines, instructional films and documentaries. 
At present, Sony itself is the primary distributor of prerecorded 8mm tapes through its mail-order Cinema 8 movie club. 

   Bill Fisher, national software-marketing manager with Sony Video Products Co., says the company is adding three titles a month through licensing agreements with the home-video units of Paramount Communications Inc., Nelson Entertainment Co. and Warner Communications Inc. 
For its part, the unit of what will soon be Time Warner Inc., entered the market last fall with 33 older catalog titles, and this year will release 20 new 8mm titles. 
And other companies, such as MGM/UA Communications Co. and RCA/Columbia have agreed to license some older titles to Sony. 

   Some studios remain hesitant to enter the market because there isn't a critical mass of 8mm machines in consumers' homes. 
"It's the proverbial chicken and egg situation," says George Krieger, president and chief executive officer of CBS/Fox Home Video, a leading videocassette distributor that is a joint venture of CBS Inc. and News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox studio, which isn't supplying any 8mm tapes at present. 
Likewise, MCA Inc.'s home-video unit, which distributes movies made by Universal Studios, says it's looking at the business but isn't in it yet. 

   And video retailers are entering the market warily. 
Tower Records, a 50-store audio and video retail chain based in Sacramento, Calif., has been "testing" 8mm software sales since April in 12 of its leading stores. 
John Thrasher, Tower's top video buyer, says he is "really pleased" with most of the test locations, but hastens to add: "I don't know how big of an investment that we as a retailer can invest in {another} video format." 
In any case, he says he intends to keep at least "a representation of some really hot titles" in 8mm. 

   Minneapolis-based Musicland Group announced last Friday that it will begin test marketing of prerecorded 8mm cassettes at 19 of its 745 audio and video outlets this month. 
RKO-Warner Video Inc., a 31-store New York-area chain, is also dipping its toe into the 8mm pool this month. 
"We want to be there if there is a business in 8mm," says Jeff Levy, RKO-Warner vice president, for purchasing. 

   Despite the heat of competition, Mr. Gerson of This Week in Consumer Electronics thinks Sony can succeed in the home-video market in the same way it has thrived in the highly competitive color-television-set market. 
"Sony only has 8% of the market," he explains, "but they have 20% of the {high-end} market they want, and that's not bad."

   After resisting for years, Sony Corp. finally is yielding to pressure to sell VHS-format videocassette recorders. 

   But Sony won't abandon its pioneering Beta format, even though VHS commands at least 90% of world-wide sales for videocassette recorders. 

   In Tokyo, Sony announced plans to sell VHS machines in Europe, starting this spring. 
Initially, the machines won't be made by Sony but will only bear its name. 
Some Japanese newspapers have reported that Hitachi Ltd. will make the Sony-brand machines, and Sony hasn't denied those reports. 

   The company's Sony Corp. of America subsidiary, in Park Ridge, N.J., plans to introduce the VHS machines in late fall. 
"This is complementary to our existing products," says Shinichi Takagi, president of Sony of America's consumer video products division. 
"The only hole I can't cover with the present lineup is the VHS area." 

   It is a gaping hole, one the parent company long refused to address. 
In fact, Sony waited so long that it missed the VHS boom. 
Sales of VHS recorders, the premier growth product in consumer electronics in the 1980s, now are stagnating, largely because 52% of U.S. households -- up from 3% six years ago -- already have VCRs. 

   With its first Betamax model, in 1975, Sony ignited the home-video revolution and created a huge market-though mostly for others. 
In the U.S. alone, manufacturers' sales of VCRs totaled $5.25 billion last year, the Electronic Industries Association says. 

   But Sony failed to persuade some rivals -- notably Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. -- to adopt the same technical standards for home video recorders. 
They brought out the incompatible VHS machines, which prevailed partly because they initially allowed for longer taping. 
Moreover, while videophiles say Beta provides a superior picture, more prerecorded material became available in the VHS format. 

   At a confidential brainstorming session in Rye, N.Y., in December 1983, Sony of America executives saw the handwriting on the wall. 
One former Sony planner recalls their conclusion: "We had lost the format battle, and it was pointless to continue fighting." 
But the parent company continued to hold out. 

   On principle, Sony preferred the superior technology, and it feared alienating the big base of Beta devotees. 
About 25 million Betamax machines are in use world-wide -- about 15% of the estimated 170 million existing home VCRs. 
More recently, Sony professed to see no point in entering a market that has turned fiercely competitive -- with manufacturers proliferating, sales growth lagging and prices tumbling. 
"We don't like to just chase sales volume -- we like to do the more profitable items," Masaaki Morita, chairman of Sony of America, said in October. 

   Now, says Mr. Takagi, there is a point to selling VHS: synergy. 
Some consumers prefer to buy systems of a single brand, so the existence of Sony VHS recorders might help sell Sony television sets. 
Also, dealers have long pressured Sony to sell VHS machines, thinking its name would make for an especially salable item. 

   As for the possibility of turning a profit on VHS machines, Mr. Takagi says he sees little chance at the low end of the market, where many companies churn out essentially similar commodities. 
But Sony will seek to develop new features and special designs. 
"There should be a way to make this business a little profitable," he says. 
Because of the dollar's decline, Japanese makers are having trouble earning a profit in the U.S. 

   In Tokyo, Sony said its VHS machines "will be designed to interface with other Sony video and audio products in order to provide for the smooth integration of editing, remote control and connection functions." 
That might allow users of 8mm camcorders, for example, to make VHS copies of their tapes to send to people with only VHS players. 

   No details are yet available on Sony-brand VHS machines to be offered in the U.S. Sony's existing Betamax recorders bear U.S. prices of $300 to $1,300. 

   Meanwhile, Sony says it will continue to develop and promote two other formats: an upgraded Beta version called extended-definition Beta and the 8mm camcorder format. 

   Mr. Takagi says Sony hasn't any plans to sell the enhanced VHS format called Super VHS, which many of its rivals are now introducing. 
Since prerecorded Super VHS material isn't yet available, he notes, there isn't much demand for Super VHS machines. 
In any case, Sony hopes its extended-definition Beta format will win the market for enhanced home recordings.

   Prepare for the next round of the video wars. 

   The opponents are familiar archrivals Sony Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Japan's biggest consumer-electronics concern. 
The new weapons are portable videocassette recorders with tiny, built-in televisions. 
The Japanese media has already dubbed the imminent fight "Video War Three." 

   On Wednesday, Matsushita unveiled a video recorder-television, weighing slightly more than three pounds, that has a three-inch diagonal color screen. 
The company is pitting its product against Sony's Video Walkman, a nearly 2 1/2-pound model that Sony plans to begin selling in Japan later this month. 

   "It's going to be a hit product," says Keiichi Maesato, an analyst at James Capel Pacific Ltd. 
"And it could well be another war between the formats." 

   Initially, that war will be played out on Japanese soil, where cramped houses and long train commutes from the suburbs of most major cities make the machines a good bet, some analysts say. 
These new recorder-televisions could do for video what Sony did for the stereo cassette player, suggests an analyst at Daiwa Securities Research Institute. 
"It could very well become another Walkman," he says. 
"Businessmen will be watching movies on the trains." 

   The products aren't expected to arrive in the U.S. until sometime next year at the earliest. 
Matsushita will begin selling its new recorder-television in Japan in October, a spokesman says, but won't start selling it overseas -- under its Panasonic nameplate -- until "next year or later." 

   Meanwhile, other electronic giants, such as Toshiba Corp. and Hitachi Ltd., are expected to enter the recorder-television market. 
Matsushita, which is called MEI in Japan, "is like IBM," says Mr. Maesato of James Capel. 
"Other consumer electronic companies wait for MEI," then follow quickly. 

   That pattern has been all too familiar for Sony. 
Known for pioneering many successful consumer products, Sony was first to market a successful home video recorder when it sold its Betamax in 1975. 
But close behind was Victor Co. of Japan, the Matsushita subsidiary that countered with its VHS-format video recorders in 1976. 
VHS recorders proceeded to dominate the market. 
Sony effectively conceded defeat when it announced its own VHS machine last January. 

   When Sony fired the next salvo, its 8mm video camera, JVC was close behind with a competing product that uses VHS-C format tapes, which don't fit in Sony's machines. 
Backers of the competing formats -- which use cartridges roughly the size of audio cassettes -- currently are fighting out what the Japanese media are calling "Video War Two." 

   For the third video war, Sony and Matsushita have combined those cartridges with the latest generation of tiny TVs -- flat, liquid-crystal display screens about the size of a credit card. 
Sony's new Video Walkman uses an 8mm-tape and will sell in Japan for 128,000 yen ($965). 
Matsushita's version, called the Maclord AV Gear, uses VHS-C tape and will sell for 188,000 yen ($1,417). 

   A few movie distributors in Japan are already dubbing films on the 8mm-format. 
Publishing concerns plan to market video versions of business and music magazines for the gadgets. 
Many Japanese, the argument goes, would rather watch their magazines than read them.

<LEADPARA>  VIDEO equipment tops many Christmas lists, so this is a good time to pinpoint
standout designs and good values.;   Camcorders continue to be the most
popular video items. Even in a troubled economy, their sales soar, despite
list prices that start about $1,000. Many novice videographers prefer the
VHS-C format, which combines compactness and compatibility. Tapes made with

<TEXT>     Among the least expensive models of this type is Panasonic's PV-21 ($999),
which offers an ingenious refinement known as electronic image stabilization.
This automatically compensates for camera jitter resulting from unsteady hands
and also lets you shoot from a moving car without jiggling the picture. In
effect, it places a phantom tripod under the camera.;   Another remarkable
model in the VHS-C format is the JVC GR-AX10U ($1,199), which is so
light-sensitive that it can be used to make videos by candlelight.;   Most
compact camcorders now operate in the 8mm format. These cassettes do not fit
into standard home VCRs; they are played by plugging the camcorder into a VCR
or TV set by means of a simple connecting cable, with the camcorder itself
serving as a playback device.;   The advantage of this system is that it can
record up to two hours per cassette (as compared to 30 minutes in VHS-C)
without sacrificing image quality or compactness. Moreover, the sound in the
8mm format is generally far better. Good values in this group include RCA's
Pro860 ($999) and Sony's CCD-TR51 ($1,200), which is one of the smallest and
lightest camcorders. They would be a preference for those experienced with
video.;   Excellent models in the Hi8 format are Sony's TR-81 ($1,500) and
RCA's Pro880HB ($1,749). In a class by itself is the ultra-sophisticated Canon
L1 ($2,999), the first compact camcorder with interchangeable lenses and
near-professional capabilities. JVC's GR-S505U ($1,599), at 2 1/2 pounds, is a
highly capable and lightweight camcorder in the Super-VHS-C format.;   Editing
equipment is an ideal Christmas present for video fans who already own a
camcorder. The Videonics DirectED Plus ($599), for instance, performs
electronic editing similar to the cutting and splicing of film.;   Much
interest is focused on videodisc players these days. Offering a picture
greatly superior to video cassettes, many quality-conscious video watchers are
now adding laser disc players to their lineup of video components.;   Most of
these so-called omni-players play both audio CD's and videodiscs and thus
serve efficiently in combined audio-video systems. Lower prices have also
contributed to their growing popularity. Sony's MDP-333 ($650) and Yamaha's
CDV-1700 ($699) are economy models notable for their high technology.  </TEXT>

   Camcorder Makers, With Growth Easing,
   Try to Bring New Markets Into the Picture

   NEW YORK -- In 1990, camcorders sold at a record pace:
Dealers bought three million, 30% more than the year before.
The consumer electronics industry, which had been fighting
stagnant sales, thought it had found one of those rare "hot"
products, the sort that would surely sell at double-digit
rates well into the 1990s.
   But the hovering recession has slowed purchases of
big-ticket items, and the average retail price for the
lightweight video cameras still hovers around $850. Most
industry executives expect 1991 sales to be flat.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   As a result, camcorder makers are rethinking their
approach. Some now worry that the easiest market -- young
parents and newlyweds -- may already be saturated, and they
question just how big the potential camcorder market really
is. "Remember the old generation of super 8 home movie
cameras your father used?" asks Stan Hametz, general manager
of consumer video for Panasonic Co., a unit of Matsushita
Electric Industrial. "They never reached beyond 35% of the
population."
   Manufacturers realize they have to find new markets beyond
Young Parents With Dog or Cat. "If the makers can convince
people it's a replacement for the still camera, to be used by
all age ranges, that will extend the life of camcorders,"
says Clark Johnson of NPD Group, a market research company.
   From the camcorder's introduction in 1983 until this year,
sales growth had been strong. But the devices can be found in
only 14% of U.S. homes (in Japan, penetration has reached
20%). Color TV sets, by contrast, are in 97% of U.S. homes,
and VCRs are used in 74%.
   Some executives say that means a huge, untapped audience
awaits. The question is how to get all those people to buy.
About 43% of camcorder owners are parents under 45 years old
with children living at home, according to the Photo
Marketing Association. A puny 3.9% of camcorder buyers are
young singles; only 5.9% are retired older couples.
   To reach new customers, camcorder marketers are
redesigning their products to play down snazzy technology and
cut down on the profusion of push buttons. Some brands are
pitching new business uses, and others are boosting their
sales help to demystify their products for wary customers.
   But manufacturers are still resisting making prices much
more attractive. Even as they reduced prices and scrambled to
unload high warehouse inventories before Christmas, major
brands stubbornly stayed in the $700 range for their
stripped-down models.
   Sony Corp., most often the premium price leader and the
market leader, led off a round of price-cutting in September
by twice slashing the tag on models in its "family series,"
bringing the lowest retailer-advertised price on a Sony
camcorder to $699. Thomson S.A. followed by chopping $100 off
the prices of a pair of RCA 8mm camcorders, and others, such
as Canon Inc.'s U.S. subsidiary, were forced to follow.
   "It's no mystery that a premium-priced camcorder in this
recession is going to be a difficult purchase," says Alan
Czeizler, a sales director in Canon U.S.A.'s video division.
"We need something to spice up the pot and make it a bit more
appetizing."
   So far the price cuts haven't been enough. Sales of
videocassette recorders exploded when prices fell to the $200
to $300 range. "If adult penetration is to reach 75%, the
price {of camcorders} will have to come below $500," contends
Tom Adams, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates. "When that
happens, camcorders will open up to a whole new group."
   Yet camcorder makers are balking. "A $500 price doesn't
reflect the real cost of the machine. A more reasonable price
is $799 to $999," says Panasonic's Mr. Hametz. Others say the
actual costs can't be all that much higher than for a VCR,
which contains many of the same features and semiconductor
chips. The fat, they say, is in the profit margins, which are
considerably better than those for more mature products like
compact-disk players and cassette-tape decks -- for
manufacturers and retailers alike.
   In searching for a new kind of customer, Sony has been the
most obvious with its ad campaign for the Handycam line. In
its "Fun Day" spots, a voice intones, "Between the weddings
and the birthdays comes the rest of your life," as a young
urban couple frolics -- and films -- with nary a baby
stroller in sight.
   "In the past, the ads were all about kids, babies,
weddings and bar mitzvahs," says Larry Barruch, Sony's vice
president of advertising in its consumer products group. "We
wanted to show this can be fun at other times."
   Other rivals aren't straying far from the core market of
young parents. "We've tried some senior-market magazine
advertising, and we've tried some other things," says Canon's
Mr. Czeizler. "But the ideal demographic for us is still a
pregnant woman walking into a store to look at a camera."
   In selling to the first wave of camcorder customers -- the
"early adapters" who relish owning the newest high-tech
gadgetry -- manufacturers played up new features year after
year. Panasonic pushed "digital electronic image
stabilization," which eliminates a shaky camera picture.
Canon offered camcorders that can exchange lenses with a 35mm
still camera. Makers also played up their drive for
miniaturization. Earlier this year, Sony proudly unveiled the
world's lightest camcorder, 1.3 pounds, only to be bested two
weeks later by a 1.28-pound Canon model.
   But such wizardry doesn't necessarily attract potential
buyers in the next wave. Acknowledging that, Mitsubishi
Electronics America Inc. plans to introduce a line of VHS-C
camcorders with fewer and bigger buttons at the Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas next month. Its instruction
book will be shortened and rewritten.
   Makers are also pushing new uses. Sony has just begun
selling the "V Box" through computer dealers. Aimed at
businesses and selling for $399, it adds full-motion video to
computer software. Last year Sony introduced the Color Video
Printer for $1,200. It makes snapshot-like color prints from
videos.
   But potential buyers can be confused by the three camera
formats, 8-millimeter, VHS and VHS-C. Many people still
think, wrongly, that an 8mm tape can be played on a VHS
videocassette recorder. To change that, Panasonic sent
"demonstrators" to retailers like Sears and Circuit City to
explain which format does what. Early results show that at
those stores, camcorder sales jumped.
   Sony dominates the 8mm format, which was introduced in
1984 and is the fastest-growing segment, accounting for 52%
of the market. The tapes are the size of audio cassettes and
give a crisper image than VHS, but they must be played back
through a camcorder hooked up to a TV set.
   The more bulky VHS format has fallen to 33% of the market
and is drifting lower; it uses paperback-book-sized tapes,
which can play directly on a VCR. A third format, VHS-C,
holds about 15% of the market and plays smaller VHS cassettes
that can be dropped into cassette adapters that play in a
standard VCR.
   Sony's spending on marketing indicates it wants to
continue its role as market leader. It is outspending the
next biggest media spender, Canon, 3 to 1; for the 12 months
ended in June, Sony spent $18 million, according to Leading
National Advertisers.
   But Sony is still uncertain where its campaign is headed
in 1992. Camcorders now get more corporate advertising
dollars than its Trinitron TV or Walkman lines, but Mr.
Barruch says he is conducting focus groups to figure out what
approach to use in 1992. "We are looking to see," he says,
"what will stimulate people to buy."

   Videocassette recorders. 
Compact-disk players. 
Camcorders. 
Waves of new products have lifted sales of consumer-electronics products to $28.72 billion at factory level last year from $6.74 billion a decade earlier. 

   With growth receding now, the industry sorely needs new splashes. 
One candidate, digital audio tape recorders, has won much notice. 
So have new compact disks with pictures as well as sound. 
Here's a sampler of other items at the summer Consumer Electronics Show. 

   ---
   Personal-stereo fans will be courted with "personal video." 

   Sony Corp., which gave the world the Walkman, says millions of Americans will someday bop around with all-in-one devices that shoot and record video pictures, as well as receive TV signals, and play them on 2.7-inch liquid-crystal screens. 
The Japanese company's U.S. unit is showing a prototype -- without the camera -- that's about eight inches wide and resembles some portable radios; a production model may be sold next year. 

   Meanwhile, Sony will sell a camcorder that weighs less than three pounds, and miniature playback decks, including a desktop model with a five-inch TV screen attached. 
The camcorder will initially list at $1,650. 
But marketers claim trend-setting customers aren't fazed by high prices.

   High-resolution VCRs provide much sharper pictures. 

   For example, fine detail of flowers and leaves -- not seen on standard videotapes -- shows up, the result of improved VHS technology. 
Of two rival formats for today's video recorders -- Beta and VHS -- the latter commands most of the market. 
Now, Victor Co. of Japan and its licensees think VHS owners will trade up to a new format called Super VHS, despite initial list prices of $1,200. 
That's at least a $400 premium on the new machines, available in July. (Beta's developer, Sony, also has an improved format-extended-definition Beta in the works.) 

   Old VHS tapes look the same on Super VHS machines, but newly recorded tapes produce a picture with more than 400 horizontal lines, compared with 240 or so for VHS. 
One catch: Most TV sets display 330 or fewer lines, though some new models go up to 560. 
Another: Super-VHS recordings aren't yet available.

   Beware the bureaucrat: Rubber stamps are going electronic. 

   A $229 calculator comes with extra keys to write messages -- of up to 1,800 characters, and twice that many with a $35 accessory. 
Using heat-transfer technology, the messages can be stamped onto paper from an inked tape at the bottom of the hand-held device. 
The product -- available next January from Casio Computer Co. of Japan's U.S. unit -- is named HandyWriter. 

   ---
   "Wireless" speakers make home stereo systems handier. 

   New York-based Recoton Corp. will sell speakers that come with an electronic transmitter to be wired between the speakers and any stereo-sound source. 
The speakers will work if plugged into any electrical outlet on the same transformer as the transmitter. 
The wires between speakers and sound source are eliminated, so the speakers can be easily played in any room of the house or on the patio. 
The device and two speakers will cost $250 retail and be available in September. 

   ---
   High-powered executives may soon carry briefcases with solar power. 

   Samsonite Corp., a division of Chicago-based Beatrice Corp., is showing a plastic briefcase with a solar panel riveted to the side. 
The panel produces electricity that charges any rechargeable batteries carried inside the briefcase; Samsonite says the power is sufficient to run a cellular telephone all day. 
Peter G. Dulka, a sales manager, says the product is available "on special order" at a wholesale price of about $300. 

   ---
   Telephones just don't look like telephones any more. 

   For example, Panasonic Co., a unit of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan, has a portable model about as small as a pack of king-size cigarettes. 
"For all intents and purposes, it's like the Star Trek communicator," says Michael J. Troetti, a Panasonic sales manager. 
It will be available in September for about $200. 

   For people who want something larger, Panasonic offers a telephone attached to an answering machine, copier and facsimile-transmission device. 
It will list for about $2,000 and reach stores in August. 

   ---
   These gadgets can help you organize your gadgets. 

   First, learn a buzzword: "home-automation system." 
One version -- aimed at running all the electronics in a house from a single push-button telephone -- will cost $1,200 to $8,000, depending mostly on the size of the house. 
The marketer is Mitsubishi Electric Sales America Inc., a unit of Mitsubishi Electric Corp. of Japan. 
Sitting at the phone, the user could operate audio and video equipment, burglar alarms, appliances, telephones, lights and more. 
Initial deliveries are set for December. 

   Also new is a $199 device billed as "the most intelligent component ever designed." 
The unit can control all remote-control equipment -- such as TVs, stereos, satellite dishes, VCRs, compact-disk players and security devices. 
The designer is Steve Wozniak, who was a founder of Apple Computer Inc. and whose new company is named CL9. 

   ---
   Last but not least: a television that costs more than a Mercedes. 

   It even makes owners of Kloss Video Corp.'s $4,295 TV sets look like pikers. 
It's a projection model -- from Mitsubishi -- powerful enough to fill a movie screen with a nearly 17-foot diagonal. 
Mitsubishi has just two U.S. orders so far; deliveries will begin in August. 
Most customers are expected to be corporations, but the company thinks that "a select few" individuals also may want one. 

   The price: $50,000.

VIDEO EVOLUTION MEANS TRAVELING CAMCORDERS NO LONGER FORCED TO PLAY THE ROLE OF 
HEAVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEFFINGWELL, Leffingwell is a Times staff photographer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Time was when home video stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
The early video cameras were bulky, two-piece affairs that prompted bystanders 
to wave in the background and ask what channel they were going to be on. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, is the era of the two-pound, one-piece camcorder that fits in a 
large handbag yet packs more features than some studios offered a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
With plenty of options available -- tapes alone come in six formats -- a 
vacationer should talk with a knowledgeable salesperson before buying a 
camcorder and heading out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg Burger of Samy's Camera in Los Angeles points out that camcorders using 
the VHS format are the number-one sellers. That's no surprise, considering VHS 
is the most popular format for home videocassette players. 
</P>
<P>
But he adds that the popularity of VHS is waning. "VHS' biggest drawback is its 
size and weight," he said. "We ask customers what their use will be." 
</P>
<P>
The most highly recommended camcorders are those that capture the clearest 
image in the lightest and smallest package. But convenience of playback is 
another consideration. A bulkier, less-expensive camcorder is more likely to be 
compatible with the cassette player you already own. 
</P>
<P>
Following are the main tape formats: 
</P>
<P>
 -- VHS and Super VHS. Super offers 66% greater resolution. Both types of 
cassette run for two hours and can be played on most home VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- VHS-C and Super VHS-C. "C" stands for compact. The cassettes are less than 
half the size of VHS but run only 20 minutes. Both adapt easily to play on most 
home VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eight-millimeter and Hi-8. The cassettes are the same size as VHS-C but 
offer two-hour recording and slightly better resolution. They cannot be adapted 
to play on most home VCRs. However, with a simple cable, the 8-millimeter or 
Hi-8 camcorder can be plugged directly into a TV set for playback. (The same 
can be done with VHS and VHS-C camcorders.) 
</P>
<P>
Newer TVs with better resolution are best for Hi-8 play. For either 
8-millimeter or Hi-8 you can buy a special cassette player, but, honestly, 
you're better off saving your money for vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Burger's cut-to-the-basics recommendation: 
</P>
<P>
"For quality, weight and size, buy regular 8 or Hi-8. There are more than 30 
camcorders to choose from, from $699 up to $2,500. Hi-8 is the best bet, with 
new televisions capable of showing more lines of resolution. But if your TV is 
old, put the extra money into accessories." 
</P>
<P>
Ah, accessories . . . 
</P>
<P>
Buyers' foremost concerns reflect the effectiveness of advertising. Auto-focus, 
power zooms with long ranges, high-speed shutters and super-impose capabilities 
are all features that customers demand. 
</P>
<P>
But Burger says some questions reflect more advertising knowledge than 
technical familiarity. "People ask how many 'pixels' a camcorder will have. Or 
they'll ask what is the 'lux' level. What they know is that the higher the 
pixels the better, and the lower the lux the better." 
</P>
<P>
A pixel is a "picture element," the dots that make up the image on the screen. 
Lux is a measure of light intensity under very specific conditions. The more 
pixels, the greater the contrast and definition on the screen, while low lux 
numbers reflect a camera's ability to record an image in low light. 
</P>
<P>
Among the many manufacturers, both Sony and Canon offer a full line of 
8-millimeter camcorders. Both make their own equipment to cover a broad price 
range. And both offer purse-size lightweight cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Sony's TR-5 weighs just under two pounds (all weights are quoted without 
battery or tape). 
</P>
<P>
Canon's equivalent E06 weighs two pounds. Both feature 6-1 zoom lenses, auto 
focus and auto-exposure. But expect a premium price for the miniaturization. 
Sony's TR-5 sells for $999, while Canon's EO6 costs $1,299. 
</P>
<P>
The difference? Canon's has stereo sound recording, a "FlexiGrip" viewfinder 
and a wireless remote controller, enabling the user to put himself in the video 
more creatively. 
</P>
<P>
If you're willing to lug a few more ounces, prices drop. Canon's low-end E51 
sells for $899. But it still has the remote controller, stereo sound and 
FlexiGrip. Sony's version is the F33 at $799. But the Sony zooms out to a wider 
view without accessory lenses. The Sony weighs 2 pounds 10 ounces, the Canon 2 
pounds 7 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
Mid-range, both companies' 8-millimeter camcorders get intensely creative with 
features. Sony's F77 (2 pounds 10 ounces; $1,295) has an 8-1 zoom, stereo 
sound, programmable "exposure" ("sports" switches to a higher shutter speed to 
freeze the action crisply, while "portrait" softens background focus to center 
interest on the subject), freeze frames, slo-mo, super-impose functions (which 
allow you to copy a title, put it in memory and then call it up for recording 
when the scene matches the title), a wireless remote control and a 
through-the-lens auto-focus system. 
</P>
<P>
Canon's E808 (2 pounds 11 ounces; $1,449) offers a similar 8-1 zoom, FlexiGrip, 
remote controller, a built-in title-maker and high-speed shutters for sports 
video. Canon's auto focus uses an infra-red system that reacts more quickly and 
is more accurate in very low light. 
</P>
<P>
At the high end, numerous features make virtually anything possible. Sony 
offers the V101 Hi-8 (replacing the V99, which was the first Hi-8 camcorder). 
</P>
<P>
Priced at $1,559, the Sony Hi-8 (2 pounds 10 ounces) produces 410,000 pixels. 
Four auto-exposure modes provide sport and portrait settings, as well as 
shutter or aperture priorities just like sophisticated 35-millimeter cameras. 
</P>
<P>
Canon, not to be outdone, has just introduced a most-unusual-looking Hi-8 
machine, the A1 Mk II. At $1,888, the Canon (3 pounds, 5 ounces) features 10-1 
zoom, seven shutter speeds and all the rest, matching Sony's 410,000 pixels. 
</P>
<P>
But before you head for the airport, be sure to test all your equipment 
thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Charge the batteries (always carry a spare), make a tape, try some titles, 
shoot some sports and some portraits, and shoot in the dark. Then pack extra 
blank tapes. Better to have too many than too few. 
</P>
<P>
Now sling that two-pound-something camcorder over your shoulder, just where the 
snappy 35-millimeter camera used to hang, and start making pictures that move 
and speak.

MAKE IT A QUALITY HOLIDAY WITH THE BEST IN CASSETTE AND DISC PLAYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Christmas and Hanukkah 1990 promise to be a video holiday. 
</P>
<P>
There already are one or more videocassette recorders-64 million machines-in 
nearly 70% of all homes in the United States and that number will jump this 
holiday season as both first-time video buyers and consumers looking for a 
second VCR or laser video disc players crowd home video stores. 
</P>
<P>
More and more Americans are considering a VCR a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
If you have never bought a piece of home-video equipment before or if you want 
to upgrade your system, or simply want to add a second or third VCR, there are 
some things to bear in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Never buy a VCR with two heads no matter how cheap the machine (and you will 
find them for $200 or less). These machines simply do not adequately play back 
prerecorded tapes. If you want a cheap, second VHS machine, you can find a 
four-head VCR for $300 or less. Go with established manufacturers such as Sony, 
"CA, JVC or Zenith. 
</P>
<P>
The key question is what kind of VCR to buy. There are seven types: Super VHS, 
VHS Hi-Fi, conventional VHS, Beta, ED Beta, 8mm and Hi8. More than 300 
different VCRs fall into one of those groups. 
</P>
<P>
The smart money is to ignore all of the VCRs and jump into the laser video disc 
field buying a combination player that plays audio CDs as well as laser video 
discs. Prices range from less than $500 (a basic player) to as much as $4,500, 
a double-sided player with digital special effects and the best picture you can 
currently buy for the home. 
</P>
<P>
A laser disc machine that records is still several years away for the American 
consumer. Our choice until then: Pioneer CLD-3080 (less than $1,400), which 
plays both sides of the disc, offers digital special effects and has a S-Video 
Output (connectors designed to send color and brightness signals separately, 
resulting in an improved picture). 
</P>
<P>
If you must have a machine that records programs off the air and plays rental 
tapes, the best choice is a Super VHS machine that sells for about $1,500. 
Ed-Beta and Hi8 offer comparable pictures, but only a Super VHS machine will 
play those conventional VHS tapes. Our choice: Mitsubishi HS-U82 (less than 
$1,700). The Toshiba SV-F990 (less than $2,300) is also a nifty machine with 
digital effects and the most practical feature any new VCR can have: PIP, the 
picture-in-a-picture that puts an inset picture from a separate video source on 
a TV screen with a main picture. 
</P>
<P>
Before you buy, shop around. During the holiday season, prices will vary by 
several hundred dollars depending on the store's stock and sales policy. It 
doesn't hurt to shop at a store that offers service and installation. 
</P>
<P>
The optimum color television picture size for most homes is about 31 inches. 
Forget the traditional living-room cabinet and go for the new monitor-receivers 
with vastly superior picture resolution and direct audio/video inputs so you 
can easily connect your VCR and other components. 
</P>
<P>
Forget the bigger front projection and rear projection screens. Most are too 
big for the average room and next to most 31-inch models, they look anemic. Our 
choice: Proton VT-331 with the best-looking picture we've ever seen (less than 
$2,500). The 27-inch model (less than $1,500) is just as good, although the 
smaller picture does diminish the home video experience. If you never heard of 
Proton, don't worry. Just compare its picture to any other monitor-receiver and 
you'll be sold. It's that good. 
</P>
<P>
If you are to really enjoy the audio-video experience in 1990, it is essential 
that you combine your stereo system with your TV set. The picture may still be 
primitive compared to theatrical standards, but the sound can easily equal or 
surpass the performance of most movie theaters' sound systems. 
</P>
<P>
The most important thing to look for is an audio-video receiver or sound 
processor that includes Dolby Pro Logic. This multichannel configuration 
(front, center and surround channels) will change your routine TV viewing into 
something very special. 
</P>
<P>
Good choice for audio-video receiver: Pioneer VSX-9700S (less than $1,350) with 
all the bells and whistles available. Our choice for sound processor: Yamaha 
DSP-A700 (less than $1,000) together with the audio-video selector unit, Yamaha 
AVS-700. It's the best surround sound processor we've heard. Many experts are 
touting the new THX system from Lucasfilm. It's terrific, but the price tag is 
too high for most consumers' pocketbooks (Tehnics SH-TX100, about $12,000). 
</P>
<P>
Whether you are looking for a bargain VHS machine with minimum performance or 
state-of-the-art magic flirting with digital freeze-frame and broadcast stereo 
sound, there's plenty to choose from in 1990's avalanche of video products. 
</P>
<P>
The VCR, like the television set before it, has irrevocably changed the 
American home: 
</P>
<P>
With cable and pay-TV offering an unprecedented variety of product and the 
price of movie rentals falling to less than a buck a day, it's the perfect time 
to join the millions of consumers who have created a home entertainment center 
that a decade ago was only a pipe dream.

<HEAD>Sony To Market VHS-format VCRs in United States</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: A version on the financial wire.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sony Corp. said today it will begin marketing
VHS-format video cassette recorders in the United States this fall.
   A Sony official said the electronics giant began marketing
VHS-format VCRs in Europe in May and will begin selling them in
Japan July 21.
   Sony has produced and marketed only Beta-format VCRs in the
past, and the official said Sony will continue to market
Beta-format VCRs at home and abroad in fiscal 1988, which ends next
March 31.
   Sony's decision to manufacture VHS-format VCRs capped a long
rivalry between its Beta system, introduced in 1975, and the
incompatible VHS standard, introduced a year later by the Japan
Victor Corp. (JVC).
   Since their introduction, the number of companies selling Beta
machines has declined while VHS models have grown in popularity,
currently accounting for an estimated 90 percent of the world
market.
   Analysts have said Sony was not active enough in soliciting
other companies to join it in making and marketing the Beta system,
and was late in responding to consumer demand.

   Polish and Price Cuts at Electronics Show

   When the doors open on the Consumer Electronics Show
tomorrow morning in Chicago, the buyers and dealers that
thrive on the show's razzle-dazzle aren't likely to find much
that's really new, but they will encounter a big marketing
push for refinements of older products, and some sharp
price-cutting.
   Missing will be hot new technologies in the pipeline to
get customers spending big again. "There's no
earth-shattering something that's going to come jumping out
of the back room," says Ed Hearne, national merchandising
manager for home electronics at Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   So the buyers who flock to Chicago -- the men and women
who decide what products make it onto store shelves this fall
-- will be looking for incremental changes and resurrected
technologies. They're getting both this weekend in such
gizmos as laser video disk players, smaller camcorders and
bigger televisions with theater-quality sound. "It's mostly
enhancements or refinements to what already exists," says
Michael Fidler, marketing vice president for Pioneer
Electronic Corp.'s U.S. home electronics unit. "The only
breakthroughs will be price breakthroughs."
   Retailers say they expect to see plummeting prices at the
show in products such as cordless telephones, cellular phones
and pocket televisions with flat screens. Facsimile machines
are expected to fall under $400, one buyer says.
   One of the show's hottest technologies, retailers say,
will be a 10-year-old product: the laser-disk player. The
machines, which play movies from 12-inch disks in the same
fashion that compact disk players spin CDs, will be a
top-billed item at several prominent booths. Panasonic Co., a
U.S. unit of the giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp.,
plans to show its first laser-disk models, priced at $850 and
$1,400. Denon America Inc., a unit of Japan's Nippon Columbia
Co., says it will unveil its first laser-disk model, meant
for well-heeled videophiles.
   The technology isn't new, but big buyers are excited about
it anyway. After having languished on the market since
Pioneer introduced the first ones in 1980, the laser-disk
player is finally getting a stamp of approval now that
Panasonic has entered the market, says Donald Rothenstein,
senior merchandising manager for electronics at Sharper Image
Corp.
   "Laser disk has been in its infancy for 10 years now,"
says Mr. Rothenstein. "Now it seems to be breaking out of it.
Things are really starting to get interesting." Unit sales of
laser-disk players are expected to jump about 34%, to
215,000, this year, according to the Electronic Industries
Association, a trade group. Pioneer estimates that unit sales
will hit 250,000, and some makers think sales could go as
high as 400,000 units.
   Why such excitement over a gadget many thought was dead
several years ago? For one thing, consumer electronics
companies and retailers have so successfully saturated U.S.
homes with the old bonanza products, such as videocassette
recorders and audio equipment, that little new growth is
expected from those products.
   Laser-disk players also owe their long-awaited day in the
spotlight to the evolution of another old technology: large
screen televisions. With the color television market long
saturated, big Japanese makers are falling over each other to
stretch TV screens ever larger. Mitsubishi Electric Corp.
showed a 120-inch model at an earlier show this year, and
buyers expect even bigger screens to make their debut this
weekend, as well as cheaper models using liquid-crystal
diodes, which create a better picture with a smaller
projector.
   But videotaped movies can be grainy on the bigger screens,
and don't provide great sound either. Laser disks, which use
lasers to read digitally recorded movies, provide a much
clearer picture with compact-disk-quality sound.
   A critical mass of movies on disk has become available
this year, with over 4,000 titles on the market, retailers
say. And the price of players that can handle all five types
of laser disks -- from 3-inch and 5-inch audio disks to the
12-inch video disk -- will fall under a critical threshold
this weekend, they say. Pioneer says it will unveil at the
show a player called the CLD980 with a list price of $500;
Pioneer says it will sell at a "street price" of less than
$399, compared with the $1,000 and more that typical machines
cost last year.
   Backing up the move to laser disks are new technologies to
squeeze better sound out of movies for what the industry
calls "home theaters," essentially large-screen television
sets combined with expensive audio gear. Matsushita will show
a new system that provides theater-quality sound using THX
technology licensed from Lucasfilm Ltd. Matsushita will sell
components that seek to emulate what THX, which dictates how
audio signals are interpreted and where speakers are placed,
does in 500 theaters around the world.
   By backing laser disk, Matsushita is admitting defeat; it
backed another video-disk format in the early 1980s that
failed. But the company plans to fire up another old feud
this weekend, this one with Sony Corp. Matsushita will unveil
a tiny new 1.7-pound camcorder, a camera built into a
recorder. Called the Palmcorder, the $999-to-$1,099 gadget is
an effort by Matsushita to reverse the declining share of the
growing market for camcorders that use cassette-sized tapes
rather than the paperback-sized VHS tapes.
   That's a challenge to the king of the mountain, Sony.
Matsushita's cameras use so-called VHS-C format tapes; Sony's
rival mini-camcorders use the incompatible, 8mm format. "The
mini-camcorders wars have started up again and are heating up
rapidly," says Sharper Image's Mr. Rothenstein. "It's the
ongoing saga of those two battling it out."
   Sony and its followers are winning: 8mm camcorders had a
26% share of the $2.2 billion camcorder market last year vs.
VHS-C's 11%, according to Dealerscope Merchandising, a
consumer electronics trade journal. (The remaining 63% went
to full-sized camcorders.) Industry executives expect 8mm's
share to grow to 35% this year. Stan Baker, vice president of
video merchandising at Good Guys Inc., says about 85% of the
retailer's compact camcorder sales are 8mm machines.
   And Sony is already gloating about at least one powerful
ally who plans to join the 8mm camp at the show. Hitachi Ltd.
is expected to announce its first 8mm camera, which it will
sell alongside its VHS-C format player. "A year ago they were
saying `I'd rather sell my mother than sell 8mm,'" says Mr.
Baker. "It's a nice turnabout for Sony. Eight millimeter is
absolutely the product of choice."
   A different kind of feud, a political one between Japanese
electronics giants and U.S. recording interests, will also
still be simmering. In what has become a standing issue for
consumer shows, many makers will show digital-audio tape
players with no price tags and no firm shipping dates.
   Sony, which announced with much fanfare earlier this year
that it would start selling this summer, still hasn't firmed
up shipment dates. And despite approval earlier this week by
the Japanese government of a new standard that seeks to
prevent rampant copying, Pioneer has decided it isn't
"prudent" to show a DAT player at all, says Pioneer's Mr.
Fidler. "We're not at a point where it is totally resolved
and there are questions of viability of it in terms of
growth."
   A number of Japanese companies have scheduled news
conferences for today and Monday to announce that they plan
to start selling DAT recorders soon. Spokesmen for Matsushita
and Aiwa Co. said they would announce plans to sell the
machines in Japan, and Matsushita said it would sell
Panasonic machines in the U.S. by "late summer." A spokesman
for another major company, who asked not to be identified,
said the company today will announce plans for impending
sales in both countries.
   But the U.S. hasn't approved DAT standards, so the
introduction of the products in this country remains
uncertain. After many years of promises followed by delays,
buyers aren't optimistic that the technology will be
available in the U.S. any time soon. DAT would be an
attractive technology to boost a sagging industry, but only
"if the industry and copyright holders and the government
could get together and get it resolved," says Mr. Hearne of
Sears. "We definitely wouldn't want to get caught in the
middle."

<HEAD>JVC Announces Digital Sound for VHS Videos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   JVC has developed a method for recording
high-quality digital sound on VHS videotapes, a company official
said today, which should allow future Super VHS machines to match
or surpass compact disc players in sound quality.
   ``Digital sound is the wave of the future, so we have developed
a digital audio recording method for VHS,'' the official said.
   Digital recording allows greater dynamic range and lower noise
levels than conventional analog methods.
   Current VHS videocassette recorders use frequency modulation
(FM), a non-digital method, to record high-fidelity sound. The new
machines will record both FM and digital audio, making the tapes
and equipment compatible with earlier VHS machines, JVC said.
   Prototypes using the new technology have been developed, but no
date has been set for marketing, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The price is expected to be higher than for current Super VHS
equipment. Super VHS, introduced in 1987, uses special tapes and
circuitry to provide higher-quality pictures than normal VHS.
   Currently, VHS machines record video and FM audio signals on two
different layers of the videotape's magnetic coating in a technique
called depth multiplexing. The digital sound information will be
recorded on the same layer as the FM signal, JVC said.
   The company, whose formal name is Victor Co. of Japan, is the
original developer of the VHS format and a member of the Matsushita
Group, which makes Panasonic and Technics products.
   The JVC official said the new technology would allow direct
recordings from other digital sources such as satellite broadcasts.
Japan's public broadcasting network, the Japan Broadcasting Corp.
(NHK), broadcasts television programs with digital sound directly
from a stationary satellite.
   However, direct digital recordings from compact discs will not
be possible without an adapter.
   The company said it expects a wide range of applications for the
new technology, from general consumer goods to professional
equipment.

   Stuck on what to buy this Christmas?
   Make it video!
   Whether you want to splurge, spree, invest or just stuff a few
stockings, here are some wonderful items to buy and some excellent
excuses for buying them.
   SPLURGE:
   A new television set with a 27-inch screen.
   If you're a typical American, you've been watching that 19-inch
tube for more than a few years while new technology has been making
it obsolete.
   This is no time to wait for High Definition TV. The best
estimates put HDTV at least five years away from the expensive end
of the marketplace and maybe even longer before it's affordable in
the mass consumer market.
   Japanese manufacturers are designing video and audio circuitry
that tweaks the TV signal for all it's worth. They make ``enhanced
definition'' with much sharper pictures, even if you live in an
area where cable TV isn't available everywhere. Much of the
broadcast soundtrack in major U.S. cities is in hi-fi stereo, so a
tinny little speaker just isn't going to make it for the 1990s.
   An ``inexpensive'' 19-inch set costs about $200 in a discount
house. It's about $400 for a 19-inch TV loaded with the new
technology, and about $700 for a low-end, high-tech 27-inch tube.
   In areas where such electronic goods are heavily discounted, you
can shop around and get a stunning, stereophonic ``cable-ready'' TV
set for less than $1,000. We're talking automatic tuning, inputs
for multiple video sources, outputs to your home stereo, a
``smart'' remote control and a picture that'll knock your eyes out.
Go for it.

<TEXT>
   SPREE:
   A combination LaserDisc and compact disc player.
   If you haven't already taken the plunge into digital audio for
your home stereo, you should. Compact discs don't wear out and make
any stereo system sound startlingly better. The budget-minded
approach is to buy a small portable unit to start, then trade up to
a full-featured model. But if you've got some Christmas money to
throw around, why not get into digital audio with a machine that
also plays videos? They cost around $500 in the discount houses,
but the LaserDisc image is said to be 60 percent sharper than the
best VHS player and the sound quality is just like a CD.
   Newly released LaserDiscs are sometimes cheaper than VHS tapes.
A VHS new release that retails for $89.95 is in the video disc rack
for $49.95, and some may sell for $29.95. And in theory LaserDiscs
don't wear out and the digital signal will never become obsolete.
   Also, there are certain features you can't get with a VCR, such
as ``letterbox'' formatting that allows you to see the wide screen
image.
   In the ``full-feature'' LaserDisc format, the producers include
incredibly comprehensive supplementary material. The three-disc
package for the 1936 classic musical ``Showboat'' includes excerpts
from the 1929 Universal film version, excerpts of Ziegfield's 1932
Broadway revival, interviews with stars, a color film documentary
on showboats, a visual essay of 300 stills tracing the history of
showboats and the history of the musical on stage, screen and
radio, and enough other archival material to choke a librarian.

   INVEST:
   _A VHS player.
   Not a recorder, mind you, but a transportable, play-only machine
that can run off a 12-volt car, boat or RV system and is about half
the size and half the cost of a videocassette recorder.
   It's great to have a backup when your main VCR breaks down. It's
great to have a portable VCR when you're on vacation or out of the
country. You have to look for these, but they're available at most
video dealers and start at around $150.
   _A four-head, hi-fi, Super VHS videocassette recorder. Or, at
the very least, a stereo VCR that you can pipe through your home
audio system.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   STOCKING STUFFERS:
   _A non-abrasive VCR head cleaner. Use it only when you have
significant deterioration in picture quality. Tape heads are
delicate, precision devices and should not be messed with.
   _Blank tapes. People never have enough blank tapes and they
never buy themselves high quality tapes.
   _Videocassette storage racks. People never have enough places to
store videocassettes, which need and deserve a safe, dust-free
resting place.
   _A year's worth of cable TV service. Surprisingly affordable.
Gift certificates are available. Call your local cable company for
details.
   _Videocassettes. Most people are surprisingly reluctant to buy
themselves their favorite movies, and you usually know what your
friends and relatives enjoy, from ``Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles''
to rock concert videos, operas and great games of the World Series.
   Even better, the emergence of big retail video chains and the
plethora of available programming has pushed down the price of
video software.
   Suprisingly, the monster hits of recent years are most heavily
discounted. ``Batman,'' the summer megahit, is couponed, rebated
and generally knocked down to less than $20. ``Who Framed Roger
Rabbit'' lists for about $20; ``E.T. The Extraterrestrial'' is
about $25. ``The Right Stuff'' lists for around $30, and the newly
restored version of ``Lawrence of Arabia'' is $40.
   There's also an abundance of competitively priced,
Christmas-oriented programming in video stores at this time of the
year, from old favorites such as Irving Berlin's ``Holiday Inn'' to
cartoons that will hose down the kids late on Christmas Day.
   _LaserDiscs. Any great film makes for a great disc, and most are
digitally remastered to take advantage of the technology. ``Blade
Runner'' is a big favorite; so are ``Gone With the Wind'' (cropped
back down to its original format and its colors restored) and ``The
Godfather.'' But the hit pick for Christmas giving has to be
``Lawrence of Arabia.''
   The 1962 Academy Award-winning film was restored from its
original negatives under the supervision of director David Lean,
who added 20 minutes of footage cut from the original release. The
standard CLV ($49.95) and the extended play (3 discs, $124.95 list)
contain copious supplementary material.

   SOME VIDEO DON'Ts:
   _Don't buy for video collectors without very specific knowledge
or instruction. Either they'll already have it, they'll quibble at
the quality of the recording or the format, or they'll say they
only wanted ```Ishtar,' any format, man.''
   Buy them a can of compressed air for blowing dust out of their
machines or a spray bottle of glass cleaner and no-lint paper
towels. Buy them a videocassette rewinder (battery-powered, $29.95
at Radio Shack) or a bulk eraser to get rid of unwanted recordings.
   _Don't forget to buy ``Instant Fireplace,'' at $9.95 _ the
logical culmination of a television culture. Put the cassette in
the VCR. Punch ``play.'' Watch the video of fire burning in
fireplace. Listen to the appropriate music. Wonder about the
decline of the West.

   Home video is an integral part of most American households
today, with some 60 percent of American households having a
videocassette recorder, but it's not that long ago that home video
was in its infancy.
   A recent issue of Video magazine recounted the milestones in the
short history of video.
   The first practical videotape recorder was introduced at the
National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters
convention in the early '50s, says Video. The Ampex VTR was almost
as big as a room and cost more than $100,000, making it practical
only for professional use.
   After many attempts to develop a consumer-acceptable home taping
system, Sony finally delivered the SL-7200 in 1975, kicking off the
home video revolution. With a maximum one-hour taping time and no
pre-recorded video available to speak of, owners of the new Sony
VCR were restricted to taping programs off broadcast television.
Victor Co. of Japan, a subsidiary of Matsushita, debuted its
competing VHS format the following year.
   Pre-recorded movies appeared in 1980 when Magnetic Video signed
with 20th Century Fox to distribute 50 movies. These included
``Patton,'' ``The French Connection,'' ``Hello Dolly,'' ``The Sound
of Music'' and ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.'' It would be
a few more years before video stores and rental videos began to
appear.
   The first home video cameras were introduced in 1980, reports
Video magazine.
   In the fall of 1983, the first camcorder appeared on the scene.
The Sony BMC-110 Betamovie camcorder combined all the taping
essentials _ camera, VCR (record only), and power source _ in a
six-pound package.
   The Akai 7350 VCR, introduced in 1981, was the first
stereophonic VHS deck and featured Dolby noise reduction.

disks are particularly vulnerable to decay, because computers can't ignore
missing data the way audio CD players do. Should I go back to 78 rpm records

<HEADLINE>  SCRATCH A CD, AND YOU MAY FIND DAMAGE  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  AUDIO VIDEO  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Two things all CD users (whether audio or computer) should know: First, not
all CDs are manufactured to the same quality standards. Cheap or shoddy
manufacturing practices result in CDs that may deteriorate. Just as there were
good- and bad-quality LPs, some companies make better CDs than others.;  
Second, you can damage a CD. From early CD hype, many people think CDs are
indestructible. Any substance applied to the label side or any scratches on
the label side will damage the data layer beneath. Contrary to what seems
obvious, the silvery side is more immune to damage than the label side. Keep
fingerprints, labels and all writing instruments away from both sides of your
discs. Store them in an environment cooler than 150 degrees Fahrenheit, and
treat them with respect. They should last a lifetime and age less than you
do.;   Q A little while ago you wrote about all the features that a video
camcorder should and should not have. Could you please run that information
again?;   A Most camcorders now have the same features. We recommend compact
8mm or VHS-C over full-size VHS. An 8x zoom is ideal. Many models now come
with 10x zoom, which amplifies jitter and body movement in small handheld
camcorders. Light sensitivity of 5 lux suffices. Many camcorders advertising
sensitivity of better than 5 lux (meaning a smaller number, such as 1 lux)
record barely viewable videos at such a low light level. Remember, even with
the best of camcorders, you'll need at least 100 lux for good-quality videos.
Any camcorder you choose should be easy to hold and easy to operate. The
high-speed shutter feature is not essential. If you desire it, two or three
shutter speeds are adequate. A real-time counter that shows either remaining
or elapsed tape time is very useful. With VHS-C camcorders, hi-fi stereo sound
is highly desirable, especially if you plan to record at the slow EP speed.
Stereo is not standard with 8mm, but the system records in hi-fi.;   Test the
autofocus while at the store. A slow or inaccurate autofocus will cause you
considerable frustration with your camcorder. Also check the zoom speed. Most
good camcorders zoom at dual speeds for greater versatility.;   When shopping,
compare look-alike brands. Panasonic and Sony manufacture camcorders for many
other companies. Often these nearly identical models from a competitor may
cost less because of varying price structures.;   Q While I was out browsing
recently, the Canon A1 Digital Hi8 camcorder caught my attention. The store
had it very attractively priced. Its myriad features amused me. I currently
own a 2-year-old full-size VHS Matsushita-built Montgomery Ward model. It
still does a good job, but can't match the features the Canon offers. I like
the convenience of using regular VHS tape. Doesn't using an 8mm camcorder to
play and rewind prerecorded tapes add to the machine's wear? My brother told
me that he heard from an electronic technician that 8mm camcorders are harder
and more costly to fix. Is this true? Should I trade my old VHS camcorder for
the new Canon?;   A Let's dispel some misconceptions first. Size, not system,
often determines repair costs. An 8mm camcorder is not inherently more
difficult to repair than any other type. However, a camcorder such as the
Canon has a lot more inside it and is much more sophisticated than your
Montgomery Ward model. You can buy a $30 tape winder (available at Radio Shack
or by mail order from ads in video magazines) to wind your tapes if you're
worried about camcorder wear. Winding tapes in any VCR, whether it be Beta,
VHS or 8mm, wears out the mechanism.;   Your Montgomery Ward model is a good,
basic camcorder. It has standard VHS resolution of 240 lines. The Canon A1
digital is a superb camcorder. Its nearly 400 line Hi8 resolution results in a
far superior picture. This Canon, one of the three most feature-laden models
on the market, performs flawlessly. The question is whether you need all these
features.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>VCR Maker Challenges MCA Buyout on Antitrust Grounds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Arizona consumer electronics firm has
filed an antitrust lawsuit to block the merger of MCA Inc. and
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., claiming they are conspiring to
sabotage sales of its videocassette recorders.
   The federal suit, filed in Phoenix, contends Matsushita's $6.6
billion purchase of MCA violates antitrust law.
   Matsushita denied the allegations in a statement that said: ``We
have only had time for a brief review of the material. However,
even on the basis of our brief review it is apparent the suit is
totally without merit.''
   The suit was filed by Go-Video Inc., a Scottsdale, Ariz.,
company which has marketed a videocassette recorder that can record
two TV programs at the same time or play one tape while recording
another.
   Talk that Matsushita needs MCA to stay competitive after
arch-rival Sony Corp. purchased Columbia Pictures Entertainment
Inc. is a smokescreen, said attorney Joseph Alioto.
   Alioto has represented Go-Video in a series of actions
contending Matsushita, Sony and other Asian companies want to shut
out all U.S. consumer electronics makers. He said he'd taken more
than 70 depositions in Japan over a three-month period that support
that allegation.
   ``We know that if you control the software, you cnntrol the
hardware. ... Except for Go-Video, they already have a monopoly in
the hardware. This is to make sure guys like us don't get in,''
Alioto said.
   He said the Japanese companies intend to use their domination of
both sides of the entertainment business to ensure that
``Go-Video's products will not play their software, and anybody
else (outside Japan) who makes HDTV won't either.''
   The primary objective of the Japanese companies is to dominate
the high-definition television market, Alioto said in a telephone
interview from San Francisco.
   Buying MCA gives Matsushita movies, television shows and
recordings to complement its consumer electronics products. By
controlling both, the company assures itself a ready supply of
programming compatible with any technological improvements that
emerge.
   The strategy was much discussed last year when Sony purchased
Columbia Pictures for $3.4 billion. Many analysts believe that
Sony's Beta format for VCRs might have prevailed over Matsushita's
VHS if Sony had owned Columbia when the Beta format first came out.
   Go-Video already is pursuing its conspiracy claim in an earlier
lawsuit against Matsushita and its Panasonic division; Victor Co.
of Japan Ltd. and its JVC Corp. subsidiary; Sanyo Electric Co.
Ltd.; Sony; and NEC Corp.
   Go-Video contends those companies, unable to develop a machine
that can compete with Go-Video's, conspired to block marketing of
it and have formed a cartel to control such products as
conventional VCRs, digital audio-tape recording equipment and
high-definition television.
   Go-Video is seeking more than $1 billion from the companies in
that action, originally filed in 1987. It settled part of the suit
out of court for $2 million. The suit originally named 14 Japanese
and South Korean companies, as well as the Motion Picture
Association of American.

FT  15 APR 94 / VCR deal averts clash on standards

<TEXT>
A costly battle over the design of the next generation of video cassette
recorders has been averted by an agreement on technical standards between
the world's leading consumer electronics companies.
The accord, reached in Tokyo yesterday by the 50 members of the HD Digital
VCR Conference, is expected to head off a standards war of the kind that
marred the introduction of analogue video recorders.
Sony had led the way with its Betamax format, but eventually had to concede
defeat to JVC, which was more successful in persuading video film suppliers
to use its VHS standard.
Mr Andrew House of Sony, acting as spokesman for the conference, said in
Tokyo that digital technology would change the VCR industry 'in the same way
that digital has changed the music business by replacing vinyl records with
compact discs'.
Other members of the HD Digital VCR Conference include Matsushita and
Toshiba of Japan, Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France. The
computer companies IBM and Apple of the US are members because digital VCRs
can be used to store computer data.
The standards are for high-definition digital VCRs, which use the binary
digits ('bits') of computer language rather than analogue signals to record
images and sounds. Digital VCRs will give greatly improved picture quality
and make for cleaner tape copies.
Industry executives believe digital VCRs could be in the shops as early as
next year. They are expected, however, to be expensive, with some estimates
putting the cost of a machine at up to Dollars 3,000 (Pounds 2,055).
The new machines will use tapes about two-thirds the size of a conventional
VHS cassette with 4 1/2 hours recording time.

Indiana Jones is always adventuring into areas where no other explorer dares to 
go, so it's fitting that "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" represented a 
video-industry first when it was released Thursday. The Steven Spielberg film 
is the first to be released simultaneously in seven versions: regular VHS, 
Beta, pan-and-scan LaserDisc, letterbox LaserDisc, Super-VHS, 8mm, and 
Spanish-subtitled VHS. 
</P>

That is especially good news for anyone who has laid out big bucks for a 
Super-VHS VCR, only to find that pre-recorded material in the improved-image 
format is almost non-existent. The news gets even better: The Super-VHS version 
of the 1989 summer blockbuster is the lowest-priced S-VHS movie-on-tape yet -- 
only $39.95 -- and it's in the letterbox configuration (wide screen, with black 
bands at top and bottom). 
</P>
<P>
"Last Crusade" is the first S-VHS release from Paramount Home Video, offering 
hope that other S-VHS tapes will be coming from this major and others in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Prices are even lower for the other versions -- $29.95 for each of the 
LaserDisc versions and $24.95 for all others. 
</P>
<P>
Harrison Ford is back as Indy, with Sean Connery on hand as his father. Also 
starring Denholm Elliott, River Phoenix, John Rhys-Davies and Alison Doody, 
"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" is MPAA-rated PG-13. 
</P>
<P>
Other new movies-on-tape: 
</P>
<P>
"High Hopes" (Academy, $89.95, not MPAA rated). Critically acclaimed 1989 
British comedy-drama from director Mike Leigh about the class system in 
Thatcher-era Britain. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fastest Guitar Alive" (MGM/UA, $19.95). Did you know that singer Roy 
Orbison starred in a Civil War drama back in 1968? He did, and here it is -- 
though this tame movie will be of interest only to curiosity seekers. 
</P>
<P>
"Eat a Bowl of Tea" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG-13). Comedy set in New York 
City's Chinatown, circa the 1940's. Directed by Wayne Wang ("Slamdance"). 
</P>
<P>
"Night Visitor" (MGM/UA, $79.95, R). No one believes a compulsive liar when he 
reports a gruesome murder. This 1989 film with Elliot Gould shouldn't be 
confused with 1970's "The Night Visitor," which starred Max von Sydow and Liv 
Ullmann. 
</P>
<P>
"Time Trackers" (MGM/UA, $79.95, PG). Weak time-travel comedy that gets waylaid 
in medieval England too long. Ned Beatty, Kathleen Beller. 
</P>
<P>
"Another Chance" (Republic, $89.95, R). Obscure 1988 romantic comedy with Bruce 
Greenwood, Vanessa Angel and Anne Ramsey about a playboy who suddenly has to be 
faithful to one woman. 
</P>
<P>
"Jesse James Rides Again" and "G-Men vs. the Black Dragon" (Republic, $29.95 
each). Two double-cassette packages compiling 1940s serials. 
</P>
<P>
NEXT WEEK: "Lethal Weapon 2" and "Wired" (both Wednesday). 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
They're baa-ack. Those masters of mayhem, the Three Stooges, wreak havoc in six 
more videos containing three shorts each. Volumes 27 through 31 feature Larry, 
Moe and Curly; Volumes 26 and 31 have Larry, Moe and Shemp. The tapes are 
$14.95 each from RCA/Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Another sort of mayhem is on view in "Rolling Stone Presents 20 Years of Rock 
&amp; Roll" (MGM/UA, $19.95), a 97-minute retrospective featuring performers 
ranging from the Beatles to Madonna. TERRY ATKINSON

   TOKYO -- Sony Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
-- longtime enemies in the home videotape wars -- said they
will work together to develop a next-generation machine.
   The two Japanese consumer electronics giants, joined by
Hitachi Ltd., said they have agreed on common specifications
for a videocassette recorder compatible with high-definition
television sets. The companies said in a statement they "will
now work together to introduce this format to domestic and
overseas industries."
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The companies didn't say when such products might become
available. High-definition television sets -- which offer
crisper pictures and sound than today's standard televisions
-- are already on sale in Japan, and regular commercial
broadcasting is expected to begin later this year.
   The agreement is ironic because Sony and Matsushita have
been major protagonists in a bitter decade-long battle for
the shape of commercial video technology.
   Matsushita-endorsed VHS prevailed over Sony's Betamax in
the first generation of home video machines. Sony is now
pushing its compact 8mm tapes as a better format than VHS for
personal video recording.
   "The three companies had each been conducting their own
research but have combined their latest technologies," the
statement said.

FT  10 JUL 92 / Fight for the consumer's ear: The two different formats
seeking to replace tape recorders are in fierce competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The world's biggest consumer electronics companies are bracing for battle.
The prize is the lucrative market for the next generation of portable music
players. For the protagonists, Sony on the one side, Philips and Matsushita
on the other, victory could determine whether they consolidate, or slip
from, their positions at the top of the industry during the 1990s.
The mega-contest centres on mini-products: Sony's MiniDisc, and the Digital
Compact Cassette which has been co-developed by Philips and Matsushita. The
MiniDisc, a small recordable disc, will be launched by the end of this year.
The digital compact cassette will reach the high street sooner - by the end
of September - thus gaining an important head start over its rival.
In both cases, the new products are aimed at replacing the traditional tape
recorder and tape cassettes, for decades the dominant portable music system,
but now facing decline. Sales of prerecorded cassette tapes, which peaked in
1989 at about 780m units, last year amounted to just 638m units. Industry
analysts expect a further decline this year.
Consumer electronics companies believe that the market for portable audio
equipment - 'ghetto blaster' tape recorders, Walkmans, car stereos and other
portable audio equipment - is also at risk. They fear that the market, which
is worth nearly Dollars 10bn in the leading industrialised countries alone,
according to BIS Strategic Decisions, the high-technology consultancy group,
will follow the downward path of cassette tapes.
Industry executives draw a parallel with the LP, which started to decline in
sales from about 1978, even before CDs were introduced by Sony and Philips
in 1982. 'The LP had become old-fashioned,' says Mr Gerry Wirtz, senior
product manager at Philips in charge of DCC.
Sony is particularly worried that the declining popularity of cassettes
threatens sales of the Walkman, the portable cassette tape recorder which
has revolutionised music-listening habits since its introduction in late
1979.
'The Walkman is 12 years old and 100m units have been shipped already,' says
Mr Norio Ohga, president of Sony. 'We must think seriously of replacing the
Walkman.'
While Philips executives agree with Mr Ohga that the days of traditional
tapes and tape recorders are numbered, the two companies differ over the
reasons for their decline and how they should be replaced.
Philips is firmly committed to the tape format for portable audio. It claims
its studies show that people who like to carry their music around with them
prefer to do so on tapes, rather than discs. CDs are perceived as vulnerable
to physical shocks and therefore not an appropriate medium for portable
equipment, says Mr Wirtz.
The Dutch group believes the main reason consumers have lost interest in
cassettes is because they do not provide the crisp, clear sound of digital
CDs. It also assumes that, while consumers want something better than
cassette tapes, they will not be willing to throw away the tape collections
they have accumulated over the years. As a result, DCC players have been
designed to play the old analogue cassettes as well as the new digital ones.
Sony takes a very different view of the development of the portable audio
electronics market. It sees the declining interest in cassette tapes largely
as the result of consumers' disenchantment with tapes as a medium.
'Tape is a 30-year-old format,' says Mr Eric Kingdon, technical managing
director of Sony UK. 'Putting the word 'digital' in front of tapes is not
going to stir a market that is losing momentum.'
Consumers, according to Sony, want digital sound, but they also want random
access - the ability to find the beginning of a certain track without having
to wind a tape forwards or backwards. Discs can provide this feature,
cassettes cannot.
'The main reason why cassettes have fallen in sales is because they lack
this feature,' says Mr Ohga. 'DCC is not the right medium to address the
demands of consumers.'
Sony says that it is not particularly concerned by the fact that consumers
will have to throw away their old cassettes, or continue to use two formats
if they switch to MiniDisc. The company points out that CD players could not
play vinyl discs, and that did not prevent them from replacing record
players. Similarly, the 8mm video format is not compatible with VCRs but it
is still the dominant camcorder system.
As with CDs and video cameras, the problem facing Sony and Philips is that
there is likely to be only one winner in the battle between the MiniDisc and
DCC. Few in the industry believe the market is big enough to sustain two
competing formats. 'I don't think co-existence is possible,' Mr Ohga states
unequivocally.
For both companies, the stakes are raised even higher by the business
difficulties they currently face. Philips is in the middle of a group-wide
restructuring programme aimed at slimming operations and raising efficiency
and profitability. While the Dutch group did return to profit in 1991, it
has continued to suffer from weak consumer demand. Last month it warned that
a deepening crisis in the consumer electronics market could reduce profits
for the full year below last year's figure. Shares fell by almost 20 per
cent on the day of the announcement.
Sony is also facing problems. Last year, operating profits from its
worldwide consumer electronics business fell sharply to Y113bn (Pounds 481m)
from Y249bn. The parent company in Japan suffered its first operating loss
since 1958, falling Y20.5bn into the red, compared with a profit of Y72.2bn
in 1990.
It has also suffered the humiliation of seeing Betacam, its VCR format,
driven out of the world's main markets by the VHS system developed by JVC, a
Japanese manufacturer of audio-visual products. Sony's Digital Audio Tape, a
pioneering digital tape format, has also proved a commercial failure.
Both companies are therefore in pressing need of a new hit product. The
introduction of a successful heir to the cassette tape recorder presents the
perfect opportunity to achieve their objectives of boosting income and
establishing control in a new product area.
In terms of technology the two systems are fairly well matched. Both produce
high-quality, digitally recorded sound, and while Philips' DCC will be able
to play old analogue cassettes it will not record on them. Nor will the new
tapes be playable on conventional tape machines. Similarly, while the
MiniDisc player offers random access it will not play any other format and
MiniDiscs themselves cannot be played on CD players.
The deciding factors in the contest are therefore expected to be the extent
to which Philips and Sony succeed in signing up software suppliers - in
particular the large record labels - and in licensing their technologies to
hardware manufacturers.
As demonstrated in the 1980s by the competition between the two rival video
systems - VHS and Betamax - the success of a new format depends crucially on
how much software is available to be played on it. Licensing technology to a
wide range of hardware manufacturers is also vital to ensure that a format
becomes the dominant system in a particular market.
In both respects, Philips appears to have a slight edge. It has put together
an impressive marketing and publicity machine through which it has managed
to convince the big hardware manufacturers, many of which are Japanese, to
license its technology and bring their own DCC machines to the market.
Matsushita, a co-licensor of the DCC technology, has already announced plans
to bring out its players by Christmas.
Philips has also won agreements from leading record producers, including
even Sony Music, to bring out hit songs on DCC. Artists whose music will be
available on DCC include Bryan Adams, U2, Elton John and the Fine Young
Cannibals.
What is keeping many record companies from signing up for MiniDisc is their
fear that it is likely to prove more damaging than digital cassettes to
sales of CDs. Their argument is that if consumers like MiniDiscs, they may
replace their CD collections with the smaller discs. On the other hand, they
believe, the DCC tapes are sufficiently different from CDs to form a
separate market.
Mindful of protecting the CD market, which has seen worldwide sales rise
steadily to 900m units last year from about 738m units in 1990, many record
companies are therefore leaning towards the Philips format.
As a result, Sony is looking somewhat lonely with its list of supporters.
The main record companies such as Time Warner and PolyGram, which is 80 per
cent owned by Philips, are conspicuously absent.
Unless Sony can win over the record companies in time for the launch of
MiniDisc, it will be facing a formidable opponent in the marketplace with
little more ammunition than a conviction that the consumer will fall for its
vision of the portable market. The Japanese company's convictions have often
proved right in the past; the Walkman and the Handycam video camera are the
most noteable examples. But winning the consumer over in the current fray is
likely to be more difficult.
One reason, in addition to the strong competition from Philips, is the
confusion faced by potential buyers. People who replace their cassette tape
players will not know for several years how long their chosen format will
survive. Those who choose wrongly may have to invest in another system
within a couple of years.
Both Philips and Sony claim that they have done their best to achieve a
smooth transition to thereplacement for cassette tapes. Each side blames the
other for rocking the boat and for failing to collaborate on technologies to
replace the tape machine. But neither has been willing to bend its position
to avoid burdening consumers with the uncertainty of competing formats.
Ironically, the consumer may well think it best to sit tight until a victor
emerges from the fray. If that happens, the battle to replace the humble
tape recorder may in fact extend its lease of life.

FT  15 APR 94 / Electronics giants reach accord on digital VCR design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE

<DATELINE>
   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A costly battle over the design of the next generation of video cassette
recorders has been averted by an agreement on technical standards between
the world's leading consumer electronics companies.
The accord, reached in Tokyo yesterday by the 50 members of the HD Digital
Conference, is expected to avert a standards war of the kind that marred the
introduction of analogue video recorders.
Sony had led the way with its technically superior Betamax format but
eventually - in what was an expensive failure - had to concede defeat to
JVC, which was more successful in persuading video film suppliers to use its
VHS standard.
Mr Andrew House of Sony, acting as spokesman for the companies, said in
Tokyo that digital technology would change the VCR industry 'in the same way
that digital has changed the music business by replacing vinyl records with
compact discs'.
Other members of the HD Digital VCR Conference include Matsushita and
Toshiba of Japan, Philips of the Netherlands and Thomson of France. The
computer companies IBM and Apple of the US are members because digital VCRs
can be used to store computer data.
The standards are for high-definition digital VCRs, which use the binary
digits ('bits') of computer language rather than analogue signals to record
images and sounds. Digital VCRs will give greatly improved picture quality
and make for cleaner tape copies.
Industry executives believe digital VCRs could be in the shops as early as
next year. They are expected, however, to be expensive, with some estimates
putting the cost of a machine at up to Dollars 3,000.
Digital VCRs have been used by professionals for some time, but until
recently were too large for domestic use. The new machines will use tapes
about two-thirds the size of a conventional VHS cassette with 4.5 hours
recording time. Smaller versions will be possible.
VCR manufacturers have been encouraged to agree a standard among themselves
because the costs and risks of taking the wrong development path are
increasing. Manufacturers feel they should be able to develop products safe
in the knowledge that they will not be wrong-footed by the success of a
competitor's technology.
Consumers, equally, should be able to buy the new machines with the
confidence that they will not be left with obsolescent products if another
technology captures the market.
The agreement covers standards for VCRs used with conventional televisions
and for Japan's high-definition television system. The conference said
standards for a future HDTV system now being developed in the US should be
ready by the end of the year.

<TEXT>     A Mike Piehl, marketing manager for compact disc players at Magnavox, says
his company offers a single disc tray (item No. SBC3591) as an option for your
unit. It sells for $20. Once this is installed, you can use any laser lens
cleaner available in audio stores.;    However, Piehl adds he typically does
not recommend that customers repair or clean the lenses themselves. If your
discs are skipping, first clean the disc. If the skipping persists, take the
unit to a factory-authorized service center for repair.;    Also, if you have
compact discs that are badly scratched, you might want to check out Memorex's
new Compact Disc Repair and Maintenance Kit. It includes 12 packets of repair
polish and cleaning fluid that work with an ultra-fine, abrasive paper
(similar to sandpaper) that cleans and restores scratched discs.;    Each kit
can restore up to 24 CDs and sells for $15. It is available from J &amp; R Music
World, (800) 221-8180.;    Q I am looking for a timing device similar to a
parking meter that I could attach to a television.;    My plan is to use this
gadget to take tokens (quarters) and thereby place a cost incentive on the
time my children spend watching television. This device could be mechanical or
electronic. If something like that is not available, I would be happy to find
a unit that monitors the amount of time that the television is on. Any ideas?;
   A Although I have yet to find a parking-meter-type gadget for the
television, last summer, I wrote about a child-proof power lock called The
Switch ($20). It attaches to a television's power cord and requires a key to
turn the TV on or off. For more information on The Switch, call (800)
535-5845.;    Q I take exception to your article on the VHS-C video cameras
and tapes. You wrote that "VHS-C tapes can only record 30 minutes." Wrong! I
own a VHS-C camera, and a T-20 tape will record up to one hour on the super
long play mode. The new tapes, T-30s, will record either 30 minutes on
standard play or 90 minutes on SLP.;    To me, the biggest advantage of VHS-C
is: If I'm going to show people my vacation video, I'm not going to bore them
for a full two hours!;    A When preparing that story, I decided to compare
apples to apples and look at both formats at the full-speed, highest quality
mode.;    The quality of the two-hour 8mm and the quality of the 30-minute
VHS-C are similar at the full-speed mode. However, if you would like, I can
compare the two-hour 8mm to the 90-minute VHS-C (30-minute tape at the slower
speed) and show the superlative quality of the 8mm tape.;    The biggest
advantage to the VHS-C tape is that, with an adapter, it can easily play back
in the home VHS deck. With 8mm, you have to run a cable from the camera to a
VCR or television for playback.;    As for boring your audience, the only
thing I can say is that with 8mm, you have the choice of how long you can
record. And please be aware that 8mm tape is available in shorter lengths also.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Sony Introduces First Hi-Band 8mm Video Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Sony Corp. on Wednesday announced video
equipment that uses 8-millimeter tape but has the same sharpness as
the bigger Super VHS format.
   Sony said the new EV-S900 video tape recorder will be priced
$1,850 and the CCD-V900 combined camera-recorder at $1,880. Both
will be available in Japan in April and in the United States in May
or June, it said. Release in Europe is planned for later in the year.
   As with Super VHS, new 8mm Hi-Band equipment can record and play
back older 8mm tapes, but without an improvement in picture quality.
However, old equipment cannot play tapes made with the new systems.
   The 8mm Hi-Band equipment uses tapes made with a newly developed
process. The tapes will have a list price of $21 for a 120-minute
tape, or about twice the price of current 8mm tapes, Sony said.
   The 8mm video standard is widely used for home video cameras. The
system has been less popular as a home recording and playback
format, with only about 500 pre-recorded titles currently available,
Sony officials said.

<LEADPARA>  WHEN it comes to camcorders, it's risky for any company to advertise a given
model as the smallest and lightest on the market. No sooner is that claim made
than a rival company is insisting it has an even tinier model.;   So let's not
say that Sony's new CCD-TR51 is the smallest you can find. But it certainly is
the smallest in Sony's "TR" line of subcompact 8mm camcorders. Designers have
shaved down the camera body until it measures 4 1/4 inches wide by 4 inches
high by 6 5/8 inches deep. It's about the size of a 35mm still camera.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  FOR CAMCORDER FANS, SMALLER IS BETTER  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  VIDEO  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     More dramatic is the weight reduction. The earlier TRs weighed 1.7 pounds
without battery and cassette. That's extremely light, but the new model is a
real featherweight at just 1.3 pounds.;   The arrival of the TR51 (about
$1,000) is further evidence that the majority of video shoppers are forsaking
the old idea that bigger is better.;   Goodbye to bulk; For years, the
comparatively bulky VHS camcorders dominated sales. They had the look of
heavy-duty equipment, so serious in purpose that their operators could be
mistaken for TV news crews.;   In comparison, the mini-camcorders that used
8mm and Compact VHS tape appeared toylike, with tiny lenses and control
buttons. Buyers wondered how these baby camcorders could possibly perform as
well as heftier models.;   At first, some of them couldn't. Engineers made the
mistake of making designs too basic. But in the last few years, progress in
miniaturization has brought all the most popular features to the compact
camcorder, and the consumer has responded decisively: Small is indeed
beautiful.;   Consider the latest statistics from the Electronic Industries
Association, which tracks such things. In July 1990, total camcorder sales
were split about evenly between full-size VHS models and the two mini-formats
(8mm and Compact VHS). In July 1991, full-size camcorders fell to about 31
percent while 8mm and Compact VHS shared in 69 percent of sales. In fact, for
the last four months, sales of compact formats garnered 70 percent of sales.; 
 Sony, which expects to sell more than 4 million camcorders this year, can
take much of the credit for the turnaround, and the TR51 is a good example of
why. Despite its size, it still can offer hi-fi stereo recording, a variable
high-speed shutter (six settings), 6:1 power zoom, "world clock" time/date

FT  16 FEB 93 / Sony and Matsushita discuss digital video recorder format

JAPANESE consumer electronics companies, led by Matsushita and Sony, are in
talks aimed at agreeing a common standard for the next generation of video
tape recorders, digital VTRs, which record films from televisions or
camcorders in computer language.
Unlike the current generation of analogue VTRs, in which picture quality
falls off sharply when copies are made, digital VTRs offer the prospect of
virtually perfect pictures no matter how many copies are made.
The discussions, which involve two of the fiercest rivals in the consumer
electronics industry, represents a concerted effort by Japanese
manufacturers to prevent a damaging standards war in an area which they
believe will be important in stimulating consumer demand for new electronics
products.
The talks are a strong indication that with consumer demand for new
electronics products at a low point - and after both Sony and Matsushita
have made expensive purchases of Hollywood studios - the industry recognises
it can no longer afford to fight costly format wars which only confuse
consumers and could be financially crippling for the loser.
'We would like to pursue the establishment of a single format in order to
gain the support of a wide range of foreign and domestic manufacturers and
thereby facilitate the digital VTR's diffusion among consumers,' Matsushita
said.
Matsushita and Sony are currently competing with different formats for
digital portable music. Matsushita has backed a digital tape format called
DCC, which it co-developed with Philips, the Dutch consumer electronics
group, while Sony has launched MiniDisc, which is like a miniature CD.
The two rivals are also locked in competition over the camcorder market, for
which they have backed two incompatible formats. Sony has an 8mm format
while Matsushita manufactures camcorders in the VHS-C format.
The rivalry between Matsushita and Sony reached a peak in the 1980s when the
two fought over the market for video tape recorders with different formats.
The defeat, on the consumer market, of Sony's Beta format, was a big blow,
not only financially, but perhaps more significantly to the company's
reputation.

   Matsushita, Pitting Itself Against Sony,
   Agrees to Back Philips's Digital Cassettes

   TOKYO -- Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. threw its
considerable weight behind Philips Electronics N.V. in the
battle with Sony Corp. to shape the future consumer audio
market.
   Matsushita said it would help develop and produce
Philips-designed digital compact cassettes -- a product
similar to the common cassette tape but which can record and
play a much higher quality sound.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   "We decided to support the digital compact cassette
because it seems the most promising successor of the
cassette," a Matsushita spokesman said. He wouldn't say when
the technology will hit the market, but Philips has said it
plans to introduce a product in 1992. Matsushita, the giant
consumer electronics company, sells products under the
National, Panasonic, Technics and Quasar brands.
   The Matsushita decision had been expected in the industry,
but company officials refused to confirm such plans until
last week. The announcement comes less than two months after
Sony made its own claim that it had developed a replacement
for the conventional cassette -- the Mini Disc, a small
compact disk that can record as well as play sound, expected
to go on sale by the end of next year.
   Matsushita's move seems to further damp the future of the
digital-audio tape, or DAT, another technology once hailed
industrywide as the next-generation cassette. The
digital-audio tape got bogged down in battles with the
recording industry, which was worried that the
superior-sounding equipment would trigger a wave of bootleg
copies.
   Matsushita, as well as Sony, has invested heavily in the
digital-audio tape technology, but now "we think DAT is for
high-end professional audio, while digital compact cassettes
are for consumer use," the Matsushita spokesman said. Digital
compact cassette players can play regular cassettes, while
DAT players cannot.
   The key characteristic of all three technologies --
Philips's digital compact cassette, Sony's Mini Disc, and DAT
-- is that they record and play sound digitally, which is a
clearer, more efficient method than the analog format used on
conventional tapes. The improved method offers the same sound
enhancement that compact disks provide over records; the
industry consensus is that technology and demand will lead to
the same transition in tapes.
   But the companies differ over exactly what format
consumers will prefer. Sony's Mini Disc allows users to
access quickly any song, just like a compact disk player. But
it requires users to buy new equipment and disks. Digital
compact cassettes require the cumbersome rewinding and
fastforwarding of tapes, but they won't require consumers to
replace their existing tape libraries.
   "We believe both formats can exist in the market," a Sony
spokeswoman said.
   But some analysts and industry officials argue that one
approach will ultimately become dominant -- and Matsushita's
endorsement helps the digital compact cassette. Although Sony
is considered more innovative than Matsushita, it doesn't
have the same clout to set industry standards. Indeed,
Matsushita's support in the early 1980s for the VHS
video-tape format was a key factor in the demise of Sony's
competing Betamax format.
   "This is a major positive for Philips and the digital
compact cassette," said Jeffrey Zavattero, a consumer
electronics analyst in Tokyo for Jardine Fleming Securities
Ltd. "It's a major negative for Sony, the Mini Disc and DAT."

<TEXT>     The Orion "Extended-Play Promotion" comprises six recent titles: "Bull
Durham," "Throw Momma From the Train," "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels," "Married to
the Mob," "Frog" and "The Couch Trip.";    While videophiles say the faster,
standard-speed (SP) videocassettes are better in quality, Orion spokesman Paul
Wagner denied there was a quality difference.;    Although playback of the EP
tapes may require an adjustment to the VCR's tracking dial, "there will be no
significant loss of quality in the EP mode," Wagner said.;    But Andy Delle,
chief engineer at the Varitel Video post-production facility in Los Angeles,
said: "There's no question that, regardless of the equipment you play it on, a
film recorded at EP will be of significantly lower (visual) quality than one
recorded at SP.";    The EP mode generally is used by VCR owners to record
programming off television, although it has been used in some low-budget,
public-domain video offerings. (The popular 120 VHS blank tape plays for two
hours in the SP setting and six hours in the EP mode.);    EP product stickers
will carry the message: "Recorded in EP mode, minor tracking adjustments may
be desired.";    The six titles in the Orion promotion will remain available
at standard speed, Orion said.;    Q When will the video companies release
more movies on Super VHS?;    A There are still too few people who own Super
VHS VCRs to interest the studios in the format, and the situation won't change
soon. Although S-VHS has been around since 1987, fewer than 30 movies are
available. The latest is "Misery," coming July 11 at $39.95. For a complete
list, write to Super Source Video, Box 410777, San Francisco 94141, or call
(800) 331-6304.;    Q When I copy a tape from my camcorder the quality
deteriorates considerably. Would a signal booster or anything else improve the
quality?;    A Generally, the first copy from an original sacrifices about 10
percent of the picture clarity. Video enhancers, available from many
manufacturers at many prices, can reduce but not eliminate the loss.;    If
possible, experiment with one on approval before you buy it, or patronize a
store that allows returns.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  Japanese electronics giant JVC has developed a VHS video cassette recorder
with digital sound that can match or surpass the quality of compact discs --
but consumers outside Japan will have to wait.;   JVC said today it will begin
selling the HR-Z1, the world's first consumer VHS machine with digital sound,
in Japan in December for about $2,250. But officials said they have no plans
for sales overseas.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     'It's rather expensive'; "It's still rather expensive, and our subsidiaries
in other countries said they weren't interested until the price comes down,"
said Tasuku Tachi, general manager for engineering in JVC's Video Products
Division.;   In a presentation today, the VCR demonstrated the benefits of
digital sound recording -- absolute silence in quiet portions, superb dynamic
range and no audible distortion.;   Tachi said JVC decided to develop the
machine because of the growing availability of high-quality audio and video
sources, such as satellite broadcasting in Japan.;   Offers satellite tuner;
The machine includes a built-in satellite tuner. Two Japanese networks use
satellites to broadcast television programs with digital sound, which the new
VCRs can record directly, guaranteeing a virtually perfect recording.;  
However, direct digital recordings from compact discs will not be possible,
since CDs sample sound at 44,100 times per second, while digital VHS offers a
choice of 32,000 or 48,000 times.;   Digital audio tape recorders can record
at all three sampling rates, but contain a circuit called a serial copy
management system that blocks them from making digital copies from other
copies to prevent record piracy.;   "We see this as primarily a video system
rather than an audio system, so at the present time we don't plan to include
any copy management system," Tachi said.  </TEXT>

<LEADPARA>  A war is shaping up in the music industry, and the battleground is the

<HEADLINE>  WAR'S BREWING -- ON THE MUSIC FRONT
BATTLE SEEN OVER COMPETING DIGITAL TAPES  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     In one camp are several Japanese companies, including Sony Corp., which
began selling digital audiotape products in this country last year. DATs are
about half the size of conventional cassettes but far more expensive.;    The
new contender is N.V. Philips, the Dutch electronics maker, which unveiled a
technology Wednesday it calls the digital compact cassette.;    Unlike the
Japanese DAT players, Philips says machines using its technology will be able
to play today's cassettes as well as the new digital tapes.;    "With the
average household already owning between 50 and 60 music cassettes, this
compatibility is seen as a major factor in the successful introduction of
DCC," Philips said in a statement.;    However, the Philips machines won't be
able to play the Japanese DATs. That means the rivalry could end up a replay
of the videotape war of the 1980s in which the VHS tape format beat out Sony's
Beta standard, leaving millions of consumers with virtually obsolete Beta
tapes and videocassette recorders.;    "What this means for the market is
confusion," said Ivan Berger, technical editor of Audio magazine. "This has
become a very interesting time for the home recording industry because there
are all of these things unsettled.";    Philips says its tape players should
cost $500 to $600 when they are introduced next year -- far less than the
Japanese DAT models, which carry a list price of up to about $1,000.;   
However, industry experts say the price of DAT machines may have dropped
steeply by that point, if the price drops seen in other electronics products
such as VCRs and compact disc players are a guide.;    Both the Japanese and
the Philips technologies record music in digital format, the computer language
used by compact discs, eliminating the background hiss and other distortions
of conventional tape.;    Philips, which invented the cassette tape and the
compact disc, has joined with Tandy Corp., the Fort Worth, Texas-based owner
of the Radio Shack chain, to develop DCC. Although the two companies said in
October they were working on the technology, they waited until Wednesday to
display it at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the semiannual
showcase for the home electronics industry.;    Tandy says it will make tape
players and blank cassettes at its U.S. plants for sale at Radio Shack stores
and elsewhere. Philips, which makes electronics products under the Magnavox,
Sylvania, Norelco and Philips brands, also will sell home, car and portable
tape players using the technology.;    In addition, Philips says it will
license the technology to other companies and is in advanced discussions with
several Japanese electronics companies, but it would not identify them.;   
"Just as we did with compact disc, we expect the DCC standard will become the
new worldwide standard for this medium," said Wim Wielens, managing director
of Philips' worldwide audio business.;    However, Philips and Tandy deny they
are trying to depose DAT. They say they envision DCC machines appealing to the
mass consumer market, while DAT machines will be favored by audiophiles and
music industry professionals.;    That's due in part to the fact that the DCC
machines will play conventional cassettes, but also is a recognition that DAT
machines already are entrenched in the professional and high-end audio market,
Berger said.;    In addition, DAT machines should continue to appeal to
professionals because they make an exact copy of a digital source, such as a
compact disc, he said. DCC copies do not include all the digital information
from the source, though Philips says the change is not noticeable to the
listener.;    Berger said the ultimate success of the two technologies may be
determined by the recording industry as it decides which formats to use.
Without a substantial number of titles available in the DCC format, the
technology could face an uphill climb.;    Already, a number of major record
companies, including Warner, BMG, EMI and PolyGram -- which is partially owned
by Philips -- have said they are interested in the DCC format, while not
ruling out DAT.;    Sony had no comment on the Philips technology "since none
of us has seen it," said Shari Haber, a spokeswoman for Sony Corp. of
America.;    Like DAT, the DCC technology will limit the ability of consumers
to make copies -- a safeguard demanded by the music industry, which feared it
would lose sales of compact discs. The copy protection technology allows users
to tape a CD, but not to make a copy of that tape.;    Debate over copy
protection delayed the U.S. introduction of DAT machines for almost four years.  </TEXT>

HOME TECH: SUPER VHS RECORDERS NOW HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS CHEAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY ATKINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's good news for anyone who's thinking about buying a Super VHS 
videocassette recorder: Prices are coming down at last. 
</P>
<P>
Ever since they were introduced two years ago, improved-picture S-VHS decks 
listed for $1,100 up and could seldom be found even at discount stores for less 
than $1,000. But in recent weeks, some Los Angeles-area stores have offered new 
models by JVC, Magnavox and others for hundreds less. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point: Magnavox's Model VR9668. Though it doesn't boast every bell and 
whistle (no audio dubbing, for example), this VCR has Super VHS, hi-fi stereo 
sound, MTS decoding, HQ circuitry, indexing and bar-code programming. Like all 
S-VHS decks, it will play and record normal VHS tapes as well. The price around 
town on a recent check -- $749 at Circuit City, $729 at Adray's and $595 at 
Star Club in Culver City. (Star Club also had JVC's S-VHS 5000U, which does 
have audio dubbing, for $700.) 
</P>
<P>
That's not much more than normal VHS decks with all of those features except 
S-VHS. If prices continue to fall and enough buyers say, "Why not?," we may 
begin to see the fall of Super VHS acceptance's other main obstacle -- the lack 
of pre-recorded material. 
</P>
<P>
The release this week of "The Best of Gilda Radner" (Warner, $19.98) isn't a 
rushed response to the comedian's death from cancer May 20. Warner Home Video 
announced the tape two months ago. The 59-minute compilation of clips from 
"Saturday Night Live" follows similar packages spotlighting John Belushi and 
Dan Aykroyd. It features Radner's most famous characterizations, including 
nerdy teen Lisa Loopner and befuddled consumerist Roseanne Roseannadanna. 
</P>
<P>
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
"Bird" (Warner, $89.95, R) didn't make Clint Eastwood's day at the box office. 
Of course, the former mayor of Carmel only directed this filmography of 
saxophonist Charlie (Yardbird) Parker -- he doesn't appear in it. Still, the 
low gross -- just over $2 million -- proved disappointing to jazz fans, 
especially after the success of "Round Midnight" in 1986. However, the poor 
showing at theaters may be followed by jazzed-up video interest; the film 
received several good reviews. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" (Orion, $89.98, PG) scored big at 
the box office and probably will with summer-fun-minded renters too. The remake 
of the 1964 comedy "Bedtime Story" places Steve Martin and Michael Caine in the 
con-men roles originally played by Marlon Brando and David Niven. 
</P>
<P>
The winner of the 1988 Academy Award for best foreign film, "Pelle the 
Conqueror" (HBO, $89.99, not MPAA rated), stars Max Von Sydow in a bleak look 
at life on a Danish farm. "Torch Song Trilogy" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R) is the 
widely panned film version of Harvey Fierstein's play. "Tapeheads" (Pacific 
Arts, $89.95, R) stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins in a satiric comedy a la 
"Spinal Tap" about two security guards who want to make rock videos. 
</P>
<P>
Also out on video this week: "Buster" (HBO, $89.99, R), "Travelling North" 
(Virgin, $79.95, PG-13), "Eye of the Eagle II" (MGM/UA, $79.95, R), "Cohen and 
Tate" (Nelson, $89.98, R) and "Saturday the 14th Strikes Back" (MGM/UA, $79.95, 
PG). 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
Like your music video classical or non-classical? 
</P>
<P>
If classical, then there's "Manon" (with Beverly Sills, 1977), "James Galway 
Plays Mostly Mozart" (1982) and "Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman" 
(1980) from Bel Canto's "Live from Lincoln Center" series ($29.95 each). 
</P>
<P>
If non-classical, there's a new tape by the kings of speed-metal, "Metallica: 2 
of One" (Elektra, $9.98), containing two versions of the song "One," an 
eight-minute conceptual video and a five-minute performance. And coinciding 
with the new rock filmography "Great Balls of Fire" is the hourlong concert 
film/documentary "Jerry Lee Lewis: I Am What I Am" (J2, $19.95). TERRY ATKINSON

Home-Electronics Show Offers Promise
Of Lower Prices as Competition Heats Up

   When the Consumer Electronics Show opens tomorrow in Las Vegas, Nev., the spotlight will no doubt shine on pricey new versions of such products as stereo television sets and portable compact-disk players, which manufacturers hope will bring them big sales this year. 

   But the real winner in the wake of the four-day show, which is expected to attract 100,000 dealers, manufacturers and distributors, could be the consumer. 
Amid frenetic competition among manufacturers and the swelling ranks of retailers, items with some of the latest bells and whistles are likely to become more affordable. 

   "The consumers will win on this deal," predicts George Jones, a senior vice president of Dayton Hudson Corp.'s Target discount-store chain. 
"They're going to win on compact-disk players, IBM (computer) clones and camcorders," which combine a camera and videocassette recorder in a single unit. 

   Competition is expected to heat up in 1987 as growth slows in the industry. 
Last year, the value of factory sales increased by at least 10% to more than $28 billion, according to preliminary estimates by the Electronic Industry Association. 
For this year, the trade group foresees a rise of less than 7%. 

   In addition, the emergence of aggressive South Korean competitors and the significant strengthening of the yen against the dollar may force Japanese electronics companies to take steps favorable for consumers, says Vern Brisson, general manager, distribution, of the U.S. unit of Sharp Corp. 
"The competition is getting keen from the Koreans, and the Japanese don't want to lose market share without a fight," he explains. 
"One way to do that is not to raise your prices and add benefits to your product line." 

   Some companies have already done this. 
For example, picture-enhancing circuitry once found only in VCRs priced $500 and up is now standard on many less expensive machines. 
"The video market moves so blasted fast that we have had several VCRs that haven't gotten into our catalogs because they were superseded by lower prices or more features or a combination of both," says Ed Juge, market-planning director for Tandy Corp., the operator of Radio Shack stores. 

   Of course, exhibitors at the electronics show will unveil plenty of new gizmos. 
Sharp, for example, is introducing a VCR for people who tend to fall asleep while viewing: At the end of the tape, the machine automatically turns down the sound and replaces the harsh black-and-white lines on the screen with a wave of blue. 
Also, there will be more variations on the boom box, or portable stereo system, including a number of compact-disk machines and a box from Lloyds Electronics Corp. replete with a second amplifier that can be switched on for extra sound. 

   There's also a hint of apprehension surrounding the show. 
Industry officials are anxious about the introduction of digital audiotape -- or DAT -- recorders by several manufacturers. 
DAT units, which reproduce sound more accurately than conventional, analog machines, are apparently so good that many vendors fear they could cripple the booming sales of compact-disk players. 
Another product has the movie industry worried: Go-Video Inc. of Scottsdale, Ariz., is expected to show a VCR that allows users to record a videocassette onto a blank tape within the same unit. 

   Meanwhile, mass merchandisers are on the prowl for lower-priced products. 
P.R. Gullet, an electronics buyer with K mart Corp., is looking for stereo color televisions -- which typically retail for $600 or more -- that he can sell to his customers for around $400. 
"Enough numbers are being built that the companies can get it down to the mass merchants," he says. 

   And in fact, some manufacturers may have what he wants. 
For example, Lloyds Electronics, which sells to many discount chains, plans to introduce a stereo color set that will probably sell in discount stores for between $399 and $449. 
The model, styled to resemble a professional studio monitor, includes such features as on-screen digital channel and timer displays. 
Lloyds also plans to include a coupon for free stereo speakers for the new TV. 
"It wasn't long ago that a regular 19-inch color TV set was in the mid-$300 (range) anyway," says Randy Marx, the company's president. 

   As prices continue to decline, stereo TV sets could even become the hottest-selling product in 1987. 
The Electronic Industry Association figures that as many as 30% of the color TV sets sold in the U.S. this year will have the stereo-sound feature. 
Such units accounted for about 17% of the 18 million color sets sold here last year, and only 8.9% of the nearly 17 million sets sold in 1985. 

   Mass merchants also are searching for VCRs with the stereo feature. 
While most stereo units are still in the $600-and-up range, Samsung Electronics America Inc. is unveiling one at the show that will retail for about $460. 
The South Korean-made machine, which Samsung believes will fill the gap between the less expensive machines and the high-priced stereo models, is "stereo-capable" -- that is, it can play back stereo videotapes but can't record in stereo. 

   Target's Mr. Jones and other mass merchants are hoping as well to find less expensive camcorders at the show that are both smaller and have such features as autofocusing. 
Target has already had "a moderate degree of success" selling a JVC camcorder priced at $1,399, a lot more than most of the chain's customers can afford to pay, Mr. Jones says. 
"The potential is there to sell a lot" of cheaper camcorders, he adds. 

   Retailers believe, too, that camcorder prices will decline as manufacturers scramble to introduce new souped-up models, many of which have appeared in a variety of formats. 
Many companies, such as JVC, have stuck to the commonly used VHS format, while Sony Corp. of America has been marketing models that take smaller, 8-millimeter cassettes. 

   Samsung plans to market a machine in yet another format, a 4-millimeter camcorder weighing only 2 1/2 pounds and expected to sell for $1,300. 
Why the new format? 
"The same reason you have a two-door and a four-door car," says Donald Kobes, the marketing-services manager. 
"Someone wants a smaller car." 

   An item that mass merchandisers such as K mart and Target still appear to be cool on is the compact-disk player, one of the hottest products of 1986. 
Although the prices are low enough -- some are available for less than $200 -- the disks themselves are still considered too expensive for many discount-store shoppers. 

   Compact-disk players "are a growing portion of our business," says K mart's Mr. Gullet. 
However, he adds, disk prices will have to be as inexpensive as record albums before the recorders can produce booming sales in mass-market outlets. 
New disks sell for about about $12.95, compared with an average of $7.99 for traditional records. 
"That," he says, "keeps a lot of people out of the market."

For those would-be cinematographers with 8mm camcorders, the Korean
electronics company Goldstar has introduced a simpler way of transferring
recordings from 8mm to VHS format so that the film can be viewed like an
ordinary video.
The RDD10i machine is a traditional VHS remote control VCR but with an extra
slot for 8mm tapes. By inserting the recorded 8mm tape and a blank VHS tape
the reording can be simply transferred. The system also includes basic film
editing capabilities to help produce a more professional film. The RDD10i
costs Pounds 629.99. Goldstar: South Korea, 2 787 1114; UK, 0753 691888.

<LEADPARA>  THE incredible shrinking video camcorder will be disappearing into pockets and
palms this fall.;   A couple of weeks ago, Sony introduced the CCD-TR51, a
1.3-pound stereo-sound and color-picture shooter billed as "the smallest and
lightest 8mm Handycam camcorder." November deliveries are promised on this
baby, which measures a scant 4 1/4 by 4 by 6 5/8 inches. Now reaching our
shores is Sony's not-much-bigger CCD-TR81, the first travel model to exploit
the sharper Hi8 picture-shooting technology, weighing in at one pound, 12
ounces.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  CAMCORDERS SHRINK FOR THE NO-HERNIA '90S  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  VIDEO  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Sony's boasts of diminutive proportions had to be Handycam-brand specific,
knowing that a few days later Canon would unveil its new ultraslim UC1 8mm
camcorder with eight-time zoom lens, weighing 1.28 pounds; as well as a more
advanced UCS1, a Hi8 variation with 10-time zoom, eight-position custom
exposure wheel and stereo sound, which bounces the scale to just 1.68 pounds.;
  Slim and packable;   Hitachi's newly unveiled VME25A 8mm camcorder is
slightly heavier, but employs a "twist-and-shoot" folding lens/viewfinder
(previously seen in VHS-C models) that makes this model even slimmer and more
packable than the flat-sided Canon cams. To boot, the Hitachi features an
extraordinary 64-time zoom lens, achieved with digital technology that blows
up the center portion of a captured image.;   Clearly, the smaller-is-better
logic is gaining steam. Early adaptors to video shooting have had it with
their clunky, hernia-producing seven- to 11-pound VHS and Betamovie
camcorders. And first-time buyers are marveling that these new models aren't
much bigger than their 35mm still cameras. Small 8mm and almost as compact
VHS-C camcorders are expected to monopolize sales in the still-lively
electronics market this holiday season.;   But is the very smallest really the
best? Not for everyone. For starters, you'll pay significantly more for the
privilege of carrying less -- $999 or thereabouts at a discount store for the
three new standard 8mm models mentioned above, and around $1,500 for the Hi8
variations (which also demand expensive tape for best pictures).;   If you can
live with one extra pound and a bit more bulk in a camcorder, you'll find lots
of other 8mm and VHS-C models selling in the $750-$799 range, some offered
complete with carrying cases.;   Why is less more costly in a camcorder?
You're essentially paying off the R&amp;D costs in downsizing the chassis, head
drum and circuitry. You're getting first crack at technical improvements to
the species, including more refined focus and exposure monitoring. In all
these mite-y new models, you can run the show and be in it -- with an infrared
remote control so small it can slip into your shirt pocket, or hang discretely
on the gripside of the camcorder (on the Canons) or hide inside the tape lid
(on the Hitachi).;   Bigger can be better;   Those bigger models have their
pluses, too. In a recent hands-on comparison of the Sony "Family" series
CCD-F401 (two pounds, 10 ounces) and the small, Hi8 CCD-TR81, I found the F401
more user-friendly on several accounts. Its buttons and labels are larger and
better spaced, easier to read and locate by touch. The bigger-barreled lens on
the F401 went wider (giving a more expansive view) and tighter (in the
telephoto mode) than the TR81's lens, though both are billed as eight-time
zooms. There are extra functions on the F401's larger remote control,
including slow motion and full record from stop.;   Best of all, the F401
offers a sports viewfinder with a magnified image so big you can stand a foot
or two away from the camcorder and still monitor the recording! This feature's
great for following the action of a sporting event or school play. When forced
to keep one eye closed and the other glued to a viewfinder, it's easy to lose
the big(ger) picture.;   As Sony's new high-end model, the CCD-TR81 certainly
has plenty to recommend itself, besides delightfully diminutive proportions.
Shooting inside under artificial light (the toughest test for a camcorder),
its Hi8 recording produced a cleaner, more detailed and color-accurate
picture. The TR81's stereo sound recording was smoother and more realistic
than the F401's monaural track. I also relished the TR81's unique, flywheel
adjustment control for brightness and shutter speed, which lets you make
recording adjustments in a wink.  </TEXT>

   Tired of watching movies at home because they don't have the
same punch as the ones at the local cinema?
   You can build a high quality theater at home, where your family
and friends can enjoy a real, cinema-like experience. And you don't
have to be a millionaire to finance an entertainment room fitted
out with thoughtfully selected basics.
   The basic components of a home theater are a large screen
monitor-receiver, hi-fi VCR and@or laser videodisc player, and a
quality audio system with surrounding sound.
   Depending on your tastes and pocketbook, a complete home theater
could cost a few thousand dollars or soar onto the megabucks scale.
It took me several years to finance and build my system.
   Since my theater room is relatively small, I decided that a
27-inch Sony monitor-receiver would do the job.
   The only video source driving the screen is a Magnavox videodisc
player, because I'm a collector of classic and blockbuster motion
pictures. I also have a VCR which I use on a portable TV in another
room to view rental tapes. Once I've made up my mind I want a movie
for my collections, I buy a copy in the high quality disc format.
   The audio system consists of an Onkyo TX-51 receiver (43 watts
per channel), a separate 10-band graphic equalizer, Pioneer audio
tape deck, Fisher Dolby Surround Sound decoder-amplifier (30 watts
per channel), a pair of magnetically-shielded speakers at the front
of the room and a pair of surround speakers hung from the ceiling
at the rear of the room.
   Since I had to place the front speakers near the
monitor-receiver, I bought magnetically shielded ones to prevent
picture distortion.
   The final result from this mixed bag of electronic components is
a theater-like experience in my own home.
   The Dolby Surround Sound decoder makes the jets in ``Top Gun''
sound like they're soaring right past you. It also puts the viewer
right in the middle of the action in the barroom fight in ``Raiders
of the Lost Ark.''
   Many of the other movies and concerts in my collection were
processed with Dolby sound tracks for added ambience and less
distortion.
   If you haven't heard a surround sound processor on home video,
try one out at a local dealer. It just may surprise you. (A note
for unsuspecting consumers: the processor must have a licensed
Dolby circuit to decode those hidden sound tracks on a tape or
disc. Don't settle for a cheaper unit which only ``manufactures'' a
surround mode. Look for the Dolby logo on the component or ask the
salesperson.)
   With the monitor-receiver offering more than 450 lines of
horizontal resolution, the picture achieved from the disc player is
superb.
   Simply put, my home theater gets the job done.
   When selecting your components, ask for a full in-store
demonstration. Since speakers are considered the heart of the audio
system, take some time to shop around for them. Be certain they fit
your exact needs before investing in them.
   If purchasing a large screen television or monitor-receiver,
consider the signal sources you will use at home. For instance, if
you are using a standard VHS HQ videocassette deck, then insist
that the salesperson give you a demonstration using a VHS HQ deck.
   Those big screens can be made to look extremely impressive in
stores when laser videodisc players, ED Beta or Super VHS decks are
driving them.
   Save yourself the trouble and disappointment of lugging a big
set home if it will not perform as you expected.
   There are a lot of audio components offered at varying prices on
today's market.
   Select what is right for you and your pocketbook. Stay away from
the frills if you won't use them. Select quality, brand name audio
components.

BIGGEST FAILURE PUSHED SONY TO LATEST SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN, Times Staff Writer

<TEXT>
<P>
Sony Corp., the company that came so triumphantly to Hollywood on Wednesday, 
shelling out $3.4 billion to buy Columbia Pictures, is now a $16-billion 
(sales) giant in two industries, entertainment and electronics. It's both the 
world's largest record producer and the world's leading manufacturer of compact 
disc players; it's a leading maker of television sets and now the owner of a 
movie studio and film library. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, scarcely six years ago, Sony was troubled. Its sales, then less than 
$5 billion, had been stagnant for years and its profits were declining. Worst 
of all, the Betamax videocassette recorder, a product into which it had poured 
20 years of effort and research, was on the verge of commercial failure. 
</P>
<P>
So how did the company go from trouble to triumph in six years? 
</P>
<P>
The immediate reason for the Betamax failure was competition. Sony's rival 
Matsushita had developed the VHS system and licensed it to any manufacturer or 
retailer who wished to slap a brand name on it -- from Sears to General 
Electric. The result: More VHS sets sold, which led to more films being 
available on VHS, which led to more VHS sets selling -- and to Sony recognizing 
Betamax's ultimate failure (the company discontinued the product in 1988). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changes Were Subtle 
</P>
<P>
However, Sony's real problem was not competition but overweening pride. Sony's 
renowned chairman and founder, Akio Morita, had decreed that Betamax could only 
sell under the Sony brand name and at a higher price than VHS -- because it was 
higher quality. It may have been, but the public didn't care and didn't buy. 
</P>
<P>
The Betamax debacle caused Sony to take a long look at its business and to make 
some changes. To be sure, Sony didn't go through a restructuring, as American 
corporations do; there was no manic selling of divisions at the company's 
Spartan headquarters in Tokyo, where all employees, including top executives, 
still wear uniform jackets -- a reminder of the firm's beginnings after World 
War II, when Japan was devastated and poor. 
</P>
<P>
The changes were subtle. Morita in 1984 began to step back from day-to-day 
management, and Sony President Norio Ohga emerged. Ohga, who is chairman today, 
is an opera singer by training who caught Sony's attention by prodding it to 
make a better tape recorder. He is a self-taught engineer, according to one 
Sony veteran, who understood that the firm had to shift direction. 
</P>
<P>
Sony began to seek industrial customers to lessen its dependence on consumer 
markets, which were becoming fickle as more and more companies, Korean as well 
as Japanese, flooded stores with electronic gadgetry. In such a market, Sony 
was unable to charge higher prices for its higher quality. 
</P>
<P>
But quality still counted with industrial customers. So Ohga departed from 
tradition and began to sell Sony technologies to other companies. The company's 
Trinitron TV screens now grace Apple Macintosh and some IBM computers. Sony, 
the first Japanese company to license Bell Labs' transistor in the 1950s, now 
sells $2 billion worth of its semiconductors to other manufacturers. Result: 
Non-consumer business now accounts for more than 25% of Sony's sales -- and the 
company aims to make it 50%. 
</P>
<P>
But most of all, the Betamax episode led Sony to think seriously about 
software, about making and selling not only the electronic gadgets but the 
songs and programs that play on them. Ohga and Morita and others at the firm 
asked themselves if Betamax might have done better if Sony had its own films to 
put on cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
The model for much of its thinking was N. V. Philips, the giant Dutch 
electronics firm. "Philips is our greatest competitor," Morita said in an 
interview last year. "And Philips benefited from software -- it owned Polygram 
Records, and that helped its compact discs." 
</P>

And so Sony moved into musical software in 1987 when it agreed to buy CBS 
Records for $2 billion. "Having software is important," said Michael Schulhof, 
who helped negotiate the CBS purchase. Schulhof, vice chairman of Sony Corp. of 
America, was one of the key men involved in Sony's negotiations with Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly software pays off. CBS Records now gives Sony 15% of its sales and 
double the operating profit of its traditional hardware business, according to 
analyst Thomas Chesser of the Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. brokerage 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Glowing Signpost 
</P>
<P>
But quick profit is not the vision that moved Sony into records or into movies. 
That vision was what the software could do in combination with the hardware, 
especially new, advanced hardware like Sony's digital audiotape and 
high-definition television, or HDTV. "Software is important because it helps 
boost your technology," explains William Connolly, president of Sony Advanced 
Systems, a New Jersey outpost of the global firm (Sony is the most 
international of Japanese companies, with 20% of its production outside Japan). 
"If you can get the technology going, program makers are going to produce for 
the most advanced mode. They'll begin shooting HDTV because they think of the 
rerun market, of the future value of their product." 
</P>
<P>
That's a glowing signpost to where Sony is headed. (Connolly headed advanced 
technology for CBS Television before that company stopped pursuing advances in 
TV equipment.) Sony intends to broaden acceptance for digital audiotape -- a 
recording product so pure that near-perfect copies are possible -- by using its 
own CBS music. Sony, which spends $1.3 billion a year on research and 
development, intends to broaden acceptance of HDTV by using the 2,700 films and 
23,000 episodes of television programing in the Columbia library -- either 
directly on HDTV broadcasting or in videocassettes. 
</P>
<P>
In short, Sony marches into the era of global entertainment and information 
industries as a potent giant, capable of pushing the envelope in both hardware 
and software. The only truly comparable American firm was Radio Corp. of 
America, RCA, the pioneer of radio and television technology as well as the 
developer of network radio and TV with NBC. 
</P>
<P>
But RCA no longer really exists. It has been sold and resold, and its brilliant 
technical people have been scattered. Happily, though, they are not unemployed 
-- many of the best of them now work for Sony.

These days, the home-electronics industry lives by an uncomplicated rule. 
Essentially, it requires that every few years the industry shall introduce a 
Big, Expensive (But Not Too Expensive!) New Thing that everybody decides is 
necessary to own in order to live a Satisfying, Quality Life. 
</P>
<P>
In the '80s, the VCR has been the most classic and profitable example. More 
recently it has been the compact-disc player. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Wayman, the snow-haired, avuncular traveling apologist for the Electronics 
Industry Assn., concedes that at the moment there is no such new macro-bauble 
on the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
But, he hastens to add, this year there are some pretty smart additions to the 
home-electronics universe. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, Wayman, on his annual industry-sponsored Johnny Appleseed tour 
of the country, swept through Hartford bearing several large nylon bags stuffed 
with the latest wave of electronic gewgaws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Plenty of New Things 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, the industry just now is in search of that one major product to get 
everyone excited," Wayman says, rooting through one of the sacks. "But look at 
all the new things that are coming out." 
</P>
<P>
He extracts a telephone disguised as a blue high-top sneaker. He regards it 
admiringly and lays it aside. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's that . . . ah, here it is." Wayman pulls out a nifty little Sony 
portable unit that's a TV and 8-millimeter video player in one trim chassis 
about the size of a collegiate dictionary. (Come to think of it, you can also 
now buy a collegiate dictionary contained within a little calculator-like 
device with a tiny screen.) 
</P>
<P>
"Portable video," Wayman says, beaming. "That's one thing we think is in the 
future. It's something that's going to catch on." The 8-millimeter video format 
is smaller than the more established VHS format, and it is starting to take 
hold, particularly for camcorders and the new portable devices like the one 
Wayman is toting. 
</P>
<P>
The Sony unit -- predictably dubbed Video Walkman -- reportedly has been 
selling well, despite the $1,000 price tag. One of the airlines now distributes 
the machines to its first-class passengers, and then the flight attendant 
passes around a basket of movie cassettes to select from. 
</P>
<P>
As for camcorders -- the all-in-one video cameras and recorders that now ring 
the stage three-deep at every suburban elementary school pageant in the nation 
-- Wayman believes that they may yet saturate the market the way VCRs have. But 
the price has to slide down to $500 or so. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we can get there. You already see the so-called VHS-C (C for compact) 
units being discounted to something around $650." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Much More to Tell 
</P>
<P>
But wait -- this visit is more to show than to tell, so Wayman is now 
distributing his wares across the floor. 
</P>
<P>
From this assortment, the next wave of home contrivances includes the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
* Video still cameras. These unassuming-looking units take up to 50 pictures at 
a clip and display them on your TV screen. In some quarters, they are 
considered the video generation's answer to home slides. Expensive, though -- 
around $900. 
</P>
<P>
* Waterproof things. Boom boxes, radios and speakers are being waterproofed so 
you don't have to suffer any loss of fidelity even if there's a sudden 
downpour. 
</P>
<P>
* Picture phone. Remember when, back at the 1964 World's Fair, they told us 
that picture phones (with moving images) were just around the corner? That was 
a tad optimistic. But they're getting there, and these latest 
phones-with-screens can transmit a sharp, instantaneous still image over the 
phone line. (The party you're talking to needs a set, too, naturally.) 
</P>
<P>
* Cellular phones. These are already big, of course, among self-important 
business people who feel the need to call their offices and bedevil their 
secretaries while they motor to lunch. But cellular phones (the term refers to 
the areas, or "cells," of reception) are increasingly popular among regular 
people, often as a safety device. Cellular phones are not just for cars, 
either; new models fit in a coat pocket. If they can keep dropping in price, 
they just might be the industry's Next Big Thing. 
</P>
<P>
* Home fax machines. The term "home office" is one that the electronics folks 
would like you to get used to. One of its centerpieces, the industry tells us, 
will be a facsimile machine that you can use for personal correspondence as 
well as business transactions. There is, incidentally, a new portable fax 
machine that you can use in your car (if you're not on the phone). 
</P>
<P>
* Hand-held electronic organizers. These are resourceful little babies, 
resembling overweight calculators, that can store addresses and phone numbers, 
remind you of your wedding anniversary, keep track of your appointments, assist 
you in making travel arrangements, record and store your expense-account 
outlays and rid your thighs of unsightly cellulite. 
</P>
<P>
* Kids' things. The future holds wristwatch walkie-talkies and radios (not that 
today's tykes have ever heard of Dick Tracy), AM-FM necklace radios, and many 
varieties of spelling and math talking minicomputers. 
</P>
<P>
Also, there's a "smart" telephone that automatically calls Mom, Dad, police or 
the fire department when you touch a color-coded pad. 
</P>
<P>
* Etc. Look for VCRs that can be programmed by phone, cordless speakers and 
headphones, elaborate car-security devices (such as the plush teddy bear that 
screams for the police when a window or door is jimmied) and hi-fi speakers 
that mount flush to the wall.

<HEAD>Have Yourself a Video Christmas - On a Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's more than one way to change a channel.
Here's a penny-pincher's guide - well, sort of - to a merry, video
Christmas for you and your loved ones:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE BIG TICKET:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   - Stereo VCR. This one piece of hardware should be as central to
your home video system as the TV tube itself. It's much more
versatile and it's the easiest purchase to justify.
   A stereo VCR converts any television into a stereo TV by
delivering its right and left audio channels to your home audio
system. It's the biggest, cheapest single improvement you can make
to a conventional TV.
   With the stereo VCR hooked up and tuned in and your good old
19-inch black-and-white Philco between the speakers, you have
stereo TV.
   It gives you much finer acoustic detail to go along with the
video image, and you'll be surprised at how much a good soundtrack
enhances your viewing.
   And there's a lot to hear: Most major TV markets have more than
one stereo broadcaster, most cable systems can deliver a stereo
signal, and most videocassettes sold and rented today are in
stereo.
   With that much programming available, it's just foolish not to
upgrade.
   When you're shopping, remember: A ``two-head'' or ``four-head''
or ``Hi-Fi'' VCR isn't necessarily a stereo model. Every VCR needs
one tape head to play and one head to record. Four-head models
allow for slow-motion, freeze frames and other special effects.
   With a stereo VCR, you also get SAP, or Secondary Audio Program
services (also known as MTS or Multi-Channel Television Sound). PBS
stations use it for descriptive narrative, weather reports and
simultaneous translation to a second language.
   Full-featured models retail for $300 to $450, but basic models
can be had for less than $250.
   - Stereo TV monitor. Here's where shopping pays. Discounters
offer stereo-ready, 25-inch TV monitors for just less than $400,
and basic 27-inch models for just more than $400. These are just
about perfect for home viewing.
   This is where belt-tightening gets tough, because the more bells
and whistles you tack on to that basic picture tube, the faster
that big ticket fattens.
   Then you find yourself paying $50 for delivery of a $2,500,
35-inch behemoth that claims to have 700 lines of resolution,
picture-in-picture, ``super-woofer'' and a microwave popcorn maker.
   Singlehandedly, you have tipped the economy into recession and
yourself into debtor's prison.
   And that bigger tube whets your appetite for that sweet, $500
LaserDisc player that has a 60 percent sharper picture, letterbox
formats, CD sound and handles audio Compact Discs - a whole new way
to spend money!
   Be strong (or at least have the decency to wait for the
after-Christmas sales).
   - Video Player. This is the biggest bargain for a budget.
Discounters offer rugged, play-only VHS machines for less than
$150. For the simple pleasure of home video viewing, they're hard
to beat.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE LESSER TICKET:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   - A decoder. Yes, that $1,500 ``Surround-Sound'' loudspeaker
system would match your living room decor, but Radio Shack sells
the basic decoder for around $130. So you find a couple of extra
speakers, hook 'em up, rent your favorite disaster movie, and strap
yourself to the couch. ... Apartment dwellers note: THIS DOES NOT
INDEMNIFY YOU FROM PLASTER DAMAGE!
   - A cassette rewinder. For about $30, you can spare the
wear-and-tear that sends most VCR and players to the shop.
   - LaserDiscs. Got a finicky videophile on your list? These
beauties sell for anywhere from $19.95 red tag specials to $200
boxed sets, although most releases retail for $30 to $35. Give 'em
``Motel Hell.'' That scene with the dueling chainsaws is high point
of 20th century cinema. Heh, heh, heh. ...
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE LOW TICKET:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   - Multiple-outlet strips. Anyone with electronic gear will
welcome one of these. At $20 to $30, a four- or six-outlet strip
feeds into a safe, heavy-duty cord and a three-prong plug.
   - Spike protector. At about $20, it can prevent a lightning bolt
from frying a home entertainment center.
   - Prerecorded cassettes. There are thousands of movies on the
home market, and you already know what movies and stars your
friends and relatives enjoy. And is there a better way to
tranquilize the kids late on Christmas Day than a movie on
cassette? Lassie, come home!
   - Blank tapes. In the history of videocassette recording, no one
ever has been known to have enough blank tapes. No one. Ever.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>THE LITTLEST TICKET:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   - Compressed air. A spray can of this sure beats dusting with
Lemon Pledge. - A good penlight. Fumbling in the dark for tiny
switches, wires and RCA sockets is not unlike hell.
   - Videotape labels. Quick, which is it: SIS-'N'-MOM '86, VAC`N
H'LITES '85, NATIONAL VELVET. New labels mean never having to say
you're sorry.
   Happy holidays!

FT  12 JAN 93 / Technology: Cheaper HDTV in view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Two products aimed at breaking through consumer resistance to
high-definition television for home use were unveiled by Victor Co of Japan
(JVC) last week. The company plans to launch a low-priced HDTV set and
HDTV-compatible video cassette recorder in the Japanese domestic market by
autumn this year.
Huge investment in research and development of HDTV by Japanese companies,
and the increasing volume of HDTV broadcasting in Japan, have so far
translated into very limited sales of HDTV sets, largely due to the
prohibitively high cost of models already on the market.
The cheapest HDTV set so far on sale in Japan is a Y1.3m (Pounds 6,800)
model from Sony. Other versions, labelled 'Hi-Vision', are half-way houses
between HDTV and conventional TV, using simplified decoders which produce
picture quality better than ordinary TVs but not up to full HDTV standards.
JVC says production costs for its new HDTV will be much lower because of the
development of a smaller, simpler but fully-functional decoder requiring
fewer integrated circuits. The new sets will go on sale in Japan later this
year, priced at less than Y1m, the level at which industry analysts have
predicted that sales for home use will take off. However, supplies will
reach the shops too late to take advantage of the boom in HDTV sales
predicted in the run up to the wedding of the Japanese crown prince this
summer.
The HDTV video recorder is also to be sold cheaply enough to break into the
mass market, at around Y600,000. Using technology known as W-VHS, the
machine splits HDTV signals to record them on double-track metal tape. The
company stresses that in addition to making high-quality HDTV recordings, it
can also play back existing VHS format recordings, and can record two
conventional TV programmes simultaneously on the double-track tape.
JVC claims the videos will also be compatible with the next generation of
HDTV broadcasting systems being planned around the world, not just with the
current Japanese Muse format.

FT  19 AUG 92 / International Company News: Sony to set the tone for the
sector - Gordon Cramb previews the results season for Japanese electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON CRAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SONY of Japan's shareholders will not be the only group waiting for signs of
an upturn when it reports its first-quarter results today, after plunging
into a Y20.5bn (Dollars 163m) parent operating loss in the year to last
March.
Keen interest in Sony's fortunes will also be shown by a batch of Japanese
electronics companies, which specialise in the consumer audio-visual sector
and which look to Sony to set a lead in technological innovation.
They will be seeking indications that Sony has products or applications on
the horizon which will aid their recovery from the country's protracted
downturn in consumer spending.
Analysts in Tokyo, however, see a more immediate problem for the dedicated
audio companies. Sony and the larger Matsushita Electric Industrial, they
say, are increasingly going down-market into cheaper domestic ranges to use
surplus production capacity and increase market share. 'This will gradually
hurt other competitors,' said an industry watcher.
Aiwa, partly because it is a 52.5 per cent Sony subsidiary, occupies a
special place among those in the sector. In 1987 it was among the first
Japanese electronics companies to undergo a restructuring when half its
output was moved overseas, mainly to Singapore, and its product line was
pruned.
Mr Hajime Ukoni, brought in from Sony and now Aiwa president, said this week
he expected others in the audio products industry would probably have to
follow a similar route.
Some large and diversified electronics makers have already either quit the
audio sector in the past year or reduced their manufacturing presence.
Toshiba has stopped making cassette and compact disc players. Hitachi is
concentrating domestic output at the top end of the audio market, while
providing marketing support to its loss-making Nippon Columbia affiliate,
maker of the Denon hi-fi brand.
Mr Ukoni argued that Aiwa is better placed than specialist audio producers
which have not yet shed surplus domestic capacity. However, he added: 'We
have turned into a headwind. Unless we handle this wisely, we could end up
the same as five years ago. It's a tough year for me.'
Aiwa's strategy has been to focus on familiar products slightly
differentiated from those of its competitors, and then price them keenly.
Its best line is a compact stereo system including television and video. The
unit is being sold as a household's second system in an otherwise saturated
market.
Along with Sony, the usually slower-moving Matsushita remains a potent force
at the head of the industry because of its size and its strong brand names,
such as Panasonic and Technics.
Against Matsushita's digital compact cassette, Sony places its
next-generation audio hopes on the minidisc, a recordable format intended to
replace compact discs. The company has been attempting to allay fears that
this fight  - which it could lose to Matsushita, as it did with its Betamax
video format versus its rival's VHS  - is inhibiting investment in other
potentially promising directions.
Mr Norio Ohga, Sony president, said earlier this month that 'the burden from
investments in 8mm camcorders and minidiscs has been heavy. To recover
profits on our previous investments we have to lower new investment'.
To counter the domestic downturn, audio producers are stepping up sales in
overseas markets, which already account for around two thirds of all
revenues for companies in the sector.
Many groups are battling at home to contain production costs and swollen
inventories  - cutting overtime and shifting staff to product areas which
are performing better.
Recruitment of engineers and skilled workers is generally being maintained
but advertising budgets have been pared. But in some respects the approaches
of the companies differ markedly.
Pioneer, also due to report quarterly results today, agrees with Aiwa in
principle. 'In Japan there are 42m households. In the past we thought in
terms of one system, one household. Now we are targeting family members
separately,' an official said.
But Pioneer has gone a different route, trying to draw consumers to new
products. It is stressing higher price-tag items aimed at those in their 30s
and 40s.
Pioneer lists laser home karaoke systems and big-screen projection
televisions as growth products. Through its car audio side it has launched a
satellite navigation system and a satellite link which shows a vehicle's
position on an in-car screen.
Kenwood, also aiming for the upper end of the market, said it has maintained
market share partly because it has been generous in its dealer margins. But
both companies, along with others, face increasing volume competition from
Sony.
Non-operating income kept Sony in the black at the parent pre-tax level last
year, while its worldwide entertainment interests held the overall group
comfortably in profit.
Today's figures may indicate how it has fared in rebuilding its domestic
earnings base in the face of an increasingly dull consumer climate. The
tougher its actions in doing so, however, the more other Japanese audio
companies are likely to suffer.

<HEADLINE>  A STAR IS BORN: LASER DISC SALES ARE FINALLY TAKING
OFF  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     In a Christmas shopping season hobbled by recession, laser discs and laser
disc players are one of the few sources of holiday cheer for consumer
electronics retailers.;   Paul Kagan Associates Inc., a market research firm
in Carmel, estimates sales of laser discs will increase 57 percent in 1991 and
a further 40 percent in 1992; sales of laser disc players will jump 23 percent
this year and 16 percent in 1992.;   Total sales are still small. About 1
million households in the United States will have a laser disc player by the
end of next year, compared with 75 million households containing a
videocassette recorder.;   But most other types of home electronics are in the
doldrums. According to statistics compiled by the Electronic Industries
Association of Washington, D.C., sales of color televisions dropped 6 percent
in the first 11 months of this year and VCR sales inched up only 3 percent.;  
"Laser disc is a product whose time has come," said Bill Matthies of The
Verity Group, a research firm in Diamond Bar, an eastern suburb of Los
Angeles.;   After more than a decade on the market, the ingredients are
finally in place for rapid expansion of laser disc sales. If everything
follows according to the plans of manufacturers, household penetration could
reach 10 percent in five years.;   For the uninitiated, laser discs -- or LDs
-- are the video equivalent of compact discs -- or CDs -- for music.;   LDs
are 12 inches in diameter, about the size of the long-playing records pushed
out of existence by CDs, and are made of the same plastic that reflects a
rainbow hue of colors. Because LDs can store more information than videotapes,
laser disc players produce an image with 60 percent more resolution than the
VHS format used in videocassette recorders. What's more, LDs offer CD-quality
sound, especially important for the emerging market of "home theaters" that
combine big-screen televisions and stereo systems.;   "The larger your screen,
the more you need laser disc," said film critic Roger Ebert in a telephone
interview from his Chicago office. Ebert, best known for the television show
"Siskel and Ebert at the Movies," has been tirelessly recommending laser discs
to his readers and viewers for the past five years.;   LDs are becoming the
format of choice for movie collectors such as Ebert. Because the laser inside
a player doesn't actually touch the spinning disc, there is almost no wear --
a distinct contrast to videocassettes, which lose their picture quality after
repeated viewing. LD players also have the ability to jump instantly to any
spot on a disc. That isn't particularly important for watching movies, but is
a key feature for viewing music videos and certain types of children's
programming.;   Movie studios are helping develop the laser market by pricing
most LDs at $25 to $35, including new releases. Although some movies on
videocassette are sold at discount prices as low as $10, most new releases are
priced at $100 -- limiting their appeal to video rental stores.;   Laser discs
aren't new. The first players reached U.S. retailers in 1978, about the same
time VCRs were starting to gain popularity. But LDs never took off in the
1980s, because consumers wanted the ability to record programs -- something a
laser disc player can't do -- and because a competing laser system from RCA
called Selectavision failed in 1984 after several years on the market.;  
Laser discs are finally clicking with the public for several interrelated
reasons:;   (check) Home theater. The improved picture quality of a laser disc
is only marginal on a typical 19-inch television set, and the CD-quality sound
isn't noticeable on that TV's small, tinny speaker. But some 11 million
households now have big-screen televisions, defined as 27 inches or above, up
from 5 million households just two years ago. The better resolution and sound
is much more compelling on a big-screen TV.;   "If people see it once, they're
hooked," said Douglas Pratt, editor of The Laser Disc Newsletter in East
Rockaway, N.Y. "You can't watch something on VHS after you've seen it on
laser. All you notice are the flaws.";   About 500,000 to 750,000 homes now
have laser disc players, only a fraction of those with big-screen TVs, so
there is considerable room for growth.;   (check) Lower prices and "combi"
players. Until the last two years, prices for laser disc players started at
$1,000 -- out of reach for most consumers. But low-end LD players are now $400
and could drop another $100 in the next year or two. What's more, most models
on the market today are so-called "combi" players that also play standard
5-inch music CDs and 8-inch video CDs.;   (check) More manufacturers. After
laser disc flopped in the early 1980s, only one manufacturer stayed in the
market -- Pioneer Electronic Corp. of Japan. Retailers and consumers were
nervous about investing in a format with only a single company behind it,
perhaps because they remembered how Selectavision buyers were orphaned when
RCA dropped the system.;   In the last two years, however, the heavy hitters
of consumer electronics have finally decided to throw their weight behind
laser discs. Matshushita, through its Panasonic line, and Sony have both
started selling laser disc players in the U.S; Sony also added an LD
production line at its CD plant in Terre Haute, Ind.;   The presence of Sony
and Panasonic will do more than resolve consumer jitters. The two companies
have much broader distribution networks than Pioneer, which mostly sells
through stereo shops, so that laser disc players are showing up more and more
in high-volume electronics stores.;   (check) More titles. Back when Pioneer
was going it alone in laser disc, there were only a few hundred movies
available on laser disc and few stores sold LDs. There are now 7,000 movies
and music videos on the market and laser discs are sold nationwide. Some video
stores are also beginning to rent laser discs.;   "We finally felt the market
had got to a critical size where it made sense for us to get into the
business," said Geoff Holmes, a senior vice president of Time Warner Inc. In
August, Time Warner started producing LDs at its disc-pressing plant in
Oliphant, Pa.;   The future for laser discs is far from guaranteed, however.; 
 Consumer electronics technology is poised for massive change in ways that are
hard to predict. Cable television systems, for example, are trying to develop
"video-on-demand" systems that would supply a wide variety of movies at the
push of a button. If video-on-demand is a success, it could undermine the
demand for laser discs.;   Laser discs also could be hurt by technological
improvements in VCRs, although a new high-resolution format called Super VHS
hasn't been selling well.;   But new technology could also help the laser
format. Pioneer has developed a recordable laser disc system, priced at $30,00
for professional use. If Pioneer or another manufacturer can invent a low-cost
version, laser discs could eventually displace VCRs.  </TEXT>

Sony and Philips, two of the world's largest consumer electronics groups,
yesterday fired the opening salvo in the battle to specify the format for
the next generation of compact discs, which will play films as well as
music.
The electronics industry has for years been developing a more sophisticated
version of the audio-CD, which would replace the video cassette and provide
some of the data storage capacity of interactive CD-ROM discs. The new discs
will be played on special machines, which will also play audio-CDs.
Sony and Philips, which liaised successfully to launch the original audio-CD
in 1982, are anxious that their proposed format should become the industry
standard, thereby enabling them to earn royalties from licensing the
technology to other companies.
They face strong opposition from Toshiba, the Japanese electronics company
which has designed its own disc format in conjunction with the Time Warner
entertainment group.
The rivalry raises the threat of a repetition of the 'video war' in the
1980s when Sony lost a battle to impose Betamax as the standard format for
video cassettes against the VHS format devised by the Matsushita group.
An early version of the discs with video capacity, or 'video-CDs', is
already available in Japan. They have had limited success as they only run
for 72 minutes (the same as audio-CDs) and are therefore unsuitable for
feature films, which have a minimum length of 90 minutes.
Some companies, including Philips, have addressed this problem by developing
multi-disc players, which can play films or operas by running from one disc
to another. However, multi-disc is seen as an interim solution, before the
industry moves on to more advanced CDs.
The format proposed by Sony and Philips is for a 12cm-wide disc (the same
size as an audio-CD) with the capacity to store five times more data. It
will play 135 minutes of video, enough for most feature films.
Sony claims that its new format offers 'superior' visual quality to video
cassettes and sound 'at least as good as audio-CD'. It says that production
costs will be 'reasonable', as it can use its existing capacity to
manufacture the new hardware and discs.
However, next month Toshiba plans to launch the prototype of a disc that can
store data on both sides and up to 270 minutes of video. It claims it offers
superior visual images to the Sony format.

   The laser videodisc format is actually the big brother of the
compact disc and is continuing to grow in popularity among
audio-video enthusiasts.
   Though the concept of the optical-read disc has not changed in
its 11-year history, there have been some big quality advances.
   Today's laser videodisc players provide more than 400 lines of
horizontal resolution to complement large screen monitors. Most new
discs range from hit movies to music videos and also incorporate
true digital sound.
   And 1989 was a banner year for disc sales in the United States.
   Some of the popularity growth may be attributed to the
acceptance of the compact disc.
   What can this playback-only disc system do?
   Here's the lowdown on the laser videodisc format:
   Discs:
   They come in three sizes, 12, 8 and 5-inch. The 12-inch discs
feature hit movies, concerts, operas, and educational material.
They can contain up to 60 minutes of audio-video programming per
side.
   The 8-inch discs are usually music videos with up to 20 minutes
of programming per side.
   The 5-inch laser videodiscs are known as CDVs (compact disc
video) and are gold in color. They resemble standard CDs but are
able to hold up to 5 minutes of video along with 20 minutes of
audio. These discs are also devoted to music.
   Compact discs, which can be played on most current models of
laser videodisc players, are available in 3- and 5-inch sizes. The
5-inch disc can store up to 74 minutes of material and the 3-inch
disc up to 20 minutes.
   The price of laser videodiscs also make them attractive to
collectors of classic and hit movies. Many new releases on disc are
priced at under $30, whereas the same title on a tape may cost as
much as $90.
   Music videos cost even less with CDVs listing for about $10.
   Since these discs are read by a low-power laser beam, there is
no wear to them. With proper handling and storage, they should last
a lifetime.
   Players:
   Many leading hardware manufacturers currently offer laser
videodisc players. You can select from such names as Pioneer,
Magnavox, Yamaha, Sony, NEC, Mitsubishi, Sharp, and Philips.
Panasonic and Proton are expected to market players soon.
   All of the name-brand players are available as ``combi'' units.
They will play all of the optical disc formats from CDs to 12-inch
laser videodiscs (LDs).
   These combination players are available for about the price of
hi-fi VHS videocassette recorder.
   Pioneer also offers a lower-priced player for 8- and 12-inch
discs which has analog instead of digital audio circuitry.
   Players with all of the frills offer such features as two-sided,
two-disc playback and sing-along capabilities.
   How they work:
   I recently bought a new Pioneer CLD-1070, my third laser
videodisc player since becoming a charter member of the ``laser
camp'' in 1979.
   It's connected to a 27-inch Sony monitor and my stereo system,
which has a separate Dolby Surround processor-amplifier and rear
speakers.
   This ``combi'' player can do it all. The remote control allows
the user to program selected tracks from compact discs as well as
laser videodiscs encoded with ``chapter stops.''
   For instance, if I want to see a particular scene from ``Raiders
of the Lost Ark,'' the player can locate it in a matter of seconds.
   The player will also produce jitter-free freeze frame and slow
motion on selected discs.
   The picture provided by the laser videodisc is far sharper than
my HQ VHS deck. Colors are vivid and true and the picture is rock
solid.
   As for the sound, nothing compares to digital audio.
   It's a state-of-the-art component which makes the ``home
theater'' concept a reality.
   This deck, like most laser videodisc players, can be racked into
an audio-video system since it has a front-loading drawer.
   The player will automatically select the proper playing mode for
compact discs or the larger LDs. It also knows which big discs
contain digital soundtracks and will switch on the digital circuit.
   In scanning the current line-up of players, most have similar
features, so it's a matter of preference when making a purchase.
   Another important point about this high-quality format is that
many of the feature films being released may be purchased in the
``letterbox'' or widescreen format.
   Usually when a movie filmed for the widescreen comes to the home
tube, it is cropped in a process known as pan and scan. By cropping
the wide picture, it will fill up the entire television screen.
   But up to two-thirds of the picture may be lost in this process,
so the viewer is not seeing all of the action.
   By ``letterboxing'' a videodisc release, the picture is not
cropped. Instead, black bars are inserted on the top and bottom of
the programmed material and the original widescreen picture is left
intact.
   With disc production currently being increased and more strongly
backed by hardware manufacturers, the laser videodisc could prove
to be a powerful force in home entertainment in the 1990s.

   SONY CORP. officials said the Japanese electronics company may begin output of VHS-format videocassette recorders at its French production unit later this year. 
For the time being, the officials added, Sony plans to supply the European market with VHS units made for the company by Hitachi Ltd. of Japan. 
As previously reported, Sony said last month that it will begin making VHS recorders in addition to its Beta-format models.

If you've bought a Super-VHS videocassette recorder, you may have given up on 
finding pre-recorded tapes in S-VHS. However, there are a few movies and other 
programs you can buy in this sharper-picture tape format, if you know where to 
look. 
</P>
<P>
Where to look is Super Source, a San Francisco-based company that specializes 
in Super-VHS tapes. The relatively new company doesn't have a lot to offer yet, 
and you have to buy, not rent, but what it does have may be of interest. 
</P>
<P>
Super Source offers these movies in S-VHS: "The Princess Bride" ($49.95), 
"Blade Runner" ($59.95), "The Last Emperor" ($89.95), "On Golden Pond" 
($59.95), "RoboCop" ($89.95), "The Emerald Forest" ($49.95), "A Chorus Line" 
($49.95) and "White Mischief" ($49.95). Prices do not include postage. 
</P>
<P>
There are also a few non-movie S-VHS tapes available, including some excellent 
nature and travel programs. And in a week or two, the non-movie fare will 
include "The Nutcracker," the first in a series of Bolshoi ballets digitally 
recorded last spring. Hamilton Bryan, president of Super Source, says he is 
also negotiating with film studios for more material, and hopes to announce a 
multitape deal with a "mini-major" company soon. 
</P>
<P>
Information on Super Source and a free catalogue: (800) 331-6304. 
</P>
<P>
THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Did it boost secretaries or knock them? That was the controversy over "Working 
Girl" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, R), a sprightly and successful romantic comedy starring 
Melanie Griffith, Sigourney Weaver, Harrison Ford and (especially winning as 
the working girl's girlfriend) Joan Cusack. Mike Nichols directed. 
</P>
<P>
Major-league baseball has almost wound down for the year, but you can rewind 
and watch "Major League" (Paramount, no list price, R) as many times as you 
like -- though you may cry "foul" if you expect this uneven comedy, starring 
Tom Berenger and Charlie Sheen, to be as good as "Bull Durham." 
</P>
<P>
"The Dream Team" (MCA, $89.95, PG-13) isn't a baseball club. However, it is 
made up of four mental patients who become separated from their doctor on the 
way to a baseball game -- close enough. The comedy features a 
just-before-"Batman" Michael Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
"Criminal Law" (HBO, $89.99, R) features Gary Oldman and Kevin Bacon in a drama 
about a defense attorney who finds out something disturbing about the client he 
has helped clear of a murder charge. 
</P>
<P>
"Checking Out" (Virgin Vision, $89.95, R) is a black comedy about a man (Jeff 
Daniels) who drives everybody around him crazy because he's scared to death of 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
And video stores are stocking up for Halloween, including these new tapes: 
"Fright Night Part II" (IVE, $89.95, R), the 1977 horror classic "Suspiria" 
(Magnum, $89.98, a 92-minute R version and a 97-minute unrated version), "The 
Return of Swamp Thing" (RCA/Columbia, $89.95, PG-13) and "976-EVIL" 
(RCA/Columbia, $89.95, R). 
</P>
<P>
Vintage: "Bedtime Story" (MCA, $59.95) is the 1963 comedy about con men 
starring Marlon Brando and David Niven that was remade last year as "Dirty 
Rotten Scoundrels." "The Choirboys" (MCA, $79.95, R) is a 1977 drama about cops 
in their off-hours; Robert Aldrich directed. 
</P>
<P>
Reprices: " 'Crocodile' Dundee," "White Christmas," "The Red Shoes," "Ferris 
Bueller's Day Off," "Big Top Pee-wee," "Charlotte's Web," "The Little Prince," 
"An Officer and a Gentleman" and "Popeye" are now $14.95 each. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
One of video's favorite exercisers, Callan Pinckney, returns with the third in 
her "Callanetics" series, "Beginning Callanetics" (MCA, $24.95). As the title 
indicates, this 60-minute tape is a basic introduction to the low-impact 
method. TERRY ATKINSON

   Victor Co. of Japan said Monday it will create a
new record company with the music division of the U.S.
entertainment giant MCA.
   The new company, formed between JVC and MCA Music Entertainment
Group, will market and promote the record labels MCA, Geffen and
GRP in Japan, according to a statement from JVC, manufacturer of a
wide range of audio equipment, records, compact discs.
   JVC spokesman Masayuki Murakami said the move was not related to
reports of a buyout of MCA by JVC's parent company, the consumer
electronics giant Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
   Murakami said the agreement will cover records and compact
discs; music videos were under negotiation. Among the artists that
record under the three labels are Tom Petty, Guns 'n Roses,
Aerosmith and Chick Corea.
   The deal gives Matsushita access to audio software while helping
MCA market its products in Japan, said Barry Dargan, senior
technology analyst at James Capel &amp; Co.
   The new venture, which will be owned equally by the two
companies and begin operations next year, also could help JVC
develop a market for digital audio tape, or DAT.
   Murakami said MCA approached JVC about the record deal, and
negotiations began last spring.
   ``As far as our talks with MCA are concerned, it was ... nothing
related to Matsushita talks with MCA,'' Murakami said.
   Last week, Matsushita confirmed it was holding talks with MCA
but refused to elaborate. Reports said the Japanese company was
considering a buyout of MCA, which includes Universal Pictures,
valued at $7 billion.
   Last year, rival Sony Corp. acquired Columbia Pictures
Entertainment, in large part to gain control over its rich library
of old films and television shows.
   Purchases of film libraries allow consumer electronics companies
to release old movies and television shows for the videotape
recorders they manufacture, and also provide material for future
high-definition television recordings.
   JVC originated the VHS video format, while Sony is a strong
backer of 8-millimeter video.

Sony and Philips, two of the world's largest consumer electronics groups,
yesterday fired the opening salvo in the battle to specify the format for

The format proposed by Sony and Philips is for a 12cm-wide disc (the same
size as an audio-CD) with the capacity to store five times more data. It
will play 135 minutes of video, enough for most feature films.
Sony claims that its new format offers 'superior' visual quality to video
cassettes and sound 'at least as good as audio-CD'. It says that production
costs will be 'reasonable', as it can use its existing capacity to
manufacture the new hardware and discs.
However, next month Toshiba plans to launch the prototype of a disc that can
store data on both sides and up to 270 minutes of video. It claims it offers
superior visual images to the Sony format.

<LEADPARA>  MINIATURE television sets are most plentiful at ball games, I am told, their
antennas sprouting from the stands. After a particularly dramatic touchdown or
double play, heads bend toward them as if in benediction.;    The screens are
tuned not to favorite soap operas and sitcoms but to the very same game being
played on the field.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Such a peculiar combination of public gathering and private viewing, of an
experience mixed with the televised image of it, is one consequence of the
successful new crop of television sets the size of shirt pockets.;    At the
other extreme is the new generation of large-screen TV sets -- 30 inches or
more, measured diagonally. They, too, are objects of near-obsession, not only
dominating rooms but nearly replacing them.;    When a 50-inch screen comes to
life, conversation stops and eyes turn.;    One new model can simultaneously
display still images from seven different programs, create a stroboscopic
array of three pictures and split the screen in half to show two channels at
once.;    Sets of these extreme sizes were a small percentage of the 20
million sold last year, but they are gradually leading to new relationships
with the medium.;    TV's changing role;  Just as the era of network dominance
is coming to an end, so is TV's mooring in home life. The large screen creates
a sort of video cocoon that absorbs viewers in silence: The home is virtually
incidental.;    The miniature model severs the TV set from home life almost
completely: Watching television alone can now be a public act, something done
in the park, a library, a sports stadium.;    One could almost feel nostalgic
for the days when the TV set was a modern version of the kitchen hearth, its
blue light the center of the domestic world.;    The miniature TV set was
developed by Sony seven years ago, a video version of the Walkman, the
personal tape player. They dubbed it the Watchman and have since sold 3
million of them.;    Sony says a third have been sold to sports fans, who take
them to games to catch the commentary and instant replays.;    Sony's most
inexpensive model, the FD-10A, has a two-inch black-and-white screen and sells
for less than $100. Another, aimed specifically at sports fans, comes with a
shoulder strap (the FD-250; it lists at $169.99 and also can be hooked up to a
camcorder).;    Sony, among other Japanese companies, also is now producing
color models (beginning at $399), and have sold about 100,000 in the last
three years.;    The color LCD screens are far superior to those available a
few years ago, though they still have limited viewing angles, making one
viewer seem company and two a crowd.;    Recently, energy has been focused on
redesigning the shells for these screens. Sony's color Watchman model FDL-330S
is in the shape of a cube with a 2.7-inch detachable screen that can double as
a camcorder monitor.;    This spring, Sharp is to release the largest
mini-set, which will have a 5.6-inch screen; Sharp shows it in publicity
photographs installed in a car, pointed toward the passenger seat, and says it
can withstand the temperature variations of an automobile's interior.;   
Casio's new pocket set (TV-470) will have rounded corners and thumb-controlled
buttons, making it seem more like a hand-held video game.;    The video-game
companies, in turn, are making hand-held game players that double as TV sets.
NEC has just created a color game player, the Turbo Express ($249), which
accepts Turbografx-16 cards for play on its 2.7-inch screen.;    It also
offers an optional tuner ($100) that turns the game player into a television
set. Sega is about to follow suit with a new hand-held system, Game Gear.;   
Other electronic crossbreeds also have been evolving. Two years ago, Sony
combined one of its Watchman color screens with an 8-millimeter videocassette
recorder to create the Video Walkman.;    The latest version (GV-300, $1,400),
about a year old, is the size of a hard-cover book, and some fear it may one
day replace books.;    This Walkman has a tiltable four-inch screen and stereo
programmable recording. It can even be hooked up to a large-screen set and
used as an ordinary VCR.;    Everyday uses;    Sony, which owns Columbia
Pictures, is promising extensive releases of movies on tape for the compact
format.;    Businesses are using the Video Walkman for training tapes, and
Virgin Atlantic Airways provides passengers with them for movie-viewing.;   
They can even be rented (for $10 a day, with a movie) from Grand Central Radio
in Manhattan. In Japan, the Video Walkman has inspired the notion of "video
magazines" for commuters, mailed to subscribers periodically.;    Other
companies also released small screens with VCRs last year. Panasonic makes a
lunch-box-size player that accepts full-size VHS tapes (PV-M429) and shows
them on a four-inch screen. Sharp's $1,249 VHS tape player (VC-V540U) allows
TV viewing as well.;    All the while, large-screen models are improving in
sales as well as in resolution and brightness. The trade journal Television
Digest said that in the first nine months of 1990 -- a year when color-set
sales fell almost 5 percent -- sales of televisions with traditional color
tubes larger than 30 inches jumped more than 50 percent; nearly 200,000 units
were shipped to dealers.;    Shipments of projection sets, which can have
screens 50 inches or larger and range in price from $3,000 to $5,000, leaped
more than 25 percent to almost 270,000 units.;    All of this is bound to have
an effect on the way television is watched and even programmed. The small
screens make TV seem peculiarly distant.;    Sensory stimulation is minimized;
the music is bottled and strained. One watches TV programs and movies more
casually, only for the essentials. The broad outlines of plot and character
and motion become paramount.;    Large screens seem to do just the opposite,
turning soap commercials into epics. The camera movements become grandly
stylized.;    The music thuds its way into the stomach. Facial features of
sitcom characters start to take on the heroic dimensions once reserved for the
silver screen.;    Casual watching becomes almost impossible, movies become
irresistible and the trivial gets the same treatment as the momentous. Nothing
else can compete, certainly not the home.;    No doubt, the home will survive
the indignity. In the meantime, Sharp's solution, still in its technological
infancy, is enticing: its $3,495 Sharpvision XV-100, the first LCD projection
television set.;    It looks like a small movie projector without the reels
and, weighing 30 pounds, can sit on a table or be carried from room to room.; 
  When hooked up to a tuner or VCR or disk player it can project adjustable
images -- from 20 to 100 inches -- on any wall or screen. It can make
television seem both portable and theatrical.  </TEXT>

   The manual on your fancy new home
entertainment system says to ``access the next highest programmed
station setting'' on the TV, but warns ``the audio could be muted''
with improper handling.
   If you didn't understand the instructions to change the channel,
and press the right button or risk losing sound, welcome to the
growing ranks of ``techno-dolts.''
   Millions of Americans have trouble doing things like setting VCR
clocks or taping television programs; they are thoroughly confused
by many home electronics instruction books written in
engineer-speak and cluttered with graphics, says Karen Schriver, an
English professor at Carnegie Mellon University.
   Ms. Schriver was recruited by Mitsubishi Electronics America
Inc. to rewrite its manuals so the average consumer can understand.
   Over the past two years she has made hundreds of revisions.
Technical references and abbreviations were zapped and complicated
drawings cleared up.
   The beefier manuals were published on glossy paper with
``warning'' boxes, lots of white space, colored lines and detailed
indexes. The older manuals were flimsy, crowded and dull.
   The new manuals were packaged with this year's Mitsubishi
television sets and stereo gear. New books will accompany 1991's
videocassette recorders, video cameras and laser-disk players, the
company said.
   Mitsubishi is among a slowly growing number of Japanese
companies trying to improve communications with customers.
   Sansui USA Inc., for example, claims its new VCR on-screen
programming can be used by 5-year-olds and ``will make you a
technical wizard in no time.''
   But Japanese companies are ``still in a period of learning
what's expected of a manual in the United States,'' said John Hatch
of the American Electronics Association in Santa Clara, Calif.
   Ms. Schriver says consumers ultimately are being cheated by all
the technical language and drawings that ``look like spiders'' in
many current electronics manuals.
   ``We're buying a VCR that costs more because it has neat
features, but in the end we use three buttons - play, record and
rewind,'' she said. ``Meanwhile, the engineers are doing all these
things with new functions, but can't get their customers to do
them.''
   At Carnegie Mellon's Communications Design Laboratory, students
interviewed 50 people trying to use Mitsubishi products and noted
their stumbling blocks with the old instructions.
   There were several in this 65-word mouthful on how to record
from one VCR to another:
   ``The M-AV1 and M-AV2 incorporates S-VHS inputs for S-VHS VCRs
and an S monitor output for connection to an S compatible TV. When
two S-VHS VCRs are connected to the receiver with S cables, it is
not possible to dub from one to the other through the receiver.
When S-VHS to S-VHS dubbing using S-VIDEO cables is desired,
connect the VCRs directly to one another.''
   With the lab's help, it became: ``You cannot record from one
Super VHS VCR to another through the receiver when you use S-Video
cables. To do this, you must connect the VCRs directly to each
other.''
   The changes are making Mitsubishi an industry leader in showing
customers how to use products, said Ms. Schriver. She said several
Japanese electronics companies inquired about applications of her
research on their products.
   Ms. Schriver said the writers of manuals often have been
entry-level engineers who typically dwelled on the equipment's new
capabilities and forgot about ``the poor consumer who still wants
to know about setting the clock.'' Stand-up comics across the
country often target VCR owners whose machines forever are blinking
``12:00 Sunday'' because they can't set the day and time.
   Recent guests on ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' tried unsuccessfully
for 30 minutes to program VCRs for taping.
   Charlene Guyer, a self-proclaimed ``techno-dolt'' and guest on
the ``Oprah'' show, says she's confused by booklets for answering
machines, cameras, VCRs and stereo components from several
companies. She says she has owned a Panasonic VCR for four years
but never taped a program.
   ``Part of my personality is impulsive. If I can't do it quickly,
I don't want to do it,'' said Ms. Guyer, a Philadelphia marketing
consultant. ``You figure you're going to devote a lifetime just to
turn the thing on. So you become frustrated, and end up calling in
your neighbor's kid and paying him 25 cents to do it.''
   Even at Carnegie Mellon, an institution known for computer
science and engineering, students regularly go to Ms. Schriver's
lab to plead for help hooking up electronic gear.
   Assisting such people is serious business, said Christopher
Freeble, a Mitsubishi communications design specialist and former
student of Ms. Schriver's.
   ``We want to look at the product the same way the consumer looks
at it,'' Freeble said from the company's headquarters in Cypress,
Calif., a suburb of Los Angeles.
   Freeble said Mitsubishi is losing money on the new expensive
manuals because their costs aren't passed on, but ``the money is
well spent.''
   ``We feel in the end, we'll buy greater consumer loyalty,'' he
said.
