<HEAD>Study: Calcium Stops Bone Loss in Older Women</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Millions of older women can keep their bones
strong and help avoid the crippling effects of osteoporosis simply
by consuming every day the amount of calcium contained in three
glasses of milk, a study today concludes.
   Osteoporosis, the brittle bone disease, is one of the most
common afflictions of growing old. It affects an estimated 15
million to 20 million Americans and primarily strikes women after
menopause, when their bodies make less estrogen.
   The research found that by bringing up calcium consumption to
the recommended daily allowance - 800 milligrams or the equivalent
of 24 ounces of milk - can completely stop the loss of bone in the
hips, wrist and spine after about age 55.
   ``The people who benefited most substantially were those who had
a low usual intake of calcium in their diets - under 400 milligrams
a day,'' said Dr. Bess Dawson-Hughes, the study's director.
``That's about a serving and a half of calcium rich food. The
depressing thing is that millions of women in the United States in
this age group have an intake this low.''
   While older women are often advised to eat plenty of calcium,
some experts have doubted whether it really does prevent
osteoporosis.
   ``It's very important that they showed a calcium effect. That
should be trumpeted,'' commented Dr. Robert Recker of Creighton
University.
   Dawson-Hughes and colleagues conducted the study at the U.S.
Department of Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging
at Tufts University. It was published in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   ``Evidence is mounting that calcium matters,'' said
Dawson-Hughes. ``Here is the first real proof that it makes a
difference in older women.''
   According to a national survey, the average calcium consumption
among women over age 44 is 475 milligrams.
   Dairy products are a primary source of calcium, and a quart of
milk contains 1,200 milligrams. Other sources include dark green
vegetables such as broccoli, bony fish such as sardines, calcium
tablets and foods that are fortified with extra calcium.
   Women often lose bone rapidly after they go through menopause,
typically around age 50. The latest study found that adding calcuum
does nothing to prevent this during the first five years after
menopause. But by about age 55, enough calcium in the diet can stop
the erosion completely.
   Dr. William Peck, dean of Washington University medical school,
said that while the latest finding is important, women can still
benefit from estrogen supplements to preserve their bones
immediately after menopause.
   ``You don't want a women to think she can walk into the sunset
eating a lot of calcium,'' he said. ``She won't be protected.''
   The study was conducted on 301 women with low dietary calcium
intake. Doctors tested 500-milligram daily doses of two forms of
calcium - calcium carbonate, the type usually sold in calcium
supplements, and calcium citrate malate.
   Calcium citrate malate worked better, stopping loss of bone in
the spine, wrist and hip. Doctors said this form of calcium is
absorbed more readily, although women may be able to achieve the
same effect by taking larger doses of calcium carbonate.
   Calcium citrate malate is commercially available only in Citrus
Hill Plus Calcium brand of grapefruit and orange juice. Procter &amp;
Gamble, which makes the juices, co-sponsored the latest study with
the USDA. According to the company, 14 ounces of the juice contains
400 milligrams of calcium.
   Dawson-Hughes said she would like to see calcium citrate malate
made available in tablet form. However, she added, ``My first
choice for people to get their calcium is to use food sources,
because their general nutritional requirements are more likely to
be met than by popping pills.''

STUDY SAYS CALCIUM SUPPLEMENT MAY RETARD BONE LOSS 
</P>

Calcium supplements can retard bone loss associated with osteoporosis, but only 
in older women who have been postmenopausal for at least five years and who 
have calcium-deficient diets, a study published in Thursday's New England 
Journal of Medicine reveals. 
</P>
<P>
Among women who have been postmenopausal five years or less, calcium 
supplements appear ineffective in preventing a very rapid phase of bone loss, 
said Dr. Bess Dawson-Hughes, chief of the calcium and bone metabolism 
laboratory at the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts 
University in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
But after about five years, calcium supplements appear to kick in, preventing 
further bone deterioration. 
</P>
<P>
"That's where the good news is. If you are out of that rapid dip period, and if 
you have a low dietary intake, then increasing your calcium to the recommended 
dietary allowances has a very substantial benefit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Past research on the effectiveness of calcium supplements has yielded mixed 
results because most studies have failed to distinguish between women who are 
recently postmenopausal and those who are well beyond menopause, Dawson-Hughes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, calcium is widely held as important in preventing bone loss, but 
medical experts have not agreed on the need for supplements. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to look at subsets of the postmenopausal population," Dawson-Hughes 
said. "We had enough people here that we could partition them into subsets and 
thereby develop more of an idea of what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
The study is clear on two other points. Women who already achieve high calcium 
intake through their diets do not need supplements. And supplements of calcium 
citrate malate, a form patented by Procter &amp; Gamble and found in Citrus 
Hill Plus Calcium orange and grapefruit juices, appeared to be better absorbed 
than calcium carbonate, the more popular form found in over-the-counter 
products such as Tums, Dawson-Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
The study examined 301 healthy, postmenopausal women ages 40 to 70 for two 
years. Half of the women had a usual dietary calcium intake of less than 400 
milligrams a day -- about two servings of calcium-rich food. Women with dietary 
calcium intakes of 400 to 650 milligrams a day made up the second group. 
</P>
<P>
The Recommended Daily Allowance for adults ages 25 and older is 800 milligrams 
a day, about four servings of a calcium-rich food. 
</P>
<P>
American women, however, rarely achieve the RDA for calcium through diet alone, 
Dawson-Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
Calcium is found in milk, yogurt, cheese, canned salmon and sardines, and dark 
green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, collard greens and kale. 
</P>
<P>
Each group was randomly divided into three subgroups: those who received 500 
milligrams of calcium carbonate, those who received 500 milligrams of calcium 
citrate malate and those who received a placebo. Bone measurements were taken 
in the neck, spine and forearm. 
</P>
<P>
The results showed that women who had undergone menopause five or fewer years 
earlier had significant bone loss that was unaffected by supplements in any 
form. 
</P>
<P>
At menopause, the female hormone estrogen, which helps protect against bone 
loss, begins to decline rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
"Among recently postmenopausal women, we found that the calcium supplementation 
didn't seem to matter," Dawson-Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
"The bone seems to be under such strong influence of the body's dropping 
estrogen level." 
</P>
<P>
But after about five years, the supplements appeared to prevent further bone 
loss in women deficient in calcium. 
</P>
<P>
"The study is encouraging because it suggests that calcium can help prevent 
bone loss, which has been disputed by some researchers," said Bonnie Liebman, a 
nutritionist for the Center for Science in the Public Interest in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think women who have recently undergone menopause should say, 'I'm not 
going to worry about calcium for five years.' " 
</P>
<P>
But Liebman said the study's findings that calcium citrate malate was more 
effective than calcium carbonate deserves follow-up study because the former is 
generally more costly and available only in Citrus Hill Plus Calcium fruit 
juices. 
</P>
<P>
The study does not reveal whether calcium carbonate would be more effective in 
higher doses or if taken with food, Liebman said (the subjects took the 
supplements without food). 
</P>
<P>
The study found women with lower dietary calcium intake who consumed calcium 
citrate malate had no significant bone loss. 
</P>
<P>
Women who received calcium carbonate maintained bone density in the hip and 
forearm but lost bone in the spine. 
</P>
<P>
The women on the placebo lost 2% to 3% of bone density at the hip, forearm and 
spine over two years. Among women with higher dietary calcium intake, there 
were no differences among subjects taking either form of calcium supplement or 
the placebo. 
</P>
<P>
"This fits with the idea that (supplementation) benefits those who are 
deficient," Dawson-Hughes said. "But more and more and more is not better and 
better and better. 
</P>
<P>
"Women in America, in this age range, have an intake of 475 milligrams a day. 
That's very little -- just over half the RDA -- of what they need," 
Dawson-Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would promote the use of calcium-rich foods as a first priority. When a 
woman is unable to meet the requirements by doing that, using supplements would 
be your second preferred route."

   Calcium Slows Bone Loss for Women

   Women who are more than five years past menopause need to
take in at least 800 milligrams of calcium a day to keep
their bone loss at a minimum, an experiment with more than
300 women found.
   Researchers said that calcium-rich foods, such as dairy
products, were the best way to boost calcium consumption. But
the experiment also found that a patented form of calcium
that Procter &amp; Gamble Co. puts into its Citrus Hill Plus
Calcium orange and grapefruit juices might be a better source
of calcium supplement than calcium carbonate tablets.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The experiment, reported in this week's New England
Journal of Medicine, was done by researchers at the
Department of Agriculture's Human Nutrition Research Center
on Aging, located at Tufts University in Boston.
   The major portion of the $1 million-plus cost of the
experiment was borne by the Agriculture Department, said Bess
Dawson-Hughes, the nutrition scientist who headed the study.
But, Dr. Dawson-Hughes said, the scientists also sought and
received funding and supplies from Procter &amp; Gamble.
   Dr. Dawson-Hughes said the experiment was launched to find
out if increasing calcium intake would have any effect on the
loss of bone that women experience after menopause. This bone
loss can lead to osteoporosis, in which the weakened bones of
older women tend to fracture.
   The researchers recruited 361 women over age 50 from the
Boston area; half of the women regularly ate diets that
contained less than 400 milligrams of calcium a day, while
the other half regularly ate diets higher in calcium.
   The women were asked to take two white tablets a day while
continuing their regular diet. For a third of the women, the
tablets were placebos made of inert cellulose. For another
third the tablets were calcium carbonate, sometimes called
oyster shell calcium, which is the most common form of
calcium supplement. Among the dozens of brands of calcium
carbonate are Os-Cal from Marion Laboratories Inc., a unit of
Dow Chemical Co., and Caltrate from the Lederele division of
American Cyanamid Co.
   The remaining third of the women took tablets of calcium
citrate maleate, Procter &amp; Gamble's patented compound which
is available commercially only in the company's Citrus Hill
juices. The Procter &amp; Gamble product was included in the
experiment because earlier studies showed it is more readily
absorbed into the blood than calcium carbonate, Dr.
Dawson-Hughes said.
   The calcium supplements had little or no effect in many of
the women. Periodic measurements of the density of the spine,
forearm and hip bones, for example, showed that the bone loss
that occurs in the first five years after menopause wasn't
stemmed by the calcium supplements. Similarly, women who
regularly consumed more than 400 milligrams of calcium in
their daily diet showed little benefit of the calcium
tablets.
   But in women who were more than five years past menopause
and who were habitually eating a low-calcium diet, the
calcium tablets did slow the rate of bone loss, the
researchers said. Both types of calcium slowed the thinning
of the hip and forearm bones. But only the Procter &amp; Gamble
calcium slowed the loss of bone from the spine, they
reported.
   National nutrition surveys indicate that nearly half the
women in the U.S. consume less than 500 milligrams of calcium
daily compared with the recommended consumption of 800
milligrams.

@  Calcium May Not Prevent Hip Fractures

   Consuming a lot of calcium may not prevent hip fractures in older people, a British study concluded. 

   The report, in this week's British Medical Journal, found physical activity offers greater protection than dietary calcium. 
The finding will reignite a protracted controversy over whether increased calcium intake helps avoid osteoporosis. 
The bone-loss disease is a leading cause of hip fractures in the elderly, especially for women. 

   Hip fractures in the elderly cost the U.S. more than $6 billion a year and cost Britain an estimated #300 million ($480.5 million) a year. 
Sales of calcium supplements have surged and sagged since 1984 amid a welter of conflicting evidence about the health benefits of gulping extra calcium. 

   The investigation of 1,419 British men and women showed "no evidence that the risk of fracture increased with declining dietary calcium," concluded a team of epidemiologists at England's Southampton General Hospital. 
The result seems to contradict a major U.S. study reported last November. 
In tracking 957 men and women aged 50 to 79 for 14 years, California scientists found those who later broke their hips had consumed less calcium than those who didn't. 
The study boosted sagging U.S. sales of calcium supplements. 

   But the California research was flawed, the British Medical Journal authors argued. 
With the latest report, doctors now may downplay the importance of calcium for older individuals while seeking greater calcium consumption among women in their 20s and 30s. 

   "The critical consumption of calcium, especially in women, is in the younger age groups before menopause," said Kurt Isselbacher, professor of medicine at Harvard University Medical School. 
Calcium supplement makers incorrectly have promoted their products for all age groups, he added, citing the new British study. 
"To give {calcium} to you at age 50 is really missing the boat. . . . 
It is a bit late." 

   Dr. Isselbacher is vice chairman of the U.S. National Academy of Science's Food and Nutrition Board, which sets recommended daily allowances for nutrients. 
On Oct. 24, the board will announce a revision in its recommended daily allowance of 800 milligrams of calcium for adults. 
Dr. Isselbacher indicated the board will urge a higher intake for younger women. 

   Some endocrinologists have advocated raising the overall recommended allowance to 1,000 milligrams a day -- the equivalent of three daily helpings of dairy products, the main dietary source of calcium. 
The calcium fad began in 1984 after a U.S. National Institutes of Health report urged women to consume between 1,000 milligrams and 1,500 milligrams a day. 
Women are more prone to develop osteoporosis because after menopause, the loss of natural estrogen hormones seems to speed the loss of bone mass. 

   For the British study, investigators tracked 1,419 men and women 15 years after a 1973-74 initial screening in which they were asked about their outdoor activities and they kept dietary records for seven days. 

   Forty-four participants subsequently fractured their hips. 
Calcium intake didn't influence their chances of suffering hip fractures, even after excluding other possible explanations such as smoking and weight, according to the report. 
But the least active patients, especially housebound ones, ran as much as a five times greater risk of breaking their hips. 

   Older Britons consume more calcium than Americans -- which may explain the disparity between the U.K. and U.S. studies, suggested Cyrus Cooper, a Southampton General Hospital epidemiologist who was one of the report's six authors. 
Among the hip fracture patients, men's average calcium intake was 870 milligrams a day, while women consumed an average of 730 milligrams a day -- more than twice the levels seen in the California study. 

   "Until you get to a very low level of calcium, you don't have to worry" about the need for calcium supplements, Dr. Cooper said. 
"If {the elderly} have two dairy portions a day, they don't need to pop calcium." 

   But on average, Americans aged 65 to 74 consume only slightly less calcium a day than their British cousins -- 698 milligrams for men and 542 milligrams for women, according to the U.S. Food and Nutrition Board. 
So, Dr. Isselbacher suggested, "I doubt {the new report} will end the debate" over calcium.

   Greater consumption of calcium could lower individuals' chances of fracturing their hips later in life, a California study suggests. 

   The report concludes the risk of broken hips in both men and women "might be reduced by even a moderate increase" in current U.S. recommended daily allowance of 800 milligrams of calcium for adults. 
The recommendation seems sure to revive a simmering medical debate over whether gulping extra calcium helps people ward off osteoporosis, a bone disease that is a leading cause of hip fractures in the elderly. 

   The study in this week's issue of the Lancet, a British medical journal, provides the strongest evidence yet of calcium's benefits in preventing hip fractures. 
In tracking 957 men and women in Rancho Bernardo, Calif., for 14 years, it found those who later broke their hips had consumed less calcium than those who didn't. 
Hip fractures in the elderly cost the U.S. more than $6 billion a year, the study estimated. 

   "Those are very exciting findings," said Dr. B. Lawrence Riggs, an endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. 
The work by University of California-San Diego researchers "is going to be a very important study." 
Dr. Riggs advocates raising the recommended allowance to 1,000 milligrams a day -- the equivalent of three daily servings of dairy products, the main dietary source of calcium. 
The U.S. National Academy of Sciences currently is reviewing the calcium recommended allowance, he added. 

   The California research may boost lagging U.S. sales of calcium supplements, which fell to an estimated $132 million last year from $176 million in 1986 because of advertising cutbacks, an overcrowded market and doctors' mounting disagreement over whether increased calcium consumption can retard osteoporosis. 
The calcium fad began in 1984, when calcium supplements sales totaled $87 million, after a National Institutes of Health report urged women to consume between 1,000 milligrams and 1,500 milligrams a day. 
Women are more prone to develop osteoporosis than men because after menopause, the loss of natural estrogen hormones seems to speed the loss of bone mass. 

   The Lancet study "has got to {help sales}, of course," said a spokesman for American Cyanamid Co.'s Lederle Laboratories division in Wayne, N.J. Lederle introduced a calcium supplement called Caltrate in 1984. 
The other leading maker of such supplements is Marion Laboratories Inc., based in Kansas City, Mo. 
But Warner-Lambert Co., a third U.S. drug manufacturer, yanked its two special calcium tablets off the market more than a year ago because "it was a difficult market to crack," a spokesman said. 

   And the latest research doesn't seem likely to alter Europeans' consumption of calcium any time soon. 
"In Europe, we don't recommend the huge amounts of calcium (consumption) which are recommended by some people in the United States," said Ian MacIntyre, a chemical pathology professor at London's Hammersmith Hospital. 
Even with the Lancet report, he added, "we think the evidence that calcium deficiency plays a role {in osteoporosis} is very fragile." 

   In the California study, researchers kept track of 426 men and 531 women between the ages of 50 and 79 years old. 
The participants described their average daily calcium intake and said they didn't have any history of hip fractures at initial examinations between 1973 and 1975. 
Thirty-three of the 957 since have fractured their hips -- typically after they reached age 75. 

   The hip fracture patients had reported consuming an average of 313.8 milligrams of calcium a day, compared with an average of 394 milligrams daily for those unaffected. 
The study examined and ruled out other possible explanations such as the use of alcohol, smoking and caffeine. 
"The only factor consistently and significantly associated with risk of hip fracture was dietary calcium," wrote Doctors Troy Holbrook, Elizabeth Barrett-Connor and Deborah Wingard, faculty members at the University of California-San Diego's department of community and family medicine. 

   In fact, their report noted, study participants who consumed more than 765 milligrams of calcium a day were 60% less likely to break their hips.

<HEAD>Researchers Say More Calcium Doesn't Prevent Bone Weakening</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bone-weakening osteoporosis cannot be
prevented by gorging on calcium-rich foods, University of Michigan
researchers said Thursday.
   ``We found that adults with high calcium intakes didn't lose
less bone and that adults with low calcium intakes didn't lose more
bone,'' said Stanley Garn, a professor of nutrition at the
university's School of Public Health.
   ``The more bone you have, the more you have to lose,'' he said
in a news release from the university. ``You don't create more bone
by stuffing calcium into young women any more than you create more
muscle by stuffing steak into football players.''
   The study was based on comparisons of X-ray measurements of 745
adult men's and women's hand bones taken from 1963-65 and again in
1985, the Ann Arbor university said. The subjects also reported
their eating habits, focusing on calcium and phosphorous intake.
   Osteoporosis, a softening of the bones, tends to begin with
women in their early 40s and with men in their 50s regardless of
their calcium intake, the researchers said in a study presented
Thursday at a joint meeting of the American Association of Physical
Anthropology and the Human Biology Council in Miami.
   The results were consistent with earlier studies in which Garn
and other researchers found that entire populations with high
calcium intake as part of their everyday diet suffered bone loss
comparable to groups eating a predominantly low-calcium, rice-based
diet.
   Dr. Richard Mazess, professor emeritus of medical physics at the
University of Wisconsin, endorsed the findings.
   ``They're entirely in accord with the rest of the scientific
evidence to date,'' Mazess said in a telephone interview. ``The
overwhelming evidence is that calcium has very little to do with
bone loss, except in people with marginal intake under 400
milligrams a day.''
   The average American's diet supplies 600-800 milligrams of
calcium daily, Mazess said. Calcium supplements might benefit those
receiving less, he said, but increasing consumption of dairy
products, the most common source of calcium, carries higher levels
of cholesterol and coronary risk.
   Exercise may help women prevent the disease, but the most
effective treatment is estrogen therapy beginning with menopause,
when the loss of bone mass tends to accelerate, Mazess said. ``It's
not a calcium-deficiency disease,'' he said.
   The Michigan study also found no relationship between cigarette
smoking, alcohol or the use of anti-hypertensive drugs and the
amount of bone loss.

Osteoporosis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Women can help prevent brittle bones in old age by
regularly consuming dairy products throughout their lives, but
calcium supplements taken after menopause probably won't be
effective, researchers say.
   In a study in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association, researchers said the key factors in bone density among
post-menopausal women were lifelong calcium intake and the naturally
occurring hormone estrone.
   Moderate exercise and calcium supplements taken later in life do
not appear to prevent osteoporosis, a frequently debilitating
disease most common among women in which the bones become thinner
and more brittle, they found.
   ``Swallowing calcium pills at 50 years of age probably is not
going to make your bones thicker,'' said Dr. Lewis Kuller, of the
Epidemiology Department at the University of Pittsburgh's School of
Public Health.
   Kuller, a co-author of the study involving 174 healthy
post-menopausal women over a four-year period, also said, ``There is
no evidence that moderate exercise in these women increased their
bone density.''
   ``The most important message ... is that an adequate calcium
intake during childhood, adolescence, post-adolescence and the
reproductive years is probably a very important part of good health
and will probably help prevent bone fracture and osteoporosis,'' he
said.
   Osteoporosis results in a loss of bone density and can lead to
bone fractures and spinal problems like dowager's hump. Some
estimates project that by age 70, one-quarter of the women in North
America will have suffered a fracture related to the disease.
   Kuller and his colleagues examined the relationship between bone
density and dietary calcium intake, calcium supplement use and blood
levels of estrone, the primary sex steroid hormone in women after
menopause. Estrone is a component of estrogen, a hormone combination.
   The study found that estrone was also a key factor in maintaining
bone density, a positive relationship that was not affected by
``age, time since menopause and the degree of obesity as well as
other potential bone determinants.''
   The researchers found that women who reported diets high in
calcium throughout their lives showed higher bone density. However,
observing little impact from use of calcium supplements after
menopause, the researchers concluded:
   ``In our analysis, the only group in which a protective effect of
calcium could be observed was in women who reported both a high milk
consumption during periods of growth and development, as well as
currently.''
   Kuller said the jury is still out on other methods of increasing
bone density and reducing fractures, but that estrogen therapy in
post-menopausal women ``probably reduces osteoporosis.''
   The study ``sounds like a reasonable observation supporting
what's either been partly known or widely suspected,'' Dr. Murray
Favus, director of the bone program at the University of Chicago's
Pritzker School of Medicine, said Thursday.
   Several recent studies have shown either no impact or minimal
impact of calcium supplements on bone density, and the role of
estrone has been shown to be important, he said.
   ``Most of those in the field now really question whether calcium
supplements taken after menopause are useful,'' Favus said.

<HEAD>Americans Don't Consume Enough Calcium, Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are getting only a third to half the
calcium they need, despite the ``calcium craze'' that sent people
running to drugstores for pills to supplement their diets.
   Much has been made of calcium in recent years because of
osteoporosis, the weakening of the bones, generally with age, due
to loss of calcium, declining levels of sex hormones, hereditary
factors and other things.
   Women generally become susceptible at menopause, men at a later
age. The disease is estimated to be responsible for more than 1
million hip fractures each year.
   A National Institutes of Health panel in 1984 recommended women
consume a gram to 1{ grams a day of calcium. Now, there are dozens
of supplements on the market, and manufacterers have enriched a
variety of foods with calcium.
   Still, there is no clear proof that calcium will prevent the
debilitating disease.
   ``It remains a very controversial subject,'' said Bess
Dawson-Hughes, an endocrinologist at the Calcium and Bone
Metabolism Laboratory at Tufts University's Human Nutrition
Research Center.
   The NIH panel said calcium won't hurt and there is ``a
reasonable chance it will help. That message got twisted to, `If
you take a gram to a gram and half you won't get osteoporosis,'''
she said.
   Several long-term studies are under way, she said. But until the
data is in, there are several variables, including whether calcium
affects people differently at different ages and whether it affects
different bones differently.
   ``Calcium appears to have a bright and exciting future in
preventive medicine,'' and is being studied for connections to
several diseases, Sheldon Saul Hendler wrote in ``The Doctors'
Vitamin and Mineral Encyclopedia.''
   But Americans get only a third to half the calcium they need for
good health, according to Hendler.
   Researchers from the University of Michigan last month presented
a study showing that eating calcium-rich foods does not prevent
osteoporosis. The researchers compared hand X-rays of men and women
taken in 1963-65 and again in 1985. The subjects also reported
their eating habits.
   ``Do not eat dairy products to prevent osteoporosis. Their
protein content can accelerate the loss of calcium from bones,''
Dr. Andrew Weil said in his book, ``Natural Health, Natural
Medicine.'' A better way to promote bone density is
weight-resistance exercises, he said.
   Calcium is needed to build strong bones and teeth and helps
regulate nerve and muscle function, among other things. Severe
deficiency can lead to abnormal heartbeat, dementia, muscle spasms
and convulsions, Hendler writes.
   Dairy products are the main source of calcium in the diet. For
those who are lactose intolerant or for other reasons don't eat
dairy, calcium can be had from kale or collard greens, molasses,
sesame seeds, salmon, broccoli, yogurt and tofu.
   A cup of milk has 290 milligrams of calcium; four ounces of tofu
contain 154 milligrams.
   Young women on weight-reducing diets often stop eating dairy
products, though skim milk is as good a provider of calcium as
whole milk. Bone mass development is at its peak from ages 18 to
25, yet surveys show that at least a quarter of the women in this
age group consume less than 300 milligrams a day of calcium.
   The average American's diet supplies 600 to 800 milligrams of
calcium a day, said Richard Mazess, professor emeritus of medical
physics at the University of Wisconsin.
   While there appears to be no major risk in following the NIH
panel's 1984 advice, Dawson-Hughes noted that if calcium is not
effective, research time and money should be used another way.
   Calcium supplements also cost money. ``So if it's not doing
anything, it's real important to know that,'' she said.

<LEADPARA>  Q Recently, while having my teeth cleaned, the dental hygienist told me that
sodium fluoride builds bone and helps prevent osteoporosis. Is this true?;   
A Yes and no, according to a report by the National Osteoporosis Foundation, a
Washington, D.C.-based health agency. Sodium fluoride is known to stimulate
the process of bone formation and thus build new bone. However, the report
says, the new bone may be irregular in structure, and there is concern about
its strength.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A recent study by the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has shown that
sodium fluoride increases spinal bone mass, but does little to reduce the
spinal fracture rate. Other studies have confirmed these findings. In
addition, many adverse effects may be associated with orally administered
sodium fluoride, including gastrointestinal discomfort (on occasion even
resulting in peptic ulcer disease) and some joint and muscle pain. A new
sustained-release sodium fluoride preparation appears not to be associated
with gastrointestinal problems, but its overall value in increasing bone mass
and preventing fractures is unproven.;    While sodium fluoride may have value
for some persons with established osteoporosis, the Osteoporosis Foundation
calls it an experimental agent and recommends that it be taken only under the
direction of an osteoporosis specialist with extensive experience in its use.;
   According to the Osteoporosis Foundation, currently accepted therapies for
osteoporosis include the female sex hormone estrogen and synthetic salmon
calcitonin.;    Calcium is a part of the overall therapeutic approach in the
prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. The Osteoporosis Foundation
cautions, however, that a high calcium intake will not protect against bone
loss caused by estrogen deficiency, and is not a substitute for estrogen
replacement therapy. An intake of at least 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day
is widely recommended for pre-menopausal women and for men, and at least 1,500
milligrams per day for post-menopausal women.;    Q My husband recently had a
stroke and is in a rehabilitation unit. Will he able to walk and take care of
himself when he comes home? I have my own health problems and won't be able to
lift him. What can I do?;    A While many patients do return to a useful life,
the length of stay in a rehabilitation unit and level of functioning at
discharge varies.;    At admittance to the rehabilitation unit, the patient
undergoes an evaluation by a physical occupational and speech therapists. The
interdisciplinary team sets goals and recommends a necessary length of stay.
The team will apprise you of your husband's progress and the level of
functioning he may reach at discharge. This is the time for you to ask
questions. A social worker should be available to help with any problems you
may have. Team members may also evaluate changes at necessary at home.;

NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: RESEARCHERS ASSAIL LACK OF CALCIUM IN WOMEN'S DIETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scientific community, including the National Research Council (NRC) and 
U.S. Surgeon Gen. C. Everett Koop, has a bone to pick with women who regularly 
fail to meet the Recommended Dietary Allowance of 800 milligrams of calcium or 
who do so by swallowing calcium tablets in lieu of low-fat foods. There is 
concern that the importance of continuously replenishing the body's supply of 
the mineral through dietary sources has been under-evaluated and overshadowed 
by the fear of fat in the diet. 
</P>
<P>
A report released earlier this month by the NRC stressed the need for young and 
adolescent women to increase their intake of dietary calcium. The Surgeon 
General's Report on Nutrition and Health, published last year, also addressed 
this topic. 
</P>
<P>
"Calcium is an essential nutrient," the NRC report stated. "It is necessary for 
adequate growth and skeletal development. Certain segments of the population, 
especially women and adolescents, need to make careful food choices to obtain 
adequate calcium from the food supply. The committee recommends that 
consumption of low- and nonfat dairy products and dark green vegetables, which 
are rich sources of calcium, can assist in maintaining calcium intake at 
approximately the RDA levels." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the report continues, "the potential benefits of calcium intake 
above the RDAs to prevent osteoporosis or hypertension are not well-documented 
and do not justify the use of calcium supplements." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Intake Drops 
</P>
<P>
Figures taken from the USDA's nationwide food consumption survey found that in 
1985 women between the ages of 19 and 34 managed to achieve only about 80% of 
the RDA of calcium from food sources. Calcium intake for women in the 35- to 
50-year-old age range, dropped to as low as 68% of the RDA -- which is itself 
under scrutiny for being too low. 
</P>
<P>
And since 1984, when a National Institutes of Health panel concluded that 
post-menopausal women needed twice the RDA of calcium and pre-menopausal women 
needed 1 1/2 times the RDA, supplement sales have "skyrocketed," USDA reports. 
</P>
<P>
To improve consumer intake of dietary calcium, researchers have launched a 
triple attack. They are re-emphasizing the importance of building bone during 
the formative years, noting that older women consuming less than half the 
calcium needed over a prolonged period can suffer a loss of nearly 5% of spinal 
bone per year. They are stressing that the female hormone estrogen has a 
significant role in bone loss. And they are citing the negative effects of 
meeting the recommended goal through supplementation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Best Insurance 
</P>
<P>
Research data indicates that taking extra calcium after menopause probably 
doesn't slow bone loss and building additional bone during youth -- when the 
soft tissue inside the bones is in a continuous state of development -- is the 
best insurance against osteoporosis later in life. 
</P>
<P>
This was underscored most recently when studies of high calcium intake in older 
rats were completed. The research was directed by Dr. James C. Smith, head of 
the Vitamin and Mineral Nutrition Laboratory at Beltsville, Md., part of the 
government's Agricultural Research Service. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a body of evidence that the best way is to build up the bones 
before menopause," Smith said in an interview, adding, "but I haven't worked 
with women." 
</P>
<P>
His investigation was conducted at the Beltsville lab by University of Maryland 
graduate students under the direction of Joseph H. Soares, nutrition professor. 
</P>
<P>
It is scientific fact that the body's ability to absorb calcium is variable 
with age. During typical periods of growth, intestinal absorption of calcium 
increases, with infants and children absorbing up to 60% of the calcium they 
ingest. Pregnant women use about 50% and other adults only retain about 30%. 
Calcium available from supplements is often even less, depending upon the 
binders used in the product, which can hold onto the calcium and prevent the 
body from using it. The ability of an individual's stomach acid to dissolve the 
supplements also is associated with malabsorption. 
</P>
<P>
And there are other factors: bone loss accelerates naturally after age 35 and 
becomes more and more difficult to retard with age; after menopause a steady 
decline of estrogen -- an important component in bone mineralization -- is 
observed, and the process of bone development appears to slow down as an animal 
ages, making the bones solid, more brittle and thus less efficient at storing 
calcium. 
</P>
<P>
(Ninety-nine percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth. 
But it is used for various bodily functions. These include: regulating cell and 
nerve functions, maintaining normal blood pressure, muscle contraction 
capabilities including maintaining heartbeat, clotting of blood and preserving 
the material that holds cells together.) 
</P>
<P>
"The high calcium intake did not affect bone dynamics in the aged female rats 
but increased bone formation in the young rats," said Rashmi Sinha, the 
nutritionist who conducted the study. "Just taking a lot of calcium later in 
life, without replacing the female hormones, is not going to increase bone 
formation as it does earlier in life." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risk of Cancer 
</P>
<P>
But estrogen replacement therapy is associated with an increased risk for 
endometrial cancer and requires ongoing medical follow-up, according to Dr. 
Bess Dawson Hughes, director of the Calcium and Bone Research Laboratory at the 
USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University. She is 
currently conducting a five-year study of 360 post-menopausal women to 
determine the benefit of taking calcium, how much is necessary to minimize bone 
loss and the potential hazards associated with calcium supplementation. 
Preliminary results indicate that with extremely low intakes of calcium -- 
below the current U.S. intake level of 600 milligrams -- there is some benefit, 
even without estrogen replacement therapy. 
</P>
<P>
"The study suggests that postmenopausal women most likely to benefit from 
increased calcium are those who consume less than 400 milligrams a day, the 
equivalent of 1 1/3 glasses of milk," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"If our research shows calcium can retard bone loss in some women regardless of 
estrogen, that's good news, because estrogen replacement therapy isn't for 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
Osteoporosis is the gradual loss of bone mineral from the skeleton, occuring in 
millions of American women (and some men), and it "goes on for many, many 
years," she said. It starts as early as age 20 and continues at a rate of 1% a 
year in women throughout their lives. The rate in men is about .25% per year. 
</P>
<P>
This deterioration typically starts out in the spine, and manifests itself as a 
compression fracture. It is a very common disorder, according to Dawson Hughes, 
who estimated that one out of every four white women over the age of 60 will be 
afflicted with the ailment. There are a number of factors that increase risk. 
</P>
<P>
Since women have less bone to start with and tend to lose it at a greater rate 
from their spines, being a female is the primary factor, said Dawson Hughes. 
Being either Asian or Caucasian is another. Family history has a role, as does 
a lifetime of low calcium intake. Early menopause, low body weight, sedentary 
life style, bearing no children, alcohol abuse, high sodium intake, cigarette 
smoking, high caffeine intake, high protein intake and high phosphorus intake 
are others. 
</P>
<P>
One conclusion that can be drawn is that younger women, who typically are 
deficient in calcium as well as iron, should adjust their diets to include at 
least three servings of dairy products and other calcium-rich foods per day, 
instead of relying on supplements. 
</P>
<P>
According to the National Dairy Board, a serving size is: 1 cup milk, 8 ounces 
yogurt, 1 1/2 ounces natural cheese or 2 ounces processed cheese. 
</P>
<P>
Drinking nonfat or low-fat milk is the most efficient way to accomplish this. 
One (8-ounce) serving of fluid nonfat milk provides about 90 calories, less 
than a gram of fat and 300 milligrams of calcium. The same size serving of 1% 
low-fat milk offers 102 calories, 3 grams fat and 300 milligrams calcium. 
One-cup of whole milk provides the most calories and fat for its calcium 
benefit -- 150 calories, 8 grams fat and 291 grams calcium -- while 2% low fat 
has just slightly less calories and fat: 121 and 5 grams fat for its 297 grams 
calcium. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meeting Dairy Requirement 
</P>
<P>
If drinking milk is not an option, here are some dairy and non-dairy foods 
which in combination can help meet the daily requirement: 1 ounce of low-fat 
cheese, such as part-skim mozzarella adds 200 milligrams calcium; 1 cup low-fat 
cottage cheese offers about 140 milligrams calcium, 1 cup low-fat fruit-added 
yogurt, 345; 3 ounces canned salmon with bones, 180, and 3 ounces sardines, 300 
milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
Dark leafy vegetables, in general, are rich in calcium, but some, such as kale, 
broccoli and beet greens, are the best absorbed. Other types, such as spinach 
and turnip greens, contain a naturally occuring calcium binder, which tends to 
hold on to the calcium. 
</P>
<P>
Some processed foods, because of fortification or a calcium-salt additive used 
in the manufacturing process, are also good sources of dietary calcium. These 
include tofu (bean curd), canned tomatoes, stone-ground or self-rising flour 
and blackstrap molasses. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to increasing low-fat sources of calcium in the diet, women are 
encouraged to develop a regular routine of exercise. This helps maintain bone 
mass and stimulates new bone formation. Although Dawson Hughes admits that the 
exact role of exercise in the maintenance of bone mass remains a little 
unclear, it appears that it is "very, very important." 
</P>
<P>
She said it apparently increased bone density in a studied population 
representing a cross section of women of all ages -- particularly those who 
previously were extremely sedentary. 
</P>
<P>
In another study, women who exercised for one hour, three times a week 
increased their bone mineral content by 1% over a one-year period. Those, who 
did not decreased their bone mineral content by the same amount. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took the balance on a daily basis," she explained, "the exercisers were 
gaining 42 milligrams of calcium for their bodies. You have about 100,000 
milligrams in your body, so that doesn't sound like much. But every day, day 
in, day out, that adds up . . . . It's a very effective means of impact on your 
bones." 
</P>
<P>
To help in designing a calcium-conscious life style, consider some of the 
following recipes, which are based upon a popular Oriental cooking ingredient 
and non-dairy substitute, bean curd.

   Women can help prevent brittle bones in old age by
regularly consuming dairy products throughout their lives, but
calcium supplements taken after menopause probably won't be
effective, researchers say.
   In a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
researchers said the key factors in bone density among
post-menopausal women were lifelong calcium intake and the naturally
occurring hormone estrone.
   Moderate exercise and calcium supplements taken later in life do
not appear to prevent osteoporosis, a frequently debilitating
disease most common among women in which the bones become thinner
and more brittle, they found.
   ``Swallowing calcium pills at 50 years of age probably is not
going to make your bones thicker,'' said Dr. Lewis Kuller, of the
Epidemiology Department at the University of Pittsburgh's School of
Public Health.
   Kuller, a co-author of the study involving 174 healthy
post-menopausal women over a four-year period, also said, ``There is
no evidence that moderate exercise in these women increased their
bone density.''
   ``The most important message ... is that an adequate calcium
intake during childhood, adolescence, post-adolescence and the
reproductive years is probably a very important part of good health
and will probably help prevent bone fracture and osteoporosis,'' he
said.
   Osteoporosis results in a loss of bone density and can lead to
bone fractures and spinal problems like dowager's hump. Some
estimates project that by age 70, one-quarter of the women in North
America will have suffered a fracture related to the disease.

 NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: YOGURT FILLS THE BILL AS LOW-CALORIE DAIRY INGREDIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Very low-calorie diets present a bit of a logistical problem for individuals 
who are also concerned about good bone health. 
</P>
<P>
While dairy foods are viewed as the best dietary source of calcium -- a vital 
component in bone mass maintenance -- they are typically perceived by dieters 
as too high in fat to be worth their calcium merit. 
</P>
<P>
This aversion to dairy products may be responsible for the escalating rise in 
osteoporosis in this country, which is the underlying cause of the nation's 1.3 
million bone fractures each year. Of those, 250,000 are fractures of the hip, 
according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
But the results of a study, conducted at the University of San Diego and 
published last year in the British medical journal Lancet, may underscore the 
importance of dietary calcium in reducing risk for osteoporosis and influence 
calorie-counters who may be avoiding rich sources of the mineral in an attempt 
to lose fat. 
</P>
<P>
At a Dairy Council of California nutrition press conference in Costa Mesa 
recently, Dr. Troy Holbrook, assistant adjunct professor of community and 
family medicine at UCSD, described calcium as estrogen's pre-menopausal equal 
in preventing hip fractures. Her 14-year study of calcium intake by men and 
women in Rancho Bernardo was the source of this data. 
</P>
<P>
It has been known for some time that women suffer from the bone-thinning 
disease at a disproportionately higher rate than men. And the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services estimates that osteoporosis afflicts more than 24 
million Americans each year, more than half of all women in this country older 
than 45 and 90% of those older than 75. 
</P>
<P>
In its classical manifestation, osteoporosis is seen as "a gradual, but 
increasing number of vertebral fractures as the spine begins to collapse on 
itself," said Holbrook. "When the process has progressed far enough, you see a 
decrease in height and the classic spinal hump." 
</P>
<P>
But hip fractures also are common and occur at very high rates among elderly 
white women in this country. Holbrook estimated that by the age of 80, some 
white women have a 1% to 2% annual risk of fracturing their hip. The estimated 
cost of hip fracture treatment alone was $6.1 billion a year in 1984, Holbrook 
said, and as many as one third to one half of those who suffer hip fractures 
never return to a functional level of activity. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1987, however, despite all this knowledge, a low-calcium diet 
was still considered only a "proposed risk factor" for osteoporosis, said 
Holbrook, which might explain a nationwide reluctance to meet the requirement 
through dietary sources. 
</P>
<P>
Holbrook's research undertook to establish low calcium intake as a known risk 
factor. This would place it among other established hazards including being 
female, being white, being thin relative to fat, consuming alcohol and certain 
drugs and being a sufferer of rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
Because calcium is withdrawn from the bones (where it is stored) when dietary 
intake is too low, decreased calcium intake was always a strong candidate for 
the risk factor list. The theory was that if during youth, calcium intake is 
increased, a heavier, more dense skeleton might develop. This could protect 
against fractures later in life, researchers surmised. 
</P>
<P>
While there is still considerable debate over the effects of increasing calcium 
in the diet of post-menopausal women -- whether or not it can prevent, or at 
best, retard bone loss without estrogen supplementation -- studies have 
indicated with some certainty that added calcium is of benefit to 
pre-menopausal women. 
</P>
<P>
The UCSD research verified this, reporting that risk could be reduced by as 
much as half. 
</P>
<P>
Based on what the participants in the Holbrook study said they ate during a 
24-hour recall period, she observed a distinct difference in the occurance of 
hip fractures between the low calcium consumers and the high. In both the men 
and the women, the chances of having a hip fracture declined as the intake of 
calcium went up. Her conclusion: Adequate dietary calcium intake is a valuable 
measurement of risk factor for osteoporosis later in life. 
</P>
<P>
"When we did this comparison, the only difference that we saw nutritionally 
between the hip fracture group and the non-hip fracture group was their intake 
of calcium," Holbrook stated. "No other dietary nutrient made any difference in 
men or women. The average level of calcium intake was much lower in those who 
got hip fractures," she explained, adding that the study was based on dietary 
intake and not supplementation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Good Place to Start 
</P>
<P>
From this, Holbook concluded that it is possible to obtain the Recommended 
Dietary Allowance of 1,000 milligrams of calcium a day from low-fat dairy 
sources as well as some others such as fish by making simple changes in eating 
habits. Adding nonfat or low-fat milk, yogurt and cheese to an otherwise 
balanced diet is a good place to start. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not impossible, (to meet the RDA for calcium)," Holbrook said. "You don't 
need to supplement, unless you have some other kind of health problem." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to replacing other mealtime beverages with milk and substituting 
yogurt for ice cream or other high-fat desserts, try using nonfat yogurt in 
place of mayonnaise when making creamy salad dressings, sandwich fillings and 
main dish, fruit or vegetable salads. Plain nonfat yogurt stands in nicely for 
sour cream when topping baked potatoes or when preparing dips, sauces and 
stroganoffs. It provides more calcium, and far fewer grams of fat, cholesterol 
and calories. 
</P>
<P>
One cup of milk provides about 300 milligrams of calcium. Some comparable 
servings of other calcium-rich, but low-fat foods are: one cup fruit-flavored 
low-fat yogurt, one-half cup ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 ounces part-skim mozzarella, 
one-half cup tofu processed with calcium sulfate and three ounces sardines.

EFFECT OF CALCIUM, EXERCISE, ESTROGEN IN PREVENTING OSTEOPOROSIS STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANCES GRANDY TAYLOR, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
HARTFORD, Conn. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the help of a color computer monitor and a machine called a dual photon 
absorptiometer, Gail Dalsky, an exercise physiologist, can tell women things 
about themselves they probably never knew, or even thought about. 
</P>
<P>
The machine measures bone density, yielding important information that can 
determine whether a person is at risk of developing osteoporosis, a potentially 
disabling disease that primarily strikes women after menopause. 
</P>
<P>
Osteoporosis is caused by the loss of bone density resulting from the sharp 
decline of estrogen production after menopause, which usually occurs between 
age 45 and 55. Bones are weakened and become susceptible to fracture. 
</P>
<P>
Dalsky and Dr. Jo-Anne Smith, director of the Osteoporosis Center at the 
University of Connecticut Medical Center in Farmington, are conducting a study 
on the effects of calcium, estrogen and exercise on bone density and are 
looking for evidence that osteoporosis can be prevented. The study is being 
conducted on women who had their final menstrual period more than three months 
earlier, but less than five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We know that estrogen stops bone loss. And we know that in certain 
populations, exercise will help to a small extent," said Dalsky, who has a 
doctorate in exercise physiology from Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. 
"What hasn't been done, especially in the early post-menopausal woman or in any 
study, is to use both treatments." 
</P>
<P>
While it is recommended that women get the recommended amount of calcium in 
their diet, taking calcium supplements alone will not prevent osteoporosis. 
When calcium supplements are combined with estrogen supplements, they seem to 
make the estrogen more effective in strengthening bone, Dalsky said. 
</P>
<P>
An unrelated study of osteoporosis by Yale University researchers shows that 
women taking the hormone Calcitonin by nasal spray are maintaining bone mass. 
</P>
<P>
The women in the University of Connecticut study will be placed in four groups. 
One group will receive calcium only, another will receive calcium and will 
exercise, another will take estrogen and calcium and the fourth will get a 
combination of calcium, estrogen and exercise, Dalsky said. The researchers 
hope to have 120 volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope that by combining exercise with the estrogen, a woman who is low in 
bone mass upon entry into the study can maintain her bone mass, and that with 
the combination of exercise and estrogen, we can reduce her risk of fracture by 
making her bones stronger. That's the goal," Dalsky said. 
</P>
<P>
The gradual loss of bone is painless until a fall or bump causes a fracture. 
Nearly 250,000 hip fractures occur each year that are related to osteoporosis, 
according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. These fractures can leave a 
person permanently disabled. 
</P>
<P>
The disease is also responsible for the "dowager's hump" that some elderly 
women have, which is the result of numerous small fractures of the vertebrae. 
Since bone is lost as a result of the aging process, men can also develop the 
disease, but for them it does not usually occur until they reach their late 70s 
or 80s. 
</P>
<P>
Bone density is measured using the dual photon absorptiometer. The patient lies 
flat on her back while a mechanical arm moves along her body, pausing at 
certain points. A camera emits a small amount of radiation, the same amount of 
background radiation that occurs naturally in this area. 
</P>
<P>
A computer printout shows the distinct outline of a hip bone socket known as 
the proximal femur, and another shows the lower vertebrae that intersect with 
the pelvis. These areas are of particular interest to the researchers. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the type of bone that is predominantly in the spine, it is more 
susceptible to the loss of estrogen," Dalsky said. "Often we will see decreases 
in the spine before we see decreases in another body part." 
</P>
<P>
Even though it is normal to lose some bone mass with age, she said, "in 
athletes and people who exercise, we've found they tend to have a higher bone 
density at the hip than they do at the spine. In people who don't exercise, the 
density in each is about the same. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, my bone density at the spine is 96-97% (normal), and at the hip 
it's about 10% above normal because I exercise," she said, adding that 
weight-bearing exercise such as walking, jogging, stair-climbing and 
weight-training have been shown to have beneficial effects on increasing bone 
mass. 
</P>
<P>
Dalsky said bones respond to exercise the same way that muscles do. "If a 
muscle isn't exercised, it atrophies. If it is exercised, it gets stronger and 
so does bone. It becomes stronger by adding more mineral to the bone," Dalsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our study is interested in not only keeping good bone in the spine, but also 
in the hip, because hip fracture is what causes a lot of disability in people. 
About 50% of people who suffer hip fractures do not resume a normal life. They 
are wheelchair-bound or unable to live alone, so we are interested in building 
bone, both at the spine and the hip," Dalsky said. 
</P>
<P>
There are other factors that are believed to make a person susceptible to 
osteoporosis, according to the osteoporosis foundation: Women who are thin and 
small-framed are at greater risk than heavier women. Women who experience early 
menopause may be more likely to develop osteoporosis than other women. Asian 
and Caucasian women are more prone to developing the disease than black women, 
although it is not known why. Calcium deficiency in childhood and early 
adulthood can also increase the risk. Heredity also plays a role. 
</P>
<P>
Angenette Rienow, 49, a financial secretary who lives in Farmington, Conn., is 
a volunteer in the University of Connecticut study, which began this past 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never had any health problems whatsoever, and the little I know about 
osteoporosis is that slender people are more affected, and I've been slender 
all my life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, she has had her bone density examined and her cholesterol checked. She 
has undergone stress tests on a treadmill to determine her level of fitness and 
kept a diary of her eating habits, and she is taking calcium supplements. In 
the next few weeks, she will be assigned to a test group. 
</P>
<P>
"I just thought this would be a good opportunity to find out my physical 
condition, as well as hopefully prevent (disease) from occurring," Rienow said. 
</P>
<P>
She is not particularly worried about developing the disease, and she has never 
known anyone who has it. "But I don't exercise at all. I hear all the things 
about the importance of exercising, and I am just not self-disciplined enough 
to do it. I'm hoping that I get in the exercise group because I really want to 
exercise. I'm a very committed person so if I get in the exercise group, I will 
be there three or four times a week to exercise." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said regular exercise for younger women will help keep bones strong, but 
she stressed that overdoing it can have serious ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
"We've all heard about women who exercise so strenuously that their menstrual 
periods stop for some time. And that's dangerous because they lose the 
protection of estrogen and they become susceptible to fracture much earlier in 
life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The study may ultimately show that women who use a moderate exercise program up 
to and beyond the age of menopause can offset bone loss. 
</P>
<P>
The women in the study will have a program of brisk walking and climbing stairs 
three times a week in a supervised setting, Smith says. "We have a feeling that 
will be enough to maintain bone mass, something that is definitely doable for 
women in that age range," she said.

What do such diverse things as teeth, bones, oyster shells, chalk,
limestone, marble and pearls have in common? Calcium. This mineral is
essential in maintaining bone density, nerve transmission, heart beat
regulation, muscle contraction and blood clotting.
Moreover, researchers are finding increasingly important roles for calcium,
notably with regard to heart disease. More than 95 per cent of the body's
calcium is in the bones.
One's need for calcium increases steadily through adolesence. Between the
ages of 20 and 40, calcium increases bone density and thickness.
Osteoporosis, or 'porous bones', is a gradual loss of structural minerals
(decalcification) which begins in adulthood and progresses with age.
If you are worried about osteoporosis, consider these measures:
Take regular exercise. A 20-30 minute walk three times a week will help to
keep your bones strong and healthy.
Don't smoke.
Have only moderate alcohol and coffee consumption.
If you are a woman, discuss estrogen hormonal replacement with your doctor.
Increase daily calcium intake. Calcium-rich foods include low-fat skimmed
milk, yoghurt, cheeses, leafy greens, canned salmon, sardines with bones,
kale, broccoli and tofu.
Avoid aluminium-containing antacids.
Avoid eating excessive protein.
If you feel that you are unable to get enough calcium, either because of
insufficient intake or excessive loss - through drinking of alcohol and
coffee - you could consider calcium supplements. However, as extra calcium
intake can be associated with kidney stones, check with your doctor before
beginning such a regime.

<HL> Boron, Long Used
As Water Softener,
May Harden Bones
---
Early Tests Indicate Element
May Play Important Role
In Fighting Osteoporosis

   Boron, an element long used as a water softener and mouthwash, apparently plays an important role in hardening bones and could help prevent osteoporosis, the Agriculture Department said. 

   A six-month study measuring the effects of boron in the diets of 12 postmenopausal women showed that the element reduced the loss of calcium, magnesium and phosphorus, and raised blood levels of estrogen and other hormonal steroids. 

   These elements and hormonal steroids "are important in maintaining the integrity of the bone," said Forrest H. Nielsen, a nutritionist with the department's Agricultural Research Service which conducted the study. 
"In fact," he added, "estrogen replacement is currently the only proven therapy for osteoporosis." 

   Curtiss D. Hunt, a Research Service anatomist said of the study -- the first to examine the nutritional effects of boron in humans -- that he "suspects that the body needs boron to synthesize estrogen, vitamin D and other steroid hormones and it may also protect these hormones against rapid breakdown." 

   The researchers said they will test the theory in two more human studies scheduled to begin in a few months. 

   The researchers said that boron isn't considered essential for people and there is neither a recommended intake amount nor any boron supplements on the market. 

   They said, however, that boron in large doses -- at least 45 grams in adults, two grams in infants -- can be lethal. 
In the study, the women were given a very low boron diet, then fed a diet including a supplement of 3 milligrams of boron a day, the amount in a well-balanced diet. 

   The researchers suggested that people can get ample boron -- up to five milligrams a day -- by eating a lot of fruits, nuts, leafy vegetables and legumes. 
Grains contain a small amount of the element while meat, fish and dairy products contain hardly any, the researchers said. 

   Osteoporosis affects as many as 20 million older Americans, mostly women, according to the National Institutes of Health. 
Each year, the condition is responsible for about 1.3 million fractures. 

   Mr. Hunt said, "We aren't close to conducting clinical trials of boron supplements, nor are we ready to recommend food suplementation at this time." 

   If subsequent trials support the researchers' finding, food companies will no doubt seek to jump on the boron bandwagon. 
But initial response to the study was guarded. 

   A spokesman for Chicago-based Quaker Oats Co. said: "We aren't aware of the study, and it would be premature to speculate about what we might do as a result. 
But we're anxiously waiting to read it." 

   The results were reported in the November issue of The FASEB Journal, a new publication of the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology.

   Calcium Supplement in Some P&amp;G Juices
   Strengthens Children's Bones, Study Says

   A patented calcium supplement found in some Procter &amp;
Gamble Co. juices builds bone density in children, according
to a study funded by P&amp;G and the National Institutes of
Health.
   Researchers at Indiana University's School of Medicine
said the first two years of a three-year study on the calcium
supplement show that adding it to children's diets could help
them avoid bone fractures and diseases later in life.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The results, to be released today, confirm what many
scientists and consumers already knew: calcium builds bones.
But this research shows a link between childhood diets and
bone mass.
   Marketers are skeptical, however, that the results will
help the consumer products giant's Citrus Hill brand juices,
which trail in third place in market share behind Minute Maid
and Tropicana.
   "This won't set the world on fire," said Michael Bellas,
president of Beverage Marketing Corp. Added Tom Pirko,
president of Bevmark Inc., a management consulting firm:
"They may be able to make more claims about their juice, but
it's not like they're rediscovering oat bran."
   Besides, P&amp;G launched its calcium-enriched juices three
years ago and it hasn't made a big difference in P&amp;G's share
of the juice market. "People aren't enthralled," Mr. Pirko
said.
   The study, funded by P&amp;G and the National Institutes of
Health, was conducted on 50 sets of identical twins, from
five to 14 years old. Testing twins eliminates genetic
differences and helps control other factors, like environment
and diet.
   Each twin ate a daily diet containing about 900 milligrams
of calcium. One twin also received a 1,000 milligram tablet
of the calcium supplement each day. The preliminary results
show substantial improvements in bone density in the forearm
of the twin receiving the supplement. Precise measures of the
improvement weren't available because the tests will continue
for another year, researchers said.
   The only place this supplement is found is in P&amp;G's Citrus
Hill Plus Calcium juices. To get the same dose, consumers
would have to drink three, six-ounce servings a day.
   Previous research had already indicated that the
supplement is more fully absorbed than calcium carbonate, a
common calcium supplement, said Judy Z. Miller, associate
professor of medicine at Indiana University.
   "Calcium is calcium," she said. "But this supplement makes
more calcium available to the body."
   Others were skeptical of the supplement's impact on
disease, such as osteoporosis, a brittle bone disease that
affects about 20 million people in the U.S. "Children that
get supplemental calcium or a high-calcium diet, regardless
of the source, will end up with denser bones," said James
Simon, a reproductive endocrinologist at Georgetown
University. "Any extrapolation on the risks of osteoporosis
{later in life} is unwarranted."
   P&amp;G officials said they don't have immediate plans to
launch new promotions of the Citrus Hill products or to
introduce new products containing the supplement.

An experimental treatment that promotes bone growth appears to strengthen the 
backbones of women who have suffered spinal fractures due to osteoporosis, 
researchers reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment involves giving patients a slow-release form of sodium fluoride 
-- the compound dentists use to fight tooth decay -- and calcium supplements, 
said Dr. Charles Y. C. Pak, chief of mineral metabolism at the University of 
Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. His findings are being published 
in the January issue of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism. 
</P>
<P>
The results indicate that "intermittent sodium fluoride therapy is safe and 
produces objective and clinical improvement in patients with osteoporosis," 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
Spinal osteoporosis is a condition of progressive bone loss that affects 5 
million Americans -- primarily older women. The most severely afflicted are at 
greatly increased risk for spinal fractures and hip fractures; some are 
confined to wheelchairs or can only walk with assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"The treatment is intended to make the existing bone stronger but it cannot 
correct already fractured bone," Pak said at a news conference. "The hope is 
that it will make the remaining bone strong enough so it could withstand 
further fractures." 
</P>
<P>
The treatment attempts to reverse the loss of so-called spongy bone that makes 
up the vertebrae of the spinal column. Pak said he does not think the fluoride 
therapy will be of major value in patients with fractures of the hip or other 
long bones since they contain very little spongy material. 
</P>
<P>
Pak explained that other commonly used osteoporosis treatments, such as 
estrogens and calcium supplements, were useful in preventing the development of 
bone loss if they were begun during the early phase of menopause. But they are 
of limited value for individuals who have already sustained substantial bone 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
Pak's research team measured the effects of the new therapy on 38 
post-menopausal women with osteoporosis, and six men; the mean duration of 
treatment was about three years. 
</P>
<P>
"We have seen an average of 3% to 6% a year increase in (spinal) bone and a 
continued increase every year," he said. The treatment also appeared to 
decrease the frequency of spinal fractures.

FOOD PHARMACY: OMEGA-3'S EFFECT ON ARTHRITIS STUDIED

Does eating fish oils actually help people with rheumatoid arthritis? There's 
new evidence it can, says Dr. Joel Kremer, associate professor of medicine, 
Albany (N. Y.) Medical College and a leading expert in the field. 
</P>
<P>
In his study of 49 people with rheumatoid arthritis, those taking fish oil 
daily for six months showed improvement on 24 different measurements; for 
example, they had fewer tender and swollen joints and less pain and fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, according to Kremer, three other recent studies -- from Harvard, 
Australia and the Netherlands -- confirm the arthritis-fighting activity of 
fish oils. 
</P>
<P>
Fish oil acts as an anti-inflammatory agent but it also benefits the immune 
system directly, Kremer found. 
</P>
<P>
The big question for Kremer now is to find the best dosage. In his new study, 
higher doses of five or six grams of fish oil daily were more effective than 
two or three grams. Five to six grams equal seven to nine ounces of raw 
Atlantic mackerel. 
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, in the study, olive oil also helped relieve some symptoms of 
rheumatoid arthritis for unknown reasons. But it was not as effective as fish 
oil, says Kremer. 
</P>
<P>
When you reduce cholesterol, you may get an unexpected bonus: lower blood 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors have long suspected a physiological connection between high cholesterol 
and high blood pressure. But how it might work was a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
Now Swiss investigators have come up with a surprising new theory. On the basis 
of new studies, they claim that LDL cholesterol -- the bad type -- actually 
packs a double whammy in heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
It's already known that LDL cholesterol helps clog arteries. But Agapios 
Sachinidis, a biochemist at University Hospital, Zurich, now says LDL 
cholesterol also can act like a hormone that directly triggers rises in blood 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Too much salt could help destroy bones. 
</P>
<P>
That's what New Zealand researchers have found. Eating a high-sodium diet 
caused a group of nine elderly women to excrete nearly 30% more calcium. The 
calcium, therefore, was not available to be deposited in their bones. This 
could be detrimental at any age but especially to elderly women who are at high 
risk of bone fractures and the osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, researchers first put the women on a low-salt diet (1,600 
milligrams of sodium daily) then switched them to a high-salt diet (3,900 
milligrams daily). Although they ate the same amount of calcium on both diets, 
one-third more of it was eliminated from the body during the high-salt diet. 
</P>
<P>
In another study, researchers found that not only women but men tend to lose 
bone mass as they age and therefore are also vulnerable to osteoporosis. The 86 
men in the study at the Oregon Health Sciences University ate a large amount of 
calcium and took a calcium supplement. Yet they still lost bone at a 
substantial rate (2.3% a year), notably in their vertebrae.

<HEAD>Osteoporosis Strikes Men, Though Not As Often As Women</HEAD>

   Osteoporosis, though most common among women, also
affects men and may be associated with alcoholism, a hormone
deficiency, or both, says a new report.
   The disease, in men and women, can lead to injuries such as hip
fractures that cause ``big public health costs, mortality and
disability,'' said Dr. C. Conrad Johnston, an endocrinologist at the
Indiana University School of Medicine.
   ``Traditionally, osteoporosis is considered a disease of women,
but it affects men too,'' said Johnston. ``It is a problem that
involves older men, and as men live longer, it will become a bigger
health problem.''
   His findings were published in Friday's issue of the Journal of
the American Medical Association.
   Dr. Murray J. Favus, an endocrinologist and director of the bone
program at the University of Chicago, said research suggests that by
age 70, one-quarter of the women in North America will have
sustained a fracture related to osteoporosis.
   Probably fewer than 10 percent of the known cases of osteoporosis
are among men, though ``I'm sure there is a lot more of it out there
than we see,'' he said Thursday, adding there has not been much
research on osteoporosis in men.
   Osteoporosis results in a loss of bone density and may be
accompanied by increasing porosity and brittleness. Most common in
women, it can lead to spinal crush fractures that cause dowager's
hump and pain, said Johnston.
   ``Men have more bone mass than women at maturity, and they do not
have the accelerated loss associated with menopause,'' said Johnson.
``So they have two advantages _ more bone to start with and not
losing as much.''
   Favus said a lack of estrogen following menopause is the main
factor in osteoporosis in women, but with men, often ``we don't know
the cause.''
   Johnston said spinal crush fractures are six to seven times more
common in women, but hip fractures are only about twice as common in
women.
   ``The hip fracture is the one that produces the big public health
costs, mortality and disability,'' said Johnston.
   He said there seem to be more secondary causes of osteoporosis in
men, particularly alcoholism and a lack of the hormone testosterone.
Smoking also can increase the risk of osteoporosis, Johnston said.
   If secondary causes are treated or ruled out, doctors should make
sure patients have an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D,
along with exercise, said Johnston.
   ``Osteoporosis is silent ... there is no clue until they fracture
something,'' said Favus. ``There needs to be more awareness (about
osteoporosis) among physicians and among men.''

   Men lose roughly 2 percent of their
existing bone mass per year in the same type of loss that can
severely affect women after menopause, a study indicates.
   ``There is a problem with osteoporosis in men that hasn't been
appreciated. It's a problem that needs to be recognized and
addressed,'' said Dr. Eric Orwoll, who led the study by the Oregon
Health Sciences University.
   Men apparently suffer gradual bone loss throughout their lives,
compared with women, who often suffer a marked increase in bone
loss after they reach menopause, Orwoll said in an interview
Tuesday.
   Researchers believe bone loss in women is related to the
decrease in estrogen levels associated with menopause but no one
has studied whether hormonal levels also affect bone loss in men,
he said.
   ``The major point of our study was that, contrary to popular
belief, there is significant bone loss in men as they grow older,''
Orwoll said.
   The study was published in the Jan. 1 issue of the Annals of
Internal Medicine.
   The three-year study, which Orwoll said was the first of its
kind nationally, measured the loss of bone from the lumbar
vertebrae, or the lower spine, and the forearm. The 77 men studied
ranged in age from 30 to 80.
   The bone loss was detected at all ages and the 2 percent rate
did not appear to vary, Orwoll said.
   ``If you think of that relatively simplistically, you wouldn't
have any bone left after 50 years,'' Orwoll said. ``The key is
existing bone mass. That means a man may lose half of his vertebral
bone mass in a lifetime.
   ``That's pretty dramatic, and as yet pretty speculative, so I
don't want to leave the wrong impression,'' he added.
   Orwoll said that the skeleton is constantly being broken down
and rebuilt, which doctors call ``remodeling.'' Eventually, the
entire skeleton is rebuilt several times during a lifetime, he said.
   ``The problem in bone loss is that not enough new bone is put
back when old bone is taken up,'' Orwoll said.
   He said that calcium and vitamin D supplements given some of the
men in his study did not slow the bone loss. However, Orwoll
pointed out that all the men in the study were healthy and
well-nourished, which could mean that calcium supplements may help
men with poor diets.
   The major effect of bone loss is to increase the brittleness of
bones, making them easier to break, he said.
   ``Fractures definitely increase,'' Orwoll said. ``If you look at
the data on broken hips, the incidence goes up dramatically for
women from age 50 to 60.''
   Women generally suffer twice as many hip fractures as men, he
said, but men are increasingly prone to fractures as they reach
their 70s and 80s.

<LEADPARA>  THE TREND to make reduced-calorie foods with even fewer calories has hit the
hot beverage aisle. In addition to sugar-free and lite cocoa mixes, Carnation
and Swiss Miss now offer new diet hot cocoa mixes. These diet cocoas
contribute a mere 20 or 25 calories per serving (6-ounce cup) compared with
the sugar-free versions with 50 calories. Regular hot cocoa mixes have 110
calories per serving.;    Both mixes are low in fat. Since non-fat dry milk is
the primary ingredient, they also are essentially cholesterol free. On the
other hand, neither offers much to enhance your diet.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The nutrition labels show each packet of both brands contribute 8 percent
of the U.S. RDA for calcium. In this case, 8 percent equals 80 milligrams of
calcium. This is a small fraction of the recommended 800 milligrams of calcium
per day for adults over 25 and insignificant compared to the 1,200 milligrams
recommended for 11- to 24-year-olds.;    A calcium-poor diet during the years
bones are maturing is believed to be one of the factors contributing to the 15
million to 20 million cases of osteoporosis (thinning of the bones) in the
United States. Women often have inadequate levels of calcium in their diets.
Young women, 17 to 25 years old, who are dieting by avoiding dairy products or
who regularly select low-calcium beverages (such as these diet cocoas), could
be especially vulnerable to developing osteoporosis later in life.;    Both
brands are too high in sodium for anyone with high blood pressure.;    If you
choose to use these very low-calorie cocoa mixes, acknowledge them for what
they are: a flavored hot beverage with virtually no nutritional value.;   
Swiss Miss Diet Cocoa Mix makes two nutrition claims deserving attention. The
first tells us it is made with "nutritious non-fat milk." Non-fat milk is an
excellent source of calcium and high quality protein. However, the small
amount of calcium indicates that one serving contains hardly enough non-fat
milk to matter.;    Swiss Miss' claim that its Diet Hot Cocoa Mix is 99.9
percent caffeine free is mathematically accurate, but inappropriate. Since
even very small amounts of some food constituents have an impact on our
health, they should not be presented as a percentage of the weight of the food
they are in. Caffeine is one of those.;    I would rather see caffeine listed
in milligrams. Cocoa has little caffeine with only about 6 milligrams in a
6-ounce serving compared with 100 to 150 milligrams in a cup of brewed
coffee.;    Carnation makes no nutrition claims for its new Diet Hot Cocoa
Mix, but only tells us to "treat yourself to rich, delicious hot cocoa without
worrying about calories." Twenty-five calories are not much for a single cup,
but the mix certainly is not calorie-free. An extra 25 calories a day for a
year could potentially put on an additional 2 1/2 pounds of body fat.;    The
nutrition label on the Carnation Hot Cocoa Mix is very poor. The required
information is included, but I think the type style and format are especially
hard to read.;  Swiss Miss Diet; Hot Cocoa Mix; (star); Serving size 1

women who have gone through menopause immediately start taking extra vitamin
D.;   "It's a small price to pay, especially for the elderly who may need the

USDA study is the first to find that the loss is correctable, Abruzzo said.;  
Debate goes on; The findings come as physicians continue to debate whether
additional calcium and hormone therapy can prevent bone loss.;   Sunlight
activates vitamin D in the skin and enables the body to absorb calcium, needed
for strong bones. Researchers believe winter's shorter daylight hours play a
role in seasonal bone loss.;   When the body doesn't have enough calcium, the
bones, particularly the spine, weaken and can lead to osteoporosis.  </TEXT>

<TEXT>     They found they were able to predict which women would have the thinnest
bones in 1989 from the 1977 measurements, Dr. Marc A. Hansen of Glostrup
Hospital at the University of Copenhagen reported in the current British
Medical Journal.;    High-risk measures; "One baseline measurement of bone
mass combined with a single estimation of the rate of bone loss can reliably
identify the women at menopause who are at highest risk of developing
osteoporosis later in life," Hansen wrote.;   One in four American women over
age 65 will develop osteoporosis, according to Joseph Zerwekh of the
University of Texas Medical Center in Dallas.;   About 250,000 spinal
fractures due to osteoporosis occur each year, he said.;   The long, slow
process of bone loss in women starts at about age 30 or 35, according to
Zerwekh. Until then, a woman's bone mass increases.;   Bone thinning
accelerates after menopause because the body stops producing the hormone
estrogen, which has a protective effect on bone.;   Women nearing menopause
should have a spinal bone test, especially if their mother or grandmother had
osteoporosis, Zerwekh said.;   Repeat tests for some; Menopausal women who
score normal or high-normal on their first bone measurement should have a
repeat test performed three or four years later, he said.;   "If you have a
low bone mass as you enter menopause, you can take steps to slow down the bone
loss," Zerwekh said.;   Estrogen replacement therapy and calcitonin hormone
treatment both slow the rate of bone loss, he said.;   Sodium fluoride
stimulates the cells that make bones but has not been approved by the Food and
Drug Administration, he added.;   Premenopausal women can slow their bone loss
by taking calcium supplements, Zerwekh said.;   Bone mass measures are done
with X-ray like machines while urine tests are used to measure the levels of
bone minerals.;   Tests called single or dual photon absoptiometry, or a CT
scan, are most commonly used to measure bone density.;   The radiation
involved is probably less than that involved in a mammogram, according to
Zerwekh.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Researchers Say New Treatment Reverses Bone Loss</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A substance dentists have long used to strengthen
teeth is a key part of a new treatment that appears to safely curb
spinal osteoporosis, a progressive bone disorder afflicting some 5
million Americans, researchers say.
   University of Texas Southwestern Medical School researchers on
Thursday announced results from a seven-year trial of the new
treatment.
   Doctors say spinal osteoporosis results from a gradual loss of
trabecular bone, found primarily in the spine. It most commonly
affects elderly women and results in shortened stature, curvature of
the back and a protruding abdomen that can cause back pain and
digestive discomfort.
   The treatment employs a slow-release form of sodium fluoride, a
compound used by dentists to strenghthen teeth which _ when given
with calcium citrate _ can reverse the effects of osteoporosis by
adding bone mass, said Dr. Charles Pak, mineral metabolism chief at
Southwestern Medical Center.
   Pak said fluoride has been available as an osteoporosis treatment
for decades but caused serious side effects, including corrosion of
the stomach lining, painful swelling of the joints and stress
fractures.
   ``These complications have precluded the long-range acceptance of
use of fluoride in the United States,'' said Pak. ``Our treatments
have been designed to overcome these problems.''
   In the new treatment, fluoride is encapsulated in a waxy pill
that allows it to bypass the stomach before much of the compound is
released. That helps alleviate gastrointestinal discomfort and
allows the fluoride to be absorbed slowly into the blood, at an
effective but not toxic rate, Pak said.
   Each year, an estimated 500,000 people suffer osteoporosis spine
fractures, and a third of women over age 65 will have spinal
fractures during their lives, the Southwestern researchers said.
   ``Treatments such as estrogen and calcium supplements, which are
directed at preventing bone loss, are useful in averting the
development of osteoporosis when they are applied early, such as
during the early postmenopausal period,'' said Pak. ``But they have
limited value in patients with established osteoporosis, who have
already sustained a substantial bone loss. Our treatment is directed
toward the latter group.''
   Pak said the treatment, which has been conducted on experimental
basis at 10 hospitals around the country, does not reverse spinal
curvature or other damage, but does increase bone mass and forestall
further breakage.
   He said it cannot be used by people who have sustained hip
fractures because of differences in the makeup of hip bones.
   Pak said he plans to apply to the federal Food and Drug
Administration in April for approval of the treatment. An FDA review
usually takes nine months to 2{ years, he said.
   The new drugs promise to increase the availability and usability
of osteoporosis treatments, said Dr. Lawrence Raisz, director of
endocrinology and metabolism at the University of Connecticut.
   ``Everybody is anxious to have a treatment approved by the FDA,''
Raisz said.
   The new drugs were developed by Pak and a team of researchers
with the help of the Mission Pharmacal Co. of San Antonio.
   Since 1982, the group has tested the treatment on 251 patients in
Dallas, Fort Worth, Temple and Tyler, Texas; Charleston, S.C.;
Cleveland and Indianapolis.
   Less than 5 percent of patients at Southwestern experienced
gastrointestinal problems when treated with fluoride for an average
of 3.5 years, and about 6 percent complained of joint pain.
   Pak said findings were similar at the other hospitals. Patients'
spinal bone mass gained 3 percent to 6 percent each year.
   The studies were sponsored by Southwestern, the General Clinical
Research Center there funded by the National Institutes of Health,
and the National Institute for Arthritis, Musculoskeletal and Skin
Diseases.

<TEXT>
   A major dietary study suggests that humans
are a vegetarian species whose risk of disease is increased by
eating meat and animal products, says a Cornell University
researcher.
   A plant-based diet is more likely to promote good health and
reduce the risks of heart problems, cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis
and other diseases, according to the preliminary findings of the
continuing study in China.
   ``People who eat mostly plant foods and a generous variety of
plant foods ... that is the kind of diet that is most likely to be
associated with reduced risk of the kinds of disease that tend to
kill us in this country,'' said T. Colin Campbell, a nutritional
biochemist who directed the continuing study.
   Other dietary studies reached similar conclusions focusing on
one aspect of a specific disease or on individual foods or
nutrients, but none has taken such an extensive look at ``the total
dietary pattern effect,'' said Campbell.
   ``Animal foods, in general, are not really helpful and we need
to get away from eating them,'' he said.
   Only in the last few thousand years have meat and animal
products become staples of our diet. ``That's not nearly enough
time to evolve new mechanisms to give us protection from those
kinds of foods,'' said Campbell, who is writing a book on the
reasons humans have turned into carnivores.
   The study began in 1983 to explore dietary causes of cancer but
was expanded to include heart and metabolic diseases and a variety
of infectious diseases. Aiding Cornell in the study are scientists
from the Chinese Academies of Preventive Medicine and of Medical
Sciences and the University of Oxford.
   Scientists surveyed 6,500 Chinese, each of whom contributed 367
facts about their diet. The preliminary findings will be reported
in a 900-page monograph to be published next month by Cornell
University Press.
   Campbell said there were several provocative findings regarding
proteins, fat and cholesterol among the roughly 8,000 correlations
that were found statistically and biologically significant in the
study.
   The study found that the Chinese consume one-third less protein
than Americans and that only 7 percent of their protein comes from
animal sources, compared with 70 percent for Americans.
   ``The dietary guidelines that have been formulated in the West
rather incorrectly protect our intake of animal protein.
Consumption of animal protein itself also raises the risk of cancer
and heart disease,'' he said.
   Previous studies have urged reducing dietary fat to less than 30
percent of an individual's daily caloric intake to curb the risk of
heart disease and cancer. But the Chinese study suggests that fat
should account for a maximum of 20 percent _ and preferably only 10
to 15 percent _ of calories.
   Campbell said the Chinese consume 20 percent more calories than
Americans do, but Americans are 25 percent fatter. That's because
Chinese eat about a third of the fat that Americans do and twice as
much starch.
   The study also found that the Chinese had a lower cholesterol
level than Americans, who consume more animal foods and dairy
products. Cholesterol levels in China ranged from 88 to 165
milligrams per 100 milliliters of blood plasma, while the U.S.
range extended from 155 to 274 milligrams.
   In addition to reducing the risk of heart disease, low
cholesterol also protects against colon cancer, the most common
life-threatening cancer among Americans, Campbell said.
   The Chinese diet contains three times more dietary fiber than
Americans', yet the study found no evidence that the high fiber
level interfered with the absorption of essential minerals, such as
iron.
   Campbell said the study showed that Americans don't have to eat
meat to prevent iron-deficiency anemia. The average Chinese adult
consumes twice as much iron as an American adult.
   People also don't need animal products to prevent osteoporosis,
a bone disease resulting from a lack of calcium. Campbell said the
study showed that people need less calcium than previously thought
and that the Chinese received enough from vegetables.
   The findings are only the beginning of the study's benefits,
said Campbell. The second phase of the research involves
resurveying the original participants and including people from 12
counties in Taiwan, which Campbell said is a dietary intermediate
between China and the United States.

however, at different places," said Miriam E. Nelson, assistant professor of
nutrition at Tufts. The study was published in the May issue of the American
Journal of Clinical Nutrition.;    Nelson said dairy products are better than
calcium pills because they have sugars that aid the absorption of calcium.
Vitamin D, often added to milk, also aids calcium absorption, she said.;   
Exercise, blood pressure;  Male couch potatoes take heart: You may not have to
do much more than walk and climb a few stairs to lower your blood pressure if
it's just a little too high.;    A University of Connecticut study of men with

dramatically lowered the blood pressure of those whose blood pressure was
mildly elevated.;    "In terms of exercise's beneficial effects, more intense
exercise is not necessarily better," wrote Linda S. Pescatello, an exercise
physiologist at the university in Farmington, Conn. The study appears in the
May issue of Circulation, a journal of the American Heart Association.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Researchers Find Link Between Sex Hormones and Skeletal System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli researchers have found a link between
sex hormones and the skeletal system of animals, opening the way to
a better understanding of osteoporosis, the Weizmann Institute of
Science said Sunday.
   The findings could help explain the high incidence of the
degenerative bone disease in women following menopause, a statement
from the institute said.
   The institute discovered in recent experiments with laboratory
rats that the skeletal system responds to the animal's main sex
hormone, the institute's statement said.
   Osteoporosis is characterized by increased porousness and
brittleness in bones associated with the loss of calcium. It leads
to an increased risk of fracture.
   An estimated 15 to 20 million people suffer from the disease in
the United States alone, resulting in an annual total of 1.3 million
fractures with a mortality rate of 5 to 14 percent, according to
figures from the institute. There is no known cure, only methods of
slowing the progress of the disease.
   Although sex hormone deficiency has been associated with
osteoporosis and such hormones have been used for treatment, the
disease was believed to result from processes only indirectly
related to hormone deficiency, said institute spokesman Nehemiah
Myers.
   The research team was led by Professor Alvin M. Kaye of the
institute's hormone research and included his associates from Tel
Aviv University.
   The study is to be published in the ``Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences of the United States.''
   The research shows that bones of female rats respond biologically
to the female hormone estrogen but are unaffected by its male
counterpart, testosterone. In male rats, bone tissue is stimulated
selectively by testosterone.
   But Kaye added: ``the situation in bones is quite complex, and
the stimulatory effects of estrogen and testosterone here are
closely linked to other factors,'' including the level of vitamin D
metabolites.
   ``The interdependence of these reactions could help explain why
there has never been a clear association between the level of blood
estrogen and the appearance of osteoporosis,'' Kaye said.
   Osteoporosis is much more prevalent in women, who may undergo an
80 percent reduction in estrogen production following menopause, the
institute said. It noted that men show only a moderate lowering of
testosterone levels.
   Kaye is a professor of endocrinology at the institute, which is a
leading Israeli research facility in the natural sciences. It is in
Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv.

<P>
MEDICINE: RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE AND WIDELY AVAILABLE, IT HALVED THE RATE OF 
VERTEBRA BREAKS IN A TEST GROUP OF WOMEN WITH BRITTLE BONES. 
</P>

By JANNY SCOTT, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A relatively inexpensive and widely available drug can halve the rate of 
vertebral fractures in women with osteoporosis, according to a study that may 
offer a new treatment option for some of the 24 million Americans who suffer 
from brittle bones. 
</P>
<P>
The drug, called etidronate, is used to treat Paget's disease, a bone disorder 
among middle-aged and elderly people. It is not approved for use against 
osteoporosis, but the manufacturer intends to apply for federal permission. 
</P>
<P>
"The important message is that here is another therapeutic option that is 
probably as effective as estrogen and calcitonin and that has a low incidence 
of side-effects," said Dr. B. Lawrence Riggs, an osteoporosis specialist at the 
Mayo Clinic and Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
Estrogen therapy is one of several methods of preventing bone loss in 
post-menopausal women. But it is less effective against more advanced 
osteoporosis, has some undesirable side effects and cannot be used by women 
with a high breast-cancer risk. 
</P>
<P>
Calcitonin, another hormone, is often used by women who cannot take estrogen. 
But in the United States, it must be given by injection. It is also relatively 
expensive -- about 10 times the annual cost of etidronate, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
The new study, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, found 
that two years of etidronate therapy not only halved the vertebral-fracture 
rate in post-menopausal women but also increased their spinal bone density by 
an average of 4% or 5%. 
</P>
<P>
The lessening of the fracture rate was especially striking in women who had the 
weakest bones when the 429-patient study began. In their case, the 
vertebral-fracture rate was reduced by two-thirds compared to women not taking 
the drug. 
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is the demonstration of a reduced rate of fractures," 
said Dr. Nelson B. Watts, the study's principal author. "It doesn't matter to a 
patient whether the bones are more dense or not; what matters to them is 
whether they have a fracture and hurt." 
</P>
<P>
The study focused specifically on vertebral fractures, the most common 
fractures in people with osteoporosis. Watts said the number of non-vertebral 
fractures, such as hip fractures, in the women he studied was too small to show 
any significant differences between women on and off the drug. 
</P>
<P>
Others cautioned that the drug needs further study to explore, for example, its 
long-term effects on bone strength and bone-cell activity. They also called for 
studies comparing the effectiveness of etidronate to that of other osteoporosis 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now we see it as part of that arsenal (of osteoporosis drugs)," said 
Sandra C. Raymond, executive director of the National Osteoporosis Foundation. 
"We can't answer the question, is it more or less effective than anything 
else?" 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to emphasize that this is still viewed as experimental 
therapy," said Dr. Steven T. Harris of UC San Francisco, a co-author of the 
study. "It is intriguing, it's exciting, but it's experimental." 
</P>
<P>
Osteoporosis -- which can cause fractures of the spine, hip and wrist -- 
affects about 24 million Americans, most of them elderly women. About 5 million 
of them suffer from spinal osteoporosis and run the risk of painful vertebral 
fractures. 
</P>
<P>
Such fractures can cause the bones to compress, resulting in a progressive loss 
of height or in pain from compression of the spinal nerve. Osteoporosis is 
estimated to cause 1.5 million fractures in the United States each year. 
</P>
<P>
Etidronate works by interfering with so-called bone remodeling, the process by 
which bones are constantly broken down and rebuilt. The drug inhibits the 
metabolic activity of cells responsible for breaking down, or resorbing, bone. 
</P>
<P>
Watts estimated the drug's cost, if used to treat osteoporosis, at $200 to $300 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted at seven academic medical centers nationwide, involved 
women who had already had from one to four vertebral fractures. Some of the 
women received etidronate while others did not; they all took calcium, a widely 
used osteoporosis treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The drug was administered by tablet intermittently over two years. 
</P>
<P>
In the end, the women who took etidronate had a vertebral fracture rate of 29.5 
per 1,000 patient years -- compared to a rate of 62.9 in the non-drug group. 
The women with the lowest spinal bone density had a rate of 42.3 fractures 
compared to 132.7. 
</P>
<P>
The findings expand upon those of a much smaller study published two months ago 
in the journal. That study, involving fewer but sicker patients, found a 
similar increase in bone mass, absence of side effects and a reduction in 
fractures. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly can't claim that this cures osteoporosis," said Watts, associate 
professor at Emory University School of Medicine. "There may be people with 
such severe disease that we can't restore them to health. But this certainly 
improves their lot." 
</P>
<P>
Etidronate has been available in the United States since 1978 for treatment of 
Paget's disease and a bone disorder in cancer patients. It is sold under the 
brand name Didronel by its manufacturer, Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Norwich Eaton helped fund the new study. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Dietrich, a company spokeswoman, said this week that the firm intends to 
apply soon to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make osteoporosis 
treatment an "approved use" for etidronate. One researcher estimated that an 
FDA decision could take at least six months. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the law does not prevent physicians from prescribing the drug 
for so-called "off-label" uses such as treating osteoporosis. But physicians 
may be leery of risking liability for any unintended consequences of 
prescribing it for an unapproved use.

<LEADPARA>  EXERCISE IS like a pension fund for a man's skeleton and the sooner a man
starts making payments, the longer he's likely to keep strong bones.;   "The

<TEXT>     Men tend to have stronger bones, and lose the strength more slowly, than do
women. The leaching of calcium accelerates in the late 60s or early 70s in
men, while this happens at menopause in women, he said.;   But men who think
of osteoporosis as solely a women's disease are wrong. Eighty percent of the
victims are women, but that still leaves 20 percent -- 5 or 6 million, said
Bonner, chairman of the physical medicine and rehabilitation department at
Graduate Hospital in Philadelphia.;   So men, like women, need to make sure
they have calcium in their diets and exercise in their lifestyle.;   Exercise
puts stress on bones, like it does on muscles, and makes both stronger. Bones,
which have a honeycomb structure, become stronger by filling in parts of the
comb, becoming more dense.;   "There seems to be almost a 'mechanostat' that
regulates the relationship between the skeleton and the mechanical environment
that the skeleton operates in," said Dr. Eric S. Orwoll, a researcher in
Portland, Ore. "A sedentary lifestyle probably results in the mechanostat
adjusting the skeletal mass downward.";   Men might even try harder to work
exercise into their lives than they would in making sure they're taking in the
calcium they need to make bone, Orwoll said. Starting an exercise program
takes effort. But men get calcium in a normal diet, he said.;   And, the
experts say, it pays to develop dense bones before bone mass peaks at around
35 years of age. After that, you're fighting a rearguard battle to slow the
natural loss of bone, the osteoporosis foundation says.  </TEXT>

<HEAD>Bone Loss In Women Runners May Be Irreversible, Studies Suggest</HEAD>

   Women who exercise enough to disrupt their
menstrual periods may suffer an irreversible loss of strength in
their bones that could lead to serious fractures or a kind of
premature aging, new studies suggest.
   A 24-year-old woman whose periods are irregular can have the
bones of a 50-year-old, said Dr. Charles H. Chesnut of the
University of Washington. ``Once that loss has occurred, it appears
there's very little we can do about it.''
   The bone loss can lead to potentially serious spinal fractures
and to less serious stress fractures that will keep women from
exercising.
   Women can regain regular periods by reducing their level of
exercise, but the bones don't seem to fully recover, said Chesnut.
   ``That attitude of some of the women's running gurus has been a
bit irresponsible,'' said Dr. Robert Marcus of Stanford University
in Palo Alto, Calif. ``They basically take the cavalier view that,
yes, if you stop, everything comes back.''
   Recreational athletes, or women who are just trying to stay fit,
don't suffer disruption of periods, Chesnut said.
   The loss or disruption of menstrual periods, known technically
as amenorrhea, occurs most in runners, cyclists, swimmers and
ballet dancers, said Anne Loucks, a research endocrinologist at the
University of California, San Diego, and an authority on the effect
of exercise on women.
   Researchers don't know why intense exercise affects menstrual
periods. ``Most people think it's probably a combination of
factors,'' said Barbara Drinkwater, an exercise and environmental
physiologist at the Pacific Medical Center in Seattle who has
collaborated with Chesnut.
   ``How much of the problem is due to exercise, how much is due to
nutrition, how much is due to psychological stress _ I don't think
anyone can say with certainty,'' she said.
   Estimates of the frequency vary widely, said Loucks, with some
researchers reporting the problem in only a few percent of athletes
and others reporting some disruption of periods in as many as 40
percent of women athletes.
   Chesnut said the women he and Drinkwater studied did not begin
to have problems until they were running 30 miles to 35 miles per
week or more. (That threshhold varies from one individual to the
next, he said.)
   ``For most women who are only trying to stay in shape, keep
their weight down and are running 10 to 20 miles a week, there is
no cause for concern as long as their periods remain regular.
Exercise is of benefit for a woman at any age so long as it is kept
in perspective and does not result in a loss of periods,'' he said.
   Drinkwater underscored the point. ``We want to be very sure that
people don't get the idea that exercise causes low bone mass.
Exercise is beneficial to bone. It's the amenorrhea that's
responsible for the decrease of bone density.''
   Women whose periods remain normal can exercise all they like,
Drinkwater said. ``I don't think we want to frighten women away
from exercise. What we want to say is _ be sensible in your
approach to it.''
   Loucks also notes that many things can cause a woman to lose
regular menstrual periods. ``A woman who stops menstruating
definitely should consult with her gynecologist to rule out other
possibilities.''
   Getting women athletes to the doctor isn't always easy, however.
``They view themselves as very healthy,'' she said. ``It's very
hard to convince them they have a problem.''
   In February, one researcher seemed to reinforce that notion by
suggesting that women who begin running vigorously before puberty
may face a decreased cancer risk later in life.
   The researcher, Rose E. Frisch of the Harvard School of Public
Health in Boston, said girls who exercise in elementary school can
delay the onset of puberty and may thereby lower their breast
cancer risk.
   Loucks expressed reservations about that view, saying Frisch's
studies of young runners did not document disruptions in menstrual
periods.
   ``That is not correct,'' said Frisch. ``We documented them in
the greatest detail.''
   Marcus was more forceful in his criticism: ``It boggles the mind
that a reasonable investigator would say something like that. She
obviously did not do a study in which she followed women for 40
years, watching them develop or not develop cancer.''
   Frisch said many other studies support her findings, and she
emphasized that the studies only suggest that delaying puberty
would reduce breast cancer risk. ``I have no guarantee that it
would,'' she said.
   The mechanism of bone loss in amenorrheic women is not
completely clear, but researchers say they do have a plausible
hypothesis.
   Women who have lost their periods do not produce as much of the
female sex hormone estrogen, which leads to calcium loss. So the
researchers assume that exercise-related bone loss ``is due to the
low estrogen levels in the amenorrheic athletes,'' Loucks said.
   The same thing happens after menopause, leading to the disorder
called osteoporosis, characterized by loss of calcium and fragile
bones.
   Loucks said the underlying disorder that triggers the amenorrhea
in exercising women appears to be in the brain, perhaps in the
hypothalamus, which controls the body's hormonal system. The
hypothalamus sends signals to the pituitary gland, which in turn
regulates hormone production.
   Chesnut and Drinkwater found that women who stop exercising and
regain menstrual periods can recover some, but probably not all, of
the lost bone.
   Because bone loss is difficult or impossible to remedy, doctors
must focus on prevention, Chesnut said. ``We want to get to these
women athletes as soon as possible after amenorrhea occurs, within
five to six months certainly, and presumably get them on estrogen
replacement, so we can prevent that loss before it's occurred.
Because once that loss has occurred, it appears there's very little
we can do about it.''
   Estrogen may not be suitable for all women, however. Some
researchers have linked estrogen treatment _ which is often
prescribed for women after menopause _ with an increased risk of
cancer, especially breast cancer. Others have found no risk.
   ``It's something that needs to be studied,'' said Chesnut. ``I
would not want all physicians to start putting all of their
amenorrheic women on estrogens at the time of amenorrhea.''
   Giving calcium alone does not seem to prevent the bone loss, he
said.
   Marcus acknowledged that some serious competitive athletes may
be unwilling to reduce the intensity of their exercise, but he
noted that the bone weakness itself may ultimately force them to
stop exercising.

cancer is detected soon enough.; Estrogen's benefits; Small doses of estrogen
are as effective as larger doses in lowering cholesterol of post-menopausal
women, a new study published in last week's New England Journal of Medicine
reports.;   The lower cholesterol could have the effect of cutting the risk of

the menopause clinic of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, where the
study was conducted.;   The lower dose of estrogen is already used by about
two-thirds of the women who are on estrogen-replacement therapy, Walsh said.
Many women switched to the lower dose after earlier findings that it blocked
menopausal symptoms (such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness) and prevented
the bone loss that causes osteoporosis in many older women as effectively as a
larger amount.;   However, its relative value in controlling cholesterol had
not been firmly established, Walsh said. His study of about 40 post-menopausal
women also showed that estrogen-replacement therapy works by stimulating the
liver to get rid of cholesterol.; Preventing bone loss; In a separate study in
the same journal, a combination of exercise and either calcium supplements or
estrogen replacement appeared to be almost equally effective in preventing
further bone loss in women who were at special risk of osteoporosis. That
study, conducted in Australia, found that estrogen replacement and exercise
were somewhat more effective but found fewer side effects with the calcium
program.;   Both combinations were more effective than exercise alone.  </TEXT>

   A National Research Council report that said
vitamin pills and some other dietary supplements are useless and
perhaps harmful was denounced as ``a disservice to all Americans''
by a trade group.
   The group, called the Council for Responsible Nutrition, said
that the NRC report released Wednesday failed to acknowledge what it
called ``emerging research'' on benefits from supplements of
vitamins, fiber and calcium.
   ``The NRC report provides only a shallow review of the evidence
on the benefits of nutritional supplements and fails to reflect the
tide of research that supports those benefits,'' the trade
association said in a prepared statement.
   The NRC on Wednesday released a 1,300-page report that is a
compilation by 19 experts of research from many sources related to
diet and health. The three-year study concluded that health is best
maintained by a balanced diet of a variety of foods in a diet that
is reduced in fat and salt, and enriched with fruits, vegetables and
complex carbohydrates.
   The study said the NRC committee found no conclusive evidence
that taking doses of supplemental vitamins, fiber or calcium would
provide protection from cancer, heart disease, embrittlement of
bones or other ailments.
   Annette Dickinson, a nutrition expert and a spokeswoman for the
trade group, said the NRC finding is unrealistic because it did not
recognize that the food eaten by many Americans does not include all
the nutrients in the recommended dietary allowance developed by the
federal government.
   ``People simply are not getting those required amounts,'' said
Ms. Dickinson. ``We believe that it is better that they get them
(nutrients) somewhere'' than not at all.
   She said the NRC study is ``backing away'' from the use of a
number of supplements that have been shown to be ``quite
effective.'' She said that the report springs from a bias against
supplements in favor of a balanced diet.
   Ms. Dickinson acknowledged that research reports on the value of
supplements have had mixed results historically and admitted that
``there is a lot of bias on both sides'' about their use.
   The NRC study said that dietary supplements was a $3 billion
business in 1987, and that many doctors, nurses and nutritionists
take multivitamins and other supplements. It said many people
self-prescribe supplements containing nutrients far in excess of the
RDA set by the federal government.
   A daily dose of multiple vitamins with 100 percent of the RDA
``is not known to be harmful or beneficial,'' the report said.
``However, vitamin-mineral supplements that exceed the RDA and other
supplements (such as protein powders, single amino acids, fiber and
lecithin) not only have no known health benefits ... but their use
may be detrimental to health.''
   Though the study recommended foods high in calcium, it noted that
``the potential benefits of calcium intakes above the RDAs to
prevent osteoporosis or hypertension are not well documented and do
not justify the use of calcium supplements.''
   Fiber supplements by themselves, the report said, did not confer
any protection against disease, but fiber taken with fruits,
vegetables, grains and legumes are beneficial. The study recommended
five or more servings daily of fruit or vegetables, and six or more
servings of bread, cereals or legumes.

FT  25 JUN 93 / Technology: Topping up the hormones - The market for
menopause treatment is lucrative, says Clive Cookson in a series on drug
discoveries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A 51-year-old product, extracted from pregnant mares' urine, is turning
unexpectedly into a pharmaceutical blockbuster. The success of Premarin -
worldwide sales up 20 per cent to Dollars 642m (Pounds 428m) last year and
projected to reach Dollars 1bn in 1995 - is a testimony to the fast-growing
popularity of hormone replacement therapy for women during and after the
menopause.
Although HRT has been going as long as an average menopausal woman, new
research findings are propelling its growth. They show that oestrogens such
as Premarin not only relieve the immediate symptoms of menopause, such as
hot flushes, night sweats, fatigue and vaginal dryness, but also help
prevent two serious health problems of old age: osteoporosis (fragile bones)
and heart disease.
At the same time drug companies are developing more convenient ways of
delivering HRT than the traditional Premarin tablets sold by Wyeth, the
pharmaceutical subsidiary of American Home Products. The most important
innovation is the transdermal patch, pioneered by Ciba of Switzerland, which
releases hormones slowly into the blood through the skin.
Menopause is defined narrowly as a woman's last menstrual period, which
occurs at an average age of 51, but the term is now used more loosely to
describe the change triggered by the ovaries' declining capacity to produce
oestrogens (female sex hormones). Typically this starts in the late 40s and
continues well into the 50s.
Falling oestrogen levels affect the normal functioning of many body systems,
including skin, bone, blood vessels and sex organs. The most important
long-term impact is to accelerate the normal age-related loss of bone
density and minerals. The result is osteoporosis, which causes 1.3m bone
fractures a year in the US, at a total cost in health care estimated at
Dollars 10bn a year. More than half the women who break a hip in old age
will never be able to walk without assistance again and one in five dies
within a year of the fracture.
Menopause also removes the protection from heart disease given by
oestrogens, which reduce clogging of arteries and simulate the healthy
growth of blood vessels. Although younger women are much less likely than
men of the same age to die from heart attack or stroke, such deaths increase
rapidly after the age of 50.
HRT aims to restore oestrogens in the blood to a level slightly below what
is normal before menopause. Although Wyeth and Ciba dominate the market,
more than 20 other HRT products are currently available, including surgical
implants, creams and pessaries as well as tablets and skin patches. Most
contain natural oestrogens - either human oestradiol or 'conjugated
oestrogens' from pregnant mares. These are much less potent than the
synthetic hormones incorporated in oral contraceptive pills.
In addition to oestrogen, women on HRT whose wombs have not been removed by
hysterectomy are advised to take cyclical doses of a second hormone,
progestogen. Its role is to prevent excessive cells building up in the
lining of the uterus - a condition that can eventually lead to cancer of the
womb.
Clinical evidence for the long-term benefits of HRT is building up steadily,
as the World Menopause Congress in Stockholm has been hearing this week. The
risk of hip fracture is reduced by at least half after five years of
treatment and the risk of heart attack may be cut by 45 per cent.
The proportion of menopausal women in the UK who are on HRT has increased
from 4 per cent to 9 per cent over the past five years, according to the
Amarant Trust, a medical charity specialising in HRT. In the US about 15 per
cent are on HRT.
However, there is scope for far more women to benefit from HRT, says Val
Godfree, deputy medical director of the Amarant Trust. Busy family doctors
do not have time to explain HRT during the 10 to 15 minutes allotted to a
typical consultation, she says, or to work out the best therapy for each
individual. As a result, too many women give up after two or three weeks
because of the 'side-effects', before the therapy has had a chance to do
them much good.
The side-effects caused by oestrogen-progestogen combinations - including
breast tenderness, bloating and leg cramps - normally disappear within three
months, as the body becomes accustomed to the raised hormone levels. It may
also be possible to reduce side-effects by switching to a different
combination and/or from tablets to skin patch.
Beyond the immediate side-effects, some women steer clear of HRT because
they are afraid of the long-term risks of hormone consumption and/or because
they think it is wrong to interfere artificially with the natural ageing
process - a view that the author Germaine Greer expounded in her anti-HRT
book The Change, published in 1991. (Books about the menopause are a
lucrative publishing genre; Gail Sheehy's The Silent Passage, which favours
HRT, headed the US bestseller lists last year.)
Potentially the most serious long-term risk of HRT is a small increase in
the chance of developing breast cancer. This is still medically
controversial but Godfree concedes that the risk of breast cancer may
increase from 1-in-12 to 1-in-9 after 15 years on HRT.
Women who do not like taking sex hormones but still want to protect
themselves against osteoporosis may be prescribed other bone-strengthening
drugs, notably calcitonins.
Giving calcium (the main mineral in bone) directly as a dietary supplement
does not appear to prevent osteoporosis in well-nourished women. But
calcitonins - hormones that regulate calcium and phosphate levels in the
body - do help by reducing the resorption of mineral from bone into the
blood.
Sandoz of Switzerland leads the Dollars 1bn-a-year calcitonin market with
Miacalcic, a synthetic version of salmon calcitonin. Until recently,
calcitonins had to be injected but Miacalcic is now available as a more
convenient nasal spray.
Bisphosphonates - potent inhibitors of bone resorption - are a new category
of drug to treat osteoporosis. Sales are still small - only Dollars 80m last
year according to Arvind Desai, an analyst with Mehta and Isaly, the New
York healthcare investment company - but they are expected to rise as new
products come through clinical trials.
Meanwhile, a new generation of transdermal patches will be fuelling the
growth of the HRT market. The first, Evorel, was launched in Europe early
this year by Ortho-Cilag, a subsidiary of Johnson &amp; Johnson. As with Ciba's
original Estraderm, a patch is applied twice a week to the buttocks or top
of the legs. But with a thickness of only 0.1 mm, Evorel is thinner than
Estraderm; it contains oestrogen dispersed in a matrix rather than a liquid
reservoir. Ortho-Cilag quotes clinical studies to show that Evorel suffers
less from two problems of the first-generation patches - their tendency to
fall off and to irritate the skin.
Other companies developing second-generation HRT patches include two US drug
delivery companies, Noven and Cignus, and Ethical Holdings of the UK. Noven
has signed licencing agreements with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer in Europe and Ciba
in the US, while Cignus is collaborating with Warner-Lambert.
The main advantage of patches over tablets, apart from convenience, is that
the hormone diffuses straight into the bloodstream. 'The patch avoids giving
large doses of oestrogen to the liver,' says John Stevenson, consultant
endocrinologist at the Wynn Institute for Metabolic Research. 'It is
therefore less likely to cause metabolic disturbances which might be seen
with the oral route.'
Menopause-related drugs are one of the fastest growing of all pharmaceutical
sectors, as Desai points out. Ironically, the growth is based less on new
chemicals than on well-known natural hormones.
Desai expects the overall market for menopause, osteoporosis and bone
disease treatments to continue growing at 15 to 20 per cent a year at least
until 1996 - 'and the rate of expansion could be even faster if sufficient
breadth of new products was available'.
The series will continue next month with an article on arthritis treatment.

BATTLE IS STILL RAGING OVER VITAMIN-MINERAL SUPPLEMENTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD S. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Perhaps no other subject arouses as much acrimony among nutritional authorities 
as vitamin and mineral supplementation. 
</P>
<P>
Firmly entrenched on one side are the skeptics who, like researchers at the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, call supplementation "a questionable and 
potentially harmful practice." On the opposing side stand the apologists, who 
claim that taking megadoses of vitamins and minerals can extend the life span 
and boost the body's immune system. 
</P>
<P>
Between these two extremes are the many nutritionists and physicians who 
cautiously endorse taking a daily multiple supplement with 100% of the 
Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) as "insurance" against nutritional 
deficiencies. The Food and Nutrition Board, the government agency that sets 
nutritional standards, defines the RDA as the amount of each nutrient necessary 
to keep most people in good health, based on available scientific knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"Supplementation may be warranted after age 50 because nutritional needs change 
and because the American fast-food diet makes it difficult to get complete 
nutrition," said Maryanne Painter, a dietitian for Health Care Pharmacies in 
San Diego. "You may be a candidate if you don't consume two servings of milk 
products daily, two servings of protein foods (such as lean red meat, fish and 
poultry), four serving of fruits and vegetables (one-half cup each) and four 
servings of starches, including cereals, breads and rolls. 
</P>
<P>
Supplements should not provide more than 100% of the RDA, she warned, because 
certain vitamins, such as Vitamins A and D, become toxic in excessively high 
concentrations. High doses of Vitamin A, for example, may cause blurred vision 
and headaches, while excesses of Vitamin D may cause vomiting and diarrhea, 
weight loss and muscular weakness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wholesome Food 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than megadosing on vitamins to make up for an inadequate diet, I 
recommend eating healthful, wholesome food and using vitamins as an adjunct to 
your diet," Painter said. "If you listen to your body and eat a varied diet 
that incorporates your favorite foods in moderation, as Hippocrates said, 'food 
will be your medicine.' " 
</P>
<P>
Some nutritionists, however, claim that given our present agricultural and 
food-processing systems, relying strictly on unsupplemented diets can only 
create nutritional deficiencies.

Getting adequate nutrition from food "was possible 100 or even 50 years ago, 
when all foods were grown on fertile soils, were unrefined, and unprocessed, 
and contained all the nutrients nature intended them to contain," writes Paavo 
Airola, a well-known nutritionist, in "The Holistic Health Lifebook." "But 
today, when soils are depleted, when foods are loaded with residues of hundreds 
of toxic insecticides and other chemicals, the addition of vitamins and food 
supplements to the diet is of vital importance. "Nutritionally inferior and 
poisoned foods of today cause many nutritional deficiencies, derangement in 
body chemistry, and lowered resistance to disease." 
</P>
<P>
Some nutritional authorities do not fault the food system itself, but people's 
lack of knowledge in balancing meals for adequate nutrition. 
</P>
<P>
"Satisfying the RDAs at the dinner table is a wonderful goal but unrealistic," 
said Paul Saltman, a University of California biology professor and author of 
"The California Nutrition Book." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Safety Net 
</P>
<P>
"Unless you're a superb nutritionist and know how to balance foods to provide 
the essential micronutrients, you need supplements to act as a safety net to 
catch needs that fall through the dietary cracks." 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, government studies of older men and women reveal that more than 
half get less than two-thirds of the RDAs for calories and several vitamins and 
minerals, he said. Common deficiencies of the aging include shortages of 
calcium and Vitamin D necessary to combat osteoporosis, the trace minerals zinc 
and iron, and essential B vitamins, such as thiamine, Folacin, B-6 and B-12. 
</P>
<P>
"Even if seniors consume 100% of the RDA, the figures established by the 
government may be inappropriate for them," Saltman said. "There is only one set 
of RDAs for all men and women over 50, yet there is substantial evidence that 
people's nutritional needs vary dramatically between 51 and 65 or 75." 
</P>
<P>
Nutrition-minded seniors intent on getting adequate amounts of key nutrients 
may encounter another problem: absorption. According to David Olson, a 
chiropractor in San Diego, many seniors have trouble absorbing calcium because 
they cannot produce sufficient stomach acid. Older adults also have trouble 
with Vitamin B-12 absorption, putting them at risk for pernicious anemia. 
</P>
<P>
As the digestive system becomes less efficient in later life, supplementation 
may help offset problems caused by decreased absorption, he said. But people 
also can make life style changes to aid the digestive process. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Eat Calmly 
</P>
<P>
"To increase absorption, it's important for people to eat calmly," he said, 
"otherwise digestion is hindered by anxiety. And people should chew their food 
throughly before swallowing, because an enzyme secreted in the mouth, ptyalin, 
begins to break down carbohydrates, facilitating digestion." 
</P>
<P>
Olson also recommends eating small, frequent meals throughout the day, easing 
the burden imposed on the digestive system. He also cautions taking fiber 
products -- such as oat bran, apple pectin and wheat bran -- apart from meals, 
because fiber blocks the absorption of certain key minerals. 
</P>
<P>
Seniors who use over-the-counter and prescription medication need to be 
especially conscious of food-drug interactions, which may deplete bodily stores 
of important nutrients, said Jerry Hammond, a pharmacist and president of the 
San Diego County Pharmacists Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Aspirin, for example, impairs assimilation of Vitamin C, he said. Mineral oils, 
found commonly in laxatives, decrease absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins, 
A, D, E and K. Diuretics deplete bodily stores of calcium, potassium, magnesium 
and zinc. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take medication that interferes with vitamin intake, a multiple 
supplement may help replenish depleted nutrients," Hammond said. "I recommend a 
supplement with 100% of the RDA, along with a calcium supplement to slow down 
the development of osteoporosis." 
</P>
<P>
Still, supplements cannot take the place of a well-balanced diet. 
</P>
<P>
Advised Roslyn Alfin-Slater, professor of nutrition at UCLA's School of Public 
Health: "Eat a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, get plenty of fruits, 
vegetables and whole grains, increase fiber consumption and drink eight glasses 
of fluid daily. Exercise the body and mind regularly, and in the process be 
sure to enjoy all the food that contributes to your health."

<HEAD>New Drug Shows Promise in Treating Osteoporosis</HEAD>

   A prescription drug already on the market can
reverse the slow loss of spinal bone that causes the crushed
vertebrae and stooped posture of old age, a study published today
shows.
   Women who took the medicine in a two-year experiment conducted
at seven U.S. medical centers cut their risk of broken vertebrae in
half.
   ``We think it's extremely encouraging news,'' said Sandra
Raymond, executive director of the National Osteoporosis
Foundation. ``Our arsenal is very small. Hopefully now, based on
these studies, we may have another option.''
   The medicine, called etidronate, joins two other prescription
medicines available to treat osteoporosis, the brittle-bones
disease that afflicts an estimated 15 million to 20 million
Americans. Because of its apparent advantages, it could become the
medicine of choice for many elderly victims.
   ``This is really exciting,'' said Dr. Nelson B. Watts of Emory
University, principal author of the study. ``We can wait until
somebody is already in bad shape and make them better. They won't
stand straight or play basketball. But the deterioration will be
halted.''
   Crushed vertebrae are the most common consequence of
osteoporosis, a disorder that largely affects women after
menopause. There is no evidence so far that etidronate will prevent
hip fractures, which are a less common but more serious hazard of
the disease.
   The study was published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine. In May, the journal carried a smaller study by European
researchers that reached similar conclusions. Both studies were
financed by Procter &amp; Gamble's Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals, which
makes etidronate.
   In the latest work, 429 women with osteoporosis were randomly
assigned to take etidronate or dummy placebos for two years. When
it was over, the spinal bone density of those getting etidronate
had increased 5 percent, and they suffered half as many vertebral
fractures as the other women.
   During their younger years, people lose old bone and make new
bone at about the same rate. Later on, however, many lose bone
faster than they replace it.
   Etidronate works by slowing the body's resorption of old bone.
This allows the slow production of new bone to outpace the loss.
The medicine resulted in a two-thirds drop in fractures in women
with the weakest bones, the study showed.
   ``The impact of etidronate was greatest in individuals with the
lowest bone mass,'' noted Dr. William Peck of Washington University
in St. Louis. ``That means we are talking about reducing fractures
in people who are at the greatest risk. That's an exciting
possibility.''
   During the study, the women took the medicine for two weeks out
of every three months. The drug is already on the market for
treatment of Paget's disease, another bone ailment. However, it has
not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
osteoporosis.
   Currently, the only prescription drugs approved for treatment of
osteoporosis are estrogen and calcitonin.
   Etidronate carries no known side effects, costs $200 to $300 per
year and is taken in pill form. Doctors say these are important
advantages. Calcitonin requires three injections a week and costs
10 times more.
   While estrogen is a highly effective treatment for protecting
bones during the first years after menopause, doctors are unsure
whether it helps older women. Estrogen, which is a sex hormone,
cannot be taken by women at high risk of breast cancer. It also can
cause resumption of menstrual bleeding.

@  Cholesterol Levels Tied to Hormone Use

   Synthetic hormones women take to counter symptoms of menopause also prevent adverse changes in cholesterol levels, according to a study released today. 

   Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh found in a survey of 101 women that menopause naturally produced changes in blood cholesterol that may explain why older women have an increased risk of heart attacks. 
But the researchers found that women who took hormone supplements to relieve menopause-related problems didn't suffer adverse cholesterol changes. 

   The new findings, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine, will certainly fuel the recent debate over the relative health benefits of hormone use by menopausal women. 
Millions of American women take estrogen and progestin hormone products to counter symptoms of menopause such as osteoporosis, a condition in which bones can become brittle. 
Some earlier studies have shown that women who use estrogen have a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, while other research has contradicted those findings. 
The new report appears to strengthen the claim that hormone use can protect older women against heart attacks. 

   But the study probably won't damp controversy over hormone use in general. 
The issue spilled into the news last month after Swedish researchers reported that long term use of a combination of estrogen and progestin sharply increased a post-menopausal woman's risk of breast cancer. 
Publicity surrounding the report caused an uproar in medical circles and confusion among the many women using the drugs. 
Some specialists praised the study for alerting women to a potentially serious side effect, while others have charged that the study was flawed. 

   A spokeswoman said the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in Washington has fielded numerous queries about the use of the synthetic products to replace the normal loss of hormones that accompany menopause. 
The group is one of several medical organizations which said the Swedish study wasn't relevant to American women because estrogen products used in Sweden differ from the products most widely prescribed in the U.S. 

   The most widely used estrogen product in the U.S. is sold under the brand name Premarin by American Home Products Corp.'s Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. 
In 1988, sales of Premarin, largely to prevent osteoporosis, jumped 26% to $236 million. 
A spokeswoman for the company said Premarin isn't currently indicated for use in preventing heart disease, but the company is researching the matter. 

   Earlier research had found that estrogens can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by about 50% and that women who took the hormones had higher levels of a "good" kind of cholesterol called high density lipoproteins, or HDL, which protect against heart disease. 
The newest study by the Pittsburgh researchers found that estrogens don't directly increase HDL levels, but, instead, counter a natural tendency for HDL levels to drop during menopause. 

   The new study found that after menopause HDL levels on average fell about four milligrams for each deciliter of blood. 
Meanwhile, levels of low density lipoproteins, the dangerous kind of cholesterol known as LDL, rose about 12 milligrams after menopause. 
But the HDL and LDL levels of women who were administered hormone supplements were basically unchanged. 

   Karen Matthews, who co-authored the study with Lewis Kullers, said the new findings suggest that women likely to undergo menopause, at about age 50, ought to monitor their cholesterol levels. 
Those already at high risk of heart disease, she said, might consider changing their diet, stepping up their exercise, or taking the hormone products. 
"The risks and benefits of {hormone} replacement therapy really needs to be addressed on a patient-to-patient basis," Ms. Matthews said. 

   The study surveyed 541 women between the ages of 42 and 50 who hadn't entered menopause, and then, after 2 1/2 years, examined 101 of those women who stopped menstruating. 
The researchers compared cholesterol levels in the 69 women who didn't take hormone supplements to the 32 women who did.

   A new synthetic variation of vitamin D, developed at the University of Wisconsin, is being tested in humans as a possible treatment for osteoporosis. 

   Vitamin D controls the body's absorption and use of calcium. 
Osteoporosis is a weakening of bones caused by the loss of calcium that commonly occurs in women after menopause. 

   Results of an initial test in humans to determine safe dosages of a compound called 1-alpha-hydroxyvitamin D-2 were reported in abstract form in the advanced program for an international meeting of bone specialists next month in Montreal. 
The program appears in the August issue of the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research. 

   The new compound is of interest because it was developed by Hector F. DeLuca, professor of biochemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a noted expert on vitamin D. Prof. 
DeLuca has developed a number of synthetic variations of vitamin D, one of which is widely used in Japan for treating osteoporosis. 
Strangely, however, that compound, 1-alpha-hydroxyvitamin D-3 (instead of D-2), produces a much higher incidence of adverse effects among northern Europeans than it does among Japanese and, thus, isn't likely to be approved by regulators for use in the U.S. 

   The new compound, the D-2 version of the vitamin, was tested at different dosages on 15 post-menopausal women at Creighton University in Omaha, Neb. 
The compound "is well tolerated at the doses used, and should have a therapeutic window that is wider than the previously used 1-alpha-hydroxalated vitamin D-3 compounds," the abstract states. 
This indicates that the new compound may have fewer adverse effects in Americans than the one used in Japan. 

   "We don't yet have evidence for regeneration of bone {in the women}, but clinical trials are under way," said biochemist Charles W. Bishop of Bone Care International in Madison, sponsor of the human tests. 
It would take several months of use before any bone regeneration could be detected, he said. 
Mr. Bishop, however, noted that during the few weeks the women used the drug, their blood levels of a substance called osteocalcin increased. 
This biochemical change is suggestive of increased absorption of calcium by the bones, he explained. 

   Bone Care International has licensed rights to the new compound from the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, the agency that handles the licensing of inventions patented by the university's faculty. 
Bone Care is a subsidiary of Lunar Radiation Corp., a closely held maker of equipment to measure bone density founded by another University of Wisconsin professor, Richard B. Mazess. 

   Publication of the abstract was used by Deprenyl Research Ltd., Toronto, to announce that it had acquired an option on Canadian marketing rights to the new compound from Bone Care. 
Deprenyl also said that for an undisclosed sum it bought from Bone Care a convertible note that, if converted, would give it a 20% equity interest in Bone Care. 

   Deprenyl was in the news several days ago because it has rights to another drug, deprenyl, that may retard the progress of Parkinson's disease.

   The issue of hormone treatment for older women is gaining
urgency as 50 million U.S. women approach menopause.
   Researchers are in a quandary over the risks and benefits
of hormone therapy for women during and after menopause. The
therapy consists of daily tablets of estrogen -- principally
American Home Products Corp.'s Premarin -- to replace the
loss of natural estrogen that marks menopause.
</LP>
<TEXT>
   The latest study of the issue, being published today in
the New England Journal of Medicine, shows that estrogen
replacement therapy can cut the risk of heart attacks in the
first 10 years after menopause by 40% to 50%. Other studies
have shown estrogen therapy also reduces the loss of bone, or
osteoporosis, that plagues women after menopause.
   Yet other, equally valid studies indicate that the hormone
treatments might well increase the risk of breast and
endometrial cancer.
   "As the population ages, estrogen-replacement therapy is
an issue of growing medical, economic and social importance
for all of us," declares an editorial in this week's New
England Journal of Medicine by Lee Goldman, vice chairman of
the department of medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston, and Anna N.A. Tosteson, a biostatistician at the
hospital.
   "There are going to be more women going through menopause
in the next 10 years than at any time in history; it's almost
an impending epidemic," says gynecologist Wulf H. Utian of
the University Hospitals in Cleveland and a pioneer in
research on menopause. He notes that the first of the women
who were born during the baby boom that began in the
mid-1940s are now passing 45 years of age and are entering
the age range when menopause occurs. In the next 10 years, he
says, 50 million American women will go through menopause.
   The pressures to settle the questions surrounding
estrogen-replacement therapy are mounting, Dr. Utian says.
The number of heart attacks and bone fractures that will
occur in these women could overwhelm the health care system
in the next 15 years unless something is done to reduce these
menopause-linked problems, he says. Moreover, these baby-boom
women are highly health conscious and are unlikely to be as
passive about their menopause-linked health problems as their
mothers and grandmothers.
   The new study being published today bolsters previous
evidence that the biggest impact of estrogen therapy may be
in preventing heart disease in older women. Before menopause,
women have a markedly lower risk of heart attacks than men.
But after menopause -- and the loss of natural estrogens --
their heart attack risk rises sharply until it equals that of
men about age 60 or 65.
   The new study comes from a team of Harvard medical
researchers under epidemiologist Charles H. Hennekens of
Brigham and Women's Hospital. The team has been following
121,700 female nurses by periodic mail questionnaires since
1976.
   By 1986, more than 48,000 of the nurses had passed
menopause. In this group, a fifth were taking estrogen in
1986, a fourth had taken the hormone in the past but were no
longer taking it and 53% had never taken estrogen.
   The incidence of heart attacks in the post-menopausal
women during the decade was sharply lower among those nurses
currently taking estrogen than among those who never took the
hormone, the researchers report.
   Among the nurses who, at the start of the study, were free
of any of the "risk factors" for coronary heart disease (such
as high blood cholesterol or high blood pressure) the
incidence of fatal heart attacks was only 61% of the fatal
heart attacks that struck nurses who never took the hormone.
Among those who had taken estrogen some time in the past, the
incidence of fatal heart attacks was 79% of the incidence
among those who never had used the drug.
   Similarly, the incidence of diagnosed coronary heart
disease among estrogen users was only 51% of that among the
never-used group after adjusting the statistics for age. If
statisticians also ruled out the effects of heart disease
risk factors, the hormone takers had 56% of the incidence of
fatal attacks among the never-used group.
   In fact, estrogen appeared to reduce the risk of death
from any cause during the decade under study. The overall
death rate from all causes among those women currently taking
estrogen was 89% of the death rate in the never-used group.
   "The findings regarding mortality from all causes as well
as risk-benefit analyses suggest that, overall, the benefits
of postmenopausal estrogen therapy outweigh the risks," Dr.
Hennekens and his colleagues declare.
   The other major benefit of estrogen therapy, aside from
relief of menopausal symptoms such as "hot flashes," is a 60%
reduction of hip fractures as a result of the hormone slowing
or stopping the weakening of the bones, known as
osteoporosis.
   On the down side is a higher risk of cancer. The risk of
cancer of the endometrium, the lining of the womb, is six
times higher in estrogen users than in non-users, according
to a number of studies.
   And there is growing concern that prolonged estrogen use
may increase the risk of breast cancer. So far this year, at
least two so-called meta-analyses have been published in
which researchers try to add up the findings of a large
number of experiments. Researchers at Vanderbilt University
in Nashville, Tenn., for instance, added up the results of 28
previous studies. They estimated that at low dosages estrogen
increased the risk of breast cancer by 7% but at high dosages
it doubled the risk. A second meta-analysis by the federal
Centers for Disease Control suggested a 30% increase in risk
of breast cancer from estrogen use.
   But balancing risks against benefits is almost impossible
with such studies because they deal with "relative risks,"
Drs. Goldman and Tosteson explain in their editorial. In
computing relative risks, statisticians arbitrarily designate
the incidence of, say, heart attacks among non-users of
estrogen as equaling 1.00. They then calculate what fraction
of 1.00 is represented by the incidence of heart attacks
among estrogen users.
   Drs. Goldman and Tosteson warn that "relative risks should
not be confused with absolute risks," or the actual risk of
suffering or dying from an illness. "A twofold increase in
the risk of a rare event may not be nearly as important as a
10% decrease in the risk of a common event."
   Drs. Goldman and Tosteson were able to calculate some
absolute risks and benefits of estrogen use for a woman from
the age of 65 through 74. They noted, for instance, that a
woman has a 0.6% absolute risk of dying of complications of a
hip fracture. A 60% lower relative risk of a hip fracture
equals a 0.36% reduction in absolute risk. It happens that a
30% increase in the relative risk of breast cancer from
estrogen use also translates into a 0.36% increase in
absolute risk of dying of breast cancer. Thus, the benefits
of reduced hip fracture cancel out the increased risk of
breast cancer.
   For a woman over 50 years old, there is a 31% absolute
risk of dying of heart disease vs. a 2.8% risk of dying of
breast cancer, a 2.8% risk of a hip fracture and only 0.7%
risk of endometrial cancer, they note. Hence, they say, "even
a small relative benefit for heart disease would dwarf all
other effects."
   Because of the pivotal importance of the estrogen's
effects on heart disease, "a clinical trial of sufficient
size is urgently needed to document that the epidemiologic
evidence isn't a function of bias or statistical
legerdemain," Drs. Goldman and Tosteson say. Noting that
large-scale heart-disease studies have focused only on males,
they argue that "it is hard to justify the past delay, let
alone any future foot dragging, in conducting large trials in
women to address definitively the issue of
estrogen-replacement therapy after menopause."
   Dr. Utian in Cleveland says that the Congressional Office
of Technology Assessment is making a study of the estrogen
therapy issue and is expected to release its findings in
October.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are eating too much animal fat and
government regulations make it difficult for the food industry to
market leaner and more healthful meats and dairy products, a
scientific panel said Tuesday.
   Although consumption of animal fat has gone down, many Americans
still are eating their way to poor health with too much
cholesterol, fatty acids and salt, and not enough foods that
provide the needed calcium and iron said a report by a committee of
the National Research Council.
   It said ``the incidence of nutrition-related health problems is
significant, affecting either directly or indirectly nearly every
American family.''
   Among the diet-related health problems cited:
   _About 34 million Americans are overweight.
   _Nearly a million adults die annually of cardiovascular disease
that may be related to the consumption of high-cholesterol foods.
   _Osteoporosis, a disease caused by leaching of calcium from
bone, strikes 15 to 20 million adults.
   _Between 8 million and 12 million children are hungry because of
inadequate diets.
   _Iron deficiency is the most common form of childhood anemia.
   The chairman of the panel, David L. Call of Cornell University,
told reporters that animal products are a ``mixed blessing
nutritionally'' in the American diet.
   ``In our food supply, they (animal products) provide about 36
percent of our food energy and between 36 percent and 100 percent
of certain nutrients,'' he said.
   ``At the same time, however, animal products contribute more
than half of the total fat, nearly three-fourths of the saturated
fatty acids and all of the dietary cholesterol.''
   A change in some government regulations, along with education of
consumers and technological advances by manufacturers of animal
food products could correct the problems relatively quickly, said
Timothy Hammonds of the supermarket industry's Food Marketing
Institute, a member of the committee.
   ``In the future, the consumers could have it all,'' with more
healthful meats and dairy products that provide the needed
nutrition without excess fats and cholesterol, Hammonds said.
   The key, he said, is changes in the government regulations that
would provide an economic incentive to producers to change their
products.
   Among the changes recommended:
   _Permitting packers to trim fat from animal carcasses at the
slaughter plant. This system, called ``hot fat trimming,'' would
encourage meat producers to grow beef and lambs that are leaner
because they no longer would be rewarded for the fat added to the
carcasses through heavy feeding and feed supplements.
   ``Packers would like to trim the fat, but they can't do that
because government regulations won't let them,'' said committee
member Gary C. Smith of Texas A&amp;M University.
   The Agriculture Department, which controls meat grading, has
issued proposed `hot fat trimming'' rules for comment by the
industry.
   _Reducing what Call said is ``fuzziness'' in marketing terms
identifying meats and dairy products that have reduced fats or
other nutritional changes. The current system approved by the Food
and Drug Administration bases product identification in some cases
on fat content, Call said. Some frozen desserts, for example,
cannot be called ice cream because of a reduced fat content.
   Bologna, sausage and mayonnaise also must have certain levels of
fat or else be labeled as imitations, Call noted.
   As another example, Hammond of the Food Marketing Institute said
dairies can reduce the amount of salt in cheeses, but when the
product is marketed it cannot be called ``cheese'' because its
reduced salt content does not meet the FDA standard.
   The committee also asked for more precise standards for the use
of such meat marketing terms as ``lite,'' ``light'' and ``lean.''
   _Developing technology to determine the lean-to-fat ratio of
food animals while they are still on the hoof or shortly after
slaughter. The committee suggested this might be done with
electronic sensors now are used in medicine.
   _Encouraging research in genetics or feed supplement technology
that would produce leaner meats.
   Smith of Texas A&amp;M said the industry has made ``remarkable
progress'' in producing leaner meats during the last two decades.
   Pork producers, he said, have made the most progress because a
meat grading system for swine has provided incentives to reward
leanness. Similar incentives would contribute to changes among beef
and lamb producers, he said.
   Committee member Scott M. Grundy, a nutrition scientist at the
University of Texas, said that despite the potential health
problems, animal products consumed in appropriate portions are
essential parts of the diet.
   Meat and dairy products are important sources of such nutrients

FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: A NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION AGAINST WORLD HUNGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DR. JEAN MAYER and JEANNE GOLDBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A new year unfolds before us, aglitter with promise and hope. Perhaps the way 
to summarize the aspirations and realities of this time is to dedicate 
ourselves at the outset of 1989 to helping organizations that assist children 
in poor countries, especially the United Nations International Children's 
Emergency Fund, better known as UNICEF. 
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the situation of these children, James P. Grant, UNICEF's 
executive director, paraphrased Dickens and described it as "the best of times 
and the worst of times." Today it is indeed easy to find reasons both to hope 
and to despair. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Pluses 
</P>
<P>
On the good side: The world as a whole is becoming richer; knowledge of health, 
nutrition and agriculture is growing; and people in vast areas of the globe are 
becoming better fed and healthier. This is true in particular of the world's 
two most populous countries, China and India. India, written off by many 
Western writers in 1973 as a "basket case," now feeds itself and can even spare 
a little food for export income and relief of needy neighbors. It survived a 
difficult drought last year -- a triumph of the Green Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, UNICEF studies have shown that throughout the 1980s in at 
least 31 countries (16 in sub-Saharan Africa, eight in Latin America and seven 
in other regions) malnutrition has increased and educational levels have 
fallen. Close to 4.5 million children below the age of five die from 
undernutrition and associated infections as well as from preventable 
communicable diseases, including polio. UNICEF does what it can to reduce this 
catastrophe, and deserves our help. 
</P>
<P>
One important UNICEF program is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). This therapy 
prevents diarrheal diseases, frequent in malnourished areas, from killing 
infants. Oral rehydration salts are distributed in 93 countries. Packaged in 
premeasured packets, these salts can be mixed with water and administered to 
infants to keep them from becoming fatally dehydrated. Enough packets were 
produced last year to save at least half-a-million infants. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Modern Irony 
</P>
<P>
It is an irony of the modern world that at the same time that breast-feeding 
has regained status and popularity in developed nations, both duration and 
prevalence of breast-feeding have decreased in poor countries. The introduction 
of other drinks and foods, often of low-grade nutritional value, has gained in 
these areas to the detriment of both the finances of poor families and the 
health and survival of their children. UNICEF has subsidized information 
services and the training of health workers to encourage breast-feeding in 
countries such as Lesotho, Liberia, Swaziland, Uganda and Gambia on the African 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
In other aspects of nutrition, UNICEF has worked to improve methods of 
evaluating the state of nutrition in children, especially in villages; to beef 
up efforts in nutrition education; to improve the quality of foods sold in 
streets of cities; and to fight goiter in countries such as Vietnam, Bolivia, 
Ecuador and Peru, where it is still prevalent. UNICEF has succeeded in feeding 
millions of children in war-torn areas of the Sudan, Ethiopia, Mozambique and 
Angola, and helps in introducing unfamiliar but nutritious crops in many 
corners of the world. 
</P>
<P>
Other activities of UNICEF include the provision of pumps for safe water, basic 
sanitation, essential drugs, enhancement of the role of women as a facet of 
general development, and attempts to save children in areas of armed conflict. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
What Can Be Done? 
</P>
<P>
What can we do about the hunger and misery of children in so many areas of the 
world? As individuals, we can contribute to organizations like UNICEF that act 
as our conscience and our hands. As citizens, we can press for a solution of 
the current debt problem faced by many poor countries, whereby they send more 
money to the industrialized world as interest payments than they receive as 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
We can urge our national leaders to take the initiative in stopping the sale of 
"conventional" arms -- by the United States, the Soviet Union, France, Britain, 
Israel, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, West Germany and others -- which drain 
the meager resources of already impoverished countries. 
</P>
<P>
You and your family, like ours, may have plenty to eat and much to look forward 
to in the year ahead. But until all children in the world are fed and 
protected, our happiness will remain strikingly incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
Botulism Is Rare in the U.S., but Improper Storage Still a Villain 
</P>
<P>
Question: Botulism food poisoning is well publicized as potentially deadly. I 
am curious: How common is it? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: We're glad to say that in the United States, botulism remains rare. 
Between 1976 and 1984, 124 outbreaks of food-borne botulism were reported, 
involving 307 individuals and resulting in more than 20 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
While botulism traced to canned foods had decreased, unusual foods have been 
identified as the source of the problem. For example, potatoes wrapped in foil, 
baked, held for a prolonged period and then used in potato salad were named as 
the culprit in two restaurant outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
Another unusual source identified in an episode about five years ago that 
affected 28 people was sauteed onions. The butter they were cooked in 
apparently shut out oxygen, providing the environment in which the spores, 
which grow rather rapidly, could germinate. 
</P>
<P>
In yet another unusual outbreak of this potentially disastrous form of 
food-borne illness, 36 individuals were made ill from chopped garlic in soybean 
oil that had not been kept under refrigeration in the restaurant. Up to that 
time, both garlic in oil and cooked onions were thought to be incapable of 
supporting the growth of these microorganisms. 
</P>
<P>
In each of these cases, it is reasonable to conclude that if the food had been 
stored promptly in the refrigerator, the outbreak would never have happened. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Are nuts low in saturated fat? 
</P>
<P>
A: Most are quite high in fat, which provides about 70% to 90% of the calories 
in many varieties of nuts. In general, you might almost think of a nut as a 
tiny bag of fat. Fortunately, many are low in saturated fat. For example, an 
ounce of pecans contains 187 calories and 18 grams of fat. Less than half a 
gram of that fat is saturated. Several other types of nuts, among them 
filberts, almonds and English walnuts, present a similar profile, providing 
between 165 and 180 calories per ounce, but about half a gram of saturated fat. 
</P>
<P>
A second group includes nuts that contain slightly more saturated fat. An ounce 
of pine nuts, cashews or hickory nuts provides 145, 163 and 187 calories, 
respectively, but roughly 2 1/2 grams of saturated fat. Just how important the 
difference between these two groups is will depend on how many nuts you eat at 
one time and on how often you eat them. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, Brazil nuts, which have 187 calories per ounce, contain over 4 1/2 
grams of saturated fat. The largest source of saturated fat, however, is 
coconut. Calorically similar to Brazil nuts, it provides over 16 grams of 
saturated fat per ounce. 
</P>
<P>
A notable exception to the generalization that nuts are high-fat foods: 
European chestnuts. An ounce of chestnuts contains just a single gram of fat, 
little of which is saturated, and it contains only 105 calories. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I read in a magazine that fish is an excellent source of calcium. Is that 
true? 
</P>
<P>
A: Generally not, although there are exceptions. For purposes of comparison, 
we'll use some of the best dairy sources as our "gold standard." A cup of 
nonfat milk contains 300 milligrams, well over one-third of the adult 
recommended dietary allowance, or RDA, of 800 milligrams a day. An ounce of 
Cheddar cheese has 200 milligrams, and a cup of low-fat yogurt 415 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
At least two types of fish compare quite favorably. Both canned salmon and 
sardines, if mashed with the bones, can contribute considerable amounts of 
calcium. In that case, two ounces of salmon would provide 110 milligrams of 
calcium; the same amount of sardines, 250 milligrams of calcium. A cup of 
oysters contains 225 milligrams of calcium. And certain other shellfish, 
including crab meat and clams, provide considerably less -- between 50 and 60 
milligrams in a three-ounce serving. On the other hand, two ounces of broiled 
flounder or halibut would provide only about 15 milligrams, hardly making it an 
excellent choice in the calcium department. 
</P>
<P>
Other than dairy products, there are few good sources of calcium. Exceptions to 
this generalization include tofu, or soybean curd, as well as several 
vegetables. One half-cup of chopped broccoli or kale provides almost 90 
milligrams; of chopped turnip greens, 125 milligrams; bok choy, 125 milligrams; 
and collards, 165 milligrams. If tofu is prepared with calcium sulfate, four 
ounces will contain 145 milligrams. And an ounce of almonds has 60 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, it is important to keep in mind that while these are some of the 
better sources, small amounts from a variety of other foods -- including dried 
fruits, other vegetables and breads made with milk solids -- contribute to the 
total daily intake.

MENUS MEET CALORIC NEEDS OF THE AGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONI TIPTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Many people assume that dining in old age means lots of applesauce, mashed 
potatoes and pureed meat. 
</P>
<P>
This is simply not the case. 
</P>
<P>
It is true that as we age our bodies becomes less efficent at performing what 
were once considered normal tasks. Still, many elderly people are capable of 
living very much as they did when they were 10 or even 20 years younger. And, 
says Gail Frank, professor of nutrition at Cal State Long Beach, food can 
continue to be a source of comfort. "The good life is possible as we age," she 
says, "but we must be wise about what we eat." 
</P>
<P>
There is a paradox that comes with aging. As we grow older, our metabolism 
slows down tremendously so that the amount of food we require for fuel 
declines. At the same time, nutrient needs increase. 
</P>
<P>
While a daily intake of 1,400 calories might be considered a reducing diet for 
a 25-year-old woman, for her 70-year-old mother it would be nothing more than a 
standard diet. This makes it particularly difficult for seniors to get all the 
nutrients they need. For example, many older people eat diets deficient in 
calcium, and inadequate calcium is a leading cause of deficiency-related deaths 
in elderly women. 
</P>
<P>
To increase the amount of calcium in the diet, Frank recommends using nonfat 
dry milk as an extender in meat patties, turkey burgers, mashed potates, 
casseroles and baked goods. 
</P>
<P>
Stirring milk solids into fluid milk will boost the calcium content of the 
beverage for drinking and for cooking. Use 1/2 cup nonfat dry milk solids for 
every 2 cups milk. 
</P>
<P>
Digestion can be a problem as we grow older: Increasing the frequency of meals 
is one way to relieve this. Frequent meals can also help with constipation, 
another complaint. 
</P>
<P>
"Several small feedings are more appropriate than large meals," said Frank. "It 
may be better to have three small meals and three moderate snacks -- half a 
protien-rich sandwich, cooked fruit, dairy product and starch or low sugar 
dessert. And they should be spaced so that every four hours there is something 
coming into the stomach. This way, intestine and (digestive) juices aren't 
overwhelmed with a large volume of food. Plus, they have a smaller amount (of 
food) to interract with. This aids the absorption." 
</P>
<P>
In general, menus designed to meet the nutrient and physiological needs of the 
older adult can be similar to those selected for growing children, said Dr. 
Loren Lipson, chief of Geriatric Medicine, USC School of Medicine. He and Frank 
both agree that older adults, like growing teens, can benefit from a 
multivitamin supplement. It can make up for nutrient loss due to absorption 
problems, intake decline and drug interractions. 
</P>
<P>
"Consider current physical state," Frank said. "If older people are not able to 
manipulate or chew as well then we must alter the texture but we should still 
maintain the nutrient density (of the foods they eat). The elder person has to 
realize and accept that he may have to go to steamed or chopped foods more 
often . . . but eating is one of the areas in their lives where they can still 
maintain control." 
</P>
<P>
Here are three days of menus adapted from the Phase 1 eating plan outlined in 
the book "The New American Diet" by Sonja L. Connor, a registered dietitian and 
William E. Connor, MD (Simon and Schuster: $12.95). The plan features a 
cholesterol intake of about 300 of 350 milligrams per day. Fat content is 
around 35%. Carbohydrates are increased in the diet to fill in for fat and 
provide extra fiber.

<HEAD>Study Finds Estrogen Slightly Increases Breast Cancer Chances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women using estrogen after menopause run a
slightly greater risk of breast cancer, according to a study of
more than 118,000 nurses.
   But the authors of the study, which appears in Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical Association, emphasized that the
increased risk was modest and noted estrogen therapy holds many
benefits for post-menopausal women.
   ``While this study adds to a large body of information, I would
not recommend that a woman change her current use of estrogen
therapy based on these data alone,'' said one of the authors, Dr.
Meir Stampfer, of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.
   The researchers, led by Graham Colditz of Boston's Brigham and
Women's Hospital, also said the additional risk of breast cancer
dropped a year after the women stopped taking the female sex
hormones.
   Taking estrogen after menopause can help prevent calcium loss
from bones and may help to prevent heart disease, the leading
killer of older women.
   Even so, ``these data suggest the need for caution in the use of
estrogens,'' the authors wrote.
   Researchers found the post-menopausal women taking estrogen were
35 percent to 40 percent more likely to develop breast cancer than
those who did not take the hormone. But the risk was only about
half that a woman might face if her mother had breast cancer,
researchers said.
   The article analyzed data collected from 1976 to 1986 from more
than 118,000 women from the Nurses' Health Study.
   The Nurses' Health Study, established to study risk factors for
cancer and other diseases, was begun in 1976 with a group of more
than 121,000 female registered nurses 30 to 55 years old.
   The data analyzed 367,187 person-years of follow-up among
post-menopausal women, the researchers said. In all, 722 incidents
of breast cancer were identified among these women.

   Weight-conscious Americans may be giving themselves short shift
on nutrition, says the Center for Vitamin and Mineral Communications.
   The organization cites a U.S. Department of Agriculture survey of
21,000 people in which not one person got the recommended dietary
allowances (RDAs) of 10 nutrients needed for basic good health.
   The CVMC lists the 10 most needed nutrients, what they do and
where you can get them:
   _ Iron. It helps build healthy blood. An iron deficiency leads to
anemia, meaning blood cannot carry enough oxygen to the body's
cells, leaving you tired, weak and irritable. Best sources for iron
are lean meats, organ meats, green leafy vegetables, nuts, breads,
cereals and eggs. Eating these in combination with a vitamin C
source such as orange juice can help your body absorb more iron from
other foods.
   _ Folacin. It's vital to fetal growth and in making maternal
blood. A woman's blood volume doubles during pregnancy, and her
folacin stores may be depleted quickly if not enough is in her diet.
Folicin is found in leafy green vegetables and organ meats.
Overcooking should be avoided, because folacin is sensitive to heat
and easily destroyed, even with a microwave.
   _ Calcium. A bone and teeth builder, it also helps in blood
clotting, which helps the heart and nervous system work efficiently.
Three out of four women don't get enough calcium, and the deficiency
has been implicated in osteoporosis and high blood pressure. Best
sources are low-fat milk and cheeses, soy products such as tofu, and
broccoli. Cottage cheese, however, is not as rich in calcium as in
other dairy foods.
   _ Zinc. Zinc helps make up many of your body's enzymes that
regulate metabolism and also helps produce hormones for growth,
sexual development, taste, sight, smell and protein building. Recent
research also reveals zinc helps heal wounds and supports immune
functions. Women, the elderly, and vegetarians are most likely to
lack this element. Best sources are oysters, herring, milk and eggs.
Zinc also can be found in whole grains but in less absorbable form.
   _ Water. Water is essential for proper functioning of all cells,
making up two thirds of the body. Choose plain water, juices or
decaffeinated beverages. Alcoholic and caffeinated beverages, though
liquid, are dehydrants.
   _ Fiber. Fibers promote digestion and alleviate constipation.
Soluble fiber may help lower blood cholesterol and to a more limited
extent, blood sugars. Best sources are oat bran, legumes such as
dried peas and beans, rice bran, fruits and vegetables. Insoluble
fiber can reduce risk of colorectal and similar cancers and can help
diabetics. Whole grains, especially wheat and rye, some fruits and
vegetables are good sources. To increase fiber in your diet, do so
gradually and drink plenty of liquids. Too much fiber can cause
bloating, cramping and diarrhea.
   _ Beta carotene. Though not a vitamin itself, it can be converted
to vitamin A in the body, essential for night vision, healthy skin,
strong teeth and bones, and immunity. Beta carotene is an
antioxidant which will help protect body cells from damage that can
cause cancer. Foods with beta carotene are easy to spot because of a
characteristic carroty color _ cantaloupe, carrots, sweet potatoes,
winter squash and apricots. It also is found in dark leafy greens.
   _ Vitamin B-6. Along with other B vitamins, this element helps
produce energy in body cells. Its main job is to metabolize
proteins, so how much you need depends on how much protein you eat.
Inadequate B-6 may cause memory loss, lack of energy, irritability,
poor concentration, muscle aches, cold sores and digestive problems.
It's estimated that only 20 percent of all Americans, and only 7
percent of women, get enough of it. Lean meats, whole grains,
legumes, liver, wheat germ, salmon, bananas and sunflower seeds are
sources; these same foods also provide many of the B-complex
vitamins, including niacin, thiamine, B-12, riboflavin, folacin and
others.
   _ Vitamin C. Important for healthy gums, strong bones and teeth,
vitamin C also helps form collagen, the most abundant body protein.
It also is thought to act as an antioxidant, helping protect against
certain types of cancers. Citrus fruits, tomatoes, potatoes, and red
fruits like cherries and strawberries are good sources.
   _ Magnesium. It's part of every body cell, activating enzymes
that keep the body running smoothly. It also promotes bone growth
and helps the nervous system function. Inadequate magnesium in the
blood can cause abnormalities in the heartbeat called arrhythmias,
muscle cramps and muscle twitching. An estimated 75 percent of the
population _ and 86 percent of women _ fail to meet daily
requirements for magnesium. Sources include soybeans and soy
products, nuts, legumes, and whole grain foods.

<HEAD>Apples, Grapes, Broccoli Apparently Help Body Use Calcium</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fruits and vegetables high in boron _ like
apples and broccoli _ appear to keep bones stronger by preventing
loss of calcium.
   ``You could drink milk to kingdom come and never get any
boron,'' said Forrest H. Nielsen, director of the Department of
Agriculture's Human Nutrition Research Center in Grand Forks, N.D.
   Nielsen led a study of five men and 10 women who were given a
low-boron diet for nine weeks, then boron supplements for seven
weeks. When the boron was reduced, the subjects excreted more
calcium _ their bodies weren't using it.
   When boron was increase, ``there was less calcium in their
urine,'' and more calcium and an active form of vitamin D in their
blood, he said.
   Nielsen said nobody knows yet exactly what boron does in the
body; the first studies suggesting that it might be important were
done in 1987. ``Before 1987 there was no evidence that it might be
important in human nutrition. We'd known it was essential to plants
since 1910, but we still don't know what its biochemical role is
(in plants).''
   Nielsen said he isn't suggesting boron supplements. Large
amounts can cause changes similar to osteoporosis _ brittleness of
bones resulting from a loss of calcium _ and a well-balanced diet
will include enough, he said.
   Boron is found in broccoli, cabbage and other leafy vegetables;
nuts, legumes and fruits _ especially apples, pears and grapes, he
said. ``But when you talk about a meat and potatoes and milk and
cheese diet, you're talking about a diet low in boron. I think it's
absent in a lot of diets.''
   Harold Sandstead, chairman of preventive medicine and community
health at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston,
said, ``The findings are extremely interesting and might have
importance for human health. They have to be confirmed by another
researcher. But these are very careful workers.''

<HEAD>Earth Berms Cheaper, More Effective At Highway Noise Reduction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Earth berms on either side of a
highway cut noise levels in nearby neighborhoods better than
barrier walls, a researcher says.
   ``These are even more effective if they are covered with grass
or other vegetation because the carpet of plants absorbs the
sound,'' said Sabih Hayek, a professor of engineering science and
mechanics. Without vegetation, the berms simply reflect most of the
sound back onto the roadway.
   Most trees increase noise to neighborhoods near busy
thoroughfares because sound is reflected off leaves, he said. ``Fir
trees will work better because their needles do not reflect sound.
In fact, they absorb sound.''
   Artificial walls of concrete, fiberglass or wood reflect noise
back onto the roadway or over the barrier, said Hayek, whose
research was sponsored by the National Cooperative Highway Research
Program of the Transportation Research Board, representing 50 state
highway departments.
   ``It is possible to cut as much noise as you want using noise
barriers,'' Hayek said, ``however costs increase dramatically with
the increase in desired noise reduction.'' A 15-foot-high wall
costs $200 to $250 a foot to build.
   ``We have tested noise barriers covered with materials that
absorb sound, but the added cost of construction is notical
compared with the slight increase in noise reduction achieved with
absorbent barriers,'' he said.
   Double walls decrease noise levels behind them three-fold over a
single wall, and horizontal overhangs on vertical walls also can
greatly decrease noise levels, but are very expensive to buildhe
said.

<HEAD>Archaeologists Study Evidence Of Cannibalism Among Anasazi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Human bones found in an Anasazi ceremonial
chamberuggest the generally peaceful farmers may have turned to
cannibalism, at least for rituals that likely included prisoners,
an archaeologist says.
   ``My first reaction was, `Oh my God. Soch for our peaceful
farmers,''' said John Cater, a graduate student at
Colorado-Boulder. ``They were so shattered that it was all very
clear what was going on.''
   Archaeologists discovered the bones piled in neat patterns and
some smashed to bits in a ``kiva.'' Near the central firepit lay
stone axes and knives still smeared with microscopic traces of
ancient gore. The wooden ceiling of the kiva was collapsed when the
carnage was compleed, obscuring the evidence for nearly 1,000
years, near what is now the town of Yellow Jacket, Cater said.
   He believes the victims may have been prisoners, and rules out
hunger as a reason for the carnage. ``We've seen too many examples
of when times got rough, people just got up and left. That would be
a bption than eating the next-door '
   Frederick Lange, curator of anthropology at the university
museum, endorses Cater's analysis. But he said evidence at other
sites suggests some desperate Anasazi may have resorted to
cannibalism to ave off starvation.
   The Anasazi started a network of high-rise cliff dwellings in
the Southwest about A.D. 400 and deserted them 900 years later,
presumably after drought or invasion. Barely 10 percent of known
Anasazi ruins in Colorado, Utah, Arizew Mexico have been
excavated. Signs of cannibalism have been found in up to 20 digs,
scattered over thousands of square miles and centuries.

<HEAD>Supplements No Substitute for Good Food, Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans cannot make up for poor dietary
habits by loading up on megavitamins and other food supplements from
the drug store, experts said Thursday at a National Research Council
conference.
   ``All of the money that people are spending on these dietary
supplements would be far better spent on making better food choices.
That's the bottom line,'' said Anthony B. Miller, a University of
Toronto nutrition scientist who headed an NRC committee that studied
the issue.
   ``There's little indication that they (dietary supplements) are
doing harm, but there's no proof that they are doing the good that
people hope they will,'' he said. ``Vitamins are not an adequate
substitute.''
   Miller said though some people are comforted by their belief that
vitamin pills, fiber powders or calcium tablets correct any
nutrition deficit in their diet, ``this may be a false sense of
security.''
   He was elaborating on a study released Wednesday by the National
Research Council soundly rejecting the concept of taking food
supplements, such as vitamins, fiber or calcium, to make up for
deficits in the diet. Manufacture and sale of such supplements is a
$3 billion business, the study said, and up to 60 percent of
Americans take such supplements.
   In the council's 1,300-page report, a 19-member committee of
experts said they found no proof that such supplements actually
provided a health benefit for people on the average American diet.
   Instead, said Miller, the diet itself is the problem.
   The committee called for Americans to cut their fat consumption
to 30 percent of all calories consumed, reduce cholesterol intake to
300 milligrams and eat more complex carbohydrates, vegetables and
fruits.
   ``If you change your diet in the direction that we recommend, you
will not need these vitamins,'' said Miller.
   Dr. DeWitt S. Goodman of Columbia University, a member of the NRC
committee, said he was particularly concerned about people taking
vitamins in huge doses.
   ``Under no circumstances should Americans take megadoses of
anything,'' he said. ``That is highly undesirable. That we strongly
recommend against.''
   Large doses of some vitamins can be poisonous, said Goodman.
   Goodman conceded that vitamin pills do have uses for some people,
but he said they are not needed by the general population, and
certainly not 60 percent of all Americans.
   ``Individuals who for some reason have diets that do not meet
their individual needs, then multivitamins might be appropriate, but
that should be dealt with through a health professional,'' said
Goodman.
   Even days when a person's only food is just a quick sandwich,
said Goodman, are not a reason to take vitamin pills or other
supplements.
   ``There is an enormous cushion in these RDA (recommended dietary
allowances) to allow for not meeting the requirement for one day, or
two days or three days,'' he said.
   Goodman, Miller and other members of the NRC committee said what
is important is the pattern of foods that a person eats. The
studies, they said, show that healthful and disease-combatting
effects come from diets that include a variety of foods, not from
concentrating on certain elements such as vitamins, fiber or calcium.
   The comments came during a conference of nutrition experts
assembled to discuss the NRC report.
   Elaine Lanza, a scientist in the cancer prevention branch of the
National Cancer Institute, praised the position taken by the
committee.
   ``People need fruits, vegetables and whole grains in their diets,
not supplements,'' she said.

   SmithKline Beecham PLC's embattled ulcer drug Tagamet was dealt another blow in a new scientific report, but a silver lining in the study could ultimately rejuvenate the medication. 

   The report, by researchers at Rockefeller University, New York, is the first to explain previous studies that found that Tagamet causes annoying side effects in some men such as breast enlargement and reduced sex drive. 
But the study also hinted that Tagamet may have a role in treating osteoporosis in women. 

   The side effect in men is rare -- occurring in about 2% of patients who use the drug for more than six months -- and it's reversible. 
But Glaxo Holdings PLC of Britain has exploited the problem to help vault its own ulcer drug Zantac ahead of Tagamet in one of the pharmaceutical industry's biggest marketing wars ever -- a battle of billion-dollar ulcer drugs. 

   The report doesn't alter the substance of that battle, but its prominent appearance as the lead study in today's New England Journal of Medicine is certain to be seen by doctors and to be used by SmithKline's competitors, including Glaxo and Rahway, N.J.-based Merck &amp; Co., which markets Pepcid as an ulcer drug. 

   In their running battle, Glaxo and SmithKline each have exploited the publication of scientific studies supporting their own product or questioning the competitor's product. 
The market for the drugs is so sensitive to the publication of such studies that in this case, New England Journal editors requested revisions to the study to ensure fairness, one of the authors said. 
Tagamet, or cimetidine as it is known generically, and Zantac, or ranitidine, were the only drugs tested in the study. 
The stakes are huge. 
Tagamet hit the market in 1976 and quickly became the biggest-selling prescription drug in the world, peaking at sales of $1.13 billion in 1987. 
Zantac was marketed by Glaxo in early 1980s and rapidly eclipsed Tagamet, partly on claims that it lacked some of Tagamet's side effects. 
At the end of 1988, Zantac was the top-selling drug, with sales of about $2 billion a year. 
Tagamet sales were about $1 billion last year, in the range of what the company expects for 1989. 

   The study's key finding is that Tagamet interferes with the body's ability to process the sex hormone, estrogen. 
This interference causes a buildup of a form of estrogen that leads to the breast-enlargement problem in some men. 
But for this same reason, the drug may be beneficial in preventing osteoporosis in women. 
That disease, common in post-menopausal women and characterized by sometimes crippling bone loss, is caused by lack of estrogen. 

   "The side effect may actually have therapeutic value," said Jon J. Michnovicz, now medical director of the Institute for Hormone Research and co-author of the study with Richard A. Galbraith of Rockefeller University. 
Studies are under way with post-menopausal women, Dr. Michnovicz said, and early indications are that women are affected in much the same way as men. 
"The area is definitely wide open for discovery," he said. 

   In a statement, SmithKline said the study "doesn't contain new clinical information and doesn't conflict with current prescribing information for cimetidine." 
The Philadelphia-based company also said that in addition to osteoporosis, the study shows Tagamet may also have potential in cancer treatment. 

   In the study, nine healthy men took 800-milligram doses of Tagamet twice a day, about double the normal clinical dose, for two weeks. 
These volunteers had a 40% reduction in their ability to break down estradiol, a form of estrogen, and a 20% increase in blood levels of the hormone, the researchers found. 
In a second phase of the experiment, six men were given more common clinical doses of 400 milligrams twice a day for one week. 
These volunteers still had a 33% reduction in metabolizing the hormone. 

   By contrast, seven men who took 150 milligram doses of ranitidine daily for two weeks had no significant changes in processing the hormone, a finding that was expected because ranitidine hadn't previously been linked to the effects. 

   Tagamet and Zantac are known as H2 antagonists in that they help heal ulcers by blocking the action of histamine, a hormone-like chemical that triggers the release of stomach acid.

<HEAD>Study Urges Development of Leaner Meats and Dairy Products</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans eat too much animal fat and the
government should rewrite its regulations to encourage the
production of leaner meats and dairy products, the National
Research Council said today.
   The council, in a report on a 2{-year study, said that despite a
decline in fat consumption in recent years, Americans' dietary
habits still center too heavily on meat and dairy products rich in
animal fats, which can cause a variety of health problems.
   ``The nutrition-related health problems experienced by a large
segment of the U.S. population today arise from overconsumption of
fat, saturated fatty acids, and cholesterol,'' the report said.
   For other Americans, the report added, dietary problems center
on not getting enough calories, iron or calcium. Overall, the
report said, ``The incidence of nutrition-related health problems
is significant, affecting either directly or indirectly nearly
every American family.''
   Among the diet-related health problems cited are:
   _About 34 million Americans are overweight.
   _Nearly a million adults die annually of cardiovascular disease
that may be related to the consumption of high-cholesterol foods.
   _Osteoporosis, a disease caused by the leaching of calcium from
bone, strikes 15 to 20 million adults.
   _From eight and 12 million children are hungry due to inadequate
diets.
   _Iron deficiency is the most common form of childhood anemia.
   The study said that the present system of government regulations
in the meat industry tends to put more animal fat on American
tables.
   ``The present grading system for retail meats is not only costly
and inefficient but it encourages the overfattening of beef and
lamb,'' the report said. ``Trimming of fat at slaughter or at
purchase is only a partial, short-term response. The real solution
lies in the production of leaner animals.''
   Among the recommendations made in the study were that the
Agriculture Department permit the removal of fat from carcasses
immediately after slaughter, a system called ``hot fat trimming.''
   This, in effect, would penalize meat producers for additional
fat in the carcasses, the report said.
   An Agriculture Department spokesman said that ``hot fat
trimming'' has been proposed and now is under study by the industry.
   The study also recommended that ways be found to reduce the
cholesterol in animal products, to identify the fat and protein
content of live animals and carcasses, and to reduce the fat and
fatty acid ratios of meat, milk and eggs through breeding or
feeding programs. Ways also should be found, the report said, to
reduce the amount of salt contained in prepared meats and meat
products.
   Additionally, the study said that the Food and Drug
Administration should establish standards for such terms as
``natural'' and that the USDA restrict use of the terms ``light'',
``lite'' and ``lean'' to ``some objective standard'' for cuts of
meat. The terms then would apply to specific nutrient content and
identify levels of fat in meat and other products.

<HL> Bone-Density Loss Linked to Long Use Of Thyroid Hormone </HL>
<SO>  </SO>
<IN> PHA </IN>
<DATELINE> CHICAGO (AP)  </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women shouldn't throw out their thyroid prescriptions even though a commonly prescribed hormone may cause some long-term thinning of the bones, a doctor said. 

   The most commonly prescribed thyroid hormone, L-thyroxine, previously had been considered safe when taken over a number of years, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. 

   But 31 young women treated with L-thyroxine for at least five years were found to have 10% to 13% less bone density in their hips than 31 women in a comparison group matched for age and weight, the study said. 

   Loss of bone mass, also called osteoporosis, is usually most serious in women after menopause and is largely to blame for the hip fractures that afflict one-third of women who reach age 90, the study said. 

   But one of the authors, Dr. Lewis E. Braverman, cautioned that the study is only preliminary, and said, "We don't know, and we are not suggesting, that these very small changes in hip (bone density) will be associated with an increased fracture rate." 

   "We are not saying thyroid hormone should not be used because it causes bone loss," said Dr. Braverman, of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester. 
"We are saying the dose of Lthyroxine should be carefully adjusted to the individual need of the patient, which can now be done with sensitive new assays." 

   Before new tests were developed about two years ago to measure precise blood levels of L-thyroxine, marketed as Levothroid and Synthroid, doctors were more likely to prescribe excess levels, Dr. Braverman said. 

   Most of the millions of patients who take it must do so indefinitely to counteract the hormone deficiency created by an underactive thyroid gland, thyroid cancer or a condition known as goiter, an enlargement of the thyroid that leads to a swelling of the neck. 

   Hypothyroidism causes body functions to slow down and, if untreated, can lead to a deterioration in a person's physical and mental health. 
The problem can become so severe that simple mental tasks, such as adding up a bill, take longer. 

   "One of the risks in something (a finding) like this is you have people say, 'I'm going to stop taking my thyroid so I won't get osteoporosis.' 
That's disastrous," Dr. Braverman said. 

   But an editorial accompanying the study in the journal suggested that doctors might need to rethink their approach to treating thyroid hormone deficiencies. 

   "Is it appropriate to treat a benign thyroid problem with a medication that potentially could cause osteoporosis?" said the editorial, by Dr. David S. Cooper of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. 

   "The whole concept of suppression therapy for benign thyroid disease may need reevaluation, especially in older women, whose skeletons are the most likely to be in jeopardy," he said. 

   The study found no loss of bone mass in the spine, the doctors said. 
Spinal bone loss can cause the reduction in height and back curvature that mark advanced cases of osteoporosis.

<HEAD>Yogurt a Popular Health Food for Thousands of Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tales of 120-year-old yogurt eaters with the
boundless energy of adolescents made memorable television
commercials and fed the notion that even if it is not the key to
eternal youth, yogurt sure is healthy.
   Hence workers lunching at their desks with little containers of
fruit-flavored yogurt, or shoppers choosing frozen yogurt over ice
cream, or parents getting their kids to snack on yogurt. Americans
eat 4.6 pounds per person annually, a 110 percent increase in 10
years, according to the National Yogurt Association.
   Yogurt is healthy, but that doesn't mean it is calorie-,
sugar-or fat-free.
   To keep down fat consumption, buy low- or no-fat yogurt. Read
labels carefully, especially on frozen yogurt containers, to make
sure there is no unwanted added fat or sugar.
   Add fruit or other flavorings to plain yogurt; use it plain to
replace sour cream or mayonnaise in sauces and dips. It also will
work in marinades and in many recipes for bread or other baked
goods.
   However, it will curdle if put into hot liquids. Whipping it can
break the curd and make the yogurt watery.
   There is a significant difference in calories and fat content
among the various types and brands of yogurt. A cup of non-fat
plain yogurt has 90 to 110 calories, none from fat. Flavored
yogurts can have as many as 270 calories a cup, and some varieties
get more than a third of their calories from fat.
   Yogurt, fermented milk with living microbes, was not discovered
by hippies who made it in communes. It has been eaten for at least
4,000 years in many parts of the world. Throughout the Middle East,
women moving to a foreign place traditionally carried a bit of
starter culture to ferment milk, the Yogurt Association said.
   It is the action of live cultures that converts milk into yogurt
and the natural bacteria that gives yogurt its distinctive taste.
The specific type of culture used needn't be listed on the label,
which will distinguish between living cultures and those that have
been killed through pasteurization.
   Inactive cultures are thought to lose their therapeutic benefit,
Jean Carper said in her book, ``The Food Pharmacy.''
   No one has documented extraordinary longevity based on yogurt
consumption, but early this century, Nobel Prize-winning scientist
Elias Metchnikoff argued that eating fermented milk would
counteract disease-causing microbial putrefaction in the
intestines, Carper said.
   People long have used yogurt to ward off or fight intestinal
